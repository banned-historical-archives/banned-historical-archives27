 CIVIL WAR SIDELIGHT
 Mr. BYRD of West Virginia.  Mr.
 President, Civil War "buffs" will doubt-
 lessly find the October 12, Beckley,
 W. Va., Post-Herald, column by the
 Reverend Shirley Donnelly of much
 merit, in view of the light which it casts
 an the emotional climate of the war-torn
 years of the War Between the States.
 The Reverend Mr. Donnelly is a man
 of wide and versatile interests, and I
 have always felt fortunate to have his
 friendship, having once taught a Sunday
 morning Bible class at the Crab Orchard
 Baptist Church, in Crab Orchard, W. Va.,
 with the encouragement which he, as
 pastor of that church, gave to me as a
 member of his congregation undertaking
 for the first time serious responsibility
 as a layman of the church.
 I ask unanimous consent to have the
 article, "David S. Creigh Was Greenbrier
 Martyr," Printed In the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 DAVID  S.  CREIGH  WAS  GREENasun  MARTYR.
 (By Shirley Donnelly)
 Mrs. Merritt Lowry, John Merritt Waddell,
 and    Miss Trove  Kittinger-three of  the
 grandchildren of the late O. W. Kittinger and
 Rachel Wright Kittinger-live at Alderson.
 O. W. Kittinger was the last survivor of
 those who attended the military commission
 trial of David S. Creigh (May 1, 1809, to June
 11, 1864), "the Greenbrier martyr."  The
 father of O. W. Kittinger was George W.
 Kittinger.  The two men, along with George
 L. Knapp and S. S. Hern, were permitted to
 attend the Creigh trial.
 After Creigh was condemned to be hanged
 and turned over to 20 Yankee cavalrymen
 to march him away on foot to await his
 execution, Creigh told all those present
 goodby.  The last one the 15-year-old con-
 demned man spoke to on that occasion was
 O. W. Kittinger, then just a small boy.
 Events which led to the trial were like
 this :
 Creigh and his family were living in the
 large brick mansion a couple of miles from
 Lewisburg on the way to the Davis-Stuart
 School.  It is the  high,  white-columned
 house now owned and occupied by the
 Boons.
 At that time-the fall of 1Q63 when the
 Lynchburg  campaign  was   about  to  be
 launched by the Federal armies--Gen. George
 Crook, who was in command of the 2d
 Infantry Division, occupied the Lewisburg
 area.  The Federal units were planning to
 move on Lynchburg from the West.
 ovjed Fpelease 2003/10/14: CIA-RDP67B00446R000300140007-7
 On, or about, November 8, while Creigh
 was away from his home, a blue-uniformed
 man, with bridle in hand and drunk, entered
 the Creigh home.  He began to pillage the
 place and insulted Creigh's daughter who
 was sick in bed with a fever.  After flaunt-
 ing some of the girl's clothing in the faces of
 the girl and her mother, the Yankee started
 to break open a trunk that was in the room.
 It was at this point that Creigh returned.
 The Yankee drew his pistol.    Mrs. Creigh
 grabbed the arm of the drunken soldier and
 thus prevented her husband's being killed
 as the gun discharged.  Creigh caught the
 man by the collar and threw him out of the
 room.
 in the upper hail they scuffled and the
 Yankee was shot and killed. It was charged
 that Creigh killed the man with a derringer
 pistol which he had. O. W. Kittinger always
 contended that the Yankee was killed as he
 fired his own service gun.  Bullets,recovered
 much later from the body were those of the
 type fired in a derringer.  For the killing,
 Creigh was tried and hanged.
 After the soldier was killed, the body was
 covered with straw and dropped into a dry
 well on the Creigh estate. There it remained
 until the drought of 1936 when it was ex-
 amined and pictures taken of the things
 found among the remains.  Julian Cobb of
 Ronceverte took the pictures, Including the
 two derringer bullets which he later sent
 to me.
 A slave divulged the news of the slaying
 to military authorities some time after the
 trouble occurred. This led to Creigh's arrest,
 Shortly before Cyrus Creigh, the oldest son
 of David Creigh, died, he gave the facts
 about the case to O. W. Kittinger.
 Creigh was marched on foot to Staunton,
 Va., a hundred miles away.  General Hunter
 approved the verdict of the military court
 and set June 10, 1864, as the date for the
 hanging. On that date Crigh was at Browns-
 burg, Rockbridge  County, Va., Imprisoned
 in a Negro slave cabin under heavy guard.
 It appears that Creigh was not executed
 until sunrise on June 11, 1864. They hanged
 him at Bellview on the limb of a tree. After
 the sentence was carried out the body was
 cut down and buried in a blanket on the spot.
 Six days later a coffin was secured and the
 body was taken to the graveyard of New
 Providence Church in Rockbridge County.
 On July 28, 1864, Creigh's remains were dis-
 interred a second time and brought back to
 Lewisburg.
 On July 31, a mile-long funeral cortege
 wound its way to the old stone church where
 Rev. J. C. Barr conducted the funeral serv-
 ice, using as his subject "The Christian
 Marfyr."  The tombstone states:
 "Sacred to the memory of David Creigh.
 Died as a martyr in defense of his rights and
 in the performance of his duties as a husband
 and father.  Born May 1, 1808, and yielded
 to his unjust fate June 11, 1864, near Browns-
 burg, Va."                                                                            The grave is 30 steps east of the
 rear of the historic meetinghouse at Lewis-
 burg,
 O. W. Kittinger said, "I shall never forget
 how this good man looked when he came
 down to tell us all goodbye.  He was very
 much agitated and great beads of perspira-
 tion stood out on every feature of his face.  I
 was the last one he spoke to In Greenbrier."
 SALUTE TO AMERICA'S NEWS-
 PAPERS
 Mr. BYRD of West Virginia, Mr.
 President, the week of October 10-16
 has been designated as National News-
 paper Week. I wish to salute our Na-
 tion's newspapers and the great service
 which. they render to the citizens of this
 free Republic.
 The Williamson, W. Va.. Daily News
 26181
 of October 11, presented an editorial in
 observance of this special week which
 I feel states, most effectively, the special
 worth of newspapers in our American
 way of life.
 The editor takes cognizance of the de-
 sire of the American public for dispas-
 sionate reporting and expressions of
 opinions grounded in accuracy and in-
 formed with integrity and courage.  I
 feel that this is a clear expression of the
 true mission of any high caliber news-
 paper and should at all times represent
 the goal of responsible news publications.
 To report news in a biased and slanted
 fashion, with facts chosen to fit into a
 preconceived editorial, or managerial,
 policy, neither serves the best interests
 of American citizenry nor of the newspa-
 per fraternity itself.
 A newspaper, as an instrument of the
 power of the press and a practitioner of
 the right of free speech, has the privilege
 to speak openly and without censorship,
 but it also has a responsibility to speak
 accurately and with integrity.
 I ask unanimous consent to have the
 Williamson Daily News article, "News-
 papers: Lights of Liberty," printed in the
 RECORD.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 NEWSPAPERS: LIGHTS OF LIBERTY
 Editor  and  Publisher  Yearbook  reports
 that as of September 30, 1964, the 1,763 daily
 newspapers in the United States has a com-
 bined circulation of 60.412,266.
 This is the highest circulation in history
 and a 2.5 percent increase over 1963.
 Sunday papers numbered 561 with a cir-
 culation of 48,383,076.  This is also a gain
 over 1963, up by 11 papers and a million
 and a half circulation.
 All of which information is apropos of
 observing that the week of October 10-16
 is National Newsps per Week.
 These figures add up to a lot of newspapers.
 There ca,n never be too many of them in a
 free land, however, for the quality of free-
 dom depehds in great measure on the news
 reporting, news analysis and news editorial-
 izing performed by an unfettered and com-
 petitive press.
 The figures add up to a lot of readers, too,
 especially when we add some 8,000 weeklies
 with a circulation of more than 24 million.
 The circulation numbers overlap, of course;
 they include people who subscribe to more
 than one paper.
 On the other hand, they do not include
 millions of others who are not counted in the
 paid circulation but who see and read and
 are otherwise exposed to newspapers.
 it is safe to say that the individual in
 America today who does not read at least
 some part of some newspaper regularly is a
 pretty rare bird indeed.
 Whenever any newspaper, large or small,
 goes out of business or is shut down by a
 strike, it is if a light were turned off in the
 community it served.
 No other communications medium fills so
 many and so varied needs of modern life-
 from want ads to advice columns, from so-
 ciety notes to vital statistics, from comics to
 sermons.
 Not all of these are secondary to a news-
 paper's  reason  for  existence-of  being  a
 newspaper.  Yet in this day of almost in-
 stantaneous electronic dissemination of ma-
 jor news events, even this category has un-
 dergone fundamental change.
 People look to their newspaper not just
 for headlines or spot news but the news be-
 hind the news.  They want background, ex-

 enable them to understand tomorrow's news
 when it happens:
 . They want not only dispassionate report-
 ing; they Want opinion on all sides of every
 issue-opinion that is grounded In accuracy
 and informed with integrity and courage.
 A newspaper is a light in its community
 and its country.  That is why totalitarian
 governments, which prosper in human dark-
 ness, must gag them.  That is why freedom
 of the press was the first to be cataloged in
 the Bill of Rights of the Constitution.
 America has many such lights.  Happily,
 the number Is growing, despite the deaths
 of some and the merger of others. Each one
 of them contributes to the brilliance of the
 larger light of liberty,
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, is the

 FECI'ED BY A MAJOR DISASTER
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I ask
 that the Chair lay before the Senate a
 message from the House of Representa-
 tives on H.R. 9022.   -
 The PRESIDING OFFICER laid be-
 fore the Senate a message from the
 House of Representatives that the I-louse
 concur in the amendments of the Senate
 numbered 1 through 10, inclusive, and 12
 to the bill (H.R. 9022) entitled "An Act
 to amend Public Laws 815 and 874, 81st
 Congress, to provide financial assistance
 In the construction and operation of
 public elementary and secondary schools
 In areas affected by a major disaster; to
 eliminate inequities in the application of
 Public Law 815 in certain military, base
 closings; to make uniform eligibility re-
 quirements for school districts in Public
 Law 874; and for other purposes."
 Resolved, That the House concur in the
 amendment of the, Senate numbered 11, with
 amendment, as follows: On page 3, line 14
 V the Senate engrossed amendments fol-
 lowing the word "Commissioner," strike out
 "to whom that agency provided free pub-
 lic education" and insert in lieu thereof the
 following: "at schools for handicapped chil-
 dren operated or supported by that State
 agency."
 Mr.  MORSE.  Mr.  President,  this
 matter has been cleared with the major-
 ity and minority membership of the
 Committee on Labor and Public Welfare.
 One behalf of the committee, I move that
 the Senate concur In the amendment of
 t to House to the amendment of the Sen-
 ate numbered 11.
 The motion was agreed to.
 LABOR POLICIES OF THE STATE OF
 TEXAS
 Mr. MORSE.        Mr. President, my at-
 tention was Invited a few moments ago
 to a speech made In the Senate on Oc-
 tober 12, beginning at page 25752, by my
 good friend the junior Senator from
 Texas [Mr. TOWER],  The speech pur-
 ports to answer the criticism that I made
 in the Senate on October 11 concerning
 the labor policies of the State of Texas
 and of the Governor of Texas vis-a-vis
 the position of the Governor 'of Texas
 on section 14(b) of the Taft-Hartley Act.
 The Senator from Texas seems to be
 laboring under a misapprehension.
 Mr. YARBOROUGH.  Mr. President,
 will the Senator from Oregon yield?
 Mr. MORSE. I yield.
 Mr. YARBOROUGH.  Will the dis-
 tinguished Senator from Oregon please
 designate the Senator from Texas to
 whom he is referring?
 Mr. MORSE.  Let the record be per-
 fectly clear that I am referring to the
 Republican Senator from Texas [Mr.
 TOWER].
 Mr. YARBOROUGH. I thank the dis-
 tinguished Senator from Oregon.
 Mr. MORSE.  I make that reference
 to the junior Senator from Texas [Mr.
 TOWER] with the greatest respect and
 the utmost courtesy and good will.  I
 find the junior Senator from Texas to
 be incorrect on point after point that he
 makes In his supposed rebuttal to my
 speech.
 I have not had an opportunity to re-
 turn to my office since reading the speech
 of the junior Senator from Texas [Mr.
 TOWER].  Next week, however, I shall
 reply in greater detail to his speech.  I
 now incorporate by reference, though,
 every charge that I made in my speech
 on last Monday, in which I referred to
 the labor policies of the State of Texas
 and of its present Governor.
 The junior Senator from Texas [Mr.
 TowERI says that he thinks I am very
 much mistaken in regard to wages paid
 in textile mills In Texas. He may have
 a point of distinction. The mills I talked
 about are garment mills. To me, a gar-
 ment mill is a textile mill.  But appar-
 ently the junior Senator from Texas has
 another definition for textile mills.
 I .am talking about garment mills
 along the border, in which shocking sub-
 standard wages are being paid, but
 which, of course, are permissible under
 the right-to-work law of Texas.
 Since 1947, when I led the fight in this
 body against the Taft-Hartley bill, and
 particularly  called  attention  to  the
 dangers of so-called right-to-work laws,
 I have said many times, that such laws
 would lead to just the kind of unsavory
 labor conditions that exist in garment
 mills in the State of Texas.
 Next, my good friend from Texas [Mr.
 TOWER] denies that trucks leave Texas
 every morning for Mexico, where they
 are loaded with Mexicans who are
 brought back into Texas for their daily
 work. He denies that Mexican workers
 are exploited in Texas garment mills
 ;r 15, 1965
 and in other Texas industries at wages
 far below the legal minimum wage. Next
 week I shall provide my good friend
 from Texas with an accounting of some
 of the wages paid in Texas, wages as low
 as $12, $13, and $14 a week.  If that is
 not exploitation, I want the junior Sena-
 tor from Texas to give me his definition
 of "exploitation."
 The low wages that are paid are so
 important a matter of international con-
 cern that at the interparliamentary
 meeting of delegates of the U.S. Con-
 gress and delegates from the Mexican
 Congress, held in Mexico City earlier this
 year, the frightful labor conditions that
 exist in Texas and other border States
 were the subject of an official discussion
 among the parliamentarians of the two
 countries.
 The Mexican parliamentarians left no
 room for doubt. They believed that the
 parliamentarians  from  the  United
 States-of whom I was one, and the ma-
 jority leader, the Senator from Montana
 [Mr. MANSFIELD]   was another-should
 come back to the United States, look into
 this situation, and do something about
 it.
 As chairman of the Subcommittee on
 Latin American Affairs, I have tried to
 do something about it.  Our committee
 held an executive session some months
 ago, in which session we had before the
 committee representatives of labor, or
 attaches, and representatives of the U.S.
 Government.   These     representatives
 talked to us, at some length about the
 very problem which I discussed the other
 day, which concerned the abuses that
 have arisen under the section 14(b) or
 the right-to-work provisions of the Taft-
 Hartley law, In terms of this exploitation
 by Texas of Mexicans who are brought
 into Texas every morning and taken out
 of Texas every night, and exploited dur-?
 ing the day by Texas employers who pay
 them wages far below the standard wage.
 Mr. President, I am very glad to join
 issue with my friend, the junior Senator
 from Texas [Mr. TOWER], in regard to
 the matter and we will let the facts speak
 for themselves.
 I received the following telegram from
 H. S. "Hank" Brown, president, and Roy
 R. Evans, secretary-treasurer of the
 Texas AFL-CIO:
 Bravo. Bravo. Your statement about Con-
 nally being notorious in his attitude toward
 decent wages printed in the Dallas Morning
 News today.  The industries involved pri-
 marily in the truck hauling are garment and
 agricultural involving from 50,000 to 100,000
 Mexican aliens daily who are picked up on
 the U.S. side. Texans are hauled like cattle
 across State lines by the thousands to work
 in other States with the assistance of the
 Texas  Employment  Commission  and  the
 Texas Bureau of Labor Statistics. Thanks
 again.
 Mr. President, I have been advised that
 a part of the truck-hauling technique is
 to have the trucks meet the Mexicans
 midway on an international bridge and
 load them up on the bridge, or meet them
 on the Texas side of the bridge and load
 them into the trucks, and move them to
 low-paying exploiting Texas plants, or

 the Soviet Union.
 These are but a few facts In support
 of tile contention that a policy of un-
 conditional Western credits- short- or
 long-term-would enable the European
 Communist governments to forego those
 reforms in the structure and operation
 of their economy which are called for
 if they are to overcome the serious prob-
 le7rs they are now confronted with.
 Left to their own devices these regimes
 would be compelled by necessity to drop
 some of their politically motivated eco-
 nomic policies, such as collectivization
 of agriculture or rigid and centralized
 planning in industry.
 This would result not only in more at-
 tention to the people's welfare but also
 in a dispersal of power.
 This would be a salutary political de-
 velopment because a government which
 is more responsive to the needs of the
 people and whose powers are less con-
 centrated Is,. to that degree, less prone
 to engage in subversive or aggressiv_- ad-
 ventures in its foreign policies.
 I have taken the trouble to set forth
 the facts In some detail because I think
 that the facts are sufficient to make it
 possible for completely reasonable citi-
 zens to take a stand against the proposed
 sale of a synthetic rubber plant to the
 Rumanian  Government  and  against
 other similar measures which  would
 serve to enhance the overall industrial
 canacity of the Communist bloc.
 I have many differences on questions
 of domestic policy with the Young Amer-
 icans for Freedom.  But they were act-
 ing completely within their rights as
 citizens in opposing the Firestone rub-
 ber deal and in bringing pressure to
 bear on the Firestone Co. in support of
 their views.
 We have accorded every freedom of
 action to critics of our Vietnam policy.
 because this is the American tradition.
 It is my hope that those who may dis-
 aaree with the administration in other
 areas will not, In future, be denigrated
 as vigilantes, but will instead be granted
 the same freedom of criticism and the
 same liberty of action that we grant the
 critics of administration policy In Viet-
 nam.
 ~..THE ANTI-VIETNAM PROTEST
 .             MOVEMENT
 Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have sent
 to the offices of every Senator a copy of
 a study entitled "The Anti-Vietnam
 Agitation and the Teach-in Movement."
 This study was prepared, at my request,
 by the staff of the Senate Subcommittee
 or Internal Security.
 The study points out that:
 The great majority of  those  who have
 participated in anti-Vietnam demonstrations
 and in teach-tne sue loyal Americans who dif-
 fer with administration policy In Vietnam for
 a variety of reasons, ranging from purely
 strategic considerations to pacifism.
 On the other hand, the study points
 to the conclusion that:
 The control of the anti-Vietnam movement
 has clearly parsed from the hands of the
 moderate elements who may have controlled
 it at one time, Into the hands of Communists
 pathetic to the. Vietcong and openly hostile
 to the Uuited States. and who call for.mas-
 aivo civil disobedience, Including the burn-
 ing of draft cards and the Stopping of troop
 trains.  This is particularly true of the na-
 tional Vietnam protest movement scheduled
 for October 16-16.
 I have been asked what evidence there
 Is that the anti-Vietnam agitation and
 the teach-in movement have been In-
 filtrated and are being manipulated by
 the Communists. There area number of
 facts, all of them contained in the study,
 which, taken together, would. I believe,
 convince any reasonable person that this
 is so.
 The mere fact that these demonstra-
 tions are being organized on a worldwide
 basis is, in my opinion, a complete give-
 away. Pacifists and liberals do not main-
 tain a worldwide apparatus.  Only the
 Communists have a worldwide apparatus
 capab'c of inspiring or contriving simul-
 taneous demonstrations in many coun-
 tries.
 Second, there is the fact that confi-
 dential American Communist Party di-
 rectives to their members, which are re-
 producted in our study, instruct them
 to get into the movement and even
 target the organizations to be infil-
 trated.
 Third, there is the fact that Moscow
 broadcasts have openly boasted that the
 Communists in every country are march-
 ing in the forefront of the anti-Vietnam
 protest movement.
 Fourth, there Is the fact that a num-
 ber  of  long-time  Communists  have
 played and are playing a prominent role
 in the work of organizing these protest
 demonstrations.
 The Communists are smart enough to
 have respected citizens heading up move-
 ments they support and appearing on
 their platform. But if you look closely,
 the hands of the real organizers become
 apparent.
 For example, In May 1960, the Na-
 tional Committee for a Sane Nuclear Pol-
 icy organized a mass rally at Madison
 Square Garden.  The members of this
 committee are all eminently respectable
 citizens.   So were the speakers at the
 mass rally.  But it turned. out that the
 actual organizer of this rally was one,
 Henry tbrams, a veteran member of the
 Communist Party.  The same Henry
 Abrams, I note, is listed as the No. 1
 staff member in charge of organizing the
 Fifth Avenue Vietnam Peace Parade
 tomorrow,  I have here an ad from the
 Trotskyite Communist newspaper, the
 Militant, in which Abrams' name is
 listed, and which appeals to all Trot-
 skyites and radicals to turn out.
 The subcommittee study at many
 points Identifies known Communist par-
 ticipants and people with long and per-
 sistent  records  of  association  with
 Communist-front causes, who are play-
 ing a prominent role in the present anti-
 Vietnam agitation.
 I 'hope that all of my colleagues Will

 because I beelieve it will give them a new
 insight Into what is taking place this

 The landscapes of southeast Asia and the

 But our fighting men are not sent to Viet-

 know why they go and what may be expected
 of them.  So do we.  And it to time to look to
 the welfare of the C1I upon whom we impose
 a heavy burden.  I suggest that he deserves
 some of the Great Society treatment to which
 we have properly dedicated ourselves.
 We therefore direct the attention of our

 NOMINATION OF TOM LILLEY TO BE
 A MEMBER OF THE EXPORT-IM-
 FORT BANK OF WASHINGTON
 Mr. ROBERTSON.  Mr. President, I
 have today reported from the Banking
 and Currency Committee the nomina-
 tion of Mr. Tom Lilley to be a member
 of the Board of Directors of the Export-
 Import Bank of Washington.
 The committee held a hearing on Mr.
 Lilley's nomination at which he appeared
 and testified. The committee was very
 favorably impressed with Mr. Lilley's
 qualifications for the position.
 Two questions arose.  Mr. Lilley was
 nominated as a resident of West Virginia.
 He was personally presented to the com-
 mittee by Senator  RANDOLPH,  though
 nominated as a Republican, and his
 nomination was,approved by the junior
 Senator from West Virginia [Mr, BYRD].
 At the hearing it developed that Mr. L11-
 ley, though a native of West Virginia, has
 lived for some years in Michigan.  Ac-
 cordingly, the committee felt it appro-
 priate to consult the Senators from
 Michigan for their views on the matter,
 and we (lave now received letters from
 them.  I ask unanimous consent that
 their letters may be printed in the REC-
 ORD at the conclusion of my remarks.
 In addition, Mr. Lilley is resigning as
 vice president of the Ford Motor Co., in
 charge of the Canadian overseas group.
 Mr. Lilley has advised the committee of
 his financial arrangements with the
 Ford Motor Co.,; and an extensive ex-
 cerpt from his letter to me on this sub-
 ject is set forth in.the hearing.
 In order to complete the record on this
 point, I ask unanimous consent that an
 excerpt from a letter to Mr. Lilley by
 Henry Ford II be printed in the RECORD
 at the conclusion of my remarks. Also,
 I should add that, under the trust which
 Mr. Lilley is creating to handle his se-
 curities, the deed of trust will provide
 that the trustee is to inform Mr. Linder,
 the President Of the Export-Import
 Bank, of all changes in investments, and
 My. .Linder _ will. undertake the respon-
 sibility of seeing that Mr. I,illey does not
 vote on matters, relating to companies in
 which he has a financial interest.
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 years has been a resident of Michigan.
 Based upon that long acquaintanceship,I

 Mr. Tom LILLEY,
 Ann Arbor, Mich.
 DEAR Tom: In connection with your nom-
 ination as a Director of the Export-Import
 Bank of Washington, I am writing to fur-
 nish you with a statement of your rights
 under the supplemental compensation plan.
 You have unpaid. installments of awards
 made to you for the years 1962, 1963, and
 1964 under the supplemental compensation
 plan.  As you know, awards under that plan
 generally are payable in four equal annual
 installments.   One-fourth of the award is
 paid in the year next succeeding that for
 which the award is made and the balance
 is payable in equal installments on January
 10 of each of the next 3 years, subject to
 fulfillment of the earning out conditions of
 the plan.
 A summary of the installments thus pay-
 able to you Is shown in the following table:
 The right to receive payment of any in-
 stallment of an award to you will accrue
 under the plan only if from the time of
 termination of your employment until De-
 cember 31 of the year preceding that in
 which the installment is payable, you earn
 out the installment by fulfilling two condi-
 tions, essentially as follows:
 1. By refraining from certain competitive
 activities, as set forth in the plan.
 2. By making yourself available, upon re-
 quest, at reasonable times and upon a reason-
 able basis, to consult with, supply informa-
 tion to, and otherwise cooperate with the
 company or any subsidiary thereof with re-
 spect to any matter that was handled by you
 or under your supervision while in the em-
 ploy of  the company or any subsidiary
 thereof.
 In view of your nomination as a Director
 of the Export-Import Bank of Washington,
 the Salary and Supplemental Compensation
 Committee (which, as you know, consists en-
 tirely of nonemployee directors, ineligible for
 awards), at a meeting held today, considered
 the question of the effect of service in that
 capacity upon both of the earning-out con-
 ditions. The committee unanimously deter-
 mined, and so interpreted the supplemental
 compensation plan, that (1) service by you
 as a Director of the Export-Import Bank of
 Washington would not result in nonfulfill-
 ment of the condition relating to competi-
 tive activity applicable to unpaid install-
 ments of any supplemental. compensation
 award to you and (2) it would not be reason-
 able for the company to request of you any
 of the services contemplated by the consulta-
 tion, and cooperation condition during the
 period of your service in that capacity, and,
 accordingly, that neither your activities in
 that capacity nor your failure to comply with
 the consultation and cooperation condition
 provisions would result in nonfulfillment of
 such conditions.
 In view of this determination, you will not
 be called upon by the company for any of the

 MORALE IN VIETNAM AND AT HOME
 Mr. LAUSCHE.  Mr. President, there
 is no 40-hour workweek or double time
 pay for our men in Vietnam.  They work
 around the clock; sleep in hot and humid
 foxholes; are plagued with tropical dis-
 eases and snipers' bullets, while engaged
 in an effort to arrest and stamp out the
 world's greatest and most destructive
 disease-communism.
 They fully realize that they must fore-
 go the freedoms and comforts of home;
 they understand that they face death at
 every turn in the steaming, disease-in-
 fested jungle; they understand that they
 are being furnished with the best avail-
 able under the circumstances to provide
 for their protection and comfort-but
 what they cannot understand is the lack
 of united moral support from the citi-
 zenry back home.
 Mr. President, these are some of the
 thoughts of Pfc. Donald A. Gibson ex-
 pressed in an extremely well-written and
 thought-provoking letter to me.
 I ask unanimous consent that Private
 First Class Gibson's letter be printed at
 this point in the RECORD, and I hope that
 members of these anti-Vietnam groups
 read it.  The finger of shame Is pointed
 at them.
 There being no objection, the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 Senator FRANK LAUSCHE,
 U.S. Senate Office Building,
 Washington, D.C.
 DEAR SENATOR LAUSCHE:  Today, as I read
 the September 29 issue of Army Times, I
 came across a news brief which stated:
 "Senator FRANK LAUSCHE, Democrat of Ohio,
 says he has heard reports that peaceniks
 plan to stage a big sit-down in California
 next month In hopes of obstructing the
 movement of U.S. troops to Vietnam.  The
 article went on to say, "He mentioned the
 rumor as he announced that seven Senators
 have decided to cosponsor his bill to make
 obstruction of troop or military material
 movements a Federal crime worth up to 10
 years in prison."
 After reading this short, and seemingly
 unimportant news item, I had to stop for a
 moment and reflect on some of the develop-
 ments that have. occurred in the United
 States in these past weeks and months.
 Recently a captain in the Air Force, who
 after much soul searching, decided he should
 extend his tour of duty in Vietnam because
 he believed so much in the cause of the Viet-
 namese people in the Republic of Vietnam.
 This man felt he had not the right to neg-
 lect "his duty" as an American.  Shortly
 thereafter, this man lost his life in action
 while on a routine flight.
 During a period of time when I am sure
 his wife was overwhelmed with grief, having
 to look forward to a bleak future and the
 responsibility of raising their children alone,
 this woman received numerous phone calls,
 letters, and messages from people far and
 near.   These  people  threatened,  accused,
 teased, and harassed this woman because
 her husband. "had no business" in Vietnam,
 and because he "mettled."
 Can any person ask more from a man than
 to give his life for a cause in which he be-
 lieves so deeply? Is there anyone who could
 possibly expect more than for a man to
 offer his life, and the consequences of losing;

 a population of about 1,250,000 and is eco-
 nomically depressed.
 When Panama demanded a new  treaty
 covering the canal, Snother nation Might
 have used its military u'id other powers to
 trample the isthmus nation.   The United
 States is too big hn nrin~+r.: t;, take violent
 action against a tiny country. It agreed
 to negotiate.
 While the terms of a new pact are not
 in writing, the United States has agreed to
 give Panama it share in management and
 profits.   We will also  recognize Panama's
 sovereignty over the Canal Zone, including
 the canal, leased to the United States.
 It may be said that we are looking ahead
 to the construction of another canal in the
 narrow     strip  of  land linking  North  and
 South America and friendly :relations with
 Panama will make such a project possible.
 Certainly the general terms announced by
 President Johnson will make lease and other
 terms easier to reach.   There is both good
 business and good international diplomacy,
 as well as a large degree of fairness, in our
 agreement to scrap the canal treaty dictated
 by us some 62 years ago.
 The decision to negotiate should improve
 our image in all of Latin America, where
 Fidel  Castro  and  other  communistic  in-
 fluences are trying to undermine us.                                                                                                                                         We
 have long preached that we will not use
 our power or influence in any form to take
 advantage of a neighbor or any friendly
 nation.    We have proved our position many
 times.  We have both proved and improved
 it in Panama.
 It?  I for one have only the highest ad-      Many thousands of men live with only the

 These so-called peaceniks with their beetle

 shades, and all their other trademarks, and
 the Ivy-leaguers who apparently have noth-

 Cronkite's question, "What can we do to

 against our cause In Vietnam; more thou-

 of other demonstrations and sit-ins all across
 the country, many of which never even reach
 the ears of our men in Vietnam, have a de-
 moralizing effect on. our men in that country
 to say the least.
 There is not one, single man in Vietnam
 today that is looking for any medals.  No
 one Is seeking fame or fortune.  Each man
 knows there Is a tremendous job to be done
 and he is there to do his own small part
 in contributing to its successful completion.
 These men are not asking for any special
 privileges, nor are they receiving them.  Our
 men in Vietnam today are suffering many
 hardships and inconveniences not unlike
 those that were experienced by our fighting
 men in the Second World War, and I{orean

 SUPPORT GROWS FOR THE CHIL-
 DREN'S ASPIRIN AMENDMENT OF
 1965
 Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, sup-
 port is rapidly growing for S. 2404, the
 children's aspirin amendment of 1965,
 which I introduced on August 12 of this
 year.
 The purpose of this. bill is to prevent
 the all too frequent loss of children's
 lives which occurs through self-admin-
 istered overdoses of baby aspirin.  The
 legislation which  I have introduced
 would require that baby aspirin be pack-
 aged in containers of not more than 25
 tablets.
 I am most hopeful that the Senate
 Labor and Public Welfare Committee
 will hold hearings on this bill early in
 1966.
 I have received many letters endorsing
 the children's aspirin amendment, from
 distinguished members of the medical
 profession as well as concerned parents.
 Articles in newspapers, magazines, and
 medical journals evidence the great in-
 terest in this legislation.
 I ask unanimous consent that several
 of these articles, as well as extracts from
 some of the many letters which I have re-
 ceived on this subject, may be printed at
 this point in the RECORD.  I also ask
 unanimous consent that a resolution
 adopted at the annual convention of the
 New Jersey Pharmaceutical Association
 be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE J   October 15, 1965
 There were no moderate forces on either
 the rebel or antirebel side with the will and
 the capacity to offer effective resistance to
 them.  Indeed, from the dissolution of the
 Molina Urena regime on April 27 until Col-
 onel Caamano formed his regime on May 3
 there was no identifiable leadership on the
 rebel side other than that of the Commu-
 vs
 Next, it is said that the United States over-
 looked the fact that reform movements are
 likely to attract Communist support; that
 the United States failed to perceive that if
 it is automatically to oppose any reform
 movement that Communists adhere to, it is
 likely to end up opposing every reform move-
 ment and, in the process, make itself a pris-
 oner of reactionaries.
 This theory assumes that an alliance be-
 tween the Communists and the non-Com-
 munists left in a popular front Is an act
 of nature.  This is really not different in
 essence from the Marxian theory that Com-
 munists are in the vanguard of all truly
 revolutionary movements.
 In Western Europe, this theory has been
 proved false.   By and large,  Communists
 have  failed to seize  power  there because
 European reformers were their most deter-
 mined and effective opponents.                             In contrast,
 non-Communist revolutionaries in Eastern
 Europe and elsewhere have formed popular
 fronts with Communists.
 The needs to distinguish between a reform
 movement allied with the Communists and
 a movement dedicated to reform in freedom
 should be emphasized over and over again.
 Indeed, it is precisely the failure to make this
 distinction-the tendency of some to lump
 all "reformers" together and to evaluate them
 solely on the basis of their rhetoric-that
 causes a. great deal of the confusion.
 Many of you will recall de Tocqueville's
 conclusions about the causes of the Reign
 of Terror  which detracted  from  the  real
 achievement of the French Revolution:
 "When we closely study the French Revo-
 lution we                             find that it was conducted  in
 precisely the same spirit as that which gave
 rise to so many books expounding theories
 of government in the abstract.  Our revolu-
 tionaries had the same fondness for broad
 generalizations,   cut-and-dried legislative
 systems, and a pedantic symmetry; the same
 contempt for hard facts; the same taste for
 reshaping Institutions on novel, ingenious,
 original lines; the same desire to reconstruct
 the entire constitution according to the rules
 of logic and a preconceived system instead
 of trying to rectify its faulty parts.   The
 result was nothing short of disastrous; for
 what is a merit in the writer may well be
 a vice in the statesman and the very quali-
 ties which go to make great literature can
 lead to catastrophic revolutions.
 "Even  the  politicians' phraseology was
 borrowed largely from the books they read;
 it was  cluttered up with abstract words,
 gaudy flowers of speech, sonorous cliches,
 and literary turns of phrase."
 Popular fronts do not have as their prin-
 cipal objective the noble purpose of demo-
 cratic reform.  Their principal objective is
 political power. They are often formed by
 those  who  want the  Communist vote  In
 order to get elected  to office. Sometimes
 they are formed because the help of dis-
 ciplined Communists is needed to overthrow
 a government. They are sometimes formed
 by politicians already in power to buy their
 p3ace.  The rationale I have heard is a re-
 vealing one:  "I know they are dangerous.
 But I can control them."  Sometimes this
 estimate proves to be correct.  More often
 it does not.
 As President Kennedy said in his address
 at the Free University of Berlin on June 26,
 1963: "As I said this morning, I am not im-
 VII
 It is also said that our country is not much
 in sympathy with revolution and that our
 Revolution of  1776 was  not much of an
 upheaval compared to the Russian and other
 revolutions.
 Perhaps these words are to be interpreted
 as suggesting that in our revolution the vio-
 lence                                                                                   was confined  largely to the battle-
 fields,  and  that,  consequently,  it                                                                                cannot
 be compared with the number of civilians
 killed under the guillotine  or with  the
 millions who disappeared in the  familiar
 Communist purges.    If so, I fail to see why
 violence itself should be considered a de-
 sirable end.
 If, on the other hand, it is intended to
 say that the basic values of political and
 economic freedom, which were the principal
 motive force of the Revolution of 1776, are
 inferior to others, then there are differences
 in opinion which are indeed significant.
 Our political, economic and social systems
 have produced a greater degree of individual
 freedom, a more even-handed, impartial ad-
 ministration of law, higher levels of income,
 a more equitable distribution of an ever-ris-
 ing national product, more equality of op-
 portunity, more religious freedom, a greater
 appreciation of the value of the spirit and
 of the dignity of man, than has been here-
 tofore achieved by any nation in history.
 Our revolution did not start and end in
 1776.  It is a continuing phenomenon.  The
 frontiers of opportunity, of knowledge, of
 health, of social justice and economic and
 political progress in our land are being ex-
 panded still further in President Johnson's
 program for the Great Society.
 Certainly if one  compares  the  achieve-
 ments of our system with that of others, we
 have no need to be apologetic or defensive.
 On the contrary, we can take great pride in
 our accomplishments and in our determina-
 tion for even greater improvement in the
 future.
 a speech the other day from the floor of
 the Senate in which I said that the Sen-
 ate and the House of Representatives are
 going to adjourn in spite of my protest
 in regard to adjourning sine die while
 our Americans boys are dying in South
 Vietnam.  This is a course of action
 which, in my judgment, cannot be jus-
 tifled by any Member of Congress. When
 the motion for sine die resolution is be-
 fore the Senate, the senior Senator from
 Oregon will go on record in opposition to
 the resolution.
 In my judgment, we cannot justify ad-
 journing Congress so long as American
 boys are being killed in an unconstitu-
 tional war in South Vietnam.  People
 have a right to have the Congress in ses-
 sion to maintain a check upon the execu-
 tive branch of government.
 Congress had better start checking, in
 spite of all the interpretations being given
 under so-called polls. I am like so many
 with whom I have talked; I am still wait-
 ing to meet the first person who has been
 polled; but somebody must be polled.
 The reliance of this administration
 upon polls is an act of whistling by
 graveyards.  The sad thing is that it is
 filling the graveyard, by the unnecessary
 killing in South Vietnam, not only of
 Americans, but of Asians.
 I am at work on a speech entitled "The
 Crucifixion of the Teachings of Christ in
 South Vietnam." I am always interested
 in Christians trying to rationalize, on
 moral grounds, this unconstitutional, il-
 legal war in South Vietnam.
 But, Mr. President, come next Janu-
 ary, if the State Department does not
 clarify its position in regard to military
 intervention in Latin America, this chair-
 man will conduct hearings for whatever
 length of time is necessary. to make the
 record replete with the facts with re-
 gard to what our clear national law ob-
 ligation is under the treaties to which I-
 have referred.
 I ask unanimous consent that there
 be printed in the Record an article by
 Mr. Emil Mazey, international secretary-
 treasurer, United Auto Workers, entitled
 "South Vietnam Leaders No Better Than
 Reds-L.B.J. Backed Military Dictator in
 Dominica."
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 SOUTH VIET LEADERS No BETTER THAN REDS-
 L.B.J. BACKED MILITARY DICTATOR IN DOMI-

 (By  Emil  Mazey,  International  Secretary-
 Treasurer, United Auto Workers)
 Some of the problems that currently face
 the people of our world today are the after-
 math of struggles for independence on the
 part of colonial peoples.  The difficulty in
 South Vietnam today is a typical example of
 what I have reference to.
 The people of Vietnam sought their inde-
 pendence from French domination and final-
 ly defeated the French in 19.54.  The 1954
 struggle was terminated by the signing of
 the Geneva Conference .accord which among
 other things, accepted the sound principle
 of  self-determination  and stipulated  that
 free elections would be held In 1956 to re-
 unite the country.

 pressed by the opportunities open to popu-
 lar fronts throughout the world.  I do- not
 believe that any Democrat can successfully
 ride that tiger,"
 But the point I wish to make is that Com-
 munist  participation  is  not  necessary  in
 order to carry out reforms.  There are sev-
 eral governments I can think of which are
 not allied with Communists and which are
 doing a pretty good job of reform.  I am not
 conscious that this great country of ours has,
 in cooperating with these and other coun-
 tries, become a prisoner of any group.
 Moreover, popular fronts serve Communist
 ends.   Communists gain from them a re-
 spectability they do not deserve.  They use
 this respectability to infiltrate their partisans
 into  the  educational  system, organized
 worker and farm groups, the mass media and,
 of course, the government itself.  In partici-
 pating in popular fronts, politicians usually
 have in mind a short-term, personal, political,
 selfish gain.  On the other hand, Commu-
 nists are content to work today in order to
 prepare for tomorrow.
 We do not really have to choose between
 reaction and leftist extremism.  There is a
 large and growing number of people in Latin
 America dedicated to rapid and far-reaching
 reform.  New political movements, organized
 on an institutional rather than a personal-
 ized base, give promise of organizing and
 leading those who so desperately want to
 build modern societies,  The Latin American
 military contain in their ranks many able
 and dedicated men who do not deserve to be
 smeared with the brush that ought to be
 reserved for the few.  The church is provid-
 ing leadership In many areas of social prog-
 ress. - Many of the younger men from all
 sectors of society are conscious of the need
 for change and are helping to promote it.
 Organized labor is growing in strength and
 could be a powerful influence for progress.

 October 15, 99 65         CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 The present civil war in South Vietnam be-
 gan in 1956 when President Diem, with the
 concurrence of the Eisenhower administra-
 tion, refused to hold elections.
 The reasoning of Diem and the reasoning
 of the Eisenhower administration was that
 elections would result in the Communists
 winning control of the government.
 This violation of the Geneva Conference
 accord is responsible for the civil war and
 conflict taking place in South Vietnam to-
 day.
 President Lyndon Johnson inherited a war
 which, I am sure, he doesn't want. President
 Johnson has repeatedly stated that we are in
 Vietnam to maintain freedom, liberty and
 democracy and the right of the South Viet-
 nam to choose their own political path.
 I disagree completely with President John-
 son on this evaluation. There is no demo-
 cracy in South Vietnam,  There is no free-
 dom in South Vietnam.  There is no liberty
 in South Vietnam.
 There is no representative government in
 South Vietnam. The people have not chosen
 their national leaders or their regional lead-
 ers.
 There is no free trade union movement in
 South Vietnam.
 . In my opinion, the war in Vietnam is being
 fought to bolster and maintain an oppressive
 military dictatorship.  The war is not being
 fought to extend freedom and democracy.
 The government of South Vietnam does not
 have the confidence of the people and is to-
 tally and completely unstable.
 We have seen the perpetual circus in Saigon
 in one clique of military leaders fighting to
 replace another military clique for political
 control of Vietnam.
 This game of musical chairs to see who is
 going to control South Vietnam, apparently
 has the blessing and full financial support of
 our Government because we have endorsed
 and embraced each new punk dictator who
 has gained power.
 President Johnson is very thin-skinned
 about any criticism of his policy of South
 Vietnam.
 He has discouraged free discussion of his
 policies and has attempted to justify his
 policies on the ground that he and his ad-
 visers, have information not available to the
 average citizen, and therefore, we must have
 faith in his judgment and blindly follow
 and endorse his policies.
 Constructve  criticism  is  equated  with
 treason-those who oppose escalating the
 war are called appeasers-citizens calling for
 a negotiated peace have been charged with
 being soft on communism.
 Despite the fact that we have a large mili-
 tary force and a large body of CIA agents
 in south Vietnam, every tim~ry
 coup takes place, spokesmen for our Govern-
 ment announced they were surprised by the
 overthrow of one regime by another.,
 If our Government truly understood what
 was happening in Vietnam, I suggest we
 would not be surprised by developments
 there.
 I believe that the President of the United
 States is making a serious mistake in esca-
 lating the war in South Vietnam by the
 attacks on North Vietnam.  This policy is
 really the Goldwater policy and has the full
 support of the leadership of the Republican
 Party.
 I suggest that President Johnson not take
 too much comfort in the support he is re-
 ceiving from Goldwater and DiRxsEN be-
 cause in 1966 and 1968, the South-Vietnam
 war will become the major political issue
 and will be referred to as the Johnson war
 by the Republicans currently urging and
 egging President Johnson on to escalate the
 war.
 I do not believe the struggle in south
 Vietnam can be won by negative anticom-
 munism,  It should be obvious to everyone
 that the South Vietnamese people have no
 confidence in their government because two-
 thirds of South Vietnam is already under the
 control of the Vietcong.
 Frankly, the South Vietnamese have not
 been given anything to fight for.  Fighting
 to maintain the status quo is not good
 enough.
 The South Vietnamese find little difference
 between Communist dictatorship or a mili-
 tary dictatorship over their country.  I con-
 fess I see no difference between Communist
 dictatorship and a military dictatorship. '
 The people of South Vietnam look upon
 American forces  as a replacement to the
 French forces they kicked out in 1954.
 The people in South Vietnam must be
 given an effective alternative to communism
 or to a military dictatorship.
 I suggest that the alternative ought to be
 a  democratic  government chosen by the
 people with a program of land reform and
 other reforms that can raise the living stand-
 ards and improve the security of the people.
 I know that there are no easy answers to
 resolve the Vietnamese problem. Among the
 possible answers are the following:
 1. We ought to seek the implementation of
 the 1954 Geneva Conference accord.   The
 nations that brought about the agreement
 in Vietnam originally ought to be called into
 session to seek a solution to the present
 problem.
 2. We ought to consider giving the United
 Nations an opportunity of solving the Viet-
 nam crisis.   Placing Vietnam under  U.N.
 trusteeship for a period of time and sub-
 sequently implementing the Geneva Con-
 ference accord of 1954, may be one way to
 solve this dilemma,   I believe the recent
 statements of President Johnson to the effect
 that he is willing to have unconditional talks
 to bring about a negotiated solution to the
 Vietnamese problem, is good.    However, I
 believe that the President is making a mis-
 take in trying to bring about these negotia-
 tions through the escalation of the war.
 I believe that our Government needs to re-
 evaluate. our entire foreign policy position.
 It should be clear to all of us that our Gov-
 ernment cannot unilaterally act as a world
 police force and cannot by itself solve the
 many problems that the years of colonialism
 on the part of Great Britain, France, and
 Belgium created.
 Our Government seems to favor military
 dictatorship to democracy.  I am alarmed
 and  sickened  at the  quickness in which
 President Johnson moved 30,000 marines into
 the Dominican Republic to bolster and main-
 tain a military dictatorship that came into
 power by overthrowing the only freely elected
 government in the Dominican Republic in
 the past 30 years.
 Our Government gave quick recognition to
 the military dictatorship which replaced the
 democratically  elected  government in  the
 Dominican Republic in 1963.
 In  1965,  when  the     democratic  forces
 attempted  to   overthrow   the    military
 dictatorship, our Government finds itself on
 the side of the military dictatorship again.
 Some 30 years ago, United States marines
 moved into the Dominican Republic and
 placed  Trujillo, the  military  dictator, in
 power.  We must raise our voices in protest
 to see that history doesn't repeat itself.
 I want to commend Senator WAYNE MORSE
 for having the courage and the intestinal
 fortitude to criticize our Government on
 foreign policy and on other matters when he
 believes the Government to be wrong.  I be-
 lieve that the best way to support President
 Johnson is not to rubber stamp his every act,
 but to oppose him constructively when we
 believe that his policies are in error.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, he is not
 the only labor leader who has diverted
 from the propaganda line of most of the
 labor leaders of this Country who are
 26189
 purportedly  in  support  of war  in
 Vietnam.
 I am glad that there are some labor
 leaders who recognize the moral princi-
 ples involved in connection with the
 uncalled-for war in South Vietnam; who
 recognize that to take the position of
 the senior Senator from Oregon does not
 mean that we get out of South Vietnam,
 but that we follow an international law
 procedure course of action that will bring
 others in through the United Nations.
 I am glad also that there are labor
 leaders who recognize that no weight
 can be given to rationalizing our unfor-
 tunate course of action in South Viet-
 nam by what is called the economic bene-
 fits to certain industries in this country
 connected with the war effort.
 I am glad that we have labor leaders
 such as Emil Mazie, who is willing to
 stand up and be counted, even though the
 line of the American labor movement
 today, unfortunately, is to support our
 outlawry in South Vietnam.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that there also be printed in the
 RECORD at this point an editorial from
 the St. Louis Post-Dispatch entitled
 "Facts in the Far East."
 "
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 FACTS IN THE FAR EAST
 A general review of tensions in Asia now
 seems likely to feature the current session
 of the United Nations General Assembly, and
 it is long overdue.  The Assembly has agreed
 to  debate                                                                 the question  of  seating  Com-
 munist China.                                                                                                               Vietnam has been brought
 into the picture by U.S. Ambassador Gold-
 berg and by Soviet Foreign Minister Grom-
 yko.
 There is in reality no way to separate one
 Asian problem from  another.   There will
 be no permanent peace in Vietnam without
 the concurrence of China.  The presence of
 China  broods  over the      Indian-Pakistani
 quarrel.   Until the U.N. comes to. grips with
 the reality of China,  discussion of Asian
 problems is bound to appear peripheral.
 This being so, it was disappointing that
 Mr. Goldberg, in his speech to the Assem-
 bly, should have reiterated doctrinaire U.S.
 antagonism to the mainland regime; partic-
 ularly that he should have associated North
 Vietnam and China in criticizing those who
 allegedly  do  not  "leave  their  neighbors
 alone." The relationship between Peiping
 and Hanoi is a subtle one and a more con-
 structive statement would have been direct-
 ed toward identifying the components.
 The United States can make a case of
 course, for opposing the admission of China.
 It has a treaty with the Chiang Kai-shek re-
 gime on Formosa, which holds one of the
 five  permanent  Security  Council  seats.
 China has acted in a belligerent fashion to-
 ward all the major nations.  It has shown
 no desire to become a U.N. member.
 But much of this is beside the point. The
 point is not whether China is truculent, or
 whether it wants admission, but whether
 the peace of the world would be more secure
 with China in the U.N. or outside of it.  In
 other words, the point is not whether China
 would be gratified by "shooting its way" into
 the U.N., but whether the 117 nations would
 benefit by its presence.
 In this connection there is merit in a
 sort of interim proposal by Secretary Gen-
 eral U Thant that China be represented at
 V.N. headquarters.  He told the Assembly:
 "I have no doubt that the true interest
 of peace would be better served if nonmem-
 ber states were to be encouraged to main-

 opinion which are so uniquely concentrated
 in the organization."
 The problem is urgent.. The Vietnam war
 cries for settlement; so does the quarrel be-
 tween India and Pakistan.  These countries
 are on China's border.  China is developing
 -an. atomic capability;  can there be  any
 profitable conference on nuclear controls, or
 any viable agreement, without its participa-
 tion?  Also, suppose China led a move to
 forma rival international organization? In-
 donesia, which has withdrawn from the U.N.
 has made such a suggestion.
 A thoroughgoing debate in the U.N. would
 ventilate this whole situation, and would, we
 hope, lead to fresh approaches to the com-
 plex problems of Asia.
 Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, this is a
 great editorial from a great newspaper.
 The St. Louis Post-Dispatch, from the
 beginning of our unfortunate course of
 action in South Vietnam, from the very
 beginning of the United States starting
 its violation of the Geneva accords back
 in 1954, from the very beginning of our
 setting up of our tyrannical puppet in
 South Vietnam, Dien, and one puppet
 after another, as one after another fell
 from grace in South Vietnam, has car-
 ried on a courageous editorial policy of
 constructive criticism against foreign
 policy of the United States, vis-a-vis
 South Vietnam.
 Not very often is such courage com-
 mended in periods of hysteria in this
 country-and we are in a period of hys-
 teria. I commend the editors of the St.
 Louis Post-Dispatch not only for this
 editorial, but also for the many preced-
 ing editorials they have published seek-
 ing to warn the American people that
 our foreign policy in southeast Asia will
 eventually cause us to lose all support
 In southeast Asia. No matter how many
 years are required, yve shall eventually be
 driven out of Asia. The lesson we have
 to learn has already been learned by
 the French, the Dutch, the Belgians, and
 the British.
 The tyrants whom we are supporting
 in South Vietnam have never provided
 an hour of freedom in South Vietnam
 since they have taken over power; yet
 they have been backed, financed, and
 militarized by the United States. I know
 from reading recent news 'dispatches
 that those puppets of ours are now try-
 ing to tell us that we must not give con-
 sideration to any negotiated settlement
 of the war. Of course, we are doing most
 of the fighting now.  We have already
 demonstrated that the Vietnamese army
 and military establishment of 500,000 to
 750,000 cannot whip the hard core Viet-
 cong military establishment of between
 35,000 and 60,000.  It is necessary for
 the United States to go on in and do the
 job for the South Vietnamese. We can
 do the job.  We can win every military
 engagement. The Vietcong cannot begin
 to meet American force.  The Vietcong
 lack firepower and materiel; the Viet-
 cong have no air force.
 I have said many times that all we
 are doing, now that we have gone into
 Vietnam with our military might, is to
 shoot fish in a barrel, for the Vietcong
 can best be described in that war as
 shooting fish in a barrel.
 It is impossible for the Vietcong to
 resist the military power of our great
 country.  That is what we should ex-
 pect.  You and I, Mr. President, have
 not. sat here for years, voting billions of
 dollars for the defense of this country,
 without knowing that the United States
 has the military might to mop up and
 wipe out any force such as the Vietcong.
 But that will not win the peace. That
 will only win the war-if we want to call
 it winning a war. What weare doing in
 Vietnam will leave a heritage of hatred
 and revenge against the United States
 that will last for hundreds of years.
 Also, it will do something to qur na-
 tional morality.  Do not tell me that
 there is no cause-to-effect relationship
 between the lack of morality of our for-
 eign policy and the moral attitudes of
 the young people of this country. That
 is why I am working on my speech, "The
 Crucifixion of the Teachings of Christ
 in South Vietnam."  I believe that our
 professed religious beliefs should not be
 kept off the floor of the Senate, but
 should influence the action of this body.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed at this point in the
 RECORD a letter entitled "Legalized Mur-
 der," written by Dr. E. J. Fagan, Ma-
 sonic Building, McMinnville, Oreg., and
 published in the Portland Oregonian.
 There being no objection, the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 LEGALIZED MURDER
 To the EDITOR:
 Now that big business, the oil companies,
 airplanes,  steel, and Du Pont  as  well as
 others have taken over the Johnson admin=
 istration look, stock aqd barrel, we can ex-
 pect the Vietnam war to continue for months
 or perhaps years and anyone like our own
 Senator MORSE or Gov. Mark Hatfield who
 speaks against such murder can be expected
 to be slapped down by our leading news-
 papers.
 The Johnson administration wants war and
 that's what they are going to get, because
 it's big business and keeps big operations
 going and a new batch of American million-
 aires will be hatched before it's over with.
 That's why war is now so popular.
 I would not feel right if I didn't speak
 outagainst legalized murder by this or any
 other country and to my way of thinking
 -both Governor Hatfield and Senator MORSE
 are 100 percent right in opposing the Presi-
 dent's escalation of war in Vietnam.  I feel
 sure that there are enough people on the
 mainland of Asia to look after any and all
 problems that may arise in that part of the
 world without intervention of another con-
 tinent.  Minding our own business, I think,
 is never a bad policy.  Let's try it as a nation
 and see if results won't be fruitful.
 DR. E. J. FAGAN.
 MCMINNVILLE.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent to have printed at
 this point in the RECORD a letter entitled
 "We Have Failed," written by Peter S.
 Buck, of Portland, Oreg., and published
 in the Portland Oregonian.  The letter
 deals with our outlawry in southeast
 Asia.
 There being no objection, the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 To the EDrroR:
 I do not sympathize with the Oregonian's
 fear that Senator MORSE Is "weakening the
 unity of purpose the President and the
 majority of Americans wish to convey to the
 aggressors."  It is not the function of a critic
 to create unity behind the policies being
 criticized; if the majority of Americans wish
 to unite behind the President, then they can
 do so, but they have no business requiring
 that dissenters also fall into line so that the
 impression of solidarity may be made more
 perfect.
 On the issue of Vietnam, I see no virtue
 in applauding the President for pressing with
 greater intensity a policy that is not working.
 We have bombed in the north for months
 and  have  steadily  increased  our  military
 power in Vietnam with the result that the
 war has gone just as steadily against us.  We
 have supported the transitory regimes that
 have passed through Saigon and have got,
 for our troubles, a general there who tells a
 British newspaper  he  finds  something    to
 admire in Hitler.  We have stood firm in
 Vietnam, but the opposition has simply gone
 around our war, seeking and finding support
 among  African  and Asian     nations  disen-
 chanted with American. policy.
 As I understand the history of American
 involvement in Vietnam, our original inter-
 vention was based on the assumption that we
 could attain our limited objectives with an
 equally  limited  effort.  This  premise  has
 proved false as the effort required has grown
 out of all proportion to the goals.  I think
 it time that we admit that our undertaking
 in Vietnam has failed and that, by choosing
 to intervene in the first place, we are at least
 partly the creators of our own difficulties.
 Our position in Asia will not be irrevocably
 damaged by Vietnam unless, by following
 futile policy to its bitter conclusion, we show
 that we are determined to have it that way.
 Perhaps Senator MossE's proposals will have
 no greater success, but I do not see how they
 can have less.
 PETER S. BUCK.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent to have printed at
 this point in the RECORD a letter entitled
 "Impossible  Situation,"  written  by
 Eunice E. Wise, of Portland, and pub-
 lished in the Portland Oregonian.                                                                                                                                    The
 letter criticizes our policies in South
 Vietnam.
 There being no objection, the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION
 To the EDrroR:
 Your editorial of August 5 entitled, "Now,
 Impeachment?" reveals that what the whole
 world has long dreaded and feared has come
 to pass; that is, "war by miscalculation."
 And American experts have made the mis-
 calculations.
 The $700 million appropriated in May is
 already spent.   Another $700 million plus
 $1 billion is the minimum thought neces-
 sary to carry the "buildup" to January 1.
 After that nobody knows how much the cost
 will be.
 But the money miscalculation is nothing
 compared with the seriousness of the man-
 power miscalculation.
 Experts maintain that for success in that
 kind of war, there must be a ratio of 10
 Americans to 1 guerrilla.  This is an im-
 possible situation to cope with even if the war
 lasted 40 years  and family planning was
 banned "for the duration."  For there are
 already more than a billion Communists in
 the world and less than 200 million Ameri-
 cans counting every man, woman, and child.
 It would seem that the time has come for
 nations to "learn war no more."'

 There being no objection, the letter

 To the EDITOR:
 Anent  your  recent  editorial  "Now,  Im-
 peachment?"  when  the  lust  for  war                                  has
 fastened itself upon the  land, the word
 "peace" becomes a dirty word and scath-
 ing  denunciation                         is  heaped     upon those
 who espouse it. Carried to the ultimate, in-
 carceration in concentration camps, and, in
 some cases, the firing squad, is their reward.
 If there are any doubts, how many saw, re-.'
 cently, on CBS television, the spectacle of
 several hundred doctors, lawyers, teachers,
 etc., who were brought from their jail cells
 in Saigon to face a row of men sitting in
 judgment upon them?  Their crime: taking
 part in a peace demonstration urging nego-
 tiation looking to a settlement of the war,
 the very same aim to which our President is
 supposed to give favor.  Undoubtedly their
 sentences, when rendered, will be further in-
 carceration and, if the great Hitler-worship-
 ing General Ky's  wishes  are  carried  out,
 death by the firing squad.
 One wonders how long it will be before the
 same insanity prevails in our own country.
 Certainly that condition is aided by those
 who foment hatred against their fellow citi-
 zens whom they scornfully  designate as
 "peaceniks," although among such are many
 good citizens, including our leading scien-
 tists, historians, educators, religionists, and
 many others.
 Such a demeaning appellation and, . fur-
 ther,  likening our interest in reaching  a
 peaceful solution in Vietnam to an "attrac-
 tion like flies to a dead fish," is a gross in-
 sult to many readers of the Oregonian and
 is unworthy editorial comment in a news-

 There being no objection, the letter

 To the EDrroR:

 Oregonian editorials having to do with the
 war in Vietnam.  They may now complain
 of primitive manners as well.
 The abusive dismissal of Senator MORSE
 and his audience as "flies drawn to a dead
 fish," .. peaceniks," etc., is beneath the level
 of civilized discourse. It would seem a mod-
 est and easily satisfied requirement of an
 editorial writer that he approach an issue
 with the minimum respect necessary to un-
 derstand it and that he be capable of ra-
 tional argument.
 WILLIAM H. HALEWOOD.
 Mr. MORSE.                       Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent to have printed at
 this point in the RECORD a letter entitled
 "Man Who Thinks," written by Mrs.
 Lloyd Johnson, of Milwaukie, Oreg., and
 published in the Portland Oregonian.
 There being no objection, the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 MAN WHO THINKS
 To the EDITOR:
 Contrary to the views expressed in your
 editorial of August 5, "Now, Impeachment?"
 those interested in the peace of the world
 are not necessarily fanatical, nor do they
 deserve the ridiculous label peacenik.
 Ours is a war-weary generation.  We can-
 not see that wars accomplish their supposed
 purpose.  Thousands have sacrificed fathers,
 husbands, sons, and other loved ones to these
 insatiable monsters.  The thought of again
 sending loved ones into the grinding teeth
 of a huge war machine is more than grave.
 The people of this country are already
 taxed nearly to the breaking point.  if only
 a portion of -the staggering bill presented an-
 nually to the American people could be di-
 verted to the spreading of the cause of the
 Prince of Peace, soon this old world would
 be a far better place and we need not learn
 war any more.  Haven't we tried the way of
 death long enough?  Why not try the way of
 life?
 As for your attack on WAYNE MORSE: If we
 had a few more rabble rouser leaders with
 the courage of their convictions such as Mr.
 MORSE demonstrates again and again perhaps
 there would be less apathy among the peo-
 ple.                                                                              As long as men in high places allow
 themselves to be swept along with the cur-
 rent instead of standing up for what they
 believe or know to be right, the "What's the
 use?" attitude of the masses will remain.'
 The people of Oregon must feel the need of
 a man who thinks for himself or they would
 not return Mr. MORSE to the Senate time
 MILWAUKEE.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent to have printed at
 this point in the RECORD a letter entitled
 "Shameless Involvement," written by
 Peter A. Griffin, of Salem, Oreg., and
 published in the Portland Oregonian.
 There being no objection, the letter
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 SHAMELESS INVOLVEMENT
 To the EDITOR:
 In your August 5 editorial criticizing Sen-
 ator  MORSE,  you  characteristically  display
 more spleen than reason,  While the use of
 facile epithets such as "peaceniks," "fanati-
 cal spokesman," and "rabble-rousing dema-
 goguery" may enable you better to manipu-
 late public opinion, they add nothing to what
 should be a serious national debate on a
 very grave issue.
 The clear implication of your editorial is
 that Senator MORSE himself advocates im-
 peachment despite a story in the same edi-
 tion of the Oregonian presenting Senator
 MORSE's denial of this very contention.  Your
 own moral bankruptcy blinds you to the fact
 that there are still Americans of sufficient
 conscience to be outraged at and protest the
 wanton and indiscriminate brutalities and
 devastation visited upon  the populace     of
 North and South Vietnam by our former ad-
 visers.  Moreover, those of us who do feel
 that President Johnson has grossly over-
 stepped all admissible legal and moral bounds
 in our shameless involvement in Vietnam are
 neither isolationists nor are words put in our
 mouths by Senator MoasE, although we all
 welcome his courage, concern and support.
 PETER A. GRIFFIN.
 SALEM.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, last sum-
 mer, I said on the floor of the Senate
 that only by a military occupation of
 South Vietnam by the United States
 could the Vietcong be stopped from tak-
 ing- over the country. We are now in the
 process of doing that.  We are making
 this an American war.   We are doing it
 on the theory that we are faced with an-
 other Munich in southeast Asia, and that
 the lessons of history teach us that it is
 better to fight a small war when aggres-
 sion first begins than to wait until it has
 gathered steam, when opposing it will
 mean a third world war.
 The very fact that defenders of admin-
 istration policy put the war in these
 terms is indicative of its understanding
 that the American people do not want
 war, and that the rest of the world does
 not want war.  Increasingly, your mili-
 tary activities are presented, not as an
 end in themselves, but as the means of
 preserving peace.  With each fresh ar-
 rival of more troops, with each new fleet
 unit, and with each buildup in the size
 and activity of the Strategic Air Com-
 mand, we hear that it is all in the name
 of peace.
 When the bombing of North Vietnam
 commenced in the first week of Febru-
 ary, this was not the case. But between
 the first week in February and the first
 week in, April, when President Johnson
 went to Johns Hopkins University to
 talk for the first time about negotiations,
 it had become evident that the American
 people were not satisfied with a purely
 military policy toward southeast Asia.
 So it is vital to our policy to determine
 how much our military activity is con-
 tributing to a peaceful settlement.
 Some obvious questions come quickly
 to mind. Who is the aggressor in Viet-
 nam that is to be compared to Hitler's
 Germany?  We say we are bombing
 North Vietnam to make her more amen-
 able to negotiating; but our Secretary of
 State maintains that we are going to
 make Red China leave her neighbors
 alone.  His speech of October 5 to the
 United Press International Editors and
 Publishers Conference, referred to China
 as the major threat to world peace, al-
 though-Red China has not a man fight-
 ing in Vietnam, and has made available
 very little material support to the Viet-
 cong.
 Are we to consider, then, that North
 Vietnam, whom we are bombing around
 the clock, is the aggressor who must be
 stopped now, or are we to consider China,
 who is not physically involved in the cur-
 rent war at all, as the aggressor?
 Another possibility is that communism
 per se is what the Secretary of State
 really has in mind.  But are the objec-
 tives of Communist Ho Chi Minh the
 same as the objectives of Communist
 Mao Tse-tung?  The Secretary of State
 is the first man who will tell us that the
 communism of the Soviet Union, Poland,
 Rumania, Yugoslavia, and China are all
 differentiated by their national interests
 and must not be lumped together by
 American policy. In fact, it is the policy
 of the administration to foment the
 breakup of the Communist bloc by deal-
 ing with each country in it as a totally
 different entity from its neighbors, and
 to encourage each of them to loosen its
 ties with the other.    -
 Is this a sound policy for Eastern Eu-
 rope only?  Or are not the same na-
 tionalisms - that make the Communist
 bloc of Eastern Europe vulnerable to be
 found equally in Asia?
 Traditionally, there has been little to -

 china to China. Historically, there has
 been animosity between them. In fact,
 we are not using Chiang Kai-shek's Chi-
 nese soldiers from Taiwan in large part
 because they are regarded as unaccepta-
 ble allies to the people of South Vietnam.
 There are other reasons, too, but that is
 one of them. Yet the same historic ani-
 mosities also prevail north of the 17th
 parallel. The inhabitants of North Viet-
 nam have the same historic reasons for
 not wishing to be drawn too closely to
 mainland China.
 We have capitalized on these historic
 attitudes in the case of the Balkans vis-
 a-vis the Soviet Union.  We have flown
 in the face of them in the case of North
 Vietnam and Red China.
 We have compelled North Vietnam to
 seek allies wherever she can find them.
 We say she is in a different category and
 we are bombing her because she has
 transgressed against the Geneva Accords
 of 1954. But we are not a party to them,
 nor is South Vietnam, and our transgres-
 sions against the same Accords are a
 matter of record with the International
 Control Commission, which found North
 Vietnam had violated them. The Inter-
 national Control Commission was cre-
 ated by the Geneva Accords to Investi-
 gate complaints of violations,  It Its
 first published report in 1957, It found
 North Vietnam had violated them, and
 that South Vietnam had violated them
 through Its military aid program from
 the United States.  That was in 1957.
 In 1955, we had endorsed the refusal of
 South Vietnam to proceed with elections
 throughout the whole of Vietnam, elec-
 tions specifically provided for in the
 Accords.
 So the issue of who first violated the
 Geneva Accords is scarcely one that the
 United Statescan stand on as justifica-
 tion for our policy.  We never mention
 our violations when we claim that North
 Vietnam began Infiltrating assistance
 into the south in 1959. We had already
 sent in thousands of soldiers.
 Nor is there any reason to assume
 that the United States has any sanction
 to enforce an agreement to which we are
 not a signatory. I do not know of any of
 the Munich analogies that maintain the
 United States should, alone, have sent
 troops to Czechoslovakia to fight the
 Germans in 1938. Oh, no; it Is said that
 the  free  world  should have  united
 against Hitler to stop his aggression.
 But there is no free world unity in South
 Vietnam.   It is strictly a GI operation,
 financed by Uncle Sam. The other flags
 represented in Vietnam represent, as I
 have said before, little more than flag-
 poles.         We have symbols, some of them
 sent only under very great diplomatic
 pressure from the United States. But we
 have very little tangible help for carry-
 ing out our policy in Vietnam.
 The Munich analogy breaks down at
 several places for the reason that we
 are not concerned so much with what
 happens to other countries in Asia as
 we are with our concept of our own
 American security Interests.
 We believe that the string of American
 bases and American-supported coun-
 tries along the western shores of the
 Pacific would be threatened by the loss
 of South Vietnam.  That is why we are
 fighting there.  That is why we have
 exalted an exchange of letters between
 President Eisenhower and the late un-
 lamented President Diem of Vietnam
 into a sacred national promise that pre-
 tends President Diem never promised us
 anything.  President Eisenhower upset
 some of our officials when he said re-
 cently that the agreement with Diem
 went no further than a pledge of goods-
 foreign aid-not direct military support.
 But all that was hushed up when a fur-
 ther expression of support for our pres-
 ent policy was elicited from President
 Eisenhower, irrespective of what was in`
 his letter.
 It is the effort to maintain an Amer-
 ican-oriented government in South Viet-
 nam that is the reason for our war effort
 there.  We see it as a vital link in the
 containment policy toward Communist
 China.  This containment runs from
 South Korea, to Japan, to Okinawa, to
 Taiwan, the Philippines, South Vietnam,
 Thailand, India, and Pakistan.
 PROSPECTS FOR PEACE THROUGH WA$
 One of the criticism leveled at those
 of its who have opposed the war in Viet-
 nam is that we have no alternative that
 will get the American Army out and still
 guarantee that the Communists will not
 take over.
 That is quite true.  We have no guar-
 anteed alternative. But neither does the
 administration have any plan for getting,
 the United States out without having
 the Communists take over. So far, their
 plan calls only for an indefinite U.S.
 occupation of South Vietnam to prevent
 the Vietcong from taking it over whereas
 we propose a procedure of - seeking to
 bring many other nations in, not to make
 war, but to keep the peace, just as the
 United States keeps the peace on the
 Gaza Strip and in Cyprus, just as the
 United Nations moved in the other day
 to take over jurisdiction between Pakis-
 tan and India, and just as the United
 Nations moved into the Congo and moved
 the Russian military forces that had al-
 ready started to infiltrate the Congo out
 of the Congo. That is our program and
 our recommendation.
 The very best that can be expected
 from administration policy Is that the
 other side will not escalate the war fur-
 ther than we choose to escalate it. Yet
 the longer the war drags on, the more
 likelihood there is that China or the
 Soviet Union will find that their na-
 tional security interests require them to
 play a further role in the war.  The
 bickering and border warfare over Kash-
 mir dragged on for 18 years and It finally
 erupted into outright war. The Vietnam
 war could well be the same smoldering
 brushfire that can ignite much of the
 world. The administration has no plans
 and no means for ending it, only for
 continuing it. And it has no guarantee
 that Red China will not come in; it has
 no guarantee that the Soviet Union will
 not aid North Vietnam on a truly mas-
 sive scale that could lead us into a con-
 frontation with the Soviet Union.
 There is no Question but that the over-
 whelming military power of the United
 States can prevent South Vietnam from
 falling to the Vietcong.  But we have
 already proved that we cannot win a
 guerrilla war through our South Viet-
 namese proxies. We can only cope with
 guerrilla war by making it a conventional
 war, fought with the Strategic Air Com-
 mand and the latest word in airborne,
 mobile operations by our professional
 Army.
 The men who call themselves a govern-
 ment in Saigon are anxious that there
 not be any negotiations, and have pro-
 tested the American offer to negotiate
 unconditionally. That is to be expected.
 General Ky and his associates have no
 claim to power or authority other than
 through the American war effort. ? If the
 American war effort in South Vietnam
 disappeared tomorrow, General Ky would
 disappear, too, with all of his' tyrannical
 military associates.  We created them,
 we support them, and maintain them in
 office. And we do it to keep South Viet-
 nam in the war.
 If the war were ended, these military
 flunkies, and their political cohorts,
 would lose their reason for existence. So
 they will do what they can to keep the
 war going and to keep American military
 power on their scene.
 I am greatly disappointed that the ad-
 ministration has not taken issue pub-
 licity with South Vietnam's stated objec-
 tions to negotiations.
 it is very discouraging. I say to Presi-
 dent Johnson and to the Ambassador:
 "You are going to find out that you can-
 not reconcile General Ky's Pronounce-
 ments In opposition to negotiations with
 your promises that you are going to do
 everything you can to  bring about
 negotiations."
 President Johnson should put the pup-
 pet in his place in South Vietnam. The
 Objections stated by these puppets were
 stated publicly, as a rebuke to the Amer-
 ican position that we are willing to
 undertake negotiations unconditionally.
 These people in Saigon should not be
 permitted to speak for the United Staes
 on this matter. If they become the tall
 that wags the dog, the American people
 can expect to continue fighting their war
 for them forever, beside supporting them
 with a million dollars worth of goods
 every day.
 President Johnson said during the
 election campaign of 1964 that to send
 large American forces into Vietnam
 would be to fight a war that Asians
 should be fighting for themselves. That
 is what he has now done. The question
 is whether we are going to do their fight-
 ing for them on their terms or on ours,
 and the President has the obligation to
 make clear to the American :people that
 it is our Government that decides when
 we fight and when we negotiate, pot Gen-
 eral Ky.
 IS CONTAINMENT OF CHINA U.S. OBJECTIVE?
 A few minutes ago I spoke of contain-
 ment of China as the basis for our policy
 in Vietnam.  This, too, is 1L slogan that
 needs analysis. Will what worked with
 the Soviet Union automatically work
 with China, and are the condtlions that
 made the first a reasonable possibility
 present in Asia?
 The most serious difference' Is the ab-
 sence of the large and potentially strong
 nations of Asia from our containment

 I say today, as I have said in the past,
 that we have neither the manpower nor
 the economic resources to police Asia.
 I ask unanimous consent to have
 printed at the conclusion of these re-
 marks a wise analysis of our outlook in
 Vietnam as written by Walter Lippmann
 in his column which appeared in the
 Washington Post on September 30.  In
 it, he points out the inconclusiveness of
 our military occupation of South Viet-
 nam, and raises the same question I have
 raised in these remarks here and in
 speeches throughout the country in re-
 cent days, which is to ask how the ad-
 ministration and its Pentagon architects
 of Vietnam policy plan to achieve peace
 in Vietnam by making war?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 (See exhibit 1.)
 Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, Mr. Lipp-
 mann uses the figure of speech in this
 column, referring to our policy, as a
 policy of punching water.
 I care not what the descriptive terms;
 it is the status of posture in South Viet-
 nam that concerns me. I would like to
 change the status from warmaking to
 peacekeeping.  I would like to change
 our image from an ugly one of hypocrisy,
 outlawry, illegality, from one of substi-
 tuting the jungle law of the claw, for our
 professed ideal of supporting the rule
 of law. That is my plea. I make it over
 and over.
 I shall continue to make it over and
 over and from coast to coast, so long as
 my country does not declare war, so long
 as many Americans, and many Senators
 and Representatives do not live up to
 their constitutional trusts, oaths, and
 obligations.
 I repeat that every Senator who votes
 to give to the President the power to
 make war without a declaration of war
 Violates his oath of office, for he swore to
 uphold the Constitution.  The Constitu-
 tion vests no power In the President to
 make war in the absence of a declara-
 tion of war, except for that short inter-
 val of time that it takes the President to
 come to a joint session of Congress and
 recommend a declaration of war in a war
 message.  The Congress then decides
 whether or not they shall vote in favor
 of that declaration.
 If the President should come up to-
 morrow with a such proposed declara-
 tion, I would vote against it, for, in my
 judgment, the United States cannot
 justify making war in Asia or declaring
 war in Asia until it first exhausts its
 treaty obligations.
 We stand in open, wanton, and deliber-
 ate violation of our treaty obligation.
 We are writing a shameful chapter in
 American history by our course of action
 in Asia.
 I know that if war is declared it will
 become my clear patriotic duty as a U.S.
 Senator to do everything I can to suc-
 cessfully prosecute that war and help to
 get it over with as quickly as possible,
 and at the same time to do everything
 I can to try to convince the leadership
 of my Government to get back inside the
 framework of international law.
 No. 193-13
 Approved For Release 2003/10/14: CIA-RDP67BOO446R000300140007-7
 I made this long speech today because
 tomorrow in various parts of the country
 various groups of varied political com-
 plexion are going to protest America's in-
 volvement in war in Vietnam.
 I certainly do not-endorse all the views
 and the conduct that may be taken by
 some of those groups. Neither do I en-
 dorse the McCarthyism of the super-
 patriots and shocking rightists in this
 country who are already charging those
 who tomorrow will protest outlawry of
 the United States in Asia as being trai-
 tors.
 Short of a declaration of war what is
 needed in this country is the protests
 of millions of Americans against the pol-
 icy of their Government in Asia.
 What is needed in America, short of
 a declaration of war, is the tramp, tramp,
 tramp of marching feet in the commu-
 nities of America, by the thousands of
 communities, of free people protesting;
 nonviolent demonstrations against the
 course of action of the United States in
 violation of both the Constitution and
 our treaty obligations.
 Mr. President, there are those who
 would silence those of us who are there
 to protest the outlawry of our Govern-
 ment.  There are those, even found in
 this body, who believe some sort of
 censorship ought to be placed on free
 men who practice their freedom by pro-
 testing the inexcusable foreign policy of
 the Johnson administration.
 I thank my God that there are in this
 country thousands of people who will be
 heard from tomorrow and in the weeks
 and months ahead and who will not be
 cowed into submission by the intolerant
 bigots of America who believe that be-
 cause our country is on an illegal course
 of action, we must support its illegality:
 I shall never do that so long as I believe
 there is any hope of getting my country
 to change its course of action, get back
 into the framework of international law,
 and stand for the substitution of the rule
 of law for its jungle law in South Viet-
 nam.
 If the unhappy hour arrives when
 Congress passes a declaration of war,
 the senior Senator. from Oregon will say
 to the American people that we must
 support our constitutional system, be-
 cause our freedom is dependent upon
 its implementation.  But our freedom
 is not dependent upon the implementa-
 tion of unconstitutionalism, and this ad-
 ministration is following an unconstitu-
 tional course, short of a declaration of
 war in southeast Asia.
 So I shall be back next week, and I
 shall speak again and again and again
 for peace. I shall continue to plead un-
 til there is a declaration of war. I shall
 continue to plead that my country change
 its course of action. I again can upon my
 President and upon the Secretary of
 State to send forthwith to Ambassador
 Goldberg, at the United Nations, a for-
 mal request that he submit the necessary
 formal resolution to the Security Council
 calling upon the Council to take full and
 complete jurisdiction over the threat to
 the peace of the world in South Vietnam.
 If that resolution is vetoed, I shall then
 26195
 call upon my President and the Secretary
 of State and the American Ambassador to
 the United Nations to proceed under the
 procedures of the charter in respect to
 the authority of the General Assembly
 of the United Nations.  I prefer that
 course to a continuation of the unneces-
 sary killing, bombing, and warmaking in
 South Vietnam.
 I again suggest to Senators and to
 members of the executive branch of the
 Government that over the weekend they
 reread the messages of Woodrow Wilson
 and Franklin Roosevelt. I have said be-
 fore in the Senate that I hoped Senators
 would read the great war message that
 Woodrow Wilson delivered in April 1917,
 before a joint session of Congress, in
 which he set forth that great principle
 of constiutional law for which, for 2
 years, the senior Senator from Oregon
 has been pleading in the Senate. Presi-
 dent Wilson said that he was without
 constitutional authority to make war in
 the absence of a declaration of war; and
 because of that undeniable constitu-
 tional restriction upon the President of
 the United States, he came before a
 joint session of Congress and recom-
 mended a declaration of war against the
 German Imperial Government, setting
 forth his reasons therefor.
 I would also have Senators read the
 great war message of Franklin Roose-
 velt following Pearl Harbor, when he,
 too, recognized that he was without au-
 thority to make war in the absence of a
 declaration of war.  If Senators will
 read that great war message, as well as
 the message of Woodrow Wilson, per-
 haps they will reflect a little longer than
 they reflected in August 1964, and re-
 flected again this year, when the Presi-
 dent submitted to Congress his so-called
 $700 million appropriation bill for the
 war in South Vietnam, although at the
 time he sent it he told Congress and the
 world that he did not need the money
 because he had the power to transfer
 funds without the bill.  He said he was
 using the bill as a vehicle for determin-
 ing whether or not Congress would stand
 behind the resolution of August, 1964.
 Congress voted the funds; and when it
 did, every Member of Congress who voted
 for the bill stated that he voted con-
 fidence in the President to make war in
 South Vietnam, outside the Constitution,
 and, in my opinion, violated his oath
 of office.
 In view of the fact that Congress will
 undoubtedly, mistakenly, adjourn sine
 the by the end of next week, I hope that
 the American people will exercise their
 precious right of freedom during the
 time that Congress is not in session and
 will make clear to the Members of Con-
 gress that foreign policy does not belong
 to Congress or to the President, but be-
 longs to the American people.  I hope
 that the American people will, during
 the adjournment of Congress, make per-
 fectly clear to the Members of Congress
 that they expect them to return in Jan-

 EXHIBrr 1
 STALEMATE IN VIETNAM
 (By Walter Lippmann)
 The success of the American buildup in
 South Vietnam has been very considerable
 when we measure it by what so many in-
 formed people feared last June.  The Viet-
 cong has not been able to smash the Saigon-
 ese army, to cut the country in half, and in
 this military disaster to bring about the over-
 throw of the government In Saigon.  There
 is reason to think that the size and power
 of the American forces has discouraged or
 prevented the Vietcong from mounting big
 enough battles to win a victory over the
 Saigonese.
 Yet, things have not come out as the ad-
 ministration spokesmen hoped they would.
 They allowed themselves to think that a
 demonstration of our abiilty to build up a
 great American force which could not be
 defeated would compel or persuade the Viet-
 cong and Hanoi to agree to a negotiated set-
 tlement.  Quite the contrary has happened.
 The position of the Vietcong and Hanoi to-
 day is even harder than it was last spring.
 Why? Why, as we have put more and
 more of the best troops we have Into South
 Vietnam, as we have escalated the violence
 of our attacks, have our adversaries become
 ever more scornful of our proposals to nego-
 tiate?
 My own belief Is that they are convinced
 that, while the Americans cannot be defeat-
 ed, the Americans cannot win the war on
 the ground.  This, however, Is where the
 war has to be won, in the villages of South
 Vietnam, and that is where the struggle
 will in the end be decided.  The essential
 fact, which is beginning to seep through
 the dispatches of some of the American
 correspondents, is that while the Americans
 can seize almost any place they choose to
 attack, the Vietcong will almost surely come
 back once the Americans leave.
 The war in Vietnam is like punching a
 tub full of water.  We can make a hole
 with our powerful fist wherever we punch
 the water. But once we pull back our hand,
 possibly to punch another hole in the water,
 the first hole disappears.  In theory, the
 Saigonese army ought to fill the hole, ought
 to occupy and pacify the places we seize.
 But the Saigonese army Is not able to do
 this because it is too small and too war-
 weary.
 It is too small because the villages, which
 are the reservoir of available manpower, are
 for the most part Vietcong in their sym-
 pathies or are terrorized' by the Vietcong.
 The  Saigonese army is too disillusioned
 and has too little morale to occupy terri-
 tory                        which  the  Americans  have  seized.
 What remains of the Salgonese army has
 little enthusiasm for the revolving politicians
 in Saigon.
 There are some Republican  politicians
 who think that this mess can be disen-
 tangled or ended by bombing the industrial,
 and therefore populated, centers of Hanoi
 and Haiphong.  The President, fortunately,
 has resisted the temptation to make the
 war a total war, and thus to make it a gen-
 eral Asian war.
 In any event, our adversaries in the Viet-
 cong and in Hanoi show no signs of being
 intimidated by the possibility of total war.
 The Vietcong in the south are already re-
 ceiving the full treatment of total war by
 our area bombing, and the North Vietna-
 mese do not value their material posses-
 sions, which are few, not even their lives,
 which are short and unhappy, as do the
 people of a country who have much to lose
 and much to live for.
 Our adversaries, moreover, have time to
 wait, time to retreat, to hide, and to live
 to fight another day.  So we shall be forced
 to face the fact that In order to win the
 war in South Vietnam we shall have to oc-
 cupy South Vietnam with American troops.
 A few month ago Mr. Hanson Baldwin, the
 military correspondent of the New York
 Times, called for a million men for Vietnam.
 It sounded fantastic at the time in the light
 of what President Johnson was saying about
 not wanting a wider war.  But it is beginning
 to look very much as if Mr. Baldwin had made
 an informed and realistic estimate of what
 a military solution would require.
 The situation has become so tangled that
 no clear and decisive solution is for the
 present conceivable.  The President is no
 nearer the negotiated settlement which he
 has hoped to bring about.  Nor, as a matter
 of fact, is the administration truly resolved
 to negotiate in a sense that it is prepared,
 even in its private thinking, to make the
 concessions that any successful negotiation
 is bound to call for.
 Failing the prospect of a settlement, the
 President has managed to obtain the assent
 of most of the country to the kind of war
 we are fighting-a sporadic, low-grade war
 carried on chiefly by a professional American
 army. There is no immediate prospect of big
 battles with big casualties because the Viet-
 cong, so it would seem, have withdrawn into
 guerrilla warfare.  Against the kind of force
 we have in Vietnam, guerrilla warfare can-
 not win a victory.                                                                            But neither can the
 guerrillas be defeated decisively and put out
 of business.
 If we cannot or will not escalate the war
 until we have an enormous army which can
 occupy the country, our best course is to
 dig in along the coast and begin to discuss
 with the Vietnamese politicians the forma-
 tion of a government in Saigon which can
 negotiate a truce in the civil war.  This
 course  will not please the majority of the
 President's current advisers.  But with all
 due respect to them, how do they propose to
 win this war, specifically, what size of Amer-
 ican army are they prepared to draft and
 put into Indochina?  For the war is not
 going to be won by punching the water.
 SWANSTON EQUIPMENT CO.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that the Senate pro-
 ceed to the consideration of Calendar
 No. 839, S. 317.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  The bill
 will be stated by title for the information
 of the Senate.
 The  LEGISLATIVE  CLERK.  A bill  (S.
 317)  for the relief of the Swanston
 Equipment Co.
 The PRESIDING. OFFICER. Is there
 objection to the present consideration of
 the bill?
 There being no objection, the Senate
 proceeded to consider the bill which had
 been reported from the Committee on
 the Judiciary with amendments in line 6,
 after the word "of", where it appears the
 second time, to strike out "$40,2M.19"
 and insert "$21,376"; and, in line 8, after
 the word "as", to strike out "excise taxes
 and"; so as to make the bill read:
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
 Representatives of the  United States  of
 America in Congress assembled, That the
 Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and
 directed to pay, out of any moneys in the
 Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to the
 Swanston Equipment Company, of Fargo,
 North Dakota, the sum of $21,376, repre-
 senting the sum of the amounts such com-
 pany was erroneously required  to  pay as
 customs duties in connection with the im-
 portation from Canada by it of certain farm
 machinery and equipment (including farm
 hoists) during the period beginning Octo-
 ber 6, 1956, and ending with the close of
 May 14, 1959.
 1 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent to have printed
 in the RECORD an excerpt from the report
 (No. 854), explaining the purposes of the
 bill.
 There being no objection, the excerpt
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 PURPOSE
 The purpose of the bill, as amended, is to
 pay to the claimant the sum of $21,376, the
 amount of customs duties paid in connection
 with the importation of certain farm ma-
 chinery and equipment.
 Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, the
 purpose of the bill, as amended, is to pay
 the claimant $21,376, representing cus-
 toms duties paid in connection with im-
 portation of  certain hydraulic truck
 hoists and parts thereof from Canada.
 During the period beginning in April
 1956 and ending in June 1959, claimant
 imported and sold to dealers in the Unit-
 ed States farm conversion truck hoists for
 installation on ordinary 11/2-ton trucks
 used by farmers.  Such hoists operated
 to raise the front end of the truck wagon

 Early in 1959 a special agent of the
 Internal Revenue Service discovered that
 the quarterly excise tax returns for the
 periods ending June 30, 1956, through
 June 30, 1959, had not been filed and the
 excise tax imposed by the Internal Reve-
 nue Code on the hoists sold during those
 periods had not been paid.  The tax-
 payer sought a ruling that the hoists were
 not taxable because, first, they, were
 mounted on trucks used only for agricul-
 tural purposes; and second, they were
 exempt. from excise taxes because they
 were subject to the import tariff.  The
 Internal Revenue Service rejected these
 arguments as being contrary to the In-
 ternal Revenue Code and ruled that the
 hoists were taxable. Claimant then was
 heard in the appellate division on the
 ground that the customs duties were im-
 properly collected and as such should be
 allowed as offset against the excise tax
 liability on the basis of the doctrine of
 equitable recoupment.  This claim was
 overruled on the grounds that, first, a
 requirement for free entry as an agri-
 cultural implement is that the implement
 must be chiefly used throughout the
 United. States for agricultural purposes;
 and second, available evidence did not
 establish that these hydraulic hoists were
 chiefly used in the United States for agri-
 cultural purposes.
 On June 23, 1963, the taxpayer made
 an offer in compromise of the excise tax
 liability, including penalty and interest.
 Included with the offer in compromise
 was a check for $7,961.75, which was
 tendered conditional upon acceptance of
 the offer.
 During the conferences. concerning this
 offer in compromise, the president of
 the claimant company stated he had re-
 lied upon the advice of an employee of
 the Small Business Administration, that
 the hoists were not subject to excise tax
 if customs duties had been paid on the
 hoists. On August 30, 1963, the offer in
