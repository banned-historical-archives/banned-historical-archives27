 Berlin and Germany:   Moscow has again moved the Ber-
 lin pro                   em to center stage and is treating the forthcoming
 Rusk-Gromyko talks as a "crucial phase" in the East-West
 dialogue..   Tension is being heightened through a tougher
 tone in Soviet pronouncements and in new threats to sign
 a separate peace treaty with East Germany, but Khrushchev
 apparently still hopes negotiations can be used to resolve
 the impasse.
 Nuclear Testing and Disarmament:   Khrushchev reasserted
 on 13 July that the USSR must  e    e "last" to test, but
 Soviet tests seem toLbe some time in the future.   The dis-
 armament conference reconvened in Geneva on 16 July with no
 sign of a signjgicant change in Sov.iet~positions.
 Moscow Peace Conference and Sino--Soviet Relations:   The
 congress ended its seven-day meeting with a bland reso u-
 tion.                   The Soviet Union and Communist China used the meeting
 to project an outward appearance of bloc unity, but other
 developments indicate continued deep hostility.
 Cuba:   The silence surrounding Raul Castro's departure
 from   Moscow contrasts sharply with they attention given his
 arrival and activities during the visit, and suggests that
 difficulties developed during his negotiations.
 Indonesia:   The composition of the delegation accompany-
 ing                   yan on his visit to Indonesia--to begin on 21 July--
 indicates that important political as well as economic mat-
 ters are to be discussed.

 Recent governmental changes and the completion of the
 long delayed program for the 12th Czechoslovak party congress
 suggest that party and government leader Novotny has beaten
 down internal party opposition and is movie  to strengthen
 the economy.
 EAST GERMANY'S ECONOMY AT MIDYEAR  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  ,   Page
 The regime at midyear could claim some progress toward
 solving its industrial problems, but the East German economy
 is suffering more acutely than ever from the effects of
 agricultural failures and past inflation.    Since last August
 the regime has been able to increase labor productivity in
 industry while maintaining the former wage level, and to
 overfulfill the conservative plan for industrial production.
 The effects of last year's very poor harvest, however, can-
 not be overcome quickly, and the regime has admitted that
 the food supply has declined and will not improve in the
 next four months.   The addition of key economic officials
 to the Presidium of the Council of Ministers represents an
 effort to adjust to long-range economic; problems.

 SIN0-INDIAN BORDER .     .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 10
 Tension remains high in the Sino-,Indian border area,
 particularly in the Galwan Valley of Ladakh, where forces
 of the two sides have been within rifle shot of one another
 for more than a week.       Both sides have warned that a clash
 may occur at any time, but each seems reluctant to initiate
 hostilities.   Both for the moment appear content to con-
 fine themselves to diplomatic exchanges and military shadow-
 boxing.                                                                                   25X1

 King Mahendra's recent reorganization of his Council
 of Ministhrs should increase government efficiency.                               The
 primary aim of the move, however, seems to have been to con-
 ciliate India by removing the India-baiting fo?eign min-
 ister."  Mahendra presumably hopes to encourage New Delhi's
 slight but growing sympathy for his administration to the
 detriment of the India-based Nepali exiles.
 LAOS .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page 13
 Souphannouvong's refusal to allow a company of Phoumi's
 troops to proceed to Khang Khay presents the Souvanna govern-
 ment with its first test of the'"troika" principle.                                          In
 antici *tio.n . of eventual national e.lectiois,, Phoumi is organ-
 izing a political movement designed to counter the Neo Lao
 Hak Sat--the Pathet Lao's political arm.   The Geneva con-
 ference on Laos is scheduled to conclude                       on 23 July, and
 there is no evidence that Soviet bloc representatives will
 raise issues to delay the signing of the neutrality agree-
 ments.

 Recent operations reveal a high level of military profes-
 sionalism on the part of the Viet Cong.  In the northern
 part of South Vietnam, 'they appear to be building up a
 strong force based on cadre units from re,gu ar North Viet-
 namese Army divisions. Wh.iie= South Vietnamese Army sweeps
 are destroying Viet Cong  ,nstallations and supplies and peep-
 ing the Communists off balance, Communist.: forces continue
 to elude encirclement by fleeing into the jungle when heli-
 copters appear.
 The Viet Cong's National Front for the Liberation of
 South Vietnam has stepped up efforts to gain acceptance abroad
 as spokesman for South Vietnam's people and has proposed that
 South Vietnam be "neutralized" along the lines of the Laotian
 settlement.

 WEST NEW GUINEA   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  ...  .  .  .  . .  .  .  .  ...  . Page  15
 Dutch-Indonesian talks on the West New Guinea dispute
 resumed on 13 July near Washington.            Certain to impede the
 talks, however, is Indonesia's long-standing demand for
 transfer of the area before the end of 1962, thereby by-
 passing the two-year interim administration fixed by the
 Bunker plan.   Indonesian military movements have continued
 without letup, and there are indications of plans for rela-
 tively large-scale action in early August.

 The rift between dissident Vice Premier Ben Bella and
 Premier Ben Khedda of the Provisional Algerian Government
 (PAG) appears to be widening, despite mounting pressure on
 both leaders to settle their differences and apply themselves
 to the country's economic and administrative problems
 Ben Bella, who has been joined by
 respected ex-premier Ferhat Abbas, appears to be gaining
 prestige and military strength.   Although Ben Bella's own
 statements continue to be moderate, members of his entou-
 rage have demanded the replacement of the PAG, implying that
 this would be done by force if necessary.                                    25X1

 Adoula is probably in serious trouble as a result of
 the 16 July assembly vote on his reorganized government.
 The number of his opponents is increasing and, aided by
 Tshombe,  they are intent on toppling the premier.                      There
 has been no progress toward Katanga's integration,                      and
 Adoula appears increasingly convinced that further negotia-
 tions would be fruitless.   Tensions between UN and Katangan
 forces in Elisabethville have risen sharply following Tshombe's
 "independence" day celebrations and the 17 July attack on
 a UN roadblock by mobs of Katangan women.                                 25X1
 The change in prime ministers probably means the end
 for the time being of economic and social reform in Iran.
 Most political elements disliked outgoing All Amini, whose
 reform program had alienated the traditional ruling groups
 without bringing enough visible benefits to the nationalist
 elements.   The appointment of Amir Asadollah Alam from
 the Shah's entourage marks the Shah's intention:.  again to
 participate fully in determining government policy.   The
 nationalists will find him completely unacceptable, and may
 show their feelings in demonstrations.

 THE EIGHTH WORLD YOUTH FESTIVAL   .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .   Page  20
 The Communist-sponsored Eighth World Youth Festival
 meets in Helsinki from 28 July to 6 August under conditions
 more favorable to Moscow's objectives than those at the
 Seventh Festival in Vienna in 1959.     Unlike the Austrians,
 the Finnish Government has given the festival organizers
 considerable support.   It is trying to minimize the dif-
 ficulties caused by the boycott of festival-preparations by
 most Finnish youth groups and to forestall possible Soviet
 complaints about the lack of Finnish cooperation.   While
 total attendance will probably fall short of earlier esti-
 mates, there will be the usual large delegations from the
 Sino-Soviet bloc.  A special effort is being made to en$U e
 extensive African, Asian, and Latin American participation.

 Captain General Augustin Munoz Grandes, appointed to
 the newly created post of vice premier in the reorganiza-
 tion of the Spanish cabinet on 11 July,. has been designated
 to carry on as head of the government when Franco dies or.-
 is incapacitated.   Munoz Grandes retains his post as chief
 of the High General Staff and now has been given control over
 the three service ministries.   He is known to favor close
 cooperation with the ITS in defense matters and may be ex-
 pected to press for US assistance in modernizing Spain's

 ITALY'S LABOR PROBLEMS .  .

 A wave of summer strikes--although normal in Italy--
 has raised serious difficulties for Premier Fanfani's ex-
 periment in left-center government.   Strikes early this
 month by metalworkers around Turin were accompanied by
 violent disorders apparently sparked by Communists and
 rightists to embarrass the government.   While these and
 otherstrikes are temporarily halted, Labor's grievances
 continue to encourage unity of action by Communist and
 non-Communist unions at a time when the government parties
 are seeking; to isolate the Communists politically.

 foreign demands for prior settlement of greece's prewar

 Brazil's government crisis eased on 13 July with
 congressional acceptance of Prime Minister Brochado da
 Rocha's cabinet.   The 17-day struggle between President
 Goulart and Congress appears to have resulted in at
 least initial victory for:: th'e"'Presidentt.   Goulart
 and his new prime minister apparently still hope for legal
 restoration of a strong presidency but seem likely to face
 continuing congressional,  .ca.lc.it:rance.   The government

 French national security policy today, as France moves

 an independent nuclear deterrent capable of ih.fld.c:ting suf-
 ficient retaliatory damage to make it unprofitable: for an
 aggressor to attack France.   De  Gaulle's concept, simplified,
 is that modern defense requires nuclear weapons; nations
 without them cannot hope to exert their full weight in inter-
 national affairs; and multilateral control of France's weap-
 ons would mean multilateral control of France's policy.
 Hence De Gaulle not only remains firmly opposed to sharing
 control of the French nuclear force, but has refused to have

 French forces, except those in Germany, equipped with
 nuclear weapons subject to US control,   Paris acknowi-
 edges a continuing need for the US deterrent and the Atlan-
 tic Alliance in the face of the Soviet threat ?but the
 sentiment that Europe needs its own defense capability
 free of US control is gaining ground Ln France even among
 those basically opposed to De Gaulle's nationalistic
 policies.   France, moreover, has little inclination to
 share its new weapons system with its partners at the
 present stage of European union
 GREEK-BLOC TRADE .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  ..  .  .  .  .  .  .             Page  5
 The growing volume of Greek trade with the Soviet bloc
 is of concern to Athens in view of its political and de-
 fense ties with the West.                        The bloc offers oil, machinery,
 and other items at bargain prices and provides an assured
 market for many agr-icultural products which Greece finds
 it difficult to sell elsewhere.   In recently concluded bilat-
 eral trade talks with three bloc nations the Greeks have
 shown caution about agreeing to further expansion, but the

 SCANDINAVIA AND THE EEC

 to join NATO in 1949.   In Denmark majority opinion strongly
 favors EEC membership, but in Norway a powerful. minority
 led by agricultural and fishing intersests--with the sup-
 port of certain religious groups--is opposed.   Norway's
 Labor government is firmly committed to seeking full member.:"

 President Arosemena, who took office through a coup
 last November, has successfully resisted several efforts
 by the military and rightist elements to depose him.   Right-
 ist apprehension has been caused by his tolerance of left-
 ists in his government And by his advocacy of reform pro-
 grams, although the reforms are favored by moderates.
 Now faced with the prospect of working with a new Congress
 dominated by potentially hostile conservative elements,
 Arosemena may encounter more determined efforts to oust
 him.

 WEEKLY REVIEW
 SOVIET FOREIGN POLICY DEVELOPMENTS
 Berlin and Germany
 The Soviet Union has re-
 activated Berlin as an urgent
 problem and appears to regard
 the forthcoming Rusk-Gromvko
 talks in Geneva as a "crucial
 phase" in the East-West dia-
 logue.  Recent Soviet state-
 ments have renewed the threat
 of a separate peace treaty with
 East Germany if no early nego-
 tiated settlement is achieved.
 ~  The So-
 viets apparently feel that this
 type of pressure will induce
 Western concessions in negotia-
 tions, which they continue to
 stress as the preferable means
 of resolving the question.
 Berlin problems.  On 17 July
 Izvestia published an article
 po n t g out that the US-Soviet
 bilateral talks have reached a
 critical stage without a res-
 olution of the main question--
 the occupation status of West
 Berlin.
 The 12 July TASS statement
 questioned the "good intentions"
 of the Western powers and point-
 ed out that it was "common knowl-
 edge" that the Soviet Government 25X1
 in Khrushchev's 10 July proposal
 had taken a "serious step to-
 ward meeting the Western powers
 halfway."   The statement reit-
 erated the USSR's decision to
 sign a separate peace treaty if
 no agreement with the West is
 negotiated.
 During the past week, the
 Soviet Government has issued a
 flood of strong statements con-
 cerning Berlin.  On 12 July,
 TASS published a restatement
 of the USSR's fundamental posi-
 tion on Berlin and Germany; it
 was apparently prompted by the
 immediate US rejection of Khru-
 shchev's 10 July proposal to
 replace the Western forces in
 West Berlin with contingents
 from four of the smaller NATO
 and Warsaw Pact members under
 United Nations authority.  This
 was followed on 14 July by a
 harsh note to the United States,
 Britain, and France formally
 rejecting the Western proposal
 of four-power talks on local
 The 14 July Soviet note
 on West Berlin further stressed
 the bloc's demand for abolition
 of the occupation status in
 West Berlin.   It called attention
 to "fascist and criminal provoc-
 ative" activity from West Ber-
 lin, pointing out that the
 Western powers "by preserving
 the occupation regime" must
 assume responsibility for the
 actions of West Berliners.
 It claimed that this "provoc-
 at:ive activity" only demon-
 strates the necessity for
 an "urgent normalization of
 the situation on the basis
 of a peaceful German settle-
 ment."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 East German leader Ulbricht
 has also reflected the appar-
 ent bloc decision to increase
 the tension and pressures
 surrounding the Berlin ques-
 tion in order to convince the
 West that some modification of
 its position is necessary. The
 official East German Neues
 Deutschland gave prominent
 attention on 11 July to Ul-
 bricht's message to the Moscow
 peace congress in which he
 emphasized the necessity for
 a peace treaty.  He maintained
 that the current dangers in
 the Berlin situation which were
 causing concern to "all respon-
 sible people" could be eliminated
 only when "respect for the
 sovereignty and borders of the
 German Democratic Republic is
 guaranteed."  A leading East
 German party spokesman, Albert
 Norden, echoed Ulbricht's state-
 ment at a 13 July press con-
 ference in Moscow, stressing
 that East Germany "emphatically
 demands the conclusion of a
 peace treaty as soon as possible.
 Following Khrushchev's
 Vienna meeting with President
 Kennedy, when the Soviet Union
 was trying to force the US to
 initiate further diplomatic
 exchanges on Berlin, there were
 repeated Soviet and satellite
 statements that Moscow would
 sign a treaty with East Ger-
 many before the end of that
 ea-
 Despite the bloc's sharper
 attack on the Western position
 on Berlin, Moscow has continued
 to evidence interest in pursuing
 the bilateral talks.   Khrushchev's
 10 July proposal was probably
 aimed at assuring US leaders
 that the USSR is prepared to
 offer sufficient variants of
 its basic position to provide
 for further discussion. Similarly,
 in :his 13 July interview with
 a delegation of US newspaper
 editors, Khrushchev was com-
 paratively restrained in his
 elaboration of the outstanding
 East-West issues.
 A TASS version of the in-
 terview--not published until
 11 July and then very carefully
 edited and revised--quoted Khru-
 shchev as pointing out that he
 had not lost hope that the US
 Government would come to a
 "reasonable understanding" of
 the Berlin problem.   While
 reaffirming Moscow's demand
 that, Western occupation troops
 be withdrawn from West Berlin,
 he attempted tc assure the US
 that if its representatives
 were more forthcoming in the
 private discussions on the
 Berlin question the situation
 could be quickly settled. He
 asserted that on the question
 of a separate peace treaty "we
 shall not hurry, but neither
 shall we tarry," and voiced the
 expectation that US leaders
 would take a "reasonable

 attitude" toward an eventual
 solution.
 In addition to the diplo-
 matic and propaganda threats,
 the Communists may also in-
 crease pressure in Berlin it-
 self in the hope of inducing
 some modification in the West's
 position.   They will probably
 be careful not to undertake a
 unilateral action which poses
 a direct challenge to the West,
 but they may well renew such
 harassing tactics as the air
 provocation on 17 July over
 West Berlin.   On that occasion,
 in what appears to have been
 a deliberately calculated demon-
 stration, Soviet fighter air-
 craft twice approached dangerous

 ly close to US aircraft.
 Nuclear Testing
 and Disarmament
 The USSR has reiterated
 its intention to respond to
 the current US test series with
 another series of its own.  Both
 a 13 July TASS statement on
 nuclear test issues and Khru-
 shchev in his interview with
 the US editors warned in ef-
 fect that the USSR must be the
 "last" to test in order to
 come "'abreast" of the US in
 the number of testing series.
 Neither warning, however, con-
 veyed a sense of immediacy, and
 Soviet tests still seem to be
 some time off.
 Khrushchev's remarks to
 the US editors that a treaty
 banning "tests for all time"
 could be signed following com-
 pletion of the current US test
 series and the-next Soviet
 series suggest  that with the
 conclusion of the Soviet series
 the USSR will open another
 propaganda campaign aimed at
 a test ban treaty using "national"
 means of detection to police the
 agreement without providing
 for mandatory on-site inspections
 of suspicious events.   The So-
 viets may also amend their
 present draft treaty along the
 lines of the neutralists'  "com-
 promise" memorandum of last
 April and provide for invita-
 tional on-site inspections by
 neutral teams.   Soviet leaders
 probably believe that such
 moves, while clearly unacceptable
 to the West, would impress the
 nonaligned powers and embarrass
 the US.
 At the 17-nation disarma-
 ment conference, which recon-
 vened in Geneva on 16 July,
 Soviet delegate Zarin has used
 much the same tactics of at-
 tempting to demonstrate flexi-
 bility by making some minor
 changes in the Soviet draft
 treaty which in fact do not
 amount to a significant modi-
 fication of approach. He
 characterized his action as a
 "new step" to meet the US and
 the other Western powers "half
 way again."   The amendments
 provided Soviet acceptance of
 the US percentage figures for
 conventional armaments reduc-
 tion in the first two stages of
 a disarmament agreement.   Zorin
 accepted Western suggestions
 that military missions be ex-
 changed and "rapid and reliable
 communication" be established
 among heads of governments
 and the UN secretary general
 in order to inhibit the acci-
 dental outbreak of war.

 conference session that the So-
 viet changes represented an
 important move forward, admitted
 privately to a Western journalist
 that the changes were, in fact,
 "not very significant."  He
 asserted, however, that what
 was really important was that
 the Soviets now are evidently
 willing to consider compromises
 and that such an approach, if
 applied to other matters in
 dispute, might permit East-West
 agreement.
 Ambassador Dean has com-
 mented that regardless of the
 specious nature of Moscow's
 "acceptance's of percentage re-
 duction of conventional arma-
 ments and the prevention of
 war measures, the Soviets are
 gaining credit among the eight
 nonaligned delegations for at
 least making some move from
 their previous position.  The
 Soviets appear to recognize the
 appeal of this position for
 Soviet propaganda, stressing
 that Dean returned to Geneva
 "with his old and not even re-
 furbished luggage" to restate
 the US "bankrupt policy" of
 controls over armaments rather
 than disarmament.
 Moscow Peace Conference
 And Sino-Soviet Relations
 Disarmament was the key-
 note of the six-day World
 Congress for General Disarmament
 and Peace, which closed in Mos-
 cow on 14 July with a bland
 resolution calling for general
 and complete disarmament "under
 strict international control."
 Expressing the fear that the
 proliferation of nuclear
 weapons and improved delivery
 systems will soon make arms
 control impossible, the con-
 gress appealed for an imme-
 diate agreement "on renuncia-
 tion of all tests of nuclear
 weapons," and for a treaty
 banning such tests.   Although
 avoiding any open attacks on
 Western positions and policies,
 the resolution reflected Soviet
 propaganda themes on disarma-
 ment, the advocacy of preven-
 tive war in the West, and the
 arms race.
 Communist China was rep-
 resented by a delegation
 headed by the writer and
 Minister of Culture Mao Tun,
 who throughout the congress
 sought to give the impression
 of Sino-Soviet solidarity, es-
 pecially in his remarks hail-
 ing Khrushchev's warning
 against an invasion of main-
 land China.  Both the Soviets
 and the Chinese, in marked
 contrast to their open polemics
 at recent front organization
 meetings, appear to have been
 careful to maintain at least
 the outward appearance of bloc
 unity and agreement on the
 question of disarmament.  How-
 ever, the prevailing theme at
 the congress and in its reso-
 lution was that of the over-
 riding importance of disarma-
 ment at the expense of the
 Chinese emphasis on support
 for "wars of national libera-
 tion."   The Soviet and Chinese
 accounts of the congress have
 differed considerably, with each
 side emphasizing aspects which
 support its own position.
 The current, largely Soviet,
 effort to create an illusion
 of Sino-Soviet harmony was exem-
 plified in the attendance by
 Khrushchev and Mikoyan at a
 performance of Chinese acrobats
 and the Soviet, but not Chi-
 nese, accounts of the party
 for Chinese delegates.   The
 Soviet press also played up
 the arrival in Moscow, en
 route to Geneva, of Chinese
 Foreign Minister Chen Yi and
 North Vietnamese Foreign
 Minister Ung Van Khiem.   Both
 were guests of honor at a 16
 July luncheon given by Mikoyan,

 which the Soviet press described
 as being held in "a warm and
 friendly atmosphere."
 Peiping so far has not
 shown the same degree of en-
 thusiasm for Sino-Soviet soli-
 darity as has Moscow and prob-
 ably remains suspicious of So-
 viet motives.   During the thaw
 in March and April, at least
 one member of the Chinese party
 central committee reportedly
 was taken in by the propaganda
 truce, believing that Sino-So-
 viet tensions had in fact eased
 a little.   This misguided party
 official was sharply rebuked
 in front of a party meeting
 last May by Secretary General
 Teng Hsiao-ping, who insisted
 "they have not been eased at all."
 Peiping at present seems
 to be following guidelines
 laid down recently by the For-
 eign Ministry not to "recklessly
 make trouble" for the Soviets
 while showing that China's ideo-
 logical position remains "firm
 and clear."  The Chinese have
 publicly ignored signs of the
 growing rapprochement between
 Moscow and Belgrade and per-
 mitted the peace congress to
 pass without heatedly challenging
 the Soviet emphasis on general
 disarmament at the expense of
 the national liberation move-
 ment.            At the same time, Peiping
 has reiterated its support for
 the Albanian leadership and its
 adherence to other basic po-
 sitions in dispute with Moscow.
 The USSR's failure to is-
 sue a communique at the con-
 clusion of Raul Castro's talks
 in Moscow or to publicize his
 departure was in sharp contrast
 to the attention given his ar-
 rival on 2 July and his sub-
 sequent meetings with Soviet
 leaders,  including Khrushchev.
 According to Radio Havana,  Castro
 arrived in Havana on 17 July,
 but no mention was made of the
 results of his 14 days in Moscow.
 The composition of the
 delegation Castro headed strong-
 ly suggested that its primary
 purpose was to negotiate for
 additional Soviet military aid.
 The circumstances surrounding
 Castro's departure suggest that
 difficulties developed during
 the negotiations; Moscow may have
 rejected new Cuban requests for
 advanced military equipment or
 a possible Cuban plea for a
 firmer Soviet defense commitment.
 There has been no indica-
 tion that all of the mission has
 returned to Cuba, however, and
 negotiations on other matters
 could be continuing on a lower
 level.
 Indonesia
 The composition of the dele-
 gation accompanying Soviet First
 Deputy Premier Mikoyan on his
 visit to Indonesia indicates
 that important political as
 well as economic matters are
 to be discussed.   The visit,
 thus far announced only by the
 Soviet Embassy in Djakarta,  is
 to begin on 21 July.
 The presence of a deputy
 chairman of the State Committee
 for Foreign Economic Relations
 suggests that one subject of dis-
 cussion will be Indonesia's deteri-
 orating economic situation and
 its difficulties in meeting pay-
 ments for previous Soviet assist-
 ance.   The Foreign Ministry of-
 ficials accompanying Mikoyan--
 Deputy Foreign Minister Nikolai
 Firbyubin together with the chief
 of the Southeast Asian Affairs
 Bureau--will probably discuss
 the state of Indonesia's nego-
 tiations with the Dutch over West
 New Guinea and may seek assur-
 ances that these negotiations,
 encouraged by the US, do not re-
 flect a change in Indonesia's
 attitude toward the USSR.
 A delegation of this stature
 could also discuss long-range
 aspects of relations between the
 two countries, particularly in
 light of Indonesia's heavy in-
 debtedness to the USSR and Mos-
 cow's continued willingness
 to provide Djakarta with com-
 plicated and extremely expen-
 sive military items.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Czechoslovak party and gov-
 ernment leader Antonin Novotny
 last week made the second
 significantshift of a polit-
 buro member within a year and
 announced that the long-prom-
 ised program of the party's
 12th congress would be pub-
 lished beginning this month.
 These moves illustrate his
 ability to overcome opposition
 within the party and his deter-
 mination to put the economy
 in order.
 On 11 July party central
 committee economic specialist
 Alois Indra was appointed to
 r place deputy premier and
 party politburo member Otakar
 Simunek as chairman of the
 powerful State Planning Com-
 mission.   At the same time two
 first deputy chairmen of the
 commission were demoted    to
 deputy chairmen.   These changes
 will allow Novotny to divert
 some of the blame  for the weak
 performance of the economy to
 dismissed and demoted economic
 administrators.
 aimunek, who was in Mos-
 cow at the CEMA Executive Com-
 mittee meeting when the changes
 were announced, will continue
 as deputy premier responsible
 for C :MA matters,  foreign
 trade, and planning.    His as-
 sumption of the main CEMA
 representative job--previously
 held by Stanislav Vlna, one of
 the demoted first deputy chair-
 men--may reflect the regime's
 anticipation of a further in-
 tegration of the Czech economy
 into CEMA and that organiza-
 tion's growing importance to
 the bloc in the face of the
 growth of the Common Market.
 Since Khrushchev at the
 22nd Soviet party congress
 last November reiterated the
 necessity of de-Stalinization,
 the Czech party has twice con-
 vened its central committee
 to take steps to comply. How-
 ever,  the party apparatus,
 probably up to politburo level,
 is split over the de-Staliniza-
 tion.issue, and agreement has
 been reached only on such
 minor matters as changing
 street names. Novotny's
 patently false claims that
 deceased  President Gottwald
 was responsible for Czecho-
 slovakia's Stalinist era have
 aroused resentment against
 the regime.
 There were indications
 in mid-May that the more liberal
 members of the leadership
 tried to challenge Novotny re-
 garding the continuing fail-
 ure of the regime to over-
 come economic problems and
 his personal inability to
 adopt a more liberal outlook.
 The seriousness of the attack
 on Novotny was suggested by
 the decision again to postpone

 the already delayed party
 congress, the further delay
 in publication of the im-
 portant party program, and
 rumors that he would be forced
 to resign.
 Soviet central committee
 secretary Ilichev was dis-
 patched to Prague in early
 May, probably to plumb the
 depths of Novotny's difficul-
 ties and to make known Soviet
 desires on Czech developments.
 Moscow continues to support
 Novotny, although there are
 reports that it is displeased
 by the imprisonment of Novotny's!
 political rival, politburo
 member Rudolf Barak, and Czech
 failure to de-Stalinize. The
 Soviet party probably feels
 that Novotny should remain,
 in view of the lack of a suit-
 able successor and the neces-
 sity of avoiding crises which
 would affect bloc political
 stability in a time of wide-
 spread economic difficulties
 and ideological dispute with
 Communist China.  Novotny,
 with Soviet backing assured,
 probably forced the decision
 to postpone the party congress
 from October until December
 to gain time to rebuild his
 support in the central com-
 mittee and to determine the
 full. scope of the country's
 economic problems.
 On 11 July Prague finally
 announced the completion and
 forthcoming publication of new
 party statutes and a draft
 program on the further progress
 toward socialism which will ad-
 vance Czechoslovakia's claim
 to being the second socialist
 state after the USSR.  This
 long-delayed move constitutes
 further evidence that Novotny
 has overcome, at least for
 the present, opposition to
 his policies.
 The completion of the
 party program further suggests
 that decisions have finally
 been made on whether to switch
 from the present five-year plan
 to a seven-year economic plan,
 on the direction of the economy,
 and on the scope and pace of
 de-S1;alinization.   The conduct
 of the discussions of the party
 program, selection of delegates
 to the congress, and the
 operation of the congress it-
 self will reveal whether
 Novotny will have sufficient
 strength to implement his
 economic programs and his own
 particular version of de-
 Stalinization.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 EAST GERMANY'S ECONOMY AT MIDYEAR
 The midyear economic re-
 port to the East German central
 committee indicates that the
 effects of agricultural failures
 and bast inflation are being
 felt more acutely than ever, but
 that some success has been
 achieved in straightening out
 problems in industry.
 Prospects for industrial
 growth are somewhat better than
 in previous years. The closing
 of the Berlin sector border last
 August increased the govern-
 ment's control over labor. It
 practically eliminated the pos-
 sibilityof escape to West Ger-
 many,  and has enabled the re-
 gime to raise labor productivity
 without granting further wage
 increases.   Under Soviet pres-
 sure,  planning has become more
 realistic and is less affected
 by fears of a Western embargo.
 The conservative goal for in-
 dustrial production is being
 ovEerfulfilled--production in
 the first five months was up
 7.8 percent over the same
 period in 1961.
 In spite of the improve-
 ment in industrial performance
 however,  investment and export
 plans continue to be underful-
 filled.                                                                       Lags in construction
 and in delivery of machinery
 and, equipment have prevented a
 speedup in the completion of
 priority investment projects,
 and the regime does not expect
 the investment plan to be ful-
 filled this year.   The export
 program also is behind schedule,
 partly because of frequent shifts
 in foreign trade plans.   These
 same shifts have been afactor
 in a piling up of inventories
 of semifinished and finished
 goods, especially in the machinery
 and equipment industries.

 Shortfalls in agricultural
 production,   due in part to pre-
 cipitous collectivization, can-
 not be quickly overcome. A very
 poor harvest in 1961 and a sub-
 sequent decline in livestock
 numbers and the output of
 animal products this year have
 led to the current serious food
 shortages, and the regime has
 admitted that the food supply
 has declined and will not im-
 prove in the next four months.
 Neues Deutschland reported on
 30 June that the 1961 harvest,
 in comparison with that in 1960,
 was lower by 43 percent in
 potatoes, 37 percent in corn,
 32 percent in sugar beets,  and
 24 percent in grain. Since June
 1961, the number of pigs in the
 country had dropped by about
 15 percent and cattle by about
 2 percent, and the current
 attempt to rebuild herds will
 limit the output of livestock
 products, even if the harvest
 is better than last year's.
 The regime has said that it will
 not increase imports of meat
 and butter, but may decide to do
 so if production drops below
 expected levels.

 SINO-INDIAN BORDER
 Tension along the Sino-
 Indian border in Ladakh remains
 high as both New Delhi and Pei-
 ping pursue a strategy of occupy-
 ing as much of the disputed
 territory as possible without
 actually fighting for any
 single piece of real estate.
 This military shadowboxing on
 occasion creates a potentially
 explosive confrontation of forces
 such as the one in the Galwan
 Valley, where several hundred
 Chinese and Indian troops have
 been within rifle shot of one
 another for more than a week.

 For the moment the ad-
 vantage there seems to be with
 the Indians.  The Chinese force
 is reported to have pulled back
 a bit after having advanced at
 one point to within 15 yards of
 the Indian position.  Both sides
 have warned that they cannot
 and will not submit to threats
 or pressure, and for each the
 impasse in the remote 15,000-
 foot mountain defile has
 developed into a test of re-
 solve from which it will be
 embarrassing to back off.
 However, no shots have yet
 been exchanged, and the forces
 present are apparently under
 orders not to fire unless fired
 upon.   Indian officials have
 been quoted publicly to the
 effect that,  if the Chinese
 open fire, the Indians will
 "give it back," not only in
 the Galwan area but at other
 points along the disputed
 frontier.
 Indian and Chinese
 forces con inue their maneuver-
 ing in close proximity and the
 tempo of public charges and
 countercharges is increasing

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Recent changes that King
 Mahendra has made in his
 Council of Ministers will re-
 duce the workload of several
 key ministers, make better use
 of the country's meager talent,
 and--most importantly--make the
 government less objectionable
 to India.   This is the first
 major shake-up since the King's
 assumption of personal rule in
 December 1960.
 The principal shift in-
 volves the council's two
 leading figures after the King,
 who is chairman and defense
 minister.   Tulsi Giri loses
 the home and foreign affairs
 portfolios, assumes the newly
 created post of vice chairman
 of the council, and retains
 his post as minister for palace
 affairs.   Rishikesh Shaha, who
 had been finance minister, takes
 over as foreign minister; he
 was once ambassador to Washing-
 ton.
 at the King's behest,  it earned
 New Delhi's enmity.
 On the other hand, the
 King appears to have used
 the more moderate Shaha to
 soothe New Delhi at times
 during the past year.   While
 Mahendra will continue to de-
 termine foreign policy, Shaha's
 administration will reflect his
 broader awareness of the world
 outside the Katmandu Valley and
 his recognition that Nepal can-
 not afford to alienate its power-
 ful southern neighbor.
 In moving to mollify the
 Indians as well as to improve
 his administration,  the King
 appears to be cautiously follow-
 ing through on matters raised
 during his visit to New Delhi
 in April.   He presumably hopes
 that by reducing Giri's role
 and seeking to,inject new vigor into
 his administration, he can per-
 suade the Indians to make further
 efforts to restrain the hit-and-
 Giri's new assignment in
 effect kicks him upstairs where
 he will have less direct in-
 fluence on foreign policy but
 where his general usefulness
 to the King can continue.   As
 foreign minister, Giri had been
 the intemperate voice of Nepali
 nationalism, charging Indian
 "dominance," whiplashing New
 Delhi for "supporting" the
 Nepali exiles, and pressing for
 closer relations with other
 countries,  including Communist
 China.   Although Giri's India-
 baiting was probably undertaken
 run activities of the India-
 based Nepali exiles and, in
 time, to accept his claim
 that Nepal needs his type
 of personalized authoritar-
 ian rule.   Although the In-
 dian Government still sympa-
 thizes with the rebel move-
 ment,  there are signs that
 following the King's meet-
 ings with Nehru in April,
 New Delhi has begun to show
 more willingness to cooperate

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 LAOS
 While the international
 conference on Laos appears moving
 toward an early conclusion in
 Geneva,  the coalition govern-
 ment in Vientiane faces its first
 major test.   Souphannouvong,
 acting premier in the absence
 of Souvanna Phouma, has refused
 to permit a company of Phoumi's
 troops to proceed to Khang Khay
 in fulfillment of the coalition
 leaders' decision to establish
 composite battalions in admin-
 istrative centers.   Phoumi has
 warned Souphannouvong that if
 he persists in this stand, it
 would be necessary to request
 withdrawal of Pathet Lao and
 neutralist companies from Luang
 Prabang and Vientiane.   Phoumi
 has urged Souvanna to return to
 Laos to ease the tensions which
 have developed since his depar-
 ture in mid-June.
 Nationalist and Communist
 China are continuing to press
 for diplomatic representation
 to the new Laotian government.
 The Nationalist ambassador-
 designate was told on 16 July
 that arrangements would be made
 for him to present his creden-
 tials to King Savang.   However,
 accreditation is also pending
 for the Communist charge, who
 arrived in Vientiane on 11 July.
 The rival Chinese regimes re-
 main unequivocally opposed to
 any "two-Chinas" solution.
 In anticipation of eventual
 national elections, General Phoumi
 is organizing a political movement
 designed to counter the Neo Lao
 Hat: Sat--the political arm of the
 Pathet Lao.   Phoumi's new party,
 called the National Movement for
 the Defense and Preservation of
 the Independence of Laos,  aims
 at merging existing rightist parties.
 It reportedly hopes to collaborate
 with Souvanna's fledgling Neutral-
 ist Party (Lao Pen Kang) in pre-
 senting a single slate of candi-
 dates to oppose the Pathet Lao,
 who have a widespread,  disciplined
 grass-roots organization.   Strong
 regional and vested interests will
 hamper formation of a non-Communist
 united front.   The Neo Lao Hak Sat's
 election victories in 1958 largely
 resulted from the failure of the
 anti-Communists to put up a uni-
 fied slate.
 Meanwhile] in Geneva, repre-
 sentatives of the 14 nations par-
 ticipating in the Laotian confer-
 ence convened in May 1961 are
 scheduled to sign the neutrality
 agreements on 23 July.   Soviet
 bloc foreign ministers are al-
 ready arriving in Geneva,  and
 there are no indications that the
 Communists will raise any extra-
 neous issues such as Vietnamese
 reunification which could delay
 the conclusion of the conference.

 The rift between dissident
 Vice Premier  Ben Bella and Pre-
 mier Ben Khedda of the Provi-
 sional Algerian Government (PAG)
 appears to be widening, despite
 mounting pressure on both lead-
 ers to settle their differences
 and apply themselves to the
 country's economic and admin-
 istrative problems.
 Ben Bella,
 who has bee  joined by respected
 ex-premier Ferhat Abbas, appears
 to be gaining in prestige and
 military capability.  Although
 Ben Bella's own statements con-
 tinue to be moderate, members
 of his entourage have demanded
 the replacement of the PAG, im-
 plying that this would be done
 by force if necessary.
 Although spokesmen from
 both factions--including Abbas--
 have expressed optimism that
 the military chiefs would find
 a method for settling the dis-
 pute, most of those from Ben
 Bella's camp stress that they
 will not accept any formula
 unfavorable to him.
 Abbas' alignment with Ben Bella
 has probably destroyed his con-
 siderable potential as a medi-
 ator.
 On 17 July two PAG minis-
 ters--Foreign Minister Dahlab
 and Information Minister Yazid--
 threatened  to resign if the
 present confusion continues.
 On the same day the FLN-con-
 trolled General Union of Al-
 gerian Workers, probably out
 of concern over unemployment
 and the stagnant economy re-
 sia.lting from the exodus of Euro-
 peans, sent delegations to the
 PAG, Ben Bella, and leaders of
 the Algerian National Army (ALN)
 to urge a speedy reconciliation.
 With Ben Bella in Tlemcen
 are recently resigned PAG min-
 isters Mohamed Khider and
 Ahmed Francis and former PAG
 functionary Ahmed Boumendjel,
 in addition to Abbas and the
 "dismissed" ALN chief of staff.
 The US consul general in Al-
 giLers reported on 16 July that
 the whereabouts of PAG minis-
 ters Ben Tobbal and Mohammedi,
 assumed to be loyal to Ben
 Khedda, is uncertain.
 Conflicting public state-
 ments by spokesmen claiming to
 represent Ben Bella suggest that
 he may not be completely in con-
 trol of the militant ALN offi-
 cers around him.   The French
 foreign minister told Ambassa-
 dor Gavin last week that, in
 his opinion, the ALN is a force
 independent of both Ben Bella
 and Ben Khedda.   Ben Bella, more-
 over, may calculate that he
 must take some action to counter-
 balance the PAG's advantage of
 being installed in Algiers.
 An American journalist who
 has spent considerable time in
 Algeria told Ambassador Gavin
 last week that Ben Bella "is
 sure to win" because he has the
 support of the Algerian people.
 The journalist added that he
 felt that Ben Bella is less
 oriented toward the Communist
 bloc than Ben Khedda, but
 opined that Ben Bella would
 be difficult to deal with be-
 cause, like Nasir, he would
 accept aid from both East and
 West, and then go his own way.

 Ambassador Gullion notes
 that Congolese Premier Adoula's
 failure on 16 July to obtain
 absolute parliamentary majori-
 ties for his reorganized govern-
 ment showed "an embarrassing
 and unexpected weakness," but
 does not point to his early
 fall.   His opponents marshaled
 44 votes against him in the lower
 house, and the 60 favorable votes
 fell nine short of the absolute
 majority specified in the basic
 law.   In the Senate, no formal
 vote was taken because the op-
 position walked out.   Adoula
 contends that no more than a
 simple majority was required in
 either house, since he was only
 reshuffling his government.
 The presidents of the as-
 sembly and the Senate declared
 on 17 July that the new Adoula
 government was legally in of-
 fice.  The opponents, neverthe-
 less, charge that the Adoula
 government no longer has a legal
 basis, and have petitioned Presi-
 dent Kasavubu to name a new
 premier.  Adoula is expected to
 move quickly to recess parliament.
 The consolidation of forces
 against Adoula stems mainly from
 his failure to open Katanga's
 rich mining coffers to the rest
 of the Congo.   No progress on
 Katanga's reintegration has been
 madle since the Adoula-Tshomb6
 talks ended on 26 June.  Adoula's
 position appears in fact to have
 hardened.   He has flatly stated
 he will not appoint the Leopold-
 ville members to the joint com-
 missions agreed to by the two
 leaders, or resume talks until
 Tshomb6 gives positive assurances
 that he intends to reintegrate.
 Adoula seems increasingly con-
 vinced that further negotiations
 with Tshomb6 are hopeless and that
 force is  ,he only feasible
 answer.
 Tension in Elisabethville
 is again high, with all the ele-
 ments present for a serious
 clash.
 Adoula's varied opponents
 are stronger and better organi-
 zed, but are still bound together
 only by the negative aim of
 overturning the government.
 They range from the Gizengists
 and Lumumbists--led by Chris-
 tophe  Gbenye, one of two vice
 premiers removed by Adoula--to
 Tshombd's Conakat party depu-
 ties.  Ambassador Gullion re-
 ports that the opposition,  en-
 couraged by its show of strength,
 now is building its hopes around
 the other ousted vice premier,
 Jean Bolikango, a leader in
 Equateur Province.   Both Gbenye
 and Bolikango have reportedly
 sent delegations to ask Tshomhe
 for more help.  Among their
 complaints against Adoula is
 their charge that he has placed
 the Congo under US tutelage.
 Tshombd's intro-
 duction o    ,000 Tatangan troops
 into Elisabethville to cele-
 brate Katangan "independence" on
 11 July so irritated UN officials
 that they erected a roadblock on
 the only main route remaining
 open into the city.   Katangan
 forces, in turn, erected an
 opposing barrier.
 Scattered firing has oc-
 curred, and on 17 July an offi-
 cially organized mob of Katangan
 women attacked the Indian-manned
 UN roadblock with sticks, stones,
 and brush fires, and denounced
 the US as well as the UN.   Both
 sides have strengthened their
 barricades, and  the UN  is
 sending 500 reinforcements
 from Leopoldville.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The resignation of Prime
 Minister All Amini will be wel-
 comed by nearly all political
 elements in Iran.   The Shah,
 who has always been suspicious
 of independent-minded prime
 ministers,  supported him only
 reluctantly and probably is
 not unhappy to have him leave.
 Amini's departure probably al-
 so marks the end of any hope
 at present for an effective
 program of economic and social
 reform.
 The appointment of Amir
 Asadollah Alam as the new prime
 minister indicates the Shah's
 intention to participate fully
 in government operations.  Alam
 is head of the $130,000,000
 Pahlavi foundation set up by
 the Shah and is a member of
 the Shah's entourage.  Although
 he has announced a continuation
 of land reform and other meas-
 ures initiated by Amini, pres-
 sure from Alam's close friends
 who have been hurt by the re-
 forms is likely to end them.
 In his 14 months in of-
 fice, Amini undertook a series
 of measures aimed at evolution-
 ary change in Iran's social
 and economic patterns.   He
 started the distribution of
 large private landholdings to
 the peasants, undertook legal
 action against high officials
 accused of corruption,  and at-
 tempted to carry out a stabi-
 lization program to put the
 country's economic and fiscal
 house in order.  His effortF
 brought him no public support,
 however.  The landlord-merchant
 classes saw his program as a
 threat to their control of the
 country's economy and political
 processes.  The nationalists--
 primarily antiregime, neutral-
 ist-oriented reformers--consid-
 ered his program ineffectual
 and were especially irritated
 at his refusal to hold parlia-
 mentary elections.
 Amini did manage to sta-
 bilize the cost of living tem-
 porarily and to reduce Iran's
 foreign indebtedness,  but only
 at the expense of destroying
 the superficial prosperity which
 had accompanied the inflation
 of the earlier period.   The
 rate of investment dropped, un-
 employment rose,  and domestic
 sources of revenue dried up as
 the government's fixed-cost fi-
 nancial obligations mounted.
 The immediate reason for
 Amini's resignation was his in-
 ability to balance the budget.
 He ordered a 15-percent reduc-
 tion in the budgets of all min-
 istries.   Opposition to this
 move, particularly from the
 ministers of war and education,
 apparently created a deadlock
 which Amini was unable to re-
 solve.   Amini publicly blamed
 his troubles partly on Ameri-
 can failure to provide aid.
 Both he and the Shah have been
 disappointed that US budgetary
 support, which amounted to
 about $44 million last year,
 has been discontinued.
 The nationalists will find
 Alam even less acceptable than
 Amini.   Alam's appointment will
 give them an issue which will
 probably draw their disparate
 elements closer together.   They
 will have an opportunity to
 show their strength on 21 July,
 the tenth anniversary of the
 massive nationalist demonstra-
 tions which forced Prime Minis-
 ter Qavam out of office in fa-
 vor of Mossadeq.   The National
 Front is likely to make some
 sort; of demonstration which
 could snowball into widespread
 disorders should the security
 forces be indecisive.

 THE EIGHTH WORLD YOUTH FESTIVAL
 The Communist-sponsored
 Eighth World Youth Festival
 meets in Helsinki from 28 July
 to 6 August under conditions
 more favorable to Moscow's ob-
 jectives than those prevailing
 at the Seventh Festival in
 Vienna in 1959.   In contrast to
 the noncooperative attitude of
 most Austrian authorities,  the
 Finnish Government has given
 the organizers considerable sup-
 port in an attempt to minimize
 the difficulties caused by the
 boycott of festival preparations
 by most Finnish youth groups and
 to forestall possible Soviet
 complaints about the lack of
 Finnish cooperation.
 Finnish officials now
 expect about 11,550 participants;
 previous estimates ran between
 12,000 and 15,000.   Organizers
 of the 1959 festival claimed an
 attendance of 18,000.   There
 will be the usual large delega-
 tions from the Sino-Soviet bloc,
 headed by a Soviet group of
 about 700.   In addition the
 festival organizers are making
 a special effort--its success
 unknown--to draw large groups
 of Africans,  Asians, and Latin
 Americans.   In the free world,
 however, non-Communist youth
 groups in general are boycotting
 the festival and have announced
 their support of Finland's cen-
 tral youth organization, which
 has objected to holding the
 festival in Finland and has
 disassociated itself from all
 preparations for the meeting.
 Helsinki city and business
 leaders have taken a cool atti-
 tude,  and Finnish public opinion
 has been generally indifferent.
 Sensitive to reported
 complaints by the organizers
 that Finnish officials and youth
 organizations were not providing
 a hospitable atmosphere for the
 festival, and with the 1961
 crisis in Soviet-Finnish rela-
 tions still fresh in mind,
 the Finnish Government appears
 to have surrendered its hopes
 to maintain a hands-off atti-
 tude.                                                         It seems to have under-
 taken to assure the sponsors
 the cooperation of appropriate
 Finnish officials and groups.
 Although there has been no
 evidence of direct Soviet pres-
 sure in this regard,  President
 Kekkonen would be anxious to
 forestall possible Soviet com-
 plaints about any unpleasant-
 ness that might arise in conse-
 quence of a lack of cooperation
 with the preparatory committee.
 The changed attitude is
 reflected in public statements
 by government representatives
 and. in actions taken by those
 organizations most vulnerable
 to pressure from the govern-
 ment.                                                         In April the Agrarian-
 dominated government appealed
 to the Finnish public to meet
 the festival participants
 hospitably and warned that
 any attempt to cause unrest
 or disorder would be prevented.
 The Agrarian,  dissident Social
 Democratic, and Communist
 members of the program board
 of the Finnish state radio
 subsequently pushed through
 a resolution providing for
 half-hour daily transmissions
 from the opening to the clos-
 ing day of the festival.F_

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 THE NEW SPANISH VICE PREMIER
 Franco's purpose in cre-
 ating a vice presidency in
 Spain's Council of Ministers
 for Captain General Augustin
 Munoz Grandes was to place an
 individual directly in a po-
 sition to carry on as head of
 the government--but not as chief
 of state--when Franco dies or
 is incapacitated.    The appoint-
 ment--announced on 11 July--
 also gives Munoz Grandes control
 fo the three service ministries,
 in addition to his post of chief
 of the High General Staff.   The
 naming at the same time of "pro-
 gressive" new ministers of labor
 and industry suggests that there
 may be some liberalization of
 policies in the economic sphere,
 but there is little likelihood
 of any similar political thaw.
 Munoz Grandes is held in
 great esteem by Franco,  and
 their political views are prob-
 ably in close accord.   There is
 some reason to believe that
 Munoz Grandes' views on social
 and economic matters may be
 slightly more liberal than
 Franco's, but this is unlikely
 materially to affect the cau-
 tious policies now being followed
 in these fields.
 Munoz Grandes' military po-
 sition--in addition to his status
 as chief military representative
 on the three-man Council of the
 Regency and on the Council of
 the Realm, which are charged with
 selecting Franco's successor--
 suggests that he would have a key
 "role in choosing that successor.
 He has great prestige both in
 the armed services and in civil-
 ian political circles, but his
 age  (66) and his poor health
 make it unlikely that he would
 himself be the successor.   His
 views on a return to the monarchy,
 as provided for in the law now 25X1
 governing succession, are not
 clear.
 Although Munoz Grandes has
 cultivated a reputation as a    25X1
 loyal Franco supporter,  some
 observers describe him as an
 ambitious opportunist.
 Although Munoz Grandes was
 very critical of the US in
 earlier years, his attitude has
 gradually warmed and he now is
 regarded by the US Embassy in
 Madrid as "very friendly" to
 the US.  He favors close co-
 operation in matters of defense
 and thus can be expected general-
 ly to assist any negotiations
 with the US in the military
 field.   He also may be expected
 to press strongly for US as-
 sistance in modernizing Spain's
 military forces.

 ITALY'S LABOR PROBLEMS
 A wave of summer strikes--
 although normal in Italy--has
 raised serious difficulties
 for Premier Fanfani's experiment
 in left-center government.
 Strikes early this month by
 metalworkers around Turin were
 accompanied by violent dis-
 orders apparently sparked by
 Communists and rightists to
 embarrass the government.
 While these and other strikes
 are temporarily halted,  labor's
 grievances continue to encourage
 unity of action by Communist
 and non-Communist unions at a
 time when the government par-
 ties are seeking to isolate
 the Communists politically.
 There is evidence that the
 disorders in the Turin area--
 where demonstrators battled
 for hours with the police--
 involved both Communist-  and
 rightist-hired hoodlums. Right-
 ist parliamentarians, who share
 the Communists' aim of bringing
 down Fanfani, were quick to
 criticize the government as
 "ineffectual" in the face of
 Communist subversion, while
 Communist and Socialist offi-
 cials of the Communist-domi-
 nated CGIL criticized the "pro-
 vocative attitude of the police"
 in Turin.   Moderates such as
 Social Democratic chief Saragat
 and Liberal party deputy Alpini
 condemned both the Communists
 and the "clerical integralists"
 --presumably an allusion to
 Christian Democratic right-
 wingers who would like to sabo-
 tage their party's support of
 the present government--as in-
 citers of the Turin disorders.
 On 11 July the minister
 of labor offered his services
 as mediator of the metalworkers'
 dispute with management,  and
 all three unions have accepted
 his offer.   They refuse, however,
 to sign any agreement with the
 manufacturers' association,
 Confindustria,  less favorable
 than one signed earlier with the
 organization of government-owned
 metal industries,  Intersind.
 Progress toward a fundamental
 resolution of the dispute de-
 pends on whether government
 pressures can induce the hither-
 to rigid Confindustria to nego-
 tiate before the October dead-
 line for renewal of contracts,
 or whether such a development
 will be prevented by new strikes.
 With national elections scheduled
 for the spring of 1963, both
 Communists and rightists will
 be anxious to find ways to

 ment at the start of its fall

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The Greek defense budget
 has been the subject of debate
 for some weeks both in Athens
 and at NATO headquarters in
 Paris.   Military experts at
 SHAPE,  in consultation with
 leaders of the Greek armed
 forces,  have proposed a defense
 goal which, although considerably
 below previous unmet goals,
 would still necessitate a large
 increase in funds for the Greek
 armed forces.   The government
 regards this program as the mini-
 miUm  needed  for defense against
 possible Communist pressure
 from the north.
 Both present and proposed
 Greek defense expenditures
 fall far below the level neces-
 sary to meet this goal, however,
 and it is unlikely that other
 NATO powers will supply funds
 to fill the gap.   Suggestions
 from NATO committee members
 that in the absence of the
 necessary funds the Greek defense
 goal may have to be lowered
 below this SHAPE-proposed level
 have been denounced in Athens
 as dangerous for the strategic
 defense of both Greece and NATO's
 eastern flank.
 A shortage of funds is also
 threatening the government's
 Five-Year Economic Development
 Program (1960-64).   A NATO-
 sponsored plan to establish an
 international consortium of
 wealthier members to provide
 development assistance to Greece
 is being considered  by the
 Organization for Economic Co-
 operation and Development  (OECD).
 The British, however, with the
 support of several other mem-
 bers of the OECD, have balked at
 joining any consortium until
 Greece reaches some settlement
 on its defaulted pre - World War
 II foreign debts.
 Within Greece,  leaders of
 the nationalist opposition
 Center Union are continuing their
 eight-month-old campaign to
 bring down the government by
 stagging public rallies and
 by applying pressure on King
 Paul to intervene directly to
 force new national elections.
 This campaign will gather new
 force if Karamanlis suffers

 tiations for foreign military

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Brazil's government crisis
 eased on 13 July with congres-
 sional acceptance of Prime
 Minister Brochado da Rocha's
 cabinet.    The 17-day struggle
 between President Goulart and
 Congress appears to have re-
 sulted in at least initial
 victory for him.   The new
 cabinet will probably be more
 amenable than its predecessor
 to his direction.   The ministers
 are not representative of po-
 litical party strength in
 congress, some are apolitical,
 and several are personally loyal
 to Goulart.
 The conservative pro-US finance
 minister, Moreira Salles, has
 been retained from the previous
 cabinet.
 The military cabinet min-
 isters, like most of those
 miilitary figures who support
 Goulart,  support him on con-
 stitutional grounds rather than
 because of his politics.   The
 new navy and air ministers face
 substantial opposition within
 their respective services, but
 War Minister Nelson de Melo
 appears to be achieving general
 acceptance.
 Possibly the most contro-
 versial new appointment is that
 of Minister of Industry and
 Commerce Jose Ermirio de Moraes,
 a long-time associate of Gou-
 lart's..   Moraes has been giv-
 ing financial backing to pro-
 Communist Miguel Arraes, who
 is the leading candidate for
 governor in the key northeastern
 state of Pernambuco.   He is
 "antitrust   but only if the
 trust is foreign," according to
 the US Consulate in Recife.
 Labor Minister Hermes Lima
 has been a key official in the
 Goulart government for the past
 ten months.   He is a former law
 professor who advocates a
 socialist economy
 Foreign Minister Afonso
 Arinos de Mello Franco is
 identified with the "independent"
 foreign policy he helped im-
 plement under both Goulart and
 former President Quadros.
 Goulart and Brochado da
 Rocha apparently still hope for
 a -judicial decision favoring
 a plebiscite next October on
 the abolition of the parliamentary
 system and legal restoration
 of a strong presidency.   The
 prime minister has also announced
 that he will request a grant of
 special powers from Congress
 on 6 August--a move which is
 likely to be met by a quorum
 fai.lure,,since most congressmen
 are absent from Brasilia to
 compaign for the October elec-
 tions.
 The government now may be
 inclined to increase restrictions
 on private foreign investment
 in Brazil.   Brochado da Rocha in
 recent years has been closely       25X1
 associated with two expropriations
 of US companies in southern Brazil.
 His initial speech to congress
 stressed that "Brazil is a vic-
 tim of international capitalism."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE MIEKLY SUMMARY
 The joint command of the
 Peruvian armed forces has taken
 control of the government in
 order to deny power to the left-
 ist but anti-Communist APRA
 party.   In the early morning
 hours of 18 July, a military
 junta arrested President Manuel
 Prado, installed a military
 cabinet, suspended constitutional
 guarantees, and set aside the
 10 June presidential election,
 which had occasioned weeks of
 political bickering.  APRA can-
 didate Haya de la Torre's slight
 margin fell short of the one-
 third popular vote required for
 direct election, but armed
 forces leaders apparently feared
 that the new Congress, which
 was to meet 28 July to settle
 the presidential race, could be
 controlled by a coalition which
 would give APRA a major voice
 in government.
 The junta acted after
 President Prado had resolutely
 rejected repeated demands by
 the armed forces chiefs that
 he annul  the 10 June election
 or at least nullify as fraudulent
 sizable blocs of APRA votes.
 Invalidation of the disputed
 votes would have given Fernando
 Belaunde Terry, the runner-up
 candidate, more than one third
 of the remaining votes, making
 him legal president-elect.
 Although Belaunde had been
 the choice of the military during
 the campaign, his postelection
 antics--such as urging armed
 rebellion--have discredited him
 with the military leaders and
 most of his Accion Popular party.
 Communist agitators joined him
 in Arequipa on 16 July in in-
 citing his followers to "over-
 throw the government and pun-
 ish its wrongdoings," but
 he disavowed Communist guid-
 ance in making his plans for
 an insurrection.
 Haya and former dictator
 Manuel Odria,   who had been
 negotiating a coalition of
 their parties, announced partial
 agreement early in the week,
 subsequently broke off nego-
 tiations, and finally, the
 evening before the coup, an-
 nounced agreement that Haya
 would withdraw in favor of
 Odria.  An APRA man pre-
 sumably would have been vice-
 president with good prospects
 for early succession in view
 of Odria's age and illness.
 Odria and Haya reportedly took
 asylum in foreign embassies on
 the morning of the coup.
 One of the President's last
 official acts was to reject
 the mass resignation of his
 cabinet and to issue a proc-
 lamation  defending the valid-
 ity of the elections and the
 integrity of the National
 Elections Board.  The military
 junta installed a new cabinet,
 composed exclusively of mili-
 tary commanders, about nine
 hours after the coup and also
 announced that new presidential
 elections would be held in
 June 1963.
 The first outbreak of vio-
 lence occurred shortly after the
 military cabinet was sworn in.
 Students, mostly from San Marcos
 University, demonstrated to
 protest the suspension of civil
 rights.  They were quickly

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE YVEEKLY SUMMARY
 SPECIAL ARTICLES
 FRENCH NUCLEAR STRATEGY
 French national security
 policy today, as France moves
 toward operational atomic
 weapons capability,         centers on
 an independent nuclear deter-
 rent capable of inflicting suf-
 ficient retaliatory damage to
 make it unprofitable for an ag-
 gressor to attack France.   De
 Gaulle's concept, simplified,
 is that modern defense requires
 nuclear weapons; nations with-
 out them cannot hope to exert
 their full weight in interna-
 tional affairs; and multilat-
 eral control of France's weapons
 would mean multilateral control
 of France's policy.   Hence De
 Gaulle not only remains firmly
 opposed to sharing control of
 the French nuclear force, but
 has refused to have French
 forces, except those in Germany,
 equipped with nuclear weapons
 subject to US control.
 Nuclear Weapons Doctrine
 French defense theorists
 both in and out of the govern-
 ment are fully aware of the argu-
 ment that a nuclear deterrent
 requires credibility--not only
 sufficient force to damage the
 aggressor, but demonstrated
 willingness to use that force
 if necessary.   They argue that
 France's proposed force de
 frappe will have the necessary
 capab ility,  even though far
 smaller than the nuclear strike
 forces of the US and the USSR,
 because it will be in proportion
 to the stakes being defended:
 it can do enough harm to the
 aggressor to outweigh the ad-
 vantage he could derive from
 an attack on France.
 As to the second element of
 credibility--the readiness to
 wage nuclear warfare--the French
 theorists hold that only a
 SECRET
 nation, as distinct from an
 alliance,  has the unity and
 cohesive national will to make
 a potential aggressor believe
 it would in fact resort to
 nuclear warfare in defense of
 national interests in spite of
 the mutual destruction which
 would ensue.
 Many European military
 scientists take a skeptical
 attitude toward US statements
 that nuclear exchanges in an
 all-out war will probably con-
 centrate on purely military tar-
 gets.   The Europeans argue that
 the hardening and dispersal of
 missile sites and the continu-
 ing improvement of weapons and
 delivery systems leave less and
 less chance of knocking out an
 enemy's counterforce, and that
 enemy cities will therefore re-
 main the major targets.   this
 conclusion is being used by
 the French to reinforce their
 view that all powers will be
 extremely reluctant to resort
 to nuclear weapons.
 The admitted limitations of
 their own force de frappe give
 the French an adTtiona Treason
 for opposing a nuclear strategy
 that concentrates on military
 targets.  The aim of their
 strike force is to threaten an
 aggressor with severe damage
 to his country--in De Gaulle's
 phrase,  "to tear an arm off."
 France also differs with
 the US and NATO on the advisa-
 bi:lity of "raising the nuclear
 threshold"--i.e.,, increasing
 the capability to resist aggres-
 sion by conventional forces
 and so postponing the resort
 to nuclear weapons.   The French,
 who propose to cut back army
 strength from over 700,000 at
 present to 450,000 in 1970,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 make it a point of military
 doctrine that conventional
 forces alone have little de-
 terrent power or capability
 to compel an aggressor to
 pause in his advance.
 Another French argument
 against raising the nuclear
 threshold is that it could
 lead to a separation of tasks
 within NATO by tending to create,
 in effect, a "varsity" team
 with nuclear weapons and a con-
 ventionally armed second team.
 Such a separation, it is con-
 tended,  could lead to a weaken-
 ing of ties between West Ger-
 many--a nonnuclear power--and
 its major allies and make the
 idea of a denuclearized and
 neutralized zone in central
 Europe seem more attractive
 to the Germans.
 France and the Western Alliance
 French strategic policy--
 specifically, French opposition
 to the dilution of full national
 control of its military forces--
 is reflected in Paris' relations
 with NATO.   French officials
 from De Gaulle down continue in
 major foreign policy statements
 to acknowledge the need for
 allies and, by implication at
 least, the US strategic deter-
 rent in the face of the Soviet
 threat.   Speaking before a
 Western European Union meeting
 early in June, Premier Pompidou
 said the relative security re-
 sulting from the "current calm"
 in Berlin would be "unimaginable"
 without the USinilitary effort.
 The French maintain, however,
 that every area of the world
 needs its own deterrent to be
 fully safe from attack.   They
 argue in particular that the
 USSR may come to doubt whether
 the United States would risk its
 own cities in the defense of
 Western Europe and that Europe
 must thus develop its own de-
 terrent.   They see France's
 national deterrent as fulfilling
 two functions:   (1) serving as
 a European deterrent--although
 necessarily a weak one--from the
 moment it becomes operational;
 and  (2) ensuring. France a lead-
 ing role in any joint develop-
 ment of a more adequate deter-
 rent later on.
 De Gaulle, moreover, main-
 tains that the power relation-
 ship within NATO does not prop-
 erly reflect the nuclear stand-
 off between the US and the USSR,
 which in his eyes makes the in-
 creased strength of Europe a
 decisive factor.   French offi-
 cials argue that when NATO was
 set up,  neither a nuclear stale-
 mate nor a European power center
 was foreseen, but that the
 alliance now must be brought
 into accord with the "realities
 of the situation."
 France appears to be seek-
 ing a change in the basic nature
 of the alliance--giving France more
 say on policy--rather than mere
 increased representation in top
 commands or structural reorgani-
 za?tion.   De Gaulle suggested in
 1958 that a tripartite direc-
 torate of the US, the UK, and
 France should guide their global
 policy. How this directorate
 would function and what its
 authority would be have not been
 fully explained, but De Gaulle
 undoubtedly sees this as a
 means of increasing the French
 voice in allied councils, gain-
 ing some influence on US foreign
 and military policy decisions
 even outside of the NATO area,
 and,  in the process,  adding to
 French prestige.   Progress in

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 ties among the Common Market
 countries may have led French
 officials' to believe they now
 have a stronger base from which
 to negotiate for these changes.
 Recent French statements
 that changes in the alliance
 relationships can wait until
 a decision has been reached on
 British accession to the EEC
 are probably reflections of a
 belief in Paris that the French
 bargaining position is getting
 stronger with the passage of
 time.
 De Gaulle will probably
 continue to call attention to
 what he believes to be NATO's
 failure to adjust to a changed
 .environment.   Pending a re-
 organization,                            France is not
 likely to be more forthcoming
 in its force contribution to
 NATO.   For example,  French Army
 units being withdrawn from Al-
 geria will probably remain
 under national control in a
 status similar to the divisions
 transferred from Algeria to
 eastern France last summer.
 Domestic Opposition and Support
 There seems to be consid-
 erable  public support for the
 basic idea of European military
 and political self-reliance.
 A poll taken in early June by
 the reputable French Institute
 of Public Opinion showed that
 59 percent of   hose responding
 believed a unified Western Eu-
 rope could have its own policy
 independent of the US, while 15
 percent believed not.   Fifty-one
 percent thought this desirable,
 and only two percent thought not.
 Several leading French
 political commentators who have
 opposed other De Gaulle policies,
 including Raymond Aron,  have
 come out in favor of an inde-
 pendent European nuclear deter-
 rent as a part of the increased
 European strength.   Some polit-
 ical leaders,  including Radical
 party leader Maurice Faure
 and Popular Republican Maurice
 Schumann,  have stressed the
 value of an independent European
 deterrent, and a policy state-   25X1
 ment by the prominent,  left-
 intellectual Jean Moulin club
 urged greater European independ-
 ence of action within the
 Western alliance.
 There remains considerable
 opposition among parliamentary
 leaders to what they see as the
 anti-NATO tenor of De Gaulle's
 military policy.   The motiva-
 tion of these opponents is com-
 plex, however; some are still
 angry about De Gaulle's Al-
 gerian policy, some oppose his
 anti-inflationary social policy,
 and many oppose his personal
 hold on the levers of political
 power in France.   Unable to offer
 an alternative policy on Algeria
 and without an important bread-
 and-butter issue because of
 the basic health of the economy,
 parliamentary opponents have
 concentrated on De Gaulle's
 nationalist foreign and military
 policy.
 Much of the French nuclear
 weapons program was begun prior
 to De Gaulle,  under the govern-
 ments of some of those now oppos-
 ing him, and it is doubtful if,
 in the post - De Gaulle period,
 when these present opponents are
 likely to be in positions of
 authority, they will be able
 or willing to modify significant-
 ly a policy which, Gaullists

 can point out, has already
 strengthened the French bar-
 gaining position at least with-
 in the Western alliance.       The
 French proponents of national
 nuclear weapons capability can
 be expected to argue that grow-
 ing European cohesion makes a
 national program even more es-
 sential.
 The French Force and
 European Union
 The French nuclear force
 may develop under strictly
 national control, or be merged
 with other European forces
 under some form of joint con-
 trol.  There are precedents for
 a joint approach in the recent-
 ly formed European space re-
 search and launcher development
 organizations, and the extensive
 cooperation among European
 nations in conventional weapons
 broduction.
 French of-
 ficials have noted that growing
 European ties would, at some
 point in the future, extend
 to the military and nuclear
 weapons fields.   De Gaulle,
 in his proposals of a politi-
 cal treaty for the Common
 Market, has specified that the
 member nations in the grouping
 coordinate defense and military
 policy.
 Any post - De Gaulle demo-
 cratic government, with a greater
 "European" sentiment among the
 leadership, would probably move
 more rapidly toward this al-
 ternative.  The UK and the
 smaller members of the Common
 Market, with policies more
 firmly rooted in reliance on
 the Atlantic alliance, might
 influence France to permit a
 European deterrent to be placed
 under NATO command.   It seems
 highly likely, however, that
 any French government, short
 of one dominated by the far
 loft, would insist on retaining
 some deterrent capability under
 national control.
 At least as long as De Gaulle
 is on the scene, the primary
 French effort will be channeled
 into a national nuclear force.
 In a speech on 19 June, former
 premier Debre, reportedly after
 a long discussion with De Gaulle,
 opposed either a NATO or a Euro-
 pean nuclear force.   In the lat-
 ter case Debre based his opposi-
 tion on the argument that, in
 addition to the problem of con-
 trol of a European force, such
 a force would be too costly.
 De:bre thus seemed to return
 to the argument of proportional-
 ity--a European force, to actual-
 ly deter, would have to be
 raised to the level of "the
 other super  powers."  This,
 Debr? thought, would be diffi-
 cult because the other Euro=
 pean nations would be unwilling  25X1
 to contribute the required finan-
 cial and scientific resources.
 De Gaulle's opposition to
 a European deterrent as a substi-
 tute for a French deterrent
 does .not, however, seem to
 preclude joint researbh, de-
 velopment, and targeting, as
 long as control of the resulting
 force remains national.  The
 extent of such joint effort
 largely remains to be worked
 out.  Future cooperation may
 be implied,  however, both by
 the nature of French - West
 German relations and by the
 prospect that Britain would be
 under increasing pressure--
 once admitted to the Common
 Market--to go along with any
 European deterrent.  The way
 such cooperation develops will
 directly affect the relation-    25X1
 ship of the French deterrent
 to the Atlantic alliance.

 Greek trade with the USSR
 and its European satellites has
 nearly tripled since 1955. The
 bloc offers good prices for
 Greek agricultural exports and
 delivers oil,  lumber,  and manu-
 factures at bargain rates.            As
 a result bloc trade is a higher
 percentage of total trade in
 Greece than in any other NATO
 country--some 22 percent of ex-
 ports and 11 percent of imports
 Both the Athens government and
 Greek businessmen are concerned
 about this situation at a time
 when the country is negotiating
 for continued Western aid and
 its association with the Common

 of Greece's foreign trade.
 Greek agriculture, which is just
 beginning to enjoy the benefits
 of increased productivity com-
 birted with access to markets,
 could be thrown into a serious
 slump if it were suddenly cut

 The agreements with bloc purchas-
 ing commissions save costs of
 standardization, packaging, and
 sales promotion which Greece
 would have to bear if it tried
 to compete in Western markets.
 Athens recognizes, however,
 the dangers inherent in letting
 Greek imports of machinery
 and transportation equipment from
 the Soviet Union have not yet
 reached levels where they compete
 seriously with imports from the
 West, but they may come to do so
 as a result of aggressive bloc
 selling.   The Soviets,  for example,
 have captured a significant part of,
 the Greek ball-bearing market
 by engaging in a price war with
 the American firm which has been
 the traditional major supplier.

 The Soviets and Czechs
 have also attempted to tie their
 purchases of Greek products to
 the sale of their own goods in
 Greece, particularly transpor-
 tation equipment and tractors.
 While the export schedules of
 trucks and tractors can be in-
 creased or decreased on short
 notice,  the supply of perishable
 Greek agricultural products does
 not respond as readily to con-
 trol measures.
 In general, the quality of
 Soviet exports to Greece is in-
 ferior to similar Western prod-
 ucts, and private Greek import-
 ers often prefer the Western
 goods even though they are some-
 what more costly.   The Soviets
 realize that their advantage
 lies almost entirely in lower
 prices, at least for the present,
 and they are evidently willing
 to place as much emphasis as
 necessary on the price factor
 in their effort to gain a key
 position in the Greek market.
 Recent Developments
 Greek officials held talks
 this spring with representatives
 of the Soviet Union,  Czechoslo-
 vakia,  and Bulgaria.   The Greeks
 recognize the importance of the
 USSR as a trading partner,  and
 the discussions held in Moscow
 during April were conducted in
 a friendly and businesslike
 manner.   The Soviets,  evidently
 anxious about the trade impli-
 out, that the two commodities--
 petroleum and lumber--which
 account for about 90 percent of
 Soviet exports to Greece would
 not be affected by Greek-EEC
 tariff arrangements, but the
 Soviets showed great sensitivity
 about future sales of their
 machinery and automobiles.
 Trying to allay Soviet fears
 without actually granting most--
 favored=nation status to Soviet
 goods,  the Greeks signed a
 vaguely worded trade protocol
 promising to negotiate any dif-
 ficulties that might arise'in the
 future.
 In the negotiations with
 Bulgarian representatives during
 May,  discussion was confined
 chiefly to the setting of certain
 quotas on the export-import com-
 modity list.   The talks took
 place in a relaxed atmosphere,
 no special problems arose,  and
 the Bulgarians made no reference
 to the EEC. They suggested that
 direct rail and telecommunication
 links between the two countries
 be re-established, but the Greeks
 indicated that this matter was
 not ripe for decision.
 The talks with the Czechs,
 however,  have been described by
 Greek officials  as "the most
 difficult and arduous ever."
 Negotiations nearly broke down
 at the outset over Greek in-
 sistence on settlement of some
 pre - World War II claims.   The
 Czechs were unyielding on this
 point,  and in the end the exist-
 cations of Greece's association                                     ing trade protocol was extended
 with the EEC, made a strong re-                 for only one year.   The Czechs

 for assurances that their prod-
 ucts would receive preferential
 treatment.     The Greeks thereupon
 returned to their demand for
 settlement of their 1939 claims,
 and the meetings closed on a
 sour note.
 Greek Policy
 On the basis of this and
 previous experience, Athens'
 policy now is that if trade with
 the bloc can be expanded on a
 competitive basis, the Greek
 Government will not interfere.
 Certain inducements will continue
 to be offered to bloc or any
 other trading partners who ac-
 cept important quantities of
 "soft" goods--such as citrus
 fruit--which are difficult to
 sell on a competitive basis,
 but these concessions will be
 kept at a minimum.   A firm policy,
 based on customs clearancecertif-
 icates,   will be followed in an
 effort to prevent re-export of
 Greek goods.   Export quotas for
 "hard" products--such as bauxite
 --which Greece can sell competi-
 tively in the world market have
 been established with reference
 to the bloc countries and will
 be enforced strictly, but no
 import quotas are set up in
 bilateral trading.
 Prospect
 Greece is already heavily
 dependent on bloc purchases for
 sale of its agricultural prod-
 ucts.                     This dependence may be
 gradually overcome when the ef-
 fects of association with the
 EEC take hold, but there is no
 immediate prospect of reducing
 it by shifting production to
 other commodities or developing
 other markets.   Even though
 earnings of Western foreign ex-
 change from tourism,  shipping,
 and expatriate remittances are
 increasing    rapidly--thereby re-
 ducing Greece's overall depend-
 ence on the bloc in a purely
 economic sense--Greece is basi-
 cally a rural country,  and main-
 taining a high level of agricul-
 tural exports remains a major
 political problem.
 On the import side, the
 sale of bloc petroleum prod-
 ucts, particularly crude oil,
 is the most serious form of
 -market penetration so far,
 because they compete with
 ,the Western products in both
 qua'Lity and price.   Soviet
 oil thus far shipped to Greece
 has also been a relatively
 sweet crude, very desirable
 from the standpoint of re-
 fining.   The USSR may attempt
 to improve its position in
 the petroleum market during
 the next round of trade talks,
 .and Western interests may have
 to offer substantial induce-
 ments to maintain their pres-
 ent share of the market.
 Even if the bloc's
 share of overall trade de-
 clines in percentage terms,
 Greece will probably con-
 tinue for many years to be
 the NATO member with the
 highest proportion of its
 trade in bloc hands.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The question of membership
 in the Common Market (EEC) has
 stirred'Norway, and to a lesser
 extent Denmark, more than any
 other issue since these countries
 chose to join NATO in 1949.   In
 Denmark, majority opinion strong-
 ly favors EEC membership, but in
 Norway a powerful minority led
 by agricultural and fishing in-
 terests--with the support of cer-
 tain religious groups--is op-
 posed.
 This opposition has been
 the principal factor in the de-
 cision supported by all Norwegian
 political parties to hold an ad-
 visory referendum once the terms
 of membership have been negotiated.
 In the meantime,  the Norwegian
 Government is proceeding with
 steps preparatory to joining.
 On 4 July Foreign Minister Lange
 made his initial presentation
 to the EEC authorities in Brus-
 sels reaffirming that Norway ac-
 cepts the general objectives of
 the Rome Treaty but citing the
 special problems of Norwegian
 agriculture and fisheries.
 Led by the farming and
 fishing interests,  anti-EEC ele-
 ments have met with considerable
 success by appealing to the latent
 isolationism and nationalism
 of many Norwegians who are fear-
 ful that their infant manufac-
 turing industries will be over-
 whelmed by the giant industrial
 groupings within the EEC.  They
 have sought to broaden their
 attack by raising the specter
 of domination by "Roman Catholic
 continental powers" and by pic-
 turing Norway's close association
 with the former colonial powers
 as detrimental to relations with
 the Afro-Asian countries.
 A Gallup poll last spring
 showed Norwegian public opinion
 closely divided on the question
 of EEC membership, while a simi-
 lar, poll showed Danish opinion
 heavily favorable.   The relative
 success of the anti-EEC campaign
 in Norway appears to have con-
 vinced the government of the
 necessity to press the case for
 Norway's membership more vigor-
 ously and to educate public
 opinion on the necessity for
 such a step.   Both sides now are
 concentrating on their prepara-
 tions for the advisory referendum.
 Within the Labor government
 and its following there appears
 to be some concern about the po-
 sition of a socialist Norway,
 with its emphasis on a planned
 economy and a cradle-to-grave
 social welfare system,  in an or-
 ganization most of whose govern-
 ments pursue more conservative
 economic policies.   In addition,
 officials in both Norway and Den-
 mark want to be assured that EEC
 membership for these two will
 not adversely affect broad areas
 of existing cooperation among
 all four Nordic countries,  such
 as in their common labor market
 and in the application of social
 welfare benefits.
 These officials recognize
 that under present conditions
 Sweden will not seek full mem-
 bership in the Common Market
 and instead must negotiate an
 associative arrangement with
 the Six.   They maintain that
 concessions on the EEC's part
 must be generous enough to
 prevent isolating Sweden eco-
 nomically from Western Europe,
 since this would create serious
 political problems for all of
 the northern countries.   This
 would be particularly true of
 Finland, which may be forced
 to seek a kind of remote asso-
 ciation with the Six through
 Sweden if Moscow objects to
 even a tenuous tie with the
 EEC.

 Carlos Julio Arosemena
 Monroy became president on 8
 November 1961 when the stormy
 fourth administration of Jose
 Maria Velasco Ibarra came to
 an abrupt end.  Velasco had
 incurred the wrath of virtual-
 ly every important interest in
 the country by reneging on his
 promises and commitments, and
 he fled into exile after a period
 of asylum in a foreign embassy.
 Arosemena moved from the
 vice presidency to the presi-
 dency with the support of the
 leftists, most of the armed
 forces, and certain parties of
 the center-right.   Many con-
 servatives initially viewed his
 ascent to power with consider-
 able apprehension, primarily
 because of his widely publicized
 stand on the need for reforms
 in taxation and land tenure,
 but his first cabinet was basi
 cally nonleftist and included
 representatives of every polit-

 Conservative fears were further
 assuaged by Arosemena's reso-

 degeneration which Velasco's
 fiscal mismanagement had pro-
 duced.   Unpopular but necessary
 import restrictions were put
 into effect, an emergency'budg-

 were not pleased, however, with

 leftist supporters.   Several
 leftists received high-level
 posts in the administration, in-
 cluding two on Arosemena's per-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 continued to grow until Arose-
 mena broke diplomatic relations
 with Cuba, and with Poland and
 Czechoslovakia as well,  on 2
 April.   He also replaced three
 of the more conservative members
 of his cabinet with political
 moderates who,  like Arosemena,
 favored the reform programs
 which had long been delayed
 in their ministries.   By his
 delaying tactics, Arosemena
 seemingly strengthened his
 position.
 However, anti-Cuban and
 anti-Communist sentiment had
 increased sharply during the
 previous four months because
 of disclosures of subversive
 activities by Castroites and
 extreme leftist groups.  Anti-
 leftist sentiment became strong-
 er still when members of the
 Communist-front Union of Revo-
 lutionary Youth of Ecuador
 (URJE) staged an abortive "guer-
 rilla revolt" on 5 April in
 the mountains near Quito.   The
 army crushed the uprising and
 captured the rebels in less
 than two days of sporadic fight-
 ing.
 Military leaders continued
 to demand that Arosemena "rid
 his government of leftists"--
 specifying, among others, two
 members of his administrative
 staff.  The pressure from the
 military leaders became so dis-
 tasteful to Arosemena that in
 mid-May he discharged his minis-
 ter of defense and the top com-
 manders of the army and the
 air force.  Three other minis=
 ters resigned two days later,
 and all were speedily replaced
 with independent rightists who
 seemed likely to speed up Aro-
 semena's reform programs.
 The congressional elections
 of 3 June were a clear victory
 for the rightists, the more-conserv-
 ative  of whom will tend to op-
 pose Arosemena's reform policies.
 Arosemena nevertheless has re-
 tained considerable freedom of
 action by forming his cabinet of
 individuals not subject to party
 control.  Although the ministers
 are all anti-Communist,  they are
 more reform-minded than either
 their predecessors or the new
 congress.   Probably their nonpar-
 tisan backgrounds will enable them
 to enlist the support of the in-
 dependents--who may control the
 balance of power in Congress--
 and thereby avoid a direct clash
 between the Congress and the
 President.                                25X1
 The rightists are being
 aidied, probably unwittingly, by
 leftists and Communists, who
 bel eve Arosemena has "sold out"
 to  hThe right.  The leftists are
 encouraging labor unrest and
 inciting a widespread wave of     25X1
 strikes, a maneuver they used
 effectively to discredit Velasco
 in 1961.
