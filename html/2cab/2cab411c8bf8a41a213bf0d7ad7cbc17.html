 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 For the present King Hus-
 sain has gained the initiative
 in the two-week-old Jordan
 crisis by calling Bedouin
 fighting units of the army in-
 to action.  With their help he
 forestalled an attempt by former
 army chief of staff Nuwar to
 move against him last week end,
 and has now obtained a "nation-
 al cabinet," under the premier-
 ship of a relatively conserva-
 tive nationalist, Dr. Hussain
 Khalidi.
 The new cabinet consists
 mostly of independents who
 represent old-line interests,
 The king probably regards this
 cabinet as a stopgap, to be
 replaced shortly with a more
 effective conservative group
 once he has consolidated his
 control over the army.  West
 Jordan, the country's most
 populous region and center of
 anti-Western, left-wing atti-
 tudes, has several representa-
 tives in the cabinet, including
 the prime minister.
 Although the previous
 premier, Nabulsi, is a member
 of the new cabinet as minister
 of foreign affairs and communi-
 cations, the king has apparent-
 ly succeeded in breaking up the
 coalition of four left-wing
 political parties which domi-
 nated the Nabulsi cabinet and
 the legislature.  Nabulsi ap-
 pears to have lost support of
 the ultranationalist Baath,
 which is probably Jordan's most
 effective party, and 'also lacks
 full support from his own Na-
 tional Socialists,  The key
 cabinet posts of defense and
 interior, moreover, are held by
 relatively moderate nationalists.
 The army remains the locus
 of power in Jordan, and the
 king's most important task is
 to gain and hold complete con-
 trol over it.  Most of the
 king's army supporters are
 Bedouins of East Jordan, who
 form the heart of the combat
 units of the 25,000-man Jorda-
 nian army.  Strong nationalist
 elements remain, however, who
 resent the king's use of the
 militant Bedouin minority in
 an attempt to dominate the arm
 and the country
 Major General Hiyari, a
 moderate nationalist and an
 experienced and relatively
 nonpolitical officer, now com-
 mands the army.  The police are
 under the general control of
 the army.
 King Hussain must now also
 attempt to win and hold the
 support of a turbulent popula-
 tion, the majority of which
 supports Nabulsi's brand of
 anti-Western nationalism and
 favors federation with Syria
 and Egypt.  Although the de-
 cisive action has taken place
 in and around Amman, the reac-
 tion of West Jordan's dominant
 population of anti-Western and
 antimonarchical Palestinian

 GREEK-TURKISH RELATIONS AT BREAKING POINT OVER CYPRUS
 Greek-Turkish relations
 are now at their most critical
 juncture since the anti-Greek
 riots in Turkey in September
 1955.  Ankara evidently be-
 lieves London is weakening on
 the Cyprus issue, despite re-
 cent British assurances to the
 contrary, and the Turks are
 consequently assuming the lead
 in opposing Athens' policy of
 support for Greek-Cypriot pro-
 ponents of the union of Cyprus
 with Greece.   Recent Turkish
 moves suggest the possibility
 of new anti-Greek violence in
 Turkey, which could result in
 the severing of Greek-Turkish
 diplomatic relations.
 American officials in
 Ankara expect Turkey soon will
 make some dramatic move in re-
 sponse to the elaborate recep-
 tion of Archbishop Makarios in
 Athens on 17 April.   The secre-
 tary general of the Turkish
 Foreign Ministry read a sharply
 worded note to the Greek charge
 on 14 April charging Greece with
 a "hostile attitude" toward Tur-
 key and warning Athens against
 "ostentatious manifestations"
 in connection with Makarios' ar-
 rival.  The demarche included
 a warning that Turkey reserved
 the right to determine its future
 cou4e "in accordance with the
 exigencies of the situation"
 and Greece would be responsible
 for "all that might occur."
 The same official told the
 American charge on 15 April
 that the Turkish people would
 be permitted to "let off steam"
 in a "carefully controlled re-
 action which would not be al-
 lowed to get out of hand."  In
 addition, recent official Turkish
 statements and press attacks
 on the Greek community and
 ,patriarchate  in Istanbul sug-
 gest that Ankara contemplates
 some further anti-Greek move,
 possibly a new capital levy
 aimed at driving the Greeks
 from Istanbul or the outright
 expulsion of the Greek com-
 munity with or without the
 patriarchate itself.
 Athens rejected the Turk-
 ish demarche, which Prime Min-
 ister Karamanlis characterized
 as "insolent and unbearable."
 Foreign Minister Averoff be-
 lieves the Turkish demarche was
 Ankara's answer town earlier
 Greek request for assurances
 regarding the security of the
 Istanbul Greeks in view of
 rumors that new disturbances
 were imminent.  Karamanlis told
 Ambassador Allen on 15 April
 that he would have to break
 diplomatic relations with Tur-
 key and order mobilization if
 the Turks again used violence
 against Greeks in Istanbul..
 However, the American army
 attache in Athens reported on
 16 April that Greek military
 authorities were not "unduly
 concerned" over possible Turkish
 reactions and were "vigilant
 and calm."
 In his first statement on
 reaching Athens, Makarios
 pledged to continue the struggle
 for "self-determination" and
 praised those EOKA members who
 had died fighting the British.
 The Greek government, however,
 hopes to moderate Makarios' at-
 titude.
 The president of the Greek
 par]Liament told the American
 embassy on 16 April that the
 Greek government is "fairly
 confident" it can get Makarios
 "under control" in the next few
 days, provided there are no
 further provocative statements
 or acts on the part of Turkey.
 He added that the government
 would publicly oppose Makarios
 if the archbishop refuses to
 adopt a moderate position, but
 this assurance is probably in-
 tended to gain time while Athens
 seeks to ward off dangerous
 developments.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 18 April 1957
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 SOVIET TACTICS AT THE LONDON DISARMAMENT MEETING
 At the end of the first
 month of the UN Disarmament Sub-
 committee's current session,
 Western delegates are optimis-
 tic that the USSR is preparing
 the ground to offer a limited
 agreement.   The Soviet delegate,,
 however, is continuing to in-
 sist on a ban on nuclear weapons
 tests as a key element of such
 an agreement.
 Soviet delegate Zorin has
 taken pains to convince the
 Western representatives that
 the USSR is serious in its ef-
 forts, and the top-ranking
 British and French delegates
 believe Moscow is "keen for some
 sort of agreement,"  Zorin has
 avoided the usual polemics and
 propaganda and stressed the im-
 portance of finding "points of
 contact" between the Soviet and
 American positions,
 Zorin told the American
 delegate on 11 April that after
 the subcommittee has completed
 discussion of the remaining four
 points of the seven-point agenda,
 the Soviet delegation would be
 ready to consider drafting pro-
 visions for a limited agreement.
 In private talks with the Ameri-
 can and French delegates last
 week, Zorin.~outlned the USSR's
 concept of the main elements to
 be included.  He informed the
 American delegate on 11 April
 that the Soviet 18 March proposal
 for the elimination of all nu-
 clear weapons is "separable"
 from other proposals and not es-
 sential for a limited agreement
 on the reduction and control of
 armaments.
 Zorin also said the USSR
 is ready to agree to include a
 limited aerial inspection plan
 but warned it would not accept
 aerial inspection of the entire
 USSR prior to initiation of a
 general system of armaments re-
 duction and control.  He insist-
 ed  the United States must agree
 to make a general aerial in-
 spection a "separable" part of
 its plan if there is to be a
 limited agreement.
 Zorin told French delegate
 Mach on 13 April that because
 of American objections, a
 limited agreement would not have
 to include elimination of nu-
 clear weapons and all foreign
 bases.  At the same time he
 stressed to the British and
 French delegates the importance
 of  troop reductions in Germany,
 Zorin, however, made it
 clear in his talk with the
 American delegate that the USSR
 considers a moratorium or ces-
 sation of nuclear tests to be
 an essential part of a limited
 agreement, although it need not
 be in the precise form proposed
 by the Soviet Union.  This in-
 sistence on a test ban was also
 evident in Zorin's criticisms
 of the American plan on nuclear
 arms control.
 He attacked the US proposal
 to, .end nuclear weapons produc-
 tion in 1958 on the ground that
 it would not eliminate such
 weapons and would leave open the
 possibility of producing more
 weapons from existing nuclear
 stockpiles even after the plan
 went into effect.  He argued
 that the American plan would
 neither ensure a reversal of the
 present nuclear trend nor end
 the armaments race.
 The Soviet delegate assured
 the American representative on
 12 April that the US proposals
 were being given serious con-
 sideration in Moscow, and that

 18;" April'
 if he did not have Moscow's
 answer before the Easter recess,
 he would have it immediately
 thereafter.  The USSR's reply
 will probably recall that the
 Soviet 18 March plan provided
 for halting the manufacture of
 nuclear weapons in 1959 in re-
 sponse to American views but
 contend that a test ban is a
 necessary first step toward a
 general agreement on the con-
 trol, reduction and eventual
 elimination of such weapons.

 The position of Pakistan's
 President Mirza and Prime Min-
 ister Suhrawardy has been
 strengthened by the National
 Assembly's approval on 16 April
 of a motion to extend Presi-
 dent's Rule in West Pakistan
 until 20 September.   Prime Min-
 ister Suhrawardy was supported
 by a vote of 44 to 23 with four
 abstentions.  On 13 April the
 assembly had passed a resolu-
 tion approving the government's
 promulgation of direct rule four
 weeks ago.
 Dissolution of the West
 Pakistan assembly may require
 a constitutional amendment, and
 Suhrawardy will probably find it
 difficult to obtain the neces-
 sary two-thirds majority vote
 when the motion comes before
 the National Assembly.  Many
 members, particularly those
 representing the Awami League,
 now in power in East Pakistan,
 will probably be reluctant to
 enhance the president's power
 to dissolve provincial assem-
 blies.
 Because of the irreconcil-
 ability of the Republican Party
 and Moslem League leaders in
 West Pakistan, Suhrawardy and
 President Mirza reportedly have
 given up their attempts to ne-
 gotiate a national coalition
 which would have brought the
 Moslem League into both national
 and provincial governments.
 Efforts are being directed in-
 stead toward amalgamating the
 two parties which now form the
 central government coalition,
 the Republican Party sponsored
 by Mirza and Suhrawardy's
 Awami. League.
 These defensive measures
 are apparently designed to off-
 set Suhrawardy's weakened posi-
 tion in East Pakistan, where
 the East Pakistan Awami League
 has still not acted on pro-
 Communist Maulana Bhashani's
 offer to resign as president.
 As long as the prime minister
 is unable to gain the upper
 hand over the rival Bhashani
 forces in his party, his posi-
 tion as national leader will
 remain insecure.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 18 April 1957
 INDIA RELAXES RESTRICTIONS ON PRIVATE FOREIGN INVESTORS
 The Indian government is
 relaxing its earlier restric-
 tions on private foreign in-
 vestment because of India's
 growing foreign exchange crisis,
 Several foreign firms have al-
 ready taken advantage of the
 improved terms and plan to es
 tablish factories in India;
 other firms are negotiating with
 the Indian government.
 The secretary of the Minis-
 try of Heavy Industries -announced
 on  23  January  that imports
 of capital goods generally will
 not be licensed unless they are
 financed in such a way as. to
 avoid the expenditure of foreign
 exchange, and suggested that
 importers should try to secure
 foreign capital investment at
 least equal in value to the
 cost of the imported equipment.
 The American embassy doubts that
 such a policy statement could
 have been made until recently,
 and considers it a significant
 indication of New Delhi's desire
 for foreign private investment.
 This change in attitude
 has already been reflected in
 India's action on specific mat-
 ters affecting foreign investors.
 Several foreign firms have been
 given permission to hold the ma-
 jority interest in factories
 they plan to establish, where-
 as in the past new firms gener-
 ally had to be controlled by
 Indian nationals.   Indian offi-
 cials have also indicated a--willingness to allow foreign
 companies to establish an alumi.-
 num  factory and a shipyard,
 despite their earlier intention
 to have these undertakings run
 by the government.
 Several foreign firms have
 already agreed to establish
 factories in India since the
 inauguration of this new policy..
 These include manufacturers of
 pharmaceuticals, carbon black,
 chemicals, and machinery;  in
 addition, firms engaged in the
 production of rubber products,
 starch,  cement machinery, alumi.-
 num, and petroleum refining are
 negotiating about setting up or
 expanding plants.   India ap-
 parently is encouraged by the
 response to its new policy,.and
 is likely to take further steps
 to attract other foreign in-
 vestors.
 PATHET LAO STEPS UP MILITARY. ACTIVITY
 The Pathet Lao has recent-
 ly intensified military activ-
 ity in Sam Neua and Phong Saly
 Provinces.   Two Pathet.attacks
 launched between 8 and 11 April
 have been described as the
 heaviest in recent months.   In
 the face of this pressure, the
 Laotian army reportedly has
 abandoned three outposts, and
 the fate of a fourth is in doubt.
 Canadian members of the Interna-
 tional Control Commission fear
 general hostilities my. break out
 as a result of such skirmishing,
 The Pathets reportedly have
 been strengthened by the re-
 entry into Laos of some of the
 Viet Minh cadres and heavy weap-
 ons withdrawn in 1956.   Pathet
 Lao strength in Sam Neua and
 Phong Saly Provinces is esti-
 mated at 4,500 and 1,800 re-
 spectively.

 Negotiations which had
 stalled in March when the gov-
 ernment refused to accede to
 quest economic aid from Commu-
 nist China were resumed on 6
 April.   At that time the nego-
 tiating commission issued a
 communique reaffirming all
 previous agreements concerning
 neutrality, a coalition govern-
 ment, special elections and a
 cease-fire.   The Pathets are
 now pressing for more conces-
 sions without offering any quid
 pro quo.
 It seems unlikely that the
 Pathets intend to launch all-
 out attacks while the prospect
 of a political settlement re-
 mains open, and their aggressive
 tactics apparently are designed
 to strengthen their position in
 the negotiations in Vientiane.
 Pathet attacks, however, may
 provoke government retaliation
 on such a scale that general
 hostilities could develop even-
 tually.
 Prospects for an improve-
 ment in Cambodia's political
 stability remain poor, despite
 Premier Sihanouk's confidence
 that his latest government will
 inject new life into the fal-
 tering administrative machinery.
 Sihanouk has announced an "ac-
 tion plan" to revive the nation-
 al economy and to combat other
 problems--such as foreign sub-
 version--which had increasingly
 plagued the preceding seven
 Sangkum governments.   Given
 Sihanouk's preference for ruling
 "from the wings," however, he
 is likely to relinquish open
 command after only a limited
 period of superficial reforms',
 and political inertia will re-
 turn.
 Sihanouk's new cabinet--
 his fourth since the general
 elections of September 1955--
 is not strong.   Its members are
 generally more conspicuous for
 their devotion to Sihanouk than
 for their professional compe-
 tence.   The cabinet appears
 especially ill-suited to carry
 out Sihanouk's proposal to over-
 haul Cambodia's trade and mone-
 tary policies.
 Serious discontent in the
 National Assembly over the scar-
 city of essential imports and
 a general low volume of business
 because of the government's
 stringent trade regulations and
 tight-money policies figured
 prominently in the overthrow of
 the previous San Yun cabinet
 on 27 March.   It is feared that
 to placate the assembly, Sihan-
 ouk may  overliberalize Cam-
 bodia's financial policies,  thus
 encouraging venality and under-
 mining the national economy over
 the long run.
 Sihanouk and most other
 Cambodian leaders still appear
 wedded to the concept of neu-
 trality in international af-
 fairs; Sihanouk has lately in-
 dicated, however,a growing

 awareness of the seriousness of
 Communist subversion internally.
 Henceforth he is likely to be
 less tolerant of local Commu-
 nist and local activities of
 bloc representatives in carry-
 ing out his intention to keep
 Cambodia from becoming a "wres-
 tling mat" in the East-West
 struggle.  Whether Cambodia's
 internal security can be restored
 without recourse to more strin-
 gent measures is problematical.
 A recent Hanoi broadcast warned
 of the danger occasioned by
 Cambodia's political instability,
 and blamed the frequent cabinet
 crises on the "maneuvers of those
 who want to sabotage the   utr     25X1
 ist policy of 'Cambodia."
 The current trip of Premier
 Cyrankiewicz to South Asia and
 the Far East was primarily in-
 tended to bolster Poland's inde-
 pendent position within the bloc
 and incidentally to further its
 economic interest.
 The Polish premier's visit
 in Communist China was clearly
 the high point of his Asian
 tour.   The treatment Peiping
 accorded Cyrankiewicz:and his
 delegation was even more cordial
 than that given the Czechs a
 month earlier.   Chou En-lai,
 Vice Premier Ho Lung, and polit-
 buro member, Peng Chen were on
 hand to greet the visitors.  At
 the banquet given in honor of
 the Poles, Mao Tse-tung himself
 welcomed the delegation and
 said:   "There is deep friend-
 ship between China and Poland.
 My wish is that everything in
 Poland should go well, that the
 solidarity of the socialist
 countries should become still
 stronger, and that the friend-
 ship between our two countries
 should grow from day to day."
 The joint communiqud issued
 on 11 April was a Chinese Com-
 munist endorsement of the Go-
 mulka regime and its moderate
 course.   The statement recorded
 Peiping's gratification with
 Polish Communist Party achieve-
 ments since last October, ap-
 plauded Gomulka's leadership
 and expressed confidence that
 the Poles will make "increasing-
 ly important contributions" to
 strengthening the "great family
 of socialist countries."
 In North Vietnam, the gov-
 ernment underscored Poland's
 support for its program.   In
 deference to Polish sensibili
 ties, the joint Vietnamese-
 Pol:Lsh communiqud,`in reviewing
 the international situation,
 avoided comment on the "counter-
 revolutionary" nature of the
 Hungarian revolution and Soviet
 intervention.  The
 joint communiqud issued
 by the Poles and North
 Korean Communists also
 followed the pattern
 set in Hanoi and Pei-
 ping in acceding to
 Polish views on inter-
 bloc: relations.  All
 three communiquds
 failed to mention the
 leading position of
 the Soviet Union in
 the bloc.
 In India, where in contrast
 to Khrushchev and Bulganin  he
 made an excellent impression,
 Cyrankiewicz played on the lead-
 ers' hope that Poland as a "so-
 cialist state," is evolving
 peacefully toward genuine inde-
 pendence from Soviet hegemony.
 Appealing to neutralist and
 nationalist elements, he claimed
 that Poland supported Soviet
 policies only to protect its

 is scheduled to arrive in Vienna
 on 23 April for a five-day vis

 Russians will reduce the repara-
 tions burden.  At the same time,
 they fear Mikoyan will charge
 that Austria has been behaving
 in a manner incompatible with
 its neutral status under the
 treaty of 1955.
 Austrian officials have
 for some time been hoping for
 a reduction in the large rep-
 arations due the USSR under the
 1955 treaty.  The deliveries

 that particularly hurt
 are the 1,000,000 tons
 of oil a year, because
 Austrian oil output is
 declining markedly and
 reserves are now esti-
 mated at only 58,000,-
 000 tons instead of
 80,000,000.  Should
 Chancellor Raab obtain
 some alleviation of the
 burden, he might im-
 prove the prospects of
 the People's Party
 candidate in the 5 May
 presidential election.  With
 this in view, Raab is probably
 prepared to give careful con-
 sideration to any trade proposals
 Mikoyan may make.
 Mikoyan's attitude may have
 been forecast by an Izvestia
 article of 13 April, -wh cfi'-
 called on Austria to observe
 "honest neutrality" regarding
 "allLquestions that might have

 Austria's treaty status.  Aus-

 that their neutrality has noth-

 tudes, but extends only to mili-
 tary matters.   In the latter
 realm, Austrian defense minister
 Graf announced on 12 April that
 Austrian officers would be sent
 to both NATO and Soviet bloc
 countries for training.
 Some Austrian officials
 believe Austria has in fact
 been needlessly provoking Moscow.
 Austria made no secret of its
 anti-Soviet feeling last fall
 when it held open its border to
 Hungarian refugees and gave
 theca all possible aid.  This

 WEST GERMAN-SOVIET RELATIONS AND THE REPATRIATION QUESTION
 The USSR has been
 trying to convince Germans of
 all political persuasions that
 it would make concessions lead-
 ing to reunification if Bonn
 withdrew from NATO and adopted
 a policy of neutrality.
 Repatriation talks began
 in Moscow last February between
 Soviet Red Cross chief Miterev
 and Heinrich Weitz, head of
 the West German Red Cross,  and
 are expected to resume in Bonn
 next month.   The main obstacle
 to an agreement is the Soviet
 claim to the right to determine
 the nationality of the 75,000-
 100,000 Germans believed to be
 held in the USSR.   Moscow main-
 tains that all German citizens
 have been repatriated and those
 remaining have taken Soviet
 citizenship and do not qualify.
 Bonn insists that the Germans
 still in the USSR were removed
 from Germany after the war,
 and are being denied the right
 to contact the German embassy
 in Moscow.
 Miterev told Weitz during
 the February talks that faster
 progress on the repatriation
 question could be made if a
 German-Soviet consular agree-
 ment were reached, and that
 conclusion of a trade agreement
 would lead Moscow to take a
 more lenient interpretation on
 the nationality question.   Mos-
 cow also wants the return of
 an estimated 15,000 Russians
 in the Federal Republic.   Bonn
 holds that all refugees wishing
 to return to the USSR have done
 so, but agrees to their having
 another opportunity to signify
 their desires before a mixed
 German-Soviet Red Cross team,
 probably this summer.
 In general, however, Mos-
 cow seems much less interested
 in the repatriation problem
 tha:ri in the broader talks on
 German-Soviet relations which
 are expected to start in Mos-
 cow next month.   The Russians
 apparently hope that these
 talks and their overtures to
 Bonn will raise issues in West
 Germany that will bolster neu-
 tralist strength in the Septem-
 ber election.

 SOVIET BALTIC REGIMES ADOPT PUNITIVE MEASURES AGAINST YOUTH
 Passive resistance through-
 out the Baltic republics of the
 USSR is reported to have in-
 creased in the months since the
 Hungarian revolution,  and a
 number of students have been ar-
 rested in Lithuania for staging
 anti-Russian demonstrations.
 Latvia and Estonia have adopted
 repressive legislation, aimed
 primarily at "antisocial and
 parasitical" elements among the
 youth, providing for imprison-
 ment and exile of persons who
 refuse to engage in socially
 useful work.
 Both party and government
 officials in the Baltic states
 have evinced increasing concern
 over the political unreliability
 and the dissatisfaction of youth
 since the events in Hungary last
 November.  Up to now, however,
 the Latvian and Estonian parties
 had relied on tightened party
 discipline and increased ideo-
 logical and mass educational
 work to overcome dissidence.
 Both have now passed laws which
 will remove idle youth from the
 cities and help prevent the
 formation of dissident groups.
 In late February, the Lat-
 vian Supreme Soviet decreed that
 persons who had been unemployed
 for three months must leave the
 cities of Riga and Liepaya with-
 in ten days or go to Jail for
 periods of one to three years.
 The law specifically excludes
 legitimate dependents.   A simi-
 lar but sterner decree was pub-
 lished for "discussion" in Es-
 tonia last week.   With no pro-
 vision for a grace period,  it
 calls for deportation of unem-
 ployed persons to the country-
 side for periods of two to five
 years, with "compulsory work"
 at the place of exile.
 Offenders are faced with
 the alternative of finding im-
 mediate employment in industry
 or of working in agriculture,
 a choice Baltic youths have gen-
 erally avoided.   Living condi-
 tions on Baltic collective farms
 are reputed among the worst in

 TRENDS TOWARD INDEPENDENCE IN FRENCH BLACK AFRICA
 France's present policy
 of limited internal autonomy
 for its extensive Black African
 holdings was given endorsement
 by legislative elections on
 31 March in 13 of these terri-
 tories.  However, even moderate
 African nationalists evidently
 do not regard this as a perma-
 nent solution, and French offi-
 cials believe that present po-
 litical trends will result in
 independence for French Africa
 south of the Sahara within two
 to seven years.
 In Madagascar,, the relative
 electoral success of extreme
 nationalists may portend early
 difficulties for any French
 program short of independence.
 Many of the moderate national-
 ists in other territories are
 basically sympathetic to de-
 mands for an early and drastic
 revision of the French Union
 to provide full equality of
 membership within a federal
 framework.

 France would accede to African
 wishes in case of a conflict
 over the timetable for inde-
 pendence.   Political consider-

 ELECTIONS
 Elections on Taiwan for
 city mayors, county magistrates,
 and provincial assemblymen--
 the highest-level elections held
 by the Chinese Nationalist gov-
 ernment--will take place on 21
 April.  Although,there are re-
 ports.of anti-Kuomintang sen-
 timent in the cities, govern-
 ment candidates are unopposed
 in several areas, and most con-
 tests are expected to be domi-
 nated by the Kuomintang, as in
 the past..   Two "captive" opposi-
 tion parties are running only
 a few candidates.
 Elections on Taiwan are
 conducted on the assumption that
 basic issues such as anti-Cpm-
 mun:ism and the return to the
 mainland have already been de-
 cided, and that local elections
 serve merely as a means by which
 persons-are chosen to help ad-
 minister '. these  policies.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 18' April 1957
 El Salvador
 The most notable Communist
 gains in the past six months
 have occurred in El Salvador.
 The first national labor union
 congress was held there last
 month, and a small group of
 Communists, by exploiting ri-
 valries between the  inexpe
 rienced non-Communist leaders,
 was able to pass a number of
 pro-Communist resolutions and
 gain control of a committee
 charged'with drawing up the
 statutes for what would be the
 country's only national labor
 confederation...
 This development was made
 possible, at least in part, by
 the government's decision last
 autumn to permit the return of
 all political exiles and its
 simultaneous abrogation of an
 old anti-Communist law.   The
 government thus left itself
 without adequate legal basis
 to enforce the. constitutional
 proscription of Communist activ-
 ities.  Many of the returning
 exiles have had long experience
 in the Communist parties and
 labor movements of various Latin
 American countries, including
 those of Guatemala during the
 pro-Communist Arbenz regime.
 The inexperienced non-Communist
 labor leaders are no match for
 them.
 The administration of Lt.
 Colonel Jose Maria Lemus is
 firmly anti-Communist and, un-
 like its predecessor, is com-
 mitted to respect for the forms
 of democratic government. After
 last month's.labor conference,
 however, the minister of labor
 told the American embassy the
 government does not intend to
 permit the formation of a la-
 bor confederation under present
 circumstances.   The embassy
 believes the present plan to
 revise Salvadoran legal codes
 is related to the government's
 expressed determination to deal
 with subversive elements, not by
 simply exiling them as in the
 past but by prosecuting them
 in the courts.
 Honduras
 In Honduras, the Communists
 may also have made some gains
 in recent months.  The military
 junta which seized the govern-
 ment. last October quickly re-
 leased numerous political
 prisoners, including some
 Communists.  At least seven
 well-known Communists or pro-
 Communists have returned from
 exile   The Communists have
 succeeded in influencing student
 and some professional groups
 and are a continual threat to
 the country's major labor
 unions.  In general, however,
 the Honduran Communist Party,
 with, a maximum active member-
 ship of 600 and only about 500
 sympathizers, is a weak and
 immature organization.  It is
 dedicated to a policy of non-
 provocation, realizing that
 it needs a period of official
 toleration in order to develop
 and expand on a solid foundation.
 Guatemala
 The Guatemalan Labor (Com-
 munist) Party (PGT), which may
 have had as many as 4,000 mem-
 bers at its peak in 1954 when
 it was the leading member of
 the coalition backing the Arbenz
 regime, now is believed to have
 only 200 to 300 active members
 and perhaps 2,000 sympathizers.
 Despite almost three years of
 government repression, the PGT
 still has a fairly cohesive
 underground organization inside
 Guatemala and maintains` regular
 liaison with top Guatemalan
 Communists exiled in Mexico.
 The PGT continues to distrib-
 ute propaganda in Guatemala
 and exerts influence among
 bitterly antigovernment stu-
 dent groups.
 The government has per-
 mitted some Communists to re-
 turn from exile in recent months
 and is attempting to use certain

 Communist labor leaders in its
 effort to divide the labor move-
 ment and bring a segment of it
 under its control for political
 purposes.   The government-sup-
 ported Autonomous Union Federa-
 tion elected four suspected Com-
 munists to a committee to pre-
 pare May Day celebrations..
 Costa Rica
 The Popular Vanguard (Com-
 munist) Party (['VP) of Costa
 Rica is the most mature of the
 Central American Communist par-
 ties.   It has the closest ties
 with the world Communist move-
 ~m.ent, and the" weak parties in
 Panama and Nicaragua depend on
 it for guidance.   At least ten
 PVP members traveled to the
 Sino-Soviet bloc in 1956 to at-
 tend :meetings and indoctrina-
 tion courses.   The PVP-controlled
 General Confederation of Costa
 Rican Workers is the only Cen-
 tral American labor organization
 affiliated with the WFTU and the
 CTAL.
 On the domestic political
 scene,  the PVP, with an active.
 membership of some 200, has very
 little influence, and open al-
 liance with-it would be political
 suicide for any national politi-
 cal party.   However,  the bitter
 campaign now in progress for the
 February 1958 national elections
 may tempt either the administra-
 tion or the opposition to try to
 bargain covertly for Communist
 support in the belief that the
 Communists could swing several
 thousand votes.
 In the labor field, the
 Costa. Rican Communists are
 strongest among the United
 Fruit Company workers on the
 Pacific coast, where they have
 recently joined with a non-
 Communist labor organization
 to threaten a strike.   The gov-
 ernment,  anxious to avoid major
 labor disturbances in this
 election year, may well take
 strong measures to prevent a
 strike..
 Nicaragua
 A Communist Party does
 not exist as a disciplined
 organization in Nicaragua,
 where the strong regime of the
 late president Anastasio Somoza
 kept firm control over Commu-
 nist activities for many years.
 However,  Somoza thought he
 could use Communists at times
 for his own political ends and,
 consequently, there now are a
 few Communists in government
 agencies, labor unions, schools,
 and some professional organiza-
 tions.   An anti-Communist labor
 leader informed the American
 embassy last month that he has
 noted an increase in Communist
 activity in Managua, since the
 young Somoza succeeded his
 father last September.   There
 is also evidence of Communist     25X1
 leadership in the present labor
 disturbances at the Pacific
 coast port of Corinto.
 CURRENT FRENCH MILITARY PLANNING
 French military strength
 in Europe,  air-ady.severely
 diminished by withdrawals for
 operations in Algeria,       is like-
 ly to be further weakened by a
 proposed budgetary retrenchment.
 Therefore prospects for full
 restoration of the French con-
 tribution to the Western Euro-
 pean. defense are dwindling;
 France plans to reduce the num-
 ber of its NATO-committed divi-
 sions at. the end of 1357 and
 may be encouraged by British
 reorganization moves to modify
 its own army for atomic warfare.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 18' Apri l:,_ 1957
 Projected Budget Cuts
 Recommendations for drastic
 cuts in the national budget
 were set forth by Finance Min-
 ister Ramadier in February be-
 cause of the danger of infla-
 tion and because France's for-
 eign exchange deficit threatens
 to get.. out of control.   Defense
 expenditures have contributed
 to the current high level of
 French industrial activity, but
 have also aggravated France's
 economic difficulties--particu-
 larly with respect to foreign
 exchange shortages.   In 1956
 nearly 8 percent of. French im-
 ports originating outside the
 franc area represented purchases
 for military use.
 Although the total defense
 budget represents only 30,per-
 cent of the entire national
 budget, 40 percent of Ramadier's
 proposed cuts :would be in this,
 area.   The total 1957 defense
 budget is comprised of an
 "ordinary" budget of $2.86 bil-
 lion, which was voted at the
 end of December, and an "excep-
 tional" budget for Algerian and
 the November 1956 Suez opera-
 tions, not yet voted, but to
 be about $1 billion.
 A major fight in the Na-
 tional Assembly may develop
 after the Easter recess when
 the exceptional budget is pre-
 sented and details of the pro-
 posed retrenchments become
 known.
 Impact of the Projected Cuts
 The proposed cuts in the
 .ordinary defense budget would
 presumably be allotted propor-
 tionately between its "operat-
 ing" portion,  amounting to
 roughly' two thirds of the total,
 and its "capital" portion.
 French officials estimated in
 February that a major reduc-
 tion in the operating portion
 of the ordinary budget would
 require the demobilization of
 100,000 men, of which 65,000
 would be conscripts released
 because of a planned reduction
 of their active service period
 from 30 to 24 months.   Some
 demobilization will.probably
 take place in Tunisia and
 Morocco, where the French posi-
 tion is already weakened by
 recent transfers to the troubled
 Mauretania area.
 Any sizable slash in the
 capital segment would be even
 more serious than that in the
 operating portion.   The 1957
 capital budget had already been
 severely criticized by the as-
 sembly defense and other commit-
 ties as inadequate for minimum-
 build-up goals.   For example,
 the annual naval construction
 "'slice"" of 30,000 tons,  esti-
 mated as the absolute minimum
 for modernization of the French
 fleet by 1963, is down to 19,000
 tons for 1957, over half of
 which is taken up by a heli-
 copter carrier designed for
 "national," rather than NATO,
 requirements.  Although the
 navy proposes to compensate in

 1958 by laying down 49,000
 tons, a proposed new aircraft
 carrier would absorb most of
 this, leaving little for badly
 needed supply and landing craft.
 Similarly, air force con-
 centration on purchasing light
 aircraft and helicopters for
 use in Algeria, at the expense
 of fighter plane procurement,
 has already resulted in fail-
 ure to meet modernization
 schedules because of reduced
 production of the latest French
 interceptor aircraft,
 NATO Contributions
 During examination of the
 French reply to the 1956 NATO
 Annual Review Questionnaire in
 November, the French represent-
 ative told the North Atlantic
 Council that at the end of
 1957 France would reduce from
 17 to 14 the number of its
 NATO divisions and from five
 to four the number of these
 on an M-day status.   Three of
 these four M-day divisions
 would presumably be units ex-
 perimentally reorganized in
 1955 with fewer personnel.
 Although theoretically they
 possess more firepower and
 considerably more mobility
 than the American World War
 II-type large divisions, which
 are the pattern for most of
 France's NATO-committed units,
 they lack proper equipment and
 training.
 The Algerian rebellion
 has reduced the effective.
 French army contribution to
 the NATO "?shield" in West Ger-
 many to two understrength M-
 day divisions--one armored and
 one infantry.   These are the
 only French divisions in Eu-
 rope which could be combat ef-
 fective within 30 days.  De-
 spite official assurances that
 most of the 12 NATO-committed
 divisions now in North Africa
 could be readily redeployed to
 Europe, it is estimated that
 under wartime conditions no
 more than two could meet
 SHAPE's 30-day minimum period.
 In any event, all divisions
 in North  Africa would require
 refresher large-unit training
 before combat utilization in
 Europe, since they have been
 broken up for tactical use
 against guerrillas.
 Moreover, the necessity
 to withdraw NATO-pledged units
 in order to carry out North
 African operations has made
 Paris increasingly skeptical
 of the wisdom of committing
 the bulk of its forces to NATO.
 The only indication of an
 ultimate restoration of five
 French M-day divisions to NATO
 forces in Germany  is seen in
 a plan for "complete transfor-
 mation" of the French army an-
 nounced by the defense minister
 in February.   Few details have
 been made known thus far, but
 the plan calls for a total of
 nine or ten M-day divisions,
 five of which would be NATO units
 stationed in Germany and four
 or five highly mobile, air trans-
 portable units in France, either
 for NATO support or for national
 requirements outside metropoli-
 tan France.   The plan hinges
 on the evolution of the Alge-
 rian and financial situations,
 but was publicized with hints
 that it would begin this year.
 The United Kingdom's de-
 cision to proceed with a thor-
 ough military reorganization
 may encourage the French to
 proceed with their own plans.
 Parliamentary critics have al-
 ready called the 1957 budget
 "inadequate,'." and the deputies
 will. probably increasingly
 stress the importance of orient-
 ing French defense forces to-
 ward nuclear warfare, since
 they reportedly feel this would
 ensure greater security at less
 cost.   Since French production
 of the extra items required by
 new type units, such as heli-
 copters and jeeps, is insuffi-
 cient, any move to push reor-
 ganization this year would only
 complicate the problem of re-
 storing the French contribution
 to NATO defenses.

 .PROBLEMS IN THE SOVIET HIGHER EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM
 Moscow State University,       the
 largest and oldest university
 in the Soviet Union.   Like,
 other higher educational in-
 stitutes in the USSR,                       MGU is
 revising its admission require-
 ments and scholastic standards
 to weave the university system
 more closely into the economic
 life of the country.   It
 wants to remove as much as
 possible all qualities of an
 "ivory tower" existence, which
 the regime feels is the root
 of various present troubles,
 from evasion of responsibili-
 ties to questioning of the
 Soviet system.            _
 .   Party officials frequently
 complain to MGU students that
 they are too sheltered from
 life and "honest labor" and
 thus feel free to criticize
 the regime's policies and
 maintain an "aloof,  irre-
 sponsible attitude toward
 their obligations as Soviet
 citizens."   In effect Soviet
 students, with as yet no
 real-stake in the regime, are
 uncommitted to its aims and
 goals,  though not necessarily
 in opposition to them.   This
 situation has become increas-
 ingly acute as a result of the
 disappearance of the oppor-
 tunities for meteoric advance-
 ment which existed in the USSR
 in the 30's and 40's.
 Student Body
 There are over 18,000
 students enrolled at Moscow
 University, more than half in
 science courses.   About 1,500
 are foreign students,  princi-
 pally from the Satellites.
 Moscow University is
 generally considered the best
 university in the Soviet Union,
 and competition for admission
 is extremely stiff.   This com-
 petition has increased markedly
 in the last few years following
 the rapid extension of ten-
 year secondary education and
 the accompanying failure of
 the regime to convince many
 secondary school graduates--
 long conditioned to view a
 diploma as an automatic guaran-
 tee of admission to higher
 education--that they must
 resign themselves to going to
 work.
 .   The present student body
 at Moscow University represents
 an elite group,  socially,
 intellectually and politically.
 Over 90 percent of the students
 are members of the Communist
 youth organization, the
 Komsomol.
 While gifted children from
 poor working class families
 can and do gain admission,  the
 system favors children of the
 vast Soviet officialdom and
 intelligentsia.   Soviet
 spokesmen admit that it is
 these families that can afford
 the best primary education for
 their children,  can pay the
 high fees of professional
 crammers to ensure good results
 on the highly factual entrance
 examinations and can,  if these
 methods fail, use political
 influence.   Moscow University,
 in Short,  bears the stamp of
 a "bourgeois" academic institu-
 tion.
 About a third of the
 students are housed in fairly
 commodious quarters in a new
 dormitory at the university.
 A large number of the
 remaining resident students

 rent bunks in a large student
 barrack far on the other side
 of town.   This barrack was the
 scene of one of the first
 organized demonstrations
 against the college officials
 that Moscow University had
 seen in many years.   The stu-
 dents,            finally losing patience
 with the dismal. food at the
 dormitory,  put on a week-long
 and ultimately successful
 boycott and picket of the mess
 hall.
 Curriculum
 The university offers a
 five-year course of study and
 generally adheres to the
 curricula common to all Soviet
 universities.   Students must
 choose a specialty early in
 their college career.   There
 are few electives and attend-
 ance at classes is compulsory.
 The scholastic level is im-
 pressive,  at least in the
 scientific fields.   A student
 majoring in applied mathematics
 covers in his first two years
 the mathematics courses re
 quired for a bachelor degree
 at the Massachusetts Institute
 of `:''ethnology.
 In addition to the ex-
 tremely heavy scholastic load,
 students are expected to
 participate in various extra-
 curricular activities, many of
 which are considered obligatory
 for icomsomol members.   The
 students are subjected to
 numerous political lectures
 and study groups,  and various
 special assignments, such as
 Sunday work on construction
 sites or farms in and around
 Moscow or campaigning during
 3oviet elections.   These
 activities are extremely time
 consuming and there is appar-
 ently considerable complaining
 and evasion on the part of the
 students.
 The "spontaneous" student
 demonstrations before the
 Israeli,  French and British
 embassies in early 1Tc vomber
 were apparently such assign-
 Events in Eungary and
 Poland in October and November
 had a catalytic impact on Vie
 Moscow student, who was just
 then beginning to experiment
 with the exhilarating new
 freedom of open discussion
 and exchange of ideas.   Heated
 discussions developed, which
 in many cases led students to
 "heretical" conclusions.
 Ironically,  the students drew
 on their knowledge of Marxist-
 Leninist doctrine to frame
 their questions and sanction
 their conclusions.
 Some students concluded
 that the party bureaucracy in
 the USSR had become an ex-
 ploiting class by its actual,
 if not formal, control over
 the labor force, wages and
 machinery of justice.   From
 this a slogan for action,  the
 "Socialist Revolution Against
 the Pseudo-Socialist State,
 gained currency at the univer-
 sity.
 The physics department was
 especially affected, apparently
 because of the influence of
 its large number of Polish
 students.   Early in November
 some of the students held a
 meeting from which party mem-
 bers were excluded,  and passed
 a, resolution demanding the
 introduction of a second
 poliLtical party in the USSR
 and the liberation of the
 university discussion groups
 from political control.
 The regime quickly acted
 to remove the most serious
 troublemakers.   By the end
 of November,  200 students had
 been expelled,  officially be-
 cause of "failure to meet the
 study plan and poor discip-
 line."   Many of the others

 weight of official disapproval
 began to be felt.
 Many of the 200 Hungarian
 students were sent home for
 an indefinite period at the
 start of the New Year's vaca-
 tion and measures were taken
 to isolate and neutralize
 other Satellite students, par-
 ticularly those from Poland.
 There are unconfirmed reports
 that students from the Baltic
 republics were also sent home
 because of the outbursts of
 nationalist sentiment there
 and the fear that they might
 contaminate other students.
 New Policies
 Gradually over a period
 of months an apparently coher-
 ent long-range plan has emerged
 for meeting the'broad Prob-
 lem of unorthodox behavior and
 intellectual questioning among
 students,   Wide-scale repres-
 sive measures and direct pro-
 hibition of free discussion
 are avoided.   Instead, the re-
 gime seems to be banking on
 its ability to remove the con-
 ditions which it feels breed
 ferment through sweeping
 changes in the higher educa-
 tional system and stepped-up,
 more sophisticated propaganda
 indoctrination.
 Soviet officials have
 announced that beginning with
 the next academic year, up.to
 60 percent of all new univer-
 sity students must have had
 at least two years' experience
 in industry or agriculture or
 served in the armed forces.
 Various measures are being
 taken to ensure that these
 working youths receive pref-
 erential   treatment in pass-
 ing the entrance examinations.
 After graduating from uni-
 versities, unless accepted for
 further studies, students today
 must work for at least three
 years in their specialty at a
 place assigned by the state.
 Personal preference is taken
 into consideration only to a
 limited extent.  Growing dis-
 satisfaction with assignments
 and a desire of many students
 to work in large cities have
 led to a great increase in eva-
 sion, and Soviet universities
 are now threatening to withhold
 diplomas until after the work
 assignment has been completed.
 Furthermore, requirements for
 graduate study are to be tight-
 ened and two years' work ex-
 perience between college and
 graduate school required ex-
 cept in certain fields such as
 mathematics and theoretical
 physics.
 While many of these meas-
 ures have been under discussion
 for some time because of the
 rapid growth of the secondary
 school system and the changing
 needs of the economy, the ap-
 parent speed and determination
 with which they are now being
 introduced is apparently con-
 nected with official concern
 over student unrest.   Soviet
 spokesmen candidly express the
 hope that these changes will
 result in the admission of more
 mature and politically reliable
 persons who will have a practi-
 cal and dedicated interest in
 their chosen specialty and little
 inclination for theoretical
 wool--gathering.
 The projected measures by
 themselves do not appear suf-
 ficient to handle the poten-
 tially dangerous problem of
 student unrest.   Perhaps more
 than anything else the regime's
 success depends on its ability
 to provide the youth, along
 with an education, a vital stake
 in the future of the regime--
 to offer them greater opportu-
 nities for satisfying, reward-
 ing work.  The recent trend
 toward decentralization of ad-
 ministrative authority may help
 Dy OBI)
 to provide these opportunities,
