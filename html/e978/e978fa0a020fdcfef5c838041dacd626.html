			  	[Excerpts]    	For  many  years  now,  anti-Sovietism  has  fieem  elevated  to  the  rank  of
			  	state  policy  in  China.    	Bei~ing  leaders,  while  mouthing  their  adherence  to  the  ideals
			  	of  communism,  have  in  practice  conducted  a  policy  prodoundly  hostile  to  the  cause  of
			  	socialism,  both  within  the  country  and  in  the  world  arena,   	and  have  aimed  the  cutting
			  	edge  of  their  subaersive  policy  at  the  primary  force  of  the  world  socialist  system,
			  	the  Soviet  Union.    	This  cfrcumstance  ha~  necesaitated  thorough  atudy  of  the  history
    	.		    	of  the  Chinese  Cotmnunist  Party  (CCP)  and  ita  shift  from  revolutionary,  progressive

			  	hegemonistic,   	anti-Soviet  poliey.l    	Marxist  researchers  are  introducing  into  scienti-
			  	fic  circulation  ever  more  material  and  facts  on  the  events  which  hav~  been  of  great
			  	importance  to  the  destinies  of  the  Chinese  Co~nunist  Party,  to  ~hgp3ng  its  political
			 	course.    	Their  attention  continues  to  be  drawn  to  the  personality  of  Mao    	Zedong  and

	     	Political  Biography  of  Mao    	Zedong],   	(Moscow,   	1980),  made  a  substantial  contribution
 -	   	to  unmasking  the  antiparty  and  anti-Soviet  activity  of  Mao    	Zedong  and  his  allies  by
	     	demonstrating  that,   	throughout  his  CCp  activity,  Mao    	Zedong  always,  secretly  or  open-
 -	   	ly,  a3vocated  nationalistic  positiona,  waged  a  persistent  atruggle  against  the  inter-
	     	nationalist  wing  of  the  party,  propagatsd  his  own  suthority  in  every  waq  possible  and
	     	was  an  intransigent  enemy  of  Marxist-Leninist  teachings.    	This  article  examines  the
	     	re2sons  for  the  development  of  petty-bourgeois,  national~stic  tendencies  in  the  Chin-
	     	ese  Communist  P3rty  and  the  spread  of  Maoism  in  it.
	     	The  overall  sociaeconomic  backwardneas  of  China  predetermined  in  considerable  measure
 -	   	the  difficulties  and  con�licts  in  establishing  the  CCP.    	The  very  conditions  under
	     	which  the  Chinese  Communist  Party  was  formed  favored  the  activity  within  its  ranks  of
	     	elements  alienated  by  class  to  the  cause  ~f  proletarian  revoluCion  vnd  the  spread  in
			the  party  of  their  petty-bourgeois~  nationalistic  concepts.    	This  kind  of  theory  could
	     	have  arisen  and  existed  only  under  conditiona  of  isolation  of  the  broad  masses  o�  the
			party  from  the  experience  of  building  socialism  in  the  US5R  and  other  socialist  coun-
			tries,   	as  a  result  of  shameless  falsification  of  Marxist-Leninist  teachings  and  the
			substitution  of  home-grown,  petty-bourg~ois,  nationalistic  ideas  for  them.    	Hence,
			the  enmity  of  Mao    	Zedong  to  the  Soviet  Union  and  the  CPSU.    	The  fruitlessness  of  Mao-
			ist  theoxies  and  their  failure  on  contacz  with  real  life  were  also  predetermined  by
			the  methods  Mao    	Zedong  used  to  propagate  his  views.    	Inside  th~  country,   	they  in-
			cluded  the  pursuit  of  all  manner  of  heterodoxies  and  slander  against  the  Soviet  Un-
			ion,   	~the  CPSU  and  other  communist  Farties.    	In  foreign  policy,   	they  meant  a  bitter
			struggle  against  the  USSR  and  a  policy  of  hegetnony  in  relations  with  ather  states.
			At  the  start  of  this  centux'y,  China  was  a  backward,  agrarian  country.    	In  spi.te  of
			the  fact  that  the  development  of  a  capitalist  method  of  production  had  been  acceler-
			ating  the  breakdown  of  feudali~m  in  the  country  aince  the  lats  19th  Century,   	its  sur-
			vivals  were  very  strong,   	especially  in  rural  areas.    	Machine  industry,  belonging  gen-
			erally  to  foreign  capital,  was  concentrated  i.~  a  few  large  cities.    	Small,  primitive
			enterpriaes  predominated  in  industry,  by  and  large.    	The  class  structure  of  Chinese
		 	sociEty  reflected  *he  undeveloped,  backward  nature  of  the  country's  productive  forces.
		 	The  classes  and.social  strata  of  a  precapitalist  and  transition-to-capitalism  type
		 	comprised  the  overwhelming  ma~ority  of  the  Chinese  population,  at  least  90  percent  of
		 	whom  lived  in  rural  areas.    	The  peasantry,   	the  bulk  of  whom  were  landless  and  forced
		 	to  rent  land  on  cabalistic  terms  from  landownera  and  kulaks,  was  doomed  to  poverty.
		 	The  working  class  had  ~ust  begun  taking  ahape.    	A  ma~ority  of  the  workers,  recently
		 	arrived  from  the  countryside,  were  employed  at  unskilled  manual  labor.
   	-	    	In  view  of  this  concrete-historiral  circumatance,  V.   	I.  Lenin  thought  China  needed
		 	first  of  all  to  eliminate  feudal  survivals,  at  that  stage  of  its  development.    	Lenin
		 	wrote  that  the  working  class  of  China  was  not  yet  a  force  capable  of  leading  a  revo-
		 	lutionary  movement  in  the  country.
		 	The  overthrow  of  the  feudal-monarchic  aociety  as  a  result  of  the  1911-1913  Xinhai  re-
		 	volution  helped  strengthen  the  pos3tions  of  the  Chinese  national  bourgeoisie.    	In  the
		 	first  stage  of  the  revolution,   	the  bourgeoisie  promoted  general  democratic  slogans
		 	and,   	in  an  alliance  with  other  anti-feudal  and  anti-imperialist  forces,   	dominated  the

	    	percent  soldiers  and  officers  and  0.5  percent  petty  trades~nen.l	    	The  counter-
	    	revolutionary  overturn  of  1927  by  the  reactfonary  forces  of  Chin~  and  the  defeat  of
	    	the   	1925-1927  revolution  had  a  serious  effect  on  the  destinies  of  the  communist  party.
	    	A  majority  of  the  best-prepared  CCP  activists  most  dedicated  to  the  cause  of  social-
	    	ist  revolution,  among  them  Li  Dazhao,  Qu  Qiubo  and  Zhang  Tailei,  perished  as  a  resul~
	    	of  strikes  by  that  reaction.    	The  proletariat  suffered  heavy  losses,  especially  in
	    	the  two  largest  revolutionary  centers  of  China.  Guangzhou  and  Shanghai.    	The  commun-
	    	ist  party  shifted  its  activity  from  the  cities  to  remote  rural  regions  and  operated
	    	isolated  from  the  working  class  and  the  international  communist  and  workers'  movement
	    	over  the  next  two  decades.
	    	Under  these  complex  conditions,   	the  oroanizational,  political  and  ideological  miscal-
	    	culations  of  the  young  communist  party  were  manif~sted  with  particular  sharpness.
	    	from  the  raoment  of  its  formation,   	features  were  inherent  to  it  which,   	in  the  absence
	    	of  systematic  work  by  the  leadership  for  ideolo~ical  and  class  purity  in  its  ranks,
	     	threatened  to  grow  into  a  serious  danger  to  the  ideological-political  integrity  of
	     	the  party  and.be  transformed�into  a  factor  operating  along  the  line  of  converCing  the
	    	CCP  into  a  petty-bourgeois  party  defending  positions  having  nothing  in  common  with
	    	Marxism-Leninism.    	This  ~aas  stated,  in  particular,   	in  the  resolution  by  the  CCP  Cen-
	     	tral  Committee  Plenum  convened  in  November  1927:    	"Nearly  the  entire  leadershi~  of

	     	tatives  of  the  petty~bourgeois  intelligentsia."    	The  reasons,  as  was  pointed  out  in
	     	the  resolution,  were  that  the  "CCP  began  evolving  as  a  political  current  and  as  a
	     	party  back  when  the  Chinese  proletariat  was  not  yet  self-determining  as  a  class  and

	     	in  the  class  consciousness  and  class  atruggle  of  the  exploited  masses  in  China.    	In
	     	this  period,   	the  most  radical  elements  of  the  petty  bourgeois~ie  sought  to  ,~oin  the"
	     	ranks  of  our  party,   	occupying  the  left-most  wing  of  the  national-liberation  movement
	     	front.    	These  elements  also  comprised  the  initial  nucleus  of  the  Chinese  Communist
	     	Party.2
	     	The  plenum  resolution  directly  stated  the  dangerous  consequences  of  such  a  situation:

				inability  to  organize,  nonproletarian  customs  and  traditions,  pre~udices  and  illus-
				ions  of  which  only  a  pettq-bourgeois  revolutionarq  is  capable."1
				The  negative  phenomena  in  CCP  activity  indicated  in  the  resolution  were  not  overcome,
				and  intensified  even  more  in  sLbsequent  years.    	In  the  1930's  and  1940's,   	party  ranks
				were  reinforced  almost  exclusively  bq  people  leaving  rural  areas.    	CCP  Ieaders'   	re-
				~ection  of  Leninist  demands  in  question  of  partq  development,   	including  admissions  to
				the  party,  had  far-reaching  consequences.    	Campaigns  to  enlist  in  it  representatives
				of  the  most  diverse  social  strata,   	including  those  from  the  exploiter  classes,   	on  a
				broad  scale  were  widespread.    	In  rural  areas,  where  the  downtroddenness  and  backward-
  _		    	ness  of  the  peasants  represented  aerious  difficulties  in  broadening  the  mass  base  of
				the  party,   	admission  to  the  party  was  often  combined  with  the  distribution  of  land
				among  the  peasants.    	The  unprincipTed,   	forced  increase  in  CCP  membership  led  t~  a
				situation  in  which  it  increased  from  40,000  in  1931  to  800,000  in  1940.    	Up  to  90
				percent  of  the  party  members  were  naw  peasants,   	and  only  4-6  percent  were  workers,
				primarily  in  small  trade  or  handicraft  shopa.2    	In  the  cities,   	the  CCP  generally  ad-
				mitted  representatives  of  the  intelligentaia  and  petty-bourgeois  strata  during  that
  -		    	period.
				Thus,   	the  CCP  was  transf~rmed  into  a  peasant,  petty-bourgeois  party  in  terms  of  its
			 	social  composition.    	This  could  not  but  cause  the  spread  of  petty-bourgeois  ideology
			 	reflecting  the  interests  of  the  bu1.k  of  the  nonpreletarian  elements  comprising  the
				main  contingent  of  party  membez~s  within  its  ranks.
			 	The  activity  of  Mao    	Zedong  in  the  ranks  of  the  Chinese  Co~unist  Party  was  destruc-
			 	tive  to  its  cause.    	From  a  kulak  family  and,  'uy  his  own  admission,  without  any  sort
			 	of  int~grated  revolutionary  vision,  he  viewed  revalution,-~as  did  many  leaders  of
			 	peasant  movements  in  feudal  China,   	as  a  c~?ance  to  gain  the  highest  power  and  fully
  -		     	subordinated  his  activity  in  the  CCP  to  this  goal.    	Mao    	Zedong  revealed  himself  to
  -		     	be  a  very  experienced  politician  for  whom  an  irrepressible  thirst  for  power,   	inordi-
			 	nate  ambition,   	lack  of  principle  and  stubbornness  in  actualizing  his  schemes  were
			 	characteristic.    	In  the  1930's  and  1940's,  when  the  Chineae  Communist  Party  operated
			 	in  the  remote,  obscure  regions  of  the  country,  Mao   	Zedong  was  able,   	through  in.trigue
			 	and  unprincipled  inCraparty  maneuvering,  not  stopping  at  the  destruction  of  his  poli-
			 	~ical  enemies,   	to  grasp  a  leaderehip  poeition  in  the  CCP.
			 	The  CCP  social  composition  which  evulved  during  that  period  suited  Mao   	Z edong  fully,
			 	as  it  was  close  to  his  own  views  on  the  tasks  and  goals  of  the  Chinese  revolution.
			 	The  interests  and  g~ala  for  which  the  Chinese  working  class  was  fighting  were  for-
			 	eign  to  petty-bourgeois  revoZutionary  Mao    	Zedong.    	Hence  the  indifference  to  social
			 	criteria  for  admission  to  the  party.    	The  primary  th3ng  was  the  unquestioning  adher-
			 	ence  of  party  members  to  his  ins~ructions.    	Mao   	~Zedong  even  encouraged  strengthen-
			 	ing  the  CCP  by  adding  various  nonproletarian  elements.
  -		     	In  his  struggle  for  power,  Mao    	Zedong  viewed  Marxism-Leninism  from  the  very  start
			 	as  the  primary  obstacle  to  actualizing  his  own  plans.    	He  saw  binding  the  party  to

			theoretical  foundation  of  the  party  as  an  indispensable  condition  for  securing  hfs
			own  power  in  the  CCP.    	Mao    	Zedong's  views  were  reflected  in  the  New  Democratic  Re-
			volution  theory  he  advanced  in  1940,  which  was  presented  in  expanded  form  at  the  7th
			CCP  Congress.    	Mao    	Zedong  advanced  as  a  minimum  program  the  idea  that  it  was  neces-
			sary  to  have  an  "alliance  of  several  democratic  classes,"  the  development  of  a  pri-
			vate-capital  economy	 	"we  have  too  little  capitalism"	 	over  a  long  historical
			period,   	tt~us  granting  a  broad  field  of  activity  to  the  bourgeoisie.    	The  "new  demo-
			cratic  state"  concept   	essentially  denied  the  possibility  of  changing  over  to  build-
			ing  socialism  after  the  victory  of  a  popular  revolution.l
			In  1941-1945,  Mao    	Zedong  managed  to  or~anize  and  wage  a  campaign  for  "proper  style"
			("zhengfeng"),   	in  the  course  of  which  he  discredited  the  experience  of  building  so-
			cialism  in  the  USSR  and  the  activity  and  recommendations  of  the  Comintern  and  the
			All-Russian  Communist  Party   	(bol'shevik).    	At  the  same  time,  Maoists  defamed  and  re-
			pressed  internationalists.    	Mao    	Zedong's  assistants  destroyed  thousands  of  Chinese
			communists.    	As  a  result,  Mao    	Zedong  succeeded  in  breaking  the  resistance  of  the
			international  wing  of   	the  party  to  his  own  political  course,   	to  crush  other  party
			leaders  and  work  in  his  own  ideological-political  aims.
  ,
			To  his  own  ends,  Mao    	Zedong  inculcated  the  party  ranks  with  the  most  reactionary
			pre~udices,   	especially  those  characteristic  of  the  backward  cauutry  China  was.    	At
			one  time,  Lenin  warned  ttiat  "the  more  backward  a  country  is,   	the  stronger  small-
			scale  farming,   	patriarchy  and  provinciality  are  in  it,   	inevit~bly  leading  to  special
			strength  and  persistence  of  the  most  deep-seated  of  the  petty-bourgeois  ~re~udices,
			to  be  precise,   	those  of  national  egoism  and  national  narrow-mindedness."     	In  1944,
			in  a  conversation  with  Wang  Ming,  one  of  the  leaders  of  the  Chinese  Communist  Party
			during  those  years,  Mao   	Zedong  declared  directly  that  the  purpose  of  the  "proper
			style"  campaign  was  t~  make  it  possible  to  record  the  history  of  the  Chinese  Com-
			munist  Party  as  his  personal  history.3    	The  historical  facts  were  known  to  many,  how-
			ever,   	so  Mao    	Zedong  did  everything  he  could  to  propagate  his  own  interpretation  of
			the  history  af  the  Chinese  revolution.
			Thus,   	even  in  those  years,  Mao    	Zedong  was  working  actively  to  incite  anti-Sovietism
			in  party  ranks,   	to  divorce  and  isolate  the  CCP  from  the  international  communist  and
 -	    	workers'   	movement.    	In  so  doing,   	the  party  was  deprived  of  life-giving  sources  of  in-
  -	    	ternational  experience  and  assistance  on  the  part  of  the  fraternal  parties,  which  is
			so  necessary  for  its  correct  development.    	The  most  important  Leninist  principle,
			that  the  young  parties  of  the  East  must  maintain  the  very  closest  ties  with  the  world
			communist  and  ~aorkers'  movement,   	"merging  with  the  proletariats  of  other  countries  in
			common  struggle,i4  was  violated.    	The  7th  CCP  Congress  was  held  in  this  atmosphere  in
			April-June  1945.    	It   	summed  up  many  years  of  intraparty  struggle.    	Maoists  succeeded
  _	    	in  gaining  the  upper  hand  over  the  internationalist  wing  of  the  party  and  propagating

				assistance  in  building  the  new  society  ob~ectively  facilitated  growth  in  the  pres-
				tige  and  influence  of  Soviet  experience  in  party  and  economic  development  among  the
				broad  masses  in  the  party  and  PRC  cadre  workers.    	Concrete  experience  in  building
				socialism,  which  developed  in  China  in  spite  of  the  schemes  and  theoretical  con-
				structs  of  Mao    	Zedong  and  his  all~es,  naturally  led  Chinese  communists  to  an  under-
				standing  of  the  hostility  of  Maoist  concepts  on  developing  the  country  to  the  inter-
				ests  of  the  Chinese  people  and  the  cause  of  socialism.    	The  positions  of  interna-
				tionalists  in  the  CCP  began  to  be  strengtheued.
				On~  reflection  of  these  processes  wae  certainly  the  8th  CCP  Congress,  held  in  Sep-
				tember  1956.    	Several  negative  factors  of  intraparty  life  and  mietakes  permitted  in
  _		    	the  course  of  building  socialism  were  criticized  at  the  congress.    	However,   	thQ  new
				central  committee  included  practically  all  the  central  committee  members  elected  by
				the  7th  Party  Congress,  which  could  not but  have  an  effect  on  implementation  of  the
				resolutions  worked  out  at  the  8th  Congress.
				The  inconsistency  of  the  struggle  against  the  theory  and  practice  of  Maoism  is  tQ  be
				explained  in  consid~rable  measure  by  the  fact  that,  after  the  victory  of  the  revolu-
				tion,   	the  social  composition  of  the  CCP  facilitated  disse~ination  af  the  petty-
				bourgeois  concepts  of  Mao    	Zedong.    	In  spite  of  some  growth  in  the  worker  stratum
				of  the  party  (from  6.5  percent  i.n  May  1953  to  14  percent  by  1956),   	it  remained  es-
				sentially  peasant:    	by  1956,   	some  69  percent  of  its  members  were  peasants  and  12
				percent  were  of  the  intelligentsia.l
				'rhe  successes  in  building  socialism  in  China  in  the  early  1950's  generated  in  Mao
				Ze4ong    	and  his  allies  the  revolutionary  illusion  inherent  to  the  petty  bourgeois
				that  it  would  be  possible  to  accelerate  the  development  of  China  along  a  path  of
				transforming  it  into  a  powerful  state  with  a  modern  military-iudustrial  potential.
				Not  understanding  thp  pa~terns  af  economic  devalopment.under  socialism,  Mao    	Zedong
				completely  ignored  the  law  of  planned,  proportional  development.    	Due  to  the  ideolo-
				gical  and  political  immaturity  of  the  broad  party  masses,  Mao    	Zedong  succeeded  in

	     	dong's  ambitious  plans  to  make  China  one  of  the  stro~gest  worYd  powers  in  a  single

	     	Having  suffered  defeat  in  the  economic  sphere,  Mao    	Zedong  embarked  on  implementa-

	     	whole  globe"  was  how  Mao  foxmulated  the  goal  of  Maoists  tn  the  world  areria'at  a  meet-

	     	ist  strivings  to  be  a  manifestation  of  clasa  struggle  in  international  relations,
	     	they  counted  on  foisting  their  adventuristic  policy  on  the  world  communist  and  work-

	     	order  to  use  their  military  and  economic  potential.    	At  a  Conference  of  Representa-
	     	tives  of  Communist  and  Workers'  Parties  in  1957,  Mao    	Zedong  proposed:    	"Let's  first
	     	test  our  strength,   	and  then  return  to  building."2    	However,  the  attempt  to  subordi-
	     	nate  the  soeialist  countries  and  the  world  commu~ist  movement  to  the  aims  of  the  Mao-
	     	ists  was  not  successful.    	In  this  regard,  the  actions  of  the  Maoists  revealed  their
	     	theoretical  helplessness,   	reactionariness  aad  the  adventuristic  nature  of  the  PRC
	     	foreign  policy  cours~.    	Subsequentlq,  Maoist  policy  simed  at  splitting  the  interna-
	     	tiQnal  communist  and  workers'  movement  and  exteading  their  influence  to  the  national
	     	liberation  movement  unavoidably  led  them  to  international  isolation,  to  undermining

	     	peoples  desiring  peace  and  to  ensuring  conditions  for  cr.eative  labor.
			Intensified  anti-Sovietism  became  a  characteristic  feature  of  the  Maoist  foreign  po-
			licy  course  after  the  8th  CCP  Congresa.    	The  activizy  of  Mao    	Zedong  end  his  allies
  -	   	was  always  accompanied  by  attacks  on  Marxiem-Leninism  under  the  banner  of  its  sup-

			"Chinicized Marxism"  were  proposed  to  replace  them.    	Since  the  late  1950's,   	the  Soviet
			experience  in  building  socialism   	has   	been  subjected  to  increasingly  harsh  attacks.
			The  campaign  of  refuting  everything  Soviet  took  on  especially  broad  scope  during  the
			"Great  Leap"  period.    	Under  slogans  of  combatting  "dogmatism"  aad  "blind  worship  of
			authorities,"  "local,"  "Chinese"  methods  conflicting  with  the  objective  trends  of
			social  development  were  propagate3.    	Such  methods  could  be  used  only  under  condi-

			isolation  of  the  broad  masses  of  the  party  from  the  experience  of  party  and  state  de-
			velopment  in  the  USSR  and  other  sociali~st  cauntries.    	In  the  case  of  China,  continued

				The  defeats  in  PRC  domestic  and  foreign  policy  which  followed  after  Mao    	Zedong  had
				succeeded  in  fnisting  on  the  C~P  his  recipes  for  socioeconomic  development  of  the
				country  and  his  foreign-policy  aims  occurred  on  a  background  of  successful  develop-
				ment  of  the  world  socialist  system,   	foremost  in  the  Soviet  Union.    	This  turn  of
				events  posed  a mortaldanger  to  Maoism  as  an  ideological  current  and  cast  doubt  on.
				the  authority  of  Mao   	Zedong,   	leading  to  the  uaavoidable  losa  of  the  leading  posi-
				tions  at  his  disposal  in  the  partq  and  state.    	As  a  consequence,  Mao's  retention  and
				solidification  of  his  personal  power  and  implementation  of  the  goals  set  resulted  in
				his  irreconcilable  struggle.  against  the  primary  ally  of  healthy  forces  within  the
				CCP,   	the  CPSU  and  foreign  Marxist-Leniniat  parties  and  the  world  socialist  ~qstem,
				and  foremost  against  the  Soviet  Union.
				This  struggle  was  made  easier  for  Maoists  by  the  fact  that  for  many  years,  Chinese
				cornmunists  had  been  subjected  to  ideological  development  in  a  spirit  of  the  ideas
				of  Mao.    	The  cult  of  his  personality  fettered  creative  forces    	in  the  party  and
				braked  the  spread  of  Marxism-Leniniem  among  CCP  members.    	The  party  and  state  lea-
				dership  was  comprised  basically  of  people  put  forward  by  Mso  himself,  people  sharing
				his  views  or  subordinaCe  to  his  diktat.    	The  slandering,   	intimidation  and  inciting
				of  some  members  of  the  leadershi~:  againe*_  othera  was  widelq  practiced  by  Mao    	Zedong
				for  the  purpose  of  strengthening  his  poa*er  and  discrediting  political  opponents.    	Un-
				der  these  conditions,  Mao  succeeded  in  systematically  and  effectively  attacking  Marx-
				ist-Leninist  forces  in  the  party,   	in  eliminsting  the  most  prominent  CCP  activists
				and  consisten~   	internationalists,  blaming  them  .for  "anti-party"  activitq  and  pinning
				various  labels  on  them.    	Thus,  CCP  Central  Committee  Politburo  me.ffibers  Gao  Gang  and
				Pien  Diehuai  and  Politburo  candidate  nember  Zhang  Wentian  and  ^~the*_'e  were  removed
				from  the  CCP  leadership  and  repressed  in  the  195Q's.
  -		    	The  inability  of  Maoism  to  ensure  the  syetematic  development  of  Chinese  society,   	and
				especially  the  scandalous  economic  dafeats  when  the  party  followed  Mao   	Zedong's  re-
				commendations,   	the  dissatisfaction  of  the  broad  masses  of  people  with  the  deteriora-
				ti.on  in  their  material  situation  caused  an  exacerbation  of  the  CCP  intraparty
				struggle  in  the  late  1950's  and  early  1960's.    	Quite  a  broad,  but  diverse,  opposi-
				tion  developed  in  the  party,   	including  such  officials  as  PRC  Chairman  Liu  Shao~i  and
				others.    	The  oppositian  condemned  the  mo~t  adventuristic  actions  of  Ma~    	Zedong  and
				his  allies  within  the  country  and  abroad,   	in  fear  of  deadly  consequences  for  the
				Chinese  state.    	Neither  did  it  approve  the  complete  break  in  CPR  xelations  with  the
				socialist  countries.    	However,   	the  inability  of  the  opposition  ta  overcome  the  cult
				of  Mao  and  to  fully  reject  the  ideology  of  Maoism  hampered  the  unification  of  anti-
				Maoist  forces  and  did  not  per~it  an  open~  principled  struggle  to  eliminate  Mao  from
			 	the  political  scene.
				The  inconsistency  of  and  conflict  within  the  ogpoaition  enabled  Mao   	Zedong  and  his
				allies  to  prepare  to  shift  to  the  counterattack.    	During  the  ao-called  "cultural  re-
				volution"  d~veloped  by  Maoists  in  1966~1969,  which  relied  on  army  support  and  used
				as  a  strike  force  young  studenta  and  backward  strata  of  the  working  clasa,  Mao's
				group  broke  the  resistance  of  his  opponents  in  the  party  and  state  spparatus  and  ac-
				tually  accomplished  a  atate  revolution.    	Party  and  atate  organs  were  l~roken  up  and
				a  majority  of  the  cadre  workere  were  repressed.    	Zhou  Enlai  admitted  in  a  conversa-

	    	Maoists  now  had  an  opportunity  to  carry  out  their  own  domestic  and  foreign  policies
	    	by  creating  their  own  party.
	    	On  ttie  whole,  although  Maoists  did  succeed  in  eliminating  their  political  opponenta
	    	and  achieving  undivided  dominion   	in  China,   	the  "cultural  revolution"  demonstrated
	    	the  growing  conflict  between  the  objective  demands  of  developing  Chinese  society  and
	    	Maoist  domestic  and  foreign  policy.    	The  conflict  essentially  between  the  antisocial-
	    	ist  superstructure  and  the  socialist  base  of  Chinesa  society  resulted  in  political
 _	  	instability  in  the  country,   	instability  of  the  Maoiat  regime,  and  predetermined  the
	    	rise  of  new  crisis  situations  in  the  economy  and  in  the  social  and  political  life  of
	    	China.    	After  the  9th  CCP  Congress  held  in  April  1969,  Maoists  attempted  by  socio-
	    	political  maneuvering  to  neutralize  the  moat  negative  consequences  of  implementing
	    	Mao    	Zedong's  ideae  within  the  country  and  abroad.    	However,  palliative  resolutions
	    	could  not  soften  in  any  substantial  way  the  development  of  crisis  trends  in  Chinese
	    	society.    	The  inability  of  Maoists  to  propose  to  their  people  a  constructive  program
	    	for  transforming  the�country  resulted  from  their  lack  of  a  political  platform  on
	    	which  to  base  the  unification  of   	Chinese  society.
	    	This  situation  led  to  the  riae  within  the  Maoist  bloc  of  groupings  reflecting  vari-
	    	ous  trends  in  the  sociopolitical   	development  of  China  within  the  framework  of  an
  _	  	eclectic,   	internally  contradictory  Maoist  teaching.    	By  supporting  particular  group-
	    	ings,  Mao    	Zedong  availed  himself  of  a  definite  opportunity  to  direct  the  policies
	    	of  the  country.
	    	The  strongest  grouping  was  that   	of  PRC  Minister  of  Defense  Lin  Biao,  which  is  to  be
	    	explained  by  the  role  the  army  had  acquired  as  a  result  of  the  "cultural  revolution."
	    	At  the  9th  CCP  Congress,  Lin  Biao  became  the  sole  Deputy  Chairman  of  the  CCP  and
	    	Mao's  off icial  successor.    	The  vezy  existence  of  ruch  a  grouping  represented  a
	    	threat  to  Mao    	Zedong.    	In  this  regard,  by  expressing  the  specific  interests  of
 -	  	his  own  grouping,  Lin  Biao  was  ne.gatively  incliaed  towards  normalizing  relations
	    	with  the  USA  and  continued  to  ins isC  on  a  policy  of  "equal-standing"  relative  to
	    	the  USSR  and  USA.    	While  a  dangerous  contestant  for  other  pretenders  to  the  highest
	    	power  in  Beijing,  Lin  Biao  was  at   	the  same  time  an  obstacle  to  reorienting  the  PRC
	    	towards  cooperation  with  Western  countries,  and  foremost  tke  United  States.
	    	Another  influential  grouping  which  evolved  dur.ing  the  "cultural  revolufion"  period
	    	were  the  leaders  of  the  hongweib in  and  zaofang,   	the  so-called  leftista,  who  carried
	    	out  Mao's  policies  and  who  were  his  most  conaistent  allies.    	They  gained  especially
	    	solid  positions  in  the  CCP  propaganda  apparatus  and  the  mass  media.    	Howeaver,   	the
	    	primary  advantage  of  this  grouping  was  that  it  was  under  Che  patronage  of  Mao  him-
	    	self,   	that  in  time~  it  would  come   	to  replace..him.    	This  grouping,  whose  most  promi-
	    	nent  representatives  were  Jian  Q ing,  Kang  Sheng,   	Zhang  Zhongqiao,  Yao  Wenyuan  and
	    	Wang  Hongwen,  was  especially  susp icioua  of  the  military,  viewing  it  as  ite  main
	    	competitors  in  Che  struggle  for  power.
	    	The  complete  failure  of  Maoist  aims  to  conform  to  the  needs  of  China's  socioeconomic
	    	development,  by  generating  a  permanent  criais  situation  in  the  economy  and  in  soci-

		     	monistic  policy  established  in  PRC  foreign  policy.
 ~		    	Recognizing  the  impossibility  of  the  ieolated  development  of  the  Chinese  economy,
		     	the  "pragmatists"  attempted  to  e~tablish  broad  trade  and  economic  ties  with  the  ca-

				to  a  certain  extent  the  economic  basis  of  and  change  in  the  foreign  policy  course
				of  the  PRC.    	The  right-opportunistic,  petty-bourgeois  tendencies  which  had  always

				1955.    	Rapprochement  with  the  USA  signified  essentially  a  re~ection  of  one  of  the
				basic  Maoist  doctrines,   	that  of  struggle  "against  American  imperialism  and  Soviet
				revisionism."    	Lin  Biao's  speeches  before  and  after  the  2nd  Plenum  testified  to  the
				fact  that  he  insisted  on  the  necesaity  of  waging  the  struggle  on  two  fronts,   	consi-
				dering  the  struggle  against  American  imperialiam  to  have  priority.    	This  position
				put  Lin  Biao's  grouping  in  conflict  with  all  the  main  factions  in  the  Bei~ing  lea-
				dership  and  predestined  its  fa~l.    	The  elimination  of  Lin  Biao  as  a  result   	of   	the
				1971  "September  events"  did  much  to  open  up  the  way  �or  rapprochement  between  the
				PRC  and  USA,  which  ob~ectively  facilitated  an  intenaification  of  anti-Sovietism  in
				China's  policies.
				As  a  result  of  the  elimination  of  Lian  [aic]  Bit~p's  grouping  in  the  CCP,  the  posi-
				tions  of  the  "pragynatists"  were  strengthened,  ha~ving  graduallq  established  their
				views  on  solutions  of  the  economic  and  foreign-policy  problems  of  the  Chinese  state.
			 	In  the  subsequent  period,  the  struggle  far  power  developed  betweea  this  grouping  and

			 	in  the  party  and  state  cadre  apparatus,   	the  calamities  which  befell  China  as  a  re-
			 	sult  of  the  "cultural  revolution"  were  directly  associated  in  the  public  conscious-
			 	ness  with  the  activity  of  the  "left-Maoist"  grouping.    	The  death  of  Ma.o  in  Septem-
 -		     	ber  1976  led  to  the  rapid  fall  of  the  "Gang  of  Four"   	(Jiang  Qing,  Wang  Hnngwen,

	     	very  important  types  of  output	 	coal.   	steel,  petroleum,  txactors,  automobiles
	     	are  to  be  reduced  or  frozen.    	Under  these  conditiona,  China's  ieaders  are  aktempting
	     	to  strengthen  the  economy  by  attracting  foreign  capital  and  stimulating  private-
	     	entrepreneurial  activity.    	A  favorable  investment  climate  is  being  created  to  do

	     	Preferential  terms  have  been  granted  for  foreign  capital  investment.    	The  3rd  VSNP
	     	Session  adopted  a  law  that  taxes  on  mixed  enterprises  (in  which  both  Chinese  and
	     	foreign  capital  participate)  will  be  20  percent  less  than  in  capitalist  countries.
	     	The  bourgeoisie  has  been  permitted  political  activity,   	all  manner  of  "meetings"  and

				rapprochement  with  capitalist  countries,  foremost  the  USA,  and  developing  relations
				with  various  reactionary  regimes  also  serves  the  foreign  policy  goals  of  Chinese

				Chinese  leaders  are  attempting  to  substantiate  their  forming  a  bloc  wiCh  the  capi-
				talist  countries,  and  foremost  the  USA,  by  relying  on  the  myth  of  a"Soviet  threat."
				The  documents  of  the  9th   	(April  1969),   	lOth  (August  1973)  and  llth   	(August  1977)  CCP
				Congresses  evidence  a  clear  trend  towards  shifting  the  direction  of  the  main  strike
			 	from  the  United  States  to  the  Soviet  Union.    	The  USSR  is  depicted  as  the  more  dan-
				gerous  enemy,  and  the  USA  is  made  out  to  be  more  on  the  defensive.    	Chinese  leaders
				attempt  by  this  thesis  to  justify  their  own  struggle,  together  with  the  imperialist
			 	countries,  against  the  Soviet  Union  and  their  own  policy  of  increasing  their  mili-
			 	tary  might.
				The  26th  CPSU  Congress  confirmed  the  principles  by  which  the  CPSU  and  Soviet  state
			 	are  governed  in  relations  with  China  in  the  current  five-year  period.    	As  concerns
  _		     	the  status  and  prospects  of  Soviet-Chinese  relations,  the  Congress  expressed  a  readi-
				ness  to  improve  them  on  a  base  of  proposals  made  previously.    	"If  Soviet-Chinese  re-
			 	latin:~s  remain  frozen,   	the  reason  will  not  lie  with  us,"  declared  L.  I.  Brezhnev  at
			 	the  congress.    	"The  Soviet  Union  has  not  sought  and  is  not  seeking  a  confrontation
				with  the  People's  Republic  of  China.    	We  are  following  the  course  determined  by  the
			 	24th  and  25~h  CPSU  Congresses  and  would  like  to  build  ties  with  it  on  a  good-neighbor
				basis.    	Our  prdposals  ained  at  normalizing  relations  with  China  remain,  as  do  our
 =		     	feelings  of  respect  and  friendship  for  ~he  Chinese  people.t1						 	~
			 	The  main  obstacle  on  the  path  of  Chinese  development  remains  Maoism.    	In  spite  of
  -		     	ad~ustments  in  individual  postulates  of  it  a�n~  criticism  of  certain  "mistakes"  per-
				mitted  in  actualizing  the  "thoughts  of  Mao    	Zedong,"  especially  during  the  "cultural
			 	revolution,"  Maoism  remains  today  the  ideological-theoretical  platfo~.rm  of  the  CCP.
			 	This  situation  is  natural.    	For  decades,  Maoists  wag~d  a  bitter  stru~gle  with  Marx-
			 	ist-Leninist  teaching    	and  distorted  it  by  limiting  its  spread  among  CCP  members  by
			 	every  means  available  to  them.    	For  the  bulk  of  its  history,  the  CCP  selected  its
			 	members  on  the  principle  of  their  personal  devotion  to  Mao    	Zedong  and  his  ideas.
  -		     	As  a  result,   	the  Maoists  succeeded,  by  devastating  the  CCP  during  the  "cultural  rs-
			 	volution,"  in  creating  under  that  pretext  their  own  party,  which  had  nothing  what-
			 	ever  in  common  with  the  ideals  of  communism.    	The  existence  of  that  party,  uniting
			 	millions  of  people  reared  in  a  spirit  of  Maoist  ideology,  certainly  ensured  the  ma-
			 	terialization  of  the  "thought    	of  Mao    	Zedong"  and  their  contemporarq  modifications
			 	in  practical  politics.
			 	There  exists  a  danger  that  the  many  yeare  of  Maoist  speculation  about  Marxist-
			 	Leninist  teachings  and  exploitation  of  the  revolutionary  enthusiasm  of  the  Chinese
			 	people  has  undermined  the  fa~th  of  working  people  in  the  fdeas  of  socialism.    	The

			  	[Article  by  Elsa  Grechkina:    	"Problems  of  Ideological-Moral  Education  in  Light  of
			 	Directives  of   	the  26th  Congress  of  the  CPSU"]
			  	[Text]    	As  late  as  the  1950s  the  Soviet  comprehensive  educational  school  was  pri-
			 	marily  deaigned  to  prepare.students  for  entry  into  higher  and  specialized  mid-level
			 	schools.    	With  this  in  mind~the  curricula  had  been  composed,  as  had  the  number  of
			 	hours  for  instruction  of  this  or  that  sub~ect,   	this  characterized  the  content  and
			 	character  of  work  inside  the  school  and  outside  it.    	In  recent  years,   	in  connection
			 	with  a  change  to  mandatory  mid-level  education,   	the  function  of  the  school  has
  _		     	changed  considerably.    	The  ma~ority  of  graduates  of  the  general  school   	(consider-
			 	ably  more  than  half  in  our  republic)  goes  to  work  in  the  national  economy--in
			 	industry,   	agriculture,   	services.    	For  this  reason  it  is  necessary  to  improve  even
			 	more  the  preparation  of  the  youth  for  life  and  work  in  the  interest  of  educating  a
			 	comprehensively  developed  builder  of  communism,   	and  to  assure  that  all  students
			 	acquire  basic  specialized  skills  and  moral  convictions.    	According  to  the  new  re-
			 	quireme~ts  the  educating  and  training  function  of  the  schools  will  expand,  as  will
			 	the  ideological  function.
			 	For  the  educators  of  the  Estonian  SSR  and  our  entire  country  the  last  five-year
			 	plan  period  was  a  period  of   	intensive  work  in  fulfilling  the  requirements  of  the
			 	school-related  documents  of   	the  25th  Contress  of  the  CPSU  as  well  as  subsequent
			 	decisions  of  Farty  and  government.    	The  most  important  of  these  consisted  in
			 	establishing  universal  mandatory  mid-level  education,   	preparing  students  for  real
			 	life,   	for  work,  and  shaping.a  morally  active  attitude  in  each  of  them.    	From  these
			 	perspectives  we  have  to  evaluate  the  results  of  our  work.
			 	As  L.   	I.   	Brezhnev  pointed  out  at  the  26th  Congress  of  the  CPSU,   	the  transfer  to  a
			 	universal  mandatory  mid-level  education  has  been  accomplished  throughout  the  USSR.
			 	This  important  milepost  has  been  passed  in  our  republic  as  well.    	At  the  end  of  the
			 	last  school  year  97.6  percent  of  the  graduatea  of  the  8th  grade  entered  secondary
			 	schools.    	The  acquisition  of  secondary  education  in  the  proper  time  frame  increased
			 	(currently  99.1  percent  as  compared  to  9I.2  percent  in  1976).    	The  number  of  general
			 	education  day  school  students  increased  by  7500  during  the  five-year  period.    	More
			 	than  ~0,000  new  student  spaces  were  acquired.    	The  schools  implemented  completely
			 	the  departmental  system,   	another  2000  ittstructional  departments  were  established
			 	during  the  five-year  period,   	the  funds  devoted  to  education  increased  compared  to
			 	those  of  the  Ninth  Five-Year  period.    	A  large  part  of  the  funds  came  from  sponsoring

		 	In  the  Estonian  SSR  great  attention  is  paid  to  a  further  democratization  and  himman-
		 	ization  of  the  contents  of  education.    	This  is  exemplified  by  the  establishment  of
		 	favorable  conditions  for  children  with  mental  and  physical  deficiencies.    	The
		 	number  of  schools  for  the  handicapped  is  46,   	sufficient  for  the  needs.

  =	     	students,   	reaching  a  total  of  40,000.    	This  is  a  contribution  of  the  Soviet  state
		 	toward  the  social  education  of  the  children.    	Great  attention  was  paid  to  the  need
		 	to  completely  adapt  the  new  contents  of  education  to  the  forms,  means  and  methods
		 	of  schoolwork,   	i.e.   	to  buttress  the  pedagogical  pr,ocess  scientifically-methodogically
  -	     	and  ideologically.    	The  first  summaries  of  the  current  school  year,   	the  results  of

		 	educated,  morally  active  youths.    	We  must  appreciate  t~,at  the  most  immediate  aid  to
		 	the  schools  in  their  task  of  preparing  the  rising  generation  for  life  comes  from
		 	the  Central  Committee  of  the  Estonian  CP,   	and  the  party's  town  and  rayon  committees.
  _	     	At  practically  every  rneeting  of~the  Central  Committee  of  the  Estonian  CP,   	regardless
		 	of  the  problems  under  discussion,   	great  attention  is  paid  to  the  various  activities
		 	of  the  schools,   	to  their  ties  with  life,   	to  the  concrete  socio-economic  and
		 	ideological-educational  training.    	A  persuasive  example  is  the  recent  2d  Plenary
		 	Meeting  of  the  CPEs  Central  Committee,  where  personnel  questions  were  discussed.
		 	The  First  Secretary  of  the  CPEs,  K.  Vayno,   	devoted  great  attention  to  school  pro-
  -	     	blems,   	the  realistic  possibilities  of  social  practice,  and  outl3ned  the  tasks  of
		 	party  committees  and  educational  institutions  in  light  of  the  decisions  of  the  26th
		 	CPSU  Congress.    	Similarly,   	the  party's  town  and  rayon  committees,   	taking  into  account
		  	the  serious  attention  of  the  CPEs  Central  Committee	 	to  school  problems,  have
		  	focused  their  attention  on  educational  problems.    	During  the  last  3-4  years  many
		 	party  committees  at  their  plenary  meetings  and  in  their  bureaus  have  taken  a  look
		 	at  the  substantive  problems  of  schoolwork,   	the  complex  and  promising  plans  for
		  	educational  development  proven  in  our  practice  as  well  as  the  caurse  of  fulfilling
		  	these  plans.    	The  party  and  soviet  organs  concentrate  on  sponsorship  agreements
		  	between  schools  and  enterprises.    	The  structure  and  contents  of  the  agreements
		  	were  compiled  by  the  Ministry  of  Education  of  the  Estonian  SSR.    	They  were  based
		  	on  a  comprehensive  approach  to  education   	(a  common  front  of  school,  home,  work  col-
		  	lective  and  the  general  public  to  organize  a  common  unified  pedagogical  process  to
		  	prepare  children  for  life).				,
		  	During  the  last  school  year  the  Estoniari  SSR's  Ministry  of  Education  made  compre-
		  	nensive  observations  about  the  educational  work  of  each  rayon  and  town  during  the
		  	lOth  Five-Year  Plan.    	Party  co~nittee  secretaries  and  deputy  chairmen  of  the
		  	executive  committees  concerned  with  educational  questions  participated  in  the  dis-
		  	cussions.    	The  main  aim  of  this  task  was  to  specify  the  3oint  distribution  of  plans
		  	according  to  governmental  tasks,   	taking  into  account  the  conerete  tasks  of  the  town
		  	or  rayon  in  directing  graduates  of  the  Sth  grade  to  further  training  and  for  estab-
		  	lishing  a  network  of  secondary  schools,   	for  expanding  the  network  of  schools  and
		  	preschool  institutions;   	to  identify  problems~regarding  a  better  utilization  of
		  	educational  personnel  and  for  their  comprehensive  training;   	to  discuss  problems  of
		  	school  and  extra-school  activity,   	to  identify  precisely  common  educational  require-
		  	ments  in  each  sector  of  work;   	to  identify  precisely  concrete  facts  that  prevent
		  	the  successful  fulfillment  of  teaching  tasks.

			 	After  such  a  common  analysis  there  was   	(and  in  places  still  is)  a  similar  inspection
			 	of  each  school  and  sponsoring  enterprise.    	Such  work  permits  raising  the  standard  of

			 	approach  for  solving  concrete  tasks,  and  formulating  the  party  and  state  directions

			  	and  rayon  was  inspected  with  attention  paid  to  the  establishment  of  universal
			  	secondary  education,   	establishment  of  a  school  network,  and  raising  the  qualifi-
			  	cations  of  the  professional  personnel.    	The  results  were  compiled  at  the  ministerial
			 	meeting  and  they  will  be  published  in  pamphlet  form,   	t4  enable  the  educational
 -				departments  and  schools   	to  take  necessary  directive  steps  at  the  August  meetings
			  	for  a  decisive  and  more  positive  direction  of  work.
			  	We  are  convinced  that  during  the  llth  Five-Year  Plan  our  republic,  ~ust  as  the
			  	entire  USSR,  has  taken  steps  to  assure  a  marked  improvement  in  the  level  of  educa-
			  	tional  work.    	The  tasks   	facing  the  schools  are  not  simple  ones.    	Let  us  quote  L.   	I.
			  	Brezhnev's  repart:    	"The  main  task  is  now  to  raise  the  quality  of  teaching  and  pro-
			  	fessional  and  moral  education  in  th~  school,   	to  eradicate  formalism  in  evaluating
			  	the  results  of  the  work  of  teachers  and  students,   	to  strengthen  in  fact  the  Cies
			  	between  teaching  and  life,   	and  to  improve  the  student's  preparation  for  socially
			  	useful  work.    	The  teacher,   	of  course,   	plays  a  decisive  part  in  this.    	We  must  not
			  	be  stingy  with  attention  to  his  work,   	living  conditions  and  raising  his  qualifica-
			  	tions.    	But  at  the  same  time  requirements  for  his  work  increase.    	The  quality  of
			  	curricula  and  texts  also  must  be  improved.    	It  is  sta*ed  correctly  that  they  are
			  	too  complicated.    	This  makes  teaching  more  difficult  and  leads  to  an  unjustified
			  	overburdening  ~f  the  children.    	The  Ministry  of  Education  and  the  Academy  of
			  	Pedagogics  must  immediately  improve  the  situation.
			  	The  materials  of   	the  26th  Congress  of  the  CPSU  stress  that  education  mirrors  the
			  	comprehensive  development  of  a  society  and  develops  itself  intensively  as  part  of
			  	a  common  process,   	of  a  unified  social  organism.    	From  here,  as  with  all  other  ex-
  -				pressions  of  life,   	/in  boldface/  emanate  the  socially  c6ordinated  requirements
			  	levied  on  educational  organs.  pedsgogical  collectives,   	every  teacher,   	every  school,
			  	every  social  institution  thuc  in  some  way  deals  with  the  training  of  the  you�g
			  	generation.~~   	/end  boldfacei
			  	Let  us  outline  some  problems  that  arise  from  this  thesis.
			  	First.    	Let  the  discussion  of  the  first  cycle  of  the  problem  be  based  on  the  method~-
			   	~logical  approach  of   	the  26th  Congress-formalism  must  be  decisively  eradicated  in
			  	evaluating  the  results  of  the  work  of   	the  teacher,   	student,  and  school.    	An  entire
			  	complex  of  quantitative   	(statistical)   	indicators  has  been  compiled  for  evaluating
			  	the  work  of  school  and  teacher,  and  we  must  continue  to  rely  on  it.    	The  inclusion
			  	of  the  student  body,   	the  number  of  students  graduating  at  the  proper  time  from  the
			  	8th  grade  and  the  secondary  school,  even  the  qualitative  indicators  of  success  in
			  	studies  mirror  the  work  of   	the  school,   	teacher,   	and  student.    	Our  task  is  to  find
			  	organic  ties  between  quantitative  and  qualitative  aspects.    	nbviously,   	the  key  to
			   	the  secret  of   	this  machinery  is  the  concrete  analysis  of  the  practice,   	each  numer-
			   	ical  indicator  has  to  express  an  emotional,   	social  indicator.    	For  example,   	in  spite

			of  many  achievements  the  general  educational  achool  still  does  not  teach  each  of
			its  students  well.    	This  fact  in  turn  resulta  in  an  inadequate  quality  of  the
			student's  achievement,  which  in  turn  is  an  important  reason  for  dropping  out.    	Each
	     	~e~Y  1.4  percent  of  the  students  in  grades  1-11,   	some  2500  total,  drop  out.
 _	    	An  evaluation  of  the  results  of  an  activity  is  always  connected  with  the  moral  and
			emotional  experiences  of  the  evaluated.    	Many  have  tried  their  luck  in  evaluating
			the  activity  of  schools  and  teachers.    	Iiere  we  experience  concretely  that  the  spec-
			trum  of  the  social  expression  of  schools  and  education  is  exceptionally  broad.    	We
			still  cannot  imagine  it  a11--education  as  a  factor  of  socio-economic  progress,
			education  as  a  factor  in  progressive  personnel  policy,  etc,   	etc.    	As  a  result  of
			this  spectrum  there  is  a  natural  interest  in  education  and  schools,   	there  is  a  wish
  -	    	to  evaluate  their  activity.    	That  is  good.    	But  we  cannot  remain  deaf  to  the  ever-
			increasing  negativism  in  these  evaluations  that  influence  the  shaping  of  concepts
			of  schools,   	teachers,   	and  students.    	Here,  we  hold,  we  must  eliminate  the  once-
			forged  stereotypical  concepts  of  education  that  have  developed  into  a  linear  con-
			nection--a  student`s  shortcomings  are  the  fault  of  the  teacher  of  the  school.    	This
			is  stated  without  a  deeper  analysis  of  the  causes  of  the  shortcomings,  without
			taking  into  account  the  f inal  tasks  of  the  training  and  educational  process  as  well
			as  the  factors  and  means  of  the  entire  educational  comples--family,  work  collective,
			micro-environment.    	In  other  words,   	the  decisions  of  the  26th  congress  require
			cor.rections   	to  be  made  according  to  the  social  functions  of  the  schools,   	taking
			intn  account  the  real  contribution  of  the  schools  to  the  society,   	and  offering
			effective  aid  to  this  contribution.    	Let  us  once  again  quote  from  the  report  of
			L.   	I.   	Brezhnev:    	"We  must  not  be  stingy  with  attention  to  his  work,   	living  conditions,
			and  raising  his   	(the  teacher's.Ed.)   	qualifications.    	But  at  the  same  time  require-
			ments  of  his  work  increase."    	The  above  shows  that  the  preparation  of  the  young
			generation  for  work  is  the  business  of  the  school  as  well  as  the  society  as  a  whole.
			Perhaps  one  shouldn`t  talk  of  this  in  such  a  great  detail,  but  facts  indicate  other-
			wise.
			Our  republic  lags  considerably  behind  the  planned  tasks  and  the  level  of  the  USSR
 -	    	even  in  the  proper  dissemination  of  8-grade  education.    	That  figure  was  95.2  percent
			of  the  Estonian  SSR  at  the  end  of  the  Five  Year  Plan,  being  at  the  same  time  more     	~
			than  97  percent  in  the  USSR.    	Each  percentage  means  the  fate  of  hundreds  and  hundreds
			of  students.    	This  fa~t  considerably  impedes  the  integration  of  youths  into  this  or
			that  segment  of  the  educational  system,   	causes  comp~etition  among  them,  makes  the
			rejuvenation  of  the  society's  social  structure  more  difficult._.  A.nother  fact
			connected  with  this  problem--in  spite  of  improvement  in  training  students  for  pro-
			fessions  or  vocations   	the  number  of  graduates  commencing  work  in  fields  they  were
 -	     	trained  for  in  school  is  12-16  percent  in  our  republic.
			Thus   	the  deficiencies  in  cooperation  between  schools  and  enterpri.ses  is  beginning
 -	     	to  exert  a  negative  effect  on  the  socio-professional  self-determination  of  the
			young,   	on  their  preparation  in  finding  their  place  in  life.    	This  problem  is
			especially  acute  with  rural  8-grade  schools.    	There  is  an  intensive  urbanization
			of  8th  grade  graduates,   	in  spite  of  incentives  offered  in  the  country.    	The  econo-
 -	    	mists  and  sociologists  of  our  republic  are  currently  busy  investigating  the  compli-
			cated  streams  of  migration  inside  and  outside  the  republics.    	Directing  migration
			according  to  the  planned  shifts   	in  the  national  e~onomy  is  largely  dependent  on  the
			socio-professional  attitude  of   	the  young,   	on  their  training  for  life.    	We,   	the
			educational  personnel,  are  fully  aware  that  the  requirement  of  the  26th  Congress  of

			  	the  CYSU  regarding  the  development  of  the  proEeasional  training  and  career  manage-
			  	ment  of  the  student  body  requires   	that  we,  together  with  work  collectives  arrange
			  	for  a  more  skilled  and  better  transition  of  youths  into  the  national  economy,   	paying
			  	p~rticular  attention  to  the  need  of  the  young  to  have  the  correct  professional  and
			  	ideological-moral  sense  of  value  and  orientation.
			  	Of  course,   	an  important  and  decisive  part  in  this  task  is  played  by  the  school,   	the
			  	teacher.    	The  republic's  Interdepartmental  Council  on  Vo~ational  Selection  of  the
			  	Youth,   	approved  by  the  Central  Committee  of  the  ECP,   	the  Council  of  Ministers  of
			  	the  Estonian  SSR,   	and  the  Council  of  Labor  Unions  has  been  attached  to  the  Ministry
			  	of  Education  for  the  actual  work.    	The  ministry  has  developed  many  measure~  to  enable
  -				the  educational  organs  and  the  schools  to  successfully  implement  the  governmental
			  	educational  policy.    	The  observation  of  the  co~on  efforts  of  the  school,  home,
  _		     	public,   	and  enterprises  to  assure  a  sympathetic  attitude,  a  correct  party-line
			  	activity  ~n  the  professional  training  and  ideological-moral  education  of  the  youths
			  	is  of  particular  importance.
			  	We  must  come  to  the  point  that  all  interested  systems  abandon  a  consutnerist  attitude
			  	in  the  preparation  of  the  youths   	for  a  socio-moral  task  and  life.    	Unfortunately,
			  	there  are  still  a  few  chiefs  of  production  who  express  their  attitude  toward  the
  -				schools  literally  in  these  terms:    	"We  have  free  education,   	the  state  provides  the
  -				necessary  resa.~rces  and  workers,   	why  am  I  needed?"    	But  you  are  needed  for  the  reason
			  	that  the  concent~~*ed  influence  of  all  systems  is  needed  in  the  harmonious  develop-
  -		     	ment  of  a  young  person.
			  	It  is  apparently  a  mistake  to  imagine  that  a  young  person  could  obtain  everything
			  	that  there  is  to  know  in  a  classroom.    	For  his  development  he  needs  the  rich
			  	spectrum  of  relationships  of  the  entire  society,  where  each  system  connected  with
			  	the  school  has  a  specific  function  that  must  be  realized  by  a  direct  relationship
			  	and  contact  with  the  young.    	We  have  some  good  experiences  in  this.
			  	The  task  of  further  improving  the  ideological-moral  training  of  the  student  body  was
			  	served  at  a  discussion  of  the  school  libraries  and  school  museums  held  jointly  with
  -				the  Ministry  of  Culture  of  the  Estonian  SSR.    	There  is  re~son  to  expect  that  as  a
			  	result  of  such  com*.non  efforts  the  respective  work  in  all  of  o~xr  g~neral  educational
			  	schools  will  improve.    	We  have  traditional,  good  and  meaningful  contacts  with  the
			 	Minister  of  Culture,   	the  cultural  personnel  of  the  republic,   	as  well  as  with  the
			  	creative  leagues  and  their  representatives.    	Within  the  framework  of  the  theatre
			 	month,   	the  children's  music  week,   	at  the  art  weelc  staged  in  many  towns  and  rayons
			  	of  the  republic  there  have  always  been  warm  and  useful  meeting~  of  the  school
			  	students  and  the  representatives  of  the  arts  and  culture.    	Of  course,  all  opportun-
			  	ities  have  not  been  realized  wi th   	the  optimal  success  and  extent.    	Our  joint  efforts
			 	must  be  increased  in  the  future,   	their  extent  must  be  expanded,   	so  that  a  larger
			 	number  of  students  would  find  their  way  to  art,  would  appreciate  the  importance  of
			  	the  arts  in  filling  leisure  time  and  in  shaping  the  personality.
			 	Last  November  the  Students'   	S~ientific  Society  was  founded.    	The  institutes  of  the

			early  development  of  scientific  prerequisites  in  the  young.    	A  considerable  and
			meaningful  assistance  to  the  schools  is  rendered  by  the  children's  programs  of
			Estonian  radio  and  television,  as  well  as  by  its  programs  dealing  with  many  other
			aspects  of  educational  work.    	The  newspapers  of  our  republic  have  increased  their
			attention  to  the  problems  of  teaching  the  students  communistically.    	It  must  be
			stated  in  appreciation  that  these  articles  are  competent,   	they  do  not  smooth  over
		 	school  problems;   	to  the  contrary,  many  of  them  raise  very  serious,   	still  unresolved
			problems,  drawing  the  attention  of  the  concerned  collectives,   	including  the  schools,
		 	to  the  solution  of   	these  problems.    	These  materials  clearly  echo  an  attempt  to  for-
			mulate  an  objective  and  positive  attitude  in  the  evaluation  of  the  schools'   	activ-
		 	ities.
		 	The  management  of  the  students'   	free  time  through  the  activity  of  the  Young  Pioneers
		 	and  the  Komsomol,   	the  education  of  youth  in  the  spirit  of  citizenship,   	international
		 	friendship  and  patriotism  has  always  been  the  basis  for  cooperation  between  our  min-
		 	istry  and  the  Central  Committee  of  the  Estonian  Young  Communist  League.
		 	The  above  has  not  been  said  to  make  our  work  easier.    	Our  youth  must  experience  the
		 	richness  of  cultural  life  and  the  experiences  of  the.productive  and  social  life  of
		 	the  older  generation.    	In  other,  words,   	it  grows  to  social  maturity  in  direct  contacts
		 	with  real  l.ife.    	Attempts   	to  bring  everything  within  school  walls  show  a  simplified
		 	picture  of  the  school.    	In  the  conditions  at  hand  schools  together  with  other
  -	    	agencies  must  also  be  more  skilled  and  imaginative  in  forming  in  the  students  social
		 	maturity.
		 	The  second  complex  of  problems  is  directly  concerned  with  the  school  itself,  with
		 	its  ideological-moral  activity.
		 	The  ministry,   	together  with  the  educational  organs  and  the  teaching  staffs  of  the
		 	schools  considers  its  moral  obligation  to  be  the  shaping  of  a  comprehensively
		 	developed  personality  in  harmony  with  the  requirements  of  the  society  by  its  train-
		 	ing  and  educational  work.    	Today,   	in  the  condition  of  developed  socialism,   	the  pre-

		 	expenditures  by  society.    	For  example,  almQSt  400.vocations  in  our  country  already
		 	call  for  secondary  education  or  special~zed  vocational  schooling.    	Consequently  the
		 	schools,   	taking  into  account  the  expenses  incurred  by  society,  have  to  understand
		  	that  in  the  preparation  of  a  young  person  fc~r~life  and  work  the  idea  expressed  at
		  	the  26th  Congress  of  the  CPSU  stating  that:.'~management  must  be  economical"  is  very
		 	expressive  and  clear,  being  expressed  here  especially  in  a  moral  sense.
		 	The  above  is  closely  connected  with  the  content  and  extent  of  the  general  secondary
		  	educational  program.    	These  ideas  reecho  in  the  complex  plans  of  our  educational
		 	development  and  in  the  sponsorship  agreements  between  schools,   	collectives  and
		  	enterprises.    	It  is  appropriate  for  us  to  stress  here  that  the  understanding  of  a
		  	preparation  for  work  and  life  must  in  turn  derive  from  an  approach  free  of  formal-
		  	ism.    	In  places  one  can  detect  a  simplified  approach,   	in  that  the  students  are
		  	given  more  and  more  concrete  study  and  work  assignments,  without  their  mental  and
  -	     	moral  characteristics  or  emotions  being  developed  to  a  higher  level.
		  	The  requirement  to  imporve  the  preparations  for  work  and  real  life  does  not  at  all
		  	mean  a  weakening  of  the  requirements  imposed  on  the  content  and  extent  of  education.
		  	Currently  a  reorganization  of  school  management  is  underway  to  achieve  a  comprehen-
		  	sive  development  of  the  student  in  light  of  a  perfected  content  and  extent  of  teach-

			 	general  schools  work  in  the  interest  of  achieving  ideological-moral  maturity  in  the
			 	youth.    	Remarkable  work  is  done  at  the  lst  s~econdary  school  of  Voru,   	at  the  Poltsamaa

			 	work  and  for  organizing  it  locally;
			 	The  study  of  work  done  in  our  republic  in  that  field,   	the  dissemination  and  imple-

			During  the  seminar  it  also  became  apparent  that:
			our  republic  lacks  a  sufficient  number  of  trained  personnel;
			the~ is  a  lack  of  germane  Estonian  literature,  not  only  scholarly  but  also  dirprted
			at  the  young,   	fathers  and  mothers;
			the  young  teachers  are  insufficiently  trained  in  directing  the  solving  of  moral
 ,	    	education  problems  in  schools  according  to  the  demands  of  the  cont~mporary  times;
			because  of  years  of  neglect  of  such  work  our  educational  personnel  is  generally
			poorly  prepared  to  carry  out  successful  moral  education  in  the  schools,   	there  is  a
			lack  of  abi.?,ity  to  see  and  formulate,   	consequently  al.so  to  use  the  aims  and  methods
			and  means  necessary  for  moral  education.    	For  this  reason  the  functional  contacts
			between  all  the  components  of  the  educational  process  have  been  violated,   	there  is
			no  consistency  in  the  shaping  of  the  student's  moral  perfection  in  the  educational
			process.    	In  this  condition  it  is  hardly  possible  to  talk  of  ineeting  the  task
 _	    	assigned  to  the  schools  by.V.   	I.   	Lenin  at.the  3d  Congress  of  the  Russian  Young
			Communist  League,   	that:    	"It  is  necessary  that  the  training,   	educating  and  teaching
			of  the  entire  contemporary  youth  be  at  the  same  time  an  education  in  communist
			morality."    	We  still  have  a  lot  of  fields  to  till.
			Solying  many  of  these  problems  does  no't  depend  on  us  alone.    	The  directing  and
 _	    	decisive  activity  of  the  leading  organs  of  the  republic  is  necessary.    	At  the  same
			time  we  can  state  with  conviction  that  an  increase  in  activity  dealing  with  problems
			of  moral  education  shows  that  there  is  obviously  an  opportunity  to  deal  with  them
			successfully.    	Our  activity  is  pointed  in  that  very  direction.
			Third.    	The  buttressing  of  the  ideological-moral  education  in  a  scientific-
			methodological  way;   	activity  in  recruiting  instructional  staff.
			Within  the  progress  of  modern  science  and  technology  the  Soviet  school  system  con-
			tributes  markedly  in  paving  the  road  to  the  development  of  society.    	The  social
  _	    	function  of  the  school  has  increased  tremendously,   	as  has  its  ideological  role.
			The  increase  of  the  ideologi~al  conflict  between  two  social  systems  has  in  turn
			raised  ser~ous  demands  regarding  the  training  of  the  educational  personnel  and  re-
			freshing  its  training.
			The  decision  of  the  Central  Committee  of  the  CPSU  "On  the  further  improvement  of
			ideological  work  and  political  education"  required  th~.t  our  teachers-educators
  -	    	achieve  an  organic  unity  in  education-training  work,   	and  perfect  the  shaping  _in  the
			students  of  the  high  political-moral  attributes  of  the  communist  world  view.
			To  be  able  to  master  the  socialist  demands  ex~ected  of  him  the  teacher  has  to  do
			mor.e  than  ever  before  ~o  retrain  himself  in  every  way.  The  teacher's  helper  in
			this  task  is  the  Institute  for  Continuing  Education  of  the  Republic's  Teachers
			together  with  the  methodological  departments  of  the  education  departments.    	The
			principle  of  organic  unity  of  teaching  and  education  that  has  been  the  basis  of
			the  teacher's  daily  praxis  has  become  the  basis  for  working  out  the  contents  and
			methods  of  teachers'   	refresher  courses.    	The  training  o�  the  teacher  for  ideological-
			moral  education  begir~s  in  college,  but  research  in  all  the  pedagogical  institutes
			of  the  USSR  has  shown  that  the  level  of  knowledge  of  the  basis  of  education  (~he
			pedagogical-psychological  preparation)   	is  lower  than  competency  iri  sub~ect  fields

			 	The  atages  of  educational  refzesher  training  in  cur  republic  take  this  lnto  account,
			 	and  the  theory  and  methodology  of  educational  questions  are  the  largest  subject  areas
  -				in  the  courses.    	The  problems  of  communist  education  are  especially  dominant  in  the
			  	first,   	educational  stages  of  the  course.    	The  courses  of  this  stage  include  moetly
			 	problems  of  Marxist-Leninist  theory,   	the  theory  and  methodology  of  education,~edu-	 	~
			 	cation  in  the  teaching  process,   	the  party  and  Komsomol  activity  in  the  school,  work
			  	in  and  out  of  class,  questions  of  education  within  the  family,  problems  of  the  class
			 	director's  work,   	etc.    	The  main  topic  of  the  second  state  courses  involves  psycholog-
			 	ical  problems.    	Thus  in  the  course  of  continuing  education  the  young  specialist
			 	acquires  sufficient  knowledge  of  ideological-moral  teaching.
			 	The  third  level  for  imparting  training  in  ideological-moral  education  consists  of
			 	organizers  and  school  directors..   	They  attend  regional  and  all-republican  seminars,
			  	they  are  shown  the  experiences  made  in  our  republic  and  in  other  federal  republics.
			 	The  teacher  is  generally  receptive  to  help,  direction  and  teaching,  but  there  is
			 	still  enough  conservatism  and  routin~e  in  implementing  the  knowledge  gained.    	Too
			 	often  the  student  is  regarded  as  an  ob3ect  of  training  in  ideological-moral  educa-
			  	Lion.    	He  is  uaed  in  testing  all  kinds  of  possible  and  impossible  ideas.    	The  part  of
			 	the  student  in  thinking  and  carrying  out  this  educational  attempt  has  remained
			 	scanty.    	Our  t~achers  sometimes  do  not  even  think  of  the  person  to  whom  the  lesson
			 	or  event  is  directed.    	In  other  words--the  student  is  not  regarded  as  the  subject
			 	of  educational  work.
			 	Modern  education  demands  that  colleges  prepare  young  specialists  who  have  been
			 	trained  to  the  highest  possible  level  in  organizing  the  initiative  and  self-training
			 	of  the  student.    	The  moral  deviations  of  the  students  show  clearly  that  there  are
			 	serious  deficiencies  in  that  work.    	An  analysis  of  school  practice  shows  that  these
			 	phenomena  are  to  a  large  degree  connected  to  a  one-sided,  i.e.   	authoritarian  in-
			 	fluence  shown  by  the  teacher.    	We  cannot  agree  with  such  a  formalistic  interpre-
			 	tation  of  the  teacher's  role.    	Again  and  again  we  are  directed  to  correct  methodolog-
			 	ical  positions  by  the  most  valuable  achievements  of  Soviet  education.    	First  of  all,
			 	let  us  pay  attention  to  the  method  of  parallel  pedagogical  activity,  described  by
			 	A.  Makarenko  and  proven  in  his  educational  work.    	The  teacher-educator  and  the
			 	children  belong  to  the  same  collective.    	By  living  together  with  the  students,  by
			 	st4ari.ng  their  ~oys,   	sorrows  3nd  concerns  the  teacher  brings  his  students  up  to
			 	so~iali~t  maturity.    	Such  activity  is  designed  to  meet  the  task  posed  by  the  26th
 -				Congress  of  the  CPSi1  regarding  fulfillment  of  ti:~  Jciioos.'s  moral  mission,   	i.e.   	to
			 	increase  the  ties  between  teaching  and  actual  life  and  to  improve  the  preparation
			 	of  the  students  for  a  socially  useful  role.    	The  ideological  decisions  of  the  Central
  ~				Committee  of  the  CPSU  and  the  decisions  of  the  26th  Congress  re~uire  that  we  switch
			 	from  an  informative  training  of  the  teaching  body  to  a  methodological  one.    	The  task
			 	is  not  easy,   	but  life  with  its  demands  has  put  it  before  us  in  total  focus.    	This,
			 	however,  means  that  the  continuing  edueation  of  teachers  must  adopt  more  active
			 	methods.    	We  are  hoping  for  assistance~from  the  Academy  of  Sciences  of  the  Estonian
			 	SSR  and  the  institutes  of  higher  education.    	No  other  institution  can  open  the
			 	methodological  and  cnoral  aspects  of  the  various  branches  of  learning  to  the  teacher,
			 	cf  cau~e  him  to  adopt  a  new,   	investigative  way  of  thinking.
			 	In  the  interest  of  raising  the  teachers'   	level  of  ideological-nor.al  knowledge  it
			 	must  be  seriously  investigated  how  the  teacher's  political  and  subject  matter  re-

	     	so  as   	to  be  able  to  deeply  comprehend  and  fathom  the  ideological-moral  content  of
			the  tasks  posed  by  the  26th  Congress  of  the  CPSU  and  to  find  ways  to  meet  them.
  -	   	A  wait-and-see  attitude  is  completely  counterindicated.
  =	   	Let  us  here  try  to  fathom  just  one  of  these  tasks--to  raise  the  quality  of  teaching.
  -	   	The  easiest  way,  to  interpret  this   	task  formalistically  would  be  to  compile  another
			program  of  events.    	In  the  correct  approach  we  are  required  to  perceive  the  dia-
			lectical  connections  between  real  problems  and  the  practical  application  of  inethod-
			ological  expressions.
			Let  us   	then  repeat  the  posed  task  of  raiaing  the  quality  of  education.    	In  our
  -	   	opinion  the  following  processes  become  involved  in  the  pursuit  of  that  aim:
			to  formulate  general  and  specific   	tasks  of  education  on  the  basis  of  curricula;
			to  train  students  to  acquire  knowledge  independently;
			to  shape   	the  practical  ability  to  apply  knowledge   	(in  school  work,  in  socially
			useful  work);
			to  organize  a  qualitative  evaluation  of  the  student's  work.
			Each  of   	these  real  processes  is  inf luenced  by  a  complex  of  factors.    	The  first
			process   	listed  by  us  is  influenced  by  such  factors  as:
  _	    	the  teacher's  qualification,  his  zbility  to  comprehend  and  describe  the  concept
			of  quality  of  knowledge  (the  depth,   	completeness,   	system,   	flexibility,  adaptability,
  -	    	etc  of  his   	training) ;
			the  teacher's  abil3ty  to  formulate  assignments  and  to  evaluate  the  quality  of  their
			fulfillment;
		 	the  knowledge  of  the  student  body  and  its  motivational  sphere;
		 	the  condition  of  the  material  basis  of  education,   	etc.
			From  such  factors  we  can  derive  concrete  tasks  for  the  teacher,   	the  student,   	the
  -	    	school,   	and  other  areas;   	this  is  vital  to  implement  the  listed  factors.    	From  this
			approach  we  guarantee  a  uniform  content  and  extent  of  each  student's  education,   	con-
		 	sequently  also  the  acquisition  and   	correct  evaluation  of  the  moral  values  of  our
		 	society.    	The  forms,  methods  and  means  for  solving  the  tasks  facing  Soviet  schools
		 	are  varied,  depending  on  the  creative  activity  of  the  teacher,  and  also  depending
		 	on  the  basic  task  we  have--to  educate  a  comprehensively  developed  personality.
		 	During  the  last  five-year  plan  the   	Institute  for  Scientific  Study  of  Education
		 	also  took  marked  interest  in  investigating  the  question  of  ideological-moral  edu-
		 	cation,   	and  the  incorporation  of   	these  findings  into  practical  schoolwork.    	One

			  	students."    	The  institute  has  paid  great  attention  to  effecting  ideological  educa-
			  	tion  through  some  concrete  sub~ect  or  cluster  of  subjects.    	No  sub3ect  has  been
			  	exempted  from  research  into  the  student's  ideological  education.    	This  is  necessi-
			  	tated  by  the  fact   	that  one  important  requirement  in  compiling  any  program  o.f  stud~es
			  	is  its  impact  on  ideological  education.
  -				Topics  concerned  with  the  students'   	communist  education  cannot  be  exhausted'by  the
			  	PTUI  nor  even  by  all  the  efforts  of  the  researchers  of  our  republic.    	We  ther~fore
			  	hold  that  the  rich  experiences  made  across  the  country  be  adopted.    	The  following
			  	topics  are  currently  being  adapted  by  the  PTUI:    	The  student's  moral  education  in
			  	the  comprehensive  school;  principles  of  internationalist  education  in  teaching
			  	basic  subjects;   	the  students'   	ideological-aesthetical  education.    	The  list  of  topics
			  	is  to  be  expanded  in  the  future.
			  	The  communist  education  of  inembers  of  the  future  society  cannot  be  successful
 _				if   	the  home  does  not  participate.    	The  PTUI  scholars  have  therefore,  in  addition
			  	to  other  projects,   	attempted  to  investigate  moral  education  in  the  family.    	During
			  	the  last  f ive-year  plan  PTUI  scholars  put  together  4  compilations  and  one  brochure
			  	for  use  by  parents.
			  	It  is   	important  that  the  existi:~g,   	still  relatively  scarce  ideological-methodologi-
			  	cal  literature  dealing  with  a  student's  moral  education  reach  every  teach~r  and  be
  _				applied  in  his  daily  work  at  school.
			  	The  main  task  for   	the  immediate  future  facing  the  Ministry  of  Education  of  the
			  	Estonian  SSR  and  the  organs  of  education  is  an  application  of  the  comprehensive
			  	education  system  and  of  each  of  its  components  in  such  a  way  that  the  educational
 -				requirements  of  the  26th  Congress  of  the  CPSU  will  be  successfully  met.
