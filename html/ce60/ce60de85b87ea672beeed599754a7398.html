 er leadership had to make significant adjustments to maintain its credibil-
 ity. The regime, for example, moved aggressively and with a. large measure
 of success:
 ? To expand unofficial ties abroad.

 President Chiang Ching-kuo hopes to guide the island through a controlled
 political evolution that will transfer power to the next generation and from
 mainlander to primarily Taiwanese hands by the late 1980s or early 1990s.
 This paper questions the conventional wisdom that a Taiwanese-dominated
 government would adopt an even more intransigent position on reunifica-
 tion and contact with China. We believe such a government would still look
 to the United States for backing, but that it would also feel more confident
 of broad-based popular support and in a stronger position to explore more
 flexible and creative approaches to the mainland. This paper argues that a
 dominant Taiwanese leadership would:
 ? Be less preoccupied with vying with Beijing for US support.
 ? Become somewhat more willing to accommodate Beijing's interest in
 opening a dialogue.
 Beijing, however, is likely to fear that such a transfer of power would end
 its hopes for peaceful reunification. Beijing believes that US arms sales
 encourage Taiwan's resistance to negotiations and, in addition, that steps
 toward reunification must be well under way before the mainlander
 leadership in Taipei is replaced. Thus; as the Taiwanese slowly become
 more powerful over the next several years, we believe Beijing probably will
 intensify pressure on the United States to encourage Taiwan to negotiate.
 Over the longer term, and to the extent that a Taiwanese leadership is re-
 sponsive to Beijing's proposals, we believe that this pressure might decline.
 Thus, such a shift by Taipei could help defuse the Taiwan issue as a major
 irritant in US-China relations.

 The trend toward a peaceful transfer of power on Taiwan is by no means
 assured:
 ? Those dissatisfied with the pace of change could try to hasten or slow the
 process, provoking political instability.
 ? The government is trying to move the island's labor-intensive economy
 toward high technology. Because the Taiwanese control the private sector
 so completely-and have profited the most from the island's rapid
 economic growth-prolonged recession could lead them to challenge
 mainlander management, especially if the prospect of a greater sharing
 of political power proves illusory.

 Political Evolution on Taiwan:
 Implications for
 the United States
 US Role in Taiwan's Security and Stability
 Taiwan leaders have looked to the United States as
 the island's primary security guarantor for the past 30
 years and still regard that support as critical to
 domestic political stability. During the 1950s and
 1960s, Taiwan believed it faced a China determined
 to "liberate" the island by force. Military clashes in
 1954, 1958, and 1962 fed this fear. In 1954 Taiwan
 signed a Mutual Defense Treaty with the United
 States, agreed to the stationing of US troops and
 aircraft on the island, and sought US training for its
 The 1972 trip by then President Nixon to China and
 the subsequent issuance of the Shanghai Communi-
 que came as a shock to a Taiwan leadership that had
 grown accustomed to and dependent upon close US
 ties. But the declining US presence on the island,
 signaled most obviously by the withdrawal of all US
 military personnel, created no significant domestic
 problems for Taipei, primarily because Washington
 maintained diplomatic relations with Taipei, and the
 defense treaty remained in force.
 In the 1970s Taiwan's international diplomatic status
 eroded seriously. Following its expulsion from the
 United Nations in 1971, most countries established
 relations with Beijing and severed ties to Taiwan.
 This, too, caused great concern on the island but was
 manageable because the US link remained in place.
 The primary domestic problem provoked by Taiwan's
 increasing isolation was the perception that its claim
 to sovereignty over the mainland was being under-
 mined by Taipei's increasing diplomatic isolation.F_
 In 1979, however, the US severance of all official ties
 with Taiwan became the catalyst for increased politi-
 cal unrest on the island. Resentment among the
 Taiwanese majority over the continued political domi-
 nation of the mainlanders intensified and coalesced
 around a group of young Taiwanese, anti-Kuomintang
 (KMT) radicals and their political journal, Formosa
 Magazine. Following US recognition of Beijing, this
 group apparently believed the regime was vulnerable
 and adopted increasingly confrontational tactics, cul-
 minating in a December 1979 Human Rights Day
 rally in the southern port city of Kaohsiung. After the
 demonstrators attacked police, the government arrest-
 ed the ringleaders and broke the back: of the move-
 ment.
 Since then, the leadership has strengthened its posi-
 tion and made the most of Taiwan's unique interna-
 tional status. To avoid complete isolation, Taiwan
 developed a new form of diplomacy, which it terms
 "substantive relations." Building on its strong eco-     25X1
 nomic ties to Japan and the West, Taipei has devel-
 oped extensive unofficial political ties.. Taipei has
 trumpeted these developments, stressing that the is-
 land is not totally dependent upon the United States.
 This has restored some credibility to the regime's
 claim to legitimacy, although in the eyes of senior
 leaders it is no substitute for formal relations.
 KMT in Transition
 At the same time, the ruling KMT has begun to play
 down its publicly proclaimed goal to retake the main-   25X1
 land. Traditionally, "Return to the mainland" had
 been the party's primary mission; now, the banner
 hanging outside the headquarters of the Taipei mu-
 nicipal party headquarters reads: "Service to the
 people."
 The shift in goal has been accompanied by significant
 reforms in the political system and especially in the
 KMT. Since the death of Chiang Kai-shek in 1975,
 his son, President Chiang Ching-kuo, has moved to
 prepare the island for the ethnic and generational      25X1
 succession that will occur near the end of the 1980s.
 This "Taiwanization" of the regime means that the
 aging mainlanders will eventually be succeeded by a
 group composed of both ethnic Taiwanese and youn-
 ger "mainlanders," who were either born on Taiwan
 or came to the island when very young.

 b As of December 1982.
 The composition of party membership as a whole, in
 fact, is changing. The KMT is now young-60 per-
 cent of the members are under 35-and primarily
 middle class, closely resembling the island's demo-
 graphics. At the top, the all-powerful KMT Central
 Standing Committee is now one-third Taiwanese.
 Although these men are less powerful than the main-
 land members, they are younger and therefore should
 assume more influential positions after current gov-
 ernment and party leaders-most of whom are in
 their seventies and eighties-pass from the scene (see
 table 1).
 The rebuilding of the KMT from the bottom up, a
 process that also began during the late 1970s, is
 perhaps more important. Since 1977, when Chiang
 ordered the party to contest local elections fairly-
 rather than stuffing ballot boxes-the KMT has been
 forced to adopt new ways. Now, it must find good
 candidates, help them win, and then support them
 after they are elected. In order to do all this, the KMT
 launched new membership drives and revamped its
 local party offices. These offices are now the frontline
 for the party's new emphasis on public service. Local
 offices help citizens find jobs, file their income taxes,
 settle disputes with local governments, and provide
 meeting halls for local cultural organizations.
 Activities at this level now closely resemble typical
 ward-style politics. Those lower level party members
 who are responsible for KMT success at the polling
 place now represent a strong force for reforms to
 make the party even more responsive to local con-
 cerns. Most are young, college-educated Taiwanese.
 Those mainlanders who remain are required to speak
 Taiwanese. And, as is the case at the top of the party,
 the local Taiwanese are much younger than their
 mainlander counterparts
 Changes at the midlevel of the party are coming more
 slowly. Only one department is headed by a Taiwan-
 ese, and the most powerful, the Organizational Af-
 fairs Department, is still headed by a mainlander with
 strong security credentials. His three deputies, howev-
 er, are all young,'well-educated Taiwanese.
 At the next higher level, the Central Committee is not
 well stocked with Taiwanese. There are only 31-
 about 21 percent. But we believe that Taiwanese
 membership will increase dramatically at the next
 party congress, probably in 1986.
 Changes in the Government. Similar changes are
 taking place in the government. Like the party's
 standing committee, Taiwan's cabinet is now almost
 one-half Taiwanese. Again, the Taiwanese are less
 powerful than the mainlanders, and significantly
 younger (see table 2)~
 In central government departments, however, reform
 has not kept pace with changes in the party. We
 expect that change here will be slower, but most of
 these positions are limited to policy implementation.
 Policy formulation continues to reside in the party

 over any Chinese attempt to bring about reunification
 by other than peaceful means. The younger mainland-
 ers share this view and have been instrumental in
 persuading their elders to promote economic and
 informal relations abroad.

 distrust of Beijing, but they also fear that the older

 At the local level, officials are almost all Taiwanese.
 County magistrates, local assemblymen and speakers,
 and urban mayors and city councils are all popularly
 elected. At the next level, the mayors of Taipei and
 Kaohsiung and the governor of Taiwan are all Tai-
 wanese, although appointed rather than elected. The
 one provincial and two city assemblies are also over-
 whelmingly Taiwanese.
 As a result of these changes in the party and govern-
 ment, new groupings are emerging with different
 views on major questions such as ties to the United
 States, the island's international status, and future
 economic planning. In our view, this development
 already has begun to complicate policymaking and to
 generate more debate on key issues.
 Taiwanese in the KMT. Mainlander leaders have long
 sought to justify their continued political dominance
 by pointing to their success in maintaining close ties
 with the United States-ties they claim are essential
 to the island's security. Rising young Taiwanese
 officials, along with younger mainlanders, agree that
 US arms and security guarantees are important. Still,
 they are concerned about what they see as excessive
 reliance on the United States. Consequently, they put
 much more stress on domestic political and economic
 developments than on relations with Washington, or
 competition with Beijing. In fact, they claim that
 Taiwan's security and stability are enhanced more by
 its international economic position and peaceful politi-
 cal evolution. Success in these areas, they argue,
 attracts investors and trade and generates concern in
 strike a deal with Beijing to ensure continued main-
 lander dominance on the island. In fact, mainlander
 concern about the possibility of provoking a Taiwan-
 ese revolt has been an important factor in Taipei's      25X1
 adamant opposition to opening any kind of dialogue
 with Beijing.
 Taiwanese views of China and the United States have
 been shaped by different experiences than those of the
 mainlander elite. They took no part in the civil war
 against the Communists; remarkably few of them
 have been educated in the United States (more were
 educated in Japan); and they come, by and large, from
 business and political rather than military or security   25X1
 backgrounds. Simply being a member of the Taiwan-
 ese majority also means that they feel less need to
 justify their positions on security grounds than does
 the present leadership. Because of this, they also feel
 less need for tangible displays of US support. F          25X1
 Taiwanese often lampoon the pretensions of the senior
 leaders that they rule all of China. In addition,         25X1
 Taiwanese-owned newspapers and political journals
 frequently satirize the efforts of the Foreign Ministry
 to maintain formal diplomatic ties with small Third
 World countries.
 The Younger Mainlanders. Another group, which is
 likely to play an increasingly influential role in policy-
 making, comprises the sons of the present mainlander
 elite. We believe these young mainlanders recognize
 that they are unlikely to inherit their fathers' power
 and that they will be a minority in future govern-
 ments. As a result, many of them have made a strong
 effort to cultivate close ties with influential Taiwanese

 politicians. Their connections, knowledge of foreign
 affairs, and foreign languages will, at the least,
 guarantee them some influence in future govern-
 ments.
 Many younger mainlanders are just as critical of
 current policies as their Taiwanese colleagues and
 have begun to question senior leaders who place more
 value on the form than on the substance of Taipei's
 foreign relations. These younger mainlanders already
 are exploring ways of dealing with the mainland that
 are quite different from and sometimes even offensive
 to the current leadership. For example, Sung Chu-yu,
 current director of the Government Information Of-
 fice and son of the late Lieutenant General Sung Ta,
 a close associate of President Chiang, has ended the
 ban on factual reporting on life in China, in the
 apparent belief that Taiwan can only profit by the
 comparison
 Another example is Wei Yung, currently the head of
 a research organization under Premier Sun, who has
 put forward the highly controversial "Multisystems
 Nation" theory-which would allow Taiwan to merge
 nominally with China but remain independent in
 fact-as a possible solution to the problem of reunifi-
 cation. Several other younger mainlanders have told
 US officials privately that they subscribe to a similar
 notion, the "German formula," for reunification,
 whereby one Chinese nation is divided into two
 political states.

 Despite the fact that the Taiwanese and younger
 mainlanders are playing an increasing role in the
 government and KMT, they still have little input into
 decisions related to national security. Thus, our views
 of how they would behave when they actually take
 power remain speculative
 Judging by their present attitudes, however, we be-
 lieve that they would be inclined to adopt a more
 flexible attitude toward a dialogue with Beijing. The
 first moves could come in the form of more favorable
 responses to longstanding Chinese proposals designed
 to pave the way for eventual negotiations. These
 include direct trade, travel, and correspondence. Tai-
 wanese businessmen, who dominate the private sector,
 have repeatedly been critical of Taipei's ban on trade
 with the Chinese mainland. Some local Taiwanese
 politicians have also been critical of the current
 leadership's sharp limits on athletic, intellectual, and
 cultural exchanges with China.
 When Taipei agreed to invite a team from Beijing to
 participate in an international baseball tournament on
 the island, Taiwanese-owned newspapers were the
 most supportive, while the official Central Daily
 News was noncommittal. In private conversations
 with US officials, Taiwanese politicians have argued
 in favor of increased exchanges, not because they
 agree with Beijing's view that they would eventually
 lead to reunification, but because it might reduce the
 pressure China places on both Taiwan and the United
 States to begin the process. These officials are critical
 of what they term the current leadership's "paranoia"
 about such activities and of the resulting policy of "no
 contacts." These politicians believe that this approach
 denies the island a useful ploy to use against the
 mainland and leaves the island's security, in their
 view, overly dependent on decisions made in Washing-
 ton.
 A Taiwanese-dominated leadership, more confident of
 popular support, would in our view see itself in a
 stronger position to take such steps. Further down the
 road, and after a suitable preparatory period, this
 confidence might lead them to negotiate with Beijing.
 Even if some kind of agreement could be worked out,
 however, Taiwanese officials have made it clear that
 they would insist on the island maintaining its own
 military and having access to foreign military sup-
 plies.
 For its part, Beijing views the emergence of a predom-
 inantly Taiwanese leadership with considerable trepi-
 dation, primarily because it fears that the Taiwanese
 would be more likely to declare Taiwan independent.
 Indeed, China has long pinned its hopes on reaching
 an accommodation with the present leadership in
 Taipei and has tailored its reunification initiatives to
 appeal to the mainlander elite rather than the Tai-
 wanese majority. At the same time, Deng Xiaoping

 repeatedly has warned that any declaration of inde-
 pendence could lead Beijing to abandon its peaceful
 reunification policy and possibly invade the island.F
 Some Taiwanese politicians, on and off the island,
 have in fact advocated independence from the main-
 land, but we believe that most recognize the risks of
 such a step, not only of a Chinese invasion but also of
 a loss of US support. As a result, we believe Taiwan-
 ese leaders would be prepared to live with the island's
 The recent demotion and transfer of General Wang
 Sheng, then head of the General Political Warfare
 Department, and a symbol of opposition to Taiwanese
 political aspirations, was accomplished relatively easi-

 problem.
 present anomalous status indefinitely.
 Problem Areas
 Despite Chiang's initial successes in rebuilding the
 party, a backlash within the military or security
 services against the reforms could still threaten future
 political stability. So, too, could increasing economic
 problems.
 The Security Services. We believe that the security
 services represent the greatest obstacle to eventual
 Taiwanization of the government and party. The
 garrison command and the police have monitored and
 checked Taiwanese political activity since the 1940s,
 and there is a strong residue of suspicion on both
 sides.
 With one exception-Chen Shou-shan, commander of
 the Taiwan Garrison General Headquarters-main-
 landers still man all key security posts. We believe
 that there probably are increasing numbers of Tai-
 wanese at lower levels, but they are unlikely to reach
 senior positions soon
 Most of the security services' efforts have been aimed
 at anti-KMT dissidents, but we believe that the
 security services look askance at all Taiwanese politi-
 cal activity, even that going on within the KMT. We
 also believe that the security services fear that a
 future Taiwanese leadership might be less willing to
 crack down on what they see as the activities of anti-
 KMT Taiwanese.
 The security services, therefore, could come into
 conflict with future Taiwanese civilian leaders. Presi-
 dent Chiang has been careful to stress military subor-
 dination to civilians in his selection of top officers.
 Regular Military. Opposition to Taiwanization could
 also come from the military, but most high-ranking
 military officers seem resigned to the eventual trans-   25X1
 fer of power to a Taiwanese civilian leadership. The
 changes that took place within the party and govern-
 ment during the late 1970s are beginning to occur in
 the military. Although there are only about a dozen
 Taiwanese general officers, a review of those just
 below flag rank indicates that their numbers will
 increase significantly by the end of the decade. Enlist-
 ed men are overwhelmingly Taiwanese, as are most
 low-ranking officers.
 Any future opposition from this quarter would be
 constrained by fears that serious civilian-military
 tensions would be exploited by Beijing. Like the senior
 mainlander political elite, the military believes that
 China might undertake military action against the     25X1
 island at any time and are reluctant to participate in
 activities that might trigger such a move.
 Economic Reform. Concurrent with its efforts to
 rebuild the KMT, Taipei- is trying to retool its econo-
 my. Low rates of population growth and increased
 prosperity have pushed labor costs up sharply on the
 island. Thus, Taiwan's traditional labor-intensive ex-
 ports face new challenges from countries with cheaper
 labor, such as China, Malaysia, and Sri Lanka. We
 believe that Taiwan's senior economic managers will
 ultimately be successful in promoting more technol-
 ogy-intensive industries, but the transition period may
 be difficult. Taipei has already announced that it

 expects growth rates over the next decade will be
 lower than those of the previous two, but the govern-
 ment is optimistic that the economic reforms will
 strengthen the island's competitive position in the
 international marketplace. Because the KMT has
 been able to use high rates of growth to mute
 Taiwanese discontent over mainlander dominance,
 progress on economic reform will remain important
 for political stability. This is especially true because
 most of the island's senior economic managers are
 mainlanders, while the private sector is almost exclu-
 sively Taiwanese.
 Implications for the United States
 The coalition of Taiwanese and young mainlanders
 that will be running Taiwan by the end of this decade,
 in our view, will still require US arms and security
 guarantees. Beyond this, however, we believe that this
 group will have less need to demand other demonstra-
 tions of US support in order to legitimatize its
 domestic political position. The new leaders are also
 likely to be less concerned about improvements in US-
 Chinese relations coming at Taiwan's expense as long
 as the Taiwan Relations Act remains in place and
 arms sales continue. Thus, we believe Taipei will
 become less inclined to try to disrupt US-Chinese
 relations, which some current leaders still believe is
 the best way to bolster Taiwan's own position.
 Whether or not the new leadership would be willing to
 discuss reunification with the Chinese, we believe that
 they will be less rigidly opposed to responding to some
 of Beijing's initiatives. To some extent, they will be
 forced to do this to allay fears in Beijing that their
 accession means that reunification will never take
 place. Such moves might help defuse the Taiwan issue
 as a major irritant in US-Chinese relations-especial-
 ly, of course, if this leads eventually to a negotiated
 settlement that would allow Beijing to claim that
 reunification had taken place.
