The Department adds that if this approach Is unfavorably received by the British and French, the US Is prepared to consider the acceptance of the Soviet mark on the basis of its autonomous use in the three western sectors. The US would make such acceptance conditional upon Biltish and French willingness to agree formally to the establishment of the western mark by 30 January 1949 In the western sectors, if there Ms been no Soviet agreement to the western counter-proposal by that date. The Depart,- ment believes that the reply of the western powers to the Technical Committee should declare that: (a) this counter- proposal is the only possible basis for western use of the Soviet Zone mark; and (b) unless there is prior agreement along these lines, the western governments will soon be compelled to make a complete change-over to the western 1113" mark in their sectors. 2.

CHINA: Nationalists ask mediation by major powers--The Chinese Acting Foreign Minister handed similar aide memoires on 8 January to the US, French, Soviet and British ambassa- dors inviting their governments to mediate the Chinese civil war. US Ambassador Stuart reports his agreement with French and British ambassadors that by this move the Chinese Government is playing for time and is trying to avoid the loss of face which would be involved in a direct approach to the Communists. The ambassadors point out that if the Government were sincerely interested in such nego- tiations, it could undertake them without outside assistance. The three ambassadors further believe there is little chance of successful mediation because it is unlikely that the USSR would participate in good faith. _Cl....iot!...w.wstancse.:12124--US Embassy Nanking reportsommunist rejection of recent Nationalist peace offers has strengthened Chiang Kai- shek's conviction that true peace negotiations with the Com- munists are impossible and that the Government must conse- quently continue the fight "all the way to Taiwan" if necessary.

(Accord- ing to the UN partition plan, the Negeb-Transjordan road crosses both Arab and Israeli territory.) The Acting Secre- tary expressed the view that "real security" lies, not in any particular road in the Negeb, but in encouraging the development d a western outlook in Israel. Bevin also wished to know whether the US was prepared to back the various Security Council cease-fire resolutions. The Acting Secretary declared that although these resolutions are certainly valid in their aptolication to a momentary military situation, they do not delineate a final political settlement, as Bevin apparently considers. He concluded that if the UK attempted to arm the Arabs, such action would be in violation cl the SC resolutions and would make it necessary for the US to consider lifting its arms embargo. S.

Neither does the Kremlin expect the US or the western governments to give serious consideration to the avowed Soviet desire for east-west agreement. The Kremlin is attempting to weaken the position of the western powers and to delay positive western action by propaganda designed to: (a) create the illusion that the west- ern powers, led by the US, are blocking an equitable solution of east-west problems; (b) ostensibly alleviate world tension In an attempt to persuade the new US Congress that current proposals for defense and foreign aid expenditures are un- necessary; (c) instill doubt and hesitation, both in the US and in western Europe, concerning the need for participa- tion in the proposed Atlantic Pact; and (d) enable the Com- munist Parties in western Europe to regain some of the prestige and popular support last during the recent months of direct action. In making this tactical shift in its propaganda approach now, the Kremlin probably desired to take ad- vantage of: (a) the convening of the US, 81st Congress; (b) the appointment of a new US Secretary. cd State; (c) German dissatisfaction with, and western European misgivings over, the recent Ruhr decisions; and (d) the current discussions concerning the Atlantic Pact Adoption of this propaganda line, however, has not committed the USSR to any specific course of action. The USSR can be expected to emphasize this approach as long as the Kremlin considers that it Is con- tributing to the long-range Soviet program to defeat western recovery and defense efforts. On the other band, the USSR will probably make still another tactical propaganda shift if the present approach encounters vigoEmmeniksigtvince. - - NO CHANGE in Class.

Accord- ing to the Embassy, the Italian Foreign Office is fully aware of British and Belgian opposition to Italy's inclusion in the Atlantic Pact, but hopes that the US will support an invita- tion to Italy.. The Foreign Office believes that such support would have "the greatest weight" with the UK.� 7 2.

According to the Department, the US Joint Chiefs of Staff feel strongly that omission of Italy from either the Atlantic or Brussels Pacts is militarily unrealistic. The Depart- ment considers that the objectives of avoiding an unfavorable Italian reaction and strengthening Italian ties with the west would not be achieved by: (a) admitting Italy to limited mem- bership in the Atlantic Pact; or (b) issuing a statement that the Pact members would react strongly to any attack on Italy. 133E C.I.A.

According to the plan, during the current Geneva meeting, the US, the UK, and France would: (a) again stress their objections to the UN Neutral Committee's preliminary plan; (b) urge reconsideration of the US counterproposal as a "stand-still interim" solution affording protection to all four powers in a split city, to be accompanied by an agreement to lift the blockade and hold an early meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers; (c) indicate their will- ingness, upon the lifting of the blockade, to negotiate through the military governors reunification of the city administra- tion; and (d) express their willingness, if these negotiations are successful, to reconsider the Neutral Committee's preliminary plan, or a new plan, for the use of a single currency under a uniform city administration. The Depart- ment feels that this "new approach" would place the western powers on record as proposing a positive workable arrange- ment and would furnish the US with a concrete program for future discussion in the SC. 2. tlorwav's Position in defense discussions weakening-- Norwegian Foreign Minister Lange Ms expressed to US Ambassador Bay in Oslo concern that his fight against Swedish neutrality and in favor of the Atlantic Pact has been made more difficult by recent press reports under a Washington dateline implying that the US might supply defense equipment to a neutral Scandinavian bloc. Bay believes that Lange's present leadership in the Scandina- vian defense talks may be threatened unless the US again makes it clear that a neutral Scandinavian bloc cannot expect more consideration than Scandinavian nations singly. Lange also reported increasing opposition in Norway against an alliance with the west. - 1 Qocuraent No. NO CHANGE in Class�. 0 __�,---- THE C.I.A.

British views of recent Soviet moves�According to US Embassy Larnaca, the Britkb foreign Office regards recent Soviet moves (winding the 28 janury statement on Western Union and the Atlantic Pact, the nate to Norway, and the 30 'miry Stalin interview) as part al the saw Soviet "peace offensive" to handicap or prevent further consolidation of the west. The Foreign Office emblem that the underlying reason for Soviet action at this time is the Kremlin's serious concern over the success at the Ituropean recovery program, the recent decision of the Western Unice powers to establish a European council, and the tmminence of the completion of an Atlantic Pact. 'the Foreign Office concludes that the pres- ent Soviet moves should prompt the US to "key up" all activi- ties building the strength of the west. 2.

ANNEX, 3 February 1949 STALIN'S PRESS INTERVIEWS The dramatic and unprecedented intensification of the current Soviet propaganda"peace offensive," as revealed by Stalin's action in proposing a meeting *li President Truman, reflects the grave and increasing amdety of the Kremlin over the progress of western defensive planning and economic recovery in western Europe. Stalin's inter- views also reveal the conthmed determination of the Kremlin to prevent the containment of the USSR by an increasingly strong western bloc. By presenting his proposal for a Truman-Stalin meeting through the press rather than through official channels, Stalin Ins not committed the USSR to any speci- fic action and Ins been able to exploit the hope of the' world for peace. The insincerity ci Stalin's proposal 113 revealed by his refusal to meet President Truman outside the Soviet orbit, which is actually an attempt to create the impression that the West must go to Stalin. Although Stalin's health might keep him from making the long Journey to Washington, it presumably would not prevent him from going to a nearby country outside the Soviet orbit. Moreover, if the Kremlin were sincere in its desire to meet the West halfway, Stalin would not have made his proposal to the US alone. This approach was undoubtedly designed to create disunity among the western powers and to arouse the suspicions of the non- Communist world concerning the good faith and reliability of the US. Thus, although the Kremlin would welcome a Truman-Stalin meeting on Soviet terms, Stalin's recent statements offer no evidence of any change in basic Soviet policy toward the West or of any relaxation of Soviet efforts toward the expansion of world Communism.

Soviet concern over this development had already been expressed in the Kremlin's blunt note to Norway and In the recent Soviet "White Paper" on the Pact.. Although the USSR, owing to the proximity of Norway, is unquestion- ably dishwbed over possible Norwegbin adherence to the Atlantic Pact, the latest Soviet maneuver reflects Soviet determinants to prevent, delay, or at least minimise, the entire western defense effort. � ,� Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749334 Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749334 GENERAL 1.

US Embassy Buenos Aires comments that even though the situation is tense and the administration is deeply concerned, there is little likeli- hood that Peron will resign. (CIA Comment: CIA concurs in the Embassy's estimate. Although the present crisis may bring a major reorganization and re-orientation of the Argentine Government, Peron's offer to resign was probably a gesture to force alignment behind his position on a major issue of economic policy.) -2 - Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749334 Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749334 GENERAL 11 FEB 1949 910 1.

Retorted shift in Dutch policy _on Indonesia�The Netherlands Vtreign Office has informed US Ambassador Baruch that as a result of the resignation of the Minister for Overseas Terri- tories, Dutch policy toward Indonesia will probably develop along the lines laid dawn by the Security Council resolution, particularly with respect to both liberation of Republic= offi- cials and participation by the UN Commission in the negotia- tions for the establishment of a federal Indonesian govern- ment. Dutch Foreign Minister Stikker subsequently told Baruch that he will accept the resignation of the Dutch High Commissioner for Indonesia if the Commissioner refuses to release the captured Republican leaders. According to Baruch, Stikker believes that if his ideas prevail and Republi- can demands "do not prove too drastic and unreasonable," the Netherlands can transfer sovereignty to a federal Indo- nesian government by 1 jelly. 2.

The French instead propose that the creation of a special currency for Berlin be studied as a possible solution; and if such a proposal is found to be unworkable that the western mark be introduced in a way which would not attach Berlin to the western German bank- ing system.

CIA .does not believe, however, that the USSR is preparing to take precipitate action in Manchuria. Soviet political maneuvers designed to secure eventual Soviet control of Manchuria are apparently already in process, but these will probably con- tinue to be gradualistic, especially in view of the obvious complications that would ensue with the Chinese Communists If rapid action were taken.) 37)ocument No. TO H:C 7 --7TSCTION NO.

Spaak expressed the view that if the French were, as he understood, holding out for a similar charter member- ship for Italy, their position was "unfortunate and unneces- sary.'' According to US Ambassador Caffery, however, French Foreign Minister Schuman has informed the British Embassy in Paris that his Government's approval of an immediate affirmative response to the Norwegian Govern- ment is unconditional and not tied to the Italian question, although the French attach the greatest importance to an early and favorable decision on Italy.

Schuman explained that Italy's inclusion in the Pact is a matter of major psychological importance to the French, because without Italy the French people would say they had been placed "on one of the wings" of a defense system. US Ambassador Kirk in Brussels reports that a high official the Belgian Foreign Ministry has expressed a strong feeling that both Italy and Norway should be included as initial signatories of the Pact.

Embassy Moscow's view of Molotov's shift�US Embassy Moscow expresses the view that the Soviet Government's action in relieving Molotov as Foreign Minister and Mikoyan as Minister of Foreign Trade does not indicate that either has fallen from favor or that their position has changed in the hierarchy of the Party and Government. The Embassy believes that the changes do not foreshadow any fundamental shift in Soviet foreign policy. The Embassy points out that it has been expected for some time that Stalin would eventu- ally retire as Chairman of the Council of Ministers and that Molotov would return to that position (which he held from 1930 to 1941). The Embassy suspects that these shifts may have been designed to sow confusion in the West at this time and in the immediate future.

Such a seizure would: (a) go far to complicate the work of the UN Commission; (h) virtually preclude application of the proposed formula whereby Israel would provide compensation .for territory it retains outside the UN partition boundaries; and (c) give further support to the Arab contention that Israel 'does not have peaceful intentions but is acting aggressively and in bad faith.)

Austrian treaty talks reach critical stage--US Representative Reber in London reports that Austrian treaty negotiations have reached a critical point as a result of Yugoslavia's unwilling- ness to abandon its demands for frontier rectification and reparations. Reber points out that in backing the Yugoslav claims, the USSR has been using the conference to further Soviet ends in Yugoslavia and to attempt to prevent a further rapprochement between Tito and the West. Reber believes that: (a) as long as the question of Yugoslav claims remains unsolved no real progress can be made toward conclusion of a treaty; (b) the western powers "should not be led into the obvious trap" of agreeing to a discussion of other issues without further efforts to force a showdown on Yugoslavia's claims; and (c) avoiding such a showdown now would leave the West exposed to the danger of a later break over other issues which would be less clear to the public and to Austria In particular. Reber therefore recommends that the US should be prepared to accept in the near future any reason- able grounds for adjournment in the hope that after adjourn- ing: (a) the Yugoslav-Cominform rift might be further clarified; and (b) direct Austrian-Yugoslav negotiations, uninfluenced by the USSR, might result in Yugoslav concessions.

In reply to the Department of State's query con- cerning the possible effect of a declaration accompanying the conclusion of the Atlantic Pact, the Embassy asserts that a carefully worded statement expressing the interest of the US in the security of Greece, Turkey, and Iran would usefully supplement the Atlantic Pact and remind the Kremlin that the US is not dropping its guard anywhere. The Embassy believes it to be "almost essential" that the British join in issuing such a statement. (CIA Comment: CIA believes that any Soviet action against Iran at this time will largely consist of fomenting disturbances, particularly in Azerbaijan.) 2. Bunche reports Israeli intransigence threatens ccording to the US delegation at the UN, Mediator Bunche has reported that an armistice between Lebanon and Israel Is being blocked solely by Israeli intransigence on the subject of the removal of its forces from Lebanon. The Israelis reportedly demand Lebanese permission to retain forces in Lebanon until Syria concludes an armistice. Bunche has declared that he feels so strongly on this matter that unless Israel changes its position within the next few days, he will inform the Security Council that Israel is deliberately blocking a Lebanese agreement and will seriously consider withdrawing altogether from the armistice talks.

According to Reber, Zarubin apparently sought to imply that an agree- ment on autonomy for the Slovenes in Austria would reduce the difficulty of the Yugoslay. frontier issue. Reber indicates that although Zarubin urged that the talks be turned to other disagreed issues, he has agreed with the British and French representatives to continue the present pressure in order to gain some hint concerning eventual solutions on frontiers and reparations. 4_reek move to guarantee ted--US Ambassador Cannon in Belgrade connection with recent Macedonian developments, the Greeks should gain the diplo- matic initiative by proposing that a UN or four power guarantee should be made of present Balkan borders. Cannon suggests that Greece could then forego its claims to southern Albania provided that Yugoslavia, Albania, and Bulgaria would agree to the finality of their own' borders. Cannon points out that such a move would at least place the Cominform on the defen- sive by forcing a Soviet decision concerning its stand on the present borders of Yugoslavia as well as those of Greece. Cannon expresses the view that a US-UK demarche to Bulgaria on the Macedonain question would not be effective at this time.

These reports, which cite details of time and place but cannot be evaluated at this time, indicate that Communist agitators are actively urging the Kurds to resort to violence and that the uprisings will be supported by the sabotage of military installations in Turkey, as well as the assassination of leading Arab govern- ment figures and possibly western representatives. Although the accuracy of these reports cannot be established, it is bone that Kurdish uprisings are always a distinct possibility and that the Communists in the area can be expected to exploit this traditional unrest. There is no evidence, however, to suggest that either the Kurds or the Arab and Turkish Com- munists are receiving substantial material assistance from the USSR or that the USSR Is planning any overt action on their behalf in the near future. If the predicted uprisings occur, they will be generally unsuccessful in all three countries. The effects on each coun- try, however, will vary. In Turkey, there is not the remotest possibility of a serious threat to the government. Communist activity in Turkey is almost non-existent, the Kurds there are less discontented, and the security services are more than adequate. In Iraq, disorders might spread rapidly and some changes in the government might result. The situation might be further complicated by the attempted return of the Barzani Kurds who fled to the USSR in 1947. Communist strength in Iraq has been seriously weakened by recent government action, however, and Iraqi troops now being returned from Palestine could prevent a successful revolution.

Sevin asked that Secretary Acheson be informed of his view that another Israeli fait accompli might damage UN prestige irreparably and confirm the Arab belief that they can expect no help from the west. On the subject of western aid, Sevin told Douglas that it is becoming more and more "ridiculous" for the UK to refuse arms and ammunition for the Arab Legion when arms continue to flaw into Israel on a large scale. He indicated that although the British have given the Legion no war materials as yet, it will be "extremely diffi- cult" for him to continue making flat refusals to King Abdullah's requests. Douglas reports that Bevin informed him tangentially that the Conservative Party plans next week to attack the Gov- ernment for "jeopardizing the vital UK-Transjordan friendship." The Department of State has informed Ambassador Douglas that the British Embassy in Washington has declared "It will no longer be possible to refuse to send arms to the Arab Legion." The Department indicates that great concern was expressed at "the working level" over this possible move and that it was pointed out what an adverse effect this would have on armistice negotiations, emphasizing the likelihood of pressure for the removal of the arms embargo against Israel and the possibility that the Israelis might seize upon this pre- text to reopen hostilities. fa C.I.A. 1115 CSIECT/012 5 pleassinCtoli011 2615 DOCUMMIT. _Mt Document No. 61r NO CHANGE in Class.

MacVeagh has been told that the Foreign Office intends to put the Atlantic Pact question before the Cabinet as soon as an answer has been received to this query. MacVeagh believes Portugal will sign the Pact if granted an option to withdraw after 10 years. The Department of State has replied to Ambassador MacVeagh that although an answer cannot be given to the Portu- guese query without consultation among the participating gov- ernments, the reply will probably be negative. 2.

(CIA Comment: The French Government is extremely anxious to obtain public approval and material support from the US for the new Indochinese agreement before Bao Dai arrives in Indochina on April 25. The promised ratification of the agreement by the French Assembly is dependent upon legal unification in Indochina which will probably take much longer than the few weeks which the French now anticipate.) s- rs 5 -r5 Document No. 0 6 G __ THE C.

Accord- ing to Reber, British and French representatives believe that the USSR might yield on frontiers and reparations in return for economic concessions.. Reber predicts that the British will be less insistent upon complete relinquishment by the USSR of its present control of industry in the Austrian east- ern zone if there seems to be a possibility of agreement on certain economic clauses. Reber believes it important that present Soviet control of Austrian industry not be continued, but he observes that because the Austrians themselves are inclined to dismiss the need for safeguards against Soviet en- croachment in the control of industry, US insistence on such safeguards might be misinterpreted and lend itself to Soviet propaganda.

The Foreign Minister emphasized that the duration of the Pact was the only point to which Portugal objected. He added, however, that several days must elapse before Portugal can reply to the Pact invitation because Spain has invoked the Luso- Spanish treaty which requires the two nations to consult on security matters. The Foreign Minister indicated that there � Is no disharmony between the Luso-Spanish treaty and the Atlantic Pact and added that "Portugal will not sacrifice her Interests merely to please Spain." (CIA Comment: CIA believes that Spain may have sought to delay Portuguese entry into the Atlantic Pact in the hope of gaining a bargaining position favorable to Spanish Inclusion in the Pact. CIA believes Portugal will sign despite Spanish opposition.) 2.

Grady cites the French Embassy in Athens as his source. (CIA Comment: CIA gives little credence to this re- port. The USSR has consistently denied that it is providing aid to the Greek guerrillas, and it is highly improbable that a Soviet diplomat would admit in this fashion that the USSR had intervened in the Greek civil war. If such an offer has actually been made, however, it would probably be a part of the war-of-nerves against Tito rather than a serious attempt to win the support of the violently anti-Soviet Greek Govern- ment in an intrigue against Yugoslav*. ) .00cument No. 014� THE C.I.A.

Although detailed information is lacking, Zaim and his ultra- nationalist followers will probably be able to consolidate their control over the Government and, by ruling with a strong hand, rirety be able to solve many of Syria s internal difficulties. Despite Zaim's nationalistic program, US-Syrian relations are not expected to deteriorate appreciably (Zaim is personally friendly toward the West). However, the coup will probably have certain adverse effects. It will check the scheduled Syrian- Israeli armistice talks; Zaim will unquestionably cite the deci- sion of the previous government to enter into these negotiations as proof of that government's unfitness to remain in office. There will also be inevitable delays in the ratification of the agreement for the Trans-Arabian petroleum pipeline and the French-Syrian financial agreement. Moreover, the danger exists that the Syrian coup may provoke distazbances in other Arab states, particularly Iraq and Egypt. Neither of these countries is sufficiently stable politically to insure surviving a serious local outbreak.

The Netherlands letter indicated, however, that Dutch acceptance is based on the understanding that such discussions will not prejudice the rights, claims, and posi- tions of the two parties and consequently will not prejudice the responsibility of the Netherlands for "freedom and order In Indonesia." Representative Cochran expressed his dis- appointment over the reference to Dutch responsibilities in this reply and expressed his fear that such a reference might cause the Republicans to impose conditions on their acceptance. (CIA Comment: The proposed Netherlands-Indonesian discussions with UNCFI are to be held for the purpose of assist- ing the parties in removing the obstacles--primarily the question of restoring the Republicans to authority in Jogjakarta --to the holding of a conference at The Hague on the over-all Indonesian problem.

Cochran further suggests that the Dutch hope thereby to permit the siltation in Indonesia to deteriorate to a degree that either the transfer of sovereignty to the Indonesians would appear unwarranted or the transfer would take place under such chaotic conditions that the new government would be unable to restore order and would be discredited. He indicates that the Dutch might then insist that Security Council policy had been in error from the start and request UN aid in putting down "a Communist war."

The Department informed the British of the US view that the Shah would be ill-advised to make such an offer and declared tint retention of Iran's case on the Security Council agenda, In view of the recently increased Soviet pressure on Iran, is more desirable now than ever. The Department added that in seeking the nullification of Article 6 of the 1921 treaty, Iran would be bargaining to obtain a position already possessed under annexes to the 1921 Treaty and under the UN Charter. 01( TiE C.I.A.

GERMANY: Clay asks OMGUS break with Czechoslovaks-- According to US Political Adviser Riddleberger In Frankfurt, General Clay recommends that US military authorities in Germany break off all relations with Czechoslovaks until satisfaction has been received for the recent sentencing of US soldiers in Czechoslovakia. Clay indicates that such measures should include the expulsion of all Czechoslovak officials and the closing of the border to international transit traffic. Ridtheberger expresses his view that Clay's proposal would mean a break of relations between the US Military Gov- ernment in Germany and Czechoslovakia, not one between the US and the Czechoslovak governments. 4., GREECE: US aid program tit, succeeding--US Ambas- sador Grady, in recommending 1.- continuance of US military aid to Greece, expresses the belief that the outlook for a successful conclusion of the campaign against the guerrillas Is more favorable now than at any time since the inception of the US aid program. Grady feels that a solid basis for the reduction of the civil war to minor proportions has now been established through: (a) the vigorous leadership exercised by General Papagos since the "black" days of January; (b) the effectiveness of the new coalition government in furthering military and economic progress; and (c) the steady increase in popular morale which has taken place within the last three months. Grady stresses, however that the present outlook Is based on the assumption of continuing US aid. Grady com- ments that US failure to appropriate the funds required for continuation of the aid program would not only have a serious material effect but also, by damaging Greek morale, might well nullify the successes which have been achieved with such difficulty to date. - 2 - Approved for Release: 2018/11/19 006749334 d/A- 5
