THE MAN WHO LEADS AMERICA'S 
GREATEST DEBATE 
Mr. HARTKE. Mr. President, the To-
ronto Daily Star, one of Canada's great-
est papers, recently presented to its 
readers a discerning portrait of the 
chairman of the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, under the heading "The 
Man Who Leads America's Greatest De-
bate." Says the article, by Staff Writer 
Robert Nielsen under a Washington date-
line: 
Questioning national dogma and offending 
conventional wisdom is a risky habit, es-
pecially at times of stress. * * * His prestige 
as one of that rare species, the philosopher-
statesman, is grounded in a 23-year record 
of reasoned and often prophetic discourses 
as Representative and Senator. 
As the article points out, Senator FUL-
BRIGHT has been a prophet or a promoter 
of all the major constructive and mod-
erating influences in world affairs, in-
cluding foreign aid, coexistence, and re-
straining of nuclear arms rivalry. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that this article, which is such a 
deserved tribute to our distinguished 
colleague, may be printed in the CON-
GRESSIONAL RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the REC-
ORD, as follows: 
THE MAN WHO LEADS AMERICA'S GREATEST 
DEDATE7--FULBRIGHT GOES ON THINKING, 
AND SAYING THE UNTHINKABLE 
(By Robert Nielsen) 
Wsslinvorow.?The Vietnam ulcer has be-
gun to perforate and inflame the American 
body politic. 
It is a fime when conventional politicians 
talk of "honor" or "victory" or at least "firm-
ness." But Senator JAMES WILLIAM FUL-
BRIGHT goes on doing what comes naturally 
to him?thinking unthinkable thoughts and 
uttering them when he believes they should 
be aired. 
He is doing it this week as his Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee opens what 
amounts to a full-dress public inquiry into 
U.S. policy in Vietnam. 
A few days ago FULBRIGHT mused aloud, 
in his soft Ozark drawl, on, whether the 
United States had been wrong to commit it-
self in South Vietnam, and on whether a 
great nation -could admit such a mistake 
and draw back. 
Then he bored in on Secretary of State 
Dean Rusk with embarrassing questions 
about the origins of the war. 
Questioning national dogma and offending 
conventional wisdom Is a risky habit, es-
pecially at times of stress, and Fur.sarcm's 
latest heresies have clearly earned him the 
displeasure of President Johnson, who shows 
an increasing preference for yes men. 
Johnson snubbed FULBRIGHT at a meeting 
with 20 congressional leaders before announc-
ing the resumption of U.S. bombing of North 
Vietnam. 
OVEREDUCATED 
The Senator had just begun an exposition 
of American policy in Asia since World War 
II when the President pointedly turned to 
Rusk and started a conversation. 
FULBRIGHT has known worse rebuffs than 
that. 
President Truman once called him "an 
overeducated Oxford s.o.b." (FULBRIGHT was 
a Rhodes scholar) for suggesting that the 
President should resign when the opposition 
party captures Congress in the midterm 
elections---as the Republicans did in 1946. 
The late Senator Joe McCarthy tried to 
nickname him "Senator Halfbright." It 
never took, except among some rightwing 
patriots who are regurgitating their old scur-
rilities into FuLnarcarr's mailbag these days. 
But those who have disagreed with Fur,-
BRIGHT have usually found, in the end, that 
it is unsafe to ignore his deeply considered 
opinions. 
As chairman of the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee, which carries the main burden of the 
Senate's constitutional duty to give advice 
and consent to administration foreign policy, 
his words automatically carry weight. 
His prestige as one of that rare species, the 
philosopher-statesman, is grounded in a 23-
year record of reasoned and often prophetic 
discourses as Representative and Senator. 
Although he is exceptionally mild man-
nered, and almost unfailingly temperate in 
language, FULBRIGHT has ample inner tough-
ness for the role of Great Dissenter in foreign 
policy matters. 
LAPSE 
When the Bay of Pigs invasion by Cuban 
exiles was being considered in 1961, FCTL-
BRIGHT did not fear to pit his detached schol-
arly judgment against the optimism of the 
Central Intelligence Agency, the Pentagon, 
and the State Department. 
He wrote President Kennedy a long memo 
condemning the project on bah political and 
moral grounds. After the fiasco, the Presi-
dent said to him within the hearing of 
others: "You are the only one here who has a 
right to say T told you so.'" 
McCarthy's fear-and-smear tactics caused 
one of FuLsrucirr's few lapses from moderate 
speech. He observed that democracy has 
"no apparatus to deal with the boor, the liar, 
the lout." 
At a time when President Eisenhower was 
trying to pussyfoot around the rampant Mc-
Carthy, and when Congress was afraid of 
him, Pur..srucarr was the lone Senator to vote 
to cut off funds for McCarthy's investiga-
tions. 
By the end of the same year (1954) his 
minority of one had become a majority of 
the Senate voting censure of McCarthy and 
breaking the latter's political power. 
Arkansas lost an educator, and the United 
States gained a statesman, as a result of 
FULBRIGHT'S having got fired, for parochial 
political reasons, from the presidency of the 
University of Arkansas. 
He made his mark in his first year (1943) 
as a freshman Representative, successfully 
moving a resolution favoring U.S. member-
ship in a world organization with powers 
adequate to keep the peace. This was a 
forerunner to the establishment of the 
United Nations, and a decisive breakaway 
from American isolationism. 
Yet when the U.N. Charter was being eu-
phorically hailed in 1945, FULBRIGHT rose in 
the Senate to voice critical reservations. 
The U.N. was being sold on the ground 
that it would not infringe national sover-
eignty, he noted. But unless it developed 
to the point where it limited the autonomy 
of nations in their dealings with others, it 
would prove ineffective. 
The rule of law, backed by U.N. power to 
settle disputes, could not operate if the 
member nations retained absolute sover-
eignty. 
PROPHET 
Since then FULBRIGHT has been a prophet 
or a promoter of nearly every major con-
structive or moderating tendency in world 
affairs: Foreign economic aid, European 
union, the coexistence of capitalism and com-
munism, "polycentrism" in the Communist 
world; restraint of the nuclear arms race. 
Even without that record, his fame would 
endure from one simple idea he had in 1945: 
Conversion of surplus U.S. military supplies, 
left overseas after the war, into exchange 
scholarships. 
At last count, more than 25,000 Americans 
had gone overseas on Fulbright scholarships, 
and 47,000 men and women had come to 
study in the United States. 
FULBRIGHT, now 60, was more noted as, an 
athlete and good mixer than as a scholar at 
Oxford University. 
FULBRIGHT derives his authority from his 
habit of standing back coolly from the 
chaotic flux of current events, trying to detect 
the significant movements and then fitting 
them into their historical contexts. 
His mind is richly stocked with political 
history, and he resorts frequently to the 
wisdom of the ancient philosophers, and of 
the 18th and 19th century thinkers. 
In a sense he is still an educator. From 
his Senate forum he periodically lectures the 
American people about their qualities, both 
good and bad, especially as they relate to the 
difficulties of conducting an intelligent for-
eign policy. 
"We have clung too long to our youth as 
a nation, during which our foreign policy 
consisted in a series of exhilarating and suc-
cessful adventures. * * * But we live now in 
a far more difficult and more dangerous 
world, a world in which we must come of age. 
Neither God nor nature has preordained the 
triumph of our free society.

Mr. President, I offer my resolution as 
a constructive alternative to the John-
son administration's proposal. That 
proposal, while abolishing the electoral 
college and thereby preventing presiden-
tial electors from flouting the popular 
will as expressed in the November elec-
tions, would freeze into our Constitution 
the winner-take-all system whereby a 
State's entire electoral vote would go to 
the ticket carrying that State. A bad 
consequence of the winner-take-all sys-
Lam is that the parties concentrate their 
campaigns on those States having the 
largest number of electoral votes to the 
exclusion of the other States. A ticket 
that can carry the major industrial 
States can win a majority of the elec-
toral votes. 
My proposal would give the people a 
more meaningful voice in selecting their 
national leaders by requiring presiden-
tial tickets to go after every congres-
aional district or special district in order 
to be sure of winning a majority of the 
electoral votes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
joint resolution will be received and ap-
oropriately referred. 
The joint resolution (S.J. Res. 141) 
proposing an amendment to the Consti-
tution of the United States providing 
for the election of the President and 
Vice President, introduced by Mr. SCOTT, 
was received, read twice by its title, and 
referred to the Committee on the Ju-
diciary.

NOTICE OF WEATHER. MODIFICA-
TION HEARINGS 
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. President, for the 
information of the Senate and other 
interested persons, I want to announce 
that hearings have been scheduled by the 
Committee on Interior and Insular Af-
fairs on S. 2375, the bill to authorize and 
direct the Secretary of the Interior to 
conduct a comprehensive program of 
scientific and engineering research, ex-
periments, tests, and operations for in-
creasing the yield of water from atmos-
pheric sources. The hearings will start 
at 10 a.m., Monday, March 21, 1966, in 
room 3110, New Senate Office Building, 
and continue until all of those wishing 
to be heard have had an opportunity to 
testify. 
S. 2875 was introduced by our dis-
tinguished colleague, Senator ANDERSON, 
for himself and 20 other Senators, on 
February 4, 1966. The purpose of the 
bill is to implement recommendations re-
cently released by the National Science 
Foundation and the National Academy of 
Sciences. 
Because of the widespread interest in 
weather modification and its possible ef-
fect on our water supply and resources, 
it is my intention to invite testimony 
from qualified scientific and engineering 
individuals to give the committee the 
benefit of their knowledge and expel 1-
ence. I trust that a complete record of 
both past activities and the possibilities 
for the future can be completely ee-
plored. It is time to move forward fl 
this field with boldness and perseverance, 
and S. 2875 is a step in this direction. 
We must continue to do all in our power 
to meet this Nation's water needs.

March 1, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SEN 
TRICKS 
"History plays cruel tricks. It allowed us 
to believe that the triumphs of our past were 
the product of our vigor and resourcefulness 
alone. What we failed to perceive in our 
past was the presence of another element; 
The element of an improbable run of luck, 
the luck of a rich and unspoiled continent 
far removed from the centers of power poli-
tic's and world conflicts." 
Although he is a hero to liberal inter-
nationalists and a dirty word to the self-
styled conservatives of the radical right. 
FULBRIGHT himself is palpably a conserva-
tive. He has a conservative's respect for 
tradition and an aristocrat's mistrust of mass 
impulses. 
He has voted the straight Southern line 
against civil rights, without apologies and 
with inner discomforts that can only be 
guessed at, since he is certainly not a bigot. 
He is forever counseling the United States 
to be prudent as well as conciliatory in for-
eign affairs, to beware of thinking it can 
police the world or remake the world in its 
image. 
MODERATION 
If FULBRIGHT is passionate about anything, 
It is moderation. 
But his insistent desire to see things in 
their true proportions can startle his coun-
trymen when it collides with national myths 
and obsessions?as when he rated Fidel 
Castro "a nuisance but not a grave threat" 
to the United States. 
Now he is applying his system of measure-
ment to Vietnam and if he turns out right it 
will not be said, as it often has been, that 
he was "right too soon." 
In fact, he swallowed this week some of the 
humble medicine he suggested for the coun-
try, and admitted he had been wrong to en-
dorse a 1964 congressional resolution au-
thorizing the President to take all necessary 
steps to repel aggression in southeast Asia. 
Johnson now is waving this blank check 
under Congress' nose, and FULBRIGHT 
evidently would like to write some conditions 
into it. 
This will not restore him to the best graces 
of the White House, but then, FULBRIGHT 
has never depended on the favor of Presi-
dents. Or even on the agreement of his 
colleagues in Congress, 
His constituency is scattered across the 
country ?and many parts of the world, in 
centers of learning and especially among 
students and practitioners of International 
relations. 
LOYAL 
His following is select, influential, and 
His own status is unique, and indicated 
by the fact that British Labor dissidents 
wired a protest to him, rather than Johnson, 
over the resumption of bombing. 
Even if the Presidential frowns should be 
followed by thunderbolts, FULBRIGHT might 
take solace at having moved Walter Lipp-
mann to this hyperbole; 
"The role he plays in Washington is an 
indispensable role: There is no one else who 
is so powerful and also so wise." 
NEBRASKA'S STATEHOOD DAY 
AND CENTENNIAL 
Mr. HRUSKA. Mr. President, 99 years 
ago today, on March 1, 1867, the free 
State of Nebraska was recognized as the 
37th State in the Union. Today we cele-
brate our natal day. 
One year from now Nebraska will be 
celebrating its 100th birthday. Ground-
work has been laid for ceremonies and 
festivities marking the anniversary of a 
century of pioneer heritage. 
A fondly remembered part of that 
heritage is the postal history of Nebraska 
as a State and territory. Nebraska's re-
quest for the issuance of a Nebraska 
statehood centennial commemorative 
stamp in 1967 is presently on the agenda 
of the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Commit-
tee to the Past Office Department. The 
Centennial Commission's Commemora-
tive Stamp Committee has plans for re-
staging the first night airmail flight from 
North Platte to Omaha. The Pony Ex-
press run from Fairbury to Scottsbluff 
will be reenacted along the original 
route. 
The centennial program, according to 
the Nebraska Centennial Commission, 
has a three-part objective. The first is 
to honor our heritage. It is only 
through examination of our past and ad-
herence to proven ideals and principles 
that we can be true to the land and con-
tinue to have a heritage worthy of honor. 
It is remembered at this time that these 
sturdy pioneers made sacred the land 
called Nebraska by their great bravery 
and sacrifices. By principles based upon 
a strong democratic ideal and spiritual 
faith a heritage has been forged deserv-
ing our highest respect. We are unalter-
ably committed to its preservation. 
The second aim of our program is a 
celebration or commemoration begin-
ning on our Statehood Day, March 1, 
1967, and running through Thanksgiv-
ing Day, 1967. This period of time will 
be filled with activities of national and 
local importance and interest. It is in-
deed fitting that these 8 months be set 
aside to commemorate the work of many 
years which have given us such a great 
State today. This is the birthday party. 
The third objective is a rededication 
to the future. With renewed spirits and 
confidence, Nebraskans will look to the 
future and join their fellow countrymen 
in preserving the heritage and realizing 
the promise of our great land. 
The people of Nebraska extend the 
hand of friendship. Inscribed on our 
centennial seal is "Welcome to Ne-
braskaland?where the West begins." 
In conclusion, Mr. President, I believe 
that through the individual effort of 
Nebraskans combined with the support 
of all the Nation, the Nebraska Centen-
nial of 1967 will be a tremendous suc-
cess with lasting effects on our fine State 
and our great Nation. 
WAR ON HUNGER 
Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. President, the 
March issue of the Farm Journal strong-
ly endorses President Johnson's new 
food-for-freedom program. 
The Farm Journal called rather ur-
gently last October for efforts to meet 
the population food crisis in the world. 
That editorial appeared in the RECORD of 
January 14. In its new comment on the 
President's world food proposal the mag-
azine suggests that the label "war on 
hunger" would be appropriate. It says: 
We'd prefer "war on hunger" (words which 
the President used). They have the neces-
sary ring of urgency. 
As a past director of food for peace 
and author of a book entitled "War 
4157 
Against Want," I offer no specific label 
for the Nation's food program, but I 
would like to join Farm Journal Editor 
Carroll P. Streeter in his comment that 
there should be a "necessary ring of ur-
gency" about the program. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the Farm Journal editorial be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
GOOD HUNGER PROGRAM 
President Johnson's new food-for-freedom 
program, with its implications for U.S. farm-
ers and for the hungry of the world has 
Farm Journal's full support. It agrees in 
intent with what we have been advocating 
for months, particularly in our war-on-
hunger statement on this page of last 
October. 
The food-for-peace label has apparently 
been tossed aside. The new one isn't much 
better. We'd prefer "war on hunger" (words 
which the President used). They have the 
necessary ring of urgency. 
In essence the policy calls for expanding 
our food shipments from here to a practi-
cable degree; trying to put more of them on 
a long time loan basis; going into the market 
to buy what the hungry need, not just dump-
ing surpluses we want to get rid of; sending 
food only to those who will show real effort 
to help themselves; clamping down on feed-
ing unfriendly nations (does Russian belong 
here); and guardedly bringing back into 
production as fast as needed, but no faster, 
some of our 60 million acres of idle land. 
Nothing was said about charging more of 
this cost to something other than agricul-
ture?a step we still urge. 
If we really hew to these lines and not 
just talk about them, and if we move in the 
direction of more "freedom" for American 
farmers as well as freedom from hunger (a 
big "if" indeed), our "hunger" campaign 
will be on the right track at last. Let's see 
now if we do as we say. 
FISH PROTEIN CONCENTRATE FOR 
USE AS A DIET SUPPLEMENT 
Mr. KENNEDY of Massachusetts. Mr. 
President, Secretary of the Interior 
Udall announced recently a dramatic 
breakthrough in the worldwide struggle 
against hunger when he revealed the de-
velopment of a new process for produc-
ing a wholesome fish protein concentrate 
which can be used as a diet supplement 
throughout the world. 
For many years the people of the 
United States have been actively engaged 
in an effort to provide food for the 
world's hungry people. The accelerat-
ing pace of modern life makes the prob-
lems of each country the concern of all 
countries, and hunger is the greatest 
common enemy in the world today. The 
statistics of world hunger do not need 
repeating. The President's recent mes-
sage to the Congress on food for freedom 
clearly documented the problem. 
It is enough for us to realize that more 
than half of the world's inhabitants are 
either chronically hungry or consistently 
undernourished. 
The task of providing food for the 
world's starving millions has challenged 
American ingenuity, and America has re-
sponded in many ways. One response?
the one cited by Secretary Udall?raises 
the intriguing probability that the har-

1158 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE March 1, 1981; 
vest of the future can come from the 
sea. 
The bounty contained in the world's 
oceans has never been underestimated. 
Scientists and nutritional experts have 
long known that fish and fish products 
could go far toward erasing hunger in 
many countries of the world. The ques-
tion has always been, how could this in-
valuable resource he exploited, how could 
we actually get these fish products into 
the mouths of the hungry? 
An enormous amount of research has 
gone toward answering this question, and 
out of it has come at least one very hope-
ful product. That product is called fish 
protein concentrate, or fish flour. It 
seems to offer an exciting victory in the 
war against hunger. 
Fishprotein concentrate is an utterly 
new concept in the food industry. For 
years fishermen and fish processors have 
used many devices to preserve fish 
against rapid deterioration. They have 
salted fish, smoked it, dried it, canned it, 
frozen it. And they have been success-
ful in part with each of these methods. 
But in every case they have been trying 
to preserve fish in a form very closely 
resembling its original state, and not try-
ing to extract from fish the greatest pos-
sible amount of nutritional value. 
The process which results in fish pro-
tein concentrate takes a different ap-
proach. It is aimed not at preserving 
fish in its original state, but rather at 
taking advantage of the tremendous 
amount of protein which is concentrated 
in even the least valuable type of fish. 
'?rotein deficiency is the most promi-
nent element of malnutrition in the 
world today_ Meat is far too expensive 
in most countries to provide a staple diet 
item for the average person. Wheat 
yields ample protein, but wheat is virtu-
ally unknown in many lands. Vegetables 
of one kind or another are common 
everywhere, but they often supply only 
small amounts of a low quality protein. 
Fish protein concentrate is designed to 
meet this worldwide need for protein 
with a food supplement which contains 
a high. amount of high quality animal 
protein in a form which is safe, inexpen-
sive, easy to transport, and palatable. 
The idea of developing a fish flour has 
been current among fishery technologists 
for more than a decade. But it has al-
ways faced a tangle of questions: could 
a fish protein concentrate be developed 
economically? Could it be made accept-
able in countries where fish is not a com-
mon or recognizable part of the diet? 
In 1963 the Bureau of Commercial 
Fisheries of the Department of the In-
terior began intensive research into these 
questions, and the National Academy of 
Sciences soon joined in the project.. 
Work began with tests on various meth-
ods of removing the water and oil from 
the whole fish so that it yielded a dry, 
white powder containing most of the pro-
tein and minerals of the original raw 
fish. 
On the basis of preliminary research 
in the laboratory, the Bureau was able to 
design a model scale FPC production 
Plant which could manufacture 100 
pounds of FPC per day. While research 
continued at the laboratory, construction 
of the scale plant was begun, and the 
plant was completed in the spring of 
1965. This plant greatly accelerated the 
"FTC study. 
It was apparent early in the study that 
a protein product which would be made 
available to the poor of the world have 
to be manufactured at a very low cost. 
That meant using the whole fish as raw 
material?not a fillet, or a steak, but the 
whole flab,. And this introduced the 
problem of wholesomeness. 
With this and other considerations in 
mind, the :Bureau of Commercial Fish-
eries began through exhaustive tests to 
narrow down the focus of its Quest. By 
last summer it had developed a process 
whereby Atlantic red hake, a cheap and 
plentiful fish, could be turned into a 
highly acceptable protein concentrate 
through treatment with isopropyl alco-
hol. The protein content of this pow-
dery substance is extremely high?about 
80 percent., The estimated price is very 
low?somewhere between 14 and 29 cents 
a pound, depending on the capacity of 
the plant which produces it. 
In October of last. year an Advisory 
Committee of the National Academy of 
Sciences pronounced the concentrate 
"wholesome,, highly nutritious, stable, 
safe, and capable of economic produc-
Uon and marketing." The Committee's 
report further said: 
The product blends well with (F her forms 
of food. The Committee has tested it as an 
ingredient in beverages, noodles, gravy, bread, 
and cookies. In percentages high enough to 
be of nutritional significance, the product is 
scarcely detectable, and in most forms, not 
at all. 
A similar test, a flavor profile, was 
conducted by Arthur D. Little, Inc. It 
revealed that fish protein concentrate is 
not fishy in taste. FPC has been in-
corporated in noodles at levels up to 10 
percent, in milkshakes at levels of 20 
percent, and in dry beef gravy mixes at 
up to 20 percent. In no case i.eas a fish 
flavor detected by a trained panel. FPC 
was ever, used in the making of tortillas, 
with no fish taste and no change in 
flavor. 
On October 14, 1965, the National 
Academy's Committee recommended that 
the U.S. Government arrange for the 
production of 3,000 tons of fish protein 
concentrate within 2 years. The Com-
mittee recommended that an experi-
mental pilot plant; be constructed and 
operated which could produce :0 tons of 
concentrate per day based on the Bu-
reau of Commercial Fisheries' process. 
These developments, culminating in Sec-
retary Udah's recent announcement, 
make it clear that fish protein con-
centrate has been tested and proved to 
be a valuable, comm.ercially marketable 
product. The question remains, how 
can it best be used? 
Surely our first consideration should 
be America's foreign aid program. Presi-
dent Johnson has proposed a food-for-
freedom plan designed to put America's 
skill and abundance at the service of the 
worldwide fight against hunger. Fish 
protein concentrate should become a key 
commodity in American food shipments 
to poor nations. The Bureau (,)f Com-
mercial Fisheries, working closely with 
the Department of State and the Agency 
for International Development, should 
distribute enormous amounts of fish pre-
tien concentrate which would have a 
strong effect on the world's nutrition. 
It should also make available to the 
countries of the developing world the 
fruits of this technical breakthrough sa 
that each country could commence its 
own production. 
The potential of fish protein concen-
trate as a worldwide nutritional supple-
ment is clear. But let me point out that 
commercial production and distribution 
of fish protein concentrate could also 
have widespread benefits in the United 
States. In our own country nearly 13 
percent of all households do not meet 
two-thirds of the food nutrient allow-
ances recommended for their diets. 
Another important beneficiary would 
be the U.S. fishing industry. Full-scale 
production of fish protein concentrate 
would enable fishermen to use fish which 
they now catch and discard because the 
fish are of insufficient commercial value. 
Fish protein concentrate would increase 
the present use of fish by 7 billion pounds 
per year in the United States alone. 
Commercial use of fish protein concen-
trate would also allow fishermen to work 
steadily the year round, catching mar-
ketable species of fish when they are 
available and turning to species suitable 
for fish protein concentrate during the 
remainder of the year. This new process 
could stabilize and diversify the fish mar-
ket, and increase employment in fish 
processing plants. 
But beyond the immediate advantages 
to the fishing industry, production of 
fish protein concentrate would also bene-
fit other parts of our economy. A major 
FPC program would of course mean in-
creased demands for ships and thus more 
work for shipbuilders. It would also 
open a new field of research into fish 
processing and the development of new 
processing techniques. And it could 
very well mean a whole new line of foods 
for domestic use?many major food com-
panies in the United States have ex-
pressed interest in the use of FPC in 
everyday food such as cereal, bread, 
pastry, and even candy. 
The potential contribution that fish 
protein concentrate can make both at 
home and abroad is clear, but it is essen-
tial that we plan now to take advantage 
of its benefits. I, therefore, propose a 
six-point action program to insure that 
fish protein concentrate is put to work 
quickly and effectively. 
First. Our first objective muet be to 
obtain approval by the Food and Drug 
Administration for the commercial mar-
keting of FPC. The Food and Drug Ad-
ministration has so far refused approval 
for domestic marketing of FPC because 
the product uses the whole fish, including 
the portions which are normally die-
carded. But exhaustive tests by the 
Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences, and an inde-
pendent testing firm all show that the 
new FPC recently developed is safe and 
wholesome. 
In order to obtain FDA approval, a 
group of New England Senators has 
twice petitioned the FDA, and a formal

PORTS FROM CONGRESS ON 
SOUTH VIETNAM 
Mr. ELLENDER. Mr. President, I ask 
unanimous consent to have printed in 
the RECORD excerpts from reports which 
I have made to the people of Louisiana 
during the year 1965 and part of this 
year, 1966, on the issue of Vietnam. I 
also ask unanimous consent that preced-
ing each excerpt, the date of my report 
be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the excerpts 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[Prom the report of Feb. 27, 19651 
SOUTH VIETNAM 
Hearings began last week on the impor-
tant, $49 billion defense appropriations bill. 
The Defense Subcommittee of the Senate 
Appropriations Committee went into execu-
tive session to receive testimony and justifi-
cation from Defense Secretary Robert Mc-
Namara on this mammoth expenditure. As 
a member of the subcommittee, I questioned 
Mr. McNamara very closely as to our mili-
tary posture and our military policies 
throughout the world. Like many other 
Senators and Congressmen, I am becoming 
extremely concerned about the effectiveness 
of these policies, particularly in Vietnam. 
It appears to me that we have gone in so 
deeply in South Vietnam, that we now find 
ourselves in over our heads. I am not at 
all sure that we can gain any victory in that 
God-forsaken corner of the world, and I fear 
we are on the verge of finding another South 
Korea on our hands which may be more 
costly. God forbid that we become engaged 
in a big war on the continent of Asia. 
I become particularly concerned when I 
recall the history of the French effort to hold 
Indochina. That war lasted from 1916 to 
1954, and in its latter stages we supplied the 
French with approximately $1.5 billion worth 
of American aid. The French at one time 
had as many as 350,000 men in action on the 
Indochina peninsula, of which about 175,000 
were French nationals. The administration 
of the Government and the entire population 
were under their control; yet in 8 years, the 
French were decisively defeated and driven 
out of an area they had held for 100 years. 
This history does not bode well for the fu-
ture of the American effort. 
[Prom the report of Apr. 3, 19651 
The news from the international scene has 
been dominated in the last weeks by the 
worsening situation in Vietnam. Personally, 
I have long given up hope that any good can 
come from our Nation's involvement in that 
God-forsaken corner of the world. Based on 
my personal knowledge and ray inspections 
of the Vietnam situation, I repeatedly warned 
and advised against the coming entangle-
ment, beginning with the Eisenhower ad-
ministration. My warnings were not heeded, 
however, and we now find ourselves hanging 
on the tail of an increasingly ferocious bear. 
As it is, I am becoming more and more 
concerned about the course of events. It 
seems to me as if we have very little to win, 
if, indeed, we can win, and a great deal to 
lose. At this point, we can do little more 
than hope that Red Chinese forces are not 
brought into the fray, for we shall then have 
another full-scale Korea on our hands?a 
condition that I have tried to head off in 
every way that I could. 
Once again we are carrying the entire 
burden, while our erstwhile allies sit back 
and give advice. 
It does seem to me, however, that our au-
thorities could take the necessary steps to 
provide effective security for our facilities and 
installations on Vietnamese territory. I have 
in mind particularly the recent bombing of 
our American Embassy in Saigon, which did 
great damage and took a number of lives. It 
is unthinkable that with the number of 
forces we currently have in -that area that 
adequate security from such sneak attacks 
cannot be provided. I express the hope that 
strong steps will be taken to assure that 
such attacks do not occur in the future. 
[From the report of May 8, 1965] 
VIETNAM 
I was invited to the White House last week 
to take part in a briefing by the President 
on the state of our affairs in Vietnam and the 
Dominican Republic. The President an-
nounced to us at that meeting that he would 
ask Congress to appropriate an additional 
$700 million to carry out our expanded ef-
forts in Vietnam and to deal with the new 
difficulties,we have run into with the Do-
minican Republic. 
There is no doubt that ample funds are 
already available to the President within the 
Department of Defense to carry out these 
purposes. It is apparent to me that the 
administration is actually seeking a con-
gressional vote of confidence in respect to 
the course our foreign policy is taking. The 
President is seeking quick congressional ap-
proval as indicative of a united front on the 
part of the American people. 
As to Vietnam, I see no other course that 
might now be followed with any hope of suc-
cess. Personally, I went on record as far back 
as 1954 against the involvement of U.S. forces 
in Vietnam, and advised President Eisen-
hower against it. Instead, he and Secretary 
of State John Foster Dulles suggested that 
U.S. military advisers be assigned to Vietnam, 
and the pot soon began to boil and bubble. 
President Kennedy augmented our forces 
by a substantial amount, and now, of course, 
we are engaged in what comes very close to 
being a full-scale war. I regret that this has 
come about, but now there seems to be no 
alternative but to push ahead and attempt 
to settle it in the shortest time possible, and 
with the smallest loss of life. From all re-
ports the bombing we have engaged in north 
of the 17th parallel is having considerable 
effect, and I express the hope that some solu-
tion can be found without the necessity of 
sending larger numbers of American boys 
into action against the enemy. What I fear 
is the possibility of our becoming involved in 
another South Korea, or even greater in-
tensity, 
[From the report of May 15, 1965] 
THE JOHNSON DoorRiNE 
On another front, it seems to me that the 
President's leadership is more open to ques-
tion. I refer to his statement when he signed 
the special congressional resolution making 
more funds available for the struggle in 
Vietnam. At that time, he indicated that 
congressional passage of the resolution indi-
cated that the Nation and the Congress stood 
ready to do "whatever must be done" to pro-
tect South Vietnam from aggression. In 
other words, he apparently considers the con-
gressional action more or less a blanket en-
dorsement of whatever action he may take 
in the future in regard to southeast Asia. 
Yet, prior to this statement, many Members 
of both the House and Senate rose to express 
the feeling that their votes for the resolu-
tion should not be looked upon as an en-
dorsement of all future action. Although 
these sentiments were issued a step ahead 
of the President, he has chosen to ignore 
them. Many Senators and Members of the 
House are very much opposed to any action 
which Would draw the United States into a 
land war in Asia, and I share this attitude. 
As I have said before, however, if the Chinese 
Communists were to send masses of troops 
to Vietnam, I would favor using all the 
means at our command to deter the Chinese 
aggression and protect the lives of our 
American boys. 
In connection with the Vietnam and 
Dominican Republic situations, recent 
Presidential statements have given rise to 
what is coming to be known as the Johnson 
doctrine. In short, this doctrine seems to 
mean that the United States will act as the 
policemen of peace, as New York Times Col-
umnist Arthur Krock puts it, to protect 
nations and peoples all over the world. This 
goes far beyond the so-called Truman doc-
trine, which was the savior of Greece and 
Turkey, but which pledged only economic 
and finaneial aid in the worldwide flight 
against communism. 
I expect that Congress is going to have a 
great deal to say in the future about the 
new Johnson doctrine, particularly if trouble 
continues to flare up in the fax-off corners 
of the world and American troops ars dis-
patched to put out the fires. 
I, for one, am not sure that the Nation 
is prepared to make the sacrifices that such a 
course of action will necessarily call for. 
Aside from that, it seems that we will be 
compelled to go it alone. 
[From the report of May 29, 1965] 
VIETNAM AND THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC 
The news from Vietnam continues to be 
disturbing, although apparently conditions 
in the Dominican Republic are settling down 
somewhat. In Vietnam, it appears more and 
more as if we are heading toward a Korean-
type situation of even greater dimensions. 
This, of course, is the one thing that X have 
bent every effort to avoid, beginning with 
1956, 'when I first visited that beleaguered 
land after the French had withdrawn their 
farces. 
We now have more than 50,000 American 
fighting troops stationed in South Vietnam, 
and we have been told that this number may 
be increased to 75,000 in the near future. 
This is the equivalent of almost three full 
divisions. In addition, our men are now 
being sent into direct offensive action, on 
their own, against the Vietcong, according 
to press reports. Reports are also being 
received concerning the buildup of Chi-
nese men and material across the North Viet-
nam border. As fax as I can see, none of 
this news bodes well for our Nation's hope for 
peace. 
Fortunately, we have been able to with-
draw a few of our boys from the Dominican 
Republic, and there appears hope that the 
multilateral peace force of the OAS will be 
able to maintain order and effect a settle-
ment. No political agreement has been an-
nounced as yet, however, and I fear that if, 
as, and when agreement is reached, it is 
likely to prove of short duration. The Gov-
ernment of the Republic has already changed 
hands four times?more or less violently?
in the 4 years since the assassination of 
Rafael Trujillo. In this connection, I was 
not surprised to hear President Johnson 
promise that even more economic aid will 
be sent to the Dominican Republic when the 
fighting is settled and agreement is reached. 
I can only remark that the same promise 
was made after Trujillo was deposed, and it 
cost our Government $103.9 million during 
the years 1962 through 1964. Before that 
time, our Nation extended $8.8 million in 
aid to the Republic, some of which was mili-
tary hardware for internal security.

it CRUSTY EDITos TAKF7S IT EASIER 
Bill Hart's friend and fellow columnist, 
)reAY Pearson, called him a "crusty editor." 
Stronger terms have been used by Editor 
VIlatter H. Hart's enemies. Others, including 
mrm.er neighbors and friends in his native 
Preston, consider him, a loyal friend and a 
major benefactor to this part of West Vir-
ginia. 
There.'s not much neutrality when people 
ialk about Bill Hart of 7,-1 fame. A crusty 
editor is hound to have enemies as well as 
Iriends with a fair amount of switching back 
and forth depending on different situations. 
Sic is of the old school of personal editors. 
He started as an e,ager boy reporter here 47 
years ago: He advanced to editor in days 
when it was not uncommon for editors to use 
their editor's chair from which to mix per-
Jona], arid inailic affairs, especially in 
matters. 
Aar. Hart is a Democrat, He used his p0-
-Weal influence on many occasions to obtain 
major benefits for his hometown and sur-
rounding area. He was unrelaxing in seek-
ing WPA projects ;end had a big hand in 
obtaining some of the most worthwhile ones 
iii the country.. Through the years he has 
ought for aviation in general and Morgan-
.,own.'s beautiful airport in the mountains 
Li particular. Several physical assets in this 
area are permanent monuments to his crusti-
ess and persistence. 
As a crusty editor, he has often gone it 
alone in his crusades. Sometimes he's gone 
overboard. He says he should have been a 
Barnum. He has enlivened life hereabouts 
by his showmanship, especially his ability to 
hang Presidents, Presidents' wives, Cabinet 
niembers, and other celebrities to Morgan-
town for such things as the Hart-promoted 
"Fabulous Showcase" events at the airport. 
A self-styled "least of these, my brethren" 
ccuntry boy, Bill Hart was hobnobbed with 
e great and near great in unabashed lash-
.011. Re haa ordered candidates, including 
t)Te great President-to-he, to do his bidding 
as a campaign strategist. He's as much at 
le me in Washington as in Tunnelton or 
Morgantown. 
ic loves to travel and has seen much of 
world. When it comes to airplanes, he's 
stin an eager?thrilled r,nct thrilling?young 
reporter. 
rAitor Hart has a family of which he is 
rely proud and one of which our whole corn-
minity is proud. 
s ',day is the last day Mr. Hart's mune 
appears in. the editorial page masthead as 
editor. He is retiring from that post to take 
tintiris a bit easier. All, that is, except yield-
lip to that eagerness to get around, to see 
Ciii -1gS, and report. His inimitable column,. 
"it May Interest You,- will continue in this

Saigon, Anchorage, Saudi Arabia and Cuba, 
but always reflecting his pride in West Vir-

Morgantown.

ALL OITT roe AVIATION" 
Relieved of the daily responsibilities of get-
ting out a newepaper, Walter Lawrence hart, 
of the Morgantown Dominion-News is going 
to devote almost his full time in the future 
to his "second love," aviation He plans to 
travel extensively, and there is a possibility 
he will be given a Government office rrom 
which to opera Le. 
Bill's interest in aviation gocs back ti the 
days of the Works Progre.ss Administrwton., 
when he was a prime mover in the effort; to 
obtain an airport for Morganto'wn. The late 
U.S. Senator Matthew Mansfield Neely, to 
whom Hart was close, had proposed an air-
port in the vicinity of Fairmont to serve this 
community as well as Morgantown and 
Cl arksburg. 
When local leaders gave the idea a ,old 
shoulder, Hart and others acted quickly to 
obtain WPA. assistance for a Morgantown 
airport. Those associated with the district 
office of the Federal agency here in those days 
recall his incessant demands for more men, 
more equipment, and more money?all of 
which he eventually got. 
This connection with the world of flyng 
expanded over the ye,ars. Han is now ac-
tively associated with Drew Pearson snd 
:rack Alexander in a charter-freight airline 
whose eastern base he may get changed to 
Morgantown if the runways there will stand 
the load. He has close ties with the Federal 
aviation regulatory bodies and for years has 
practically commuted between Morgantown 
and Washington in pursuance of his fl-
terests. 
A confidant of the mighty, the Morgan-
town editor has taken an active role in 
politics. He was .-me of the first to know if 
Senator Neely's decision to run far Governor 
back in 1940. Unfortunately Bill's last polit-
ical "scoop"---a prediction that Arch Moore 
would run for the U.S. Senate this year?did 
not pan out, but his average is still high. 
As editor, he has been the most vigorous 
booster of what he proudly calls the Mor-
gantown Trading Territory or, more recently, 
Mason-Dixonland. He has been an effee-
tive exponent of many community project;. 
BillHart's influence as an editor in Mor-
gantown has been substantial. He now turns 
to larger fields, and the cause of aviation 
will gain an ardent full-time supporter. 
FARM LABOR'S LOT INCHES UP 
Mr. WILLIAMS of New Jersey. Mi 
President, over the years, the New York 
Times editorial board has taken great 
interest in farm labor problems. Its edi-
torials in this field have been factual and 
thought provoking. 
The Times' most recent obseiwation---
its February 15 editorial?urges that, 
Federal minimum wage legislation and 
other protective laws which have bene-
fited American labor for the last 30 years 
be extended to American farmworkers. 
As chairman of the Senate Migratory 
Labor Subcommittee, I endorse the 
Times' editorial position and urge prompt 
passage of S. 1861 through S. 1868, 
These bills were introduced during the 
last session of Congress and would estab-
lish a minimum wage for workers em-
1169 
ployed on our Nation's larger farms, pro-
hibit harmful child labor outside of 
school hours for some children under 
the age of 14, provide National Labor 
Relations Act coverage for farmworkers 
employed on our Nation's larger farms, 
establish a voluntary recruitment pro-
gram for farmworkers administered by 
the Secretary of Labor to aid the farmer 
in finding qualified employees and the 
farmworker in finding employment, and 
establish a National Advisory Council on 
Migratory Labor to coordinate existing 
programs affecting migratory farmwork-
ers and to recommend to the President 
and Congress such new programs as may 
be needed. 
I wholeheartedly concur with the 
Times' conclusion that legislation in tins 
field is "as fundamental as any in the 
war against poverty." 
I believe that the Senate should have 
the benefit of this informative editorial 
and, therefore, ask unanimous consent 
that it be printed in the REcoaa. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECO1 0. 
as follows: 
[From the New York Times, Feb. 15, 1966; 
:FARM LABOR'S LOT INCITES UP 
In the year since Congress banned the 
mass import of low-wage farm labor from 
Mexico, the man-months of work done by 
foreign workers on American farms has de-
clined by 83 percent_ Seasonal job oppor-
tunities were thus created, Secretary Wirtz 
estimates, for at least 100,000 more domest.c. 
workers. This year even tighter limits cm 
imported farm labor will be enforced. 
Throughout the year farm interests sought 
to kill the restrictions by warning that crops 
would rot and prices skyrocket. Yet critical 
labor shortages were few; harvests were huge 
and the price of most fruits and vegetables 
declined. 
Despite the wage increases offered by grow-
ers to attract an adequate flow of domesti! 
labor, farm wages remain abysmally low by 
industrial standards. The Wirtz report indi 
cates that the farm average is $1.14 an hour 
and that in 11 States it is still under $1 an 
hour. This compares with a $2.82 average 
for factory workers. 
Farm laborers should be placed under the 
Federal minimum wage and the other pro-
tective laws that the rest of American labor 
has had for 30 years. It is time for Presi-
dent Johnson to push forward energetically 
on a front as fundamental as any in the war 
against poverty.

[From the report of June 5, 1965] 
In South Vietnam, the undeclared war con-
tinues to go badly. The decisions of our 
policymakers have not borne fruit, and the 
casualties mount day by day. The bombing 
raids across the border into North Vietnam 
apparently have not been successful in halt-
ing the aggression in the south, and I fear 
we are being drawn more and more deeply 
into a second Korean conflict, one that will 
be more costly than the Korean war. An-
other pipeline to suck up American men and 
materiel is being constructed, and no one can 
predict when we will be able to close down 
the Vietnam pumping station. 
We now have more than 50,000 American 
fighting men stationed in South Vietnam, 
and we are told that thousands more are on 
the way. 
As one who has watched and studied 
southeast Asia very closely since 1954, when 
the French were driven from Indochina, the 
senior Senator from Louisiana has a right to 
feel bitter and frustrated. I have visited 
that area on many occasions over the last 10 
years, and on each return trip from there I 
carried the same message: namely, that our 
Nation should not become involved, on its 
own, in a section of the world where we had 
no direct interest and which lay far outside 
our sphere of influence. 
I told the late John Foster Dulles, then 
Secretary of State under President Eisen-
hower, that preparations for war should not 
be encouraged by the establishment of Amer-
ican military advisory groups in South Viet-
nam. 
These military advisers do little more than 
keep the pot boiling. At their request, 
thousands of Americans were sent there to 
train the natives how to use our military 
hardware. Today we are sending thousands 
to do the actual fighting, while our rich allies 
of Western Europe gave us only their moral 
support. Some are critical of our actions. 
Despite my advice and on-the-scene experi-
ence, the advisers were sent in. 
I advised President Kennedy to withdraw 
our military; instead, their number was in-
creased. I suggested that steps be taken to 
make certain that the enormous amounts 
of economic aid to South Vietnam were dis-
tributed fairly and equitably; that President 
Diem be persuaded to mollify the dissident 
groups in his country, and satisfy their just 
grievances. No firm action along these lines 
was taken by our representatives. 
In spite of all my efforts, we entered the 
morass of southeast Asian politics with one 
eye closed and the other on an idealistic 
vision of what we hoped might somehow and 
someway be brought about. Now our eyes 
have been opened, and we have been brought 
down to earth. I only hope it is not too late, 
and that some way can be found to avoid an 
all-out war on the Asiatic mainland. 
[From the report of July 17, 1965] 
SOUTH VIETNAM 
In such a situation as now faces our Nation 
In South Vietnam, where we have gone in so 
deeply that the quicksands of southeast 
Asian politica are threatening to pull us 
under, we have no other recourse than to 
close ranks and support the policies of Presi-
dent Johnson and his advisers. The present 
and past administrations have taken a 
gamble and now it is too late to retreat. I 
for one do not believe that these so-called 
protest demonstrations against our foreign 
policy by beatniks, college students, and even 
teachers, do much good. They may very well 
do a great deal of harm, for the press and 
other news media play up these demonstra-
tions to such an extent that foreigners are 
led to believe that a majority of our people 
are not supporting the President. In point 
of fact, only a very small minority is doing 
the demonstrating, making the noise, and 
"teaching in," In my estimation, it would be 
better if we had more "study-ins" and fewer 
"teach-ins." 
[From the report of July 24, 19651 
VIETNAM 
To turn to a subject far removed from the 
District of Columbia, I was interested to 
hear Defense Secretary Robert McNamara's 
comments after his recent inspection tour 
of Vietnam. The situation, he said, has 
deteriorated "in many aspects," since his last 
visit of 15 months ago. These sentiments, 
of course, are in marked contrast to hie 
somewhat rosy early estimates of Our Viet-
nam difficulties. On prior visits much opti-
mism was expressed by him and many state-
ments were issued to the effect that we had 
tho situation well in hand. 
Unfortunately, his most recent statement, 
more closely approximates the true condi-
tions to be found in that unsettled corner of 
the world. Long ago, I predicted that we 
were embarking on a course of folly by be-
coming deeply involved in the civil strife 
then building up in Vietnam. 
It was my view that the presence of our 
so-called military advisers would serve to 
keep the pot boiling and cause both North 
Vietnam and Red China to provide more and 
more aid and assistance. I also pointed out 
to our officials on both the Vietnam and 
Washington levels, as well as to the Vietnam 
leadership, that the administration of the 
tremendous amounts of economic aid we 
were making available left a great deal to be 
desired. I did not feel that our aid was 
being made available to all Vietnamese citi-
zens on an equitable basis, and because of 
this, a large portion of the populace was 
being alienated from the Government. My 
advice went unheeded, and today not even 
a Solomon could provide satisfactory an-
swers. 
As a corollary to Vietnam, I am informed 
that further tax reductions, which the ad-
ministration's economic advisers had "in the 
works" for next year, may lave to be set 
aside because of increased outlays for de-
fense. In testimony before a congressional 
committee Tuesday, Gordon Ackley, the new 
Chairman of the President's Council of Eco-
nomic Advisers, indicated that a possible in-
crease in the exemption now allowed each 
taxpayer and his dependents, from $600 to 
$1,000, was being considered by the admin-
istration. 
In my view, and in light of the mammoth 
tax reductions in income and excise taxes 
the Congress has so recently enacted, further 
proposals for tax reductions should be greeted 
very skeptically by the Congress. Especially 
Is this true when rising defense expenditures 
are facing the Nation, as pointed out by Mr. 
Ackley, and when the Federal Government 
is headed into greatly expanded and more 
expensive activities in social welfare and re-
lated fields. 
It is estimated that every $100 increase 
in the $600 exemption allowed for taxpayers 
and dependents will result in the loss of $2.5 
billion in revenue for the Treasury. Thus, 
an increase of $400 in the exemption would 
bring about a Federal revenue loss of $10 
billion. I doubt very much that such a tax 
reduction can be justified at this time, or 
in the near future. 
[From the report of July 31, 19651 
THE PRESIDENT'S VIETNAM ADDRESS 
I listened very closely to the President's 
address to the Nation on the Vietnam situa-
tion last Wednesday at noon. As predicted. 
President Johnson did not reveal much new 
information or startling decisions. As a mat-
ter of fact, I was one of a small group of 
Senators summoned to the White House early 
Wednesday morning for an advance briefing 
on the President's address. He is very much 
worried, and as many of you know, he in-
herited much of the trouble that now pre-
vails in Vietnam. 
The main point of his remarks was that 
many more troops would be sent immediately 
to Vietnam, raising our total force there 
from 75,000 to 125,000 men. He stated that 
more may be sent later, and in answer to 
questions, indicated that the American peo-
ple could look forward to conflict in south-
east Asia for many years ahead?perhaps 6 
or 7. As you may recall, Secretary of Defense 
Robert McNamara recently stated our en-
gagement there may last as long as 5 or 10 
years, while Ho Chi Minh, leader of North 
Vietnam, has been reported as predicting 
that American forces may be fighting in 
South Vietnam for as long as 20 years. 
To compensate for this drain of American 
troops, the President stated that the draft 
would be increased from 17,000 to 35,000 
young men a month. I was pleased to hear 
the decision had been made not to call up 
the Reserves or to declare a state of emer-
gency at this time, although those possibili-
ties have not been ruled out for the future. 
Mr. Johnson said that he had instructed 
Secretary McNamara to request more defense 
funds from the Congress to support the in-
creases. Further requests would be made in 
the budget presentation next January, he 
said. 
I was also glad to hear President Johnson 
assure us that he had asked General West-
moreland, the commander of our forces in 
the area, what he needed to get the job done. 
The President said that the general had 
answered his request, and that all the needs 
of our fighting men would be supplied. Over 
the past few months, I have received cor-
respondence from some of the families and 
friends of our men in Vietnam, which in-
dicated that the equipment and supplies they 
were receiving left something to be desired. 
If we are going to fight what amounts to a 
full-scale war in Vietnam, it seems to me 
that we should make every effort to see that 
every possible advantage is working on our 
side. It appears to me that we are going to 
need all the odds we can get. 
No doubt the Congress will approve the re-
quest for funds needed to support our efforts 
In South Vietnam. In a situation such as 
this, we in Congress can do little else, in all 
good conscience, than support our President. 
He is acting on far more accurate informa-
tion than Congress has at its command. I 
only hope that the information given the 
President represents a true picture of the 
situation, which seems to grow from bad to 
worse with each passing day. So far, the 
results of plans pushed forward by our mili-
tary experts in the Pentagon have not been 
reassuring. It strikes me that we seem to be 
making some of the same mistakes made by 
the French generals in the years before 1954, 
when they were defeated at Dienbienphu and 
driven out of Indochina. From my study of 
that long, drawn-out guerrilla war, it is ob-
vious that one of the primary faults of the 
French was that they greatly underesti-
mated the fighting potential of their enemy. 
The Vietminh defined the terms of war very 
differently than do the leaders of any mod-
ern army. And, just as was the case 10 or 
15 years ago, the Vietcong is now in a posi-
tion to impose their own definitions. 
But make no mistake about it, I hold no 
brief with those in our society who seek to 
divide the national purpose and weaken our 
resolve to do what must be done in the de-
fense of freedom and in opposition to com-
munism. I wish only that some of our so-
called allies could be persuaded to bear the 
burden with us. And I also hope and pray 
that ways and means can be found to settle 
this conflict by negotiation, as the President 
also hoped for in his remarks Wednesday. 
[From the report of Aug. 7, 1965] 
MORE FUNDS FOR VIETNAM 
Turning to a subject far removed from our 
labor legislation, President Johnson last week 
sent Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara 
to the Congress with a request for an addi-
tional $1.7 billion for defense expenditures. 
The request, of course, is necessitated by our 
involvement in the Vietna;m conflict. It is

one more step in which I predict will be a 
long series of increased expenditures to carry 
on the war in Vietnam. At this point there 
is actually no way of telling for how long we 
may be heavily involved in that strife-torn 
section of the world. 
As I said last week, I am sure the Congress 
will approve this request without much op-
position, for no other course is open to those 
of us who have responsibility in these mat-
ters. As you may recall, several months ago 
the Congress was asked to approve a request 
li)r an additional $700 million for expendi-
ture in Vietnam for economic aid and other 
Purposes. What I fear is that because we are 
now sending more and more American forces 
In carry on the actual fighting, the South 
Vietnamese will be more and more prone to 
let us carry the entire burden. Since there 
Il. no stable government in South Vietnam, 
do not see how it will be possible to force 
young Vietnamese to carry on the fight. 
[From the report of Sept. 24, 19651 
:HOPE IN VIETNAM_ 
On our eastern front in Vietnam, it seems 
that at long last the tide of the battle may 
be turning. Our large commitment of U.S. 
men and materiel is beginning to bring 
more and more pressure upon the enemy, 
and of course, something would be seriously 
wrong if victories could not be entered on the 
ledger to at least partially balance the many 
defeats we have had to bear at the hands of 
the elusive Vietcong. 
Unfortunately, the end is as yet nowhere 
Iii sight, and I fear that a great many more 
lives will be sacrificed before. another Amer-
ican peace can be imposed on the rice pad-
dies and jungles of South Vietnam. 
While the news of our military victories 
Is good, there is other recent news that is 
deeply disturbing to me. Now that the 
American commitment to South Vietnam 
has been made very plain by the President's 
statements and by the dispatch of more 
than 100,000 American troops, it is no doubt 
very obvious to the Vietcong that they can-
not expect to gain a military victory against 
such odds. So it will be only natural for 
them to seek other avenues for action. 
The recent, student riots and demonstra-
tions which have occurred in various Viet-
narnese cities against the Government seem 
to open up one of these avenues. The Viet-
cong must know, as well as you and I do, that 
a stable government is absolutely essential 
for any Western victory. I suspect, therefore, 
that more and more civilian political action, 
such as these student riots, will be orga-
nized and directed against the incumbent 
Government. At the present, it seems to me 
that a revolt of the civilian populace is by 
no means out of the question, and it holds 
dangers far more severe than any defeat of 
American forces. It must not be forgotten 
that the Vietnames people have very little 
feeling of national unity, and feel very lit-
tle sense of allegiance to any Saigon govern-
ment. I express the hope that if we manage 
to pull through the very dangerous monsoon 
period, which will end in October. we will 
not find ourselves out of the military frying 
pan only to land into the fire of civilian 
upheaval. 
From the report of Jan. 15, 1966] 
"UR VIETNAM CONFLICT 
While on my tour of the State, I also 
found that the Vietnam conflict was the sub-
ject of much intense interest and much 
speculation as to the probable outcome. 
Upon returning to Washington, I found 
much, interest centering on the role the 
United States is playing in the attempt to 
bring that beleaguered nation out of its 
difficulties. There is much difference of 
opinion both within and without the Senate 
as to what our future course of action 
should be. Frankly, your senior Senator is 
very much concerned about thii situation in 
which we now find ourselves, and about the 
pitfalls that lie along both slate of the path 
we are following. 
There is no question that it is now vital 
that our Nation act decisively to prevent a 
Communist takeover in South Vietnam. The 
prestige and power of the United States has 
beep laid on the line, and to withdraw under 
present conditions would do us untold 
damage not only on the Asian Continent, but 
all over the world. Our Nation has never 
run from a fight, and now that we have been 
drawn so deeply into this one, it seems to me 
that. we have no choice except to stick it out 
until some sort of honorable resolution can 
be achieved. If our adversaries will not agree 
to meaningful peace talks, they should be 
hit harder, and the industrial and political 
centers of North Vietnam should be bombed 
by our forces if necessary. 
As wears carrying out, a n jittery cam-
paign in Vietnam, however, I frmly believe 
that a. second front should he opened in 
Western Europe. In other words. If a vic-
tory or a cessation of the fighting is im-
portant for the future protection of the free 
world, we should make it plain to our so-
called allies in Western Europe that we ex-
pect some meaningful assistance from them 
in carrying the burden. By meaningful 
assistance, I mean mote than the moral sup-
port that has been offered until now. We 
should impress upon our friends that the 
United States cannot be expet led to bear 
the entre load in southeast Asia, as we are 
already doing in Korea, and at the same time, 
maintain thousands of troops en duty for 
their protection in Western Europe. If of-
fers of meaningful aid are not ibrthcoming, 
advocate beginning the withdrawal of the 
thousands of troops we now have garrisoned 
across toe Atlantic. This seems to my mind 
to be toe commonsense approa th, and one 
that is long overdue. 
In the past, we have been ton easy going 
in our relations with our erstwhile allies. As 
you. may know, I have complained about 
this to ;crest and present administrations on 
numerous occasions, and I have recommended 
that a much stiffer line be taken by the 
negotiators in our State Department. Until 
now, the line has always been taken that the 
United States is the richest and most power-
ful nation on earth, and therefore we should 
be willing and able to carry on alone, no 
matter what the cost and sacrifice. The fact 
that the Western European nations have 
also became rich and powerful during the 
past two decades, due in large part to our 
own generosity toward them, seems to be 
almost completely forgotten. 
Now, however, the shoe of his commit-
ments at home and abroad is beginning to 
pinch Uncle Sam's foot a little bit. We are 
waking up to the fact, or we should be, that 
our Nation is simply not rich enough, or 
powerful enough, to act as the policeman and 
protector of the entire world. We need 
assistance from those who are directly bene-
fiting from our protection. We have been 
holding an umbrella OT military might over 
Western Europe entirely too long. If we 
cannot obtain help when it is needed, from 
those we have been sheltering in the past, I 
say that it is time to begin folding up the 
umbrella.

MORE FUNDS FOR VIETNA aT 
Also in connection with southeast Asia, the 
President has sent to the Congreas a special 
request for another appropriation to carry 
on the struggle in Vietnam. The special 
amount requested for this fiscal year is $12.7 
billion, over and above the special appropri-
ations made for that purpose last year, and 
above the billions of dollars provided in the 
regular Department of Defense appropria-
tion bill. 
The amount of this latest request - -- $12.7 
billion?provides a good measure of the in-
creased role we are playing in the Vietnam 
conflict. Although the Congress has been 
informed that only about half the sum asked 
for is to be actually expended this year, I 
have no doubt that more and greater ex-
penditures can be expected in the future. 
Of course, our boys fighting in the rice 
paddies and jungles must be supported in 
every manner conceivable, and I am certain 
that the Congress and the country will do 
everything possible to see that their needs 
are met. You may rest assured that I shall 
do everything in my power to render what-
ever assistance is needed in order to bring 
the conflict there to a speedy end. Not, only 
should our servicemen be supported, but as 
I stated last week, if the enemy continues 
to refuse to enter into meaningful negotia-
tions for peace, their industrial centers 
should be hit by our forces until there 'an 
be no Mistaking our intention to win an 
honorable peace in Vietnam.. 
Also included in the supplemental appro-
priation request is the sum of $115 million 
to be spent as an addition to this year's for-
eign aid program. Two hundred and ninety 
million dollars of that amount is earmarked 
for supporting assistance to southeast Asian 
nations. South Vietnam is to receive $275 
million of this supporting assistance, while 
Laos and Thailand are to be the recipients of 
another $15 million. One hundred million 
dollars is also requested as an addition to 
the foreign aid contingnecy fund. 
I was surprised to see included n the see-
plemental request the sum of $25 million for 
support to the Dominican Republic. It 
seems as if the President is now learning 
what it will cost if we continue our attempts 
to police, pacify, and bring prosperity to 
every corner of the world. 
Before leaving the subject of southeast 
Asia and Vietnam, you will recall that last 
week I advocated that the administration 
and the State Department toughen our pol-
icy toward our so-called allies in Western 
Europe. On the question of assisting lei to 
carry our worldwide burdens, particularly 
In southeast Asia, where we hare no real 
economic interest, I pointed out that the 
struggle to protect and defend the free world 
Is as much their struggle as it is ours. I 
further stated that I could see no real rea-
son why our Nation should continue to main-
tain thousands of men garrisoned in West-
ern Europe. The defense against aggression 
that these troops have provided has turned 
out to be an umbrella, beneath which West-
ern Europe has found peace and prosperity. 
Also, the maintenance of these thousands 
of men has proved to be a substantial drain 
of our U.S. gold supply, and the recipients 
of this drain have been the coffers of our 
allies. 
Last week I did a little checking into the 
record, and found that as of December 31. 
1960, our military had 352,000 men stationed 
in Western Europe, plus 9,916 U.S. employees; 
and 311,000 dependents. The number s tit-
tioned abroad rose by 54,000 during the period 
of the Berlin crisis, and then dropped some-
what after that. But the fact remains that 
as of September 30, 1965, the United States 
maintained 331,000 troops on guard in West-
ern Europe, supported by 11,344 civilian em-
ployees, together with 288,000 dependents. 
To my mind and in light of the current 
situation, this state of affairs is elmost in-
excusable. Our so-called allies have benefited 
from the military umbrella we have been 
holding over them for many years. They 
were able to reduce their military spending 
and build their own economy with the ex-
penditure each year of many millions of 
dollars by our soldiers, their dependents, and 
our civilian employees. Now when we go 
to them for assistance, we find that nobody 
is home. That is why I stated last week 
that unless we can secure scone meaningful

way out of the current conflict, we should 
make it plain to them that we will begin

OUR ALLIES AND VIETNAM 
Last week I called attention to the fact 
that over the last 5 years the United States 
has maintained a garrison of well over 300,-
000 troops on the other side of the Atlantic 
in Western Europe. As a matter of fact, the 
number of servicemen stationed in that sec-
tion of the world at the end of 1960 was 
352,000. By September 30 of 1965, the total 
had decreased by only 20,090 men under 
arms?to a figure of slightly less than 
331,000. 
I also pointed out that in addition to these 
fighting men, we maintain a sizable con-
tingent of dependents and supporting per-
sonnel. For instance, as of September 30 of 
last year, there were almost 288,000 depend-
ents of U.S. servicemen in Western Europe, 
in addition to over 11,000 U.S. civilian em-
ployees working for the Pentagon. 
The idea behind these figures is simply 
this. The economies of the Western Europe 
nations?our so-called allies?have benefited 
tremendously from the presence of these 
American troops on their shores. These bene-
fits have been realized in two ways. First, 
our troops have provided protection against 
possible Russian aggression, and because of 
this protection, our allies have been able to 
throw the resources at their command into 
the building up of their own economies. 
They have not been required to devote large-
scale national efforts to develop and main-
tain military establishments as we have done. 
Because they have been so successful in de-
veloping their peacetime economies, with 
the assistance of both our massive foreign 
aid program and our military presence, they 
are today giving our American industry and 
businesses real competition in the market-
places of the world. 
In the second place, and equally important 
to my way of thinking, the great amount of 
money we have been required to send abroad 
to support and maintain these troops, de-
pendents, and civilian employees, has been 
spent for the direct economic benefit of the 
host nations. It has also been to the direct 
economic benefit of our own Nation. As an 
illustration of this fact, I have recently ob. 
tained figures indicating what it costs OUT 
Government to maintain these hundreds of 
thousands of troops, the supporting civilians, 
and their dependents. That figure amounts 
to approximately 2.4 billion annually. To be 
specific, in the last fiscal year?fiscal year 
1965?the total expenditure amounted to 
$2,390 million. That figure includes only 
Western Europe, and does not include the 
maintenance and upkeep of the sizable garri-
sons we maintain in Greece and Turkey; it 
does not include the cost of supplying and 
maintaining the 6th Fleet, which Is con-
stantly on patrol in the Mediterranean and 
Atlantic; nor does it include the major pro-
curement costs of the planes, ships, and guns 
with which our fighting men are equipped. 
I have also obtained figures concerning 
our balance-of-payments deficits for fiscal 
year 1965. By coincidence, last year's bal-
ance-of-payment deficits amounted to $2.3 
billion, almost exactly equal to our Western 
European support cost of $24 billion. Not 
all of our military expenditures contributed 
to our balance-of-payments problem, be-
cause some of the dollars were returned to 
our shores. But our administrators readily 
admit that a large portion of our Western 
European expenditures do show up on the 
balance sheets to keep our international ac-
counts in the red. 
It is estimated that during the first half 
of fiscal year 1966, that is, from July to De-
cember 1965, our deficit in payments-amount-
ed to approximately $1.3 billion. I have been 
assured that stringent policies are being fol-
lowed by the administration, and that the 
situation should improve considerably in the 
coming months. That may or may not be 
the case, for rosy predictions have been made 
In this area before, and have turned out to be 
sadly wanting. That is why I advocate 
now, as I have in the past, that definite steps 
be taken to secure Western European assist-
ance in the Vietnam conflict. Common-
sense requires it, and our own self-interest 
demands it. We can no longer afford to po-
lice and protect all the world, with no help 
other than lipservice from those we have 
been protecting and defending in years past. 
Our allies must be made to realize that the 
struggle for freedom is as much their strug-
gle as it is ours. It is only realistic to expect 
them to bear a fair share of the burden. 
[From the report of Feb. 19, 1966] 
Moles FONDS FOR VIETNAM 
Last week the Senate laid aside the ques-
tion of repealing 14(b) in this session of the 
Congress, and has moved on to other matters. 
The first important legislation to be taken 
up by the Senate after the Lincoln's Day 
holiday was the supplemental military au-
thorization bill to carry on our efforts in 
Vietnam, 
This legislation would authorize additional 
appropriations during the last half of fiscal 
year 1966 for the procurement of planes and 
ships, and for research and testing of new 
devices and techniques to enable our forces 
to deal more effectively with guerrilla fight-
ers. The bill also contains the sum of $1.2 
billion for the construction of bases and fa-
cilities in southeast Asia. 
I have been closely following the difficulties 
our forces have been experiencing in receiv-
ing the necessary supplies and hardware 
shipped from the States. A large part of 
these difficulties has to do with the lack of 
adequate port facilities for the unloading of 
ships and the handling of vast amounts of 
cargo which we are pouring into Vietnam. It 
is my hope that the sums authorized in the 
bill, and which will be provided by the Con-
gress in a separate appropriation measure, 
will do a great deal to solve this vexing prob-
lem in the near future. I have on many oc-
casions stated my belief that our boys who 
are fighting and dying in the jungles and rice 
paddies of South Vietnam should be sup-
plied with all of the weapons and armaments 
that are necessary. 
I have received reports from time to time 
that shortages have occurred among several 
items of clothing and military hardware used 
by our troops. I have looked into the matter 
through the Department of Defense, and have 
been assured that where such shortages do 
exist, they are being filled as rapidly as pos-
sible. Plant production of some items, such 
as special jungle boots and clothing, for ex-
ample, have not yet reached what our au-
thorities consider an adequate level to sup-
ply the need. 
It is my hope and expectation that this 
current legislation will make it possible to 
fill any shortages of any items which might 
be needed by our fighting men. As you may 
know, the Subcommittee on Military Pre-
paredness, headed by Senator STENNIS, of 
Mississippi, is looking into this problem, with 
the view of seeing to it that any deficiencies 
that come to light may be immediately cor-
rected. 
In connection with the military construc-
tion authorization, I was very disappointed 
several weeks ago when it was announced 
that several items authorized and funded by 
the Congress for military construction in 
this country would be indefinitely delayed 
because of mounting Vietnam expenditures. 
Several projects scheduled for construction 
in Louisiana were placed in this category. 
I am glad to note that the supplemental 
military authorization bill contains the sum 
of $6 million for the rehabilitation and con-
struction of barracks at Fort Polk. In addi-
tion, the regular military construction bill 
for the next fiscal year contains $861,000 for 
the construction of living quarters at Fort 
Polk, plus $700,000 for the construction of 
troop housing and other facilities at Barks-
dale Air Force Base in Bossier Parish. 
You may recall that when the President 
first sent this special spending request to the 
Congress earlier in the year, the total amount 
asked for was $12.8 billion. The bill taken 
up by the Senate last week dealt with only 
$12.3 billion of that original request. The 
other portion?$415 million?is in the cate-
gory of economic assistance, and must be 
acted upon by the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee of the Senate before the funds can be 
appropriated. 
Of the $415 million total requested for sup-
plemental economic assistance, $275 mil-
lion has been programed for Vietnam; 
$175 million is to be used to finance 
the import of various agricultural and 
industrial commodities into South Viet-
nam. The other $100 million will go to 
finance the special counterinsurgency and 
rural construction program that is being 
developed. 
One of the most interesting items in this 
special appropriation request is the sum of 
$21 million for the importation of rice into 
Vietnam. It appears that under the on-
slaught of war, the production of rice has 
been greatly curtailed, and where the Viet-
namese at one time were able to export this 
commodity, it now must be brought into 
their country. 
It is for this reason that President John-
son recently announced that he had in-
structed Secretary of Agriculture Orville 
Freeman to increase our rice acreage allot-
ment by 10 percent this year. More and 
more of this staple cornmodity will no doubt 
be required in the weeks and months ahead. 
As I recently pointed out, it was not long ago 
that we were forced to purchase 150,000 tons 
of rice from Thailand for shipment to South 
Vietnam. As long as the requirement must 
continue to be met, and financed by the U.S. 
Treasury, I would much prefer that the ex-
penditures be made on our home soil, for the 
benefit of our American farmers. 
[From the report of Feb. 26, 19661 
RIGHT TO DISSENT?VIETNAM 
Today, the Nation is doing battle in a far 
corner of the world. While some of us may 
not agree entirely with that battle or its 
aims, it is nevertheless important that we 
present a united front to the enemy. A noisy 
minority speaking against our position Can-
not help doing more harm than good, it 
seems to me. They cannot help but give 
comfort to the enemy. Legitimate dissent 
must be tolerated if we are to maintain our 
free society, but in many cases the bounds 
have been overstepped. 
As you no doubt know, much debate over 
our Vietnam policy is now taking place in 
the halls of Congress and its committees. 
My fear is that many Senators fail to under-
stand that we are already in action in South 
Vietnam. It is no longer a question of get-
ting into the fight?we are already in it. In 
other words, we are committed and Must now 
back up our commitment. 
I have no doubt in my own mind that many 
of the statements now issuing from Con-
gress or from congressional commjttees will 
do no good to our cause in the fighting. I 
feel that some Congressmen and Senators--
although certainly they are not doing it wil-
fully?are giving a lot of relief and a lot of 
propaganda material to Hanoi. In my opin-
ion, this may result in postponing the end of 
the action?whether by military victory, a 
Cease fire, or negotiation. In other words, as

long as the pot of American public opinion 
Is kept stirred up and boiling, the leaders of 
Hanoi and Red China can continue in their 
hopes that the escape valve will be opened in 
time to let the Vietcong win the war. I be-
hove that too much dissension and difference 
of opinion, especially on the part of those not 
directly responsible for making and enforc-
ing the decisions, can be very misleading to 
the enemy. The result will be longer war, 
and the killing and wounding of more of our 
soldiers. I. for one do not want to see that. 
TEACHER SPEAKS OUT AGAINST 
SLASH IN SCHOOL MILK PROGRAM 
Mr. PROXMIRE. Mr. President, I 
have received dozens of letters from 
school administrators, teachers, parents 
and children opposing the administra-
tion's plans to cut the special milk pro-
aTain for schoolchildren by 80 percent. 
As time passes I become more and more 
convinced that this cut simply cannot be 
justified. 
Here is what one Wisconsin school-
teacher says about the cut: 
E am teaching in my 29th year and I feel 
that one of the finest things the Government 
has ever done for our boys and girls is the 
milk program. It makes me sick to read 
that this is to be dropped. In the same 
paper you can read of large amounts being 
spent for recreation programs for our rich 
Lu enjoy. It doesn't seem fair to me to 
deny our children milk which they need and 
enjoy and then spend it for recreation. 
Mr. President, as one who has long 
fought against pork barrel public works 
Projects which often are justified on the 
grounds that they will enhance recrea-
tion benefits, I say amen to this state-
ment. We must allocate our resources 
efficiently if the taxpayer is to get the 
most out of his tax dollar. I know of 
no program of greater proven worth than 
the school milk program. Every penny 
.amnt means greater health for our Na-
tion's children. We cannot forget this 
ttreatest of our natural resources. 
This Wisconsin teacher goes on to give 
a concrete example of what the school 
milk program means to her pupils. She 
says: 
5/Ey little 6- to 8-year olds must eat before 
1:30 to meet the bus. Dinner is served at 
11:30 and the last ones aren't home until 
4:45. The milk break at 2 pm. is exactly 
what they need. It is economical so every-
one has it, except three Amish pupils. It is 
not only for low-income families whose chil-
dren do not have the milk these little bodies 
need * *. Ti ls not only low-income fam-
ilies who have parents that do not buy milk 
tor their children so I feel that all children 
need the milk. 
Mr. President; I would like to conclude 
my remarks by quoting one last sentence 
from this excellent letter. I think it 
speaks for itself: 
The breakfast program (proposed by Presi-
(lent Johnson) may be fine but it can never 
do so much good to so many children for so 
tile money. 
PROCEDURES FOR THE REMOVAL, 
RETIREMENT, AND DISCIPLINING 
OF UNFIT FEDERAL JUDGES 
Mr. HART. Mr. President, it is ad-
mitting to no weakness in our Federal 
court system that we seek to determine 
the adequacy of the procedures dealing 
with the removal, retirement, and disci-
plining of unfit judges. 
Rather the junior Senator from Mary-
land I Mr. Tymmsl, whose subcommit-
tee is conducting hearings in this area, 
seeks to determine "whether the Federal 
judiciary has the necessary statutory 
tools to police its own house fairly and 
efficiently, and, if not, to explore the pos-
sibility of enacting remedial legislation." 
Senator ?rYDINGS displays botli courage 
and energy in, opening up this admittedly 
sensitive subject. All of us are the 
better for his willingness and leadership. 
Fortunately, there have been only rare 
instances where a man of questioned 
ability or integrity has presided over a 
Federal court. But the infrequency of 
having such a man on the bench does not 
obviate the need for a solutiou to deal 
with the problem when it arises 
As SerlatOr TYDINGS points out in his 
opening statement at the committee 
hearings, many influential judtas them-
selves feel that present correcti,.7e meas-
ures are inadequate and that this inquiry 
is needed. 
We are well aware of the tremendous 
backlog of cases that confronts our Fed-
eral courts today.. The delay before 
many are brought to trial can be as 
much as 3 years. The division of this 
workload leaves no room for one judge 
who is unfit. And, it goes without say-
ing, that in administering justiee, there 
is no place for such a judge. 
Cettainly, I consider Senator TYruNcs' 
explanation of the problem and scope of 
the inquiry as one to which we should. 
direct our attention. 
Mr. President, at this point it my re-
marks, I ask unanimous consent that 
Senator TYDE,tcs' February 15 opening 
statement at the hearings before the 
SubcommAtee on Improvement: in Ju-
dicial Machinery be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There Leing no objection, tlia state-
ment was ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD., as follows: 
OPENING t.AT1a55ENT OF CHAIRIVIAN JOSEPH 
D. TY-DINGS AT HEARINGS BEFORE THE SUB-
COMMITTEE ON IMPROVEMENTS IN JUDICIAL 
MACHINERY ON PROCEDURES FOR THE RE-
MOVAL, IR ENIREMENT, AND DISCTPL, SING OF 
UNFIT kEDERA L JUDGES, PEBRUARY 15, 1966 
Today the Subcommittee on Imprt:vements 
in Judicial Machinery holds its ire hal ses-
sion of hearings on the availability of and 
need for procedures to govern the removal, 
retirement, and disciplining of unfit. Federal 
judges. An inquiry of this nature ...las been 
contemplated for several months aml today's 
session will be only the first step in a 
lengthy and careful examination. 
The purpose of these hearings is io deter-
mine whether the Federal judiciary has the 
necessary statutory tools to police its own 
house fairly and efficiently, arid, if not, to 
explore the passibility of enacting ,temedial 
legislation. These hearings do not indicate 
any lack of confidence in the Federal bench. 
Indeed, the, subcommittee recognitias that 
our Federal judiciary, as a whole, is charac-
terised by men of remarkable integrity and 
ability. We believe that, given the proper 
tools, the judiciary has the capacity to handle 
the problems created by the tiny handful of 
judges who because of physical or mental 
disability, senility, alcoholism, lazioess, or 
misfeasance, do immeasurable harm to the 
efficient administration of lustice. 
Anyone even casually familiar with the 
Federal courts knows that their dockets are 
crowded and becoming more so as the 
amount of judicial business increases year 
by year. The situation is already critical. 
In certain districts the average litigant may 
wait for more than 3 years after joinder of 
Issue before his case goes to trial. This is 
not merely a matter of administrative con-
cern, for justice delayed is justice denied. 
To remedy this state of affairs, we in the 
Congress are constantly asked to provide 
snore judgeships for various Federal districts 
and circuits, and we often hear proposals to 
place further limitations on the jurisdiction 
of the Federal courts in order to halt the 
constant increase in caseload. 
But these measures cannot be enough. It 
makes no sense to keep adding more judges, 
or to deny litigants access to the Federal 
courts, if the backlog is caused to sly degree 
by inefficient or unit judges. 
The workload in many districts is such 
that the court is crippled if even a single 
judge does not carry his share of the burden. 
I think that everyone agrees Unit ideally 
such an unfit judge should be replaced with-
out delay, but only after a careful, impartial 
evolution of his fitness. Yet one thing that 
recent events have made clear is; that. there is 
at present no fair and effective procedure for 
dealing with these cases when they arise. 
The subcommittee cannot ignore the chit,-
rule that occurred recently in the western. 
district of Oklahoma. For reasons that bane 
not yet been made clear, the Judicial Council. 
of the 10th Judicial Circuit, composed of 
able and conscientious appellate judges, 
reached the conclusion that Chief Judge 
Stephen S. Chandler of the western district 
of Oklahoma was "either unwilling or un-
able" to perform his judicial functions ade-
quately. It therefore ordered that, Judge 
Chandler be assigned no more cases and take 
no further action in cases pending before 
him. It based its action on section 332 of 
the Judicial Code, which gives a judicial 
council authority to "make all necessary 
orders for the effective and expeditious ad-
ministration of the business of the courts 
within its circuit." 
Judge Chandler has challenged this action 
In a petition to the Supreme Court, and has 
refused to obey the order with regime l to the 
cases already pending before him. Just last 
week, more than a month after tite order 
was originally issued, the judicial council 
agreed to rescind one part of the order and 
to allow judge Chandler to dispose of those 
cases already pending before him. 
I do not wish to comment at this time on 
the legal issues involved in the disuute be-
tween Judge Chandler and the judicial coun-
cil. Nor can I comment on the question of 
Judge Chandler's actual fitness to continue 
on the bench, since the facts have not yet 
been brought out. An examination of the 
procedures used, however, leads me to be-
lieve that, regardless of the outcome of the 
Chandler case, the judiciary needs better 
tools to deal with this sort of proble:n. 
The judicial council's abortive action in 
the Chandler case created havoc in the west-
ern district of Oklahoma. Look at what 
happened: A judge was ordered to cease the 
performance of his judicial functions yet he 
was apparently given no notice that action 
was about to be taken against him, no 
charges were specified against him, iend he 
was given no opportunity to present evi-
dence or argument in his defense. The 
judge refused to relinquish jurisdiction over 
cases pending before him, although he had 
been ordered to do so and although the other 
Judges of his district had divided his cases 
among themselves. 
The Chandler case is an unfortunate inci-
dent. It is unfortunate in that a judge has 
apparently behaved in such a way that some 
of his colleagues are convinced he is no

longer fit to serve on the bench. It is un-
fortunate in that the procedures used?ap-
parently the only ones available to the judi-
cial council?did not allow Judge Chandler 
to obtain a complete and fair hearing of the 
charges against him. It is unfortunate in 
that the judicial council's order and Judge 
Chandler's intransigence created inexcusable 
confusion for litigants and attorneys in the 
western district of Oklahoma. And finally 
and perhaps most important, it is unfortu-
nate in that the wrangling and recrimina-
tions that have occurred have _exposed our 
fine Federal judicial system to disrepute and 
even ridicule. 
The Chandler case has brought to the at-
tention of the Nation, a situation that has 
troubled many observers for a long time. In 
October, long before the judicial council's 
action regarding Judge Chandler, I an-
nounced that the Subcommittee on Improve-
ments in Judicial Machinery would conduct 
a study of the problems posed by judicial 
unfitness. We have done a great deal of re-
search on this subject, and today we hold 
our first session of hearings. 
The purpose of today's hearing is to out-
line and explore the difficulties that are 
presently experienced in handling the in-
frequent instances of unfitness in the Fed-
eral judiciary. Historically the only method 
of actually removing a Federal judge from 
office, so that he is deprived of his title and 
his right to salary, has been impeachment. 
This has created several difficulties, which 
our witnesses will explore with us in some 
detail tomorrow and at later sessions. First, 
constitutionally, impeachment lies only for 
"treason, bribery, or other high crimes and 
misdemeanors." It is uncertain whether 
senility, insanity, physical disability, al-
coholism or laziness?all of which are forms 
of unfitness that require remedial action---
are covered by the impeachment process. 
The second difficulty lies in the nature of 
the impeachment machinery. Even in the 
early years of the Republic the inadequacy of 
this process was recognized. "Experience 
has already shown," Jefferson said in 1819, 
"that the impeachment the Constitution has 
provided is not even a scarecrow." It is a 
cumbersome, archaic process which requires 
one House of Congress, the House of Repre-
sentatives, to act as a grand jury, and the 
other House, the Senate, to sit in judgment 
as a court. The House can perhaps do its 
share of the work effectively through the 
Judiciary Committee, but what of the Sen-
ate? We all know that the Members of the 
Senate are hard pressed to fulfill the 
many demands of the office. If we were re-
quired to do nothing but listen to testimony 
in an impeachment case for several weeks, 
the legislative calendar would be completely 
disrupted. Obviously, few _Senators would 
be able to give so much of their time, yet I 
submit that an impeachment trial before an 
empty Senate Chamber would be little more 
than a farce. It would hardly comport with 
modern standards of justice. No conviction 
of a criminal defendant would be tolerated 
if it came after a trial at which most of the 
jurors were not present to hear the testimony. 
Impeachment is perhaps the sole method 
of removal of Federal judges that may be 
constitutionally employed by the Congress, 
for the principle of an independent judiciary, 
free from interference by the legislative or 
executive branches, is central to the concept 
of a government of separated powers. But 
this is not to say that impeachment is the 
only constitutionally permissible method of 
removing a Federal judge from office. It 
should be borne in mind that a judge is to 
serve "during good behavior," while impeach-
ment lies only for "high crimes and misde-
meanors." It may be that the framers in-
tended to permit other methods of removal 
not inconsistent with the principle of sep-
aration of powers. The scholarship on this 
question is disappointingly sparse, and I 
hope that one of the effects of our study will 
be to stimulate some scholarly reexamina-
tion of the arguments for and against the 
exclusivity of impeachment as a removal 
procedure. 
Aside from impeachment and the disputed 
method employed by the 10th Circuit Judicial 
Council in the Chandler case, there is only 
one other provision which allows remedial 
action to be taken in the case of an unfit 
judge. This is a very limited provision which 
permits the judicial council of a circuit to 
certify the disability of a judge to the Presi-
dent, in which case the President may ap-
point an additional judge, in effect to take 
the disabled judge's place. 
Many people?including, let us emphasize, 
many influential judges themselves?feel 
that this array of weapons is inadequate 
to deal with the problem of judicial un-
fitness, and that is why we are beginning 
this inquiry today. It is not our intention 
to conduct an expos?f the Federal judiciary. 
Such an expos?ould undoubtedly find 
little to expose. We intend, rather, to ascer-
tain whether there are now adequate pro-
cedures for dealing with those rare but dam-
aging cases of judicial unfitness that do oc-
cur. If, as of many of us expect, we find 
that existing procedures are inadequate, we 
shall attempt to remedy the situation. 
The area of judicial fitness presents many 
difficult questions of law and policy. I sus-
pect that we shall be at this job for some 
time. 
POOL FORGE'S 250TH ANNIVERSARY 
Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, it is fit-
ting that we take note of the 250th an-
niversary this year of the founding of 
Pool Forge?the first iron forge in Penn-
sylvania. This humble establishment 
was started in 1716 by Thomas Rutter 
on the banks of the Manatawny Creek 
in what is now Douglass Township, Berks 
County. 
Pool Forge was the forerunner of the 
many Pennsylvania forges which were so 
vital to early settlers and provided much 
of the ordnance in our struggle for inde-
pendence. These early iranmasters with 
their charcoal burning furnaces con-
tributed a great deal to our Nation's 
early growth. We owe much to these 
men of ability and courage who literally 
started with the ground they walked 
on and the forest around them. Their 
primitive methods are long gone, and 
the focus in metals has moved from iron 
to steel. 
Today Pennsylvania plays a mighty 
role in all parts of the metals industry. 
In this same county of Berks, metal 
products range from basic iron and steel 
Items to highly specialized steel alloys 
and beryllium alloys for use throughout 
the Nation. In this time of vastness and 
complexity, we would be wise to keep the 
realization that here is one small begin-
ning?one small forge which is not only 
important as part of our history, but is 
a vivid reminder of the pioneer spirit we 
must keep with us. Courage and ability 
never grow old, and although we work 
at different tasks today, we have need 
of the same incentives as that which 
built Pool Forge. 
GARY?A LOGICAL CHOICE FOR A 
DEMONSTRATION CITY 
Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, a massive 
demonstration cities program which 
would "offer qualifying cities of all sizes 
the promise of a new life for their people" 
was proposed by President Johnson on 
January 26. In line with this recom-
mendation, I was pleased to join a num-
ber of e,olleaghes in cosponsoring the 
demonstration cities bill, S. 2842, which 
was introduced by the senior Senator 
from Illinois [Mr. DOUGLAS]. 
Both the President's message and the 
legislation proposed to achieve its goals 
have aroused widespread interest among 
'urban dwellers, city officers, and the 
press. Recently the editor of the Gary 
Post Tribune, Mr. Dale E. Belles, Jr., 
wrote an editorial in the form of an open 
letter to the President, Secretary Weaver, 
Senator HARTKE, Representative MADDEN, 
and myself, which sets forth the reasons 
why Gary, Ind., would be a logical com-
munity to be chosen as one of the "dem-
onstration cities." 
Although Congress has not yet acted 
on this significant measure, I agree with 
Mr. Belles that it is not too early to begin 
giving consideration to the qualifications 
of prospective cities for this selection. 
Because Mr. Belles' editorial quite ac-
curately reflects the spirit of cooperation 
and enthusiasm of civic leaders in Gary, 
I ask unanimous consent that it be 
printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the editorial 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
AS WE SEE IT?WIlY GARY IS A LOGICAL 
DEMONSTRATION CITY 
TO PRESIDENT LYNDON B. JOHNSON; SECRE-
TARY ROBERT C. WEAVER, DEPARTMENT 
OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT; 
SENATOR BIRCH BAY1i; SENATOR VANCE 
HARTKE; REPRESENTATIVE RAY J. MADDEN. 
GENTLEMEN: We have read with interest 
and excitement the President's message of 
January 26 to the Congress on demonstration 
cities. 
We are convinced that Gary should be one 
of those demonstration cities. 
Here, in part, are the reasons: 
A. On the positive side-
1. Gary has shown through the combined 
governmental and civic launching of pro-
grams for new industry, downtown revitaliza-
tion, and improved educational and recrea-
tion facilities that it shares the President's 
view that "1966 can be the year of rebirth 
for American cities." It was beginning to 
demonstrate before the Presidential program 
was outlined that it meets its requirements 
of being one of "those cities who help them-
selves" and where there is "a serious commit-
ment to the project on the part of local * * * 
authorities." 
2. Gary, through its long use of federally 
assisted housing programs, has, as the Presi-
dent said, "built a platform" from which 
further experimentation in development can 
be launched. It is preparing to launch its 
third urban renewal program, this one the 
largest undertaken here to date, having 
learned something of both "the strengths and 
weaknesses" through past experiences. 
3. Gary's City Council during the past year 
has formally adopted a previously promul-
gated metropolitan plan, sharing with the 
President the view that it "should be an in-
strument for shaping sound urban growth?
not a neglected document." 
4. Gary's City Council, with urging of civic 
leadership, adopted last year probably the 
most liberal open housing ordinance of any 
city in the Nation, exhibiting its realization 
of the presidential point that "at the center 
of the cities' housing problem lies racial dis-
crimination."

Juan* 1, 1966 
E. On the opposite side, not negative ex-
actly, but showing need-
1. Gary is the core of an industrial area 
where increasing steel and other production 
insures growth, but has reached the point 
where help is needed to make sure that "the 
powerful forces of urban growth" do not 
"overwhelm efforts to achieve orderly de-
velopment." 
2.. Gary is still beset with what the Presi-
dent terms "crowded miles of inadequate 
dwellings?poorly maintained, and fre-
quently overpriced" in which many of its 
Negroes still live. While twin attacks, 
through the housing ordinance and the new-
est urban renewal program, have been 
lieunched, help will be essential. 
3. Gary's mass transportation facilities 
are deteriorated and inadequate. Its major 
street system, cut up by railroads, Is unsuited 
to carrying the necessary load. Some plans 
have been drafted, but a coordinated effort, 
preferably with Federal help, is needed. 
4. Gary's parks, once a point of civic pride, 
and its indoor cultural and recreational fa-
cilities have been outgrown or become out-
moded. Assistance is needed in pushing 
through plans already under consideration 
for meeting these needs both for the present 
and the anticipated population. 
5. Gary's "one industry" image Is grad-
ually being altered, but making it one of the 
major "demonstration cities" could step up 
the program of intended diversification which 
could help make it a better city for all its 
people in the future. 
It is anticipated that as the broad outlines 
of the President's proposals are solidified 
into legislation, Gary governmental and civic 
effort will combine to furnish detailed evi-
dence of how Gary meets the specific 
guidelines he seeks to establish. 
Meanwhile, we feel it our duty to make 
this advance nomination of' Gary as one of 
the demonstration cities hoping it may be-
come one of those "great urban areas" which, 
T1.3 the President, says, can become "the mas-
terpieces of our eiviliRation."

Mr. JORDAN of North Carolina. Mr. 
President, for over 30 years, in a succes-

guished himself by successfully tackling 
difficult assignments in the public sei'v-

An article by Burt Schorr in the Febru-
ary 28 issue of the Wall Street Journal 
recognizes the excellent job that Charles 
Li. Murphy is doing as Chairman of the 
Civil Aeronautics Board. I request 
unanimous consent that this article be 
printed in the body of the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
R.; follows:

PHY NUDGES CARRIERS TOWARD THAT GOAT. 
(liy Burt Schorr) 
WASHINGTON. -Tr may take some months 
to measure the success of the Civil Aero-
ninnies Board's policy statement recently 
ill mod at reducing air travel costs. 
As the Board hoped, the other domestic 
trunielines appear to be matching United 
Air Lines' proposed 25-percent excursion fere 
discount, But there's always the possibil-
ity that these reductions won't achieve the 
goal of lowering fares without hurting he 
carriers' ability to finance their big orders 
rel. a ow aircraft. New air travelers may not 
be lured into otherwise empty seats in num-
bers sufficient to compensate airlines for the 
revenues they stand to lose. 
Yet even if such an eventuality demands 
further fare tinkering by the CAB,- the ex-
cursion plan already makes this point clear: 
Under its new Chairman, Charles S. Murphy, 
the CAB has demonstrated an ability to move 
carriers further along the path to lower fares 
than they would have ventured on their own. 
And in accomplishing this, the Board seems 
to have ruffled fewer carriers feathers than 
might hove seemed possible or ly a few, 
months a,eo. 
Moreover, this maintenance of cordial re-
lations 'between the CAB and the airlines 
places the Board in a good position to seek 
more bargelin flying for the public when 
It deals with several important route assign-
ments now pending, including new service 
between southwestern and northwestern 
points. 
Finally, the energetic attack on the fare 
problem-- a potentially controversial issue 
as airline profits soar through tae second 
year of the air travel boom?appeers to have 
quashed any congressional craiiiism that 
the CAB isn't performing its assigned regu-
latory function. During an earlier period 
of carrier prosperity in the 1950'8, Capitol 
Mu censure caused a marked stiffening of 
CAB fare policies, with unpleasant conse-
quences for airlines. 
Board watchers are inclined to credit the 
CAB's ado 'it fare maneuvering to the helms-
inanship of Chairman Murphy, wlyi took his 
post last June. 1. Undoubtedly Mr. Mur-
phy's effectiveness has been enhanced by 
Washington's knowledge that he enjoys the 
esteem or President Johnson. The Chief 
Executive's personal interest in air fares 
hasn't been publicized, but in fent he has 
followed the, subject attentively. What Mr. 
Johnson Leportedly was anxious to have?
and what Mr. Murphy seems to be deliver-
ing?is a CAB fare policy designed to reduce 
travel costs without crippling the airlines' 
ability to ray for the $4.3 billion in new air-
craft they will put in service between now 
and 1970. 
ON; EXPERIENCE IN GOVERNIVILTIT 
(i7k a Gevernment career dating back to 
1934, Mr. Murphy is considered wise in the 
workings of the Federal bureaucracy as it 
operates tinder the Democratic Perty. For 
1.1 years he was assistant legislative counsel 
to the S( nete. (One job there: Helping 
draft the Civil Aeronautics Act of 1938 
which created the CAB.) From tint post, he 
moved to the White House, advencing in 
1950 to a key job as special counsel to Presi-
dent Truman. Immediately prior to his CAB 
ap poi n tme n t. by President Johnson, Mr. 
Murphy SA7 R.e. serving as Tinder Secretary of 
Agriculture. 
"Murphy knows how to get thin iT,S; done," 
comments one industry representetive who 
deals :frequently with the Board. "His back-
ground in writing the Aviation Act, his Sen-
ate and Waite House jobs, and the backing 
of the Proficient give him prestige the rest 
of the Board can't ignore." 
Mr. Murphy's Influence was evident in, for 
example, tOe Board's recent 3 to 2 decision 
endorsing Frontier Airlines' 90-dag experi-
mental offer of a general 50-percent discount 
for standby seats on certain lightte patron-
ized flights. Other carriers, including United 
and Western Air Lines, hied vehem intly op-
posed the innovation, but the Chairman, 
supported by his two fellow Democrats, 
Robert T. Murphy and Cl. Joseph Tvlinetti, 
agreed witn the Denver-based locitl service 
airline that "the only way to test The fares 
is by actual experience." What wasn't made 
public, however, was how one of the sup-
porting Democrats almost joined Republi-
cans Whithey Ctillilland and John G, Adams 
in voting "no," then reconsidered out of a 
desire to "cooperate" with the new Chairman. 
The Chairman's hand was apparent last 
July, too, when the Board rejected a 3-per-
cent fare increase proposed by United to off-
set a bigger baggage allowance. At the time, 
United, Eastern Air Lines, and several other 
carriers were still earning well below the 
CAB standard for a reasonable rate of return 
on invested capital. Nevertheleai, guided 
by its new Chairman, the Board held that the 
"favorable earnings" of the carriers provided 
"an excellent opportunity for reductions in 
fares, or improvements in service without 
fare increases." 
The Board's fare campaign intensified in 
the following month with the first in a 
series of hold-the-line orders suspending 
proposed new jet fares. Here the Board 
broke with the long-accepted practice of al-
lowing jet fares to include a surcharge that 
pegged them about 10-percent higher than 
propeller fares on the same routes. Here-
after, the Board said, it would allow new jet 
service at propeller rates only. 
The airlines were dismayed at the threat-
ened revenue loss?up to $200 million an-
nually by one reckoning. There was much 
grumbling, too, that carriers fortunate 
enough to have already filed fares for most 
of their shorter-range jet service were barely 
affected by the surcharge ban. Summing up 
industry frustrations, United Chairman W. 
A. Patterson fumed about "a very impetuous 
conclusion reached very hastily." 
It wasn't until this month's policy state-
ment that the CAB finally assured the car-
riers it would be willing to allow jet sur-
charges after all; United, and any other car-
riers filing reductions comparable to the 25 
percent excursion fare discount, eineld re-
sume setting jet ticket charges higher than 
propeller fares. 
Actually, CAB insiders maintain, the 
Board had this in mind all along. "The sur-
charge issue merely happened to be the first 
fare question to come along," explains one. 
"By issuing the suspension orders, the Board 
had time to think over the fare Lieue and 
also force carriers to come up with counter-
proposals." 
CONVINCING THE CARRIERS 
It developed, though, that counterpro-
posals were slciw in coming. So, in a series 
of speeches and private discussions with air-
line executives, Mr. Murphy sought to con-
vince the carriers that the Board wiisn't out 
to wreck them. This kept lines open be-
tween Government and industry cleopite ris-
ing tensions in Wall Street and aisline ex-
ecutive cffices over what sort of fare policy 
the CAB eventually would settle on 
Thus, shortly before the Board's definitive 
statement, one Washington-based airline 
vice president was pleased to find Chairman 
Murphy demonstrating "a very enlightened 
and progressive attitude. Rather than aim-
ing to reduce airline earnings, he and the 
Board say carriers should pass along to the 
public the benefits of improved air tech-
nology ? ? When you get clown to it, the 
carriers have the same objectives." 
The recent rash of youth-fare discounts, 
allowing 50 percent off on stancley seats, 
were another sign that airlines were begin-
ning to attune themselves to broad thinking. 
Then came January's fruitful /limiting of 
representatives of the 11 domestic trunklines 
to discuss alternatives to the surcharge ban. 
United first broached its plan at title Wash-
ington conference. "Everybody :recognized 
that the Board has a problem with carrier 
earnings," says one executive of an extremely 
profitable airline who participated. "And 
the industry accepted the challenge of deal-
ing with it." 
The Board's success so far contrasts mark-
edly with CAB handling of the fare question 
back in the early 1950's, a period when the 
airline industry also was enjoying a boom_ 
Early in 1952, the domestic trunklines 
sought to add $1 to all one-way domestic 
ticket charges and eliminate a 5-percent

guideposts have serious drawbacks. First, 
it is not excessive profits but the visibility 
of these profits which the guideposts fear 
will lead to inflationary wage demands. And 
since the accumulation of profits or the 
failure to cut prices can never be as visible 
as wage demands made during controversial 
contract negotiations, the burden of public 
pressure is always on labor. 
Second, the wage-price guideposts are 
presented as though they derive from "nat-
ural" and impartial economic criteria, when 
in fact they mask very important political 
judgments about the kind of society Amer-
ica will be. Implicit in the guideposts is the 
assumption that the proportions of America's 
wealth enjoyed by various sectors of the 
population should remain constant. Since 
the share of the gross national product 
which goes to the wealthiest 20 percent of 
Americans is about 10 times that going to 
the poorest 20 percent, we cannot agree that 
this assumption is in accord with justice. 
The wage-price guideposts could be a step 
to a more rational, democratic system of 
economic planning, in which social as well 
as economic criteria played a part. But if 
they merely to become guarantees for Gen-
eral Motors' prosperity, then labor's rev lt 
is fully justified. 
THE ROLE OF THE VIETCONG 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, 2 weeks 
ago, I urged the President to openly 
acknowledge a central fact in the Viet-
nam struggle, the political-military fact 
that the Vietcong should be accorded an 
independent status at the future peace 
conference. I also argued that it would 
be detrimental to our own purposes and 
to the stability and morale of the South 
Vietnamese if any further concessions 
were made to the Vietcong at this time. 
Specifically, I argued against giving the 
Vietcong a role in a coalition govern-
ment before negotiations and before free 
elections, but only as a result of negotia-
tions. Max Lerner, in two articles, sup-
ports my position on this issue, and also 
agrees with my view that the United 
States must announce that it will accept 
the results of a genuinely free election in 
Vietnam. 
I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD Mr. Lerner's ar-
ticles of February 21 and 23 which ap-
peared in the New York Post. 
There being no objection, the articles 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows:

VIETCONG ROLE 
(By Max Lerner) 
With the ending of the televised Fulbright 
hearings, the great debate on the Vietnam 
war has reached the end of its first phase in 
a dead heat. 
The Fulbright forces succeeded in showing 
that the war has moved by a succession of 
unanalyzed steps to unintended conse-
quences. There can be little doubt that the 
casualty lists hurt, that the war is unpopular 
and is likely to get more so and that the 
problem is not how America shall win but 
how America shall extricate itself without 
scuttling its Vietnamese allies and abdicat-
ing its national interests. 
The proadministration forces in turn 
have shown that no one knows how this can 
be done, least of all the Pulbright witnesses 
and the commentators like Lippmann on 
whose analysis they lean. When Gen. Max-
well Taylor and Dean Rusk got their innings, 
they may not have triumphed, but they 
didn't come of second best. Rusk made the 
legal case he was expected to make. But he 
was best on the psychological and political 
factors, as in his discussion of the historic 
Oxford Pledge in its bearing on British un-
preparedness in World War II, just as Taylor 
was best on the role of the French home-
front in the French defeat in the Indochina 
war. 
When the Fulbright forces, grasping for a 
straw in an effort to find an alternative mili-
tary strategy, plumped for the enclave 
theory, Taylor had little difficulty in show-
ing how frail a reed it was. It is hard to 
advocate an outright military withdrawal 
from Vietnam. But it doesn't solve anything 
to propose a policy that will abandon the 
Vietnam forces and villages to the Vietcong 
and strip the American soldier of both his 
mobility and his morale. The whole enclave 
theory is an attempt to dress up a military 
withdrawal in the guise of something less 
inglorious. 
That is the point at which Senator ROBERT 
KENNEDY came in with his proposal to give 
the Vietcong a share in whatever govern-
ment is set up in South Vietnam after 
peace negotiations. That is further than 
FULBRIGHT has gone, with his proposal that 
we recognize and deal directly with the 
Vietcong. 
The trouble with the Kennedy proposal is 
that it fails to distinguish between the Viet-
cong role the the negotiating table and the 
Vietcong role in the postwar Government of 
Vietnam. To recognize that the Vietcong 
must have a role at the negotiating table is 
crucial. To give them a role in the Govern-
ment of Vietnam would be fatal. 
?The current administration refusal to deal 
with the Vietcong is obviously an effort to 
shore up the position of the Ky regime in 
Saigon. But Ky, whose rigid refusal to sit 
at any negotiating table with the Vietcong 
is clearly for homefront consumption, has 
said he is a realist and is learning to be a 
politician. A realist learns to accept the in-
evitable. The inevitable is that the Vietcong, 
as a major combatant, must be at the nego-
tiating table. They insist on doing sosas the 
only legitimate government cif South Viet-
nam, which is impossible for us. America in-
sists on their coming to the table, if at all, 
as an instrument of Hanoi?which is impossi-
ble for them. Why not have them there in 
a third role, as representing neither Hanoi 
nor Saigon but only the actual territory they 
occupy and in fact administer? 
Neither Hanoi nor Peiping will agree to 
this straight off. Both are convinced the an-
tiwar forces in America will give them the 
political victory they want even though the 
Vietoong are suffering considerable punish-
ment and can have no hope for military vic-
tory. But if Johnson and Rusk are willing 
to have the Vietcong at the negotiating table 
as a third party, to represent the territory 
they actually hold, then Washington can offer 
Moscow a solution the Russians in the end 
can back up without sacrificing their role as 
Hanoi's champions. 
But there is no reason to sign away South 
Vietnam now by offering to include the Viet-
cong in the postwar government. The nature 
of the peace arrangements is something for 
the negotiating conference to decide. Any 
coalition formula which will include the Viet-
cong is bound to result in a Communist gov-
ernment that has excluded or liquidated its 
non-Communist partners. The experience of 
Poland and Czechoslovakia after the Yalta 
agreements is witness to what happens. 
One cannot exclude the possibility that the 
people of South Vietnam will want some day 
to vote in a Communist regime. But it ought 
not to be imposed on them by a peace treaty. 
In fairness to them, there should be a mora-
torium of perhaps 2 years, during which the 
economy and society of South Vietnam will 
have a chance to rebuild themselves with aid 
from American and other sources. A postwar 
government should have a chance to 
strengthen the political fiber of the nation 
and show the people what can be accom-
plished in peacetime. 
At the end of that period, the Vietnamese 
should have a chance to ratify or reject what 
such a regime has done and become. If at 
that time it chooses a coalition popular front 
or a straight Communist government, that 
will be its own concern. Neither Hanoi nor 
the Vietcong are today confident they would 
get the suffrage of the people. If they were 
confident, they would welcome the chance to 
come to the negotiating table and agree to 
such a solution. 
[From the New York Post, Feb. 23, 1966] 
THE KENNEDY TANGLE 
(By Max Lerner) 
The disarray surrounding Senator KEN-
NEDY'S proposal on the Vietcong peace role 
was partly due to the clumsiness of trying to 
stage a debate through press conferences and 
TV shows on one side and press secretaries 
on the other; this is where the British sys-
tem of straight parliamentary confrontation 
between the Government and its opponents 
would have served the Nation better. But 
partly also it was due to the fact that few 
public figures (and Senator KENNEDY is no 
exception) have had a chance to think their 
way through the touchy problems of a peace 
conference and what would follow it. Com-
pared with this the Vietnam jungle is a 
grove. 
Too much of the general Vietnam debate 
thus far has been on the strategy and politics 
of the war, not enough on what happens 
when the shooting stops. Senator KENNEDY 
had a hectic couple of days, backing and 
filling, in getting his position clear, and so 
did Maxwell Taylor; as for HUBERT 1-117M-
PHREY, his troubles may still lie ahead. A 
confused time was had by all, but out of it 
may come some unraveling of the tangle. 
I am not talking of the advertised agree-
ment between KENNEDY and the White 
House, subscribed to by both sides. On the 
crucial issues I doubt that there is any real 
agreement. 
Examining the peacemaking process phase 
by phase, the first concerns the way in Which 
the Vietcong will be represented at the con-
ference. Here KENNEDY does well to hold 
his ground. I agree with him that the Viet-
cong, simply because of the area they con-
trol, must be at the conference as "an inde-
pendent entity." 
The next phase has to do with the Viet-
cong role in a coalition government. KEN-
NEDY originally talked as if the "share of 
power and responsibility" for the Vietcong 
was something for America to back, and 
something to emerge?however gradually?
from the conference. He now talks more 
warily on both scores. He doesn't expect a 
coalition government to be shaped "auto-
matically," but wants the administration not 
to shut the door on it. Certainly this door, 
like any other door, should not be shut, But 
it still leaves the question of whether the 
Americans are to put their influence behind 
it. To say that America should accept a 
solution agreed upon by the conference is to 
omit the patent fact that the South Viet-
nam governmental delegation will oppose a 
coalition agreement bitterly. To get the 
agreement KENNEDY envisages will mean 
American pressure. 
Then there is the problem of elections. 
KENNEDY now seems to talk of a coalition 
government as including only "what they 
(the Vietcong) win in free elections." He 
also talks of a "permanent coalition" as a 
possibility, presumably without such elec-
tions. Such a "permanent coalition" would 
quickly eliminate the chances that free elec-
tions would ever be held. To prevent this, 
KENNEDY speaks of an international control 
authority to watch out for Communist at-

It was this lenieney that moved the Bruise 
Judiciary Committee, under Representative 
IOWAN-CB/, GELLER, Democrat, of New York, to 
include the CAB in an investigation of several 
regulatory agencies 3 years later, By this 
time, however, several changes in Board 
reembership (a term is 6 years) had pro-
duced a majority considered less friendly to 
carrier interests. Stung by CELLER committee 
complaints that the Board had. "waltzed 
around" the fare question and was guilty 
et "scandalous abdication. of responsibility," 
the CAB hastened to atone by ordering the 
prompt start of a general fare investigation.

as the investigation was getting underway;

sisted until sagging, return on investment, 
which reached a low of 1.5 percent in 1961, 
cenfronted the Board with the prospect that 
airlines might not be able to pay for the 
'toed of new jets they'd ordered some years 
earlier, and it agreed to a series of fare in-
creases. 
Perhaps the expanded use of promotional 
fares like the ones the Board now is en-
enraging might have filled many of the 
empty seats of the early 'I960's. This in 
turn could have reduced the need for higher 
fares and kept air travel available to the 
broadest possible segment of the population.

THE FULBRIGHT PROGRAM: A 
HISTOR,Y 
Mr. PULBRIGHT. Mr. President, I 
wish to call attention to a recent book by 
Walter Johnson and Francis J. Coliigan 
entitled "The F'ulbright Program: A 
History." 
Walter Johnson is Preston and Eterl-
frig Morton professor of history a:. the 
University of CE:cag-o. He has bc(:n a 
member of the Board of Foreign Scholar-
ships since 1947 and has provided con-
tinuity and leadership in promoting 
educational exchange programs. From 
1950 to 1953, he served as chairrar2n. of 
the Board of Foreign Schoilnrships. 
Francis J. Colligan is Director of Policy 
P.eview and Coordination fel: the Bureau 
of Education and Cultural Affairs at the 
DL:partment of State. Mr. Colligan has 
also been associated with the exchange 
program since 1947 and during the years 
from 1948 until 1957 he was executive 
secretary of the program. 
Both Walter Johnson and Francis 
Colligan have done a tray remark able 
job in describing the postwar develop-
ment of U.S. exchange programs. They 
have been ablo to do this because they 
have been active participants. At. the 
same time, their participation has not 
destroyed their critical faculties and the 
book which they have produced is, I be-
lieve, a fair treatment of the successes 
and the failures of what has become 
known as tile Fulbright program. I am 
glad to note for the record that the silo-
ceases have far outnumbered and out-
weighed the failures. Members of the 
Senate I know receive many communica-
tions from. then: constituents requesting 
information about the availability of 
Fulbright grants and other questi inS 
regarding the .orogram. This study by 
Messrs. Johnson and Colligan will be 
helpful not only to Members in answer-
ing inquiries but to individuals and in-
.stitutions in the United States that have 
been involved in the program. 
As author of the original legislation in 
this field, which was in the nature of an 
amendment to the Surplus Property Act 
of 1944, I wish to take this occasion to 
say that the program could never hove 
succeeded had Lt not been for the hued 
work and perseverance and support of 
men like Walter Johnson arid Francis 
Colligan, Throughout 20 years of this 
program, they have been aided by ma ly 
other people in the academic and latui-
neSS community too numerous tt me ..i-
tion. Any program can fail if it is not 
properly administered and supported lay 
tile American public. This program, I 
am glad to say, has had this support. 
THE PRESIDENT'S WAGE-PRICE 
GUIDEPOSTS 
Mr. HART, Mr.. President, for the 
past several months, considerable dis.-
cussion has been devoted to the validity 
of the administration's wage-Price 
guideposts and their effectiveness as a 
tool of economic policy. 
4177 
Implicit in this debate is the reog--
nition by those--in favor and opposed 
to these guidelines?that sound planning 
is necessary to assure the steady, con-
tinued growth of the Nation's economy--
without inflation. 
The longrun best interest of the coun-
try is not served by either rising prices 
or wages. Both business and labor are 
well aware of the benefits that have 
accrued to them as a result of the econ-
ozny's current, and unprecedented, pe-
riod of prosperity?benefits in the fonn 
of increased profits and nearly Full 
employment. 
And, though both business and lshrr 
have said?albeit for different reasons--
that the present guidelines are um cal-
istic, clearly each of them recognizes ,it 
some guarantee of a stable economy is 
needed. 
In understanding both viewpoints, an 
article in the February 18 issue of ?lie 
Commonweal should be considered as 
part of this discussion on economic 
policy. 
Mr. President I ask unanimous ecti-
sent that the magazine article to which 
I refer be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECOae, 
as follows: 
LABOR'S JUST COMPLAINT 
The labor unions have begun to complain 
about the President's wage-price guidepost'.?
and well they might. The best possible evi-
dence for their argument has now been sup-
plied by an unexpected source: General rAto-
tors Corp. All General Motors did was tell 
the world how much money it made in lifJC:s; 
and labor's case was matte. 
The wage-price guideposts are based on 
the theory that wage increases must be tied 
to the increase in overall national productiv-
ity, so that demand does not outstrip supp'y, 
causing price rises and inflation. But wage 
demands are obviously related to corporative 
profits; and so- the guideposts proposed that 
increase in profits be likewise limited by the 
rate of increase in national productivil y. 
When profits are rising faster than produe-
tivity, the excess should be returned to 
the public in the form of price cuts, let 
workers have grounds for inflationary weer) 
demands. 
A few spectacular cases of pressure from 
the Government have generally convinced lIe 
public that the guideposts have been more 
severely enforced against business than labor. 
But these few cases involved industries whefe 
prices were being raised. Totally ignored has 
been the obligation of industries with rid rag 
profits to cut prices. The results? Through-
out 19(35, labor unions were urged to limit 
their demands to a 3.2-percent increase in 
wages (in keeping with the 3.2 percent an-
nual Increase in national productivity . 
And, in fact, labor gains did stay between 3 
and 4 percent. But meanwhile corporations 
enjoyed a 20-percent increase in profits. 
Now General Motors, the Nation's largest 
company, reveals it has done even better. It; 
profits after taxes in 1065 jumped by 23 per-
cent. In 1984, screams of anguish went up 
when the United Auto Workers obtained A 
contract from General Motors which went 
only slightly beyond the wage-price guide 
posts. Who's complaining now? 
The wage-price guideposts have merits. 
Their existence is an admission of the need 
for national economic planning. But the

tempts at seizing the government. But this 
would end with no effective government at 
all, from which only a totalitarian group 
could benefit, whether Communist or mili-
tary. 
We need to clear up the question of when 
the elections ought to come if they are best 
to serve the interests of a stable and demo-
cratic Vietnam. KENNEDY speaks of free 
elections to settle the "immediate composi-
tion" of the government. That is too soon, 
as anyone must know who understands the 
political immaturity of the southeast Asia 
area and the chaos that war has wrought. 
They should come after a waiting period to 
give a government, whether of one party or 
a coalition, a chance for stability. And lest 
the government-in-power rig the elections, 
this is where an international control com-
mission should function: in making sure the 
elections are honest, and the votes honestly 
counted. 
I am glad KENNEDY opened the floodgate 
on these themes. But the KENNEDY name is 
so important in world opinion that he would 
have done better to wait until he was clearly 
ready. 
SCHOOL MILIC AND LUNCH PRO-
GRAMS SHOULD NOT BE CUT 
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I have 
received a large number of telegrams, 
calls and letters urging me to do every-
thing possible to restore the proposed 
cuts in appropriations for the special 
school milk and school lunch programs. 
There are many places where the 
budget can, and should, be cut this ses-
sion but these are not among them. Both 
of these programs have had widespread 
support over the years, both in Wiscon-
sin and across the country. They have 
been built up over many years through 
cooperative arrangements with the 
States. 
These programs are important to the 
dairy industry and they are important 
to the health of our schoolchildren. 
I have received a large number of let-
ters from school administrators, school-
children, dairy farmers, cooperatives and 
others. I ask unanimous consent that a 
representative sample be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the letters 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
AMERICAN SCHOOL FOOD 
SERVICE ASSOCIATION, 
Madison., Wis., February 18, 1966. 
Hon. GAYLORD NELSON, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR NELSON: I wish to thank 
you again for the generous time you gave to 
me and Mr. Langkop when we visited with 
you recently. We are very much concerned 
over the administration's budget proposals 
for the school lunch and special milk pro-
grams for 1966-67 and were very grateful 
for an opportunity to visit with you concern-
ing the matter. 
I am sending to you herewith a copy of a 
bulletin which I have requested the Ameri-
can School Food Service Association to issue 
to State directors of school lunch programs, 
State presidents of school food service asso-
ciations, and State legislative chairmen con-
cerning the administration's budget pro-
posals for the school lunch and special milk 
programs for 1966-67. I want to keep you 
as fully informed as I possibly can, since I 
am sure you will be receiving inquiries and 
letters from many people in Wisconsin, and 
It may also be helpful to you to get our 
side of the picture when the budget comes 
up for consideration in hearings and on the 
Senate floor. 
I believe the material I am sending to you 
is quite self-explanatory, but I should like 
to add some further explanation as to what 
the program might look like in Wisconsin if 
the President's budget proposals were to be-
come effective. 
There are now only 6 school districts of 
grades kindergarten through 12 or 9 through 
12 which do not have the school lunch pro-
gram in Wisconsin. There are, of course, a 
number of small rural districts operating 
one-room or two-room schools which do not 
have a lunch program since building facilities 
would not permit. Thus you can see that 
the program has been quite universally ac-
cepted and incorporated into the daily 
school activities in nearly all. of the schools 
of the State. 
There are 105 school districts involving 151 
schools with an average daily attendance of 
24,009 pupils which have a milk program 
only. In September these schools served 
345,008 half pints of milk; in October, 452,-
541, and in November 379,654. The reim-
bursement from Federal funds in November, 
for example, was $10,187. 
There are 467 school districts involving 
2,511 schools which have both the school 
lunch and special milk programs. The aver-
age daily attendance in these schools is 644,-
488 pupils. In September these schools 
served 7,660,488 half pints of milk; in Octo-
ber, 8,830,621; and in November, 7,494,993. 
The reimbursement from Federal funds in 
November amounted to $276,395. In these 
schools the children also had the benefit of 
a balanced noon meal which included a half 
pint of milk. The figures given you above 
are concerned only with the extra milk which 
was consumed in these schools during recess, 
milk breaks, or additional milk with the 
noon lunch. In September these schools 
served 6,011,450 lunches with milk; in Octo-
ber, 6,161,321; and in November, 5,310,818. 
Therefore, in November, for example, there 
were 12,805,811 half pints of milk consumed 
In these schools in addition to other dairy 
products which were served as a part of the 
meal. 
The point I am trying to make is that the 
special milk program would virtually be dead 
if it were limited to schools which do not 
have a lunch service. 
Although the chart shows a net reduction 
of $19 million in the budget for the school 
lunch program (approximately 10 percent of 
this year's appropriation) the situation is 
actually worse than it appears. Section 11 
funds are used in granting high reimburse-
ment rates to schools in especially needy 
areas. The funds appropriated for this sec-
tion are apportioned among the States pri-
marily on the basis of need for serving 
lunches free of charge to children who can-
not afford to pay. From a national stand-
point the $6.5 million budget is but a token 
of what would be required if the need were 
to be met. The city of Chicago alone would 
require the total appropriation. Conse-
quently, the funds appropriated for the cur-
rent year ($2 million) were apportioned 
among the States to start experimental pro-
grams to determine what effect a high re-
imbursement rate and a reduced price to 
children might have on participation, num-
ber of free lunches required, etc. Wisconsin 
got $11,700. We were able to start four small 
projects beginning in February?one in West-
boro; one in Pine Lake, near Rhinelander; 
one at Neopit and one in Keshena. Thus you 
can see that the $4.5 million increase in the 
budget for such purposes will have but little 
bearing on the program as a whole. 
Appropriated funds available for reim-
bursement and section 6 commodities for 
the current year total $152,915,000 (not in-
cluding the $45 milliop transfer from sec-
tion 32 funds for this purpose). Appropri-
ated funds for identical purposes next year 
Would be $129,115,000. Thus there is actu-
ally a reduction of funds for the regular 
program of 15.4 percent and not 10 percent 
as it would appear on the surface. 
Along with the 15.4 percent reduction in 
funds, it is quite evident that surplus com-
modities will not be available in the kinds 
and quantities we have had in the past. 
Several valuable items have disappeared 
from the surplus list. We have received only 
202,173 pounds of cheese for schools this 
year. Last year we used 821,770 pounds. 
There are virtually no Government pur-
chases being made for price support pur-
poses. Butter has reached the same posi-
tion. Section 70 of the Agricultural Act of 
1965 authorizes ie Secretary of Agriculture 
to go out on t e market and buy butter, 
cheese, and powdered milk in any quantity 
needed to fulfill requirements of the pro-
gram regardless of price or surplus situation, 
but he has not done so until February 10 
when he announced he would buy a limited 
quantity of butter to meet the needs of the 
school lunch program. He made no offer to 
buy cheese, however. 
If the administrations proposals prevail, 
It will mean an increase of perhaps 5 cents 
per lunch in charges to children. Children 
attending schools where there is a lunch pro-
gram would be required to pay the full cost 
of the milk, unless the district were to sub-
sidize it somehow. There would be no milk 
reimbursement for such schools, excepting 
for the milk served to needy children who 
would be unable to pay. This would be an 
inconsequential amount, I'm sure. 
Schools which have a lunch program are 
now being reimbursed at the rate of 4 cents 
per half pint of extra milk served, and the 
schools which do not have a lunch service 
are paid 3 cents per half pint. All schools 
are paid a uniform rate of 4 cents per lunch 
with milk. No reimbursement is paid for 
lunches served without milk. 
This letter has grown somewhat lengthy 
and I apologize for it. Anything you can do 
In behalf of adequately funding both pro-
grams in the coming fiscal year will be very 
much appreciated.

GORDON W. GUNDERSON, 
Chairman, Legislative Committee, ASFSA. 
MILK INDUSTRY FOUNDATION, 
Washington., D.C., February 11, 1966. 
Senator GAYLORD NELSON, 
Senate Office Building, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR NELSON: We Solicit your 
support for continuance of the special milk 
program which in fiscal year 1965 was used 
by 92,005 schools and child care institutions 
where 2,966,800,000 half pints of milk were 
consumed. By comparison, 70,132 schools 
participated in the national school lunch 
program and used 2,876,150,103 half pints of 
milk in fiscal 1965. 
This usage of milk aggregated nearly 3 bil-
lion pounds. Had this milk not been so 
used, there can be little doubt that it would 
have been acquired by the Commodity Credit 
Corporation in the form of nonfat dry milk, 
butter, and cheese since approximately 5.7 
billion pounds on a milk equivalent basis 
was actually acquired. The direct cost at 
the present support price would have been 
$103 million, the exact amount Congress ap-
propriated for the special milk program for 
fiscal 1966. In addition, there would have 
been the cost of acquiring, handling, packag-
ing, and transporting the products which 
would have been made from the 3 billion 
pounds of milk used in the school lunch and 
school milk programs. 
While commercial consumption has shown 
a gain during the past year and some further 
gain is expected this year, it now appears that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE March 1, 1966 
an estimated :3 to 4 billion pounds of milk in 
the form of nonfat dry milk, butter, and 
cheese will be acquired under the price sup-
port program in 1966. 
In the light of these circumstances it 
makes extremely good sense to continue the 
apecial milk program. Nearly 22,000 more 
schools and child care institutions use this 
program than use the school lunch program. 
More children are benefited by having a 
nutritious energy-giving food in the form of 
milk. 
At a time when our Government is spend-
ing millions of dollars to rehabilitate school 
dropouts, is enlarging the food stamp pro-
gram and carrying on a war against poverty, 
it ,s inconsistent to curtail a program that 
adds to the health, energy, and vitality of 
children who are in school and thereby helps 
them to stay in school. This is especially 
trot, with respect to the 22,000 schools and 
institutions which, because of lack of facili-
ties, funds or for other reasons do not have 
a school lunch program. 
We of the Milk Industry Foundation, a 
trade association of milk processors having 
mombers doing business in every State of the 
Nation, including, of course, your State, 
respectfully request your help in maintaining 
the Special Milk Program at a level where all 
schools and child institutions wishing to 
pacticipate may do so.

TRU'. GAYLORD NELSON, 
Senate Office 
Washington, D.C. 
! WAR SENATOR NELSON: The proposal in 
Federal budget and in the Congress to 
cut back in the the appropriation for the 
special milk program in schools and to as-
sign the administration of the fund to the 
Department of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare instead of the Department of Agricul-
ture has come to my attention. My per-
sonal feeling about this proposal, and its 
tie-in effect with ether programs, are ex-
pressed as that of a parent, a taxpayer, and 
a school administrator. 
1. Since the milk purchased by the re-
duced appropriation is to be distributed to 
needy children, there is an obvious tie-in 
with programing under the Education Act 
of 1965. 
'e School lunch and special mik programs 
have stood for years as evidence that a fed-
erally aided program can do an effective job 
with a minirnum of Government interfer-
ence. 
I. The Education Act of 1965 is becoming 
a monument of regulation, detail, restriction 
iind administrative putter work. What was 
promoted as a first time opportunity for 
education innovation on a national scale 
has become restrictive to a point that pro-
graming is going to evolve into a number of 
ricatly wrapped educational packages. In-
novation, as I understand the implication of 
the term, will not happen. 
.1. Any remote tie-in of the milk or lunch 
program to the restrictiveness of Public Law 
89-10 will tend to render that program In-
c! let:teal. 
O. To spend billions in an emotion-
packed great-experiment program and at the 
same time cut back in a program that has 
proved itself nutritionally, educationally, 
and economically sound for years, would be 
difficult to defend, I'm sure. 
Your serious effort to restore the fund-
ing for the milk program to its original 
strength, and retain the administration of 
the program to the Department of Agricul-
ture, will, I'm sure, receive the enthusiastic 
support and imdorsement of your constitu-
ents.

Washingt on?O.C. 
DEAR SENATOR NELSON: The Wisconsin 
Council of Agricultural Cooperatives strongly 
protests the proposed unprecedented 1967 
budget out of $82 million for the special 
milk program for schoolchildren. We urge 
that the special milk program budgets be 
restored to $H03 million, the current appro-
priation; preferably funds for this program 
should be authorized at $115 millern. 
The proposed reduction of $19 million in 
the school lunch program should also be 
restored by Congress. 
A reduction of the size proposed is tanta-
mount to complete elimination of the special 
milk program. Complete elimination would 
divert about 1.5 billion pounds of milk now 
consumed as fluid milk into manufactured 
dairy products. 
USDA reports indicate the price for milk 
eligible for fluid consumption was $4.63 per 
hundredweight in 1965, compared to $3.33 
for milk used for manufacturing. The dif-
ference in the two prices is $1,30 per hun-
dredweight. The 1.5 billion pounds of milk 
times $1 30 per hundredweight would mean 
a loss of $19.5 million Li dairy farmers' pur-
chasing power. 
The special milk program is one of our 
moss effective vehicles for insuring good eat-
ing habis and at the same time improving 
diets of all children. Certainly this impor-
tant aspect of the program should not be 
based on ability to pay. 
Does the administration realize how much 
milk consumption in schools will decline 
if the cost per half pint is increased? A 
study in Chicago schools revealed that an 
increase of 1 cent per half pint on white 
milk and chocolate milk reduced consump-
tion by 10 percent,. This fact alone should 
give cause for serious reconsideration of the 
proposed action. 
We urgently request that you do your 
utmost to combat efforts to reduce the spe-
cial milk program appropriations. The pro-
gram, as we know it, has the support of not 
only dairy farmers but the general public 
es well. Our younger generation would be 
dealt a disservice by the U.S. Congress if ap-
propriations for this program are dropped 
below the current level.

AUTO SAFETY 
Mr. KENNEDY of New York. Mr. 
President, :I ask unanimous consent to 
have printed in the RECORD a brief on 
auto safety prepared by the Honorable 
Howard Grafftey, Member of Parliament 
of Canada, Mr. C.. Alexander Brown, and 
Mr. Rheal Casavant, also of Canada, for 
consideration by the Federal Government 
of Canada. 
This brief concerns the rising accident 
and death toll resulting :from auto 
crashes in Canada. Although we usually 
think of auto safety in the American con-
text, Canadians also use many cars de-
signed in the United States. It is only 
natural for Canadians to be concerned 
with the safety of American automobiles. 
I call to the attention of my associates 
the material prepared by Messrs. Graff-
tey, Brown, and Casavant. It is perti-
nent to our problems with auto safety. 
There being no objection, the brief 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows:

Significant new developments in the un-
derstanding of the complex casualty of 
motor vehicle fatalities and injuries have 
prompted us to set dOwn our knowledge and 
understanding of this problem, together with 
three recommendations for remedial action

presentation to the Prime Minister of Can-
ada, the Minister of National Health isod 
Welfare, the Minister of Justice, the Minister 
of Trade and Commerce and Moister of

BRIEF ON AUTOMOBILE SAFE'.'Y 
In the past 10 years 35,031 people have 
been killed in automobile accidents in Can-
ada, and 948,850 injured. It is estimated 
that by the end of 1965, 4,800 more will die 
and 150,000 will be injured. If the present 
trend continues between the beginning of 
1966 and the end of 1970, 26,000 more Ca-
nadians will die on our roads and more than 
1 million more will be injured. 
Accidents are now one of the leading causes 
of death and injury in this, as in many other 
countries. It is estimated that about half 
of all cars in North America between the 
time they are first driven and the time they 
are scrapped become involved in at least 
one injury-producing accident. 
To the present time nearly all efforts to 
correct this situation have been directed at 
drivers. In spite of this, the toll of death 
and injury, continues to increase and there 
is absolutely no evidence to indicate that 
to continue to expend most of our efforts in 
educating, cajoling, and penalizing the 
driver will yield adequate results. The prob-
lem of highway death and injury must be 
attached in other areas. In modern times, 
the techniques of epidemiology have been 
successfully "extended from its original re-
striction to the communicable diseases to a 
broad application of mass diseases of man; 
to cancer, diabetes, congenital anomalies and 
many others. It is not so generally appre-
ciated that injuries, as distinguished from 
diseases, are equally susceptible to this ap-
proach, and that accidents as a health prob-
lem of populations conform to the same 
biological laws as do disease processes and 
regularly evidence comparable behavior." 
Epidemiological approach 
Applying the terminology of epidemiology 
to automobile accidents, the roads are the 
environment, the driver is the host, and au-
tomobiles are the agents. Drivers (the host 
in our terms) are susceptible to human er-
ror. Therefore, there will always be acci-

on insurance regulation in 1964 while insur-
ance companies paid the States $737.6 
million. 
DISTRICT SIXTH HIGHEST 
The States that spent the least, in relation 
to their income from the insurance industry, 
were in order, Mississippi, Ohio, Oklahoma, 
Missouri, Idaho, Michigan, Connecticut and 
Minnesota. None budgeted more than 2.15 
cents of the insurance tax dollar for insur-
ance regulation. 
The District of Columbia, which budgeted 
6.24 cents, ranked sixth highest. Maryland 
and Virginia, which spent about 3 cents each, 
ranked 33d and 34th, respectively. 
States without any examiners at all, ac-
cording to the subcommittee's survey, were 
Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, 
Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and West 
Virginia. Yet Arizona and Mississippi alone 
had the prime responsibility for checking on 
the financial stability of 404 insurance com-
panies chartered in their States. 
New Hampshire and Vermont had only one 
examiner each; Maine and Montana, two; 
Oregon and Wyoming, three. 
NINE EXAMINERS HERE 
The District of Columbia, with 50 com-
panies chartered here and another 630 doing 
business, had 9 examiners. Virginia had 
10 examiners for 846 companies, 95 of them 
homegrown. Maryland, with 57 companies 
chartered in the State and another 752 in 
business there, had 12 examiners. 
New York had 342 examiners for 736 com-
panies. 
"No State insurance department, none of 
the 50 States, is going to be any stronger 
than the weakest examiner they have on 
their payroll," one witness testified before 
the subcommittee. 
In some of the States that have no insur-
ance examiners of their own, private ac-
counting firms are hired to make the checks. 
DODD said he had no illusions about getting 
a perfect system of insurance regulation. 
But, he said, "what we are getting now is 
not even within shouting distance of this 
ideal."

THREAT OF NEW FEDERAL CONTROLS Is 
RAISED?SENATOR DODD URGES STATES To 
ACT IMMEDIATELY 
(By Alexander Picone) 
A short while back we allowed as how the 
substandard risk automobile insurance mar-
ket, a relatively insignificant segment of the 
business, could turn out to be the "Achilles 
heel" of State regulation, unless the com-
panies and the State regulatory authorities 
pay more attention than has been given to 
date to the cleansing of this obviously un-
pleasant fringe of the business. It is a full-
blown threat as of now. 
Since 1960, some 58 high-risk auto Insur-
ance companies went under leaving over a 
million persons without insurance. This, 
plus other developments, has provided am-
munition for those who would prefer 
stronger Federal supervision of the business, 
if not complete takeover by repeal of the 
McCarran Act. 
STRONG EFFORT 
It is useless to go on carping and edito-
rializing, but sincere executives must make 
every effort?and do it now?to prevent even 
the smallest black mark from spotting the 
Image of effective State regulation. 
Perhaps, there are some insurance execu-
tives among us who do not want State regu-
lation to continue. If this view is widely 
shared by people within the industry then 
efforts should be started to determine where 
such defections exist. 
The Senate Judiciary Antitrust Subcom-
mittee, of which Senator THOMAS J. Dom), 
Democrat, of Connecticut, is chairman, has 
the continuing responsibility of studying 
the effectiveness of the system of State 
regulation of insurance. 
In a speech last reek on the floor of the 
U.S. Senate. Mr. DODD, who has been called 
the congressional watchdog of the insurance 
business, revealed that nearly 1 of every 10 
high-risk auto insurance companies had 
failed in the last 2 years, leaving more than 
half a million persons without protection. 
He said the situation was appalling and added 
that it may be time for the Federal Govern-
ment to pass legislation unless the States 
take immediate and sufficient action. The 
words "immediate" and "sufficient" should be 
underlined. And, any action taken on a 
State level would be futile unless the com-
panies cooperated fully and wholeheartedly. 
POINT STRESSED 
The Senator from Connecticut also 
stressed a point which should, by now, be im-
printed on the minds of all insurance people. 
,It is this: "The legislative history of the 
McCarran Act clearly indicates that 'Congress 
was making only a conditional delegation of 
authority to the States, to be reconsidered 
if the States should demonstrate an in-
ability to properly serve the public interest." 
The Senator was kind enough to stress the 
excellent record of some State insurance de-
partments and to assert his personal support 
of State regulation as best suited for supervi-
sion of the insurance industry "because it is 
at the level most aware of the local and 
regional needs of the consumer." The Sena-
tor, like most public figures, is subject to a 
multitude of pressures, political and other-
wise, and he may be forced to take steps that 
are contrary to his personal convictions. 
The bald fact, as the Senator sees it is that 
State regulation, in toto, is not adequately 
protecting the consumer, and at all costs, 
he must be protected. 
Mr. DODD, in his speech before the Senate, 
raised these questions, questions which every 
responsible person in the Insurance industry 
should be prepared to answer: 
"Can a form of regulation be adequate 
which allows virtually 9 percent of the high-
risk automobile insurance companies in the 
Nation to fail over a 2-year period, leaving 
considerably more than half a million per-
sons without insurance?" 
"Can a form of regulation be adequate 
which generally doesn't maintain examiners 
sufficient in number to carefully analyze the 
financial standing of thousands of insurance 
companies?" 
"Can a form of regulation be adequate in 
which at least six of the States have three 
or less examiners and at least nine States 
have no examiners at all?" 
"Can a form of regulation be adequate 
which is operated on a marginal budget of 
usually less than 4 percent of the premium 
taxes and fees collected from insurance com-
panies by the States?" 
FEDERAL CONTAOL 
Although no system of supervision can 
hope to achieve perfection, Senator DODD 
said. "we know that no type of Federal con-
trol would tolerate a failure rate of the mag-
nitude of that presently occurring in high-
risk automobile insurance." 
Complete Federal regulation of insurance 
may be undesirable, Senator DODD said, "but 
we have a critical problem in the high-risk 
automobile insurance area today, one which 
needs serious attention. If the States do not 
immediately and sufficiently respond, the 
Federal Government will be left with no 
alternative but to itself respond. 
"There are alternatives not amounting to 
outright Federal control which would pro-
tect the public from these many insolvencies. 
An approach similar to that of the Federal 
Deposit Insurance Corporation in banking or 
a Federal Guaranty Fund are possibilities 
which have merit. 
"The time may be at hand to begin ex-
ploring the feasibility of these and other 
possible legislative solutions to this very seri-
ous problem before the American public suf-
fers any further Injustices," the Senator 
said. 
As we said earlier, the time for carping has 
passed, indeed editorializing is of little help. 
What must be so evident is the fact that 
the insurance commissioners should appoint 
a competent all-industry committee and staff 
to cooperate with the State regulatory au-
thorities and solve the high risk problem 
and other problems affecting the private In-
surance concept and State regulation of in-
surance. The integrity of the private in-
surance business is on trial and we must 
have faith that both the commissioners and 
the companies will cooperate and come 
through with needful solutions. 
CONCLUSION OF MORNING 
BUSINESS 
Mr. MANSFIELD, Mr. President, is 
there further morning business? 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
further morning business? If not, morn-
usiness is closed. 
EMENTARY MILITARY AND 
PROCUREMENT AUTHORIZATION, 
FISCAL 1966 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that the un-
finished business be laid before the 
Senate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Chair lays before the Senate the un-
finished business. 
The Senate resumed the consideration 
of the bill (S. 2791) to authorize appro-
priations during the fiscal year 1966 for 
procurement of aircraft, missiles, naval 
vessels, and tracked combat vehicles and 
research, development, test, and evalua-
tion for the armed forces, and for other 
purposes. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, it is my 
judgment that the Senate is about to 
start a session of the Senate which will 
result in a series of votes, probably before 
the day is over, which may be as impor-
tant to the future of this Republic as any 
series of votes ever cast in the history of 
the Senate. 
Mr. President, I believe that at least, 
irrespective of how we feel about the 
issue, the American people are entitled to 
have the attendance of their elected rep-
resentatives in the Senate on this very 
critical occasion and, therefore, I sug-
gest the absence of a quorum and ask for 
a live quorum.

The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BASS 
in the chair). A quorum is present. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, I shall 
speak briefly in support of my amend-
ment, which I shall offer at the end of 
the statement. I may at a later hour 
offer a second amendment. 
Mr. President, the major thesis of my 
case against the pending business of the 
Senate is that the bill goes far beyond 
what its proponents claim for it. The 
pending bill is a policy bill. The pend-
ing bill greatly enlarges American for-
eign policy in Asia. The pending bill 
is pregnant with a policy that will lead 
to the escalation of the war in Asia. 
The pending bill, in my opinion, greatly 
endangers the development of world war 
three. Therefore I think that the pol-
icies inherent in the bill should not be 
adopted by the Senate without restric-
tions being placed upon the bill. 
It is my view, as I expressed in some 
depth last Friday, that this bill greatly 
weakens our system of checks and bal-
ances. 
ii iS a bill that would greatly enlarge 
the discretionary power of the President. 
It is a bill that would_ give determination 
by way of the exercise of what I consider 
to be, for the fiscal year 1966-67, almost 
unlimited discretionary power on the 
part of the Secretary of Defense. There-
lore, I think that the bill should be de-
feated. 
When we finally come to the rollcall 
on the bill, I shall vote against the bill, 
and when I vote against the bill, 
I :hall not be voting to let down Amer-
ican boys in southeast Asia. But I shall 
be voting to try to save the lives of many 
who, in my judgment, will be sent into 
Asia as a result of the passage of this 
bill. 
It is, of course, to be understood that 
I expressed in some detail last Friday my 
answer to the oft-repeated?but un-
founded--charge that those of us who 
oppose the President's policies in south-
east Asia have no substitute plan. 
We have a substitute plan, it plan that 
we have expressed in great detail. 
Mr. President, let me say that I sup-
port the position of General Gavin. I 
support the enclave approach which 
would afford an opportunity for other 
nations to come in and live up to their 
obligations under the United Nations 
Charter to enforce the peace in south-
east Asia. 
Mr. President, with those preliminary 
remarks, I now proceed with my formal 
statement in support of my .00sition in 
opposition to the bill. 
What is printed in the hearings is 
enough to destroy the claim that there 
is little difference between the Gavin-
Kennan proposal for Vietnam and the 
administration objective. The adminis-
tration objective in South Vietnam, 
which l.l quite different from any alleged 
commitment, is one of clearing the 
country for them cf the Vietcong, and 
restoring Genera] Ky to full control over 
the people and territory of South Viet-
nam. Only then will we be prepared for 
any eleetions. That is what was in the 
President's Honolulu speech, and here is 
the military funding that will be needed 
o carry it mit. 
We are going to go to elections when 
we destroy large numbers of Vietcong. 
We are going to go to elections when we 
have "pacified" the country and put Ky 
in power. We are going to go to elec-
tions when we can be sure that Ky is 
going to win the election. However, if 
we had elections controlled by Commu-
nists, then we would have much to say 
and to deprecate. 
Much of the talk of the leaders of 
our Government about elections in South 
Vietnam spells out the word "hypocrisy." 
I think we are highly hypocritical in 
regard to our allegation that we seek 
elections. I think we also seek con-
trolled elections in Vietnam, in that we 
only want them when we control the 
country. 
I pont to Secretary MeNamara's 
statement on page 105 of the hearings 
in response to a question by Senator 
SMITH, for this colloquy shovu the preg-
nancy of this bill with new foreign 
policy. 
read from the hearings: 
Senator SMITH. Mr. SeCretarY are there 
any plans to escalate .a.r.d step u the offen-
sive in Vietnam? 
Secretary MCNAMARA. Well, thele are prep-
arations being made, and they are reflected 
in this Local :1066 supplement, for substan-
tially increasing our deployments to South 
Vietnam and raising the rate of activity of 
our air units there. Whether or not we will 
carry out such higher rates of aiiiivities and 
actually deploy all of those addh..onal forces 
is a decision that only the Pr: sident can 
make, and no such cleaision his yet been 
made. His instruction to us is to be pre-
pared to meet such higher deployments and 
such higher rates of activity shott,c1 the need 
for them arise. 
Senator SmrrH. If there aren't any am-
munition shortages in the Vietnam fighting 
and if there aren't any plans to etcalate and 
step up the fighting in Vietnam, then why 
have you recently opened a halt dozen or 
more ammunition plants directed to start 
operations on increased ammunitions? 
Secretary McNAmARA. To be prepared to 
support higher deployments and higher rates 
of activity. We have laid out over the period 
of the next 13 months?through ,J me 1937?
possible levels of deployment, and possible 
rates of activity which are higher than pres-
ent levels of deployment and rates of activity. 
and in order to be prepared to support them, 
we are requesting funds to procure the am-
munition for such higher deployments and 
higher rates of activity. 
Elsewhere, Secretary McNamara was 
pressed by Senator McCLELtax to de-
scribe and define our military strategy 
and tactics in Vietnam. The Senator's 
question appears on page 112 of tile 
hearing record and it was: 
Are we going to continue fighting what 
appears to be a holding action? 
I read further from the hearings: 
Secretary MCNAMARA. I don't believe that 
we would characterize our preseict military 
strategy or present tactics as holding actions. 
On the contrary, we are taking Lilo offensive, 
seeking to find and destroy the enemy bases 
and forces, and we propose to emtinini to 
follow that strategy and tactic, using what-
ever forces are required to accomplish it in 
order to convince the Vietcong ad particu-
larly the North Vietnamese who are directing 
their operations, that they cannot win in the 
south, and therefore, must cease their at-
tempt to subvert and destroy the political 
institutions of the south. 
Senator MCCLELLAN. That is Nvily it oc-
curs to me that it is primarily a holding 
action. We are just going to hold on and 
show them they can't win. 
May I have order, Mr. President? 
The PRESIDING OFFIC ER. The 
Chair has attempted to secure the co-
operation of Senators. The Senate will 
be in order. 
Mr. MORSE. I continue to read: 
Secretary MCNAMARA. No sir. As I have 
said, our military strategy which is associated 
with the political objective of preserving 
the right of the South Vietnamese to deter-
mine their own destiny is to find and destroy 
the Vietcong and North Vietnamese forces 
operating in South Vietnam. 
A few sentences later, the Secretary 
added: 
If the circumstances change, if the North 
Vietnamese add greater force, if the military 
risk associated with our present policy in-
creases beyond the limits we presently see, 
It might be desirable or necessary in the 
future to modify that strategy (deletic1). 
This, of course, is quite in keeping 
with the Honolulu speech of the Presi-
dent at the Honolulu airport on Febru-
ary 6, when he said: 
We will leave here determined nut only lo 
achieve victory over aggression, but to win 
victory over hunger, disease, and decpair. 
Today's press informs us once again 
that General Ky intends to reu lily both 
North and South under his command. 
Dennite his many statements to tint 
effect, they have never been rejected by 
the American Government. We finance 
and support Ky; we maintain him and 
his coterie of ruling generals in com-
mand in South Vietnam. They are our 
responsibility. When Ky declares it to

be the policy of his government to "go 
North" he is reiterating what President 
Diem declared the policy of his govern-
ment to be in 1955, a policy for which 
he claimed American support. 
Mr. President, in the Washington Post 
this morning, on page A-13, we have a 
story under the headline "Ky Says 
Saigon's Task Is To 'Liberate' North." 
The article reads: 
South Vietnamese Premier Nguyen Cao 
Ky believes his country has the "noble and 
supreme task" of "liberating the North and 
reunifying the fatherland." 
Ky made the statement in a speech on 
February 21 during a public seminar in 
Saigon, but word of it became available In 
Washington only yesterday. 
In calling for reunification of the North, 
Ky said "we cannot betray the 4,000 years of 
our history, and " * we cannot betray the 
sacrifices in bones and blood made by our 
ancestors and our sons and brothers, and 
* * * we cannot let the millions of the 
North Vietnamese people continue to endure 
these sufferings under the yoke of Chi-
nese colonialists and their North Vietnamese 
puppet administration's lackeys." 
Ky has made similar statements in the 
past, but this appeared to be the first of its 
kind since his Honolulu meeting last month 
with President Johnson. Ky'd talk of "liber-
ating" the North is directly at odds with the 
Johnson policy. 
Mr. Johnson has repeatedly said that the 
United States is not threatening the exist-
ence of the North Vietnamese regime and is 
not attempting to alter its Communist form 
of government. 
BILL AUTHORIZES COMBINED WAR FORCE FUNDED 
DEFENSE DEPARTMENT 
The bill provides for the increased 
scope of the war in three ways. First, 
It provides for the funding of all military 
forces serving in South Vietnam out of 
U.S. Defense Department appropriations. 
Second, it authorizes the construction 
of new military bases throughout south-
east Asia at the discretion of the Secre-
tary of State. 
And third, it provides for an increase 
of nearly half a million men in the 
armed services of the United States. 
The first of these?the funding of all 
military activities in Vietnam out of our 
Defense budget?contemplates a total 
and direct reversal of the policy of the 
United States as set forth at the time 
the Southeast Asia Collective Defense 
treaty was presented and ratified. 
I read section 401(a) : 
Funds authorized for appropriation for the 
use of the Armed Forces of the United States 
under this or any other act are authorized 
to be made available for their stated purposes 
in connection with support of Vietnamese 
and other free world forces in Vietnam, and 
related costs, during the fiscal years 1966 and 
1967, on such terms and conditions as the 
Secretary of Defense may determine. 
The bill provides a blank check on 
American defense spending for expand-
ing this war into Laos and Thailand, 
and when we get through paying and 
equipping the armed forces of South 
Korea and the Philippines I think we 
will see the war spread to those coun-
tries, too. 
Under this bill, and in this title, we 
are making the Vietnam war an Ameri-
can war. No longer is there any pretense 
that military aid to the forces of South 
Vietnam, Thailand, South Korea, the 
Philippines, Australia, or New Zealand 
is aid to separate and independent mili-
tary identities. Their forces are to be 
funded out of our American military 
defense spending, and I predict that this 
provision, which is totally unlimited as 
to amount and as to countries, will serve 
to further destroy the integrity of such 
neighboring countries as Thailand and 
any other country that is included in it. 
ASIAN DEFENSE FORCE UNDER SEATO REJECTED 
As I recited to the Senate on Friday, 
this kind of organization was specifically 
rejected in 1954 and 1955 when Secretary 
of State Dulles presented the treaty to 
the Senate, and when it was ratified by 
this body. 
He told the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee that he did not like to use the 
word "SEATO" in connection with the 
treaty, because the "0" stood for "Orga-
nization" and no organization was in-
tended or contemplated. He said: 
We are trying to get away from the word 
because it implies a southeast Asia treaty or-
ganization comparable to the North Atlantic 
Treaty Organization. That organization is 
designed in the case of the North Atlantic 
Treaty to build up a defensive force on the 
continent of Europe which itself would be 
sufficient to resist attack by the Red armies. 
As I point out, that is not now the purpose 
under this treaty. We do not intend to dedi-
cate any major elements of the U.S. 
Military Establishment to form an army of 
defense in this area. We rely primarily upon 
the deterrent of our mobile striking power. 
That we made clear to our associate in the 
treaty, and that is our policy. 
So that we do not intend, Mr. Chairman, to 
have under this treaty any such local com-
bined forces as have been created in Europe 
under the North Atlantic Treaty, and which 
goes by the name of NATO. 
It was on that basis, and with those as-
surances, that the treaty was ratified by 
the Senate. In this bill, we not only 
reverse that policy by creating a local 
combined force, including major ele-
ments of the American Military Estab-
lishment, but we are going to pay the en-
tire cost for all the countries that con-
tribute to it. I know that so far, we are 
told that Ausrtalia and New Zealand are 
paying their own way, but there is no 
reason to expect they will continue to do 
so, once the U.S. Defense Department 
pays for everyone else. 
Mr. President, when Secretary of State 
Dulles presented the treaty to the Sen-
ate, he told the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee that he dici not like to use the 
word "SEATO" in connection with the 
treaty, because the "0," as he said, 
stands for "organization," and no orga-
nization was intended. 
That is very critical in this debate, Mr. 
President. That is why I said last Fri-
day, and will not review it in detail, in 
my judgment the Secretary of State is 
quite mistaken in his now contention 
that SEATO is a justification for a course 
of action. But of course the Secretary 
of State, when he testified before our 
committee, forgot what he told the 
Foreign Relations Committee in both 
1962 and 1964 and in executive session 
in regard to SEATO. He seemed then to 
have been aware of what Secretary Dul-
les had said. 
4189 
EXPANSION OF BASES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA 
The second way in which the bill au-
thorizes the expansion of the war is in 
the authority it gives the Secretary of 
Defense to penetrate further into that 
area of the world. 
Look at the language of section 302. 
The bill authorizes certain construction 
in support of military activities in south-
east Asia, and for other purposes. Sec-
tion 302 reads: 
The Secretary of Defense may establish or 
develop installations and facilities which he 
determines to be vital to the security of the 
United States, and in connection therewith 
to acquire, construct, convert, rehabilitate, or 
install permanent or temporary public works, 
Including land acquisition, site preparation, 
appurtenances, utilities and equipment in 
the total amount of $200 million. 
Do not tell the American people again, 
I say to the Secretary of State, to the 
Secretary of Defense, and to the Presi-
dent, that the United States seeks no 
military bases in South Vietnam or in 
southeast Asia. 
Mr. President, stark realism ought to 
warn us: "We spend these huge sums of 
money for the building of American 
bases in southeast Asia, and we will be 
there for a long time." 
In fact, at the present time, as I 
pointed out in my speech last night here 
on the floor of the Senate, we are finding 
ourselves becoming more and more in-
volved in political controversy with 
Japan for we are maintaining huge bases 
in Okinawa, and we are maintaining our 
naval bases in Japan. 
Even the majority party in Japan is 
split over our course of action. Even the 
majority party of Japan wishes more 
favorable negotiations for our use of 
those bases to the economic advantage 
of Japan. There are many in the ma-
jority party who believe that we should 
get out now, and of course the other 
parties in Japan campaign on that con-
troversy as one of their major issues 
in opposition to the Government of 
Japan. 
When we spend these huge sums of 
money for the building of American 
bases abroad, the tendency is to post-
pone and postpone and postpone getting 
out. In my judgment, in view of what 
is going to develop in southeast Asia, it 
Is my great concern and my fear that 
the construction of these bases, contrary 
to the enclave theory of a General Gavin, 
will result in America's presence in 
southeast Asia for many years to come. 
I believe that now is the time to reject 
that policy. I believe that now is the 
time to reject a bill which has that 
policy included in it, and also, to reject 
a bill which, in my judgment, gives to 
the Secretary of Defense and to the 
President of the United States the dis-
cretionary power which this bill would 
give them. For, as section 5 provides: 
The Secretary of Defense may establish 
or develop installations and facilities which 
he determines to be vital to the security 
of the United States. 
As Senators know, I am always con-
cerned about giving broad discretionary 
power to any administrator of the Gov-
ernment because that always increases

already traveled too far?of government 
by executive supremacy. 
a deplore the extent to Which Con-
gress has already delegated what I con-
sider to be entirely too much discretion-
ary power to the executive branch. 
Therefore, I say that it is a great mis-
take to approve the policy of building 
these installations in southeast Asia. 
That is why I say that the Secretary of 
,Aate. the Secretary of Defense, and the 
President of the United States should no 
larger repeat what they have been say-
ing so freouently, that we seek no mili-
tary bases in southeast Asia. 
this see bin refers to installations and 
.i'acilities 'vital to the security of the 
United States," Who is to say what is 
vital to the security of the country? 
W1'AT IS VITAL IN ASIA? 
Why not the Congress rather than, as 
in the provisions of this bill, the Secre-
tary of Defense. It is he who is author-
ized by this bill to establish the outposts 
of American military command that will 
thence have to be defended by all the 
resources of this Nation that may be re-
quired to defend them. And these so-
called vital interests are not in the West-
ern Hemisphere, for the short title of the 
bill explains that it refers to military 
activities in southeast Asia. 
Mr. President, one of the great differ-
ences between sincere men in this debate 
From its inception, which started two and 
a half years run, is that the Senator from 
Alaska and I have stated time and again 
on the floor of the Senate in our speeches 
that, in our judgment, South Vietnam is 
not worth the life of a single American 
boy. 
repeat that assertion today. 
To my judgment, we cannot justify the 
slaughtering of a single American boy in 
South Vietnam. I am perfectly willing 
to let history be the judge. To those who 
are talking about protecting our boys 
over there by enacting this bill, let me 
say in rebuttal that we who are urging 
defeat of the bill, are urging its defeat 
so that it will force upon the administra-
tion a change of policy which will pre-
vent the killing of American boys in 
South Vietnam. 
Mr. President, that is one of the pre-
cious checks which the Constitution gives 
to Congress; namely, the check on the 
purse strings. All this talk that if we 
exercise this check we will be endanger' 
big the lives of American boys is entirely 
unreal. 
If we exercise the check, we will have 
to change the policy. We will have to 
return to such a program as General 
Gavin has been advocating. We will 
have to fall back on a program which 
prevents escalating the war and sending 
our forces farther and farther into 
South Vietnam, eventually into North 
Vielnam?and, in my opinion, ultimately 
into China, where they will be killed by 
the hundreds of thousands. 
That is the issue at stake here. 
Let the American people understand 
that that is the issue. Let the American 
people answer Congress on that issue as 
we go forward across the Nation in the 
months ahead in this historic debate at 
the grassroots of America over our for-
eign policy. 
As long as we remain free, the Ameri-
can people have the ultimate check upon 
Congress. in my judgment, we have 
reached the point now so that American 
foreign policy can be changed only by 
the American people. I am satisfied 
that it is not going to be changed by 
Congress. 
T do not accept the premise f the op-
position that we have vital it Lerests in 
southeast Asia which call for .milateral 
American military action. The world 
has sona vital issues in southea.st Asia. 
The world has some obligation vis-a-vis 
sonth.eatt Asia. 
When I speak of the world. I mean 
those nations which have pledved them-
selves, caier their own signaturis, to pre-
serve the peace?but not the United 
States unilaterally. Every sigaatory to 
the United Nations Charter hit o an obli-
gation to preserve the peace of the world. 
Do we not see the great difference? 
One of the great differener's which 
exist between us as sincere min is the 
honest difference of opirdoll as to 
whether we have any right, legally or 
morally, to set ourselves UP as the police-
men of the world, to carry out what we 
consider to be the policy that v,?-e believe 
the world should adopt. That is why 
we are having so much difficulty, in so 
many places around the world, in get-
ting more than token support, More than 
lip service to our foreign policy in Asia. 
As the war escalates. and more human 
beings on both sides of the war are 
slaughter ed, we will find rising opposi-
tion and resentment to our country's 
policy. That is why I have been pleading 
that we should come to grips with the 
great moral issue involved, toe, in con-
nection with the war. For, in my judg-
ment:, our policies cannot be reconciled 
with the glorious, historic record of our 
Republic in support of histmOc ideals. 
For I consider that we have walked out 
on those ideals. 
Since when, and in. what act of Con-
gress, is southeast Asia defined as vital 
to the security of the United States, 
justifying any unilateral action that may 
be needed on our part to defend it? The 
most that can be cited is the SEATO 
treaty, which., however, does not define 
the area as vital but refers to a -common 
danger" to all SEATO members that has 
never been seen by our SEATO partners. 
The resolution of August 1964 cites 
southeast Asia as an area where the 
United States regards the maintenance 
of international peace and security" as 
vital to our interests. The continued in-
trusion of large-scale American military 
forces, bases, and navies into this area, 
as provided by the bill, will destroy what 
little international peace and security is 
left to the people of Thailand, Laos, 
Malaysia, and eventually Burma and 
Cambodia, for the war that is lapping at 
their shares will engulf them, no, if it 
is allowed to proceed on its present 
course. 
According to Secretary Mer.,a,mara's 
testimony on pages 52 and 52 of the 
hearings, about $975 million of existing 
and new military construction money is 
to be spent in South Vietnam, the re-
maining $666 million elsewhere in the 
general area. Senators cannot authorize 
a Defense Department to exercise this 
kind of discretion and then not see it 
exercised. This is how the war has been 
enlarged and under this provision it will 
continue to be enlarged. 
On the basis of my observations in my 
many years in the Senate, if the military 
is given the funds it seeks, it always finds 
ways to spend those funds. If mere 
men----I care not who they are?with all 
the human frailties that characterize 
each one of us, gets this kind of power, 
the danger is that they became drunk 
with power. The best way to stop in-
toxication is to keep liquor away from 
the potential intoxicant. The best way 
to avoid the growing danger in this coun-
try that leaders of this country will be-
come more drunk with power is to deny 
them the authorization for the exercise 
of the power. 
That is the policy involved in the bill. 
Sometimes it is said that the resolu-
tion of August 1964 justifies this course 
of action. The resolution of August 1964 
cites southeast Asia as an area where 
the United States regards "the mainte-
nance of international peace and se-
curity" as vital to our interests. The 
continued intrusion of large-scale Ameri-
can military forces, bases, and navies 
into this area is what I am concerned 
about, for they bring an enlargement of 
the war, not peace or security. We 
ought to reject the policy of this bill that 
Permits another enlargement of the war 
at the discretion of the President. 
NEW MANPOWER INCREASES PROVIDED IN BILL 
The third way in which the bill au-
thorizes an escalation in the war is in 
the manpower increases for American 
Armed Forces it provides. 
I call the attention of Senators to the 
tables furnished by the Secretary of De-
fense which appear on pages 14, 15, and 
16 of the hearings. There we see that 
the plans of the Defense Department call 
for increases in active duty military per-
sonnel by a net total?these are in-
creases?of 452,843 men to be financed 
by this measure. That increase is 
planned to be realized by the end of 
fiscal year 1967. Three hundred and 
forty-seven thousand of these men are 
expected to be added by June of 1966. 
Surely Senators who continue to de-
lude themselves that this pending meas-
ure merely finances what has already 
been done and what is now being done 
have simply not read the hearings. Tile 
purpose of the new authorisation is sub-
stantially to increase our ground and air 
operations in southeast Asia and to pro-
vide both the manpower and the ma-
terial to do it. Our immediate objective 
is to eliminate the Vietcong forces from 
South Vietnam and to establish General 
Ky as the unchallenged authority 
throughout South Vietnam. 
It seems to be well understood that 
General Westmoreland wants at least an-
other 200,000 men in South Vietnam to 
step up the work of seeking out Vietcong 
forces and destroying them. Assuming 
that we can do that without North Viet-

nam raising the ante on its side, those 
400,000 troops will have to remain in 
South Vietnam as occupation forces for 
the indefinite future. 
In fact, I think with the adoption of 
this bill the American people ought to 
understand that we are going to have 
large numbers of American soldiers in 
southeast Asia for a long, long time to 
come. I only raise the caveat that, in 
my judgment, when the American people 
fully come to understand that that is 
inherent in our policy in southeast Asia, 
they will repudiate any administration 
that sponsors such a plan, and they 
should. 
RESPONSE FROM OTHER SIDE UNKNOWN 
The most amazing thing about this bill 
is the ease with which Congress has ac-
cepted its authorization for a larger war 
without even asking what we expect the 
other side to do in response. There is 
not a word in the hearings of what the 
administration expects the Vietcong, 
North Vietnam, China, or Russia to do 
in response to our projected buildup. 
Our leaders are, in effect, whistling in 
the dark. They are engaging in wishful 
thinking that China will not come in, or 
that Russia will not come in, or that 
North Vietnam will not commit her army. 
But they have been so wrong so many 
times in regard to what was going to 
happen in Asia that I think time will 
prove them wrong again. I do not think 
the people of the United States or any 
other Western nation will be permitted 
to maintain a foothold in Asia. No mat-
ter how many years it will take to throw 
us out, we will be thrown out, but at 
the cost of a shocking holocaust. 
Is it assumed that North Vietnam, that 
Russia and China, will do nothing? If 
that is the assumption, on what is it 
based? 
Or is there evidence that North Viet-
nam will increase its own military 
strength in the south? Or will the So-
viet Union pour more equipment into 
North Vietnam to be used in the south? 
We are preparing another escalation in 
the war, I say to my colleagues, and we 
are doing it in this bill without so much 
as a hint as to what the response of the 
opposition may be. 
I have quoted Secretary McNamara's 
statement on page 115, wherein he said 
that if the North Vietnamese add greater 
force, if the military risk associated with 
our present policy increases beyond the 
limits we presently see, it might be de-
sirable to change our strategy of not 
seeking to destroy the Government of 
North Vietnam. But as to the possibil-
ities and expectations of the adminis-
tration as to what the response of North 
Vietnam will be, I find nothing in the 
hearings. Nor are we given any hints 
about possible reactions and responses 
from the two great Communist powers, 
China and Russia. 
We have already been through the ex-
perience of the failure of the bombing of 
the north to force Hanoi to the bargain-
ing table. We were all assured a year 
ago that air raids on North Vietnam 
would quickly demonstrate to her the po-
tential destruction the U.S. Air Force and 
Navy could visit upon her and bring her 
to the sensible conclusion that in the 
face of such overwhelming power she 
should seek the best peace she could get 
at the negotiating table. 
We listened to testimony of General 
Gavin and Ambassador Kennan. We 
heard the general point out that Hanoi 
and Saigon are, in fact, two hostage 
cities, and that an attack on one will 
mean, in all probability, an attack on the 
other. 
I most respectfully express the view 
that I am at a loss to understand how 
my colleagues who support this bill think 
that we can go forward with a new pol-
icy that is authorized under the bill and 
not have it result in a great escalation 
of the war on both sides, by the United 
States and by North Vietnam, and I think 
eventually by China, too, with Russia not 
for long standing on the sidelines as a 
noncombatant. 
Mr. President, I am very much of the 
opinion that there is no hope of our 
reaching a peace table. We may event-
ually reach a surrender table, only to 
have the war continue in a different 
form. But there is no hope for a peace 
table under the policies in this bill. 
I repeat that we were all assured a 
year ago that air raids on North Vietnam 
would quickly demonstrate to her the 
potential destruction the U.S. Air Force 
and Navy could visit upon her and 
bring her to the sensible conclusion that 
in the face of such overwhelming power 
she should seek the best peace she could 
get at the negotiating table. 
The Vice President is now abroad in 
the country trying to sell that policy. 
He is going to be answered, although it 
is interesting that he does not want to 
come before a public meeting of the For-
eign Relations Committee or apparently 
even an executive meeting of the Foreign 
Relations Committee to try to defend 
the action he took on the trip that took 
him into southeast Asia. 
But, Mr. President, come or not come, 
policies that he is now advocating, think-
ing that people can be bombed to a peace 
table, must be answered and will be 
answered, because he has drawn the is-
sue. We will meet him on the issue be-
cause in my judgment he, too, must be 
repudiated. 
The Senator from New York [Mr. 
KENNEDY] has brought out with crystal 
clearness the alternative that ought to 
be followed in recognizing that we must 
not take the position that we are going 
to dictate the terms, who will be in-
vited to the negotiating table, and as to 
who will comprise that interim gov-
ernment that is going to be necessary 
for that period of years until at long 
last the people of North and South Viet-
nam will be in a position where they 
can really exercise the precious privilege 
of self-determination. 
All of the proposals for bombing the 
enemy to a negotiating table have thus 
far failed, in my judgment, and will con-
tinue to fail, if we are talking about a 
peace table. 
That expectation proved false. The 
reaction of Hanoi was just the opposite. 
The Defense Department and Secretary 
Rusk contend now that she has increased 
her support to the Vietcong. 
What does Secretary McNamara or 
Rusk think will be the response of Hanoi 
to the increased deployment of troops 
and increased air activities provided for 
in this bill? Senators do not know. If 
the administration has any opinion, it 
has not revealed it. 
I cannot vote for these continued ex-
pansions of the war that jeopardize, and 
do not conserve, more of our Armed 
Forces than are already there. 
This bill does not support the men in 
Vietnam. It calls for the sending of hun-
dreds of thousands more, for military 
objectives that are well beyond the ca-
pacity of our existing Vietnamese force 
to achieve. 
For these reasons and the reasons I 
have already expressed in the series of 
speeches I have made in opposition to 
this bill heretofore in the Senate, when 
the roll is called on the bill itself, I shall 
vote against it. 
HANDWRINGING IS NOT ENOUGH 
Mr. President, I have one closing com-
ment with regard to what we are reading 
In the newspapers today, the wire re-
ports, about, may I say respectfully, the 
handwringers who conclude that the bill 
is not a proper vehicle for any limiting 
language. They should be asked what is 
the proper vehicle. 
The only measure on this subject is the 
foreign aid supplemental and subsequent 
to that, the appropriation. Will they 
take the position that maybe those bills, 
after they have authorized this policy, 
are the proper vehicle for placing some 
restriction on this administration? 
Or are we always going to hear from 
them that the proper vehicle has not 
come along while the whole world slides 
deeper into war? 
Now is the time to place the restric-
tion on this administration. Now is the 
time for Senators who voted for the res-
olution in August 1964, to go on record 
as to the degree they want it modified 
because this is the first opportunity they 
have had to pass upon any policy in re-
gard to America's program in southeast 
Asia. 
I will say to them that they will never 
have a better chance, never a more ap-
propriate chance to take a stand on 
whether or not they reaffirm the position 
that they took in August 1964, or now 
believe that that resolution should be 
restricted. 
Therefore, it is with sadness in my 
heart that I say that I am keenly dis-
appointed that Members of this body who 
have been making so many speeches in 
so many places expressing the view that 
they did not agree when they voted on 
the resolution of August 1964, to all the 
things that this administration has done 
in southeast Asia under it. 
Apparently they are willing today to 
vote without any restriction to a whole 
line of expanded policy in southeast Asia. 
In my opinion they do a great injury by 
following that course of action without 
voting restrictions now. 
As I announced last night, I would 
have offered my amendment yesterday 
had I not said that I would accommo-
date a group of Senators on two occa-
sions to see if they could reach an agree-
ment on a possible modification of the 
resolution of August 1964. Therefore I 
withheld offering the amendment.

Mr. *RUSSELL of Georgia. Mr. Pres-
ident, I am somewhat in a dilemma with 
respect to the amendment proposed by 
Ihe Senator from Oregon. 
It had been my intention to offer as a 
substitute an amendment, that would 
reaffirm all of the original powers and 
tel of the original purposes of the joint 
resolution. of August 10, 1964. 
Tnere is no doubt in my mind that a 
substantial majority of the Senate would 
support men an amendment. 
It is evident that there would be so 
much explanation, and hemming and 
'lawny?: on the part of those who have de-
layed action on this authorization for so 
many days, that this debate would be 
prolonged for several more days if not 
weeks. 
have concluded, after careful con-
sideration, that the defeat of the pro-, 
posal of the Senator from Oregon by the 
Members of the Senate would have the 
same effect as the adoption of the sub-
stitute proposal that I envisioned. I 
say that, Mr. President, because when his 
amendment has been defeated, this will 
leave the original joint resolution of Au-
7, 1964, commonly called the Tonkin 
Gulf Resolution, unimpaired, in full 
strength and vigor, and with Congress, 
except for two Members of the Senate, 
who voted against the 1964 resolution, 
solemnly and solidly behind the President 
in the steps that he has taken in south-. 
east Asia. 
Whatever we may call it, no matter 
how much those who hesitate to take a 
Formal position in this matter may 
obfuscate the issue, when we defeat the 
amendment of the Senator from. 
Oregon--and I can understand why he 
deplores the positions of some of those 
who have been associated with him in 
thai light?the effect will be a reaffirma-
Lion of the President's power. 
F stated when I brought the bill to the 
neer that I did not regard this author-
ization for weapons, medicine, and facil-
ities?including port facilities--as being 
either an affirmation or a rejection of 
our policies in Vietnam and that the bill 
did not get policy in the slightest degree.. 
I have done my best to keep policy deter-
ininations out of the bill, because I 
thought it was more orderly to have them 
considered in some other way. But the 
question of policy has been injected into 
the debate now, and I wish to make it 
perfectly clear that so far as tne senior 
Senator from Georgia is concerned?and 
I hope the President will take the same 
view?the vote on the amendment of the 
Senator from Oregon will be, in effect, a 
reaffirmation of the joint resolution 
passed in August 1964. 
I have not reached my cteiclusion 
hastily. I opposed the original pro-
posal to send American military ad-
visers or a training mission, together 
with a quantity of military equipment 
and materiel, to South Vietnam. as vig-
orously as I could. I am not now in 
favor of intervention througl Kart the 
entire world. By instinct and inclina-
tion, I must confess that I am tn isola-
tionist. I do not believe that tee might 
and Power of the United States can bring 
about the millennium. I do net believe 
that any number of treaties, however 
solemnly drafted, however well-inten-
tioned, will absolutely clear up all the 
strife among the peoples of the world, 
of different nationalities, different races, 
and different creeds. There is nothing 
in all history to suggest that they will. 
But I am in favor of striving for peace, 
because this is indeed a laudable aim to 
work for. Nevertheless, as a realist, I 
am not in favor of contributing Ameri-
can money and American blood in un-
limited quantities for a goal that I do 
not believe is attainable. 
When the joint resolution of August 
1964 was brought forward, I sti,w how 
broad it was in its terms. I cannot plead 
ignorance. I understand theit some 
Senators say that they did not know 
exactly what they were voting nor when 
they voted for that joint resolution. I 
knew how broad it was. For tliat rea-
son, I suggested that Congress reserve 
its power in this matter by a provision 
that the resolution could be terminated 
by a concurrent resolution, in which the 
executive branch of the Government 
does not participate. 
That provision, was written into the 
joint resolution, I think that the Sena-
tor from Oregon would have been better 
advised if he had tried to secure adop-
tion of a concurrent resolution instead 
of offering an amendment to this bill 
for supplies md equipment. 
I am a congressional man.. I have 
stood here for more than 30 yam and 
deplored?almost wept over?the slow 
erosion of congressional power that has 
placed this body in a position inferior to 
the other branches of the Government. 
The whole genius of our Government was 
to provide three coequal branches?legis-
lative, executive, and judicial. 
But, Mr, President, I cannot ig-
norance. I knew that the joint resolu-
tion conferred a vast grant of power upon 
the President. It is writteen in terms 
that are not capable of misinterpretation, 
and about which it is difficult to become 
confused. I read one or two sentences: 
Cons,onaut with the Constitution of the 
United States and the Charter of the United 
Nations and in accordance with its obliga-
tions under the Southeast Asia Collective De-
fense Treaty, the United States is, therefore, 
prepared, as the President determine;, to take 
all necessary steps, including the use of 
armed force, to assist any member or protocol 
state of the Southeast Asia Collective De-
fense Treaty requesting assistance in defense 
of its freedom, 
The language could not have been 
drawn more clearly. :Personally, I would 
be ashamed to say that I did not realize 
what I was voting for when I voted for 
that joint resolution. It is only one page 
in length; it is clear; it is explicit. It 
contains a very great grant of power. I 
would be the last to deny it. 
I stand here today supporting the 
pending measure with all the power of 
my being, not because I believe that the 
United States should be the policeman 
of the world, but because we are con-
fronted with a condition. We are not 
discussing possibilities and theories and 
contingencies. We are confronted with 
a condition where more than 300,000 of 
the flower of the young manhood of this 
Nation are 9,000 miles away from home, 
on foreign soil and waters. I have just 
enough of the old clan spirit of the 
Scotch-Irish?indeed, of the Riropean 
people?to come to the defense If those 
of my own blood when they are in dan-
ger anywhere throughout the world. 
As I see this matter in its simplest 
terms, I am not going to quibble over 
how those men got there. I am not 
going to involve abstract constitutional 
arguments. :I intend to try to help them. 
I regard this situation as being similar 
to one in which a man has become in-
volved in quicksand. He has slowly 
sunk until only his eyes can be seen. 
Along comes his brother with a rope 
under his arm. The unfortunate man 
says, "Brother, please help me out of the 
quicksand." 
The brother asks, "How did you get in 
the quicksand? What did you want to 
walk over there for? You ought to have 
had more sense. When are you going to 
get out of the quicksand?" 
Mr. President, I am not going to go 
through all of that. I am going to throw 
the rope. I intend to do all within my 
power without splitting hairs, without 
legalisms, and without theorizing to sup-
port these men who are there in Vietnam, 
not of their own volition. They did not 
order themselves there. But they are 
there because they were ordered by 
authority established under our form of 
government. 
I am not afraid of the constitutional 
issue that is involved here. There is no 
question in my mind about the consti-
tutionality of all that has been done. I 
have grave doubts as to the wisdom of 
some of it, but there is no question what-
ever as to the constitutionality of it. 
There have been over 125 instances in 
which American men have been ordered 
to take action or maintain positions 
abroad through pure Presidential order 
without the support of the kind that was 
afforded to the President of the United 
States in the Tonkin Gulf resolution. 
Wilson sent the marines into Vera 
Cruz to satisfy American honor. As I 
recall it, Buchanan sent troops into for-
eign lands. He sent them to attack and 
charge and carry the forts at Canton in 
China because of an insult to the U.S. 
flag.

There was a day when the American 
People cheered when Theodore Roosevelt 
said: "Perdicaris alive, or Raisuli dead." 
That was in the days when we were not so 
completely international. That was in 
the days when people were proud to be 
American citizens. That was in the days 
when an American citizen felt that he 
had a right to look to his country to pro-
tect him. That was before we got all of 
this infection that is today making this 
county quiver and hesitate and raise a 
fictitious issue. 
There should be no question as to the 
constitutionality of this situation. There 
is nothing mandatory in the Constitution 
about declaring war. 
In an effort to separate governmental 
powers and establish a system of checks 
and balances, the Constitution of the 
United States provides that the power 
to declare war is in the Congress. How-
ever, that same Constitution, in enumer-
ating the powers of the President of the 
United States, provides that he is Com-
mander in Chief of all the Armed Forces 
of the United States. Every person 
knows that the Commander in Chief has 
a right to order the forces wherever he 
may will. Congress then, to shift back 
to the system of checks and balances, has 
ways of exercising its responsibility. One 
way is the power of the purse. It can 
deny the President the funds. But I 
hope that we never have another in-
stance in which an attempt is made to 
deny funds in the middle of an under-
taking that has been approved by Con-
gress. That can only mean hardship to 
the young men serving in our Armed 
Forces. It would not really punish those 
whose actually ordered them there. 
The Constitution grants the Congress 
a great many powers that it does not 
exercise. One is that Congress has the 
power to define and punish offenses 
against the law of nations. 
A substantial argument could be made 
that we are undertaking to punish of-
fenses against the law of nations in the 
fight in Vietnam. 
We have waged war without a declara-
tion of war time and again. Not only 
has the Commander in Chief waged war 
without any formal declaration of war, 
but Congress has also done so. 
I have a very errant and varied ap-
petite in reading. I suppose that I have 
accumulated more useless information 
from books than has any other living 
person. I spend hours each day in read-
ing. However, one sometimes comes up 
with something that is helpful. 
When this question of constitutionality 
was raised a few months ago, I remem-
bered that I read an old book that was 
entitled "Our Naval War With France." 
I sent to the Congressional Library for 
the book. 
If ever there were a case in which Con-
gress waged a war for 3 years, it was in 
the naval war with France. In propor-
tion to our strength in that period we put 
more of our resources and men into that 
war than we have put into this war in 
South Vietnam. 
I am not going to read at length from 
this book. It is fascinating to me, but 
No. 36-7 
It would be very boring to most people 
to read about the battle between the 
privateer Bette and the man-of-war Ex-
calibur, and how one boarded the other. 
I get a vicarious pleasure from that type 
of reading. 
As recounted in this book, when our 
representative to France had been in-
sulted, the President sent a message to 
Congress and said: 
I will never send another minister to 
France without assurances that he will be 
received, respected, and honored as the rep-
resentative of a great, free, powerful, and 
independent nation. 
Our people had much more confidence 
in themselves when we had about 31/2 
million people scattered along the Atlan-
tic seaboard from Canada to Florida than 
we have today when we are unquestion-
ably the greatest power on earth. 
I continue to read: 
Congress had already begun to act, and 
during the spring and summer of 1798, 
adopted a number of warlike measures. The 
first of these was an act, passed April 27, 
to provide additional armament for the pro-
tection of American trade; and on the 30th, 
another, organizing the Navy Department. 
We had no Department of the Navy 
until 1798. It had been in the Depart-
ment of the Army. 
I continue to read: 
Acts soon followed directing the construc-
tion and purchase of more vessels, authoriz-
ing the capture of French vessels, suspending 
intercourse with France, establishing the 
Marine Corps, and making other necessary 
provisions for hostilities. Inasmuch as under 
the Constitution of the United States treaties 
are the supreme law of the land, these meas-
ures of defense, being in conflict wth exist-
ing treaties with France?
That refers to the treaties?
were deemed unlawful. Therefore, to avoid 
this difficulty, as well as to get rid of trouble-
some obligations, the treaties were abrogated 
by the act of July 7, on the ground that they 
had already been violated by France. 
Here Congress was abrogating treaties 
of immunity and friendship with France. 
In that case, we walked right up to a 
declaration of war. 
It will be recalled that our Government 
summoned George Washington from his 
well-earned retirement to Mount Vernon, 
and said: 
We are about to fight these French. We 
want you to come and take command of the 
armies. 
What George Washington said should 
cause some people to be ashamed of 
themselves. He said: 
I must not conceal from you my earnest 
wish that the choice had fallen upon a man 
less declined in years and better qualified to 
encounter the usual vicissitudes of war. 
Feeling how incumbent it is upon every per-
son, of every description, to contribute at all 
times to his country's welfare, and especially 
In a moment like the present, when every-
thing we hold dear and sacred is threatened, 
I have finally determined to accept the com-
mission of Commander in Chief of the Armies 
of the United States. 
Mr. President, the book continues 
about how they established the Marine 
Corps. I could read the reports of 100 
naval engagements. We sent American 
frigates to the Bay of Biscay; we sent 
them into the Mediterranean; we sent 
parties into the harbors at Martinique 
and Guadalupe and Cap-Haitien in Haiti, 
where the French were then stationed, 
and cut out their ships and attacked 
their forts; and we had a good many 
people killed and we killed many French-
men over a period of 3 years. But no-
body declared war and nobody urged 
that we declare war. 
I remind you, Mr. President, that there 
were men in ?that Congress who had 
served in the Constitutional Convention. 
They had some idea of what was intended 
by that document, the Constitution of 
the United States. 
Oh, I realize it is considered as out-
moded, in some quarters. Some persons 
think tile Constitution has no place in 
today's Acheme of things. But as long as 
I am in the Senate, I shall refer to the 
Constitution as a guide for my actions. 
I have taken an oath to do so, and I 
make no pretense to great piety, but I 
shall not welsh. 
Here is another paragraph: 
To supplement the activity of the Navy 
in the defense of the country, private enter-
prise was stimulated by issuing letters of 
marque. The act of June 25, 1798?
That was an act of Congress, my fel-
low Senators, not an act of the President 
of the United States?
The act of June 25, 1798, ordered that mer-
chant vessels might "repel by force any as-
sault" committed upon them by French 
cruisers or privateers, capture the aggres-
sors and recapture American vessels which 
had been taken by the French. 
It goes on to say: 
The act of July 9 authorized the President 
to grant the owners of private armed ships 
* * * special commissions * * * and such 
private armed vessels, when duly commis-
sioned, shall have the same license and au-
thority for subduing, seizing, and capturing 
any French armed vessels * * as the pub-
lic armed vessels might by law have. 
That law was passed by the Congress 
of the United States. This was no 
quick, overnight affair. It lasted for 
over 3 years. I do not wish to bore Sen-
ators, but there are many references 
to many acts of Congress while the 
United States was waging war for 3 years 
without any formal declaration. 
I do not favor any declaration of war 
in this case. Whom would we declare 
war against? If we can only declare it 
against the Vietcong, it would have been 
just as sensible in other eras to have said, 
"We declare war against Francisco Villa, 
or we declare war against Sandino"?I 
believe that was the bandit down in 
Nicaragua we fought for some time. 
It just does not make sense to declare 
war against the Vietcong. 
Should we declare war against the 
North Vietnamese? We do not recognize 
North Vietnam. They are not in the 
United Nations. And we do not know 
what effect such a declaration of war 
would have. 
A declaration of war against North 
Vietnam might bring into play mutual 
defense treaties between and among 
North Vietnam, Communist China, and

the. Soviet, Union. So I am not in favor 
of declaring war. I see nothing to be 
gained by it, and I perceive that we might 
Lose a great deal. It would be a vary, 
very foolish step to take. 
President, the issue of constitu-
tionalism comes with a hollow sound 
from anybody except the Senator from 
Oregon and the Senator from Alaska. 
They voted against the Tonkin Ba,y 
resolution; and therefore they can 
certainly offer or urge any argument 
they wish against this matter free of any 
criticism. 
We gave the President of the United 
States power in that resolution. If we 
want to take it back, the best way i.s 
through a concurrent resolution. 
But I knew what I was doing. I did 
It with some qualms, but I am not here 
today to plead ignorance and say I did 
not know what I was doing, or that I did 
not know the power would go so far, 
when the -resolution said he could use 
any steps?any steraa?that might be 
necessary to protect our vital interests 
in the main tenance of international 
peace and security in southeast Asia. 
So we may criticize the President, but

any way. I appreciate the fact that the 
distinguished Senator from Kentucky. 
1Mr. MORTON I , who was then Assistant 
Secretary of State--I had forgotten all 
about the incident until last summer, 
when I returned from my illness, he 
mentioned it here on the floor?was sent 
down to Georgia to tell me a mission 
had been sent to South Vietnam, and 
that we were going to send. material. I 
told him then, "I think you. have made a 
mistake, but the Commander in Chief 
can commit our flag, and I will support 
he flag, even though I think it is going 
to be a long struggle and costly in blood 
and treasure." 
-OTI that way today. I think the 
sooner we come to some decision there, 
the better off everybody will be. I do 
not favor all this timidity, whether it 
is in the executive branch of the Gov-
ernment or in the Congress. If we are 
going to keep men there, I am not in 
favor of having them picked off by 
handfuls here and there. in order to 
keep down the casualty lists, when we 
know over a period of years it, is going to 
amount to massive numbers_ If it is 
our policy to keep them there?and it is 
our avowed policy?I say, "Visit such 
punishment on the North Vietnamese as 
will bring about a conference, and let, 
us come to some determination of this 
issue. Let them. have an election in 
South Vietnam_ If they want a Com-
munist government and can vote for it 
without intimidation, I think they have 
a right to have it, under our doctrine 
of self -determin ation." 
However, self-determination is some-
what like the Constitution; it becomes 
less deserved in our system as we go 
along, because it seems that we support 
authoritarian regimes and republics 
alike, if we happen to be allied with 
them by treaty. 
Mr. President, I must say that I was 
more than mildly surprised and per-
plexed by the timing of this assault, par-
ticularly the vehicle which was selected 
for it. This is an authorization bill, and 
I have tried to point out that it did not 
specifically involve policy, although I 
concede that money is going to be spent 
hi Vietnam. 
If Senators wish to punish the Presi-
dent by starving 300,000 American boys 
and leaving them in Vietnam, they 
should not only vote for the resolution 
of the Senator from Oregon but should 
also vote against the authorization. 
Senators have this power. But, I have 
an idea, if they do, that they will hear 
something from the American people. 
Every State in the Union has men in 
Vietnam. The people hack in the "boon-
docks" and in our towns, and those liv-
ing in the fords of the creeks., have a 
high value of life. It is a matter of grief 
when one of those coffins, with the Amer-
ican flag draped over it, comes back home 
to a small town. It is not a matter of 
higgling and haggling about policy or 
Presidential power. It is a matter which 
strikes right into the homes of a whole 
community. 
We have been placed on notice that 
this authorization would be sought. 
Last August there was brought before 
the Senate and clearly explained a $1.7 
billion supplemental appropria Lion for 
the same purposes involved here. 
It passed by an 89-to-0 vote. At that 
time, it was declared on the floor of the 
Senate that the $1.7 billion would be 
just the downpayment. that additional 
authorizations; and appropriations would 
be required early this year. Now we run 
into difficulties?right in the middle of 
the war?with a maze of technicalities, 
legalisms, surmises, false premises, more 
than I have ever seen hurled at one bill, 
much less a relatively modest authoriza-
tion of this kind. 
Mr. President, it has been stated on 
the floor of the Senate:, in flights of hy-
perbole, that this measure is an open-
ended invitation to war. I suppose this 
could be said about every annual appro-
priation bill enacted for the Defense 
Department from year to year, if it could 
be said, with accuracy, of the pending 
bill. If this is an open-ended invitation 
to war, then every appropriation bill for 
the maintenance of our Armed Forces is 
also an open-ended invitation to war. 
I, for one, am not willing to go about 
curbing the President's power by punish-
ing American boys in Vietnam. 
Mr. President, I do not wish to discuss 
this matter at further length, although 
I am full with it, because I have been 
torn by conflicting emotions, as I am sure 
most Senators have, concerning this is-
sue. But I am not badly torn when it 
comes to the issue of supporting Ameri-
can soldiers, sailors, marines, or airmen, 
because I have some familiarity with 
the lives they must live and their obliga-
tions. I know that they do not control 
their own comings and goings, that it is 
impossible to do so in any military estab-
lishment. I cannot conceive of a higher 
duty on the part of Congress than to 
support those who have been brought 
into the Armed Forces, who have been 
taken out of their businesses, taken away 
from civilian pursuits, paid a minimum 
salary, and then there is haggling over 
whether we are going to support them or 
not. 
To me, it is utterly incomprehensible. 
I cannot understand it. 
We have taken a calculated risk in 
Vietnam. We took it when the first man 
landed. We had it when a contingent, 
landed there yesterday. We took a cal-
culated risk when we operated our air-
power in the south. We took a calcu-
lated risk when we operated our airpower 
in the north. I hope that we will take 
a calculated risk in undertaking to put 
a "stopper in the bottle" at the port at 
Haiphong and cut off their supplies to 
those trying to conquer South Vietnam. 
I do not believe that we are ever going 
to bring this war to a termination until 
that is done. 
Mr. President, sometimes I believe that 
the American people do not realize the 
tremendous might and strength of our 
military organization. Howevir, our 
enemies know it. There was no doubt 
about it in the mind of Mr. Khrushchev 
when he received that letter on Cuba, 
He knew more about the strength of 
this country, and respected it more, thou 
those who may tremble now at the 
thought of a confrontation. 
It did not take Mr. Khrushchev long 
to send an answer, although I am not 
satisfied with the termination of that 
episode. I believe that in our exultation 
and celebration of that victory, we gave 
the victory away. We are now in the 
position of babysitting for Castro. when 
we should have destroyed him when we 
found the long-range missiles there. 
That is my own view. As an individual 
I can express it, although I realize that 
it is not a majority view, either of Con-
gress or the American people; but I just 
do not know when we will ever have an-
other reason for doing it. 
Congress had passed a resolution 
shortly before, declaring that the intro-
duction of any offensive weapon into 
Cuba was an act of aggression against 
the United States. But now we arc baby-
sitting for Castro, who is 90 miles away 
from our shores, while fighting other 
communism 9,000 miles away. The hu-
man and logistical costs are staggering 
to contemplate. There is no doubt, in 
my mind that if we had wiped out Castro. 
there would not be any similar probing;; 
along the perimeter of the Iron Curtain 
for the next 8 to 10 years. There will be. 
even if we bring the Vietnamese situa-
tion under control?as we will, eventu-
ally. There will be further probings on 
the part of communism in their quest for 
world domination, because they axe not 
going to stop. But firm action against 
Cuba would have stopped them for a

long time. It would certainly have 
slowed down the Communists. 
Mr. President, if there ever were a time 
when Congress should have at least an 
appearance of unity?whether we have 
any unity or not?it is today. Upon the 
unity of the American people in this 
Vietnam war depend the hopes of bring-
ing it to an early conclusion. I do not 
doubt that Hanoi, Peiping, and Moscow 
know what is going on. With every little 
sign of dissent, every criticism, every at-
tack on American foreign policy, they 
will say, "Well, we are catching hell out 
there in Vietnam, but look what is going 
on back in the United States. We will 
hold on for a while longer. They will 
tire, and they will withdraw. Thus we 
will gain a victory." 
So I say, Mr. President, it is time for an 
appearance of unity. And I hope that 
this issue will not be brought up recur-
ringly on every bill that comes along. 
It should have been fought out when the 
Tonkin Gulf resolution was before the 
Senate. If an issue were to be made of 
the situation, it should have been made 
then. 
Mr. President, generally I do not ap-
prove of appeals to emotion, because I do 
not believe they serve any useful purpose; 
but I should like to tell the Senate of a 
letter I received from a Georgia widow, 
with a son who is a corporal in the 1st 
Battalion of the 1st Marines. He had 
served his hitch in Vietnam and was re-
turned to the United States in December 
1964, but was shipped back to Vietnam in 
August of 1965. She wrote me to ask if it 
were right for a person who had finished 
one tour of duty there to be sent back so 
quickly. She informed him she had writ-
ten to me, and she sent me his answer. 
This is from a man who had already 
served one hitch in Vietnam and had 
been sent back. This is the reply to her 
letter she received from him: 
DEAR IVIorxxs: I can't approve of what you 
did; I could not come home any way but the 
right way, and that is when my time is up, 
or else I'm wounded or dead, and I believe it 
will be because my time is up. 
He had faith in himself. I do not know 
whether he is still alive and serving there. 
The letter continues: 
The other two ways I don't like. I'd love 
to be home, but there are times a man can't 
do what he would like to do, but has to do 
his part, and I believe this is my part. I hope 
you understand it isn't because I don't want 
to see you, but rather it's because I have a 
duty to do here. Come October I'll be home. 
There may be a finer or higher sense 
of duty than that, but it has not been 
reflected here in this body. 
? Robert E. Lee is one of my heroes. I 
say that unashamedly. He was a great 
man, though he was the head of the rebel 
armies. He said that "Duty" is the most 
sublime word in the English language. 
The spirit of that American fighting 
in Vietnam is the most sublime spirit. 
Would to God it could permeate some of 
those in this Chamber, because we can-
not win by haggling over an authoriza-
tion bill at this time. 
Mr. SALTONSTALL. Mr. President, 
we have listened to a very eloquent plea 
by the Senator from Georgia for action 
on the bill. I know we are going to do it 
very shortly. The Senator from Georgia, 
who made his plea, has pointed out the 
authority involved under the Constitu-
tion, and our duty in the Senate. He 
expressed himself very fully on this sub-
ject. He and I spoke on the floor over 
2 weeks ago, when we brought the bill 
out of the Senate Armed Forces Com-
mittee by a unanimous vote. We believe 
there should be prompt action because 
the boys in Vietnam should be supported, 
and they need this authorization and the 
appropriation to support them. 
I am opposed to the amendment of the 
senior Senator from Oregon for two rea-
sons. First, I do not think it is in order 
in connection with the bill presently 
before us, and second, I oppose it on its 
merits. This is no time to pull the rug 
out from under the President. 
S. 2791, which authorizes $4.8 billion 
in supplemental fiscal 1966 defense ap-
propriations, provides necessary funds 
so that our men in Vietnam will have 
the equipment, food, and clothing they 
need to carry out their assigned tasks in 
the best possible way. It was reported 
out of the Armed Services Committee by 
a unanimous vote, even though some 
committee members may not entirely 
agree with our Vietnam policy. 
Whether that policy is right or wrong 
was not considered central to considera-
tion of this bill. It is a separate issue 
which, as I stated at the time the bill 
was reported, should be considered 
separately. 
Of course there should be free and 
open discussion of our role in Vietnam. 
Certainly no one denies the right of an 
individual to raise questions regarding 
the wisdom of our policies there; we know 
there are important differences within 
this body on the issue. But S. 2791 is not 
the proper place to debate the funda-
mental question raised by the Senator 
from Oregon. 
We must be aware that the issue pre-
sented by the Senator from Oregon is 
not a matter of withholding from the 
President some new authority he has re-
quested. It is a question of withdrawing 
from him authority which the Senate, 
with but two dissenting votes, freely gave 
to him in August of 1964, and withdraw-
ing it at a most awkward time. The 
implications of such an action are there-
fore very serious, and the consequences 
could be far reaching and lasting. 
The legal basis for our participation 
in the Vietnam conflict has been ques-
tioned here and elsewhere. I find it 
significant and gratifying that recently 
the house of delegates of the American 
Bar Association by a unanimous vote of 
279 to 0 upheld the legality of our in-
volvement and said it was consistent with 
the United Nations Charter. 
There are different opinions in this 
body regarding Vietnam, but I think we 
all applaud the recent statement of Presi-
dent Johnson as he received the National 
Freedom Award in New York: 
We stand for self-determination?for free 
elections?and we will honor the result. 
His statement of our purpose is worth 
repeating: 
Our purpose in Vietnam is to prevent the 
success of aggression. It is not conquest; it 
is not empire; it is not foreign bases; it is 
riot domination. Our men in Vietnam are 
there to keep a promise made 12 years ago. 
The Southeast Asia Treaty promised?as 
Secretary John Poster Dulles said for the 
United States?"that an attack upon the 
treaty area would occasion a reaction so 
united, so strong, and so well placed, that 
the aggressor would lose more than it could 
hope to gain." But we keep more than a 
specific treaty promise in Vietnam. We keep 
the faith for freedom. 
None of us likes the situation in which 
we find ourselves in Vietnam. Everyone 
is troubled by it. We know that an in-
creasing number of Americans is being 
exposed to danger and that some of our 
boys are being wounded or killed. We 
all want peace in that troubled area, but 
we must face the facts. We are in Viet-
nam?we are there because of our belief 
that people everywhere should be free to 
determine their own way of life, free to 
make the basic decisions regarding their 
government. We know there is no easy 
way out. As George Kennan, in analyz-
ing our policy, said recently in testimony 
before the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee: 
A precipitate and disorderly withdrawal 
could represent in present circumstances a 
disservice to our own interests and even to 
world peace greater than any that might 
have been involved in our failure to engage 
ourselves there in the first place. 
Given the situation and the responsi-
bilities of the President as Commander 
in Chief and the chief agent of our for-
eign policy to exercise leadership in this 
crisis, can we shoot down his authority, 
restrict his actions, and indeed in effect 
repudiate the earnest efforts he has made 
to bring peace to that troubled area? I 
think we cannot, and I think we should 
not. 
Whether or not one has misgivings 
about our policy in Vietnam, it seems to 
me inappropriate at this time to take the 
action recommended by the senior Sena-
tor from Oregon. What would be the 
consequences of such an action? What 
would be its effect on the morale of those 
serving us there? What would be the 
effect on our allies and on the Govern-
ment of South Vietnam? How would 
Thailand, Cambodia, Indonesia, and 
other neighboring countries react? 
Such an action would bring satisfaction 
to our enemies, consternation to those 
countries who, like us, are dedicated to 
the preservation of freedom, and would 
strike a crippling blow at the morale of 
our fighting men presently in Vietnam. 
This is a time to show the world that 
individual differences over particular ac-
tions do not prevent us from presenting 
a united front, from supporting our Com-
mander in Chief. 
Senators and other Americans ought 
to continue to discuss the situation in 
Vietnam, to raise questions about poli-
cies, and offer constructive suggestions. 
That is one thing, but to shoot from un-
der the President at this time his au-
thority which we almost unanimously 
gave him in 1964 is, to me, unthinkable. 
Of course, we expect the President to 
use sound judgment and to confer and 
consult with his advisers and the Con-
gress as he goes about the difficult task

of ending this conflict. He has kept us 
informed so far and has asked our views 
and I see no reason to think he will stop 
doing so. 
I am confident that when the vote is 
taken on the Morse amendment it will 
be defeated by an overwhelming margin. 
That will reveal our unity of purpose, 
that will give hope to our servicemen 
and to the people of South Vietnam, and 
will dismay our enemies who may have 
been deluded into thinking discussion 
meant fundamental disagreement. It 
will remind the world of our concern for 
our fellow man as he :fights to remain 
free and to live in peace and rebuild his 
economy and the social and political life 
of his country. At this difficult time we 
cannot repudiate our President or imply 
that we have no confidence in his future 
actions. Passage of the Morse amend-
ment would be misunderstood around the 
world with irreparable damage to our 
prestige and that of our President. I 
shall vote against it, and hope that it 
will be overwhelmingly defeated. 
Mr. STENNIS. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield to me for I minute? 
Mr. SALTONSTALL? I yield. 
Mr. STENNIS. I wish to say to the 
Senate and to the people of this Nation 
that I do not believe the solidarity and 
unity of this Chamber has ever been 
better represented in a time of peril than 
it has by the two spokesmen we have 
just heard, the Senator from Georgia 
I Mr. RUSSELL!, who is the chairman of 
the committee, and the Senator from 
Massachusetts [Mr. SALTONSTALL I, who 
is the ranking Republican member of the 
committee. I salute them and commend 
them. 
T would like to be associated with 
every point that they made. I would like 
to be especially associated with the point 
that the Senator from Georgia made 
when he said every dissent, every divi-
sion, every expression of doubt, every ex-
pression of uncertainty is encouragement 
to our adversaries. They are looking for 
that kind of encouragement. They know 
that, they cannot beat us on the field of 
battle, but they are looking here for en-
couragement to carry on their activities. 
hope that we get an overwhelming 
vote. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. I will only 
state what I said some time ago when I 
said I hoped that this amendment would 
be offered, because T. wanted to speak 
against- it and vote against it. 
Senators have complained in some in-
stances that they have 'not had an op-
portunity to express themselves. If 
anyone does not have confidence in the 
President, if he wants to withdraw from 
the President as our Commander in 
Chief under the Constitution, the au-
thority given the President to take what.. 
eversteps he finds necessary to resist 
aggression, then that Senator should 
vote for the amendment. If th.e motion 
te table is made, he should vote against 
the motion to table. 
As far as T am concerned, I am voting 
on the merits of this matter. I under-
sWorl the merits of the matter when I 
voted in August of 1964. I understand 
very well that we cannot fight a war by 
having 535 commanders in chief. There 
must be one Commander in Chief. We 
must unite behind that Commander in 
Chief and have faith and confidence in 
:him, just as we have in the men that we 
send there to defend our national honor 
and the freedom of the world. 
I will vote against the amendment and 
I hope that anyone who lacks faith and 
confidence in the President will vote 
against the motion -to table in the event 
it be made. 
Mr. President, I have an editorial here 
that I wish to put in the RECORD from 
WTOP in Washington. It is a very fine 
statement making clear the fact that 
those who wish to urge a policy of weak-
ness and urge that we should not be firm 
and strong in our commitments, and 
those who wish to further erode the 
strength of our position, should seek to 
address themselves to the President in-
dividually and personally rather than 
through the press and the CONGRESSIONAL 
R,ECORD. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent that the WTOP editorial be printed 
in the REcoaa as a part of my remarks. 
There being no objection, the edi-
torial wa,s ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[Editorial broadcast on Feb. 23 ;.nd 24, 1966, 
over WTOP radio and telev ision] 
PRENEGOTIATIC)N STRATD (Or 
Perhaps the wisest thing that has been 
said in the most recent flap about Vietnam 
came from U.N. Ambassador Arthur Gold-
burg following a White House conference. 
The Ambassador was asked about Senator 
KENNEDY'S statement, to the effect that the 
Communists might be allowed to participate 
in a coalition South Vietnamese government. 
His response was that enough h,ei been said 
on the subject already. 
There has been a gre;t; to-ing and fro-ing 
here in Washington the last couple of days 
about Senator KENNEDY'S argument that it 
might be necessary to admit dissident 
groups?meaning the Vietcong, mostly?into 
"a share of power arid resporsibility" In 
Saigon. 
There have been any number of attempts 
at clarification, with the result that Senator 
KENNEDY appears to be edging ct)ser to the 
White House view on how the Communists 
might become entitled to share power in 
South Vietnam. But in the mids;, of all the 
declarations on the subject, a fat emerges 
which needs attention. 
IL is that the United lAates cannot decide 
publicly before negotiations start just what 
our final bargaining po.:itions wilt be. The 
situation allows a considerable number of 
options, depending on a number of circum-
stances when and if the C.iommun sts decide 
to talk to as. 
We have offered unconditiona negotia-
tions. We have agreed to have the Vietcong 
represented, in fact if not in tame, We 
have said?before Senator HENS I Olt raised 
the issue?that we will accept tie conse-
quences of self-determination alDeng the 
people of South Vietnam, whetho r we like 
those consequences or not. Sures y this is 
as much as we ought to concede in advance 
of talks a'oout the terms of a peace agree-
men t. 
This was a WTOP editorial, 3::ck Jurey 
speaking for WTOP. 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I feel 
moved to speak because I think there 
is a point of view which has not been 
expressed. 
Those of us, like myself, who 'viii vote 
against the Morse amendment and want 
to table it, and who will vote for the 
bill to give the President additional 
funds, are not again writing a blank 
check. 
I do not, and I cannot accept the vote 
against the Morse amendment as being 
a reaffirmation. Reaffirmation is the 
word used by the Senator from Georgia 
[Mr. RUSSELL]. He made a most moving 
speech, with which I agree in substance, 
as well as the speech of the Senator from 
Massachusetts [Mr. SALTONSTALL1. 
I cannot accept the fact that this will 
be a reaffirmation of the resolution of Au-
gust 1964. The fact is that as the Presi-
dent has handled this situation he leaves 
us no other alternative. He has left no 
alternative for those who disagree with 
his policies except to vote against an au-
thorization on another occasion. As I 
agree with his policies ?to date, I shall 
vote for this authorization. But if to-
morrow I disagree with his policies the 
President leaves us no alternative but to 
vote against an authorization, and I 
shall do so. 
Why is that so? It is a fact that the 
President has, in my Judgment, the con-
stitutional authority?as the house of 
delegates of the association of the bar 
found, as the Senator from Massachu-
setts [Mr. SALTON5TALL] said, as Com-
mander in Chief and the official charged 
with foreign policy of the Nation?to in-
tercede in Vietnam or any place with the 
Armed Forces of the United States where 
the interests of the United States are in 
such imminent danger. He can come to 
the Congress for the necessary authority 
which is, generally speaking a declara-
tion of war. 
I thoroughly agree with the Senator 
from Georgia [Mr. RUSSELL 1 that a dec-
laration of war would be most inadvis-
able at this time and I have said so in 
debate on the floor of the Senate. 
The President was not satisfied with 
that. He not only ordered U.S. troops 
to Vietnam under aforementioned Presi-
dential authority but he came to the 
Congress for a resolution and asked us 
to join in the policy. That resolution 
was not juridically necessary and it has 
no juridicial force. But in terms of pol-
icy it is critically important. It com-
mitted us to Presidential policy as of 
that time. 
That is what the Gulf of Tonkin reso-
lution meant. Having associated our-
selves with this policy then, we now have 
a right to be consulted once again. 
The Senator from Oregon told us the 
only logical thing he could do, consider-
ing his point of view, was to give us the 
opportunity to repudiate the policy the 
President set, and lie is right,. If we 
voted for the amendment of the Senator 
from Oregon., and the other body did, as 
it is also required to act, we would no 
longer be the President's partners in a 
policy sense. 
It is a fact, whether we like it or riot, 
that by virtue of having acted on the 
resolution of August 1964, we are a party 
to present policy. But we are a party 
that should be consulted now as well. 
We must be given an opportunity at the 
Initiative of the President, to reaffirm 
our support for a new situation and also 
to set limits to his commitments of U.S. 
power. Our August 1964 resolution is

analogous, in my mind, to a power of at-
torney that one gives to a lawyer or 
someone else for a particular purpose: 
buying a house, a withdrawal of money 
from a bank account, and so forth, which 
power is also on very general terms. 
I agree with the Senator from Georgia 
[Mr. RussELLl that we are not engaged 
in legal tautologies. I understood per-
fectly that? the President would get a 
grant of enormous authority. I said so. 
The Senator from Kentucky [Mr. 
COOPER] said so. The Senator from 
Georgia, I am sure, understood that very 
clearly. I know that he is an excellent 
lawyer; of course he did. 
Mr. RUSSELL of Georgia. Mr. Pres-
ident, will the Senator from New York 
yield? 
Mr. JAVITS. I yield. 
Mr. RUSSELL of Georgia. The Sena-
tor knows that we were approving the 
use of the President's constitutional 
power. 
Mr. JAVITS. Exactly. 
Mr. RUSSELL of Georgia. We put 
Congress behind the President. We put 
the imprimatur of congressional power 
on a power that he could have exercised 
anyway. The late Senator Borah an-
swered an argument that the Congress 
could make the President bring home 
certain troops then stationed in Europe: 
We could not make the President do it. He 
is Commander In Chief of the Army and Navy 
of the United States; and if in the discharge 
of his duty he wants to assign them there, I 
do not know of any power that we can exert 
to compel him to bring them home. We may 
refuse to create an army, but when it is cre-
ated he is the commander. 
? Mr. JAVITS. The Senator is exactly 
correct. The logical sequel to that is 
that if the President has abused his 
power to commit our forces, Congress 
still has a remedy. That remedy is to 
deny him the money. Then he can no 
longer exercise the power, and he must 
withdraw our forces. That is exactly 
what the Senator from Oregon is telling 
us. 
The Gulf of Tonkin action has no 
role with reference to the action subse-
quently taken. At that time we were 
reacting to an attack upon American per-
sonnel and equipment. Our ships were 
In the Gulf of Tonkin. Since that time, 
and specifically from February to June 
of 1965, we have been engaged in com-
bat operations. We are no longer ad-
vising; we are in direct combat opera-
tions in South Vietnam with organized 
American forces. I respectfully submit 
that this is an entirely different policy 
decision from the decision which au-
thored the Gulf of Tonkin resolution. 
Therefore, I am speaking today to ex-
plain why I back the actions of the Pres-
ident to date and to give notice why I 
may refuse to back him tomorrow. 
Incidentally, I think there is a rather 
broad feeling pretty much along this line 
throughout the country. That is why 
the President has been making all the 
statements he has made?and quite 
properly?about his willingness to nego-
tiate without conditions and about the 
limited purpose and the limited means 
he proposes to use to attain that pur-
pose. But it is extremely important that 
the President should at no time mask his 
purposes. Consistent with the national 
security and with the way this matter is 
being handled, the President has a duty 
to the country and to Congress to at no 
time mask his purposes. We ought to 
know at all times exactly what his pur-
pose is, if we are called upon to support 
that purpose. I think the President 
would do well to associate himself with 
Congress. Personally, I believe he is 
making a great mistake in not again 
coming to Congress and asking for a 
resolution of support. By coming to 
Congress again with a resolution, he 
would thereby give us an opportunity to 
support his present policy in a formal 
and direct way, and not force us to ex-
press approval or disapproval through 
other legislative means. 
Therefore, when I vote in favor of this 
authorization bill, I am not reaffirming 
the joint resolution of August 1964 nor 
rejecting it. New policy support should 
necessitate a new resolution. Without 
such a resolution, I am left with no al-
ternative but to protest against future 
Presidential actions in Vietnam through 
the authorization and appropriations 
process, that is, through the back door. 
And on behalf of the people of my State, 
I shall protest should any policy go be-
yond limited military means and objec-
tives. 
The final question, then, is, why do I 
support the President as far as he has 
gone? I do support him, and I shall 
vote that way, and shall know what I am 
voting for when I vote. The President 
has expressed a willingness to negotiate 
unconditionally. I believe, as I have 
said in a previous speech, that if we ac-
tually get a chance for peace talks, the 
President will, as Averell L. Harriman 
indicated, recognize the National Libera-
tion Front of the Vietcong as a party to 
the negotiations. I am against the idea 
that they should be included in a coali-
tion government before negotiations. 
A second element of the President's 
policy, as I understand it, is that he is 
applying limited means to a limited pur-
pose. In other words, he is not asking 
Congress for general mobilization. He 
assures us that he is not prejudicially 
draining down the forces of the United 
States that are charged with responsi-
bilities around the world; but that he is 
utilizing forces which are available to 
the United States for this purpose, and 
that the purpose is solely to bring about 
sufficient pacification of major popula-
tion concentrations in South Vietnam to 
enable that country to proceed to free 
elections and self-determination. 
I think this is a very exciting day. It 
indicates the complete maturity of our 
country when not only the President, but 
also Senators like the Senator from 
Georgia [Mr. RUSSELL], can say that if 
In free elections, after a reasonable pac-
ification period insuring the elections 
will really be free, the Vietnamese decide 
they want a Communist government, 
that is what they will have. We cer-
tainly will not stand in the way of free 
elections. This is an extremely impor-
tant and most mature declaration of pol-
icy on the part of very important people 
in our country. 
There is one ambiguous point in the 
President's declaration to date. The dif-
ficulty is that the President seems con-
tent to carry around in his pocket a worn 
copy of the August 1964 joint resolution. 
The President may further wrongly as-
sume that a vote for this authorization 
bill is an endorsement of any future 
actions. 
Perhaps that is the real essence of the 
argument of the Senator from Oregon 
[Mr. Moasa], and of the previous argu-
ments which I have heard him make?
and he knows that I have the highest re-
spect for his judgment in the matter. I 
have debated as an administration de-
fender in this particular matter. I speak 
in the role of a liberal, although the gen-
eral liberal community is considered to 
be unafavorable to what the Government 
is doing in Vietnam. I do not agree with 
that because it seems to me to be anoma-
lous that the liberal community of the 
United States should not recognize a 
struggle for freedom, as this one is, in 
my judgment, within the conditions I 
have described. Nonetheless, that is so. 
So I have engaged in these debates. 
And I recognize the problem of escala-
tion. We are always faced with the 
problem that if we put in another 100,000 
men, the other side will put in another 
100,000; then it will be increased 100,000 
beyond that. Then we shall move into 
Cambodia, into North Vietnam, and into 
Laos; or *e may take some other overt 
action against Communist Chinese in-
stallations, and the fat will then be in the 
fire. 
But I do not conceive of that at all 
within the authority which I would be 
voting the President by supporting the 
bill to authorize $4.7 billion in additional 
appropriations. I do not believe, from 
everything that he has shown to date, 
that the President will construe our ac-
tion in that way. I believe we are mak-
ing a pact with him based exactly on 
what he has said. I make the urgent plea 
in terms of penalty, of being a grievous, 
deep offense in this country, that if the 
President wishes to espouse another 
policy which goes beyond the present 
deployment of our forces, the President, 
because he has now opened the door by 
the joint resolution of August 1964, 
should again come back to Congress for 
a new declaration of policy. 
If there is any escalation beyond that 
point, then all of the arguments which 
have been made with reference to the 
escalation become relevant and 
pertinent. 
I believe I have stated the situation 
thoroughly. It is my judgment that if 
the President sticks to his peace offensive, 
If he sticks to the limited purpose which 
he has described to us, and the means 
which he has described to us, those mis-
sions will accomplish that purpose. 
This particular appropriation, it seems 
to me, has as its base the testimony of 
the Secretary of Defense, found at page 
55 of the hearings. 
I believe that to be so important that-I 
hope my colleagues will indulge me as I 
read it into the RECORD.

in the Army, or the Navy, or the Air Force 
as well as personnel to take care of the ad-

ditions to the total LT.S. military force and 
It is not possible to say that any of those 
in particular will be used In South. Vietnam, 
but, In the net, all of them are being added 
because of the South Vietnam conflict. 
Mr. President, we have a right to as-
sume that the order of magnitude we are 
talking about in this supplementary ap-
propriation is approximately 450,000 
personnel. The exact number is not 
material. 
T am satisfied, as one Senator, that 
this kind of deployment in South Viet-
nam is enough, and that we will .not have 
to go in for a general mobilization. We 
should not prejudicially drain the per-
eonnel available for our responsibilities 
around the world; We can do the limited 
job in South Vietnam described by the 
President with the presently projected 
force level. 
With my eyes wide open, I am pre-
pared to support that kind of effort. My 
reason is twofold: First, we must show 
that wars of national liberation, so-
called euphemistically by the Com-
munists, do not work. Even if they were 
to work, T do not believe in the domino 
theory. It will not be Malaya, Burma, 
or Thailand tomorrow, but it may very 
well be S or 10 Latin American countries, 
or 4 or 5 African countries, or 3 or 4 
countries in the Middle East. 
The Communists will try this ap - 
preach wherever they can because it will 
he a formula that worki. We shall have 
ehowit our inability to deal with it. 
In terms of averting World War III, 
it is so critically important that we show 
our ability to deal with these guerrilla 
wars, that I believe that every American 
boy who falls in Vietnam is as much a 
hero as any boy who fought the Kaiser 
in World War I or Hitler in World 
War 
Before I conclude, I shall read a letter 
which made my hair stand up. I believe 
that it will have the same effect on 
everyone else. 
My second point is that in our great 
struggle with communism, the difference 
between the Soviet, Union and Com-
munist China is that the Communist 
Chinese think that in order to prevail, 
they most exterminate a good part of 
mankind. 
The Soviet Union believes, and I think 
this is fairly clear from their policy, that 
they can outcompete the free world. 
We very much prefer the latter kind 
of policy and welcome the competition 
on these grounds. We are ardent rooters 
for the latter because we think we can 
do mighty well ourselves. However, the 
Soviet Union is now engaged in this 
struggle in Vietnam up to its neck. Why? 
Because it is still placing its leadership 
of the Communist world on a higher 
priority than it places the effort to ar-
rive at a detente or coexistence with the 
United States and the rest of the world. 
I want to change that priority. The 
only way to avoid world war III and to 
change that priority is to show the Com-
munist Chinese that the Soviet Union 
scheme of peaceful competition is better 
than the risks of war. 
I consider that what has been done 
in South Vietnam, regardless of whether 
I would have gone there in the first place, 
or whether it is the best place for the 
confrontation?and there will be a lot 
of argument about that?is now a fact. 
The situation is there. It makes little 
some to rehash past mistakes. 
I believe that we must ultimately find a 
way to gel; along with Communist China. 
The alternative is ever-increasing risks 
of war through miscalculation. The co-
existence idea must prevail, rather than 
the extermination idea which prevails 
presently among the Communist bloc. 
It is for those reasons that I shall sup-
port the request for the appropriation 
now, without any assurance that I would 
do so tomorrow. 
Mr. President, it is also for Haase rea-
sons that 71  shall oppose the amendment 
of the senior Senator from Oregon. 
I think ii is most unfortunate that, be-
cause of the disputes and the differences 
and the unhappiness in many quarters, 
especially ,n very articulate quatters, in 
the newspapers, the press, the radio, and 
television, there is some feeling that the 
boys who are fighting in Vietnam are not 
quite earning the kind of gratitude, un-
derstanding, and appreciation frem the 
American people as did those who fought 
in World Wars I and H. This is a very 
unhappy and most unfortunate situa-
tion. 
I hope very much that whatew sr may 
be our view upon this situation?and I 
certainly have frankly expressed 
nine?
that we will give recognition to those who 
are encountering the terrible dangers in-
volved in this struggle. We have ex-
tended such recognition from our hearts 
for the patriotism of Sc many others 
around the world. 
Mr. President, I should like te close 
by reading a very brief note. I sent a 
letter of condolence to this family which 
lost a son, a lieutenant, in the action in 
Vietnam. 
The family wrote me as follows, the 
letter being signed by the members of 
the family: 
DEAR MR. AND MRS. JAVITLn Thank you for 
your letter of comfort in this tragic time. 
We have lost our only child, a woniierful, 
loving, devoted, dedicated. son. Be has left 
us with beautiful memories. Our hope is 
that all involved in the struggle for the 
freedom for which Joseph sacrificed his life 
will be channeled in the right direction be-
cause that sacrifice must not have been in 
vain. 
The letter is signed, "Sincerely, Joe 
and Pat De Gennaro." 
Mr. President, if I can help as a Sena-
tor, as a human being, I shall do every-
thing that I can. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
Senator from Montana. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, for 
the information of the Senate, it is my 
intention, at an appropriate time, to 
move to table the amendment offered by 
the distinguished Senator from Oregon 
[Mr. MORSE I. While the Senator's 
amendment is in order, of course, under 
the Senate rules, I feel that it is inap-
propriate and inadvisable in coiniection 
with this bill at this time. 
S. 2791, the pending business, la a mili-
tary "nut and bolts" measure. The ques-
tions involved in it are clear and tangi-
ble. Regardless of the Tonkin Bay reso-
lution we will have to dispose of this 
measure sooner or later. It is a bill which 
should stand alone and, in my judgment, 
should be considered on its own merit. I 
do not believe that any Member of the 
Senate wishes to delay the bill, as such, 
unduly. Difficulty has arisen here pri-
marily because S. 2791 has been given 
in the minds of some a significance which 
it does not possess. There arc many 
views, for example, on the precise mean-
ing of the Tonkin Bay resolution which 
the distinguished Senator from Oregon 
seeks to rescind by his amendment. 
They cannot be resolved, in my judg-
ment, through the vehicle of S. 2791 and 
so I shall move to table. If the Senator's 
amendment is tabled, it will have the 
effect of keeping in force the Tonkin 
Gulf resolution as passed by the Senate 
on a rollcall vote of 88 to 2 in 1964. 
The prevailing constitutional situation 
will be unchanged. The significance of 
the Tonkin Gulf resolution will remain 
unchanged. It will still be as it is now, 
for each Senator in his own conscience 
to decide. The President believes that 
this resolution gives him some additional 
assurance, some authority in addition to 
that embodied in his constitutional posi-
tion as Commander in Chief. Obviously 
that is the case or he would not have 
asked for the resolution in the first place. 
But among Senators, I know, there has 
been a wide divergence of view as to 
what, if any, constitutional significance 
attaches to a resolution of this kind. 
Those divergencies will remain. Indeed, 
that has been the case with all these so-
called hand-upholding resolutions begin-
ning with the Eisenhower administra-
tion. 
Insofar as the leadership is concerned, 
however, a vote to table is most of all a 
vote to get on with the main business of 
S. 2791. It is also a vote to keep the 
Tonkin Gulf resolution in effect with 
whatever constitutional force it may 
have, even as a vote against tabling, as 
the distinguished Senator from Oregon 
has indicated, will result in its rescinding 
provided that the other House also 
agrees.

March 1, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 4199 
To that extent, the issue is clear even 
though this is not the appropriate way, 
in my opinion, to consider this matter. 
As long as it has come before the Senate, 
however, a choice will have to be made. 
We are in too deep now. The situation 
is one of the utmost delicacy and the 
risk of misinterpretation is very great. 
It is, in short, a situation which each 
Senator will have to face up to on the 
basis of his own convictions. 
Several Senators addressed the Chair. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. 
BAYH in the chair). The Senator from 
Washington is recognized. 
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield to the Sen-
ator from Washington. 
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. President, I 
should like to ask the distinguished lead-
er, is it his interpretation that his mo-
tion to table shall have the effect of reaf-
firming the Tonkin Gulf resolution? 
Mr. MANSFIELD. If the Senator was 
on the floor, he will recall that I said, 
in the course of my brief remarks, it 
meant that the Tonkin Gulf resolution 
would still be in effect. 
Mr. JACKSON. Mr. President, my 
only concern is that I think, after this 
long debate on the floor, it would be un-
fortunate if we came out of our delibera-
tions with muted decisions. While a bill 
of this sort is not necessarily the place 
to offer this kind of amendment, I think 
the country is entitled to know the posi-
tion of the Senate on Vietnam. I am 
very pleased that the majority leader 
makes that interpretation in offering his 
motion to table. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I appreciate the 
remarks of the Senator from Washing-
ton, and again call to his attention what 
I previously said: 
Insofar as the leadership is concerned, 
however, a vote to table is roost of all a vote 
to get on with the main business of S. 2791. 
It is also a vote to keep the Tonkin Gulf 
resolution in effect with whatever constitu-
tional force it may have, even as a vote 
against tabling, as the distinguished Senator 
from Oregon has indicated, could well result 
in its rescinding, provided that the other 
House also agrees. 
I yield to the distinguished minority 
leader. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, this 
entire matter had long discussion be-
fore the majority leader came in and his 
question as to whether or not there would 
be a vote directly on the Morse amend-
ment or on the motion to table came up. 
There was some apprehension that a vote 
on the motion to table might leave some 
misapprenhension or misimpression 
abroad. 
In all kindliness, I say to my distin-
guished friend the Senator from Oregon 
that I wish to make clear that the posi-
tion of the minority?and I think I 
speak for most of them?is that we com-
pletely separate ourselves from the views 
expressed by the distinguished Senator 
from Oregon, both in committee and on 
the floor, and that if those views are 
something of a symbol in southeast Asia, 
we wish to do what we can to destroy 
that symbol as a reflection of the views 
of the American people. 
So when we vote for the motion to 
table?and the majority leader informed 
me this morning that he intended to 
make that motion?I wish to say for my 
part, to my fellow Senators and to all the 
wide world, that what we are trying to 
do is get on with the serious business, the 
undramatic business of this struggle in 
Vietnam and wind up as quickly as pos-
sible, and to supply the American troops 
with whatever is necessary to do a com-
plete and final job. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield to the 
Senator from Wyoming. 
Mr. McGEE. Mr. President, I am 
happy that the majority leader has 
moved to table the amendment of the 
Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. No; I will move. 
Mr. McGEE. Will move to table it. 
I, too, however, express concern over 
how the vote on that matter will be inter-
preted. People sometimes have difficulty, 
I think, understanding a parliamentary 
move on the floor of the Senate. As a 
matter of fact, if I may say so, there is 
sometimes some disagreement among 
Senators as to what their votes mean. It 
is no wonder that beyond our shores, 
there is occasionally confusion as to the 
meaning of an action taken by the U.S. 
Senate. 
For that reason, I think we should be 
under no illusions about what will be said 
about a Senate vote this afternoon to 
table the amendment of the Senator from 
Oregon. If that motion is indeed agreed 
to, as I am sure it will be, I trust that it 
will be understood that this is in no 
sense a diminution of the Tonkin resolu-
tion, that this is in no sense a back-
handed slap at an existing policy posi-
tion. I think we should make it unal-
terably clear, especially to the aggres-
sors, that this has no significance for 
them that could be equated with a re-
traction or withdrawal or some other 
form of weakness. I think it is impor-
tant that we make that clear because 
there are those who press against their 
restraints as they seek a sign of weak-
ness, as they probe for soft spots of which 
they can make the maximum psycho-
logical use. 
I personally believed that the Gulf of 
Tonkin resolution was very clear at the 
time it was passed. I did not think I 
was confused about it, and do not think 
I am now, but I do respect those who are 
raising questions, and I think as we vote 
on the motion which will be made by 
the majority leader to table the rescind-
ing proposal of the Senator from Oregon, 
that we still should make clear on the 
Memo) that we are taking two actions. 
Those who believe with him that we 
should rescind the August 1964 resolu-
tion should stand up and be counted. 
I think that is their free right to expres-
sion, and I think it is a part of our sys-
tem. I think it is a part of the risk that 
we have to afford in our kind of society. 
But for the others, I desperately hope 
than an overwhelming vote to table will 
mean exactly what it says, that there is 
no intention on the part of the Members 
of the Senate to in any way detract, by 
that vote, from the President's position 
in southeast Asia. I think that must be 
made unequivocally clear, that no ag-
gressors should take comfort in it, that 
no psychological warriors may seek to 
exploit it beyond its real meaning. 
If we take those precautions, I think 
we will be, in a sense, sustaining, in 
effect strengthening and reaffirming the 
role of the President himself as Com-
mander in Chief. 
This is a technique used many, many 
times in our history by our Commander 
in Chief. I only hope that the parlia-
mentary maneuver does not lend itself 
to a negative interpretation, or to a 
weakened response. Let the aggressors, 
I say, stand on notice that the Senate is, 
indeed, with the President on the ques-
tion of aggression. 
I wish to thank the majority leader 
for yielding to me at this time. 
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I wish to 
make a few brief remarks about the 
amendment offered by the Senator from 
Oregon which I shall oppose because it 
has no current relevance. I have taken 
no time on the bill, and do not intend to 
do so. However, first I should like to 
take this opportunity to commend the 
Senator from Arkansas [Mr. FULBRIGHT], 
and the Committee on Foreign Relations, 
for the great contributon he and the 
committee have made to the dialog 
concerning the issue which now con-
fronts the country. 
Far too little credit has been given to 
the chairman of that committee, and to 
the committee itself, for the great con-
tribution to the public education they 
have made. 
I have had occasion twice to be back 
in my own State. I have no notion, no 
judgment, and no guess as to whether 
it changed the viewpoints of the people 
in the country on balance; but I do know 
that It was the first time in the history 
of our involvement in South Vietnam 
that the people of this country have had 
an opportunity to hear the experts rep-
resenting diverse viewpoints intelligently 
discuss the subject on television in their 
homes. 
I read a number of columnists who de-
clared that no one learned anything as 
a result of the hearings. Well, Mr. Presi-
dent, of course Mr. McNamara did not 
learn anything. He did not pick up any 
new facts, and neither did the chairman 
of the committee nor those in the Con-
gress and of the press who have made it 
their business to study the issue. But 
the general public learned a great deal. 
Tragically, Congress has permitted al-
most 2 years to pass by without adequate-
ly discussing what is involved in south-
east Asia. In my opinion the lack of 
debate and discussion is what has caused 
the confusion and misunderstanding in 
this country. 
The contribution to this debate of the 
hearings in the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee has been of great value and sig-
nificance, and I wish to commend the 
chairman and the committee. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, will 
the Senator from Wisconsin yield just 
briefly? 
Mr. NELSON. I am glad to yield to 
the Senator from Arkansas. 
Mr. FLTLBRIGHT. First, I appreciate 
what the Senator said. I have already 
said publicly that I believe one of the

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE March 1, 1966 
most serious mistakes I have made as 
chairman was in not accepting or urging 
the Senate to accept the amendment of-
fered by the Senator from Wisconsin in 
August 1964. I do not believe it is proper, 
and do not wish to take the time to ex-
plain the circumstances of that particu-
lar moment, but, nevertheless, I believe 
it was a mistake and I commend the Sen-
ator from Wisconsin for having more 
foresight than I had at that time, and 
think many other Senators, as to the 
possible significance of that resolution. 
He did offer a very sensible, limiting 
amendment to that resolution, and I re-
'ret that we did not have the kind of 
discussion of it in public at that time 
that we have had recently. But I do 
commend the Senator from Wisconsin 
for his foresightedness and regret that 
I did not have as much. 
Mr. NELSON. I believe that the Sen-
ator advised me at that time that his 
interpretation of the resolution was the 
same as the purpose of my amendment, 
and that therefore the amendment was 
unnecessary. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. I thought it was. 
Mr, NELSON, I also wish to commend 
those who have participated in this de-
bate on both sides of the aisle. 
Although very frequently I do not 
agree with the Senator from Oregon, I 
should like to say that he has made a 
most valuable contribution to this dis-
cussion?and he will continue to do so. 
One thing, however, that disturbs me 
very much is the argument I have heard 
advanced in the press, by columnists, 
by distinguished Members of Congress, 
and people in the executive branch, that 
we should not be debating this issue 
because what we say here, in our free 
country, will be misunderstood by some 
Communists in. some other country, 
Communists who do not know what free 
speech is all about and never will. 
Mr. President, this is the greatest par-
liamentary body in the world. It is the 
oldest parliamentary body in the world. 
Its function and purpose is constructive 
debate. The strength of this Nation is 
measured by its capacity for intelligent 
debate, not by its ability to goosestep. 
hope we do not undermine that source 
of our power. I have heard it implied 
here and elsewhere lately that free 
speech and dissent should stop because 
it may be misunderstood in Communist 
countries. This is a dangerous parallel 
to the theory that was recently used by 
the Russian court in sentencing two 
writers to jail, not because of what they 
said in Russia but because they pub-
lished books in this country which the 
Russians thought would be misunder-
stood in America and damage Russia. 
On that theory the Russian court sen-
tenced the writers to jail. 
Over here, we have people saying that 
we should stop debate because someone 
else who cannot understand the debate 
might misunderstand our resolve and 
damage America. 
Mr. President, freedom is what democ-
racy is all about. If some foreign dicta-
tor does not understand it, that is too 
bad. I have no intention of giving up my 
freedom of speech because some Commu-
nist does not understand what free 
speech is all about--and never will. 
Regarding the Tonkin Bay resolution, 
let me comment briefly. It has been re-
peatedly stated by those who unquali-
fiedly support the Tonkin Bay resolu-
tion that there were only two Senators 
who had any reservations about it. 
Mr. President, I had reservations 
about that resolution and I made them 
clear. I was in the Chamber on August 
6, August 7, and August 8, and partici-
pated in the dialog concerning the reso-
lution, as did several other Senators, who 
also expressed grave reservations about 
the resolution. Their remarks were in-
tended to interpret that resoletion and 
demonstrate congressional intent. 
I discussed the subject on three dif-
ferent days with the chairme o of the 
Foreign Relations Committee, and I am 
a little weary of having my vete inter-
preted as an unqualified endmaement of 
escalation. The record will show it was 
not such an endorsement. 
The chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee was in the Chamber?the 
Senator from. Arkansas (Mr. Pm .sinstrrl , 
as th.e spokesman for the administra-
tion As a U.S. Senator, I was entitled 
to accept his advice, counsel, and inter-
pretation of that resolution as an ex-
pression of the intent of the adminis-
tration. 
Mr. President, I shall not i sad the 
whole dialog, but I will read a Fart of it 
from the REcoin of August 6 anti 7, 1964, 
as follows. Addressing myself to the 
chairman of the Foreign Relatio.o; Com-
mittee: 
But I am concerned about the Congress 
appearing to te:il the executive bra ach and 
the public that we would endorse a iiomplete 
change in our mission. That would concern 
me. 
Mr,. Purinsiduir. I do not iaterpret ,ihe joint 
resolution in that way at all. It str ikes me, 
as I understand it, that the joint riesolution 
is quite consistent with our existing mission 
and our understanding of what ,ae have 
been doing in South Vietnam for the last 
10 years. 
Skipping some of it, 1 addrea;ed the 
chairman once more, as follows: 
in view of the differine interpratations 
which have been put upon the joint resolu-
tion with respect to what the sense ..,if Con-
gress is, I should like to have this point 
clarified. I have great confidence in the 
President. However, my concern is hat we 
in Congress could give th.e impression to 
the public that we are prepared at this time 
to change our mission and iiubstantiAlly ex-
pand our commitment. If that is what the 
sense of Congress is, I am opposed to the 
resolution. I therefore ask the distinguished 
Senator from Arkansas if he would consent 
to accept an amendment, a copy of which I 
have supplied him. I shall read it into 
the RECORD: 
"On page 2, line 3, alter the word, "Mat' 
insert '(a) '. 
"On page 2, between lines 6 and 7, insert 
the following: 
" '(b) The Congress also approves mid sup-
ports the efforts of the President--
This was the amendment to the Ton-
kin Bay resolution?
to bring the problem of peace in southeast 
Asia to the Security Council of the United 
Nations, and the President's declaration that 
the United States,, seeking no extension of 
the present military conflict, will respond to 
provocation in a manner that is "limited and 
fitting". Our continuing policy is to limit 
our role?
Listen to these words?
to the provision of aid, training eseistance, 
and military advice, and it is the sense of 
Congress that, except when provoked to a 
greater response, we should continue to at-
tempt to avoid a direct military involvement 
in the southeast Asian conflict'." 
This amendment is not an interference 
with the exercise of the President's constitu-
tional rights. It is merely an expression of 
the sense of Congress. Would the Senator 
accept the amendment? 
Mr. FULDRIGHT. It states fairly accurately 
what the President has said would be our 
policy, and what I stated my understanding 
was as to our policy; also what other Sena-
tors have stated. 
? 
I do not object to it as a statement of 
policy. I believe it is an accurate reflection 
of what I believe is the President's policy, 
judging from his own statements. That 
does not mean that as a practical matter I 
can accept the amendment. It would delay 
flatters to do so. It would cause confusion 
and require a conference, and present us 
with all the other difficulties that are in-
volved in this kind of legislative aiition. I 
regret that I cannot do it, even though I do 
not at all disagree with the amendment as a 
general statement of policy. 
I would think that ought to be a suffi-
cient answer to those who have repeat-
edly insisted that the Tonkin resolution 
was a blank check. It was not. I had 
reservations. So did others. I was as-
sured that we were not changing our 
role in southeast Asia. We have changed 
it. Obviously we cannot turn back the 
clock. But I trust that, for the cake of 
the historical record this may correct 
those gross misinterpretations of the 
record which have been so frequently 
uttered on the floor and elsewhere in 
recent months. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed extracts of the 
statement to which I previously referred. 
There being no objection, the extract 
was ordered to be printed in the Recons, 
as follows: 
But I am concerned about the Congress 
appearing to tell the executive bramh and 
the public that we would endorse a complete 
change in our mission. That would concern 
me. 
Mr. FULDRIGIIT. I do not interpret the joint 
resolution in that way at all. It strikes me, 
as I understand it, that the joint resolution 
is quite consistent with our existing mission 
and our understanding of what we have been 
doing in South Vietnam for the last 10 years. 
(August 7, 1964) 
INTERPRETATION 
Mr. NELSON. Mr. President, I have reed the 
RECORD. There was some colloquy on the 
floor yesterday. I noticed that every Senator 
who spoke had his own personal Interpreta-
tion of what the joint resolution means. 
One Senator yesterday stated for the REC-
ORD that he understands the resolution to 
mean that there will be no more privileged 
sanctuaries, 
Another Senator interprets the resolution 
to mean that it would authorize the Chief 
Executive to eliminate any aggression, I ature 
and present. Some Senators interpret this 
language to mean aggression against South 
Vietnam; others interpret it to mean aggres-
sion directly against our military forces,

Another Senator interpreted the joint res-
olution to mean that it is the sense of Con-
gress that no change is suggested by Con-
gress in the present mission in South 
Vietnam?the mission that has been ours for 
10 years, which is to supply advisers, tech-
nical advice, and materiel, for the purpose 
of attempting to encourage the establishment 
of an independent, viable regime, so that we 
can withdraw our forces; and that it has not 
been our mission in the past 10 years to sub-
stitute our military forces for the South 
Vietnamese forces, nor to join with them in 
a land war, nor to fight their battle for them, 
nor to substitute our Government for theirs. 
This 10-year-old limited mission can, be 
legitimately defended as a responsibility of 
ours to assist free and independent nations; 
and it can be legitimately questioned, too, be-
cause of the geographic location of that mis-
sion. 
In any event, I am most disturbed to see 
that there is no agreement in the Senate on 
what the joint resolution means. I would 
like to see it clarified. 
NELSON'S AMENDMENT 
Mr. NELSON. In view of the differing in-
terpretations which have been put upon the 
joint resolution with respect to what the 
sense of Congress is, I should like to have this 
point clarified. I have great confidence in 
the President. However, my concern is that 
we in Congress could give the impression to 
the public that we are prepared at this time 
to change our mission and substantially ex-
pand our commitment. If that is what the 
sense of Congress is, I am opposed to the 
resolution. I therefore ask the distinguished 
Senator from Arkansas if he would consent to 
accept an amendment, a copy of which I have 
supplied him. I shall read it into the 
RECORD: 
"On page 2, line 3, after the word 'That' 
insert (a) '. 
"On page 2, between lines 6 and 7, insert 
the following: 
"(b) The Congress also approves and sup-
ports the efforts of the President to bring the 
problem of peace in southeast Asia to the 
Security Council of the United Nations, and 
the President's declaration that the United 
States, seeking no extension of the present 
military conflict, will respond to provoca-
tion in a manner that is 'limited and fitting'. 
Our continuing policy is to limit our role 
to the provision of aid, training assistance, 
and military advice, and it is the sense of 
Congress that, except when provoked to a 
greater response, we should continue to at-
tempt to avoid a direct military involvement 
in the southeast Asian conflict,'" 
This amendment is not an interference 
with the exercise of the President's constitu-
tional rights. It is merely an expression of 
the sense of Congress. Would the Senator 
accept the amendment? 
Mr. FULDRIGHT. It states fairly accurately 
what the President has said would be 
our policy, and what I stated my under-
standing was as to our policy; also what 
other Senators have stated. In other words, 
it states that our response should be ap-
propriate and limited to the provocation, 
which the Senator states as "respond to 
provocation in a manner that is limited and 
fitting," and so forth. We do not wish any 
political or military bases there. We are not 
seeking to gain a colony. We seek to insure 
the capacity of these people to develop along 
the lines of their own desires, independent 
of domination by communism. 
The Senator has put into his amendment 
a statement of policy that is unobjection-
able. However, I cannot accept the amend-
ment under the circumstances. I do not 
believe it is contrary to the joint resolution, 
but it is an enlargement. I am informed 
that the House is now voting on this re,so-
No. 36-8 
lution. The House joint resolution is about 
to be presented to us. I cannot accept the 
amendment and go to conference with it, 
and thus take responsibility for delaying 
matters. 
I do not object to it as a statement of 
policy. I believe it is an accurate reflection 
of what I believe is the President's policy, 
judging from his own statements. That does 
not mean that as a practical matter I can 
accept the amendment. It would delay mat-
ters to do so. It would cause confusion and 
require a conference, and present us with all 
the other difficulties that are involved in this 
kind of legislative action. I regret that I 
cannot do it, even though I do not at all dis-
agree with the amendment as a general 
statement of policy. 
Mr. PULBRIGHT. Mr. President, in 
that connection, I certainly agree with 
what the Senator from Wisconsin has 
said. He is right to have made it. I 
have stated that I understood, from the 
information that was given to us, a spe-
cific incident was presented as the reason 
for that resolution. It was that a direct 
attack had been made on our ships on 
the high seas?this is what we were 
told?where they had a right to be. 
We were told it was an unprovoked 
attack. In other words, we had not done 
anything that properly could be consid-
ered as provocation. These facts are 
difficult for a committee or any of us 
to check. I think we were told things 
happened at night and things were mov-
ing rapidly, and so on. 
I had no reason to doubt the factual 
situation. On the other hand, it is ex-
tremely difficult to prove what happened. 
In any event, the Senator from Wis-
consin has certainly stated very clearly 
what the situation was. We all know the 
President has, without any resolution, 
the right to respond to an immediate 
attack. He has the right to take actions 
of a temporary nature, one might say, 
to protect our interests. Then at some' 
point, if hostilities continue, if the Con-
stitution means anything, a declaration 
of war should be sought. 
I will leave it to Senators, the manager 
of the bill, the administration, whether 
or not we are now at war. This bill and 
other events would indicate we are. I 
have discussed this matter with some of 
those who have responsibility in this 
area. They are reluctant to do what I 
have suggested. I am not at all sure, if 
we continue along the course we are fol-
lowing, it will not be necessary to impose 
powers and disciplines and controls upon 
our economy sooner or later. We cannot 
carry on this kind of conflict and call 
it a skirmish. So this is a matter I think 
the administration should be giving 
thought to. 
I have a few remarks to make gener-
ally about the situation, in addition to 
the pending measure, but I want to join 
the Senator from Wisconsin in paying 
tribute to the Senator from Oregon for 
the analysis he presented to the Senate 
last Friday, particularly with regard to 
the legal basis for our involvement in 
Vietnam. I think he did the finest job 
of research, of putting together and pull-
ing together the various aspects concern-
ing Vietnam, particularly the shifting 
basis upon which the administration has 
presented its case. First they said that 
action was not based on SEATO, then 
that it was, and so on. I shall not take 
the time to elaborate; I only recommend 
a reading of the Senator's speech by 
anyone who is interested in following the 
origin and legal basis of the Vietnam 
situation. It is difficult for people who 
do not make it their business to follow 
these matters to understand the issue. 
I think this fact lies at the root of much 
of the confusion in the country as to why 
we are involved, how we got in that war. 
To them I recommend a reading of the 
analysis made by the Senator from Ore-
gon. 
I wish to say a few words generally 
about the southeast Asia situation and 
a few words about the pending measure. 
In a book written in 1898 called "The 
Mysterious Stranger," Mark Twain, one 
of our greatest writers, for whom all 
Members here have admiration; I do 
not know of anyone who does not?who 
had a genius for understanding human 
nature and presenting it in printed form, 
wrote the following on war. I read a 
paragraph: 
There has never been a just one, never an 
honorable one?on the part of the instigator 
of the war. I can see a million years ahead 
and this rule will never change in so many 
as half a dozen instances. The loud 'little 
handful?as usual?will shout for the war. 
The pulpit will?warily and cautiously?
object?at first; the great, big, dull bulk of 
the Nation will rub its sleepy eyes and try 
to make out why there should be a war and 
will say, earnestly and indignantly, "It is 
unjust and dishonorable and there is no 
necessity for it." Then the handful will 
shout louder. A few fair men on the other 
side will argue and reason against the war 
with speech and pen, and at first will have 
a hearing and be applauded, but it will not 
last long; those others will outshout them, 
and presently the antiwar audiences will 
thin out and lose popularity. Before long 
you will see this curious thing: the speakers 
stoned from the platform, and free speech 
strangled by hordes of furious men who in 
their secret hearts are still at one with those 
stoned speakers?as earlier?but do not dare 
to say so. And now the whole Nation?
pulpit and all?will take up the warcry and 
shout itself hoarse, and mob any honest man 
who ventures to open his mouth, and 
presently such mouths will cease to open. 
Next the statesmen will invent cheap lies, 
putting the blame upon the nation that is 
attacked, and every man will be glad of those 
conscience-soothing fantasies and will dili-
gently study them, and refuse to examine 
any refutations of them, and thus he will by 
and by convince himself that the war is just 
and will thank God for the better sleep he 
enjoys after this process of grotesque self-
deception. (Mark Twain, "The Mysterious 
Stranger," 1898.) 
Past experience provides little basis 
for confidence that reason can prevail 
in an atmosphere of mounting war fever.

the hawk has a great advantage, not

1202 CONGRESSIONAL RECOE D ? SENATE March 1, i; 
charged atmosphere in which the Viet-
namese war is now being discussed. In-
stead of trading epithets about the legit-
imacy of debate and about who is and is 
not giving "aid and comfort" to the 
enemy, we would do well to focus calmly 
and deliberately on the issue itself, rec-
ognizing that all of us make mistakes and 
that mistakes can only be corrected if 
they are acknowledged and discussed, 
and recognizing further that war is not 
its own justification, that it can and must 
be discussed unless we are prepared to 
sacrifice our traditional democratic, proc-
esses to a false image of national 
unanimity. 
That is largely what these hearings 
the Senator from Wisconsin referred to 
were all about. 
The issue underlying our vote on the 
military supplemental authorization now 
before the Senate is not whether, but 
how, to bring about an early and honor-
able end to the war in Vietnam. I em-
phasize "underlying" because later I shall 
state clearly that this particular bill 
should not be interpreted as a policy 
statement. I know that it may be and 
the Senator from Oregon stated it will 
be, but I shall refer to the statements of 
the chairman of the committee who in-
troduced it. 
Since I have properly been held re-
sponsible for some things that I said 
in regard to the 1964 resolution, I think 
we are entitled to rely on the statement 
made by the chairman of the Armed 
Services Committee as to the effect of 
this bill. 
Thoreau'. vigorous differences of opin-
ion as to whether an early and honorable 
peace is more likely to be gained by 
intensifying the war or by reducing its 
scale, but no responsible participants in 
the debate have advocated either expand-
ing the conflict into a general war with 
China or an unconditional and disorderly 
withdrawal of American forces from 
Vietnam. nivided though we are, there-
fore, with respect to means, there re-
mains a powerful consensus in support 
of the objective of an early and honor-
able peace. 
The Harris survey contained in the 
Washington Post on February 28 reports 
a growing consensus for peace along 
with a cowing division as to how to 
achieve it and a mounting uneasiness 
as to the continuation of the war. The 
lanais survey reports that the American 
people "are becoming split between those 
who favor an all-out military effort to 
shorten the war and those who prefer 
negotiation to the risk of escalation." 
The survey reports that no more than 
10 percent of the American people favor 
immediate withdrawal arid only about 
16 percent favor an all-out war against 
North Vietnam, leaving the great ma-
jority of our people in between, hopeful, 
that is, of an early and honorable end 
of the war but divided as to how it can 
be achieved. According to the Harris 
survey, this great majority who agree on 
the goal of peace are almost evenly 
divided as to how to attain it, with 33 per-
cent favoring an increased military effort 
and 34 percent favoring an accelerated 
effort to bring about negotiations. 
Discounting extreme points of view, as 
I think we can and must, the practical 
choice before us is between a policy of 
accelerated war confined to Vietnam but 
nonetheless aiming at total victory with-
in South Vietnam and a policy of de-
escalation. aimed at neogtiation and an 
accommodation among the parties to the 
South Vietnamese civil war. 
My own view is that the second course 
Is the wiser by far. I am in agreement 
with Mr. :Kerman, General Gavin, and 
General Ridgway, all of whore have indi-
cated that they favor a military policy 
of "making do with what we have" in 
South Vietnam until an honorable peace 
settlement can be negotiated.

(See exhibit 1.) 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. That letter was 
from General Ridgway, who was the 
Chief of Staff under General ,:lIlisenhower 
at the time of the 1954 tragedy 
shall try to explain why I believe that 
a policy of accommodation is preferable 
to a policy aimed at military victory, 
even a military victory confined within 
the limits of South Vietnam. I shall try 
also to suggest what seems to me to be 
the central requirement for an accom-
modation in southeast Asia. 
Hi story seldom if ever tells us exactly 
what we must do in specific situations, 
but it does provide guidance as to the 
kinds of policies that are likely to suc-
ceed and the kinds that are likely to fail. 
The experience of nations in the last 150 
Years leaves one in no doubt that gen-
erally policies of accommode lion make 
for m( ire durable peace :.ettlements 
whereas policies of total victory make for 
renewed conflict, usually ':,:enerating 
greater problems than they sol I com-
mend to the attention of my colleagues 
the following examples: 
In 1815, the great powers of Europe, 
led by the great conservatives. Lord Cas-
tlereagh of England and Prirwe Metter-
nich of Austria, granted terns of peace 
to a defeated and helpless France which 
can only be described by 20th-century 
standards as astonishingly generous. 
They did so despite the fact that France 
had conquered most of Europe and kept 
it in turmoil for a quarter of a century. 
Under the terms of peace, the French 
lost no territory at all that had been 
theirs before the Great RevolLtion, were 
subjected to a limited occupation of only 
3 years. and we:re compelled to make 
limited reparations and then were given 
assistance in paying them, with the re-
sult that France's financial obligations 
were liquidated within 4 years of the end 
of hostilities. 
Three years after the end of the Na-
poleonic Wars, France was brought into 
the concert of Europe as a full and equal 
great power. The conservative states-
men who made this generous peace did 
not do so out of love for a revolutionary 
and aggressive France but out of respect 
for the power and dynamism of the 
French nation. Wanting above all 
things peace and stability, Castlereagh 
and Metternich gave France a peace 
that she could endure. Castlereagh said 
that he had come to Vienna not to col-
lect trophies but "to bring the world 
back to peaceful habits." He was ad-
mirably successful. Not only was France 
reconciled with the nations that defeated 
her but never again after 1815 did 
France engage in major aggression and 
never again did she pose a major threat 
to the peace of Europe. 
Another example of a highly success-
ful peace based on accommodation came 
out of our own War of 1812. The Amer-
icans won a great victory over the Brit-
ish at New Orleans, but the victory did 
not win the war because the Treaty of 
Ghent which ended the war had already 
been signed when the battle was fought. 
England at the time was at the peak of 
her power. Napoleon had already been 
defeated, the British fleet was unchal-
lenged on the seas, and undoubtedly, had 
they wished to do so, the British could 
have defeated the young American Na-
tion militarily and might even have 
brought it back into the British Empire. 
They had the generosity?and the wis-
dom?not to do so. Had the British tried 
to use their overwhelming power to re-
conquer America, they would probably 
have encountered fierce national resist-
ance by an aroused American people 
fighting for their own homes, their own 
towns, and their own farms. The Brit-
ish themselves had supported the 
Spanish in their successful guerrilla war 
against Napoleon and, powerful as they 
were, the British knew how hopeless it 
would be to try to subjugate a patriotic 
people determined to defend their in-
dependence. 
The Treaty of Ghent simply restored 
the status quo between America and 
England as it had existed before the war. 
There were no victor and no vanquished, 
and the issues that had set America 
against England remained unsolved. But 
what diplomacy did not resolve history 
did. Never again did England and 
America go to war; and in the 20th cen-
tury, confronted with new circumstances 
and new dangers, they have become each 
other's closest allies. It all began with 
the unpromising Treaty of Ghent. 
By contrast with the conflicts of the 
19th century, 20th century warfare has 
been marked by total victories and total 
defeats. The total victories of 1918 and 
1945 both generated more problems than 
they solved, sowing the seeds of new, 
unforeseen, and greater conflicts. These 
conflicts were generated by the totality of 
things?by the totality of violence in two

world wars and the totality of the vic-
tories that ended them. 
The harshness of the treaty of Ver-
sailles was more in its implementation 
than in its provisions. For many and 
complex reasons, the vindictive provi-
sions of the treaty, those pertaining to 
reparations and the occupation of Ger-
many, rather than the promising parts 
of the treaty, those pertaining to dis-
armament and the League of Nations, 
were most vigorously implemented in the 
1920's. The failure of the belligerents 
of World War I to reconcile in the 1920's 
was the most important single factor 
behind the rise of Hitler in the thirties. 
In short, the vindictiveness of World War 
I became the major cause of World War 
The cold war of the last 20 years was 
spawned by the total victory of 1945. 
The total destruction of German and 
Japanese power created a vacuum which 
was soon enough filled, quickly and eag-
erly by Russia and belatedly and reluc-
tantly by America. Had the generals 
who tried to kill Hitler in 1944 been suc-
cessful at that time or earlier, a nego-
tiated peace might conceivably have 
saved Germany from partition. It was 
the total defeat of Germany that re-
sulted in her division, and that division, 
the product of a total victory, became the 
paramount issue in a new, great, and 
still unresolved conflict, a conflict which 
could rise up, indeed, and cause us trou-
ble now. 
As we consider now whether we wish 
to bid for victory or accommodation in 
southeast Asia, we would do well to con-
sider the wisdom of a tragically prophetic 
letter written by Lord Lansdowne to the 
Daily Telegraph of London on November 
29, 1917. He wrote: 
We are going to win the war, * * * but its 
prolongation will spell the ruin of the civil-
ized world, and an infinite addition to the 
load of human suffering which already 
weighs upon it. Security will be invaluable 
to a world which has the vitality to profit 
by it, but what will be the value of the bless-
ings of peace to nations so exhausted that 
they can scarcely stretch out a hand with 
which to grasp them??Lord Newton, "Lord 
Lansdowne: A Biography" (London: Mac-
millan, 1929), page 467. 
The debate between those who would 
accelerate the war in Vietnam and those 
who would reduce its scale is as fateful 
and significant as any we had in the 
last two decades. There is a deceptive 
appeal about proposals for expanded 
military action; they are simple and 
clean cut and they seem to promise quick 
and easy solutions to difficult and pain-
ful problems. Proposals for accommo-
dation, on the other hand, as the Sen-
ator from New York has discovered, are 
complex, ambiguous and easily misun-
derstood. History, however, suggests 
that the military solution that seems so 
promising today is likely to result in dis-
aster tomorrow, whereas the course of 
accommodation, which always seems so 
difficult, is the only course with demon-
strated promise of being able to bring 
about a lasting and honorable peace. 
The essential principle of an accom-
modation in southeast Asia is that it 
must apply not just to Vietnam but to 
all of southeast Asia. Vietnam, after 
all, is only one of many small and weak 
nations on the periphery of a powerful 
China and, as has been pointed out in-
numerable times, what happens in one 
such country may well happen in an-
other. 
This premise underlies the domino 
theory, which holds that if one country 
falls to the Communists so must an-
other and then another. The inference 
we have drawn from this is that we must 
fight in one country in order to avoid 
having to fight in another, although we 
could with equal logic have inferred 
that it is useless to fight in one country 
when the same conditions of conflict are 
present in another, that the failure of 
subversion in one country might simply 
result in the transfer of subversion to 
another. Some of us can really see no 
reason why there should be considera-
tion of only one aspect of the so-called 
domino theory. 
History and logic and commonsense 
suggest that a viable settlement in Viet-
nam must be part of a general settle-
ment in southeast Asia. Unless we are 
prepared to fight a general war W elimi-
nate the effects of Chinese power in all 
of southeast Asia, we have no alterna-
tive but to seek a general accommoda-
tion. This is what really causes un-
easiness among most of us. The central 
issue is the contest between Chinese and 
American power; and the prospect for a 
lasting peace depends far more upon the 
resolution of that issue than it does on 
the matter of who is to participate in 
a South Vietnamese Government and 
by what means it shall be formed. If 
the issue between Chinese and American 
power in southeast Asia can be resolved, 
the future of Vietnam should not be too 
difficult to arrange, although it would 
involve some difficulty, of course; but if 
the issue of Chinese and American 
power is left unresolved, even a total 
victory in South Vietnam is unlikely to 
solve very much. As long as China and 
America are competitors for predomi-
nance?particularly military predomi-
nance?in southeast Asia, there can be 
no lasting peace or stability in that part 
of the world. 
Just as history suggests the advisabil-
ity of accommodation, it also offers guid-
ance as to the kind of accommodiation 
which might make for lasting peace in 
southeast Asia. In the past when great 
powers have competed for predominance 
over smaller and weaker nations, the one 
workable alternative to the victory of one 
or the other has been neutralization. In 
such arrangements, it is the fact of neu-
tralization rather than the political or 
Ideological complexion of the small coun-
tries concerned that has made for stabil-
ity and peace. Neutralization is not a 
foolproof method of resolving great 
power conflicts, but it is a demonstrably 
more successful one than total victory. 
Switzerland is an example. The Swiss 
Federation was established by the Con-
gress of Vienna in 1815 as a perpetually 
neutral state. To this day, despite the 
fact that she is surrounded by great 
powers, Switzerland remains both neu-
tral and at peace. 
Belgium was established as a perpetu-
ally neutral state under the guarantee of 
the great powers by a treaty signed in 
1839. The treaty was violated in 1914, 
but the more astonishing fact is that for 
75 years Belgium remained both neutral 
and at peace despite the ambitions of the 
great powers and despite her strategic 
location .between France and Germany, 
the latter baying been one of the most 
powerful nations in that area. Belgium 
might well have been the victim of great 
power ambitions, but neutralization 
made her instead the beneficiary of great 
power rivalry and also served as the 
means of regulating that rivalry. The 
solution lay quite simply in the fact that, 
hopeful as was each great power for its 
own hegemony, it was no less fearful 
of the hegemony of the other and neu-
tralization was judged to be the accept-
able price of its prevention. 
Austria is the outstanding contempo-
rary example of accommodation by neu-
tralization. Ten years after World War 
II Austria was divided and occupied by 
the great powers. The State Treaty of 
1955 laid the basis for the independent 
and prosperous national existence that 
Austria now enjoys and at the same 
time resolved a major issue between Rus-
sia and the West without upsetting the 
European balance of power. 
Applying historical experience, it seems 
to me that the crisis in southeast Asia 
can only be resolved on a lasting basis 
by the neutralization of the entire region 
as between China and the United States. 
China is profoundly fearful of American 
bases on her periphery; she demonstrat-
ed that by intervening in the Korean war 
in 1950 only when American troops ap-
proached her Manchurian frontier. 
Fearful as she is of American military 
power in southeast Asia, China might 
well be willing to purchase its removal by 
the exclusion of her own. It would seem 
to me highly advisable that, by one means 
or another, we indicate to the Chinese 
that we are prepared to remove American 
military power not only from Vietnam 
but from all of southeast Asia in return 
for a similar prohibition on her part. 
A general neutralization agreement for 
southeast Asia could be enforced in two 
ways. First, a degree of automatic en-
forcement would arise from the prospect 
that the reintroduction of Chinese mili-
tary power would be followed by the re-
introduction of American power. Sec-
ondly, a neutralization agreement could 
and should be placed under the guaran-
tee of the major powers with interests in 
the southeast Asia, notably the United 
States, China, the Soviet Union, Great 
Britain, France, India, and Japan. 
It is quite likely that the Chinese are 
not at present prepared to enter a neu-
tralization agreement. As long as the 
United States is expending more and 
more lives and more and more money in 
an ever widening but inconclusive war 
In Indochina, the Chinese can logically 
hope that the American people will soon-
er or later find the effort intolerable and 
force the withdrawal of U.S. forces from 
southeast Asia. 
As a matter of fact, that is what in 
effect happened in the Korean war. 
The American people got tired of the 
Korean war. The policy of growing in-
volvement that the United States is now

following in the apparent belief that it 
will persuade the Chinese of our deter-
mination to remain in southeast Asia 
may in fact have the opposite effect: 
it may persuade them, however wrongly, 
that the American people and their Gov-
ernment will sooner or later withdraw 
itheir support from an insupportable 
commitment and abandon southeast 
Asia to the unchallenged hegemony of 
China. 
Mr. Charles Taylor, a correspondent 
for the Toronto Globe and Mail, one of 
the few Westerners who have been al-
lowed to report from Peiping?and who 
was here in Washington at a meeting a 
few days ago?recently wrote of the 
Chinese: 
ft is a matter of faith with them that the 
Milted States can never win a land war in 
Asia and that for all its awesome power, 
the United States lacks the resources to 
light several revolutionary wars at the same 
time and will eventually be engulfed with-
out direct Chinese intervention. 
Mr. Taylor quotes the Peiping Review 
as saying: 
If South Vietnam alone is enough to keep 
the U.S. aggressor forces tied clown so hope-
lessly, one can easily visualize what is in 
store for Yankee imperialism once it gets 
tzelf entangled in other parts of Asia. 
What then can we do to induce China 
to pay the price of a neutralization 
agreement? What we can do, it seems 
to me, is to confront her with the per-
fectly credible prospect of being con-
fronted with that which she most fears, 
Which is to say, with permanent Ameri-
can military bases on her periphery. 
We can make the threat of permanent 
bases credible by reducing the cost of 
sustaining them to a level which the 
Chinese will know we can sustain indefi-
nitely. This, I think, is the implication 
of views put forth by such eminent in-
dividuals as George Kerman, Walter 
Lippmann, and Generals Gavin and 
Ridgway, each of whom has suggested 
that we confine our military efforts in 
Vietnam to "making do with what we 
have," or holding easily defensible forti-
fied bases somewhat like Guantanamo or 
Gibraltar, which has been held for some 
200 years, I believe, by the British. 
If we were to entrench ourselves in 
Powerful. bases on the coast of Vietnam 
or inland where appropriate, bases which 
could be held with minimal loss of life 
and at moderate cost, the Chinese would 
be confronted with a perfectly credible 
threat of permanent American bases on 
their periphery. Knowing that we could 
remain in these bases indefinitely, they 
would have a powerful inducement to 
seek an agreement for the neutralization 
of all of southeast Asia. At the very 
least, such a policy would convert a situ-
ation in which our enemies believe them-
seives to be wearing us down to one in 
which we, at supportable cost, would be 
wearing them down. 
The present policy of gradually ex-
panding warfare is costing the United 
States a tragic toll in lives, large and 
growing sums of money, and a world-
wide loss of prestige, including mounting 
disaffection on the part of those very 
allies to whom we are supposed to be 
proving our high determination. In ad-
dition, according to late information, the 
present policy seems to be costing our 
Goveinment the confidence of growing 
numbers of the American people. 
I think that is reflected in the polls 
that I mentioned earlier. 
A policy of holding impregnable bases, 
on the other hand, aimed at a general 
solution based on the neutralization of 
southeast Asia, would reverse the Ameri-
can position in all of these respects, cre-
ating the long-term prospect of a stable 
peace and the short-term prospect of 
nothing more than drastically reduced 
military engagements. 
Mr. President, I want to say a few 
words more directly about the pending 
hill. Although I think the pending bill 
has a significance a?s to our overall policy, 
it authorizes money to carry on the war, 
arid is not a policy statement. I am 
dubious of this legislation because pass-
age of the measure may be viewed as an 
endorsement of the present policy in 
Vietnam for the reasons that I have just 
offered--which policy I do not endorse. 
state again, as I did yesterday, that I 
accept wholly the statement made by the 
able and distinguished Senator from 
Georgia [Mr. RUSSELL], the chairman of 
the Committee on Armed Services when, 
in presenting this bill to the Senate, he 
said that nothin.g in this legislation can 
properly be construed as determining 
foreign policy, as ratifying decisions 
made in the past, or as endorsing new 
commitments. 
I think that we are entitled to rely 
upon that statement from the Senator. 
We have had this debate about policy. I 
hereby state that I do not meaa by voting 
for this bill that I endorse the military 
or political policies that are being fol-
lowed, as understand, at the present 
time in escalating the war in Vietnam. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. Presideet, will the 
Senator yield for an observation? 
Mr. ELM:BRIGHT. I yield. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, this is an 
appropeiate place to make the observa-
tion that the principle that the Senator 
from Arkansas seems to be relying upon 
is that when there is ambiaoity as to 
what the policy of the bill is, then legis-
lative history is made by turning to the 
statements of the Senator in charge of 
the bill. That, of course, completely falls 
when the administration itself states 
what its policy is in the heari 558 on the 
bill and in the bill itself. 
In my judgment, there is no question 
as to the policy of this administration in 
the bill. Therefore, there is not anything 
that the Senator from Georgia can say 
to change that policy. The policy is set 
out with complete clarity in the bill itself 
and in the statements of the, witnesses 
of the administration. 
Mr. PULBRIGHT. Mr. President, I 
recognize, as I have said in discussing 
the matter with the Senator privately, as 
all of us have, that this is a very difficult 
situation in which we have an authoriza-
tion for an appropriation. An appro-
priation is normally not inclined to be 
considered as a statement of policy. It 
is normal that legislation, according to 
our rules, should not be included in an 
appropriation bill. 
say that we are faced with an ex-
tremely difficult situation. I am very 
reluctant to vote for this measure for the 
reasons the Senator has stated. The 
alternative proposed by the Senator from 
Oregon would result in a situation which 
would force a decision on the floor as 
to whether the Senate should reaffirm 
policies which I do not wish to reaffirm, 
speaking for myself. We are merely de-
laying the decision to a better day so we 
can make the decision under more favor-
able circumstances and determine what 
our policy should be. 
I think it is unfortunate that in the 
beginning of this session these questions 
have arisen in connection with an au-
thorization for the armed services. 
This gives at least some color to the 
pleas that we are interfering with the 
supplies of our soldiers. This opens up 
opportunities for all kinds of irrelevant 
and very damaging debate, irrelevant, I 
think, to the real essence of policy. 
What I am trying to say is that insofar 
as this bill is concerned, I accept that 
statement in the same way the Senator 
from Wisconsin said he relied upon the 
statement of the Senator from Arkansas. 
I thought I was telling him, as far as I 
knew at the time, the truth of the matter 
I was trying to interpret what the ad-
ministration told US in presenting that 
1964 resolution. 
So as a matter of legislative history, 
for whatever it is worth--and I must say 
in many cases it is not worth much?
that is the limit of our power. I know 
we do not have the votes to change the 
existing resolution which has been under 
discussion; and, therefore, I think it is 
the better part of wisdom to follow the 
course upon which I suggest. 
It is not a happy choice. It is very 
seldom, any more, that one has a good 
choice between what he likes and what 
he does not like. The choice always 
seems between the lesser of two evils. 
At least about 99 percent of the time, 
that is the kind of choice we have here 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President., will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Yes; I yield. 
Mr. CLARK. I should like the RECORD 
to show my complete agreement with the 
position taken by the Senator from 
Arkansas. I shall vote against the Morse 
amendment and I shall vote in favor of 
the bill. 
I do both with a heavy heart, most 
reluctantly, as the least unacceptable of 
all available choices. But I wish to make 
it very clear indeed that my votes, both 
against the Morse amendment and for 
the bill, do not indicate an endorsement 
of the policy which I fear the adminis-
tration is following. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator has 
expressed very well what I feel. We are 
holding it in abeyance for a better day, 
a better opportunity, where the matter 
of our involvement in Vietnam as a mat-
ter of national policy can be discussed as 
freely as possible and without being 
entwined into our flag, which flies over 
the Capitol. 
Nobody wants a white flag on the Capi-
tol, and I do not like this kind of dis-
cussion in connection with it. It makes 
it very difficult, really, for us to discuss

a matter of high policy under these 
circumstances. 
That is why I think it is the better part 
of wisdom, in effect, to defer to a better 
day a full-fledged discussion, and I hope 
a proper decision on this matter of policy. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. I yield. 
Mr. MORSE. I understand the argu-
ment of the Senator from Arkansas and 
the Senator from Pennsylvania. Where 
they lose me is when they assume they 
are going to be in a better position to 
discuss policy when they get 450,000 
more American boys over there. That is 
the policy they are approving in this bill. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator knows 
very well that I do not approve of 450,000 
more men over there, or even 450,000. 
As I understood General Gavin's state-
ment?and I have tried to associate my-
self with it here today?he said we 
should make do with what we have there. 
He did not develop, as far as I have at-
tempted to develop today, the next steps. 
As I see it, this is implicit in what he 
did say on how to go about treating a 
state of mind on the part of the Chinese 
so they will negotiate. This is the first 
step. All of the discussion of what the 
final solution will be is for the future. 
It is all right to speculate about it, but 
the No, 1 problem now is how we get 
them in a mood even to have a discussion. 
It is obvious now that this constant 
escalation from 20,000 to 200,000 has by 
no means brought them along closer to 
negotiation. If anything, I think the 
Chinese reason that we are foolish 
enough to expend our manpower and our 
treasure and our material at such a 
furious rate that we will grow tired of 
the effort. As large as we are, because of 
our many other commitments, we will 
reach the point where we cannot afford 
it, and that is the way we will sooner or 
later give up the ghost. ? 
That is in effect what both General 
Gavin and Mr. Kennan said: We should 
look at this more in perspective with re-
gard to our overall commitments, and 
not concentrate so much upon just 
Vietnam. 
Mr. CLARK. The Senator said, I 
suspect inadvertently, "to bring the 
Chinese to negotiate." Did he not mean 
"to bring the Vietcong to negotiate"? 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. No; I mean the 
Chinese. I think the Chinese are in-
volved in this. I think the Senator from 
Pennsylvania will agree that the great 
concern that underlies much of what has 
been said is the possibility or even the 
probability that the course we are pur-
suing will lead to a conflict with the 
Chinese. 
We also know that much moral sup-
port and external physical support to the 
Vietcong in the way of equipment, and 
so forth, comes from the Chinese; and 
the proximity of this area to China?it is 
as close as Cuba is to the United States. 
Of course, North Vietnam adjoins China. 
The Senator will remember what con-
sternation arose in this country when we 
discovered Russia's presence in Cuba. 
Why would it not be somewhat similar, 
when we are so close to China? 
Mr. CLARK. The Senator is probably 
correct. _It is my view, however, that 
the end of this war is going to come 
first through some arrangement with the 
Vietcong that Hanoi is prepared to sup-
port; whereas China is, I believe, just 
sitting back watching American boys get 
killed while they do not have a single 
soldier involved. I would question 
whether the Senator would be able to 
force Hanoi to continue to fight if they 
did not wish to do so. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Of course, I should 
be happy to settle it with the Vietcong 
if we could, if they are so disposed. 
There is another matter about the 
Vietcong. The Vietcong have been 
deceived twice, as the Senator knows: 
By the French in 1946 and I guess you 
might say all of us in 1956, after failing 
to go through with the Geneva accords. 
I do not know whether they will be 
disposed to make a settlement or not. I 
think the Chinese could have great in-
fluence upon them. One thing which 
leads me to approach it this way for pur-
poses of discussion is that we constantly 
hear, as an excuse for this bill, about 
the buildup in Thailand. We have heard 
that discussed at nearly every meeting 
of the committee: "You know, the 
Chinese have already given orders and 
subversive organizations are being start-
ed in northeast Thailand, and that is 
the next one on the course." 
That is part of the justification for 
this bill. It is assumed that even if we 
wipe out the Vietcong, next we are going 
to be over there in Thailand. It is that 
domino theory in this connection. 
So that is what has led pie to believe 
and to think along the lines that If we 
settle South Vietnam, we will not have 
settled very much, because we have 
Cambodia, Laos, Thailand. All right, 
they are all very weak. We should try to 
begin looking at the problem on a 
broader basis, in order to get some kind 
of a settlement that might be useful. I 
do not wish to have a succession of these 
conflicts, and I know nobody else does. 
Mr. GORE. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. I yield. 
Mr. GORE. Could it not easily be 
reasoned that the spread of insurgency 
to other areas in southeast Asia is the 
result of the buildup of an American 
expeditionary force? 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. I think the Sena-
tor is quite correct. Implicit in what 
I am saying, if I did not make it clear, 
is that the thing that would be of great 
? value as an incentive to the Chinese and 
the North Vietnamese in leading to a 
settlement would be a withdrawal of our 
military. 
To put It another way, our presence 
itself is the principal reason for much 
of the activity, the insurgency, the en-
ergy, and the willingness of the enemy 
to sacrifice. I often think of what con-
sternation struck us as we realized that 
Russia had a real presence In Cuba. 
This country was ready to do anything. 
We would not have hesitated if the 
President had ordered an invasion. As 
the Senators know, we would have ap-
proved it, and everyone would have ap-
plauded. 
President Kennedy picked a better 
method, a much wiser method that had 
never occurred to most of us, as a mat-
ter of fact, a very ingenious method, 
which in my view was a form of accom-
modation. He allowed Russia to save 
her face and to get out without humilia-
tion. 
And what has happened? The Cubans 
are Communists, but with the Russians 
gone, we do not hear any more speeches 
on the floor of the Senate about Cuba. 
Very few. Senators will remember at 
what white heat everyone's tempers were 
around here, and the great speeches that 
were made denouncing Castro, and so on. 
I have hardly heard Castro mentioned in 
recent years; only incidentally, when we 
receive these circulars from some orga-
nized group of emigres, and we feel sad 
about them and all that. 
But the country is not concerned about 
Cuba at present. It has simmered down, 
and that is what George Kennan says 
this country ought to do, simmer down 
about Vietnam and look for some form 
of solution. 
I think the Senator is quite right: As 
long as we are there, to them it is like 
the presence of the French. As long as 
the French were there, there was bound 
to be agitation to get them out. 
I know this may not sit well with my 
fellow Americans, to be compared with 
the French. I know we are there under 
the best of motives. I do not question 
the motives; all I question is the wisdom. 
I do not believe that our motives are 
bad. Our motives are of the best. We 
wish to help them. But that has no 
effect upon the wisdom of what we are 
doing, or whether what we are doing is 
designed to achieve our purpose, or 
whether the purpose we set out with is 
achievable. 
I applaud the efforts concerning paci-
fication and improving the life of these 
people. It is possible that they think we 
are like the French, that our administra-
tion looks the same as that of any for-
eigners. We look like the French. Of 
course we do not talk like them, but we 
have similar characteristics. It reminds 
me of the article I read, which was 
placed in the RECORD the other day, that 
we are sleeping in the same beds as the 
French but dreaming different dreams. 
We look too much like colonialists from 
a western country, perhaps. I do not 
believe that our motives are bad. I be-
lieve that our motives are high. I be-
lieve it is a question of wisdom as to 
policy, particularly when we believe it is 
within our power to accomplish what we 
say is our objective. 
Mr. McGOVERN, Mr. YARBOROUGH, 
and Mr. GRUENING addressed the 
Chair. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. I yield to the Sen-
ator from South Dakota first, and then 
I shall be glad to yield to the Senator 
from Texas and the Senator from 
Alaska. 
Mr. McGOVERN. When the Senator 
from Georgia [Mr. RussELL1 presented 
the bill on February 16, he had this to 
say about it: 
Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67600446R000400050008-5

4206 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE March 1, 1966 
This bill cannot possibly be construed as 
either an endorsement of or as an attack 
upon national policy. It involves more the 
throwing of a rope to a man in the water. 
We may have cause to question how he got 
there, but he is there, he Is a human being, 
hi is our friend and a member of our family 
and, therefore, if we have a rope and do not 
throw it to him to enable him to assist him-
self out of the water this would be a callous 
and heartless attitude for us to take. 
As 1: interpret that statement by the 
Senator in charge of the bill, it is open 
to question whether we were right in 
getting so deeply involved in this struggle 
but that, nevertheless, because of those 
policies which may be open to question, 
we have our troops in there, over their 
heads?as he states?in the water, and 
we have no other reasonable or accept-
able course other than to throw a rope 
to them in the form of needed equip-
ment. Is that the Senator's understand-
ing-of what we are doing with regard to 
this bill? 
Mr, FULBRIGHT. Yes, Our forces 
are there, and I believe that as I have 
Already said to the Senator from 
Oregon?I do not know whether the 
Senator from South Dakota was in the 
Chamber?there is a distinction between 
the necessity to authorize an appro-
priation for the Army and a statement 
of policy or endorsement of policy. I 
read another part of the same Senator's 
speech that this was not interpreted to 
be a statement of policy, but the Senator 
from Oregon has made the point that it 
is impossible to insulate these two. If 
we totally reject what is-going on, one of 
the ways to stop it is to cutoff the 
money; but this is a drastic thing to do 
and, furthermore, the Senator has to 
admit it is utterly unrealistic to think 
that we can, 
I notice that the Senator from Oregon 
has a quizzical look, on his face, so let 
me assure Idin that I mean he does not 
have the votes?and the Senator knows 
that he does not have them. Therefore? 
we are faced with the facts in this case. 
I like to argue theory in other forums, 
but in the Senate we have to recognize 
the facts and vote accordingly on an 
issue which could if pressed have the 
effect of reaffirming a policy I do not 
wish to reaffirm. This may not be a 
very gallant or straightforward way in 
ordinary business, but in politics, I be-
lieve it is perfectly logical and necessary, 
certainly in this instance, 
Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, 
will the Senator from Arkansas yield? 
Mr, GRUEN-MG. Will the Senator 
from Arkansas yield? 
Mr. FULI3RIGHT, I have only one 
more page to read, but I yield at this 
time to the Senator from Texas. 
Mr. YARBOROUGH. I desire to ask 
this question of the Senator from Arkan-
sas. Does the Senator know the ap-
proximate speed of our bombers which 
were used over North Vietnam before the 
Pause? How fast were they going?how 
many miles per hour? 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. These are the best 
we have?supersonic, I believe-1,200 to 
1,400--
Mr. YARBOROUGH. One thousand 
five hundred mile,s per hour? 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. In that neighbor-
hood; yes. These are the best we have. 
Mr. YARBOROUGH. How close were 
they bombing to the Chinese border?
approximately 30 miles? 
Mr. FTILBRIGHT? Somewhere around 
that fig ure, I believe. 
Mr. YAP. BOROUGH. So that with a 
speed of 1,500 miles an hour and the 
border 30 miles away, we were dropping 
bombs only 1 minute from Red China; 
is that not correct? 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Less than 1 
minute--
Mr. 'YARBOROUGH. Less than a 
minute--
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Much less than a 
minute I believe, is it not? 
Mr. YARBOROUGH. In the opinion 
of the Senator from Arkansas, as chair-
man of the Foreign Relations Committee, 
and having studied this resolution, when 
we bomb within less than 1 minute of 
the Chinese border, could not the neutral 
nations of the world believe, in the Sena-
tor's thinking, that we are tweaking the 
tiger's tail and trying to lure him into a 
war? 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. It certainly could 
be interpreted as such. This is one of 
the explanations which I have been curi-
ous about. I do not like ever to challenge 
anyone's veracity without having any-
thing to base it on and, therefore, I can-
not do it; but I have often wondered 
what were our ships doing up there, so 
close to that seacoast? It has been stated 
that we were approaching them on the 
radar at night, so I do not know, but I 
certainly believe that is subject to some 
kind of interpretation. 
Let me ask the Senator, did he say 
tweaking whose tail? 
Mr, YARBOROUGH. I asked whether 
the neutral. nations of the world might 
not think we were kind of stomping the 
tiger's 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator must 
mean the dragon's tail, in this case. 
Dragon's tail, is it not? The Senator 
must he thinking of a "tiger in your 
tank." [Laughter. 'I 
Mr. YARBOROUGH. I invite the at-
tention of the Senator from Arkansas to 
page 35 of the February 21 issue of U.S. 
News & World Report, on page 35, under 
the subhead of "U.S. Goals in Vietnam." 
The article states, under a Honolulu 
dateline, that there are 12,000 villages 
and hamlets in Vietnam, that the Gov-
ernment holds a thousand and that the 
other 11,000 are held by the Vietcong. 
The article states that our aim this year 
is to recapture and pacify 900 out of 
South Vietnam's 11?000 hamlets held by 
the Communists-900 of the 11,000 this 
year, 1,500 in 1967, and, hopefully, to ac-
celerate the rate in future years. 
My question for the distinguished 
chairman of the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee is: As a result of the recent hear-
ings, how do we intend to pacify these 
villages and hamlets? Do we intend to 
burn these villages down and destroy 
them? Or how can we pacify them? 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. I stated a moment 
ago that I believe the objectives which 
have been announced are, for all prac-
tical purposes, practically impossible for 
foreigners to achieve. This is one of the 
things I have in mind. As the Senator 
stated, if we burn these villages down, 
that would be a difficult way to pacify 
them, naturally. We would have to re-
build them. But even if we did rebuild 
them after burning them down, that 
would not necessarily create a viable 
structure for these people who differ 
from us in so many ways. They could 
not help regarding us as anything but 
similar to their former colonial masters. 
When we have poured in 200,000 troops 
with all the services that go ith it, we 
are completely disrupting their economy. 
We all read about the same things in 
the newspapers, that the whole economy 
of Vietnam is being thrown into chaos by 
the infusion of so much money, so 
rapidly, by our troops and by our con-
struction there. It is creating an almost 
intolerable situation. So we do, more 
and more, have to take control of this 
country. We have to do that, to try to 
keep them in there. The bill before the 
Foreign Relations Committee for eco-
nomic aid is to try to control inflation. 
I am not sure whether it will control or 
enhance it. It is questionable. This is 
a very, very difficult thing. I cannot 
think of anything quite comparable in 
our experience. We can think of the 
Philippines, if we like, at least it is some-
what near there, but we did not do the 
Job there. Magsaysay did it with very 
little economic aid. We did not do it 
ourselves. I do not believe that we could 
have done it. But, he did it. 
Mr. YARBOROUGH. Mr. President, 
I thank the distinguished Senator from 
Arkansas for his comments. Mr. Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed in the RECORD, the article pub-
lished in the U.S. News & World Report 
on page 35, in the issue of February 21, 
1966, entitled "U.S. Goals in Vietnam." 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
U.S. GOALS IN VIETNAM 
110N0LULU,?liere's what the United States 
and South Vietnam are hoping to accomplish 
in this year's lighting: 
Recapture and pacify 900 out (A South 
Vietnam's 12,000 hamlets held by Commu-
nists. 
Consolidate control of 1,000 Government-
held hamlets?making a total of 1,900 ham-
lets firmly under Government control. 
Build 2,050 new classrooms. 
Construct 500 miles of road, 148 bridges, 
57 dams, and 120 miles of canals. 
In 1967, the aim is to pacify 1,500 more 
hamlets. After 1967, it is hoped, the rate of 
pacification will snowball?with the iiountry 
brought entirely under control of the Gov-
ernment within 5 to 7 years. 
Mr. GRUENING. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield? 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. I yield to the Sen-
ator from Alaska. 
Mr. GRUENING. I first would like to 
say I find myself in complete accord 
with the fears, doubts, and questions 
which the distinguished chairman of 
the Foreign Relations Committee has 
expressed. I may not take the same 
position on the bill as he has, but I real-
ize the dilemma which faces us. 
I wish to comment briefly on the collo-
quy had between the Senator from 
Arkansas and the Senator from Oregon, 
Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67600446R000400050008-5

wiv-K.T.n.-Ezzrurrtm?AmCalielfRETM4901416R000400050008-5 4207 
and the fact that we have a certain 
amount of comfort in accepting the as-
surance by the chairman of the Armed 
Services Committee that voting for the 
bill is no compliance with or acceptance 
of the present foreign policy or future 
policy. That may be true. 
As the Senator from Oregon pointed 
out, no Member of the Senate, not even 
the chairman in charge of the bill, can 
make a commitment that the President 
makes. We find that commitment in 
the very letter of transmittal, in which 
it is stated: 
In the last 2 years, in repeated acts of 
authorization and appropriation, the Con-
gress has provided continuing support for 
our national decision "to prevent further 
aggression" in southeast Asia. The quoted 
words come from the joint resolution of 
Congress?Public Law 88-408?approved on 
August 10,1964. 
That was the basis for the resolution. 
Of course, that resolution was drafted in 
the White House. So there we have it 
in black and white. 
If we vote for the bill, we are approv-
ing the policy which the Senator from 
Arkansas, the Senator from Alaska, the 
Senator from Oregon, and other Sena-
tors do not approve of. There it is in 
black and white. One may find comfort 
in the words of the chairman of the 
Armed Services Committee [Mr. Rus-
SELL], but there it is. If we pass this 
bill, the administration has served no-
tice that we approve the policy. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. I do not agree 
with that. I do not accept that. 
Mr. GRUENING. It is there. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. It is there, yes; 
this business of our relations with the 
executive has been a difficult one. No 
government of any importance that I 
know of, a country as big as this one, has 
the same relationship between the legis-
lative and executive. In England and in 
all other large parliamentary bodies the 
executive is a part of the legislative, and 
they work problems out between them-
selves, and they have their own method 
of resolving their differences. They have 
the very important power that when they 
disagree with the executive they can 
change him. We cannot do it. We have 
to accommodate to it. In many ways 
our President has much greater power, 
regardless of the Legislature, than is true 
of the executive in other countries. Peo-
ple do not recognize that fact. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. I yield. I have 
about concluded my statement. 
Mr. MORSE. This is the last time I 
shall interrupt. 
I would like to go back to the time of 
what happened at the Tonkin Bay inci-
dent. I judge, from the way the Senator 
from Arkansas has expressed himself, 
that he is not too sure just exactly what 
happened at Tonkin Bay. 
The Senator from Oregon is not, 
either. 
There is one thing we ought to make 
very clear in the RECORD. It is that the 
administration told us that our ships 
were 70 or 75 miles away. I was one who 
pressed them on this, because I had been 
informed in advice from the Pentagon 
building that our ships were a much, 
much shorter distance away than 75 
miles. We learned subsequently that the 
ships were only 13 or 14 miles away from 
the place where bombing took place by 
the South Vietnamese ships, which we 
had completely equipped. The testimony 
also brought out that our officials in 
Saigon had constant information as to 
what they were doing. 
History has already recorded that our 
ships were sufficiently close in proximity 
to those South Vietnamese vessels that 
were bombing islands three or four miles 
off the mainland of North Vietnam that 
we were in fact giving coverage. At 
least, our destroyers were close enough 
to come to the assistance of those ships 
if they got into trouble. 
The Senator will recall that in the For-
eign Relations Committee?and the 
record will show it?I said to the ad-
ministration witnesses, "What do you 
suppose we would have done if Russia 
had had destroyers 75 miles from Key 
West and started bombing Key West?" 
We know what we would have done. We 
would have sunk those Russian ships. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. The Senator for-
gets that we are "good guys." It makes 
a lot of difference. 
I have about concluded. 
I should like to make another comment 
about the House committee report with 
regard to the urgency of the bill. I do 
not think there is any reason at all to 
apologize for the discussion that has 
taken place, since the House report states 
that there is no urgency for the bill. I 
have stated that and placed it in the 
RECORD, and I shall not do so again. Fur-
thermore, the House is only acting on the 
bill today. 
According to the House Committee on 
Armed Services, which, as we know, is 
composed of gentlemen who can hardly 
be considered unsympathetic to the ma-
terial needs of the armed services, there 
is no urgency about this supplemental 
authorization. In the words of the re-
port of the House Armed Services Com-
mittee: 
If there is one reservation felt by many 
members of the committee regarding the 
necessity for this legislation, it arises from 
the possibility that many of the items in-
volved, in all three categories of procurement, 
research and development, and construction, 
may simply have been moved from the reg-
ular 1967 authorization to this supplemental 
1966 authorization without any real program 
for acceleration. Obviously no military ad-
vantages would be gained by such a book-
keeping situation. Testimony on this sub-
ject was indecisive and the committee has 
not yet been provided with sufficient defini-
tive data to pinpoint the exact degree of real 
acceleration, or to determine the amounts 
involved in the proposed legislation which 
could safely and should properly be deferred 
until the regular 1967 authorization. 
The accusations which have been 
leveled at us have been perfectly un-
justifiable. There has been direct ref-
erence to the debate which has gone on 
about this question, as well as the hear-
ings. I do not take with very good grace 
the criticism that has been leveled at 
members of the Foreign Relations Corn-
tmittee or any other Members who have 
taken part in the debate. Some strong 
words were used on the floor of the Sen-
ate in an attempt to try to show that the 
delay in passing this bill was injuring 
our Armed Forces, which is nonsense. 
There are shortages of certain mate-
rials in Vietnam, but no evidence has 
been offered to show that this is due to 
a present lack of money. Whatever 
shortages there may be are due to con-
gestion in the ports, to the lack of ware-
housing or transportation, or to poor 
planning, but not to lack of money. If 
I understand the situation correctly, this 
money might just as well be carried in 
the regular Defense Department au-
thorization which will soon be before 
us and which will, of course, require well 
over half of the total taxes paid by the 
190 million people of the richest Nation 
in the world. 
I intend, with great reluctance, to vote 
for this bill. I hope I have made it clear 
that my vote will not indicate support 
of present military policies. I shall vote 
for the bill because, althOugh available 
evidence, including the stated reserva-
tion of the House Armed Services Com-
mittee, indicates that this supplemental 
authorization is not necessary to meet 
the present material needs of our Armed 
Forces in Vietnam, the merest possibil-
ity that a delay in funds might conceiv-
ably handicap our fighting men obliges 
me to support it. However unwise the 
policy that put them there, our men are 
In Vietnam and fighting, and one cannot 
take the chance?even a very remote 
one?of denying them anything they 
may need. The only item mentioned in 
which there might be a delay in issuing 
contracts is for helicopters. I am un-
willing to vote against this bill because?
and only because?of the dim and re-
mote possibility that it may actually 
serve some useful purpose for our fight-
ing men.

Gen. MATTHEW RIDGWAY, 
U.S. Army (Retired), Mellon Institute, Pitts-
burgh., Pa. 
DEAR GENERAL RIDGWAY: I regret that you 
do not feel in a position to testify before 
the committee concerning the situation in 
Vietnam. many of the members of the com-
mittee, and I particularly, had hoped that 
you would give us the benefit of your vast 
experience and knowledge in military af-
fairs. 
I can certainly understand your desire to 
restrict your activities in the next few weeks 
and I hope that you will be fully recovered 
from your illness soon. 
You have no doubt read press accounts 
of General Gavin's testimony before the com-
mittee on Tuesday. His testimony was ex-
tremely well presented and his comments 
will, I am sure, be very helpful to the mem-
bers of this committee and the public gen-
erally in gaining a better understanding of 
the issues facing us in Vietnam. If you 
have any comments on his testimony or on 
Vietnam generally, the committee would be 
glad to have them, either for publication or 
for the information of the members only. 
If you do not care to make any comments, I 
will certainly understand. 
With kind regards, I am, 
Sincerely yours, 
3. W. FULBRIGHT, 
Chairman.

PITTSBURGH, PA., 
February 19, 1966. 
[Ion. J. WmfrAivt PULBRIGIIT, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington .1) C. 
DEAR SENATOR PTITBRIGHT: Your gracious 
letter is deeply appreciated. While it is 
dated February 11, it was only delivered to 
no here on the 18th. 
welcome the opportunity you kindly of-
fer me to comment on General Gavin's testi-
mony, and I have no restrictions to request 
BS to the disposition you may wish to make 
of my comments. If, in your judgment, 
they merit distribution among the members 
of your committee, or inclusion in the ro::-
ords of the hearings. I shall be happy. 
On December 13 last, General Gavin wrote 
me, enclosing a copy of a draft of a letter he 
had written for publication in Harper's 
magazine, saying that since I was men-
tioned in it, he "thought it appropriate for 
me to see its" even though "you may not be 
in agreement with the sentiments expressed 
in it." 
On December 17, I replied that I thought 
"the letter-swill have a substantial impact 
on al.l thoughtful persons who read it and 
on those in official circles in Washington--
executive and legislative?concerned with 
the problems with which it deals." At the 
same time I wrote Harper's magazine that 
my own views accord completely" with 
those of General Gavin, as stated in the draft 
sent me. f added that I was. then consider-
ing publishing an article on the Vietnam 
situation. Actually I had been working on 
the draft of one prior to receipt of General 
OILVUI'S letter, and for some time now that 
draft has been undergoing review by a pros-
pective publisher. 
When General Gavin's letter was pub-
lished, I was disturbed to see the distortions 
which it had been subjected, and which 
had read into his statements thoughts I as-
sume he had never entertained. I tele-
phoned him verifying the correctness of my 
assumption, and was gratified to have him 
state his intention of making all this clear 
in his testimony before the Senate Foreign 
Deletions Committee the following day. 
watched all of General Gavin's testimony 
before your nommittee. I thought it re-
worded great depth and breadth of view, and I 
was deeply gratified, not only by his com-
plete candor in responding to all questions 
and the temperate language in which his 
tinswers were couched, but equally so by the 
clarity of his presentation. I thought it dis-
sipated the cloud of misinterpretation and 
misrepresentation by which others had ?b-
emired the meaning he had intended. Again 
I found myself in basic agreement with his 
staled views. 
In conclusion, having sat before the TV 
screen throughout all of the hearings, may 
1 state, sir, my respectful opinion that you 
conducted them in the finest traditions of 
the Senate, and that you and your colleagues 
performed a signal service to our people. 
Out of these hearings I hope will accrue in-
creasingly strong support for the middle 
course which I believe the President to be 
following, in rejecting the counsel of ex-
tremists in either direction, while continuing 
to seek an honorable solution which will put 
;LB end to hostilities without prejudice either 
in our vital interests, or to the fulfillment of 
our pledges. 
With my highest respect, I am, 
Sincerely. 
Ms 13. hireew AY, 
;e!Ur!r(11, U.S. Army, Retired. 
Me. SMATHERS. Mr. President, I 
si tall necessarily be brief because, regret-
tably, the condition of my throat is such 
that I cannot speak for as long as I 
should like. However, I am happy to 
have an opportunity to make a, few 
remarks, 
I think I express the views of the ma-
jority of the Members of the U.S. Senate 
when I say I am. relieved and pleased 
that the Senate is finally going to have 
an opportunity to vote on the amend-
ment which has been offered by the dis-
tinguished Senator from Oregon to re-
peal the Southeast Asia Resolution of 
1964. 
While I do not agree with the distin-
guished senior Senator from Oregon and 
his conclusions with respect to most 
matters having to do with Vietnam, 
nevertheless I recognize him.. as does 
every other Senator, as a man of great 
courage and a man of great forthright-
ness. Be has presented to us the real 
problem with which we are all con-
cerned, and now we have a chance to 
vote up or down the real issue fJ, stake. 
I have listened with interest to the re-
marks made by a man for whom I have 
great respect, the chairman of the For-
eign Relations Committee I Cdr. Fut.-
saicuTl, with respect to the fact that he 
did not think this was necessarily going 
to be a vote on the key issues of what we 
are doing in Vietnam, whether we should 
be there or not, or whether we are giving 
support to the resolution as passed in 
1964. 
I quote from the CoNctiEssiomm. REC-
aim of August 6, 1964. The distinguished 
Senator from Arkansas said: 
It should be made equally clear to these 
reg Imes?
Meaning the Comm:mists?
if it is mit yet sufficiently  clear, that their 
aggressive and expansionist ambitions, wher-
ever advanced, will meet. precisely that de-
gree of American opposition which is neces-
sary to frustrate them. 
That it. what the distinguished Sena-
tor said that day. 
When one reads what the President 
said .when he sent to Congress the pres-
ent request for supplemental funds, it is 
in almost precisely the same language. 
I quote from the first page of the mes-
sage: 
We are currently engaged in a mojor effort 
to open ii road to a peaceful settlement. 
Whether the present effort is suceessful or 
not, our purpose of peace will be constant; 
we will continue to press on every loor. 
13ilt, until there is a response?and until 
the aggression ends--we must do ell that is 
necessary to support our .allies and our own 
fighting forces in Vietnam. 
'Phis is the purpose of the piee;ent re-
quest. It has been made so that we can 
meet whatever force they apply against 
us and meet whatever force they apply 
against South Vietnam. 
That is what I understand the distin-
guished Senator from Arkansas said the 
Gulf of Tonkin resolution meant when he 
led the debate for it in 1964. 
At this point in my remarks, I ask 
unanimous consent to have inserted in 
the ree,ord the full text of Public Law 88-
49a of the 88th Congress approved Au-
gust ill, 1964--the joint resolution and 
to promote the maintenance of interna-
tional peace and security in southeast 
Asia together with the :President's mes-
sage to the Congress dated August 5, 
1964. 
There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the REcoso, 
as follows: 
[Public Law 88-408, 88th Cong.] 
H.J. RES, 1145 
Joint resolution to promote the mainte-
nance of international peace and security 
in southeast Asia 
Whereas naval units of the Communist 
regime in Vietnam, in violation of the prin-
ciples of the Charter of the United Nations 
and of international law, have deliberately 
and repeatedly attacked United States naval 
vessels lawfully present in international 
waters, and have thereby created a serious 
threat to international peace; and 
Whereas these attacks are part of a de-
liberate and systematic campaign of aggres-
sion that the Communist regime in North 
Vietnam has been waging against its neigh-
bors and the nations joined with them in the 
collective defense of their freedom; and 
Whereas the United States is assisting the 
peoples of southeast Asia to protect their 
freedom and has no territorial, military, or 
political ambitions in that area, but desires 
only that these peoples should lie left in 
peace to work out their own deetinies in 
their own way: Now, therefore, be it 
Resolved by the Senate and HOUSe of Rep-
resentatives of the United States America 
in Congress assembled, That the Congress 
approves and supports the determination of 
the President, as Commander in Chief, to 
take all necessary measures to repel any 
armed attack against the forces of the 
United States and to prevent further 
aggression. 
SEC. 2, The United States regards as vital 
to its national interest and -to world peace 
the maintenance of international peace and 
security in southeast Asia. Consonant with 
the Constitution of the United Slates and 
the Charter of the United Nation.; and in 
accordance with its obligations under the 
Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, the 
United States is, therefore, prepared, as the 
President determines, to take all accessary 
steps, including the use of armed force, to 
assist any member or protocol state of tile 
Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty re-
questing assistance in defense of its freedom. 
SEC. 3. This resolution shall expire when 
the President shall determine that the peace 
and security of the area is reasonably assured 
by international conditions created by action 
of the United Nations or otherwise, except 
that it may be terminated earlier by concur-
rent resolution of the Congress. 
Approved August 10, 1964. 
To the Congress of the United States 
Last night I announced to the P merican 
people that the North Vietnamese regime 
had conducted further deliberate attacks 
against U.S. naval vessels operating in inter-
national waters, and that I had therefore di-
rected air action against gunboats end sup-
porting facilities used in these hostile op-
erations. This air action has now been 
carried out with substantial damage to the 
boats and facilities. Two U.S. aircraft were 
lost in the action. 
After consultation with the leaden. of both 
parties in the Congress, I further enuounced 
a decision to ask the Congress for a resolu-
tion expressing the unity and determination 
of the United States in supporting freedom 
and in protecting peace in southeast Asia. 
These latest actions of the North Viet-
namese regime have given a new and grave 
turn to the already serious situation in 
southeast Asia. Our commitments in that 
area are well known to the Congress. They 
were first made in 1954 by Preeiden 1, Eisen-
hower. They were further defined in the 
Southeast Asia Collective Defense Troaty ap-
proved by the Senate in February 1955. 
This treaty with its accompanying protocol 
obligates the United States and other mem-
bers to act in accordance with their con-
stitutional processes to meet Communist ag-
gression against any of the parties or protocol 
states.

Our policy in southeast Asia has been con-
sistent and unchanged since 1954. I sum-
marized it on June 2 in four simple proposi-
tions: 
1. America keeps her word. Here as else-
where, we must and shall honor our commit-
ments. 
2. The issue is the future of southeast 
Asia as a whole. A threat to any nation in 
that region is a threat to all, and a threat 
to us. 
3. Our purpose is peace. We have no mili-
tary, political or territorial ambitions in 
the area. 
4. This is not just a jungle war, but a 
struggle for freedom on every front of hu-
man activity. Our military and economic as-
sistance to South Vietnam and Laos in par-
ticular has the purpose of helping these 
countries to repel aggression and strengthen 
their independence. 
The threat to the free nations of south-
east Asia has long been clear. The North 
Vietnamese regime has constantly sought to 
take over South Vietnam and Laos. This 
Communist regime has violated the Geneva 
Accords for Vietnam. It has systematically 
conducted a campaign of subversion, which 
includes the direction, training, and supply 
of personnel and arms for the conduct of 
guerrilla warfare in South Vietnamese terri-
tory. In Laos, the North Vietnamese regime 
has maintained military forces, used Laotian 
territory for infiltration into South Vietnam, 
and most recently carried out combat opera-
tions?all in direct violation of the Geneva 
agreements of 1962. 
In recent months, the actions of the North 
Vietnamese regime have become steadily 
more threatening. In May, following new 
acts of Communist aggression in Laos, the 
United States undertook reconnaissance 
flights over Laotian territory, at the request 
of the Government of Laos. These flights 
had the essential mission of determining the 
situation in territory where Communist 
forces were preventing inspection by the In-
ternational Control Commission. When the 
Communists attacked these aircraft, I re-
sponded by furnishing escort fighters with 
instructions to fire when fired upon. Thus, 
these latest North Vietnamese attacks on our 
naval vessels are not the first direct attacks 
on Armed Forces of the United States. 
As President of the United States I have 
concluded that I should now ask the Con-
gress, on its part, to join in affirming the na-
tional determination that all such attacks 
will be met, and that the United States will 
continue in its basic policy of assisting the 
free nations of the area to defend their free-
dom. 
As I have repeatedly made clear, the United 
States intends no rashness, and seeks no 
wider war. We must make it clear to all that 
the United States is united in its determina-
tion to bring about the end of Communist 
subversion and aggression in the area. We 
seek the full and effective restoration of the 
international agreement signed in Geneva in 
1954, with respect to South Vietnam, and 
again in Geneva in 1962, with respect to Laos. 
I recommend a resolution expressing the 
support of the Congress for all necessary ac-
tion to protect our Armed Forces and to as-
sist nations covered by the SEATO Treaty. 
At the same time, I assure the Congress that 
we shall continue readily to explore any 
avenues of political solution that will effec-
tively guarantee the removal of Communist 
subversion arid the preservation of the in-
dependence of the nations of the area. 
The resolution could well be based upon 
similar resolutions enacted by the Congress 
in the past?to meet the threat to Formosa 
in 1955, to meet the threat to the Middle 
East in 1957, and to meet the threat in Cuba 
in 1962. It could state in the simplest terms 
the resolve and support of the Congress for 
No. 36-9 
action to deal appropriately with attacks 
against our Armed Forces and to defend 
freedom and preserve peace in southeast Asia 
in accordance with the obligations of the 
United States under the southeast Asia 
treaty. I urge the Congress to enact such 
a resolution promptly and thus to give con-
vincing evidence to the aggressive Commu-
nist nations, and to the world as a whole, 
that our policy in southeast Asia will be 
carried forward?and that the peace and se-
curity of the area will be preserved. 
The events of this week would in any event 
have made the passage of a congressional res-
olution essential. But there is an additional 
reason for doing so at a time when we are 
entering on 3 months of political campaign-
ing. Hostile nations must understand that 
in such a period the United States will con-
tinue to protect its national interests, and 
that in these matters there is no division 
among us. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON. 
THE WHITE HOUSE, August 5, 1964. 
Mr. SMATHERS. Mr. President, let 
us recall that we had a united Congress 
and a united nation. The resolution 
was adopted by the House of Representa-
tives by a vote of 414 to 0 and the Senate 
by a vote of 88 yeas to 2 nays. I am 
confident that we have that support to-
day and that the Congress will over-
whelmingly defeat the Morse amend-
ment. 
Let us also be very clear on this issue: 
Public Law 88-408 previously referred 
to declares that the United States re-
gards as vital to its national interest 
and to world peace the maintenance of 
international peace and security in 
southeast Asia. 
I am confident that the Congress ap-
proves and supports the determinations 
of our President, as Commander in Chief 
to take all necessary steps to repel any 
armed attack against the forces of the 
United States, to prevent further aggres-
sion, and that the United States is pre-
pared, as the President determines, to 
take all necessary steps, including the 
use of armed force, to assist any member 
or protocal state of the Southeast Asia 
Collective Defense Treaty requesting as-
sistance in defense of its freedom. I 
might point out that South Vietnam is 
a protocal state and did request our 
assistance. 
Now is the time to again demonstrate 
our support for administrative policy and 
get on with the business at hand to let 
our fighting men know that their country 
is united in its efforts and their efforts 
for the cause of freedom. 
The time for action is now. 
The time to show a unified nation to 
the free world is now. 
The time to stand up against Commu-
nist agression is now. 
The time to give full support to our 
fighting men abroad is now. 
The time to give full support to our 
President in the interest of our own na-
tional security as well as promoting the 
cause of freedom is now. 
Whether Senators agree with the dis-
tinguished Senator from Arkansas or the 
distinguished Senator from Alaska on 
this point, of course, what we are doing 
Is carrying out the spirit of the resolu-
tion. 
I would hate to think that anybody 
was going to delude or kid himself into 
believing that when we vote to table 
this amendment which has been offered 
by the distinguished Senator from Ore-
gon that we are not in fact voting to keep 
on the books the resolution which we 
passed in August 1964, which we did, as 
the distinguished chairman of the For-
eign Relations Committee said, to let us 
meet every aggressive act with precisely 
the correct response so that we can pre-
serve freedom in South Vietnam. 
I would not want the people deluding 
themselves over the fact any more than I 
would want members of the Finance 
Committee to say that when we reduce 
taxes from 50 to 40 percent, "I really 
mean that I voted for 45 percent." 
When the 50 percent is eliminated, 
there is left standing the result. There 
is no middle ground. The act will speak 
for itself. It will be a law on the books. 
I have only spoken on the floor one 
time this year with respect to the entire 
question of our policies in southeast 
Asia. But I believe that the discussions 
which were held and the debates which 
have developed have been very useful. 
Certainly they have been legal. Cer-
tainly they have been lawful in every 
sense. But I do think this kind of de-
bate can be carried on so long that it 
begins to hurt. I think there is no doubt 
that it has now begun to hurt, not only 
in the United States but elsewhere. 
There was an article in the Washington 
Post on February 27, by Mr. Ward Just, 
of the Washington Post Foreign Service, 
which I would like to read in part: 
SAIGON, February 26.?Senior U.S. officials 
here are dismayed and angered by congres-
sional criticism of the war in Vietnam. This 
view is shared, it is understood, by virtually 
every top official in the U.S. civilian and mili-
tary command. 
These officials believe that what one senior 
diplomat called "organized congressional 
criticism" of the U.S. position here has 
damaged morale in the Armed Forces, sowed 
doubt in the minds of Vietnamese leaders, 
and encouraged the enemy to believe that the 
United States cannot stay the course. 
He goes on to say: 
An American delegation which journeyed 
to Ankhe, headquarters of the 1st Cavalry 
Division, earlier this week was told that the 
criticism of the war effort "cannot help but 
hurt morale" among American soldiers. 
I do not want to go so far as to bring 
in personal matters, but I wish to relate 
from personal knowledge and personal 
experience that I know these continued 
criticisms directed against the policies 
we are following in Vietnam have greatly 
disturbed and dismayed some of our own 
servicemen out there. 
Obviously, there is no question that 
some some of our allies have been worried 
about what our course of action is going 
to be. Certainly the South Vietnamese 
want to know whether we really mean 
what we say, whether we will stand by 
our commitments, whether we are going 
to stay and help them defeat communism 
or put our tail between our legs and 
get out because it has become difficult 
and hard and is costing us materiel and 
men.

Mr. CLARK, Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
SMATHERS. I would like to 
finish my discussion and then I will be 
happy to yield. 
I think that by a- vote here today the 
vast majority of the Senate can prove 
and establish beyond the hint of a doubt 
the fact that we uphold the hand of the 
President. 
Certainly we do not like to be out there. 
wish that my two sons were home and 
I wish that the sons of other parents 
were home. Nobody wants to be tied 
down there. 
When our President took over, there 
were approximately 25,000 men there. 
When the preceding President took over 
there were about 1,000 men there. Do 
we put our tail between our legs arid 
run, and say we signed a treaty but it 
does not amount to anything? I do not 
think we can do that. 
We have had to meet aggression with 
aggression. The President has said 
over and over again that this is a limited 
war with limited objectives. We have 
riot struck Red China. We have not 
31;ruck some of the strategic targets in 
Vietnam. This is the course we are en-
deavoring to follow, hoping we can some-
how bring these people to the negotia-
tion table. 
I would like to read an article by Max 
e'reedman, a fine liberal columnist with 
svhom I do not always agree. I do re-
spect, him, and I do think that he is one 
of the greatest columnists of all time. 
In wrote an article last night in. which 
I thought he put his finger right on the 
nubbin of the problem. He said: 
) 11 tit North Vietnam is ready to accept the 
f:Let, that she cannot impose her will by mili-
tary force and organized subversion on South 
vietnam, the road to peace will remain closed. 
The war, rather than diplomacy, holds the 
key to peace. For, in the judgment of highly 
placed officials in Washington, it will be im-
possible to persuade Hanoi that the Presi-
dent's promises and assurances will be ful-
Idled while they are regarded, as they now 
ore, as no more than a skillful effort to 
weaken and divide the Conununist military 
r!Ill paign. 
Mr. President, I never in my life have 
known of anyone getting into a fist fight 
when he was a young man or a little boy 
who was able, while losing, to say "Let us 
stop now; let; us negotiate; let us sit down 
and show how reasonable we can be." 
The only time you can get a man to 
negotiate is when you are beginning to 
hurt him a little; when he is beginning 
Li) suffer a little. Then you can say to 
him, "Let us negotiate," and he will listen. 
ii you. He will not listen to you when. 
lie feels he is winning. This is the situa-
tion, expanded many times, that we find. 
kids y in Vietnam. 
Until the Communists know that we 
intend to stay there, until they know that 
we mean business, until we show that we 
are united, until we show that we are not 
ening to be driven out, and until we show 
that we will live up to our commitments, 
we are not going to get them to negotiate. 
0:very time someone gets up and talks 
about the tide changing and people los-
ing heart, it encourages the enemy. That 
iII bow the Vietnamese Communists won 
before. As General Maxwell Taylor said 
before the Foreign Relations Committee, 
that is how they won in 1954. He said 
the Communists won in Paris, not out in 
Indochina. That was so because the 
French people had lost heart, because 
they were divided, and because they 
gave up. 
Certainly, this is not the intention or 
the desire of the American people. Cer-
tainly, t is not the intention or desire 
of anyone in Congress. I do not believe 
that we ought to give that impression, 
or that we are even considering such a 
thing. I do not really believe that we 
are. However, some of the debate in 
this Chamber is being interpreted in 
that way. 
',et, us have no illusions abom this par-
ticular vote. While I disagree with the 
conclusions of the Senator from Oregon, 
I believe he is absolutely cormI in stat-
ing that when we vote, there will be no 
mental gymnastics which we can follow. 
No one can say that what we co will not 
in effect be a reaffirmation of the Gulf of 
Tonkin resolution which was passed in 
August 1964. 
If any Senator does not like that, he 
ought to vote for the amendasmt of the 
distinguished Senator from Or:Ton. By 
our vote to table the amendment of the 
Senator from Oregon, we shall be voting 
to reaffirm the decision we mad' when we 
passed the joint resolution of August 10, 
1964. When I vote, I want to reaffirm 
it, and I believe the great majority of 
Senators have the same feeline 
Mr. CLARK. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. SMATHERS. I am happy to yield. 
Mr. CLARK. I have listened with 
growing amazement to the comments of 
my good friend from Florida, comments 
which, to my way of thinking, impose a 
dilemma on those of us who in many 
ways obj act to the acts of our Govern-
ment in Vietnam, although not necessar-
ily, yet, to the policy as enunciated by 
the President. 
I should merely like to state for the 
record that I have not the slightest in-
tention of having my vote on this ques-
tion interpreted as the Senator from 
Florida would, like to have it interpreted. 
I do not believe for a moment that the 
Gulf of Tonkin resolution added as much 
as one inch to the powers of the Presi-
dent. H?r had all those powers without 
adding another. They were his right as 
Commander in Chief. 
I do not intend to vote in favar of the 
Morse amendment, and I do no intend, 
no matter what the Senator from Flor-
ida may say, to have my vote interpreted 
in any other way but the way I stated it 
a few moments ago in a colloquy with the 
Senator from Arkansas [Mr. Fursamml. 
am opposed to a policy which would 
escalate this war. I shall vote against 
the Morse amendment. I shall vote for 
the bill. Nothing that the Senaor from 
Florida can say will change my own in-
terpretation or the interpretation of the 
people of Pennsylvania of the way I 
shall vote. 
Mr. SMATHERS. All I say is that the 
joint resolution of August 10, 1964, Is in 
simple, understandable English. It is on 
the books. There it is. It will stand 
as the law of the land, it seems to me, 
until it is removed. If any Senator 
wishes to challenge it, he can offer a pro-
posal to change it, as the Senator from 
Oregon has done. The Senator from 
Oregon does not like the joint resolution; 
he wants a change. I have not seen any 
other amendments or proposals to change 
the joint resolution of 1964. 
So when we vote on the motion to 
table the amendment of the Senator from 
Oregon, it seems to me that we can 
arrive at only one conclusion: that we 
are affirming the resolution 01 1964. I 
shall vote to table the amendment. 
I want to reaffirm the position we took 
in August, 1964. I want to uphold the 
hand of the Commander in Chief. I 
want to uphold the hand of the President. 
I want to uphold our boys in the fight 
they are making, because I believe it is 
right to do so. I do not believe we should 
quit. We should not run away. We will 
not run away. 
I do not believe we should cut and run 
merely because the struggle is getting 
difficult, and no others want to make the 
sacrifice we are making. 
The Senator from Illinois, I think, 
wishes to comment. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. SMATHERS. I yield. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. It occurs to me that 
now and then we should refresh our-
selves a little on the power of the Com-
mander in Chief. The Constitution 
makes the President the Commander in 
Chief, and that is a reflection of the 
experience that George Washington had 
with divided authority under the Conti-
nental Congress. The closest that the 
Constitutional Convention ever came to 
putting a limit on the powers of the 
President was when they toyed with the 
idea of a limitation to the effect that 
the President could not take command 
of an army in the field. But that pro-
posal was dropped in the Convention, at) 
there is no limit whatsoever. 
In the joint resolution of 1994, Con-
gress was only affirming the power that 
the Commander in Chief had to use the 
Armed Forces of this country. Every 
time we support or approve action by the 
President, we are in effect supporting 
his capacity as Commander in Chief 
under a constitutional power that cannot 
be modified, unless the Constitution is 
changed. 
So we ride along with the joint resolu-
tion of 1964. I see no reason why it 
should be modified or changed, or why 
we should be Indian givers and pull it 
back, now that we are in the thick of 
things. We gave the President the power 
with our eyes open. We knew is we 
were doing. Now to smash it up, to im-
pair it, or to diminish it in any respect 
would be about as foolhardy an act as 
Congress could undertake. 
Mr. SMATHERS. I totally agree with 
the Senator from Illinois. I should like 
to have his comments concerning who I, 
would be the reaction around the world 
should we now withdraw our endorse-
ment. What would be the reaction 
around the world were we at this par-
ticular moment to say to the President

March 1, 1966 Approved FeblkulemsfRAIZ/131-zedtirPORAFR000400050008-5 4211 
that we now rescind the endorsement 
which we gave him in August, 1964? 
Mr DIRICSEN. I doubt whether that 
reaction could be measured. /t would 
be almost fantastic in its dimensions. 
I said to the Senator from Oregon 
earlier today?and I said it with the ut-
most of candidness?that as I listen to 
the international radio monitors and 
hear his name mentioned and his 
speeches quoted from time to time, and 
reported by short wave from Peiping, 
and out of Hanoi, I believe he has become 
something of a symbol. He may laugh 
about this, but I have read pages and 
pages in the international monitors, and 
the Senator from Oregon has become a 
symbol. 
I said today that, in my judgment, we 
shall have to destFoy that symbolism, if 
we are to indicate to the world that we 
mean business?and we do mean busi-
ness. 
Mr. MORSE, Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. SMATHERS. I yield. 
Mr. MORSE. I do not propose to let 
any despicable Communist or group of 
Communists anywhere in the world de-
' termine whether the senior Senator 
from Oregon will carry out what he con-
siders to be his trust in the Senate and 
to say whatever he thinks needs to be 
said in trying to bring about a policy 
that he believes will be in the best in-
terests of his country. 
Mr, DIRKSEN. Oh, surely; I would 
be the last to impeach the motives of the 
Senator from Oregon. I am only stating 
what I think is a fact. 
- The name of the senior Senator from 
Oregon has become a symbol, and they 
have tied this viewpoint to his name. 
That does not represent, in my judg-
ment, the feeling of the Senate or the 
feeling of the people of this country. 
We must destroy that symbolism. 
Otherwise, they will go on with the idea 
that if they stay at it long enough we 
will throw our hand in and withdraw. 
Of all the things that we could not 
countenance for one single moment, that 
would be it. 
Mr. MATHER& Mr. President, I 
thank the distinguished minority leader 
for his contribution. I totally agree 
with him. 
Mr. President, I should like to make 
a very brief reference to the comments 
of the distinguished Senator from Ar-
kansas [Mr. FuLsruatirl with respect to 
the new Harris poll, by which he con-
cluded that the people were in effect 
leaving the position taken by the Presi-
dent of the United States. 
- I do not think that anyone who reads 
that poll can accurately arrive at that 
conclusion. I submit that if one reads 
the second column in which It states the 
basic stand on U.S. policies he will see 
that it states: "Disagree. Carry war 
more to the north." In January, 12 per-
cent wanted to do that. In February, 
when the poll was taken, 16 percent 
wan,ted to do that. 
. , 
What is happening is that the Presi-
dent i? losing some of the people who 
were supporting him in his limited war 
with limited objectives, and they want 
to go further. 
The next question asked was: "Agree, 
but increase the military effort." Thirty-
three percent were in this category in 
January and 33 percent were in the 
same category in February. 
In the next category, "Agree, but do 
more to negotiate," 39 percent of those 
interviewed in January thought we 
should do more to negotiate. However, 
after the President has made such great 
efforts to negotiate, the percentage is 
now 34. This is not disagreement. This 
Is an understanding and appreciation 
that we have explored every possible 
avenue open to us with respect to nego-
tiating this matter. We are still trying 
to negotiate the matter. As we read the 
poll, it appears that the middle group is 
beginning to move into the "hawk" group, 
and that is where the President loses the 
percentage. 
As I stated at the outset, I firmly be-
lieve that the vast majority of the people 
of the United States, as well as the vast 
Majority of Senators and Representa-
tives, totally and completely support and 
endorse the program of the Commander 
in Chief, the President of the United 
States. They uphold his hand. They 
support and approve the manner in which 
General Westmoreland is conducting our 
efforts out there. They applaud the sac-
rifice being made by our young men. 
When we have an opportunity today to 
vote on this particular measure and vote 
resoundingly to table, there is no other 
conclusion that can be reached than that 
we are voting to affirm that resolution 
which we agreed to in 1964 concerning 
the course of action in which the Presi-
dent is leading us. 
I yield the floor. 
Mr. COOPER. Mr. President. 
Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. President. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sen-
ator from Oregon wanted the floor. The 
Chair notes that so many Senators wish 
to express themselves on this important 
piece of legislation that it is extremely 
difficult for the Chair to observe the order 
in which the floor has been sought, par-
ticularly when a Senator seeks the floor 
and then yields temporarily. 
The Chair will try to Make note of this 
in the future. The Senator from Oregon 
had previously asked for the floor. I was 
going to recognize the Senator from 
Kentucky, but then thought of the com-
mitment that had been made to the 
Senator from Oregon. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, I yield to 
the Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, I ap-
preciate the difficulties that you are hav-
ing. My remarks will not be long. 
I recognize after this long debate the 
limitation of adding very much to it. I 
did want to speak now because I spoke 
on this matter at the time the joint reso-
lution was agreed to in August 1964, and 
I took notice of the effect that the 1964 
resolution could have. 
In questions I directed to the chair-
man of the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions, I asked if the 1964 Bay of Tonkin 
resolution would ultimately be used to 
approve any action that the President 
might take, including the bombing of 
cities and ports in North Vietnam, and 
to undertaking a course of action which 
could lead to a war that might involve 
China and become world war III. 
I cannot say that I was not conscious 
of the implications of the resolution 
when I raised those questions that day, 
August 6, on the floor of the Senate. 
However, in voting for the resolution I 
expressed my concern at the time that 
because we were approving great powers 
to the President of the United States, he 
had the duty to immediately and assid-
uously search out the possibility of nego-
tiations, and, if necessary, refer the 
question to the Geneva powers or, indeed, 
to the United Nations for settlement. 
I spoke in the Senate again in March 
1965, and pointed out that I believed the 
President had placed preconditions upon 
our willingness to negotiate. I asked 
him to assert clearly that the United 
States would negotiate without pre-
conditions. 
Mr. GORE. Mr. President, before the 
Senator leaves that matter, will he yield? 
Mr. COOPER. I yield. 
Mr. GORE. Of course, the resolution 
and its contents and the context in 
which we agreed to the resolution is not 
the important thing. The important 
thing is what we do from here. 
Mr. COOPER. That is the point that 
I was going to make. 
Mr. GORE. Since so much emphasis 
has been placed upon that, I should like 
to read a portion of some material. 
Mr. COOPER. I do not want to speak 
so much on the 1964 resolution. I have 
already said that I understood its impli-
cations at the time we agreed to it. I 
wanted to speak with reference to the 
present day, and what can be done look-
ing to the future. 
Mr. GORE. I shall be brief, if the 
Senator will yield further. 
Mr. COOPER. I yield. 
Mr. GORE. The Senator will recall 
that on the night before the resolution 
came to Congress, at the time that our 
forces were responding to the attack, 
President Johnson spoke by radio and 
television to the American people. 
I should like to read a portion of the 
speech of the President. I shall not 
take the time to read that entire address. 
However, this is it, in part: 
But repeated acts of violence against the 
Armed Forces of the United States must be 
met not only with alert defense, but with 
positive reply. That reply is being given as 
I speak to you tonight. Air action is now in 
execution against gunboats and certain sup-
port facilities of North Vietnam which have 
been used in these hostile operations. 
I call this specifically to the attention 
of the Senate and the country in order 
to indicate the atmosphere in which the 
Senate acted. 
I read further from the speech: 
Yet our response for the present will be 
limited and fitting. We Americans know, 
although others appear to forget, the risk of 
spreading conflict. We seek no wider war. 
I have instructed the Secretary of State to 
make this position totally clear to friends 
and to adversaries, and, indeed, to all. 
, In the message t,o Congress the next 
day, there appeared this sentence in the 
message of the President: 
As I have repeatedly made clear, the United 
States intends no rashness and seeks no 
wider war.

Then days after this resolution was 
reed to, to indicate, I think, that the 
resident did not then interpret this 
Solution as being tantamount to a 
edaration of war, he said in a public 
eeth to the American people: 
eome others are eager,to enlarge the con-
let. They call upon us to supply American 
ys to do the job that Asian boys should do. 
ey ask us to take reckless action which 
ight risk the lives of millions, and engulf 
Uch of Asia, and certainly threaten the 
eace of the entire world. Moreover, such 
a tIon would offer no solution at all to the 
^ at problem in Vietnam. 
1 thank the Senator for yielding. I 
I; lied to  read these statements of the 
resident or the United States, both 
ef ore the resolaition was passed and 2 
? as after it was passed, to indicate that 
t e legislative intent was not then, in my 
inion, what it has since been inter-
reted to be. 
Mr. COOPER. I agree that circum-
s ances have changed. But they have 
c anged because Of the continued in-
c 'ease In forces, which has been matched 
?y the other side. 
I said I did not wish to spend too much 
t me discussing the resolution of August 
, 
, except to say that it could have put 
t e Senate upon notice that the progres-
s eovc enud rietd, fhevents entd atlhwr Presidenteah which dcyh although haveapossess,ny occurredauwthweauthority 
dtuyi could
dd ti ahgnphalt 
? e 
Ixtrve such action as he might take in 
tie future, as I saw it, according to the 
, 
s ond paragraph of the resolution. 
But that is past, and we come now to 
t is day, and another legal question is 
^ ised?a stale question, perhaps, by 
ow?in which we are asking, "If we take 
tion today, and pass the bill are we 
f rther approving the policy of the Pres-
i ent of the 'United States?" 
Many say, "1 am not," and of course 
at is their view and their opinion and 
ate of mind. 
I do not think the action we take to-
y will affect the President's powers in 
v way. Even if we should rescind the 
ugust 1064 resolution, we are now en-
ged In a war, and have been engaged 
s nee we passed the resolution. About 
3 ,000 troops were fighting in Vietnam 
t en. Even if we rescind this resolu-
t on today, it could not reduce the pow-
e s Of the President, as Commander In 
[et to carry on a war in which we are 
eseritly engaged. 
As I see it, the only constitutional 
pOwer Congress has to stop the Presi-
' rit's action is to deny him funds. The 
other things we can do are merely ex-
pressions of approval or disapproval. 
But I am bound to say that the ac-
ton we take here in approving this au-
t crization bill, will in my view, at least 
be a measure of approval. It is a way 
o saying to the President, "To this point, 
a least, we do give a kind of approval 
your course of action." That is my 
derstanding of it. Others, of course, 
ve their own positions. , 
hi 
But now I should like to go further, 
e are all trying, as we can, to give the 
resident advice in some way. This de-
bate is the best evidence that we are 
speaking because we are concerned. 
a ? 
Otherwise, there would be no debate 
on the matter. The bill would have been 
passed two weeks ago. While the de-
bate is an indication of concern about 
the policy in Vietnam, it is also an indi-
cation of concern about Vietnam's con-
Seciuences 
We cannot withdraw honorably, we 
cannot surrender, and we cannot afford 
to deny the young men who did not 
choose that battlefield, this measure of 
support. 
So I would say at this point the most 
Important thing that we can accomplish 
In this debate is to try to look ahead, 
and advise the President as to what our 
views are in the hope that they will in-
fluence a restrained course of action. 
I followed the debate in the Foreign 
Relations Committee, and it was a very 
effective debate. I have followed the 
debate on the floor. 
The debate has indicated our concern 
with policy, and I believe it grows out of 
the fear that the war is going to be 
moved up, step by step, until finally we 
may find ourselves in a major war with 
China, unlimited in area and unlimited 
in weapons and forces. No one can say 
that will happen, but it is a concern. 
I noted in the hearings of the Foreign 
Relations Committee, that the chairman 
of the committee and others?including 
my friend, the able Senator from Ten-
nessee [Mr. GORE I, whose questions were 
so incisive?the fear there were no limits 
which were being placed by our country 
upon the expansion of the war. I re-
member the chairman said that he could 
see no limits except surrender by one 
side or the other. 
I would agree that if North Vietnam 
and China intervened and intervened 
and intervened, there might be no limit. 
But I wish to say today I think there 
is a limit which is within the control 
of the United States and its President?
one which is within our control for trial. 
I think that the administration must 
decide whether or not it can maintain 
a situation where negotiations are Pos-
sible. Because if one thing was made 
clear by the debate in the Senate and 
in the Foreign Relations Committee?
and I am not a member of the commit-
tee?it is the firm opinion that this war 
should be settled by negotiation and not 
by a total war. 
Then the question is, "How can we 
maintain such a situation where nego-
tiations may be possible?" 
If force is met by force, there will be 
escalation, until finally there is likely to 
come such an engagement of forces, 
both on our side and on the other side, 
when there will be no possibility of deci-
sion except for war and surrender. 
I do not think that it would be the 
United States which would surrender 
and I do not want to see the enlarge-
ment of the war. The President has the 
power to limit the situation so negotia-
tions will still be possible. 
This means that the battlefield must 
be kept at its narrowest scope consistent 
with the actual security of our forces. 
I was one of those who believed that 
bombing should not be resumed, but that 
is now past: So I would urge today, that 
the battlefield ought to be confined to 
South Vietnam. 
If we move north, and extend bomb-
ing north, and extend it north again, we 
may reach that point where our troops 
are wholly committed and engaged and 
settlement would not be possible, except 
as war determines. And, at some point, 
China may consider that it must make 
its decision about entering the war. 
Mr. PASTORE. Mr. President, will 
the Senator from Kentucky yield? 
Mr. COOPER. I am glad to yield to 
the Senator from Rhode Island. 
Mr. PASTORE. I am very much in 
agreement with what the Senator from 
Kentucky has said, but what disturbs 
me is that we seem to have two schools 
of thought in the Senate, as we seem to 
have two schools of thought in the coun-
try. We have characterized the situ-
ation as the "dove" concept and the 
"hawk" concept. There are those ready 
to blockade Haiphong, to bomb Hanoi, to 
go the full distance if we are in war. 
Their logic is let us try for all-out vic-
tory. Then there are some who feel that 
possibly we should accept the enclave 
theory. 
Mr. President, I listened carefully to 
General Gavin and I believe that by the 
time he finished testifying it was rather 
uncertain exactly what he meant by 
"enclave." So much so that I believe a 
Senator asked him the question categor-
ically whether he was in agreement with 
the administration policy, and I believe 
that he answered in the affirmative. 
The Senator from Kentucky has stated 
that we should make sure it is within the 
power of the President. Indeed, it is 
within the power of the President to 
keep this conflict within reasonable lim-
its, if that is at all possible, consonant 
with the security of our boys. But, Mr. 
President, would it be to the interest of 
this Nation to announce publicly what 
the limits are? Is that not exactly the 
question? 
Mr. COOPER. I have not said that we 
should. I am talking about actual lim-
itations on the battlefield, not announced 
limitations. 
Mr. PASTORE. I know the Senator 
has not said that. 
Mr. COOPER. I have said, though, 
that the Senate should make known?
by our own statements and our advice?
what our position is, with the hope that 
it would influence the decisions of the 
President of the United States. 
Mr. PASTORE. Well now, if the Sen-
ator will indulge me for another moment, 
I believe this issue preoccupies every 
American, particularly Members of Con-
gress, we have responsibility in this prem-
ise for this conflict in Vietnani, and I 
believe it overrides every other matter 
and every other issue that can come be-
fore Congress in this session. We have 
205,000 American souls committed in that 
part of the world?and they had no de-
cision, no choice, in going there. They 
were commanded to go, and out of a 
sense of duty to their country, and their 
patriotism, they are there now. 
What disturbs me is this: I have lis-
tened to many briefings. We have been 
Invited to briefings in the White House. 
We have faithfully attended these brief-

Ing. We have been briefed by the Sec-
retary of Defense the Secretary of State, 
arid Many other officials, including the 
President of the United -States. 
Only a short while ago, the Vice Pres-
ident came back from' tour tour of that area 
- and he briefed us as well. 
The one thing that comforts Me?if 
anyone can gain any comfort at all frorri 
this very confusing and complex situa-
tion?is the tqct that from all the con-
- versations I-have heard from men, in 
high places irilhe GrOverrunent who have 
the power of decision, they have talked in 
a restrained Manner. They have talked 
4n terms which are restrained. 
? -I attended one meeting where certain 
Senators were pushing for greater ef-
forts. The Secretary of Defense then 
? made it abundantly clear?and this has 
been reiterated time and again by the 
Secretary of State?that we have no 
desire to overthrow, the government of 
Hanoi. Further, we have no desire to 
bomb the industrial complex of North 
Vietnam, because we feel that whatever 
ammunition and arms are coming in, 
now being supplied by North Vietnam,' 
are coming in from other places. The 
only bombing we can engage in is that 
bombing which has to do with trans-
portation of men and materiel?lines of 
communication, and the defeat of the 
forces of the Vietcong and the North 
-Vietnamese who are hi South Vietnam. 
Mr. President, I do not know how more 
clearly the President of the United 
States, the Secretary of Defense, and 
the Secretary of State can tell Congress 
and the American people that all that we 
have in Vietnam is a limited political 
objective, and that our whole push is a 
restrained offensive. , 
I know that there are many people 
who say that we should never have gone 
twice in the first place. A long time ago, 
In 1954, in 1961, in 1962, and in 1963, with 
the fall of Diem, that may have been a 
debatable question; but the fact remains 
that we are there riQw. 
I have never heard a responsible per-
sOn say that we should get out. It was 
? refreshing to hear my distinguished col-
league, the Senator from Oregon IMr. 
Moan), state today that he adopts the 
\ Gavin theory. That is going a long way, 
for the Senator from Oregon. I do' not 
say that facetiously, because the Senator 
has been consistent. If any man in the 
Senate has been consistent, it has been 
the Senator from Oregon [Mr. /yroasEl, 
I have not agreed with him, but he has 
been consistent. When he goes so far 
as to say that, he would be willing to ac-
cept the Gavin philosophy, then, in fact, 
he is saying that we cannot get out. We 
Cannot get out, but let us be careful how 
far we go.

ate, every Member of Congress, and every

One wishes to se a nuclear or a thermo-

woUld hope that this Government, 
out of all Of.tbese debates,. out of all of 
the confusing and divergent points of 
view, at some point will sbow and indi-
cate to the mothers of America, whose 
sons are in Vietnam, that there is some 
sense of unanimity in America, at least 
in Congress?on this issue. 
All I am saying is that the man who is 
calling the "shots" is the President of 
the United states. He is the man who 
has the responsibility to make the de-
cision. I do not believe that he is going 
to change overnight. I do not believe 
that he is going to change overnight, be-
cause he has stayed awake long into 
every night trying to figure out what his 
next step should be. 
We cannot go on debating and delay-
ing forever. I do not care what the 
Senator from Oregon says, I do not care 
what the Senator from Arkansas or the 
distinguished chairman of the Commit-
tee on Foreign Relations says, the fact 
is, we cannot change or take away from 
the authority of the President, whether 
we vote for this resolution or not, or 
amend it. We are pommitted. We are 
committed, and we are going to vote this 
money for our boys in Vietnam. These 
men who met yesterday talked it out, 
but they knew in their hearts that there 
was nothing they could do?even though 
they disagreed with the policy?to im-
pede the passage of this proposed legis-
lation. 
We have been told time and again by 
our American military leaders that this 
money is necessary and that this equip-
ment must be sent to our boys. There-
fore, let us not delude ourselves about 
that. We are going to vote for this 
money, with or without an amendment. 
All I am saying to my colleagues is 
this: There is the situation. It is there. 
We are committed. We are committed 
heavily. No matter how much we talk, 
the President of the United States has 
the responsibility of making that deci-
sion, and he will make it today, he will 
make it tomorrow, or he will make it 
next week. 
I say only this, that I pray to God 
that some light from on high will illu-
mine the President's mind to make a 
decision which will be good for the Amer-
ican people and good for peace in the 
world. 
I thank the Senator from Kentucky. 
Mr. COOPER. I also thank the Sen-
ator from Rhode Island for a fine speech, 
but I did not answer his question. 
Mr. PASTORE. Well?sufficiently?
I usually ask a question as a reason to 
make a speech. 
Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, I am 
going to close my remarks in a few min-
utes. Let me point out again that I am 
not questioning the authority of the 
President. I believe that nothing we do 
in the Senate in the way of a resolution 
or amendment can take away his au-
thority as Commander in Chief, except 
to deny him the funds and thus nullify 
or vitiate his authority. But, we can 
advise, and that is what we are talking 
about, and should do. 
The President has stated again and 
again that our objectives in the war are 
limited. I do not doubt his sincerity in 
making this statement, which he has 
made many times. However, there is a 
vast difference between the pronounce-
4213 
ment of limitations, honest as they are, 
and a course or policy which could lead 
to their nullification. 
What I have been pointing out is that 
if while we admit our objective is limi-
tation we still take steps which ex-
tend the conflict?then we will reach 
that point where there can be no settle-
ment possible except by the outcome of 
war. 
There is the possibility now of limiting 
the war to South Vietnam. I am not 
talking about enclaves, but I am talking 
about limiting the war to the territory 
of South Vietnam. I belive with this 
limitation, and with the development of 
the strength of our forces and our sup-
ply system?which is much better than 
the supply system from the north?it 
would be much more difficult for the 
north than for us if the north introduced 
more troops. 
So the war could be limited to its 
narrowest scope, to South Vietnam. The 
limitation would avoid escalation in 
forces and weapons, and help avoid pos-
sible internvention of China as we ap-
proach her borders, either physically or 
by bombing. 
I think this is a power which is in the 
hands of the administration. That is 
my reason for speaking today. 
Mr, MORSE. Mr. President, I shall 
take but a few moments to make a few 
replies to some of the arguments which 
have been made today on the other side 
of the issue. In fairness to my record, 
I think I owe it to myself to make these 
replies. 
Before replying to some of the argu-
ments of the opposition, I wish to have 
the attention of the Senator from 
Arkansas for a moment. 
There is no substitute for scholarship 
in meeting issues and in presenting to 
the Senate information and data in sup-
port of a position taken by a Senator. 
When we go back to reflect on the debate 
of today, we shall recognize that the 
Senator from Arkansas, as is typical of 
him, being the great student that he is, 
made a speech today that is characterized 
by scholarship. 
The eloquent remarks of the Senator 
from Arkansas took us back to the his-
tory of some of the wars of mankind and 
the policies that were followed in the 
ultimate solution of those wars. He 
pointed out that when the solution was 
one of surrender, there was never a peace 
which lasted very long; and when there 
was, as he used the term, a solution of 
accommodation, and there were long 
periods in which at least the combatants 
In such wars lived in peace. 
That is a lesson to learn in the con-
test in which we are now involved. That 
is why I find myself, and have right 
along, holding to the position which the 
Senator from Arkansas so eloquently ex-
pressed today?that we must find an ac-
commodation. 
My great concern with the course of 
action we are following is that it is a 
course of action which seeks surrender. 
Surrender will never give us peace. The 
course of action we are following is based 
primarily upon a unilateral approach by 
the United States in the situation in 
southeast Asia which is not gging to give

Port nt that we work out an accommoda-

Settle the war successfully, if we 
oing to measure success in terms of 
I have said so many times, I have 
not ny doubt that we can bring about 
sue devastation in Asia by our military 
mig t, fighting an enemy at the present 
tint which has no navy, no air force, no 
hea equipment. I have been heard to 
say 0 many times in the last few years 
that we can continue to shoot fish in a 
bar 1?and that is what we are doing. 
We Can bring about great human de-
stru ton by our military might. What 
males us think that will lead to peace? 
Wb 4t makes us think that will lead to the 
typ of accommodation the Senator from 
Ark rises talked about today? 
T at is going to lead us to a world 
whi h for decades to come will be in tur-
mei , and the primary responsibility for 
tha turmoil will be the unilateral course 
of a tion we are following, for the most 
par. 
0 great chairman of the Foreign 
Rel dons Committee made one of the 
gr test contributions in recent weeks 
tow d the offering of an intelligent solu-
tion of a great crisis that any Senator in 
my arty Years in the Senate has made 
in a critical situation. 
r. FULBRICTIIT. Mr. President, will 
he maw' yid d ? 
r. MORSE. I yield. 
r. VULBRIGHT. I wish to express 
my appreciation to the Senator. His 
great contribution has stimulated us to 
thirk about this problem in a way that 
we otherwise would not have. I am 
ple cd indeed he feels that way. My po-
sit! n is implicit in other statements I 
hay made, and I have only tried to carry 
on fortify them. I am pleased that he 
app oyes of it. 
r. MORSE. What the Senator has 
is typical of the generosity of the 
8 tor from Arkansas. I appreciate 
his ?ernarks, but I want him to know I 
app eciate something much more, and 
tha is his friendship. 
r. FULBRIGHT. I thank the Sen-
to from Oregon. 
r. MORSE Let me now say that I 
do ot question in the slightest the sin-
eer y, the high Motivations, the dedica-
tio to our country, and the loyalty to 
Our country of all my colleagues in the 
Se ie, whether or not they hold views 
con r ary to mine. 
e have had great differences of opin-
ion in the last 2i/2 years over the matter 
of ?reign policy, and those differences 
wil continue. The vote is not going to 
set le them today. The vote will tern-
por ily in this body stop discussion, but 
it ill settle nothing in this great con-
tes which is reaching the grassroots of 
thi country. The American people are 
goi g to make clear to our Government, 
as he French people made clear to the 
Fr eh Government, that our continued 
p tioijaation in this war wilt not con-
tin e to have public support._ 
e vote today will not more settle 
an thing than did the vote on the Ton-
kin Lay resolution. 
Only time will be the judge of what I 
have said. But so far as this Senator is 
concerned, short of a declaration a war 
I am going to continue to oppose our 
foreign policy in respect to this war. 
That foreign policy must change. 
Xs FREE DEBATE UNPATRIOTIC? 
I turn to the first point that was made 
against me this afternoon. I say 
"against me" because it certainly was an 
argument to which I hold the opposite 
point of view. 
I do not question the sincerity of those 
any more than I question the sincerity 
of the Senator from Illinois who made 
the statements that the Senator from 
Oregon is quoted in Peiping, Hanoi, Mos-
cow, and quoted in other Communist 
areas of the world. 
I do not intend to let a bunch of Com-
munists silence my lips. If I can be in-
fluential in changing the foreign policy 
of my country in the interest of preserv-
ing freedom and giving a greater assur-
ance of a legacy of freedom to be handed 
down to future generations of American 
boys and girls, no Communists in Hanoi 
or Peiping are going to stop me. 
These issues are fundamental and basic 
and our differences are honest and sin-
cere. The argument that those of us 
who are trying to get changes in this bill 
are letting down our boys in southeast 
Asia loses me completely. 
I say respectfully that in my judgment 
we do not protect those by waving the 
flag into tatters. Those of us who try to 
follow the program so brilliantly and elo-
quently outlined by the Senator from 
Arkansas this afternoon, and which, in 
my humble and inadequate way, I have 
been urging on the floor of the Senate for 
a long, long time past, are not letting 
down these boys in Asia. 
We are trying to stop increased kill-
ing of our men which, in my judgment, 
we are going to become guilty of as a 
nation if we follow our present policy 
and if we authorize the new policy that 
is inherent in this bill. 
Mr. President, if the stamp of approval 
is put on this policy this afternoon, in 
my judgment, we are on our way to a 
further escalation and expansion of this 
war that is going to call for many more 
thousands of men in southeast Asia. 
I pointed out on Friday, I pointed out 
last night, and I pointed out earlier to-
day in my speech that this administra-
tion, in its own statement of policy 
through its Secretary of Defense, in his 
testimony before our committee, admits 
that this bill will authorize an additional 
452,843 military personnel within this 
period of 1966-67. There is already 
talk of 800,000 additional men, if we find 
there is an escalated speedup in South 
Vietnam because of what may happen on 
the part of the program of our enemies. 
My good friend from Arkansas and I 
disagree on how to implement this mat-
ter. I will come to that later. I wish to 
point out that when those of us trying 
to follow the program of the Senator 
from Arkansas do so, we are trying to 
create a situation where this country will 
not have to be sending, in round num-
bers, 500,000 additional men over there. 
We cannot send 500,000 additional men 
over there without enlarging the war 
and increasing the killing of larger num-
bers of them. Those of us who oppose 
this war feel we have no business there 
there on that scale. 
The Senator from Rhode Island is cor-
rect. The Senator from Oregon from the 
beginning has taken the position that we 
had no business getting involved there 
and creating the situation we created. 
We cannot pull stake and get out. 
I have said over and over, and I am 
sure ad nauseam to some Senators, that 
if we just pulled stakes and got out, 
mankind would then probably be con-
fronted with the greatest human mas-
sacre ever known because through 
whichever side is stronger over there, it 
would be a blood bath. That is why 
there has to be a position taken where 
there is power to stop the blood bath. 
But we have the defensive position 
where other nations, noncombatant na-
tions, can come in to enforce a peace. 
That is what is needed and that is what 
the enclave theory is going to provide 
for. 
What was one of the main points of 
the arguments of General Gavin, as the 
Senator from Arkansas has said? We 
have to make use of what we have. We 
should not follow a program of expand-
ing. We should take these positions that 
will protect the Vietnamese and our 
soldiers. 
That does not mean, as he pointed out, 
that we are going to retreat. When 
asked in the hearing he made clear he 
is advocating no retreat, but a holding 
operation. He is not going to permit the 
Vietcong to advance. 
Of course, this strategy will help pro-
vide for the accommodation that the 
Senator from Arkansas is pleading for 
because it brings to an end the exten-
sion of the war and this bill will extend 
it further and in an alarming degree as 
I shall point out in just a moment. 
Then, it provides an opportunity for 
other nations that are not combatants 
to take advantage of what is their clear 
obligation to come in with peacekeeping 
approaches, including peacekeeping 
forces, if necessary; separate the com-
batants, stop the warmaking. 
Then, the interesting thing is that if 
it gets into that situation where people 
start coming to their senses and the na-
tions start coming to their senses, there 
will be the beginning of negotiations. 
Of course, General Gavin pointed out 
that if we follow the course of action we 
are now following, with more and more 
bombing into North Vietnam, it will be 
only a matter of time before we shall be 
bombing urban centers. Urban centers, 
he said. Once we begin the bombing 
of urban centers, the situation cannot 
be controlled. Once we get into the situ-
ation of bombing cities, let us face it: 
we cannot bomb Hanoi today, without 
bombing a large number of Russians, 
for there are many Russians in Hanoi. 
They are there giving technical assist-
ance and advisory assistance for the de-
fense of Hanoi and other defense centers 
of North Vietnam. 
Then the great danger will be that 
when we begin to bomb urban centers in 
North Vietnam, as was pointed out by 
the Senator from Texas [Mr. Yint-
Approved For Release 2005/07/13: CIA-RDP67600446R000400050008-5 
March 1, 1'966 Approved FewatEmegwrik~DpwomoR000400050008-5 4215 
sortovonl, we shall be only seconds away 
from the Chinese border. When we be-
gin to drop bombs within 30 miles of 
China proper?and we have already 
done so?think of what a miscalculation 
can do, what a mistake can do, what the 
dropping of a bomb on China can do. 
There are no risks of an escalated 
war? There are no risks of a war with 
China? It is beyond my power of com-
prehension to assume that there is no 
danger of war with China. We are liv-
ing 24 hours of the day and night under 
the danger of a war with China, which 
can be caused even by a miscalculation. 
So many of us are urging that the 
program of a great military strategist 
of our country, General Gavin, be fol-
lowed. It was not so long ago, when he 
was in uniform, that we recognized how 
fortunate we were to have such a bril-
liant mind exercise strong influence in 
the development of American military 
strategy. His being out of uniform in 
no way, so far as the senior Senator 
from Oregon is concerned, diminishes 
his intellectual ability. I shall continue 
to heed him. 
We find General Gavin's views but-
tressed by those of former Ambassador 
George Kennan, who in effect said the 
same thing?that we ought to make use 
of what we have; we ought to take a 
holding position; we ought to take a de-
fensive position, where the Vietcong can-
not advance, but where we will not ad-
vance and carry on the war at an ex-
panded rate. He is a witness whom we 
ought to heed. 
As my chairman knows, I think we 
have just started to listen to the wit-
nesses we ought to hear. As he knows, I 
have submitted to the committee a list 
of witnesses who I think ought to be 
called in a public hearing, for the Amer-
ican people are entitled to have their 
foreign policy discussed in public hear-
ings of the Committee on Foreign Re-
lations. We have yet to hear our first 
China expert. We have yet to hear our 
first constitutional law authority. We 
have yet to hear our first international 
law authority. 
But I am not going to be deterred 
from urging the type of approach that 
the distinguished Senator from Arkan-
sas [Mr. Furinacirr], chairman of the 
Committee on Foreign Relations, has 
urged in his eloquent, brilliant, and 
scholarly speech this afternoon, when 
he said we ought to make an approach 
to accommodation, if we want peace. If 
we want to annihilate the enemy, let us 
stop talking about accommodation; but 
also just forget about peace, because 
that course of action will result in a 
heritage of intense Asiatic hatred to-
ward future generations of American 
boys and girls. All we are doing is con-
demning our future generations to mas-
sive burdens and possible destruction?
if that does not occur even while we are 
still alive, in our generation. 
What makes us think that the United 
States will be allowed to maintain a foot-
hold of domination anywhere in Asia? 
The Asiatics will throw us out, if it takes 
50 or 100 years to do it. We ought to be 
thinking further into the future. I re-
spectfully say that, in my opinion, not 
very much thought is being given to it 
at the present time by very many. 
CONGRESSIONAL CHECK THROUGH PURSE 
STRINGS 
The second argument that was ad-
vanced against me this afternoon, re-
lated to the constitutional check of Con-
gress through the purse strings. My 
good friend from Georgia [Mr. Rus-
SELL] said he recognized that we have 
the control of the purse strings. That 
is a check. I am merely asking, "Why 
don't you use it in this bill?" The Sen-
ate has before it an authorization bill for 
more than $4 billion. It will move on to 
an appropriation. It will be passed; and 
as I said earlier this afternoon, merely 
provide the military with the money, 
and the military will spend it. They 
will find ways to spend it. What I seek 
to do as of now, until we can try to work 
out a program of accommodation such 
as the Senator from Arkansas has 
spoken about, is to stop increasing the 
money we give the military. 
But it is said that we will be letting 
down the boys. Of course not. The 
purpose of the check is to force the 
President to change his foreign policy. 
The regular Defense Department funds 
are not affected. But this bill is for an 
increase, and that is what should be 
checked. 
That is what I am pleading for. I am 
saying that we should not give the Presi-
dent this additional authority and 
money. We have this checking author-
ity; in my judgment, we should use it. 
Deny the President the money. That 
will not be letting down the boys; it will 
be saving the lives of thousands of them, 
because we will change the President's 
policy, and he will be forced to move into 
a defensive position which will not in 
any way weaken the security of our 
country. 
So I am a little at a loss to understand 
how in one breath my opposition can talk 
about the purse strings being a check, 
and then with the next breath say, "Of 
course, we should not exercise this check 
against the President, became, after all, 
he is the Commander in Chief. He is in 
charge; therefore, we should give him 
what he wants." 
I have been arguing that the time has 
come to stop giving the President what 
he wants. In my judgment, the Presi-
dent is leading us into the increasing 
danger of massive war that can lead to 
world war III. 
The checking principle of the Consti-
tution means exactly what it says. The 
responsibility of Congress is to exercise 
the check. Go ahead and give the Presi-
dent everything he wants. If we con-
tinue to do so, then stop talking to me 
about using the purse strings as a check. 
Here and now, in this bill, are the time 
and place to exercise that check. If we 
are ever going to exercise the check of 
the purse string, now is the time. Do 
not forget what the Secretary of Defense 
has said. I have quoted it before; I shall 
do so briefly again. If there is any ques-
tion as to the policy contained in this 
bill, so far as the authority to extend the 
war in southeast Asia is concerned, the 
Secretary of Defense gave his answer 
when Senator SMITH asked the question: 
Mr. Secretary, are there plans to escalate 
and step up the offensive in Vietnam? 
Secretary McNamara replied: 
Well, there are preparations being made, 
and they are reflected in this fiscal 1966 sup-
plement, for substantially increasing our de-
ployments. 
What does that mean? It means our 
manpower. Secretary McNamara later 
in the hearings stated: 
The figure I have given in round num-
bers?
Four hundred and fifty thousand 
men?
increasing our deployments to South Viet-
nam and raising the rate of activity of our 
air units. 
That means obtaining the money so 
that we can expand the policy and the 
air battles and the airpower. That is the 
policy. I am merely asking that we 
check the President and not give him 
that authorization. 
As to all the talk about not going to 
supply the material for these boys, I 
simply say that me must not expand the 
operations. As the Senator from Ar-
kansas pointed out in his comment, we 
already have too much of a backlog and 
delivery problem to even take care of the 
manpower that we presently have over 
there. It will take many months to 
build the installations called for in the 
bill in order to accommodate the ships 
and the delivery of materiel. 
Mr. President, we are not going to be 
letting any boys down unless we continue 
to expand this war while they are in a 
situation in which we cannot even de-
liver to them all of the supplies as rap-
idly as we want to deliever them at the 
present time. 
We have already overextended our-
selves. We have already gone too far 
both in sending manpower and in the 
rate of the hostilities that we are con-
ducting. 
HOW BIG A WAR CAN WE WAGE WITIIOUT 
DECLARING WAR? 
I come very briefly to the constitutional 
argument. We again hear about the res-
olution of the house of delegates of the 
American Bar Association. - 
It is only a resolution. The Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations wired the 
American Bar Association and asked for 
a memorandum in support of the reso-
lution. The committee asked for a doc-
umentation that would support the con-
clusion. No documentation has been re-
ceived. 
However, I have been advised as to 
what happened. The house of delegates 
of the American Bar Association is char-
acterized by a good many characteristics 
of a political institution. 
I have been advised by one who sat 
there during the meetings that there 
were emotional and political speeches. 
I repeat that, in my judgment, this war 
is an unconstitutional war and it has 
been from the very beginning. 
Mr. President, on last Friday I set 
forth at some great length in the RECORD 
the material discussing the constitu-
tional debates on article I, section 8, of 
the Constitution, when the declaration 
of war section was written into the Con-
Approved For Release 2005/07/13: CIA-RDP67600446R000400050008-5

31:arch, 1. 1966 
siltation, and when the debates were 
I ad as to whether there should be a 
declaration of war and power to make 
war. 
Will TY! found that I quoted from 
-Hamilton. 1 rotated from the Federalist 
Pagers. I quoted from the Constitu-
tional Fathers, which quotations made 
it perfectly clear that what they were 
:inciting to do was to prevent the Presi-
dent of the United States from having 
the power of the King of England to 
make war. They sought to vest that 
-:-)0IV Cr in the Congress of the United 
;a Lams. 
There In is not been one word uttered 
this debate that changes what the 
Constitutional Fathers said and ob-
viihisly intended. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
son( that that material from ray speech

was ordered to be printed in the RECORD?

the Constitution under consideration, would 
appertain to the Legislature." 
Me. MORS3E. Mr. President, I have 
nom time to time quoted one eonstitu-
al authority after another in regard 
La ibis matter. I quoted great American 
emiters such as Professor Commager, of 
.nonlairat University, who talked to me 
length the other morning on the long-
distance telephone. He told me?and I 
:say this with immodesty, I know?that I 
we s correct in the many statements that 
r have :made on the history of article I, 
eaction 8 of the Constitution, and as to 
al at hannened in the Constitutional

nave been in the position I have taken

Tao argument was made this morning 
hy fly good friend, the senior Senator

'so is a President alone had sent men

etlint i.011

add D 11 of Om mistakes and all of the 
wrongs, one on another, and never end 
w: in a summation of right. 
'u'' nod of practices that have 
no constitutional basis does not make 
the practices constitutional. Let; us not 
'..orttet that, as a result of some of the 
,'cam ales that, were cited of sending the 
Marines to certain places, we are still 
"tying the price. We are still paying 
the terrible twice, the loss of confidence 
its, and the loss of prestige because 
we misused I,ne Marines at the times a 
l'resident sent, them in. 
In Latin America, this has been re-
ferred to as an example of shocking 
American military intervention. 
T do not want to see my country con-
tinue that. I want to see my country get 
back inside of the Constitution. How-
ever, Mr. President, I have discussed my 
views with regard to the international 
aspects of tins matter with a recognized 
international lawyer such as Ben Cohen, 
who has, because of his Millianey in the 
field of international law, represented 
the United States in a consideraine num-
ber of international conferences. 
Mr. President, over year am), I had 
printed in the Rricona that great trea-
tise of Ben Cohen in respset to the in-
ternational law aspects of this problem, 
using him as my authority. 
I called him on yesterday and talked 
to him about it again. He again veri-
fied the position I have been taking in 
regard to the international law aspects 
of this problem. 
I have used the win-Clogs of the great 
Edward Corwin on our Constitution and 
on the power of the Presidency, sustain-
ing my position. 
I have used the writings of Prof. 
Roger Fisher, of Harvard. 
Mr. President, as I have said now for 
2y2 years, in my judgment, we have been 
following an illegal course of action in 
southeast Asia in respect to our Consti-
tution. There is no doubt about our 
frequent violations of the United Na-
tions Charter. 
Mr. President, as an old law leacher, 
I know the importance of dm:union-
tat ion. 
On last Friday I had printed in the 
RECORD a memorandum of law, prepared 
by a group of American lawyers, which 
holds a view different from thar of the 
American Bar Association, together with 
a letter of transmittal from that group, 
submitting the memorandum to the 
President of the United States under 
date cif January 25, 1963. I do not en-
dorse every proposition is it; but It, poses 
the issues that are still unsettled and 
unsolved. 
I ask unanimous consent that, at the 
close of my remarks, this material be 
printed in the REcona. it appear ii in the 
CONGRESSION.AL RECORD of Febru afar 25, 
1966, at pages 3996 to 4904. 
The PRESIDING OF.ACFR, Without 
objection, it, is SO ordered. 
(See exhibit 1.) 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, come 
now to the Tonkin Bay resolution. 
I CIO say to my friend, the Senator 
from Alaska, that I shall alwa?ys be proud, 
Us I am sure he will be proud, to have our 
grandchildren read that we did not vote 
for the resolution in August 1164. I 
would not vote for a renewal of tne reso-
Intion becaitse, in my judgment, it, sought 
to recognize a power tha ; a President of 
the United States does not have. 
There was some talk earlier today by 
the Senator from Georgia Mr. RlissEiml 
who talked?about the Lebanon resolu-
tion, and about the Cuban resolution, 
and also, I think, about the Formosa 
resolution. 
Mr. President, the Cuban resolution?
let me say it again?the Cuban resolu-
tion differs from all the other resolu-
tions, because it did not give the Pres-
ident any power to make war. 
The majority leader knows why it did 
not. I will refresh his memory by re-
minding him that the Senate accepted 
the proposal I made to modify the Cuban 
resolution. It would not contain any 
language giving war power to the Pres-
ident as did the Formosa resolution and 
the Labonon resolution. That; is not in 
the Cuban resolution. The Senator from 
Oregon was responsible for its being 
taken out. And only because it was 
taken out, the Senator from Oregon voted 
for that resolution. I voted aga,nist the 
Formosa resolution; I voted against the 
Lebanon resolution. I have voted against 
every resolution that has been presented 
in the Senate which seeks to /nye the 
President the power to make war, be-
cause, in my judgment, we cannot give 
him that power. Congress must declare 
war. 
MAJOR MILITARY EFFORTS HAVE :FOLLOWED WAR. 
MESSAGES, NOT PRECEDED THEM. 
Mr. President, there has been a lot of 
talk here today about the power of the 
President as Commander in Chief. The 
President, as Commander in Chief, does 
not have the power to make a war. The 
President, as Commander in Chief, has 
the power to respond immediately to the 
self-defense needs of our Nation. The 
President had the power, as Commander 
in Chief, to respond immediately to any 
attack that was made upon us on the 
high seas in Tonkin Bay. The then 
President of the United States, Franklin 
Delano Roosevelt, had the power to re-
spond immediately after Pearl Harbor 
to the self-defense needs of this Repub-
lic. But he recognized that he also had 
the obligation to ask Congress for a dec-
laration of war. 
Last Friday, I put in the RECORD the 
war message of Franklin Roosevelt fol-
lowing Pearl Harbor and the war mes-
sage of Woodrow Wilson on April 2, 1917, 
before a joint session of Congress, when 
he gave his reasons as to why he thought 
the Congress, under article I, seetion a 
of the Constitution, should declare war 
mageanitn.st the German imperial Govern-
' wish to take a moment, if Uri Sen-
ators will bear with me, to find that 
declaration, because once again, I wish 
to read the first paragraph of tlan great 
war message of Woodrow Wilson. 
I do not have to refresh the memorY 
of the Senators as to the understanding 
of that great American historian. Prior 
to entering politics, he was one of the 
great historians of the time. He was 
more than a historian; he was one of the 
great scholars of American political sci-
ence, one of the great profesioni at, 
Princeton University. 
I read the first paragraph frosa the 
message of Woodrow Wilson on that his-
toric night in April 1917: 
I have called the Congress into cxtaitordi-
nary session because there are serious, very 
serious, choices of policy to be made, and 
made immediately, which it was neither 
right nor constitutionally permissiblo that 
I should assume the responsibility of mak-
ing. 
He knew his constitutional history. He 
knew his constitutional law. He knew

March 1, 1966 CONGRESSIoN A 
L RECORD 
that as President of the United States, 
he was without constitutional authority 
to make war against the German Im-
perial Government without a declaration 
of war by the Congress. Mr. President, 
I am perfectly willing to rest my case 
on this issue with Woodrow Wilson. 
Mr. GRUENING. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield? 
Mr. MORSE. I yield to the Senator 
from Alaska. 
Mr. GRUENING. I should like to say, 
in connection with the allusion of the 
Senator from Oregon to the Tonkin 
Gulf resolution, that it is difficult to un-
derstand why it was not clear at the 
time when that resolution was drafted at 
the White House, sent to Congress, and 
approved by a great majority, that it, 
itself, was a violation of the very kind 
to which the Senator is addressing him-
self. 
The Tonkin Bay resolution, in its op-
ening paragraph, spoke of the attacks 
on naval vessels, and said they "have 
thereby created a serious threat to in-
ternational peace." 
"A serious threat to international 
peace." But article 33 of the United 
Nations Charter, to which we are a sig-
natory, said that, "the parties to any 
dispute, the continuance of which is 
likely to endanger the maintenance of 
international peace and security"?those 
very same words?"shall, first of all, seek 
a solution by negotiation," and it names 
eight alternatives: negotiation, inquiry, 
mediation, conciliation, arbitration, 
judicial settlement, resort to regional 
agencies or arrangements, or other 
peaceful means. 
That resolution was a violation of the 
United Nations Charter and its purpose. 
We were as violative of that charter as 
we have charged the other people of 
being. 
Mr. MORSE. As the Senator from 
Alaska knows, I completely agree with 
him. I am just not going to give into the 
United Nations aspects of this tonight, 
because if I started, in justice to the sub-
ject, it would take a long time. But as 
the Senator knows, I have argued here 
for two and a half years that we have 
violated at least 13 articles of the United 
Nations Charter in our course of conduct 
in southeast Asia, and we have violated 
section after section of the Geneva ac-
cords. 
It is no alibi to say that we did not sign 
them, and then at the same time say we 
are in there, in part, because the North 
Vietnamese are violating them. We 
cannot have it both ways, Mr. President. 
Mr. GRUENING. If the Senator will 
yield further, of course we gave uni-
lateral approval, and, through Under 
Secretary of State Walter Bedell Smith, 
said we would adhere to 12 of the 13 
articles. 
Mr. MORSE. I agree with the Sena-
tor. I made my case on that last Fri-
day, as I have made it many times here-
tofore. 
I only wish to say now, Mr. President, 
that from the beginning, when we took 
this little Vietnamese exile by the name 
of Diem out of Washington, D.C., and 
No. 36-10 
out of Paris, who had never fought the 
French, militarized him, and set him up 
as our first puppet President of South 
Vietnam, we violated the Geneva accords. 
The Geneva accords? do not provide for 
two governments in Vietnam. The 17th 
parallel was nothing but a line of de-
marcation separating the military forces 
of the Vietminh and the French. That 
is what that 17th parallel was for. 
The accords then provided for 2 years 
to work out, under the direction and 
jurisdiction of an International Control 
Commission represented by India, Can-
ada, and Poland, arrangements for an 
election in July 1956, that would estab-
lish a government and a reunification of 
all Vietnam. 
That is what the Geneva accord called 
for. Who divided Vietnam? The 
United States. That is our record. Of 
course, we are going to hear about that 
when we get into the councils of the 
world. There does not seem to be much 
enthusiasm for getting into an open 
world debate on Vietnam in the Security 
Council; but I am still hoping it will 
come, and if it does not come, then I 
wish to repeat very quickly here, my 
President ought to get before the Gen-
eral Assembly of the United Nations and 
make a plea to the world for that Gen-
eral Assembly to take over its peacekeep-
ing functions in South Vietnam, and stop 
the danger of this war escalating into a 
holocaust. 
FLOOR MANAGER DOES NOT CONTROL POLICY 
Then, Mr. President, there is another 
point on which my good friend, the Sena-
tor from Arkansas [Mr. FULBRIGHT], and 
I may not see eye to eye, although I fully 
understand his point of view. I believe 
that the situation of the Senator from 
Georgia [Mr. RUSSELL], is quite different 
on this bill from the situation of the 
Senator from Arkansas, the chairman of 
the Foreign Relations Committee, on the 
Tonkin Bay resolution. There is no am-
biguity in this bill, to justify any legis-
lative history, as there was in the Tonkin 
Bay resolution. 
For the Senator from Georgia from 
Georgia to say that it does not involve 
policy does not erase the record of the 
administration as to what the policy of 
the bill is. It contains new authority 
which makes it possible to escalate the 
war. The Secretary of Defense says so, 
that it is a decision for further escalation, 
to be made by the President. He has not 
made it yet, but we are going to give him 
all the materiel, all the manpower, and 
all the money for the escalation of the 
war. 
Mr. President, that is what I am pro-
testing. It is that policy which should 
be stopped. 
Now is the time to check the President. 
He must not be placed in a position that 
he can exercise his discretion to escalate 
the war and send increasing numbers 
of American boys to their deaths in 
southeast Asia. 
As I stated earlier, in my judgment, 
southeast Asia is not worth the life of a 
single one of our boys. It is not our uni-
lateral responsibility. It is the responsi-
bility of the nations of the world, who 
have committed themselves to keep the 
peace, to start living up to their obliga-
tions. 
Therefore, I dismiss the point by saying 
that nothing which the Senator from 
Georgia has said can make legislative 
history for the simple reason that unless 
a bill is ambiguous, then anything the 
Senator in charge of the bill states is 
superfluous. We know what the intent 
is. It is that intent which I am pro-
testing. That is why I do not believe 
that the statements of the Senator from 
Georgia help my friend the Senator from 
Arkansas [Mr. FULBRIGHT], one iota in 
regard to the policy which is spelled out 
in the bill. 
Mr. President, first, a vote for my 
amendment would be a vote to make clear 
to the President that those who vote for 
the amendment disapprove of the con-
tinuation of the exercise of the power he 
has been exercising under the Tonkin 
Bay resolution. 
A vote against the bill would constitute 
a check on the purse strings, in order to 
deny to the President the authoriy that 
the bill would give him to expand the 
war. For it is an expansion of the war 
which I believe is so dangerous. It is 
an expansion of the war which I fear 
would lead us to a war with China and 
eventually with Russia. 
Mr. President, it is a risk we should 
not take. That is why I say that we 
should take the General Gavin program, 
the so-called holding operation, and then 
use that time period in order to urge 
other nations to come in and enforce the 
peace. 
I make this plea to the chairman of 
my committee: A vote for the authoriza-
tion bill will be a vote which will not 
strengthen those in the American popu-
lation who, in my judgment, in increas-
ing millions, wish the United States to 
follow a course of action whereby the 
war will not be escalated. 
A vote against the bill, in my opinion, 
would strengthen those within American 
public opinion who, in increasing num-
bers, are urging a change in our course 
of action in the operation of our foreign 
policy in southeast Asia. 
A vote for this bill on the part of any 
Senator who has great reservations about 
the Tonkin Bay resolution, who has great 
reservations which many have expressed, 
In terms of fear as to what may happen 
in Vietnam, even by miscalculation, or 
direct planning on the part of the ad-
ministration to expand the war, would be 
a vote to weaken those in American pub-
lic opinion who, in increasing numbers, 
in my judgment, are insisting that our 
foreign policy in southeast Asia be 
changed. 
The only alternative left the Amer-
ican people, if Congress will not carry 
out, in this instance, its power of check 
through the purse strings, would be for 
them to take the issue to the polls. I 
shall be one who will urge them to take 
to the polls, because I believe that every 
procedure available to the American 
people, under our constitutional system,

should be exercised with them to check 
the expansion of this war, to increase 
thereby the possibility of finding a 
peaceful solution or, as the Senator from 
Arkansas has said, an accommodation 
which will lead to peace. 
Mr. President, I wish to put into the 
1.,!,ceose the conclusion of that great re-
port of my majority leader which sets 
forth, for those who will read it, the 
warning signs of where we may be going 
in southeast Asia if we follow the au-
thorization of this bill, if we give to 
the administration the authority to ex-
pand the war, which this authority 
would give to the administration, de-
Pendent only upon the decision of the 
President of the United States. 
Mr. President, speaking most respect-
fully of my President, and I make no 
personal comment. I will not vote to give 
to this President, or to any President, 
the kind of discretionary power which 
the bill would give to him. As the Sec-
retary of Defense states, the President 
gave instructions to submit this bill to 
provide for all these authorities which 
will result, if they are exercised, in an 
escalation of the war, all dependent upon 
the discretionary decision of the Presi-
dent of the United States. 
Mr. President, we should not give it to 
any man--no man; and if we give it to 
any mere man, with all the frailties that 
every man possesses, we will weaken our 
system of constitutional checks, and we 
will enhance the growing danger in this 
country of a government by men and 
not of law. We would also increase the 
danger of a government by executive 
supremacy, instead of a government 
which would preserve the precious sys-
tem of three coordinate and coequal 
branches of government. 
Mr, President, I rest my case.

il'A'I'ERS COMMITTEE ON AMERICAN 
:emicy TOWARD VIETNAM, 
Nen York, N.Y., January 25, 1966. 
i,VINDON B. JOHNSON, 
President of the United States, 
Washington, 
Mr. PRESIDENT ! Following the issuance by 
ihe Department of State in March 1965 of a 
memorandum captioned "Legal Basis for U.S. 
Actions Against North Vietnam," our com-
mittee, in consultation with leading author-
itief; in the fields of international law and 
constitutional law, undertook to research the 
legal issues, culminating in the memorandum 
of law (here enclosed). 
Our committee's memorandum of law has 
been endorsed, among others, by Profs. 
Quincy Wright, of the University of Virginia; 
Wolfgang Friedmann, of Columbia Univer-
sity; Thomas T. Emerson, of Yale; Richard A. 
Falk, of Princeton; Norman Malcolm, of Cor-
nell; D. F? Fleming, of Vanderbilt; David 
Haber, of Rutgers; Roy M. Mersky, of the 
University of 'I'exas; William G. Rice, of the 
University of Wisconsin; Chancellor Robert 
M. tVlacIver, of the New School for Social 
Research; Profs. Robert C. Stevenson, of 
Idaho State University; Alexander W. Rud-
zineki, of Columbia; Darrell Randell, of the 
American University in Washington, D.C.: 
:fed Profs, Wallace McClure and William W. 
Van Alstyne, both from Duke University and 
the World Rule of Law Center. 
For the reasons documented in our memo-
rancium our committee has reached the re-
grettable but inescapable conclusion that the 
actions of the United States in Vietnam con-
travene the essential provisions if the United 
Nations Charter, to which we are bound by 
treaty; violate the Geneva accords which we 
pledged to observe; are not sanctioned by the 
treaty creating the Southeast Asia Treaty 
Organization; and violate our own Constitu-
tion and the system of checks end balances 
which is the heart of it, by the prosecution 
of the war in Vietnam without; a congres-
sional declaration of war. 
The principal argument adva need in the 
State Department's memorandum is that 
our Government's action in Vietnam is justi-
fied under article 51 of the United Nations 
Charter sanctioning "individual or collective 
self-defense if an armed attack occurs against 
a member of the United Nations." However, 
South Vietnam is indisputably Apt a mem-
ber of the tmited Nations and, indeed, under 
the Geneva accords of 1954, is merely a tem-
porary zone. Moreover, since the Geneva 
accords recognized all of Vietnam as a single 
state, the conflict in Vietnam is -civil strife" 
and foreign intervention is forbidden. We do 
well to recall that President Lincoln, in the 
course of our Civil War to preserve the union 
of the North, and the South, vigorously op-
posed British and French threats to inter-
vene in hehalf of the independance of the 
Confederacy. 
In addition, the right of collective self-
defense under article 51 is limit(xl to those 
nations which are within a regional com-
munity which history and geography have 
developed into a regional collective defense 
system. The United States?a country sep-
arated by oceans and thousands of miles 
from southeast Asia and lackin4 historical 
or ethnic connections with the peoples of 
that area--cannot qualify as a bona fide 
member of a regional collective defense sys-
tem for southeast Asia. 
The State Department's memorandum also 
contends that the actions of the United 
States "being defensive in characer and de-
signed to resist armed aggression, are wholly 
consistent with the purposes and principles 
of the caarter and specifically with article 
2, paragraph 4." Yet article 2, paragraph 4, 
declares in clear and unambiguous language 
that "all members shall refrain in their in-
ternational relations from the threat or use 
of force against the territorial integrity or 
political independence of any state or in any 
other manner inconsistent with the purposes 
of the United Nations." 
The State Department's memonnidum also 
attempts to justify our Govermnent's ac-
tions in Vietnam on the ground that the 
"North Vietnamese have repeatedly violated 
the 1954 Geneva accords." But this state-
ment ignores our Government's antecedent 
violations of the pledges we made On July 
21, 1954, Under Secretary of State Walter 
Bedell Smith in a declaration confirmed by 
President Eisenhower, pledged that. our Gov-
ernment would not "disturb" the Geneva 
accords and would "not join in all arrange-
ment which would hinder" the rights of 
peoples "to determine their own future." 
However, the United States departed from 
these pledges when, on July 16, 1955, the 
Diem regime announced with American back-
ing, that it would defy the provision calling 
for national elections, thus violating the 
central condition which had made the 
Geneva accords acceptable to the Vietminh. 
And the United States also chose to ignore 
the ban on the introduction of troops, mili-
tary personnel, arms, and munitions into 
Vietnam, and the prohibition against the 
establishment of new military bases in Viet-
nam territory?provisions set out in the Ge-
neva accords. It is an historical fact that 
the refusal to hold the elections prescribed 
by the Geneva accords, coupled with the 
reign of terror and suppression instituted by 
the Diem regime, precipitated the civil war. 
In the light of the foregoing, more fully 
detailed and documented in the enclosed 
memorandum, we submit, Mr. President, that 
the State Department has incorrectly advised 
you as to the legality of U.S. actions against 
Vietnam. 
We further submit, Mr. President, that the 
frequent citation of the pledges given by 
Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy to aid 
South Vietnam afford no justification for 
U.S. intervention in Vietnam. President 
Eisenhower has stated that his administra-
tion had made no commitment to South 
Vietnam "in terms of military support on 
programs whatsoever." President Kennedy 
insisted that the war in Vietnam was "their 
war" and promised only equipment and 
military advisers. Hence the historical facts 
fail to support the point advanced. Beyond 
this, these Presidential pledges do not even 
have the status of treaties, not having been 
ratified by the Senate. Manifestly, the obli-
gations assumed by our Government under 
the United Nations Charter, with the advice 
and consent of the Senate, transcend any 
Presidential pledge undertaken vis-a-vis the 
South Vietnamese regime. 
Our Government has often urged that our 
presence in South Vietnam is solely to pre-
serve freedom for its people and to uphold 
the democratic process. Yet the series of 
regimes supported by the United States in 
South Vietnam have been authoritarian in 
character, quite without populer support 
and largely indifferent to the welfare of the 
local population. Ambassador Henry Cabot 
Lodge, on June 30, 1964, commenting on the 
consequences of massive Americau involve-
ment in Vietnam, stated, "Well, that means 
we become a colonial power and I think it's 
been pretty well established that colonialism 
is over. I believe that if you start doing that 
you will get all kinds of unfortunate results: 
you'll stir up antiforeign feeling; there'll be 
a tendency to lay back and let the Americans 
do it and all that. I can't think that it's a 
good thing to do. 
As we have stated, our committee has also 
come to the painful conclusion that our 
Government's action in Vietnam violates the 
clear provision of our Constitution which 
vests in Congress exclusively the power to 
declare war--a power not constitutionally 
granted to the President. The debates in 
the Constitutional Convention at Philadel-
phia make explicitly clear that wan-making 
was to be a purely legislative prerogative and 
the President was not to have the power to 
wage a war or "commit" our Nation to the 
waging of a war, although the Executive was 
intended to have the power to repel sudden 
attacks. 
In pointing out that the President lacks 
constitutional power to make war, our com-
mittee does not imply that a declaration of 
war by the Congress is desirable. Rather, we 
mean to point out that the failure to abide 
and conform to the provisions of our Con-
stitution inevitably lead to tragic situations. 
In alerting the American people to the 
unconstitutionality of the war being waged 
in Vietnam, we are following the example 
followed by Abraham Lincoln who, in a 
speech made on January 12, 1848, before the 
House of Representatives opposing the war 
undertaken by President Polk, set out the 
reasons which impelled him to vote for a 
resolution which declared that "the war with 
Mexico was unnecessarily and unconstitu-
tionally commenced by the President." 
Our committee conducted its research be-
cause of a deep sense of responsibility as 
members of the bar and because of our dedi-
cation to the principle of world peace 
through law. It was the American lawyers 
who conceived and nurtured this principle, 
and after holding conferences on four con-
tinents (San Jose, Costa Rica; Tokyo, Japan; 
Lagos, Nigeria; Rome, Italy), finally con-
vened the First World Conference on World 
Peace Through Law at Athens, Greece, in 
July 1963.

In the proclamation of Athens, the decla-
ration of general principles for a world rule 
of law, among other things, declared that 
"all obligations under international law 
must be fulfilled and all rights thereunder 
must be exercised in good faith." 
Mr. President, we submit that our Govern-
ment's intervention in Vietnam falls far 
short of the declaration of principles at 
Athens, Greece, in July 1963, and is in viola-
tion of international agreements. The rule 
of law is the essential foundation of stability 
and order, both between societies and in 
international relations. When we violate the 
law ourselves, we cannot expect respect for 
the rule of law by others. Our present uni-
lateral intervention is an offense, we submit, 
against the spirit of American institutions. 
As lawyers, we feel that the national inter-
est is best served-indeed it can only be 
served-by (a) a commitment that our Gov-
ernment will be bound by and implement 
the principles of the Geneva accords of 1954, 
and that the main provisions thereof be the 
basis for the establishment of an independ-
ent, unified neutral Vietnam; (b) an invoca-
tion of the provisions of the United Nations 
Charter to assure peace in southeast Asia; 
and (c) a declaration that there will be no 
further bombing of Vietnam, that we will 
agree to a cease-fire, and publicly declare 
that the United States is willing to negotiate 
directly with the National Liberation Front-
a point endorsed by leading Senators and 
Secretary General Thant and mandated by 
article 33 of the United Nations Charter re-
quiring that the "parties to any dispute S * * 
shall first of all, seek a solution by negotia-
tion * * * or other peaceful means of their 
own choice," and that all elements of the 
South Vietnamese people should be repre-
sented in that country's postwar govern-
ment.

AMERICAN POLICY VIS-A-VIS VIETNAM 
The justification of American involvement* 
in Vietnam has troubled lawyers in the 
light of the literal language of our Consti-
tution and the United Nations Charter. 
Though the United States initially entered 
South Vietnam only to advise, American 
troops, now numbering 125,000,1 have moved

Scheer, "How the United States Got Involved 
in Vietnam" (A Report to the Center for the 
Study of Democratic Institutions, Post Office 
Box 4068, Santa Barbara, Calif., 93103) ; sam-
ple copy free. 
President Johnson, in his news confer-
ence of July 29, 1965, stated: 
"I have today ordered to Vietnam the Air 
Mobile Division and certain other forces 
which will raise our fighting strength from 
75,000 to 125,000 men almost immediately. 
Additional forces will be needed later, and 
they will be sent as requested." (Presiden-
tial Documents, vol. 1, No. I, p. 15, Aug. 2, 
1965.) 
from a passive to an active combat role. 
American forces have mounted repeated air 
strikes against targets in North Vietnam. Is 
such action, raising the threat of large-scale 
war, consonant with our Constitution, our 
obligations under the United Nations Char-
ter, the provisions of the southeast Asia col-
lective defense treaty? 
Observance of the rule of law is a basic 
tenet of American democracy. Hence it is 
fitting that American lawyers examine the 
action pursued by our Government to deter-
mine whether our Government's conduct is 
justified under the rule of law mandated by 
the United Nations Charter, a charter adopted 
to banish from the earth the scourge of war. 
We shall explore and assess the grounds 
advanced to justify the course of conduct 
pursued by our Government vis-a-vis Viet-
nam. In section I, we examine American 
policy in the light of the United Nations; in 
section II, in the light of the Geneva accords 
and the southeast Asia collective defense 
treaty; and in sections III-IV in the light of 
our Constitution. Mindful of the grave im-
portance of the issues, we have exercised the 
maximum diligence in the preparation of 
this memorandum which is fully docu-
mented. 
I-THE UNITED STATES IN VIETNAM: THE 
UNITED NATIONS CHARTER 
The Charter of the United Nations was 
signed on behalf of the United States on 
June 26, 1945, by the President of the United 
States, and was ratified on July 28, 1945, by 
the Senate., Thus, the United States became 
a signatory to the Charter, along with 55 
other nations (there are now 114), obligat-
ing itself to outlaw war, to refrain from the 
unilateral use of force against other nations, 
and to abide by the procedures embodied in 
the Charter for the settlement of differences 
between states. In essence, the obligations 
assumed by member nations under the 
United Nations Charter represent the princi-
ples of international law which govern the 
conduct of members of the United Nations 
and their legal relations. 
The Charter of the United Nations is a 
presently effective treaty binding upon the 
Government of the United States because it 
is the "supreme law of the land.", In-
deed, the Charter constitutes the cornerstone 
of a world system of nations which recognizes 
that peaceful relations, devoid any use of 
force or threats of force, are the fundamental 
legal relations between nations. The follow-
ing provisions of the Charter are relevant: 
(a) "All members shall refrain in their 
international relations from the threat or 
use of force against the territorial integrity 
or political independence of any state or in 
any other manner inconsistent with the pur-
poses of the United Nations" (ch. I, art. 
II(4) ) . 
2 See Historical Note under title 22, United 
States Code, sec. 287. By the act of Dec. 20, 
1945, c. 583, 59 Stat. 619 (22 U.S.C. 287-
287e) , Congress enacted "The United Nations 
Participation Act of 1945," empowering the 
President to appoint representatives to the 
United Nations and to render various forms 
of assistance to the United Nations and the 
Security Council under specified terms and 
conditions. 
a The treaties to which the United States is 
a signatory are a part of the fundamental 
law, binding upon all officials and all govern-
mental institutions. Art. I, sec. 2, clause 2, of 
the U.S. Constitution confers power upon the 
President to make treaties with the concur-
rence of two-thirds of the Senate. Art. VI, 
clause 2, of the U.S. Constitution provides 
that treaties so made, together With the 
Constitution and the laws of the United 
States made pursuant thereto, are "the 
Supreme Law of the Land." Missouri v. 
Holland, 252 U.S. 416, 432-434; Hines v 
Davidowitz, 312 'U.S. 52, 62-63; United States 
V. Pink, 316 U.S. 203, 230-231; Cleric v. Allen, 
331 U.S. 503-508. 
(b) "The Security Council shall determine 
the existence of any threat to the peace, 
breach of the peace, or act of aggression, and 
shall make recommendations or shall decide 
what measures shall be taken * * * to main-
tain or restore international peace and se-
curity." (Ch. VII, 39.) 
It is thus plain that signatory members of 
the United Nations Charter are barred from 
resorting to force unilaterally and that only 
the Security Council is authorized to deter-
mine the measures to be taken to maintain 
or restore international peace (apart from 
the question as to whether or not the Gen-
eral Assembly has any residual authority by 
virtue of the "Uniting for Peace" resolution 
for this purpose when the Security Council 
is unable to meet its responsibilities 4), 
It may be recalled that in 1956, Israel 
justified its attack on the Egyptian forces in 
the Sinai Peninsula "as security measures to 
eliminate the Egyptian Fedayeen 'Com-
mando' bases in the Sinai Peninsula from 
which raids had been launched across the 
Israeli frontier." Starke, "Introduction to 
International Law," fourth edition, London, 
1958, at page 83 et seq. 
When Great Britain and France introduced 
their troops into the Sinai Peninsula, under 
claim of a threat to their vital interests, the 
"preponderant reaction of the rest of the 
world was to condemn this action as inter 
alia, a breach of the United Nations Char-
ter." Starke, "Introduction to International 
Law," fourth edition, London, 1958, at pages 
85-88. 
When the Soviet Union suggested a joint 
military operation with the United States to 
restore the peace in the Middle East, Secre-
tary of State John Foster Dulles rejected this 
proposal as "unthinkable" (New York Times, 
November 6, 1956). Dulles declared: 
"Any intervention by the United States 
and/or Russia, or any other action, except by 
a duly constituted United Nations peace 
force would be counter to everything the 
General Assembly and the Secretary General 
of the United Nations were charged by the 
charter to do in order to secure a United 
Nations police cease-fire." 
At a news conference on November 8, 1956, 
President Eisenhower, answering an an-
nouncement of the Soviet Union at that 
time, declared that the United States would 
oppose the dispatch of Russian "volunteers" 
to aid Egypt, saying that it would be the duty 
of all United Nations members, including the 
United States, under the clear mandate of 
the United Nations Charter to counter any 
Soviet military intervention in the Middle 
East. The President said: 
"The United Nations is alone charged with 
the responsibility of securing the peace in 
the Middle East and throughout the world."

Tulane Studies in Political Science, volume 
IV entitled "International Law in the Middle 
East Crisis." 
To the fundamental, substantive and pro-
cedural requirements and conditions vesting 
sole authority in the United Nations to 
authorize utilization of force, there are only 
two exceptions set forth in the charter. The 
first exception is found in article 51 of chap-
ter 7: 
"Nothing in the present charter shall im-
pair the inherent right of individual or col-
lective self-defense if an armed attack oc-
curs against a member of the United Nations, 
until the Security Council has taken meas-
ures -to maintain international peace and 
security." 
Article 51 of the charter marked a serious 
restriction on the traditional right of self-
defense. As was stated by Prof. Philip C. 
Jessup in his work, "A Modern Law of Na-
tions," published in 1947 (at pp. 165-166) : 
4 The constitutional validity of the "Unit-
ing for Peace" resolution adopted in 1950, is 
disputed.

'Article 51 of the charter suggests a fur-
ther limitation on the right of self-defense: 
it may be exercised only 'if an armed at-
tack occurs.' * * * This restriction in article 
al very definitely narrows the freedom of 
as ion which states had under traditional 
Law. A cane could be made out for self-
defense under the traditional law where the 
injury was threatened but no attack had 
yet taken place. Under the charter, alarming 
military preparations by a neighboring state 
wonld -justify a resort to the Security Coun-
cil, but would not justify resort to anticipa-
tory force by the state which believed itself 
three tened." 
'lie traditional right of self-defense, even 
prior to the adoption of the United Nations 
charter, was limited. As stated by Secretary 
of Sitate Daniel Webster in the Caroline 
ease," and as adopted In the Neurenberg 
:lodgment in 1045, any resort to armed force 
in self-defense must, be confined to cases in 
which "I:he necessity of that self-defense 
is instant, oyerwehlming and leaving no 
choice of means and no moment of delibera-
iion." 
Li expressly ill-tilting independent military 
action to instances of armed attack, the 
founding nations explicitly and implicitly 
rejected the right to the use of force based 
on the familiar claim of "anticipatory self-
defense." or "intervention by subversion," or 
iiprif-enaptive armed attack to forestall 
threatened aggression," and similar rationale.

cords of 1954, South Vietnam is merely a 
temporary zone not even qualifying politi-
cally as a state (See Section II infra), even 
if it be assumed that an "armed attack," 
within the meaning of article 51, has oc-
curred against South Vietnam. For, as has 
been shown, article 51 is operative only in 
the event. of "an armed attack against a 
member of the United Nations." Hence, 
neither the right of individual self-defense 
nor the. right of collective h self-defense can 
become operative. 
It has been claimed that United States in-
terventimi in Vietnam is sanctioned under 
article 5 on the ground (1) that South 
Vietnam in an independent state. (2) that 
South Vietnam had been the victim of an 
armed attack from North Vietnam and (3) 
that the United States, with the consent of 
South Vietnam, was engaging in "colletcive 
self-defense" of that country, as islaimed by 
the United States in a communication to the 
United Nations Security Council in March 
1905 (U.S. Chronicle, vol. 2, p. 22). To sus-
tain this claim, all three elemenis must be 
satisfied. 
This CB ins As untenable, however, on sev-
eral grounds. First, South Vietnam was not 
recognized as an independent state at the 
1951 Geneva Conference (see sec. II, 
infra). Even if it had become 1 de facto 
state in the course of events since 1951, the 
infiltration from North Vietnam cannot be 
deemed to constitute .en "armed attack" 
within the purview of article 51. 
Since the Geneva Accords recognized all 
oi Vietnam as a single state, the conflict 
whether of the Vietcong or Ho Chi Minh 
against South Vietnam is "civil strife', and 
foreign intervention is forbidden, because 
civil strife is a domestic question--a posi-
tion insisted upon by the United States in 
its civil war of 1861. Ho Chi Minh can com-
pare his position in demanding union of 
Vietnam viith that of Lincoln., when Britain 
and Franc were threatening to intervene 
to assure the independence of the Confeder-
acy (and with the added point that the 
national elections mandated for 1056 in the 
Geneva Accords were frustrated by South 
Vietnam with apparent support of the United 
States; see sec. II, infra). Nor should it 
be overlooked that Lincoln had very little 
support from the people of the S. into, who 
generally supported the Confederitcy, while 
Ho Chi Minh has a great deal of support 
from the people in South Vietnam organized 
in the National Liberation Front whose mili-
tary arm is the Vie :Leong. There is, there-
fore, a basic issue whether the hostilities in 
Vietnam constitute external aggression (by 
North Vietnam) or "civil strife." Here it 
should be noted that the United Nations is 
authorized to intervene where civil strife 
threatens international peace, as the United 
Nations did in the Congo, in accord with 
article 39 of the charter?but individual 
states are not permitted to inter', cue 
The third element .retraisite for the invoca-
tion of the right of collective self-defense 
under Art ale 51 presupposes that: the na-
tions invoking such right are properly mem-
bers of a regional collective system within 
the mirview of the United Nations Charter. 
The point: here involved is: Can the United 
States validly be a genuine member of a re-
gional systsm covering southeast Asia. Arti-
cle 51 and Article 53, dealing with regional 
systems, were interrelated amendatory pro-
visions intended primarily to integrate the 
inter-American system with the United Na-
tions organization (see fn. 8, 13, 15). The 
concept that the United States?a country 
separated by oceans and thousands of miles 
from southeast Asia and bereft of any his-
torical or ethnic connection with the peoples 
of southeast Asia?could validly be con-
sidered a member of a regional system im-
planted in southeast; Asia, is utterly alien 
to the regional systems envisaged in the 
charter. The "Southeast Asia Collective 
Defense Treaty' ?connecting the United 
States with southeast Asia, architectured by 
Secretary of State Dulles, is a legalistic ar-
tificial formulation to circumvent the funda-
mental limitations placed by the United 
Nations Charter on unilateral actions by 
individual members. However ingenuous 
ordisingenuous?the Dulles approach, 
SEATO is a caricature of the genuine 
regional systems envisaged by the U.N. Char-
ter. A buffalo cannot be transformed into 
a giraffe however elongated its neck may be 
stretched. The Dulles approach to collec-
tive defense treaties employed legal artifice 
to circumvent the exclusive authority vested 
in the United Nations to deal with breaches 
in the peace. Articles 51 and 53 were in-
tended to make a bona fide integration of 
regional systems of cooperation with the 
world system of international security--but 
these envisaged regional systems Which his-
torically and geographically developed into 
a regional community?not contemplating a 
regional system which fused a region like 
southeast Asia with a country on the North 
American Continent. SEATO is not a re-
gional agency within the letter or spirit, of 
the U.N. Charter as to authorize the United 
States to claim the right of collective self-
defense even if there had been tin armed 
attack on a member of the United Nations 
geographically located in southeast Asia. If 
artifices like SEATO were sanctioned, the 
path would be open for the emasculation of 
the United Nations organization and the 
world system of international security as-
siduously developed to prevent the scourge 
of war. 
Hence article 51 cannot be properly in-
voked for (1) South Vietnam does not have 
the political status of a state; (21 even if 
South Vietnam were deemed a de facto state, 
the infiltrations do not constitute an "armed 
attack" within the purvie,w of article 51; and 
(3) the United States cannot claim the right 
of "collective self-defense" in respect of a 
regional system involving southeast Asia. 
Apart from ,article 51 (inapplicable to the 
situation here), the only other exception to 
the renunciation of the "threat or use of 
force" by member states is found in chapter 
VIII of the charter dealing with regional 
arrangements. Article 53 of -said chapter 
contains two paragraphs of particular sig-
nificance: 
(a) "The Security Council shalt, where 
appropriate, utilize such regional iirrange-
ments or agencies for enforcement action 
under its authority. But no enforcement 
action shall be taken under regional arrange-
ments or by regional agencies without the 
authofization of the Security Council, with 
the exception of measures against an enemy 
state, as defined in paragraph 2 of this 
article." (Ch. VII, art. 55(1).) 
Paragraph two of that article psosides: 
(b) "The term enemy state as used in 
paragraph 1 of this article applies to any 
state which during the Second World War 
has been an enemy of any signatory of the 
present charter." 
With respect to regional arrangementa 
therefore, it is clear that no enforcement 
action may be undertaken without the au-
thorization of tlie Security Ciiiinen of the 
United Nations, save and except in iinly one 
instance; against any state which. during 
World War II, was an enemy of :111V of the 
charter," to wit, Germany, Italy and ./ap,an. 
The reason for this exception appeti rt; 
clear. When the charter was signed in San 
Francisco on June 26, 1945, peace treaties 
had not yet been finally signed by the allied 
nations with each of the enemy states. Rep-
arations, sanctions, territorial changes, bed 
not then been finalized. And so, in order to 
permit necessary flexibility in these respects, 
this sharply limited exception, permit ting ac-
tion against an enemy state in World War II 
by an allied government, was spelled out.

Since Vietnam was manifestly not an "enemy 
state" within the purview of article 53(b), 
enforcement action under SEATO is unau-
thorized and cannot be justified in view of 
the express restrictions set out under article 
53(a) of the United Nations Charter. 
In summary, the United Nations Charter 
obligates all of its signatory members to re-
frain from the threat or use of force, and 
only the Security Council (apart from the 
residual authority (see footnote 4) granted 
the General Assembly under the "uniting for 
peace" resolution) is authorized to deter-
mine the existence of any threat to the peace, 
breach of the peace or act of aggression and 
'o determine the measures to be taken to 
.naintain or restore international peace. To 
these salient provisions, there are only two 
exceptions: the first, the right to self-de-
fense if an armed attack occurs against a 
member of the United Nations; and, the 
second, the right of nations to enter into 
appropriate "regional arrangements," sub-
ject, however, to the provision that no en-
forcement action shall be taken under such 
arrangements without the authorization of 
the Security Council, the only exception to 
the latter requirement being with respect to 
measures against an enemy state, as defined 
in the charter. 
We have shown that none of the afore-
stated exceptions can be invoked by the 
U.S. Government with respect to its conduct 
in Vietnam. It follows therefore that the 
fundamental requirements of ?the United 
Nations Charter with respect to the renun-
ciation of force and the threat of force are 
directly applicable to the actions of the 
United States. 
One other noteworthy charter provision is 
article 103 which subordinates all regional 
and treaty compacts to the United Nations 
Charter. 
"In the event of a conflict between the 
obligations of the members of the United 
Nations under the present charter and their 
obligations under any other international 
agreement, their obligations under the pres-
ent charter shall prevail." (Ch. XVI, art. 
103.) 
This supremacy clause was drafted to meet 
the predictable reassertion of dominance by 
the great powers within their respective 
geographic zones or hemispheres. Because 
of the unhappy history of a world frag-
mented by such "spheres of influence," the 
supremacy clause and the restrictions on 
the use of force under regional agreements 
emerge as limitations upon the superpowers 
even within their awn geographic zones. It 
is significant that the United States not 
only accepted these limitations, but actively 
supported their incorporation within the 
charter.13

Foreign Relations, "U.S. Senate, 79th Cong. 
1st sees., supra, n. 6, at p. 306. 
On May 15, 1945, Secretary of State Stet-
tinius issued a statement at the San Fran-
cisco Conference regarding the Act of Cha-
pultpec vis-a-vis the United Nations Or-
ganization which declared (so far as here 
pertinent), hearings on U.N. Charter, op. 
cit., p. 306; 
"As a result of discussions with a number 
of interested delegations, proposals will be 
made to clarify in the charter the relation-
ship of regional agencies and collective ar-
rangements to the world organization. 
"These proposals will?
"1. Recognize the paramount authority of 
the world organization in all enforcement 
action. 
"2. Recognize that the inherent right of 
self-defense, either individual or collective, 
remains unimpaired in case the Security 
Council does not maintain international 
peace and security and an armed attack 
against a member state occurs. Any meas-
ures of self-defense shall immediately be 
Article 103 makes clear that the obligations 
of the United Nations Charter prevail vie-a-
vis the obligations of the SEATO treaty. 
Indeed, article VI of the SEATO expressly 
recognizes the supremacy of the United Na-
tions Charter (see sec. II infra). Moreover 
the frequent citation by President Johnson 
of the pledges given by Presidents Eisen-
hower, Kennedy, and himself to aid South 
Vietnam afford no justification for U.S. inter-
vention in Vietnam.14 In the first place, 
these pledges or commitments do not even 
have the status of treaties, for these Presi-
dential pledges have not been ratified by the 
Senate. And even if these Presidential 
pledges had been solemnly ratified by the 
Senate, any obligations thereunder must yield 
to the obligations imposed under the United 
Nations Charter by virtue of the supremacy 
clause embodied in article 103. Nor would 
the illegality of U.S. intervention in Vietnam 
be altered by the circumstance that the 
Saigon regime may have invited the United 
States to assume its role in the Vietnam con-
flict. The supremacy clause of the charter 
reported to the Security Council and shall 
in no way affect the authority and responsi-
bility of the Council under the Charter to 
take at any time such action as it may deem 
necessary to maintain or restore interna-
tional peace and security. 
"3. Make more clear that regional agencies 
will be looked to as an important way of 
settling local disputes by peaceful means." 
The first point is already dealt with by 
the provision of the Dumbarton Oaks pro-
posals (ch. VIII, sec. C, par. 2) which pro-
vides that no enforcement action will be 
taken by regional agencies without the au-
thorization of the Security Council. It is 
not proposed to change this language. 
The second point will be dealt with by an 
addition to chapter VIII of a new section 
substantially as follows: 
"Nothing in this chapter impairs the in-
herent right of self-defense, either individ-
ual or collective, in the event that the Secu-
rity Council does not maintain international 
peace and security and an armed attack 
against a member state occurs. Measures 
taken in the exercise of this right shall be 
immediately reported to the Security Council 
and shall not in any way affect the authority 
and responsibility of the Security Council 
under this charter to take at any time such 
action as it may deem necessary in order to 
maintain or restore international peace and 
security." 
The third point would be dealt with by 
inclusion of a specific reference to regional 
agencies or arrangements in chapter VIII, 
sec. A, par. 3, describing the methods where-
by parties to a dispute should, first of all, 
seek a peaceful solution by means of their 
own choice. 
The U.S. delegation believes that pro-
posals as above outlined if adopted by the 
Conference would, with the other relevant 
provisions of the projected charter, make 
possible a useful and effective integration of 
regional systems of cooperation with the 
world system of international security. 
This applies with particular significance 
to the long-established inter-American sys-
tem. 
" President Johnson, in his news confer-
ence of July 28, 1965, declared: 
"Moreover, we are in Vietnam to fulfill one 
of the most solemn pledges of the American 
Nation. Three Presidents?President Eisen-
hower, President Kennedy, and your present 
President?over 11 years have committed 
themselves and have promised to help de-
fend this small and valiant nation" (Presi-
dential Documents, vol. 1, No. 1, p. 15). 
President Eisenhower has stated that his 
administration had made no commitment to 
South Vietnam "in terms of military support 
on programs whatsoever" (the New York 
Times, Aug. 18, 1965, p. 1). 
manifestly prevails and cannot be annulled 
by mutual agreement of third parties. 
It is by virtue of the supremacy clause 
that the Secretary General of the United 
Nations has called the world's attention to 
the emasculation of the authority of the 
United Nations resulting from actions taken 
by regional agencies without reference to the 
Security Council. 
We believe that any fair study of the 
United Nations Charter will affirm the obser-
vations of Prof. Lewis Henkin, of Columbia 
University, when he speaks "of the law of the 
charter": 
"So far as it purports to prescribe for the 
conduct of nations, it consists, basically, of 
one principle: Except in self-defense against 
armed attack, members must refrain from 
the threat or use of force against other states 
* * * the rule of the charter against unilat-
eral force in international relations is the 
essence of any meaningful concept of law be-
tween nations and the foundation on which 
rests all other attempts to regulate interna-
tional behavior. It is a rule which all nations 
have accepted and which all have a common 
interest essential to law." 15 
It appears difficult to escape the conclusion 
therefore, in the light of the aforesaid, that 
the action of the U.S. Government in Vietnam 
contravenes essential provisions of the 
United Nations Charter. The U.S. Govern-
ment has decided for itself to use armed 
forces in South Vietnam and to bomb North 
Vietnam without authorization of the Secu-
rity Council or the General Assembly of the 
United Nations. The failure of the United 
States to honor its obligations under the 
United Nations Charter is a regrettable but 
inescapable conclusion which we as lawyers 
have been compelled to reach. We, as law-
yers, urge our President to accept the obliga-
tions for international behavior placed upon 
us by our signature of the United Nations 
Charter. 
II?THE UNITED STATES IN VIETNAM: THE 1954 
GENEVA ACCORDS AND THE SEATO TREATY 
Officials of the U.S. Government have nev-
ertheless asserted, on different occasions, that 
the actions of the United States in Vietnam 
are consistent with the U.S. duties and obli-
gations under the United Nations Charter 
and sanctioned by the treaty creating the 
Southeast Asia Treaty Organization 
(SEATO) .10 The conduct of the U.S. Govern-
ment has been justified as support of a legiti-
mate government defending itself against in-
surrection from within and aggression from 
without. We have demonstrated above that 
even if this latter position were accepted on 
its face, unilateral conclusions and actions 
taken by the Government of the United 
States upon the basis of such conclusions are 
violative of the firm obligations under the

United Nations; Charter. However, we do not 
let the matter rest with this assertion, but 
proceed to an examination of the validity of 
the claims made by the U.S. Government in 
support of its conduct in Vietnam. 
The Geneva, agreement, under which the 
war between Vietnam and the French was 
terminated, effected the division of Vietnam 
into north and south, at the 17th parallel. 
The said "agreement on the cessation of hos-
tilities in Vietnam," entered into in Geneva 
oci July 20, 1954, provided that, the division 
of Vietnam at, the 1.71h parallel was only "a 
cirovisional military demarcation line," on 
ei ;hr side of which the opposing forces 
imuld be "reprouped"?"the forces of the 
C'copies Army of Vietnam to the north of the 
lane ;And the forces of the French Union to the 
eolith" (ch. I. art. 
'the Geneva agreement makes plain that 
nn or the 17th parallel was to be 
temporary and a step in the preparation for

acme 1was to1 he in the hands of the party 
whocie forces are to be regrouped there" 
lart 1.4(a) I. 
The day after the aforesaid cease-fire 
agreement was entered, into, representatives 
ot Cambodia, the Democratic Republic of 
Vietnam (Vtetminh), Laos, France, the Peo-
ples Republic of China, the U.S.S.R., and the 
United Kingalinn affirmed The Final Declara-
tion of the Geneva Conference on the Prob-
lems of :Restoring Peace in Indochina, July 
21, 1954.)g The declaration emphasized that 
the north-south division MIRA solely a means 
or ending the military conflict and not the 
creation of any oohitical or territorial bound-
ary. Article 9 or the declaration stated: 
"Tie Conference recognizes that the es-
sential purpose of the agreement relating to 
Vicitnam is to settle military questions with 
a view to ending hostilities and that the 
military demarcation line is provisional and 
shall not in coy way be interpreted as con-
eti tuting a political or territorial boundary." 
This reinstitutes a recognition of the 
fact that Vietnam is a single nation, 
Maided into two zones only temporarily for 
administrative purposes pending an election. 
This being so, the action of the North Viet-
cennese in aiding the South Vietnamese, to 
the extent that it has taken place, neither

not. The latter by the Geneva Agreement 
was to participate in an election ant to de-
terinine vinether North and Soutli Vietnam

was the refusal on the part. of the Diem 
regime and the subtieqiernt "gown tunents" 
of the re inth, supported by tic e United 
States, to participate in such eleciiiions that 
opened the door to the present cot diet. 
It wes veto stated in the declaretion that 
the clear objective of settling political prob-
lems and anifying the tuition was to be by 
means of free general elections. Article 7 
of the declaration provided: 
"The Conference declares that io far as 
Vietnam ,,s concerned, the settlement of 
political problems effected on the basis of 
respect for the principles of independence, 
unity and territorial integrity, shell permit 
the Vietnamese people to enjoy the funda-
mental freedoms, guaranteed by democratic 
institutions established ae, a reset; of free 
general elections by secret ballot. In order 
to insure that sufficient progres.) in the 
restoration of peace has been nade, and 
that all the necessary conditions indain for 
free expression of the national will. national 
elections snail be held in July under 
the supervision of an Internatiohal Com-
mission." 
The reference to "national elections" re-
inforces the evidence of the historic :id status 
of Vietnam as a single nation. To present 
the picture, as the United States repeatedly 
has done, as though North Vietnam were 
an interloper having no organic relationship 
to South Vietnam is to ignore both the ap-
plicable leg ed principles .and treaties and the 
facts of his iory. 
Although the United States par' icipated 
in the discussion leading up to the Geneva 
accords, it end not sign the final det ioration. 
Instead, the U.S. Government, thr ;ugh its 
Under Secretary of State, Waltee Bedell 
Smith, made its own unilateral declara-
tion" on July 21, 1954. In this deelaration, 
the United Slates took note of the Geneva 
agreements and declared that the United 
States would "refrain from threat or the use 
of force te disturb them, in accordance 
with article 2(4) of the Charter of the 
United Nations dealing with the ()litigation 
of members to refrain in their international 
relation.s from the threat or use of firree." 
Referring to free elections in Viett am, the 
United States declaration stated: 
"In the case of nations now divided 
against their will, we shall continue to seek 
to achieve :nifty through elections' super-
vised by the United Nations to insicre that 
they are conducted fairly." "i 
Note tint article 7 s;dpulates tnat the 
elections we to be antecedent to and a 
neceasary ccadition for the "fundamental 
freedoms. guaranteed by democratic institu-
tions" and that the electione were to be held 
"in order to insure . that all thi . neces-
sary conditions obtain for free expression 
of -the natio :cal will." This particular por-
tion of the Geneva Accord has frequently 
been quoted out of context, with Hie key 
phrases in reverse order, in order to justify 
the refusal to hold elections on the ;irounds 
that the neccissary conditions did no!, exist. 
"See "Extracts From Verbatim. Heat irds of 
Eighth Plena.sy Session,- Geneva Accords. 
',Nowhere in its own declaration did the 
United States recognize the political parti-
tion of Vietnam; insofar as it referred to the 
country, it designated it as "Vietnam." not 
"South Vietnitm" and "North Vietnam" 
Thus the United States recognized Lila 
fact that Vietnam was a single nation. 
Nevertheless the justification of United 
States policy today ignores this admitted 
fact. The United States persists in de denial 
that it is intervening in a civil war. It seek.; 
to justify the bombing of North 'Vietnam 
by the United States on the basis that North 
Vietnam is a foreign aggressor iu South 
Vietn am. 
Nor is this all. The United States further 
pledged "that it will not join in any ar-
rangement which will hinder" the reunifica-
tion of Vietnam, and concluded with the 
hope that: 
"The agreement will permit Cambodia, 
Laos, and Vietnam to play their part, in Dill 
independence and sovereignty in the peaceful 
community of nations, and will cm' ible the 
people: of the area to determine their own 
fature." 
No election was ever held pursuant to the 
Cleneva Accords, although both tile Interna-
tional Control Commission (composed of 
India, Poland, and Canada) and the United 
Nations announced readiness to Supervise 
such elections. South Vietnam announced 
that it did not regard itself obliged to take 
part in the elections because the participa-
tion of North Vietnam would rencier sucti. 
elections not free, a position apparently sup-
ported by the State Department.*c' In 1955, 
following the Geneva Accords, then Prime 
Minister of State Diem repudiated thr Geneva 
Agreements and refused to held the elections. 
Former President Dwight D. Eisenhower, in 
his Memoirs, suggests a further reason for 
Diem's refusal to hold elections pursuant 
to the Geneva Accords: 
"I have never talked or corresponded with 
a person knowledgeable in Lido Chiciese af-
fairs who did not agree that had elections 
been held at the time of the fighting possibly 
80 percent of the population weatld have 
voted for the Communist Ho Chi Minh at; 
their leader rather than. Chief of State Bao 
DM." 
The consequences of the repudiation of 
the Geneva Accords were delineated by Sen-
ator ERNEST GRUENING in a speech to the 
Senate on April 9, 1965: 
"That civil war began?let me repeat, be-
cause this is crucial to the issue?wlien tint

Geneva agreement. The civil war began and 
has continued with intensified fury ever 
since * *. For over 800 years, before the 
conquest by France, Vietnam was a united 
country. After defeating the French in 
1954, the Vietnamese went to the conference 
table at Geneva, agreeing to a settlement 
only on condition that reunification elections 
be held. Yet, nowhere in President John-
son's speech of April 7, 1965, at Johns Hop-
kins University is there held out a hope of 
ultimate reunification of Vietnam. He con-
ditioned the ultimate peace 'upon an inde-
pendent South Vietnam instead'." 
In view of all of the aforesaid, the assump-
tions and justifications for our governmental 
policy in Vietnam do not appear to have sup-
port, either in law or in fact. The conduct 
of the U.S. Government in Vietnam appears 
plainly to violate the terms of the Geneva 
Accords and to repudiate solemn pledges to 
"refrain from the threat or the use of force" 
to disturb the Geneva Accords. 
Moreover, nothing in the provisions of the 
southeast Asian Collective Defense Treaty 
would appear to justify the conduct of the 
U.S. Government in Vietnam. The SEATO 
Treaty was signed in Manila some 7 weeks 
after the signing of the Geneva Agreement 
on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam. 
The SEATO Treaty became effective,in Feb-
ruary 1955, following the treaty ratification 
by eight member states-the United States, 
France, Great Britain, Australia, New Zea-
land, Thailand, Pakistan, and the Philippine 
Islands. 
By the preamble and by article I of the 
SEATO Treaty, the parties acceded to the 
principles and supremacy of the United Na-
tions Charter in accordance with article 103 
thereof, which it will be recalled, provides as 
follows: 
"In the event of a conflict between the 
obligations of the members of the United 
Nations under the present charter arid their 
obli6ations under any other international 
agreement, their obligations under the pres-
ent charter shall prevail." 
The supremacy of this provision was ex-
pressly reiterated by the eight SEATO na-
tions under article VI of said treaty, in 
which each solemnly agreed that the SEATO 
Treaty: 
"" * * does not affect the rights and ob-
ligations of any of the parties under the 
Charter of the United Nations, or the re-
sponsibility of the United Nations for the 
maintenance of international peace and se-
curity." 
The key provisions of the SEATO Treaty 
are to be found in article IV. Paragraph 1 
thereof permits the use of force by one or 
more member states only in the event of 
"aggression by means of armed attack." But 
where the integrity or inviolability of any 
territory covered by the treaty is threat-
ened "by other than armed attack" or "by 
any fact or situation which might endanger 
the peace of the area," then, paragraph 2 of 
article IV requires, as a prerequisite to inter-
vention, that "the parties shall consult im-
mediately in order to agree on the measures 
to be taken. * * 
The consent of all eight SEATO nations 
was originally required before any military 
action under article IV could be undertaken 
by any of them (New York Times, May 28, 
1962). Later, this rule was modified so that 
action could be undertaken if there was no 
dissenting vote-i.e., an abstention would not 
count as a veto (New York Times, April 19, 
1964). At the last two annual meetings of 
the Ministerial Council of SEATO, France 
has refused to support a communique pledg-
ing SEATO backing for South Vietnam 
against the Vietcong (New York Times, April 
15-16, 1964; May 3-6, 1965; see also, Los 
Angeles Times, May 3-4, 1965). It would 
appear that with the threat of a French 
veto a formal SEATO commitment in Viet-
nam has not been sought by the United 
States. However, even if there had been 
unanimity among the SEATO nations, the 
provisions of article 53 of chapter VIII of the 
United Nations Charter will still prevail: 
"But no enforcement action shall be taken 
under regional arrangements or by regional 
agencies without the authorization of the 
Security Council. * * 
Manifestly, no such authorization has ever 
been conferred, either by the Security Coun-
cil of the United Nations or by the General 
Assembly, from which it follows that Ameri-
can action in Vietnam clearly cannot be sup-
ported by reference to SEATO. 
So long as the United States remains a 
member of the United Nations, our right to 
intervene is circumscribed by the provisions 
of the United Nations Charter. As members 
of SEATO, our right to intervene is limited, 
both by the requirement for unanimity 
among all of the eight treaty nations and, 
In addition, by the superseding requirement 
of article 53 of chapter VIII of the United 
Nations Charter, prohibiting any enforce-
ment action under a regional arrangement 
without the authority of the Security Coun-
cil. Our justification for acting contrary to 
our solemn obligations under the United 
Nations Charter appears tenuous and in-
substantial, The fact of the matter is that 
the U.S. Government has simply acted as its 
own judge of its own interests in patent dis-
regard of the fundamental law embodied in 
the United Nations Charter. 
III-CONSTITUTIONAL ASPECTS OF UNITED 
STATES INTERVENTION IN VIETNAM 
This disregard of the rules of the charter, 
inherent in U.S. intervention in Vietnam, 
is compounded by the fact that such inter-
vention is also violative of our own Consti-
tution. Whatever doubts may have existed 
prior to the President's "Report to the Nation 
Following a Review of U.S. Policy in Viet-
nam" 2' (set out at his news conference on 
July 28, 1965) , as to whether U.S. action in 
Vietnam constituted the conduct of a war, 
the President in that report made it ex-
plicitly clear that "this IS really war," noting 
that "our fighting strength" was being raised 
from 75,000 to 125,000 "almost immediately" 
and that "additional forces will be needed 
later, and they will be sent as requested." 
Can the President's conduct be squared with 
our Constitution (apart from the obligations 
imposed upon member states by the United 
Nations Charter)? 
It is the genius of our constitutional sys-
tem that ours is a government of checks and 
balances. A dangerous concentration of pow-
er is avoided by the separation-in Articles 
I, II, and III of the Constitution-of the leg-
islative, executive, and judicial powers. The 
doctrine of "separation of powers" is funda-
mental to, and is one of the "great structural 
principles of the American constitutional 
system." 25 The Supreme Court has recently 
characterized this "separation of powers" as 
"a bulwark against tyranny," United States 
v. Brown- U.S.-, 33 Law Week 4603 (June 
7, 1965). The Supreme Court had earlier 
said: 
"The power to make the necessary laws is 
in Congress; the power to execute in the Pres-
ident. Both powers imply many subordi-
nate powers. Each includes all authority 
essential to its due exercise. But neither can 
the President, in war more than in peace, 
intrude upon the proper authority of Con-
gress, nor Congress upon the proper author-

Wall 2, 139 (1866) 
Classically stated by Blackstone 26 and de-
rived from Plato, Aristotle, Polybius, Cicero, 
Machiavelli, Harrington, Locke, and Montes-
quieu," this constitutional separation of 
powers was deliberately carried over by the 
Framers into the conduct of foreign affairs, 
For, contrary to widely held assumptions, the 
power to make and conduct foreign policy 
is not vested exclusively in the President, but 
is divided between him and Congress, with 
each endowed with complementary, but sepa-
rate 28 powers and responsibilities." 
Thus, in making and carrying out general 
foreign policy, Article II, Section 2 requires 
the President to have the "Advice and Con-
sent of the Senate, to make Treaties, pro-
vided two-thirds of the Senators present con-
cur." And the President also requires the 
advice and consent of the Senate to "appoint 
Ambassadors, other public Ministers and 
Consuls." 
When statecraft fails and the question be-
comes the ultimate one of war or peace, the 
Constitution imposes a tight rein upon the 
President. His participation ends at the 
threshold of the decision whether or not to 
declare war. Under Article I, Section 8, 
Clause 11, that power is confided exclusively 
to the Congress.") There is no mention of 
the President in connection with the power 
to "declare war." Under the Constitution, 
Congress alone must make this decision. 
The Clause does not read "on recommenda-
tion of the President," nor that the "Pres-
ident with advice and consent of Congress 
may declare war." As former Assistant Sec-
retary of State James Grafton Rogers has 
observed: "The omission is significant. 
There was to be no war unless Congress took 
the initiative." Rogers, "World Policing 
and The Constitution," p. 21 (Boston, 1945) . 
"Nothing in our Constitution is plainer 
than that declaration of war is entrusted 
only to Congress." Youngstown Sheet and 
Tube Company v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 642 
(1952) (Jackson, J.). 
That the President lacks constitutional 
power to make war is underscored by the 
historic statement made by President Wood-
row Wilson on the night of April 2, 1917, 
when he addressed the Congress in a joint 
session: 
"I have called the Congress into extraor-
dinary session because there are serious,

of England," 146 (7th ed. 1775).

trine of "Separation of Powers," 2 U. of Chi. 
L. Rev. 385 (1935). 
28 "One of the most striking facts in the 
institutional philosophic history of the 
United States (is) that the legislative-execu-
tive quarrels during the colonial period con-
vinced the colonists of the desirability of a 
separation of powers rather than a union 
of powers." Wright "Con,senstis and Con-
tinuity," p. 17 (Boston, 1958). 
"The doctrine of separated powers is im-
plemented by a number of constitutional 
previsions, some of which entrust certain 
jobs exclusively to certain branches, while 
others say that a given task is not to be 
performed by a given branch." United 
States v. Brown, supra-U.S., 33 Law Week,

eery serious choices of poliey to be made, 
ancl made immediately, which it was neither 
right nor constitutionally permissible that 
I should assume the responsibility of mak-
ing." St-
President Franklin Roosevelt also heeded 
his constitutional responsibilities and was 
:ilso mindful and sensitive of the consti-
tutional limitations applicable to the Presi-
dent when, before a joint session of the Con-
gress on December 7, 1941, he requested the 
Congress for a declaration of war following 
'Pearl Harbor. 
The decision to place the responsibility for 
declaring war exclusively in Congress as the 
direct representative of the people, and not 
even to provide for the President's partici-
pation in that decision was a most deliber-
ate one by the Framers. 
'1' mc Constitutional Convention had been 
urged to rest the power to declare war, the 
"last resort of sovereigns, ultima ratio 
regum," in the executive, or, alternatively. in 
the Senate. :3 Story, "Commentaries on the 
Constitution." par. 1166. The arguments 
were made that "large bodies necessarily 
move slowly" and "despatch, secrecy, and 
vigor are often indispensable, and always 
usel ul toward success." Story, ibid. 
When the issue was debated at the Con-
vention, Mr. Gerry stated that he "never ex-
pected to hear in a republic a motion to em-
power the Executive alone to declare war." 
Madison and Gerry "moved to insert 'declare,' 
striking out 'make' war; leaving to the Ex-
ecutive the power to repel sudden attacks." 
The motion carried. Farrand ed., "Records 
of the Federal Convention" (New Haven, 
I).lii  IL pp. 318-319.. 
Nowhere in the debates is there support 
for he view that the President can wage a 
war or "commit" our Nation to the waging 
of a war. On the contrary, warm.aking was 
Lu be a purely legislation prerogative. The 
wily use of force without a declaration of 
,fl President', Wilson went on to say: 
"With a profound sense of the solemn and 
even tragical character of the step I am tak-
ing and of the grave responsibilities which 
it involves, but in unhesitating obedience to 
what I deem my constitutional duty. I ad-
vise that the Congress declare the recent 
course of the imperial German Government 
to be in fact nothing less than war against 
1lie Government and people of the United 
:States; that it formally accept the status of 
belligerent which has thus been, thrust upon 
and that it take immediate steps not only 
to put the country in a more thorough state 
of defense but also to exert all its power and 
employ all its resources to bring the Gov-
ernment of toe German Empire to terms and 
end the war." 
.t The Flamers concluded and provided 
osat "the power of declaring war is not only 
the highest sovereign prerogative; but that 
IL is in its own nature and effects so critical 
and calamitous, that it requires the utmost 
deliberation, and the successive review of all 
the councils of the nation. War, in its best 
,tstfate, never fails to impose upon the people 
the most burdensome taxes, and. personal 
,t.tilerings. It is always injurious and some-
time of the great commercial, 
t,1;,,ntifacturing. and agricultural interests.. 
Nay, it always involves the prosperity, and. 
not infrequent:iv the existence of a nation., 
Ti, is :sometimes fatal to public liberty itself.. 
by introducing a spirit of military glory, 
which is ready to follow, wherever a succes-
eive commander will lead; and in a republic 
whose institutions are essentially founded 
on the basis of peace, there is infinite danger 
that war will find it both imbecile in de-
and eager for contest. Indeed, the his-
tory of republics has but too fatally proved, 
that they are too ambitious of military fame 
1,isti conquest, and too easily devoted to the 
war that was contemplated as the debates 
clearly show, was "to repel sudden ottacks." " 
These constitutional provisions that only 
Congress shall have the power to declare war 
and that Congress has the sole responsibility 
to raise and support the armies, to provide 
for a navy, and to impose the taxes to provide 
the funds to carry on a war, reflected a pro-
found distrust of executive autlacelty and a 
corresponding reliance upon the tegislature 
as the instrument for the decisionmaking in 
this vital area. Bemis,. "The Diplomacy of 
the American Revolution" (New Yak, 1935), 
These provisions reflected thing:- painfully 
learned during the early colonitl period, 
when every major European vier had its 
counterpart on the American fron.ers. The 
Colonies were therefore determined to end 
the imperial authority to decide for them 
what wars they should enter and what the 
outcome of those wars should be. Savelle, 
"The American Balance of Power, and the 
European Diplomacy 171:3-78," in Morris ed., 
"The Era of the American Revolution" (New 
York, 1939), pp. 140-169. 
The Convention was not only (determined 
to deny warmaking power to the President, 
but was also unwilllng to entrust it to the 
Senate alone. To assure the fullest consid-
eration, the Framers therefore proeided that 
the House of Representatives, larger and 
more representative than the Senate, should 
also be brought in to decide this vital ques-
tion. Thc action and decision of the whole 
Congress were therefore constitutionally 
made necessary to this fateful undertaking. 
"The Constitution says,. therefore, in effect, 
'Our country shall not be committed formally 
to a trial of force with another nation, our 
people generally summoned to the effort and 
all the legal consequences to people, rights 
and property incurred until the House, Sen-
ate and the President agree.'" Rogers, 
"World Policing and the Constitution" (Bos-
ton, .I1945), p. 35. 
-Concededly there have been many in-
stances, when the President has sent U.S. 
Armed Forces abroad without a declaration 
of war by Congress.3' These have ranged 
from engagements between pirates and 
American ships on the high seas to the dis-
patch of our Armed Forces to Latin Ameri-
can countries. 
These precedents cannc.t justify the pres-
ent actions without bringing to mind Swift's 
comment on "precedents" in ''Crulliver's 
Travels": 
"It is a maxim among these lawyers, that 
whatever hath been done before, rosy legally 
be done again; and therefore they take spe-
cial care to record all the decisions formerly 
made against common justice and the gen-
eral reason of mankind. These, under the 
name of precedents, they produce as au-
thorities to justify the most iniquitous opin-
ions; and the judges never fail to directing 
accordingly."

country's involvement in the Korean war.

and betray their interests. It should there-
fore be difficult, in a republic to cited:fro war; 
but not to make peace." Story op. cit., 
sec. 1166. 
Manifestly the residuary power eft to the 
President --"th repel sudden attack" con-
templated attacks on the countty's geo-
graphical territory?not "sudden at tacks" in 
far-off lands, such as southeast Asia. Cf. 
Tonkin Bey joint resolution. of Aug. 6-7, 
1964, discussed in sec. IV, infra. 
"See U.S. Senate Committee or. Foreign 
Relations and Committee ,on Armed Services, 
hearing, "Situation in Cuba," 87th Cong., 2d 
sess., Sept. 17, 1962 (Washington. G.P.O., 
1962), pp. 82-87; Rogers,. op. cit., -specially 
pp. 93-123. 
For the United States fought wider the 
aegis of the United Nations pursuant to a 
definitive resolution of the Security Council 
authorizing and directing the employment 
of Armed Forces of member states, so that 
the United States was thus perfoeming its 
solemn obligations undertaken in iecorning 
a signatory of the United Nations Charter, 
a treaty which is the "Supreme Lew of the 
Land." But in the Vietnamese situation, 
there has been no authorization by the Se-
curity Council; indeed the Security Council 
has not even been seized of the metter, has 
not been requested to entertain jurisdiction 
of the present conflict. 
It is therefore unfortunately vitally neces-
sary, although trite, to recall that "the Gov-
ernment of the United States has been em-
phatically termed a government of !aws, and 
not of men." Marbury v. MarliNc,n, 1 Cr. 
137 (1803). Under a government 17l. laws. 
the President is not free from the ,.hacks of 
the Constitution of the United States; the 
President is not free to assume the pow-
ers entrusted solely to the Congress. Ours 
is not a government of executive su-
premacy.. 
Here it is fitting to recall that on May 6, 
1954, at a time when the fall of Lien Bien 
Phu was imminent, then Senator Lyndon. 
Johnson, as Democratic leader of the Senate, 
at a Jefferson-Jackson dinner, critieized the 
Eisenhower administration in these terms: 
"We will insist upon clear explanations of 
the policies in which we are asked to co-
operate. We will insist that we and the 
American people be treated as adults?that 
we have the facts without sugar coating. 
"The function of Congress is nut simply 
to appropriate money and leave the problem 
of national security at that."3" 
A New York Times survey (June 1.1, 1965) 
reports widespread "uneasiness" over the 
President's foreign policies; that tie .Arner-
lean academic world "is intellectually and 
emotionally alienated from the President, to 
whom it gave such strong support in the 
election"; that there is "increasing?and 
mutual--hostility between the President and 
many segments of the press"; that many' 
Democratic Members of Congress are "restive 
and unhappy * * * over what tiny regard 
as [the President's] high-handed manner 
of making and carrying out deeielons on 
foreign affairs"; that many friendly govern-
ments abroad "are apprehensive ali)out Mr. 
Johnson's use of national power"; that 
among these views are expressions of "dis-
may," the unreliability of CIA and FBI 
reports which the President accepted, the 
lack of clear policy, the disregard of "prie-
eiples, support or advice." 
It is therefore imperative that Congress 
guard zealously against any executi ye usur-
pation of its exclusive power to declare, or 
to decline to declare war. 
President Johnson has not been. aninind-
ful of the damaging consequences inherent 
in the violation of the separation 01 powers. 
As recently as August 21, 1965 the President 
vetoed a $1.7 billion military construction 
bill, calling it "repugnant to the Conistitti-
tion." In a stern message to Congress, the. 
President described certain section:: of the 
bill as clear violations of the "separation of 
powers"; warned Congress to stop meddling 
Si "With all its defects, delays, eit 1 incon-

Yet the President has not hesitated to in-

Congress to declare war. 
TV?CONGRESS HAS NOT DECLARED WAR IN VIET-
NAM; ITS JOINT RESOLUTIONS ARE NEITHER 
A SUBSTITUTE FOR A DECLARATION OF WAR NOR 
DO THEY MAKE PRESIDENT JOHNSON'S WAR-
MAKING CONSTITUTIONAL 
Congress has not declare war in Vietnam 
and the President does not claim that any 
declaration of war supports his actions in 
Vietnam. In fact, the President is reported 
to be extremely reluctant to ask Congress 
directly to declare war.,7 Instead, the Presi-
dent is reported (New York Times, June 19, 
1965, p. 10) to believe that authority for his 
actions may be inferred or extracted from 
the Tonkin Bay Joint Resolution of August 
6-7, 1964 (H.J. Res. 1145; Public Law 88-408, 
78 Stat. 384, 88th Cong., 2d sess.) and 
the Joint Resolution of May 7, 1965 (H.J. 
Res. 417; Public Law 89-18; 79 Stat. 109, 89th 
Cong., 1st sess.) making a supplemental ap-
propriation to the Defense Department for 
the Vietnam operations. 
The Tonkin Bay resolution is not a decla-
ration of war. At most, it is an ultimatum?
if that. It "approves and supports the de-
termination of the President, as Commander 
in Chief, to take all necessary measures to 
repel any armed attack against the forces 
of the United States and to prevent further 
aggression." It goes on to express the view 
that "the maintenance of international 
peace and security in southeast Asia 'is vital' 
to the national interests of the United 
States" and declares he readiness of the 
United States to take all necessary steps, in-
cluding the use of armed forces, to assist 
any member or protocol SEATO state to de-
fend its freedom. The resolution, however, 
provides that all such steps shall be "con-
sonant with the Constitution of the United 
States and the Charter of the United Na-
tions and in accordance with its obligations 
under the Southeast Asia Collective Defense 
Treaty." 
It is clear that Congressmen who voted for 
the Tonkin Bay Joint Resolution were not 
voting a declaration of war in Vietnam. The 
resolution does not mention North Vietnam 
nor China; indeed it does not even mention 
Vietnam. It was "passed in the fever of in-
dignation that followed reported attacks by 
North Vietnamese torpedo boats against U.S. 
fleet units in Tonkin Bay." CONGRESSIONAL 
RECORD, June 9, 1965, p. 12528. There is no 
evidence that Congress thought or under-
stood that it was declaring war. It took no 
contemporaneous action which would have 
implemented a declaration of war. And the 
remarks of several Members of the House and 
Senate during and since the debate on the 
resolution reinforce the conclusion that the 
Tonkin Bay Resolution was not regarded as 
a declaration of war. Congress manifestly 
cannot delegate to the President its exclusive, 
power to declare war; and even under the 
specific terms of the Tonkin Bay Resolution, 
the President's actions neither conform nor 
are consonant with the Constitution?and, 
as we have seen in the earlier analysis, the 
President's actions are not consonant with 
the Charter of the United Nations, nor with 
the SEATO Treaty. 
In passing the May 7, 1965, resolution, au-
thorizing a supplemental appropriation for 
the Vietnam operations, Congress was con-
fronted with a fait accompli which se-
verely circumscribed its action. Its constitu-
tional check on the will or errors of the 
Executive was by the President's message, re-
duced to its power of the purse. Such a cir-
cumscription will not necessarily prevent un-

United States May Become More Candid on

wise or unpopular decisions or allow for the 
exercise of the full discretion which the 
Constitution intended Congress to have, and 
for it alone to exercise. Nevertheless, a reso-
lution authorizing an appropriation does not 
constitute a declaration of war, nor can it 
constitutionally authorize the President to 
wage an undeclared war. 
The presidential assumption of powers 
vested exclusively in the Congress concern 
arrogations of power which convert republi-
can institutions, framed for the purpose of 
guarding and securing the liberties of the 
citizen, into a government of executive su-
premacy. If the Constitution has such elas-
tic, evanescent character the provisions for 
its amendment are entirely useless; presi-
dentially-determined expediency would be-
come then the standard of constitutional 
construction. 
Under the rule of law, compliance with 
the forms and procedures of the law are as 
Imperative as compliance with the substance 
of the law. A lynching is a totally inade-
quate substitute for a trial, regardless of the 
guilt of the victim. What Mr. Justice Frank-
furter wrote in another context is equally 
applicable here: "The history of liberty has 
largely been the history of observance of 
procedural safeguards." McNabb v. United 
States, 318 U.S. 332, 347, (1947). 
Under our system, constitutional powers 
must be exercised in a constitutional man-
ner by constitutionally established institu-
tions. Disregard of fundamentals in an area 
concerning the highest sovereign prerogative 
affecting the very lives and fortunes of its 
citizens in the interest of a short term ex-
pediency undermines" 'constitutional moral-
ity' to such an extent that the maintenance 
of the order itself is endangered." Fried-
rich, "The Philosophy of Law in Historical 
Perspective," p. 216 (Chicago, 1963). 
Finally, it cannot be over emphasized that 
even a declaration of war by the Congress 
would not negate the violations of our ob-
ligations assumed under the United Nations 
Charter or negate the violations of interna-
tional law inherent in United States inter-
vention in Vietnam. 
Conclusion 
A learned authority in international af-
fairs has stated: 
"Bluntly, all the rules about intervention. 
are meaningless if every nation can decide 
for itself which governments are legitimate 
and how to characterize particular limited 
conflict. Unless we are prepared to continue 
a situation in which the legality of inter-
vention will often depend upon which side 
of the fence you are on, and in which, there-
fore, our policy becomes one of countering 
force with force, we must be willing to refer 
questions of recognition (i.e., legitimacy of 
the government involved) and characteri-
zation of a disorder (i.e., whether an armed 
attack from abroad or a civil war) to some 
authority other than ourselves. The United 
Nations is the most likely candidate for the 
role." " 
The United States has not observed the 
letter or spirit of its treaty obligations with 
respect to the action taken in Vietnam. 
World order and peace depend on the will-
ingness of nations to respect international 
law and the rights of other nations. The 
United Nations is a symbol of the rejection 
of fatal policies which led to World War It, 
and an acceptance by the peoples of the 
world of the principles of collective security, 
and the avoidance of war and the use of 
armed forces in the settlement of differences 
between nations. The United Nations was

University, "Intervention: Three Problems 
of Policy and Law" found in Essays on Inter-
vention, a publication of the Marshon Center 
for Education in National Security, Ohio 
State University Press, pp. 19-20. 
intended to insure the preservation of inter-
national peace, security, and justice, through 
rules of law, binding upon all member na-
tions. The fundamental condition for the 
effective functioning of the United Nations 
is the observance on the part of all signatory 
nations of the obligations assumed under 
the charter. Only in this way can the awe-
some potential of a third world war be 
prevented. 
We have concluded that the U.S. Govern-
ment is in violation of its treaty obligations 
under the U.N. Charter. We urge upon the 
Government that all steps be immediately 
taken to undo this illegality by an immedi-
ate return to an observance of the letter and 
spirit of the provision of the U.N. Charter. 
This is a solemn hour in history. We have 
a moral obligation to history to return to the 
high purposes and principles of the United 
Nations?to honor the pledges we solemnly 
assumed?to settle international disputes by 
peaceful means?to refrain in international 
relations from the threat or use of force. 
At this fateful hour, we do well to recall 
the prophetic dream of President Franklin 
D. Roosevelt, the architect of the United Na-
tions, who upon his return from the Yalta 
Conference in his last address to the Con-
gress in March 1945, said: 
"The Crimea Conference * * ? ought to 
spell the end of the system of unilateral 
action, the exclusive alliances, the spheres 
of influence, the balances of power, and all 
the other expedients that have been tried for 
centuries?and have always failed. We pro-
pose to substitute for all these, a universal 
organization in which all peace-loving na-
tions will finally have a chance to join." 
Should we not, 20 years after President 
Roosevelt's hopeful dream-20 years after 
the advent of the nuclear age with the awe-
some potentiality of incineration of our 
planet and the annihilation of our civiliza-
tion and the culture of millenia?should we 
not "spell the end of the system of unilateral 
action * * * that has been tried for cen-
turies?and has always failed"? 
Mr. CASE. Mr. President, the meas-
ure before the Senate would authorize 
the appropriation of supplemental de-
fense funds required by our forces in 
Vietnam. I shall vote for the measure 
for what it is?an authorization to fund 
urgent military requirements. And I 
shall vote to table the amendment to re-
peal the so-called Tonkin Gulf resolu-
tion of 1964. 
Much has been said in recent days 
about the implications of our votes for 
or against this or that proposition bear-
ing upon the foreign policy of the United 
States. We have been reminded that 
the Senate approved ratification of the 
Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty 
in 1955 by a vote of 82 to 1, and adopted 
the Tonkin Gull resolution by a vote of 
88 to 2. And it has been suggested that, 
by these acts, the Senate conferred upon 
the President complete discretion to deal 
with southeast Asia as he may see fit. 
I do not so regard my votes for the 
SEATO treaty and the Tonkin Gulf reso-
lution. Nor do I feel that, by now voting 
against repeal of the resolution and for 
this authorization bill, I am abdicating 
my responsibility as a Member of the 
Senate and of the Committee on Foreign 
Relations to maintain a vigilant watch 
over the course of this Nation's, policies 
in southeast Asia in the months ahead. 
Eighteen months ago, when we 
adopted the Tonkin Gulf resolution, we 
were giving a vote of confidence to the 
President in his handling of a particu-

lar situation. To repeal that resolution 
today would make no sense unless one 
feels, as some of my colleagues may feel, 
that it is time for a vote of no confidence 
in the President. That is not my view, 
and that is why I shall vote to table the 
amendment. 
I am satisfied that the administration 
is sincere in its purpose to avoid an esca-
lation that would lead to a general war 
in the Far East and in its conviction that 
our objectives can be attained without 
that happening. 
At the same time, I believe that we 
have a continuing and continuous re-
sponsibility to satisfy ourselves that our 
policies make sense and should be sup-
ported. And I believe that the President 
has a similar responsibility to Congress 
and to the people to keep us fully in-
formed at all times.

PLEMENTARY MILITARY AND 
PROCUREMENT AUTHORIZATION, 
FISCAL 1966 
The Senate resumed the consideration 
of the bill (S. 2791) to authorise appro-
priations during the fiscal year 1966 for 
procurement of aircraft, missiles, naval 
vessels, and tracked combat vehicles, and 
research, development, test, and evalu-
ation for the Armed Forces, and for 
other purposes. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, it is 
my understanding that the distinguished 
Senator from Alaska [Mr. GIwSNING1 is 
about to propose an amendment. I 
understand that he does not intend to 
speak on it very long. I understand that 
the distinguished chairman of the com-
mittee may have a few words in answer. 
It will be my intention then to move 
to table the amendment of the Senator 
from Alaska [Mr. GRUENING]. I would 
anticipate there will be a yea-and-nay 
vote. I can guarantee that there will 
be. 
I suggest that all Members sl,ay close 
to the floor as possible. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator 
from Alaska is recognized. 
Mr. GRUENING. Mr. President, I 
call up my amendment No. 481 to S. 2791, 
and ask that it be read. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The amend-
ment will be stated for the infermation 
of the Senate. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
On page 3, after line 8, add the following 
new section: 
"SEc. 302. During any period iihat any 
armed force of the United States it engaged 
in armed conflict or hostilities in iiouthcit sr. 
Asia, no person who is a member of tint u 
armed force serving on active duty by virtue 
of involuntary induction under the Univer-
sal Military Training and Service Act shall 
be assigned to perform duty in such area. 
unless (1) such person volunteers for service 
in such area, or (2) the Congress hereafter 
authorizes by law the assignment to duty in 
southeast Asia of persons involuntarily in-
ducted into such armed forces." 
Mr. GRUENING. Mr. President, the 
proposed amendment would merely pro-
vide that draftees should not be sent to 
southeast Asia to combat without the 
consent of the Congress. 
It does not provide, as some columnists 
have mistakenly reported, that they shall 
not go. It provides that Congress must 
approve. 
There are two objectives. C'ongress 
should be further included in our pro-
ceedings. There has been much discus-
sion in the last few days and months on 
the degree of participation of the Con-
gress in some important measures. This 
would be one way for Congress to partici-
pate and stand up and be couned. 
The history of the proposed amend-
ment is that last August when I was 
visiting in the White House with Presi-
dent Johnson, who had invited me to 
come there and express my views or 
opposition to our policy in southeast 
Asia, I told him that I was planning 
that afternoon to introduce this amend-
atory legislation. 
The President asked me very insist-
ently not to do it. Then he said "If we

March 1, 1966 
Approved Fi::?fralAtitygsfal5E/laabyp_P?REMIA6R000400050008-5 4231 
my vote reflects my conviction that we 
must protect men we have sent into bat-
tle no matter how mistaken the policy 
may be that sent them to that battlefield. 
I accept the words of Senator RUSSELL, 
chairman of the Armed Services Com-
mittee, when he said in presenting this 
bill to the Senate: 
It could not properly be considered as de-
termining foreign policy, as ratifying deci-
sions made in the past, or as endorsing new 
commitments. 
I agree with these further observations 
of Senator RUSSELL: 
Mr. President, an attempt to brush aside 
the misgivings and reservations that many 
Senators and members of the public hold 
about events in southeast Asia would be 
futile. This is not my purpose. I, too, am 
extremely unhappy and concerned about the 
gravity of the situation there and what our 
commitment portends. 
This bill cannot possibly be construed as 
either an endorsement of or as an attack 
upon national policy. It involves more the 
throwing of a rope to a man in the water. 
We may have cause to question how he got 
there, but he is there, he is a human being, 
he is our friend and a member of our family 
and, therefore, if we have a rope and do not 
throw it to him to enable him to assist him-
self out of the water, this would be a cal-
lous and heartless attitude for us to take. 
I think the debate over the past few 
weeks and the Senate Foreign Relations 
hearings have been most helpful in 
clarifying some of the problems we face 
in Asia. I only wish more Senators had 
been involved in the debate of our south-
east Asia policy a year ago. I hope now 
that we will do everything in our power 
to avoid an all-out war in Asia. Such 
a war would claim the lives of vast num-
bers of American men and in the end 
create conditions of disorder that would 
open the way for the very tyranny we 
fear. I hope the debate will continue on 
all aspects of our Asia policy. It is only 
through such free and open discussion 
that we can find the way to an effective 
policy. 
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE BEING MISLED INTO 
AN UNNECESSARY HOLOCAUST IN VIETNAM 
Mr. GRUENING. Mr. President, yes-
terday, in discussing S. 2791, I stated 
that, in my opinion, the American people 
are being misled into an unnecessary 
holocaust. 
S. 2791, the supplemental procurement 
and construction authorization bill, now 
before the Senate, will plunge the United 
States into an unlimited war in Asia. 
It is a blank check for unlimited esca-
lation. 
I use the word "misled" advisedly be-
cause the true facts are not made avail-
able to the Amercan public and we are 
asked to legislate under a cloak of 
secrecy. 
Just as when we were asked to pass 
the Bay of Tonkin resolution in August 
of 1964 and to pass an unneeded $700 
million appropriation in May of 1965, we 
are now asked to pass?in a hurry?a 
$4.8 billion military authorization which 
is far more than it seems, and takes us 
one more step down the road to a major 
war which, while now confined to south-
east Asia, could easily spread to the rest 
of the world. 
The President was clear when he re-
quested this supplemental authorization. 
He said in his message of January 19, 
1966: 
In the last 2 years, in repeated acts of au-
thorization and appropriation, the Congress 
has provided continuing support for our na-
tional decision "to prevent further aggres-
sion" in southast Asia. The quoted words 
come from the joint resolution of the Con-
gress?Public Law 88-408?approved on Au-
gust 10, 1964. It is in the letter and the 
spirit of the resolution that I request this 
supplementary appropriation. While that 
resolution remains in force, and until its ob-
ligations are discharged, we must persevere. 
I believe the resolution is right, and I believe 
the course we follow is necessary. I intend 
that those who must face danger and death 
as we follow that course shall be supported. 
I am confident that the Congress will agree. 
In the clear and enequivocal words of 
the President, the supplemental is re-
quested within "the letter and spirit" 
of the Tonkin Bay resolution. 
We are being urged to pass this sup-
plemental as an urgent matter. 
Yet, as the able and distinguished 
chairman of the Foreign Relations 
Committee, Mr. FULERIGIIT, pointed out 
on February 28, 1966: 
The Armed Services Committee of the 
House stated that there was no particular 
urgency and that this bill is a kind of leg-
erdemain affecting next year's budget. It 
was handled in this way so that there would 
not be as big a deficit as would have been 
the case otherwise. Therefore, these au-
thorizations were shifted into this bill. As 
far as the material being needed now, the 
House stated that the testimony on that 
point was not persuasive. 
The report of the Armed Services 
Committee of the House states: 
The essential purpose of, and underlying 
cause for, the proposed legislation is, of 
course, the war in Vietnam. Aircraft, both 
fixed wing and helicopters, ships, missiles, 
and tracked combat vehicles are all being 
utilized at a rate greater than it was pos-
sible to anticipate when the 1966 authoriza-
tion for those items was passed. This leg-
islation was approved by the committee 
solely in order to achieve more rapid pro-
curement of replacements of articles con-
sumed, and to provide proper equipment 
for a larger force in a shorter period of time. 
If there is one reservation felt by many 
members of the committee regarding the 
necessity for this legislation, it arises from 
the possibility that many of the items in-
volved, in all three categories of procure-
ment, research and development, and con-
struction, may simply have been moved from 
the regular 1967 authorization to this supple-
mental 1966 authorization without any real 
program for acceleration. Obviously no 
military advantages would be gained by such 
a bookkeeping situation. Testimony on this 
subject was indecisive and the committee 
has not yet been provided with sufficient 
definite data to pinpoint the exact degree of 
real acceleration, or to determine the 
amounts involved in the proposed legisla-
tion which could safely and should properly 
be deferred until the regular 1967 authori-
zation. 
We realize the difficulty of determining 
exact future needs in any wartime frame-
work, however, and to the extent of the pro-
posed legislation we are accepting in good 
faith the assurances of the services and the 
Department of Defense that this authority 
is needed for these purposes at this time. 
We assure the Members of the House that 
the performance of the Department of De-
fense and of the services in living up to these 
assurances will be closely followed. 
As I have said, we are called upon to-
day to legislate under a cloak of secrecy. 
And it is not easy for an individual 
Senator to obtain the necessary informa-
tion on which to determine whether the 
broad grants of power to the President 
and the Secretary of Defense which 
would be made by this bill are really 
necessary. In the 367-page printed 
Volume of the Senate hearings on S. 2791 
there are not fewer than 958 deletions?. 
close to 3 deletions per page. The 
374-page printed volume of the House 
hearings on a companion bill contains 
the same abundant deletions. 
Even if an individual Senator should 
obtain unanimous consent from the Sen-
ate Committee on the Armed Services to 
read the original hearing record contain-
ing all the testimony, including the por-
tions deleted for security reasons, the 
individual Senator would be better in-
formed, presumably, but could in no 
event share that additional information 
with the American people. 
Thus, if in the course of the original 
hearings, it should be disclosed that sub-
stantial escalation is provided for in this 
bill?as Secretary of Defense McNamara 
did testify to publicly?the individual 
Senator could not reveal the factual 
background to the American people if 
those facts are based on the classified 
material he read. 
There are five basic policy decisions 
which the Senate is being called upon 
to decide in voting on S. 2791. 
In the first place, it is being called 
upon to authorize unlimited escalation as 
the President may decide. As Secretary 
of Defense McNamara stated before the 
Senate Committee on Armed Services: 
The budget will provide forces and equip-
ment sufficient to fight the war at substan-
tially increased scope and intensity, should 
that become necessary and desirable. 
In the second place, S. 2791 would au-
thorize the Secretary of each military 
department to build military installa-
tions and facilities any place in south-
east Asia they may decide. This is con-
trary to established precedent under 
which military installations and facilities 
are authorized on a line item basis. 
In the third place, S. 2791 would au-
thorize the Secretary of Defense to build 
such permanent military bases anywhere 
in the world. This again violates estab-
lished precedent for line item authoriza-
tions by the Congress for each such base. 
The House hearings clearly reveal that 
the Department of Defense, in sub-
mitting its budget request for these 
military bases, could not justify its re-
quest on the basis of specific items, 
again pointing to the fact that there is 
no urgency for the authorization of such 
bases because the military planners do 
not now know what they will need. 
And finally, S. 2791 would change the 
method of funding the support of Allied 
forces in southeast Asia from the military 
assistance program?coming within the 
purview of the Senate Committee on 
Foreign Relations?to the regular au-
thorizations for the support of the 
Department of Defense?coming within

4232 (.1 )NGRESSIONAL RECORD SENATE March 1, 1966 
the purview of the Senate Committee on 
Armed Services. This is a vital change 
in policy since, to all intents and pur-
poses, this represents a downgrading of 
civilian influence in South Vietnam as 
represented by our Ambassador there to 
the benefit of our military commander 
there. 
There are thus five policy decisions 
involved in S. 2791: 
First. A reaffirmation of the Bay of 
Tonkin resolution; 
Second. Delegation to the President 
of the power of unlimited military 
osculation in southeast Asia; 
Third. A change in long established 
precedents for Congress to authorize the 
establishment, of each military base and. 
the delegation of such authorization 
authority to the Secretary of Defense 
and the Secretaries of the-Army, the Air 
Force, and the Navy: and, finally, 
Fourth. A change in financing the 
support of the allied forces in South 
Vietnam from the military assistance 
program to the regular authorizations 
to the Department of Defense. 
8. 2791 is therefore not a simple 
military supply bill. It is a bill making 
sweeping changes in 'U.S. policy. 
If this were just another military 
authorization bill to supply needed ma-
terial for our fighting men in Vietnam, 
there would be no question of my support 
for it. 
But S. 2791 is not just another military 
authorization bill. 
S. 2791 is nothing more than another 
device like the premise was to commit 
the Congress to administration policy. 
It is designed to obtain blanket con-
gressional approval of what has been 
done militarily in Vietnam and of what 
may be done militarily in the future how-
ever great the escalation and into what-
ever part of southeast Asia this military 
adventure may lead our forces. 
-
I have in the past and will in the fu-
ture support military authorization and 
appropriation needs but only where such 
.needs are real and where the bill is not 
iaeing used as a coverup device for se-
curing enormous delegations of power 
from the Congress to the executive 
branch or for securing congressional ap-
proval for future policies, the nature of 
which is not disclosed to the Congress. 
It has been alleged and will be again 
that this bill is needed to support our 
boys at the front. On the contrary, the 
enactment of this bill will spell the death 
of thousands more. I want to see that 
wanton scarifice of the flower of our 
youth stopped. I have voiced again and 
again on the floor of the Senate my con-
viction that all South Vietnam is not 
worth the life of a single American boy. 
We have already lost over 2000, of them, 
and under this bill the casualties will 
steadily increase. I cannot in good 
conscience lend my vote to this needless 
and unjustifiable slaughter. I shall vote 
against this bill. 
Mr.. RUSSELL of Georgia. Mr. Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
order for the yeas and nays entered on 
Saturday, February 26, 1966, on the com-
mittee amendment in the nature of a 
substitute, be rescinded, and that the 
bill proceed to a third reading, and then 
I shall ask for the yeas and nays on 
passage. 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there ob-
jection to the request of the Senator 
from Georgia? The Chair hears none, 
and it is so ordered. 
The question is on agreeing to the com-
mittee amendment. 
The committee amendment in the 
nature of a substitute was agreed to, as 
follows:

So the bill (S. 2791) was passed. 
The title was amended, so as to read: 
"A bill to authorize appropriations dur-
ing the fiscal year 1966 for procurement 
of aircraft, missiles, naval vessels, 
tracked combat vehicles, research, devel-
opment, test, evaluation, and military 
construction for the Armed Forces, and 
for other purposes." 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
move that the vote by which the bill was 
passed be reconsidered. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, I move 
that the motion to reconsider be laid on 
the table. 
The motion to lay on the table was 
agreed to. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, it is 
always a great honor and a distinct 
privilege to congratulate the distin-
guished senior Senator from Georgia 
[Mr. RUSSELL]. Today is no exception. 
The able and skillful chairman of the 
Armed Services Committee has again 
earned the highest respect of the Senate 
with the near-unanimous passage of the 
supplemental authorizations for our 
Armed Forces. 
Characteristically, his resolute and 
highly capable handling of this measure, 
more than anything t,7.-_?2, was responsible 
for this great success. He was eloquent. 
He was articulate. The credit is his and 
it is richly deserved. 
The Senate's action today represents 
just one of many brilliant achievements 
in support of our servicemen brought 
about by the tireless efforts of the great 
Georgia Senator. Through the years he 
has keenly appreciated and anticipated 
consistently the needs of our servicemen. 
That is extremely important. But even 
more, he, like no others, has devoted his 
unexcelled determination and undaunted 
No. 36-12 
capacities to assuring the fulfillment of 
those needs?all to make our troops un-
matched on the face of the earth. So 
again today he has successfully repre-
sented those men with his usual incom-
parable advocacy, or, as he put it him-
self?with all the power of his being. We 
are grateful. All America is grateful. 
We are grateful, too, for the splendid 
efforts of the junior Senator from Mis-
sissippi [Mr. STENNIS]. As chairman of 
the Preparedness Investigating Subcom-
mittee, he is always a tireless and de-
voted worker for the men in our armed 
services. Today's success is his to share. 
And to the distinguished senior Sena-
tor from Massachusetts [Mr. SALTON-
STALL] goes high commendation and 
sincere appreciation for his unsurpassed 
cooperative leadership. As always, his 
unfailing efforts helped immensely to 
bring about the passage of this most 
important authorization. 
Finally, I personally am deeply grate-
ful to those Members of this body who 
so ably and properly presented their own 
views concerning our efforts in Vietnam, 
but who nonetheless joined today in giv-
ing our fighting men the decisive sup-
port which they deserve so much. I am 
referring particularly to the distinguished 
Senator from Arkansas?that astute and 
eloquent chairman of the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee. I also refer to the 
senior Senators from Indiana [Mr. HART-
KE] , Idaho [Mr. Oilmen], Pennsylvania 
[Mr. CLARK] , and Tennessee [Mr. GORE], 
to the junior Senators from Ohio [Mr. 
YouNc] , and South Dakota [Mr. McGov-
ERN] , and to all other Senators who, 
while examining and analyzing our 
southeast Asia policy and the nature of 
our commitments there?which is truly 
their privilege in the best traditions of 
this body, today stood behind our troops 
to meet the vital needs of those brave 
men who risk their lives daily. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, the senior Senator from Maryland 
[Mr. BREWSTER] Was not available to 
vote today. The RECORD will reflect that 
had he been here he would have voted 
for the bill that was passed as he said 
in his speeches on the floor of the Senate. 
He would have voted to table the amend-
ments that were offered. 
The senior Senator from Maryland 
[Mr. BizewsTzs] was appointed as a 
congressional adviser to the American 
delegation to the GATT Trade Center 
meetings in Geneva, Switerzerland. He 
is serving as the personal representative 
of the Senate Commerce Committee at 
the trade meetings. 
The GATT meeting which opened on 
Monday has been specifically called to 
consider ways and means of promoting 
increased trade with underdeveloped 
nations. 
Senator BsEwsTER will be in Geneva 
for a week as a member of the American 
delegation. He regarded the mission as 
extremely important to the United 
States, and of particular interest to the 
port of Baltimore, one of the foremost 
trading centers in the United States. 
We assured the Senator that we would 
make every effort to see that he had a 
pair; and in the event that that was not 
possibl", if it appeared his vote would 
be required, we would seek to have him 
return. We did not think that that was 
necesary and the RECORD will so show. 
MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE 
A message from the House of Repre-
sentatives, by Mr. Hackney, one of its 
reading clerks, informed the Senate that, 
pursuant to the provisions of 42 United 
States Code 2251, the Speaker had ap-
pointed Mr. YOUNG of Texas as a mem-
ber of the Joint Committee on Atomic 
Energy, to fill an existing vacancy there-
on, on the part of the House. 
The message announced that the 
House had passed a bill (H.R. 12889) to 
authorize appropriations during the fis-
cal year 1966 for procurement of aircraft, 
missiles, naval vessels, tracked combat 
vehicles, research, development, test, 
evaluation, and military construction for 
the Armed Forces, and for other pur-
pbses, in which it requested the concur-
rence of the Senate. 
SUPPLEMENTAL MILITARY AND 
PROCUREMENT AUTHORIZATION, 
FISCAL 1966 
Mr. RUSSELL of Georgia. Mr. Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that the 
Senate proceed to the consideration of 
H.R. 12889. 
The PRESIDING 0101010ER (Mr. HAR-
RIS in the chair). The bill will be stated 
by title for the information of the Senate. 
The LEGISLATIVE CLERK. A bill (H.R. 
12889) to authorize appropriations dur-
ing the fiscal year 1966 for procurement 
of aircraft, missiles, naval vessels, tracked 
combat vehicles, research, development, 
test, evaluation, and military construc-
tion for the Armed Forces, and for other 
Purposes. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the immediate consideration 
of the bill? 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill (HR. 
12889), 
Mr. RUSSELL of Georgia. Mr. Presi-
dent, I move to strike out all after the 
enacting clause of H.R. 12889 and sub-
stitute therefor the language of S. 2791 
as it just passed the Senate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
question is on agreeing to the motion of 
the Senator from Georgia. 
The motion was agreed to. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
question is on the engrossment of the 
amendment and the third reading of the 
bill. 
The amendment was ordered to be en-
grossed, and the bill to be read a third 
time. 
The bill was read the third time. 
The PRESIDING Ors'ICER. The 
question is on passage of the bill, as 
amended. 
The bill (H.R. 12889) was passed. 
Mr. RUSSELL of Georgia. Mr. Presi-
dent, I move that the Senate insist on its 
amendment, request a conference with 
the House on the disagreeing votes there-

Presiding Officer appointed Mr. RUSSEL/. 
of Georgia, Mr. STENNIS, Mr. SYMINGTON, 
Mr. SALTONSTALL, and Mrs. SMITH C011-
forces on the part of the Senate. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection the Senate bill (S. 2791) is in-
definitely postponed. 
PERSONAL STATEMENT 
Mr. MeCARTHY, Mr. President, I 
had intended to make these remarks be-
fore the motion to table was acted on, 
but when the motion was presented, I 
thought it would be presented as an 
amendment rather than a motion. Since 
I felt; my remarks would have little effect 
on the outcome of the vote, I withheld 
them until this time. 
It was my hope that we would have a 
straight vote on the amendment of the 
Senator from Oregon. The matter of the 
Tonkin Gulf resolution has been dis-
cussed for sometime, and it was indicated 
that there would probably be a vote on 
the question of rescinding it, which had 
been suggested by some officials high in 
the administration. 
There was a later indication that, fol-
lowing the vote on that, or perhaps as a 
substitute, we would have a vote on the 
reaffirmation of the Tonkin Gulf reso-
lution. 
I had intended to vote against the 
Morse proposal to rescind the Tonkin 
Gulf resolution, but also to vote against 
the amendment which would have reaf-
firmed that resolution. 
It is my judgment, by virtue of the 
various interpretations that have been 
placed on the Tonkin Gulf resolution 
since it was first approved in August 
1964, that the resolution, in the minds of 
some persons, has taken on a meaning 
and a significance which had not been 
attributed to it at the time it was before 
the Senate and was passed on August 10, 
1964. 
It is my opinion, in view of the con-
tinuing discussion of the resolution, that 
the Senate will be somewhat slow in the 
future about adopting resolutions of this 
kind. 
The fact is that I made a statement, 
which was affirmed by some Members of 
the Senate--and the position I took was 
reaffirmed by the President in his press 
conference?that this resolution did not 
give to the President any power he did 
not have before we passed the resolu-
tion, and that if we had rescinded it we 
would not have taken away any powers 
he possessed under the Constitution and 
any powers which have been confirmed 
by the history of this country and by 
precedents. 
think the question must be asked: 
What purpose do resolutions of this kind 
serve? 
Acknowledging that the resoluti.on 
gives the President no power which he 
does not already possess, there are, then, 
two purposes. 
One, it may be reassuring to the Presi-
dent in the way of congressional or pub-
lic support. Second, there is the possi-
bility that passing such resolutions will 
prevent second-guessing and improper 
criticisms. 
Those of us who served either in the 
House or in the Senate following the ac-
tion of President Truman in the Korean 
war will remember the conversations in 
the cloakroom to the effect that it 
would have been wise if President Tru-
man had had a resolution passed to pre-
-vent criticism on the part of Members 
who had given their vote in support of 
a resolution for that action in Korea. 
I think President Truman acted quite 
properly, and took the responsibility 
which the President has, without in any 
way seeking to take authority or power 
which he did not properly possess and 
carry it out on his own accord. 
Various interpretations have been 
placed on the resolution by Members of 
the Senate. The minority leader said 
we should not rescind the resolution be-
cause we would be taking away powers 
the President was given. I submit we 
could not take way any power by rescind-
ing the resolution because we did not 
give the President any power by passage 
of the resolution. 
It was suggested in debate?not so 
much an the floor, but outside this 
Chamber, in statements made by some 
people high in the administration?that 
because Congress passed the resolution, 
Congress should not be critical of new 
policies or new applications. I submit 
this is a dangerous interpretation of the 
resolution. 
:In view of the experience we have had 
over the last 6 months in the interpre-
tation and application of the resolution, 
I think we ought to be most careful in 
the future with regard to similar resolu-
tions, not just because of the political 
implications but because what is in-
volved is a fundamental change of the 
constitutional power of the Presidency. 
If we are to allow this practice to grow 
and establish precedents whereby reso-
lutions of this kind begin to take on 
strength of their own, the only logical 
conclusion is that, first, the constitu-
tional powers which Presidents have ex-
ercised since the country was founded 
are being challenged, and perhaps even 
undermined. 
Second. There is danger in this kind 
of resolution that there may be a growth 
of tradition and the establishment of 
precedents of power in the Congress 
which it does not possess and which is 
not provided for under the Constitution. 
Third. There is danger that in the 
passage of resolutions of this kind it may 
lead to challenges on the part of Con-
gress as to the power of the President. 
Whether the attempt would be success-
ful or not is an open question, but if we 
are concerned about protecting the con-
stitutional powers of the President, if we 
are concerned with not making the Sen-
ate into a kind of garden club which 
passes resolutions with reference to 
Presidential powers, and if we are con-
cerned perhaps with the freedom of this 
body to carry out its own constitutional 
responsibilities in the field of foreign 
policy, resolutions of this kind should not 
be approved in the future. 
ORDER OF BUSINESS 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I am about to lay 
down the pending business. 
Mr. MORSE. I invite the attention of 
the majority leader and the minority 
leader to the fact that this is a day of 
precedents in the Senate: a very im-
portant precedent, I believe, was estab-
lished and the policy reaffirmed. 
The minority leader will recall that a 
few days ago on the floor of the Senate, 
we were discussing how to dispose of the 
bill, timewise, and I urged that the Sen-
ate go ahead without a unanimous-con-
sent agreement and the probabilities 
would be that we might finish the bill by 
Tuesday night. 
I invite attention to the fart that this 
Tuesday night, the time is now 6:15, and 
a vital precedent has been established. 
In fact, as an old common law lawyer, 
and a believer in sound precedent. I 
should like my majority leader to know 
that that precedent is going to stand. 
Accordingly, we can forget about 
unanimous-consent agreements on major 
legislation from now on, because we save 
time without having them. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. The distinguished 
Senator from Oregon is truly generous. 
He is extremely tolerant. He possesses 
an infinite amount of wisdom with re-
spect to human nature, and I congratu-
late him. 
Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, that is a 
great compliment and I thank the Sena-
tor from Illinois. 
Mr. JAVITS. Mr. President, I should 
like to join the minority leader and the 
Senator from Oregon [Mr. MORSE I in 
saying that I, too, believe that the Senate 
has had one of its finest days of debate. 
It has resulted in the exercise of self - 
discipline which the Senate has shown 
sow 1 ? he Chamber today. 
ORDER FOR .ADJOURNMENT 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that when the 
Senate concludes its business today, it 
adjourn until 12 o'clock noon tomorrow. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
out objection, it is so ordered. 
U.S. PARTICIPATION IN THE ASIAN 
DEVELOPMENT BANK 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I 
ask unanimous consent that Calendar 
No. 982, HR. 12563, be laid down and 
made the pending business. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill 
will be stated by title for the informa-
tion of the Senate. 
The LEGISLATIVE CLERIC. A bill, H.R. 
12563, to provide for the participation 
of the United States in the Asian De-
velopment Bank. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there 
objection to the present consideration of 
the bill? 
There being no objection, the Senate 
proceeded to consider the bill. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President? no 
action will be taken on the Asian de-
velopment bill tonight.

AUTHORIZING APPROPRIATIONS 
DURING FISCAL YEAR 1966 FOR 
PROCUREMENT OF AIRCRAFT, 
MISSILES, NAVAL VESSELS, 
TRACKED COMBAT VEHICLES, RE-
SEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST,

CONSTRUCTION 
Mr. SISK. Mr. Speaker, by direction 
of the Committee on Rules, I call up 
House Resolution 743 and ask for its im-
mediate consideration. 
The Clerk read the resolution, as 
follows: 
H. RES. 743 
Resolved, That upon the adoption of this 
resolution it shall be in order to move that 
the House resolve itself ihto the Committee 
of the Whole House on the State of the Union 
for the consideration of the bill (H.R. 12889) 
to authorize appropriations during the fiscal 
year 1966 for procurement of aircraft, mis-
siles, naval vessels, tracked combat vehicles, 
research, development, test, evaluation, and 
military construction for the Armed Forces, 
and for other purposes, and all points of or-
der against said bill are hereby waived. After 
general debate, which shall be confined to 
the bill and shall continue not to exceed 
three hours, to be equally divided and con-
trolled by the chairman and ranking mi-
nority member of the Committee on Armed 
Services, the bill shall be read for amend-
ment under the five-minute rule. At the 
conclusion of the consideration of the bill 
for amendment, the Committee shall rise and 
report the bill to the House with such amend-
ments as may have been adopted and the 
previous question shall be considered as 
ordered on the bill and amendments thereto 
to final passage without intervening motion 
except one motion to recommit. 
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from 
California is recognized for 1 hour. 
Mr. SISK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 30 
minutes to the gentleman from Califor-
nia [Mr. Swam], and, pending that, I 
yield myself such time as I may consume. 
Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 743 
provides an open rule, waiving points of 
order, with 3 hours of general debate for 
consideration of HR. 12889, a bill to 
authorize appropriations during the fiscal 
year 1966 for procurement of aircraft, 
missiles, naval vessels, tracked combat 
vehicles, research, development, test, 
evaluation, and military construction for 
the Armed Forces, and for other 
purposes. 
The essential purpose of, and under-
lying cause for, H.R. 12889 is, of course, 
the war in Vietnam. Aircraft, both fixed 
wing and helicopters, ships, missiles, and 
tracked combat vehicles are all being uti-
lized at a rate greater than it was possible 
to anticipate when the 1966 authorization 
for those items was passed. It is hoped 
that the legislation will achieve more 
rapid procurement of replacements of 
articles consumed, and will provide 
proper equipment for a larger force in a 
shorter period of time. 
The bill authorizes $3,417,700,000 for 
procurement; $151,650,000 for research, 
development, test, and evaluation; and 
$1,288,100,000 for military construction. 
Mr. Speaker, there have been ques-
tions raised, and we have heard a great 
deal of discussion in the past few days 
respecting this particular piece of 
legislation. 
It seems to me that the issue is very 
clear cut and the interpretation to be 
placed upon a vote for and in support 
of this legislation is very simple. We 
simply desire to make certain that our 
men in uniform will have ample equip-
ment and weapons to meet our commit-
ments there and to make certain that 
we carry out the aims and the programs 
of our Government in South Vietnam 
and in other areas of the world where 
such commitments exist. Through the 
proper and timely and, yes, the escalated 
carrying out of those commitments we 
will that much sooner bring the enemy 
to the point of being willing to discuss 
peace with reference to these problems. 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, will the gen-
tleman yield? 
Mr. SISK. I will be glad to yield to the 
gentleman from Missouri. 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate 
the gentleman from California yielding 
to me, and I would like to associate my-
self with his statement as far as the vote 
on HR. 12889 is concerned. My question, 
in the interests of consistency, inasmuch 
as last week I raised similar doubts re 
waiving all points of order on the rule 
making in order debate on the supple-
mental foreign aid bill authorization, is 
one on the rule. As the member of the 
distinguished Committee on Rules of this 
House who is bringing this legislation to 
the floor, will the gentleman kindly ad-
/vise me why line 9 is inserted therein 
eliminating all points of order? This was 
a bill which was brought from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs recently. It 
was stated then that there was no reason 
within the bill itself for this, and that it 
had simply been inserted on recommen-
dation of the Parliamentarian without a 
request by the chairman of the commit-
tee or without the desire of the Com-
mittee on Rules. Is this the same 
situation today? 
Mr. SISK. Mr. Speaker, if I may com-
ment, I would like to call the gentleman's 
attention to page 5 of this legislation, the 
bill H.R. 12889, and specifically to call his 
attention to line 8 of page 5, Title IV: 
General Provisions, section 401(a) . If 
the gentleman will read that, he will find 
that this bill provides for certain trans-
fers of funds. Therefore, that would be 
subject to a point of order, since it does 
amount to a transfer of funds. 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, if the gentle-
man will yield further, I have read that 
in detail. I know that the committee of 
which I am a member, the House Com-

EXCERPT FROM PROPOSED LEGISLATION 
,,AUCATION 
have proposed a total Federal investment 
in education and training during the com-
ing year in excess of $10 billion?a threefold 
increase, since 1961. 
Our education programs must be admin-
isitered wisely and well. Shortly after pas-
!ewe of the Elementary and Secondary Edu-
eation Act of 1965, I directed that the Office 
iff Education be reorganized to carry out its 
expanded responsibilities more effectively and 
efficiently. This reorganization has now 
been completed. 
hi addition, we established the new post 
at Assistant Secretary for Education in the 
Department of Health, Education, and Wel-
fare to strengthen program coordination 
throughout the Government. 
The Congress has already put this Nation 
on the path toward the achievement of goals 
to-
1..81x tend special educational help to 12 
illion disadvantaged and handicapped 
children; 
2. Eliminate illiteracy within a decade; 
2. Bring public library services to 15 mil-
lion more Americans; 
4. Reduce by half the rate of high school 
filaments over the next 5 years; 
5. Guarantee the opportunity for educa-
tion beyond high school on the basis of abil-
ity: to learn, rather than ability to pay; 
Provide college building and facilities 
to meet the needs of 9 million students ex-
pected by 1975, 
intl educational opportunity for every cit-
izen requires that we build on the beginnings 
we have aireigly made, I recommend 
measures to expand the Headstart program 
for preschool children; to strengthen the 
Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 
1965; to expand Federal assistance to higher 
education; and to improve the Nation's 
libraries, 
expand the Headstart program or pre-
oot children 
,ocw programs have had the visible suc-
cess of Operation Headstart. The disadvan-
taged children who have benefited from this 
program are already entering first grade--
with new confidence in themselves and 
eagerness to learn. 
1: have requested funds almost double the 
Headstart program during the corning year 
La insure full year programs for 210,000 chil-
dren; summer programs for 500,000 children. 
This marks a significant step in providing 
greatly expanded preschool assistance for 
5-year-olds from disadvantaged homes, and 
tiummer nursery programs for 3- and 4-year-
cis. 
TT 
erengthen the Elementary and Secondary 
Education Act of 1065 
Though funded only 4 months ago, the 
1.ilementary and Secondary Education Act of 
effin has already begun to bring its benefits 
te Hie Nation: 
-ipeci al help is being provided the dis-
advantaged?remedial teaching, health and 
Food services, augmented teaching and coun-
seling staffs.

More books--interesting and up-to-date?
have begun to appear on school library 
abelvea. 
New approaches to old problems axe being 
tried; instructions for the student extends 
beyond the classroom to museums, hos-
pitals, factories. 
Regional education laboratories are- being 
developed to stimulate new technicues of 
teaching and lea7ning in our schools. 
State educational agencies are strength-
ening their m toffs and assuming greeter re-
eponsibtlities. 
Educational deprivation cannot be over-
come in a year. And quality cannot be 
achieved ovcenight. 
I propose that the Elementary and Sec-
ondary Education Act be extended for 4 
years. 
My budget includes increased funds for 
each title of the act. 
In addition, I propose that coverage of the 
act be enlarged to raise from $2,000 te $3,000 
the family income formula for allocating aid 
for educatioo of the disadvantaged com-
mencing: in fiscal 1968; to earmark additional 
funds for children of American Indiens and 
migrant workers. 
Careful study of the incentive grant pro-
vision of title I shows that payments would 
be made to many districts unrelated to need. 
I therefore recommend repeal of ihe in-
centive grant provision of title I in ceder to 
focus Federal aid on basic grants to more 
than 20,000 local school districts. 
Too many schools in urban and rural slums 
are ancient and in disrepair. Chsolete 
schools aggravate the problem of eliminating 
de facto segregation in our northerim com-
munities, thus depriving -children of full 
educational opportunities. 
There is a pressing need for long-range, 
community-wide planning to bring innova-
tion and imiOnation in school construction. 
I propose that 85 million be added to title 
TIT to help communities in. planning school 
construction to encourage innovation and to 
deal with obsolescence, overcrowding, and 
special problems such as de. facto segrega-
tion. 
A recently completed study of the fed-
erally impacted area program, requested by 
Congress, has concluded that certain provi-
sions should Oe revised. 
I recommend revision of the existinsr law?
To require school districts to abeorb a 
uniform and fair share of the burden of edu-
cating children in federally affected districts; 
To base pcyme:ffts on school expenditures 
in local districts :rather than on natl.- mal or 
State average per pupil cost; 
To eliminate eligibility for Federal im-
paced area assistance in those cases where 
Government property is leased to private en-
terprises that pay local taxes.

H.R. 9302 
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of 
Representatives of the United Stat,,s of 
America in Congress assembled, That Lieu-
tenant Charles W. Pittman, Junior, United 
States Navy, of Columbia, South Carol)na, is 
relieved of liability to the United Steies in 
the amount of $3,493.71, representing the 
total amount of overpayments of comeensa-
tion made to him by the Department of the 
Navy during the period June 6, 1960, through 
June 30, 1964, as a result of the use of an 
erro.neous pay entry base date. In the audit

mittee on Armed Services, in its wisdom, 
inserted this there for this stated pur-
pose. If in fact this does eliminate the 
question of the transferability between 
operation and maintenance funds, and 
pay of the Army or personnel funds for 
all the military services, then why is it 
necessary to have a waiver of all points 
of order, which I believe the gentleman 
will agree with me eliminates the pow-
ers of the individual Members as to ger-
maneness and as to other functions in an 
authorization bill which is coming from 
a legislative committee to be considered 
in debate on the floor of the House? It is 
getting to be a habit rather than a neces-
sity for simply inserting the waiver in all 
rather than an appropriation bill or a 
Ways and Means Committee bill. I won-
der if the elected Members, the people's 
personal representatives in this Con-
gress, realize that they are waiving away 
by operating under such rules their 
power of objection and even compound-
ing it because of the fact that it is not 
necessary? 
Mr. SISK. Let me say to my good 
friend from Missouri that I well .appre-
ciate the statements he is making. I 
want to assure the gentleman that the 
Committee on Rules does not take light-
ly this idea of waiving points of order. 
We only do this when we feel it is essen-
tial in order to expedite the legislation 
as well as in order to be completely fair 
to all Members of the House. Accord-
ing to legal advice which we had in the 
committee that this particular transfer 
would be subject to a point of order, 
which means that one individual could 
bring about the elimination of transfers, 
we sincerely feel that this would be in 
the best interests of the legislation. I 
want to say to my good friend that I do 
not think you will find the committee 
feels lightly about this whole question of 
waiving points of order. We are con-
cerned, I think, to try to see every Mem-
ber's rights are protected and that legis-
lation is brought to the floor where it 
may be considered from the widest pos-
sible standpoint, with an open rule, with 
the right of amendment and the right of 
every Member to make his position 
known. However, as the gentleman 
very well knows, from time to time, on 
these transfers which are subject to 
points of order, it is simply felt that it is 
In the best interests of the expeditious 
handling of the legislation to waive 
points of order in such a case. I hope 
the gentleman will accept that state-
ment, that it was done in all good faith. 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Speaker, I do accept 
that, and I am delighted with the state-
ment of the gentleman from the Com-
mittee on Rules, which is thus made a 
matter of record, but if you will refer to 
page 2 of the report of the committee 
where it discusses section 401, it plainly 
sets forth that in the original Depart-
ment of Defense language there was this 
"transferability," but that the commit-
tee added the words "for their [the serv-
ices] stated purposes." 
And then there is the last sentence in 
that paragraph, discussing section 401 
(a) wherein there appears the state-
ment: 
There is no intent to authorize additional 
appropriation transfer authority for the pur-
poses of this section. 
Mr. Speaker, I also want to get that 
in the RECORD. 
Then there is the question which sim-
ply comes back to the statement of 
whether, if there is no intent and if it 
was not requested?it has not been re-
quested over the past 19 years based 
upon my available research and knowl-
edge, by the Committee on Armed Serv-
ices that any points of order be waived, 
why is it suddenly injected here so that 
debate thereon can be eliminated? 
Mr. Speaker, I believe we are treading 
on dangerous ground. 
Mr. SISK. I well appreciate the gen-
tleman's position, but our advice was that 
that language was subject to a point of 
order. I understand the explanation of 
the report and I gather that that possi-
bly was not the intent. 
I well understand the gentleman's feel-
ings, and I want to assure the gentleman 
that the committee is going to look close-
ly at all requests for waiving points of 
order and we shall not do so unless such 
requests are made. 
Mr. HALL. I appreciate that. 
Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reserva-
tion. I have done this in order to em-
phasize the point that I made in the 
House last week when we were consider-
ing the rule on the bill which came to 
us from the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs, and I shall continue to object to 
the inclusion of such points of order. 
Mr. McCORMACK. Mr. Speaker, 
would the gentleman yield? 
Mr. SISK. I yield to the distinguished 
Speaker of the House of Representatives. 
Mr. McCORMACK. Mr. Speaker, I 
wish to congratulate the chairman and 
members of the Committee on Armed 
Services for the very fine hearings which 
the committee held on thi,; bill, and for 
the manner in which they expedited the 
consideration of the bill in the commit-
tee. 
I also wish to congratulate the chair-
man and the members of the House 
Committee on Rules for their prompt 
action so that this bill could be brought 
up at this time, which is the earliest con-
sideration of the bill that could possibly 
be accomplished. 
Mr. Speaker, these two actions repre-
sent leadership on the part of the Com-
mittee on Armed Services and on the 
part of the Committee on Rules. 
Mr. Speaker, this bill is a very im-
portant one. As stated in the commit-
tee report, it is directed toward the sup-
port of our forces in Vietnam. All of us 
understand the purpose of this bill. 
When we are voting on this bill every 
Member will appreciate the fact that he 
or she is voting to give our boys who are 
fighting in South Vietnam and carrying 
out the word of our country and the obli-
gation of our country, and to act in ac-
cordance with the national interest of 
our country, the means and the facili-
ties?the military means and facilities?
to accomplish the purposes that we have 
in mind?to stop aggression and to bring 
about as early as possible peace in this 
area, and in the world. 
Mr. Speaker, in connection with this 
legislation there is the resolution of 
August 10, 1964, which completely covers 
the entire situation. In that resolution 
we said, in unity with the Chief Execu-
tive, and to show the world the unity 
between the Chief Executive and the 
legislative branch, that the United 
States?and I quote: 
The United States regards as vital to its 
national interest and to world peace the 
maintenance of international peace and 
security in southeast Asia. Consonant with 
the Constitution of the United States and 
the Charter of the United Nations and in 
accordance with its obligations under the 
Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, the 
United States is therefore prepared, as the 
President determines, to take all necessary 
steps, including the use of armed force, to 
assist any member or protocol state of the 
Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty re-
questing assistance in defense of its freedom. 
Now, Mr. Speaker, the President has 
the power and has had the power under 
the reserved powers of the President as 
Commander in Chief, but this resolution 
was adopted at the time in order to show 
the world the unity that existed be-
tween the executive branch and the legis-
lative branch of the Government of the 
United States. 
Mr. Speaker, we took the same course 
of action in the Formosan resolution 
when President Eisenhower was the 
Chief Executive of our country. We 
took the same course of action in the 
Middle East resolution when President 
Eisenhower was our Chief Executive. 
Both of the resolutions are still the 
law of our land, just the same as the 
resolution of August 10, 1964, is the law 
of the land today. 
So, Mr. Speaker, the firmness of Presi-
dent Johnson in performing his duties as 
Commander in Chief of our Armed 
Forces, following in consonance with 
this resolution, is the finest example of 
leadership that could be evidenced by 
any man. 
If we had firm leadership in the thirties 
when Hitler was around, the probabilities 
are that World War II never would have 
taken place. 
If we had that firm leadership as 
exemplified by the late Sir Winston 
Churchill, I believe Hitler would never 
have been permitted to go in and take 
over Austria. 
Those who felt that Hitler would be 
satisfied were living in a dreamworld 
of hope. Hitler was not satisfied. Then 
followed the taking over of the Sudeten-
land?the forcing of the Czech Govern-
ment to cede the Sudetenland, an impor-
tant part of Ccezhoslovakia, to the Ger-
man Reich. They hoped Hitler would be 
satisfied. But Hitler was not satisfied. 
Later Hitler without opposition took over 
the remainder of Czechoslovakia. Then 
came the rape of Poland and then the 
war. 
We were dealing with a militant ag-
gressor in those years and we are dealing 
with a militant aggressor today. There 
is the calculated risk of action?yes. 
But there is the calculated risk of in-
action. And the calculated risk of in-
action was evidenced in the thirties when 
Hitler was permitted to go ahead?and to

go ahead?and to go ahead?finally 
bringing about the great catastrophe 
known as World War II. 
So this bill is up today to enable our 
boys and those of our allies to fight for 
freedom and to fight against militant; 
aggression. It is as important today that 
we have firm leadership as it was im-
oortant in the thirties when firm, strong 
leadership was lacking. 
Sc' in voting for this bill today. I am 
voting not only for the bill but I am also 
voting again for the resolution that we 
adopted on August 10, 1964, which was 
adopted by an overwhelming majority 
of both branches of the Congress. Thus, 
we will convey to the actual and potential 
anemy and also the rest of the world that 
America, is united. They will understand 
that message. They will understand that 
action. They will ; understand that 
language. 
Mr. SISK. Mr. Speaker, on behalf of 
he Committee on Rules, I express my 
appreciation to the distinguished Speaker 
of the House for his comments with 
reference to our committee. I join with 
him in his commendation of the Com-
mittee on Armed Services for their ex-
peditious handling of this bill. 
nuther, Mr. Speaker, I join with our 
distinguished Speaker in the very 
eloquent way in which he has expressed 
the position of the House of Representa-
tives, and join fully and wholeheartedly 
with him in the hope that our vote will 
be unanimous. I join with him, too, in 
feeling that we will again be expressing 
our support for the resolution which was 
adopted in 1964. 
Mr, Speaker, I reserve the balance of 
my time. 
(Mr. SISK asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. SMITH of California. Mr. Speak-
er, I yield myself such time as I may use. 
(Mr. SMITH of California asked and 
was given permission to revise and ex-
tend his remarks.) 
Mr, SMITH of California. Mr. Speak-
er, House Resolution 743 will provide for 
hours' debate, an open rule so far as 
amendments are concerned, waiving 
points of order for the consideration of 
H.R. 12889, to authorize additional ap-
propriations for fiscal 1966 for procure-
ment, of aircraft, missiles, naval vessels, 
tracked combat vehicles, research, devel-
opment, test, evaluation, and military 
construction. Points of order are waived 
because of section 401(a) which appar-
ently provides additional leeway for the 
use of funds previously appropriated. 
The purpose of the bill is to authorize 
additional appropriations in fiscal 1966 
in the areas of weapon procurement, re-
search and development, and military 
construction. These additional funds are 
required because of the accelerating situ-
ation in Vietnam. 
The authorization is broken down as 
follows: $3,417.700,000 for procurement, 
$151,650,000 for research and develop-
ment, $1,288,100,000 for military con-
struction, and $4,857,450,000 for total au-
t horization. 
All services share in the authorization, 
and in all parts of it. The Marines are 
included with the Navy. 
The committee has tightened up the 
language submitted by the Department 
of Defense in section 401 to insure that 
funds appropriated for one purpose will 
not be shifted to another, according to 
the report. However, the requested rule 
asks that points of order be waived, be-
cause of this very point. The language 
in question is the last phrase of section 
401, lines 14 and 15 on page 5 of the bill. 
The committee also added an amend-
ment to insure that it would receive in-
formation prior to contract letting on 
intended military construction. In the 
same field, the committee added author-
izations to the bill for the Navy to con-
struct additional facilities at Okinawa 
and Subic Bay. The Joint Chiefs ap-
proved the addition. 
This authorization is not to be merely 
a speeding up of fiscal 1967 actions, but 
is to be in addition thereto. While testi-
mony on this subject and solid facts are 
indecisive as to how much an increase 
will be achieved, the committee has the 
assurances of the Department of De-
fense and will keep a close watch on the 
situation to see that an actual increase 
is achieved. 
Pages 5 through 21 of the report detail 
the various construction projects, re-
search programs, and weapons covered 
by the bill. Three billion one hundred 
forty-nine million six hundred thousand 
dollars alone is for aircraft, planes, and 
helicopters. Also included are tracked 
vehicles, missiles and missile ground 
support equipment. Construction proj-
ects run the gamut from troop housing 
to airfields and supply depots. 
Finally, section 302 includes a $200 
million authorization to provide the Sec-
retary of Defense with authority to pro-
ceed with any construction he finds vital 
to U.S. security, wherever needed, to sup-
port our troops. 
There is no minority report. 
As stated by the distinguished chair-
man of the Committee on Armed Serv-
ices, Mr. RIVERS: 
Our men are in South Vietnam. They need 
weapons. This bill is an essential step in 
providing t.Aose weapons. 
Mr. Speaker, I know of no objection to 
the rule, and urge its adoption. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the 
gentleman from Wisconsin Mr. LAIRD]. 
Mr. LAIRD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in 
support of the pending legislation, which 
is authorized by this rule. I hope that 
the House will take prompt action on the 
appropriation authorization. Our De-
fense Appropriations Committee has had 
hearings on all items included in this 
authorization bill and is ready to report 
as soon as the authorization becomes 
law. 
The funds authorized in this bill are 
needed now because our Defense Estab-
lishment is spread dangerously thin from 
one end of this world to the other if we 
are to meet all of the worldwide commit-
ments outlined by the Secretary of De-
fense iin his Senate testimony within the 
past 2 weeks. Not to pass this legislation 
would place reserve stocks for American 
fighting men in a dangerous position in 
some sections of the world. 
We have Reserves and National Guard 
troops that have recently enlisted in the 
Reserve and National Guard that have 
gone as long as 3 and 4 months without 
fatigues in which to train. That fact 
came out in the testimony before our 
committee. Funds are needed and are 
necessary to carry on worldwide commit-
ments of this Nation. I hope that the 
House will move forward and act 
promptly on this legislation. 
Mr. Speaker, for the past, 10 clays our 
Nation has witnessed confusion within 
the administration on the U.S. peace 
terms and future form of government in 
Vietnam. This spectacle has produced 
so much official fog that it can only be 
harmful to the war effort. 
It is time, indeed it is past time, for 
the party in power to face its responsi-
bilities and offer clear, consistent leader-
ship with regard to our goals in Vietnam. 
Instead, we see a continuing wrangle that 
disputes whether we should be in Viet-
nam at all, what our aims are there, and 
whether the right means are being used 
to achieve these aims. 
These divisions were brought to a 
head when a prominent Democratic Sen-
ator proposed settling the problem of 
Vietnam as the problems of Poland, of 
Rumania, of Bulgaria, of Czechoslovakia 
were settled after World War II?by 
admitting the Communists to a share of 
responsibility and power in government. 
This proposal has triggered an outpour-
ing of contradictory statements and 
doubletalk from administration spokes-
men. 
Some spokesmen denounced the idea. 
Vice President HUMPHREY declared: 
Such a plan would be like putting a fox in 
a chicken coop * * * an arsonist ii a lire 
department. 
Under Secretary of State George Bell 
termed the Senator's suggestion "ab-
surd." McGeorge Bundy said the 
United States is "not going to deliver 
the South Vietnamese people to the ad-
ministrations of a Communist regime, 
because that is what this war is all 
about." 
But, almost simultaneously, other of-
ficial spokesmen began to talk in differ-
ent terms. Gen. Maxwell Taylor, one of 
the President's chief advisers on Viet-
nam, said the Senator's call for Com-
munist participation in the government 
was "very, very close" to his own view. 
However, just 2 days before, General Tay-
lor had told the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee that he did not see how "the 
freedom of 15 million South Vietnamese 
could be compromised." At the time 
this was generally understood to mean 
that General Taylor opposed any politi-
cal role in South Vietnam for the Com-
munists. The next day, February 23, the 
Senator in turn seemed to back off from 
his original proposal by saying that he 
was not proposing that the Vietcong 
should automatically have a share of 
power in an interim preelection govern-
ment but was merely saying that they 
should not be "automatically excluded" 
from having it,. 
Mr. Speaker, at almost the same time, 
Bill D. Moyers, the White House press 
secretary, said there was no disagree-
ment between the administration and 
the Senator "if Senator KENNEDY did not 
propose a coalition government. with

4253 
Communist participation before elections 
are held." But then Moyers, when 
asked what kind of government the ad-
ministration envisioned in the interim 
Period between negotiations and elec-
tions, said this "should be left to the 
negotiating parties." 
Mr. Speaker, the same day the Presi-
dent in a speech attempted to answer the 
question: Who has a right to rule in 
South Vietnam? Unfortunately, he con-
fined himself to broad philosophy, 
rather than addressing himself to the 
questions raised by the Senator. The 
President said: 
The people must have this right?the 
South Vietnamese people?and no one else. 
Washington will not impose upon the people 
of South Vietnam a government not of their 
choice. Hanoi shall not impose upon the 
people of South Vietnam a government not 
of their choice. We shall insist for ourselves 
on what we require from Hanoi; respect for 
the principle of government by the consent 
of the governed. We stand for self-deter-
mination?for free elections?and we will 
honor their results. 
At a news conference on February 26, 
the President avoided the opportunity 
to make the administration view clear. 
He was asked: 
Mr. President, to clear up some confu-
sion * * * about the role of the American 
military in Vietnam could you set the rec-
ord straight on whether the American troops 
in Vietnam are fighting to stabilize and 
maintain a democratic, non-Communist gov-
ernment or whether their goal is to get free 
elections in which the Communists might 
emerge as a part of a coalition government? 
The President replied: 
Well, I would have to refer you to the 
detailed statements of Secretary Rusk " *. 
If they're not satisfactory, I would refer you 
to the statements of the Prime Minister in 
Honolulu. 
Since Secretary Rusk and Prime Min-
ister Ky have not been in complete 
agreement, this answer given by the 
President is anything but helpful. 
Premier Nguyen Cao Ky and Chief of 
State Nguyen Van Thieu have both said 
they would never deal with the Vietcong 
or the National Liberation Front. Sec-
retary Rusk has said there is no insuper-
able obstacle to representation of the 
Vietcong at a peace conference and that 
the administration would accept any 
government in Vietnam provided that 
the elections were free. 
On February 27, the debate within the 
party in power reached new heights. 
The Senator insisted that the adminis-
tration would be prepared to see Com-
munist elements in the government. The 
Senator cited Mr. Moyers eight times as 
support for his views although he agreed 
that the administration had on some oc-
casions made conflicting statements. 
The Senator pointedly said: 
Statements that are made that we will 
never deal with assassins and we will never 
deal with murderers makes it difficult for 
them to believe they are being asked to come 
to the negotiating table other than to sur-
render. 
The Senator also moved back to his 
original position, saying that in return 
for certain concessions, "we"?note he 
does not say the South Vietnamese peo-
ple but "we"?"would see that they 
played a role in the processes of the gov-
ernment, whether it is in the interim 
period of time or in the final period of 
time." 
Vice President Hummarv, that same 
afternoon, reminded the Senator that 
the Vietcong was "not an Asian version 
of Americans for Democratic Action" 
and that he is "not going to be any part 
of suggesting to the people of South Viet-
nam or any other government, that you 
should reward the kind of banditry and 
murder which has characterized the 
Vietcong by giving it legitimacy in a gov-
ernment. I just do not believe in it. 
There is no legitimacy to the National 
Liberation Front. It is exactly what it 
says it is, a front and we do not intend 
to recognize it as a sovereign entity." 
The Vice President also pointed out 
the dangers in coalition governments 
when he cited the situation in Laos to-
day. He described Laos as "a country in 
turmoil; the Pathet Lao attacking, 
backed by thousands of North Viet-
namese troops and moving in on the 
Mekong River which if the Communist 
attack is successful, would destroy the 
hopes of the development of that vast 
area." 
Mr. Speaker, is it any wonder that a 
member of the administration admitted 
that "the credibility of our Government 
has been assailed. We have a great 
problem here maintaining our credibil-
ity with our own people." This remark 
was made last December. 
I call upon President Johnson to end 
the confusion. Perhaps he is unable to 
be as forthright as his Vice President, 
but he should make unmistakably clear 
whether he is supporting the suggestion 
that the Vietcong be given a share of 
power and responsibility in an interim 
government and in a government estab-
lished after elections or whether he is 
supporting his Vice President. The 
American people have a right to know 
exactly what it is their young men are 
fighting for in Vietnam, and they have 
the right to know it now. 
Several Democratic Members of the 
other body have endorsed the proposal 
that the Communists be admitted to a 
share of power and responsibility in the 
Government of South Vietnam. 
The longer uncertainty continues 
about the attitude of the President to-
ward a settlement that would, in the 
Vice President's words, "put the fox in 
the chicken coop," the more difficult it 
will be to maintain the morale of Amer-
ican fighting forces and the people of 
South Vietnam. And the more difficult 
it will be to justify American casualties 
in a war that is presumably fought to 
prevent Communists from forcing them-
selves into positions of power and re-
sponsibility. 
Let there be no misunderstanding 
about the issue. The question before 
the President is not the ultimate gov-
ernment of South Vietnam after a free 
election. The question is what is the 
attitude of the United States toward in-
clusion of Communists in a government 
that would rule until elections are held 
and would determine the form of the 
elections?a government that would de-
termine whether the elections would be 
truly free. 
Unless the United States is prepared 
to oppose a coalition interim govern-
ment at a peace conference, South Viet-
nam will go the way of the satellite na-
tions of Eastern Europe and of Laos. 
Mr. Speaker, if a coalition government 
including Communist representation is 
acceptable to the President?as it is to 
many influential members of his party, 
all the fighting in South Vietnam?all 
the sacrifices?all the bloodshed?make 
no sense, and they should not be further 
prolonged. 
Mr. REID of New York. Mr. Speaker, 
will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. LAIRD. I yield to the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. REID of New York, Mr. Speaker, 
I would like to ask the gentleman a ques-
tion and make a statement before I ask 
the question. I intend to support the 
rule and to back strongly the President's 
supplemental authorization of $4.8 bil-
lion to fully back our men in the field, 
but I do think it is unfortunate, given 
the importance and implications of the 
legislation, that the House today is lim-
iting debate to merely 3 hours. 
Mr. LAIRD. Debate and full consid-
eration of this request as well as the U.S. 
commitment in this area of the world is 
absolutely vital. I agree with the gentle-
man from New York and hope we proceed 
in that fashion here in the House of 
Representatives. 
Mr. SISK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from Virginia [Mr. ABBITT] 
such time as he may consume. 
Mr. ABBITT. Mr. Speaker, I support 
the rule and the bill, H.R. 12889, the 
supplemental defense authorization bill, 
commonly known as the Vietnam mili-
tary bill. This legislation is of vital im-
portance, not only to our military men 
fighting in Vietnam but to all Ameri-
cans. 
Our boys, through no choice of their 
own, are in Vietnam where they are be-
ing shot at, many of whom are being 
wounded, mutilated and killed. It is in-
herent upon us to furnish them with all 
necessary military material that is at our 
command so that they will not be lack-
ing one whit to protect themselves and 
to achieve the goals for which they have 
been sent. We either must furnish every 
needed article of offense and defense or 
else it is our duty to pull them out. We 
must support them wholeheartedly and 
fully or else bring our boys back home. 
It is not fair to them and it is not fair 
to America to do less. 
This is not the time to argue whether 
we should be in Vietnam or whether we 
should have gone. , We are there and 
our boys are being killed by the Com-
munists daily. It is inherent upon us 
to put up or get out and I call upon this 
administration to do everything neces-
sary by way of supplying our men with 
the needed munitions of war immedi-
ately and constantly and I, therefore, 
wholeheartedly support this bill and 
hope it will be passed unanimously. 
(Mr. ABBITT asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SISK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 min-
utes to the gentleman from California 
[Mr. COHELAN].

4254 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- HOUSE march I, 1966 
(Mr. COHELAN asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. COHELAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise 
in support of the rule and of the bill 
which is to follow. I appreciate very 
much the gentleman from California 
giving me this time, which I have asked 
for in order to present the following 
statement in behalf of 78 Members of 
the House of Representatives, and I un-
derstand there may be a few more com-
ing in before the day is over. 
I understand that several of the 78 
Members who signed this statement will 
make additional remarks. 
But as one who has just returned from 
an inspection tour of Vietnam and who 
served for 6 years on the Armed Services 
Committee, I believe this statement 
stands by itself as a timely and impor-
tant contribution to the discussion and 
understanding of a critical issue: 
We agree with President Johnson's state-
ment that "we will strive to limit conflict, 
or we wish neither increased destruction nor 
increased danger." We therefore reject any 
eon tention that approval of this legislation 
will constitute a mandate for unrestrained 
or indiscriminate enlargement of the mili-
tary effort, and we strongly support con-
tinued efforts to initiate negotiations for 
a settlement of the conflict. 
We, in particular, wish to express our con-
currence with the President's statement of 
last week in which he declared the Viet-
namese conflict to be a limited war ior 
limited objectives calling for the exercise of 
"prudent liminess under careful control." 
That is the end of this statement, and 
it is signed presently by 78 Members of 
the House of Representatives. A list of

Mr. SMITH of California, Mr. 
Speaker, I yield 10 minutes to the gentle-
man from Iowa Mir. GROSS] and ask 
unanimous consent that he be permitted 
to speak ont of order. 
The SPEAKER Is there objection to 
the request of the gentleman from 
California? 
There was no objection. 
(Mr. GROSS asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. GROSS, Mr. Speaker, last week, 
when the foreign aid supplemental au-
thorization bill was before the House, I 
questioned the need for an additional 
$100 million for the contingency fund 
for a period of 120 days when $50 million 
had been provided in the regular ap-
propriation for the entire current fiscal 
year and 'not a dime tad been spent in 
Vietnam. 
I said then that money from the pre-
sent contingency fund was being used 
by President Johnson, not in Vietnam 
but to help the British in the boycott of 
Rhodesia?in a joint and outrageous 
effort to destroy that friendly govern-
ment which is seeking its independence 
from Britain. 
In addition to the use of contingency 
funds, I am going to try to ascertain 
before the day is over whether U.S. mili-
tary planes are being used in this repre-
hensible enterprise and, if so, on what 
conditions; and by what authority. 
The subject of "United States -British 
Persecution of Rhodesia on last Thurs-
day brought the gentleman from Illinois, 
[Mr. O'HartAll to the floor of the House 
where he referred to Inc and proceeded 
to unburden himself of a few remarks 
from which I quote briefly: 
Our position as regards Rhodesia --
He said.?
Is based upon our nationsa morality and our 
sense of virtue * * *. Our virtues and 
moralities do not change with the scenery 
of different parts Of the world. What we 
stand for * * * is the right of self-deter-
mination of peoples everywhere *. 
cannot make it too clear that the issue in. 
Rhodesia is essentially the same as the issue 
In Vietnam. 
Then he topped it off with this: 
But we are not beholden to Britain, nor 
Britain to the United States, becalt;e our 
two countries think alike and act with 
similar response when the virtues and 
moralities are in issue. 
I assume that when the gentleman 
from Illinois says our "virtues," "moral-
ity," and support for "self-determina-
tion" does not change with the scenery 
that these ingredients would apply with 
equal force and effect to the city of Chi-
cago, among others. There, according 
to reports, Mayor Daley, the nominal 
head of the Democrat political machine, 
with whom I assume the gentleman from 
Illinois has at least a passing acquain-
tance, is accused by some Negroes and 
whites of denial of the right to deter-
mine "the kind of lives they will make 
for themselves and their children.'' 
A Negro leader has announced he will 
be a candidate to unseat the mayor and 
perhaps attention should be given, in the 
interest of "virtue," "morality," and 
"self-determination," to a boycott of Chi-
cago by the 50 States?a boycott in which 
the virtuous British would be invited to 
participate. 
But let us take a quick trip abroad and 
see, as the gentleman from Illinois says, 
how well "our two countries?the United 
States and Britain?think alike and act 
with similar response when the virtues 
and moralities are the same," 
Let us begin with Cuba, less than 100 
miles off our shores. Perhaps, the gen-
tleman from Illinois [Mr. O'HARA I would 
like to describe to the House the stand-
ard of "virtue," "morality," and 'self-
determination" the U.S. Government 
ascribes to Fidel Castro. He might also 
explain the British version of "virtue" 
and "morality" which permits them to 
trade as usual with Dictator Castro while 
the latter supplies subversives and guer-
rillas to undermine the governments of 
Latin America. and bleed this country of 
money and troops, as in the case of the 
Dominican Republic. 
Perhaps the gentleman from Illinois 
would also like to explain the "virtue" 
and "morality" of British trade and 
profits as usual with Communist North 
Vietnam whose guns have killed 2,000 
Americans and wounded another 11,000. 
He might further explain by what stand-
ard of "virtue" and "morality" the Brit-
ish continued to trade with Red China 
during the Korean war when 35,Wal 
Americans were being killed and another 
120,000 wounded. Without Red Chinese 
troops, equipment and supplies in North 
Korea there would have been little more 
than a skirmish. 
Turning now to Africa I can vemem-
ber how the society of bleeding hearts 
in Washington hailed the establishment 
of a so-called independent, self-deter-
mining government in Ghana. They 
called it the African "showcase of de-
mocracy," and the dollars of American 
taxpayers rolled in. Not too long after-
ward, the head of that government, 
Nkrumahs also known as the "Re-
deemer," made a trip to Washington, re-
Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67600446R000400050008-5 
March 1, /966APproved For 4301140RIMPIVAV 1416:305)6250444?C000400050008-5 
ceived the red carpet treatment, and 
promptly went on a national television 
network to boast that he was a Marxist. 
Thereafter, he kept the path hot to Mos-
cow, carrying high the torch for commu-
nism, at the same time grabbing the 
money we so tenderly proferred him. 
That worked so well that Dictator 
Nkrumah either executed, or jailed and 
held incommunicado, all self-determin-
ing opposition. Through the years since 
1957, We heard of n9 strangling boycott 
by the virtuous British, in which the U.S. 
Government was joined to bring down 
the tyrannical Nkrumah government 
and provide freedom for the Negroes of 
that land. 
Can the reason be that the Rhodesians 
unlike the British and Ghanians never 
picked the pockets of American taxpay-
ers? For the Rhodesians the moral of 
this story seems to be that if you want 
to escape a boycott and economic pun-
ishment climb aboard the Johnson gravy 
train as have the British, Ghanians, and 
a host of others. The tried and tested 
formula these days seems to be to grab 
all the foreign aid possible, then stage 
an insurrection, throw out the bad guys, 
establish a military dictatorship, and 
start the process all over again. 
Incidentally, it would be interesting to 
know the extent of Dictator Nkrumah's 
masterminding, along with his Commu-
nist pals, including the notorious Ro-
berto Holden, of the massacres and 
atrocities that have taken thousands 
upon thousands of lives, black and white, 
Protestant and Catholic, on the African 
Continent in the last few years. 
Now Ghana has just acquired a mili-
tary dictatorship and it will be interest-
ing to hear from the apologists, both in 
and out a Congress, when it is expected 
"virtue" and "morality" will take over. 
Or is a military dictatorship now ac-
cepted as "self-determination"? 
When it became apparent that the 
showcase government of Ghana was in 
reality a brutal tyranny, Nigeria was 
then tauted as the new showcase. Prime 
Minister Balewa was pro-Western and 
an able man. But early this year Negro 
troops of the Nigerian army cut him down 
with their machineguns, along with some 
of his Cabinet officials, and established a 
military dictatorship. If there has been 
a British-United States boycott of Nige-
ria for the purpose of establishing "vir-
tue," "morality," and "self-determina-
tion" for the Negroes of that African 
country we have not heard of it. 
Mr. Speaker, it was some 190 years ago 
that a little band of men assembled on 
this continent, announced they had ab-
sorbed enough abuse from the British 
monarchy, and sued for their independ-
ence. 
Promptly haughty Britain, then mis-
tress of the seas, threw a blockade on 
this continent and attempted to strangle 
the colonists economically. That failed 
because, in part, the British could get no 
help. France, a world power, helped 
break the blockade. 
A few months ago British subjects in 
Rhodesia announced they, too, had paid 
enough tribute to and taken enough dic-
tation from Britain. They announced 
their independence. 
Promptly the British Government es-
tablished a boycott in an effort to stran-
gle the Rhodesians economically and just 
as promptly the shameless opportunists 
In Washington announced they would 
join and help bring the Rhodesians to 
their knees. 
Why have the ultraliberal opportunists 
In Washington involved this Government 
in still another affair on the African 
Continent?a move that may well lead to 
warfare? 
Because, they say, Rhodesia, which has 
been self-governing for two decades, "is 
not yet ready for independence," and be-
cause the color line has been drawn too 
tightly in Rhodesia. 
These Washington opportunists have 
apparently never read history or they 
would know that the rebel colonies of 
1776 had at hand a large population of 
colored natives, Indians, and many thou-
sands of Negroes, none of whom were 
recognized as a part of the community 
for political or governmental purposes. 
But laying aside for the moment the 
history of our forefathers' successful 
struggle to win freedom and independ-
ence from the leeching British in Lon-
don, it is unbelievably reprehensible that 
the United States would now join Britain 
in clamping a boycott on any friendly 
country. 
Rhodesia is a friendly country. It is 
not and never has been an enemy. It 
is strongly anti-Communist and has 
offered to send combat troops to Viet-
nam even though they may be needed 
at home if the British carry out their 
threat to use military force. Whether 
the British, in that case would use 
Englishmen to kill Englishmen or hire 
mercenaries as they did in 1776, is not 
known at this juncture. 
But by what authority did Lyndon 
Johnson impose a boycott on trade with 
Rhodesia? Article 1, section 8, para-
graph 3 of the Constitution of the United 
States provides that Congress has sole 
power to regulate commerce with for-
eign nations. No power is vested in the 
executive to block foreign trade except 
under laws which control trading with 
the enemy and Rhodesia has not been 
designated an enemy. 
Additionally Congress, less than a year 
ago, in legislation which bears the John-
son signature, amended the Export Con-
trol Act of 1949 to provide that: 
The Congress further declares that it is 
the policy of the United States (A) to oppose 
restrictive trade practices or boycotts fos-
tered or imposed by foreign countries against 
other countries friendly to the United States 
and (B) to encourage and request domestic 
concerns engaged in the export of articles, 
materials, supplies, or information, to refuse 
to take any action * * * which has the effect 
of furthering or supporting the restrictive 
trade practices or boycotts fostered or im-
posed by any foreign country against an-
other country friendly to the United States. 
Mr. Speaker, I charge that President 
Johnson, in his usurpation of authority 
to regulate foreign commerce with Rho-
desia deliberately violated the Constitu-
tion of the United States, and I charge 
that in the second instance, with refer-
ence to the Export Control Act, as 
amended, he deliberately violated the will 
and intent of Congress, if not the law. 
4255 
Yes, let us have virtue and morality but 
let it begin here at home. 
On the walls of this Chamber hang 
two portraits and only two. One is that 
of the man often referred to as "the 
Father of his Country," George Wash-
ington, the first President of this Re-
public. It is not difficult to imagine what 
Washington would say to those in this 
country today who so blithely use the 
power of the Government he welded to 
join in destroying the Government of a 
valiant little country seeking its inde-
pendence from British dominion. 
The other gentleman we honor each 
day is the Frenchman, Lafayette, with-
out whose help in breaking the British 
boycott of 1776, it is doubtful that either 
portrait would hang in this Chamber. 
Instead, there would probably be one 
portrait?that of King George III. 
To those who now pander to the Brit-
ish, in view of their dealings with Com-
munist China, Communist North Viet-
nam, and Communist Cuba, I ask again 
whether this Government is operated on 
a standard of double, triple, or quadruple 
morality? 
Mr. SISK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from Georgia [Mr. FLYNT]. 
Mr. FLYNT. Mr. Speaker, I support 
the rule called up by the gentleman from 
California [Mr. Simi and I support the 
bill, H.R. 12889. 
If the resolution referred to a few 
moments ago during the debate on the 
rule by the Speaker of the House of Rep-
resentatives were at issue today, I would 
vote to reaffirm that resolution. 
(Mr. FLYNT asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. SISK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from Texas [Mr. WRIGHT]. 
(Mr. WRIGHT asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. WRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, this de-
bate on Vietnam which has been going on 
in the other body for some weeks, and 
which we join in the House today, will 
serve a national purpose if?instead of 
producing recriminations?it makes us 
face up to our present alternatives, which 
are relatively few. 
In conducting this debate, we need to 
bear in mind that it could be hurtful to 
the national purpose if it should result 
in giving Hanoi and the Vietcong a false 
impression of indecision and irresolution, 
increasing their will to persist and thus 
prolonging the war. 
I do not mean to imply that we should 
refrain from engaging in debate. The 
right to debate this and any other issue 
freely, both in this forum and through-
out the land, is the very thing for which 
American men are dying in Vietnam 
today. 
But surely this particular bill, provid-
ing the military wherewithal necessary 
to the successful conduct of the effort 
to which the Nation is committed, must 
pass. And it must pass overwhelmingly. 
This bill is hardly a proper vehicle for 
the expression of disaffection from our 
national objectives. Let us express ver-
bally whatever reservations we may 
sincerely feel, but a vote against this bill 
would be almost unthinkable.

It would be like coming upon a man in 
the ocean, whose boat had capsized and 
left him swimming, and?instead of 
throwing him a lifeline?engaging in a 
long, abstract debate about whether he 
should have been in the ocean in the 
first place. The time for discussion 
would be atter the lifeline had been 
thrown. 
'today American men are engaging a 
ruthless and relentless enemy in the 
jungles of Vietnam. For the most part, 
it did not ask to go. We sent them. 
Certainly, by all that is right and holy, 
we owe them the obligation to back them 
up with the weapons, the tools, the ma-
teriel, and the united support that they 
need. 
leo]. any Member of this House to vote 
against this bill today would not hasten 
the end of the war. If any considerable 
number of our Members were to do so, it 
could result in unnecessarily extending 
the war by planting false hopes in the 
minds of our enemies. It has been their 
central hope that, if they hold on long 
enough, eventually we will weary of the 
long, twilight struggle as did the French, 
and ultimately withdraw. If we would 
hasten their lying down arms and corn-
inc to the conference table, then let us 
demonstrate clearly and forcefully to-
day that theirs is a vain and forelorn 
hope. The best opportunity for such a 
demonstration on our part would be by 
a unanimous vote for the adoption of 
this bill. 
If we really will peace, then the peace 
offensive and the military offensive must 
go hand in hand. They must be con-
ducted with equal vigor, for one depends 
upon the other. 
We might as well pontificate on the 
free coinage of silver or the admission of 
slave States to the Union as to argue 
about whether American troops should be 
in Vietnam. The fact is that we are 
there. The question is: Where do we go 
from here? 
Hardly anybody actually wants to tuck 
tail and run, inviting an armed Commu-
Fast takeover. Few indeed are blood-
thirsty for a bigger war. Practically no-
body is really satisfied with the present 
situation, and almost everybody yearns 
for an honorable solution. In the search 
I7or this elusive grail, we have been re-
peatedly frustrated. 
Perhaps the clue to such a solution 
may be found in a comment by President 
johnson, 00011 receiving the Freedom 
Award on February 23, wherein he said: 
Wu ask who ins a right to rule in South 
VeLunn. Our answer there is what it has 
been here for 200 years: The people must 
have this right?the South Vietnamese peo-
hle?and no one else.. We stand for self-
determination?for free elections?and we 
will honor thou-result. 
Part of the vulnerability of the South 
Vietnamese to Vietcong propaganda 
stems from the dismal fact that for the 
; 2 years of its independent existence 
South Vietnam has not elected its na-
tional leaders. They have had 10 
Premiers in the past 2 years alone, and 
not one of them chosen by the people. 
Little wonder that so many in that land 
snow limited enthusiasm for defending 
Lien- freedom. 
Think for a moment what a dramatic 
thing it would be if the President should 
publicly and formally propose to the 
United Nations a clear-cut peace plan 
based upon one simple keystone?the will 
of the people. 
To begin, the President could recom-
mend that a free election be held in all 
of South Vietnam?not next year but 
this year?in which it would be proven, 
by ballots rather than bullets, just ex-
actly what government the people of 
South Vietnam want to represent them. 
He could propose that these elections 
be supervised by the U.N. to avMd their 
being falsely rigged by either side?and 
be preceded by a U.N.-supervised 6-
weeks truce to provide a proper atmos-
phere for toeir conduct. 
It would be necessary, of course, for 
both combatant forces to agree in ad-
vance to respect and abide by the. results 
of the elections. But on what defensi-
ble basis could Hanoi or the Vietcong 
refuse? A turndown on their part would 
expose as total fraud their pretenses at 
representing the popular will, betray 
their lack of faith in the people of South 
Vietnam, and help turn the tide of Asian 
opinion to our side. 
Surely we would have nothing to fear 
from such free elections. There has 
been no truly free election anywhere in 
the world during the past 15 years which 
has given any real comfort to the Com-
munists. The South Vietnamese people 
have demonstrated their desire to par-
ticipate. On last May 30, elections were 
held throughout South Vietnam for pro-
vincial and municipal advisory councils. 
In spite of Vietcong threats and intimi-
dation aimed at keeping peop[c away 
from the polls, fully 70 percent of those 
registered voted in the election even 
though the officers elected were to have 
very little real. authority. 
As a second stage, we might want to 
consider building into the plan a con-
crete proposal for similar free elections, 
either 2 or 3 years hence, in ii hich all 
the people of North and South Vietnam 
could vote on unification as decreed in 
the Geneva accords of 1954. 
Both north and south profess to want 
reunification of the country?but each 
on its own terms. The Geneva agree-
ment specified that such nationwide elec-
tions would be conducted in July of 1956. 
South Vietnamese leaders we never 
satisfied that really free balloting would 
result in the northern zone, and the 
solemn agreement was never kept, Much 
of the present bitterness stems f Tom this 
failure. 
A somewhat disturbing report in the 
morning newspaper today quotes South 
Vietnamese Premier Ky as saying that 
his country has the "noble and supreme 
task" of "liberating the North and re-
unifying the fatherland." Let us 
devoutly hope that he does not mean a 
reunification merely on his own terms 
brought a bous solely by the force of arms 
and unratified by popular vote, for this 
would be as wrong in principle as the 
evil against which we fight. The evil 
of communism lies not in its name alone, 
but in its policies and its methods. We 
shall not defeat' it by mimicking those 
methods. We shall defeat it ultimately 
by demonstrating to the world that there 
is a far better alternative by the way of 
democracy, the way of the freely and 
constitutionally expressed popular will. 
We have repeatedly said that we stand 
behind the Geneva accords, even though 
we were not a signatory. This proposal 
would be wholly consistent with our joint 
declaration with Great Britain, made in 
Washington on June 29, 1954, as re-
ported in the Department of State Bul-
letin, volume XXXI, which read: 
In case of nations now divided against 
their will, we shall continue to seek unity 
through free elections, supervised by the 
United Nations to insure that they arc con-
ducted fairly. 
So actually we have said these things 
before, at different times and places. 
But most of the world, unfortunately, 
does not know that we have said them. 
Maybe we have not quite put them into 
one simple package sufficiently dramatic 
to constitute a clarion call to peace and 
freedom in Asia. 
At worst, it would put Hanoi on the 
psychological defensive. If the overture 
failed, then all the world would know 
that we really had tried, and everybody 
would have a clearer idea as to just what 
we're fighting for?the right of every 
people to have a government of their own 
choice, and not one forced upon them by 
anybody else. No longer, if Hanoi re-
jected the proposal, could the Vietcong 
masquerade as liberation forces or accuse 
us of trying to force our will upon their 
country. 
Surely this is one weakness in Senator 
ROBERT KENNEDY'S proposal that the 
Vietcong be admitted to a coalition gov-
ernment, for the impression arises that 
we are bartering away the freedom of 
South Vietnam. 
The point is that we are not there to 
impose on the South Vietnamese a gov-
ernment of our choice but to defend 
their rights to a government of their 
choice. 
Let us make this crystal clear---so clear 
that nobody can mistake or misconstrue 
it. Such an assertion of our faith in the 
democratic processes would show the 
strength of our deepest national convic-
tions. It would be consistent with every 
major civilizing development since the 
Magna Carta. 
We would be challenging the aggres-
sors to let the people decide?in the 
forum of reason rather than the battle-
field of war. If they should refuse, it 
would further condemn them even in the 
eyes of Asians, perhaps gain us more al-
lies and certainly leave us in a better psy-
chological position if we are to stay and 
fight. 
And if they should accept, it might 
pave the way to the conference table and 
the honorable settlement for which all 
men of good will so fervently yearn. 
But if we would encourage the enemy 
to join us on this or any other avenue to 
peace, then we must demonstrate beyond 
doubt that we have both the will and tile 
means to triumph in the military phase 
of this struggle against aggression, and 
the patience to persist even in the face of 
adversity. Unanimous passage of this 
bill today would be one such clear dem-
onstration.

Mr. SISK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the 
gentleman from California [Mr. HOLT-
FIELD] 5 minutes. 
(Mr. HOLIFIELD asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. HOLIFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I am 
supp6rting this rule and I am supporting 
the legislation. I think if a study of the 
map of southeast Asia is made, you 
could readily determine that we are not 
fighting in South Vietnam just for 16 
million people. We are fighting to keep 
1 billion people from sliding into the con-
trol of Red China. That is what we are 
fighting for. 
In that 1 billion people, there are 85 
million people, highly industrialized and 
scientifically trained people in the nation 
of Japan with a capability of making any 
kind of plane or electronic gear or any 
other kind of equipment that can be 
used in war. This is the one thing that 
Red China needs?the industrial capa-
bility of Japan. 
We are fighting against the four-prong 
formula of Communist conquest?infil-
tration, subversion, terrorism, and guer-
rilla takeover. If this formula of 
Communist conquest is allowed to go 
unchallenged, it will be used in every 
country in southeast Asia and in every 
country of the underdeveloped world. 
Let no one believe that our surrender 
and withdrawal from Vietnam would 
bring peace in southeast Asia or in the 
world. It would bring further use of 
the formula of Communist conquest in 
every country in southeast Asia and in 
the underdeveloped world. 
Peace cannot be established by the sur-
render to a dictator's forces of tyranny 
and aggression. We cannot bring peace 
to the world in that way. None of us 
want war. None of us want our boys to 
be killed in foreign jungles. We all want 
peace and we all want to negotiate, but 
we do not want to reveal every term of 
possible negotiation before we get to the 
negotiation table. That is not the way 
that negotiation is successfully accom-
plished. Peace can be established in 
my opinion by the support of just prin-
ciples by our country and hopefully by 
other countries throughout the world. 
Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance 
of my time. 
Mr. SISK. Mr. Speaker, I move the 
previous question on the resolution. 
The previous question was ordered. 
The SPEAKER. The question is on 
agreeing to the resolution. 
The resolution was agreed to. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. 
Speaker, I move that the House resolve 
Itself into the Committee of the Whole 
House on the State of the Union for the 
consideration of the bill (H.R. 12889) to 
authorize appropriations during the 
fiscal year 1966 for procurement of air-
craft, missiles, naval vessels, tracked 
combat vehicles, research, development, 
test, evaluation, and military construc-
tion for the Armed Forces, and for other 
purposes.

IN COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE 
Accordingly, the House resolved itself 
into the Committee crf the Whole House 
on the State of the Union for the consid-
eration of the bill H.R. 12889, with Mr. 
CAREY in the chair. 
The Clerk read the title of the bill. 
By unanimous consent, the first read-
ing of the bill was dispensed with. 
The CHAIRMAN. Under the rule, the 
gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. 
RivERs] will be recognized for 11/2 hours, 
and the gentleman from Massachusetts 
[Mr. BATES] will be recognized for 11/2 
hours. 
The Chair recognizes the gentleman 
from South Carolina [Mr. RIVERS]. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, in that a little later, time may 
be of the essence, I yield 10 minutes now 
to the distinguished gentleman from New 
York Mr. RYAN] . 
(Mr. RYAN asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Chairman, I thank 
the distinguished chairman of the Com-
mittee on Armed Services for having 
yielded to me to start what I hope will be 
a reasoned debate on the policy consid-
erations which should guide us in con-
sidering this very important bill today. 
The bill before us authorizes a supple-
mental appropriation of $4.8 billion prin-
cipally for the procurement of aircraft 
and missiles and the construction of 
bases. The funds are needed, we are 
told, for the war in Vietnam. This is 
certainly not a routine authorization for 
a routine appropriation. It is rather a 
request for another brick in the arch of 
congressional support which the admin-
istration is constructing for its policy. 
Although the war is being fought without 
a declaration of war, the President never 
hesitates to remind the Nation that it is 
being fought with the sanction and ap-
proval of Congress. The President made 
It clear in his news conference on Febru-
ary 27 that he regards support of this 
authorization for military appropriations 
as an endorsement of the administra-
tion's Vietnam policy. If the President 
considers this a matter of policy, so do I. 
The basic issue is U.S. policy in Viet-
nam. 
The question is not whether courageous 
American soldiers, sailors, and airmen 
are to be adequately equipped, supplied, 
and protected in carrying out and ex-
ecuting their assigned missions. Of 
course, as long as they are committed to 
battle, they must be provided for prop-
erly. No one argues that. If this were 
simply a bill to give supplies to the dedi-
cated men in the field, it would have my 
full support. The real question is what 
our goals and objectives in southeast 
Asia should be and what strategy should 
be adopted in an attempt to realize them. 
It is not a matter of support for men in 
combat, but whether they should be in 
combat at all, or if they are, what their 
missions should be in the context of what 
strategy and what policy. 
This is a bill to finance escalation, not 
to finance an existing policy or decisions 
already made. It is now before us, and 
our responsibility is a heavy one. 
We should understand, if not accept, 
the fact that modern warfare is con-
ducted without a formal declaration of 
war by Congress. We delude ourselves, 
and we delude the American people, if we 
pretend that Congress should ignore 
policy when it authorizes the appropria-
tion of funds. 
Let us admit it. Since the House grip 
on the budget is the only hold it has on 
foreign policy, an authorization request is 
the only time when the House can re-
view foreign policy. 
Yet the American people rely on Con-
gress to oversee foreign policy. I am re-
ceiving hundreds of letters about the 
Vietnam crisis. I am sure we all are. 
Unless we are prepared to tell our con-
stituents that they have come to the 
wrong place?that they should write to 
the President instead?we must at some 
point take a stand. This bill is likely 
to be our only chance. 
We are entrusted by our constituents 
to act in this, as in every matter, in their 
interest and in the national interest. 
Today is the third time in 2 years the 
House has been called upon to express 
Itself on our policy in Vietnam. It may 
be the last time. 
THE IMPORTANT DEBATE 
Mr. Chairman, there is a crucial de-
bate raging within the councils of gov-
ernment, and this authorization touches 
the fundamental issues. The important 
debate is not about "withdrawal" or 
"mindless escalation." Nor is it about 
appeasement or bombing China. There 
are no Chamberlains or Hitlers in seats 
of power in this country. 
Mr. Chairman, the U.S. objective in 
Vietnam has not been clear. Most Gov-
ernment officials now agree on one of 
two general objectives, and many of them 
vacillate between the two. One's view 
of what military and diplomatic strategy 
to pursue really depends on which of 
these objectives he believes that the 
United States should seek. 
The general objective sought by one 
view is a limited one: to prevent the Viet-
cong from taking over South Vietnam by 
force, and to end hostilities in such a 
way that ultimately the United States 
can honorably leave the country. Those 
who favor this objective generally argue 
that the United States can and should 
only play a limited role in Asia. They 
believe that a future Vietnamese Govern-
ment would be independent of China, at 
worst a Tito-type situation. Therefore, 
they are not overly troubled by the pros-
pect of a coalition government in Viet-
nam, reflecting the political realities. 
This general view was expressed be-
fore the Senate Foreign Relations Com-
mittee by the distinguished diplomat, 
George Kennan. 
Those who take this line believe the 
Vietcong must be a party to negotiations 
and are prepared to accept an interim 
coalition government. This was the es-
sence of Senator ROBERT F. KENNEDY'S 
statement on February 20. 
Furthermore, those who take this line 
have a military strategy which they be-
lieve will lead to a solution. That strat-
egy is based on the theory that we must 
show Hanoi and the Vietcong that they

4258 Approved For EtimaikpggftwAp laimigNzEnotigf000Ll0005000mh 1, 1966 
cannot win the war. This military strat-
egy has been most clearly outlined by 
Generals Gavin and Ridgeway. Pro-
ponents of this view oppose escalation of 
(Ale war. 
The second general objective has been 
gaining popularity within the adminis-
tration during the past month. It is a 
much wider objective. It holds that the 
United States should help the Saigon 
government to gain control of South 
Vietnam and to carry out an extensive 
pacification plan which will deny the 
Vietcong the allegiance of a significant 
part of the population. Those who urge 
this objective believe that, if South Viet-
nam goes Communist, the whole area of 
southeast Asia will be jeopardized. 
Conversely, they believe that, if the Viet-
cong are decisively defeated, Chinese 
communism will be effectively contained. 
Those who take this view are horrified 
by the thought of an interim coalition 
government?or by the prospect of elec-
tions which the Vietcong might win. 
This is the line of reasoning which, ac-
cording to Senator FULBRIGHT, calls for 
"total victory." It is the doctrine 
espoused by the Secretary of State. Offi-
cials who follow this approach neces-
sarily react very sharply to Senator Roe-
ERT F. KENNEDY'S proposal. 
!Those who take this line have a mili-
tary strategy of their own. They want 
the United States to conduct search-and-
destroy missions?to drive the Vietcong 
out of areas which they now control. 
They then want our troops to "hold" 
these areas, while pacification plans 
proceed. 
This is the strategy proposed by Vice 
President HUMPHREY and Gen. Maxwell 
Taylor. According to General Wheel-
er's testimony before the House Armed 
Services Committee (hearings on H.R. 
12334 and 12335, pp. 4932, 4933, 
4949 ) , this is the strategy of General 
Westmoreland. It calls, of course, for 
a continually increasing U.S. troop com-
mitment. It believes that the U.S. role 
in southeast Asia must be long term, and 
that we will need many bases and supply 
lines. In short, this is a policy of ex-
tended escalation. 
Mr. Chairman, this crucial policy de-
bate may well determine the course of 
0.S. domestic and foreign policy for the 
next decade. It is a debate which Con-
press should not avoid. Otherwise, we 
abdicate our responsibility and con-
tribute to the process by which the Ex-
ecutive determines when and where and 
how to put this Nation to war. 
Mr. Chairman. I am convinced that 
the authorization which we consider this 
afternoon deals directly with the sub-
stanee of this debate. As I will demon-
strate, it is an escalation authorization. 
a my view, it deals directly with policy. 
Iwor it in effect says to the President: 
r-1.1.-e is the money with which to escalate. 
If you do so, it is all right with us. 
Mr. Chairman, it is not all right with 
me. In my view of domestic and inter-
national policy, a wider war is not the 
answer. 
WIPLICAT[ONS OF MINDFUL ESCALATION 
''-i CSC I want to make clear what I 
understand the mindful escalation policy 
to propose. It would impose a military 
solution upon an essentially political 
problem. My understanding of that 
policy comes from reading the transcript 
of the hearings before the House and 
Senate Armed Services Committees, 
reading dispatches from Vietnam in the 
New York Times and Washington Post, 
and listening to the recent speeches and 
comments of President Johnson aid Vice 
President Hu M PHREY 
The object of the policy is to w pc out 
the Vietcong, and to hold huge areas of 
the Vietnam countryside while the 
Saigon government carries on a program 
of pacification. Its pi oponente hope 
that the countryside can be cleared in 2 
or 3 years?through intensive search and 
destroy missions?but they believe that 
the pacification of the countryside may 
take a great many more years of realize. 
Advocates of this escalated policy have 
no illusions about its cost. They know 
that it will take a great many men to 
conduct the search and destroy missions; 
more important, they know that it will 
require a great many more men to hold 
on the countryside once it has been ini-
tially cleared. While it would be nice to 
believe that these tasks can be left to 
the South Vietnamese themselves, advo-
cates of this policy are convinced that 
the countryside cannot be held without 
the presence of American troops in each 
village and hamlet. 
Most of those who urge mindful escala-
tion admit that the cost will he con-
siderable. They are calling for a mini-
mum of 400,000 American troops. Ac-
cording to Hanson Baldwin, writing in 
the New York Times magazine on Sun-
day, February 27, all of the President's 
military advisers agree that more than 
double the present strength is essential. 
Senator STENNIS has said 600,000 men 
may be required. Seymour Topping re-
ported from Saigon in the New York 
Times on .Pebruary 26 that military au-
thorities there expect that during peak 
combat periods there would be at least 
2,000 American casualties per month. 
Mr. Chairman, I am not persuaded by 
these military "experts." I might re-
mind my colleagues that the military 
have been wrong before. It. wae Secre-
tary of Defense MacNamara, who upon 
returning from Vietnam on Oci,ober 2, 
1963, said the major part of American 
forces would be home by Christmas, 1965. 
I do not doubt that America has the 
ability to defeat the Vtetcong and to se-
cure victory for the Saigon government. 
But I am, neither convinced that the 
allies could secure victory according to 
their timetable, nor persuaded that the 
total annihilation of the Vietcong is 
worth the cost to America. 
I have always taken General Mac-
Arthur's crisp comments on a land war 
in Asia most seriously. Senator Cain 
asked General MacArthur whether he 
had told Secretary of State Dull is that: 
Anybody who commits the land power of 
United Stales on the continent of Asia ought 
to have his head. examined. 
MacArthur replied: 
I don't know whether I made the state-
ment, but I confirm absolutely the seltiments 
involved. 
Military situation in the Far East: 
Hearings before the Committee on Armed 
Services and Committee on Foreign Re-
lations, U.S. Senate, 82d Congress, 1st 
session, part 1, page 156. 
I have also been impressed by the study 
which Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway had 
made on the conditions for a land war in 
Indochina while he was the Army's Chief 
of Staff. After reading the full reports 
of the study, General Ridgway con-
cluded: 
We could have fought in Indochina. We 
could have won, i' we had been willing to 
pay the tremendous coat in men and money 
that such intervention would have required--
a cost that in my opinion would have even-
tually been as great as, or greater than, that 
we paid in Korea. (See "Ridgway, Soldier: 
The Memoirs of Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway," 
Harper & Row, 1056) . 
Mr. Chairman, I think it is clear that 
the cost of the policy of mindful escala-
tion may be just as great as the cost, of 
the Korean war. In that war there were 
157,000 casualties, including 54,000 
deaths. 
We have all perhaps read the report 
published last month by Senator MANS-
FIELD upon his return from Vietnam. Its 
conclusions are sobering. We would do 
well to recall them this afternoon. The 
report concluded: 
Despite the great increase in Amuse in 
mil-
itary commitment, it is doubtful in view of 
the acceleration of Vietcong efforts that the 
constricted position now held in Vietnam by 
the Saigon government can continue to be 
held for the indefinite future, let alone ex-
tended without a further augments ,ion of 
American forces on the ground. Indeed, it 
present trends continue, there is no assur-
an.ce as to what ultimate increase in Ameri-
can military commitment will be required 
before the conflict is terminated. For the 
fact is that under present terms of reference 
an.d as the war has evolved, the question is 
not one of applying increased U.S. pressure 
to a defined military situation, but rather 
of pressing against a military situation which 
is, in effect, open ended. 
The Mansfield report, it seems to me, 
makes it indelibly clear that the :A sir can 
be won only by literally multiplying the 
numbers of American troops. It points 
out that, when we began to increase our 
troops after the authorization last May, 
the Vietcong began to supplement their 
forces correspondingly. The report also 
point out that the Vietcong at the pres-
ent time "have the capability of a sub-
stantial increase in their numbers within 
a short period of time." Although an 
estimated 35,000 Vietcong were killed last 
year, their ranks swelled from 103.000 to 
230,000 during that time. At a minimal 
guerrilla ratio of 5 to 1, it would have 
been necessary to recruit 600,000 new 
troops just to keep pace. 
To put the matter more vividly, Secre-
tary of Defense McNamara estimates 
that 4,500 North Vietnamese are infil-
trating South Vietnam each month. To 
keep the current 4-to-1 superiority, it will 
take 20,000 additional troops a month to 
Vietnam. 
A more depressing way of looking at 
these statistics is offered by Prof. Ber-
nard Fall. He points out that the 
traditionally accepted guerrilla ratio?
based on the experience of Malaya and 
the Philippines?is 10 to 1. According to 
U.S. News & World Report for March 7, 
the Vietcong now have 235,700 men.

Thus, an army of more than 2 million 
men would be required to defeat the 
Vietcong. At present the Saigon gov-
ernment has an army of about 570,000 
men, but the manpower pool appears to 
be pretty well depleated. Professor Fall 
doubts that the Saigon government 
could ever field an army of more than 
1 million men. Therefore, to defeat the 
Vietcong, he reasons, the United States 
would be required to send at least a mil-
lion men to fight in Vietnam. 
Mr. Chairman, I am troubled by the 
escalation of this war for yet another 
reason?the threat of Communist 
China. The threat of Chinese interven-
tion must always remain a consideration 
in any review of our role in Vietnam. 
This is the area where our aspiration to 
secure freedom may collide with China's 
ambition to secure protective satellites. 
We must look beyond the conflict in 
Vietnam to the potential collision be-
tween the United States and China . 
Prof. Roger Hilsman, Jr., former As-
sistant Secretary of State for Far East-
ern Affairs, testified before the Sub-
committee on Far Eastern Affairs of the 
House Committee on Foreign Affairs on 
February 1: 
Today Communist China and the United 
States are on a collision course. The out-
come can only be war. 
The cost of war with China, Mr. 
Chairman, would be inestimable. 
Then there is the possibility that in 
the face of mounting casualties the ad-
ministration will have difficulty in resist-
ing increasing pressure to end the land 
war by using ultimate weapons on Hanoi, 
Haiphong, or China. 
Mr. Chairman, these are my concerns 
about a policy of mindful escalation. 
Yet I believe that an analysis of the 
proposed authorization makes it clear 
that continued escalation is precisely 
what is intended. 
AUTHORIZATION FOR ESCALATION 
My study of the bill, hearings, and 
Secretary McNamara's testimony before 
the Senate and House Armed Services 
Committees shows that virtually all of 
the authorization is for procurement of 
aircraft or missiles, and for bases and 
other military construction. The rest is 
for research. No new authorization is 
asked for ammunition or supplies. 
The bill before us is not simply de-
signed to keep the war at the present 
level, but to permit the escalation of the 
war in the discretion of the Executive. 
The largest item in the authorization 
bill is $3.4 billion for procurement of air-
craft and missiles. Almost all of this is 
for the procurement of aircraft and air-
craft parts. This is not simply to re-
place aircraft which have been lost in 
battle. In 1965, 275 fixed-wing aircraft 
and 76 helicopters were lost. According 
to Secretary McNamara, aircraft cost 
less than _$2 million per plane. Thus, 
less than $600 million are needed to re-
plenish the air force. Yet the bill au-
thorizes almost $3 billion for aircraft. 
It is also worth noting that most of 
the lost aircraft were lost in missions 
over North Vietnam. Secretary McNa-
mara estimated that 169 of the 275 
planes were lost over North Vietnam. It 
seems fair to conclude that, if the De-
fense Department expects to lose more 
planes this year than in did last year, 
the losses will result primarily from a 
stepped-up program of bombing in the 
north. 
We should be especially reluctant to 
underwrite such a project. Bombing of 
North Vietnam has neither brought the 
North Vietnamese to the bargaining 
table nor stopped the inflow of men and 
munitions. Indeed, Secretary McNa-
mara estimates that infiltration from the 
north has more than tripled since we 
began the bombing. Senate hearings, 
page 338. It should also be noted that 
the intervention of regiments of the 
North Vietnamese Regular Army came 
about as a result of the bombing which 
was started on February 7, 1965. 
In his testimony before the Senate 
Armed Services Committee Secretary 
McNamara explained at page 132-133 
that the authorization is not just for 
replacement of planes: 
It does include added inventory. 
He explained: 
We are providing for procurement of air-
craft to be added to the force or modernize 
the force, rather than to replace potential 
losses. 
As for helicopters, Secretary Mc-
Namara stated: 
The number of helicopters that we are 
buying far exceeds any number that we are 
likely to lose, and far exceeds any number 
that would be required to modernize units 
in the forces as of July of last year. (Senate 
hearings, p. 191.) 
Besides the procurement of aircraft 
and missiles, the other major request in 
the authorization bill is for military con-
struction; $1.2 billion are requested for 
this purpose. Certainly there is a need 
for increased port facilities and access 
routes to transport supplies to the men 
who are already in Vietnam. Also, hos-
pitals, housing, and community facilities 
are needed. But the bill goes beyond 
this by providing for the construction 
of airfields and ports which will allow 
continued escalation of the war without 
further action by Congress. 
Thus, in explaining the administra-
tion's request for funds, Secretary of De-
fense McNamara said: 
We will be prepared to house and support 
additional units if their deployment should 
be required in the future. (Senate hearings, 
p. 12.) 
Following this theme, the House Com-
mittee on Armed Services Report at page 
16 states that the money is needed "to 
achieve and maintain objectives in 
southeast Asia under present force de-
ployments and to provide a base for aug-
mentation thereof." 
Furthermore, other policy decisions 
appear to be hidden in this authorization 
bill. Only about one-half of the $1.2 
billion request for military construction 
will be spent in South Vietnam; $346 
million will be spent on "other" parts of 
the Asian mainland?presumably in 
Thailand. 
The decision to build new military air-
fields, ports, and facilities in Thailand 
may seem desirable militarily, but it also 
appears to represent a decision to broad-
en the base of the war. Similarly, many 
of the new airfields and ports will be 
built?under this authorization?with 
cement, rather than with temporary 
construction materials such as alumi-
num matting. This would seem to sug-
ges:; a decision to build military ports 
and airfields which will last for a long 
time to come. 
Mr. Chairman, my conclusion that this 
authorization will be considered as con-
gressional approval of mindful escalation 
is drawn largely from the testimony of 
the Secretary of Defense before the 
House and Senate Armed Services Com-
mittees. At one point in the Senate 
hearings, page 105, for example, the 
following exchange took place between 
Secretary McNamara and Senator 
SMITH: 
Senator SMITH. Mr. Secretary, are there 
any plans to escalate and step up the offen-
sive in Vietnam? 
Secretary MCNAIVIARA. Well, there are prep-
arations being made, and they are reflected 
in the fiscal 1966 supplement, for substan-
tially increasing our deployments to South 
Vietnam and raising the rate of activity of 
our air units there. Whether or not we will 
carry out such higher rates of activities and 
actually deploy all of those additional forces 
is a decision that only the President can 
make, and no such decision has yet been 
made. 
Mr. Chairman, I believe that Congress 
should have some voice in the decision 
about whether to escalate this war rather 
than stabilize it. Yet as Secretary Mc-
Namara's statement makes clear, this 
authorization would put that decision 
squarely and solely in the hands of the 
President. 
Mr. Chairman, I think it is important 
to point out that the House Armed Serv-
ices Committee report expresses the com-
mittee's view that there was inconclusive 
evidence that the authorization is neces-
sary for this fiscal year. It states this 
doubt at page 3: 
If there is one reservation felt by many 
members of the committee regarding the 
necessity for this legislation, it arises from 
the possibility that many of the items in-
volved, in all three categories of procurement, 
research and development, and construction 
may simply have been moved from the 
regular 1967 authorization to this supple-
mental 1966 authorization without any real 
program for acceleration. Obviously no 
military advantages would be gained by such 
a bookkeeping situation. Testimony on this 
subject was indecisive and the committee has 
not yet been provided with sufficient defini-
tive data to pinpoint the exact degree of real 
acceleration, or to determine the amounts 
Involved in the proposed legislation which 
could safely and should properly be deferred 
until the regular 1967 authorization. 
I would suggest that the administra-
tion has asked for this authorization for 
yet another reason, not connected with 
military necessities or bookkeeping. It 
wants a congressional authorization 
which it can cite as evidence of approval 
of the strategy of escalation. 
Mr. Chairman, this is not a simple 
authorization to continue the war at its 
present level. We should not pretend 
to ourselves or to the American people 
that it requires no policy judgment on 
our part. This authorization represents 
the administration's decision to make it 
easy to escalate the war in the future.

THE NATURE OF THE COMMITMENT 
There are those who believe that Viet-
nam marks the single great battleground 
of freedom. They argue that we should 
be prepared to send every soldier, every 
plane, and every bomb that we have to 
gain control of that country.. If the 
government of Saigon does not triumph, 
they argue, no country can be assured 
of freedom. 
Mr. Chairman, let us examine the na-
ture of our commitment to Vietnam. 
Until this month, the administration 
argued that it was based on the state-
ments and policies of three American 
Presidents. 
The most. important building block in 
this argument was President Eisenhow-
er's letter to President Diem on October 
23, 1954. The letter said: 
We have been exploring ways and means 
to permit our aid to Vietnam to be more 
effective and to make a greater contribution 
to the welfare and stability of the Govern-
ment a Vietnam. I am, accordingly, in-
structing the American Ambassador to Viet-
nam to examine with you in your capacity 
as Chief of Government, how an intelligent 
program of American aid given directly to 
your Government, can serve to assist Viet-
nam in its present hour of trial, provided 
that your Government is prepared to give 
assurances as to the standards of perform-
ance it would be able to maintain in the 
event such aid were supplied. 
The purpose of this offer is to assist the 
Government of Vietnam in developing and 
maintaining a strong, viable state, capable 
of resisting attempted subversion or aggres-
sion through military means. The Govern-
ment of the United States expects that this 
dC will be met by performance on the part 
o( the Government of Vietnam in undertak-
ing needed reforms. It hopes that such aid, 
combined with your own continuing efforts, 
will contribute effectively toward an inde-
pendent Vietnam endowed with a strong 
Government. Such a government would, I 
hope, be so responsive to the nationalist 
aspirations of its people, so enlightened in 
Purpose and effective in performance, that 
it will be respected both at home and abroad 
and discourage anyone who might wish to 
impose a foreign ideology on your free people. 
For a while the administration main-
timed that our military commitment 
stemmed from this letter. But that argu-
ment has since been discredited. It was 
Oral, deflated in a 1965 essay by Arthur 
Larson, who was Director of the U.S. In-
telligence Agency under President Eisen-
hower. Larson goes through the lette:r 
sentence by sentence and concludes: 
The nearest thing to a commitment at this 
atage was an indicated willingness, subject 
to some stiff (and as yet unsatisfied) condi-
tions and understandings, to provide eco-
nomic and technical assistance, including 
military advisers, material, and training" 
(Larson, "Vietnam and Beyond.") 
Then, on August 17, 1965, President 
Eisenhower settled the question sur-
rounding his letter once and for all. 
We said we would help that country?
lie said--
We were not talking about military programs, 
but about aid. (See Max Frankel's article 
-Military Pledge Is Denied by Eisenhower," 
New York Times, Aug. 18, 1965.) 
After President Eisenhower refused to 
accept responsibility for our military in-
volvement, the administration turned to 
a treaty and congressional declarations 
to explain the root of our commitment. 
It pointed to the SEATO Treaty and two 
principal actions of the Congress?the 
Gulf of Tonkin resolution of August 1964 
and the $700 million supplemental ap-
propriation for military activities in 
southeast Asia which passed the House 
on May 5, 1965. 
In his testimony before the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee, Secretary 
Rusk said on February 18 that our com-
mitment to Vietnam grew out of SEATO. 
"It is this fundamental SEATO obliga-
tion that has from the outset guided our 
actions in South Vie'inam," he said. 
However, our obligation under SEATO 
is clearly limited under the treaty. In 
the first place, the testimony, Senate re-
port, and Senate debate which sur-
rounded the passage in 1954 of the 
Southeast Asia Treaty make it clear that 
instances of Communist subversion, in-
spired from without, were to be treated 
under article IV paragraph 2 of the treaty 
which says: 
Tf, in the opinion of any of the parties, 
the inviolability or the integrity cf the ter-
ritory or the sovereignty or political inde-
pendence of any party in the treaty area or 
of any other state or territory to which the 
provisions of paragraph 1 of this article from 
time to time apply is threatened in any way 
other than by armed attack or is affected 
or threatened by any fact or situa-
tion which might endanger the peace 
of the area, the parties shall consult imme-
diately in order to agree on the measures 
which should be taken for the common de-
fense. 
Instead, Secretary :Rusk relies upon 
article en. paragraph 1.? which says: 
Each party recognizes that aggression by 
means of armed attack in the treaty area 
against any of the parties or against any 
state or territory which the parties by unani-
mous agreement may hereafter designate, 
would endanger its own peace and safety, 
and agrees that it will in that event act 
to meet the common clanger in accordance 
with its constitutional processes. Measures 
taken, under this paragraph shall be immedi-
ately reported to the Security Cott mil of the 
United Nations. 
Even if paragraph 1 of article IV were 
applicable, the nature of our obligation 
to Vietnam would be limited. 
As Secretary of State John Foster 
Dulles told the Senate Foreign Mations 
Committee at page 14 of the Senate hear-
ings on the treaty: 
We made clear at Manila that :1: was not 
the intention of the United States to build 
up a large local force including, for example, 
U.S.. ground troops for that area, but that 
we rely noon deterrent power of our mobile 
striking force. 
It was apparent to the signers of the 
treaty, ta the Eisenhower administra-
tion, and to the U.S. Senate that the 
treaty did not involve any promise to 
commit American ground troops to Asia. 
Senator Alexander Smith, one of the two 
U.S. Senators to accompany Mr. Dulles 
to the treaty conference in Manila, em-
phasized this point in the debate on the 
Senate floor. 
Senator Smith said: 
The great contribution which this country 
is capable of making to the defense of south-
east Asia in the event of an act of open 
aggression would be, as Secretary Dulles has 
said, to strike at the source of aggression 
rather than to rush American manpower into 
the area to try to fight a ground war. We 
have no purpose of following any such policy 
as that of having our forces involved in a 
ground war. (CO.NGRESSIONAL RECI /1E, 84th 
Cong., 1st sess., p. 103.) 
Article IV paragraph 1 is only opera-
tive in the event of an open armed at-
tack. If such an attack should occur, 
each state agrees to "act to meet the 
common danger in accordance with its 
constitutional processes." This provi-
sion helped to assuage the doubts of a 
Congress which was troubled that the 
Korean war had been fought without, a 
declaration of war. It make it clear that 
the treaty signatories are not bound to 
take any action without going through 
the appropriate constitutional channels. 
Thus, the President of the United States 
is obligated to consult Congress before 
meeting the obligations of the treaty. 
Moreover, the treaty requires that 
"Measures taken under this paragraph 
shall 'be immediately reported to the Se-
curity Council of the United Nations." 
Yet, if we accept Secretary Rusk's con-
tention that we have been acting in 
Vietnam under this treaty since 1954, we 
should recognize that for the first decade 
we were violating the treaty by not re-
porting the measures taken to the 
Security Council. 
The framers of the SEATO treaty did 
not contemplate our involvement in an 
Asian land war, and we have not acted 
in accord with the provisions of the 
treaty. SEATO should not be consid-
ered the source of our increasing com-
mitment in Vietnam. 
President Johnson has also often 
said that our commitment to Vietnam 
was sealed by the Gulf of Tonkin. resolu-
tion. 
However, the Gulf of Tonkin resolu-
tion in August of 1964 did not contem-
plate extending the war to North Viet-
nam, nor the landing of large American 
armies in Vietnam. 
That resolution is cited as the legal 
basis although before it was ad ipted in 
the House and Senate the Senate debate 
made it clear that the resolution was an 
affirmation of the then existine policy. 
Senator FULERIGHT, in making the leg-
islative history of that resolution, had 
the following exchange with Senator 
MCGOVERN: 
Senator McGOVERN. Does the Sena tor 
think there is any danger in this resolution 
that we may be surrendering to General 
Khanh's position as to where the war should 
be fought? (General Khanh had ad vocateci 
attacking North Vietnam.) 
Senator FULBRICHT. I do not thi Ilk there 
Is any danger of that. * * * I do not think 
the policy that the war be confined to South 
Vietnam has changed. I think it is still the 
policy .I think it is the correct one. 
Later in the debate, Senator BREW-
STER asked: 
So my question is whether 'there is any-
thing in the resolution which would au-
thorize or recommend or approve the land-
ing of large American armies in Vietnam or 
in China. 
Senator FULBRIGHT replied: 
There is nothing in the resoluta:in, as I 
read it, that contemplates it.

Senator FtiLBRIGHT during the debate 
also said: 
I personally feel it would be very unwise 
under any circumstances to put a large land 
army on the Asian Continent. 
Mr. Chairman, in my view the policy 
pursued in Vietnam was not contem-
plated by the resolution of August 1964. 
Last May 5 the administration asked 
House approval of a supplemental ap-
propriation of $700 million for military 
activities in southeast Asia not because 
the appropriation was necessary but be-
cause the administration candidly 
sought congressional approval for a new 
departure in policy. 
No longer was the United States aid-
ing the South Vietnamese to fight their 
own war. The United States was fight-
ing the war. I voted against that bill 
because I was not willing to vote ap-
proval of the decision to convert the 
conflict into an American war. The 
administration had not defined its ob-
jectives, and there had been no congres-
sional debate. 
On May 5 there were 34,000 American 
Armed Forces personnel in South Viet-
nam. Today there are 210,000 and 6 
divisions. 
The war has indeed escalated, and the 
administration cites the $700 million 
supplemental appropriation vote of 
May 5 as another legal basis for our 
commitment as well as one of the bricks 
in the arch of congressional support. 
Let there be no mistake about it. 
Today's vote will be similarly construed. 
Mr. Chairman, there is yet a third ex-
planation for our commitment to Viet-
nam?one which invokes American his-
tory and evokes America's idealism. In 
his speech at Freedom House on Febru-
ary 23, President Johnson appealed to 
the traditional American devotion to lib-
erty. We are in Vietnam, he said, to 
"keep the faith for freedom." 
In his speech last week, President 
Johnson recalled President Roosevelt's 
four freedoms. Freedom of speech, free-
dom of religion, freedom from want, and 
freedom from fear. I agree that we are 
dedicated to these freedoms at home and 
abroad. But our commitment is no less 
great in Paraguay, Spain, or Southern 
Rhodesia than it is in South Vietnam. 
Do we not have as strong a moral respon-
sibility to "keep the faith for freedom" 
for the people of Cuba and Hungary as 
for the people of Indochina? 
In these cases the United States has 
recognized that it cannot join the bat-
tles of every nation in the world. We 
should send economic aid; we should ex-
ert diplomatic and economic pressure; 
we should set a personal example; we 
should strengthen the United Nations; 
but we cannot commit ourselves to fight 
an unlimited military war in every case 
of injustice. 
Our friends around the world recog-
nize that no matter how great our love 
for freedom, our resources are not omni-
potent. They know that we are pre-
pared to use our full resources to stop 
armed aggression, as in Berlin, and to 
defend ourselves against a nuclear threat, 
as in Cuba. However, they do not expect 
us to devote all of our resources to the 
battle in Vietnam. Many of the world's 
leading diplomats no doubt share the 
view of George Kennan, the distinguished 
former Ambassador to Yugoslavia and 
the Soviet Union: 
Not only are great and potentially more 
important questions of world affairs not re-
ceiving as a consequence of our preoccupa-
tion with Vietnam, the attention they should 
be receiving, but in some instances assets we 
already enjoy, and hopeful possibilities we 
should be developing, are being sacrificed to 
this unpromising involvement in a remote 
and secondary theater of activity. 
Most of the world's leaders seem to be 
baffled and distressed?rather than 
heartened?by our increasing involve-
ment in Vietnam. 
Whatever the nature of the commit-
ment may be, we are clearly not obligated 
to pursue a policy of continued escalation 
which involves a full-scale land war on 
the Asian mainland. 
ALTERNATIVES TO ESCALATION 
Mr. Chairman, there are realistic al-
ternatives to the extended escalation 
policy implicit in this bill, and they 
should be considered before we embark 
upon a wider war. 
I want to make it clear that I do not 
consider pulling out to be an acceptable 
course of action. The damaging effect 
of withdrawal upon our prestige and our 
relations with other countries of south-
east Asia and our allies elsewhere would 
be severe. The consequences for Cam-
bodia and Thailand must be recognized. 
We are past the point of unilateral with-
drawal even if it would have been sensi-
ble?which I do not suggest. 
The decision has been made without 
being formally made. We do have a 
pledge to the freedom of the people of 
South Vietnam and their right to freely 
choose their own government. However, 
within the framework of that pledge, 
there are reasonable and honorable al-
ternatives. 
In past speeches before the House, I 
have made specific proposals for a diplo-
matic resolution of the conflict. I be-
lieved they were meritorious when I out-
lined them on June 10, 1964, and again 
on February 24, 1965. 
Although conditions have changed and 
we have Americanized the war, I still be-
lieve they should be pursued. 
They should be explored in a stabilized 
situation, not an intensified war. If we 
follow what might be called the Gavin-
Kennan-Fulbright-Hilsman plan, we can 
hold Saigon, the provincial capitals, and 
our own bases, while we support the 
South Vietnamese as long as they are 
willing to carry forward counterguerrilla 
warfare and programs of economic and 
social reform. 
This would bring about a deescalation 
of our military involvement in South 
Vietnam which should be accompanied 
by a cessation of :the bombing in North 
Vietnam. While pursuing this military 
strategy, we should continue to press for 
negotiations. 
Mr. Chairman, I have consistently said 
that the conflict in Vietnam was not sus-
ceptible to a wholly military solution?
that it would be won not on the battle-
field but in battle for men's minds, that 
the Government must win the confidence 
of the people, that we could help with 
support?but that our power must be ex-
ercised in a supporting role for the bene-
fit of the underdeveloped peoples. We 
must assist development, not insist on 
domination. 
This raises the whole question of our 
intervention policy, whether in ViOtnam 
or Santo Domingo or in any one of the 
40-odd nations with which Dean Rusk 
reminded us we have treaty obligations. 
Of course, we cannot withdraw from the 
world. Neither neoisolationism nor the 
doctrine of military might should guide 
our actions. George Kennan said at 
hearings of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee on February 10 that we 
should not be asked "to shoulder the 
main burden of determining the political 
realities in any other country." The ad-
ministration has sought to create a vital 
interest where there was a stake but not 
a life or death embrace. 
Mr. Chairman, our obligation to the 
freedom of the South Vietnamese did not 
require nor commend increasing escala-
tion and a further influx of American 
combat troops. Rather it commended 
to us a search for political and diplo-
matic alternatives. In the interest of 
aiding that search, eight of us sponsored 
on January 21 and 22, a conference of 
experts and scholars to examine and 
analyze the situation in Vietnam, pre-
pare realistic proposals to facilitate a 
negotiated settlement and to project the 
framework of a creative Far Eastern for-
eign policy. 
The report of the ad hoc Congres-
sional Conference on Vietnam was issued 
on February 15, 1966. Our colleague, the 
gentleman from New York [Mr. ROSEN-
THAL], deserves our commendation for 
his initiative in this project. While I do 
not necessarily subscribe to all of the 
conclusions and recommendations in 
that report, I believe they point to the 
general direction our policy should take. 
Therefore, I include the foreword and 
the conference recommendations at this 
point in the RECORD: 
AD HOC CONGRESSIONAL CONFERENCE ON 
VIETNAM 
FOREWORD 
On January 21 and 22, 1966, a group of 
experts and scholars met in Washington at 
the invitation of eight Members of the House 
of Representatives to analyze the current 
situation in Vietnam and prepare realistic 
proposals to help end the war and facilitate 
a negotiated settlement. 
The sponsoring Congressmen have felt un-
satisfied with the recent role of Congress in 
foreign affairs. They believe their office re-
quires a more fundamental examination of 
foreign policy than that allowed by even the 
most careful consideration of specific legis-
lation. The sponsors are convinced that the 
level of congressional analysis can be raised 
through greater intimacy between the legis-
lative branch and the intellectual and uni-
versity community. It was with this in mind 
that they invited to Washington a group of 
experts particularly qualified to discuss with 
them Vietnam and its implications for Amer-
ican diplomacy. 
Some of the participants have spent con-
siderable time in Vietnam, and have obtained 
intimate association with conditions there. 
Others offered the important perspectives of 
experience in negotiation, study of eco-
nomics, diplomacy or international law, or

expert knowledge of relevidit geographical 
areas. 
ll'articipants were requested not to dwell 
on episodes. or errors of the past. Instead, 
they were asked to discuss present policies 
and possible alternatives to them; to analyze 
the problems involved in reaching and en-
forcing a settlement in Vietnam; and to pro-
ject the outlines of a creative American pol-
icy toward Asia. 
Certain conclusions and recommendations 
emerged in the discussions and these are 
:aided explicitly at the beginning of the re-
port. The subsequent summary of the dis-
sex E Si011 S also includes some individual points 
which contributed to the analysis, although 
they were not unanimously endorsed. 
The sponsors regard the proposals made by 
the conference as important contributions to 
their own thinking about Vietnam and the 
formulation of American foreign policy. 
They feel the report deserves the attention 
of their congressional colleagues, members of 
I,he executive branch, and the American 
people. Finally, they view the conference 
as having set an important precedent for 
fixture congressional initiatives in foreign 
affairs. 
N NICE RECOMMENDATIONS 
The Conference reached the recommenda-
tions and conclusions set out below. A sum-
mary of the discussions from which they 
were developed follows. 
Vrcsent strategies 
1. There are diplomatic alternatives, not 
yet fully explored, to continued military 
eocalation of the war in Vietnam. 
7. Continued bombing of North Vietnam 
is not in the American interest either in 
shortening the war or in improving prospects 
for a negotiated settlement. 
3. There should be no further escalation 
of American troop commitment. There are 
serious risks of inviting greater North Viet-
namese and Chinese activity. 
4_ Unilateral withdrawal of all American 
troops prior to a cease fire or peace confer-
ence is not in our national interest. 
how policy initiatives 
5. The most productive course for the 
future h; a deescalation of military activity 
and commitment. 
6. The National Liberation Front must be 
recognized as a principal belligerent in the 
war, and as a necessary party to any peace 
conference and settlement. 
7. To improve the likelihood of negotia-
tions, the Saigon government should be 
broadened to include representatives less 
:hostile to negotiations. 
6. The United States must help promote 
greater contact between all South Vietna-
mese factions--representatives of the Na-
tiinril Liberation Front, the Saigon govern-
ment, and influential private citizens. 
Negotiations and the convening of a 
conference 
.). The difference between the several ne-
gotiating positions is not insurmountable. 
The United States might agree to Hanoi's 
four points, treating them as one interpreta-
tion of the 1954 agreement and thus an ap-
propriate basis for negotiations. The con-
troversial point three of the Hanoi program 
would then he a subject for subsequent dis-
eixesion rather than prior approval. 
ia. The 1954 Geneva Conference should be 
reconvened with all parties to the hostilities 
represented. 
1 le A procedure for reconvening the Ge-
neve Conference would be to have the three 
nations on the international Control Com-
mission (Canada, India, Poland) request a 
conference to receive new instructions on 
enforcement of the 1954 agreements. 
17. The inability of the United Nations 
thus far to use Its good offices to help end 
the Vietnam war dramatizes the urgency of 
including China as a full member of that 
institution. Despite the difficulties of in-
volving the U.N. in a se Alement of the war, 
all parties should seek opportunities to 
utilize the United Nations in appropriate 
ways. 
Terms of a settlement' 
13. A cease-fire must be secured. Given 
the dispersed. nature of the conflist, a cease-
fire might be more easily reached at a con-
ference, though the possibility of a prior 
cessation of hostilities should be explored 
carefully. 
14. Agrimmcnt must be reached on a pro-
visional government in South Vietnam and 
procedures for the holding of elections to 
form a ccuistiment assembly. A la-ovisional 
government might be established on the ba-
sis of geographical areas contrtiled, with 
contested areas to be administered tempo-
rarily by ihe International Contrel Commis-
sion. Alternatively, decisions regarding such. 
a government could be reached by prior ne-
gotiations between all parties in the south. 
15. All parties moist firmly adhere to the 
results of free elections. 
16. Amnesty must be cranted I'm all par-
ties in the conflict. 
17. Guarani:33es of the cease-fire, the provi-
sional government, free elections, troop with-
drawals, amnesty, and neutralizatien must be 
enforced by an effective International Con-
trol Commission. The International Control 
Commission must, therefore, be sienificantly 
strengthened. United Nations participation 
in this pr :mess might reduce adrxenistrative 
difficulties and set precedent far future 
United Nations participation in the solution 
of other civil conflicts threatening world 
peace. 
lb. A settlement should assure the neu-
tralization of the two zones of Vietnam, Laos, 
and Cambodia. Arms control aereements 
must be reached applying to other nations 
of the area, prescribing their nonparticipa-
tion in military alliances, the freedom of 
their territory for foreign military hates, and 
their protection from outside arms, material, 
and armed personnel infiltration. 
Mr. Chairman, these 13 points by no 
means exhaust the possibilities for nego-
tiations. Rather, they indicate the di-
rection in which our policy should, in my 
view, be directed. Unfortunately, our 
policy does not now appear to be headed 
In this direction. During the oause in 
the bombing in December and January 
the administration appeared genuinely 
to seek negotiations. There war, no ap-
parent response from Hanoi to the Pres-
ident's peace offensive, and the adminis-
tration appears to doubt the possibility of 
negotiations. 
But this Nation should never abandon 
the search for peace. We should never 
abandon ourselves to all-out war. We 
are not only the strongest nation on 
earth, we are the most ingenious. We 
have an unflinching belief in the law, and 
we have a great tradition of domestic 
Peace preserved by the law. It is in this 
tradition that II have a great belief in the 
possibility of world peace through world 
law. Or, more precisely, I believe that 
world law is our only hope for world 
peace. 
It was with this faith in international 
law that the United Nations was founded 
some 20 years ago. It was founded by 
men who had learned a lesson far more 
profound than the lesson of Munich or 
Manchuria or Ethiopia. They had 
learned the lesson of London, of Berlin, 
of Paris, of Hiroshima. They had 
learned that while wars can be won, they 
are never an answer. They provide no 
answer for the hundreds of thousands 
who are injured, made homeless, killed. 
The lesson of the Second World War was 
the need for a world order and interna-
tional law. 
But we seem to have forgotten that 
lesson in the war we fight today. We 
should have taken this dispute to the 
United Nations the moment it arose. 
We should have taken it to the Security 
Council. If the Soviet Union blocked us 
there, we should have gone to the Gen-
eral Assembly. There is a good case to 
be made against the Vietcong. That 
was the place to make it. 
Mr. Chairman, I cannot believe that 
it is now too late to bring tile United Na-
tions into this dispute. Finally, last 
month, we took the matter to the Se-
curity Council. They decided not to act. 
Now we should be prepared to take it to 
the General Assembly. 
There are those, I know, who say that 
the United Nations is too weak to handle 
this war. If it should try to handle this 
war, and fail, says the argument, then 
the United Nations will be damaged, per-
haps permanently. 
But, consider the damage which fol-
lows from not taking this issue to the 
United Nations. In effect, we are saying 
to the world:- The United Nations can-
not handle major disputes. Mr. Chair-
man, need I remind this body that the 
United Nations was founded precisely to 
handle major disputes. If we embark 
on a major war on the Asian mainland, 
and bypass the United Nations, we throw 
away the lessons of the last war, and dis-
card the hope of our fathers. 
It is often said that each new irenera-
tion must learn its lessons anew. I pray 
that that maxim will not prove true cf 
the lessons of total war. 
At the outset of this speech, Mr. Chair-
man, I said that a great debate is now 
raging about which of two objectives 
this Nation should pursue in Vietnam ? 
a negotiated settlement or "total vic-
tory." In all candor I must confess that 
the debate appears to be being won by 
those who ask "why not total victory?" 
This objective will be sought through 
a policy of mindful escalation. Its pro-
ponents will elevate the America:1i troop 
commitment slowly, gradually condition-
ing the American people. They are 
mindful of the domestic consequences 
which might follow full mobilization. 
Its proponents will also be selective in 
their bombing of North Vietnam. They 
are mindful of the danger of an all-out 
war with North Vietnam, or beyond that, 
with China. 
Mr. Chairman, those of us who urge 
stabilization of the war are also mindful 
of the effects of escalation. We are 
mindful of the domestic effects and the 
international effects. We should accept 
the challenge of the generals and explain 
why not total victory. 
Mr. Chairman, I do not doubt that 
America can win this war if we are will-
ing to pay the price. If we are willing 
to sacrifice American lives and Viet-
namese lives, to sacrifice the poverty pro-
gram at home, to sacrifice a treaty ban-
ning nuclear proliferation. But is this 
in our national interest? Is it in the in-
terest of world peace and the rule of law?

Do we not have an obligation to the U.N. 
Charter which requires that threats to 
the peace be dealt with by that interna-
tional organization? We are not dis-
cussing Munich. We are discusing Laos; 
we are discussing Algeria. Each of those 
conflicts ended with a compromise set-
tlernent, a negotiated peace. That 
should be our goal in Vietnam. 
But instead, the administration's 
policy is now swayed by those who coun-
cil us to abandon ourselves to the 
great game of war. We can win it they 
urge, so let us. Mr. Chairman, it is hard 
to resist this temptation, I am sure. But 
that is the role of statesmen and politi-
cians. When generals council victory, 
We must council peace. 
Mr. Chairman, when I vote on this 
measure it will be with a heavy heart. 
I know that few in this body will vote 
with me, and I do not lightly disagree 
with my President and my party. 
This has not been an easy decision for 
me to make. In fact, it has caused me 
more soul searching than any vote I have 
cast in 6 years in this House. I yield to 
no one in my devotion to my country. I 
yield to no one in my respect and admira-
tion for the qualities of courage, dedica-
tion, and patriotism of the American 
soldier. He performs miraculously in 
battle regardless of the conditions under 
which he fights. I know something of 
what he is experiencing in Vietnam to-
day, for 20 years ago I too fought a jungle 
war in the Pacific. I hoped then, as my 
father did before me in the Meuse-Ar-
gonne almost 50 years ago, and as my 
brother did after me in Korea, that 
thereafter disputes among nations could 
be settled through international law. 
I fully recognize that war is still an 
instrument of national policy. It is used 
today in Vietnam where we are at war 
without a declaration of war. If war 
were declared by Congress, the situation 
might be different. But today on the 
basis of the record I am unwilling to 
ratify with my vote an authorization 
which will be interpreted as the sanction 
for greater escalation of our military 
commitment. 
It will be accepted as the third brick 
in 2 years in the arch of congressional 
support for a policy which may well lead 
to world war III. 
Imbedded in this authorization are far 
reaching questions about how the United 
States should relate to the developing 
world and the social, political, and mil-
itary revolutions in that world, about 
our relations with the Soviet Union, 
about our approach to China which is 
the key to peace in Asia. 
Mr. Chairman, now is the time to re-
assess our policy and find an honorable, 
diplomatic resolution of the Vietnam 
conflict and then build a viable policy 
in the Far East. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield myself as much time 
as I may require. 
Mr. Chairman, at the outset I want 
to say that I totally, unequivocally, inter-
nally, and eternally, disagree with the 
position of the gentleman who has just 
preceded me. This bill, the title of which 
I have react in asking for the House to go 
into the Committee of the Whole House 
on the State of the Union, is for the pur-
pose of providing the needed equipment 
and bases for our boys in southeast Asia. 
The bill, as I have said, is supplemental 
to fiscal 1966 for procurement authoriza-
tion and is directed entirely to the sup-
port of- these men in this part of the 
world. 
I would like to state at the outset that 
regardless of the debate that is raging 
in other places in the area known as 
Washington, D.C., one thing is crystal 
clear to MENDEL RIVERS, a Representa-
tive from South Carolina; namely, our 
soldiers, our sailors, our marines, our 
airmen, our Coast Guardsmen, are in 
southeast Asia. Most of these men are 
in Vietnam and,' for your information, 
that number exceeds 250,000. They need 
your support, they need facilities, and 
weapons. The passage of this bill is your 
expression to your fighting men in this 
part of the world, mostly Vietnam, and 
to the American public and to the world 
that we intend to support our forces in 
every possible way. 
The bill we have for consideration 
today is H.R. 12889 which authorizes sup-
plemental appropriations during fiscal 
year 1966 for the procurement of aircraft, 
missiles, tracked combat vehicles, re-
search and development and military 
construction for the Armed Forces. 
For my part, I do not need to know 
anything more than what I have just 
stated. Your flesh and blood are far 
away?today they need your support?
they are dying for you and for me. 
Let me describe the bill briefly for you. 
The Department of Defense submitted 
two separate bills, one for procurement 
and research and development, and the 
other for military construction. We 
combined these two bills for the simple 
reason that they both constitute a part of 
the same program and it was felt that 
dealing with the whole matter at one 
time was proper for all concerned. 
This bill contains authorization for 
appropriation as follows: 
Procurement  
$3, 
417, 
700, 000 
Research, development, test, 
and evaluation  
151, 
650, 000 
Military construction  
1, 
288, 
100,000 
Total  
4, 
857, 
450, 000 
I will draw your attention to three 
tables on page 5 of the report which set 
out, very clearly, the authorizations and 
appropriations for fiscal year 1966 in the 
first two columns and in the third col-
umn, the additions which will be made 
by this bill. The amounts for aircraft, 
missiles, and so forth, are set out in 
money amounts. I will not recite all of 
the details that appears on these three 
tables. It is all set out there in clear, 
factual fashion. 
In virtually every respect this bill is 
exactly like those which you have con-
sidered in the past, and merely repre-
sents more of the same. There are two 
differences, however, that I would like to 
point out. First there are no naval ves-
sels in this bill as there always have been 
in the regular programs; and second, for 
the first time the bill contains authority 
for tracked combat vehicles. We 
amended the law last year to include the 
requirement that these items be specifi-
cally authorized. But other than that 
there is nothing new. 
PROCUREMENT 
On page 6 of the report you will see 
that the Army will receive at total of 
$965,400,000 broken down into aircraft, 
missiles, and tracked combat vehicles. 
Each aircraft, missile, and tracked com-
bat vehicle is named and described. For 
obvious reasons, numbers are not given 
but you may be sure that if any Member 
of the House wishes to have that kind 
of detail I will be very glad to furnish 
it with the understanding that it is 
classified material. 
On page 9 of the report you will see 
that the Navy and Marine Corps will 
receive $802,900,000. This again is 
broken down in the same fashion?and 
on page 11 it will be seen that the Air 
Force will receive $1,649,400,000, in this 
case broken down only into aircraft and 
missiles. In all these instances each of 
the items is named and described. 
A matter of particular note, I think, 
is that of the $3.4 billion representing 
procurement in this bill, a little over $3.1 
billion is for aircraft and the reason for 
this is quite simple. Mr. McNamara tes-
tified that: 
Although the aircraft loss rate continues 
low, the rapidly increasing number of sorties 
Is resulting in larger total losses. In 1961, 
we lost 38 fixed-wing aircraft and 24 heli-
copters to hostile action. 
In 1965, with both the very large increase 
in activity and the attacks against North 
Vietnam, we lost 275 fixed-wing aircraft and 
76 helicopters. We anticipate that 1966 
losses will be somewhat higher. 
A total of about $1.8 billion for the re-
placement of aircraft losses is included in 
the fiscal year 1966 supplemental. Another 
$168 million is included for the Army to 
equip new aviation units. 
The considerably higher rates of utiliza-
tion of many types of aircraft in all the 
services will also increase the consumption 
of spares. For example, Air Force taCtical air-
craft in Vietnam are now flying 60 percent 
more hours per month than they normally 
do in peacetime. And you may recall that 
I mentioned last August, we were increasing 
the utilization rate of Military Airlift Com-
mand aircraft also by about 60 percent. Ac-
cordingly, we have included in the fiscal year 
1966 supplemental about $1.2 billion for air-
craft spares and other aircraft equipment for 
all the services. 
I will now go to "Research and devel-
opment." 
The amount in this bill for research 
and development is very small. Nor-
mally, in the regular programs, research 
and development comes to almost half 
of the total bill. Here the sum of $151,-
650,000 represents only about 3 percent 
of the bill. The reason for this is evident 
in that the weapons that the men are 
fighting with and will fight with are the 
result of research and development car-
ried on in the past. Actually the funds 
in this supplement will be used in every 
instance to accelerate development proj-
ects of particular interest to our opera-
tions in southeast Asia. 
On pages 13 through 15 of the com-
mittee report there is set out consider-
able detail as to the research and devel-
?Pent programs which are contained in 
this bill. 
Perhaps one of the most important 
items is a very much intensified program 
Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67600446R000400050008-5 
A celnli Approved For RtmatMfggliCdalM67_130a46r,R00400050008-11arch 19(;e; 
to !grid a cure for a partieularly virulent 
strain of malaria. Another important 
item relates to field medical treatment 
facilities and equipment. Others are an 
aingraf t photo flasher system for night 
photography?and acceleration of the 
frozen blood program to provide backup 
for the blood bank system. 
ITAR Y CONSTRUCTION 
he 'Military construction" portion of 
the report begins on page 16. It will be 
seen there that the total program is $1,-
2138,100,000, On pages 17 and 18 are set 
out; in quite considerable detail the_ areas 
in which the construction will be carried 
on and the amounts involved. 
I; is in the military construction por-
tion of the bill that there is the only 
monetary addition made by the com-
mittee. The committee added $49.7 mil-
lion. This addition covers two items--
the construction of a jet-capable field in 
Okinawa for the Marines, and ship re-
pair facilities in the Philippines for the 
Navy. These were found to be very 
irn-
portant projects which had not been in-
cluded in the program but which after 
its submission were approved by the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff. 
While on the subject of "Military con-
struction," I should point out another 
amendment made by the committee. 
This appears as subsection 401(b) on 
page 5 of the bill. It is also set out on 
page 2 of the report. 
Under this amendment, the Secretary 
of Defense is required to furnish to the 
Armed Services Committees a description 
of each military construction project, 
"together with full and complete justifi-
cation therefor, including a. cost analysis 
thereof, prior to the execution of any 
contract for the establishment or devel-
opment of a military installation or 
facility." 
The reason for this amendment is the 
fact that the committee was concerned 
over the lack of preciseness in the "Mili-
tary construction" request. 
As the report states: 
While providing sufficient latitude to the 
Department to construct necessary facilities, 
the committee felt that it should receive 
Information prior to the contract execu-
tion ?-
Relating to these projects. 
The committee does not mean to infer 
by this amendment that it doubts the 
need for these construction projects. 
The committee is anxious, however, to 
avoid giving the Department of Defense 
anything like a "blank check." 
Obviously it is difficult to plan con-
struction in an area some of which is in 
an actual combat condition. I would be 
leas than frank if I did not tell you that 
some of these facilities described on 
pages 17 and 18 of the report may never 
lie built, or, if built, not in the locations 
which appear in the secret backup ma-
terial. The progress of the war and 
many other considerations will dictate 
the actual course to be followed. 
Me. Chairman, that is the bill. 
Let me repeat what I said at the out-
set?that while I have very strong per-
sonal feelings about the war in Vietnam 
and nave expressed myself frequently on 
this subject, I feel that these considera-
tions have very little to do with this bill 
and its passage. 
Our men are in Vietnam. They need 
our support and our help. Passage of 
this bill is that support and that help. 
Let the debate as to whether we should 
be in Vietnam, or how we should conduct 
the war in Vietnam, be carried on at 
another time. I will join in such debate. 
This is not the time for that debate. 
This is the time for only one thing?and 
that is to vote our fighting men the 
weapons that they need. 
Me. FARBS1EIN. Mr. Chairman, will 
the gentleman yield just for a moment? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. I 
yield to the gentleman for just one 
moment. 
Mr. FARBSTEIN. This bill also in-
cludes appropriations for housing, hos-
pitals, doctors, food, and clothing for 
our Armed Forces; does it not? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. This 
bill and the rest of the supplemental 
together, yes. That is absolutely right. 
You cannot light a we r without taking 
care of such necessary things as that. 
Mr. FA RBS rEIN. I thank the gentle-
man from South Carolina. 
Mr. RYAN.. Mr. Chairman, will the 
gentleman yield for a question? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. I am 
delighted to yield to the gentleman from 
New York. 
Mr. RYAN.. Mr. Chairman, is. this not 
a supplemental authorization bill for the 
fiscal year 1966? 
Mr, nivERs of South Carolina.. That 
is right. 
Mr. RYAN. Did I understand the 
gentleman to say that he had been as-
sured by Secretary of Defense McNamara 
that our boys had everything they need 
and that there were no shortages? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. "Pos-
itively," I said. 
Mr. RYAN. Will the gentleman ex-
plain where in this bill there is an au-
thorization for money for clothing? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. For 
clothing? 
Mr. RYAN. For clothing. 
M:r. RIVERS of South Carolina. For 
the gentleman's information, we do not 
authorize clothing. We authorize weap-
ons systems, implement; of war. Cloth-
ing comes under housekeeping. It is a 
continuing appropriation, and ihe Ap-
propriations Committee has exclusive 
jurisdiction on that. They prcvide an 
awful lot of clothing. I knew you will 
be delighted to hear we have all the 
clothing we need, and we are getting 
along like a million dollars. 
Mr. RYAN.. I thank the gentleman. 
May I ask another question? Where in 
this bill is there an authorization for 
money for food? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. That 
is not in this bill. 
Mr. RYAN. Then I take it the gentle-
man did not intend, In answering the 
question of the gentleman from New 
York Mr. FARBSTEIN], to leave the im-
pression that this bill authorized money 
for clothing and food. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. We 
have an Appropriations Committee that 
takes care of all of that. 
Mr. FARBSTEIN. Mr. Chairman, will 
the gentleman yield? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Cer-
tainly. I yield to the gentleman from 
New York. 
Mr. FARBSTEIN. But this includes 
hospitals, does it not? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. That 
is right. 
Mr. FARBSTEIN. And this is made 
evident on page 19 of your report. With-
out this appropriation we could have no 
hospitals or the necessary money to build 
whatever new hopsitals are needed in 
Vietnam; is that correct? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carohna. In 
southeast Asia. 
Mr. LAIRD. Mr. Chairman, will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. I 
yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin. 
Mr. LAIRD. I would like to inquire of 
the chairman to make the record emi-
nently clear that there are no appropri-
ations included in this particular bill. 
This is an authorization bill for appro-
priations, and the question of the cloth-
ing will be considered in the supplemen-
tal appropriation bill which will be before 
the House in a week or 10 days. 
There may be no clothing shortages 
as far as Vietnam is concerned., but I am 
sure that the distinguished chairman, 
from South Carolina, will admit that 
there are clothing shortages in the - 
United States and in other sections of 
the Army because of the drawdown in 
stocks. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Let 
me say this: This is an authorization bill. 
Our committee does not authorize cloth-
ing. If the gentleman on the Appropria-
tions Committee?and he is a distin-
guished member?says there are clothing 
shortages, this comes under his commit-
tee and I will accept that statement. 
Mr. PEPPER. Mr. Chairman, will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. I 
yield to the gentleman from Florida. 
Mr. PEPPER. Mr. Chairman, I want 
to commend the able chairman for the 
splendid statement he has made and 
for bringing this bill to the House, and to 
assure him that I am wholeheartedly for 
this bill. 
What I want to ask is this: Every time 
I see a picture in the paper of some 
American men going down a jungle trail 
in Vietnam, running the risk of being 
attacked by snipers and being ambushed 
and the like, I just wonder if there is 
not some way that the genius of our 
country can provide a method of fer-
reting out, or a method of destroying, the 
enemy without those men having io walk 
and to expose themselves on those jungle 
trails. 
My question to the able gentleman is 
this: Is there any way that we can pos-
sibly provide the firepower to our men 
over there which will save their lb es and 
limbs better than they are mm being 
saved from the enemy? 
Second, could we do this by increasing 
the amount of our research appropria-
tion? I notice that the bill provides- for 
the Army $27 million-plus, for the Navy 
$52 Million-plus, and for the Air Force

March 1, 1966 Approved FCIORSeta62006A17/RECCIRIP2BPWWW46R000400050008-5 4265 
$71 million-plus for research and devel-
opment. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Right. 
Mr. PEPPER. I know there are many 
problems, but could we possibly provide 
any more money for research that would, 
at a greater financial expense, conserve 
the lives of our precious men over there? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. At the 
moment the Defense Department tells us 
this is all they need, but following this 
up, on the 7th of March we will begin 
hearings on the regular 1967 authoriza-
tion, and in that bill there no doubt will 
be more research and development au-
thorization. No doubt some of the ques-
tions which perplex the gentleman will 
be answered in that bill as far as re-
search and development is concerned. 
As far as the safety of the men is con-
cerned, we have tried every way on earth 
to safeguard these men. I do not like 
the idea of photographers following them 
all over the place with TV cameras, show-
ing all kinds of things. I do not like 
that, but they do it. There are many 
things I do not like about this war, but 
I have to back my President, and he does 
the very best he can. 
This is the most insidious thing we 
have ever gotten into. There has never 
been a war like this or one to compare 
with it. We are learning all kinds of new 
things. 
Just the other day a friend of mine 
invented a light which he puts in a 
C-123?and you open up the bays andi 
a very vast light comes out and lights up 
the whole area like a football field. They 
try all kinds of things that the minds of 
these great scientists can produce to save 
our men and ferret out the Vietcong. 
People have called me lots of things. 
Some have called me a hawk. No one 
has called me a dove. But what I am in-
terested in is the American Eagle and 
keeping the American Eagle flying. 
Mr. PEPPER. I remember President 
Roosevelt telling me? during the early 
part of World War II, when he was As-
sistant Secretary of the Navy in World 
War I we were losing a terrific amount 
of tonnage and lives to German subma-
rines. The Navy decided to put a re-
search program into effect and invited 
a great number of the inventors of the 
country to come to facilities that the 
Navy established for them in New Lon-
don, Conn., and put each one in a little 
cubicle and let him go to work with his 
idea. He said that in 6 months' time 
those men had come up with the best 
methods that we had been able to con-
trive to diminish our shipping losses due 
to submarine warfare. 
Now, all I want to say here is that I 
was wholeheartedly behind the able 
chairman and his committee and the 
President, but I hope, I will say, that we 
will tell the armed services of our coun-
try and the Department of Defense, do 
not spare any money in research and do 
not spare any money in more weapons 
or more firepower. You will not have 
any trouble with Congress giving more 
money for research and for more and 
better weapons which will save the lives 
of the men making this gallant fight. 
No. 36- 16 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I assure the gentleman from 
Florida that we have told the Secretary 
that 100 times. Every chance we have 
had. Every bill we have had before our 
committee has come out of our commit-
tee unanimously. 
Now, as far as research and develop-
ment is concerned, we have averaged be-
tween $6 and $7 billion per year on that. 
We are exploring every area we know. I 
do not think we have been niggardly 
with- our funds at all. We have given 
them everything that they claim they 
need. 
Mr. STRATTON. Mr. Chairman, will 
the distinguished chairman yield to me? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Of 
course I will yield to the distinguished 
member of the committee. 
Mr. STRATTON. Is it not true in re-
sponse to the questions raised by the 
gentleman from Florida that the overall 
departmental appropriation request is 
also a request for very substantial 
amounts of ammunition to do just the 
job he is talking about, so that we can 
use our vast productive capacity and 
vastly superior firepower to save lives of 
American soldiers? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. So 
much so that we have opened up another 
ammunition plant which is now in full 
production. 
Mr. STRATTON. I thank the gentle-
man. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Chairman, will the 
distinguished chairman yield to me? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. I do 
not have much time, but I will yield to 
you one more time. 
Mr. RYAN. Could the chairman tell 
the Committee what he expects in the 
way of an increase in our troop strength 
in South Vietnam? The chairman said 
earlier we have 250,000 men there. What 
does he expect in the next 6 months, and 
in the next year? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. I did 
not say 250,000 on the mainland. I said 
over 250,000 in southeast Asia. 
Mr. RYAN. Could the chairman tell 
us what he anticipates in the next 6 
months? 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Your 
guess could be as good as mine; but it 
will be sizable. It will be sizable; but 
Your guess is as good as mine. However, 
I will tell you one thing: I would rather 
have too many than too few, and that is 
what we ? are trying to do. I know the 
gentleman agrees with me that we do not 
want to have too few, because these Com-
munists do not frighten very easily. 
Mr. BATES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself such time as I may desire. 
Mr. Chairman, I join with the distin-
guished chairman of the Committee on 
Armed Services in urging your support 
of H.R. 12889. Before proceeding with 
my remarks, Mr. Chairman, I would like 
to address myself briefly to some of the 
questions which have just been asked, 
especially in reference to inventories. 
Now, on yesterday,. when Gen. Lewis 
Walt appeared before the House Com-
mittee on Appropriations, I asked to have 
a conference with him in respect to the 
military situation and the inventory sit-
uation specifically under his command 
presently in Vietnam. He advised us 
that this is the third war in which he 
has participated and never has he found 
the inventory situation as good as it is 
presently in Vietnam. This does not 
mean that our inventory situation back 
here in the United States or in anticipa-
tion of future developments is all that we 
want, because as we brought out in the 
hearings?and it is in the published 
hearings presently before you?we do 
have shortages, including shortages of 
Marine clothing. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, will the gentleman yield to 
me? 
Mr. BATES. I will be glad to yield to 
the chairman. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. The 
shortages about whiCh I was speaking 
were not in Vietnam. There are no 
shortages in Vietnam. I am sure the 
gentleman will agree with me on that. 
Mr. BATES. Yes, indeed. That is the 
point I tried to establish. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Chairman, will the 
gentleman yield to me? 
Mr. BATES. I will be glad to yield to 
the gentleman. 
Mr. LATTA. Before my question, let 
me say that since I have been a Member 
of Congress I have always supported 
these authorization requests and the ap-
propriations for them. I intend to sup-
port this one. But I know there are a 
lot of Members of Congress who have 
had many, many letters from parents 
who have received letters from boys in 
South Vietnam indicating certain 
shortages. 
Therefore, Mr. Chairman, I would like 
to call to the attention of the gentleman 
in the well, the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts [Mr. BATES] , an article dated 
Monday, February 21, 1966, written by 
Mr. Hansen W. Baldwin, which goes into 
great detail with reference to some of 
the shortages which exist in Vietnam. 
I know that the gentleman from 
Massachusetts has seen this article, but 
I would like to have the comments of 
the gentleman upon the article. 
Mr. BATES. I have not only read the 
article, but I have also talked on the 
telephone personally with Mr. Baldwin. 
As a matter of fact, this morning at 8 
o'clock. I met with the Secretary of 
Defense and asked him to complete the 
study which is now being made of Mr. 
Baldwin's article and to which reference 
has been made by the gentleman from 
Ohio. However, the Secretary of De-
fense did indicate generally?and I want 
to say "generally"?and the report has 
not been submitted to me yet?that the 
accusations and the charges which are 
made by Mr. Baldwin in his article are 
not accurate. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Chairman, if the 
gentleman will yield further, I want to 
thank him for following through on this 
matter. I know this article was very 
disturbing. We have had other reports 
which seem to verify some of the charges 
which have been made in this article.

March 
Mr. Chairman, I look forward to fur-
ther discussion of this matter on the 
floor of the House as a result of the re-
quest which you have made.. 
Mr. BATES. I will say to the gentle-
man from Ohio that no one is more con-
cerned than I am to make absolutely 
certain that our men have what they 
need in combat. 
Mr. MINSHALL. Mr. Chairman, will 
tile gentleman yield? 
Mr. BATES. I am glad to yield to the 
gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. MINSHALL. As a member of the 
Defense Subcommittee of the Committee 
on Appropriations, we have been holding 
intensive hearings for the past several 
days on exactly the subject about which 
my distinguished colleague [Mr. LATTA 1, 
and the gentleman from Massachusetts 
have been discussing, mainly with ref-
erence to clothing shortages. We have 
discussed this question with General 
Johnson, Chief of the Army; we have re-
cently discussed it with General Greene 
arid General Walt of the Marine COrps, 
and also the Chief of Naval Operations, 
Admiral McDonald. 
As a result of our subcommittee hear-
ings there is no doubt in my mind or in 
their mind that our troops in Vietnam 
are currently receiving all that they pres-
ently need. I concur with the chairman 
of the Committee on Armed Services 
when he says that they are getting all 
they need. However, what concerns Gen-
eral Johnson and General Greene are 
forecast shortages and the shortages that 
are presently in existence today with ref-
erence to our troops here on the 
homefront. 
There is a definite shortage of cloth-
ing, specifically of cotton khaki pants 
that they are issuing to the Marine Corps. 
They are presently receiving only one 
issue of cotton khaki pants, whereas the 
normal issue calls for three pair. This 
shortage will not be relieved until late 
this year. 
So, we cannot say that there are no 
shortages of clothing. There is this par-
ticular shortage, plus others, that we 
'brought out in the hearings, and which 
will be made public when our hearings 
are published. 
The Army will have adequate fatigue 
jackets but not enough pants in the 
months ahead. The Marines forecast a 
shortage of cotton khaki pants. This 
will be a funny looking Military Estab-
lishment. George Washington's army at 
Valley Forge may have had no shoes, but 
the Great Society's forces are running 
out of pants. 
Mr. BATES. As a matter of fact, I 
heard about them in our own hearings. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Chairman, will the 
omit:dem:in yield further? 
Mr. BATES. I yield further to the 
gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. LATTA. There have also been 
other shortages that have been brought 
to the attention of the Armed Services 
Committee in addition to clothing. 
Mr. Chairman, I would like to call to 
the attention of the gentleman the testi-
mony which appears on page 5068 of the 
hearings which were held by the Com-
mittee on Armed Services where General 
Greene was being questioned by Mr. 
Blandford. 
Mr. Chairman, Mr. Blantiford asked 
the question: 
How about 10:5 ammunition, proximity 
fuse ammunition, proximity fuses, and 8-
inch howitzer ammunition? His there been 
any reduction in that for practice purposes? 
General Greene replied: 
We have had some snortages in 105-milli-
meter illuminating ammunition ,i. I checked 
on that specifically when I was :art this last 
time in south Vietnam. Howerer, although 
we don't have the levels that w, would like, 
our operations at night using this ammuni-
tion have not been restricted. We still had 
enough on hand. I would say that 105-
millimeter illuminating would have to 
necessarily be used carefully in raining. 
Then Mr. Blandford asked the follow-
ing question: 
Well, actually, am I correct that there has 
been a reduction in the availability of this 
type of ammunition for training purposes? 
General Greene replied: 
That would depend, of cours, upon the 
division commanders. T cannot give you the 
specific answer. 
Then he goes on to another question 
which appears at the top of page 5069 to 
which General Greene replied: 
We have had a problem there again in 4.2 
illuminating projectors.. 
Then Mr. Blandford asked this ques-
tion: 
Where are the other places whcre we have 
problems? 
General Greene replied: 
believe the committee in the; ,- visits and 
examination of this prolciem, as I recall, 
found six different types of amr kunition in 
which there were indications of shortages. 
The Manne Corps has not been hampered or 
crippled in actual operations in South Viet-
nam in any of these areas. 
Mr. Chairman, this is testimony which 
was given by General Greene before the 
Committee on Armed Services_ 
believe we ought to admit these short-
ages exist and do something about them. 
Mr. BATES. I want to thank the gen-
tleman from Ohio for revealing to the 
House this matter which was uncovered 
by our Committee on Armed Services, 
and we certainly intend to pursue this at 
every opportunity. 
I would just like to say to the Members 
generally now, if anyone has any specific 
items that they have reason to believe is 
hi short supply either overseas or here, 
call it to our attention and we will cer-
tainly look into it and ;3ee that the situa-
tion is rectified. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina,. Mr. 
Chairman, will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. BATES. I gladly yield to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Gen-
eral Greene also said this?and we cer-
tainly do not want to cover up any-
thing?but this is what Gener. .11 Greene 
said: 
The Marine Corps has not been hampered 
or crippled in actual operations in South 
Vietnam in a,ny of these areas. 
If we find any shortages, believe you 
me, we certainly are going to follow 
through ,:an them. 
(16 
If the gentleman will yield further?
right today in Washington, Lieutenant 
General Walt who heads the marines 
In the Da Nang area, said that he has 
never had an army of marines with bet-
ter morale or better equipped. That is 
what he said today and he also said he 
has fought in three wars. 
So wherever we find shortages, we will 
follow through on them. So I do not 
think we need to worry about that kind 
of thing in Vietnam today. 
Mr. BELCHER. Mr. Chairman, will 
the gentleman yield? 
Mr. BATES. I yield to the s entleman. 
Mr. BELCHER. This does not neees-
sarily involve the question of shorOges, 
but I had a complaint from the wife of a 
serviceman in Vietnam. She said his 
letter stated there were 10 of them in 
their outfit, I think it was in the enei-
neers?and all their sidearms and weap-
ons had been taken away from them. 
He said that four of them had been killed 
by snipers and they had no means of 
protecting themselves. 
I also noticed on television, as I im-
agine a lot of other Members of the 
House did, where a lady complained that 
her husband had been attacked and the 
only thing he had to defend himself with 
was a knife. He had no side arm or rifle 
whatsoever to defend himself with. Has 
anything like that come to tile attention 
of the committee? 
Mr. BATES. I have heard a story 
such as the gentleman relates. Has the 
gentleman addressed any inquiry him-
self to the Department of Defense? 
Mr. BELCHER. Yes, I have. 
Mr. BATES. What was their rep10 
Mr. BELCHER. They have not had 
time to make a reply yet. 
Mr. BATES. If the gentleman will 
give me specific information, I will be 
very happy to cooperate with him. Be-
cause certainly the interest which the 
gentleman displays is on something that 
we on the committee also take very, very 
seriously. If there are any problems--if 
there are any shortages, we want to cor-
rect the situation. We do not want, to 
hide anything under a bushel. 
Mr. BELCHER. Of course, this did 
not involve the question of a shortage. 
The guns were there but they were taken 
away from the men and the guns were 
locked up. 
Mr. BATES. I am not referring only 
to shortages. I am referring to any other 
kind of situation that the gentleman will 
give me specific information on and I 
will be happy to cooperate with him. 
Mr. LATTA. Mr. Chairrnan, will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. BATES. I am glad to yield to the 
gentleman. 
Mr. LATTA. This is a very important 
matter. I think when the committee 
was before the Committee on Rules they 
asked for 3 hours and you thosteht that 
3 would be adequate. 
Mr. BATES. The gentleman is bouts 
very well. 
Mr. LATTA. I thank the gentleman 
for yielding because we did bring out 
something that was apparently over-
looked in the Armed Services Commit-
tee. I want to commend the gentleman 
in the well.

You gave assurances that you will 
look into these matters as they 
come to the attention of the Mem-
bers. I, also want to commend the 
chairman of the committee because he 
has been most helpful in the past about 
these matters. I think in my own case 
when I hear from parents of servicemen 
in Vietnam instead of bucking these 
things over to the Pentagon and getting 
their stock reply?"We will look into 
it"?I will buck them over to your com-
mittee. I will get more information that 
way. 
Mr. BATES. I shall be very, very 
grateful to the gentleman if he does so. 
As a matter of fact, yesterday afternoon 
someone made an inquiry of me with re-
ference to a particular bomb. This 
morning I was at the Pentagon, as I 
indicated a few moments ago, and I 
asked the Secretary of Defense to get 
out his book. We looked specifically into 
that book to find out about the inven-
tory situation that we have and as to 
the present usage rate on this particular 
bomb and what our production is going 
to be and what our inventory is going 
to be 12 months from now. So if the 
gentleman will give us the information 
to which he refers, he will be doing us a 
favor. We would be most happy to co-
operate with him because this is our 
business and when we come before the 
House we want to indicate what the 
facts truly are. I must say that the 
gentleman has been most helpful here 
today. 
Mr. HUNGATE. Mr. Chairman, will 
the gentleman yield? 
Mr. BATES. I yield to the gentleman. 
Mr. HUNGATE. I understand the 
gentleman is fully familiar with the ar-
ticle by Hanson Baldwin that appeared in 
the New York Times of February 21, and 
the committee has the problems therein 
mentioned under active consideration. 
Mr. BATES. Yes, we have had the full 
discussion on that and will get full dis-
closure of information on those points. 
Mr. HUNGATE. I thank the gentle-
man very much. 
Mr. BATES. Mr. Chairman, just to 
complete our thinking on this particular 
point. If this bill was before the Con-
gress 10 years ago, not a single item in it 
would be considered by the Committee on 
Armed Services. Now why do I say that? 
Because years ago our committee did not 
take under its jurisdiction and purview 
missiles or airplanes. This year we are 
adding tracked vehicles. The only thing 
this committee had at one time under its 
jurisdiction was the question of the con-
struction and also naval vessels, but there 
are no naval vessels in this particular 
bill, So now when we come before you, 
we want to make certain that as fully as 
possible we give you all the information 
to which you are entitled. 
In fact, there was a time when naval 
vessels were provided by the Congress 
when we did not even have to give an 
authorization because there was enough 
authorization left over from World War 
II to last a thousand years. 
Mr. Chairman, I agree fully with the 
distinguished Speaker of the House when 
he said that if we had had firm leader-
ship prior to World War II, perhaps we 
would never have had World War II. 
I believe, too, that if we had not de-
clared that Korea was outside the de-
fense perimeter of the United States, 
perhaps there would have been no Ko-
rea. But that is history. Today we are 
dealing with facts and not with con-
jecture. 
As the distinguished chairman of this 
committee has said, our boys are now in 
South Vietnam. Maybe some in your 
family are in South Vietnam. I know 
that my family is represented there. 
So this bill contains authorizations 
for appropriations for procurement, for 
research and development, test and eval-
uation, and for military construction in 
the amount of $4.8 billion. 
We have done much in the field of re-
search and development. This year 
alone we will spend $6.7 billion just in 
military research and development. The 
fantastic things that have been invented, 
if they could be revealed here, would give 
you considerable comfort. Some of these 
are already in the hands of our troops 
and more are forthcoming. 
I would like to say that we do have 
one reservation, and that is the question 
of the timing of this specific legislation. 
Was it necessary to come here today, or 
could it have waited in the orderly proc-
ess of things and been considered with 
the fiscal year 1967 bill, which we will 
consider on the 8th of March? That is 
a question. We asked for the specific 
facts. I must be frank and candid and 
say to you that the information which 
came to us was inconclusive. We did 
feel that much that is in this bill per-
haps could have been deferred until the 
1st of July, but we do not want to gam-
ble. We do not want to take a chance. 
Oh, I know and you know that when 
the President comes up here with a 
budget for 1967 and he can eliminate 
from it $12 billion, like we have in this 
general appropriation supplemental bill, 
then, of course, it looks much better as 
the American people review it. But 
from a military point of view it achieves 
no purpose if bookkeeping is the only 
purpose. 
Nevertheless, we do not want to gam-
ble. If this bill can be expedited, we 
want it expedited, because we want to 
make certain that our young men have 
what they need when they need it and 
not have too little too late. 
The rapid buildup of U.S. forces in 
South Vietnam in the calendar year 1967 
did not provide time for the advanced 
development of detailed plans. Many of 
these will be submitted as soon as the 
Secretary of Defense receives this in-
formation. I would not say that clair-
voyance was used by the Department of 
Defense as to the development of pro-
grams either last year or this year. 
Many of the members of our own com-
mittee believed a year ago that we should 
have increased our production of heli-
copters, ammunition, and production in 
other fields. But it was not done at the 
time we recommended because it was 
never believed, so we were told, that this 
war would escalate to the degree which 
it has. 
But as I have indicated, we are dealing 
with facts and not with fantasies, and 
we have young men there today and we 
must support them. 
In the military construction area this 
bill provides for troop housing, ports, 
depots, hospitals, signal communica-
tions, airfields, and community facilities, 
not only in Vietnam, but nearby in the 
Philippines, in Guam, in Okinawa, Wake 
Island, Midway, and even in Thailand. 
Some will even be built in the United 
States. The list appears on page 26 of 
the report. 
As proposed originally by the Depart-
ment of Defense, the language in section 
401(a) of this bill was susceptible of an 
Interpretation that it constituted an un-
limited transfer of authority to the ex-
tent that the Department of Defense 
appropriations for personnel functions 
could have been used for procurement, 
or that procurement appropriations 
were authorized to be transferred to 
operations and maintenance-type ex-
penditures in behalf of South Vietnam. 
But our committee wisely?I believe 
wisely?added the words, "for their 
stated purposes," so that whatever we 
have in this bill must be used for the 
general purposes intended and not ac-
cording to what someone might want to 
do regardless of the intent of Congress. 
I will invite your attention to the fact 
that any aircraft, missile, or tracked 
combat vehicle for which funds are au-
thorized in this bill can be made avail-
able to the Vietnamese or to the Koreans 
or to the Filipinos or to the Australians 
or whoever else might be engaged in 
combat on our side in Vietnam. 
Why did we do this? The practical 
aspect of this is obvious. When these 
men are engaged in combat, that is no 
time to be keeping detailed accounting 
records. 
The fact of the matter is that the U.S. 
Government and the people of this coun-
try must pick up the tab anyway. So 
let the men spend the time on defending 
themselves and executing the war, rather 
than keeping these detailed reports. 
Now, Mr. Chairman, I shall close. I 
have already taken more time than I had 
anticipated, but the basic purpose of this 
bill is to support our fighting men, as well 
as our friendly allies, who are in Vietnam 
now fighting for the objectives of free-
dom. 
There might be all kinds of debate 
that could extend day after day, as it has 
in the other body, as to whether we are 
bombing enough, or just right, or too 
little, or whether we should get out of 
South Vietnam altogether. But while 
we are discussing this, time is moving on, 
and it takes a long time for many of these 
implements of war to be manufactured. 
Our forces require essential supplies, 
equipment, and facilities, to enable them 
to accomplish the job which they have 
been sent over there by us to do. I ad-
vocate that all members of this com-
mittee, regardless of what disposition 
they might have in respect to foreign 
policy, to support this bill and to support 
our men that we have sent 10,000 miles 
away to fight in the cause of freedom.

March 1, -.1!:c'; 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina.. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 10 minutes to the dis-
tinguished majority leader [Mr. At:aural. 
(Mr. ALBERT asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. ALBERT. Mr. Chairman, I con-
gratulate the distinguished chairman of 
this committee and the distinguished 
ranking member, both of whom have 
adequately explained the details of this 
bill. I join them in urging the prompt 
adoption of this measure. 
The hill which is now before this 
House, its background and its implica-
tions, have been considered with all the 
wisdom and experience we can bring to 
bear. It has been referred from commit-
tee with a strong endorsement which has 
taken into account every pertinent cir-
cumstance and consideration. It has 
been examined and debated, and exten-
sive public discussion has taken place. I 
believe that the time for debate is over 
and the time to pass this bill is at hand. 
What is needed now is prompt and over-
whelming approval of the present bill to 
demonstrate to those who oppose us that 
there is no division in the Congress or 
among the American people regarding 
support for our troops in Vietnam. 
I think recent discussions have made 
our goals in Vietnam crystal clear. As 
the President stated on February 23: 
Our purpose in Vietnam is to prevent the 
success of aggression. It is not conquest; it 
is not, empire; it is not foreign bases; it is not 
domination. It is to prevent the forceful 
conquest of South. Vietnam by North 
Vietnam. 
The Secretary of State wisely pointed 
out on February 18: 
We are in Vietnam because the issues posed 
there are deeply intertwined with our own 
security and because the outcome of the 
struggle can profoundly affect the nature of 
the world in which we and our children will 
live. 
Now, I do not intend to try the pa-
tience of my colleagues by repeating on 
this occasion all the reasoning which has 
led to the conclusion that we must stand 
by the people of South Vietnam. Of 
course the task which faces us is not an 
easy one. Of course it is not without 
risks, grave risks. Of course, we cannot 
foretell how long it will be before an 
obdurate aggressor will be brought to his 
senses. But the difficulty of the task is 
not the criterion. This country was born 
under a resolution which called for lib-
erty or death. 
Our men are in Vietnam now, they 
have undertaken the brave struggle with 
courage and determination. They are 
not going to be abandoned by this House 
at this hour. We are standing and they 
are fighting for what we believe is the 
right war in the right place and at the 
right time. 
Surely we are under no illusions about 
the nature of the war we are fighting 
or the goals of those who have provoked 
it. This is no struggle for liberation.. 
This is a part of an international con-
spiracy aimed at all southeast Asia. This 
is not a civil war. It is an invasion, 
organized, sponsored and led from 
flanoi. The hardened international 
conspirators behind this invasion have 
already made it clear that Thailand is 
the next target in southeast. Asia while 
the free lands of Latin America and 
Africa should not be neglected. 
The horrors which have been visited 
upon the people of South Vietnam as a 
result of these decisions are well known 
to us. Our hearts go out to them in 
their suffering, but. also our admiration 
for the determination with which they 
have resisted the onslaught. I am proud 
that this country has, in consonance with 
our cherished traditions? lived up to its 
promises made to come to the assistance 
of the South Vietnamese* 
I hope that any doubts abeut whether 
we have a legitimate commitment to 
South Vietnam have been laid to rest. 
Our vital interests are involved in the 
struggle of the people of South Vietnam 
to build a new society according to their 
own desires, free from Communist ag-
gression. Our commitment to Vietnam 
has been expressed since 1954 in congres-
sional resolutions and acts, Presidential 
declarations, bilateral assistance agree-
ments, and the SEATO treaty, as well 
as in the joint resolution of August 7, 
1964. The. Congress has supported this 
commitment at every stage of the way. 
The vote we ask on the bill before us 
today will be a further expression of sup-
port for that commitinent. The word of 
the United States is at stake here, and if 
the word of the United States is not good 
everywhere, it will not be good anywhere. 
If we fail ,in our commitments at one 
time how can friend or foe ever depend 
on our commitments at anytime. 
That the Communist north might at-
tempt to take over South Vietnam by 
subversion or aggression was clear from 
the moment the Geneva agreements 
were signed in 1954. Indeed, :t is a fact 
accepted even by the few scholars expert 
on Vietnam who criticize aspects of our 
policy, that the Communists violated the 
Geneva agreements before the ink was 
dry on them. They did this primarily 
by leaving -their agents and caches of 
arms behind in the south, thus failing to 
regroup to the north as agreed, with a 
view to the battle they foresaw even then. 
The United States declared formally at 
Geneva that we "would view any renewal 
of aggression in violation of the afore-
said agreements with grave coacern and 
as seriously threatening international 
peace and security." 
In October 1954, President E,senhower 
undertook a program of direct assistance 
to help South Vietnam become "capable 
of resisting attempted subversion or ag-
gression through military meal is." And 
the United States joined with its allies 
in the SEATO Treaty, which was made 
applicable to South Vietnam by a spe-
cial protocol. On May 11, 1917, Presi-
dents Eisenhower and Diem, issued a joint 
statement which included the following 
language: 
Noting that the Republic of Vietnam is 
covered by article r'ir of the Southeast Asia 
Collective Defense Treaty, President Eisen-
hower and President Ngo Dinh Diem agreed 
that aggression or subversion threatening 
the political independence of the Republic 
of Vietnam would be considered as endanger-
ing peace and stability. 
On August 2, 1961, President Keit d y 
declared: 
The United States is determined that tl,e. 
Republic of Vietnam shall not be lost 10 
the Communists for lack of any support 
which the United States can render. 
And on December 14 that year, redly-
to President Diem's appeal for addi-
tional support to meet the growing effort 
of the north, President Kennedy reaf-
firmed that the United States was "pre-
pared to help the Republic of Vietnam 
to protect its people and to preserve its 
independence." 
President Johnson has reaffirmed these 
commitments many times, and on Au-
gust 7, 1964, the joint resolution of the 
Congress, adopted by a vote of 504 to 2. 
stated inter aim, as follows: 
The United States regards as vital to tis 
national interest and to world peace the 
maintenance of international peace and se-
curity in southeast Asia. Consonant with 
the Constitution of the United States and 
the Charter of the United Nations, and in 
accordance with its obligation under the 
Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, 
the United States is, therefore, prepared, as 
the President determines, to take all neces-
sary steps, including the use of armed force, 
to assist any member of protocol state of 
the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty, 
requesting assistance in defense of its free-
dom. 
This resolution is still on the books. 
This resolution is the law of the land. 
The legality of the U.S. involvement 
in South Vietnam is not subject to ques-
tion. As my colleagues surely know 
the American Bar Association's House of 
Delegates has voted unanimously on this 
question, to uphold the only reasonable 
view possible; namely, that our action 
concords with the Constitution, the 
United Nations Charter, and the SEATO 
Treaty. Specifically, the charter recog-
nizes the right of individual and collec-
tive self-defense, a right inherent under 
international law. And the applicability 
of the SEATO Treaty under which the 
pertinent obligations are individual and 
collective, was definitively spelled out by 
the Secretary of State in his :fil.tement 
of February 18. 
At this late stage can there be any 
doubt who started the war in South 
Vietnam or who provoked its escalation? 
It is crystal clear that the actions of the 
United States have constituted a meas-
ured response to escalation by North 
Vietnam. Having laid the groundwork 
for aggression as early as 1954, the Com-
munists hoped to achieve their conquest 
through rigged unification elections in 
1956. However, the South refused to be 
taken in this way, insisting that the vot-
ers' freedom to vote would have to be 
supervised and guaranteed by an ade-
quate and impartial system of supervi-
sion. The north thereafter began gre d-
ually to infiltrate native South Viet-
namese trained in guerrilla warfare, with 
the result that from 1957 to 1959 over 
, 
1 000 civilians were assassinated or kid-
,  
napped by the Vietcong. From 1959 
through 1961 Vietcong terrorism and 
armed attacks were intensified. In 1961, 
in response to President Diem's request. 
the small American military mission was 
increased in order to add advisory tune-

March 1,1966 Approved FIKRZIRESSIINSME7RBCCECRDFlegtfa46R000400050008-5 4269 
tions to its former logistical and support 
functions. North Vietnam between 
1962 and 1964 greatly increased its in-
filtration of military personnel, political 
cadres and equipment, and the number 
of American military advisers had to 
grow. By early 1965, Vietcong attacks 
reached intensive levels, and as a result 
we responded with air attacks against 
the north and the introduction of corn.. 
bat personnel. Regular units of the 
North Vietnamese military forces were 
introduced from December 1964, and 
this infiltration has continued to grow. 
Does any one doubt that the so-called 
National Liberation Front of South 
Vietnam is an artificial creation of 
Hanoi. This apparatus was created in 
late 1960 in Hanoi, indeed the names of 
the alleged leaders were not even dis-
closed until spring of 1962. When these 
names finally were released, these pur-
ported leaders were unknown to the peo-
ple of South Vietnam, in fact Vietcong 
prisoners to this day reveal a singular 
unawareness of the names of these so-
called leaders. An attempt has been in-
tensified to create the impression that 
the Vietcong front is composed of inde-
pendent South Vietnamese groups as 
well as Communists, and that it repre-
sents the people of South Vietnam. 
However, the flow of refugees away from 
Communist areas, the Vietcong's ever 
increasing reliance on terror, the morale 
of the South Vietnamese fighting forces, 
and the lack Of support by legitimate 
South Vietnamese organizations give the 
lie to these claims. The Vietcong have 
never been able to gain any kind of a 
foothold in South Vietnamese political 
parties, labor unions, refugee groups, 
regional organizations or churches, and 
South Vietnamese politicians who have 
opposed particular governments in Sai-
gon have never defected to the Vietcong. 
The Vietcong's attempts to call gen-
eral strikes have failed, and their best 
efforts to prevent the people from voting 
in last year's provincial and municipal 
council elections also failed. People 
outside Vietnam are in many cases re-
grettably ready to believe the fiction that 
the Vietcong represent an indigenous 
political movement, perhaps because this 
would make our own withdrawal easier 
to bring about, but the people of South 
Vietnam are not duped by these preten-
sions. The Vietcong are an arm of 
Hanoi, and the South Vietnamese know 
this. 
In certain quarters we still hear the 
call for negotiation, for peaceful settle-
ment. Does any one at this stage doubt 
the sincerity and perseverance of the 
United States in seeking a peaceful so-
lution in South Vietnam? Again and 
again, using every channel available, the 
United States has invited Hanoi to meet 
for discussions without the imposition of 
any conditions whatsoever. Every sug-
gestion made has been considered and, 
where possible, acted upon by the United 
States. At considerable military cost, 
the air attacks against the former sanc-
tuary of North Vietnam were shut off for 
over a month. 
Hanoi, however, has remained obsti-
nate and vitriolic about these negotiation 
efforts, rejecting them out of hand in-
sisting upon prior acceptance of its own 
conditions. As the Members of this 
House know, the chief stumbling block 
remains Hanoi's insistence upon recog-
nition of the so-called National Libera-
tion Front as the sole, genuine represent-
ative of the South Vietnamese people, 
Hanoi has likewise insisted upon accept-
ance of this front's program, that is, 
upon handing over South Vietnam to 
Hanoi. 
I do not say that we should give up 
our attempts to negotiate a peaceful set-
tlement in South Vietnam. Indeed, we 
must continue ?to persevere in these ef-
forts. But I do believe that we must not, 
we cannot betray our commitments to 
the South Vietnamese people. This Na-
tion has the resources and the will to 
win in South Vietnam, and win we shall. 
Our objectives are limited and reason-
able. They boil down to making North 
Vietnam back off from its aggression in 
South Vietnam. I for one ain not going 
to be frightened from this course by those 
who raise the specter of a possible war 
with Communist China. We seek no 
such confrontation with Red China, and 
our limited objectives should be clear to 
Peiping's leaders. At the same time, we 
possess the awesome power necessary to 
such a confrontation, should the Chinese 
Communists indulge in suicidal rash-
ness. The central point is that we must 
persist in the struggle to thwart the am-
bitions of Hanoi backed by Peiping, so 
that, pacification achieved, the noble, 
revolutionary programs which were the 
subject matter of the Honolulu Confer-
ence can proceed with greater vigor?
and the people of South Vietnam can 
live in peace. 
The issues are clear, Mr. Speaker. Our 
commitments and our obligations are 
clear. Our duty is clear. Our troops and 
the civilian representatives who are help-
ing the South Vietnamese are doing their 
duty. The people of this country will 
not shirk their duty. And just as surely, 
this House will not shirk its duty. Our 
military have carefully considered what 
they need to carry on the fight, and the 
bill which is before us is a request for the 
funds necessary to provide for these 
needs. Let us, then, without further pro-
longing discussion, without feeding the 
hopes of the enemy that he can win in 
Washington what he cannot win on the 
batlefield, proceed to enact this bill. Our 
fighting men deserve this vote of con-
fidence, immediately, overwhelmingly, 
and without further ado. 
Mr. BATES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
5 minutes to the distinguished gentle-
man from Indiana [Mr. BRAY] . 
(Mr. BRAY asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FINO. Mr. Chairman, will the 
gentleman yield to me? 
Mr. BRAY. I yield to the gentleman 
from New York. 
Mr. FINO. Mr. Chairman, I want to 
thank the gentleman from Indiana for 
yielding to me at this time. 
Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of 
this bill, but I do so with several qualms. 
My first qualm is that the President 
seems to want to keep this war on an un-
admitted. "no win, no lose" middle track. 
We are not pulling back to enclaves and 
we are not pushing ahead to military 
success. This kind of policy is costly?
much too costly. I will not vote to fund 
a war that throws men into a meat-
grinder and money into a pool of quick-
sand. I want to see us switch to mili-
tary and diplomatic tactics aimed at put-
ting us in a position to negotiate a suc-
cessful conclusion to this war before we 
have spent tens of thousands of lives 
and tens of billions of dollars. 
To move into this particular legisla-
tion, I would like to say I am not sur-
prised that the Armed Services Commit-
tee had to make provision for additional 
funds for Navy construction in the Far 
East. Secretary McNamara has been ex-
tremely careless during the last few years 
in assessing American maritime and na-
val needs. He has grossly underesti-
mated our civilian and military seapower 
needs in the Far East. Our merchant 
marine has been left to stagnate. Our 
Navy has also been neglected?as witness 
the fact that it was up to the Armed 
Services Committee to provide for Navy 
construction needs in the Far East. I 
think the Secretary's lack of awareness of 
seapower and water transport has been 
costly to our war effort. From Vietnam 
to Brooklyn Navy Yard, Secretary Mc-
Namara has done too little, too late. 
I would like to say, frankly, that I am 
worried about American maritime power. 
Secretary McNamara decided some time 
ago that Vietnam could be supplied by 
airlift, and he neglected the merchant 
marine. Now the Russians are building 
a merchant marine that is planned to 
make our merchant marine look like a 
tugboat fleet. The British have said 
that our merchant marine is so old and 
shoddy it can for the most part be in-
sured only at a premium?and this could 
force many of our ships off the sea. I 
would have thought that the British 
would be content with bringing supplies 
to North Vietnam. Evidently they want 
to get the profits out of supplying both 
sides in this war. 
In short, the administration has not 
shown any foresight in planning the 
needs of our Navy or merchant marine. 
I hope that this carelessness is over and 
done with. There is only one area in 
which this administration has antioi-
pated seapower needs before they de-
veloped. I have read recently that our 
Potomac fleet is being reactivated. 
Evidently the President has determined 
that our budget is so well balanced that 
the Presidential yacht can be brought out 
of mothballs?but we cannot afford 
Brooklyn Navy Yard. 
I am also disturbed that much of the 
supplemental appropriation before us 
here today really belongs in the 1967 
budget, but has been moved up to get it 
out of the fiscal 1967 budget to make 
room for wasteful spending programs in 
next year's budget. I do not think a 
supplemental appropriation should serve 
this purpose. 
I support this bill as a military spend-
ing bill necessary to support troops in 
the field, but in many ways it disturbs 
me. Its disturbs me if it has any con-
notation as being a mandate for escala-
tion. It disturbs me that votes for this

march 1, 1966 
authorization may be construed as sup-
port of administration policy?my vote is 
not a vote in support of administration 
policy, my vote is rather a vote in sup-
port of American troops. I would also 
like to say that my vote here today is not 
a vote for the budget gimmick aspect of 
this bill. I am starting to feel that 
everything that ciomes before us these 
days has a budget gimmick in it. 
I am getting tired of the President's 
little devices for getting expenditures 
out of the fiscal 1967 budget and getting 
receipts into it. I am getting tired of 
ha; foreign and Vietnamese policies. We 
are pursuing policies at home and 
abroad that would not convince a child, 
no less Ho Chi Minh, that we have any 
long-range fortitude. We are pursuing 
wasteful programs at home and absurd 
programs abroad. We are giving our 
allies aid while they give Ho Chi Minh 
trade. We are stationing troops in Eu-
rope to protect Europeans who thumb 
their noses at our war effort because 
they think that any nation pursuing 
such shapeless and soggy policies must 
be in water over its head. 
I am worried about the President's 
policies. There is too much blood and 
too little belt-tightening. I favor a 
tough policy, but toughness is not op-
timistic, extravagant, and malcoorcii-
tinted sacrifice for insufficiently defined 
objectives. Toughness is a stern, calcu-
lated unwavering pursuit of reasonable 
and well-defined goals. This is not a 
definition of administration policy. 
The policies of this administration are 
dangerous because they are not coming 
to grips with diplomatic reality as re-
gards our allies and military reality with 
respect to Vietnam. The administra-
tion's glittering generalities and opti-
mism have built the American people 
up for a letdown if we cannot win a 
reasonable settlement at a reasonable 
cost. The potential backfire of this se-
crecy, optimism and misrepresentation 
would cheer Hanoi more than all the 
dissent in these United States. It is con-
structive dissent that can head off the 
backfire. 
My vote is for our soldiers, and for 
their splendid endurance in the face of 
this nerve-shattering war. I do not sup-
port the way in which the administra-
tion is conducting our overall cold war 
oolicy. 
I would also like to point out a way 
in which we can cut military expendi-
tures to make up for the money we are 
voting today. We can begin to with-
draw some of the 318,000 troops we have 
in Europe to protect the allies who do 
not support us. Three weeks ago, I in-
troduced a resolution, House Resolution 
728, to call on the President to begin 
withdrawing troops. Today's expendi-
ture authorization makes my budget-
cutting resolution more important. I 
urge this House to consider House Reso-
lution 728, and I am putting its text and 
other information in the Appendix today. 
Mr. BRAY. Mr. Chairman, we have 
heard from many that we should not be 
Ia. Vietnam, I do not care to discuss 
that matter at this time, because it is 
a moot question. It is a condition, not 
a theory that confronts us. We are in 
Vietnam. Several hundred thousand 
troops, sailors, a:nd airmen are there en-
gaged in as vicious war as anyone has 
participated in during the history of this 
country. We are suffering heavy losses. 
The situation is very precarious. 
So, Mr. Chairman, the purpose of this 
bill today is to provide the proper weap-
ons and supplies for serviceman who are 
in Vietnam. The weapons a ad supplies 
called for i.n this legislation are neces-
sary. 
After all, Mr. Chairman, we only have 
two alternatives before us in southeast 
Asia. We are in Vietnam in treat force, 
and the enemy has refused ti even talk 
about peace. So one alternatiae is to sur-
render. That would make the United 
States the paper tiger of our time, and 
it would also result in turning over all 
of southeast Asia to the Communists. 
The ultimate results of such action on 
our part is horrible to even contemplate. 
Mr. Chairman, we have a mother al-
ternative?an alternative which the ap-
peasers ignore. That alternative is to 
win, and that is what this leaislation is 
designed to help us accomplish. 
Mr. Chairman, despite the fact that 
the United States has been bemoaned 
and cursed and attacked at home and 
abroad--and I especially refer to those 
attacks at home with reference to the 
demonstrations which are designed to do 
everything they can to defeat he United 
States?despite this fact the United 
States ts still the "Real McCoy." Despite 
all of the anvil choruses denouncing the 
United States and demandina that we 
surrender, the fact of the matter is that 
we are still there, arid do not plan to 
surrender until peace is secured. Also, 
despite the fact that we have made many, 
many errors?no question abtiut that?
in our military planning, and timing, I 
have never yet seen and I do not be-
lieve anyone has ever seen American 
troops any braver, more dedicated, and 
more patriotic than those which are par-
ticipating in the conflict in South Viet-
nam. 
Mr. Chairman, I have been over there 
several times, and I have talked to many 
of our American troops. I want to say 
that at no time have I found one man 
who was not proud that he was an Amer-
ican and proud of the job he as doing. 
They did ask the question as to why we 
did not try to win. They asked the ques-
tion as to why Americans were demon-
strating against their county. They 
could not understand with all that Amer-
ica means to the world, all of t he great-
ness of America; they could not under-
stand why our own people would bitterly 
attack America for its effort unselfishly 
being made in Vietnam. 
Mr. Chairman, I heard that question 
raised many times. I went to the hos-
pitals and talked with dozens of young 
men and boys there. I talked to men 
who had an arm off or a leg off. At no 
time did I hear one man comr lain. He 
was proud he was an American. 
Mr. Chairman, the only questions they 
were asking were what are we doing to 
win on the home:front, and in by these 
anti-American demonstrations are tak-
ing place in America. 
Now, Mr. Chairman, the GI in Vietnam 
has only one thing in his mind; that is, 
that the United States may win, and I 
deeply hope that in some way these 
wounded American patriots can transfer 
that patriotism; that same will to win 
to the homefront. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield such time as he may 
consume to the gentleman from New 
York [Mr. FARBSTEIN]. 
(Mr. FARBSTEIN asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. FARBSTEIN. Mr. Chairman, in 
the past, I have expressed reservation 
about some of the administration's ac-
tions in Vietnam. Recently, I joined a 
number of other Representatives in urg-
ing the President, among other things, 
to deescalate our military efforts in Viet-
nam as a further effort to bring the war 
from the battlefield to the conference 
table. I still feel no good can come from 
further escalation and do not wish this 
vote to be considered otherwise. I desire 
to create a climate leading to the confer-
ence table. 
Today we are faced with the task of 
voting on an appropriation for $4.8 bil-
lion for Vietnam. Each Member must do 
some soul searching before casting his 
vote. I, for one, have carefully reviewed 
my predilections and balanced them 
with the Nation's well-being. 
American boys are committing their 
lives and honor to this fight in the Far 
East. These young men must not be de-
prived of equipment, necessary hospitals, 
medical treatment, essential supplies, 
and helicopters needed to help them sur-
vive in this jungle war. The Congress, 
regardless of any reservations and unan-
swered questions on administration pol-
icy, must not fail to grant the funds to 
supply these brave men. I do not desire 
to be in the position of turning my back 
on our young men who are presently sac-
rificing their lives in Vietnam. 
On the scale, I find I must vote in 
favor of the appropriation. 
Mr. PIRNIE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
myself 5 minutes. 
Mr. Chairman, the hearings that pre-
ceded the approval of H.R. 12889 by the 
Armed Services Committee represented 
a very earnest effort by our members to 
determine the urgent needs of our mili-
tary and to support them by this bill. 
We are aware of the scope of our in-
volvement in southeast Asia and wish 
to provide what is required to achieve 
victory at the earliest possible time. 
It is apparent that as yet our full 
military capabilities have not been em-
ployed in Vietnam nor have we followed 
the strategy that full military consider-
ations would dictate. We trust that our 
actions are understood to reflect, our de-
sire to resolve the differences by Peace-
ful means. However, there ia a real 
danger that our enemies will exoloit our 
restraint through propaganda designed 
to create the impression we are losing 
the war, know we cannot win, and are 
plagued by disunity on the hoinefront. 
Certain events and actions might tend 
to give credence to such claims but our 
debate here today is not one of them. 
We are here attesting that we are de-
termined to win and will meet the needs 
of our forces in their effort to do so. We

on the committee have asked our service 
chiefs and department heads to tell us 
what they required and by this legisla-
tion we are seeking to meet their needs 
in full. 
I have been disturbed that certain 
items have been transferred from the 
fiscal 1967 program without any real as-
surance that procurement will be so ac-
celerated that inclusion in this bill is 
necessary. To the extent such technique 
is employed, it does not have my ap-
proval. However, I have found it diffi-
cult to remove this criticism without in 
some way interfering with sound objec-
tives. Therefore, I rely upon the good 
faith which must be implicit in the un-
derlying request. 
Another important element in this 
legislation is the provision for ,military 
construction totaling over $11/4 billion. 
Our involvement in southeast Asia 
necessitates prompt action to provide 
needed facilities in support of supply, 
housing and hospital operations. Al-
though many of the items have been 
specified, the bill makes available to the 
Secretary of Defense an additional $200 
million for expeditious accomplishment 
of emergency contruction needed to 
meet any crisis which might develop. It 
is proposed that this authority will be 
fully funded. 
This bill will appeal to all as a timely, 
and we hope adequate, response to needs 
paramount in our thinking. We trust 
none shall misread our intent. Our de-
termination to achieve our valid objec-
tives in Vietnam is clear and in this spirit 
we support H.R. 12889. 
The action we take today will have an 
impact on our fighting men. Too fre-
quently the headlines suggest confusion 
or division on the home front. This is 
detrimental to their morale and makes 
their task more difficult. We can be 
sure that our support of this measure will 
furnish unmistakable evidence that this 
House will respond to their needs 
promptly and completely. 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, 
will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. PIRNIE. I yield to the gentle-
man. 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. It is my im-
pression and the impression, I believe, 
of others that the French lost the war 
over there not an the battlefield but in 
Paris. Would the gentleman agree with 
that? 
Mr. PIRNIE. There is reason to be-
lieve that is true. But we certainly have 
something more working in our favor as 
compared with the French. 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. Yes, I certainly 
hope that is true. But the French 
soldiers over there were left with nothing 
to fight with because of decisions re. 
suiting from agitation and dissent in 
their capital city of Paris. Is that not 
true and is it not so that that resulted 
in their defeat? 
Mr. PIRNIE. I hope that history will 
not repeat itself insofar as our effort and 
our operations are concerned. 
Mr. CUNNINGHAM. We must give 
our fighting men every support on the 
battlefield and I commend the gentle-
man on his statement and certainly agree 
with him. 
Mr. PIRNIE. I thank the gentleman. 
(Mr. PIRNIE asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. HEBERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
8 minutes to the gentleman from Vir-
ginia I Mr. Many] . 
Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, there is 
no doubt in my mind that this bill is es-
sential to the support of all of our forces 
in Vietnam. 
I have visited Vietnam in the recent 
past and have seen the construction at 
Da Nang, Chu Lai, and Cam Ranh Bay 
and at a number of other locations. I 
was very pleased by the construction ac-
tivities that I saw, In fact, I made par-
ticular note of my feelings in this regard 
when Defense Department construction 
witnesses were before the committee. 
This is not to say that I am completely 
happy about the form of this present bill. 
The bill authorizes construction in a 
number of different areas as will be seen 
from pages 17 and 18 of the report. 
There is construction in the Philippines, 
Guam, at Midway and Wake Islands and 
about $63 million worth of construction 
right here in the United States. And, in-
cidentally, that U.S. construction is set 
out by State and installation on page 26 
of the report. 
The majority of the construction in 
this bill, over $736 million worth, is in 
Vietnam itself. The construction pro-
gram involves almost every type from 
training facilities to ammunition stor-
age. Some of it is for the Navy, some 
of it is for the Air Force and the largest 
part, some $407 million, is for the Army. 
We have a lot of people in Vietnam and 
maybe we will have more in the not too 
distant future. These people have to 
have, in great part, much the same kind 
of facilities that they would have to have 
here in the United States. They have to 
have barracks, hospitals, airfields, fuel 
and ammunition storage, and every other 
kind of facility which is a normal part of 
a military operation. I guess food and 
weapons come first in priority, but phys-
ical facilities such as I have named run a 
very close second. And we have got to 
provide them. 
Of course, there are special problems 
involved in construction in a place like 
Vietnam. Vietnam is an undeveloped 
country, and any kind of logistic support 
is difficult. 
Right now, there is only one major 
port, Saigon. Transportation within the 
country is practically nonexistent. Sim-
ply stated, there was nothing in Vietnam 
for us to start with as there would be in 
a developed country. We have to provide 
everything ourselves. We have to pro-
vide port and warehouse facilities. We 
have to construct roads, and all of this 
has to be done under the most difficult 
circumstances and, obviously, at costs 
that are much greater than they would 
be here in the United States. 
Notwithstanding a full appreciation of 
these difficulties, I think I should say, as 
I mentioned a moment ago, that I was 
not at all pleased with the way the De-
partment presented the construction pro-
gram for this bill. I am against any kind 
of blank check to the Department of De-
fense. And I am not alone in this. 
Many members of the committee feel the 
same way. But that is the kind of pro-
gram that was handed to us in commit-
tee. I tried as hard as I could to keep 
some congressional control, realizing the 
difficulty in predetermining exactly what 
was going to be built where, and haw 
much it was going to cost. I know that 
General Westmoreland needs to have a 
good bit of flexibility. I know he cannot 
predict the exact course of this war and 
for this very reason he cannot predict 
exactly where he is going to need a par-
ticular facility or the exact cost of it. 
Notwithstanding these understandable 
difficulties, the Congress, in my mind, has 
a responsibility to see to it that it keeps 
itself informed as to just how our funds 
are being spent. 
It was with this in mind that I offered 
an amendment in committee which now 
appears as section 401(b) of the bill. The 
department has contended that this lan-
guage is too rigid?that it will cause de-
lays. I do not think the problem is as 
great as they contend. But anyway we 
have agreed on substitute language which 
I think will serve the purposes I had in 
mind about as well as the original lan-
guage. 
The new language which is in the 
form of a committee amendment and 
will be offered by your chairman reads 
as follows: 
The Secretary of Defense shall furnish to 
the Committees on Armed Services of the 
Senate and House of Representatives a de-
scription of all construction projects, in-
cluding cost estimates and periodic reports, 
made available to the Secretary of Defense 
simultaneously with the receipt of such in-
formation from the persons responsible for 
the construction of such projects in sup-
port of Vietnamese and other free world 
forces in Vietnam. Whenever such construc-
tion projects, involving $1,000,000 or more, 
are performed by private contractors, the 
Secretary of Defense or his representative 
in Vietnam shall report to -the Committees 
on Armed Services of the Senate and House 
of Representatives the name or names of 
such private contractors. The amounts in-
volved in each contract a copy of the report 
in support of each progress payment, and 
a complete report prior to final payment. 
The new language still does not pro-
vide an ideal situation but it will enable 
us to keep our finger on the construction 
program. 
I want to stress that I have no doubt 
as to actual need for this construction, 
but I want to know and I think that 
you and I have a right to know just what 
is being done and how it is being done. 
Mr. FASCELL. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
in support of the pending bill, H.H. 12889, 
authorizing appropriations for equip-
ment, materiel, construction, and other 
purposes in support, primarily, of our 
effort in Vietnam. 
Our fighting men are engaged in one 
of the bloodiest, dirtiest, most brutal 
conflicts ever witnessed. It is the re-
sponsibility of this Congress to provide 
full support promptly for all equipment, 
materiel, and facilities which will aid in 
saving the lives of our fighting men and 
hasten a successful conclusion of our ef-
fort in Vietnam. 
I strongly endorse this legislation for 
weapons procurement and other pur-
poses in full support of our commitment

in Vietnam, Just as I voted for the re-
cently adopted supplemental authoriza-
tion for economic aid and assistance. As 
have previously stated, the military 
effort and the economic effort in Viet-
nam are inseparable policy of the United 
States in dealing with the problem of 
Vietnam and southeast Asia. 
I also support this resolution as a logi-
cal supplement of the policy decision 
made by the Congress in 1964 in the 
adoption of House Joint Resolution 1145, 
which authorized the President to take 
all necessary steps including the use of 
armed forces, since we regard as vital to 
our national interest and to world peace 
the maintenance of international peace 
and security in Vietnam and in south-
east Asia. 
A vote for this legislation today is a 
vote to support our fighting forces, a vote 
to support previously adopted congres-
sional policy, and support for the Presi-
dent of the United States and the poli-
cies of this country in the critical con-
flict in Vietnam. Some might have 
doubts; others might have reservations; 
we may debate our respective positions; 
but support of this legislation is sup-
port for the policy of President Johnson. 
We ought to overwhelmingly support 
this legislation because it is the right 
Wing to do and the only thing to do. 
I. congratulate the distinguished chair-
man from South Carolina IMr. MyEris], 
and the members of the Armed Services 
Committee who have brought this legis-
lation to the floor. They have given it 
the most thorough consideration, and yet 
have acted expeditiously on a matter of 
We most urgent need. The whole ques-
tion of Vietnam has been discussed, re-
viewed. and debated very thoroughly in 
the halls of this Congress. On the For-
eign Affairs Committee, of which I am a 
member, we have been meeting and hold-
ing hearings on this subject almost daily 
since we reconvened this year. Both in 
subcommittee and full committee, we 
will, as other legislation comes before us, 
particularly the foreign aid authoriza-
tion bill, debate Vietnam and other world 
issues for many weeks and months dur-
ing the balance of this session. There 
have been discussions and debate on pre-
vious days on this floor just as there is 
today. Everyone has had ample oppor-
tunity to project his viewpoint, to criti-
cize, to support, or to say what he has to 
say on behalf of himself and his con-
stituents. 
Notwithstanding voices of dissent, 
and I do not discourage proper dissent, it 
is clear that by vote after vote in this 
body, the overwhelming number of repre-
sentatives of the people of this country, 
in carrying out the desires of their con-
stituents, have time and again supported 
the President of the United States and 
the policies of this country as they apply 
to Vietnam. 
also suport this resolution because I 
am opposed to unilateral withdrawal by 
the United States from Vietnam. Such 
a course of action is unthinkable surren-
der, and would accomplish nothing, while 
its results would be disastrous. There 
are those who maintain that we have no 
business in Vietnam at all. I disagree 
with this viewpoint because we Amen-
cans have learned the bitter lessons of 
two world wars when aggression is al-
lowed to succeed. Aggression under any 
name, technique, or strategy must not 
succeed. Nevertheless in determining 
our policy course and in support of this 
legislation whether the United States 
should be in Vietnam is almost moot. 
We must face the facts of life is they are. 
The fact is that the United States is 
committed in Vietnam in principle, in 
manpower, and in materiel.. We are 
committed by treaty, the pledges of three 
Presidents of the United States, a joint 
resolution of the Congress, and other 
declarations. We have approximately 
250,000 men in southeast Asia, and the 
prospects seem apparent that we may 
have 400,000 or more, if necessary. By 
way of comparison I note that at the 
peak of the conflict in Korea. we had 
327,000 men. there. Our expenditures for 
Vietnam are at the rate of $21/2 billion 
a year and climbing steadily. With these 
facts, I find very little comfort; or logic 
in the argument which alleges that the 
United States should not be in Vietnam 
for political reasons, military reasons, 
moral and humanitarian reasons, or that 
the United States is there illegally; or 
that the United States should not be 
there because this is a Vietnamese prob-
lem; an Asian problem; a problem for 
the United Nations: or a problem of 
someone else. 
Another blunt fact is that there is no 
doubt in my mind that South Vietnam 
is and has been fighting for its life 
against a brutal campaign of terror and 
armed attack inspired, directed, sup-
plied, and controlled by the Communist 
regime in Hanoi. Vietcong', National 
Liberation Front, or any other group of 
alleged or real indigenous dissent to the 
contrary, the fact remains that there is 
a determined aggressive and violent cam-
paign to take over the government and 
the people. et South Vietnam. General 
Giap, leader of the North Vietnamese 
Army recently said: 
If the special warfare that the 'U.S. im-
perialists are testing in South Vietnam is 
overcome then it can be defeated everywhere 
in the world. 
In other words, if the United States 
wins in Vietnam, we will have effectively 
destroyed the new technique of aggres-
sion, the so-called wars of national lib-
eration. Vietnam therefore is a big test 
of the Communist strategy of a; gression. 
The United States has in vain sought 
to substitute words for bullets. We have 
talked to every nation in the world; we 
have gone to the United Nations; we 
have temporarily ceased bombings; we 
have made it clear that we di not in-
tend to use more force than is necessary; 
and yet?we have had no favorable re-
sponse from the National Liberation 
Front, the Vietcong, the North Vietnam-
ese, the Red Chinese, or anybody else. 
The reasan it seems to me that we have 
had no response is that the enemy thinks 
that the United States and its allies will 
tire of this fight and that they, the en-
emy, therefore can win it. 
It seems to me that we cannot fail or 
unilaterally pull out of South Vietnam 
without dire consequences. 
The people of South Vietnam are fight-
ing for self-determination, a principle 
we strongly believe in. Therefore, the 
South Vietnamese ought to have that 
right without any infringement or inter-
ference by the North Vietnamese, the 
Red Chinese, or anybody else. 
By our action here today we will make 
it clear to the world that the majority of 
Americans support our strong military 
help to the people of South Vietnam to 
resist subversion and foreign military 
intervention plotted, directed, and sup-
plied from the north; and snake sure 
that the Communist doctrines of guer-
rilla warfare and wars of national lib-
eration will not succeed against the de-
termined people with firm allies. 
We seek an end of the war by nego-
tiation or other honorable means not in 
conflict with our obligations. I support 
our efforts to do so. I also support the 
purpose of moving on as rapidly as pos-
sible with the more constructive task of 
laying foundations for a better future 
for all the people of southeast Asia. 
But our fighting men know why they 
are fighting in South Vietnam and they 
need our support. U.S. Army Capt. 
James Spruill, who was killed in Vietnam 
just last April, recorded his own convic-
tion on Vietnam in simple and eloquent 
words in one of his letters. I quote a 
passage: 
Above all, this is a war of mind and spirit. 
And it is a war which can be won no matter 
what present circumstances are. For us to 
despair would be a great victory for the en-
emy. We mast stand strong and unafraid 
and give heart to an embattled and confused 
people. This cannot be done il America 
loses heart. At the moment my heart is big 
enough to sustain those around me. Please 
don't let them back where you are sell me 
down the river with talk of despair and de-
feat. Talk instead of steadfastness, loyalty, 
and victory?for we must and we can win 
here. There is no backing out of Vietnam, 
for it will follow us everywhere we go. We 
have drawn the line here and the America 
we all know and love best is not or to back 
away. 
Mr. Chairman, I urge unanimous ap-
proval of this vital Presidential request, 
because the United States must perse-
vere. 
Mr. EDWARDS of California. Mr. 
Chairman, I would like to be announced 
as for the $4.8 billion supplemental ap-
propriation for Vietnam, although I have 
opposed and will continue to oppose the 
policies that have made this appropria-
tion necessary. I support the appropria-
tion because our men in Vietnam are the 
victims of that policy and they must have 
the support they need. 
I believe that the President eincerely 
wants peace, but I also believe that peace 
is unattainable unless the assumptions 
upon which our current Far Eastern 
policy is based are drastically changed. 
Specifically, if we continue to treat every 
Chinese move as a major threat to world 
peace, our panic policies will serve to 
translate that potential into action which 
will endanger not only Asia, but the en-
tire world. 
There is evidence that China, despite 
her bellicose statements and her harsh 
and cruel internal life, is cautious in deed 
if not in word. It is clear that she has 
a paranoid fear of being attacked and 
Approved For Release 2005/07/13 : CIA-RDP67600446R000400050008-5 
Approved Fie6?eayABFA01/ikaryDPk7(98q46R000400050008-5 
March .1, 1966 4273 
this fear can only be intensified by U.S. 
efforts to encircle China. The Chinese 
have developed a nuclear capability that 
may soon be operational. Therefore, 
China must begin to share?along with 
the other great powers?the responsibil-
ity of keeping the peace and protecting 
the integrity of other nations. 
Our success in containing Russian ex-
pansion since World War Ills insufficient 
argument for applying exactly the same 
policy in Asia. We have forgotten that 
that policy of containment was estab-
lished among nations sharing our tradi-
tions and values, who had sufficient 
wealth and wisdom to maintain their 
own independence, and who had a demo-
cratic foundation to sustain the ideals 
that we were defending. But we cannot 
defend freedom and democracy in south-
east Asia the same way we did in Europe 
precisely because Asia is not Europe. 
Much of southeast Asia is anti-Chinese; 
but, because of its immediate colonialist 
background, it is also anti-Western?
perhaps more so. 
Unfortunately, the people of south-
east Asia do not yet have the institutions, 
the training or the leadership to make 
Western democracy work?no matter 
how much we insist and no matter how 
much we help. But, they do not want to 
be pawns in a forever shifting cold war. 
They want more than anything else to be 
left alone?left alone by the Chinese and, 
more importantly, by us. They want no 
entangling alliance, no binding treaties, 
and, no depreciation of their already 
meager resources through war. 
It would appear that a sound Asia poli-
cy would be to foster the neutrality of 
southeast Asia and do all we can to help 
bring China into the community of na-
tions so that her fears of the West, and 
of the United States particularly, could 
be brought to the level of rational dis-
cussion. 
This cannot be done so long as we are 
forcing her hand through attempting to-
beat North Vietnam into diplomatic sub-
mission. This can only be done through 
the relaxation of tensions in southeast 
Asia, through a negotiated settlement in 
South Vietnam and through the peaceful 
and faithful implementation of such a 
settlement. 
We must, I believe, be ready to sit with 
the Vietcong at the conference table and 
to allow them participation in the future 
political life of South Vietnam. And we 
must stop the bombing of North Vietnam 
lest we draw in China and destroy hope 
for peace in that region of the world. 
I anounce myself as for this measure 
because I don't want to see our boys die 
In the wrong war, at the wrong time, in 
the wrong place for lack of domestic 
support. But I would hope that our ef-
forts for peace in southeast Asia would 
be intensified to end not only that war 
but also the threat of world war III. 
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair recog-
nizes the gentleman from Louisiana [Mr. 
HEBERT]. 
Mr. HEBERT. Mr. Chairman, I 
should like now to discuss the Army's 
fiscal year 1966 supplemental program 
for procurement of aircraft, missiles, and 
No. 36-17 
tracked combat vehicles, for which au-
thorization is requested under the pro-
visions of section 412b, Public Law 86-
149, as amended. 
This program has as its principal ob-
jective the availability of military hard-
ware to equip the Army. Because of the 
expansion of the Army's operations in 
Vietnam during the past year, equipment 
shortfalls will occur unless procurement 
actions are continued in several com-
modity areas. 
The supplemental request reflects 
Army plans to make heavy current-year 
investments, especially in long leadtime 
Items, to sustain our buildup in south-
east Asia, to permit orderly expansion of 
the Army to authorized force levels, and 
to replenish inventories reduced by draw-
downs resulting from increased combat 
consumption or new unit activations. 
Authorization is requested, under the 
fiscal year 1966 PEMA, supplemental 
budget submission, for $825.6 million for 
aircraft and aircraft spares and repair 
parts; $64.0 million for missiles and mis-
sile spares and repair parts, and $75.8 
million for tracked combat vehicles. 
This is the first time that tracked combat 
vehicles have been included as a separate 
budget activity, and the first time for 
which special congressional authoriza-
tion has been required. 
AIRCRAFT 
The budget figure of $825.6 million for 
aircraft and aircraft spares and repair 
parts represents approximately 34 per-
cent?slightly more than one-third?of 
the total PEMA request of $2,465 million. 
The aircraft category is second only to 
the ammunition category in projected 
dollar outlay, and reflects the continued 
emphasis on the role of Army aircraft 
in support of both combat and logistical 
operations in Vietnam. 
Funds budgeted under the fiscal year 
1966 supplemental estimate will permit 
inventory add-ons to aircraft which are 
urgently needed to enhance combat ca-
pabilities in Vietnam, assist in meeting 
deployment schedules, and pay back, 
with preferred items, drawdowns from 
reserve assets. 
Additional buys of the CH-47A cargo 
transport helicopter?Chinook?and 
UH-1B/D tactical utility helicopter?
Iroquois?are projected. These are 
the workhorses of Army air operations 
In Vietnam. The Army also plans to fi-
nance the initial PEMA procurement of 
the CH-54A heavy lift helicopter?Fly-
ing Crane?and to expedite procure-
ment of the OH-6A observation helicop-
ter?Pawnee?to replace several mar-
ginally adequate aircraft types cur-
rently in use in Vietnam. Additional 
procurements of helicopter trainers and 
fixed-wing surveillance aircraft are also 
evisioned. 
Other costs relate to the modification 
or retrofit of in-service aircraft, $16.6 
million; ground and support equipment, 
$16 million; component improvement, 
$2.1 million; production base support, 
$2.2 million, and first destination trans-
portation, $0.2 million. Included is 
$220.9 million for accelerated require-
ments of aircraft spares and repair parts. 
MISSILES 
The $64 million estimate for missiles 
and missile spares and repair parts rep-
resents 2.6 percent of the total PEMA 
submission. The projected funding is 
to cover costs of replacing Hawk air de-
fense equipment connected with south-
east Asia deployments and for providing 
similar equipment to support new unit 
activations. No new missiles are in-
cluded. The estimate for missile spares 
and repair parts is $28.5 million. 
TRACKED COMBAT VEHICLES 
For tracked combat vehicles the sup-
plemental request comprises approxi-
mately 3 percent of the overall PEMA 
total. Estimated costs, in almost all 
cases, are related to the replacement of 
combat losses or the equipping of new 
units. Approximately $22.8 million is 
projected for add-ons of self-propelled 
artillery and mortar carriers, to include 
the 155 millimeter medium howitzer, 
M109; the 8-inch heavy howitzer; M110; 
the 175 millimeter field artillery gun, 
M107, and the 81 and 107 millimeter 
mortar carriers, M125A1 and M106A1. 
Some $9 million is included for additional 
buys of the full-tracked cargo carrier, 
M548; the command post carrier, 
M577A1, and the light armored recov-
ery vehicle, M578. A total of $44 million 
is also budgeted for repair parts and 
support materiel. 
Mr. Chairman, I support the unani-
mous recommendation of the House, 
Armed Services Committee that the 
Army's fiscal year 66 supplemental re-
quest for missiles, aircraft, and tracked 
combat vehicles be approved and I rec-
ommend its favorable consideration by 
this body. 
(Mr. HEBERT asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HEBERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
to the gentleman from Florida [Mr. 
BENNETT] such time as he may consume. 
Mr. BENNETT. Mr. Chairman, I rise 
In strong support of this legislation and 
its implications of backing the Presi-
dent in his efforts to bring about world 
peace in our time and security and free-
dom throughout the world. 
Mr. Chairman, this bill is a carefully 
drafted piece of legislation and should 
have the support of every Member of 
Congress. It will provide the tools now 
necessary to pursue our objectives in 
South Vietnam. I am happy to support 
the President and the troops 100 percent 
in this noble effort to preserve freedom 
and stop aggression. 
Our President has said: 
To know war is to know that there is still 
madness in this world. 
The truth of this is borne out in South 
Vietnam. There we are vigorously re-
sponding to the requests of the local 
government to assist in preserving the 
independence of that tiny nation. 
In so doing we are upholding the non-
aggression and freedom-seeking objec-
tives of the southeast Asia collective 
defense treaty, approved by the over-
whelming vote of our Senate, 82 to 1. We 
are also following the overwhelmingly ap-

proved resolution of the entire Congress 
in support of our national efforts there, 
allowing the use of armed force" to 
assist South Vietnam upon its request 
for "assistance in defense of its free-
dom." 
Yet the whole matter could come to an 
end and bloodshed could cease and the 
avowed objectives of most of mankind 
could be achieved if?as President John-
son suggested in his latest state of the 
Union speech?everyone would "stand by 
the Geneva agreements of 1954 and 
1962." We are willing to do so. 
These agreements are certainly reason-
able, providing as they do for free elec-
tions and local self-determination. If 
in fact North Vietnam and the comma-
1st world have confidence in the popu-
larity of their cause, their aggressions 
in South Vietnam should come to an 
immediate halt; and we could proceed 
together to bolster up the local govern-
ment of South Vietnam with free elec-
tions and assured independence. 
Our own Government has sent, 
throughout the world, topflight repre-
sentatives seeking to find some channel 
to bring peace while preserving the in-
dependence of South Vietnam in fulfill-
ment of the accords of Geneva. 
It is appalling that thousands of per-
sons are losing their lives and billions 
of dollars are being expended in the 
machinations of war, when these lives 
and these treasures?both of life and 
of materials?could be much better spent 
in the forward progress of mankind. 
These thoughts all underline the 
statement of the President: 
know war is to know that there is still 
madness in this world. 
Nevertheless the responsibilities are 
on our shoulders at this time and we 
must fulfill them to the best of our 
ability, as disagreeable and as tragic as 
they may appear from time to time. 
When I spoke in Jacksonville on 
May 30, 1964, Memorial Day of that year, 
1 said something about the Vietnam War 
which I think is appropriate to repeat 
at this time. I said: 
Under these circumstances we, the Amer-
ican people, should be careful that partisan 
political considerations have nothing to do 
with the decisions that must be made, and 
we should be in constant prayer that what-
ever decisions are made are in the best in-
terests of the country and of mankind gen-
erally. 
As I conclude my remarks I would like 
to give you an analogy which seems fit-
ting: in the world of business, no busi-
nessman would put great responsibilities 
on the shoulders of his office boy. He 
would not send that inexperienced lad 
to conclude some important contract 
transactions or any other deed of large 
proportions. In the troubled times of 
1956, it is true that our country has these 
grave responsibilities of which we all are 
soberly thinking today. 
But if we believe, as I am sure we all 
do, that there is a God in heaven, he 
earely would not be giving us, in these 
Limes, these responsibilities unless he 
Lhought that we were indeed capable of 
fulfilling, them. 
So, although our tasks may be hard 
and the sacrifices great, I share with 
you the hope that we will each here today 
take courage and rededicate ourselves 
not only to our beloved Nation, but to the 
highest of human principles: sharing as 
we must these great responsibilities 
called forth by the challenging times in 
which we live.

permission to revise and extend his re-

Mr. HEBERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
4 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York {Mr. STRATTON 1. 
Mr. EDMONDSON. Mr. Chairman, 
will the gentleman yield to mc? 
Mr. STRATTON. I am glad to yield 
to the gentleman from Oklahoma. 
Mr. EDMONDSON. Mr. Chairman, I 
support this bill and commend the com-
mittee for bringing it to the floor of the 
House, with full provision for all recog-
nized needs of our Armed Forces in south-
east Asia. 
The fight being waged in South Viet-
nam is a fight for freedom. In the long 
run, it is also a fight for peace, for no 
real peace will be possible for men any-
where unless; the forces of aggression are 
stopped in southeast Asia. 
I cannot conceive of any action by the 
Congress that would do more to encour-
age aggression, in all parts of he world, 
than the defeat of this measure. The 
evidence that Congress was not prepared 
to back its Armed. Forces with the sup-
plies and equipment needed to carry out 
our policies?which defeat of this bill 
would mean to the world?would under-
mine the faith of every friend and ally 
we have It would also encourage the 
enemies of freedom to embark on new 
conquests and invasions all over the 
world. 
On the other hand, overwhelming ap-
proval of this bill will demonstrate our 
determination to do all that is necessary 
to back our men and to provide them 
with what they need to do their difficult 
and dangerous duty in Vietnam. 
I hope and trust the bill will be over-
whelmingly approved. 
(Mr. EDMONDSON asked and was 
given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks. :i 
Mr. STRATTON. Mr. Chairman, I 
rise in support of this bill. It is a simple 
bill. It simply represents a recognition 
of the requests of our fighting services 
for what they need to do the job to which 
our servicemen are presently committed 
in Vietnam. And I think we have no 
alternative in this body except to support 
this legislation. 
I have been a little concerned by those 
Members of this House and of the other 
body who have suggested that one can 
support this bill today without support-
ing the policy of our Government. That, 
to me, is nonsense, self -delusion. What 
is Congress supposed to do in a fighting 
situation anyway? 
We do not make decisions on strategy. 
We do not consult with the commanders 
in the field at every point. Rather we 
pass authorization bills, like this one. 
We pass appropriation bills. That is 
what we have done before with regard 
to Vietnam, and that is what we are 
doing again today. Obviously we are 
supporting the policy of our Government 
in this legislation, a policy of resisting 
the spread of communism in southeast 
Asia and thereby proving to the Com-
munist aggressors that aggression does 
not pay. 
I would submit, Mr. Chairman, that it 
just is not possible to have it both ways: 
either you support that policy of our 
Government or else you are against it. 
And you vote today registers your posi-
tion on that vital question. 
Mr. Chairman, what we are facing 
today in South Vietnam represents in my 
judgment a very serious test, indeed an 
acid test, in our history as a government. 
As the majority leader indicated a 
moment ago, it is a showdown test of our 
ability as a democracy to survive the 
continuing challenge of communism. 
People in Communist countries have 
said that we are paper tigers?not be-
cause they do not recognize that we have 
bigger bombs or greater carriers or more 
planes than do the enemy countries, but 
because they are convinced that when 
the chips are down, we in America just 
do not have the courage to see things 
through. 
It is about time that we recognize that, 
whether we like it or not, we are in a 
fighting war in Vietnam and that we 
must give to our fighting forces and to 
the administration, which has been pur-
suing a policy backed by the overwhelm-
ing votes of this Congress and the people, 
the support that they deserve and should 
have. 
Debate is a good thing in a democracy. 
But even in a democracy there must 
come a time when debate ends and when 
we get behind the decision that has been 
taken and back up our men on the fight-
ing fronts. That is what this bill does, 
Mr. Chairman, and that is what the com-
panion appropriation bill will do when 
it, too, comes to this floor. 
The time has come now for us to put 
an end to further harassment of our Viet-
nam policy, to these attacks on our 
policy, these proposals which seem to 
come forward every day or so, of sonic 
new concessions that somebody thinks we 
ought to make to the Communists to 
somehow lure them to the negotiating 
table. 
This is. a time now for national unity. 
Let us not forget that it was President 
Kennedy who describe the Communist 
method of negotiation by saying, "What 
is mine is mine, and what is yours is 
negotiable." 
That's what the Communists are trying 
to do in Vietnam. That is what our 
forces out there are trying to prevent. 
Let us support them, not add to their 
burdens and problems. 
I say, Mr. Chairman, it is time for us 
to have a little confidence in our Armed 
Forces, to have a little unity in support 
of our policy. As President Johnson 
indicated in the White House briefing 
the other day, no politician ever gets 
elected by constantly predicting his own 
defeat. The question in Vietnam is

whether we can prove to the Communists 
and to the world our determination, our 
patience, and our fortitude under pres-
sure. Let us put an end to these doubts 
and fears that undermine our will and 
our resolution, and let this House join 
now in an overwhelming expression of 
confidence in our policy and confidence 
in our Armed Forces. 
Mr. BATES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
12 minutes to the distinguished gentle-
man from Michigan [Mr. CHAMBERLAIN]. 
(Mr. CHAMBERLAIN asked and was 
given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. CHAMBERLAIN. Mr. Chairman, 
I rise in support of H.R. 12889 and say 
to my colleagues that this bill should not 
only pass, but it should pass with an 
overwhelming vote. This would serve 
notice on the world that when it comes 
to supporting our servicemen, who are 
defending freedom wherever challenged, 
that the American people are ready, will-
ing, and able to provide whatever they 
may need to carry out their missions. 
This legislation was approved by the 
Armed Services Committee, as the ac-
companying report states, "solely in or-
der to achieve more rapid procurement 
of replacements of articles consumed, 
and to provide proper equipment for a 
larger force in a shorter period of time." 
But, Mr. Chairman, I would like to call 
the attention of my colleagues to the 
reservations expressed by the committee 
on page 3 of the report regarding the 
necessity for this legislation. I cannot 
but have the feeling?which you will note 
from the report is shared by most mem-
bers of our committee?that many of the 
Items involved in this legislation may 
simply have been removed from the regu-
lar 1967 authorization to this supple-
mental 1966 authorization without any 
real program for acceleration. I am not 
satisfied that the actual need for this 
legislation has been sufficiently estab-
lished and that the procurement of 
essential items will, in fact, be appre-
ciably accelerated by the enactment of 
this bill today. 
Again, Mr. Chairman, I would refer 
my colleagues to the language of the 
report on page 3 wherein it is stated 
that: 
Testimony on this subject was indecisive 
and the committee has not yet been pro-
vided with sufficient definitive data to pin-
point the exact degree of real acceleration, 
or to determine the amounts involved in the 
proposed legislation which could safely and 
should properly be deferred until the regular 
1967 authorization. 
So, as you read this report, which I 
remind you again was a unanimous re-
port, it is certainly not unfair to conclude 
that the Department of Defense has 
failed to sustain the burden of proof 
with respect to the necessity for this 
supplemental authorization and that, 
being realistic, we are participating in 
a substantial bookkeeping exercise that 
obviously offers little military advantage. 
In saying this, however, I do not mean 
to infer that what has been asked for in 
support of our troops will not be needed 
within the time frame of the budget for 
fiscal year 1967 which will be before the 
House for approval within the next few 
months. It is for this reason that I have 
no hesitation in my support for this bill. 
But as I said at the outset of my remarks, 
I nonetheless feel that by our actions 
today we should let our voices be heard 
loud and clear so all may know that we 
are going to provide our troops in the 
field with whatever they may need in 
supporting the interests of our Govern-
ment and our determination to resist 
communistic aggression at this crucial 
hour. 
Now, Mr. Chairman, if I may, I would 
like to use the balance of my time to 
make two other points. While they may 
not be directly related to the legislation 
before us, they certainly have a vital 
bearing on the conduct of the war in 
Vietnam. 
My second point is simply this: Our 
concern today in seeking to provide all 
the supplies necessary to our troops 
should not be permitted to pass without 
drawing attention to the similar prob-
lems confronting our enemy. Ho Chi 
Minh is dedicated to a policy of total 
victory. Anything that the Hanoi re-
gime needs and is denied cannot help 
but put roadblocks in their path to the 
south. The traffic of free world ships 
into North Vietnamese ports, regardless 
as to whether their cargoes are Com-
munist or free world, strategic or non-
strategic, simply must be stopped. Our 
governmental policy has clearly been too 
tolerant of this free world assistance to 
our enemy. The administration's in-
difference has created a leadership vac-
uum which the maritme unions have re-
cently sought to fill through independent 
action because of this apparent tacit 
abdication of this aspect of foreign pol-
icy to private effort. Bills exist in Con-
gress which would do what the maritme 
unions seek to acocmplish, but the ad-
ministration has shown only a negative 
interest. Regardless of official efforts to 
depreciate the importance of this trade, 
I simply cannot comprehend how the tol-
erance of even one free world ship in 
the harbor of Haiphong can be justified. 
Now, in January of this year there was, 
in fact, a decided increase in this traffic 
over the previous month. The Depart-
ment of Defense publicly admits that 
there were three British, one Cypriot, 
and three Greek vessels in North Viet-
nam. While again the classified report 
indicates that the true figure is well 
over double that?well over double it, 
I tell you?and that is what we are not 
being told?actually the secret reports 
given to me by the Department of De-
fense show that free world arrivals in 
North Vietnam in January are actually 
more than in any month since last July. 
I will say that again. Free world ar-
rivals in January in North Vietnam were 
more than during any month since last 
July. 
Now, Mr. Chairman, I submit that we 
cannot say that we have provided our 
fighting men with the supplies they need 
without looking at the other side of the 
coin, without having done everything 
that we can to interdict the enemies' 
lines of supply. 
We should close every possible valve 
in their lines of supply and the higher up 
in the pipeline the better it will serve our 
interests. That is why I say that we 
should make sure that nothing destined 
for North Vietnam is ever loaded aboard 
a free world ship. 
Now, Mr. Chairman, my third point 
focuses not upon military hardware 
needs but, rather, upon that which this 
hardware seeks to accomplish. 
Mr. Chairman, the struggle in South 
Vietnam is essentially no different from 
that encountered in many other places 
in the world, where we are confronted 
with communistic aggression and sub-
version. It is simply nothing but a 
struggle for the minds of men. 
Mr. Chairman, the U.S. presence in 
South Vietnam, to be successful in less-
ening the spread of communism, must 
win the support of the South Vietnamese 
people by convincing them that we share 
a common cause, and that the United 
States is determined to help them 
achieve security and to establish a better 
way of life. 
Mr. Chairman, this effort can only be 
successful if the South Vietnamese are 
fully and accurately informed about the 
problems which we are facing jointly, 
and what is being done to solve these 
problems. 
Mr. Chairman, early last summer 
General Westmoreland made it clear to 
our special subcommittee of the House 
Armed Services Committee that was sent 
to South Vietnam by the chairman of 
the Committee on Armed Services, the 
gentleman from South Carolina [Mr. 
Rivzits], that in his judgment television 
offered a tremendous opportunity to help 
unify a country where communication is 
extremely difficult, if not totally non-
existent. With proper encouragement, 
this project was finally approved. I have 
followed its progress closely. While I am 
apprised of some initial technical diffi-
culties, I am informed that it is now op-
erational and performing well since its 
inauguration in early February, and that 
there are airborne transmitters beaming 
daily television signals to the Saigon 
area. 
Mr. Chairman, I was privileged to see 
these flying TV stations as they were 
being assembled right here in the Wash-
ington area, at the Andrews Air Force 
Base. I talked to the officers and men 
that were actually installing the equip-
ment. I saw what went into these planes. 
It was the biggest scavenger hunt I have 
ever heard of?spare parts and obsolete 
equipment were sought wherever they 
could be found, and if they could not be 
found, makeship parts were fabricated 
on the spot. 
I was even told that some essential 
components were found on the local 
shelves of the Sears & Roebuck stores. 
Mr. Chairman, I have never witnessed 
a greater dedication than that of the 
crews who worked 24 hours a day, really 
around the clock, in order to get these 
planes operational and send them on 
their mission. 
Mr. Chairman, just this past week I 
had an opportunity to talk with the 
Vice President, following our White 
House briefing?that was last Thursday 
morning?and I asked him how this 
television project was getting along and 
whether or not he had heard anything

about it while he was in Saigon. I am 
pleased to report to my colleagues of the 
House that he was most, enthusiastic 
about the great potential of this pro-
gram. He concurred in the need for its 
expansion just as fast as possible. 
So, Mr. Chairman, I say to the mem-
bers of the Committee of the Whole 
house on the State of the Union today 
that if this program is a good program 
and if it can perform a vital function in 
helping to convince the people of South 
Vietnam of our determination to help 
them resist a ruthless advance of com-
munism in their homeland, it is time we 
got to work here procuring the proper 
equipment with which to do this job, 
rather than sending them wornout, dis-
carded, obsolete equipment held togeth-
er with coathangers, baling wire, paper 
clips and Scotch tape. 
Mr. Chairman, I have heard rumors to 
toe effect that there are requests now 
pending for new and better equipment, 
including more suitable aircraft for this 
job, and as soon as I can learn more of 
the details as to what will be required, 
am going to do what I can to get it 
and get it quick, and get it to South Viet-
nam. I urge your help in providing 
whatever may be needed in order to real-
ize fully this dramatic potential of tele-. 
vision in South Vietnam. 
Mr. Chairman, the bill now pending 
before us calls for the authorization of 
$4.8 billion. The total of the President's 
recent supplemental request was $12.3 
billion. These are only supplemental 
funds. No one knows how much we 
have spent in the past, and certainly all 
of us are certain that much more is going 
to be required in the future. I have been. 
told that the original program, this tele-
vision program, in South Vietnam called 
for the expenditure of $1.4 million. 
The CHAIRMAN. The time of the 
gentleman from Michigan has expired. 
)4r. BATES. Mr, Chairman, I yield 
the gentleman 3 additional minutes. 
Mr, CHAMBERLAIN. I thank my 
rolleague for yielding to me this addi-
tional time. 
The original program to provide this 
television network in South Vietnam 
called for only $1.4 million, to provide a 
network throughout the country that 
would reach from 80 percent to 90 per-
cent of its inhabitants, and that this 
could be accomplished within, a year. 
When we are talking about a $12 billion 
supplemental appropriation, I say $1.4 
million is a modest sum. The Govern-
ment could afford it as much as the Gov-
ernment could afford my taking a sip of 
water from this glass. 
So, Mr. Chairman, as we provide the 
hardware and equipment that will be 
needed for our troops in South Vietnam 
let us be bold to also think in terms of 
ming one of our greatest assets, one we 
have not used heretofore to the fullest. 
You know, Mr. Chairman, we hear so 
much about bold and imaginative pro-
grams. But when we come up with 
something truly bold and imaginative we 
put it together with obsolete equipment. 
(c1; us do all we can to convince the 
South Vietnamese of our good intentions 
especially when we have a program that 
can serve our purpose and be expanded 
without bloodshed. Now boar that in 
mind. We are not going to try to kill 
people with television. Why do we have 
to appropriate all this money and send 
our boys by the hundreds of thousands 
crawling through the jungle and wreak-
ing destruction on the countryside just 
to convince the South Vietnamese peo-
ple that we mean business when no na-
tion in the world can claim the abilities 
we have achieved with television? 
By way of conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I 
should like to add. that the or rasion of 
this bill is a time for unity aid not a 
time for dissension. The debate in 
recent weeks over our policy in Vietnam 
has had its purpose and its day in court. 
It has properly served to get a lot of 
thinking out in the open. How ever, the 
criticism that has been prompted, I 
believe, has reached the point of 
diminishing return.. After all that has 
been said, we are still confron ted with 
the stubborn fact that there is no real 
alternative to the basic premise of our 
present policy. We do not iotend to 
abandon the South 'Vietnamese peoPle 
and our own long-range interests to the 
aggressive demands of commuidsm. It 
is timely for us to put Ho Chi Minh on 
notice of our firm, united determination 
to support such a policy. There should 
be no other interpretation as to the 
meaning of what we do here today. 
Mr. BATES. Mr. Chairman, I yield to 
the gentleman from California I Mr. DON 
H. CLAUSEN ] . 
(Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN asked and 
was given permission to revise and ex-
tend his remarks.) 
Mr. DON H. CLAUSEN. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise in support of this le;:islation. 
The Speaker of the House, Mr. Mc-
CORMACK. the distinguished majority 
leader, Mr. ALBERT. the chairman and 
ranking members of the Armed Services 
Committee have all presented a strong 
position of support. The cemmittee 
members have passed the bill unani-
mously. 
I do not believe this is the time to 
project an image of disunity to our free 
world friends or our enemies. I do not 
believe any real service would be ren-
dered by not providing our men serving 
in Vietnam with the best in equipment 
to carry out their military mission. 
The debate here today suggests that 
many Members of Congress are becom-
ing increasingly disenchanted with the 
inconsistent and sometimes ambiguous 
reports coming out of Vietnam. The 
American people have expressed an in-
creasing amount of doubt about our 
policies. I believe this attitude arises 
because the people do not feel they have 
been told the entire story. I further 
believe the American people will back 
a firm policy that is designed to win, if 
they are told the complete facts. 
I have felt for some time that we 
should find out who our friends really 
are in southeast Asia and this includes 
our allies in both NATO and SEATO. 
As the gentleman from Michigan sug-
gests, the shipping in and out of 
Haiphong has increased appreciably this 
year?this is, of course, understandable 
during times of military conflict. But 
the deplorable fact that our allies?our 
friends, if you will, are among those 
who are carrying supplies and materiel 
for the support of our enemies. Why can 
not we be equally firm with these so-
called friends who choose to make a 
profit from both sides of this war? To 
me, this borders on the brink of inter-
national treason. Not only does this 
problem exist in Vietnam but they con-
tinue their normal trade relations with 
Cuba and other puppet countries of the 
Soviet Union and Red China. &miner or 
later we are going to have to get tough 
with our friends and ask them to ap-
propriately decide which side of the 
fence they are really on. 
I sincerely believe President Johnson's 
place in history will be determined by 
his ability to strengthen the SEATO al-
liance to bolster their ability to provide 
for their own security in that section of 
the world?thereby minimizing the num-
ber of American boys required to up-
hold our commitment in that faraway 
section of the world. The same thing 
can be said of our relationship with the 
NATO countries. Heaven forbid the day 
when our traditional alliances (Tumble. 
The only way we can expect to retain 
the respect of mankind is through a 
policy of firmness and fairness?be it 
military, economic, or political. 
Therefore, I support this bill today, 
but in closing I would like to admonish 
my colleagues to continue to seek other 
means to win this war. We can and must 
escalate the peace offensive throughout 
the world through the application of an 
economic, political, psychological, tech-
nological, and humanitarian offensive?
employing techniques that are creative, 
bold, and imaginative. This will require 
a broader commitment from all Amer-
icans and our free world friends as we 
jointly uphold our firm resolve to sustain 
freedom for all mankind. 
Mr. BATES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
to the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. 
HALL I such time as he may require. 
Mr. HALL. Mr. Chairman, as has 
been well stated, this bill represents 
authorization for our troops of all the 
services in South Vietnam. I rise in 
support of it because I think the way it 
has been reviewed, albeit hastily but by 
line item, whether in areas of research 
and development or in procurement of 
military equipment, tanks and missiles, 
or whether in the area of construction?
indicates the proper approach to all 
authorizations by a legislative com-
mittee. 
Many of us are extremely proud of the 
logistical support that is being rendered 
to our troops there. 
A vote for this bill is a vote for con-
tinued support of these people and I 
would like to assure one of the e;entle-
men who queried our distinguished 
chairman that medicine is again making 
a record in South Vietnam that has never 
been made before, based on the modern 
state of the art, to the point where we 
are having less than 1 percent of deaths 
from all battle casualties that reach any 
kind of aid. However, Mr. Chairman, 
all the supplies will not help if we are 
handicapped too much by a lack of will 
to win and by dissension in the ranks 
back home.

March 1, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECUEu riu 
We have perhaps in the past overex-
tended ourselves and not defended our-
selves to the maximum. It is poor mili-
tary policy if we do not use a maximum 
offense as the best defense. 
Perhaps there are items here in this 
supplemental or deficiency bill that have 
been moved from the fiscal year 1967 in-
to the supplemental or deficiency author-
ization in many areas. But there is cer-
tainly much here that is needed imme-
diately in follow-on and long leadtime 
items, and your committee is convinced 
this is the most appropriate way to get 
the materiel into the hands of our 
troops. Perhaps there is much here that 
was lopped off a year or so ago by a 
penny wise and pound foolish Secretary 
of Defense or Bureau of the Budget. But 
now the equipment is needed and to my 
mind it is proper and not further debat-
able, in view of the committee hearings, 
report, and unanimous action. 
Perhaps there has been too long a 
delay in the proper interdiction of logis-
tical supply lines of the North Vietnam-
ese but now it is time to get on with 
the job. 
Yes, Mr. Chairman, a vote today is not 
In support of any of the Secretary of 
Defense's multiple mistakes or lack of 
State Department foreign policy. This 
is a vote for all our men in all the serv-
ices in southeast Asia on a basis where 
we have undoubted superiority, in the 
air and sea, and should be about the 
job with adequate supplies. 
I strongly recommend a unanimous 
vote in favor of this supplemental au-
thorization bill for the men in south-
east Asia. 
(Mr. HALL asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. I 
yield to the distinguished gentleman 
from Washington [Mr. Mem] whatever 
time he might require. 
(Mr. HICKS asked and was given per-
mission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. HICKS. Mr. Chairman, I rise to 
support this bill. 
My office is now tabulating the returns 
from a questionnaire I sent out last 
month-13,000 have been returned, and 
they are still arriving in large numbers. 
The questionnaire has a good deal of 
blank space, which the respondents have 
used liberally for comments. Mr. Chair-
man, these comments, as well as answers 
to the questions I asked, show that the 
people of my district overwhelmingly 
support the President's policy in Viet-
nam. Therefore, they would support 
this bill as I do. 
But, Mr. Chairman, along with their 
concern about Vietnam they are tremen-
dously concerned about inflation. I con-
fess that I too am worried about infla-
tion, and have been for some time. The 
bill before us is a supplemental authori-
zation bill. Why must it be supple-
mental? Because we did not properly 
evaluate the situation last year. Now 
military expenditures are rising relent-
lessly, while unemployment continues its 
downward trend, and unemployed skilled 
labor virtually no longer exists. All of 
these things show inflationary pressures, 
and those pressures are tremendous now. 
We must not ignore the inflationary 
danger. We must not allow ourselves to 
take half measures and pretend that we 
are facing the problem squarely with all 
its implications. We must not let our-
selves underestimate the danger by al-
ways dealing with parts but never with 
the whole. If we do, we will continue to 
have supplemental instead of compre-
hensive legislation. 
What is the answer? Because infla-
tion is caused by rising demand, meas-
ures must be taken to curb demand. 
Many approaches are offered, and several 
of them together seem to me to offer the 
best approach. The Federal Reserve 
Board has already raised the price of 
money. This alone will not solve the 
problem. However, combined with other 
measures it can help to restrain invest-
ment and reduce demand in that way. 
We must also look to decreased Govern-
ment spending and increased taxes. 
Nonmilitary spending must be cur-
tailed where it is possitle to do so with-
out jeopardizing what is best in our Great 
Society programs. And that does not 
mean cutting down impacted areas 
school aid, or school milk, and hot 
lunches. It does mean that we must re-
double our critical scrutiny o_ every 
measure for the expenditure of funds to 
be sure that it will achieve the purpose 
as economically and efficiently as pos-
sible. 
As for taxes, last week I voted against 
the tax bill the purpose of which was to 
raise revenue to pay for increAsed spend-
ing of the Vietnam war. I voted against 
it not because I think we do not need a 
new tax measure but because it seemed to 
me a palliative ar.d not a cure. I do not 
oppose the withholding changes, and I 
think it is sensible to graduate the with-
holding rates to coincide more closely 
with tax rates. And since it is true that 
the Government needs funds now, a 
speed-up in collection will obviously help 
in the short run. The excise tax reim-
position does bother me because excise 
taxes are not the most equitable kind of 
tax. But above all, I consider the meas-
ures in that bill too little and too late. 
The tax which was not even discussed 
last week but which will be paid regard-
less of the tax bill approved by this body, 
the tax which is the most discriminatory 
of all, is inflation. 
We cannot avoid taxation of some 
kind. The question then is whether we 
should tax through inflation, ignoring 
the problem and letting it take its course, 
or face the problem squarely and make 
the decision to tax in an orderly and 
evenhanded way. I think the choice 
is clear. Although it is never popular 
to raise taxes, we will have to do so. 
But we must do so in a meaningful way, 
not by halfhearted measures which lull 
us into thinking we have met the need. 
The sooner we recognize this fact and 
move to act the better. 
If we do not take well-planned meas-
ures soon, then we will surely give rein 
to inflation. By so doing we may im-
pose the cruelest tax of all on those least 
able to bear the burden, on the elderly 
4277 
and disabled living on fixed incomes, on 
the poor, the unemployed. 
A minute ago I mentioned the ques-
tionnaires I am receiving from my con-
stituents. A comment on one of them 
seems to me to reflect the responsible 
thinking of the people of my district on 
the need to be realistic about paying for 
our programs, both foreign and domestic. 
The writer said: 
We all want the benefits of the Great 
Society but nobody seems to want to foot 
the bill?if we are going to spend let us raise 
taxes (I might point out that I make over 
$10,000 a year with two dependents so I will 
feel it) but it has to be done. 
I was pleased to find in last Sunday's 
Washington Post that my views coincide 
with those of a most eminent economist, 
Dr. Paul A. Samuelson. He points to the 
latest estimates of our gross national 
product in this coming year, now ex-
pected to rise about $5 billion above what 
has been forecast. His most telling 
point, in my view, is that our economic 
expansion is becoming rapid and frantic 
instead of orderly and durable, that it 
cannot benefit the country, and that it 
will harm those at the bottom of the 
economic ladder. It should be restrained 
so that orderly growth can be continued. 
I fully agree with Dr. Samuelson's con-
clusion that a new tax plan is needed, 
and that work on such a plan should go 
forward at once. 
In closing, Mr. Chairman, I want to 
reiterate my support for this bill and to 
express the hope that all my colleagues 
will support it too. At the same time 
I urge them to face without flinching 
the need to keep our economy in hand 
and the responsibility to do so. 
Mr. ROSENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, 
will the gentleman yield? 
Mr. HICKS. I yield to the gentleman 
from New York. 
(Mr. ROSENTHAL asked and was 
given permission to revise and extend 
his remarks.) 
Mr. ROSENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I 
vote for this supplemental authoriza-
tion with reluctance and apprehension. 
The policy which such a vote would 
seem to endorse is one with which I 
have often disagreed. It is one with 
which, in many respects, I disagree now. 
Bombing of North Vietnam has been af 
negligible military effect and has in-
volved serious diplomatic drawbacks. I 
have also felt that any settlement, any 
negotiations, any provisional govern-
ment, and any elections which excluded 
the participation of the National Libera-
tion Front would be highly impractical. 
Indeed, I think one of the principal ob-
stacles to peace, in addition to the pres-
ent hostility of North Vietnam, is our 
apparent refusal to acknowledge the 
existence of the National Liberation 
Front which is composed largely of South 
Vietnamese, and is clearly in control of 
much of South Vietnam. We do not in-
tend to exterminate that force. We 
therefore must deal with it. And we 
must make clear to all that we shall 
deal with it. That concession I believe 
to be a prerequisite for settlement. 
I believe, therefore, that there are 
diplomatic alternatives to further escala-

CONGRESSIONAL RECOP, I) ? HOUSE March 1, 1966 
tion of this war. Not being sure if these 
alternatives have been adequately ex-
plored, indeed having some feeling that 
they have been too quickly passed by, I 
am unable to accept any contention that 
we must escalate in Vietnam. Yet, I fear 
that this authorization permits such an 
escalation_ 
f am, moreover, puzzled by many of 
the provisions in this authorization it-
self. I share the reservations expressed 
in the committee report: 
"If there is one reservation felt by many 
members of the committee regarding the 
necessity for this legislation, it arises from 
the possibility that many of the items in-
volved, in all three categories of procure-
ment, research, and development, and con-
struction, rlia.y simply have been moved from 
the regular 1967 authorization to this sup-
Tilemental 1906 authorization without any 
,:ofit program for acceleration. Obviously no 
military advantages would be gained by such 
a bookkeeping situation. Testimony on this 
subject was indecisive and the committee 
has not yet been provided with sufficient 
definitive data to pinpoint the exact degree 
of real acceleration, or to determine the 
amounts involved in the proposed legisla-
tion which could safely and should properly 
be deferred until the regular 1967 authoriza-
tion." 
With these misgivings, however, I still 
feel constrained to vote for the measure 
before us today. I can find no adequate 
reason to refuse American forces the 
support necessary for their survival. I 
question the policies which brought over 
200,000 men to Vietnam. That being 
said. I still cannot find acceptable 
grounds for refusing those forces the 
means to defend themselves and to sur-
vive in war. 
Here is a deeper problem, a more 
fundamental issue. The President's pri-
macy in foreign affairs is nothing to be 
treated lightly. Its ultimate source of 
legitimacy is the Constitution. I do not 
believe that the congressional role in for-
eign affairs is such that we should feel 
completely free to deny the President the 
means to pursue a policy, particularly in 
war, once that policy has been reached 
with ample consultation. Clearly, Con-
gress must reserve the right to act in such 
a manner, 'rhe proper constitutional 
vehicle for such action, however, is a 
declaration of war. In any case, I be-
lieve that the right to deny the President 
in war should be exercised only in cir-
cumstances of the greatest clarity, or in 
issues about which there is little ambigu-
ity. Vietnam is not such an issue, 
despite the misgivings many have about 
policy. 
I. am not happy with the minimal role. 
to which Congress is thus consigned. 
Nor am I convinced that the Congress 
has been adequately consulted or respect-
fully attended in the formulation of poli-
cies in Vietnam. But I do not accept the 
proposition that this vote today consti-
tutes a considered and broad sense of 
Congress. 
do not believe my own vote, simply 
as a vote, properly represents my view-
point on this matter, any more than the 
total vote of Congress adequately repre-
sents the total sentiment of Congress. 
Complicated positions on matters of war 
and peace are not to be abbreviated by 
such simple symbolism. So I deny the 
legitimacy of this vote as a deep expres-
sion of Mdividual or collective viewpoint 
on the full range of policy in Vietnam. 
I am voting for support and supplies for 
the American troops already committed 
to Vietnam. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. I 
yield to the distinguished minority 
leader, the gentleman from Louisiana 
[Mr. BO,;GS I, whatever time he might re-
quire, 
(Mr. BOGGS asked and was given per-
mission to revise arid extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BOGGS. Mr. Chairman, I am 
happy to commend the chairman of the 
distinguished Armed Services Committee 
and the members of that committee, in-
cluding my colleague, the lientleman 
from Louisiana [Mr. HEBERT], arid many 
others. This committee rep,:,rted this 
legislation unanimously. It is a com-
mittee that debates issues thoroughly and 
completely. In my judgment, lhis com-
mittee ROHM not have reported this bill 
unanimcusly had it not felt that it was 
absolutely essential for the s(,,eurity of 
our Nation and for the freedom of our 
Nation. 
should also like to come end and 
congratulate the Members of this body, 
the House of Representatives, for the 
unity which they have shown in the face 
of this challenge to our country. 
In my judgment, the only way we can 
be defeated is not by the Communists 
from the North Vietnam or by the sup-
port which they receive from the Chinese 
Communists, who have declared time and 
time aga n their announced intention of 
conquering all free world, but we can be 
defeated if we divide among ourselves. 
We can be defeated if the word goes out 
to Hanoi and Peiping that we will not 
stand united in Vietnam, and that we 
will talk when we should be defending 
the bastions of freedom there and help-
ing the men who are fighting in the name 
of freedom. 
I hope that this bill will be am opted by 
an overwhelming vote?I hope by a 
unanimous vote. 
For 25 years this country, known as 
the hallmark of freedom, has faced first 
one, then. another threat to freedom?
to our own and to that of our friends. 
One after another these threats have 
been confronted and eventually con-
tained. But still the threats persist. 
It has been a trying quarter ,if a cen-
tury for the forces of freedom. At times 
we become exasperated with the 
continuing need to defend freedom. It is 
at those times that we need to remind 
ourselves that freedom is not entirely 
free; it must constantly be defended to 
be assured. If there has been any time 
in the hlstory of the changing world 
that we could not afford to tjre, it is 
now. 
I believe that we must reexamine the 
quarter-century that has just pissed us 
to see where we have gone, what we now 
have, and what we should be striving 
for. Let me take a minute or two to 
try to gain that perspective. 
In the Second World War the chal-
lenge to liberty quickly became obvious 
and direct, and the call for our response 
became apparent. After 1945 the new 
challenge of communism in the form of 
the Red army moving across Europe be-
came clear-cut; our measured response 
to that advance was clearly called for. 
It was successful; the adversary was 
stopped, but not before he had engulfed 
much of Eastern Europe. 
The Communist threats in southern 
Europe and the Middle East in the late 
1940's were not as direct and open, but 
they soon became clear. The bold re-
sponses of the American Government and 
of the threatened peoples themselves 
brought about a subsidence of tile threat, 
and again Communist expansionism was 
stifled. 
In Asia, meanwhile, the calamities of 
the World War and its aftermath were 
permitting Communist rule to establish 
itself on the Chinese mainland and on 
the northern part of the Korean Penin-
sula. The free world was at a loss to 
stop it. But, by 1950 when the Commu-
nists were sufficiently organized in power 
to openly attack South Korea. the free 
world no longer stood by passively, and 
as in Europe, the Communist thrust was 
eventually stalled. 
Shortly thereafter, the southeast Asian 
independence movements, which were 
soon to drive European colonial power 
from that area, were usurped by the 
Communists. A Communist regime, in 
the guise of anticolonialist liberators, 
was installed in North Vietnam under 
terms of the 1954 Geneva agroements. 
Not satisfied with the territory they al-
ready had, the Communists that same 
year began stockpiling arms in the south 
and infiltrating some 10,000 Communist 
guerrillas into the South Vietnamese 
peasantry. The groundwork for an ex-
tensive insurgency was laid in the south. 
By 1956-5'7 the insurgents began to 
act, when it became evident the t South 
Vietnam would not fall peaceably under 
Hanoi's control. By 1959 terrorist at-
tacks, assassinations, and kidnapings 
had claimed an estimated 1,000 South 
Vietnamese civilian victims. Another 
Communist thrust was underway against 
a free world country. 
An earlier campaign against the 
French in Indochina had not been 
stopped until the Communists were able 
to establish another Communist-ruled 
nation. By 1960 that new Communist 
country was pressing in a now push into 
Laos and actively into South Vietnam, 
and it was making progress. 
If the new thrust of communism was 
to be stopped, it had to be done in Viet-
nam and Laos. It was clear that Com-
munist forces were gaining new terri-
tory. The free world had been relatively 
successful in stalling Communist ag-
gression elsewhere in the world. Was it 
to falter in southeast Asia? That ques-
tion was posed in the 1960-62 period. It 
is still posed for us in 1966 with regard 
to Vietnam. 
Asia then has become the locale for 
the Communist offensive. But they are 
different Communists than the free 
world faced in Europe, and they are 
using different techniques. There is no 
longer direct, open aggression. Instead 
the Chinese and their North Vietnamese 
agents are perfecting the art of national

March 1, 1966 
liberation wars--of subtle, covert, and 
ambiguous external assistance to inter-
nally based guerrilla units. 
What we face in Vietnam today is this 
kind of ambiguous, elusive military con-
frontation. But the world is not preoc-
cupied with other major wars at this 
moment, or with other major respon-
sibilities that are of overriding concern. 
Nor is there a decolonization battle wag-
ing in Vietnam. There are no excuses 
for us not to see this conflict in Vietnam 
as aggression by one state against an-
other. A properly measured and positive 
response to this aggression must be found 
and pursued. 
To those who would ask proof of ag-
gression against the South Vietnamese, 
I would ask the purpose of the 80,000 
Communists, taken from the south to 
Hanoi in 1954, who were infiltrated back 
into the south beginning in 1961. I would 
also ask why nine or more regiments of 
regular North Vietnamese forces have 
been brought into South Vietnam in the 
past year. And I would ask the mean-
ing of open boasts by the Hanoi leader-
ship of its support for the so-called lib-
eration movement in the south as a step 
toward reunification on Communist 
terms. 
That there has been aggression from 
North Vietnam, there is no question. 
This aggression against the south is di-
rected and supported politically and 
militarily from Hanoi. The weapons, 
equipment, and other supplies for it are 
supplied largely by Hanoi, which in turn 
is supported by Communist China. . 
That the South Vietnamese deserve 
and must have help from us and other 
allies, I believe, is without question. How 
can we, or anyone, expect the South 
Vietnamese to meet successfully the 
growing power of all Asian communism? 
It is not by our choice that we are there. 
It is by the decision of the North Viet-
namese, supported by the Red Chinese, 
that we are forced to respond to their 
aggression. The initiative has been on 
their part. Our actions have only been 
in response to their determined and 
growing aggression. 
Our actions have been in accord with 
our commitments under the Southeast 
Asia Treaty and with our bilateral com-
mitments to the South Vietnamese made 
and confirmed by three Presidents. Our 
commitment to South Vietnam is firm. 
Under the SEATO terms we have agreed 
that "each party recognizes that aggres-
sion by means of armed attack would en-
danger its own peace and safety, and 
agrees that it will in that event act to 
meet the common danger in accordance 
with its constitutional processes." That 
obligation has been called. 
It seems to me that our obligation is 
even more than this. It is to come to the 
defense of freedom. "Let every nation 
know, whether it wishes us well or ill, 
that we shall pay any price, bear any 
burden, meet any hardship, support any 
friend, oppose any foe to assure the sur-
vival and the success of liberty." Those 
words of the late John F. Kennedy are 
still our guidelines. 
Mr. Chairman, at this point, I should 
like to insert into the RECORD a recent 
speech on the war in Vietnam which I de-
livered in Chicago to the annual con-
vention of the National Sand & Gravel 
and the National Ready Mixed Concrete 
Associations. The address was given on 
February 10, 1966, and the text of this 
speech follows: 
ADDRESS OF REPRESENTATIVE HALE BOGGS, 
DEMOCRAT, OF LOUISIANA, BEFORE THE NA-
TIONAL SAND & GRAVEL AND THE NATIONAL 
READY MIXED CONCRETE ASSOCIATIONS, CHI-
CAGO, ILL., FEBRUARY 10, 1966 
Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, it is 
a pleasure to come here today. You stand 
In the tradition that has made this country 
great: That of individual enterprise and ef-
fort. Your work contributes to the well-
being and security of all Americans. And, 
because this is America, you too reap the 
benefits. 
I could speak with you about some of the 
legislative proposals now pending in the 
Congress, or at some length of the relation-
ship of Government to business and labor. 
Today, however, because of the limitation 
of time, I would like to speak on a subject 
that now transcends all other. It is an issue 
that, despite the best efforts of President 
Johnson, Secretary Rusk, and many others, 
requires broad discussion and understanding. 
I shall talk to you of Vietnam. I shall try 
to tell you why we are there, what we are 
trying to do, and the means we are employ-
ing. I shall consider some of the alternatives 
which have been proposed by critics. 
You are intelligent businessmen. Your 
profession impels you to be realistic. You 
look at the hard facts. Thus, I shall not 
demean your intelligence with platitudes. 
Your time is limited. The subject is com-
plex. Our cause is still misunderstood. So 
let us begin. 
First, let us speak of old realities and new 
myths. The old reality is that the Commu-
nist world is still predatory. Now it is China 
more than the Soviet Union which casts 
covetous eyes on her neighbors. Communist 
China believes that it can conquer the world. 
It believes that it can do this through so-
called wars of national liberation, In South 
Vietnam, such a bloody war of so-called 
liberation is raging. The Communist Viet-
cong are trying to take over South Vietnam. 
They are being abetted, with men and arms, 
from North Vietnam. The root instigator is 
Communist China. 
We are in South Vietnam to help the 
South Vietnamese people retain their inde-
pendence and freedom. This is our immedi-
ate goal. Our whole history impels us to 
protect our weak friends from aggression. 
Our resistence to militant communism in 
South Vietnam is part of a long series of 
events in which we have defended freedom. 
It started with the Truman doctrine in 1947. 
Congress and the country agreed with Presi-
dent Truman, and American aid was sent to 
Greece. The policy was a brilliant success 
and Greece and the Mediterranean were 
saved for the West. 
So South Vietnam Is in the tradition of 
our help to Greece and Turkey in 1917, For-
mosa and Korea in 1950, and Berlin since 
1948. All these stands in defense of freedom 
were successful. All these areas remain in 
the free world. 
But we have an even more important task. 
Vietnam is a crucial test between our coun-
try and Communist China. If we leave 
without a just and honorable peace, the 
word will quickly spread around the world, 
like a prairie fire, that the West has quit 
and communism is the victor. The impact 
of this is obvious. 
First, it would demonstrate that the Chi-
nese brand of communism which repeatedly 
and explicitly says it wants no peace will 
become dominant. The Sino-Soviet split will 
be resolved in favor of the militant and ag-
gressive Chinese. 
As Secretary of State Rusk recently point-
ed out: "A central issue in the dispute be-
tween the two leading Communist powers 
today is to vhat extent it is effective and 
prudent to use force to promote the spread 
of communism. If the bellicose doctrines 
of the Asian Communists should reap a sub-
stantial reward, the outlook for peace in this 
world would be grim indeed." 
Now the leadership of the Communist 
Chinese?the average age of the 17 men 
who make up the top leadership is 68?face 
many problems of their own. One is what 
Communists call revisionism. This is the 
tendency to forsake militant revolution for 
internal development, using some of the same 
incentives employed by free enterprise soci-
eties outside the Communist orbit. This is 
what the Russians are experiencing, and by 
resisting aggression in South Vietnam, we 
are encouraging such revisionism in China. 
The effect of such a withdrawal on Japan 
would be serious. There a laborious effort 
has been quite successful in creating a peace-
ful and democratic society. Its economy and 
industry are now harnessed to the ways of 
peace. I was in Japan recently and I am 
convinced that it could not continue as a 
free society if we, in effect, surrender in Viet-
nam and withdraw from southeast Asia. 
Similarly, what do you think would have 
happened in Indonesia had we not been in 
Vietnam? Do you think the recent over-, 
throw and demise of one of the largest and 
most powerful Communist parties in the 
world would have been successful had not 
the Indonesians known that we were in 
southeast Asia and would remain until an 
honorable peace is attained. 
Equally important, we stand in Vietnam 
because we know that if we retreat there, 
then Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, 
Pakistan, India, would all fall very quickly. 
The probable result would be world war III. 
President Johnson has stated our reasons 
for being in Vietnam. If the Communists 
win, he said: "They would know they can 
accomplish through so-called wars of na-
tional liberation what they could not accom-
plish through naked aggression in Korea?or 
insurgency in the Philippines, Greece, and 
Malaya?or the threat of aggression in Tur-
key?or in a free election booth anywhere in 
the world." 
Our military effort in Vietnam, then, is 
vital to the ultimate success of the South 
Vietnamese people in achieving a stable, 
viable, government with a free society. But 
the fact is that military success in defeating 
the Vietcong is only the initial step in a long, 
tough, task of rebuilding the South Viet-
namese society to meet the challenges and 
responsibilities of self-government as a mod-
ern state. 
The military difficulties are compounded 
by the state of the South Vietnam economy 
and political organization. The Communists 
have wreaked havoc. In the dense jungles 
and broad deltas they have employed every 
conceivable method of terror and coercion. 
Imagine, if you will, the United States with 
half of the cities and towns under Communist 
control. Imagine no road or railroad or 
canal or river safe for communication and 
transportation. Imagine the farmer unable 
to produce his crop because of terror, mur-

that most of the leadership?mayors, coun-

It is under these conditions that we seek 
to join with the forces of the South Vietna-

many of Ii]lem striving in the countryside

the program is strengthother of the national 
police force. 
Now I have discussed with you why we are 
in South Vietnam and wiilPt we are laying to 
do there. I have a further duty. This is 
In frankly dissuss with you what the critics 
of our policy, both in and out of Congress, 
are saying. A President can be right and 
the entice country diregrce with him.. Or 
he may be wrong and still enjoy mass appro-
bation. 
We have an obligetion I. answer these 
arguments. Co one ride Fnala advocate at 
worst, complete surrender- libot we get out 
right away. At best, they poise this defeat-
'him in an enciave theory which would effec-
tively give the bulk of the country over to 
the Communists and leave us isolated. 
Others advocate mass boinblinr:. They 
want, us to take the wits to the Chine ,e main-
land. Their intention is honorable. The 
result would be devastation. Mit not victory. 
And their proposals might unleash a world 
war. 
D.sparate as these critics are in the solu-
tions they propose, they are similar in their 
eagerness to be relieved of the burdens of 
world leadership. They both want us to 
get the whole thing over with. Both views 
smack of the sentiments of Prime Minister 
Chamberlain, Mr. Chamberlain once spoke 
to the British, Nation and I emote: "Of a 
quarrel in a feraway country between peo-
ple of whom we know nothing?why should. 
we get involved." 
This was appeasement. The result was 6 
years of the bloodiest war in the history of 
mankind.. That appeasement would work 
was a myth then?it remains a myth now. 
These critics despair too soon. We have 
lsen in South Vietnam in force for a scant 
0 months. Only now is our presence being 
lett. Six months ago, village after village 
was being surrounded and overcome, and 
the government forces had retreated to the 
town squares and to the city of Saigon itself. 
Today, many of the villages have been re-
taken and pacified. More than that, the 
people know that we are there, They know 
that we intend to stay as long as necessary. 
The impact is one of enormous significance. 
Met over a month ago I was in Vietnam. 
I went there to see for myself. I saw the 
condition of the country. I saw the mag-
nitude of the job. I saw that we were do-
ing that job. 
I. was impressed by the will of the Viet-
namese people. But I must pause to tell 
you about our magnificent men. Our forces 
are extremely able, alert, and intelligent. 
Most of bite men in our Aimed Forces today 
are high school graduates. Most of our offi-
cers are college graduates. Most of them are 
trained in government, in economics and 
political systems. And most of them, thank 
God, understand the philosophica. and polit-
ical thee it of communism so that they know 
what the war is all about. The morale of 
our men is tremendous. Inspiring is the 
only word for it. They know ieiby we are 
there, They know what we must "do. And 
they have the ability and will to do it. 
What linin are the pie ipects for immediate 
victory? Viciory in this instance is not like 
that of s, conventional war, in Het it must 
mean the containment of comxrc reism, and 
this will undoubtedly take time end effort 
and siierifice, But the etakes arc enormous, 
recall is vividly as any experience of my 
life, the days of the Cuban crisis; You may 
remember that Congress had just adjourned 
and President Kennedy riummoncii all of the 
coogressienal leaders back to Veshington. 
There i,s the Cabinet :Room of the White 
House he outlined in derail the Reesian mis-
sile threat to the United State a For one 
terrible week the Nation looked down the 
nuclear barrel. On. the Monday after the 
Sunday morning that Khrushcher wrote his 
letter to the President ihdica dog withdrawal 
of the missiles, Preside] t Kinney said, at 
his final briefing: "The military threat of 
Russia is receding,. Now the three will come 
from Communist China as it develops the 
hydrogen bomb." 
Two years later, almeet to the lay, gath-
ered in the same room, with 'Limo' the same 
people, with the exception of President Ken-
nedy, President Johnson briefed is on the 
explosion of the first nuclear device in China. 
There were many questions directiid at Sec-
retary Ru be mad Secretary McNamera. One 
prevailed above all the others. What threat 
does this pose to the free world? The answer 
came back, candid and lneef?very :ittie as of 
now, but a major and dangerous o' c' 10 years 
from a now, barring no change in Ulf! aggres-
sive government now dominant in lihina. 
And as I talked with our leaders i.. Vietnam 
and Saigon, these meetings kept recurring 
in my mind. 
Si) this is the ultimate challenge of Viet-
nam. Whether we turn back the threat now 
or whether we repeat the events of other days 
and ultimately face a China infinitely 
stronger than it is today and determined to 
conquer the rest of mankind. 
This is the challenge, but what it the fu-
ture? Our objectives are clear. We intend 
to contain communism in Vietnam. We do 
not believe that the Communists will stop 
unless we stand firm. Thus we are erecting 
a wall, not a wall of brick and itone and 
barbed wire., but a wall of will and resolution. 
Yet at the same time, T want to mi sure you 
that President Johnson It: doing meerything 
possible to get the Vietnam conflict to the 
conference table where we can achieve a just 
and honorable settlement. Our emissaries 
range the world for peace Now we take our 
search for peace into a new forum at the 
United Nations. 
We will rtey :in Vietnam no longer than is 
necessary. We seek no territory or bases. We 
support free elections in South Vietnam if 
they can be conducted in ;ieeace and without 
Communist intimidation. 
The problem is, as the most ret tint pro-
nouncements from Hanoi so graphecally re-
veal, that the Communists do not yet want 
peace. They still think that they can win. 
Our enemies hope that we are a callow 
nation. They confuse our reluctance to ac-
cept our destiny of world leadership with lack 
of resolve and thus call us a paper tiger. 
They hope that we will be unwilline to bear 
the weight of world leadership when the 
mantle grows heavy. They dream that the 
mightiest nation in the world, with a gross 
national product of nearly three quarters of 
a trillion dollars, will fall for the ,thurious 
alternative of gains or butter. They hope that 
the Democratic Party, fearful of being char-
acterized as a war party, will hesitate to con-
duct our Vietnam policy with vigor. They 
cling to the vain expectation tied our nii-
tional determination will crumble. 
They are wrong and their hopes futile. 
We are strong, and we are resolvid. Presi-
dent Johnson has the vast major ay of our 
people behind him. And even Al Inc faced 
substantial public opposition to our policy, 
he would still do what is right in Vietnam. 
His duty is to the national interest of the 
United States, not partisan political con-
cerns. 
So we will persuade the Communists that 
the price of aggression is too high. And in 
the process, we will prevent world war III. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the dis-
tinguished gentleman from California 
[Mr. LEGGETT]. 
LEGGETT. Mr. Chairrna is, I yield 
to my colleague from California I Mr. 
BURTON]. 
Mr. BURTON of Califon).a. Mr. 
Chairman, once again, as with the spe-
cial appropriation of $700 million for 
the war in Vietnam which was voted last 
May 5, I am required, by conscience, to 
vote in apposition to the overwhelming 
majority of the Members of this House 
and to question, by that vote, the course 
and conduct of our policy in Vietnam. 
I do this with sadness, for I do not 
like to be in opposition to the President 
who, no less than myself or any other 
Member of this House, is acting out of 
conscience and a profound desire to 
serve the best interests of this Nation. 
I am not ignorant of, nor lacking in 
appreciation for, the terrible sacrifice:; 
made each day by our fighting men on 
the battlefields of Vietnam. Indeed, it 
is what these men are going through 
that has moved me to studied and deep 
reflection on this war. 
I oppose this bill as a futile attempt to 
achieve, by additional force of arms, so-
lutions to problems which are not pri-
marily military but essentially political, 
economic, and social. 
I am concerned lest the money that is 
voted today be interpreted as a support 
of this most futile course. I am con-
cerned for the lives, American and Viet-
namese, that this act of expansion of 
the war will cost. 
Last week, I supported and voted for 
an authorization of funds to pursue a 
program of peace to relieve the hunger, 
misery, and suffering of the Vietnamese 
people. 
Today, I cannot now vote funds to 
permit us to expand the war. 
Time does not permit us, under the 
limited debate rule, to discuss the wis-
dom of our initial involvement in Viet-
nam. Suffice it to say, we did, in fact, 
go astray, and now we find ourselves 
sinking deeper and deeper into a, land 
war in Asia for goals which become in-
creasingly obscure and at costs which 
we dare not fully assess. 
Somehow, we find ourselves in the role 
of a nation attempting to preserve the 
era when Western nations determined 
the fate of Asia. That era is gone for-
ever. 
The course we follow runs counter to 
the sweep of history and puts this Naticai

in opposition to the forces of national-
ism which history has demonstrated

We have been repeatedly warned of the 
dangers of committing ourselves to a 
course which involves us in a land war. 
in Asia. Yet, the funds we are asked to 
vote today finance such a commitment 
and reinforces the notion that with more 
men, more weapons, and the inevitable 
higher casualty lists, we can achieve 
stability of the political situation in 
Vietnam, foster support by its people of 
the government, develop its economic 
potential, and alleviate the suffering of 
its people. 
This course is counterproductive in my 
estimation. 
If we continue along this course and 
wander ever more deeply into the jungle 
mists of Asia, I fear that many more 
innocent Vietnamese will die, many 
more brave American soldiers will per-
ish, many mothers and fathers will weep, 
and the honor of this great Nation will 
be cast over with a shadow that only 
time will dispel. 
It diminishes, in the eyes of the world, 
our very real desire for peace. 
The era has long since passed when we 
must arm to negotiate?for negotiate we 
must. We must negotiate with all par-
ties to this conflict. The Vietnamese 
people must be represented in these ne-
gotiations by all parties, including the 
Saigon government and the NLF. 
We must pursue peace through the 
United Nations and work toward the 
achievement of the Geneva accord. 
Peace in Vietnam, in all of southeast 
Asia?indeed in the entire world, dic-
tates this course as it dictates my nay 
vote on this supplemental authorization 
of funds. 
(Mr. BURTON of California asked 
and was given permission to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. LEGGETT. Mr. Chairman, I 
should like to ask the Chairman of the 
Committee if he would give me 4 minutes. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. I do 
not have 4 minutes to give to the gentle-
man, but I will give him 2 minutes; I have 
already given him 2 minutes. 
(Mr. LEGGErri' asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. LEGGETT. Mr. Chairman, it is 
unfortunate that the only record that 
will really be made in the House of 
Representatives this 1st day of March 
1966, is that virtually unanimously, with 
few exceptions, the Congress of the 
United States votes $4.8 billion additional 
authorization to defend freedom in 
South Vietnam. 
I support the President and this appro-
priation?the loyalty to the United States 
of those who do not certainly is no issue 
here. There are perhaps some outside 
this hall who would question the 
patriotism of anyone who expresses 
trepidation with respect to our commit-
ment in southeast Asia. I would say 
that anyone who is not concerned with 
discussing choices of procedure to ac-
complish peace and the freedom and 
progress of southeast Asians in the face 
of the obvious threats to the existence of 
mankind is a superpatriotic fool. 
No. 36-18 
All Americans, I believe, are impressed 
with our own ability in this country to 
aecumulate one-half of the production 
of the world by private enterprise, demo-
cratic, reasonably bloodless, hard work. 
There are none of us who would not want 
our system to work for the world as it 
does here. 
American policy since post-World War 
II is to spread the benefits of our system 
worldwide through Marshall plan aid, 
Agency for International Development, 
Alliance for Progress, food for peace, and 
kindred international organizations. We 
supplement our program through the 
most extensive military oversight sys-
tem ever designed on this globe, Peace 
Corps, tourism, and sundry other State, 
private, and Federal technical assistance 
programs. We have spent more money 
and given more people assistance under 
this program than other nation or group 
of nations in history. 
By and large we have been extremely 
successful with sophisticated people. The 
threat of communism which I under-
stand to be as a forsaking of liberty and 
justice and individual freedom in favor 
of a precisely managed socialistic dicta-
torship has been met and has been suc-
cessfully challenged. 
The trend for the left in Britain, Italy, 
France and Japan after World War II 
is now only a whisper because through 
our aid and their own creativeness these 
countries are economically successful. 
Were this not a fact, all of our guns and 
rockets could not have changed the tide. 
In the underdeveloped countries, how-
ever, of Africa, Asia and South America 
where poverty is rampant and popula-
tions are exploding, our "do good" policy 
has been questionably successful. A suc-
cess record for Japan, Taiwan and West-
ern Europe should be closely evaluated 
in relation to other restless countries un-
able to fathom the precedents we give 
to them. 
The problem is that we become mes-
merized with the term "communism." 
We know of the doctrine of Stalin, Khru-
shehey and Mao Tse-tung that they 
peacefully or forcefully plan to capture 
the imagination of peasants and rural 
people first in south Asia, then Africa, 
then South America, and we are set in 
panic. We remember Hitler said what he 
would do and in 10 years he almost did it. 
We see the Communists restless in their 
containment and we fear they will do the 
same. 
Communism should be contained?
there are many other ways where liberty 
Is not irrevocably lost by which people 
might develop and progress. History will 
no doubt record our age, I hope, as the 
great era when mankind conquered space 
and poverty through the programs de-
veloped in the competition between de-
mocracy and communism. I hope that 
the programs which ebb to the top as suc-
cessful are democratic. 
We Should not become paranoid, how-
ever, when the competition is discussed. 
I and many Americans would like to see 
the United States develop the leadership 
and the programs that will bring peace 
and prosperity to the underdeveloped 
world. When war breaks out, usually 
all hope of real progress is jeopardized. 
The problem is that if the United 
States is going to assume the stature of 
policeman of the world we should develop 
a realistic policy of helping people de-
clare effective wars on poverty and stag-
nation worldwide. We are the only na-
tion that literally has a military ring 
around the world?the only nation that 
can provide that needed cloak of protec-
tion. When we use that cloak to stamp 
out dictatorships of the right or left, we 
are working for the good of mankind. 
When we use that cloak and the CIA to 
stultify programs of people and per-
petuate military coups and dictatorships, 
we many times militate against the prog-
ress of peoples. 
When people's movements are ground-
ed in communism we are in a dilemma. 
The people's program to change poverty 
we should support?communism we fight, 
and rightfully. Not to recognize that 
Communist programs with their ham-
and-egg offerings appeal to many 
people, however, is to misread human 
nature. To handle such a movement of 
change when war does not break out is 
relatively easy. We step up our military 
assistance program to maintain the 
status quo and simultaneously step up 
AID efforts to promote economic devel-
opment. A military coup many times is 
superimposed and our purposes are con-
founded in local public opinion. The 
point is that we want to help people 
develop because that gives us security in 
the United States. However, we do not 
act with vigor until we are hit on the 
head with communism. 
When local war breaks out we are 
totally confounded as in southeast Asia 
today. We want to help people but 
things are so confused we do not know 
who to help or who to hurt. We are en-
gaged in a war which it is to our own 
and the world's interest not to formally 
declare. We want to fight communism 
wherever it might be, but we are obvi-
ously confused because we are forced to 
support six successive dictatorships, none 
of which were popularly elected, one of 
which only this morning very demo-
cratically announced the summary exe-
cution of a number of too enthusiastic 
merchants for the American dollar. 
I am pleased to see the United States 
now announce the $1 billion effort to 
solve the economic problems of South 
Vietnam, this sum apparently to consti-
tute the balm to salve the pangs of any 
would-be Communist supporters for a 
better economy. We certainly were not 
prepared to offer this kind of "dough" 
while the French had control and it is 
only now that we are psychologically 
prepared to support this kind of one 
small country commitment. If we want 
to be the policeman of the world, which 
role I frankly support, I think we should 
have better reflexes than this. 
We are now in this position where to 
prove our point we are dropping' bombs 
at a greater daily rate than during 
World War II. Our commitment as re-
ported in the newspapers is better than 
50,000 tons of TNT per month, or 500,-
000 250-pound bombs per month. It is 
obvious that if we only wound one Viet-
cong with every 10 bombs we would cas-
cade the enemy to the conference table

in 30 days. We now have in excess of 
200,000 men committed, joining 500,000 
South Vietnamese, plus 40,000 allied 
soldiers. Civilian casualties, I under-
stand, are fantastic, though American 
military deaths are light to date. We 
have a program to liberate territory and 
are making modest gains. However, the 
Vietcong today is twice as strong as they 
were last year this time, control more 
territory, and their main units are yet to 
be engaged. 
We are raising our level of support by 
a substantial percentage and I believe 
the fiscal year 1967 military budget, when 
it is properly supplemented next year, 
will again extend substantially our com-
mitment. 
We are expending ammunition at the 
greatest rate in history, perhaps expend-
ing on this undeclared war one-fourth 
of our national income?approximately 
$24 billion. We are thus drawn in. bat-
tle to defeat a so-called Vietcong and 
North. Vietnam who have a less budget 
for a year than we have in a month, who 
need but a few truckloads of materials a 
day to sustain them, who have no air 
force, no navy and certainly not a mod-
ern army. They do have tunnel and 
jungle sanctuaries that are difficult to 
penetrate. 
think then my judgment under these 
circumstances would be to gage care-
fully not only what we do but how we do 
it. We are really not so much ourselves 
trying to beat the Vietcong but trying to 
supplement the force of the free South 
Vietnamese so that the people them-
selves will want to rid themselves of the 
Vietcong. Barbarous executions by 
South Vietnamese and massive land 
scarring by B-52's and our artillery will 
not get the support of the people if 
nearly a million injured, refugees are 
forced into Saigon as was reported to-
day. 
it is possible that we can try too hard 
and lose the people. In a jury trial you 
can have a perfect plaintiff's case, but 
spend too much money on diagrams and 
witnesses and lose the jury. 
So in an election you can have an 
electable candidate, spend too much 
money and he is defeated by the elec-
torate because the money shows. 
The point is that money along will not 
win the war of ideas in South Vietnam. 
I do not think we can say realistically 
for long that the peasant just wants to 
be left alone, he has no philosophy, yet 
by night many of them make the best 
soldiers in the world. 
The people of South Vietnam are 
erupting in part by northern stimulation 
and in part by conditions. The stimu-
lation we can control, but we must de-
velop and sell long-term economic pro-
grains to change conditions, to control 
corruptions, to expand education, to 
democratize leadership, to abort class 
and caste systems and foreign economic 
domination. 
We must outline workable programs. 
it is not enough that we carry on a for-
eign aid program at the $3 billion-plus 
authorized level and $1 billion-plus ap-
propriated level and carry on a program 
largely with surplus grains and through 
the many times corrupt private sector 
and channel that aid to scores of coun-
tries. 
'We appropriate at the $2 billion level to 
change poverty in our domestic program 
in 3,000 counties-0E0. Are we suc-
cessful? How can we do the job world-
wide at this level where per capita in-
come is not $2,000 as in the United 
States but $100 as in nearby Mexico or 
less. 
The point is that we cannot ship sur-
plus materials with hands clasped across 
the boxes even at the greatest rate in 
history worldwide and then under our 
assumed worldwide police power declare 
that nations in our favor can qualify for 
this aid to more or less do as we do but 
that if this program is obviated by creep-
ing poverty, local corruption, dynastic 
domination or population explosion, we 
will blow your head off if you try to revolt 
if you are Communist tinged. 
Rightfully and in a good moral con-
science if the United States would stim-
ulate people rebellious against dictator-
ship oppression and poverty, where our 
aid programs are ineffective, maybe more 
rebellious people would be oriented to-
ward the U.S. middle ground rather than 
the extreme right or extreme left. 
In our efforts to maintain and per-
petuate our own security we should not 
be satisfied with a good try to defeat 
poverty worldwide. We should make our 
programs work. Where poverty and 
domination swell behind dormant dic-
tatorships, then should American foreign 
policy be to effect change by democrati-
cally oriented revolution if need be. 
Declare to the world, then, that the 
impoverished and the dominated will re-
ceive our support, not just a halfhearted 
effort and not just when communism is 
the competitor. This policy declared and 
followed then will mean a successful U.S. 
foreign Trolley?people will rally around 
us worldwide?this is the best and only 
effective containment policy?tins policy 
also will have a natural fallout of giving 
us security at home. 
It will mean a worldwide effort for 
perhaps our lifetimes by the United 
States and other successful democracies 
at a dollar level commitment not at cur-
rent foreign aid rates, but at. current mil-
itary South Vietnam rates. 
By my words of trepidation to the 
President concurrent with 77 of my col-
leagues this is what I mean. 
Mr. CLANCY. Mr. Chairmaa, I yield 
myself 10 minutes. 
(Mr. CLANCY asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. CLANCY. Mr. Chairman, I whole-
heartedly support HR. 12889 and the 
$4.8 billion of supplemental military au-
thorizations, primarily for southeast 
Asia. 
This supplemental authorization is 
needed in support of the American effort 
to help block Communist efforts to sub-
jugate all ,of Vietnam. 
Today, the one most compelling prob-
lem demanding our attention is the 
situation in Vietnam, and it is up to us 
to see that our military needs there are 
adequately funded. Our Nation's pri-
mary obligation is to fully support our 
men who have been sent to combat in 
South Vietnam. Wherever American 
boys are sent to battle they should be sup-
plied with the best possible weapons and 
with the best logistical support that we 
can give them. 
The passage of the bill we are now con-
sidering is indispensable to our military 
posture and preparedness. It is designed 
to insure that there will be no shortages 
in Vietnam so that our fighting men in 
the field can perform their mission with 
maximum efficiency. Overwhelming 
passage of this legislation will give 
needed assurance to our men in Vietnam 
that we are standing behind them 100 
percent. 
We now have more than 200,000 men 
actually deployed in South Vietnam. 
Added to this figure are the many thou-
sands who directly support them in 
southeast Asia. And our commitment in 
South Vietnam is growing daily in terms 
of men, material and money. 
We must not be content to fight just 
to keep from losing; rather, we must 
marshal our resuorces and concentrate 
our energies on winning this conflict in 
the shortest possible time. We must 
strive to avoid a long and bloody stale-
mate dragging on for years. It appears 
the Communists are testing our will and 
determination at this time and in this 
place to see how long they can drain our 
resources?particularly our manpower. 
They are counting heavily on a collapse 
of the American will to resist their ag-
gressive designs. 
Yes, our will and staying power are 
being tested by the Communists in this 
hard and bitter contest. It is obvious 
that the principal Communist objective 
is to get the United States involved to a 
maximum extent in a ground war of at-
trition in Asia in which our superiority 
in weaponry remains unused. 
It is mandatory that we undertake 
effective action to bring this struggle to 
a successful conclusion as quickly as 
possible. 
Certainly we would all prefer not to 
have to be there. However, aggressions 
left unchecked will continue to grow. It 
is in our best interests to repel this ag-
gression, but I urge that we do so with 
all deliberate speed. 
The legislation before us provides in 
the main authorization for appropria-
tions for the procurement of aircraft, 
missiles, and tracked vehicles, and for 
the construction of military installa-
tions. The authorization totals $4,857,-
450,000, which exceeds by $50 million 
the sum requested by the administra-
tion. It will provide the required author-
ity for the necessary appropriations to 
support military operations in southeast 
Asia. 
Section 401 of the bill provides that 
funds for the support of the South Viet-
namese armed forces and the other free 
world forces fighting in South Vietnam 
shall be derived from the regular appro-
priations for the support of our own 
military forces rather than from funds 
carried in the military assistance pro-
gram. We are advised that a transfer 
of this authority will result in improving 
procedures for supplying military items 
to the United States, Vietnamese, and 
other free world forces in Vietnam.

March 1, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD? HOUSE 4283 
It is unfortunate that the appropria-
tions requested last year were insufficient. 
I would be the first to concede that de-
velopments in a situation such as we find 
ourselves in Vietnam cannot be predicted 
precisely, and we must allow for flexi-
bility in our planning and judgments. 
My colleagues and I on the Armed 
Services Committee must rely to a great 
extent on the information and facts fur-
nished us in briefings by the Secretary 
when he appears before us. Yet, even a 
cursory review of the record indicates 
that he, too, is sometimes wrong in his 
assessments of the war in Vietnam, the 
U.S. role in that war, and in his 
short-term predictions of the outcome. 
It is my earnest hope that Secretary 
McNamara will give greater heed to the 
combined judgment of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff and that he will follow more 
closely recommendations made by them 
on military matters. The military ad-
vice he receives represents many years 
of experience. Experienced professional 
military judgments are most essential in 
aiding the Secretary to arrive at the 
crucial decisions he must make. 
Before closing my remarks I would like 
to urge once again that we lose no time 
in passing the bill under consideration. 
To win the struggle in Vietnam, we must 
unite as a nation to let the entire world 
know that we are going to make the nec-
essary sacrifices and bear the necessary 
costs to defeat the Communist aggres-
sion there. 
It is well to remember that the war in 
Vietnam is not primarily a war about 
Vietnam. It is a war which concerns the 
future of Asia, a war which could very 
well determine the future of the entire 
free world. I hope we will continue to 
honor our commitment to freedom in 
Vietnam, and we should take every step 
possible to insure that the struggle is 
brought to a successful conclusion in the 
shortest possible time. 
Mr. Chairman, I now yield to the 
gentleman from Alabama [Mr. GEORGE 
W. ANDREWS]. 
Mr. GEORGE W. ANDREWS. Mr. 
Chairman, I am supporting this bill 100 
percent. I think the sooner it becomes 
law the better off our fighting men in 
South Vietnam will be. 
Mr. Chairman, I want to say that in 
my opinion the vast majority of the peo-
ple in Alabama are supporting our Pres-
ident in this vicious war against com-
munism. Mr. Chairman, I want to say 
that there has not been a draft card 
burned in Alabama; there has not been 
a beatnik-led demonstration against our 
foreign policy in Alabama. We have had 
some beatnik-led demonstrations down 
there that did not concern our foreign 
policy. I will predict to you if such a 
demonstration as that occurs in Ala-
bama, somebody is going to get hurt. 
Now, Mr. Chairman, I think the sooner 
we fight this war to win the better off 
the whole world will be. I think the 
greatest, most courageous decision made 
in the history of this Nation was made 
by former President Harry Truman when 
he ordered the use of an atomic weapon 
on Hiroshima. He served notice on the 
Japanese Government that if they did 
not surrender, they could expect further 
bombings within 3 days. Hearing 
nothing from the Japanese, the second 
bomb fell on Nagasaki. You know the 
story. That courageous action fore-
stalled the bloodiest invasion that had 
ever been planned in the history of this 
world and saved hundreds of thousands, 
if not millions, of lives. If I were run-
ning this war, Mr. Chairman, I would 
pick up the telephone and call Hanoi 
and say, "We will give you 30 days to 
get out of South Vietnam lock, stock, and 
barrel. If you are not out at the end of 
that time, then you can expect ,us to drop 
whatever type bombs we desire, wherever 
we choose to drop those bombs," and let 
us get this thing over with and bring 
those boys back. I know the argument 
against that is that you might endanger 
the lives of the people in this country. 
Now, this is war that we are in, Mr. 
Chairman. 
We should all share the jeopardy. I 
am thinking of that kid in that rice 
paddy and in that snake-infested, ma-
laria-infested, sniper-infested jungle 
whose life is in danger and in jeopardy 
24 hours a day. Let us bring this war 
to an early conclusion. I tell you in my 
opinion there is nothing that the Com-
munists respect more than power. We 
have it today; let us use it and get 
through with this war. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gen-
tleman from New York [Mr. BiNGHAml. 
(Mr. BINGHAM asked and was given 
permission to revise and extend his re-
marks.) 
Mr. BINGHAM. Mr. Chairman, ear-
lier today the distinguished gentleman 
from California [Mr. COHELANI submit-
ted a brief joint statement on behalf of 
78 members of this House. I was priv-
ileged to be among the sponsors of this 
statement. 
I shall vote for HR. 12889 for the pur-
pose stated in the committee report. 
But, in so voting. I do have reservations, 
and these reservations go somewhat be-
yond the terms of this joint statement. 
My vote does not mean that I am wholly 
satisfied with the administration's poli-
cies with respect to Vietnam. While I 
agree with President Johnson that we 
cannot withdraw from Vietnam and let 
the Communists take over, and while I 
salute him for resisting the pressures of 
those who would expand and escalate 
the war, I do not believe that we have 
yet been sufficiently resourceful or flexi-
ble in our efforts to get negotiations 
started. In fact, recent developments 
create the impression that the adminis-
tration is no longer giving much thought 
to the question of how to achieve a 
negotiated settlement. 
Why, then, am I voting for this sup-
plemental authorization bill? First, for 
the simple and obvious reason, mentioned 
in the joint statement, that we must give 
our forces in Vietnam all the support 
they need, so long as they are there. The 
second reason is more complicated: I fear 
that a substantial vote against the au-
thorization might actually impede our 
objective of getting talks started by en-
couraging Hanoi to continue its appar-
ently total intransigeance. 
This leads to a question which I sub-
mit we should all pander. It is certainly 
one of the key questions before us at this 
time. The question is: Why, in spite of 
all the President's efforts since last April 
to get discussions started with Hanoi, has 
Iianoi steadfastly refused to budge? 
Rather than discuss this question to-
day, in the atmosphere of a debate on 
this defense authorization bill, I intend 
to examine it at some length tomorrow 
under special orders, and I would be glad 
to have any Members join in a discussion 
of the question at that time. 
Mr. CLANCY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
3 minutes to the gentleman from New 
York [Mr. KUPFER1VIAN]. 
(Mr. KUPFERMAN asked and was 
given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. KUPFERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I 
sin voting for this appropriation because 
I cannot leave our American troops in 
the lurch without proper protection on 
a foreign shore. But it must be pointed 
out that it was a great mistake to have 
put them and us in this position. 
The biography of General Ridgeway, 
in discussing the filling of the vacuum in 
Indochina when the French pulled out 
in 1954, shows that we could only be in-
volved in a stalemate at great loss to the 
United States in lives and money. 
We should not have been put in our 
present position. We should not have 
been involved in an escalation. We 
should not have waited so long to bring 
the question to the United Nations. 
When the administration states that 
it seeks no blind escalation, we must 
question whether it has not already done 
so and left us in the lurch. 
An article by Murray Kempton in the 
New York World-Telegram and Sun on 
Friday, February 25, 1966 entitled, "Clear 
Sighted Escalation" well describes the 
situation into which we have been led. 
I should like to insert Mr. Kempton's 
article in the RECORD at this point. 
The only course left to us to pursue, 
as my predecessor, now Mayor Lindsay, 
has said, is hard diplomacy to seek 
peace. 
CLEAR-SIGHTED ESCALATION 
(By Murray Kempton) 
"The tide of battle in Vietnam has turned 
In our favor."?Vice President Humsrmsy on 
his return. 
It will be 5 years in June since another 
Vice President came back from Saigon. 
"There has been a substantial improve-
ment in the situation in Vietnam," Lyndon 
Johnson said then. 
There were 685 American military advisers 
In South Vietnam at the time. The Vice 
President brought a promise to raise the 
total to 1,600 or so. But the real danger, he 
said, Is not from communism but "from 
hunger, ignorance, poverty, and disease." 
Privately, the Vice President told President 
Kennedy that "American combat involve-
ment at this time was * * * undesirable 
because it would revive anticolonial emo-
tions throughout Asia." 
For this is a war that has always been 
going well. 
Even so, by October of 1961, Gen. Maxwell 
Taylor went to Saigon and came back to re-
port that, while only the Vietnamese could 
beat the Vietcong, more American troops 
were needed to show them how to do the 
job. President Kennedy was skeptical.

"The troops will march in," he said, "and 
in 4 days everyone will have forgotten. It's 
like taking a drink. The effect wears off and 
you have to take another." 
Still, in December 1962, he ordered larger 
commitments to Saigon. Everyone was en-
couraged. That spring, Secretary of Defense 
McNamara went, to South Vietnam for the 
that time. "Every quantitative measure-
ment we have," he reported. "shows that we 
are winning the war." 
Taylor came back in October of 1962. and 
Found "a, great national movement" assem-
bling to destroy the Vietcong. "The spear 
point of aggression has been blunted in 
South Vietnam," the President said in his 
1963 state of the Union message. 
Prime Minister Ngo Dinh Diem was hay-
MT, his troubles by then and none of our 
official tourists echoed Vice President John-
son's assessment of Diem as the Churchill 
of Asia. Still, in October, Secretary Mc-
Namara, said that a thousand of the 16,000 
American troops in Vietnam could be 
brought home by the end of the year and 
that the major part of the military job 
would be finished by 1965. 
So, by Christmas of 1965, we had more 
than 200,000 Americans under arms in 
South Vietnam, and the Vietcong had risen 
from their 12,000 at the time of Lyndon 
Johnson's confident introduction to the 
problem in 1961, to more than 230,000. 
There was never a time when the thing 
was not said to be going well, and here we 
are at a moment when it is impossible to 
deny that, until now, it has all along been 
going very badly indeed. 
There is no way to imagine the delight 
of our enemies in our situation except to 
think what would be our own pleasure if 
there were 200,000 Chinese struggling 
through Indonesia or 200,000 Russians wal-
lowing in Albania without one of our soldiers 
to the smallest degree inconvenienced. 
Ilaad poor President Johnson, since all 
these disasters come from the careful plans 
of Democrats, is reduced to a dreadful 
mangling of history in order to argue that a 
series of decisions, which time has proved 
to have been based on mistaken estimates, 
where part of a sober, coherent plan now 
turning toward fulfillment. We can believe 
lam when he says that we have no cause to 
fear a mindless escalation. It is quite 
enough to remember the history of the last 
5 years and recognize that everything that 
was done was so carefully thought out. 
Mr. CLANCY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
1 minute to the gentleman from New 
York I Mr. Rm.!. 
(Mr. REID of New York asked and 
was given permission to revise and ex-
tend his remarks.) 
Mr. REID of New York. Mr. Chalr-
man, I rise in support of HR. 12889, a 
supplemental authorization of $4.8 bil-
lion for necessary procurement, research 
and development, and military construc-
tion. 
Mr. Chairman, I have been in Vietnam. 
I have been with our troops, and I can 
report to this House that their morale 
is absolutely magnificent and is deserv-
ing of the fullest support. 
Further, Mr. Chairman, there should 
be no doubt whatsoever in Hanoi or 
Peiping that the United States of Amer-
ica will totally and completely back its 
men in the field while at all times utiliz-
ing every resource of diplomacy--includ-
ing the U.N.?to reach the conference 
table and an honorable and viable 
peace. 
:However, Mr. Chairman, I believe that 
this debate today is important. It is on 
a serious subject. It deals with many 
implications for the future of American 
policy, the chances for peace, and the 
opportunity?free from terror and ag-
gression?for South Vietnam to do the 
job that must be done in rural recon-
struction and pacification backed by 
major reforms?including education and 
land reforms?by the government in 
Saigon. 
Mr. Chairman, I am sorry that the 
debate here in this House, compared with 
the other body, is very limited; that we 
are only devoting 3 hours to one of the 
most important subjects ever to come 
before these United States Frankly, 
we have not conducted a serious national 
debate here today, and I regrei it. How-
ever, I strongly support this authoriza-
tion. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Cart dia. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield such time as he may 
require to the gentleman from Louisiana 
[Mr. LONG]. 
(Mr. LONG of Louisiana ask t A and was 
given permission to revise and extend his 
remarks.) 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Chair-
man, I rise to give my full support to 
H.R. 12889 and urge its immediate pas-
sage. 
The duty we owe to our fighting men is 
clear. Those men and women who to-
day are performing so nobly to guarantee 
a continuing place for freedom in our 
world must be as fully supplied with the 
equipment necessary for them to do their 
jobs as it is possible for us to give them. 
Their sacrifices are incalculable. We 
must not fail in our duty to them, 
Few individuals outside our own mili-
tary forces are acquainted with the tre-
mendous effort being made by our forces 
in Vietnam. Focus your attent, on on the 
wide role played by any one of our serv-
ices. Our Navy, for example, is involved 
in almost every facet of the conflict. Its 
flexibility, mobility, and ability to extend 
our national power through every medi-
um has been well demonstrated. 
In the air, fighters and boothers are 
flying combat sorties well into North 
Vietnam. Three carriers from the 7th 
Fleet are on station off Vietnam at all 
times. Two of these giant warships, 
each with their 100-plane airwings, 
strike at North Vietnamese infiltration 
routes 24 hours a day. The third car-
rier, operating further south off the Viet-
namese coast, provides air support for 
United States and Allied ground forces 
in South Vietnam. 
Destroyers, the workhorses of the fleet, 
cruise the waters of the South China Sea. 
These ships have fired an average of 
12,000 rounds a month?more :,,han 160 
tons of o.rdnance?against the Vietcong 
targets. In addition to bombardment, 
our destroyers are carrying out missions 
in antisubmarine warfare, search and 
rescue, and protection of the fast carrier 
striking forces. Other craft are on con-
stant alert for possible shipment, of sup-
plies into South Vietnam. Thousands of 
junks are detected: and searched each 
week. Still other ships carry thousands 
of marines ashore and thousands more 
are ferried in behind the enemy in heli-
copters from amphibious assault ships. 
1, 1966 
Logistics is an area of naval activity 
which cannot be overlooked. Over 94 
percent of the logistic support for all 
U.S. Forces operating in Vietnam is 
brought in by sea. Ashore, more than 
10,000 Navy personnel are providing sup-
port. Seabee units are at work con-
structing bases in the jungles of Viet-
nam, Navy hospital corpsmen are car-
rying out their duties with units, arid of-
ficers are performing advisory roles with 
the Vietnamese Navy and river assault 
groups. 
Gentlemen, these operations depend on 
our authorization of the appropriations 
for the procurement of the aircraft, mis-
siles, and equipment needed for the job. 
This bill enables us to continue acquisi-
tion of these things during the remainder 
of fiscal 1966. The committee under the 
leadership of its illustrious chairman has 
studied carefully the needs reflected by 
this bill and is convinced of the sound-
ness of the bill. Their vote on the bill 
was unanimous. I heartily endorse that 
. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. 
vote. 
Mr.
I yield 1 minute to the gentle-
man from Missouri [Mr. Iceman]. 
Mr. ICHORD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in 
support of Ha. 12889 authorizing the 
appropriation of $4,857,450,000 for the 
procurement of aircraft, missiles, naval 
vessels, tracked combat vehicles, re-
search, development, test, evaluation, 
and military construction for the support 
of our troops in South Vietnam. This 
authorization, Mr. Chairman, represent-
ing a supplemental authorization for the 
fiscal year of 1966 is vitally needed to 
support our troops. 
It has been asked for by the President 
of the United States, the Commander 
in Chief of our Armed Forces as neces-
sary to accomplish our objectives, in 
South Vietnam. It has been supported 
by the Secretary of Defense and Joint 
Chiefs of Staff. It has been unanimously 
recommended by the House Committee 
on Armed Services. This measure must 
be passed to meet the commitment this 
body itself made when it passed the 
Tonkin resolution of August 10, 1964 by 
a vote of 416 to 0. 
The time for debate is past. The time 
for action is now. This is not only to 
carry out a commitment of the Executive. 
This is a commitment of the Congress 
itself and we should show the Communist 
aggressors not only in southeast Asia but 
all over the world that we are united in 
our determination to stop Communist 
aggression. 
Mr. Chairman, Winston Churchill 
said: 
It is the duty of every citizen in time of 
trouble to do or say or even think of nothing 
that can weaken or discourage the energies 
of the state. 
This statement, in my opinion, can well 
serve as a standard of conduct for all 
Americans in regard to South Vietnam. 
The questioning of our policy now which 
we committed ourself to on August 10, 
1964 can only serve to weaken the state 
and give encouragement to our enemies. 
This is our time to say something which 
will strengthen and encourage our men 
in South Vietnam. We should speak out

with an overwhelming vote in favor of 
this measure. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gen-
tleman from Ohio [Mr. Lays]. 
Mr. LOVE. Mr. Chairman, I sup-
ported this bill and in so doing support 
the administration and its policy in Viet-
nam. I naturally feel that this bill is 
necessary to support our forces in south-
east Asia but I especially like the psy-
chological impact it can make at this 
time in the world of ideas and the need 
for unity in our own country. My re-
marks are in extension of research, de-
velopment, test and evaluation supple-
ment for the Air Force as set forth in 
pages 5 of the committee's report. 
The fiscal year 1966 southeast Asia sup-
port supplemental for the research, de-
velopment, test and evaluation, Air 
Force appropriation amounts to $71,-
085,000. These funds are required for 
immediate initiation of developments in-
volving two aircraft weapons systems, de-
velopment and test of an item under the 
chemical/biological operational support 
program, development and test of a num-
ber of items in the conventional muni-
tions program, and a classified project. 
The aircraft and related equipment 
program amounts to $36,300,000 which 
provides for two engineering develop-
ment programs under the close support 
fighter program. These developments, 
which will increase our capabilities for 
close air support of ground forces in 
southeast Asia, consist of $10 million for 
development and test of modifications to 
the F-4 (TSF) aircraft to improve its 
performance capabilities, and $26,300,-
000 for development and test of modifica-
tions to the A-7A aircraft to adapt this 
Navy aircraft to meet Air Force re-
quirements. 
The other equipment program amounts 
to $34,785,000 which provides for an ad-
vanced development program require-
ment, a number of items in the engineer-
ing development program, and a 
general support program development 
requirement. In the advanced develop-
ment program, $1,600,000 is included 
for development and test of a conven-
tional munitions component. In the en-
gineering development program, $250,000 
is provided for development and test of 
a munition under the chemical/biological 
Operational support program, and $7,-
735,000 is provided for a number of 
munitions and other projects under the 
other operational support program. The 
general support program includes $25,-
200,000 for development of a specialized 
collection activities program system. 
The fiscal year 1966 southeast Asia 
support supplemental for this appropria-
tion includes only the most urgent devel-
opments which can be made available to 
combat forces before June 30, 1967. 
Therefore, the items selected are those 
whose lead times are so long that they 
cannot be deferred until the fiscal year 
1967 appropriation becomes available. 
Mr. BATES. Mr. Chairman, I yield 
to the gentleman from rilinois [Mr. 
ANDERSON] such time as he may require. 
(Mr. ANDERSON of rilinois asked 
and was given permission to revise and 
extend his remarks.) 
Mr. ANDERSON of Illinois. Mr. 
Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 12889, 
the supplemental defense authorization 
bill. At an hour when more than 200,000 
American men are locked in mortal com-
bat with the enemy in southeast Asia, 
it is inconceivable to me that as Rep-
resentatives of the people in the Congress 
we would do less than support this bill. 
It is a bill designed purely and simply 
to authorize the necessary supplemental 
funds required to fund military procure-
ment of needed items. There have been 
some suggestions both in the debate here 
on the floor today and elsewhere that 
something more should be read into this 
vote than an approval or authorization 
of necessary funding for the American 
Armed Forces. Indeed, there have been 
times today when it seemed as if certain 
Members of this body wished that there 
could be two separate and distinct votes 
on this measure. One vote would permit 
those who are simply in favor of doing 
something for the boys to vote "aye." 
The other vote would be for those who 
not only wished to authorize funds for 
the Department of Defense but simul-
taneously to give a ringing and rousing 
approval to everything past, present, and 
future that has been or will be done by 
the Johnson administration. 
Certainly, there is nothing in the word-
ing of the legislation now before us which 
explicitly commits anyone to an approval 
of the various policies that have been 
pursued by the administration with re-
spect to the matter of Vietnam. It 
could be argued that implicit in the ap-
proval of this authorization bill is the 
approval of current policy. However, I 
think that we would be establishing an 
unwise precedent indeed if we were to 
attempt to read too much into the passage 
of a military authorization bill. By the 
same token, I think that the 76 Members 
of this body who have signed a manifesto 
or declaration that their vote for this 
measure does not carry with it approval 
for th escalation of the war or our 
deeper involvement in southeast Asia will 
also "carry coals to Newcastle." 
Mr. Chairman, I have no qualms at 
all concerning the legality of our present 
position in South Vietnam as expressed 
In a recent resolution of the American 
Bar Association. I think our presence 
there is legal under international law, 
under the SEATO treaty to which we 
are a signatory, and under the Charter 
of the United Nations. However, I think 
that the future actions of the present 
administration with respect to the con-
duct of the war in South Vietnam must 
be based on a clear declaration of what 
our ultimate purpose there is to be. I am 
not convinced that the administration 
has been absolutely clear in this regard. 
In particular, I am concerned at the 
obvious attempts that have taken place 
recently to gloss over the differences that 
apparently were opened up between the 
administration and the junior Senator 
from New York when the latter spoke 
in favor of admitting the Vietcong to a 
share of power and responsibility in 
South Vietnam. Rather than attempt to 
paper over internal differences of such 
fundamental nature, I think that the 
administration should make it crystal 
clear that our boys are not dying in South 
Vietnam merely so that we can ultimately 
repair to the bargaining table perhaps 
to hand over a portion of the government 
of that country to the Vietcong. There-
fore, Mr. Chairman, I take this time to 
set down these words so that my position 
may be irrevocably clear. I support this 
measure and with it the heroic sacrifices 
being made by our men in South Viet-
nam. At the same time I do not want 
history to record that by this vote I gave 
this administration my blank check with 
respect to its future conduct of policy in 
South Vietnam. 
Mr. BATES. Mr. Chairman, I have no 
further requests for time, and yield back 
the balance of my time. 
Mr. RIVERS of South Carolina. Mr. 
Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentle-
man from Missouri [Mr. RANDALL]. 
Mr. RANDALL. Mr. Chairman, our 
fighting men are committed in Vietnam 
and we have passed the time for much 
more debate. It seems to me we should 
be more concerned about getting the im-
plements and tools of war to them so that 
they can do the job. I think we might 
pause for a monment to reflect that this 
is the first time in all of our American 
history that we have ever stopped in the 
middle of a fighting war to debate how 
we got into the war and why and whether 
it was a wise thing to do. That is ex-
actly what we have been doing for far 
too long. 
Mr. RYAN. Mr. Chairman, will the 
gentleman yield? 
Mr. RANDALL. I yield to the gentle-
man. 
Mr. RYAN. Has war been declared 
by the Congress? 
Mr. RANDALL. It has been brought 
out crystal clear that the joint resolution 
unanimously agreed to by this House, 
416 to 0 on August 7, 1964, is a sufficient 
declaration to authorize the President 
to conduct military operations in south-
east Asia. 
The southeast Asian resolution stated 
"that the Congress approves and sup-
ports the President as Commander in 
Chief to take all necessary measures to 
repel any armed attack against the forces 
of the United States and to prevent 
further aggression." The resolution was 
very firm and included the recitation: 
The United States regards as vital to its 
national interest and to world peace the 
maintenance of peace and security in south-
east Asia. 
Mr. RYAN. Does the gentleman con-
strue that resolution to be a declaration 
of war? 
? Mr. RANDALL. Not a formal decla-
ration, but for my part the resolution 
provides ample authority and I think 
also, for the overwhelming majority of 
fellow Members, as will be shown by the 
vote on this bill today. 
The situation as to Vietnam is that 
the President has ordered a gradual 
buildup of forces only after frequent con-
sultations with the Congress. The Con-
gress has repeatedly expressed its ap-
proval not only through the August 1964 
resolution but by monetary appropria-
tions for the war. Exclusive of the 
measure before us today, the Congress 
has overwhelmingly approved two sup-

plemental appropriations including the 
$1.7 billion southeast Asia emergency 
fund passed on September 17, 1965, di-
rectly after the President announced his 
intention to increase our military par-
ticipation. in that area. There have been 
frequent consultations by the President 
with Congress, both by resolution arid by 
appropriation and by both means we have 
overwhelmingly approved the President's 
policy. The Congress' strongest weapon 
in foreign policy is through control of 
appropriations. Approval of these mone-
tary sums should be recognized as con-
stituting firm support of the President's 
authority to conduct war in Vietnam 
without a formal declaration of war by 
the Congress. There exist some valid 
reasons why there should not be a formal 
declaration of war. 
Mr. Chairman, there has been a lot .of 
humanitarian concern about injury or 
harm to a few Vietnamese civilians in the 
.jungles of Vietnam. If this has hap-
pened, it has been accidental and un-
avoidable and not by design or 
intentional. 
But I want to take the time to discuss 
sonic items in this authorization that 
were touched on briefly by the gentleman 
from Missouri I Mr_ HALL 1. 
refer to funds for more and better 
'field hospitals and evacuation facilities. 
know you have heard about the new 
hospital ship and also those new portable 
operating rooms that can be brought in 
by helicopter and permit on operation to 
be performed very near the scene of com-
bat. Let in; remember the present rate of 
fatalities among our American wounded 
is less than I percent. That represents 
a drop from the 2.5 percent level of 
1.</div></div></div>  </div>
