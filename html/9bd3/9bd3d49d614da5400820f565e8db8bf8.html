 VIETNAM
 Hanoi's invitation to Ghanaian President Nkrumah, follow-
 ing its rejection of the Commonwealth Peace Mission, is
 presumably aimed at winning sympathy from Afro-Asian
 states it considers neutral.  Both Hanoi and Peiping
 this week declared new determination to continue the
 war until the US is driven out of Vietnam, and a joint
 communique issued in Peiping suggests substantial new
 Chinese aid commitments.  Peiping evidently hopes that
 the Viet Cong will keep up the momentum of their offen-
 sive in the South in the face of the US military build-up
 there, but that offensive has decreased in intensity
 for the second week.
 CURRENT SOVIET ATTITUDE TOWARD BERLIN
 Moscow has been extremely cautious in its actions in
 the highly sensitive Berlin area at a time when the
 Vietnam conflict is increasing frictions in Soviet-US
 relations.
 USSR BECOMING MORE ACTIVE IN WESTERN MARKETS
 With Soviet purchases of Western manufacturing plants
 beginning to firm up, the USSR is making new efforts to
 increase its exports to earn hard currency for financing
 its imports.
 SOVIET CROP PROSPECTS DETERIORATE
 Insufficient rainfall makes the outlook for the spring
 wheat crop especially bleak, and significant new grain
 imports may be necessary this year.
 POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN POLAND
 While there is probably no substance to rumors that Go-
 mulka is ill and about to be replaced, they reflect the
 widespread dissatisfaction with the party leader's stub-
 bornly conservative policies.

 The Amri cabinet is under Egyptian control despite the

 military offensive.  Khartoum has virtually given up
 trying for a political solution.

 Mauritania's recent recognition of Communist China and

 President Kasavubu has clearly indicated during the
 past week that he intends to cut Premier Tshombe down
 to size, if not force him to resign.  Tshomb6's reac-

 The leftists stand to gain more influence following last

 SECRET        -
 There have been several re-
 cent indications of an increas-
 ing warmth in Sino-Vietnamese
 relations.    Two North Vietnamese
 politburo-level delegations in
 Peiping last week expressed ef-
 fusive praise for Chinese as-
 sistance to the DRV in contrast
 with a more perfunctory expres-
 sion of gratitude for Soviet aid
 a week earlier.
 Hoang Van Hoan--on the first
 leg of a friendship visit to
 China, North Korea, Mongolia,
 and the USSR--in a 15 July speech
 described Chinese aid to Vietnam
 as "the firmest, the most power-
 ful, and the most effective,"
 and called China "the most en-
 thusiastic and resolute comrade-
 in-arms of all nations fighting
 against the imperialists."  Hoan
 also credited the Chinese with
 "holding high the banner of anti-
 revisionism."  This is the first
 open attack on revisionism by a
 Vietnamese politburo member
 since last fall, and seems
 clearly critical of Moscow.
 The language of a joint com-
 mumiqud signed by a high-level
 DRV economic delegation in Pei-
 ping on 17 July was along similar
 lines.   It noted "enormous sup-
 port" and "steadfast" assistance
 already received from China and
 paid tribute to "beloved and re-
 spected" Mao Tse-tung.   The com-
 muniqud stated that new Chinese
 economic and technical aid had
 been granted with a view to
 "jointly defeating" the US. The
 tenor of the communiqud suggests
 that Peiping may have extended
 substantial new commitments in
 an effort to ensure that the
 morale and momentum of the Viet-
 namese Communist offensive will
 riot be affected by the US mili-
 tary build-up in Vietnam.
 Neither the Peiping nor the
 Moscow communique spelled out
 the form or amount of assistance
 but both indicated that the new
 aid pacts were in part aimed at
 improving North Vietnamese mili-
 tary defense capabilities.
 The agreement  signed by the
 same DRY delegation the previous
 week in Moscow made no reference
 to gratuitous assistance and de-
 scribed the talks only as "cordial
 conversations" in a "spirit of
 complete understanding."
 While seeking military sup-
 port from other members of the Com-
 munist bloc, the, North Vietnamese
 are also attempting to win sym-
 pathy from Afro-Asian states they
 probably consider at least neutral.
 They have invited Ghanaian Presi-
 dent Nkrumah to visit the DRV in
 a personal capacity and not as
 part of the Commonwealth Peace
 Mission.   In rejecting the mission
 itself, the North Vietnamese, had
 few qualms about the sensitivities
 of the British but they want to
 avoid offending its other members.
 A delegation headed by Ghana's
 high commissioner ambassador in
 the UK, Kwasi Armah, left London
 for Hanoi on 20 July apparently
 to pave the way for Nkrumah, who
 is reportedly scheduled to go there
 within a week.
 While making this gesture
 toward reasonableness, the North
 Vietnamese have also made it clear
 that negotiations to settle the

 war are not what they have in
 mind.  On 19 July, Ho Chi Minh,
 speaking at a celebration com-
 memorating the 1954 Geneva Ac-
 cords, said that the Vietnamese
 Communists intended to fight on
 to victory if it takes five, ten,
 or twenty years.
 This line was echoed by the.
 Chinese in a 20 July People's
 Daily editorial which asserted
 that the withdrawal of US troops
 was "the basic point and the most
 important prerequisite" for a
 Vietnam settlement and that there
 was "no point" in talking about
 other aspects so long as US
 forces remain.   Emphasizing
 Peiping's determination to see
 that fighting continues until
 the US is driven out, the edi-
 torial warned that, if necessary,
 the war will be carried on by
 generations to come.
 The Fighting in the South
 Viet Cong activity has de-
 creased for the second consecu-
 tive week, with a concomitant
 reduction of casualties on both
 sides.  The one battalion-size
 Viet Cong attack, on 14-15 July,
 resulted in 130 casualties in
 two government companies defend-
 ing a regimental headquarters in
 northern Binh Duong Province,
 north of Saigon.  On 19-20 July,
 after inflicting nearly 90 cas-
 ualties in a night-long attack
 on a government Special Forces
 camp at Bu Dop in adjacent Phuoc
 Long Province, the Viet Cong
 withdrew under pressure of air
 attacks but have continued to
 harass the camp intermittently.
 Scattered attacks against dis-
 trict  towns in the I,  II, and
 III Corps zones have continued,
 as have acts of sabotage against
 lines of communication.
 On the government side,  12
 battalions with supporting engi-
 neer, artillery, and air units
 on 16 July launched a major clear-
 ing operation along Route 19
 linking the port of Qui Nhon with
 the highland provincial capital
 of Pleiku.   For several months,
 effective Viet Cong control of
 this highway had prevented land
 resupply shipments.   A strike ex-
 ecuted by B-52 SAC bombers from
 Guam on 17 July assisted Viet-
 namese marines in clearing a
 chokepoint at Mang Yang Pass,
 and several supply convoys have
 since moved over the road en-
 countering no Viet Cong resist-
 ance.   To the south, two rein-
 forced government battalions were
 also unopposed in conducting a
 three-day road-clearing operation
 last week along Route 15, connect-
 ing Bien Hoa with the port city
 of Vung Tau.   In an earlier road-
 clearing operation on Route 1 near
 the Quang Nam - Quang Tin Province
 border area, however, government
 troops attacked a Viet Cong am-
 bush position on 15 July and in-
 curred 122 casualties while kill-
 ing 174 Viet Cong and taking 145
 suspects.
 On the basis of interrogation
 reports and captured documents,
 the US Military Assistance Command
 in Saigon reports an increase of
 4,450 in Viet Cong combat strength
 for a new estimated total of 53,000
 combat regulars.   The increase re-
 sults in part from the filling out

 tional Viet Cong battalions.
 Meanwhile, the arrival of com-
 bat elements of the US First
 Division and additional logistic
 personnel has increased Ameri-
 can strength in. South Vietnam
 to almost 73,000.
 South Vietnamese Politics
 The political situation in
 South Vietnam remains generally
 quiet.   Chief of State General
 Thieu, speaking on 20 July at a
 major rally in Saigon marking
 the anniversary of the 1954 Ge-
 neva Accords as a "day of shame,"
 declared the agreements and the
 line dividing North and South
 Vietnam "no longer valid."  Gen-
 uine peace, he said, would come
 only when the Communists had
 been driven out of all of Viet-
 nam.   Thieu's speech and simi-
 lar recent remarks by Premier
 Ky are part of an intensified
 effort to whip up stronger popu-
 lar support for the war effort.
 Some rumblings of dis-
 content with the new military
 regime continue to be heard,
 although the death of Colonel
 Pham Ngoc Thao removes one per-
 sistent coup plotter from the
 scene.   Thao, a militant Catho-
 lic involved in several plots
 to overthrow various administra-
 tions in Saigon over the past few
 years, reportedly died of wounds
 suffered when he was ambushed by
 security forces on 16 July.   His
 death, and a subsequent govern-
 ment suspension of a militant
 Catholic newspaper in Saigon,
 could stir new resentments in
 Catholic circles.

 CURRENT SOVIET ATTITUDE TOWARD BERLIN
 Moscow has been extremely
 cautious in its actions in the
 highly sensitive Berlin area at a
 time when the Vietnam conflict is
 increasing frictions in Soviet-US
 relations.   Soviet party and gov-
 ernment leaders, along with the
 Soviet press, have in recent months
 avoided any provocative statements
 on Berlin and have been careful
 not to link events there with So-
 viet strategic interests.
 Soviet officials in
 East Germany (GDR) have played
 down the significance of recent
 East German moves related to Ber-
 lin and have stressed that the So-
 viets retain control over such
 moves.
 Such statements seem primarily
 designed to convince the US that
 recent GDR actions are merely part
 of a campaign to advance East Ger-
 man claims of sovereignty and are
 not intended to provoke a crisis
 over basic Allied rights.
 General Petr Koshevoy, com-
 mander of Soviet forces in Germany,
 told British officers that all pi-
 lots, Soviet or East German, "obey
 me without question," that he per-
 sonally controls all aircraft in
 the GDR, and that recent helicopter
 violations of the East - West Ger-
 man border were "small mistakes"
 caused by a lack of radar control
 for low-flying aircraft,
 He also played down the East
 German helicopter flights over
 Berlin.   No identifiable East Ger-
 man helicopter flights near the
 West Berlin borders have occurred
 since 21 June.   Earlier, the Allies
 had noted seven helicopter viola-
 tions of West Berlin air space,
 but the Soviets have not acknowl-
 edged  any of them.
 Koshevoy's line reinforces one
 taken earlier by the Soviet coun-
 selor in East Berlin.   He told the
 French minister that there was no
 foundation to rumors of a crisis
 over Berlin, and that nobody in-
 tended to modify the present situa-
 tion in Germany.
 Since their harassment campaign
 to protest the Bundestag session in
 West Berlin last April, the Soviets
 have insisted that they oppose any
 alteration in what they regard as
 the status quo (the existence of
 "two German states," with West Ber-
 lin as a "separate entity" under
 temporary Allied occupation).
 Koshevoy's remarks indicate
 that there will probably be no heli-
 copter flights over West Berlin
 in the near future.   They are,  how-
 ever, likely'to occur again elsewhere
 in the Berlin Control Zone.   The
 Communists may hope to use the
 threat of future flights to press
 the Federal Republic for conces
 sions on other matters.
 the GDR was not planning any
 more flights over West Berlin.
 In return, it.wanted Bonn to re-
 lease funds requested for the sur-
 render to West Germany of prisoners
 held on a variety of charges.

 Soviet purchases of manufac-
 turing plants in Western markets
 are firming up.   Negotiations
 which have been in process for
 some time are now being concluded
 or are moving closer to resolu-
 tion.   New possibilities are be-
 ing discussed at high levels--
 talks which probably will assure
 some results.   Moscow's main in-
 terest continues to center on the
 chemicals production field and on
 consumer goods.   Most recently,
 the Soviets have been seeking of-
 fers of an automobile production
 facility.
 Moscow has not neglected the
 export side of its trade with the
 West, which must increase to fi-
 nance plant imports.   The ever-
 present threat of crop failures at
 home  (see next article)  and a con-
 tinuing requirement to buy grain
 abroad--probably at least $175 mil-
 lion worth this year--add to the
 USSR's chronic need to earn hard
 currency.   In addition to using
 traditional sales promotion meas-
 ures to broaden their export markets,
 Soviet traders are insisting that
 Western suppliers accept from 10 to
 100 percent of navment in Soviet
 Prospects for the 1965 So-
 viet                   harvest,   especially wheat,
 have worsened in recent weeks be-
 cause of below-average rainfall
 over extensive areas.     The outlook
 for winter wheat is close to nor-
 mal, but the spring wheat crop,
 which normally accounts for al-
 most two thirds of total wheat pro-
 duced, has been affected by the
 drought.   The drought is especially
 bad in the New Lands, the major
 producing area of spring wheat, and
 unless it ends soon, a wheat crop
 much below average is likely.
 Wheat usually accounts for about
 half of Soviet grain production.
 At   present   the   situation
 does  not  appear       as   bad  as in
 1963, when the USSR bought 12 mil--
 lion tons of foreign wheat,   The
 Soviet minister ox agriculture
 has stated, however, that the
 USSR plans to import more wheat
 during the 1965-66 crop year than
 the 3.2 million tons it purchased
 during the preceding one.   The
 USSR has just purchased from
 France 300,000 tons of wheat,
 perhaps in anticipation of
 another poor crop this year.
 Prospects for crops other
 than grains appear to be about av-
 erage at this time.   Consequently,
 production of these crops in 1965
 is not expected to reach the record
 or near-record levels produced in
 1964.   Cotton, because of a reported
 shortage of irrigation water and a
 slightly reduced acreage, should be
 well below the record crops har-
 vested in 1963 and 1964.

 POLITICAL INSTABILITY IN POLAND
 According to rumors in War-
 saw, party first secretary
 Gomulka is seriously ill and
 the next party center committee
 plenum on 27 July will consider
 the question of a successor.
 While these rumors are apparent-
 ly without substance, they re-
 flect the dissatisfaction at
 all levels of society with the
 stagnation of Polish life which
 has resulted from Gomulka's
 stubbornly conservative policies.
 Ever since his return to
 power in October 1956, and es-
 pecially after the vicious fac-
 tional battles which wracked the
 party between 1956 and 1958,
 Gomulka has been convinced that
 the "Polish October" was too re-
 visionistic, too anti-Soviet,
 and too anti-Communist.  As a
 result, he reversed the trend
 toward "liberal" economic de-
 centralization, reinstalled
 hard-line party stalwarts in the
 apparatus and in the government,
 and strengthened the secret po-
 lice in support of the hard-
 liners who were trying to create
 "order. "
 In the economic sphere the
 tightening of control was said
 to be necessary to achieve rapid
 growth in heavy industry--a
 necessity for long-run increases
 in living standards.   In spite
 of fairly rapid economic growth
 since the late 1950s, however,
 consumption and wage levels have
 increased only slightly, causing
 widespread disillusionment over
 regime promises.
 Within the past year, the
 authority of the party central
 committee departments has been
 increased to the detriment of
 governmental efficiency.   Retire-
 ments or transfers to innocuous
 government jobs of liberals, Jews,
 and other suspect persons have
 been more numerous.  Often such
 people are replaced by nominees
 of the hard-liners.
 The secret police are again
 feared, although the mass terror
 of the early 1950s has not re-
 turned.   In addition, the regime
 has cautiously attempted, with
 varying success, to impose con-
 trols or restraints on the ac-
 tivities of certain groups.
 The cumulative effect of these
 measures has been to engender wide-
 spread apathy among the Polish
 people who see themselves worse off
 than ever while the lives of their
 East European neighbors are improv-
 ing.   Moreover, Gomulka's efforts
 to improve relations with the USSR
 reportedly are being criticized
 even by high party members.
 It is not clear what course
 Gomulka will pursue to cope with
 this instability. Because of re-
 ported serious party clashes over
 how to deal with the economic situa-
 tion, he probably will accept lim-
 ited economic reforms. However,
 given Moscow's continued support,
 the influence of the secret police,
 and the inertia of the central party
 apparatus, he will probably resist
 significant changes elsewhere.
 Under these circumstances
 the prospects are for continued
 stagnation in virtually all
 fields of activity in Poland.
 The resulting frustration may
 well lead to a coalition of the
 opposing factions in the regime
 which could pose the most serious
 challenge to Gomulka since his re-
 turn to power.

 NEW YEMENI GOVERNMENT
 The new Yemeni cabinet
 formed by Major General Amri is
 under Nasir's thumb, despite
 the inclusion of several members
 of former premier Numan's "third
 force" group.
 Formation of the Amri cab-
 inet followed three weeks of
 political crisis, inaugurated
 by the 1 July resignation of
 Premier Numan and complicated by
 President Sallal's attempt to
 take complete charge.   Sallal
 apparently appointed himself
 premier and announced a 15-man
 cabinet which included 13 mili-
 tary officers, but his immediate
 summons to Cairo suggested Na-
 sir's disapproval.
 Nasir's discussions with
 representatives of opposing
 Yemeni factions resulted in
 the announcement that Amri, a
 former premier and Sallal's
 chief lieutenant, was to form
 a government, which now in-
 cludes six army officers and 13
 civilians.  Nasir's selection
 of a Sallal supporter indicates
 his determination to keep Yemeni
 affairs firmly in pro-Egyptian
 hands.
 FIRMLY PRO-EGYPTIAN
 rorist operations against the
 British-protected Federation of
 South Arabia, which had lessened
 under Numan.
 The government's obvious sub-
 servience to Egyptian policy will
 probably cost it heavily in terms
 of vital tribal support.  Abdullah
 al-Ahmar, paramount sheikh of the
 most powerful tribal confedera-
 tion, has not been included in the
 cabinet, although he held the
 vital post of interior minister
 in Amri's previous government as
 well as in that of Numan.
 Several. anti-Egyptian sheikhs now
 in the republican camp are already
 making overtures to the royalists,
 who still retain the military ini-
 tiative.   The most important of
 these is the sheikh of the 10,000
 man tribe from which Prime Minis-
 ter Amri originates and from which
 the republican government has
 usually drawn strong support.
 Prospects for an agreement
 between Nasir and Saudi King
 Faysal are dim, and there are no
 indications at present that Nasir
 intends to reduce the number of
 Egyptian troops committed to
 the Yemen civil war--now ester
 The revival of the Ministry
 for the Affairs of the Occupied
 South, dropped by the Numan gov-
 ernment, suggests that the Egyp-
 tians intend to step up the ter-
 mated at 53,000 to 58,000.

 INDIA AND PAKISTAN AND THE KUTCH AFTERMATH
 Indian and Pakistani tem-
 pers have cooled since the Rann
 of Kutch crisis, but mutual sus-
 picion and vigilance remain high.
 A formal cease-fire has
 been in effect in the Rann since
 1 July.   The troops which were
 deployed there have withdrawn
 in accordance with the agreement
 worked out in London by the Brit-
 ish between Indian Prime Minis-
 ter Shastri and Pakistani Pres-
 ident Ayub.
 In the Punjab, withdrawals
 have been very slow, with each
 side keeping its guard up in
 the event of a need for swift
 redeployment of forces to the
 borders.   It seems likely that
 both sides of that border will
 remain more like armed camps
 than they were before.
 In Kashmir, the explosive
 situation around Kargil has been
 defused  somewhat, but India's
 reinforcement of its three-di-
 vision force along the 16-year-
 old cease-fire line and the con-
 tinued presence of Pakistani
 tribal irregulars brought in dur-
 ing the Kutch crisis are keeping
 tensions up.
 In the east, withdrawal
 understandings have been hon-
 ored more swiftly, but the size
 of the forces involved was never
 very large.   Nevertheless, the
 situation remains touchy in the
 Dahagram area where fighting--
 unrelated to the Kutch affair--
 broke out earlier this year.
 Indian eviction of Muslims in
 the Tripura area continues una-
 bated, despite Pakistani pro-
 tests.
 Politically, neither side
 seems to be taking very seriously
 ministerial-level meetings sched-
 uled for next month.   Neither
 expects the Rann of Kutch ques-
 tion to be resolved in bilateral
 negotiations.   Each is probably
 planning to use the meetings
 only to put its position on rec-
 ord  before the dispute goes to
 the arbitration proceedings to
 which both agreed in London.
 Other and more pressing
 foreign policy concerns may soon
 overshadow the hard lessons both
 sides learned from the confron-
 tation in the Rann of Kutch,
 but its effect on the power re-
 lationships in the subcontinent
 will be long felt.   Pakistan
 has proved it has better sol-
 diers, but India has many more
 of them.   For years each side
 has threatened major military
 action without facing this fact
 squarely.   Now the military con-
 frontation has passed, and
 cooler heads on both sides must
 realize that it may only have
 been London's intercession that
 avoided larger hostilities.
 While these lessons do not move
 the adversaries any closer to
 resolving their long-standing
 problems,  there is a good chance
 both sides will be less inclined
 to allow future controversy to
 reach such dangerous proportions.

 REBELS STEP UP ACTIVITY IN SOUTHERN SUDAN
 The rebels in the Sudan's
 Negroid southern provinces have
 begun a more aggressive campaign,
 last week attacking a security
 post in the provincial capital
 of Juba.
 The capabilities of the
 rebels have vastly increased ir,
 the past six months.   They have
 taken over large quantities of
 modern weapons destined for the
 Congolese insurgents and now
 control most of the south except
 for major garrison towns.   The
 rainy season,  just beginning,
 will further hamper army actions
 against the rebels.
 The government nevertheless
 has apparently discarded all ef-
 forts to negotiate with the
 separatist-minded southerners.
 Fearing, moreover,  that separa-
 tist sentiment may spread to
 other provinces, the government
 plans to strengthen the security
 forces in those bordering the
 south.
 The army also is still
 saddled with handling the Congo-
 lese rebel refugees in the border
 Berea--reportedly several thousand
 strong.   Their presence in the
 Sudan has encouraged Congolese
 Premier Tshombd to cooperate with
 the Sudanese insurgents, who in
 turn are said to be assisting
 Congolese Army reconnaissance and
 patrol missions along the border.
 In Khartoum, southern leaders
 quickly protested the brutal re-
 prisals taken against southern
 civilians after the clash in Juba
 last week, when perhaps as many
 as 1,000 southerners were slaugh-
 tered.   The reaction of the gov-
 ernment--which has consistently
 minimized casualty figures from
 the south--was to close Khartoum's
 southern-sponsored newspaper
 Vigilant,  and to institute spe-
 cial security measures to protect
 government installations in the
 Khartoum area against sabotage.
 The regime is still trying
 to recruit candidates for two
 empty cabinet posts reserved for
 the south, but almost all southern
 leaders of any stature refuse to
 join the government.   Meanwhile,
 a split within the Sudan African
 National Union--the main southern
 group--has led to the formation
 of still another southern po-
 litical faction which calls for
 the establishment of the inde-
 pendent state of "Azania."  Even
 if the Khartoum government should
 make some serious effort to find
 a political solution to the south-
 ern problem,  it is now nearly im-
 possible to discover which group
 really speaks for the majority of
 southerners.

 MAURITANIA MOVING TO THE LEFT
 Mauritania's recent recog-
 nition of Communist China and
 withdrawal from the moderate Afri-
 can and Malagasy Common Organiza-
 tion (OCAM) reflect its increas-
 ing alignment with the radical
 Arab and African states.
 Although Nationalist China
 had maintained a chargd in Mauri-
 tania since late 1960,  its first
 ambassador was appointed only
 after Peiping showed an interest
 in the country.   He was en route
 to his post when the decision to
 recognize the Communist regime
 was announced.   A Chinese Com-
 munist mission, headed by the
 ambassador to Tunisia, visited
 Nouakchott, Mauritania's capi-
 tal, from 16 to 20 July, depart-
 ing several hours after the ar-
 rival of Taipei's ambassador-
 designate.   Mauritania has in
 the past appeared to favor a
 "two Chinas" solution, but now
 appears to be trying to force
 the Nationalists to bow out.
 Earlier this month, Presi-
 dent Moktar announced Maur.i-' tania's withdrawal from OCAM, of
 which he was titular head.  Mok-
 tar was apparently dissatisfied
 with Ivory Coast President Hou-
 phouet-Boigny's manipulation of
 OCAM to give an aura of respecta-
 bility in African circles to the
 detested Moise Tshombd's regime
 in the Leopoldville Congo and
 to issue anti-Peiping and other
 antiradical pronouncements.  Mauri-
 tania is currently cultivating
 Cameroon, the OCAM country whose
 African policies are closest to
 its own.
 The new leftward orientation
 has accompanied Mauritania's grow-
 ing maturity as a nation.   Since
 independence, in.1960, Mauritania
 has developed its own national
 identity and overcome the handi-
 cap of Moroccan claims to its en-
 tire territory.  Moreover,   it has
 become one of the few new African
 states able to function without
 extensive foreign aid.
 By 1964, Moktar was able to
 begin giving a more distinctive
 character to his regime.   The in-
 ternal political structure was
 made over on the model of the radi-
 cal African states, notably Guinea,
 and steps were taken to erase an
 international reputation as a
 rather unimportant French protegd.
 In this connection, several Com-
 munist countries,  including the So-
 viet Union,  have been permitted
 to open embassies in Nouakchott
 since late 1964. Concurrently,
 progressive pro-Arab elements in-
 creased their influence within the
 regime at the expense of the tra-
 ditional tribal leaders and the
 conservative Negro minority.

 POLITICAL SHOWDOWN IN LEOPOLDVILLE CONGO MAY BE NEAR
 Actions and statements this
 past week by the Leopoldville
 Congo's President Kasavubu
 clearly indicate that he is out
 to cut Premier Tshombd down to
 size, if not to force him to re-
 sign. Moreover, Kasavubu appar-
 ently has no present intention
 of trying to work out a private
 agreement with the premier on
 sharing the presidential powers.
 Kasavubu's seemingly unrelenting
 offensive against Tshombd sug-
 gests a showdown may be in the
 offing, although for the moment
 Tshombd is quietly absorbing
 these political reverses.
 Following his abrupt dis-
 missal earlier this month of
 Tshombd's henchman, minister of
 interior Munongo, Kasavubu gave
 Tshombd another slap by appoint-
 ing an anti-Tshombist replace-
 ment, Victor Nendaka, without
 first consulting the premier as
 required by the constitution.
 Earlier this week Kasavubu
 publicly attacked Tshombd's
 political party, CONACO, as a
 "Katangan" party.   He adamantly
 insisted that he would not agree
 to any changes in the constitu-
 tion to meet the desires of the
 prime minister.   The President
 also demanded that a new gov-
 ernment of "national unity,"
 not dominated by CONACO, be
 formed prior to the as yet un-
 scheduled opening of parliament.
 Tshombd has been insist-
 ing that constitutionally his
 government should remain in power
 until presidential elections, six
 months after parliament first
 meets.   The establishment of a
 new government, as opposed to a
 reshuffled one, reopens the issue
 of Tshombd's parliamentary im-
 munity, since a minister in the
 new government cannot retain his
 parliamentary seat.   Tshombd is
 clearly worried that his enemies
 might arrest him if he loses his
 immunity.
 Tshombd's possible responses
 to Kasavubu's actions are limited.
 He can decide to try to oust
 Kasavubu by force.  This, how-
 ever, would be a dangerous move
 and seems unlikely.  Only two le-
 gal courses appear open to him:
 to hang on and bide his time, or
 resign.   If he stays, he will
 probably have to swallow the in-
 clusion of some of Kasavubu's sup-
 porters in the new government.
 This, however, would appear pref-
 erable to resigning, which would
 cost him the prestige and patron-
 age of the government in any sub-
 sequent contest for the presi-
 dency.
 The central issue between
 the two men could be resolved
 if Tshombd should agree to sup-
 port Kasavubu's re-election.
 He is unlikely to make this de-
 cision, however, without firm
 guarantees from Kasavubu on
 his powers and tenure as pre-
 mier.

 Last week's sabotage and ter-
 rorist activity in Brazzaville--
 apparently staged by supporters of
 conservative ex-President Youlou--
 may help leftist extremists in-
 crease their already strong influ-
 ence in the government.  The regime
 appears in no danger of being over-
 thrown, but its frantic efforts to
 combat real and imagined opposition
 activity could result in a. general
 breakdown of order.
 Emergency defense measures
 were imposed on 15 July following
 unsuccessful attempts to blow up a,
 power line and to assassinate two
 government ministers, reportedly
 made by some 35 to 45 of Youlou's
 Leopoldville-based tribal follow-
 ers.   Elements of Brazzaville's
 tiny and undisciplined army, equipped
 with Soviet  weapons, have  be-
 gun patrolling the tense capital
 city and the Congo River waters
 which separate it from Leopold-
 ville.   In addition, members of
 the heavily armed and unpredict-
 able youth wing of Brazzaville's
 single political party have set up
 barricades throughout Brazzaville
 and are said to have orders to fire
 on anyone refusing to stop.   They
 reportedly have already stormed a
 prison and killed an army sergeant
 suspected of "counterrevolutionary"
 activity.
 Foreign Minister Ganao on 16
 July told the US ambassador his
 country faced a "full-blown coun-
 terrevolution" mounted by Youlou's
 Lari tribe.   Ganao claimed his
 government had captured seven of
 the saboteurs who he said had been
 furnished with plastic explosives,
 US grenades, and Belgian pistols,
 presumably by elements of the Leo-
 poldville regime.   Besides worsen-
 ing Brazzaville's already bad re-
 lations with Leopoldville, these
 incidents could revive charges of
 US subversion against Brazzaville.
 The party newspaper on 19 July
 charged that the grenades used by
 the terrorists were "made in USA."
 Brazzaville's interior min-
 ister has reportedly said that
 the "counterrevolutionaries" in-
 clude some Lari tribesmen in the
 army and other security forces.
 Extremists, anxious to bring the
 military under the single party's
 domination, had earlier demanded
 a. purge of the army.   A "people's
 court" last month allegedly un-
 covered antiregime plotting by
 some senior officers, and several
 military personnel were arrested.
 The regime postponed action against
 the military, however, and has at-
 tempted to maintain an air of
 stability during the 18-25 July
 All-African Games, for which ath-
 letes and dignitaries from some
 27 African countries are assembled
 in Brazzaville.
 The period from now until the
 mid-August second anniversary cele-
 brations of Youlou's ouster will
 be a particularly tense one, dur-
 ing which a purge of the army and
 possibly some of the remaining
 moderates in the cabinet may be
 attempted.   Although key military
 leaders still seem committed to
 the regime, overzealous action by
 the extremists could bring on
 clashes between the youth organi-
 zation and the regular securit           25X1
 forces.

 THE GREEK POLITICAL--CRISIS
 The ouster of Premier Papan-
 dreou by King Constantine late
 last week brought the long-de-
 veloping government crisis in
 Greece to a head.
 In an attempt to resolve
 the dispute over control of the
 Ministry of Defense, the King
 offered to give Papandreou the
 portfolio temporarily and later
 appoint a new minister.   Papan-
 dreou refused, and the intended
 announcement of his resignation
 was preceded by the King's de-
 cision to replace him with George
 Athanasiadis-Novas, the former
 president of parliament.
 Athanasiadis-Novas has
 formed a 20-man cabinet from
 among members of the Center Un-
 ion (EK) party, but the support
 of the majority of EK parliamen-
 tary deputies was uncertain at
 last report.   Some members of
 the cabinet reportedly joined
 the new government reluctantly.
 However, Coordination Minister
 Mitsotakis, also a key member of
 Papandreou's administration, has
 stated that new tactics have been
 instituted which could enlist
 majority EK support.   A vote of
 confidence must be held when par-
 liament meets around the end of
 July.
 Papandreou has attacked the
 King's action as unconstitutional.
 His confidence in his personal
 mandate has been strengthened by
 the intensity of the popular dem-
 onstrations in his behalf during
 the past week.   He reportedly has
 refused to approve any compromise
 government, such as one proposed
 .under former deputy premier
 jStephanopoulos, and in which Papan-
 dreou would theoretically retain
 the leadership of the EK.
 There is convincing evi-
 dence that Papandreou's son An-
 dreas has sought the active sup-
 port of the Communist-front
 United  Democratic, Left (EDA) for
 his father's cause, and EDA has
 been prominent in the demonstra-
 tions.                                                               Additional demonstrations
 by left-wing groups have been
 scheduled, but the government is
 determined to use any means neces-
 sary to maintain order.
 In the event of a showdown
 with the Papandreou forces, the
 army and the security forces are
 likely to remain loyal to a gov-
 ernment which has the King's
 blessing.   If the crisis should
 lead to eventual elections in
 which the King's interference in
 politics is a prime issue,  inter-
 vention by the military cannot
 be precluded.
 On Cyprus, Greek Cypriot
 leaders fear that Papandreou's
 ouster will strengthen the Turk-
 ish Cypriot position and bring
 Greek pressure for a compromise
 solution favoring Turkey.   While
 the island is calm, pro-Papandreou
 demonstrations are possible.

 EEC COUNCIL TO MEET DESPITE FRENCH BOYCOTT
 The EEC Council of Minis-
 ters, under Italian chairman-
 ship_, is.expected, to meet on 26
 July despite general recognition
 that little can be accomplished
 without French participation.
 The EEC.Commission may use the
 occasion to table its revised
 proposal on.agricultural financ-
 ing which, by postpoining deci-
 sions on the "political" aspects
 of its original proposal, is con-
 ciliatory toward the French.
 The Commission evidently hopes
 the new draft will persuade
 Paris to reconsider its boycott
 policy or  failing that, further
 its isolation.
 There is still no evidence
 of French willingness to receive
 proposals emanating from the Com-
 mission, nor, for the moment at
 least, is there any great dispo-
 sition among the other five to
 remove the discussions to a bi-
 lateral setting.
 Foreign Min-
 ister Fanfani believes the five
 should be ready to seek a com-
 promise on the financial regu-
 lation, but must meet with "firm-
 ness" De Gaulle's attempt to
 downgrade the importance of the
 Council and the Commission.   Dur-
 ing EEC President Hallstein's
 visit to West Germany last week,
 Erhard apparently reaffirmed
 Bonn's intention to work for a
 solution through community ma-
 chinery.
 It is doubtful how long the
 EEC will be able to continue to
 participate effectively in the Ken-
 nedy Round tariff negotiations un-
 der the present circumstances. EEC
 Commissioner Rey has told the US
 ambassador to the community that
 the tariff negotiations should not
 be affected "seriously" until the
 end of the year.   He noted that
 the 16 September date for tabling
 offers on agricultural products
 could be met for some products
 without new Council decisions and
 that no Council action would be
 required this year on the indus-
 trial side.
 Contrary to Rey's optimistic
 assessment, however, the Bonn of-
 ficial in charge of economic af-
 fairs at the Foreign Ministry has
 stated it is "absolutely clear"
 the 16 September date cannot be
 met.   He added that Bonn was very
 concerned lest a prolonged EEC
 crisis make it impossible to com-
 plete the Kennedy Round negotia-
 tions before the expiration in
 1967 of the US negotiating mandate
 under the Trade Expansion Act.

 DOMINICAN POLITICAL PROBLEMS STILL UNRESOLVED
 Political negotiations con-
 tinue to dominate the still-
 confused Dominican scene.   The
 unwillingness of either side to

 basic principles is impeding a

 Read Barreras now appears will-
 ing to serve as interim vice
 president and seems acceptable
 to both the rebel "constitu-
 tionalist" government of Colonel
 Francisco Caamano and the loy-
 alist Government of National
 Reconstruction (GNR) of General
 Antonio Imbert.
 However, numerous problems
 remain to be solved before the
 provisional government is in-
 stalled.                             One of these is the
 future control of subversives.
 The Imbert regime supports large-
 scale deportations, while the
 rebels swing to the other ex-
 treme and propose adopting rel-
 evant portions of the 1963 con-
 stitution which would make con-
 trol of subversives extremely
 difficult.   Garcia Godoy is op-
 posed to deportations, and ex-
 President Joaquin Balaguer has
 publicly announced that he be-
 lieves all elements of the pop-
 ulation--including Communists--
 should be permitted free par-
 ticipation in political life,
 including elections.   Balaguer's
 stand is obviously a political
 ploy,.predicated on his belief
 that he will win the next pres-
 idential election and that the
 votes he receives from leftists
 will enhance his stature as a
 president elected by a wide
 range of opinion.
 The future of the military
 establishment and its relation-
 ship to the civilian government
 is one of the thorniest issues.
 The rebels insist that their of-
 ficers be reincorporated into
 the military,  while Imbert's
 followers are equally adamant
 that none of what they like to
 call the "Communist hordes" may
 re-enter the armed forces.   The
 GNR has offered a compromise by
 which high rebel officers would
 maintain their ranks but be re-
 quired to serve outside the coun-
 try for five years, while lesser
 officers and enlisted men could
 be readmitted and allowed to
 serve within the country.
 The role of the Inter-Ameri-
 can Peace Force  (IAPF) is also at
 issue,   Both Dominican factions
 demand that it leave one month
 after establishment of the pro-
 visional government, but the OAS
 committee has suggested that the
 IAPF stay at the pleasure of the
 provisional government,  implying
 that this stay would continue at
 least until the inauguration of
 the elected government.
 Both the rebels and the loy-
 alists are taking advantage of"the
 political stalemate to further
 their own position.   The loyalists
 continue to denounce the rebels,
 with swipes at the US and the OAS
 and to exhort people to leave the
 rebel zone "while there is still
 time."  They back up their veiled
 threats with sporadic firing into
 the rebel zone, such as the brief
 mortar attack on the rebel sec-
 tor of Santo Domingo on 20 July.
 The rebels take the propa-
 ganda offensive by giving wide
 publicity to the Inter-America-n
 Human Rights Commission's report
 of atrocities committed in the
 area controlled by the Imbert
 government.   Extremists in the
 rebel camp evidently still plan
 to continue the rebellion after

 what they expect will be a sell-
 out by the Caamano government.
 The interior of the coun-
 try is calm although the con-
 tinuing strike at the large
 sugar mill at La Romana is keep-
 ing 18,000 persons out of work.
 The continuation of the strike
 will cause serious economic hard-
 ships in the eastern section of
 the country.
 UNEASY CALM IN ECUADOR
 Ecuador's military junta
 has restored order following tur-
 bulence which began on 8 July.
 The curfew has been lifted in
 rebellious Guayaquil and eco-
 nomic life has returned to nor-
 mal, but martial law continues
 in effect and the students re-
 main extremely restive.   Al-
 though both factions of the Com-
 munist Party belatedly decided
 to encourage new street out-
 breaks on 19 July none mate-
 rialized.
 On the political front, the
 cabinet resigned to give the
 junta full freedom of action to
 fashion a new administration,
 possibly with a broader politi-
 cal base.   The politicians, who
 originally provoked the disturb-
 ances to speed the shift to
 constitutional rule, have be-
 gun to confer with the govern-
 ment on possible modification
 of its plan for the transition.
 To their original conditions--
 an interim civilian president
 and a constituent assembly--
 they now have added release of
 political prisoners and reopen-
 ing of closed newspapers.   The
 junta is determined to deny op-
 portunistic politicians the
 chance to negate its reforms in
 tax structure and collection
 methods, university administra-
 tion, and the key agrarian re-
 form program which has benefited
 thousands of Indians, but it is
 seeking a political understand-
 ing.
 Former president Galo Plaza,
 informal adviser to the govern-
 ment for some time, told the junta
 that if it clings to power by
 sheer force--as it has done for
 the past two weeks--it will lose
 so much popularity that a suc-
 cessor regime will be impelled
 to repudiate all of the reforms.
 Plaza, who had been suggested as
 interim president, told the junta
 that no "competent leader" would
 assume the post, and urged ac-
 commodation with the three tradi-
 tional parties--Radical Liberal,
 Conservative, and Socialist.
 Gradual efforts by the junta
 to remove the causes of recent
 tension appear likely to gain
 time for it to achieve a grace-
 ful, if accelerated, departure
 from power.

 COLOMBIAN PRESIDENT REQUESTS SPECIAL POWERS
 On the evening of 20 July,
 President Valencia formally con-
 voked the regular session of the
 Colombian Congress with a plea
 for many economic reforms, in-
 cluding those which had not been
 enacted by the 12-week special
 session that ended on 16 July.
 In his address, he asked for
 special powers to reorganize
 the administrative structure of
 the government by eliminating
 some present institutions, trans-
 ferring their functions to other
 departments, and readjusting
 the budget to take account of
 the changes.
 Valencia's purpose is to
 reduce the annual cost of gov-
 ernment business.   He proposed
 a method of reducing the service
 costs on Colombia's foreign debt
 and a new way of financing the
 domestic public debt.   He also
 asked for powers to levy new in-
 come taxes and to regulate cur-
 rency exchange, foreign invest-
 ments, and interest payments.
 He requested power to create a
 National Economic Council to
 plan further domestic and for-
 eign trade regulations.   In ad-
 dition, he advanced a plan to
 encourage construction of low-
 cost housing and another to
 solve the near-critical problem
 of unemployment.
 Although the advisers from
 several international financial
 institutions have urged for
 more than two years that the
 Colombian peso be devaluated,
 Valencia remains adamantly op-
 posed to such action.   He is
 convinced that devaluation would
 result in "political chaos."
 Valencia prefers to imple-
 ment his program through the
 use of special powers rather
 than undergo the arduous process
 of shepherding it through a re-
 calcitrant congress.   Congress
 is unlikely to grant such spe-
 cial powers,  however, and the
 President may resort to issuing
 decrees, which he is empowered
 to do under the present state
 of siege.   Such decrees would
 have to be ratified by congress
 after the state of siege is
 terminated, and thus Valencia
 may find that he has only post-
 poned his day of battle.
 Since his appointment on
 14 July, Minister of Finance
 Joaquin Vallejo has made a
 series of public addresses in
 support of Valencia's conserva-
 tive approach.   He has consist-
 ently stressed the need for
 popular support and the restora-
 tion of public confidence, and
 he has blamed the Congress en-
 tirely for the lack of progress
 thus far.   He has already gained
 the reputation of a "man of ac-
 tion," and may rouse the gen-
 erally cynical public to some
 active support at last.   Rous-
 ing the public to expect action
 may be dangerous, however, if
 in the longer term no action is
 forthcoming.

 PROSPECTS FOR EIGHTEEN-NATION DISARMAMENT COMMITTEE MEETING
 A treaty to curb prolifera-
 tion of nuclear weapons is likely
 to be the main focus of discussion
 when the Eighteen-Nation Disarma-
 ment Committee (ENDC) reconvenes in
 Geneva next week.   Prospects for
 agreement are poor, however, de-
 spite the high priority many ENDC
 members attach to this question.
 The USSR has consistently taken
 the line that an agreement is pos-
 sible only if the West abandons
 the planned NATO multilateral force
 (MLF), and there are sharp differ-
 ences even in the Western camp.
 The British are eager to in-
 troduce a draft treaty on nonpro-
 liferation.   Their proposal, based
 on the Irish resolution submitted
 to the General Assembly in 1961,
 calls on nuclear states not to
 transfer control of nuclear weapons
 to any nonnuclear state or to any
 association of states.   Nonnuclear
 powers would agree not to iuanufac-
 ture, acquire control of, or par-
 ticipate in any association having
 control of such weapons.   This pro-
 posal has important implications
 for development of a NATO nuclear
 force--which Moscow contends would
 amount to further dissemination.
 As the British interpret their plan,
 it would still allow a force in
 which one or more of the nuclear
 members retained a veto, as envis-
 aged in the British-backed proposal
 for an Allied Nuclear Force (ANF).
 However, the eventual transfer of
 control to a European union--as the
 so-called "European clause" in the
 MLF proposal envisages--might be
 difficult to justify under a non-
 proliferation accord.
 It is uncertain whether any
 new proposals on nonacquisition can
 be reconciled with Bonn.'s views. For-
 eign Minister Schroeder, in a re-
 cent press statement, seems to imply
 that Germany's nuclear needs must be
 met by participation in a multilat-
 eral force before it would agree
 with its allies not to acquire its
 own nuclear weapons.   He added that
 German accession to a world-wide non-
 dissemination agreement would be pos-
 sible only if the USSR would take
 steps toward German reunification.
 Other matters the Geneva forum
 is likely to inherit from the United
 Nations Disarmament Commission
 (UNDC) discussions earlier this year
 are:   extension of the limited test
 ban treaty to include underground
 tests; reduction of military budgets,
 with savings to be used for economic
 development; and the Soviet and US
 resolutions which were not brought
 to a vote in the UNDC.
 The Soviet press has not yet
 informed its readers that the ENDC
 talks are to resume.   The US Embassy
 in Moscow was informed on 21 July
 that Tsarapkin, chief Soviet rep-
 resentative at the last session,
 would head the Soviet delegation
 again.   A few days earlier, a TASS
 correspondent in Geneva commented
 to a US official that if the So-
 viets "simply wished to condemn
 the US for its actions in Vietnam,"
 Tsarapkin was "capable of that."
 He added that if the Soviets were
 interested in disarmament progress,
 First Deputy Foreign Minister Kuz-
 netsov would probably head the
 delegation.
