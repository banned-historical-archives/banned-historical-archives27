 Recognition of the dangers which could have arisen
 had the  Arabs or Israelis had nuclear weapons has
 added impetus to the effort to get a nonproliferation
 treaty (NPT), and the recent US-Soviet summit has
 raised hopes.  Moscow is expected to agree soon to

 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST CRISIS
 Attention remains focused on the continuing UN ef-

 Communist states, despite their public harangues
 against Israel, appear to be taking a more realistic
 view of the situation in their private statements.
 The Arabs, however, still insist they will not nego-

 opened, and the Arab ban on oil shipments to the
 UK and US has not been lifted.

 FAR EAST
 There were further signs this week that the Ky-
 Thieu rivalry in South Vietnam's presidential race
 is causing unrest and concern among senior military
 officers.  Military action during the week was con-
 fined mainly to Communist mortar attacks on US in-
 stallations.  Meanwhile, there are reports from North
 Vietnam that Ho Chi Minh, who has not appeared in
 public for three months, is ill.
 The outbreak of violent demonstrations against
 ethnic Chinese in Rangoon may foreshadow a signif-
 icant turning point in Sino-Burmese relations, which
 have been relatively uneventful since the border
 agreement of 1960.  These incidents pose a serious
 test for the Ne Win regime's traditional neutralist
 policy of avoiding trouble with China.  Although the
 Burmese Government probably gave at least tacit en-
 couragement to the demonstrators, it apparently was
 surprised by the extent of the violence against the
 Chinese population and was forced to impose martial
 law to bring the rioting under control.  Peking has
 lodged a strong protest, charging that the Burmese
 Government instigated an attack on the Chinese Em-
 bassy.
 Within China, the Peking leadership apparently
 remains reluctant to inject the army into the po-
 litical turmoil despite the formal central committee
 directive in early June ordering the military to
 restore order.  The Liberation Army Journal has
 warned the army against intervening in'- factional
 disputes between pro-Maoist groups.  The Red Guards
 are continuing their attacks on high government and
 military officials.  Although it is impossible to
 measure the economic costs of political chaos, evi-
 dence continues to mount on cutbacks in industrial
 production and closures of factories.

 VIETNAM
 Communist troops have in-
 flicted heavy casualties on US
 forces in South Vietnam's central
 highlands in recent days and con-
 tinue to maneuver in the area of
 the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) and
 adjacent Quang Tri Province.
 In the highlands of Kontum
 Province near Dak To, US troops
 of Operation GREELEY continued
 to press their major spoiling
 campaign following a heavy en-
 gagement with Communist troops on
 22 and 23 June.  This battle, in
 which a US company-size patrol
 was surrounded by a battalion-
 size force, res-ulted in Ameri-
 can casualties of 80 killed and
 34 wounded.  The Communists lost
 at least 106 killed. Captured
 enemy documents indicate that
 Communist forces in this area may
 be attempting to divert allied
 forces from the more strategic
 area of western Pleiku Province
 where enemy offensive military
 action has also increased.  In
 this highlands area, the Commu-
 nists remain capable of mounting
 a coordinated, large-scale cam-
 paign, and as the rainy season
 sets in the long-heralded summer
 offensive may still be launched.
 Communist forces have kept
 up their attacks against allied
 positions in northernmost Quang
 Tri Province, indicating that
 they are rebuilding and reoccupy-
 ing positions destroyed by al-
 lied operations last month.  The
 attacks may also be in prepara-
 tion for a resumption of offensive
 operations farther south.  In ad-
 dition to the now almost regular
 shelling of US installations in
 the northeastern part of the prov-
 ince, including the heavy artillery
 position at Gio Linh, five US Ma-
 rine field positions near Khe Sanh
 in western Quang Tri were struck
 by heavy mortar fire early on 27
 June.
 South Vietnamese Politics
 On the eve of the 30 June
 deadline for filing candidacies
 for South Vietnam's presidential
 election, all four of the lead-
 ing contenders--Premier Ky,
 Chief of State Thieu, and civil-
 ians Tran Van Huong and Phan
 Khac Suu--intend to run.  All
 have selected southern civilians
 as their vice-presidential run-
 ning mates.
 The presence of four strong
 candidates, however, will con-
 tinue to offer a strong induce-
 ment for arranging private deals.
 An alliance between any two of the
 four probably would significantly

 improve the chances of the
 beneficiary.   In the two months
 before the election, Thieu, Huong,
 and Suu still might take some pro-
 test action, such as mutually with-
 drawing from the race, if they
 agree that Ky's election tactics
 are sufficiently unfair and their
 own chances are sufficiently dark.
 Ky has taken a number of
 steps to tone down his campaign
 in reaction to the groundswell
 of criticism from both the
 foreign press and domestic po-
 litical circles.  He made some
 points by announcing the gov-
 ernment's intent to provide equal
 campaign facilities to all candi-
 dates--actually a requirement of
 the electoral regulations.  More
 significantly, he has stripped
 Police Director Loan of one of
 his security posts while at the
 same time relaxing government
 pressure on Saigon's newspapers.
 Reaction to press censorship
 had reached such proportions that
 the joint military-civilian advisory
 co-uncil and the Provisional National
 Assembly both attacked it and for-
 eign correspondents refused to ask
 Ky questions at a recent press con-
 ference.  Despite Ky's sudden aware-
 ness of the increasing ill will
 over his campaign methods, it re-
 mains to be seen whether his ac-
 tions will result in an actual re-
 laxation of government pressure on
 his behalf.
 North Vietnam's SAMs
 Evidence of dissatisfaction
 with some aspects of Soviet air
 defense equipment was set forth
 in an article in the June issue
 of the army journal by the North
 Vietnamese Chief of Staff.  Al-
 though essentially a propaganda
 document designed to bolster
 morale and confidence among the
 rank-and-file of air defense
 units, the article stressed the
 importance and effectiveness
 of antiaircraft artillery
 and other equipment less sophisti-
 cated than the Soviet-supplied
 missiles and jet aircraft.  The
 article made extravagant claims
 for Vietnamese contributions to
 Communist doctrines of "peoples
 wars" and appears to reflect
 Hanoi's obsession with demon-
 strating its independence from
 foreign domination in the face
 of massive inputs of assistance.
 The Vietnamese recently publicly
 disparaged certain Chinese polit-
 ical practices in a similar vein.

 PEKING CAUTIOUS ON INVOLVING ARMY IN POLITICAL TURMOIL
 Violent clashes disrupting
 industrial production and rail
 transport continue to be reported
 from many areas of China.  Early
 in June the central committee is-
 sued a directive ordering the army
 to take stern measures to stop
 the disorder, but later pronounce-
 ments indicate that Peking remains
 extremely reluctant to involve
 the army in the political turmoil.
 On 27 June an editorial in
 the Liberation Army Journal told
 the army that when factional dis-
 putes between various pro-Maoist
 groups take place it "must not
 support either side and must not
 attack either side."  Last week
 Red Flag had said that most par-
 ticipants in current conflicts
 are basically pro-Maoist.  The
 27 June army editorial stated
 that all too often when the army
 had tried to intervene it had
 backed the wrong group by mistake.
 This unwillingness to give
 clearcut signals to the army is a
 good measure of the confusion
 which pervades the leadership in
 Peking.  Other signs are the con-
 tinuing propaganda attacks by
 powerful Red Guard organizations
 on high officials who nevertheless
 continue to perform their jobs.
 These include Foreign Minister
 Chen Yi, Finance Minister Li Hsien-
 nien, top military officials Yeh
 Chien-ying and Hsiao Hua, and
 Wang En-mao, the controversial
 commander of the western frontier
 region Sinkiang.
 Chen Yi continues to make
 occasional foreign policy state-
 ments and on 24 June appeared
 with Mao Tse-tung and Lin Piao
 at a reception for visiting Zambian
 officials.  Nevertheless he has
 drawn heavy Red Guard fire con-
 tinuously for three months.  A
 foreign diplomat has reported
 that the Foreign Office official
 assigned to escort a recent diplo-
 matic tour outside Peking spent
 much of his time exulting in the
 fact that Chen Yi's influence had
 waned.
 Li Hsien-nien, Yeh Chien-ying,
 and Hsiao Hua have not been so
 heavily criticized, but their po-
 sitions too may be insecure.  Ac-
 cording to a poster report, Hsiao
 Hua, a key member of the Military
 Affairs Committee and head of
 the army's political apparatus,
 was personally censured by Lin
 Piao in May.

 ANTI-CHINESE RIOTS IN BURMA
 Relations between Communist
 China and Burma have fallen to
 their lowest point as a result
 of the anti-Chinese mob violence
 in Rangoon over the past week.
 The unprecedented demonstrations
 at both countries' embassies and
 against ethnic Chinese in Rangoon
 may foreshadow a significant turn-
 ing point in Sino-Burmese rela-
 tions, which have remained correct
 if uneventful in recent years.
 These incidents pose a
 serious test for the Ne Win re-
 gime's traditional neutralist
 policy, a feature of which has
 been the avoidance of difficulty
 with Communist China.  Although
 the Burmese Government was appa-
 rently surprised at the extent
 of the violence against the Chi-
 nese population, it probably gave
 tacit encouragement to the demon-
 strators in the earl  sta es of
 the disturbances.
 Burma's government-controlled
 press last week had played up
 a demonstration by Chinese stu-
 dents protesting a ban on wearing
 Mao Tse-tung lapel buttons.  It
 was these protest rallies at
 state-run schools in Rangoon
 which apparently touched off the
 large-scale disturbances.  Chinese
 Embassy officials, several of
 whom have recently returned from
 reindoctrination courses in China,
 were reportedly handing out the
 Mao buttons and encouraging the
 Chinese student demonstrators.
 It is doubtful, however, that
 Chinese diplomats had any inten-
 tion of provoking a major crisis.
 As violence spread and sev-
 eral dozen Chinese residents were
 killed, Burmese security forces
 began to take more decisive ac-
 tion.  In defiance of a hastily
 imposed ban on demonstrations,
 a mob of several thousand stormed
 the Chinese Embassy compound on 28
 June.  One Chinese technician
 was killed, and eyewitnesses claim
 several Burmese were shot.  The
 regime imposed martial law that
 night in troubled areas.
 Although the Ne Win govern-
 ment probably hopes to avoid a
 serious crisis in its relations
 with China, Peking clearly in-
 tends to hold the Burmese author-
 ities responsible for the riots.
 A Chinese Foreign Ministry note
 of 28 June charged that the Bur-
 mese Government "instigated" mob
 action and demanded that Rangoon
 ensure the safety of Chinese na-
 tionals and diplomats.  Almost
 immediately the Chinese stepped
 up diplomatic pressure on the
 Burmese by a massive demonstra-
 tion before the Burmese Embassy

 NORTH KOREANS EXPANDING AGENT ACTIVITY
 North Korea is stepping up
 the infiltration of armed agent
 teams into South Korea and is
 showing increasing aggressiveness
 in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ).
 Several recent incidents in-
 dicate that perhaps as many as
 60 men in nine teams are operating
 in remote eastern and southern
 areas of the country.
 Some 10., 000 South  Korean
 military and civilian security
 forces are trying to track down
 and destroy the teams.  Since the
 first of June, twelve agents have
 been killed and one captured at
 the cost to the government of
 13 killed and 21 injured.
 In addition, Pyongyang has
 sharply stepped up armed recon-
 naissance and probing activities
 in the DMZ area.  Over 200 inci-
 dents involving United Nations
 Command troops and North Korean
 personnel have occurred so far
 this year, compared with 44 in
 all of 1966, 55 in 1965, and 32
 in 1964.  The North Koreans have
 lost about 47 killed in this
 year's incidents, the South Ko-
 reans eight, and the US three.
 There has been nothing in
 either statements by North Korean
 leaders or Pyongyang's propaganda
 suggesting any intent to open a
 "second front" to divert attention
 from the Vietnam war.  It is
 possible, however, that one of
 Pyongyang's aims may be to dis-
 courage further deployment of South
 Korean troops to Vietnam, as well
 as to demonstrate general support
 for Hanoi.  The still largely
 hostile attitude of the South
 Korean people toward the North
 Korean Communists militates against
 any early success of a new Commu-
 nist  uerrilla effort.

 EUROPE
 Premier Kosygin's trip to Cuba, following his
 stay in the US, was made at Soviet initiative.  It
 had both protocol and substantive purposes, the
 latter doubtless concerned largely with a discus-
 sion of Cuba's militancy in Latin .America over
 which Moscow and Havana continue to differ.  Kosygin
 was also scheduled to make a courtesy call on Presi-
 dent de Gaulle en route back to Moscow.
 There was new hope in Geneva for progress on
 a nonproliferation treaty following the Johnson-
 Kosygin and Rusk-Gromyko talks.  Anew US-USSR
 draft may soon be submitted to the Disarmament
 Committee but the safeguards issue and the provi-
 sions for amending the treaty have not yet been
 resolved to the satisfaction of a number of key
 countries, Germany in particular.
 Western Europe has so far been unable to
 agree on how to deal with a potential ail emer-
 gency.  France, with large stocks in hand and
 with shipments again moving from Iraq, sees no
 need for concerted action.  Germany is couermit
 on Libya, its major source of supply, to p
 a resumption of shipments.  The Oil Committee of
 the 21-nation Organization for Economic Develop-
 ment is to meet again on 30 June to consider
 further whether the conditions of an oil emergency
 exist and how to cope with it.

 NONPROLIFERATION TREATY NEGOTIATTONS CONTINUE AT GENEVA
 Moscow is expected to agree
 soon to the tabling at the Eight-
 een Nation Disarmament Committee
 meeting in Geneva of a revised
 draft nonproliferation treaty
 (NPT) worked out by the US and
 Soviet delegations.  Recognition
 of the dangers which could have
 arisen had the Arabs or Israelis
 possessed nuclear weapons has
 added impetus to the effort to
 get a treaty.  In addition, the
 Johnson-Kosygin and Rusk-Gromyko
 talks on the subject have raised
 hopes at Geneva.
 The revised draft leaves
 blank the controversial Article
 III on safeguards.  For Article
 IV, which sets forth the means
 of amending the treaty, two pro-
 posals have been referred to Mos-
 cow.  The first would allow amend-
 ment by a majority of the signa-
 tory states; any such amendment
 would not be binding on a state
 which declined to accept it, and
 any of the nuclear states could
 veto it outright.. The second
 proposal would make binding on all
 signatory states any change ac-
 cepted by a majority but would
 give veto rights to all 30 nations
 on the Board of Governors of the
 International Atomic Energy Au-
 thority (IAEA) at the time of the
 vote.  Only the nuclear states
 have permanent seats on the board.'
 When the NATO foreign minis-
 ters at their 14 June meeting
 approved tabling the revised NPT
 draft of Geneva, West Germany's
 Brandt initially demurred, and
 Bonn still has doubts about sev-
 eral aspects of the treaty.  In
 a demarche delivered last week
 Page  10
 the Germans insisted the US stick
 to the essence of the Article III
 safeguards clause previously
 agreed to by the NATO allies and
 cautioned against accepting, even
 for negotiating purposes, any
 Soviet proposal without full con-
 sultation with the allies.  The
 German note also reiterated oppo-
 sition to the second alternative
 amendment clause for Article IV
 and stated that even the first is
 unsatisfactory because it gives
 a veto only to the nuclear powers.
 The safeguards issue still
 focuses on the roles of EURATOM
 and the IAEA, and two compromise
 proposals have been raised.  One
 would have Article III refer
 neither to verification of EURATOM
 safeguards by IAEA nor to any
 specific transition period in
 which safeguard arrangements would
 be worked out between the two
 agencies, but the EURATOM coun-
 tries would withhold final ratifi-
 cation until there is a IAEA-
 EURATOM agreement.  IAEA officials
 and the Soviets are very cool to
 thl5.
 The other proposal would
 have each nonnuclear party to
 the NPT undertake to conclude
 within three years' time "bilat-
 eral or multilateral" agreements
 with IAEA.  The term "multilateral
 could apply only to EURATOM, but
 the omission of any specific ref-
 erence to EURATOM might make this
 resolution acceptable to all con-
 cerned.  EURATOM officials, how-
 ever, are objecting to the three-
 year time limit on grounds that
 it would give all the bar ainin
 power to the IAEA.

 SOVIET SUBMARINE SUPPORT OPERATION OFF WEST AFRICA
 A group of Soviet ships
 operating south of the Cape Verde
 Islands since April may be testing
 the feasibility of a floating
 support force for submarines to
 extend their time at sea.  The
 group has included at least one
 nuclear and two diesel submarines,
 a submarine tender, a missile sup-
 port ship, a hydrographic ship,
 and at least one tanker.
 The surface ships have
 operated south of the Cape Verde
 Islands, but the operating areas
 of the submarines are not known.
 The nuclear-powered, E-class
 cruise-missile unit was tied
 alongside the sub tender for ten
 days in late May and early June,
 an unusually long period possibly
 occasioned by mechanical problems.
 The two F-class, diesel subma-
 rines were sighted replenishing
 alongside the tender on 24 June.
 Soviet support ships have
 operated with submarines in the
 past, but this is the first time
 a large group of ships has oper-
 ated for so long a period this
 far from home waters.
 The Soviets have good reason
 to improve their submarine support
 capability.  Their missile sub-
 marines operating in the Atlantic
 are based in the Northern Fleet,
 over two weeks cruising time
 from potential missile launch
 stations off the US coast.  The
 use of a group of? support ships
 closer to operating areas allows
 replenishment and minor repairs
 at sea with little loss in time
 on station.

 MIDDLE EAST - AFRICA
 The Egyptians seem to have finally realized
 that the Arabs' constant proclamations about "driv-
 ing the Israelis into the sea" have boomeranged, and
 that their case against Israel has been weakened in
 the eyes of the world.  Nasir, himself, is plagued
 by divisive factions within his regime and burgeoning
 economic problems, especially the shortage of food.
 The governments in the Maghreb, like their brothers
 in the Arab world, are trying to salvage what they
 can from the debacle, and are particularly sensitive
 to the strong public antipathy toward Israel and the
 US.
 Israel continues to consolidate its gains.  This
 week Tel Aviv paved the way far the formal annexa-
 tion of the Old City of Jerusalem.  The Israelis also
 are holding out for private negotiations with the
 Arabs, who refuse to meet them unless they withdraw
 all their forces from Arab lands.

 DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MIDDLE EAST CRISIS
 The attention of the Arab
 world remains focused on New York,
 where the United Nations organiza-
 tion continues its efforts to
 resolve the latest Arab-Tsraeli
 crisis.  The Arabs still insist
 they will not negotiate with Is-
 rael, the Suez Canal has not been
 reopened, and the Arab ban on oil
 shipments to the UK and the US
 continues.
 Israel, meanwhile, is con-
 solidating its gains,  This week
 it paved the way for the formal
 annexation of the Old City of
 Jerusalem.  The municipal bound-
 aries have been extended by the
 Israeli Knesset (parliament) to
 include several villages in the
 suburbs and about five miles
 northward to take in the Qalan-
 diyah Airfield.  Israeli currency
 has been made legal tender in the
 newly expanded Jerusalem.
 Situation at the UN
 Various delegations in the
 United Nations General Assembly
 have been at work this past week
 preparing and canvassing support
 for alternate resolutions to
 those submitted by the US and
 the USSR.  Acting for a group
 of nonaligned countries, the
 Yugoslav representative on 28
 June proposed a resolution--co-
 authored with his Indian col-
 league--calling for uncondi-
 tional withdrawal of Israeli
 forces from occupied Arab ter-
 ritories.  This resolution might
 obtain the requisite two-thirds
 vote if it did not meet strong
 competition.
 Western delegates, therefore,
 planned to offer a resolution on
 29 June which would give a promi-
 nent place to withdrawal but would
 link it with an end to the state
 of war and to a third-party effort
 to negotiate between the states
 concerned.  Denmark's Hans Tabor
 coordinated the new effort with 16
 countries including the US, UK,
 Canada, Japan, the Philippines,
 and several Latin American, West-
 ern European, and African states.
 While most of them are iri agree-
 ment with Tabor's approach of con-
 ditional withdrawal, Mexico has
 continued to insist on withdrawal
 as a prerequisite to further steps.
 The Arab states are seeking
 sponsors for a separate resolution
 on Jerusalem, apposing the Tsraeli
 incorporation action, and Peru is
 drafting a resolution in favor of
 internationalizing the city.
 Nasir remains
 very much at
 the helm in Egypt,
 although his
 freedom of action m
 ay be cir-
 cumscribed by pressures
 within
 his regime,
 the growing
 acknowl-
 edgement of
 defeat, and
 increas-
 ing economic
 problems.
 The
 basic division into pro-Western
 and pro-Eastern factions has be-
 come sharper.  The Egyptians,
 moreover, apparently have come
 to realize that the Arabs' per-
 sistent declarations prior to
 hostilities of their determina-
 tion to "drive the Israelis into
 the sea" have boomeranged in the
 present situation, greatly

 weakening their case against Is-
 rael in the eyes of the world.
 Egypt's neighbor to the
 south, Sudan, reportedly has
 sent a delegation to Moscow to
 negotiate for arms, despite ob-
 jections of the Sudanese mili-
 tary who prefer Western arms.
 The Jordanian Government
 is swamped with an estimated
 100,000 refugees who had fled
 to the East Bank of the Jordan
 River since the fighting began
 on 5 June.  They continue to cross
 over but at a lower rate than
 last week.  Facilities for their
 care remain inadequate.  On the
 West Bank the International Red
 Cross has reached agreement with
 its Israeli equivalent for aid
 to the refugees.  Israeli authori-
 ties had earlier refused to allow
 the Red Cross to operate there.
 Although Lebanon did not
 become actively involved in the
 war, the aftermath is severe
 there.  The country's economy has
 been hard hit by the disruption
 of tourism and transit trade,
 and uncertainty in financial and
 business circles.  The danger of
 Muslim-Christian strife appears
 to have subsided, but the poten-
 tial is still there.
 As elsewhere in the Arab world,
 the governments in the Maghreb seem
 to be concentrating on shoring up
 their positions at home where an-
 tipathy toward Israel and the US re-
 mains strong.  Characteristically,
 their chants about Arab unity are
 being submerged by traditional in-
 tra-Maghrebian distrust.  The Moroc-
 can Government, expressing fears
 that Algeria may take out its anger
 over the Arab debacle by attacking
 Morocco, is renewing its efforts
 to get mare modern arms.  Stringent
 security measures continue in
 Morocco, and a few anti-Jewish
 incidents have occurred.
 Algeria, still feeling be-
 trayed by Nasir and faced with pub-
 lic lassitude toward such "war"
 measures as a nonredeemable bond
 drive, has toned down its pro-Arab
 propaganda.
 The Tunisian Government has
 moved quickly to counteract popular
 support for Nasir while striving
 to play a constructive role in set-
 tling the crisis in the Arab world.
 President Bourguiba, despite his
 dislike for Nasir, can be ex-
 pected to go as far as necessary
 to show Arab solidarity and pre-
 vent any widening of the gap be-
 tween his government's policy and
 public opinion.  He has replaced
 his security chief for failing to
 anticipate and counter more ef-
 fectively the destructive demon-
 strations against the US and UK
 on 5 June..
 Oil Situation

 country banning all production and
 export of oil, although a press
 campaign currently under way is

 laying the ground work for an
 announcement that exports ex-
 cept to the US and UK will be
 resumed.  Iraq, an earlier hold-
 out, has permitted the Iraqi
 Petroleum Company (IPC) to re-
 sume sales to France and Turkey
 only.  Syria, however, had in-
 dicated before the latest Iraqi
 decision that it would not per-
 mit use of the IPC pipeline
 through Syria to the eastern
 Mediterranean until Israeli
 forces were withdrawn.  Alter-
 nately, Iraqi oil could be ex-
 ported through Basra on the
 Persian Gulf.
 Lack of transport has kept
 production in Saudi Arabia, Ku-
 wait, and the Neutral Zone be-
 low prewar levels.  The shortage
 of tankers also is reflected in
 sharply rising charter rates
 which, since mid-May, have nearly
 quadrupled.  The increase has
 been even greater for ships which
 normally move oil through the
 Suez Canal.  Major oil companies,
 recognizing that the canal prob-
 ably will be closed for at least
 another two months, have begun
 chartering tankers--in many cases
 for two consecutive voyages--
 with initial loading as late as
 September.
 The Soviets do not appear
 to be pushing POL sales to Euro-
 pean markets at the expense of
 the Arab producers, although
 they have agreed to increase de-
 liveries being made under agree-
 ments antedatin  the war.
 The Soviet Position
 Soviet officials have indi-
 cated a more realistic view of
 the Arab-Israeli situation in
 private conversations than Premier
 Kosygin showed at his UN press
 conference.  Moscow seems to have
 no illusions regarding the suc-
 cess of its efforts to get through
 a General Assembly resolution con-
 demning Israel as the "aggressor."
 It probably would settle for a
 resolution simply calling for
 withdrawal of Israeli forces in
 hopes of preparing the way for in-
 direct talks between Arabs and Is-
 raelis.
 The Soviets continue to avoid
 taking a public stand on direct
 Arab-Israeli talks or even on
 access to the Suez Canal and the
 Gulf of Aqaba--which would be the
 primary topics at such discus-
 sions.  Privately, they have en-
 couraged the Egyptians to begin
 thinking about these questions.
 Soviet Army Chief of Staff
 Zakharov has not yet returned from
 the trip he made to Cairo to make
 personal damage assessments.  The
 communique on President Podgorny's
 visit to Cairo was deliberately
 vague, and the Egyptian press has
 SECRET
 25X1
 Approved Fo~R'elease 2006/~~,/~R~Ci -RDP79-009205900020001-7
 acknowledged that he and Nasir
 disagreed on a number of major
 points.  One editorial concludes
 that Egyptian friendship with
 the USSR should not conceal the
 fact that the battle is an Arab
 one and "its burden falls mainly
 on our shoulders."
 East European Attitudes
 Except for "neutralist" Ru-
 mania, the East European regimes
 continue their strong public
 support for the Arabs.  The
 Czechs on 26 June sent Party Sec-
 retary Koucky to Cairo and a
 Foreign Ministry official to Da-
 mascus to discuss arrangements
 for additional aid.
 A Bulgarian offi-
 cial, moreover, has stated that
 the "socialist"countries do not
 favor Egyptian control of the
 Strait of Tiran but prefer an in-
 ternational convention regulating
 the use of the Suez Canal, the
 Gulf of Aqaba, the Turkish straits,
 the Panama Canal, and other in-
 ternational waterwa s.             25X1

 by personal and tribal rivalries,
 but the explosion that followed
 reflected the intensity of anti-
 British feeling and of Arab
 xenophobia fanned by the war with
 Israel.  The rebellious SAA units
 gave up the same day but, with

 army dissidence could recur at

 but reports persist of continuing
 conflict there and elsewhere be-

 by members of the National Libera-

 bloodbath between the two organi-

 believe the resulting loss of ci-
 vilian life would further alienate
 the local population, and might
 cost Britain the loyalty of the
 entire SAA.  The failure to re-
 take Crater and the continuing
 withdrawal--according to a pre-
 arranged schedule--of nearly all
 British forces from other parts
 of the South Arabian Federation
 may be interpreted as a sign of
 weakness and encourage the ter-
 rorists to take further initia-
 tives.  Terrorism--some of it
 directed against US interests--
 has been stepped up in other
 parts of Aden.
 On 19 June Britain had an-
 nounced that South Arabia would
 be granted formal independence on
 9 January 1968 with limited Brit-
 ish military assistance and pro-
 tection.  The outbreak of violence
 the following day has cast further
 doubt, however, on the viability
 of the federation government. The
 nationalists continue to regard
 it as the tool of reactionar  sul-
 tans.
 US officials in Aden believe t at
 Britain may not even come through
 with the promised $28-million

 NIGERIA'S GOWON MARKING TIME IN CONFRONTATION WITH "BIAFRA"

 of an imminent attack by federal

 Eastern Region, Maj. Gen. Gowon
 apparently remains reluctant to

 strength there has probably
 reached 6,000-7,000 troops,

 The timing of a federal

 desire to assemble all the man-

 rebuffs, he is still pressing
 his search--possibly even in
 the USSR--for the desired items.
 His apparent preference to have
 them in hand before attacking
 might quickly be overriden by
 other considerations, however.
 One is the question of how
 the oil companies, notably Shell-
 BP, handle the conflicting claims
 of Gowon and Biafran Governor
 Ojukwu on the next revenue pay-
 ment from oil operations in Bia-
 Another factor bearing on
 Gowon's plans to attack is that
 of international recognition of
 Ojukwu's regime.  No country has
 recognized Biafra yet, but if
 Gowon believed such a move were
 imminent he might try to head it
 off by attacking at once.  Sev-

 active Latin American participation in the UN dis-
 cussions of the Middle East crisis.
 The Robles government in Panama is making a
 concerted effort to win domestic support for the
 three new draft treaties on the Panama Canal that
 were announced by Presidents Johnson and Robles on
 26 June.  So far, Panamanians have reacted little
 to the news that two and a half years of negotia-
 tions have been successfully concluded, but inten-
 sive comment and politicking for and against the
 treaties can be expected when their provisions are
 made public in a few weeks.
 Mexico is preparing for what in the past has
 been a quiet, routine off-year election of the
 lower house of the federal congress and a number
 of state governors.  Public unhappiness with the
 candidate tapped by the powerful national ruling
 party to be the next governor of Sonora led to an
 abortive revolt, however, and as a consequence, the
 2 July elections could produce new fireworks there
 or strengthen pressures for a change in Mexico's
 traditional one-party rule.
 In Bolivia, the Barrientos government was
 faced with yet another acute problem last week when
 extremist-led tin miners picked a bloody fight with
 government forces.  The miners and their student
 allies are still sullen and restless, and their re-
 belliousness may again flare up and cause further
 serious political and economic losses for the gov-
 ernment.
 Normally placid Uruguay also experienced a po-
 litical crisis when wrangling over economic policy
 produced a sharp factional battle within the ruling
 Colorado Party.  The ensuing cabinet shake-up and
 the ruffled feelings that accompanied it probably
 hurt the Gestido government's chances of timely po-
 litical su port for a badly needed overhaul o.f the
 economy.

 VIOLENCE IN BOLIVIA
 Weeks of unrest at the major
 Bolivian tin mining complexes of
 Huanuni and Catavi - Siglo Veinte
 erupted into bloody clashes be-
 tween miners and the army on 24
 June.
 The miners, drunk from a
 day's festivities and egged on by
 extremists who hoped to provoke
 government reaction, attacked
 police posts at Siglo Veinte on
 the night of 23 June.  Army and
 police units moved into Huanuni
 and Catavi early the next morni.nq_.
 The army encountered serious re-
 sistance at Catavi, where troops
 used arrested miners and students
 as human shields against attacks-.
 Three soldiers and about 21
 miners were killed, and scores
 of miners were injured.
 The army withdrew on 25 June
 but returned the following day
 after a miner was killed in one
 of the sporadic clashes with the
 police.  The government may pro-
 long the occupation to prevent a
 recurrence of the trouble.  Other
 groups plan work stoppages and
 sympathy demonstrations in other
 parts of the country, but so far
 the violence has been confined to
 one area.  Even if the clashes
 stop soon, however, the deteri-
 orating financial situation in
 the mining industry is depressing
 the economy, which is bound to
 produce further political problems
 for the government.
 President Barrientos has
 ordered the troops to rule with
 an iron hand, apparently in the
 hopes of averting charges that
 his government is incapable of
 maintaining order.  Barrientos
 links the violence in the mines
 with the guerrilla movement.  In
 a broadcast, on 26 June, he
 claimed that the violence was
 part of a "revolutionary plan
 designed and financed by the
 Peking-Havana axis that could
 have led to a civil war."
 Meanwhile, the hard-pressed
 government is continuing to suffer
 losses inflicted by the pro-Com-
 munist guerrilla band active in
 the Southeast. An army support
 unit suffered three dead and two
 wounded in a clash with guerrillas
 on 26 June.
 The government has yet to dem-
 onstrate that it has control over the
 situation in the mines, and this
 show of weakness is encouraging op-
 positionists to step up their polit-
 ical attacks against the Barrientos
 administration.
 LATIN A(~ERICA SEEKS ARMS IN EUROPE
 Major South American nations,
 frustrated by their inability to
 buy modern US military equipment
 to replace worn-out tanks, air-
 craft, ships, and small arms, are
 showing increasing interest in
 European suppliers.  One result
 could be a sharp decline in the
 preponderant US influence that
 has characterized Latin American

 defense planning and development
 since World War II.
 Peru and Brazil in particu-
 lar have objected to the US em-
 bargo on sales of supersonic jets
 before fiscal 1970.  The Peruvian
 Air Force is on the verge of sign-
 ing a contract with France for
 16 Mirage 5 fighters, a simpli-
 fied version of the Mirage III
 used by the Israeli Air Force.
 The Mirage 5 is designed to use
 short, unsurfaced runways and its
 maintenance is relatively un-
 complicated.  It is faster and
 more versatile than the US F-5,
 the aircraft most in demand by
 the Latin air forces, and is not
 much more expensive.  If Peru
 acquires the French jet, several
 other nations--including Argen-
 tina, Brazil, Chile, and Venezu-
 ela--probably will seek similar
 equipment.
 Peru is also investigating
 the European market for tanks and
 destroyers, and Argentina recently
 sent an army general on a similar
 mission.  Both Britain and France
 seem interested in supplying this
 equipment, and Spain has report-
 edly offered to sell ships.  Al-
 though Latin American naval of-
 ficers have often expressed their
 preference for US equipment, they
 are no longer willing to main-
 tain outmoded destroyers on loan
 from the US and prefer to channel
 their limited funds into acqui-
 sition of newer ships.
 In the past, the Latin Amer-
 ican military have used threats
 of third-country purchases pri-
 marily as a bargaining point for
 dealing with the US.  With the
 cutback in US defense sales to
 Latin America, however, they seem
 to be serious in seeking deals
 with Europe.  They also seem to
 be prepared to accept military
 training and technical missions
 from Euro can su  liers.
 LATIN AMERICAN SOLIDARITY ORGANIZATION TO MEET IN CUBA
 The first Latin American Sol-
 idarity Organization (LASO) con-
 ference, scheduled to convene in
 Havana on 28 July, will probably
 focus on shifting the path of
 Latin American Communism away from
 urban proletarianism toward rural
 guerrilla insurgency.  Regardless
 of the outcome,-the proceedings
 will almost certainly exacerbate
 tensions between Castroite mili-
 tants and the pro-Soviet Commu-
 nists who prefer to concentrate
 on legal action, at least for the
 present.  This issue was probably
 a point of contention during So-
 viet Premier Kosygin's discussions
 with Fidel Castro this week.
 LASO was founded by 27 mili-
 tant Latin American delegations
 immediately after the Tri-Con-
 tinent Conference in January 1966
 in order to "coordinate the strug-
 gle against US imperialism.  In
 August 1966 an organizing commit-
 tee consisting of representatives
 from Cuba, Brazil, Colombia, Guy-
 ana, Guatemala, Mexico, Peru, Uru-
 guay, and Venezuela met to plan
 for the 1967 conference.  In Oc-
 tober this committee issued a draft

 agenda, inspired by Castro's mili-
 tant foreign policy, which called
 for discussion of a common strategy
 of armed insurrection for all La-
 tin American revolutionary move-
 ments.  It also issued a call for
 the creation of national LASO com-
 mittees in the various Latin Amer-
 ican countries.
 The formation of these com-
 mittees, which will send delegates
 to the July conference, appears to
 be causing great problems. Thus
 far, the only ones officially es-
 tablished outside Cuba are in
 Chile and Colombia.
 In a dispute over formation
 of the Chilean committee, the So-
 cialist Party claimed that its
 less militant Communist coalition
 partner had no right to partici-
 pate in LASO because of its sub-
 ordination to Soviet interests
 and consequent failure to support
 national liberation movements.
 The Communists denied  these
 charges, and insisted that they
 were opposing inclusion of pro-
 Peking Communists and other mili-
 tants only because they wanted to
 exclude "adventurers."  Despite
 what must have been strong Com-
 munist objections, the committee
 is heavily weighted in favor of
 the Socialists.  The delegation
 it has named includes such Castro
 admirers as perennial presiden-
 tial hopeful and Senate president
 Salvador Allende and a recent
 visitor to Havana, Senator and
 Socialist Party Secretary General
 Aniceto Rodriguez.
 The Colombian national com-
 mittee, like the Chilean, con-
 tains some orthodox Communist
 Party members, but includes a
 heavy complement from the insur-
 gent Army of National Liberation
 and the extremist Worker-Student-
 Peasant Movement.
 The obvious pro-Castro tone
 of the preparations has reportedly
 caused the orthodox Venezuelan
 Communist Party to decide against
 sending a delegation--apparently
 leaving the field open to the pro-
 Castro Armed Forces of National
 Liberation and other guerrilla
 groups.  The Uruguayan Socialist
 Party, on the other hand, has ac-
 cused the Communist-controlled
 Leftist Liberation Front of ex-
 cluding it and other extremists
 from representation.
 Whatever the outcome of these
 arguments, it is becoming increas-
 ingly clear--from the organizing
 committee's provocative declara-
 tions and Castro's stated dissat-
 isfaction with  Latin American
 pro-Soviet Communist Parties--
 that the hemisphere is going to
 witness an open ideological strug-
 gle between Castroite insurgents
 and orthodox Communists.  The
 Cuban leader has apparently be-
 come completely convinced that
 his revolution, beginning with
 a small guerrilla nucleus and ac-
 complished without Soviet or Chi-
 nese assistance, is the only
 valid course for others to fol-
 low to achieve national libera-
 tion.  Thus, the July LASO con-
 ference will be used as a forum
 to appeal to Latin Americans to
 band together in "red beret"
 groups in order to begin a true
 revolutionary struggle.
