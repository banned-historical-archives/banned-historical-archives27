 1. BRIEF SURVEY OF THE TRADE UNION
 MOVEMENT IN CHINA
 China's trade union movement began after the
 First World War.  Ever since its first days, it has
 developed under the leadership of the Chinese Com-
 munist Party.
 The Communist Party of China, after it was
 founded on July 1, 1921, established the Chinese Trade
 Union Secretariat, openly to lead the working-class
 movement of the country.
 Under the auspices of the Secretariat, the First
 All-China Labour Congress was held in May 1922 in
 Canton,  attended  by  162  delegates,  representing
 200,000 workers organized in more than a hundred
 trade unions in twelve cities. The Congress discussed
 ways of eliminating the craft outlook among union
 members and the differences between local groupings
 in trade unions, educating the workers in socialism,
 drawing them into the democratic revolution ; and
 other questions.  The Congress adopted such slogans
 as "Down with imperialism" and "Down with the war-
 lords," and passed resolutions to strive for the 8-hour
 working day and to give support to strikes.  It was
 also resolved that until a national federation of trade
 unions was established, the Chinese Trade Union
 Secretariat was to be recognized as the liaison centre
 for the trade unions of the whole country.

 From 1922 to February 1923, the tide of the
 workers' struggle rose all over the country.  More
 than a hundred strikes were called involving 300,000
 railway workers, dockers and seamen, factory work-
 ers and miners.  The majority of these strikes were
 successful, and during the strikes new trade unions
 were organized. Fearing the growing strength of the
 trade unions, the warlords embarked on a policy of
 suppression.  On February 7, 1923, workers on the
 Peking-Hankow Railway came out to fight for their
 right to form a union, but were crushed by a mas-
 sacre in Hankow and Changhsintien.  Trade unions
 in all areas controlled by the warlords were closed
 down and driven underground, resulting in a tem-
 porary decline in the movement.
 In Kwangtung Province in South China, however,
 trade unions still kept their legal status and the move-
 ment continued to surge ahead.
 In May 1925, sponsored by the trade unions of
 railway workers and seamen and workers of other
 branches of industry, the Second All-China Labour
 Congress was held in Canton, attended by 277 dele-
 gates, representing 165 trade unions with a total of
 540,000 members.  The Congress resolved that an
 All-China Federation of Trade Unions be set up, that
 the working class of the country take an active
 part and lead the revolutionary struggle against im-
 perialism and feudalism, and that the workers unite
 with the peasants and revolutionary forces within the
 country.  In order to link up the struggle of the Chi-
 nese workers with that of the workers of the whole

 world, the Congress voted to affiliate with the Red
 International of Labour Unions.
 Shortly after the Congress textile workers in
 Japanese-owned mills in Shanghai came out on strike
 in defence of their union, and during the strike one
 of their leaders was killed.  On May 30 a demon-
 stration of the Shanghai workers in support of the
 textile workers was fired on by the British police of
 the international "settlement."  This led to the na-
 tion-wide demonstrations against imperialism known
 as the "May 30th Movement."   In Canton and Hong-
 kong, the general strikes which aimed at imperialism
 had the sustained support of the workers and people
 throughout the country and lasted sixteen months.
 This movement laid the foundation for the Northern
 Expedition carried out later by the revolutionary gov-
 ernment in Canton.
 The Third All-China Labour Congress was con-
 vened in Canton in May 1926, attended by 502 dele-
 gates, representing 699 trade unions with a member-
 ship of 1,241,000.  The Congress pointed out that the
 immediate task of the Chinese working class was to
 support the National Revolutionary Army to carry out
 the Northern Expedition, and to unite with the peas-
 ants, who constituted 80 per cent of China's popula-
 tion, in the common struggle.
 After the Northern Expedition was launched in
 July 1926, workers all over the country organized
 transport teams to support the expeditionary army.
 Workers in Shanghai, in co-ordination with the north-
 ward drive of the army, staged three armed uprisings
 and occupied Shanghai.  The trade union movement

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 developed rapidly with the victorious advance of the
 expeditionary army.  Never before had the All-China
 Federation of Trade Unions enjoyed such high pres-
 tige among the nation's workers and office employees.
 In June 1927, the Fourth All-China Labour Congress
 was convened in Hankow.  It was attended by 420
 delegates, representing 2,800,000 members, an increase
 of nearly 1,600,000 over the previous year.  The Con-
 gress condemned Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal of the
 revolution, and called upon the workers of the whole
 country to carry on the struggle. Following the failure
 of the First Revolutionary Civil War (1924-1927), the
 trade union movement fell to a low ebb under the reign
 of terror of the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek clique.
 After the betrayal of the revolution by the Kuo-
 mintang, the Chinese Communist Party set up revolu-
 tionary bases in the countryside.  Here the workers
 were accorded broad democratic rights, and they or-
 ganized their own trade unions and actively supported
 the revolutionary war.  In areas controlled by the
 Kuomintang, the broad masses of workers waged un-
 remitting struggles against the reactionary rule for
 democratic rights and better living conditions.
 In November 1929, the Fifth All-China Labour
 Congress was held secretly in Shanghai, attended by
 a hundred delegates.  The Congress called upon the
 workers to oppose the reactionary rule of the Chiang
 Kai-shek clique.
 In July 1937, the War of Resistance to Japanese
 Aggression broke out. Leaders of the All-China Fed-
 eration of Trade Unions went to the liberated areas
 in the enemy's rear, and to areas occupied by the

 Japanese and the Kuomintang, to wage the struggle
 against the Japanese invaders.
 In the fight against the enemy, the workers of
 the liberated areas demonstrated their courage and
 determination, vigorously carrying on production in
 order to support the war.  At the same time they
 formed many trade unions.  In 1945, the Preparatory
 Committee of the Workers' Federation of China's
 Liberated Areas was set up which comprised organ-
 izations covering 920,000 members.
 In September 1945, the World Federation of Trade
 Unions held its constituent congress in Paris.  Teng
 Fa, representing the workers in the liberated areas,
 and Chu Hsueh-fan, President of the Chinese Associa-
 tion of Labour in Kuomintang-controlled areas, to-
 gether formed a delegation to attend the congress on
 behalf of all the workers of China.  The Chinese trade
 unions formally joined the World Federation of Trade
 Unions.
 In the nineteen years after the Fifth All-China
 Labour Congress, workers in Kuomintang-controlled
 areas were no better than slaves.    They had practical-
 ly no freedom or rights whatsoever, and suffered from
 the ruthless exploitation of bureaucrat-capitalists and
 groaned under the joint rule of terror of the imperial-
 ists and Chiang Kai-shek clique.                                         But, undaunted, the
 workers persisted in their heroic struggles.  During
 the years of the War of Liberation, the workers in
 Kuomintang-controlled areas waged struggles against
 foreign aggression, against starvation, persecution and
 civil war.  In co-ordination with the People's Libera-

 tion Army, they dealt telling blows to the reactionary
 rule of Chiang Kai-shek.
 In August 1948, a year before the nation-wide
 victory in the Chinese People's War of Liberation,
 the Sixth All-China Labour Congress was held at Har-
 bin, then a liberated city.  The Congress was attended
 by 518 delegates from trade unions in the liberated
 areas, from the Chinese Association of Labour and
 other democratic trade unions in the Kuomintang-
 controlled areas, representing altogether a total of
 2,830,000 organized workers.  The Congress adopted
 resolutions on the current tasks of the Chinese trade
 union movement.
 The supreme task of the Chinese working class,
 the resolutions pointed out, was to strengthen work-
 ing-class solidarity and unite with all sections of the
 people to overthrow the rule of American imperialism
 and its tool-the Kuomintang reactionary clique, and
 establish the Chinese People's Republic.  The resolu-
 tions also defined the tasks of the labour movement
 in the liberated areas and in the Kuomintang-controlled
 areas.
 The Sixth Congress decided to restore the All-
 China Federation of Trade Unions, amended its Con-
 stitution and elected the Sixth Executive Committee.
 Thus it enabled the Chinese working class to regain
 its unity under the banner of the people's revolution.
 Following  the  Sixth  Congress,  the  Chinese
 working class waged bitter struggles in line with the
 resolutions of the Congress.  In spite of extremely
 difficult conditions, workers in the liberated areas,
 together with peasants, succeeded in increasing pro-

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 duction to support the War of Liberation.  On the
 other hand, workers in the Kuomintang-controlled
 areas, uniting with various sections of the people,
 fought against aggression, persecution and hunger.
 In the liberation of various cities the workers fought
 to protect factories, helped the people's government
 to take over the enterprises owned by bureaucrat-
 capital and rapidly restored production.  At the same
 time the trade unions carried out political education
 among the workers which strengthened their under-
 standing of their new position as masters of the coun-
 try and gave them a new attitude towards labour.
 During 1949 all major cities in the country were
 liberated and in February the All-China Federation
 of Trade Unions moved from Harbin to Peking.  It
 convened, in July of the same year, a national con-
 ference on trade union work, at which the question
 of organizing the workers on a nation-wide scale was
 discussed.  In November 1949, the Chinese Associa-
 tion of Labour, which was affiliated as a separate or-
 ganization to the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions, voluntarily announced its dissolution.  This
 further strengthened the unity of China's trade union
 organizations.  In June 1950, the Trade Union Law
 of the People's Republic of China was promulgated by
 the Central People's Government which granted ex-
 tensive rights to trade union organizations.                                           Since
 then the trade union movement has spread rapidly all
 over the country.
 On May 2, 1953, the Seventh All-China Congress
 of Trade Unions opened in Peking.  Delegates to the

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 Congress numbered 830, representing 10,200,000 trade
 union members.  The Congress elected the Seventh
 Executive Committee, adopted a report on amendments
 to the Constitution and amended the Constitution. The
 Congress also adopted important resolutions concern-
 ing reports on the trade union work in China.  These
 reports and resolutions summed up the experiences
 gained in trade union work in the four years after
 liberation, and defined the policies and tasks of trade
 union work in the period of planned national economic
 construction.
 The fundamental tasks of the Chinese trade union
 organizations during the period of national construc-
 tion, the resolutions pointed out, were to unite and
 educate the workers to steadily raise their political
 consciousness and strengthen their sense of organiza-
 tion; to consolidate the worker-peasant alliance; to
 unite with all sections of the people to work actively
 for the fulfilment of the national construction plan;
 to gradually improve, on the basis of developing pro-
 duction, the material and cultural life of the working
 class and all other working people; and to strive, step
 by step, for China's socialist industrialization and
 transition to socialism.
 The resolutions of the Congress also made it clear
 that internationally the task of the Chinese trade
 unions was to fight, continuously, for lasting peace and
 for greater solidarity and unity among the workers
 in the labour movement of the Far East and all over
 the world.

 At the present moment, the Chinese trade unions,
 which by December 1954 had a membership of 12,-
 454,000, are leading the working class throughout the
 country to strive for fulfilling ahead of schedule the
 First Five-Year Plan (1953-57) for Development of
 the National Economy.

 II. THE ORGANIZATION OF THE
 TRADE UNIONS
 1. The Organizational Principle of the Trade Unions
 The trade unions of the People's Republic of China
 are organized along industrial lines, based on demo-
 cratic centralism.                                       They are under one national unified
 centre.
 (1)  Under the principle of organization along
 industrial lines, all trade union members in the same
 enterprise or office are grouped together in one single
 basic organization ; and all trade union members in
 the same industrial branch of the national economy
 are organized in the same national industrial union.
 Local trade unions, whenever possible, are also to be
 organized along industrial lines.  Thus, all the work-
 ers of an integrated iron and steel works-steel smelt-
 ers, machinists, building workers, electrical workers,
 transport workers, engineers and technicians, and
 other workers and staff members-are organized in
 the same primary trade union body which is part of
 the national heavy industry workers' trade union. And
 the trade union members in the works coming under
 the Ministry of Heavy Industry are organized in the
 Heavy Industry Workers' Trade Union. Organization-
 ally, this principle guarantees close unity of the work-
 ers throughout the country as an integral body.

 are elected democratically from below by the member-
 ship or its representatives.  They submit reports on
 their work at regular intervals to the membership ;
 the lower trade union organizations carry out the de-
 cisions of the higher trade union organizations ; the
 trade unions of all levels carry on their work in ac-
 cordance with their Constitution and the decisions
 made.  All decisions are made by a majority vote of
 the members present at the meetings.  The Constitu-
 tion of the Trade Unions of the People's Republic
 of China also stipulates that the All-China Congress
 of Trade Unions shall be convened every four years;
 the national congresses of industrial unions, every
 three years; congresses of the provincial trade union
 councils, the trade union councils of those cities direct-
 ly under the central authority, and provincial con-
 gresses  of  industrial  unions,  every  two  years;
 congresses of trade union councils of those cities direct-
 ly under the provincial authority and congresses of
 industrial unions in cities and mining areas, annually;
 the general membership meeting or the meeting of
 representatives in an enterprise or institution, every
 year or six months. This principle guarantees dem-
 ocratic life in the trade unions.

 eration of Trade Unions; while the supreme authority
 is the All-China Congress of Trade Unions.  The lat-
 ter elects the Executive Committee and the Auditing
 Commission of the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions.  The Executive Committee at its plenary
 session elects the Presidium and the Secretariat.  In
 the intervals between Congresses, the Executive Com-
 mittee is responsible for the thorough implementation
 of the decisions of the Congress and for guiding trade
 union work throughout the country.
 The Presidium is the supreme leading body when
 the Executive Committee is not in session, and is re-
 sponsible for carrying out the decisions of the Con-
 gress and of the Executive Committee, and directing
 trade union work on the national scale.  The Secre-
 tariat attends to the routine work under the guidance
 of the Presidium.  (Table showing the organizational
 system of the trade unions attached.)
 The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has
 set up the following department to carry out its work :
 (1) General Executive Office, (2) Organization De-
 partment, (3) Propaganda Department,.(4) Produc-
 tion Department, (5) Wages Department, (6) Labour
 Protection Department;4 (7) Labour Insurance Depart-
 ment, (8) Finance Department, (9) Department con-

 Unions, (16) The Workers' Daily, (17) The Workers'
 Publishing House.
 The highest leading bodies of eighteen industrial
 unions have been set up.  They are the national com-
 mittees of thirteen industrial unions-railway work-
 ers, seamen, heavy industry workers, postal and tele-
 communications workers, first machinery industry
 workers, second machinery industry workers, electri-
 cal workers, coal miners, textile workers, highway
 transport workers, shop assistants, educational work-
 ers and petroleum workers ; the preparatory com-
 mittees of three industrial unions for building workers,
 agricultural and water conservancy workers and the
 forestry workers; and the working committees of two
 industrial unions for light industry workers and salt
 industry workers.  Between sessions of the national
 congresses of the industrial unions, the respective
 national committees are responsible for the carrying
 out of the decisions of these congresses and of the All-
 China Federation of Trade Unions, and for directing
 the work of their respective organizations.
 The Fourth Plenary Session of the Seventh Ex-
 ecutive Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions, held in January 1956, decided to improve the
 work of all industrial unions to meet the needs of the
 socialist construction of our country.  The session de-
 cided to strengthen their leading bodies and the lead-
 ing bodies at intermediate levels, and to give more
 active leadership to the basic organizations.  The
 session also decided to restore the national leading
 bodies of the industrial unions of civil aviation work-
 ers, geological workers, bank workers and medical

 workers, and set up industrial unions of foreign trade
 workers, cultural workers, grain and agricultural prod-
 uce purchasers, supply and marketing co-operative
 workers and government workers.
 (2)  Local Trade Union Organizations
 Local trade union organizations include the trade
 union councils of the provinces, municipalities, auton-
 omous regions, counties and towns.  Elected by the
 trade union congresses of their own levels, these coun-
 cils are the joint leading bodies of the local trade union
 organizations and industrial unions in their respective
 provinces, municipalities, autonomous regions, counties
 and towns.  There are at present twenty-two provin-
 cial trade union councils, three trade union councils
 of municipalities directly under the central authority
 and two trade union councils of autonomous regions,
 all of which are under the direct leadership of the
 All-China Federation of Trade Unions.
 Local trade union organizations also include the
 provincial, municipal and mining area committees of
 the various industrial unions, elected by the provincial,
 municipal and mining area congresses of their respec-
 tive industries and are responsible for leading the
 trade union work of all organizations up to their level
 in their respective industries.
 (3)  Primary Trade Union Organizations
 The primary organizations are the foundation of
 the trade unions. They are formed by the trade union

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 members in the same enterprise or establishment.  In
 an enterprise or establishment with twenty-five union
 members or more, a committee may be set up.    Short
 of this number, a trade union group may be set up,
 and an organizer elected.  In the workshops generally
 workshop committees may be set up and trade union
 groups formed according to production units or office
 units.  The primary committees and workshop com-
 mittees can, if necessary, set up under their own lead-
 ership working committees from among their trade
 union members to deal with the following matters :
 production, wages, rationalization proposals, culture
 and education, labour insurance, labour protection,
 housing and general living standards, finance, and a
 committee for women workers.  They may also set
 up savings and mutual-assistance fund.
 By 1954 the number of primary trade union or-
 ganizations amounted to two hundred thousand.
 3.  Membership
 The trade unions in China are mass organizations
 of the working class formed on a voluntary basis. The
 Constitution of the Trade Unions of the People's Re-
 public of China provides:  "Membership in the trade
 unions shall be open to all manual workers and brain
 workers, whose wages constitute their sole or main
 means of living and who accept the Constitution of
 the Trade Unions."  Any person with such qualifica-
 tions may be admitted to trade union membership
 without distinction of nationality, sex or religious be-

 lief provided his personal application is approved by
 a trade union group and confirmed by the primary
 committee or the workshop committee of the trade
 union concerned.

 111. WORK OF THE TRADE UNIONS
 1.  Organizational Work
 The trade unions of China are the mass organiza-
 tions of the leading class of the state.  The interests
 of the state and the working class have become com-
 pletely identical since the liberation.     With the sup-
 port of the state and under the leadership of the
 Communist Party, the trade unions of China have be-
 come a school of communism for the workers, and are
 a strong social pillar of the people's democratic power.
 The organizational work of the trade unions is to
 mobilize and organize all trade union cadres and work-
 ers throughout the country to carry out the unions'
 fundamental tasks.
 The All-China Federation of Trade Unions is the
 highest leading body of the trade unions of China.
 When its Executive Committee is not in session, the
 Presidium is responsible for carrying out the decisions
 of the All-China Congress of Trade Unions and of
 the Executive Committee, and for directing trade union
 work all over the country.  The routine trade union
 work is dealt with by the Secretariat under the
 guidance of the Presidium.
 The primary trade union organizations are the
 foundation of the trade unions, and are formed by
 the trade union members of the same enterprise or
 establishment. They are the foundation of trade union

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 work because they have direct contact with the masses.
 The trade unions of China, therefore, have paid con-
 sistent and special attention to the primary trade
 union work.  Since the National Conference on the
 Organizational Work of the Trade Unions was held
 in 1950, there has been a great increase in the num-
 ber of primary trade union organizations, which by
 1954 had reached 200,000.  At the meeting to discuss
 organizational work held in 1954, it was stressed that
 the trade unions must make fresh efforts to unite and
 educate the mass of the workers, give further impetus
 to the spirit of democracy, form more solid links with
 the workers, bring the enthusiasm of the trade union
 activists into full play and improve the work of trade
 union groups.
 The tasks of the primary trade union organizations
 are as follows :  (1) To organize the workers and staff
 members to launch labour emulation drives, strengthen
 labour discipline and ensure the fulfilment or over-
 fulfilment of the state's production plans; (2) To
 constantly work to improve the material and cultural
 life of the workers and the betterment of their work-
 ing conditions, to help and supervise the managements
 or owners of enterprises in thoroughly carrying out
 the policies of the people's government and the labour
 laws and decrees; (3) To organize cultural, political
 and technical studies as well as cultural and sports
 activities; and (4) To admit new members, collect dues
 and report regularly both to the higher trade union
 organizations and the membership on their activities
 and financial position.

 Mindful of the fact that democracy is the soul
 of the trade unions and of the importance of bringing
 trade union democracy into full play, the primary trade
 union organizations regularly call general membership
 meetings or meetings of all the workers and staff mem-
 bers at which they report on their work, obtain the
 opinions of the workers and conduct criticism and self-
 criticism.
 The trade unions of China have always considered
 it important to train activists and bring their en-
 thusiasm into full play.  The trade union organizations
 have adopted various ways and means to attain this
 purpose.  They help them to prepare plans for trade
 union work, advise them on the best ways of doing
 their jobs and help them to solve any difficulties they
 may encounter.  Meetings are called to summarize and
 exchange experience of work, and spare-time short-
 term training courses are regularly conducted.  In the
 past few years a large number of activists have been
 brought forward from among the rank and file, who
 put their whole heart into trade union work.  The
 number of trade union activists totalled 2,730,000 in
 1954 as against 1,990,000 in 1953.
 In order to systematically raise the theoretical and
 occupational levels of the cadres and activists, trade
 unions at all levels have set up schools for training
 cadres.  The All-China Federation of Trade Unions
 has set up a school for senior trade union cadres, with
 three branches, which together can take in more than
 2,800 students.  A total of 44 schools for trade union
 cadres have been set up by the industrial unions and
 the provincial and municipal trade union organizations.

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 In 1954 more than 616,000 cadres and activists were
 trained in full-time or spare-time courses at such
 schools.  The Presidium of the Seventh Executive
 Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions, at its ninth meeting held in January 1956,
 decided to improve the work of training trade union
 cadres for the purpose of raising their theoretical,
 occupational and cultural levels.  This will help to
 strengthen the leadership of the trade unions and meet
 the situation brought about by the new upsurge of
 the working-class movement.
 2.  Propaganda and Educational Work
 The propaganda and educational work conducted
 by the trade unions among the workers may be de-
 scribed as follows: to educate the workers in the
 spirit of patriotism and internationalism in co-ordina-
 tion with the production tasks and the important
 political events at the time; to raise their cultural and
 technical levels by organizing study courses; and to
 satisfy their needs of rest and recreation in co-
 ordination with their political, technical and educa-
 tional needs.
 In 1952 trade union organizations in a relatively
 systematic way carried out communist  education
 among the workers.  In the autumn of 1953 they car-
 ried out propaganda and education among the workers
 and staff and their families concerning the general
 tasks of the state during the period of transition to
 socialism.  During the 1954 Spring Festival they or-

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 ganized workers' delegations to visit peasant families,
 invited the peasants to visit factories, held various
 kinds of get-together and informal discussion meet-
 ings, sb educating the workers throughout the country
 on the worker-peasant alliance.  When the Constitu-
 tion of the People's Republic of China was published
 in June 1954 trade union organizations publicized it
 among the workers and staff and initiated extensive
 discussions.  Following the publication of the First
 Five-Year Plan for Development of the National
 Economy of the People's Republic of China in July
 1955, trade union organizations carried out wide-
 spread propaganda among the workers and staff
 through the medium of exhibitions, broadcasting, re-
 port meetings, lectures, entertainments, lantern slides,
 etc.  This helped a great deal to raise the socialist
 enthusiasm of the workers and staff.
 Along with the development of production, the
 workers feel the increasing need to learn to read and
 write and so improve their technical level.  The trade
 unions have done a great deal to organize cultural and
 technical studies for the workers.  They have helped
 the managements to set up training courses and tech-
 nical research societies.  Trade union organizations in
 factories and mines have helped the skilled workers
 and young workers to make master-apprentice agree-
 ments as well as "teach-well-and-learn-well" agree-
 ments.  Statistics for 1954 show that 933,100 workers
 throughout the country participated in the various
 technical courses sponsored by the primary trade union
 organizations.  Of this number, over 109,500 studied
 in the technical schools.  Many workers who have

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 improved their technical skill through this training
 were promoted to leading posts.
 In the old China 60 to 80 per cent of the workers
 were illiterate or semi-illiterate.  But as a result of
 the attention paid by both government and trade
 unions to the work of improving the technical level
 of the workers and staff since liberation, by the end
 of 1953, approximately one million previously illiterate
 workers had learnt to read and write.  In many places
 there are now factories and mines where illiteracy
 among their workers is a thing of the past. In January
 1956 the Presidium of the Seventh Executive Com-
 mittee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions
 adopted at its ninth session a decision to the effect
 that efforts should be made to ensure that workers and
 staff who are now illiterate should be able to read and
 write within three years, that is, by the end of 1958.
 By the end of 1954 there were more than 11,000 spare-
 time cultural schools, attended by more than 2,900,000
 workers, ten times as many as in the period imme-
 diately after the liberation.
 With the support of the people's government, trade
 union organizations have set up a number of clubs
 and palaces of culture which have greatly helped the
 workers in their cultural and sport activities.  By the
 end of 1954, 1,261 palaces of culture (clubs) had been
 set up by higher trade union organizations ; 9,206 clubs
 and 2,723 "Red Corners" (in workshops) set up by
 primary trade union organizations-altogether about
 16 times as many as in 1950. At present there are over
 1,600 trade union film projection teams as against 150

 in 1951; 17,000 libraries, with more than 24,530,000
 volumes, and 8,670 broadcasting stations.
 In the past few years rapid advances have been
 made in the sphere of spare-time cultural and artistic
 activities.  It is estimated that in 1954 there were
 11,900 workers' music and dance units and groups
 engaged in other recreational activities, with 162,000
 taking part.  In February 1955, the workers and staff
 in Peking, Shanghai, Tientsin, Chungking and four
 other big cities, and the workers and staff under the
 Ministry of Railways participated in the National
 Amateur Music and Dance Festival.  In May 1955,
 the National Workers' Art Exhibition was held in
 Peking, which attracted three hundred items.  These
 events fully bear out the creative ability of the work-
 ing people.
 There are 13 trade union newspapers throughout
 the country.  The Workers' Daily is the official pub-
 lication of the Executive Committee of the All-China
 Federation of Trade Unions, with a circulation of
 150,000 copies.  The journal Chinese Workers, also
 published by the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions, has a circulation of 290,000 copies.  In 1955
 alone the Workers Press under the All-China Fed-
 eration of Trade Unions published 8,405,000 books of
 271 different titles, covering trade union work and the
 trade union movement.
 3.  Physical Culture
 In accordance with Chairman Mao Tse-tung's
 directive "Develop Physical Culture, Improve the Peo-

 pie's  Physique" the trade union organizations at
 various levels have, since liberation, done a lot to
 popularize physical culture among the workers and
 staff members. Remarkable results have been achieved
 in improving the health of workers, which has led
 to a decrease in sickness, ensured a regular attendance
 at work and raised labour productivity.  During 1954,
 more than 838,000 workers in China regularly took
 part in basket-ball, volley-ball and football matches and
 more than 82,700 teams were organized. The majority
 of workers and staff in various industrial and mining
 enterprises are enthusiasts for morning exercises
 directed by music from the radio and many sports
 teams and training groups have been formed to carry
 on regular physical training.
 The basic organization to lead sports activities is
 the sports association, which is a voluntary body of
 amateur athletes.  In 1951, the China Locomotive
 Athletic Association, the first trade union national
 sports association, was organized by the railway work-
 ers.                                      In 1954, after the convening of the First Na-
 tional Workers' Sports Conference, there was a further
 increase in the number of sports associations.  At the
 end of 1955, there were 11 national, 61 provincial and
 municipal and 181 local athletic associations in addi-
 tion to many athletic committees and groups.
 A great number of workers have been trained by
 the trade union organizations during the last six years
 to take on coaching, training and other sports work in
 their spare time.  According to partial figures for the
 eight municipalities of Peking, Shanghai, Tientsin,
 Canton, Wuhan, Shenyang, Harbin and Fushun, 53

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 classes were formed in the period between 1951 and
 1954 which gave training to 18,847 workers for various
 sports activities.
 As sports activities spread, more facilities and
 grounds have been provided for the workers in fac-
 tories and mines.  The number of basket-ball and
 volley-ball courts, football pitches, tracks and grounds
 for athletic activities run by the primary trade union
 organizations in the three municipalities (Shenyang,
 Fushun, and Harbin) increased from 1,237 in 1954 to
 2,054 in 1955, and the equipment provided, such as
 horizontal bars, parallel bars, box horses and weights
 for weight-lifting, increased from 2,571 pieces to 3,101.
 It was decided at the First National Workers' Sports
 Conference held in November 1954 that 10 to 15 per
 cent of trade union funds should be appropriated for
 the use of athletic activities.
 In order to encourage the workers to go in for
 sports and to improve athletic standards, many track
 and field meetings and ball games have been held.
 Partial data of five municipalities-Peking, Shanghai,
 Harbin, Fushun and Taiyuan-and of the China
 Locomotive Sports Association showed that 6,881
 athletic meetings were held from 1951 to August 1955,
 attended by more than 940,000 athletes.  The First
 National Workers' Sports Meeting which took place
 in Peking in October 1955 enabled a review to be made
 of the achievements of the workers in the field of
 physical culture.  Over 1,700 men and women athletes
 took part.  In the forty-seven track and field events,
 cycle races and weight-lifting contest, eight national
 records were broken by ten men and women workers,

 including the men's shot-putting which had stood for
 nineteen years.
 4.  Production Work
 In a people's democratic state led by the working
 class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, the
 ultimate aim of developing production is to satisfy the
 ever-increasing material and cultural needs of the
 people.  Therefore, to develop production is in the
 greatest interest of the liberated Chinese people. The
 most important task of the trade union organizations
 is to unite and lead all the workers to struggle con-
 scientiously and enthusiastically for greater and great-
 er output.
 One of the main methods used by the trade union
 organizations to improve production is to lead and
 encourage the mass of the workers to take part in
 socialist  emulation  campaigns.  In  1950,  683,000
 workers took part in these emulation campaigns; the
 figure went up to 2,380,000 in 1951; from 1952 on-
 wards, over 80 per cent of all workers and staff in the
 country's factories and mines were taking part.
 In the socialist emulation drive, we put into prac-
 tice the principle of constantly improving technique
 and learning and mastering new techniques; we give
 full play to the collective wisdom of the workers, and
 we rely on their enthusiasm to put forward rational-
 ization proposals.  The proposers are given material
 reward. The workers are encouraged to learn seriously
 Soviet advanced experiences as well as to popularize
 their own successes.

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 From 1950 to 1953, 1,643,708 rationalization pro-
 posals were put forward by workers and staff mem-
 bers.                                     In 1954, when the All-China Federation of
 Trade Unions put forward the call to "Further De-
 velop the Labour Emulation Drive" not only did the
 number of proposals increase, but they were generally
 much more valuable.  In 1954, over 848,000 rational-
 ization proposals were made and it was estimated that
 the realization of 102,966 alone increased the wealth
 of the country by 174,310,000 yuan.
 In August 1954 on the proposal of the All-China
 Federation of Trade Unions, the Government Ad-
 ministration Council promulgated the "Provisional
 Regulations on Awards for Inventions, Technical Im-
 provements and Rationalization Proposals Concerning
 Production."  This policy has greatly enhanced the
 workers' enthusiasm.
 The Soviet advanced experiences and the ad-
 vanced experiences of our own workers have been
 widely popularized in the industrial and mining en-
 terprises  throughout  the  country.  According  to
 available data for 1952-1954, 102 important advanced
 methods were adopted in heavy industry, and as a
 result the output of steel was increased by 60 per cent
 and the total value of output of iron was increased
 by one third.
 As the socialist emulation drive has extended and
 deepened, a great number of model workers and dis-
 tinguished workers have been brought forward on the
 production front.  From 1949 to 1953, more than 230,-
 600 model workers were elected from the primary
 trade union organizations throughout China. In 1954,
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 153,900 model workers and distinguished workers and
 220,400 advanced workers were elected from the pri-
 mary trade union organizations in the factories and
 mines.  In the first half of 1955, among the highway
 transport workers in 33 provinces and municipalities,
 there was, on the average, one model worker or ad-
 vanced worker out of every fifteen workers.  Many of
 the model workers and advanced workers were en-
 gineering technicians.  Among the eighty-seven model
 workers elected from the power industry in 1955, en-
 gineering technicians constituted more than 19 per
 cent.
 Because of the enthusiasm and creative ability
 displayed by the workers in production, labour pro-
 ductivity has been rising continuously.  For instance,
 the labour productivity of the workers in large in-
 dustrial enterprises, both state and joint state-private,
 showed a 13 per cent rise in 1953 as compared with
 1952; and in 1954 registered a further 15 per cent
 increase.  The First Five-Year Plan for Development
 of the National Economy has set the target of raising
 labour productivity in the state industries by 64 per
 cent from 1953 to 1957.
 The Chinese working class has full confidence for
 the future, and is striving selflessly for building their
 country into a great socialist state.  The workers in
 the factories and mines throughout the country have
 pledged themselves to fulfil the First Five-Year Plan
 ahead of schedule.  The workers of the Anshan Iron
 and Steel Company have undertaken to fulfil in 1956
 the targets set them for 1957 under the First Five-
 Year Plan.  In the Shenyang Pneumatic Tool Plant,

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 the workers are going about their jobs with great en-
 thusiasm for the realization of their pledge to fulfil
 the Five-Year Plan one year ahead of schedule.  In
 the Tientsin Bicycle Factory, after the workers had
 taken a pledge to fulfil the Five-Year Plan ahead of
 schedule they put forward over eighty technical pro-
 posals.  The workers and staff in the Harbin Flax
 Mill, where the 1955 production targets were fulfilled
 more than one month ahead, set themselves the task
 of reaching the production levels of 1957 one year
 and twenty-three work-days ahead of time.
 5.  Wages
 As mentioned above, the aim of developing pro-
 duction of our country is to satisfy the ever-increasing
 material and cultural needs of the people.  It is the
 highest aim of the people's government and the Com-
 munist Party of China to bring about a happy life
 for the people.  The wages system of our country also
 serves this general aim.
 Wages are the main income of workers and staff.
 They have a direct bearing on their personal interests.
 As the conditions of the wages system will also in-
 fluence directly the development of production, trade
 union organizations have always paid close attention
 to the question of wages, treating it as an important
 part of their work.
 Socialist state-owned enterprises handle their
 wages problems according to the following two prin-
 ciples :
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 First, to raise the material and cultural standards
 of workers and staff on the basis of developing pro-
 duction, and at the same time the rate of increase in
 labour productivity must exceed the rate of increase
 in wages.
 Second, the state pays wages in a planned way
 according to the principle of "to each according to his
 work."  Hence, higher wages are paid to those en-
 gaged in skilled or heavy work.  Wages are higher
 in the important departments and enterprises in the
 national economy.  Workers who turn out the same
 amount of products of the same quality in the same
 length of time receive same wages irrespective of na-
 tionality, race or sex.
 The wages of workers in the old China were a
 mere pittance.  Equal work did not receive equal pay.
 And usually the wages received did not bear relation
 to their contributions.  And, what's more, there was
 ruthless feudal exploitation.  Workers lived like pau-
 pers without enough food and clothing and were
 always threatened by unemployment.  For instance,
 miners of the Kailan Mining Administration earned
 only 20 cents (pre-liberation currency) a day with
 1.6 hours' work.  And if they should die at work the
 owner of the mine gave only 20 dollars to their families.
 If a horse died, it was 60 dollars' loss.  So, before
 liberation, the life of a worker was worse than that
 of beasts.
 Since the establishment of the People's Republic
 of China, from 1950 onwards, trade union organiza-
 tions have helped the government and the manage-
 ments of enterprises in readjusting and reforming the
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 wages system. Trade union organizations at all levels
 took part in drawing up schemes for adjusting the
 wages of workers and staff, carried out propaganda
 and explanation work among them, and organized them
 to discuss and decide the wages scale, thus drawing
 the broad masses of workers and staff into the work of
 reforming the wages system.  Owing to the correct
 wages policy of the people's government and the Com-
 munist Party of China and the active help of trade
 union organizations, the wages reform gained the sup-
 port of all workers and staff.                                   The corrupt, chaotic,
 irrational and multi-grade wages system left over from
 the reactionary Kuomintang regime was completely
 changed.  A new wages system was introduced and
 the principle of "to each according to his work" was
 gradually put into practice. At present there are
 eight grades of wages for workers of state-owned en-
 terprises.                                          A different standard of wages is provided
 for each grade.  There are also extra pay and allow-
 ances.
 In the last few years the trade union organiza-
 tions have helped the managements of enterprises to
 replace the old piece-work wage system with a new
 one and enforce the merit system.  The old piece-work
 wage system was used by the capitalists before libera-
 tion to raise the intensity of labour, to lengthen work-
 ing time and to exploit the workers more.  They made
 use of this system to undermine the unity of the work-
 ing class and force the workers to work like slaves
 for wages which were hardly enough to keep them
 alive.

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 Our piece-work wage system has been set up by
 taking into account the introduction of new technique
 and the replacement of manual labour with machinery.
 Besides, piece-work wages are fixed for various kinds
 of products.  Every piece of extra work is counted.
 Therefore more work means more pay.  Trade union
 organizations also do what they can to help the man-
 agements of enterprises to take measures to raise the
 cultural and technical level of the workers and to help
 the workers to fulfil or overfulfil their quotas.
 According to the statistics of the seven industrial
 ministries for September 1955, wages paid on piece-
 work rate already exceeded 40 per cent of the total
 wages paid out in all enterprises under these minis-
 tries.
 Besides, all enterprises have set up various merit
 systems : there is the system of rewards for saving
 coal on the railways and there is the system of re-
 wards for safety in operation in departments of power
 industries.  On the basis of the suggestions of the
 trade unions, the Government Administration Council
 promulgated the "Provisional Regulations on Awards
 for Inventions, Technical Improvements and Ration-
 alization Proposals Concerning Production" which
 enabled some 135,600 workers and staff to receive
 material rewards in 1954.
 With the participation of the trade unions, the
 government and managements of enterprises made pro-
 visions of wages, allowances and subsidies for those
 working under exceptional conditions : women work-
 ers who have to take time off breast-feeding their
 babies during working hours receive full pay; workers

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 who work in conditions harmful to the health get
 health allowances; workers who work in remote places
 also receive special allowances; when the production
 of enterprises is suspended either because of natural
 conditions or because of management problems, work-
 ers also get allowances.  When a worker is transferred
 he gets travelling expenses and allowances for moving
 or making arrangements for the family.
 With the development of production the real wages
 of workers and staff have been steadily rising over
 the years.  According to the statistics of five industrial
 ministries, the average money wages of workers and
 staff in 1952 was 66.20 per cent higher than in 1950.
 During the period of the First Five-Year Plan the
 average money wages of workers and staff in the whole
 country will increase by 33 per cent.  According to
 the plan, the average wages of the workers and staff
 in 1955 would be 20.5 per cent higher as compared
 with 1952.
 With the development of the national economy,
 4,220,000 more workers and staff are needed in the
 period of the First Five-Year Plan.  So more people
 will be employed.
 In addition to gradually raising the wages and
 the number of employed persons, the state has made
 vigorous efforts to stabilize commodity prices, or-
 ganize various welfare facilities, extend the scope of
 labour insurance, expand the health and medical ser-
 vices, increase funds for cultural and educational
 work, in order to constantly better the cultural and
 material life of the workers and staff.  Consequently

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 the life of our workers and staff has improved a great
 deal since liberation.
 In China, labour protection is a fundamental
 policy of the state manifesting its concern to see that
 the workers and staff members work under healthy
 conditions and are provided with safety measures. As
 mass organizations of the working class, China's trade
 unions also pay full attention to this work. The Trade
 Union Law of the People's Republic of China provides
 that it is the duty of trade unions to ensure that the
 managements or employers effectively carry out the
 regulations and directives concerning labour protec-
 tion and the standards and regulations concerning
 safety devices and factory sanitation.
 The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has
 set up a Labour Protection Department which gives
 directions to the trade union organizations at different
 levels on how to improve labour protection ; it also
 investigates and studies the safety and health condi-
 tions in various enterprises, submits proposals for
 labour laws and helps to popularize knowledge of
 safety devices and industrial health.  The principal in-
 dustrial unions and the principal provincial and munic-
 ipal trade union organizations have also set up sec-
 tions concerned with labour protection work. Primary
 trade union organizations have committees to look
 after labour protection, and groups of workers elect
 one of their number to act as labour protection in-
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 spector.  By 1955, 1,630 primary trade union organ-
 izations had set up labour protection committees and
 50,303 groups had labour protection inspectors.
 During the period of the rehabilitation of the
 national economy immediately after the liberation, the
 trade unions led the workers to make an extensive in-
 vestigation of safety and sanitary conditions. A great
 many defects and shortcomings were corrected in,the
 various establishments throughout the country, and
 the extremely dangerous and bad working conditions
 began to disappear.
 Since 1953 the key problems concerned with im-
 proving safety devices and health facilities, such as
 ventilation, cooling, control of dust and poisonous
 fumes, electricity safeguards, etc. are being tackled
 in the various industrial enterprises. In many textile
 mills, iron and steel works and machine-tool factories,
 the previous high temperatures have been gradually
 reduced and machinery has been installed to lighten
 labour.  In the state-owned collieries, over forty-five
 per cent of coal is cut by combines, mechanical coal-
 cutters or pneumatic picks and the rest by electric or
 pneumatic drills or blasting with explosives; more
 than 80 per cent of traction on the working face and
 the underground haulage roadways is mechanized.
 In 1954 the Ministry of Labour laid it down that
 industrial enterprises, in drawing up their annual
 financial plans, should work out industrial safety mea-
 sures for labour protection and allocate a specific sum
 for the improvement of working conditions in the
 enterprises.  The trade unions signed agreements with
 the managements to enable them to supervise and en-
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 sure the enforcement of these measures and to see that
 the working conditions were systematically improved.
 The trade unions co-operate with the manage-
 ments in educating the workers on safety questions
 and instructing them on the working of safety devices
 and safe methods of work.  In many industrial cities,
 the government and the trade unions have jointly ar-
 ranged lectures on industrial safety and health and
 held exhibitions of labour protection.  With a view to
 studying and popularizing advanced experience in
 labour protection, the All-China Federation of Trade
 Unions has opened permanent exhibitions.
 In connection with the plans for improving work-
 ing conditions, the trade unions pay particular atten-
 tion to the training of specialized personnel in labour
 protection.  The  All-China  Federation  of  Trade
 Unions, as well as the industrial ministries, industrial
 unions and the provincial and city governments, has
 set up training classes on this subject.  Up to the end
 of 1954 about a thousand persons had received train-
 ing.                                  In 1955, 4,726 persons were trained in 26 classes
 established by the provincial and city authorities and
 industrial unions.
 Thanks to the effort made by the trade unions,
 managements, governmental bodies and the workers
 themselves, working conditions in the enterprises
 throughout  the  country  have  steadily  improved.
 Casualty figures in industry for 1953 were 5.8 per
 cent lower than 1952 and for the period between
 January and September 1:;54, there was a further de-
 crease of 17 per cent over the corresponding period of
 1953.

 Before liberation the Chinese workers generally
 worked twelve hours a day and some as long as 16-18
 hours, seven days a week.  Since liberation the law
 protects the working people's right to rest.  Now vir-
 tually all enterprises are operating an eight-hour day,
 and in branches particularly injurious to the workers'
 health, a six-hour day is enforced.  Women workers
 are given special consideration.  "Equal pay for equal
 work" is provided by law.      Expectant mothers are
 given light work.  They are entitled to 56 days'
 maternity leave with full pay.  Larger enterprises
 have set up creches, and in workshops where there are
 many women workers, special hygiene rooms are set
 aside for women.  There is no longer any child labour
 in state-owned factories and mines.
 Labour insurance forms part of the government's
 labour policy that expresses the state's concern for
 the welfare of the working people.  It is one of the
 measures the state has adopted to improve the mate-
 rial and cultural life of the workers and to develop
 the productive forces.
 In the old China, there was no such thing as labour
 insurance for the workers, and they had to manage
 as best they could in times of childbirth, old age,
 sickness, death, injury and disability.  Many women
 workers dared not marry for fear they might have a
 child and be dismissed.

 Since liberation the government has paid great
 attention to labour insurance work.  But as early as
 December 27, 1948, Northeast China, which already
 had been liberated, had its Provisional War-time
 Labour Insurance Regulations for State-owned Enter-
 prises.  After the nation-wide liberation, the people's
 government promulgated in February 1951 the Labour
 Insurance Regulations of the People's Republic of
 China. Since then the labour insurance programme
 has been put into effect on a national scale and en-
 forced in such enterprises as railways, water transport,
 posts and telecommunications and factories and mines
 employing 100 or more workers.  In enterprises with
 less than 100 workers, labour insurance may be nego-
 tiated between the management and the trade union
 representing the workers. Amendments to the Labour
 Insurance Regulations were made on January 2, 1953,
 which extended its scope and increased the benefits.
 September 20, 1954 witnessed the birth of the
 Constitution of the People's Republic of China.  This
 Constitution reinforces the Labour Insurance Regula-
 tions.                                         Article  93  of  the  Constitution  provides :
 "Working people in the People's Republic of China
 have the right to material assistance in old age, and
 in case of illness or disability.  To guarantee enjoy-
 ment of this right, the state provides social insurance,
 social  assistance and public health services and
 gradually expands these facilities."
 The rise in the living standard of our workers is
 not only shown by increases in their actual money
 wages.  For one thing, 12 per cent of the total pay-

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 roll of the enterprise is appropriated for labour in-
 surance benefits.
 Every year more and more people become eligible
 for labour insurance benefits.  From 600,000 in 1949
 the number increased to 5,550,000 by the first half of
 1955, an increase of 9 times in the space of 6 years.
 Our Labour Insurance Regulations apply to all
 workers and staff members without exception who are
 employed in enterprises covered by these Regulations,
 regardless of their race, nationality, age or sex.  The
 Regulations provide that all the labour insurance ex-
 penses should be borne by the managements or own-
 ers of the enterprises.  The workers and staff mem-
 bers do not pay any contributions whatsoever.
 The whole administration of the labour insurance
 programme is handled by the trade unions, which have
 established organizations at all levels in which the
 workers themselves are drawn into the administration.
 The Labour Insurance Department and the Collective
 Labour Insurance Administration Bureau of the All-
 China Federation of Trade Unions direct labour in-
 surance work nationally and give guidance for the
 operation of such communal labour insurance establish-
 ments as sanatoria and rest homes throughout the
 country.  In the municipal and provincial trade union
 organizations and industrial union organizations there
 are special departments and personnel to take charge
 of labour insurance work.  Trade union committees in
 factories and mines, as a rule, have set up committees
 or appointed representatives to do the actual labour
 insurance work-they pay out the labour insurance

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 benefits and also organize mass campaigns for pre-
 venting and reducing sickness and injury.  .
 Our labour insurance benefits cover illness, injury,
 death, maternity benefits and old-age pensions.
 A worker who falls sick or is injured outside his
 work can be treated free at the medical institutions
 of the enterprise where he is employed.  During treat-
 ment, for a period of up to six months he receives a
 sick benefit of between 60 to 100 per cent of his wages,
 depending on the length of time he has been employed
 in the enterprise.  In the case of medical treatment
 exceeding six months the allowance paid is equivalent
 to 40-60 per cent of his wages.  Priority in sanatoria
 or rest homes is accorded to convalescents or those
 who are constitutionally weak.
 In the case of injury sustained at work, the total
 cost of treatment, medicines, hospitalization, meals at
 the hospital and travelling expenses involved is borne
 by the management or owner of the enterprise. Wages
 must be paid as usual throughout the period of treat-
 ment.  If the worker becomes disabled, he is paid
 according to the degree of disablement, an invalid bene-
 fit equivalent to 60-75 per cent of his wages until such
 time as he regains his ability to work or until his
 death. If he is partially disabled but is still able to
 work, he gets, apart from his wages, a monthly invalid
 allowance equivalent to 10-30 per cent of his previous
 wages.
 Women workers are entitled to a total of 56 days'
 maternity leave with full wages.  In the case of a
 difficult delivery or the birth of twins, the mother is
 entitled to an extra 14 days also with full wages. Ex-

 penses for pre-natal examinations and child delivery
 are borne by the enterprise.  In the case of childbirth,
 a woman worker or the wife of a male worker receives
 a small maternity benefit which is increased in the
 event of twins, triplets, etc.
 Male workers upon attaining the age of 60 who
 have worked for 25 years, including 5 years in their
 present post, and women workers on reaching the age
 of 50 who have worked for 20 years, with 5 years in
 their present post, may retire with a monthly old-age
 pension of 50-70 per cent of their wages.  Retired
 workers are still entitled to medical treatment at the
 clinic or hospital of the enterprise where they used to
 work.  Workers who are eligible to retire but continue
 to work receive, in addition to their normal wages,
 an allowance equal to 10-20 per cent of their wages
 according to the length of time they have worked in
 the enterprise. By the end of June 1955, there were
 37,000 workers enjoying old-age pensions.  The state
 has also established homes for the aged workers who
 have no family of their own.  All the expenses for
 such establishments are borne by the state.  There
 are at present 15 such homes in the country for the
 aged and permanently disabled.
 In the case of the death of a worker, his family
 dependents receive considerable material assistance
 from the state.  When a worker or retired worker
 dies from sickness or injury not sustained at work,
 his immediate dependents receive a funeral benefit
 equivalent to two months' average wages.  In addi-
 tion, they receive a relief benefit equivalent to 6-12
 months' wages according to the number of his depen-

 dents.  Greater material assistance is given to the
 family dependents of a worker who dies while at work
 or after retirement in consequence of disablement re-
 sulting from injury sustained at work. To begin with,
 the family dependents receive a funeral benefit equiv-
 alent to 3 months' average wages.  In addition, they
 are allowed a monthly pension ranging from 25 to 50
 per cent of the deceased's previous wages according to
 the number of the dependents.  The pension is paid
 until such time as the dependents no longer have the
 status of dependents.  A funeral allowance of one-
 third to one half of the average monthly wage is also
 paid in the case of the death of a family dependent of
 a worker.
 The number of sanatoria and rest homes establish-
 ed by trade unions with labour insurance funds has
 been increasing from year to year.  By the end of
 June 1955, there were 126 such establishments in the
 country with 15,930 beds.  In addition, primary trade
 unions in factories and mines have set up 1,500 sana-
 toria (including sanatoria where the workers go in
 their spare time) with 38,000 beds. A total of 335,-
 000 workers had used these sanatoria and rest homes
 by the end of June 1955.
 8.  Women Workers
 The trade unions of China have always paid great
 attention to the problems of women workers.  In the
 All-China Federation of Trade Unions as well as local
 trade unions of all levels and the industrial unions,

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 women's departments have been set up.  Where there
 are women members, the primary trade union organi-
 zations have formed committees or made a com-
 mittee member responsible for dealing with the
 special problems of women workers.     The duties
 of the committee or committee member are : to
 carry through, in co-ordination with the various de-
 partments of the trade union concerned, the policies
 and decrees of the Party and the government concern-
 ing the protection of women and children; to show
 women that their emancipation can only be gained
 through their own efforts ; and to keep in close contact
 with the women workers in order to know and reflect
 their needs and to help them solve their personal dif-
 ficulties.
 Before liberation, Chinese women workers had no
 rights whatsoever, politically, socially or in any other
 respect. In many cases they did the same kind and
 amount of work as men but were paid only half or
 two-thirds as much.  They also found it very difficult
 to find a job, and were liable to be dismissed due to
 pregnancy or childbirth.
 Since the founding of the People's Republic of
 China, the rapid rehabilitation and development of
 the national economy has afforded tremendous oppor-
 tunities to women to obtain employment.  In the first
 half of 1955 there were already two million women
 workers in the country.  "Equal pay for equal work"
 is guaranteed by law.    Many women workers have
 been promoted to managerial positions.  In 1953,
 1,569 women workers were promoted to responsible
 posts in various enterprises; and in 1954, 2,397 were

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 promoted to administrative or technical positions.  By
 the end of 1954, more than 32,400 women workers
 had been promoted to leading or responsible jobs dur-
 ing the five years since liberation.
 Women workers of the new China are displaying
 great enthusiasm for work and a new creative spirit
 in the country's socialist construction.  Many ad-
 vanced workers have been developed.  According to
 a national survey in 1954, more than 11,600 women
 workers were elected by primary trade union organiza-
 tions as model workers and distinguished work-
 ers, and over 20,200 as advanced workers.
 Women workers have made an outstanding con-
 tribution in the construction of our country, and have
 brought about a change in the old scornful attitude
 to women's work.  Many women workers have been
 elected as people's deputies, including eighteen as rep-
 resentatives to the First National People's Congress.
 Under the Labour Insurance Regulations, women
 workers not only enjoy the same privileges as men,
 they are also entitled to certain special welfare bene-
 fits.                                  Up to 1954, more than 2,200,000 women work-
 ers and wives of workers throughout the country had
 received maternity benefits.
 To protect the health of mothers and their babies,
 special canteens, rest rooms for expectant mothers
 and baby-feeding rooms have been set up in factories
 and enterprises and special buses provided to take
 expectant mothers and mothers with young babies
 to and from work.  By the first half of 1955, 901
 hygiene rooms had been set up in factories, mines

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 and enterprises throughout the country for women
 workers.
 Before liberation, illiteracy among women work-
 ers was very widespread, in some areas even reaching
 a hundred per cent.  Since liberation, women workers
 have been taking an active part in spare-time literacy
 classes in the factories. In the first quarter of 1955,
 over 470,200 women workers were studying in spare-
 time literacy classes throughout the country.  In addi-
 tion, a large number of women workers entered work-
 er-peasant short-term secondary schools and colleges.
 9.  Workers' Family Dependents
 Work among the workers' families is an important
 branch of our trade union work.  The organizing of
 the wives and families and uniting them around the
 trade union, and so helping to raise their political
 consciousness, goes a long way towards helping the
 workers in their work.
 Before liberation, the Chinese workers were re-
 garded as having no rights and the women members
 of their families particularly had to put up with all
 kinds of indignities.  As the workers only received
 very small wages while commodity prices rose several
 times a day, the workers' families were continually in
 great difficulties.
 With the liberation, the working class became the
 masters of the country, and with the growth in pro-
 duction, the workers' life improved considerably.
 Their real wages increased, and, in addition, the Labour
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 Insurance Regulations promulgated in 1951 provided
 material assistance to them in the case of birth, old
 age, sickness, death, injury and disability.  The Reg-
 ulations  also  provide that members  of workers'
 families also enjoy free medical treatment, and have
 to pay only a half of the cost of medicine.
 While the living standards of the workers' families
 improved, so their political status was raised and their
 cultural life improved.  The Constitution of the Peo-
 ple's Republic of China provides that women enjoy
 equal rights as men politically, economically, and in
 cultural and family life.  Three hundred and ninety
 members of coal miners' families in various parts of
 the country were elected as county, municipal and
 provincial people's deputies.  The wife of a lathe
 turner in Shenyang was elected as deputy to the Na-
 tional People's Congress.                                         A large number of work-
 ers' wives attended spare-time schools organized in
 the areas in which they lived or in the enterprises
 where their husbands were employed.  The trade
 unions also helped them organize self-study groups.
 Up to the first half of 1955, 100,813 working-class
 housewives had taken part in literacy classes.
 The trade union clubs use various ways to at-
 tract the workers' families to take part in cultural
 activities.  For example, they organize lectures on
 political and current affairs and talks on the essentials
 of maternity hygiene, hold exhibitions and discussion
 meetings, form reading and literacy groups and put
 on film-shows, etc.  After completing their studies,
 many housewives took up jobs.  For example, 2,960
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 working-class housewives were found jobs in Tientsin
 in 1951.
 To enable housewives to study and take up work,
 the trade union organizations have helped them to set
 up creches and nurseries of their own where their
 children can be looked after.  According to a survey
 made in 1954, there were 1,228 creches in various
 parts of the country run by workers' families, where
 more than 28,900 children were cared for.
 The housewives are not concerned only with im-
 proving their own lives, they also take part in work
 for the benefit of society.  Many have formed or-
 ganizations for improving sanitary conditions.  As
 these improved, so the amount of sickness decreased
 considerably.  They also organize mutual-aid groups,
 which look after workers' wives or other relatives who
 are ill, so that the workers can go to work with an
 easy mind.  In the first half of 1955 there were 23,464
 such mutual-aid groups in the country with over 231,-
 400 members.
 10.  Finance Work
 According to the Constitution  of the Trade
 Unions of the People's Republic of China trade union
 funds are derived from the following sources:  (1)
 Admission fees of new members.  A new member pays
 an admission fee equal to one per cent of his total
 wage of the month previous to his admission; (2)
 Membership dues.  Each member pays regularly one
 per cent of his monthly wage as membership dues;

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 (3) Proceeds from cultural and sports activities spon-
 sored by the trade unions; (4) Allocations by the
 managements or owners of enterprises in accordance
 with the Trade Union Law, under which the manage-
 ment or the owner of an enterprise must allocate to
 the trade union two per cent of the total payroll every
 month.
 In the last few years, as a result of the develop-
 ment of national construction, there has been a con-
 tinuous expansion of the trade union membership and
 a rise in the level of wages, which means that the
 trade union funds have also increased.
 The income of the trade unions is used to serve
 the members and to improve production.  It is mainly
 used for the following purposes: (1) To pay for mass
 cultural work.  This includes expenses incurred in
 running spare-time schools for the workers, training
 trade union activists, sponsoring recreational and
 spare-time artistic activities, buying books, showing
 films and general propaganda work.  (2) To pay for
 sports activities.  This includes expenses incurred in
 the purchase of equipment and articles necessary for
 the workers and their children to carry on sports
 activities, in the holding of sports competitions, train-
 ing of sportsmen and propaganda work.  (3) As
 material assistance given to the members. This in-
 cludes allowances to members who are in difficulty,
 subsidies allocated to the mutual-aid savings organiza-
 tions, nurseries and young pioneers' summer camps.
 (4) For trade union's administration, including wages
 for trade union officials, administrative expenses and
 expenses incurred in the organizational work of the

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 trade union (e.g. the holding of membership meet-
 ing, etc.)
 The administration costs take only a minimum of
 the trade union funds, the major part of which is
 used to enhance the cultural life of the members.  In
 1955 the administrative expenses of all trade unions
 in the country amounted to 30.2 per cent of the com-
 bined income and a continuous drive will be made to
 reduce this proportion in the future.
 11.  Living Conditions
 The Chinese workers' living conditions were ex-
 tremely poor before liberation.  Most of them lived in
 squalid sheds. In working-class districts there was
 no sanitation to speak of : the air was foul and there
 was neither piped water nor a sewerage system.
 Epidemics were frequent and the mortality rate was
 high.
 Since liberation the people's government has built
 large numbers of workers' houses.  In 1952 they built
 houses enough to accommodate one million families.
 In 1953 and 1954, houses with floor spaces of 12
 million and 13 million square metres were constructed
 respectively for the workers.  According to the First
 Five-Year Plan for Development of the National
 Economy, in the five-year period (1953-57), the govern-
 ment will build workers' houses with a total floor space
 of 46 million square metres.   Apart from the housing
 construction financed by the government, a lot has
 been done by trade union organizations to help im-

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 prove the workers' living conditions.  For instance,
 they arranged for the workers to build their own
 houses with government loans.  In this way in 1955,
 houses were built for 15,954 railway workers' families,
 covering 417,984 square metres of floor space.
 Rents are now much lower than they were before.
 In pre-liberation days workers used to pay 30-50 per
 cent of their income in rent. In addition, they had to
 pay 3-12 months' rent on deposit.  Nowadays rents for
 government-financed houses take up only about 5 per
 cent of their wages.
 The people's government pays considerable atten-
 tion to the workers' ever-increasing demand for con-
 sumer goods.  After liberation it applied itself first
 of all to the stabilization of commodity prices.  Since
 1955, the government has carried out a planned supply
 of grain, edible oil and cotton cloth, with the result
 that speculation was rooted out, the stability of prices
 fully established and the livelihood of the whole body
 of working people safeguarded.
 Meanwhile the government has expanded the pro-
 duction of light industry and agriculture in due pro-
 portion to the development of heavy industry, so as
 to satisfy the workers' material needs which are
 growing with the steady increase in their wages.  In
 addition, the government has extended the network of
 department stores, retail shops or consumers' co-
 operatives in factories and mines and the workers'
 residential areas.
 Before liberation there were hardly any canteens
 in the factories.  The workers had to take their meals
 in the open air or by the side of the machines. Things
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350005-9
 are quite different today.  Every factory and mine
 has its own canteen or dining hall built and equipped
 at the expense of the management, who also subsidizes
 them.
 The wages of most workers before liberation were
 so low that they were hardly sufficient to provide the
 bare necessities of life.  Since liberation, however,
 their life has been improved enormously.  With a
 steady increase in production has come a steady rise
 in the workers' wages.  They not only live much bet-
 ter than before but are able to save out of their earn-
 ings.  The savings of the workers and staff members
 of the Shenhsin Textile Mill in Wusih, for example,
 amounted to 193,900 yuan in 1952, increasing to 514,-
 600 yuan in 1955.
 A small number of workers with little skill, with
 too many mouths to feed, or who have run into un-
 expected troubles, however, still have financial diffi-
 culties.  Allowances  are  made  to  these  workers
 according to their actual circumstances, from relief
 funds financed by 20 per cent of trade union member-
 ship dues, part of the labour insurance funds and 5
 per cent of the enterprise's premium funds.
 There are mutual-aid savings associations under
 the control of trade union organizations, from which
 workers can get interest-free loans.  By the end of
 1954, 28,000 primary trade union organizations had
 established their own savings associations.
