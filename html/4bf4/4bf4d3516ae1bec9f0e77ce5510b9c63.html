 Italy's Government Crisis:   A Tentative Prognosis
 Italy's political crisis has a long way to run, and
 any predictions of its outcome are necessarily specula-
 tive.  Analysis of the power relationships between and
 within the principal parties, however, brings one point
 into sharp relief:   there is little prospect that the
 Italian Communists can be denied a significantly larger
 n1~A  _ mow..-.   '34, --L   -----                     -
 This assessment rests on two key assumptions:
 -- The Socialist Party will be unable to re-
 solve the internal differences and other
 problems that prevent it from joining
 the Christian Democrats in a non-Communist
 government.
 -- The crisis is likely to lead to an election
 that will not appreciably-alter relative
 party strengths.
 Electoral Stalemate
 Most political leaders are not enthusiastic about
 an election.   The Christian Democrats, however, insist
 that the 1976 election gave them a mandate to keep the
 Communists out of government, and they show no sign of
 yielding to Communist demands for Cabinet posts.   Com-
 munist Chief Berlinguer remains convinced that to ac-
 cept less would leave his party in the same politically
 exposed position it occupied under Prime Minister
 Andreotti, when the Communists were pledged to support
 the government in Parliament but had only a consultative
 role in policymaking.   Only the Socialist Party could
 break this deadlock--by forming a majority with the
 Christian Democrats--but the Socialists are unwilling
 to do so if the Communists are left free to criticize
 from the opposition.   These factors make an early elec-

 Election forecasting is more art than science in
 Italy, where opinion polls are seldom accurate measures
 of voter sentiment.   Moreover, some observers believe
 the outcome might be different if the contest is held
 after the European Parliament election on 10 June rather
 that before; specifically they believe the Socialists
 would have a somewhat better chance if the Euro can vote
 occurs first.   But most responsible   timates
 predict that whenever national elections are held, the
 Communist vote would fall by a few points--but not below
 30 percent--and the Christian Democratic tally would
 rise slightly--but would remain around 40 percent.   Es-
 timates on the Socialists vary, although hardly anyone
 says they would score large gains.  Most observers be-
 lieve they would hold their own--9.6 percent in 1976--
 or gain slightly.  Many Socialists, however,  fear they
 25X1
 Of the seven smaller parties that in 1976 took about
 18 percent of the vote, the Christian Democrats could
 not construct a workable alliance with the rightwing or
 leftwing extremists, who might attract as much as half
 this vote.  The remaining small parties probably could
 not win enough to give the Christian Democrats a majority
 without either Socialist or communist support.
 Thus, a new election will almost certainly confirm
 the predominance of the two major parties, leaving the
 Christian Democrats with essentially the same options
 they have today.
 Divided Socialists
 But as the current lineup suggests, the Christian
 Democrats' basic problem is not arithmetical.   It is a
 political problem that centers on the failure so far of
 the Socialists to establish themselves as a reliable
 alternative to the Communists.
 The Socialists occupy what seems to be a fatally
 ambivalent position.  Even though they were allied with
 the Christian Democrats in the government from 1963 to
 1974, they have never been able to break clear of the

 Communists, with whom they share power in local govern-
 ments representing about half of Italy's population.
 To some extent, the ambivalence reflects concern that
 too exclusive an association with either major party
 would lead to the Socialists' absorption or demise.   It
 also mirrors a deep and historic split in the party be-
 tween those who view the Communists as their natural
 allies and those who are willing to work with the Chris-
 tian Democrats.
 Socialist Chief Craxi is in the latter category.
 He seemed during the last year to be giving his party
 new vitality, primarily by rallying Socialists around
 the one theme on which they could all agree--Socialist
 "autonomy."  He hoped that, given enough time, this
 policy would allow him to broaden the party's electoral
 appeal, distinguish it more clearly from the Communists,
 and lay the basis for renewed cooperation with the Chris-
 tian Democrats.
 But Craxi's efforts had gained no real momentum
 when Berlinguer broke with the Andreotti government last
 month.   Berlinguer's move deprived Craxi of the time he
 needed and forced the Socialists once again to choose
 between the Communists and the Christian Democrats--an
 agony they were spared by the inclusion of all three
 parties in Andreotti's parliamentary majority.   Since
 then the divisions in the Socialist Party have resurfaced,
 and Craxi has been forced to adopt the sort of contra-
 dictory stance that has always undermined socialist
 credibility--claiming Socialist "autonomy" on the one
 hand while asserting on the other that the Socialists
 cannot join an  government from which the Communists
 are excluded.
 Berlinguer has thus already achieved one of his
 goals in bringing Andreotti down; he has demonstrated
 how little tangible progress Craxi has made and shown
 that the Socialists are still too weak for the Christian
 Democrats to lean on.   Craxi's hand would be strengthened
 in the highly unlikely event of a sharp rise in the So-
 cialist vote, say to about 14 or 15 percent.  Even then,
 however, the Socialists would almost certainly want some
 arrangements ensuring that the Communists would share
 any blame for unpopular government decisions.   So when

 SE     -
 the dust settles, the Christian Democrats will probably
 still have as their only alternative to Berlinguer a So-
 cialist Party that sa s it will not enter the government
 without him.
 Outlook
 There are three possible outcomes to the current
 crisis:
 -- Communist entry into the government.
 -- A Communist return to the opposition.
 A compromise solution that denies the
 Communists Cabinet seats but gives
 them a substantial and increased voice
 in policymaking and implementation.
 If the Christian Democrats retain their plurality
 in an election, they will almost certainly have done so
 by relying once again on a tough anti-Communist campaign.
 They are therefore likely to emerge with the same dilemma
 they have today: in need of Communist cooperation but
 pledged to keep the Communists out of the government.
 This dilemma is likely to be compounded by deep divisions
 in the Christian Democratic: Party over how far to go in
 bargaining for Communist support.
 It might appear that the Communists could simply
 force their way in, using the party's labor muscle and
 its apparent ability to cause widespread economic dis-
 ruption.   But it will not be that easy.   The Communists
 are highly skilled at choosing issues with which to pres-
 sure the government, but they must be careful not to
 throw their weight around in ways that damage their re-
 sponsible image--one of the main factors behind the Com-
 munists' strength and their broad appeal.
 In fact, these constraints on the Christian Demo-
 crats and Communists are likely to give the smaller
 parties some leverage even if they perform poorly in an
 election.   Thus the election would not signal an end to
 political maneuvering.

 Approved For Release 2006/038FzRE3A-RDP79T00912A001700010010-0
 The only result that would slice through all these
 complications--and bring the Communists immediately into
 the government--would be one that featured minor party
 losses large enough that the Christian Democrats would
 have no alternative to a coalition with the Communists.
 But that would require a greater polarization of the
 electorate than seems likely at this point.
 Political leaders will thus probably find themselves
 once again in search of a formula that allows the Com-
 munist Party to claim it is part of the government and
 the Christian Democrats to claim it is not.   It will be
 more difficult to find such a formula this year, however,
 because the Communists have been convinced by experience
 that such midstream status poses too many political risks.
 If Berlinguer again agrees to something less than
 Cabinet seats, he will almost certainly insist on strict
 guarantees that Communist advice be solicited--and be
 verifiably heeded--on nearly all policies.   Such a pack-
 age might include "technician" ministers associated with
 the Communist Party, Communist membership on some sort
 of formal committee charged with managing economic policy,
 and a precedent-shattering Christian Democratic agreement
 to form coalitions with the Communists in some key local
 governments.   In short, Berlinguer would have to be able
 to say--convincingly--that he stood on the verge of Cabi-
 net status.
 Despite their distaste for such an agreement, the
 Christian Democrats are likely to see it as the least
 objectionable path because the only remaining option--
 allowing the Communist Party to go into opposition--
 would probably merely lead the Christian Democrats in
 a circle.   They would have to turn for a majority to
 the Socialists, who would probably be more inclined to
 follow the Communists into opposition, leaving the Chris-
 tian Democrats once again at Berlinguer's door.

 NATO:   The Transatlantic Dialogue
 NATO's West European members pressed for a greater
 US commitment to a "two-way street" in arms purchases
 at last week's continuation. of the transatlantic dialogue.
 The allies are still dissatisfied with the level of
 American purchases of West European weapons and defense-
 related goods and are urging Washington to make a major
 deal soon.  Reflecting a decision of the Independent
 European Program Group (IEPG), the West Europeans asked
 Washington to supply them data on US purchases of West
 European supplies during fiscal years 1974-77, in order
 to support their contention that such purchases have
 been decreasing.
 The allies object to US insistence that West European
 products be economically competitive with US goods in
 order to qualify for defense contracts.   On the contrary,
 the West Europeans stress that access to the US market
 is es    tial if their arms industries are to be competi-
 tive.
 The allies resent what they consider to be Washing-
 ton's roadblocks to Western Europe's attempts to win US
 defense contracts.  They claim that the United States
 fails to take transportation costs into account when com-
 paring bids, thus widening the disparity between prices
 of US and West European products.   In addition, they
 complain that US quality standards exceed those of
 Alliance standardization agreements, the provisions of
 which are supposed to be reciprocal.   This poses problems
 for West European firms seeking subcontracts from a US
 prime contractor.
 The West Europeans view US authorization to grant
 exemptions from provisions of the "Buy American" act as
 a positive step and hope that this law will not be
 applied to collaborative West European programs.  The
 IEPG now wants the United States to exempt West European
 carriers from re ulations discriminating against non-US
 competitors.  1                         -1

 An IEPG ad hoc group has accepted an Italian pro-
 posal for Alliance-wide development of a medium-range
 (50-2,000 meters) antitank weapon.   This reflects earlier
 IEPG approval of a US outline on specific weapons families
 and cooperative arrangements that might promote cost
 efficiency and avoid duplication under the Long-Term
 Defense Plan.   The system the Italians have proposed
 would be a West European product and would be the first
 of a family of third generation antiarmor munitions.
 The United States would be expected to take the le
 developing a long-range system.
 In related developments, NATO's Conference of
 National Armaments Directors has made known its intention
 to act as a forum for proposals designed to encourage
 standardization and interoperability of military equip-
 ment.  Moreover, in the wake of the Klepsch Report pre-
 sented to the European Parliament last June, the European
 Community has recently begun to grapple with the "two
 way street" issue.   Klepsch had suggested that the Com-
 munity's machinery could be used to organize and structure
 the industrial aspects of armaments production.

 European Communist Reactions to the Sino-Vietnamese-
 Kampuchean War
 Each of the three leading European Communist parties--
 the Italian, the French, and the Spanish--has staked out
 a position on the Indochina conflict designed to balance
 disapproval of the Chinese attack on Vietnam with previous
 positions on Kampuchea and., at the same time, to preserve
 an image of independence from the Soviets.   The parties
 resolved these conflicting pressures in three different
 ways.   All three are enmeshed in domestic issues, and
 the Italians in particular have shown sensitivity to
 rank-and-file opinion in the construction of party po-
 sitions.
 Wars between Communist states present doctrinal
 problems that complicate the standard considerations
 arising from the invasion of one country by another.
 How is it that Communist states can go to war?  Are all
 sides concerned really "Communist"?  What are the limita-
 tions of sovereignty for Communist parties and the states
 within their jurisdiction?  While the positions of Euro-
 pean Communist parties--particularly the French--sometimes
 came close to Moscow's especially on the Chinese invasion,
 they never really coincided.   Italian and Spanish Com-
 munist leaders compared the recent fighting to the 1968
 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia, thus reminding
 the Kremlin that Europeans are still a  lying the lessons
 of that event.
 The Italian Communist Party
 The Italian Communist Party (PCI) faced a dilemma:
 it admires Vietnam and disapproves of Pol Pot, but it
 also deplores armed intervention.   Its first public
 statements--reflecting a position that was arrived at
 too hastily, according to an editor of L'Unita--came
 out in favor of the "liberation" of the Kampuchean
 people from the Pol Pot - Ieng Sary group.   Italian
 Communists acknowledged Vietnam's role in the conflict,
 but the Kampuchean people themselves were said to have

 Approved For Release 2006/03/lliYITA-RDP79T00912A001700010010-0
 borne the brunt of the struggle.   Romano Ledda, PCI
 Director of International Studies, wrote in L'Unita that
 the fall of Pol Pot must have been brought about from
 within; otherwise Vietnamese support would have been
 even greater.   Ledda went out of his way to criticize
 China for having driven Hanoi into the arms of the USSR,
 but his support for Vietnam was not unconditional; he
 insisted that the question of national sovereignty re-
 mains fundamental,  implying that Vietnam should not use
 its position to crush Kampuchean independence.
 An editorial in L'Unita on 10 January dismissed as
 "hypocritical" the criticism m of Vietnam and the USSR by
 extreme leftists and rightists.   L'Unita urged its read-
 ers to seek "rational" rather than "ideological" answers
 to the problem.   It then went on, however, to wrestle
 with some of the ideological problems posed by a war be-
 tween Communists--and wound up using US "im erialism"
 as a handy safety valve.
 When popular liberation movements transform them-
 selves into states, the editorial argued,  "contradictions"
 can develop as a result of national aspirations, histori-
 cal considerations, and the unequal and unjust distribu-
 tion of resources.  Asserting what it touted as an "in-
 dependent" PCI position, L'Unita stated that disagreements
 between Communist parties are serious, but it quickly
 added that the "strategies and hypocrisies" of the Carter
 Administration are just as serious.   Indochina is a prob-
 lem, asserted the editorial, but it should not distract
 people from the main problem--US imperialism.
 PCI maverick Lombardo Radice, in the 16 January
 L'Unita, stressed that the PCI should not have held back
 criticism of Pol Pot until he was ousted.   Radice de-
 scribed the fallen regime as a "military" distortion of
 Communism warped by years of struggle against imperial-
 ism.                          He compared Phnom Penh's excesses to those of the
 Red Brigades and suggested that much bloodshed could have
 been avoided if Pol Pot's aberrations had been pointed
 out in time.  Noting that most Communist regimes have
 had periods of difficult government transitions, Radice
 argued that Czechoslovakia might have provided a peace-
 ful example, but "we know all too well how and by whom
 that peaceful change of political line was halted."

 the position "that no one should look on Kampuchea as a

 of its position on interventionism.   The party condemns
 both attacks "by countries claiming to be socialist,"
 although it continues to criticize the Chinese attack
 on Vietnam more heavily than the Vietnamese invasion
 of Kampuchea.   An implication of the PCI stance may be
 that plans for more formal, contacts between the PCI and
 Chinese Communist Party will be postponed, but not can-

 The French Communist Party
 There is no evidence of any vacillation in the
 French Communist Party (PCF) line.   The PCF, whose for-
 eign policy often parallels that of the CPSU,  has come
 closer to Moscow on this issue than either of the other
 parties.   A December PCF - Portuguese Communist Party
 communique stressed both parties'  "solidarity with the
 Vietnamese people."  After a 19 February meeting between
 Sergio Segre and Maxime Gremetz, heads of the foreign
 sections of the Italian and French parties, both sides
 expressed concern over China's attack on Vietnam and
 the resulting threat to peace.   (An earlier meeting be-
 tween Segre and Socialist Party chief Mitterrand had
 resulted only in a note of shared concern at developments
 in the international situation,  "with special reference
 to Indochina.")
 In January, the PCF clearly supported the overthrow
 of Pol Pot, charging his regime with extreme brutality.
 L'Humanite editor Yves Moreau, noting that the Chinese
 had stopped mentioning Pol Pot and Ieng Sary, questioned
 whether Beijing had given up on them.   "Did they not
 govern in fact by methods of arbitrariness and terror
 more than those used in Beijing by the Gang of
 Four?  .  .    ."
 Moreau went on to claim that changes in Phnom Penh
 were a relief for the Khmer people, putting an end to
 tension between Vietnam and Kampuchea.   The PCF, like
 the CPSU, has all but ignored the guerrilla war bein
 carried out by the Khmer Rouge.                                            25X1
 Even before the Chinese attack on Vietnam, party
 leader Marchais warned that French Communists would
 condemn any Chinese aggression in Southeast Asia.   Speak-
 ing over Radio Monte Carlo on 9 February, Marchais stated
 that serious differences exist between his party and the
 Chinese (at no point did he refer to the Chinese leaders
 as Socialist or Communist).  After listing the French
 party's complaints about Chinese support for NATO, Eu-
 ened to revive the anti-Vietnam war movement.

 Once the Chinese attack started, however, the French
 began to show signs of restraint, perhaps in reaction to
 the initially cautious Soviet comment.   The 20 February
 L'Humanite published the text of a Chinese statement
 discussing the possibility of withdrawal from Vietnam
 and an article demanding that such action be immediate.
 The PCF called again for the resurrection of the antiwar
 movement, but its message to Beijing was more of a plea
 than a threat:   "When we should be jointly fighting

 along the path of their national and social liberation--

 it is particularly painful and unjustif
 socialist country to attack another.  .  .  .
 The Spanish Communist Party
 During the months preceding Vietnam's invasion of
 Cambodia, the Spanish Communist Party (PCE), weak in
 votes and stong in criticism of the USSR, concentrated
 on the Spanish election campaign.  At first, Spanish
 Communists simply declared that the Vietnamese-Kampuchean
 conflict, still in its festering stages, should be set-
 tled through negotiations.   Those who fought against US
 imperialism, the party maintained, sh uld be able to
 settle their differences peacefully.
 The PCE, like the PCI, deplored Khmer Rouge abuses
 and considered the rapidity of Pol Pot's fall to be evi-
 dence of his lack of popular support.  Unlike the PCI,
 however, the PCE expressed reservations soon after the
 new Kampuchean Government came to power.   "Nobody for-
 gets the example which the Vietnamese people showed the
 world when confronted with imperialist aggression, but
 what cannot be justified :is the use of weapons and ag-
 gression as a means of resolving disputes between social-
 ist states" (Mundo Obrero, 9 January).   Pol Pot, despite
 his abuses, was a .Socialist.  Vietnam, despite its record,
 was an aggressor.
 Beyond this, the PCE worried about the Soviet role.

 Russian and Chinese revolutions as well.                                 25X1
 `The PCF also took a hard line, claiming that the
 United States clearly had connived, in the attack and
 afterward had tried to justify it.  Yevgeniy Babenko of
 TASS emphasized the French position under its heading
 "Who Supports Aggression"?  According to Babenko, the
 PCI spoke of US sympathy for and understanding of Beijing
 PCE leader Carrillo himself denounced "China's in-
 vasion of Vietnam."  At a meeting in Sestao, Carrillo
 expressed his indignation at a people who struggled for
 decades against US imperialism being attacked by those
 "who call themselves" Communists.
 The official PCE communique (20 February) condemned
 China, but only in the context of previous condemnations
 of Vietnam's role in Kampuchea and the USSR's in Czech-
 oslovakia.   The PCE stressed this latter point as it
 called Yugoslav President Tito and Romanian President
 Ceausescu, two Communist leaders actively concerned
 about interventionism, to bring the Sino-Vietnamese war
 to the attention of the UN.
 The American Connection and the Soviet Response
 The PCE was the strongest in its condemnation of
 the US role in the Chinese invasion.  A 20 February
 Mundo Obrero editorial affirmed that Washington not
 only knew of the Chinese attack well in advance--probably
 having had Chinese intentions confirmed during Deng
 Xiaoping's (Teng Hsiao-ping) visit to the United States--
 but actually desired it.   The United States, it charged,
 considered China's action to be punishment for the US
 defeat in Vietnam.   The PCE alleged that the logic of
 the situation, if carried to the extreme of a Sino-Soviet
 conflict, might serve the Americans as revenge for the
 and US connivance in the attack as an expression of
 bourgeois hatred for the socialist community.   TASS made
 no mention of the Spanish statement of 20 February.
 The USSR did not approve of parties that connected
 one invasion with the other.   To do so, according to the
 Soviets, was to make the situation of the aggressor equal
 to that of his victim.   On 23 February TASS clearly showed
 how the Soviets viewed Western Communist positions.   The
 PCF was included in a list of those parties that had

 made special statements condemning China.   Italy was
 only mentioned through the Segre-Gremetz meeting, where
 the communique made no mention of Kampuchea.   The PCE,
 having connected Indochina and Czechoslovakia, was not
 mentioned at all.
 Beyond expressing its approval or disapproval in
 such ways, the USSR might use the Indochina conflict as
 an excuse to renew pressure for a worldwide conference
 to excommunicate China and reaffirm the principle of
 proletarian internationalism.   Such a move would find
 no more favor in Madrid or Rome than previous attempts
 to call such a gathering.   French Communists would prob-
 ably resent the move as well, since any hint of acceptance
 of such an idea would aggravate splits in a party already
 involved in a serious'      debate about its doctrinal and po-
 litical future.

 Norway:   The Politics of Oil
 Norway's surplus oil revenues clearly have been a
 bonanza for the Norwegian economy, but they have also
 brought on a host of unforeseen problems.   The governing
 Labor Party finds itself championing a tough austerity
 program while the nonsocialist opposition parties--which
 have long had to take a back seat--have benefited from
 the government's apparent inability to manage the new
 source of wealth, now 10 percent of the state's income.
 There is strong multiparty support for the use of oil
 revenues to underwrite economic development, but sharp
 party differences over the means and specific goals seem
 certain to tax the minority Labor government's staving
 power in the months ahead.                                                  25X1
 The Norwegian Government,  in the first years after
 the discovery in 1969 of oil and gas deposits in the
 North Sea, borrowed heavily in anticipation of future
 oil income to finance an elaborate social welfare system.
 The government's timetable for repayment, however, was
 knocked askew by exaggerated predictions about oil pro-
 duction and revenue, expensive delays in exploration,
 and massive cost overruns at offshore platforms.  More-
 over; heavy expenditures were made to bail out ailing
 companies and industries.   The net result was to inflate
 wages and the demand for imports at home and reduce the
 competitiveness of Norwegian goods abroad.   By mid-1978,
 Norway's foreign debt reached $15 billion  equal to 30
 percent of its gross national product.                               25X1
 The Labor Party has survived two national elections
 and a change of leadership during this time, but has
 seen the Conservatives make steady gains in popular sup-
 port.  Prime Minister Nordli, who has led the government
 since 1973, last year instituted a tough austerity pro-
 gram of wage and credit restraints to redress Norway's
 failing ability to compete.  A prime objective is to
 bring about structural changes to the Norwegian economy
 through the gradual elimination of subsidies.   So far,

 the effort, which is overwhelmingly backed by the
 Norwegian public, seems to be working.   Labor and indus-
 try organizations, however, are critical of the govern-
 ment's approach and opposition parties have threatened
 to block implementing legislation.
 Development Strategy
 The Labor government's attempts to work out a com-
 prehensive plan for using the oil revenues have been
 complicated by its reliance on a small leftwing Social-
 ist party to maintain its one-vote margin in Parliament.
 Until recently this has not been a serious problem, since
 the nonsocialist parties have been in general agreement
 with Labor's program.   The Conservatives, however, are
 obviously emboldened by recent gains in opinion polls
 and have begun to criticize Labor for blaming external.
 factors--international economic developments--for Norway's
 economic problems.
 In January, in a move that nearly caused the gov-
 ernment to collapse, the Conservatives were instrumental
 in blocking a long-term swap of Norwegian oil for Swedish
 technology--the Volvo deal--despite earlier pledges of
 support.  Under the terms of the multifaceted deal ne-
 gotiated by the Norwegian state oil company and Volvo,
 Norway agreed to supply Sweden with oil in return for
 timber over a 20-year period.   The Norwegians were also
 to get a 40 percent share of the automobile company,
 while Volvo would receive oil exploration rights.   The
 Labor government had hoped the deal would serve as the
 cornerstone of its oil development-modernization scheme,
 but the agreement ran into strong opposition in both
 Sweden and Norway.   It was finally jettisoned before
 coming to a vote in Parliament, which the government
 was certain to lose.
 The opposition from the Conservatives, who found
 themselves aligned with the leftist Socialists on this
 particular issue, underscores the growing importance
 of the various parties' economic development philosophies
 in the disposition of the oil revenues.   The Labor Party,
 along with a substantial number of Conservatives, be-
 lieves that a continuous process of structural economic
 adjustment is necessary to preserve the Norwegian way

 of life.   They advocate a "moderate" tempo of oil de-
 velopment with extensive state participation and with
 the profits plowed into industrial modernization.   In
 contrast, the smaller parties--including the leftist
 Socialists--and some Conservatives believe that little
 real change is needed.   These groups would go slowly
 on current oil exploitation, severely restrict future
 oil development, and use the revenues to preserve agrar-
 ian and small town interests.   They are especially
 worried that the growth of an industrial society will
 undermine traditional Norwegian values.
 The Labor government is determined to press ahead
 with industrial development, but will probably have to
 back off somewhat from such major undertakings as the
 Volvo deal.   The Conservative-led opposition is not
 against increased Nordic cooperation, but it does be-
 lieve that cooperation will. develop naturally and need
 not be forced by the government.   For the Conservatives,

 Canada:    Tory Victory Seems Certain in Alberta Election
 F7                            I
 Premier Peter Lougheed has called the voters of
 resource-rich Alberta to the polls on 14 March in an
 election certain to return his Progressive Conservative
 (Tory) government to power for the third straight time.
 The Tories could even fulfill their campaign slogan--"79
 seats in 79"--and win every seat in the legislature.
 Albertans enjoy a privileged position in the Canadian
 federation--they not only earn more than the national
 average, but they pay the lowest taxes in the country--
 and Lougheed's vigorous efforts to protect this position
 are expected to be as potent an electoral platform this
 time around as in 1975.
 Lougheed is also wooing the voters with major new
 spending programs.   Last month he:
 -- Gave the municipalities $1 billion
 (Canadian dollars) to help ease the debts.
 -- Said the province would subsidize low-
 interest mortgages for low-income families
 at a cost of about $200 million per year.
 Announced an expanded program to help
 handicapped citizens.
 Opposition parties--Social Credit, New Democratic
 Party, and the all-but defunct Liberal Party--criticize
 these spending programs as insufficient and outline
 further spending plans of their time.   The opposition
 will exploit what it sees as Lougheed's insensitivity
 to social policy issues as well as his slowness in di-
 versifying Alberta's economy.   Any inroads opposition
 spokesmen make will not be enough to overturn the Tory
 majority.
 Lougheed's campaign will center on his call for
 "strong leadership" to defend Alberta's constitutional

 rights, natural resources and, as a corollary of natural
 resources, the Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund.   On
 these three subjects, Lougheed's attitude is that of the
 beleaguered pioneer with his wagons drawn into a circle
 to fight off marauders.   It stems from his belief--
 widespread in the Canadian west--that Ottawa runs the
 country for the benefit of the populous, vote-filled
 center (Ontario and Quebec), and would not hesitate to
 sacrifice Alberta's interests thereto.  And Alberta has
 hefty interests:   nearly 85 percent of Canada's oil and
 gas and some coal deposits.   Lougheed is heavily backed
 by Alberta's lar   and powerful oil interests in his
 reelection bid.   e
 Recent disputes between Alberta and Ottawa involve
 oil pricing and gas export policies.  Alberta wants to
 export more gas and bring the price of domestic oil up
 to world prices.   Ottawa wants to be sure there are suf-
 ficient gas reserves for Canada before authorizing addi-
 tional exports and to delay agreed oil price hikes as
 part of its fight against inflation.  Compromises are
 in process on both these issues.
 Prime Minister Trudeau said on 23 February that
 Canada would allow exports of as much natural gas as
 the National Energy Board declares surplus--2 trillion
 cubic feet, potentially available for export in the next
 four to eight years according to findings published last
 week--a step that will please gas producers and will
 also earn Canada some needed foreign exchange.  Alberta
 had already agreed to delay the oil price rise due last
 January for six months, a move designed to show its
 concern for national problems and to undercut any incip-
 ient federal moves to make Albertan intransigence an
 issue in the coming federal election campaign.
 Although Lougheed enjoys the head-on bargaining
 that these disputes entail, he wants to ensure a strong
 hand.   To this end, he insists at such forums as federal-
 provincial constitutional conferences that any new con-
 stitution must include provincial control over resources
 and refuses to accept any wording that would erode Al-
 berta's prerogatives in this area.   In February, at the
 latest constitutional conference, only Alberta and Que-
 bec (whose separatist government has no interest in
 promoting constitutional reform) would not agree to a

 constitutional formulation that would make clear that
 resources fall under provincial control except in cases
 of "compelling national interest."  Alberta insists that
 the affected provinces must be involved in all decision-
 making about resources with no exceptions.   To charges
 that this strong regionalist stand damages the Canadian
 confederation, Lougheed replies that Canada will be
 stronger if the regions are stronger.

 An integral part of the province's resources policy
 is the Heritage Fund.   Since early 1976 it has collected
 30 percent of Alberta's nonrenewable resource revenues
 and will accumulate between $10 billion and $12 billion
 by the early 1980s.   The Fund was set up to diversify
 the Alberta economy before the nonrenewable resources
 run out.

 Lougheed clearly distrusts the intentions of other
 Canadian leaders toward this huge nest egg and warns
 that "they're coming at us" to "get at the Alberta
 Heritage Savings Trust Fund one way or another."  While
 this protective pitch will appeal to the homefolks, op-
 position complaints on how the fund is administered will
 be harder to counter.  The opposition, and even some
 Tories, are unhappy that the fund is administered by the
 Cabinet without legislative approval and little oversight.
 And while the Tories have put money into new industries,
 such as petrochemicals, opposition critics say it is not
 enough.  Much of the money is now in short-term securi-
 ties because of the government's dilemma over how to
 invest such immense amounts of money without disrupting
 the provincial economy.
