 TENSION EASES AS OCCUPATION OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA CONTINUES
 Moscow has reduced somewhat the more blatant signs
 of its presence in Czechoslovakia and has toned
 down its press attacks on Czechoslovak leaders.
 There is no reason to believe, however, that the
 occupation will soon be ended.
 EASTERN EUROPE REACTS ADVERSELY TO SOVIET INVASION
 The USSR's invasion of Czechoslovakia has suspended
 the movement toward liberalization and freer national
 expression in Communist Eastern Europe.
 NATO RE-EVALUATES DEFENSE CONCEPTS IN A NEW CLIMATE
 The rapid occupation of Czechoslovakia has produced
 a new climate of apprehension in the Atlantic Alli-
 ance.   Reviews of NATO force levels and of the warn-
 ing time concept will be key elements in the ambi-
 tious September work program for Alliance committees.
 SWEDISH VOTERS TO CHOOSE NEXT GOVERNMENT
 The Swedish electorate on 15 September will deter-
 mine whether the Social Democrats, who have ruled
 the country for more than 35 years, will continue
 in power.   The alternative is a centrist coalition
 made up of the Liberal, Conservative, and Center
 parties.

 VIETNAM
 Enemy forces last week sustained pressure on second-
 ary targets, while other Communist units continued
 to maneuver in the vicinity of key urban centers.
 Allied sweeps and air strikes appear to have dis-
 located enemy attack plans in several areas.
 THAI OPPOSITION PARTY WINS INITIAL ELECTORAL SKIRMISH
 The government has lost the opening round in its
 electoral test of strength with opposition elements,
 but the setback may cause complacent Thai leaders to
 step-up preparations for next year's legislative
 elections.
 SUPPRESSION OF CHINA'S RED GUARDS GAINS SPEED
 The recent shift to the right in China's internal
 politics has brought terror to millions of Red Guard
 students as local authorities--mainly military men--
 are now going considerably beyond the disciplinary
 measures called for in Peking's recent propaganda.

 ARAB STATES REMAIN WARY OF NEW ISRAELI COUNTERRAID
 Jordan and Egypt are both still fearful that the
 Israelis will mount a heavy attack on their terri-
 tory.   The Arab League foreign ministers have assem-
 bled in Cairo to discuss their various problems, but
 the meetings will probably bring nothing more than
 the usual Arab squabbling.
 INTERNAL DISSENSION SPARKS RENEWED FIGHTING IN YEMEN
 The recent renewal of royalist attacks on Sana was
 encouraged by violent, armed dissension within the
 republican ranks.   Disunity is endemic among the
 republicans, and even though it has been damped down
 again, this latest manifestation may impel the re-
 publican government to renew efforts for a settlement
 of some sort with the royalists.

 Pravda and other authoritative Soviet newspapers warned during the
 week that a "counterrevolutionary" threat remained in Czechoslovakia and
 that the situation there was not yet "normalized." Moscow now claims its
 invasion was necessary to head off an "imperialist" plot aimed at disrupting
 the socialist world.
 The Czechoslovaks wondered how much Moscow will restrict their
 freedoms but nevertheless seemed of a mind to test the limits of acceptable
 behavior. There is, in particular, deep disquiet among journalists and intel-
 lectuals as censorship is reimposed and rumors circulate of plans to purge
 them.
 Rumania and Yugoslavia-particularly the former-are still worried that
 they are next on Moscow's list of victims. Both regimes are preparing their
 populations psychologically for such a possibility. Both also continue to
 maintain their military and security forces on an alert status, and the
 Yugoslavs are reported to be improving defenses along their borders with
 Bulgaria and Hungary.
 In Hungary, party leader Kadar is reported to be showing signs of
 strain. He is said to be deeply concerned about the negative effect of the
 Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia on his own image and on dissension
 within the party.
 The Czechoslovak affair has also deepened the factional splits within
 the Polish party. Gomulka's nationalist opponents, who were against Polish
 participation in the invasion, are probably intimidated by Moscow's show of
 strength. Gomulka's position has thus been bolstered for now, but at the
 cost of further isolating him within the leadership. The Soviet politburo-
 almost totally immersed in the Czechoslovak situation since the invasion-
 has begun to resume its normal activities. There is still no confirmation of
 the rumored central committee plenum on 2 September, and the activities
 announced for various politburo members and party secretaries durine that
 day make it seem unlikely that one actually took place.

 TENSION EASES AS OCCUPATION OF CZECHOSLOVAKIA CONTINUES
 Moscow has reduced some-
 what the more blatant signs of
 its presence in Czechoslovakia
 and has toned down its press at-
 tacks on Czechoslovak leaders.
 Although this suggests that the
 Soviets are relatively satisfied
 with the present conduct of the
 Dubcek-Svoboda leadership., Pravda
 and other authoritative newspa-
 pers warned throughout the week
 that a "counterrevolutionary"
 threat remained and that the
 situation in Czechoslovakia had
 not "normalized."  As long as
 Moscow continues to insist that
 this is the situation, no sub-
 stantial reduction of the mas-
 sive military presence can be
 expected.
 In its press and in an ex-
 tensive series of diplomatic
 justifications of the invasion,
 Moscow has almost entirely
 dropped the fig leaf it used
 in the first days--that it had
 been invited in by unspecified
 Czechoslovak leaders.   Now, Mos-
 cow claims that it moved to head
 off an "imperialist" plot which,
 under the guise of "bridge-build-
 ing," aimed at disrupting the
 socialist world.   This line has
 the advantage of carrying a warn-
 ing to the other Eastern European
 countries that they too must be
 wary of improving relations with
 the West.
 Premier Cernik early this
 week reportedly expressed the
 view that the situation in Czech-
 Page   3
 osl.ovakia was still uncertain.
 It apparently remained unclear
 to him just how much the USSR in-
 tended to restrict the govern-
 ment's freedom of action.   By
 week's end, this ambiguity still
 seemed to exist in Czechoslovak
 minds.
 The Czechoslovaks, past
 masters at passive resistance,
 have apparently chosen to accom-
 modate themselves to the USSR's
 demands as slowly and ineffectu-
 ally as possible.   Some even
 seem to be of a mind to test the
 limits of acceptable comradely
 behavior.   Lidova Demokracie,
 the People's Party paper, sum-
 marized the situation by point-
 ing to the vicious circle argu-
 ment that the Soviet troops will
 not leave until the situation
 normalizes and the situation
 will not normalize until the
 troops leave.
 Party leader Dubcek con-
 tinued his quest for national
 acquiescence in the Moscow agree-
 ment.   In addresses to the cen-
 tral committee on 31 August--
 with its   preintervention com-
 position--he and President
 Svoboda indicated that the coun-
 try's liberalization would be
 severely curtailed.  Dubcek also
 said that he considered void
 the party congress held during
 the first week of the invasion.

 meeting,  action was taken to

 enlarge that body and also its
 presidium.   The changes resulted
 in both bodies retaining a pro-
 gressive majority, although politi-
 cal labels may now be somewhat
 meaningless.   Several pro-Soviet
 conservatives were dropped from
 the presidium.   In a separate but
 related action, Interior Minister
 Pavel, a strong Dubcek supporter,
 resigned, probably because of
 his difficulties with the Russian
 security forces.   His replace-
 ment, Jan Pelnar, seems to be
 something of an opportunist.
 During the week, the Rus-
 sians gradually turned back con-
 trol of various key buildings,
 such as party central committee
 headquarters, to the Czechoslo-
 vaks.       Other ministries, such as
 interior and defense, remained
 in Soviet hands.
 The occupying forces have
 also begun to return control of
 radio, TV, and the press to the
 Czechoslovaks.   The Russian ex-
 periment in producing occupation
 newspapers was short-lived be-
 cause of a public boycott.  Re-
 portedly the Czechoslovaks
 quickly perceived that at least
 one paper had been put together
 and printed in East Germany.
 Subsequently, the Czechoslovak
 regime's new censorship bureau
 issued broad guidelines that
 no "negative information and
 comment" concerning Moscow and
 its allies, or critical cor?unent
 on the party police, worker's
 militia, or army will be toler-
 ated.
 Although there have been re-
 ports that the USSR has a list of
 40,000 people to be deported, it
 does not seem to have acted on
 it.   Premier Cernik has reported
 that the government knew of only
 five persons--high-ranking secu-
 rity officials--who have been
 arrested.
 It is too early to put a
 price tag on the disruption to
 the Czechoslovak economy, but
 one estimate places the cost for
 the first ten days at about $25
 million per day.   The interrup-
 tion of transportation produced
 the greatest strain on the econ-
 omy, interfering                                                            with food sup-
 plies to the population, supplies
 of materials to industry and
 agriculture, and foreign trade.
 The Czechoslovak economy may re-
 quire as long as two years to
 recover from these economic dis-
 locations.
 One anticipated effect will
 be to tie Czechoslovakia's ex-
 ternal economic relations more
 closely than ever to the USSR and
 other Communist nations.   Pravda
 on 2 September warned the Czec-
 slovaks against seeking hard-cur-
 rency credits in the West and
 pointed out the advantages to
 Czechoslovakia of its relations
 with CEMA.   Economic negotiations
 reportedly will be held in Moscow
 the second week in September.
 Rumania and Yugoslavia con-
 tinued during the week to show
 fear that they might be the next
 target of a Soviet invasion.

 Rumanian leader Ceausescu,
 having previously made it clear
 in typical rhetoric that Rumania
 would forcibly resist foreign
 armies,  then soft-pedaled his
 remarks in the face of continued
 Soviet pressure tactics.   This
 "soft response" followed, how-
 ever, a Rumanian party resolu-
 tion condemning the Czechoslovak
 invasion and reasserting the right
 of national sovereignty.   Ceau-
 sescu thereby apparently hoped to
 preclude any future Soviet asser-
 tions that dissatisfied Rumanian
 officials had called in Soviet
 troops.
 On the internal scene, Ceau-
 sescu acted to prepare the Ru-
 manian population psychologically
 for any eventuality, including
 invasion.   He and other high-
 level party officials made speeches
 in different sections of the
 country, carefully chosen so that
 each speaker, by reason of ex-
 perience or by ethnic background,
 could make the maximum impact in
 uniting the traditionally Russo-
 phobic population behind the re-
 gime.
 Despite pressure from Moscow
 and some Eastern European coun-
 tries that it moderate its posi-
 tion, Yugoslavia continues to
 push its highly critical view of
 the occupation.   The Belgrade lead-
 ership, nevertheless, is plainly
 concerned by its inability to get
 a clear reading of Soviet inten-
 tions.                                 25X1

 move against hard-line remnants in
 Yugoslavia whom he believes are
 capable of collusion with the USSR.
 There has been little change

 EASTERN EUROPE REACTS ADVERSELY TO SOVIET INVASION
 The USSR's invasion of Czech-
 oslovakia has suspended the move-
 ment toward liberalization and
 freer national expression in Com-
 munist Eastern Europe.   Even as
 the Russians were suppressing
 the Czechoslovaks, however, they
 were also dramatizing for all
 Eastern Europeans the power and
 appeal of the Czech movement.
 Eastern European leaders who sup-
 ported Moscow's move now face the
 delicate task of justifying to
 nationalist elements within their
 own regime and to their own peo-
 ple an unacceptable premise--the
 necessity of subjugating national
 interests to those of Moscow.
 In the past year, a revolu-
 tion of expectation, reinforced
 by increasing signs of freedom
 in Czechoslovakia, has been under
 way in Eastern Europe.   Unlike
 the previous generation, which
 accepted authoritarianism with a
 resigned cynicism, the present
 generation expects a better life.
 This is especially true among
 the rebellious youth who will
 return to classes this month in
 a hostile mood following the
 events of August.
 The crisis has intensified
 differences within the polish
 leadership, and rifts in other
 Eastern European party hierarchies
 are expected.   Conservative ele-
 ments, emboldened by the display
 of Soviet force, may decide that
 the time is ripe to oust liberal
 reformists from their positions.
 In contrast, the unity of
 the Yugoslav and Rumanian leader-
 ships has been strengthened by
 their vocal opposition to the
 occupation of Czechoslovakia
 and by rumors--possibly self-
 inspired--that they might be
 next.  Although Tito and
 Ceausescu have aroused unprece-
 dented patriotic support, their
 realistic appraisals probably
 will lead them to less vigorous
 resistance to some Soviet
 foreign policy goals.
 Until Moscow signals how far
 it is prepared to go to impose
 its will, the atmosphere in East-
 ern Europe will remain tense and
 permeated with distrust, and
 policy making will be erratic.
 Most Eastern Europeans, leaders
 as well as led, while they may
 not for a time be able to ad-
 vance toward national independ-
 ence, have nevertheless developed
 more powerful anti-Soviet feel-
 ings as a consequence of Moscow's

 NATO RE-EVALUATES DEFENSE CONCEPTS IN A NEW CLIMATE
 The rapid occupation of
 Czechoslovakia has produced a
 new climate of apprehension
 within the Atlantic Alliance.
 The present NATO concept of warn-
 ing time, which presupposes a mil-
 itary build-up by a prospective
 attacker during which time the
 Allies would engage in political
 consultation, is being re-evalu-
 ate d.
 The West Germans are partic-
 ularly insistent on this,  con-
 tending that the demonstration of
 Soviet mobilization efficiency
 and speed makes the present NATO
 concept not only of doubtful va-
 lidity but also dangerous.   They
 point to the massive number of
 Warsaw Pact troops near the Ba-
 varian frontier and to the suc-
 cessful jamming of the early warn-
 ing radar system there.   The re-
 view of the warning time concept
 will be part of the September work
 program developed by NATO Secre-
 tary General Brosio in the wake
 of the Czechoslovak crisis.
 The Alliance's Military Com-
 mittee has recommended that any
 plans for reductions in troop
 strength should be held in abey-
 ance and that withdrawal of forces
 should be postponed.  Reactions to
 this proposal in the Defense Plan-
 ning Committee--which does not in-
 clude France, a nonparticipant in
 the integrated military command--
 revealed much disagreement.
 The Danes saw the proposal
 as merely an example of the "em-
 peror's new clothes."   Belgium
 and Canada opposed any decision
 that would require them to change
 their force reduction and rede-
 ployment plans.   West Germany,
 the United Kingdom, and the Neth-
 erlands wanted a strong public
 statement on the maintenance of
 Alliance force levels.   The dis-
 pute was apparently resolved by
 a statement of the committee on
 4 September which reaffirmed that
 NATO's military capability should
 not be reduced except as part of
 a pattern of mutual East-West
 force reductions balanced in
 scope and timing.
 National responses to Chan-
 cellor Kiesinger's vague reference
 to the need for a NATO summit con-
 ference have been universally un-
 favorable, but there is some in-
 terest in accelerating ministe-
 rial consideration of this month's
 re-evaluation program.  The United
 Kingdom is proposing that the De-
 fense Planning Committee and North
 Atlantic Council ministerial meet-
 ings, scheduled for December, be 25X1
 held in October or November; pre-
 liminary reactions have been fav-
 orable.

 SWEDISH VOTERS TO CHOOSE NEXT GOVERNMENT
 The Swedish electorate on
 15 September will determine
 whether the Social Democrats,
 who have ruled the country for
 more than 35 years, will continue
 in power.   The alternative is a
 centrist coalition made up of the
 Liberal, Conservative, and Center
 parties.
 Early opinion polls showed
 the combined opposition in a
 slight lead in the race for con-
 trol of the parliament's lower
 chamber.   The Czechoslovak drama,
 however, has muddied the political
 waters.
 The small but vigorous Com-
 munist party has matched Sweden's
 other parties in condemning the
 Soviet action.   It has been cul-
 tivating an image of liberalism
 and independence from Moscow for
 the past several years, but Swed-
 ish political analysts believe
 it will nevertheless suffer from
 the Czechoslovak affair.
 The Social Democrats have
 seen a small but steady erosion
 of their voter strength since
 1962.   In the last general elec-
 tion in 1964, they won 113 seats,
 the bourgeois parties 112, and the
 Communists eight.
 Facing the prospect of los-
 ing control--as have sister par-
 ties in Norway and Denmark--the
 Social Democrats have been scrap-
 ing around for popular issues.
 In particular, they have drummed
 away at the US involvement in
 Vietnam in an effort to win over
 radical youth elements, who ap-
 pear to be looking further to the
 left for political fulfillment.
 If the results are close,
 as is normally the case in Sweden,
 the Social Democrats may turn to
 some form of cooperation with the
 Communists to maintain their grip
 on the government.  A government
 formed by the bourgeois parties prob-
 ably would bring new changes in domes-
 tic policy but it might mute neu-
 tral Sweden's voice in interna-
 tional affairs.
 For the Social Democrats'
 Tage Erlander, prime minister for
 well over21 years, this appar-
 ently will be the last election,
 and for Sweden it will likely be
 the last nationwide balloting un-
 der a bicameral parliamentary sys-
 tem.   Constitutional reform pro-
 vides for a popularly elected uni-
 cameral legislature in 1970.  Min-
 ister of Education Olof Palme,
 who has bitterly attacked the US
 role in Vietnam, is generally con-
 sidered a leading candidate to
 succeed Erlander as head of the
 party.

 There was fresh evidence during the week that the Vietnamese Commu-
 nists intend to stretch out their current phase of military activity over a
 prolonged period. Newly captured documents tend to support other indica-
 tions that the enemy is carefully husbanding his capabilities by using econ-
 omy-of-force tactics to keep losses considerably below the high levels sus-
 tained during the all-out Tet push.
 Allied spoiling operations and air strikes have almost certainly upset the
 enemy's timing in some areas. Nevertheless, the Communists can be expected
 to punctuate their wide-ranging campaign of mortar and rocket harassment
 and ground probes in outlying areas with strikes against urban centers when
 they calculate that this can be done at relatively low cost.
 North Vietnamese Premier Pham Van Dong, in an otherwise unexcep-
 tional National Day speech, surfaced another variation in Hanoi's formula-
 tion of the role of the Liberation Front. He said that the US has to
 "recognize and talk" with the Front, but he omitted earlier demands that
 any postwar settlement must be in accordance with the program of the
 Front, or that the South Vietnamese had to be left alone to settle their own
 affairs. This is the second time in two months that Hanoi has tried at an
 authoritative level to signal some flexibility in its position on the Front.
 In China the drive against the Red Guards in the provinces continued to
 gain momentum and scope. The full weight of the mushrooming campaign,
 carried out mainly by local military commanders, is now being felt by
 millions of students who once were in the vanguard of Mao's Cultural
 Revolution.
 The long-ensconced military oligarchy in Thailand received a jolt last
 weekend when the opposition Democratic Party scored a resounding victory
 against government-sponsored candidates in municipal elections held in
 Bangkok. Even though the Democratic Party is Thailand's only truly na-
 tional party, its strength is largely centered in the Bangkok area; it is unlikely
 to do nearly as well in legislative elections next year. The overwhelming
 nature of the Democrats' Bangkok success, however, suggests more antigov-
 ernment sentiment than the Thanom government had bargained for when it
 finally unveiled Thailand's new constitution last June.

 Enemy forces last week sus-
 tained pressure on secondary tar-
 gets with a number of mortar and
 rocket attacks and ground assaults.
 Strong Communist units meanwhile
 continued to maneuver in the
 vicinity of many key urban cen-
 ters.   Despite widespread indica-
 tions that major attacks might
 occur against some of the primary
 urban targets during the week,
 however, no such attacks were
 forthcoming.
 There is considerable evi-
 dence that extensive allied pa-
 trolling, sweeps, and air strikes
 have thwarted enemy attacks plans
 in several key areas, notably
 around the Demilitarized Zone and
 in the Da Nang - southern I Corps
 sector.   An estimated 1,200 Com-
 munists have been killed in the
 outlying areas around Da Nang,
 for example,
 In III Corps, the extent to
 which allied sweeps have pre-
 vented Communist movements into
 attack positions near Sal on is
 not wholly clear.
 l
 an attack on the city has been
 delayed--suggesting that the
 enemy's attempt to screen move-
 ments along the infiltration cor-
 ridors from northwest III Corps
 have been hampered by allied
 sweeps and air strikes.   In the
 delta,)
 tallied
 sweep operations
 disrupted enemy
 25X1
 ;preparations
 ponement of
 and forced the
 strong Viet Cong
 post-
 at-
 tacks against Cai Lay and Can Tho
 cities.
 Except in a few areas--cen-
 tral I Corps, Duc Lap, and north-
 west III Corps--the Communists
 have withheld most of their main
 force regiments from the fighting.
 This has resulted in lower enemy
 casualties than in the Tet and
 May offensives.   Some 12,000 enemy
 troops were reportedly killed in
 the first 12 days of the May of-
 fensive, while enemy losses for
 the first 12 days of the recent
 fighting stand at about 8,500.
 There is little doubt, how-
 ever, that the Communists intend
 to press their offensive into
 key urban areas wherever their
 forces can get organized for
 strong attacks.   Sizable, and
 in many cases fresh, enemy units
 continue to threaten other known
 Communist objectives such as Ban
 Me Thuot and coastal cities in
 I Corps.   Based on the evidence   25X1
 now available, the Communists
 intend to wage a protracted of-
 fensive characterized by wide-
 spread shellings and attempts
 at ground assaults in and around
 key urban targets.

 Hanoi's National Day Celebrations
 Free of the threat of air
 attack, Hanoi this year cele-
 brated its national day more
 elaborately.  Public meetings
 were held over a three-day pe-
 riod, Ho Chi Minh made a cere-
 monial appearance, a special MIG-
 21 fly-by was staged, and Premier
 Pham Van Dong issued a strong na-
 tionalistic appeal for continued
 prosecution of the war.
 At overseas receptions the
 holiday was marred by intemperate
 speeches by Chinese representa-
 tives.   In Peking and Paris the
 Chinese belabored the North Viet-
 namese not only for the Paris
 peace talks but also for their
 support of Soviet intervention in
 Czechoslovakia.   Hanoi was not
 intimidated.  The premier di-
 gressed from his theme of Viet-
 namese nationalism to publicly
 reiterate the regime's support
 of the Soviet move.
 In other developments, the
 Vietnamese Communists are
 strongly pressing their claims
 to political control of the
 South Vietnamese countryside.
 A series of Hanoi broadcasts in
 the past week claimed that "lib-
 eration committees" and "rev-
 olutionary administrations" had
 been elected in the past few
 months throughout rural areas in
 the South.  Most of these ad-
 ministrative organs were said
 to be at the village and hamlet
 level, but the Communists also
 claimed to have established three
 provincial committees.  Generally,
 the new administrations are por-
 trayed as spontaneous develop-
 ments of the ongoing "general
 uprising" but, in some cases,
 Liberation Front participation
 is acknowledged.
 Beyond this propaganda, re-
 ports from South Vietnam indi-
 cate that strenuous Communist ef-
 forts to create and to maintain
 such new administrative organiza-
 tions have been under way for
 several months.   In addition to
 serving more immediate purposes,
 these bodies will provide the
 foundations at the grass-roots
 level for the eventual surfacing
 of a national political-legis-
 lative apparatus laying claim
 to extensive territorial control.
 Such an apparatus is a funda-
 mental part of Communist strategy
 for a future period of increased
 political competition with the
 Saigon government.

 THAI OPPOSITION PARTY WINS INITIAL ELECTORAL SKIRMISH
 The government has lost the
 opening round in its electoral
 test of strength with opposition
 elements, but the setback may
 cause complacent Thai leaders to
 step up preparations for next
 year's legislative elections.
 The opposition Democratic
 Party took 22 of 24 seats in the
 voting on 1 September for the
 Bangkok municipal assembly.   Three
 recognized government slates man-
 aged to elect only one progovern-
 ment candidate.   The election,
 the first meaningful one in Thai-
 land in ten years, was orderly
 and relatively clean, although
 some cases of government chican-
 ery were reported.
 Widely interpreted as an im-
 portant political barometer,  the
 results could have a significant
 impact on key legislative elec-
 tions scheduled for early next
 year.   The Democrats, the only
 nationwide opposition party cur-
 rently active, came out of the
 election substantially strength-
 ened.                         Out of the limelight for
 ten years and weakened by the
 recent death of their leading
 public figure,  the Democrats
 needed the psychological boost
 that the Bangkok victory gave
 them.
 Although the Democrats'  show-
 ing may also attract some other
 antigovernment elements to rally
 behind their banner, they have a
 long way to go before they can
 expect to challenge the govern-
 ment with any chance of success
 next year.   The party does not
 appear to have much following in
 the countryside, and it is clear
 that the Bangkok vote reflects the
 indecisiveness and complacency of
 progovernment forces as much as
 it does Democratic strength.
 The election is a major dis-
 appointment to those elements
 within the government who had hoped
 that a Democratic Party defeat in
 Bangkok, its traditional area of
 strength, would clear the way for
 an easy government victory in the
 legislative elections.  Moreover,
 the setback in Bangkok represents
 a repudiation of the municipal
 leadership that has been asso-
 ciated with Deputy Prime Minister
 Praphat and hence is a particu-
 larly bitter pill for the govern-
 ment faction centered around
 Praphat.
 One consequence of the elec-
 tion will be to strengthen the
 hand of Prime Minister Thanom in
 the factional wrangling with Praphat.
 The deputy prime minister is the
 only Thai leader actively organ-
 izing a political apparatus in the
 countryside, however, and he will
 have to play a key role in estab-
 lishing a unified government party.
 Although the turnout in the
 Bangkok election was low and local
 issues were important, the voting
 does suggest that there may be
 more antigovernment sentiment
 in the country than has been recog-
 nized heretofore.  The election
 results indicate that the govern-
 ment will have to put aside its
 squabbling and marshal its con-
 s=Lderable resources to guarantee
 a clearcut victory in next year's
 legislative elections.

 SUPPRESSION OF CHINA'S RED GUARDS GAINS SPEED
 The recent shift to the
 right in China's internal poli-
 tics has brought terror to mil-
 lions of Red Guard students, who
 just a short time ago were the
 apple of Mao's eye and a mili-
 tant instrument of the Cultural
 Revolution.   Local authorities--
 mainly military men who have long
 suffered verbal abuse at the
 hands of Red Guards--are appar-
 ently being given a mandate to
 deal harshly with them, and are
 exercising this prerogative with
 enthusiasm.
 Ithe first
 moves against radical Red Guard
 groups began early last spring.
 According to a Red Guard tabloid,
 military officials in Swatow or-
 dered "rebel" organizations to
 "lower their flags" on 6 April.
 One officer reportedly ordered
 his men to flog the radicals
 with leather whips, exclaiming,
 "Ever since March last year I
 have been humiliated by you.
 Now is the time for me to let
 off steam."
 Treatment of "1966 and 1967
 graduates"--older Red Guards who
 were kept in school so they could
 participate in the Cultural Revolu-
 tion--seems to be particularly
 rough, probably because they
 tended to be leaders of militant
 groups.  Aside from those who are
 specifically charged, many others
 are being treated as political
 criminals and sent to prison mines
 or military-run state farms under
 the pretext that they are bein
 iven " 'ob assi          "
 Iso-called "worker-
 propaganda teams," supervised di-
 rectly by municipal revolutionary
 committees, have been formed to
 occupy schools and to subdue re-
 maining Red Guard organizations.
 Army troops apparently are to
 lead the teams.  Teams as large
 as 10,000 have been formed in
 Harbin and Sian.
 In this emotional atmosphere,
 it is evident that plans tenta-
 tively considered in July to try

 3 September, the New China News
 Agency broadcast "situation re-

 ernments.   The new leaders are

 Jordan and Egypt are both still fearful that Israel will launch another
 major reprisal raid against them, and the terrorist bombings in Tel Aviv on
 Wednesday seem likely to provoke one. The Israelis are easily capable of
 mounting such an attack at any time, but at the moment are embroiled at
 the UN with their protest over Egypt's cross-canal raid. Firefights continue
 to occur daily, including a new series of exchanges along the previously quiet
 Syrian frontier.
 Libyan Prime Minister Bakkush resigned on 4 September and was
 replaced by Wanis Qaddafi after King Idris refused to accept Bakkush's
 suggestions for cabinet changes. Political power continues to reside in the
 King.
 The Organization of African Unity's (OAU) summit meeting in Algiers
 next week seems certain to have a number of sharply divisive issues on the
 agenda, foremost among them the Nigerian war, which the OAU is pledged
 to resolve.
 Nigerian federal authorities were finally persuaded this week to permit
 daytime relief flights to Biafra's starving refugees, although disagreement
 over which airfield to use may continue to delay the operation. The negotia-
 tions in Addis Ababa, however, are dwindling to an inconclusive end because
 the participants are preparing for the OAU summit conference. Federal
 troops are trying hard to complete the capture of remaining Biafran-held
 towns and airfields before the conference closes, but the determined Biafran
 defense makes this an unlikely prospect.
 Congolese Army leaders in Brazzaville have deposed President Mas-
 samba-Debat and installed one of their own number, but he in turn may be
 threatened by increasing dissension in the army and among tribal elements.
 South Africa's low-key and low-cost political and economic efforts with
 neighboring Black African ministates are paying off. On 31 August, Lesotho
 ordered South African political refugees out of the country, and last week
 Malawi laid out the red carpet for the visiting South African foreign minister.
 In Izmir, Turkey, the routine visit of several ships from the US Sixth
 Fleet is continuing without serious incident. Most of the ships are due to
 leave on 7 September. A leftist demonstration scheduled in Izmir this
 weekend could result in a new clash between rightist and leftist students, but
 the reinforced police should be able to prevent an  major dis-
 turbance.                                                              25X1

 ARAB STATES REMAIN WARY OF NEW ISRAELI COUNTERRAID
 Both Egypt and Jordan re-
 main fearful of Israeli repris-
 als in the wake of a new wave of
 Arab terrorist activity last
 month.
 Israeli Defense Minister
 Dayan threatened severe repris-
 als against the Egyptians last
 week after an Egyptian patrol
 crossed the Suez Canal, killed
 two Israeli soldiers, and kid-
 naped a third.  Dayan told a
 UN official that Israel consid-
 ered the incident the most se-
 rious "in any area" since the
 Egyptian sinking of an Israeli
 destroyer late last year.   He
 called on Cairo  to  fulfill a
 number of clearly impossible
 conditions by way of apology,
 a demand to which the Egyptians
 predictably failed to respond.
 Subsequently, Israel called
 for a meeting of the Security
 Council to protest the incursion.
 The Israeli airliner im-
 pounded by Algeria in late July
 was released on 1 September.
 If Israel is in fact planning a
 repris-al raid, this might remove
 a slight deterrent, but the Is-
 raelis would probably be inclined
 to wait until after the Security
 Council meeting before making a
 major assault.  Whenever it comes,
 the blow could fall with equal
 likelihood on Egypt or Jordan or
 both.
 The Jordanians   continue
 to believe that Israeli forces
 are poised to strike along the
 northern cease-fire lines and fear
 that Israel may push on to take
 the strategic heights in northern
 Jordan.  A new element was added
 when, for the first time in months,
 Syrian and Israeli units exchanged
 fire across their cease-fire lines
 twice during the past week.
 Meanwhile, the Arab League
 foreign ministers began their
 scheduled meeting in Cairo on 1
 September.    The Tunisian delega-
 tion immediately walked out, pro-
 testing that other representatives
 were trying to muzzle their views,
 The meeting is unlikely to pro-
 duce anything but the usual Arab
 pyrotechnics.

 INTERNAL DISSENSION SPARKS RENEWED FIGHTING IN YEMEN
 Factional fighting among the
 Yemeni republicans in Sana has
 encouraged  increased  royalist
 pressure against them.
 A long-standing cleavage be-
 tween supporters of Prime Minis-
 ter al-Amri and his group of sen-
 ior army officers on the one hand
 and those of the more radical,
 junior army officers--many be-
 longing to a minority religious
 sect--was renewed by open rebel-
 lion last week.   The  violence
 was triggered by al-Amri's de-
 cision to replace the army's
 chief of staff and three battal-
 ion commanders with his own sup-
 porters.
 The three dismissed command-
 ers believed that al-Amri was
 plotting to take over complete
 control of the army, and they
 ordered their troops to surround
 Sana airport, block the main roads
 leading out of the city, and seize
 army headquarters.   Fighting
 lasted three days before al-Amri
 brought it under control.  Mean-
 while, the royalists reportedly
 exploited the situation by shell-
 ing Sana severely with artillery.
 The republican factions
 have come to blows before, but
 this incident was by far the
 most serious.   Continued inter-
 nal difficulties may eventually
 persuade the republicans to in-
 tensify their efforts to reach

 ARMY TIGHTENS GRIP ON
 The dominant military men
 in Congo (Brazzaville), among
 whom opportunistic army chief
 Ngouabi is currently pre-eminent,
 have replaced President Massamba-
 Debat with one of their own num-
 ber and have promised changes in
 the country's institutions.  The
 army leadership is torn by per-
 sonal and tribal splits, however,
 and these moves may not have full
 approval from all top military
 leaders.
 Massamba's removal was pre-
 cipitated by the armed clashes
 that occurred last weekend when
 the army moved to disarm dissident
 youths in Camp Meteo, a paramili-
 tary installation near Brazza-
 ville.   The army overran the camp
 on 31 August after two days of
 bloody fighting.   The 23 Cuban
 military advisers in the camp
 apparently played no direct role
 in the fracas.  At the request of
 the army, they were transferred to
 the Cuban Embassy after the fight-
 ing and are scheduled to be sent
 home.
 Evidence is accumulating that
 the Meteo incident was rooted in
 ethnic animosities, and many of
 the dissidents apparently were
 tribal partisans of Massamba, who
 last month lost most of his au-
 thority to Ngouabi.  Massamba, who
 at first maintained an ambivalent
 attitude toward the clash, was
 placed under virtual arrest soon
 CONGO (BRAZZAVILLE)
 after the fighting began.  A com-
 munique issued on 4 August by the
 Ngouabi-dominated National Council
 of the Revolution (CNR)  "accepted"
 his resignation, blaming him for
 the fighting.  Capt. Raoul, a
 mulatto who became prime minister
 only last month, was designated
 acting president.
 Ngouabi, operating in the
 CNR and increasingly the para-
 mount power broker, has also de-
 creed major changes in civilian
 and military institutions.   He
 has revived a scheme to merge
 army and civil defense forces
 and has announced the restruc-
 turing of the single political
 party.  Executive organs of the
 party's ancillary youth, labor,
 and women's groups were sum-
 marily abolished.
 Ngouabi's ability to follow
 through on these changes and even
 to remain the Congo's predomi-
 nant leader hinges on the ten-
 uous cohesion of the army lead-
 ership.                                                                  There are indications
 that he is even now being chal-
 lenged by other army leaders,
 especially Defense Minister
 Poignet, to whom Massamba tried
 to turn over the presidency.  With
 Massamba out and some type of
 army-led regime seemingly unavoid-
 able, Poignet is apparently the
 man most acceptable to the French,,
 who continue to monitor Brazzaville
 developments closely.

 FIFTH OAU SUMMIT SHAPING UP IN ALGIERS
 The Organization of African
 Unity's  (OAU)  Council of Ministers
 began meeting in Algiers this
 week to determine the agenda for
 the fifth OAU summit which opens
 on 13 September.   In contrast to
 last year's meeting at Kinshasa,
 where the Africans purposefully
 achieved an image of unity and
 cooperation, this year's session
 promises to be one of the liveli-
 est and most divisive of recent
 years.
 The central issue of this
 conference--and the most divi-
 sive--is the question of the un-
 resolved Nigerian war, which the
 OAU last September took upon it-
 self to try to solve.  Despite
 strenuous efforts by Ethiopia's
 Emperor Haile Selassie as head of
 the OAU's six-nation Consultative
 Committee on Nigeria, he will have
 little progress to report.   The
 Emperor has been able to get the
 disputants to talk to each other--
 both at Niamey and at Addis Ababa--
 but no meaningful agreement has
 been achieved, even on relief meas-
 ures.   The Emperor,  in his report,
 may well suggest that his commit-
 tee be dissolved and that a new
 OAU body take over.
 The solid line-up of the OAU
 last year with the Nigerian Gov-
 ernment's position against Bi-
 afran secession has broken down.
 Four African states have recognized
 Biafra, others are wavering, Paris
 has "decreed" Biafra's right to
 self-determination, and world
 sympathy for Biafra has risen
 sharply.   The Biafrans, who have
 been working hard diplomatically,
 have enlisted Tunisia to carry
 their banner at Algiers.   Tunisian
 officials reportedly plan to get
 the issue on the summit agenda for
 "in depth" consideration and to
 insist that rebel leader Ojukwu
 be given a full hearing.
 The Nigerian federal govern-
 ment is working equally hard to
 keep the issue off the agenda and
 to prevent the appearance of the
 Biafrans.
 however,[:I_j a Biafran delegation
 will appear at Algiers and be ac-
 corded observer or similir status.
 The problem could be further in-
 flamed if any other African states
 recognize Biafra or if, as the
 French ambassador in Addis Ababa
 speculated recently, Paris decided
 to recognize Biafra before the con-
 ference convenes.   The issue may
 well provoke a walkout by the
 federal government delegation.
 The OAU will of course again
 laud the efforts of the libera-
 tion fighters of southern Africa
 and condemn the policies of the
 white-dominated states of Rhodesia,
 South Africa, and the Portuguese
 territories.  This  is  the  one
 main issue the Africans can unite
 on. This year, however, there may
 be a battle shaping up over control
 of the 11-member Tanzania-based
 African Liberation Committee (ALC),
 the OAU  committee  charged  with

 handing out funds and arms to
 the fighters.
 Several states would like to
 see the ALC out from under Tan-
 zania's wing, and to put further
 controls on the committee's ac-
 tivities.  Morocco, for one, has
 proposed that ALC membership be
 enlarged and that the chairmanship
 be a revolving one.  A further
 squabble may arise over recommenda-
 tions that the OAU withdraw its
 recognition of Holden Roberto's
 Angolan government-in-exile, a
 manifestation of the rising frus-
 tration many African leaders have
 with the debilitating effects of
 the several competing and quarrel-
 ing nationalist movements.
 Another issue, of lesser
 significance but perhaps no less
 divisive, may be a battle over
 the election of a new secretary
 general.  The incumbent--the con-
 troversial, free-wheeling Guinean,
 Diallo Telli--is running hard
 for re-election, but he has ir-
 ritated many states during his
 five-year tenure.  Many former
 French and British colonies are
 clearly opposed to him but, as far
 as is known, there is no consensus
 on a successor and he may be recon-
 firmed by default.
 The Arab-Israeli issue also
 seems likely to be raised.  This
 is always a difficult issue for
 many African states, both those
 who are sympathetic to Israel and
 receive Israeli technical assist-
 ance, and those who resent Arab
 interference in African affairs.
 African-Arab tensions have risen
 over the continued detention of
 former Congolese premier Moise
 Tshombe in Algiers, and the re-
 cent Algerian involvement in the
 Palestinian highjacking of an Is-
 raeli commercial aircraft.
 The OAU generally tries to
 steer clear of commenting on
 international issues not directly
 pertaining to Africa, and may
 still do so this time.  There is,
 however, some sentiment  for a
 condemnation of Soviet inter-
 vention in Czechoslovakia, and
 also of US actions in Vietnam.
 The Afro-Asian Solidarity Con-
 ference on Vietnam, being held
 in Cairo from 7 to 9 September,
 may well spill over to the Algiers

 Repercussions from the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia continued to
 dominate hemisphere events this week.
 The Chilean Radical Party, which issued only a lukewarm condemna-
 tion of the Soviet action, is coming under criticism from many political
 sectors. Two of its moderate candidates for the congressional elections
 scheduled for next year have withdrawn in protest over the party's absten-
 tion on the Chamber of Deputies' resolution expressing solidarity with
 Czechoslovakia. The party has since tried to retreat slightly from its first
 position.
 In Venezuela, Communist Party expressions of outright support and
 encouragement of the Soviet action have been muted by an apparent
 divergence within the party leadership over this issue and the possible
 adverse effect it might have on the electoral expectation of its front, the
 Union for Advancement. Some party leaders are fearful that too public and
 vocal a stance in support of the Soviets could seriously backfire against the
 party's chances in the December congressional and presidential elections.
 Non-Communist parties are already exploiting the Communists' dilemma. If
 the Communists criticize the Soviets, they risk losing their main source of
 financial support, but failing to do so could cost them a sizable portion of
 the 150,000 votes they expect to pull in December.
 In other developments, the military trial of David Knox, a British
 citizen charged with complicity in the invasion of Haiti last May, ended with
 a death sentence. President Duvalier, who had used the trial as a propaganda
 vehicle, has hinted that he will grant clemency.
 Argentine President Ongania's removal of General Julio Alsogaray as
 army commander-in-chief last week finally provoked a strong public reaction
 from the general. His statements stressed the seriousness of leaving Ongania
 on his own and removing from positions of power those who sought a return
 to democratic processes. Also ara 's protest Poses no th    o the regime,
 however.

 GUATEMALAN TERRORISTS THREATEN MORE VIOLENCE
 Only relatively minor inci-
 dents have occurred since the Com-
 munist Rebel Armed Forces as-
 sassinated Ambassador Mein last
 week, but the possibility of sig-
 nificant and even large-scale
 violence is strong.   The group
 has threatened continuing acts
 of reprisal until the government
 frees guerrilla leader Carlos
 Francisco Ordonez, alias "Camilo
 Sanchez," whose capture continues
 to be denied by officials.
 During the past week, sev-
 eral Guatemalan soldiers were
 injured when a mine exploded under
 their truck, and a firefight took
 place between police and suspects
 in the capital.  A fire at the
 army's central barracks and am-
 munition dump may have been sabo-
 tage, but there is as yet no clear
 evidence.   These and other events,
 however, become the source of many
 rumors which serve in turn to keep
 tension high.
 All parties represented in
 congress have joined in calling
 for the formation of a "national
 front against violence."   In mid-
 August, the ruling Revolutionary
 Party had invited "all sectors of
 society" to discuss the creation
 of such a front.  The target of
 that proposal, however, was right-
 wing terrorism, to which substan-
 tial numbers of the party's con-
 stituency had fallen victim.  The
 nominal support of the right-wing
 parties for such a front now,
 therefore, seems certain to founder
 upon the parties' deep antagonisms.
 The search for the ambas-
 sador's assassins continues with-
 out significant developments.
 Guatemalan authorities are con-
 sidering posting large rewards for
 information leading to the capture
 of any of the six suspects, whose
 pictures have been widely pub-

 ARGENTINA'S TOP GENERAL PROTESTS HIS OUSTER
 General Julio Alsogaray, in
 his first public statement since
 his removal as commander in chief
 of the Argentine Army on 26 Au-
 gust, strongly denounced Presi-
 dent Ongania and his policies.
 Alsogaray had been a focal
 point for a so-called "liberal"
 faction that had been urging the
 President to return the country
 to more representative govern-
 ment.   He failed to get support
 that he expected from other mil-
 itary critics of the government,
 however, and thus was unable to
 prevent his ouster.
 Three days after his removal,
 Alsogaray called in the press and
 issued a strong denunciation of
 Ongania and his policies.   He
 charged that the takeover was
 cause for "deep concern about the
 future course of the government"
 and that his replacement only a
 month before he was slated to re-
 tire as commander in chief con-
 stituted almost an affront toward
 the army as an institution.   He
 stressed the seriousness of re-
 moving from positions of power
 those who sought a return to dem-
 ocratic processes.
 Alsogaray's protest presents
 little real threat to Ongania, but
 the President has been known  to
 overreact to personal criticism.
 In this case, however, he is
 aware that many in the army agree
 with Alsogaray's statements, and
 he realizes that disciplinary ac-
 tion against the retired general--
 especially imprisonment, even for
 a short time--would cause a divi-
 sion in the military and ultimately
 enhance Alsogaray's image.  Fail-
 ure to discipline Alsogaray, on
 the other hand, might be inter-
 preted as a weakness on the part
 of Ongania.   In any event, Also-
 garay's open criticism of the Pres-
 ident will make it more difficult
 for the liberals still in the serv-
 ice to influence Ongania.

 ECUADOR'S PRESIDENT VELASCO TAKES OFFICE
 President Jose Maria Ve-
 lasco Ibarra announced the forma-
 tion of his fifth government on
 1 September.   He has indicated
 that a major goal of his admin-
 istration will be a shift in
 Ecuador's foreign policy toward
 a restoration of normal rela-
 tions with the United States.
 reportedly well qualified for
 the job, the appointees who head
 the crucial ministries of For-
 eign Affairs, Government, and
 Finance appear relatively in-
 experienced to cope with the
 difficult problems that now con-
 front Ecuador.
 Velasco's new cabinet of
 "national concentration" con-
 tains a disparate collection of
 rather young ministers--average
 age about 42--whose main charac-
 teristic is professed loyalty to
 the President and his as yet
 poorly defined program.   Ideo-
 logically, the new cabinet ap-
 pears nationalistic and left of
 center.   In addition to hard-
 core Velasquista ministers such
 as Agriculture Minister Pedro
 Menendez Gilbert, Guayaquil po-
 litical leader, it has one Lib-
 eral, Minister of Government
 Blasco Penaherrera Padilla, one
 ex-Conservative, Foreign Minister
 Rogelio Valdivieso Eguiguren,
 and three identifiable leftists.
 The US Embassy comments that
 as problems arise, some further
 cabinet changes may occur over
 the coming months, particularly
 if Velasco follows his past
 practice of ignoring or over-
 riding ministerial advice when
 making important policy decisions.
 Many of the new government's
 designees have already met with
 US officials to consider Ecuador's
 economic needs and to discuss
 differences over aid policies
 and seizures of US fishing ves-
 sels.  Velasco has indicated he
 hopes to improve US-Ecuadorean
 relations.
