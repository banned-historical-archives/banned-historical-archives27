 FACTIONALISM IN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE:
 MAO'S OPPOSITION SINCE 1949
 As the drama of Mao's Cultural Revolution has un-
 folded, Communist China's leaders have made available a
 vast amount of new information concerning earlier factional
 struggles within the Chinese Communist Party.   Making use
 of bred Guard materials and other new information that has
 been disclosed in the course of the Cultural Revolution,
 this Intelligence Report re-examines these earlier factional
 struggles and concludes that Mao's Cultural Revolution
 is a direct descendent of party conflicts and policy dif-
 ferences of nearly 20 years duration.

 FACTIONALISM IN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE:
 MAO'S OPPOSITION SINCE 1949
 Summary
 A fascinating by-product of the "great proletarian
 cultural revolution" has been the disclosure of new in-
 formation on factional struggles within the Chinese Com-
 munist Party since its rise to power in 1949.  The recur-
 ring nature of these struggles suggests that factionalism,
 carried on beneath a facade of unity, has been a continu-
 ing feature of party life in Communist China. The purpose
 of this paper is to reappraise the nature and extent of
 this phenomenon of factionalism in order to better under-
 stand the latest and most momentous of these factional
 struggles--Mao Tse-tung's "great proletarian cultural
 revolution."
 Red Guard disclosures have added a new dimension
 to our understanding of the first big struggle against
 factionalism in the Chinese Communist Party since it came
 to power--that waged against the Kao Kang-Jao Shu-shih
 "anti-Party alliance" in the years 1953-1955.   One aspect
 of the Kao-?Jao affair, it has now been revealed, was an
 effort to persuade Mao Tse-tung to give up one of his
 leadership positions,  to resign either as Chairman of the
 Party or the State  (almost certainly the latter.)   More-
 over, two of the main ingredients of the more recent
 phenomenon of "revisionism"--the stress on expertise and
 professionalism at the expense of political control,   and
 reliance on the Soviet model and Soviet support to promote
 China's economic development--appear to have been present
 in the Kao-Jao affair.
 It is ironic that the net effect of this first strug-
 gle against incipient "revisionism" was to strengthen the
 position of Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping who are now

 denounced as the two leading "revisionist" villains within
 the Central Committee.   In the reorganization of the party
 structure at the Eighth Party Congress in September 1956,
 Mao Tse-tung delegated a substantial amount of political
 power to Liu (as the senior 'Vice-Chairman of the newly
 established Standing Committee of the Politburo) and to
 Teng (as head of the Secretariat charged with "attending
 to the daily work of the Central Committee").
 A decade hence at an important Central Committee
 work conference in October 1966 Mao Tse-tung would refer
 to this delegation of power as a "mistake," the consequ-
 ences of which had necessitated the "great proletarian
 cultural revolution.'"  As Mao explained it, he had dele-
 gated this power in order to provide for a smooth succes-
 sion in the leadership--"to foster these people's authority
 so that no great changes would arise in the country when
 the time came for me to meet my Heavenly King (God)."   Mao's
 confidence in his principal party lieutenants,  however,
 had been misplaced,   They had abused his confidence,  had
 committed a number of "mistakes," and  (like Kao and Jao
 before them) had constructed "independent kingdoms."
 Policy issues were at the heart of the second big
 factional struggle--that waged at Lushan in July and August
 1959 against a "right opportunist, or revisionist,   anti-
 party clique" headed by the then Minister of National
 Defense Peng Te-huai,   For the first time since 1935,-Mao
 Tse-tung's personal leadership and programs were openly
 subjected to attack by a long-time "comrade in arms" who,
 moreover,  had managed to muster considerable support within
 the Central Committee.   Although Mao would triumph at
 Lushan,  the opposition to his radical domestic and foreign
 policies would persist and finally precipitate the "great
 proletarian cultural revolution."
 In retrospect,  it appears that Peng Te-huai was
 the prototype of all those who would be attacked during
 the "cultural revolution" as "Kh-ushchev-type revisionists"
 within the Chinese Communist party.   In criticizing Mao's
 radical "great leap forward" and commune programs, Peng
 represented a large group of the more pragmatic and tech-
 nically minded administrators and professionals within

 the party,  government and army who had come to see the
 folly of these programs.   In their stead,  Peng may be
 said to have advanced an alternative model of economic
 and military development, one patterned more closely on
 Soviet experience and featuring Soviet military, economic
 and technical assistance.   As the symbol both of Soviet
 "revisionist" influence and of opposition to Mao, the
 Peng Te-huai affair would cast a long shadow over the
 years that followed.
 Developments in the three year period following
 the Lushan plenum (1959-1962) demonstrated that in im-
 portant respects, in the great debate over domestic and
 foreign policy staged at this historic meeting, Peng Te-
 huai had been right and Mao Tse-tung had been wrong,   The
 combined effect of irrational economic policy, successive
 bad harvests and the Soviet withdrawal of technicians in
 the summer of 1960 dealt Mao's "great leap forward" program
 of economic development a shattering blow.   As a result,
 by the winter of 1961-1962 opposition to Mao's policies
 and programs extended into the ranks of the Politburo to
 include a number of those who were charged with the
 responsibility for coping with this domestic crisis.   As
 Mao Tse-tung would subsequently point out, this opposi-
 tion was of two kinds--that carried on "secretly" by "the
 Peng Chen group" and that carried on "openly"" by "the
 Liu Shao-chi - Teng Hsiao-ping group."  The progressive
 awareness by Mao (and a small coterie of trusted advisers)
 of the extent of this opposition would culminate in the
 fall of 1965 in the decision to initiate what would prove
 to be the most thoroughgoing and one of the most violent
 party purges in Communist history.
 It appears to be true, as Red Guard publications
 have charged,  that Liu Shao-chi at an enlarged Central
 Committee work conference in January 1962 not-only defended
 Mao's earlier critics but repeated some of the same critic-
 isms of Mao's radical domestic programs which Peng Te-huai
 had first raised at Lushan.   Although he could cite the
 party constitution as Justifying his "open opposition" on
 this occasion,  Liu must have suspected that Mao would treat
 this criticism as a direct personal attack.   It appears
 in retrospect that Mao Tse-tung did in fact interpret

 Liu's criticism at the January 1962 party work conference
 as a direct attack against both his policies and himself
 and determined not long thereafter to make new arrange-
 ments for a "revolutionary successor."
 The consequences of this decision would be momentous.
 It would mean, instead of the smooth succession which Mao
 had hoped to achieve by conferring power and prestige on
 Liu Shao-chi as head of the party apparatus,  the start of
 a succession struggle.   It would necessitate a thorough
 purging of all those in the party apparatus who had staked
 their careers on the eventual succession to power of Liu
 Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping and,  as a result,  had espoused
 the views and policies of these party machine leaders.
 It would require enlisting the support of other leaders
 whose bases of power lay outside the party apparatus,
 principally Lin Piao (indispensable as Commander in Chief
 of the People's Liberation Army) and Chou En-lai (also
 important as an able administrator and representative of
 the government bureaucracy).   It would require the con-
 struction of an elaborate trap with which to ensnare Liu
 Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-ping and their supporters in the
 party apparatus,  and the creation of such extra-party mass
 organizations as the Red Guards to supply the element of
 force needed to spring this trap,   In short,  this decision
 to select a new "revolutionary successor" would lead, after
 the necessary preparations had been made, to the launching
 of Mao Tse-tung's "great proletarian cultural revolution."

 FACTIONALISM IN THE CENTRAL COMMITTEE:
 MAO'S OPPOSITION SINCE 1949
 "In the 16 years since the founding of
 our people's republic, the Marxist-Leninist
 leadership of the Chinese Communist Party
 Central Committee headed by Comrade Mao Tse-
 tung has waged three big struggles against
 anti-Party revisionist cliques." -- Jen-min
 Jih-pao  (People's Daily) Editorial, "Long
 Live Mao Tse-?tung's Thought," July 1,  1966.
 A fascinating by-product of the "great proletarian
 cultural revolution" has been the disclosure of new in-
 formation nn factional. struggles within the Chinese Com-
 munist Party since its rise to power in 1949.                                One purpose
 of these disclosures has been to demonstrate the validity
 of Mao Tse-tung's most recent "creative development" of
 Marxism-Leninism--''that classes and class struggle exist
 in society throughout the historical period of the dictator-
 ship of the proletariat."   A second purpose has been to
 discredit and incriminate Mao's high-ranking opponents with-
 in the party by charging them with varying degrees of
 complicity in these earlier "anti-party" struggles.
 Because of the questionable nature of this new
 evidence,  it must of course be used with great care.   It
 is necessary, for example, to be extremely wary of allega-
 tions of misconduct unless supported by statements of the
 accused uttered at the time and reproduced in verbatim
 form.   It is also necessary to attempt to place these state-
 ments in the proper context, both of the speech or report
 from which they are drawn and of the policy guidelines pre-
 vailing at the time.   With these caveats in mind,  it is
 believed that these disclosures do provide new and valu-
 able insights into the process of policy formation and
 the structure of power in the Chinese Communist Party over
 the course of the past 19 years.

 Reduced to the broadest common denominator, the
 "three big struggles" that have taken place within the
 Chinese Communist Party since 1949 have been,  as:  Mao's
 propagandists assert, "struggles for and against Mao Tse-
 tung's thought."                  At the same time,  they have necessarily
 involved considerations of power and in all cases have
 been regarded by Mao as challenges to his leadership of
 the party.   The recurring nature of these challenges--the
 "anti-party alliance of Kao Kang and Jao Shu-shih" in 1953,
 the "right opportunist, or revisionist, anti-party clique
 headed by Peng Te-huai" in 1959, and the open-ended "count-
 er.-.revolutionary clique' (headed initially by Peng Chen
 and Lo Jui-chin; and later by Liu Shao-chi and Teng Hsiao-
 ping) in 1965-1967--suggests, moreover, that factional
 strife, carried on beneath a facade of unity, has been a
 prominent feature of party life in Communist China since
 1949.
 The purpose of this paper is to reappraise the nature
 and extent of this phenomenon of factionalism within the
 Central Committee on the basis of new evidence brought to
 light during the course of the past two years.   Although
 each of these struggles is unique and possesses an intrinsic
 interest of its own, an attempt will be made to identify
 features common to all..   The ultimate purpose of this paper,
 then,  is to?.seek to illuminate the origins,  nature and pos-
 sible future development of the latest and most momentous
 of these factional struggles--Mao Tse-tung's "great pro-
 letarian cultural revolution."

 The Kao Kang - Jao Shu-shih Anti-Party Alliance
 "The criminal aim of the Kao Kang -
 Jao Shu-shih anti.-Party alliance was to split
 our Party and to overthrow the leading core
 --the long tested Central Committee of the
 Party headed by Comrade Mao Tse-tung--with
 the aim of seizing the supreme power of the
 Party and the State.   Their means to achieve
 this aim was conspiracy.   This was the prin-
 cipal hallmark and program of this anti-Party
 alliance."    People's Daily Editorial, 'Tre-
 mendous Victory of the Party in History,"
 April 10,  1955.
 Red Guard disclosures have added a new dimension
 to our understanding of the first big struggle against
 factionalism in the Chinese Communist Party since it came
 to power--that waged against the Kao-Jao "anti-Party al-
 liance" in the years 1953-1955.   The princirals in this
 affair were, of course, Kao Kang and Jao Shu-shih who,
 in running the regional party organizations in the indus-
 trial areas of Northeast and East China, had constructed,
 it was charged,  "independent kingdoms."  Although relatively
 few and fragmentary in character,  these new disclosures
 suggest that this first challenge to Mao Tse-tung's lead-
 ership was more broadly-based and formidable than in-
 dicated at the time.
 One aspect of the Kao-Jao affair, it has now been
 revealed, was an effort to persuade Mao Tse-tung to give
 uv one of his leadership positions, to resign either as
 Chairman of the Party or the State (almost certainly the
 latter).   The leading figure in this effort apr,arently was
 the revolutionary war hero Chu Teh, charged subsequently
 by Lin Piao (in the fall of 1959) with having "tried to
 become the leader himself... advocating the idea at the
 time of the Kao Kang incident of becoming Chairman in turn."
 Another prominent figure in this effort was Tan Chen-lin
 (at the time de facto head of the East China regional
 bureau) who (it is now disclosed) "in 1953...took the lead
