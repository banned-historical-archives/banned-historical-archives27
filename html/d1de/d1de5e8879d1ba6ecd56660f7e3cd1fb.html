 PERU-USSR: Military Relations
 The USSR is apparently attempting to ensure that Peru
 con tnues to depend on it for the maintenance of Peru's Soviet-
 made military equipment.  This could become a new source of
 friction in the military relationship between the two countries.
 the Soviets have ma e it  i   icu     or    e Peruvian
 rmy to perform major maintenance on its T-55 tanks. They are
 said to have refused to issue detailed manuals that would
 enable the Peruvians to overhaul the T-55 engines; the Soviets
 insist that the engines be returned to the USSR for such ser-
 vice.                It is standard practice to return the engines of Soviet-
 made military aircraft to the USSR for periodic overhaul, but
 for reasons of efficiency and economy, tank engines usually
 are not.//
 //Peru reportedly has reacted by looking for al-
 ternative sources for a diesel engine compatible with the T-55.
 One prospect is the UK, which has studied the feasibility of
 installing Western engines in Egypt's Soviet-made tanks.  It
 would be some time, however, before Peru would be able to find
 a suitable replacement engine.//
 //The Peruvians have had many problems with their
 300 T- 5s. Early last year,  some 70 of the tanks were inoperable
 because of engine failure at high altitudes, other equipment
 weaknesses, and an inadequate supply of spare parts. The per-
 centage of inoperable T-55s apparently has not diminished since
 then.//
 K/The success of Poland and East Germany in
 reducing their hard currency trade deficits last year has raised
 concern among their major Western trading partners.  Poland has
 cut  its imports sharply,  while East Germany has combined import
 cuts with an abrasive export policy that has irritated some of
 its Western trading partners.  The cuts particularly affect im-
 ports of machinery and equipment.  Nonetheless,  Western suppliers,
 concerned about their export markets, continue to push their
 exports by offering large credits to Eastern Europe.//

 Ethiopia is trying hard to deter the US from supply-
 ing arms to Somalia.  The Ethiopians have enlisted the aid of
 Kenya to get their message across.
 Ethiopian Foreign Minister Feleke, in a recent con-
 versation with Deputy Assistant Secretary Harrop, reaffirmed
 his government's strong opposition to the US decision in
 principle to sell defensive arms to Somalia.  Interpreting
 press reports of a $15 million arms deal as a fait accompli,
 Feleke warned that the US should not be surprised if such a
 deal caused a deterioration in recently improved Ethiopian-US
 relations.
 Bilateral relations have improved in recent months
 and have been highlighted by Ethiopia's willingness to accept
 a new US Ambassador and--at least until Chairman Mengistu's
 speech yesterday--by a diminution in Addis Ababa's anti-US
 rhetoric.     In his speech, Mengistu accused the US of sending 60
 advisers to aid the insurgents in Eritrea.
 A senior official in the Ethiopian Ministry of Foreign
 Affairs, who handles relations with the US, earlier this week
 warned that Somali assurances that US arms would not be used
 against Somalia's neighbors were worthless. He said that arming
 Mogadiscio would be tantamount to encouraging further Somali
 aggression in the Ogaden.
 The official also charged that Somalia was continuing
 to infiltrate regular Army forces into the Ogaden and reiterated
 Mengistu's recent threat that Ethiopia will take punitive
 measures against Somalia if the Somalis increase their activi-
 ties on behalf of the Ogadeni insurgents.
 The Ethiopians are also using the Kenyans, who they
 believe have more influence on US decisionmaking than Ethiopia
 does, to push their message. On Wednesday, for example, Kenya's
 Ambassador to Ethiopia made an impassioned plea to the US
 Charge against any US arms supply relationship with Somalia.
 He replayed all the arguments Feleke used with Secretary
 Harrop.

 The Kenyans also are fearful of Somali irredentism
 and doubtless need little prodding from Addis Ababa to plead
 the Ethiopian case. The Kenyan Ambassador probably was accu-
 rately reflecting the views of his government, although Kenya's
 unhappiness with the US has been tempered by its own arms sup-
 ply relationship with the US.

 Two national referendums set for Sunday and Monday
 in Italy could produce results politically embarrassing to the
 country's major parties, particularly the Communists.  The elec-
 torate will be deciding whether to retain or repeal two contro-
 versial laws,  one providing tougher law-and-order measures and
 the other providing for public financing of political parties.
 Nearly all the parties--including the Communists--favor reten-
 tion of both Laws, and a vote favoring repeal is unlikely. The
 Communists opposed the security  legislation in parliament three
 years ago, and if they receive Less backing than expected in
 the referendum, many Italians will conclude the Communists have
 been unable to persuade all of their followers to accept the
 party's tougher stance on law and order.
 The referendums result from signature campaigns spear-
 headed by the small Radical Party; a national referendum can be
 held on certain types of legislation in Italy if 500,000 voters
 petition for repeal.
 The Radicals, who have long championed civil rights
 causes, argue that the public order legislation not only is re-
 pressive but also has failed to reduce crime and violence;  the
 law significantly broadened police powers of search and arrest
 and increased the penalties for many crimes.
 Parliament authorized public funding for political
 parties in 1974 after an investigation of oil company political
 payoffs proved embarrassing to some of the governing parties.
 Most of the $72 million annual appropriation is divided among
 the parties according to their relative strengths in parliament.
 The Radicals and some other small parties urging repeal argue
 that the law gives unfair advantage to existing large parties.
 Because parties representing about 90 percent of the
 electorate have endorsed the laws and a simple majority is re-
 quired to uphold them, it is generally taken for granted that
 the voters will retain them.  Interest centers mainly on the
 size of the expected endorsements. A sizable negative vote will
 be seen as a slap at the political establishment generally.

 The Radicals would consider such a vote a moral vic-
 tory, because it would. suggest that the major parties do not
 have a tight hold on their voters and are not responsive to
 their views.
 I//The Communists are particularly worried about
 the vote on the public order law. Most supporters of the cen-
 trist and conservative parties will probably oppose repealing
 the law. Even if waverers such as supporters of the Socialist
 Party vote against it, the law should still be endorsed by about
 80 percent of the voters.//
 //If a. substantially smaller percentage of
 voters--say 70 percent.--backs the law, the result would be in-
 terpreted as evidence that the Communists, who voted against
 the law in 1975 but now endorse it, have been unable to convert
 political violence.//

 The French Government is supplementing its two-year-
 old stabilization program with a set of controversial steps
 aimed at enhancing the efficiency of the economy.  These actions
 initially will have an adverse impact on inflation and employ-
 ment. Criticism in the coming months, particularly from the
 labor unions and the Socialist and Communist Parties,  is likely.
 His hand strengthened by the March election, Presi-
 dent Giscard is moving to prune drastically government inter-
 vention in the economy.  Before the end of the year he will:
 Eliminate all price controls on industrial products.
 Reduce subsidies to state enterprises,  to be made up
 by higher prices for their products.
 Encourage individuals to channel savings into produc-
 tive investment.
 Implement tougher guidelines for aiding troubled firms.

 Giscard clearly is taking a considerable gamble be-
 cause the negative effects of the new policy are likely to show
 up long before any benefits become apparent.  In particular,
 price decontrol could cause inflation to increase this year.
 The rate of inflation last year was 9 percent, and it is likely
 to rise to at least 11 percent, according to the latest govern-
 At the same time, the tougher policy concerning ail-
 ing firms probably will force a number of them to cut back or
 close and thus add to an already worsening unemployment problem.
 According to Labor Minister Boulin, the number of unemployed
 could rise by about 200,000 in 1978, to 1.2 million.
 The new measures, however, are shrewdly timed. Gis-
 card does not face reelection until 1981, and a new legislative
 election need not be called for five years.  If the program proves
 successful, voters will have ample time to forget early negative
 effects of the policy shift.
 In the meantime, Giscard and Prime Minister Barre
 will have to weather a stormy transition period that could
 easily last more than a year. Workers already are unhappy about
 the slow growth in real wages they attribute to Barre and could
 protest vigorously the layoffs that result from any plant
 closings.     If an inflationary surge develops, organized labor
 will fight for large pay increases that would upset the govern-
 ment's strategy.
 CHINA: Political Conference

 these differences reflect in part different roles, and perhaps
 constituencies,  the combative speech by Vice Chairman Teng
 Hsiao-ping,  his strongest defense to date of his own pragmatic
 philosophy,  set him clearly apart from the other two leaders
 and suggests he may be willing to heighten tensions in the
 leadership and incur personal criticism to achieve progress

 a period of increased internal pressures for modernization and
 professionalization. Party and Military Commission Chairman
 Hua 1uo-feng and Vice Chairman and ex - Defense Minister Yeh
 Chien-ying addressed the meeting on 29 May, while vice Chair-
 man Teng spoke on 2 June.  Both sessions were attended by most
 of the Peking-based members of the Politburo and the military's
 top leaders.
 Hua's and Yeh's speeches contained little new infor-
 mation or insights except to make clear that the problems of
 professionalism and the proper role of political commissars--
 which have plagued the military since the Korean War--are still
 serious. Hua reflected concern that party control over the Army
 might be weakened in the press for military modernization.
 Yeh stressed the need to return to practices the
 party followed before it came to power to solve the problems
 caused by the "gang of four" and by the "new historical con-
 ditions" such as the drive to achieve the comprehensive mod-
 ernization of society.
 In sharp contrast, Teng's remarks were pointed, con-
 troversies , assertive, and directed less at the specific prob-
 lems of military political work than at reemphasizing and le-
 gitimizing Teng's own brand of political pragmatism.  He called
 for a more flexible and realistic approach to new problems and
 less mechanical recitation of Maoist phrases or application of
 old methods.
 He attacked those who have apparently criticized him
 on doctrinal grounds by asserting that the pragmatic method he
 espouses is the "fundamental point" of Mao's ideology and
 that those who talk about "Mao Tse-tung Thought every day,"
 but oppose Teng, are actually opposed to Mao.
 In contrast to Hua's and Yeh's conciliatory approach
 to problems within the military, Teng called for a reopening
 of the investigation of the Lin Piao affair, which could in-
 volve a wider purge of senior officers, and for a more rigorous
 selection of leading cadres to facilitate policy implementation.

 Teng seems to have been deliberately controversial
 in an attempt to shake up his audience and to free them from
 the "mental shackles" that prevent them from seeking creative
 solutions to problems. His emphasis on problem-solving will no
 doubt be popular within the bureaucracy. While he revealed no
 major differences with Hua and Yeh over policy objectives, his
 approach to political problems and the speed at which he wants
 to see them solved are in such marked contrast to their more
 conservative views that the implementation of policy may be
 adversely affected.
 Teng's unorthodox position--defying his critics and
 making statements that could be construed as criticism of his
 party superiors--is evidence of his confidence in his politi-
 cal status, and of his resilience, because the views he voiced
 are some of the "errors" for which he was criticized in 1975
 and 1976. His decision to push his philosophy, even if it
 creates fissures in the top leadership,  indicates the great
 urgency he feels for rapid progress toward solving deep-seated
 problems, and a sense of frustration over delays caused by
 fear and ideological footdragging.
 CHINA: Flexibility in Foreign Trade
 //China has become increasingly willing to liberal-
 ize its trade and finance policies in order to promote economic
 development by boosting the use of import financing for pur-
 chases of technology.//
 //Chinese officials have been considering trade
 and financing arrangements that they previously would not even
 have discussed, including:
 -- Using long-term credits and financing capital imports
 through foreign bank deposits with the Bank of China.
 -- Arranging barter and compensation deals for plant pur-
 chases.
 -- Importing materials to be reprocessed for export.
 -- Designating certain plants to produce goods specifically
 for the Japanese market.

 -- Complying more fully with international standards on
 patents, trademarks,  and copyrights.//
 //A recent New China News Agency article highlighted
 the "flexible practices" used at the spring Canton Fair to pro-
 mote exports. These included supplying goods under consumer
 trademarks and brand names, producing goods using customer-
 supplied designs and raw materials, bartering for some commodi-
 ties, and showing flexibility in setting export prices and con-  25X1
 tract currencies.//
 //Peking continues to insist that its basic policy
 of self-reliance is unchanged and that loans,  joint ventures,
 and foreign investment in China are still unacceptable.  Ideo-
 logical constraints on more venturesome trade practices have
 loosened since the suppression of the radical faction, however,
 giving Vice Premier Teng Hsiao-ping and other economic prag-
 matists a freer hand to pursue an active trade policy.//

 //Liberalized approaches to trade and finance will
 further China's goal of expanding imports of foreign equipment
 and technology and of producing the exports to pay for them.
 Financing will be necessary for large amounts of "modernizing"
 imports--perhaps $30 billion over the next five years.//
 //In view of China's excellent credit rating and
 healthy financial position, sizable short- and long-term credits
 are available from the West.  In certain cases, barter and com-
 pensation deals would appeal to Peking because export markets
 for Chinese products could be nailed down when the plant con-
 tract is signed. Ultimately, it will be necessary to export more
 in order to pay for the expanded imports and to improve the
 marketability of Chinese goods.//
 //Limited export potential is the major problem.
 Markets for petroleum exports are limited by high prices,
 transport costs, and undesirable refining characteristics of
 Chinese oil. Moreover, estimates suggest China's exportable
 surplus of crude oil will level off by the mid-1980s. Sales of
 other goods face problems of either inadequate supply or limited
 al
 i
 h

 foreign demand.  In addition, China's small reserve of tec
 and scientific expertise will impede the absorption and adapta-
 tion of imported technology.

 Ethiopia
 In a belligerent speech yesterday, Ethiopian Chairman
 Mengistu once again denounced Eritrean secessionist guerrillas
 and voiced his determination to seek a military solution to the
 conflict unless the insurgents agree to negotiate on Ethiopian
 terms.  Some press reports misinterpreted his remarks as con-
 ciliatory, but even his offer of "amnesty" was a blatant attempt
 to encourage guerrilla desertions rather than a general pardon.
