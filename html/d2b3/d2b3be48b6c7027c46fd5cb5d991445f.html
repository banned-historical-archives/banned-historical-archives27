 South Vietnam:
 Quarreling Over Islands
 .i_ (-hina and South Vietnam have stepped up
 their war of words over the Paracel and Spratly
 Islands, but thus far there are no signs that fight-
 ing will resume. This week, Peking reacted to
 Saigon's dispatch of a small naval task force to
 the Spratlys with a tough statement charging that
 the South Vietnamese action is a "new military
 provocation," and asserting that China will not
 tolerate such infringement of its territory. Sub-
 sequently, Saigon stated that its action in the
 Spratlys, which lie some 400 nautical miles south
 of the Paracels in the South China Sea, is a
 natural  defensive  measure  following  Chinese
 "aggression" in the Paracels)
 Saigon now has at least 200 troops in the
 Spratlys, and more troops may be on the way;
 South Vietnamese military spokesmen have stated
 that their troops are now on six of the islands.
 China has no forces in the area and has not
 Paracel
 Islands
 Spratly
 Islands
 patrolled the islands. Taiwan and the Philippines,
 which also claim the Spratlys, have had troops on
 several of the islands for some time, and both
 countries have protested Saigon's action'
 [South  Vietnam's                                            reinforcement  of  the
 Spr tlys is almost certainly designed to under-
 score its claim in the event that oil exploration
 ever becomes a serious possibility. Saigon seems
 reasonably confident that under present circum-
 stances its action will not be contested, other
 than verbally. Military operations such as oc-
 curred in the Paracels would be hard for any of
 the claimants to undertake because the Spratlys
 lie near or beyond the outer reach of their mili-
 tary range, especially for air cover]
 :L[A forceful reaction from mainland China
 cannot be ruled out, but there are no signs of
 preparation for such action. In addition to logistic
 difficulties, a military response would present
 complicated  diplomatic  problems  for  Peking.
 China wants to avoid a clash with Taiwan, which
 would risk involving the US and disrupt relations
 with China's neighbors in Southeast Asia. Trouble
 with Manila would also upset the countries of
 Southeast Asia.

 )King Husayn was forced to cut short a visit
 to London and hurry back to Amman this week
 to quell an army mutiny. The insurrection-or-
 ganized by disgruntled non-commissioned offi-
 cers-has developed into the most serious internal
 crisis for Husayn since the showdown with the
 fedayeen in September 1970.11
 1;   IThus far, the army's loyalty to the King has
 held firm and there has been no bloodshed. But
 the rebellious troops have made far-reaching de-
 mands  that  have  won  widespread  sympathy
 among the lower ranks of the armed forces and
 apparently among the civilian population as well]
 jJ   The trouble started last weekend when en-
 listed personnel from the elite 40th Armored Bri-
 gade, which had just returned from Syria, muti-
 nied and demanded to see the King's brother,
 Crown Prince Hassan. The mutiny seemed to sub-
 side almost as quickly as it began after Hassan
 listened to the dissidents' grievances and promised
 to take their case to Husayn. Before the King
 returned, however, the insurrection picked up
 momentum again and spread to other units.\
 In addition to a pay raise and a general
 rollback of consumer prices, the mutinous troops
 are calling on Husayn to dismiss both the army's
 unpopular chief of staff, Sharif Zayd bin Shakir,
 and air force commander Brigadier Abbud Salim.
 The dissidents want Husayn to appoint Sharif
 Nasir, the King's uncle and an influential figure
 among Jordan's Bedouin tribesmen, as both com-
 mander in chief of the armed forces and prime
 minister. They are demanding the resignation of     immediate pay increase for the army and for the
 Prime Minister Zaid Rifai and several other civi-   internal security service, but thi step may not be
 lian officials whom they hold responsible for esca- Jnough to cool the situation.jUnless the King
 lating living costs.]                               dismisses Bin Shakir and Rifai, which he is appar-
 ently resisting, the two men will almost certainly
 continue to be the focus of smoldering resent-
 Since his return on February 5, Husayn has                     ment,  not only among the rank-and-file  but
 t$eer making the rounds of rebellious army units    among those at higher levels in the army who also

 THE ENERGY CONFEREN(G,~  PRELUDE
 (fJC scone))
 rMost  of the nations participating in the
 Washington energy conference next week favor
 some form of international cooperation on energy
 matters but are reluctant to undertake any ac-
 tions that might antagonize the oil-producing na-
 tions. Perhaps the subject of strongest common
 interest to the visiting participants-the EC-nine,
 Canada, Japan, Norway, and top officials of the
 EC and OECD-will be the proposals to develop
 alternative sources of energy. The most conten-
 tious issue is likely to be the question of whether
 the group of industrialized, oil-importing coun-
 tries should meet periodically to review energy-
 related problems.
 The opening plenary session on February 11,
 which will be devoted to the present energy situa-
 tion and its impact on the world economy, prom-
 ises to be time-consuming but non-controversial.
 EC officials expect to explain their view of the
 causes and consequences of the changed relation-
 ship between supply and demand as well as the
 basic causes and significance of price movements.
 The fact that others, including the US, may wish
 to cover much the same ground has added to
 skepticism about whether the two-day conference
 will be able to explore any new territory. Some
 may welcome a lack of time for debate; a senior
 British official, for example, has expressed the
 hope that ample time would be provided for the
 ministers to "talk themselves dry."
 A subsequent foreign ministers' session-in
 parallel with separate sessions of finance, energy,
 and technology officials-will have to deal with
 the repeatedly expressed anxieties of almost all
 participants over relations with the oil producers
 and the lesser developed countries. Paris may seek
 to crystallize these worries into support for the
 proposals for a special UN conference on energy.
 The EC position paper calls for discussions with
 developing and producing countries to begin by
 April  1, a decision apparently designed to get
 talks with producers under way before the next
 OPEC ministerial meeting later in April.
 The widespread desire to broaden the dis-
 cussions to  include producers and developing
 countries will make it extremely difficult to reach
 any agreement on further high-level meetings of
 the February 11 group. The Nine have left the
 door open, however, for setting up short-term
 working groups to examine certain specific topics;
 the other participants would not balk at this.
 US proposals for a session of finance offi-
 cials have met widely varying reactions. Bonn was
 particularly favorable, although a senior German
 official hoped the meeting could discuss a roll-
 back of oil prices "as a means of reducing the
 complex and interrelated problems of oil pur-
 chase and international finance." Paris has been
 so negative that, as late as February 1, a con-
 cerned French official was unable "to ignite even
 a flicker of interest" in preparing for French
 participation.
 A proposed session devoted to emergency
 sharing, which is to be taken up along with con-
 servation, restraints on demand, and alternative
 sources of conventional fuels, could attract par-
 ticular interest in view of the fact that the Nine
 agreed  to include this topic in their position
 paper. Britain, however-along with Canada and
 Norway-is  likely to favor discussion only of
 those supplies that enter international commerce.
 Participants  in  the  proposed  session  on
 science and technology are likely to pursue their
 interest in gaining access to US technology for
 enriching uranium. A feasibility study is under
 way for a projected Canadian gaseous diffusion
 facility.  The  project has some Japanese and
 German financial support for its initial study,
 while the US Atomic Energy Commission is giving
 technical  advice. The  backers of the project
 would be interested in longer term US assistance.
 The     French  Atomic  Energy Commission  has
 opposed efforts to seek US help for the French-
 sponsored Eurodif consortium's facility but Italy
 and Belgium, who are also backers, are interested,
 as  is  the  principal French  utility company.
 Britain, the Netherlands, and West Germany co-
 operate                                                                                   in  the rival-and more experimental-
 Urenco project for an enrichment facility using
 the centrifuge process. US technological help evi-
 dently  would  be particularly helpful  to this

 VINTAGE YEAR FOR SOVIET IET ECONOMY
 The Soviet economy recovered sharply in
 1973 from its exceptionally poor performance
 the previous year. An 8 percent surge in gross
 national product was largely due to the record
 performance in the agricultural sector. Industry
 also recovered from its 1972 slowdown, with
 most of the gain occurring in the machinery
 sector. Substantial growth is scheduled for 1974,
 but Moscow's prospects for achieving the original
 goals of the 1971-1975 plan are extremely bleak.
 Exceptionally good weather and increased
 supplies of fertilizer were mainly responsible for
 the surge in farm output. The record grain har-
 vest, together with continuing grain imports, will
 enable the Soviets to rebuild stocks and to export
 some grain to non-communist countries. More-
 over, the bumper harvests of wheat and corn will
 help alleviate shortages of feed grains for the
 expanding livestock herds and promote increased
 meat production this year.
 The output of all industrial materials, except
 energy products, grew at higher rates than in
 1972_ Depletion of the more easily exploitable oil
 and gas reserves accelerated last year, requiring
 more new capacity to maintain previous levels of

 output. The increases in fuels and power, how-
 ever,                     were  enough  to  assure continued  self-
 sufficiency in energy.
 In the machinery sector, gains in the pro-,
 duction of passenger cars, vacuum cleaners, and
 furniture led the field of consumer durables while
 generators, instruments, and agricultural machin-
 ery posted the greatest gains for producer dura-
 bles. Consumer nondurables made a substantial
 recovery, aided primarily by large increases in soft
 goods.
 Soviet consumers benefited from substantial
 increases in food supplies-especially fruits, vege-
 tables, and dairy products. Meat consumption re-
 mained at about the 1972 level, as increases in
 meat production apparently were deferred in
 order to expand livestock herds. Consumption of
 soft goods  recovered from near stagnation in
 1972, and construction of new housing in 1973
 more than offset the deterioration of existing
 housing and the population growth.
 The chronic economic problems of slow
 assimilation of.new technology and delayed com-
 pletion of new facilities persisted in 1973. Never-
 theless, programs to curtail the proliferation of
 new construction  projects and to concentrate
 investment in projects nearing completion were
 more successful than usual. Gross additions to
 new fixed capital stock increased at nearly twice
 the rate of the previous year, while the increase in
 unfinished construction dropped from 13 percent
 to less than 3 percent.
 Soviet trade with the developed West in-
 creased by about one third in 1973 after a 25-
 percent increase in 1972. Moscow's trade with the
 West grew faster than its trade with the com-
 munist countries; it exceeded $9 billion, including
 large imports of machinery, equipment, and grain.
 Soviet imports from the West continued to grow
 much  faster than  exports; the hard currency
 deficit in 1973 was a record $1.7 billion. The
 USSR financed this deficit by selling gold and by
 drawing on Western credits.
 Moscow's economic goals for 1974 indicate
 that the economy will continue essentially on its
 present tack. The major thrust of the 1974 plan is
 to ensure an uninterrupted supply of fuel to in-
 dustry while providing an additional boost to
 consumer-goods  production.  Although  the
 scheduled industrial goal (6.8 percent) is within
 reach, prospects for achieving the planned 7.3
 percent gain in agricultural output are dim unless
 the above-average weather conditions of last year
 are matched in 1974.
 The original goals of the 1971-1975 plan
 called for continuous upward growth, with par-
 ticularly high rates scheduled in the final two
 years. The 1972 slump delivered a severe blow to
 these plans, and the recovery last year only par-
 tially made up the deficit. Thus, despite the con-
 tinued  expressions of optimism in the Soviet
 press, Moscow  cannot  realistically  expect to
 achieve many of its original goals.

 slated for agricultural output.
 1he 1973 targets for national income, in-

 exceeded.  Romania,  Bulgaria,  and  Poland
 achieved the fastest growth rates; Czechoslovakia,
 East Germany, and Hungary recorded moderate
 growth. All countries had good harvests-even
 Bulgaria and Romania, which fell short of pro-
 duction goals.
 East European consumers came in for their
 share of the growth in 1973. Most of the coun-
 tries have increased domestic supplies of meat and
 consumer goods, and all of them continued to
 hold the line on retail prices. Retail trade is in-
 creasing faster than national output, however, and
 imports  of  consumer  goods are on the rise
 throughout the area. These gains have helped to
 ease the pain of longer term problems such as the
 shortage of housing. Waiting time for apartments
 still approaches eleven years n some major cities
 and huge investments will be needed to reduce
 the lag noticeably. The consumer fares worst in
 Romania, where an increased output of consumer
 goods has been largely siphoned off into exports.
 Current plans reflect the successes of last
 year; even higher growth rates are earmarked for
 national income and industrial production than
 were planned for 1973. Meanwhile, as long as the
 results continue to be favorable, the governments
 of the East European countries are not likely to
 rock the boat by instituting economic reforms.
 Import prices of agricultural products and
 other materials not related to the energy field are
 probably of more importance to the 1974 plan.
 Eastern Europe is banking on a good harvest to
 reduce its agricultural import bill, which almost
 doubled last year. Czechoslovakia is planning for
 a 33-percent increase in the price of imported raw
 materials, while Hungary and Romania expect
 similar increases. If prices increase faster, or if
 harvests do not meet planned levels, balance-
 of-payments  strains  will  occur. Some adjust-
 ments-such as cutting imports of machinery and
 equipment or reducing consumer imports--might

 _.    The question of whether to close the NATO
 base at Keflavik or simply reduce the number of
 US personnel is the consuming foreign policy

 with the UK, which united all Icelanders, the base
 issue has not only split the coalition but has also
 fragmented the political parties. The initial suc-

 .Y f The pro-base petition has collected some
 30,00 names since it was started in mid-January,
 leading the Communists to step up the tempo of
 and, eventually, total withdrawal of US forces.
 This stimulated the party's dormant right wing,
 which backed the signature campaign, to increase
 support for the base against the wishes of the
 party majority. Progressive Prime Minister Johan-

 center, and right factions of his party together.]

 as a way of minimizing fragmentation within the
 parties, but most leaders are reluctant to face the
 finality of a referendum. Next to fishing rights,
 the base is the only foreign policy issue of any
 consequence in Iceland, and even the parties of
 the center have been able to use it to advantage in
 the past.?
 fThe current situation seems to favor the
 supporters of the base. Although Foreign Minister
 Agustsson recently reiterated his hope that ways
 could be found to fulfill Iceland's NATO obliga-

 a member of his party's right wing stressed the
 necessity and desirability of having the US forces

 PEKING, MOSCOW, AND CONFUCIUS
 ~
 ign
 eking's  current  propaganda  ca np
 againt Moscow is focusing largely on domestic
 political issues in both the USSR and China. Not
 only have the Chinese vociferously condemned
 Moscow's handling of its own internal affairs, but,
 more significantly, they have injected an anti-
 Soviet line into the still boiling "anti-Confucius
 campaign,"  an  on-going  political  movement
 within China that is almost certainly connected to
 differences within the Chinese leadership.
 The current round of attacks began with a
 blast against Moscow occasioned by the publica-
 tion in the West of Solzhenitsyn's Gulag Archi-
 pelago. After having avoided comments on dissi-
 dents in the USSR for a number of years, Peking
 accused Moscow's leaders of being "fascists" and
 of administering a police state. While Solzhe-
 nitsyn was not mentioned by name, it is clear that
 they had him in mind and that they were intent
 on adding to the problems of the Soviets on this
 sensitive issue.
 This broadside was followed closely by the
 expulsion of five Soviet diplomats on espionage
 charges, the first such action, since the Cultural
 Revolution. Peking drew special attention to this
 incident by publishing a lurid account of the case
 and followed with a harshly worded official note
 protesting Moscow's retaliatory action of "ex-
 pelling" a Chinese diplomat already on his way
 home. Rubbing salt into the wounds, Ambassador
 Tolstikov was then involved in an auto accident
 which he-and many in the diplomatic commu-
 nity in Peking-considered to be a deliberate prov-
 ocation.
 Running through the Chinese polemics on
 the "spying" incident are charges that Moscow
 not only is conducting espionage against China,
 but that it is attempting to fish in troubled Chi-
 nese political waters. Just five days after the ex-
 pulsion of the Soviet diplomats, People's Daily
 republished an article charging that Moscow was
 "worshiping Confucius" as a means of subverting
 the Chinese regime, restoring capitalism, and turn-
 ing China into a Soviet "colony." "Worshiping"
 Confucius, the article added, was the equivalent
 of backing such modern Chinese Confucians as
 Liu Shao-chi and Lin Piao, both of whom were
 accused of having "pro-Soviet" views after their
 disgrace. Significantly, the recent diatribe against
 Italian film-maker Antonioni's 1972 video docu-
 mentary on China also charged the Italian film
 maker with spying and with doing the bidding of
 the Soviet Union.
 These developments strongly suggest that
 the current, well -orchestrated accusations of So-
 viet meddling in Chinese domestic affairs may in
 part be designed to discredit elements within the
 Chinese political hierarchy. In the past several
 years, and particularly since the Tenth Party Con-
 gress  last summer, Chinese officials have ex-
 pressed considerable concern that Moscow might
 try to exploit disagreements within Peking for its
 own ends. Peking may now be preparing to make
 specific allegations along these lines. This is at
 least one conclusion that could be drawn from a
 recent remark by Vice Foreign Minister Chiao
 Kuan-hua that Peking has "bigger fish to fry" in
 connection  with  the  spying  incident.

 remier Chou En-lai, Burin' talks with Jap-
 anese officials, indicated that China produced 1
 million barrels per day of crude oil last year-sub-
 stantially more than the 700,000 to 800,000 bar-
 rels per day estimated by Western industry and
 government analysts. In other meetings with the
 Japanese, Chinese officials provided output data
 for  1971  and 1972 that also indicates much
 higher production than previously estimated; re-
 cently acquired data support the Chinese claims.
 Production at the rate of 1 million barrels per day
 gives added credibility to reported Chinese pro-
 posals to increase crude oil exports to Japan from
 the 60,000 barrels per day scheduled for 1974 to
 100,000. The most recent proposal to increase
 exports was put forward by Deputy Premier Teng
 Hsiao-ping on January 17.
 The Chinese have been quick to use their
 available production to profit from disruptions in
 the world petroleum market. For example, ex-
 ports of petroleum products to Hong Kong have
 been stepped up. Moreover, at the expiration of
 China's current contract with Japan this March,
 Peking reportedly will raise the price of crude oil
 to Japan from $3.75 a barrel to $8.60 a barrel.
 In  earlier discussions with  the Japanese,
 Peking expressed interest in some form of cooper-
 ative development of China's offshore reserves.
 There have been a number of reports that negotia-
 tions are under way, but Peking has probably
 made no final decision. It is possible that, rather
 than concluding a bilateral agreement with the
 Japanese, the Chinese would prefer to deal with a
 consortium of Japanese, US, and West European
 firms. Prime Minister Tanaka himself was promot-
 ing such an arrangement last fall.
 Peking's positive attitude toward cooperative
 ventures has been influenced by the alacrity with
 which the large international oil firms have moved
 into the East and South China seas and by pos-
 sible future developments in the Law of the Sea
 that could restrict Chinese access to these oil-rich
 areas. Peking is apprehensive that, unless it pro-

 Haykal Ousted
 O/D fPresident Sadat moved against one of the
 most prominent men in the Arab world when he
 dismissed Al-Ahram editor Muhammad Hasanayn
 Haykal last week. Haykal's contacts with ruling
 circles have been sporadic since Sadat assumed
 the presidency three years ago, but he was a
 power in Egyptian politics during the Nasir era,
 and he had retained his prominence in Egyptian
 and Arab press circles
 L)
 D :Although  Sadat has appointed Haykal as
 presidential press adviser, the assignment is only a
 polite cover for an effort to silence the increas-
 ingly outspoken journalist. The proximate cause
 of his dismissal from Al-Ahram was probably a
 column he wrote on February 1 attacking the US,
 but Haykal has been giving Sadat cause for dis-
 comfort for some time. Since the cease-fire last
 October, Haykal has consistently been pessimistic
 about prospects for a peace settlement and skepti-
 cal about US intentions-opinions that run coun-
 ter to Sadat's views and actions.?
 96   \Haykal may not be so easily quieted, and
 4   ight well refuse the advisory post Sadat is offer-
 ing. His ability to cause serious trouble for Sadat
 is limited, however, now that he has been de-
 prived of his public voice by his dismissal from
 the newspaper
 0   Any  potential  discontent  in press circles
 should be eased by the appointment of Ali Amin
 to succeed Haykal as managing editor of Al-
 Ahram. Amin is a respected journalist whose re-
 turn two weeks ago from nine years of self-
 imposed exile evoked widespread acclaim in the
 Cairo press. His appointment may also mollify
 those among Al-Ahram's intellectual establish-
 ment who will be opposed to the paper's new
 board chairman, a position Haykal also had held.
 Deputy Prime Minister Hatim, an unpopular fig-
 ure because of his involvement in a press purge a
 year ago, now has the post
 Cabinet Reorganization Possibly Postponed
 T  [President Sadat may have decided to post-
 pone his planned cabinet reorganization. Promi-
 nent Cairo commentator Ihsan Abd al-Quddus
 noted in his weekly column on February 2 that
 extensive publicity on the cabinet consultation
 last month had given the mistaken impression
 that Egypt was in a "state of relaxation" that
 would permit full concentration on reconstruc-
 tion to the detriment of continued efforts to
 regain Arab territory
 910 rThe cabinet shuffle was expected to bring
 Economy Minister Hijazi to the prime minister-
 ship, which Sadat himself has held for the last
 year. Hijazi has been heavily involved in a revived
 program of economic liberalization that Sadat has
 been attempting to implement for some months,
 and Sadat's projected cabinet had been widely
 billed as a government of reconstruction:?
 CIO [Quddus emphasized that his predictions of a
 postponement were his own opinion and, despite
 the fact that he often reflects Sadat's thinking, he
 does not always have the inside track with the
 President. He is correct in his assessment, how-
 ever, that Sadat does not want to give the impres-
 sion that Egypt regards the struggle with Israel as
 over and is ready to let down its military guard
 and concentrate solely on domestic moves.1
 9o This is particularly important to Sadat at
 this  ime when he is suspected by many Arab
 states of having abandoned the Arab cause in
 order to seek a unilateral settlement with Israel.
 His attempts to convince the Arabs, particularly
 Syria, that this is not the case would lose some of
 their force if he proceeded with the establishment
 of a new cabinet that appeared to be geared only
 to Egypt's "postwar reconstruction.'
 q0 rSadat may thus feel it advisable to suspend
 the cabinet shuffle until after a Syrian-Israeli dis-
 engagement agreement has been reached. In the
 meantime, with or without a formal reorganiza-
 tion, he will probably continue, perhaps less os-
 tentatiously, with his plans for reconstruction and
 economic liberalization.

 USSR-CUBA: BREZHNEV GOF_S HOME
 G
 Brezhnev was less tn4Jnthusiastic about his
 trip To Cuba to begin with, but after a week of
 back-slapping and speech-making an obviously
 fatigued General Secretary could take solace that
 at least he made some headway with Castro.
 There were no dramatic breakthroughs, no major
 new agreements, and  no evidence that Cuba
 would be any less of a drain on the Kremlin's
 treasury. Still, the visit did serve to tie Cuba more
 firmly to the Soviet orbit, and Brezhnev probably
 is now more confident than before that Castro
 can be brought to accept, however grudgingly, the
 Soviet view of the benefits of detente.
 Brezhnev's round of activity on the island
 resembled his triumphal tours of loyal East Euro-
 pean countries. That tone was evident in the final
 declaration, in which the two leaders expressed
 "complete identity of views with regard to the
 present world situation." The Soviet leader laid a
 wreath at the tomb of a revolutionary patriot,
 spoke at a mass rally, got an award and opened a
 vocational school in Havana.
 l-he  declaration  contained copious refer-
 ences to increasing the effectiveness of bilateral
 cooperation, wider contacts between Soviet and
 Cuban  personnel, and the  integration of the
 Cuban economy into CEMA. The Soviets clearly
 intend to keep close supervision over the Cuban
 economy. There was no mention of future mili-
 tary assistance, but Brezhnev ,probably agreed to
 consider    Cuban  requests for  more  modern
 weapons. Cuban     Armed  Forces Minister Raul
 Castro flew to Moscow the clay after Brezhnev
 arrived home.
 There had  been rumors that the Soviets
 would press Castro to improve relations with the
 US, and a Soviet news item released after Brezh-
 nev's departure hinted at this. Although Castro
 praised detente and Brezhnev's personal efforts
 toward this goal, neither leader publicly referred
 to US-Cuban relations. Castro seems to have been
 satisfied that Cuba's interests will not be com-
 promised in Moscow's bilateral dealings with the
 US. This is evident in the declaration's support
 Airport farewell: Brezhnev and Castro
 for ending both the "blockade" of Cuba and the
 US presence at the Guantanamo naval base.
 Neither side criticized China by name, but
 Castro's implicit criticism of Peking and his en-
 dorsement of Moscow's Asian collective security
 proposal brought his regime closer to the Soviet
 viewpoint than ever before. While the declaration
 endorsed international communist unity, there
 was no mention of a world communist conference
 and no confirmation that a rumored meeting of
 Latin American communist leaders took place in
 Cuba during the visit.
 Moscow's restraining influence on Havana is
 most clearly reflected in the declaration's rejec-
 tion of the use of force in international relations
 and in its call for respect for sovereignty and
 territorial integrity in the Western Hemisphere. At
 the same time, this language falls short of the
 explicit rejection of communist export of revolu-
 tion,  which  Brezhnev  included in his Havana
 speech. The declaration also includes a con-
 demnation of "imperialist" efforts to interfere in
 Latin American internal affairs, a statement to
 which both sides could warmly subscribe.

 CI( Daniel Oduber of the governing National
 Liberation Party emerged victorious in the elec-

 years. His program is not expected to differ signif-

 efficient  instrument  in  promoting his  party's
 social and economic programs.

 officer
 9'9  cthe years of 1 to 2 percent inflation are
 gone, but one objective of the new government
 will be to keep inflation well below the 15 to 20
 percent experienced in 1973. Oduber's monetary
 and fiscal policies will therefore be more con-
 servative than those of Figueres, and he is ex-
 pected to support new tax measures. In dealing
 with rural poverty, he plans to continue many of
 the present administration's programs, especially
 the agricultural extension service. He will also
 concentrate on extension of credit, formation of
 cooperatives, and the creation of programs to deal
 with unemployment and under-employment.
 k  I Vhe task of making an efficient team out of
 Figudres' sprawling bureaucracy is one particu-
 larly suited to Oduber's talents. He is a good
 administrator and firm disciplinarian. As foreign
 minister from 1962 to 1964, he managed to pro-

 it to the needs of the nation. He has been de-

 Q
 Controls on capital movements have been    near its level prior to January 19 when Paris let
 relaxed in a number of European countries since the franc float,  while other major  European
 mid-January in an effort to bring in more capital currencies-except the Italian lira-have regained
 and help offset the higher cost of oil imports. the levels they held before the announcement of
 ? Bonn lowered the cost of foreign bor-
 rowing while doubling the amount that may
 be borrowed;
 ?  Brussels  suspended  its  prohibition
 against interest payments on bank accounts
 held by non-residents;
 ? Bern lifted its ban on foreign purchases
 of domestic securities;
 ? Paris relaxed restrictions on foreign bor-
 rowing and lowered the cost to French banks
 of accepting deposits from non-residents.
 These moves reverse the trend toward greater
 regulation of capital flows that was evident during
 the financial crises last year.
 The relaxation of controls on capital in-
 flows-coupled with the removal of US restric-
 tions on dollar outflows-was reflected in a weak-
 ening of the dollar on major exchange markets
 last week. The French franc has now returned to
 oil price hikes by the OPEC producers.
 Over the longer term, the relaxation of con-
 trols  will  increase  capital  mobility  between
 domestic and the Eurocurrency markets. This
 should facilitate a flow  from the Arab oil-
 producing countries, which have been accumu-
 lating reserves since the oil price hikes, to oil-
 consuming countries that experience deficits. The
 bulk of the payments deficits resulting from
 higher oil prices will probably be financed in this
 manner as well as by government borrowing in
 the Eurodollar market.
 In a related development, the International
 Monetary Fund has moved to facilitate short-term
 financing of oil-related balance-of-payments defi-
 cits. In late January, the fund approved the Bank
 for International Settlements in Basel, Switzer-
 land, as a holder of special drawing rights. The
 Swiss bank, often described as the central bank
 for other central banks, will now be able to ac-
 cept special drawing rights as collateral in its loans
