 DCI BRIEFING FOR
 RIVERS SUBCOMMITTEE
 CUBAN SUBVERSIVE ACTIVITIES IN LATIN AMERICA
 1.   The recent Castro-supported guerrilla outbreaks
 in Bolivia,  and Cuban involvement in the in-
 surgent landing in Venezuela on May 8th are
 the most recent indications of Fidel Castro's
 long-standing determination to spread revolu-
 tionary violence in Latin America.   Tangible
 Cuban support for revolutionary activity in
 Latin America has been at a somewhat lower
 level over the past two years than during the
 peak period from 1961 to 1963.   This does not,
 however, reflect any weakening of Fidel Castro's
 determination to spread his revolution.
 May 18th the Castro regime once again proclaimed
 its determination to "fulfill its duty of sol-
 idarity" with revolutionaries around the world.
 A.   Castro agreed,  at an extraordinary meeting
 Latin American Communist parties held in
 Havana in November,  1964,  that he would
 stop supporting would-be insurgent groups
 which were not under the control of the
 orthodox pro-Moscow Communists.

 1.   He has continued,  however,  to give
 moral, material,  and financial support
 and training to such groups in Vene-
 zuela,  Colombia, and Guatemala, and
 most recently Bolivia, his four pri-
 hqs
 ority targets at present.   He,made it
 b-.sreceit s?e.ec12as
 clear in                             that he
 does not feel bound by the 1964 agree-
 ment.
 B.    On March 13th, he repeated his persistent
 thesis that violent revolution is necessary
 to bring about any meaningful political
 and social change in Latin America--a theme
 also used in a May Day speech by Acting
 Minister of Armed Forces Almeida.
 1.    Castro accused the orthodox Communist
 parties which do not support dissident
 insurgent groups--in Venezuela and
 Colombia,  for example--of cowardice and
 betrayal.
 2.    He appeared particularly irked that a
 Soviet delegation has been attempting
 to improve relations and expand trade
 in some of the countries--Colombia and

 Venezuela in particular--where he hopes
 to develop revolutions.            In specific
 reference to the Soviet Union, he com-
 plained that members of the Communist
 camp who deal with oligarchies in
 countries where insurgents are active
 are betraying the revolutionaries.
 C.    Castro's statements continue to reflect
 his intense disillusionment with the urban-
 based pro-Moscow Communist parties.   They
 indicate that he will place even greater
 emphasis on the rural guerrilla movements,
 which frequently operate independently of
 the regular parties.
 1.   In his March 13th speech,  Castro stated:
 "If,  in any nation,  those who call them-
 selves Communists do not know how to
 fulfill their duty, we will support
 those who--even though they do not call
 themselves Communists--behave like real
 Communists in the struggle."
 2.   This was a crystal-clear renunciation
 of the November 1964 agreement.   Castro
 was saying that wherever the orthodox

 Communist parties refuse to seek the
 violent road of revolution to seize
 power, he will ignore the party lead-
 ers and work with militant extremists
 who are ready to fight.
 II..  In those Latin American countries where there
 is no significant insurgency under way,  the
 Cubans have been concentrating for the past
 two years on developing a support mechanism
 while they wait for a suitable opportunity and
 adequate assets.
 A.   The Cubans continue to provide some ideolog-
 ical                                   and guerrilla warfare training to
 militants from several Latin American coun-
 tries.
 1.   This is by no means a maximum figure
 for the guerrilla potential.   Many of
 these trainees in turn trained others

 when they returned to their home coun-
 tries.   A few, however, probably became
 disillusioned with the difficulties of
 initiating armed revolution, and left
 the field to more willing martyrs.

 The Cubans have been able to bring about in-
 ternational cooperation of national move-
 ments and parties in some areas.   This has
 helped to create or strengthen infrastructures

 upon which future revolutionary activities
 can be built,  by making it easier to channel
 funds, move agents and leaders,  transmit
 communications, and obtain false documents.

 III.    Castro's fervent appeals to Latin American ex-
 tremists to carry out armed struggles in their
 countries betray a certain amount of frustration
 over his program's lack of success,  and the lack
 of enthusiasm it engenders among the pro-Moscow
 Communists in Latin America.

 A.   Several important Communist Party leaders
 were quick to criticize Castro's revolu-
 tionary strategy after his pointed attack
 on the Moscow-oriented parties in his
 speech on July 26th,  1966.   At that time,
 he called them "pseudo-revolutionaries,',
 who lacked the courage to follow the path
 of armed struggle,
 B.   Despite the fiery declarations of the
 January 1966 Tri-Continent Conference in
 Havana, and the subsequent general call
 for insurgency in Latin America, no measur-
 able continent-wide response has been noted.
 In fact,  some potential insurgent movements
 have lost rather than gained ground during
 the last year or two,  although pro-Castro
 insurgents in Colombia,  Venezuela,  and
 Bolivia have very recently shown signs of
 new life.
 1.   An outgrowth of the Tri-.Continent Con-
 Terence--the Latin American Solidarity
 Organization--is to hold its first meet-
 ing in Havana in late July.   The efficacy

 of the strategy of violent revolution
 in Latin America will certainly be one
 of the main themes.
 2.   It will. also give the Cubans an excel-
 lent chance to offer more training,
 propaganda guidelines, and possibly
 funds to the leaders of various groups
 of the extreme left who will be attend-
 ing the conference.
 C.   For the past year,  inflammatory propaganda
 has constituted Cuba's most consistent sup-
 port for insurgency in the hemisphere.   The
 emphasis has shifted somewhat from the
 strident calls for immediate armed action
 in the early days of the Castro regime.
 1.    The current emphasis is more on laying
 a solid foundation for future revolu-
 tionary action,  attempting to unite
 feuding factions of the extreme left,
 and extolling those revolutionaries who
 are willing to take up the fight, re-
 gardless of whether they are bonafide
 Communists.

 2.    Havana now is broadcasting about 175
 hours a week to Latin America, primarily
 in Spanish and Portuguese.   There is
 also,  however,  propaganda in French and
 Creole for Haiti, Guarani  (Gwah-rabl-NEE)
 for Paraguay,  and Quechua (KETCH-WAH)
 for Bolivia.   The Quechua schedule for
 Bolivia was increased from 1--1/2 hours
 per week to seven on March 31st--just
 one week after the first successful
 Bolivian guerrilla attack.
 D.   The extent of guerrilla activity in Latin
 American countries is directly related, of
 course, to how dissatisfied the people of
 a given country may be over social injus-
 tices and the lack of economic opportunity,
 and what chance there appears to be for
 reform.
 1.    Cuban propaganda takes the line that
 the ruling oligarchies have frustrated
 and will continue to defeat all attempts
 to change existing conditions by legal,
 parliamentary methods.

 2.   Therefore, Havana Radio argues,  the so-
 called "via pacifica" or peaceful path
 of reform sought by many of the orthodox
 Communist parties is ineffective,  and
 the only course is armed struggle.
 IV.    I propose at this point to examine Cuban goals
 and activities in the individual Latin American
 target countries, beginning with active insur-
 gent movements in Venezuela, Colombia, Guatemala,
 and Bolivia.
 Venezuela (Map)
 V.     Cuba actively supports Communist insurgency in
 Venezuela which heads Castro's list of Latin
 American targets.

 C.   The other,  and larger, guerrilla group that
 Castro supports is called the F.A.L.N., or
 Armed Forces of National Liberation.   This
 group began operations more than five years
 ago as the combined paramilitary arm of the
 militant Communists and the M.I.R.

 1.  In :19963,  the F.A.L.N. pulled off such
 dramatic feats as the hijacking of a
 Venezuelan freighter,  the ANZOATEGUI,
 and bombing the U.S. Embassy' in Caracas.
 It launched major campaigns of urban
 terrorism,  sabotage,  and rural guer-
 rilla raids in an effort to forestall
 the visit to Washington of President
 Betancourt,  and the subsequent Venezue-
 lan national elections.
 2.   When the F.A.L.N.   failed to achieve
 these goals, and also failed to attract
 any substantial sympathy in the country-
 side,  the orthodox Communist leadership
 decided that its achievements were not
 worth the damage they were doing to the
 Party's political image, and tried to
 tone down the militancy.
 D.   The orders of the Politburo, however, were
 defied publicly by the F.A.L.N.  leader,
 Douglas Bravo, who announced that he would

 E.    The Venezuelan government, reacting to the
 terrorist murder of the Foreign Minister's
 brother on March 1,  the increasing guer-
 rilla forays in the countryside,  and now
 Cuban involvement in  the May 8th landing,
 plans to protest in the Organization of
 American States against Cuban subversion.
 1.   It is difficult, however,  to determine
 what further sanctions the O.A.S. can
 apply beyond those already taken
 against Cuba.
 2,   Castro is unmoved.   In his March 13
 speech,  after denying Cuban Involvement
 in the murder of the Venezuelan foreign

 minister's brother, Castro praised the
 guerrillas,  and implied that they would
 continue to receive full Cuban support.
 Colombia (Map)
 VI.    There has recently been renewed and intensified
 guerrilla activity in Colombia, which Castro
 highlights along with Venezuela as being in the
 forefront of those countries "struggling against
 imperialism."
 A.    There has been banditry in Colombia for
 400 years,  since the days of the Conquis-
 tadores.   Traditionally,  it has varied from
 outright outlawry to political warfare.
 1.    In recent years, many thousands were
 killed in the bloody fighting between
 Liberal and Conservative Party parti-
 sans which raged for five years after
 the assassination in 1948 of Liberal
 leader Jorge Gaitan.  Revulsion over
 the bloodbath created the opening for
 the country's last military dictator,
 General Rojas,  to take power.

 2.   Strong gangs variously described as
 bandits or Communists have been operat-
 ing for years in the rugged mountains
 south of Bogota.   These areas are often
 referred to as Communist enclaves.             In
 recent years,  Communists have taken
 over the leadership of some of these
 gangs, have established influence over
 others, or converted the bandit chief-
 tains to Communism.
 3,   These are remote areas where even the
 army operates only with difficulty, and
 the peasant has little sense of identity
 with any national government.
 4.   It might be said that there are only
 half a dozen of these enclaves,  in out-
 of-the-way regions.   But the same state-
 ment could have been made with equal
 validity about South Vietnam in 1959,
 when there were only half a dozen areas
 of Viet Cong activity.
 5.   It is worth noting that where inroads
 have been made against these Communist
 enclaves,  it has been as a result of

 aries can be expected to be in the forefront
 of future disorders which might take place.
 B.    Ecuador's long history of instability should
 afford a fertile ground for a Castro-oriented
 insurgent movement.   The perpetual disorgan-

 of leadership among all Ecuadorean political

 leadership among the various Ecuadorean rev-

 Cubans to conclude that revolutionary pros-

 DCI BRIEFING FOR
 RIVERS SUBCOMMITTEE
 23 May 1967
 CHINESE DOMESTIC DEVELOPMENTS
 1.   The Chinese Cultural Revolution is regaining its
 frenzy after a brief lull in February and March.
 On the surface, there is a renewed and perhaps
 final drive to destroy the titular Chief of
 State, Liu Shao-chi.   Behind this facade,  the
 extremist elements around Mao Tse-tung and Lin
 Piao appear to be locked in struggle with more
 moderate forces led by Premier Chou En-lai.
 A.         Mao, Lin and Chou maintain the appearance
 of unity in public; Chou remains the chief
 spokesman for the regime.  Lin has again ap-
 peared in public after an absence of almost
 five months.   We believe that their alliance
 is at best very shaky and uneasy.
 B.   The unleashing of Red Guards last month led
 immediately to reports of new outbreaks of
 violence.
 1.  We are uncertain how much credence to
 give these reports, most of which are being
 circulated by Red Guard groups themselves.

 2.    According to poster reports, a particularly
 brutal incident occurred on May 6th in
 the western Chinese city of Chengtu, where
 troops allegedly used machine guns and
 grenades to kill or wound 2,000 Red
 Gii rds
 25X1
 25X1
 II.      After the Cultural Revolution had brought the
 country to the brink of chaos in January,  order
 and discipline were restored in most areas largely
 as a result of efforts by Chou En-lai.
 A.   Chou's most important role in that period was
 to reassure the army,  and to make it a more
 responsive instrument of control.   He did
 this b7 damping down a purge which had been
 launched in the army, and by issuing a series
 of policies moderating the Cultural Revolution.

 III.   His actions were grudgingly supported by Mao and
 Lin at the time.   But they were hotly debated,
 and in some cases reversed
 A.   A major effort seems to be under way to re-
 move military commanders,  both in Peking
 and the provinces, who were vigorous in im-
 plementing the directives Chou pushed through,
 even when that meant arresting unruly Red
 Guards.

 IV.   Vicious Red Guard poster attacks are now being
 aimed at Chou's proteges in the government,  and
 at top military men who are being held responsible
 for letting the Cultural Revolution subside in

 February. A common thread running through the
 charges against these men is that they resisted
 extremist policies desired by Mao and Lin.
 A.   The military men under attack--Yeh Chien-
 ying (YEH JYAN-YING) and Hsu Hsiang-chien
 (SHOO SHYANG-CHYAN)--had worked very closely
 with Mao and Lin until recently.   Both are
 politburo members and vice chairmen of the
 powerful Military Affairs Committee.   Hsu
 (SHOO) was named head of the special army
 purge group formed on January 11.
 1.   Now,  however,  they are accused of oppos-
 ing Lin Piao at a recent meeting of the
 Military Affairs Committee, and of saying
 that Lin was not fit to be Mao's successor.
 B.   In recent weeks a main target of Red Guard
 posters and demonstrations has been Chou's
 protege, Foreign Minister Chen Yi.
 1.   The foreign minister has been criticized
 before,  but never this harshly.   He is
 now accused of being a "counterrevolutionary
 revisionist" who has opposed Lin Piao and
 followed the line of the disgraced chief
 of state, Liu Shao-chi.

 2.   Chen Yi continues to perform ceremonial
 duties,  but he is clearly in serious
 trouble.
 C.    So far, Chou has not come to the defense of
 his proteges during the new wave of attacks.
 With his usual flexibility, he is adjusting
 to the latest political winds, with his own
 status uppermost in his mind.
 1.   Chou is still running 'the day-to-day work
 of the regime.   This could be by default,
 however,  and not necessarily a reflection
 of his political powers.   He is 69,  but
 he is the only one of the ruling triumvirate
 who is physically strong enough to put
 in a full day?s work.
 2.    He does not have many people left to help
 him.   Last August,  25 men were installed
 in the politburo; today,  only seven of
 them are still active and in apparent good
 standing--Mao, Lin, Chou, one propagandist,
 two security chiefs, and one economic
 planner.
 V.   Looking into the future,  no end to the Chinese
 political crisis is in sight.

 A.   Instability and confusion are likely to persist
 as long as Mao Tse-tung retains effective power.
 B.   After Mao goes, we expect a disorderly and
 contentious struggle over the succession.
 1.   The military may play a decisive role,
 but Lin Piao would not necessarily be
 their candidate.   A collective including
 Chou En-lai and military leaders might
 emerge.
 2.   We believe that ultimately many of Mao's
 radical dogmas and practices are likely
 to be set aside,  but this might be a
 gradual process.
 C.   The political crisis has focused the leader-
 ship's energies and attention on  internal
 affairs,  and has damaged Chinese prestige
 abroad.
 1.   For the most part, Peking has maintained
 foreign policy positions which were well
 established before the Cultural Revolution.
 It has tended, however,  to become more
 rigid in its major areas of preoccupation--
 Vietnam and the Sino-Soviet dispute.

 2.   As long as Maoists retain control,  deep
 hostility to the US and the USSR is likely
 to remain the predominant feature of Chi-
 nese foreign policy
 3.   If the internal policy eventually shifts
 in the direction of moderation,  this could

 DCI BRIEFING FOR
 RIVERS SUBCOMMITEE
 The Chinese Communists have begun a pressure
 campaign against the British in Hong Kong,
 similar to the one they directed against the
 Portuguese in Macao last December and January.
 A CO. (3
 A.    You may recall that in the case of N600.
 the Chinese maintained the pressure until
 the Portuguese authorities made an abject
 and public apology to Chinese Communist
 organizations in Macao, in effect admitting
 that the Chinese were the real masters
 of the colony.
 1.   It was reminiscent of the demands early
 in the 19th century that foreigners must
 "kow tow" before the Imperial Throne.
 B.    In Hong Kong,  the Chinese are probably not
 prepared to challenge British control at this
 time.   For one thing,  Peking earns about
 $550 million a year in foreign exchange
 through Hong Kong.

 Approved Foleas$
 1.    The objectives are probably more limited.
 Peking may want to weaken British control
 by bringing enough pressure to force the
 Hong Kong authorities into public conces-
 sions to the leftist groups which are
 stirring up trouble.  This would also in-
 crease public support for the Communists
 in the Crown Colony.
 II.                  On the surface,  the disputes are economic issues-
 strikes at a cement plant and a plastic flowers
 factory.   Leftists have turned the strikes into
 riots, in order to raise the target from plant
 management to the Hong Kong government.
 A. The British, who believe that a strong line
 might have served the Portuguese better in
 Macao, seem determined not to give in.   They
 have mobilized the police reserve, alerted
 the British Army garrison, and slapped a
 curfew on part of Kowloon, the mainland part
 of Hong Kong.
 B. On May 15,  the Chinese Communist Foreign
 Ministry handed a statement to the British
 charge in Peking, warning that the British face
 "grave consequences" unless they immediately

 accept all of the leftist demands,  release
 those arrested,  offer apologies,  and promise
 that there will be no recurrence of the re-
 pression.
 C.   Peking emphasized its strong support for the
 leftist campaign against the Hong Kong Gov-
 ernment on May 18 when Chou En-lai and other
 top leaders attended a mass rally in the
 capital called to denounce British actions
 in the colony.
 D.    As I said,  the Chinese Communists probably
 will not push the British as hard as they
 did the Portuguese.   I expect,  however,  that
 Peking will exert enough pressure to learn
 what concessions the British would make to
 avoid a crisis, protracted riots, and perhaps
 strikes cutting off the utilities.

 I.   In Vietnam,  the enemy build-up along the Demili-
 tarized Zone, which we have been watching for
 several months, was first dramatized April 6th
 and 7th by the major Communist raids in and
 around Quang Tri city and Hue, the capitals of
 South Vietnam's two northernmost provinces.
 A.    The tempo of enemy operations in northern I
 Corps has continued to accelerate in recent
 weeks, accompanied by heavy and well-coordi-
 nated mortar, rocket,  and artillery bombard-
 ment of U.S. Marine positions just south of
 the D.M.Z.  in Quang Tri Province.
 B.    In late April U.S. Marines engaged elements
 of two North Vietnamese regiments in nearly
 two weeks of sustained heavy fighting near
 Khe Sanh in the western region of Quang Tri
 Province.   The battle for control of three
 strategic hills astride key enemy infiltration
 routes into Quang Tri from both Laos and
 the DMZ proved very costly to both sides,

 as reflected in Communist losses of 800 con-
 firmed killed  (plus an additional 600 es-
 timated killed)   and US losses of 133 killed
 and 383 wounded.
 C.   US Marines and South Vietnamese Army forces
 on May 18 began a three-pronged offensive
 aginnst North Vietnamese regulars--numbering
 approximately 9,000 men--south of the Ben
 Hai River in the DMZ and in the northeastern
 section of northernmost Quang Tri Province.
 Only moderate enemy resistance was met in
 the opening phase, as 12 allied battalions
 swept the area in search of the enemy and his
 supply points.   Cumulative casualties reported
 theol
 on 22 May show more tie-550 Communists killed,
 in contrast to allied losses of 83 killed and
 648 wounded.
 D.   Early this year elements of the North Vietnamese

 Quang Tri and Thua Thien provinces,  subse-

 Vietnam by June.         Of these three major
 battlefields, the western highlands of Pleiku

 of prime importance to the Communists'  over-
 all strategic objectives in the northern half
 of South Vietnam.
 B.    A threat to such towns as Quang Tri and Hue
 cannot be ruled out, but the Communists seem
 more likely to undertake actions designed to
 protect their infiltration routes through
 Laos and the western DMZ area, and to keep
 allied forces spread out.
 1.   The Communists have stepped up their

 III.   The Communists are maintaining a replacement

 according to documents captured in March and
 April during operation JUNCTION CITY, the
 spoiling operation in the Communist War Zone

 Central Office for South Vietnam.
 B.   The Viet Cong Ninth Division, composed of
 the North Vietnamese 101st and the Viet

 A.   MAC-V figures for enemy mortar,  rocket, and
 artillery attacks--excluding enemy reaction
 to operations initiated by our side--show
 that in 1966 there were an average of 60
 such incidents per month.
 1.    In 1967 there were 44 incidents in Jan-
 uary,  51 in February, but 141 in March
 and 100 in April.
 2.    This increase is compounded by a greater
 number of rounds per incident, and
 heavier projectiles.
 B.   General Westmoreland's headquarters estimates
 that the weight of the incoming barrages was
 less than ten tons altogether during the last
 six months of 1967--but 49.4 tons for March
 and April alone in 1967.
 C.   This would seem to give added significance to
 our observations that the enemy was able to
 move 15 to 20 thousand tons of supplies south,
 to or across the South Vietnamese border, by
 daylight during the four-day Lunar New Year
 truce in mid-February.
 D.    The enemy has brought a number of new weapons
 into play in the first quarter of 1967.   In
 1966, his heaviest bombardment weapon was the
 120-millimeter mortar.

 V.    The forthcoming presidential election in South
 Vietnam, scheduled for 3 September,  is becoming
 complicated by the rivalry between Premier Ky
 and Chief of State Thieu.
 A.   Ky has already announced that he will run,
 and Thieu has all but committed himself to
 do likewise.
 1.    Previously, the armed forces leadership
 had announced that it would not formally
 back a candidate, hoping to avoid taking
 sides between Ky and Thieu.
 2.    If the two men do run against each other,
 however, they will split the military
 vote,  and could touch off severe divisions
 in military unity..
 3.    On the other hand, if only one military
 man eventually runs, his chances for
 victory are fairly strong, since the army
 is the only effective national organization.
 B.   Only two of seven civilian candidates, assembly
 president Phan Khac Suu and former premier Tran
 Van Huong, seem to have any substantial support.
 Both appeal largely to southerners in the delta
 area, and therefore could cancel each other out.

 VI.   Meanwhile, the local elections for village and

 fairly well.
 A.    Despite considerable voter apathy and some
 reluctance by candidates to risk Viet Cong
 retaliation, voter turn-out in areas where
 elections were held averaged 78 percent for
 the five Sundays of voting for 984 village
 councils.
 B.    In these elections the Viet Cong killed 12
 and kidnaped 31 of the candidates.
 C.    Voting for some 4,600 hamlet chiefs which
 began on May 14th, has proceeded with about
 the same amount of voter participation and
 Viet Cong harassment.
 VII.    North Vietnamese officials have not withdrawn
 their offer to consider talks with the U.S.  in

 this concession is as far as they are prepared

 N E W    L E A D
 ARAB-ISRAELI  SITUATION
 I.   The Arab-Israeli confrontation this morning has
 reached a critical point.   An incident,  an accident,
 or a miscalculation could result in war.
 A.        Neither side 11 wants a full-blown war, but the
 moves and counter-moves of the past week or
 10 days have evoked a chain of reactions
 which are now perhaps beyond the control of
 the leaders on\e4thdr sides-
 B.                                      The most dangerous development overnight has
 been the defiant statement by UAR President
 Nasir that he is closing the Gulf of Aqaba
 to Israeli shipping and to any ships carrying
 strategic cargoes to the Israeli port of Eilat
 at the head of the Gulf.
 C.   We believe that interference with Israeli
 shipping to Eilat is one of the contingencies
 which Israeli security policy rates as a
 cause of war.
 1.     In 1956,  the Israelis took Sharm al-Shaykh,
 the Egyptian headland which dominates the
 shipping channel into the southern end of

 The Gulf of Aqaba,  and spiked the Egyptian
 guns which had been guarding the Strait.
 2.    Since then,  a detachment of the United
 Nations Emergency Force has been stationed
 at Sharm-al-Shaykh, but it is now withdrawing.
 4.    Egypt also has submarines and guided missile
 patrol boats in the Gulf of Suez.   They could
 quickly move into position to guard the
 entry into the Gulf of Aqaba.
 D.   War could result from this situation,  from the
 Israeli ground and air patrolling to monitor
 Egyptian moves near the Israeli border, or
 from continued Palestinian raids into Israel,
 provoking Israeli retaliation and a Syrian
 call for Egyptian help.

 I.   The current Arab-Israeli crisis is an outgrowth
 of the Palestinian terrorist harassment of
 Israel which has been supported by Syria.
 A.    Two recent incidents--on May 5th and 8th--
 were particularly responsible for causing
 the subsequent buildup of military forces
 in Israel, Syria, and Egypt.
 2.   At the time,  Israeli officials said those
 incidents were the 13th and 14th since
 the Israeli-Syrian air clash in early
 April.

 began to build up in Israel in favor of
 some kind of counterattack.   Official
 spokesmen, led by Prime Minister Eshkol
 and Army Chief of Staff Rabin, publicly
 warned again that unless the sabotage
 ceased, Israel would punish Syria for its
 support of the terrorists.

 II. Following the Israeli warnings, the Syrian
 Government became genuinely concerned about
 the prospect of another round with Israel,

 III. The response in Egypt has been, of course, more
 clear in terms of the support Cairo appears
 ready to give to Syria in the event of an
 Israeli attack.
 A.   Egypt has a joint defense agreement with
 Syria.   Moreover, during Syria's disastrous
 engagement with the Israelis in April,
 Cairo was conspicuously silent--a silence
 which the Jordanians were quick to point
 out.
 B. For these reasons--intimately tied up with
 Nasir's prestige as an Arab leader--Nasir
 realized he probably would have to intervene
 in the next major Israeli-Syrian clash.
 Egypt

 began a series of moves which have strengthened 25X1

 the steps that    ve been taken which would

 The                           posture assumed by
 Egypt, and the widespread publicity that has
 been accorded its military preparations,

 of these moves will discourage any aggressive
 Israeli intentions.

 V.       The withdrawal of the 3,400-man U.N. Emergency
 Force  (UNEF)  has removed one of the deterrents
 to trouble along the border,
 A.   Nasir initially asked UNEF to congregate its
 troops in Gaza,  "to ensure their safety."
 U Thant, however,  refused to agree to any
 such curtailment of UNEF's operations,  and
 this apparently forced Nasir to follow through
 by requesting its complete withdrawal.   He
 clearly was moved to take some action to re-
 move UNEF because of past Jordanian criticism
 about his  "hiding behind a UN shield."
 B.    U Thant saw no legal basis for resisting
 Nasir's demand, and the withdrawal is now
 under way.   The Secretary-General arrived in
 Cairo on 22 May to seek some other means of
 preserving peace along the border, and he
 probably will try to reactivate the Egyptian-
 Israeli Mixed Armistice Commission.   Israel,
 which repudiated the commission in 1956, has
 indicated it would oppose this.
 VI.   The key to the situation probably lies with the
 Palestinian terrorists.
 A.     They're still making forays into Israel--

 the Israelis even-
 tually may be compelled to strike back.   They
 almost certainly would take some action if
 Israeli lives are lost as a result of the
 sabotage.   There haven't been any fatalities
 in recent weeks, however.
 B.      Syria shows no sign of trying to restrain the
 terrorists, if indeed it could do so.   Foreign
 Minister Makhus told our ambassador in Damascus
 on 20 May that the Syrian government "once and
 for all" disclaimed any responsibility for the
 actions of the Palestinian extremists.
 C.    The Jordanians, incidentally, are trying harder
 than ever to prevent the terrorist incursions
 from Jordanian territory, and we doubt that
 Israel would punish them again for terrorism
 which King Husayn's regime opposes.

 I.   The recent crisis in our relations with the
 Egyptian puppet regime in Yemen centered on a
 completely fraudulent charge that two American
 AID employees--accused by the Yemenis of being
 CIA personnel--fired bazookas at an ammunition
 dump in an effort to blow up the city of Taiz.
 A.    Four bazooka rounds were, in fact, fired
 at a camp of the Egyptian 85th Parachute
 Battalion, not far from the U.S.  residential
 compound outside Taiz.   At least two men
 were killed.   The Egyptians and Yemenis say
 dogs followed a scent from the scene of the
 firing to the U.S. compound, and that
 bazooka rounds were found in the compound.
 B.   The facts are that the two AID representatives
 are not CIA personnel,  and that they were
 in the compound,  in the company of other
 Americans, at the time the shots were fired.

 3.       The two AID employees were never
 formally indicted, and were well-treated
 while in custody.   They were finally

 II.    Four days after the arrests,  the Egyptians began
 to realize that they could make propaganda points
 whether or not they could ultimately prove the
 involvement of AID officials.   Top Egyptian
 authorities began controlling the handling of
 the investigation.
 A.   Cairo took the line, however, that the
 quarrel was between Yemen and the U.S.,
 with Egypt as the honest broker arranging
 for release of the prisoners.
 B.   The Yemenis, probably at Egyptian direction,
 have asked for closure of the Taiz office,
 claiming that it is "unsafe" for Americans,

 I. Communist insurgents are intensifying their
 activities in northeast Thailand in an apparent
 attempt to counter government security programs
 there.
 A.   During March the insurgents initiated 30 per-
 cent more armed encounters than in February.
 1.   This means an average of one clash a day,
 and matches the number started by govern-
 ment forces.
 2.   A marked rise in casualties was noted on
 both sides.
 B.   Although the picture is not clear, there are
 indications that the insurgents are tailoring
 their effort to meet a government security
 program begun last January in areas of known
 Communist strength.
 1.   The guerrillas have apparently attempted
 to avoid direct confrontation with large
 security units.   In some cases the guer-

 I.   In India, the food crisis is going to become even
 worse this summer, and it will remain acute at
 least until the end of this year.
 A. The second straight year of drought in some
 of the major grain regions is going to reduce
 this fall's harvest.
 B. On top of that, the summer monsoons will make
 roads impassable, creating serious distribu-

 1.   Many of the areas hardest hit by food
 shortages can be reached only by road.
 II.    The slim Congress Party majority in Parliament
 remains intact, but only eight of India's 17
 states are under Congress control.
 A. Strained relations between the Congress Party
 central government and non-Congress state
 governments could create additional food sup-
 ply and other problems.
 B. Several of the non-Congress state governments
 are shaky coalitions that may not last long.

 DCI BRIEFING FOR
 RIVERS SUBCOMMITTEE
 PANAMA NEGOTIATIONS
 I.  Negotiations with Panama for a new canal treaty
 have entered a crucial stage.   From here on in,
 the Panamanians are bound to look at them as a
 major issue in the campaign for their presi-
 dential elections in May, 1968.
 A.   President Robles,  in a speech on his return
 from Punta del Este, said he was elated over
 his meeting with President Johnson, and
 hopeful that the canal talks could be finished
 within the time frame set by the Panamanians.
 B.   Robles sent Foreign Minister Eleta to New
 York on May 8 to wind up the canal treaty
 negotiations

 C.    The Panamanians want a draft treaty completed
 in time to be ratified by a special assembly
 session late this summer.   Robles feels that
 he needs at least six weeks before the special
 session for an intensive campaign to "sell"
 the merits of the new agreement to the country.

 1.   If ratification is delayed until the
 regular session begins on October 1,
 the pressures of the presidential cam-
 paign will make it increasingly difficult
 to hold the fragile government coalition
 of seven parties together.
 II.   Opposition leader Arnulfo Arias and his mass-based
 Panamenista Party have begun to step up attacks on
 the efforts to reach a canal settlement with the U.S.
 A.    Arias claims he was robbed in the 1964 presi-
 dential election,  and that the present regime
 is therefore illegal and does not represent a
 majority of the people.   As a result,  "the
 people" will reject any canal agreement reached
 by the Robles regime regardless of its content.
 B.    Arias has not yet decided whether to run again
 in 1968.   He is convinced the election would be
 rigged against him,  and might prefer to abstain,
 claim fraud,  and then try to seize power by
 force.

 DOMINICAN REPUBLIC
 I.   There has been some deterioration recently in
 the political position of President Balaguer.
 A.   He has come under intensified attack from
 the left and the "anti-Trujillo" right over
 such issues as the government's failure to
 prevent or solve sporadic incidents of po-
 litical terrorism and the presence of as-
 sociates of Trujillo in the government.
 B.    Moderates have been critical of the Presi-
 dent's failure to respond positively to re-
 sponsible criticism.
 II.   There is no available evidence that this dis-
 satisfaction has yet been translated into ser-
 ious plotting that threatens the government.
 A.   Balaguer still appears to be accepted by
 most of the military and has the enthusi-
 astic backing of some officers.

 B.    Nevertheless, if trends evident over the
 last few months continue there will be in-
 creasing polarization into pro- and anti-
 Balaguer elements and the chance of a
 serious threat to stability will increase.
