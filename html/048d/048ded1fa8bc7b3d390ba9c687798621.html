 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 October 1957
 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 MIDDLE EAST DEVELOPMENTS
 The UN General Assembly
 voted to postpone discussion of
 the Syrian-Turkish issue until
 25 October  to  permit further
 efforts to reduce tension in
 the area through local inter-
 mediaries.
 The Turks' with military
 concentrations in the vicinity'
 of the Syrian border, are main-
 taining a state of readiness.
 Large-scale maneuvers have been
 rescheduled to begin on or
 about 1 November.   A major air
 deployment is expected prior
 to that date, probably on 29
 October.  Ankkra remains calm
 in the face of continuing So-
 viet threats and warnings.
 Syrian military prepara-
 tions appear to be gathering
 some momentum.  Tanks, troops
 and additional artillery have
 been moved toward the Turkish
 frontier.  Damascus radio has
 made much of the distribution
 of arms to the leftist-led
 "futuwa" resistance groups.
 Antiaircraft positions and anti-
 sabotage posts have been estab-
 lished in Latakia and Aleppo.
 Additional Egyptian units
 reportedly have been alerted
 to reinforce the 1,000-1 500
 troops already in Syria.
 The Jordanian government
 is still laboring under the dis-
 advantage that most Jordanians
 believe it is an instrument of
 Western "imperialism," while
 they look upon the Syrian re-
 gime as representing a truly
 "liberated" Arab state.   Six
 anti-Western members of the
 Jordanian parliament resigned

 last week  in  an attempt to
 counter the effect of the cabi-
 net's victory in a confidence
 vote And to embarrass the gov-
 ernment by depriving it of the
 necessary quorum of 27 out of
 a lower house of 40-members.
 The government has decided
 to hold by-elections for these
 six seats; it plans to deal with
 the problem of other vacancies
 created by the arrest and exile
 of seven other members when the
 quorum is restored.  However,
 the by-election almost certain-
 ly will be used by the Jorda-
 nian opposition as well as by
 Syrian and Egyptian agents as
 an occasion to step up their
 campaign of subversive propa-
 ganda, terrorist bombings, and
 sabotage.  The changes in the
 cabinet this week would seem
 to weaken still further any
 vestiges of popular support for
 the government.
 The Israelis are keeping
 quiet on the diplomatic front.
 The Israeli air attack on a
 Jordanian commercial transport
 near Aqaba appears to have been
 an isolated incident.
 Soviet Moves
 The USSR has intensified
 its efforts in the General As-
 sembly to rally support for the
 Syrian complaint.  On 20 Octo-
 ber,Gromyko met with the dele-
 gations of several Asian-African
 nations to impress on them So-
 viet willingness "to use force"
 if necessary to support Syria.
 Gromyko's 22 October speech in
 support of immediate General
 Assembly consideration of the
 Syrian situation restated So-
 viet willingness to join other
 members in suppressing any Turk-
 ish attack on Syria and again
 promised that the Soviet Union
 would "take all the necessary
 steps to extend assistance to
 the victim of aggression."
 This cannot be taken as a
 specific indication of Soviet
 intention to intervene unilat-
 erally.   The appointment of So-
 viet Marshal Konstantin Rokos-
 sovskiy--a commander well known
 in the West--to head the rela-
 tively unimportant Transcaucasus
 Military District probably was
 intended to heighten psychologi-
 cal pressure on Turkey.
 Moscow propaganda continues
 to exploit the alleged plot
 against Syria in an effort to
 foment world-wide anti-American
 sentiment and in particular to
 foster Arab suspicions of Ameri-
 can Middle East policy.   TASS,
 in a long "authorized" state-
 ment on 18 October, reviewed
 the history of the "plot" and
 revealed details of a "secret
 plan" of complex military opera-
 tions designed to overthrow
 the "legitimate government" of
 Syria and to establish a regime
 in American pay ready to con-
 form to American policy.
 Moscow's present heavy      14
 propaganda concentration on
 Syrian developments, the great-
 est volume devoted to the Mid-
 dle East since the attack on
 Egypt, now features charges
 that an American-planned, -in-
 stigated, and -assisted Turk-
 ish attack on Syria is   to
 take place shortly after the
 Turkish national elections on
 27 October.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMRARY
 FRENCH POLITICAL CRISIS
 Mollet's chances of ending
 France's political crisis have
 slipped in the face of wide-
 spread public criticism of his
 program.   While the full extent
 of assembly opposition will not
 be known until his investiture
 speech on 28 October, many
 deputies he had expected to at
 least abstain seem determined
 to vote against him.
 The atmosphere of wide-
 spread strikes and continuing
 financial deterioration may
 still aid Mollet's prospects,
 but both the Popular Republi-
 cans and the Independents ap-
 pear to be split on the ques-
 tion of  support.
 Much will depend on how
 well party leaders can limit
 the opposition to Mollet and
 the Socialists in each group.
 Some of Mollet's program which
 is expected to include reform
 aimed at improving government
 stability by suppressing con-
 fidence votes can be expected
 to alarm many deputies.  The
 French press, moreover, is
 unanimously dissatisfied with
 Mollet's program and believes
 that he would command a weak
 majority at best.
 Meanwhile France's finan-
 cial difficulties continue.
 Workers have become increasingly
 alarmed over price rises and
 union leaders have been pushed
 into strike agitation even
 though the government in its
 caretaker capacity has no au-
 thority to satisfy their griev-
 ances.   The one-day power strike
 on 16 October was effective be-
 cause foremen and technicians
 cooperated.   The success of
 that undertaking has encouraged
 the unions in plans for agita-
 tion on 25 October.  Although
 the Socialist-led Workers'
 Force has refused to participate,
 the Christian Workers' Federa-
 tion and the Communist Confed-
 eration--possibly supported by
 farmer demonstrations--plan
 nationwide work stoppages on 25
 October in a broad range of in-
 dustries.
 Even if Mollet wins in-
 vestiture he will be faced al-
 most immediately with the need
 to synthesize the budgetary pref-
 erences of business interests
 and his own party's social wel-
 fare aims.  There is little
 likelihood that he will be able
 to reduce the deficits of $2.5
 billion in the budget and $1
 billion in trade anticipated by
 the end  of 1957.   New slippage
 in the black-market franc val-
 ue to 461 to the dollar (the
 official rate is 420) has al-
 ready renewed speculation as
 to further devaluation, and
 Schuman indicated in his re-
 port that France may again have
 to'seek external aid.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENC;E WEEKLY SUMMARY
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 On the basis of committee
 discussion to date, American,
 British, French, and Canadian
 delegates in the United Nations
 believe that if the 24-power
 Western disarmament resolution
 can be brought to a vote before
 those being advanced by Japan
 and the USSR,   it  will  be
 adopted at this assembly by a
 comfortable margin.   If the
 Western proposal is not voted
 on first, however, the Japanese
 compromise proposal calling for
 a temporary suspension of nu-
 clear testing may provide a
 rallying point for the uncom-
 mitted countries anxious for
 some type of disarmament agree-
 ment, particularly on testing.
 The Western resolution was
 introduced only on 11 October
 and the General Assembly rules
 call for voting on proposals in
 the order in which submitted,
 unless a majority of members
 decides otherwise.
 The Soviet proposals for a
 two- to three-year test suspen-
 sion and a five-year renuncia
 tion of the use of nuclear weap-
 ons were introduced on 20 and
 23 September, but they do not
 appear to have sufficient sup-
 port, even if brought to an
 early vote.
 The Japanese proposal, which
 calls for an immediate suspen-
 tion of nuclear tests and for
 resumption of subcommittee ne-
 gotiations on supervision and
 inspection, was introduced on
 23 September.   It does not meet
 the West's demand for immediate
 supervision of the test ban or
 for the halting of nuclear weap-
 ons production.
 suspension proposals, such as
 Japan's probably would not be
 interpreted at home as favoring
 continued unrestricted testing.
 If a majority votes to take
 up the Western resolution out
 of order, governments with do-
 mestic public opinion problems
 about radiation could then as-
 sure their people that they had
 supported the only feasible test
 suspension proposal.   A negative
 vote thereafter on other test

 in the past six months,  the
 withdrawals apparently having
 been heaviest among the upper-
 middle peasants,  the most pro-
 ductive farmers.  The party
 plenum adopted an as yet un-
 specified revision,  the seventh
 since early 1956, in the draft
 long-range plan for agricul-
 ture-(1956-67).
 The People's Daily has
 editorially spoken-7-f-the
 "necessity and feasibility" of
 increasing agricultural output
 by 20 to 30 percent over the
 next five years.   Realizing
 that the success of such a pro-
 gra.n depends in large part on
 peasant morale,Teng suggested
 at the plenum that the regime's
 campaign against its "rightist"
 critics would have to be car-
 ried on with circumspection in
 the countryside.   Denunciation,
 "struggle" meetings,  and the
 extraction of confessions, he
 said,  would not be resorted to
 in the rural areas.   Peasants
 will not be branded as right-
 ists except in unusual cases,
 and the main reliance is to be
 placed on "using words,  not
 hands."
 Elsewhere in the country,
 the drive against rightists
 will be pushed with a stronger
 hand.   Teng decried the demands
 made last spring by Chinese
 intellectuals for "so-called
 freedom of the press,  freedom
 of publication, and freedom for
 literature and arts" and de-
 clared that criticism would be
 tolerated in the future only
 if it did not challenge the
 supremacy of the Communist
 party or Peiping's basic poli-
 cies.   He did not suggest any
 present plans for extensive,
 bloodletting, but held out the
 possibility of drastic action
 against some rightists by his
 warning that contradictions of
 a "you die,  I live" nature
 separated them from the masses.
 The drive against rightist
 critics has been made.a part of
 the "Cheng Feng" movement to
 "rectify" mistakes in party and
 government work which has been
 broadened into a nationwide
 campaign.   Peiping seems par-
 ticularly concerned about the
 uneven quality of its party
 cadres.   The party has expanded
 since 1945 from 1,200,000 to
 12,700,000 members, and another
 weeding out is clearly ahead.
 This is likely to result in the
 expulsion of 5 to 10 percent
 of the membership and will prob-
 ably reach into the central
 committee.   Teng acidly ob-
 served at the plenum that too
 many party members now suffer
 from "bourgeois individualism
 to a serious degree and have
 set their minds on the pursuit
 of personal comfort, fame, and
 position."

 PRESSURE INCREASES FOR UNIFICATION SETTLEMENT IN LAOS
 Laotian Prime Minister
 Souvanna Phouma and Pathet Lao
 chief Souphannouvong have
 agreed on a joint communique
 which considerably increases
 the prospects of a settlement
 of the unification issue and
 early entry of Pathet Lao
 representatives into the Lao-
 tian cabinet.   The communique,
 which will probably be published
 shortly, is largely a restate-
 ment of the 28 December 1956
 agreement.   It contains, how-
 ever,  certain more specific
 Pathet concessions concerning
 the dissolution of Pathet fight-
 ing forces,                                                            the: surrender of war
 materiel, and the re-establish-
 ment of royal authority over the
 two Pathet-controlled provinces.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 In return the Pathets will
 participate in a coalition gov-
 ernment, win legal recognition
 of their front organization as
 a political party, obtain leg-
 islative guarantees of their
 civil rights, and have an op-
 portunity to integrate quali-
 fied troops and functionaries
 into the royal army and civil
 service.
 It is not clear whether
 all the details of implementing
 this settlement will be agreed
 to before or after the formation
 of a coalition government, al-
 though the joint political com-
 mission on 22 October signed
 an agreement outlining the de-
 tails of the turnover of the
 two provinces and the estab-
 lishment of the-coalition.
 It also appears that only a
 symbolic turnover of the Pathet
 provinces and army will precede
 the entry of the Pathets into
 the government.
 The communique, neverthe-
 less, appears to have widespread
 support in the royal govern-
 ment.   Souvanna claims the
 cabinet, which is predominant-
 ly conservative, has already
 given its approval.   In fact,
 Interior Minister Katay, Sou-
 vanna's severest critic and a

 past, has stated his emphatic

 PEIPING PRESSES KISHI ON CHINA POLICY
 Seeing no signs that Prime
 Minister Kishi of Japan is re-
 sponding to Chinese Communist
 overtures for closer political
 ties, Peiping has become in-
 creasingly critical of his gov-
 ernment.   The Communists accuse
 him of being an American puppet
 whose stand on China is "hos-
 tile" to Peiping and "inimical
 to the interests of the Japa
 nese people," and they seem to
 be banking on the hope that
 Japanese public opinion will
 force Kishi to modify his
 policies.
 A recurring theme in Pei-
 ping's recent attacks on the
 Japanese government is the
 charge that Tokyo's "subservi-
 ence" to Washington will iso-
 late Japan from the rest of
 Asia.   Propaganda play is also
 being given to alleged American
 boycotts of some Japanese goods,
 and the Japanese are told that
 their government's dependence
 on the United States presents
 Japan with unnecessary politi-
 cal and economic problems.

 24 October 1957
 Kishi intends to maintain
 ties with Taiwan while working
 toward increased trade, free
 of formal relations, with the
 mainland.  Kishi reportedly
 informed Prime Minister Nehru
 during the Indian's recent
 visit to Japan that he favors
 the continuation of Japan's
 free world ties and is ada-
 mantly opposed to recognizing
 Communist China at this time.
 Kishi insists that such recog-
 nition will not come about un-
 til the regime is admitted to
 the United Nations.  He has
 been severely condemned by
 Peiping for Japan's recent vote
 in favor of another year's mora-
 torium on Chinese Communist
 admission.
 Peiping is also concerned
 over Japanese preoccupation
 with the "two Chinas" concept
 as a method for improving re-
 lationships with the mainland
 short of cutting ties with
 Taiwan and jeopardizing US-
 Japanese relations.  Apparently
 in an effort to forestall the
 possibility of Japan gathering
 international support for a
 "two Chinas" solution, Chou
 En-lai has strongly criticized
 the "two Chinas" trend in Japan,
 declaring that Peiping would
 never permit diplomatic ex-
 changes with a government which
 sought to recognize both Pei-
 ping and Taipei.  Chou asserted
 a willingness to wait 10 or 20
 years for "normalization" of
 Sino-Japanese relations rather
 than accept a "two Chinas"
 arrangement, which he said
 would be advantageous to the
 United States.
 In working to accomplish
 its objective of closer rela-
 tions with Tokyo and a reduction
 of Japanese ties with the United
 States and the Chinese National-
 ists, Peiping still considers
 its strongest lever to be public
 pressure in Japan for large-
 scale trade with the mainland.
 In trade talks now entering
 their fifth week in Peiping,
 the Japanese delegation, with
 semiofficial backing from the
 Kishi government, has proposed
 a trade agreement, a cash pay-
 ment formula, and an exchange of
 permanent trade missions.  Pei-
 ping,however,is demanding a larg-
 er missione.staff with more ex-
 tensive.diplomatic privileges
 than Tokyo has been willing to
 grant.
 There is likely to be some
 dissatisfaction in Japan if the
 talks prove to be inconclusive.
 Some Japanese trading circles are
 beginning to doubt that Peiping
 has either the cash or goods to
 pay for a significant expansion
 of Japanese imports.  They are
 wary of Chinese negotiations with
 West European trade delegations,
 however, and are anxious to pre-
 vent inroads in China by their
 competitors.

 broken off in October 1953, but
 appeared about to be resumed

 Kishi cabinet, anxious for the
 release of the some 900 detained
 fishermen, showed a willingness
 to waive its own property claims
 against Korea and to withdraw
 insulting statements made four
 years previously by a Japanese
 negotiator.  President Syngman

 even permitted to enter South

 the resolution.  After American

 further concessions and may in-

 the official Japanese attitude
 toward Seoul.  President Rhee,
 however, is under no compulsion
 to reach an understanding with
 Japan and is likely to press
 both his property claims and
 his demands that the Japanese

 another irritant in the nation-
 wide provincial antagonism to-
 ward Djakarta.
 Prime Minister Djuanda has
 announced a second national
 conference to be held in Dja-
 karta from 15 to 22 November.
 According to the government,
 the purpose of the conference
 is "to realize decisions in the
 field of development" which
 were taken at the September
 conference and to assure that
 the entire nation is partici-
 pating in development efforts.
 Some 1,400 delegates will
 be invited, so it seems unlikely
 that the conference can be more
 than a speech-making session,
 with the government informing
 the delegates of its plans and
 good intentions.  Djakarta of-
 ficials will probably use the
 conference to explain the pro-
 jected national planning board.
 The large number of delegates
 has probably been invited in
 the hope that government plans
 will thereby reach a greater
 proportion of the knowledgeable
 public in the provinces.
 Djuanda is trying to per-
 suade former vice president
 Hatta to chair the meeting, ap-
 parently hoping that Hatta's
 presence in an official capacity
 would compel provincial leaders
 to attend the conference and
 support its recommendations.
 The disaffected commanders, how-
 ever, have renewed their efforts
 to achieve a united opposition
 to Djakarta, and they reportedly
 were disillusioned with Hatta's
 failure to speak strongly for
 regional interests at the first
 conference.
 Hatta has concluded his
 visit to Communist China and
 is now in Japan.  He appears
 to have been impressed with Chi-
 nese construction and reportedly
 was convinced that methods em-
 bodying the "discipline" and
 "sense of organization" of the
 Chinese Communists should be
 adopted in Indonesia, but has
 made it clear that Communist
 ideology is unacceptable.  His
 visit in Japan, where he is dis-
 cussing the reparations problem
 informally, may indicate his
 willingness to assume an offi-
 cial post when he returns to
 Indonesia.  There is no indi-
 cation, however, that he has
 decided to abandon his opposi-
 tion to President Sukarno's
 program of "guided democracy,"

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 In the domestic field,
 Chundrigar has revived one of
 the most bitterly contested is-
 sues in Pakistan's recent his-
 tory by revealing his plan to
 discard the joint electorate
 system enacted last April and
 reintroduce the traditional
 method of segregating Moslem
 and Hindu voters when the na-
 tional elections are held.  The
 Moslem League has long opposed
 Suhrawardy's policy of joint
 electorates in which the two
 communities are enrolled togeth-
 er and vote for the same candi-
 dates.   Its leaders apparently
 are motivated by the fear that
 the Hindu minority might con-
 trol the balance of power among
 opposing Moslem political par-
 ties if they are not segregated
 from the majority community in
 the holding of elections.
 The joint system is widely
 supported in East Pakistan,
 where nearly all the Hindus in
 Pakistan remain, and the new
 coalition's reversion to the
 old system instituted by the
 British government is likely to
 set off a new wave of resentment
 in the eastern province against
 the central authorities.  While
 Chundrigar claims that amending
 the electoral act will not in-
 terfere with earlier plans to
 hold elections in November 1958,
 it is doubtful whether such a
 change can be implemented with-
 out seriously delaying the com-
 plicated election preparations
 now under way.
 The lack of equal repre-
 sentation  for East Pakistan,
 which has 55 percent of the
 country's population, is further
 underscored by Chundrigar's
 choice of ministers.  He has
 retained four influential Repub-
 lican party members of Suhra-
 wardy's cabinet and appointed
 five other prominent West Paki-
 stan. politicians representing
 both his own Moslem League and
 the Republicans.  The ministers
 selected from the East Pakistan
 parties in the coalition are
 considered to be discredited in
 their home province and do not
 command any significant fol-
 lowing.
 Chundrigar declared that
 his government would maintain
 Pakistan's support of the Bagh-
 dad pact and SEATO.  Relations
 with the United States probably
 will continue to be cooperative,
 though perhaps somewhat more re-
 served than under Suhrawardy.
 Chundrigar will be under pres-
 sure from other Moslem League
 leaders inclined toward a more
 anti-Western, "pan-Islamic"
 policy, although this pressure
 probably will be balanced by
 President Mirza's strongly pro-
 Western views.

 After two years of trading
 a major portion of its cotton
 crop through barter arrange-

 Egypt now will attempt to put
 most of its cotton exports on

 In what amounted

 officials  of  the

 certain barter trans-

 The gradual re-     25X1

 also have adverse ef-

 The Communist practice of pay-

 for Egyptian cotton in exchange
 for overpriced Communist goods
 steadily drove Egypt's cotton
 prices further out of line with

 American sales of surplus cot-

 MILITARY COUP IN GUATEMALA
 A three-man military junta
 seized control of the Guatemal-
 an government early on 24 Octo-
 ber after two days of violent
 popular demonstrations and a
 growing general strike protest-
 ing what opposition presiden-
 tial candidate Ydigoras Fuentes
 called a fraudulent election on
 20 October.   The election has
 been annulled and a new election
 will probably not be held for
 some time.   The new military
 government will probably be
 able to suppress agitation by
 leftists and Communists who
 joined in the postelection dis-
 turbances.
 The junta is composed of
 officers who have not been prom-
 iment in army or political af-
 fairs in recent years,  and their
 selection was probably a com-
 promise among leading officers,
 most of whom are weakened by
 opposing cliques in the faction-
 ridden army.   The most prom-
 inent junta member is the ambi-
 tious, conservative-minded Colo-
 nel Oscar Mendoza,  former army
 chief of staff who was demoted
 by the late President Castillo
 Armas in early 1955 after nu-
 merous reports alleged that he
 and his brothers, Colonels
 Miguel and Rodolfo Mendoza, were
 plotting a coup.   Other junta
 members are Colonel Roberto
 Lorenzana,  commander of an out-
 lying military district, and
 Colonel Gonzalo Yurrita Nova
 of the air force.
 The defense minister, Colo-
 nel Juan F. Oliva, who had here-
 tofore held the army together,
 apparently was unsuccessful in
 resisting pressure from his col-
 leagues to form a Junta, and
 his former unifying influence
 appears to have been seriously
 weakened,  if not destroyed.
 The 30-day state of siege   de-

 In the 20 October election,
 which Oliva had ordered annulled
 shortly before the junta seized
 power, Ydigoras received over-

 At the congress, which met

 He said Nenni must accept terms
 agreed to by the Socialist Inter-

 Socialists or permit a mixed

 groundwork for a united Social-

 Socialists determining relations

 $70,000,000 and $90,000,000

 The more recent extraor-

 1956--two thirds of which fol-

 Eastern Europe--and $180,000,-

 primarily by requirements for
 hard currency loans to the satel-

 by Soviet purchases of raw ma-

 in the sterling area.   Since

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Gomulka himself has never
 approved of the public expres-
 sion of opposition to party
 views, particularly by party
 members.    He has already closed
 down one of the worst offenders,
 Po Prostu, after efforts over
 TFie pa   year by the party to
 curb the journal.  The disturb-
 ances which followed the closing
 of Po Prostu and the increasing
 dissat isfaction among Polish
 intellectuals have made clear
 the regime's need to move care-
 fully in placing limits  on
 journalistic expression.
 In an attempt to resolve
 the broad issues involved, the
 regime has appointed a commis-
 sion of the Polish Journalists'
 Association to draft a new press
 act for the regulation of "the
 whole activity of the press."
 The act will outline the legal
 responsibility of a journalist
 and distinguish "criticism from
 slander and insult."  It was
 reportedly under politburo con-
 sideration on 9 October, and may
 have been the result of several
 ad hoc discussions between party
 leaders and representatives of
 the journalists, the most recent
 of which took place on 5 October.
 The issues involved in such reg-
 ulation of literary expression
 may well be a major subject of
 the tenth plenum of the Polish
 party, which reportedly  con-
 vened this week.
 Soviet articles appearing
 in the past few months have
 criticized articles written by
 Polish economists who had ad-
 vocated the study of Western
 economic theory and the appli-
 cation of the results of West-
 ern economic research.   They
 have launched an attack on
 Polish criticism and abandon-
 ment of socialist realism in art,
 and have aggressively defended
 Soviet literature against the
 "slanders" of Antoni Solnimski,
 chairman of the Polish Writers'
 Association, and against the
 sins of omission committed by
 the new quarterly of the Polish-
 Soviet Friendship  Society.
 Severe criticism was contained
 in an article released to Soviet
 printers on 9 September which
 charged with revisionism Polish
 scientists and philosophers who
 write in the journal  Philo-
 sophical Thought.  It c oose`five
 individual contributors for de-
 tailed condemnation.
 Several articles have been
 published in Poland in the past
 few weeks which will  almost
 certainly draw additional So-
 viet criticism. Noteworthy among
 these is a three-part  series
 published by Poland's now famed
 "revisionist," Kolakowski, which
 has already been exposed to rath-
 er thorough criticism within Po-
 land and from a Czech philospher.
 These recent articles have prob-
 ably sharpened  the growing
 struggle between the party and
 liberal journalists and will       25X1
 force the party to take prompt,
 legally defined st     to rurh
 such expressions,

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 Since the Soviet 20th party
 congress in February 1956, the
 Soviet drive to establish a
 "zone of peace" to the rear of
 the NATO and Baghdad pact coun-
 tries has been carried into
 Africa, the "last refuge of
 colonialism," from which it is
 hoped to eliminate Western in-
 fluences.   By developing close
 relations with independent Afri-
 can states and encouraging in-
 digenous nationalist and neu-
 tralist movements throughout
 Africa, the USSR hopes to force
 the West to abandon its bases
 and economic activities in this
 area.
 Soviet bloc interest in
 Africa has intensified since
 1955, and at the 20th party
 congress it was asserted that
 the Asian-African nations and
 the Sino-Soviet bloc constituted
 a united front against imperial-

 ism.   In December 1956 the Com-
 munist-dominated Asian Solidari-
 ty Committee decided to broaden
 its membership to include Afri-
 can nongovernmental leaders,
 and Egyptian President Nasir
 has given approval for the
 Asian-African Solidarity Com-
 mittee of nongovernmental lead-
 ers to hold its conference in
 Cairo late this year.
 Since 1955 the USSR has
 established diplomatic relations
 with Libya and the Sudan and
 has promptly recognized and of-
 fered relations to the newly
 independent states of Ghana,
 Morocco, and Tunisia. It.raised
 its legations to embassies in
 Egypt and Ethiopia, made diplo-
 matic overtures to Liberia,
 and sent     diplomats On official
 visits  to the Belgian- Congo
 and Somalia.
 During the past
 year the bloc has
 multiplied its eco-
 nomic overtures and
 arms offers to newly
 independent African
 states.   The USSR has
 asserted in broad-
 casts, TASS state-
 ments, and private
 approaches that its
 peaceful intentions
 make Western bases
 in Africa unnecessary,
 warning that if the
 USSR were "forced"
 into nuclear retalia-

 be hazardous.   At the
 same time Moscow has
 displayed a marked
 uneasiness toward the

 being formulated as
 part of the Common
 Market plan, which it
 regards as a Western

 pendence of African
 states.   Eurafrica
 refers to the Afri-
 can areas associated
 with the member coun-
 tries of the Common
 Market.
 Egypt
 Egypt occupies
 an important position
 in Soviet plans for
 Africa and the Middle
 East.    Moscow appears
 to believe that by
 strongly supporting
 Nasir's ambition to
 play a leading role
 in African affairs,
 it can best weaken
 Western influence
 and induce newly in-
 dependent states to
 abandon their depend-
 ence on the former
 colonial powers in
 favor of an ultranationalist,
 ultraneutralist orientation.
 Soviet-Egyptian arms agree-
 ments have encouraged Nasir to
 circumvent Western embargoes or
 agreements promulgated elsewhere
 in Africa.
 Using
 Soviet bloc radio equipment,
 Cairo's open and clandestine
 broadcasts of anti-Western prop-
 aganda throughout Africa have
 also served Soviet interests.
 Cairo has played up the Soviet
 role during the Sinai invasion
 as evidence that Moscow supports
 African attempts to flout the
 West.
 However, reports in July
 from American posts in Morocco,
 Ghana, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Libya,
 and the Sudan suggest that this
 propaganda is not so effective
 as Moscow might wish.  Articu-
 late Africans are scarcely aware
 of Moscow's cease-fire role.,
 and the Sinai invasion is for
 the large part forgotten.
 The USSR has cooperated
 with Egypt to spread anti-West-
 ern propaganda in Ethiopia,
 Somalia, Libya, and especially
 in the Sudan and to persuade
 these governments to adopt neu-
 tralist positions.
 In June, the USSR pur-

 which is concerned over its
 possible adverse effects on
 next February's. elections.
 Egyptian Communists have
 been useful to Nasir--and thus
 to the Russians--as an example
 to publicize Egypt's independ-
 ence of Soviet influence. Their
 proscription from election rolls
 this summer and the scheduled
 trial this fall of 18 Communists
 are used by Nasir to hide his
 close bloc ties.
 North Africa
 In North Africa, the USSR
 has assigned a high priority
 to the disruption of Western
 agreements covering strategic
 air base rights and raw materi-
 al development.
 Between the 20th party
 congress and the Sinai invasion
 in October 1956, the USSR pur-
 sued a relatively moderate pol-
 icy on Algeria in order to im-
 prove relations with West Euro-
 pean Socialists, including the
 Mollet government in France.
 Strained relations between the
 USSR and France over Suez and
 Hungary, however, were followed
 by renewed Soviet and French
 Communist attacks on French
 policy in Algeria.
 The USSR probably will ex-
 ploit the Algerian question in
 the present UN General Assembly
 in the belief that Algeria is
 an emotional issue similar to
 Israel in its potential for
 alienating Africa and the Arabs
 from the West and for splitting
 the West itself.   Syrian-Defense
 Minister Azm asserted in August
 that shipments of bloc arms
 would be made to the rebels.
 Tunisia, the most pro-
 Western Arab state, presents a
 special challenge to Moscow's
 claims of inherent Arab-Western
 incompatibility.  The Soviet
 delegation to Tunisian independ-
 ence ceremonies in March urged
 that the country establish dip-
 lomatic relations with the
 July,  the UNSR and Tunisia con-
 cluded a trade agreement.
 In September 1956, Moscow
 requested diplomatic relations
 with Morocco.   Last April it
 concluded its first direct trade
 agreement with the country,
 hoping to give Rabat a sense
 of independence in regard to
 the American base negotiations
 which began the following month.
 It has also sent three purchas-
 ing missions to outbid the West
 in limited nonstrategic raw ma-
 terial purchases.
 Soviet economic and arms
 offers to Libya last year were
 doubtless closely coordinated
 with Nasir because of his in-
 terests there.   Aimed primarily
 at rendering the political
 climate unfavorable toward
 American base rights, these of-
 fers have recently been used
 as bargaining instruments by
 Tripoli to gain increased West-
 ern benefits.   In August the
 Soviet military attachd reit-
 erated Moscow's "hopes to in-
 crease the size of the Libyan
 army and to equip it."  Libya
 has apparently given Soviet
 arms offers no encouragement
 and has asked all military at-
 tachds, including the Soviet
 and Egyptian, to leave the
 country.
 The USSR has sought closer
 ties with the colonial and in-
 dependent states of Black Afri-
 ca primarily to preclude their

 absorption into Eurafrican or
 NATO groupings.   Moscow prob-
 ably views the Western concept
 of "orderly transition" toward
 self-government a means for
 transforming old colonial ties,
 through economic inducements,
 into new anti-Communist group-
 ings.   Because of its geographi-
 cal remoteness from the area
 and the small amount of influ-
 ence it exerts there, the USSR
 is encouraging Black Africa to
 join the Bandung powers in an
 enlarged "zone of peace."  It
 is prepared also to extend eco-
 nomic aid with immediate and
 noticeable benefit to offset
 the area's dependence on the
 West.
 Moscow probably welcomes
 the competition for leadership
 in West Africa between Ghana
 and Liberia as favoring the
 prospects for concluding diplo-
 matic relations with these
 countries.   President Tubman of
 Liberia has declined three in-
 vitations to visit the USSR
 since a Soviet delegation at-
 tending his inauguration in
 January 1956 first raised the
 subject of diplomatic relations.
 Prime Minister Nkrumah of
 Ghana, a Marxian Socialist, re-
 ceived a Soviet delegation at
 independence ceremonies in March
 and has reportedly agreed to
 visit the USSR at an unspecified
 date.   In August, he reported
 Soviet offers to repeat last
 year's large purchase of cocoa
 if Ghana would agree to buy
 Soviet products.
 The USSR made its first
 overture to Somalia in early
 October, when three Soviet dip-
 lomats stationed in Ethiopia

 visited the trust territory,
 probably to lay the groundwork
 for aid offers and the estab-
 lishment of a Soviet consular
 mission.
 The USSR has a large staff
 in Addis Ababa directing bloc
 activities in the area, and an
 invitation has been extended
 to Haile Selassie to visit Mos-
 cow.                                                             This followed a Soviet
 warning in March of the dangers
 to Ethiopia of maintaining US bases
 in view of the possibility of
 atomic retaliation against them.
 Soviet activities in colo-
 nial Africa, operating primarily
 through front organizations,
 have apparently received a low
 priority but are on the upswing..
 African Negroes who have come
 into contact with both West-
 erners and Communists have been
 impressed by the lack of color
 consciousness among the latter.
 Soviet propaganda turns
 frequently to the Union of
 South Africa--the only independ-
 ent African nation ruled by
 "Europeans"--in its attempts to
 equate the West with racism.
 The union's apartheid policy
 is represented as the West's
 responsibility and the fate of
 any colony that does not forcibly
 eject the West.   Communist pub-
 lications-mailed from the USSR,
 Czechoslovakia, Poland, and
 Communist China--have eluded
 postal authorities and by their
 sheer volume hav

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 October 1957
 COMMUNIST ACTIVITY IN HONG KONG
 Chinese Communist activity
 in the British crown colony of
 Hong Kong appears directed to-
 ward the gradual and peaceful
 development of Peiping's influ-
 ence over the local Chinese,
 subverting the authority of the
 colonial government, in line
 with Peiping's contention that
 Hong Kong is an integral part
 of China.  Despite the opposi-
 tion of most local Chinese to
 the mainland regime, the Com-
 munists, through appeals to in-
 dividual self-interests and em-
 phasis on welfare rather than
 political issues, are continuing
 their gradual penetration of
 labor, cultural, and economic
 circles.   The British authori-
 ties, while watchful of Commu-
 nist activities and cognizant
 of Communist objectives, have
 refrained from harsh actions
 that might antagonize Peiping.
 The number of hard-core
 Communists in Hong Kong is be-
 lieved small.   Most local Chi--
 nese are apolitical but many,
 particularly in labor circles,
 tend to acquiesce to Communist
 leadership.   There are few Chi-
 nese Nationalist adherents in
 Hong Kong, and Kuomintang leader-
 ship is ineffectual.   Most po-
 litically inclined local Chinese
 regard themselves as independ-
 ents.
 Organized labor consti-
 tutes only a small portion of
 Hong Kong's labor force.   Unions
 under the pro-Nationalist Trade
 Union Council--comprising 72,000
 workers--are handicapped by
 corruption and preoccupied with
 political machinations.   The
 council continues to lose ground
 to the better-led, Communist-
 controlled Federation of Trade
 Unions, which unites 110,000
 workers.   The  expansion of the
 federation--which   dominates
 such strategic fields as ship-
 building, transportation, steve-
 doring, and public utilities--
 has been somewhat offset, how-
 ever, by an increase in the
 number of independent unions,
 with a total of 16,000 members.
 In education, the Commu-
 nists appear to be making slow
 but steady gains.   Of the colony's
 some 1,100 educational institu-
 tions, 34 schools with a total
 enrollment of 12,000 pupils are
 Communist-controlled and over
 100 schools probably have been
 infiltrated.  There are 7,450
 pupils enrolled in "workers"'
 schools, presumably run on the
 same lines as their mainland
 counterparts.   Communist efforts
 to infiltrate local student
 groups are encountering some-
 what greater opposition than
 formerly; however, they continue
 to make headway.  The colony's
 Chinese teachers in particular
 appear vulnerable to Communist
 inducements because of inade-
 quate salaries and lack of job
 security.   The British have
 attempted to check subversion
 in the schools by prohibitions
 against political activity and
 by supervision of the curriculums.
 Communist and pro-Communist
 business and financial groups
 are permitted to operate freely
 under the government's policy
 of free trade.  The Communists
 use economic inducements, such
 as offering favorable credit
 terms through the Hong Kong
 branch of the Bank of China, to
 appeal to the self-interests of
 selected local Chinese business-
 men.                                                      Many Hong Kong business-
 men are dependent.on trade with
 China and those who have rela-
 tives there or who are fearful
 of eventual British withdrawal
 from the colony are particularly
 susceptible to Communist blan-
 dishments.   The leaders of the
 Chinese General Chamber of Com-
 merce in Hong Kong are pro-Com-
 munist.
 While their "smile campaign"
 of last year has lost its early
 momentum, the Communists have
 successfully reached an increas-
 ingly large mass audience through

 high-quality movie, press, and

 blatant propaganda and have
 wide audience appeal.  The pro-
 Communist Ching Pao is the col-
 ony's third iarges? daily; pro-
 Communist press circulation in
 the last year and a half has
 risen from less than one fifth
 to one third of the colony's
 daily press circulation.   On
 the other hand, Communist at-
 tempts to woo prominent Chi-
 nese have met with only mar-
 ginal success.  A few newspaper-
 men have been bribed and some
 Hong Kong entertainers have re-
 turned to the mainland.  How-
 ever, Communist strength among
 leading businessmen, educators,
 artists, and other leaders of
 opinion has shown no appreciable
 change.
 When Peiping recently cast
 itself in the role of champion
 of "mistreated" local Chinese
 temporarily displaced by the
 government's refugee housing
 program and claimed the "duty
 and right" to protect the in-
 terests of Chinese residents in
 Hong Kong, the British firmly
 rejected any compromise of their
 sovereignty.  They also have re-
 sisted Peiping's requests to
 have an official representative
 stationed in the colony.   Local
 security forces appear capable
 of preventing violent or illegal
 political activity.
 The local Communists pos-
 sibly would be able to paralyze
 the colony's internal services
 should Peiping make a concerted
 effort to seize Hong Kong, al-
 though there is little apprehen-
 sion over the probability of
 such a take-over among either
 the ordinary residents or busi-
 nessmen investing in the colony's
 flourishing economy.

 DISCONTENT AMONG CHINESE INTELLECTUALS
 Since coming to power in
 China in 1949, the Communists
 have achieved impressive suc-
 cesses in some fields, but at
 the cost of gradually rising
 discontent among the people.
 This was dramatically highlight-
 ed by the vehement criticism of
 the Communist party and govern-
 ment which erupted last spring,
 following repeated invitations
 by Mao Tse-tung and other re-
 gime spokesmen to "bloom and
 contend."
 Leaders of the "democratic"
 puppet parties were quickly
 joined by other members of the
 Chinese intelligentsia--writers,
 educators, students, artists,
 scientists, and technicians--
 in attacks on the entire Commu-
 nist system.   These people are
 China's handful of intellectuals,
 an estimated 4,000,000 in a pop-
 ,
 ulation of over 600,000,000,
 the only major group of China's
 upper and middle classes which
 has not felt the full weight of
 the regime's displeasure.  The
 others--landowners, civil service
 officials of the old regime, and
 commercial interests--had all
 been cowed into submission dur-
 ing the five major "suppression"
 campaigns which followed "lib-
 eration."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 1955 when the writer Hu Feng
 and his "clique" were attacked
 as counterrevolutionary ele-
 ments.
 Peiping's growing concern
 over the attitude of the in-
 telligentsia toward the regime
 was underlined in January 1956
 when the Chinese Communist party
 convened a conference where
 the "problems" of intellectuals
 were discussed.   Chou En-lai's
 report to the conference re-
 vealed the regime's pressing
 need for willing cooperation
 from the intelligentsia, whose
 talents he called the "most
 precious property of the state."
 Chou demanded an end to "closed-
 doorism" which had prevented
 admission of intellectuals to
 the party.   He urged the gov-
 ernment to employ them in jobs
 suitable for their special
 skills, to "trust." them, and
 to avoid interference with their
 work.
 In the following spring,
 Peiping launched a cautious.
 program of liberalization under
 Mao Tse-tung's "hundred flowers"
 slogan.   Coincident with the
 bloc-wide reaction against re-
 pressive Stalinism following
 the Soviet 20th party congress
 in Moscow, the Chinese Commu-
 nist government encouraged in-
 tellectuals toward freer expres-
 sion on individual opinion in
 professional discussions with
 their fellows, calling on vari-
 ous schools of thought to "con-
 tend."
 The new dispensation was
 received by intellectuals with
 extreme caution, despite re-
 peated calls from regime spokes-
 men for more vigorous "blooming
 and contending."  Attempts to
 stimulate discussion took on
 new urgency last winter.  Ap-
 parently with the Hungarian
 developments in mind, Mao Tse-
 tung again spoke out for great-
 er expression of individual
 views in his "secret" speech
 before the Supreme State Coun-
 cil last February.
 The intellectuals continued-
 to hold back, however, until
 May, when they were specifi-
 cally invited by Li Wei-han,
 director of the party's united-
 front work department, to as-
 sist in the "Cheng Feng" cam-
 paign--for party and government
 rectification through criticism.
 By the end of May they were
 participating in this effort
 with enthusiasm.
 Forthright Criticism
 The Communists, had set
 the tone for criticism by com-
 paring comments on the "working
 style" in government and party
 to a "mild breeze and gentle
 rain." Peiping evidently ex-
 pected that nonparty critics
 would present carefully modulat-
 ed  complaints which would
 serve as a safety valve and
 also, perhaps, contain useful
 suggestions.  Instead there
 occurred what the Communists
 called an "unusual spring,
 with thunderstorms and strong
 winds."  Three nonparty cabinet
 ministers began what Peiping
 was soon to describe as a "fran-
 tic attack" on the entire Com-
 munist system.  Their charges
 reflected angry disgust with
 continued dictatorial rule by
 a-party which had become in-
 creasingly grasping and ineffi-
 cient with years of. power.
 Chang Po-chun, minister of
 communications, declared that
 the party made all decisions
 for the government, leaving
 nonparty officials with only
 nominal authority.   Chang de-
 manded a clear-cut separation
 between the administration and
 the party.
 Minister of Timber Industry
 Lo Lung-chi asked for formation
 of a special organization to
 guarantee that no revenge would
 be taken on people who spoke
 out.   Lo charged that many in-
 nocent persons had been impris-
 oned                                                               or executed during the
 postrevolutionary "suppression"
 campaigns.  These "mistakes,"
 he said, should be investigated
 and where possible corrected.
 Asserting that one party can-
 not hope to build a new China
 alone, he called for active

 chi had the temerity to say
 that Communist bureaucracy
 was a greater danger to the
 country than capitalism and
 to declare that China's "na-
 tional bourgeoisie" was no long-
 er an exploiting class.
 Accusations multiplied and
 grew more savage as the critics
 warmed to their work.   The par-
 ty was said to be a privileged
 group which ruled China as a
 private empire, enjoying lux-
 ury and power while the people
 suffered.  Officials complained
 they were hampered in their work
 by the incompetence of party
 cadres placed above them.   Scien-
 tists, artists, and writers de-
 manded freedom from "supervi-
 sion" by ignorant party members.
 An instructor at People's
 University in Peiping charged
 the government with having made
 a "mess" of things and declared
 bitterly that "the people who
 have really gone up in the world
 are party members and cadres
 who used to wear worn-out shoes
 but now travel in cars and don
 woolen uniforms." China, he
 said, belongs to the people, and
 the party's attitude of "I am
 the state" cannot be tolerated.
 He predicted that if conditions
 did not improve, the masses
 might "kill the Communists,"
 adding that this would not be
 an act of treason to the coun-
 try.
 The assault on the regime
 continued without interruption
 from mid-May until the first
 week in June, when the party
 began to deploy its forces for
 a counterattack.   On 4 June an

 The more authoritative
 People's Daily--mouthpiece for
 the     nese  ommunist party--
 joined the fight three days
 later with an editorial which
 declared that although large-
 scale class struggle in China
 had subsided, "it is by no
 means completely finished."
 This was followed the next day
 by another long editorial de-
 manding "correct countercriti-
 cism" as an antidote for ill-
 intentioned attacks aimed at
 "undermining the socialist under-
 takings, the people's democratic
 dictatorship, and the unity be-
 tween the party and the people."
 Speaking again through the
 People's Daily on 11 June, the
 party  a e i s intentions even
 clearer by calling on all pa-
 triots to "draw a-line between
 themselves and the rightists."
 The editorial pointed out that
 certain "rightist  elements"
 had taken advantage of the rec-
 tification movement to "oppose
 socialism" and warned that un-
 less such persons changed their
 attitude, they would become an
 "utterly isolated, pitiable
 group."
 Coincident with these
 statements of party views--which
 Peiping radio later remarked
 had produced a "marked change
 in the atmosphere"--came the
 first personal attacks on the
 nonparty politicians who had
 criticized the regime.   These
 attacks came not from the party
 but from members of the "demo-
 cratic" puppet parties them-
 selves who now turned on their
 leaders in an effort to save
 their own skins.
 While these skirmishers
 harried and wore down the prin-
 cipal "rightists" at frequent
 symposiums, the party lined up
 its main forces in preparation
 for the National People's Con-
 gress, which was finally con-
 vened on 26 June after having

 been against the dissident in-
 telligentsia.
 Chou En-lai opened the con-
 gress with a 30,000-word address
 in which he accused right-wing
 critics of trying to wrest state
 power from the Communist party
 and return China to capitalism,
 declaring that the "broad masses
 will not permit this."  Chou
 scoffed at "rightist dreams" of
 replacing the Communist system
 with the "bourgeois system of
 multiparty politics and alter-
 nation in office" and repudiated
 the rightist view that dictator-
 ship was no longer necessary--
 noting that "remnant counter-
 revolutionaries" were still at
 work in China.
 Another speaker, party
 propaganda chief Lu Ting-i, told
 delegates that "opposition to
 the Communist party is treason."
 Lu warned that the "rightists"
 had connections with reaction-
 aries both at home and abroad
 and declared that "it is cer-
 tain that there will still be
 a long-term class struggle"
 which would at times "assume a
 very acute form."
 This prediction was ful-
 filled as the congress wore on
 and attacks against the "right-
 ists" became increasingly viru-
 lent.                    By 15 July, when the con-
 gress session ended, the intel-
 lectuals had been cowed into mak-
 ing abject recantations and the
 "struggle" had been broadened
 to include the academic world,
 the press, the theater and arts,
 the government, business circles,
 the armed forces,  and finally
 the Communist party itself,  in
 addition to the "democratic"
 puppet parties.
 Progress of Campaign
 munist plotters, according to
 Peiping's charges.   Almost the
 same number of "enemies" have
 been ferreted out among China's
 newspapermen and authors--in-
 eluding editors, subeditors,
 and reporters on almost every
 major publication except the
 People's Daily.
 Investigations at 21,
 schools and universities have
 revealed more than 70 "anti-
 socialist" professors, instruc-
 tors or administrative officers.
 Eight scientists and 17 business-
 men have thus far been included
 among the accused.   None of the
 37 Communists charged with being
 "rightist" is a well-known party
 figure--with the possible ex-
 ception of Ting Ling, a famous
 woman writer and a party member
 since the 1920's.
 Peiping has constructed
 an elaborate case against the
 rightists and painted their
 offenses in the most somber
 tones.   Through exaggerated ac-
 cusations--some patently fan-
 tastic--and repeated public con-
 fessions, they have been linked
 together in an intricate web of
 conspiracy and charged with the
 most serious crimes--ties with
 the Kuomintang, attempts to pro-
 mote a "Hungarian incident" in
 China, and ambitions to become
 "Chinese Nagys."
 The regime has not as yet
 followed up these moves with ex-
 tensive bloodletting, despite
 its warning that the rightists
 have placed themselves "outside
 the ranks of the people."  Only
 three minor rightists,  the al-
 leged leaders of a two-day stu-
 dent riot, have been executed.
 All three accused cabinet minis-
 ters still retain their titles,
 if not their positions.
 To date more than 400 in-
 dividuals have been identified
 as rightists,  and denunciation
 meetings held all over China
 are still turning up new vic-
 tims.   More than 50 have been

 "democratic" parties have been

 ical experiment--the policy of

 to rouse the intelligentsia

 by a grant of limited freedom.
 The instinctive reaction of the
 Communist leaders when this
 scheme blew up in their faces
 was a reversion to familiar
 tactics of repression..  It seems
 probable that they have now
 settled on this course as a
 policy, calculating that silent
 dissent is less costly than
 genuine vocal opposition--no
 matter how restricted--which
 might in'the long run lead to
 serious trouble.
 Party Secretary General
 Teng Hsiao-ping's recently pub-
 lished report to the central
 committee plenum last month
 makes clear the regime's inten-
 tions to compel adherence to
 the party's basic dogmas by
 both party members and nonparty
 intelligentsia.   Mao Tse-tung
 set forth both these dogmas in
 the revised version of his "se-
 cret" February speech on "bloom-
 ing and contending," which was
 published on 19 June.   Mao es-
 tablished criteria for distin-
 guishing "flowers" from "weeds."
 Words and actions are proper,
 he said, if they strengthen
 Communist party leadership of
 the state, help consolidate the
 centralized dictatorship, ad-
 vance socialist transformation
 A combination of economic
 and political factors has made
 Uruguay more susceptible than
 any other South American country
 to Soviet bloc overtures in re-
 cent years and has facilitated
 Communist domination of increas-
 ingly large segments of labor.
 No other Latin American country,
 except Argentina, has conducted
 such a large percentage of its
 trade with the bloc, and none
 has established so many new
 diplomatic and trade ties.   In
 the field of labor, the Commu-
 nist confederation has out-
 stripped   its   principal
 SECRET
 and construction, and benefit
 relations among Sino-Soviet
 bloc states.
 Mao's speech was couched
 in a Chinese style, and pre-
 sented his criteria as his per-
 sonal views, with which he said
 his audience would be permitted
 to disagree.  Teng Hsiao-ping's
 recent remarks were less polite,
 and his report was cast in harsh
 Communist, rather than Chinese,
 terms.   Teng said, in essence,
 that no one in China would be
 permitted to disagree with these
 dogmas. "Contending" now is to
 be entirely against those who
 challenge these points.
 Many of the intellectuals
 accused as rightists will prob-
 ably be able to survive by tak-
 ing the role of permanent pub-
 lic whipping boy under the new
 dispensation.  A Peiping broad-
 cast of 13 September observed
 that there was a "market" for
 some rightists as "mobile text-
 books" for the instruction of
 the masses.  Others, however,
 appear to exist on.a narrow
 margin of borrowed time--avail-
 able for ready use to impress
 the populace with the hazards
 of opposition to the regime.

 FIRST QUARTER

 In 1956, Uruguay
 traded with seven bloc
 countries, including
 China, and increased
 its trade with these
 countries by nearly
 43.4 percent over the
 1955 level.  Although
 the actual value of
 this trade was only
 $18,619,000, it amount-
 ed to 4.5 percent of
 Uruguay's total trade,
 a percentage exceeded
 only by one other
 Latin American coun-
 try, Argentina.     .
 Uruguayan interest in trad-
 ing with the Sino-Soviet bloc
 soared in 1953 when the col-
 lapse of the Korean trading boom
 coincided  with the loss of the
 US market for wool tops--semi-
 processed wool.  Wool tops had
 accounted for up to 20 percent
 of Uruguay's dollar receipts in
 some years.  They were in effect
 excluded from the US market in
 1953 by a duty imposed to com-
 pensate for Uruguayan subsidies
 to wool processors.
 The effect of these develop-
 ments was intensified by the
 inflexibility of the Uruguayan
 economy, which is subject to ex-
 tensive government regulation.

 inadequate foreign exchange is
 derived from livestock products,
 and the government's principal
 attempts to alleviate this sit-
 uation--subsidies to wheat
 growers and wool processors--
 have resulted in a backlog of
 additional unsalable products.
 The high cost of Uruguay's wel-
 fare state--which employs about
 20 percent of the labor force
 in state-owned enterprises and
 the civil service--increases
 the impact of any economic dis-
 location.
 In 1954, the Soviet Union
 took advantage of this situation
 to make ostentatious spot pur-
 chases of wool and meat worth
 $20,000,000 and to sign a much-
 publicized trade  agreement.
 Faced with a deteriorating trade
 situation and mounting internal
 debts, the Uruguayan government
 responded  eagerly. to  these,
 and  other  gestures,  and in
 early  1956  became
 the first and only
 Latin American coun-
 try to designate a
 trade representative
 to Communist China.
 This action fol-
 lowed a visit to the
 US by Luis Batlle
 Berres, who was then
 president, and is
 still political boss
 of Uruguay and the
 dominant member of
 the executive arm,
 the National Council
 of Government.  His
 action was regarded
 as a gesture of re".
 taliation for the re
 fusal of the United
 States to alter its
 tariff policy and
 surplus disposal pro
 gram.   Batlle appar-
 ently also hoped he
 would be offered a
 government loan.  He
 told the press on his
 return that "as a re-
 sult of US policy, we
 will sell anything
 but  our  souls  to
 Russia, China, or anyone else."
 Batlle has also strongly backed
 acceptance of Czechoslovakia's
 attractive bid for expanding
 the Montevideo telephone system
 --a contract which would give
 Czech technicians access to the
 entire telephone system for
 four years.

 much as $2,000,000 a year on
 propaganda.   Czechoslovakia al-
 so maintains a legation in
 Montevideo, and Rumania recent-
 ly opened a legation following
 its recognition by Uruguay in
 1956.   Poland, Hungary, East
 Germany, and Bulgaria maintain
 active commercial missions.
 The activities of these
 missions are supplemented by
 two Soviet-Uruguayan cultural
 centers  a stream of performing
 artists, , special trade delega-
 tions, and groups representing
 labor, women's organizations
 and athletic associations. Over
 300 such representatives visited
 Uruguay in 1956.   In addition,
 the Soviet and Czech missions
 subsidize in whole or in part
 some 40 journals and newspapers,
 many of which are distributed
 to neighboring countries.   The
 bloc missions also maintain ex-
 tensive contacts with the nu-
 merous local Slav colonies and
 such cultural front groups as
 the Slav Union and the Maxim
 Gorki centers.
 The local Communist party
 (PCU), despite its ineffective-
 ness as apolitical organiza
 tion, has  made  tremendous
 strides since 1955 in gaining
 control of labor.   Its General
 Union of Workers (UGT) now
 speaks for about 95,000 workers
 --approximately a third of the
 organized labor force--compared
 with less than half that number
 represented by the only effec-
 tive anti-Communist federation,
 the Syndical Confederation of
 Uruguay (CSU).   The two organi-
 zations were approximately
 equal in strength in 1955.
 The success of the Commu-
 nist labor offensive is the
 result of a number of factors,
 including Uruguay's deteriorat-
 ing economic situation and a
 shift in Communist techniques.
 Following the PCU national con-
 gress in 1955, Communist labor
 leaders adopted a new "soft"
 line, avoiding political cliches
 and concentrating instead on
 "labor coordinating committees"
 and sympathy strikes in which
 they posed successfully as the
 principal defenders of labor's
 economic interests.
 Taking advantage of the
 government's reluctance to
 grant wage increases to its own
 numerous employees and of em-
 ployer resistance to the more
 strenuous demands of the anti-
 Communist CSU, the Communists
 in 1956 initiated and gained
 control of a so-called "labor
 unity movement" which almost
 eliminated CSU control of its
 own unions.   At the same time,
 the Communists infiltrated the
 CSU's two principal affiliates
 --the Municipal Workers' Union
 and the Public Health Employees'
 organization, comprising 40
 percent of CSU membership--and
 engineered their disaffiliation
 from the CSU.
 The Communist labor offen-
 sive has been aided substantial-
 ly by hostility to the CSU on
 the part of the government,
 which apparently regards the
 confederation as a potential
 threat in the November 1958
 general elections.   For example,
 Batlle Berres, who ran in 1954
 on a labor platform which he
 has not fulfilled, tried to
 break a CSU waterfront strike
 in early 1957 by working with
 the powerful Communist unions,
 His plan was defeated only when
 the International Confederation
 of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU),
 alarmed by Communist  gains in
 Uruguay, threw money behind the
 strike and ordered its European
 dockworkers to boycott Uruguayan
 ships.
 Attitude Toward Communism
 The Uruguayan government
 has consistently dismissed Com-
 munism as "a matter of 10,000
 votes" and only two seats in
 the 99-man Chamber of Deputies.
 There is a widespread feeling
 in Uruguay that the rightist

 dictatorships in South America
 present a much greater threat
 to free institutions, and a
 conviction, even among anti-
 Communists, that no appreciable
 number of Uruguayans will ever
 submit to the discipline re-
 quired of Communists.
 The government has also
 taken the position that attempts
 by Washington to create  an
 awareness of Communist problems
 in the course of inter-American
 meetings border on intervention
 in the affairs of other coun-
 tries.   As a measure of its
 disdain and its defiance of
 "anti-Communist hysteria," the
 government last spring permitted
 the pro-Communist Jacobo Arbenz,
 deposed president of Guatemala,
 to take up residence in Monte-
 video.
 Uruguayans also appear to
 believe that  '.their,  pseudo-
 SECRET
 socialist welfare state removes
 any economic basis for Commu-
 nism.   There is evidence, too,
 that they believe the  anti-
 Communist camp resents their
 extensive network of  stAtd-?
 owned enterprises and wishes
 to open the country to foreign
 investment, an idea rejected
 early in the century by the
 national hero and "father of
 modern Uruguay," Jose Battle
 y Ordonez.
 These traditional attitudes
 have been cultivated by this
 Battle Berres, a nephew of
 Battle y Ordonez.  Although
 Uruguayans are basically friend-
 ly to the United States and
 tend to support it in any show-
 down with the Soviet Union, they
 appear to find the United States
 a more plausible scapegoat for
 their economic troubles than the
 countries of the Soviet bloc.
