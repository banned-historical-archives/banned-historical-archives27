 its denial of the Marxist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat;
 ..the belief that' capitalism can develop without crises that become progress-
 ively'more violent; the profession that Stalinism is a-specific political
 economic system;`the belief that a gradual transition to socialism is
 possible through, reforms rather than by revolution; denial of the eco-
 nomic-role of the socialist state and.of democratic centralism; disagree-
 mentwith the SovietSconcept of proletarian internationalism;-and denial
 of the leading role of,the Communist Party of the Soviet Union -- has
 apparently ceased to exist, on the surface at least, in the USSR.  This,
 of course, is not the case with other countries.  Soviet mass media,
 especially the press, have therefore-instigated., on all levels, concerted
 attacksagainst`revisionism as'expressed by Western and bloc Marxists.
 . Highly placed official writers as well as minor authors have parti-
 cipated in antirevisionist attacks.  These press attacks, although volum-,
 inous and at times vitriolic, have been fairly moderate for the most part.
 Soviet leadership, apparently, does not consider current revisionism
 emanating from outside its borders as a formidable threat-to its hegemony",
 in the Communist movement, but it does not underestimate the miasmic
 potential revisionism can develop. Therefore, it-has brought to broad
 public attention this potential in Section Five of the currently influ-
 ential Soviet theoretical text, Osnovy Marksizma-Leninizma (Fundamentals
 of Marxism-Leninism), Moscow, 1959, entitled  Teachings on Socialism
 and Communism,t, which treats critically the problem of revisionist ideas.
 .;Another widelydisseminated book pointing out the dangers of revisionism
 is V Chem Opasnost' S4vremenno o Revizionizma (In What Is the Danger of
 Contemporary Revisionism , by I. A. Khlyabich, Moscow, 1960.
 Soviet antirevisionist literature is geared to attack all philos-
 ophic, aesthetic,~and political- deviations, but primarily the principal
 "revisionist misconceptions" concerning the indispensability of the die-
 tatorship of the proletariat,. the natural growth of capitalism into
 socialism, laws governing the transition from socialism to Communism,
 democratic centralism, and, primarily, the: leading role of the CPSU.
 This antirevisionist literature has become, interestingly enough,
 even more voluminous in the USSR during the first quarter of 1960 than.,
 in the. last 6 months of 1959.  The growing importance of this problem
 .is evident to'the reader from the length of the following list:

 As has been pointed out, there is no reason to assume that the
 critique of revisionism is of great concern .to the Soviet leaders, although
 some of its theoretically least important aspects may be, such as the inter-
 pretation of the term "peaceful coexistence."  Another possible source of
 concern may be in the steadily mounting number of unorthodox literary
 efforts, which have appeared in such periodicals as Literaturnaya Gazeta,
 Novyy Mir, and other less significant provincial literary journals.
 lss.
 These heterodox  literary works are by no means revisionistic. They are.,,
 rather, deviations from the officially accepted and proscribed codes
 adopted for the correct literary interpretation of life-in a Communist
 society.  But that Soviet leaders are concerned over the publication of
 these "deviationistic" literary efforts can.be:..seen from the numerous
 'attacks and criticisms against them.
 A meeting of Communist writers in Leningrad, reported in Literaturnaya
 Gazeta, 10 November 1959, severely criticized Sergey Voronin's story "In
 His Native Village" (V Rodriykh Mestakh).  Critics at the meeting said that
 the story could not be used to educate youth, that the basis of the story
 was the false idea of forgiveness for all, and that it demobilizes the
 reader rather than educates him.  A. Reshetov tried to justify the story
 on  ''psychological, grounds," 'and Voronin himself rejected all criticism
 directed at his story.  Everyone present, however, acknowledged the story
 to be ideologically detrimental and called on the party committee to
 discuss the work of the journal Neva, which published the story in its
 September 1959 issue.  The story dealt rather sympathetically with.a man
 who had b
 t
 een a
 raitor during World War-II.
 Yevgeniy Yevtushenko's poem,,"Consider Me a Communist" (Schitaute
 ,Menya Komunistom), published in Yunclst', No 2, February 1960, was
 criticized by D. Zaslavskiy in Pravda, 28 February 1960.  The hero of
 the poem demands to be considered a Camthunist because he is fighting

 are now persecuting other "genuine" poets.  Zaslavskiy, noted for his
 bitter attacks on individuals in especial disfavor 'with party''ckitias;
 criticized Yevtushenko for not broadening his. horizons in thei5oem.and
 for not choosing a more serious theme.
 I ..
 M. Kirillov, in Literaturnaya Gazeta, 13 February 1960,;'criticized
 Yevtushenko,for.exag.gezating the seamy side of Soviet life and,'for seeing
 scoundrels everywhere.  According to Kirillov,-the poem showed the  poet's'
 ideological inmiaturity and lack of experience  in life, and a deafness to
 all that is,new and has become a part of the country in recent years.
 Yevtushenko was further criticized by V. Buskin,.who stated in Literatura
 i.Zhizn', 4 March 1960, that the poet had'.adopted a?"romantic posewhich
 is both invented and false.
 V. Oskotskiy, Yu. Surovtsev, and A. Yakubov, correspondents for
 Literaturnaya Gazeta, in an article on 24 March 1960, criticized the
 novelette Tz~opinki  The Paths), by S. Zunnunova, which had appeared in
 the Uzbek literary journal Shark Yulduzi, because of its collection of
 morally depraved people.  The author of the novelette seemed to believe
 that one cannot move along the broad road of Communism without passing
 through mistakes and delusions or.passing over steep and twisting paths,
 and the more people stumble the better they will be.
 In an article in the 14 April 1960 issue of Literatuznaya Gazeta,
 A. Salynskiy, secretary of the Board of Writers Union, USSR, bitterly
 criticized the. play "Five Evenings" (Pyat' Vecherov), by A...Volodin, and
 .said that life is poor and uninspired for Volodin's heroes.  They see
 nothing interesting for themselves in the grand life of the country; they
 have a sense of futility.  Volodin is guided by the idea that a person
 is to be appreciated for himself alone and not for what he has done.
 According to Salynskiy, the play's author needed a more powerful inspira-
 tion, a feeling of civic spirit, and a deeper understanding of socialist
 humanism.
 In a Moskovskaya Pravda article of 29 January 1960, V. I. Ustinov,
 first secretary of the Moscow City Party Committee, criticized 0. Skachkov,
 author of the play "Thieves of Silence" (Vzlomshchiki Tishiny), for imitat-
 ing A. Volod.in and for depicting his characters as banal because of their
 spiritual insignificance and prevalence of irresponsibility regarding
 the moral and ethical foundations of man.
 A criticism of V. Tendryakov's novelette,  Troika  Semerka i Tuz (A
 Trey, a Seven, and an Ace), No~Miirr, No 3, March 19.0, by D. Starikov,
 in Literatura i Zhizn', 15 April 1960, revolved around Tendryakov's
 description of:.workers not as individuals but as weapons of work, and
 his incorrect knowledge, of the life of ordinary workers.

 On 29 April 1960, Pravda carried the final three chapters of A.
 Tvardovskiy's poem "Distance Beyond Distance" (Za Dal'yu-Dal'); the same
 three chapters were also published in Novyy Mir, No 5, May 1960. Of
 these, the second and longest chapter is a rat er sober account of various
 ;aspects of the. Stalin era.  In this chapter Tvardovskiy contrasts the
 'general situation under Stalin with the post-Stalin period, and the con-
 trast is sharp and clear.  Under Stalin all was dull, dark, and foreboding,
 while in the post-Stalin period al4 is light, gay, and dynamic.  The poem
 was reviewed in Literaturnaya Gaz.ea, 17 May.1960, and in Literatura i
 Zh~ izn', 13 May 1960.  What is interesting here is that both reviews speak
 only of the first and third chapters of the final three, and omit the
 second.which concerns the Stalin era.  Does this imply that'Sotiet leaders
 are still so concerned with comments on Stalin that it is best not to
 mention him at all, and that those who do are unorthodox?

 Disagreement With Soviet Policy; Deviation Among Intellectuals
 The Chinese Communists have always been alert to' domestic revision-
 ism among the intellectuals and to international revisionism and its
 disruptive effects on the solidarity of the socialist camp, but the high
 points of Chinese concern have been during the "bloom and contend" period.
 and after the Hungarian revolution, both in 1956,'and during late 1959
 and,early 1960, when the Chinese made no effort,to hide their disagree-
 ment with the peace policy of the Soviet Union.
 BY 1959, the Chinese; of course, had already won Soviet acquiescence
 to a certain degree of independence in'policies and in ideology, but even
 against such a background, the. 1959-1960 statements'have been very strong.
 In the article "Long Live Leninism' by the editorial board, in the 15 April
 issue of Hung Ch'i, the then current views of the Soviet Union on the pos-
 sibility of peace with the capitalists were lumped together with positions
 that could apply only to the Yugoslav revisionists.  This lumping together
 can be interpreted as an effort to make the article's reference to-the
 Soviet Union less obvious, but may also be a deliberate insult.
 The editorial board dealtwith a very wide range of subjects, but
 its opinions may be summed up as opposition to.any stand that tends to
 .slow down the revolution (in the "oppressed countries" as well as in
 the capitalist countries) or dilute revolutionary elan.  The board,
 speaking mainly to the USSR, declared as revisionist the sacrificing of
 long-range for immediate interests, belief in a change of heart for
 peace by the capitalists, belief that peace is possible while capitalism
 exists, and belief that force is not needed to effect the transition to
 socialism.
 The board's stand was summed up in the following passage:
 "The. members of our Communist Party are struggling to protect world
 peace and to realize the policy of peaceful coexistence.  At the same
 time, we are supporting the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peo-
 ples against imperialism.  We are supporting the revolutionary wars of
 the oppressed peoples for liberation and social progress. We do so
 because these revolutionary wars are righteous.  Naturally, we must also
 continue to explain to the masses Lenin's thesis on the bourgeois imperial-
 ist system as the source of modern war and Marxism-Leninism's thesis of
 the final goal of our struggles as the replacement of imperialism.with'.
 socialism and communism.  We must not cover up our principles when before
 f.

 Approved For Release 2000/09/14: CIA-RDP78-00915 R001200120003-2
 The Chinese stand has been propagated in publications below the national
 level as well as in foreign attention-catching periodicals like Hung:C'ki'i?
 An article in the 1 Aril issue of Li-lun Hsueh-hsi, official organ of
 the Liaoning provincial party cond.  ee pu  is a  in Shen-yang,, repeats
 almost all the points taken up in "Long Live Leninism" in slghtly dif-
 ferent words, which, if anything, makes the disagreement of the Chinese
 more explicit.
 In domestic revisionism, the journals directed at the intellectuals,%
 such as the Peiping Hsin Chien-she, and the literary journals, such as
 the Tientsin Hsir Kang and the Peiping Wen-i Pao, have frequently carried
 articles which"refuted," "criticized," o`r discussed" opinions and
 theories of various intellectuals.  Esin Chien-she, especially, seems
 to have this as one of its regular functions.  Among the personalities
 criticized to varying degrees since'the beginning of 1959 have been Ma
 Yin-ch'u and Feng Yu-Lau, both perernial favorites for such criticisms;
 Hou .Wai-lu, for his theory on the "'principle of the feudal productive
 relationships"; Kuo I-ts'en, for his theories on the nature of psychology;
 ChanMu-shih, for his theory on the'selective nature of the mind; Wu Ta-
 kun, for his views on American economic crises; Ho lin, for his theory on
 knowledge and action; Lu Shu-heiang  for leaving reality when studying
 gra mar, Fu Ssu-nien, for his reactionary viewpoint and method in?histot-
 ical-studies; and Chu Ming-ch'ien, for his old concepts on the study off.
 art.
 At present, the main object of attacks (since the attacks on Ma Yin-
 ch'u for repeating his stand on birth control have subsided) is Pa Jen  .
 (Wang Jen-shu), a.prominent literary figure who has been given appropriate
 official posts in the past.  During'the "bloom and contend" period, Pa
 Jen had taken advantage of the temporary relaxation of bans on the expres-
 sion of dissenting views to write a.short article entitled "On Human
 Sentiments;" published in Usin KaJng; the article criticized proletarian
 literature as being devoid of humaiz sentiments and full of politics, and
 advocated instead of class struggle's, search for those human sentiments
 which are common to everyone.  He said that "Class society suppresses
 the basic nature'of mankind and therefore we have class struggle.  I
 think that. things are just like this."  (From a reprint of his article

 The question is answered by Li Hsi-fan, in Hsin Chien-she, as
 follows:  "The problem is not in the article 'On Human Sentiments,'
 because'its reactionary and false viewpoint has already been exposed and'
 criticized by many comre4es.  Nor in the problem only in the fact that
 his is actually an old weapon of the bourgeoisie.  The problem is how 'l
 is it that this corrupt theory of human nature can still form a kind of
 opposition current to'confront socialist letters?  Seen from one point
 -of view, Pa Jen is still not completely isolated.   When Pa Jen published
 his article? the Shanghai Wen-i Yueh-pao published Ch'ien Ku-yang's
 "On'"Letters Is the Study of Man."' Wasn't this also 'the using of the
 same thing' to propagate the idea that so-called 'humanitarianism' is
 the motive power for the development of letters, and idea that has been
 propagated before?"... (Hsin-chien-she, No it, Apr 60, p 17)
 Pa Jen"s stand is criticized by Yao Wen-yuan in Wen-i Pao thus:
 "The 'people'.of Pa Jen, stripped of their camouflage, are the 'person'
 of capitalist individualism, the 'person' of capitalist human nature.
 Why i it that in this period, 'people' are especially the object of his
 'attention' and 'concern'?  It is because after the capitalist class had
 lost its economic foundation, the people who were determined to keep the
 capitalist world viewpoint to the end felt that capitalist individualism
 is the opposite of socialist revolution and were unwilling to abandon
 the capitalist world viewpoint for the proletarian world viewpoint, so
 naturally, they increased their 'attention and concern' in, regard to the
 problem of how to maintain and protect the 'social existence' of capital-
 ist human nature.  Revisionism in art is generally one of the manifesta-
 tions of the. struggle between the capitalists and the proletariat, and
 is extremely clever."..(We (Wen-i Pao, No 2, 26 Jan 6o, p 31-41)

 Denial of Revisionism
 The official position of the PKI (Indonesia Communist Party) con-
 cerning the possibility of revisionist tendencies within the party was
 categorically stated by D. N. Aidit, chairman of the Central Committee,
 in an article on the Sixth National Party Congress in the September-
 October 1959 issue of Bintang Merah.  The full.text of the pertinent
 passage follows:
 "The Sixth National Congress condemned the disgusting practices of
 the Tito clique of modern revisionists who, in words, profess to be out-
 side the iB erialist camp but who in actual fact assist the imperialists
 in trying to split the international anticolonial,and peace-loving front
 by slandering the Socialist, countries headed by the Soviet Union, to split
 :Approved For Release 2000/09/14: CIA-RDP78-00915R001200120003-2
 the international Communist and working class movement, to split the move-
 ment for national independence bydrawing over to their side naive leaders
 of the national bourgeoisie in newly in4eper+dent Asian and African countries.
 "It is a fact that the revisionism of the Tito clique does not find
 the slightest response in the Communist Party of Indonesia.  This does
 not mean, however,'that the Indonesian, Communist-s may remain passive in
 the fight against this dangerous deviation.  The Indonesian'Communists
 have the international duty to save the; international working class move-
 ment, to continually strengthen the international anticolonial and peace
 loving front.  Besides this, chauvinism fanned by the right wing of the
 Indonesian national bourgeoisie is soil on which the reactionary ideas
 of the revisionists can grow and this constitutes a ,threat against the
 purity of Marxist-Leninist ideology within the PKI."
 The most interesting feature of these remarks is the degree to which
 Aidit is concerned with revisionism's appeal to the national bourgeoisie.'.:
 This. is a very natural concern, for, on the one hand, revisionist ideas .
 are not apt to ' persuade the nationalist  `middle forces" of the merits of
 participation in the national united front, which remains the basic tac-
 tic of the PKI; and on the other hand, the PKI is a party whose cadres
 are themselves largely of bourgeois or landlord origin.  They have not
 as yet been thoroughly indoctrinated with the principles of Marxism-
 Leninism and, by the party's own admission, fall easy prey to the attacks
 launched on the philosophical fortress of the working class by the
 "imperialists" and the national bourgeoisie.  As the last paragraph
 quoted above suggests, this threat of contamination is particularly ser-
 ious' when the principle of proletarian internationalism must ' compete
 against the appeal of a campaign such as that currently being waged
 against the Chinese.'by the Indonesian nationalists.
 It should be noted, however,.that whatever dissension may exist
 within the PK1, it is extremely rare for an open debate or clash of
 opinions to occur between the proponents of either a more radical or a
 more reformist viewpoint than that held by the present middle-of-the-road
 leadership.  During the past 4 years, there have been only two instances
 where open disagreement on party policy; was noted within the party press.
 In June and July 1956, the economic editor of Harian Rakjat wrote three
 articles expounding the concept of "incomplete socialism" which, showed
 the influence of the Yugoslav experience.  At the fourth plenary session
 of the Central. Committee in August 1956, these ideas were condemned and
 the PKI's adherence to orthodox Marxism-Leninism reaffirmed.  (See Sum-
 maries No 1095, 11 October 1956, end No 1331,a4 May 1957,'for coverage
 of this controversy.)  Then, on 8 Januaxy'1959, Harian Rakjat published
 a rebuke issued.by the executive of the PKI Constituent Assembly frac-
 tion to Alimin, former secretary-genera. of the party, for writing a
 pamphlet in which he expressed what might loosely be termed "Stalinist".
 views, criticizing the PKI for failing, among other things, to pursue

 the class struggle.  (See Summary No 2099, 19 March 1959, for the full
 text of this rebuke.)  As regards revisionism itself, after an initial
 period of hesitation in the spring of 1958 concerning the proper attitude
 to take toward the Yugoslav heresy, the PKI eventually assumed a com-
 pletely orthodox position which it has steadfastly maintained in the
 ensuing  years.  (See.Summaries No 1898, 10 September 1958, and No 2223,
 25 June 3.959-Y
 Nonetheless, despite the lack of material actually expressing
 revisionist or other dissident opinions and despite, or perhaps because
 of, the party's own protestations of ideological unanimity, passages
 such as the Aidit statement quoted above lead one to suspect that all
 is not quite as: unanimous as the party would like it to appear.  Occa-
 sionally, there are even indications that basic party policies have been
 questioned.  An example of this is to be found in the political report
 to the eighth plenary session of the Central Committee in August 1959,
 when Aidit remarked. that some party members asked why they should support
 the new cabinet's program since it was not a gotong-rojong cabinet, thus
 implying that the validity of continuing to pursue a united front policy
 had been questioned because it had failed to pay off by gaining Communist
 participation in the cabinet, and suggesting that some party members would
 like to pursue a more radical policy.  On the other hand, there have been.
 hints that the party is beset by rightist as well as leftist deviation.
 In an article on the sixth national congress written for the 9 September
 1959 Harlan Rakj t, Central Committee member A. Anwar Sanusi issued what
 sounded very much like a warning to comrades who might be carried away
 by the cooperative and constructive tactics currently being pursued-by
 the PKI when he said, "Service to the people...is only one aspect of the
 Communists' responsibility because opportunism or reformism is of course
 not thePKI's nature.  It is-only a part, although an important. part,
 of the class struggle which is consistently but quietly practiced by
 the Indonesian Communists."
 The party's response to. possible opposition to the present line has
 been twofold.  On the one hand, at its recent sixth congress, such persons
 as Wikana and Tan Ling Diie, who in the past have opposed the policies
 associated with Aidit, were elected to positions on the party's executive
 bodies.  "Even Alimin went so far as to become a member of the oongress
 presidium.  This may indicate that previous disagreements with these pro-
 ponents of a harder line have been resolved.  However, it may be simply
 a stratagem for exercising closer control over known dissidents, as
 simultaneously, there has been increased emphasis within the party litera-
 ture on democratic centralism and all that it implies,  (See, for example,
 Utarjo's article in the July-August 1959 Bintang Me'rah, as published in
 Summary No 2503, 18 March 1960.) In an article on tie PKI Peasants Con-
 ference by B. 0. Hutapea, which appeared in the June 1959 issue of Bintang
 Meerrah  it was made quite. clear that where ideological training fails to

 re-educate party cadres with erroneous views, they will be replaced "if
 this is necessary in order to break down the ideological barriers stand-
 ing in the way of implementing the politidsl tasks.of the party.".
 However, since the PKI's main difficulty in achieving ideological
 conformity results from a simple lack of knowledge on the part of its
 members rather than from opposition based on principle, primary stress
 is placed on education rather than discipline.  At present, there is an
 intensive campaign within the party to strengthen its Marxist-Leninist
 foundations.  Adequate training in, orthodox Communist theory will help
 to destroy the "remnants of bourgeois ideology" which continue to plague
 the PKI and will presumably prevent the development of revisionist ideas
 by filling the vacuum which now exists with the correct philosophy.
 Certainly, a relatively high level of theoretical sophistication is needed
 to follow the complicated reasoning used to determine, for example, the
 present stage of the Indonesian revolution.  Therefore, it might be an
 exaggeration to conclude, from the amount of attention given to such a
 problem in the party literature or:even from the admission that there
 are people who do: not understand the bourgeois-democratic nature of the
 Indonesian revolution at the present stage, that there is actual resis-
 tance to the present leadership's line on this or any other basic issue
 on theoretical grounds.  Consequently, at least until such time as the
 PKI's program of ideological training has been carried out, it may be
 possible to accept, .idit?s claim that there is no revisionism within
 the PKI.  Except for the anonymous economic editor of Harlan Rakjat, the
 only' identifiable spokesmen of an opposition group within the party have
 been leftist rather than rightist deviationists, and again considering
 the present low level of theoretical competence, it is open to question
 whether there is any prospective dissident within the PKI capable of
 formulating a genuine revisionist position in Marxist-Leninist terms.
 Adherence to Moscow Ideology; Role of Literature
 A survey of recent issues of a. wide range of overt North Vietnamese
 source materials (see list at end of this section), including the daily
 organ and the monthly theoretical journal of the Lao Dong Party and ? the
 Journals of various other literary organizations, does not lead to
 :identification of any forces or elements within the country which can
 be labeled as revisionist.  Nor does this survey clearly indicate that
 any of the policies or lines-being followed by the party or government
 diverge from the orthodox positions maintained by Moscow.  One major gap,
 however, restricts the validity of this conclusion.  This gap arises from
 the limited availability and the relative ignorance of the literary works
 which are being published in,North Vietnam.  Their scope'and character

 .remain largely unknown; hence this survey is unable to provide any real
 answer now to the question of whether or not they may be serving as
 .vehicles, as is the case in some East European Satellites, for the more
 subtle expression or enunciation of revisionist or dissident opinions
 that may-prevail within the country.
 The survey made here generally supports the conclusion that the party
 and the regime in North Vietnam remain faithful to the ideological ortho-
 doxy as dictated by Moscow, and are in "good standing" in denouncing
 revisionism.  There is no lack of evidence to document this.  In April,`
 for example, wide press coverage was given to marking the 90th anniversary
 of Lenin's birth and th the 15th anniversary of the liberation (in 1945)
 of Hungary from the "fascist yoke."  Nhan Dan, daily organ of the Lao
 Dong Party, on 1 April carried an. editorial entitled "We Must Realize
 the: Real Significance of 'the 90th Anniversary of Lenin's Birth."  This
 editorial asserted that "the best way to celebrate Lenin's coming 90th    ?
 birthday is to endeavor to study Marxism-Leninism and to learn from the
 life and work of Lenin....  After Marx and Engels, Lenin was the greatest
 leader of the Communist and workers parties, of the working class, and
 of laboring people the world over."  Quoting President Ho Chi Minh, Nhan
 Dan  added that "the name of Lenin and'h'is philosophy are closely related
 with each victory of the camp of peace and democracy, which stretches
 from the Elbe to the Pacific and from the Arctic,to the tropics."  Con-
 tinuing, the editorial declared that "throughout the world, the social-
 ist camp headed by the Soviet Union'has become more united and single-
 ininded than ever before."
 In connection with the anniversary of the Hungarian liberation, Nhan
 Dan on 4 April editorially praised the Hungarian people's determination
 in "smashing the 1956 counterrevolutionary violence, the distortions and
 disruptive plots, the cajolery and sabotage of the imperialist gang headed
 by the reactionary Americans....  This testifies to the great vitality
 of the new regime acid to the Hungarian people's attachment to their rev
 olutionary success, to their: vanguard party, and to-the-socialist camp
 headed by the Soviet Union....  The Hungarian.. Socialist Workers Party,
 headed by Janos Kadar, is now more united and mightier than ever,before.
 Its relations with the masses have grown closer and closer.  The party
 has-basically triumphed  in the ideological struggle over revisionism
 on the one hand, and over sectarianism and dogmatism on the other."
 Of some pertinence to the subject under survey was an article in
 the April issue of Hoc Tap, the party's monthly theoretical journal, by
 A. F. Okulov, editor of the Soviet journal Voprosy Filosofii (Philosophical
 Problems).  This article, entitled "Lenin's Great Contributions to the
 Development of Marx's Philosophy," was written especially for Hoc Tap,
 presumably in connection with the-90th anniversary observances.  Okulov
 accused opportunists of believing that there are evils in capitalism but
 that they need merely wait and capitalism would be changed into socialism

 by peaceful means and without class struggle.  He quotes Lenin's attack
 on revisionism on the grounds that "the ideological source of revisionist
 philosophy is the denial of Marxist principles on the party spirit of
 philosophy... and the denial of the absolute truth that Marxist political
 principles are closely related ...to the Marxist philosophical theories."
 In the field of literary activity in North Vietnam in recent months,
 an article in the February 1960 issue of Nghien'Cuu Van Hoe (Literary
 Studies), by an unidentified author named Nam Moe discusses at length
 the character and role of literature in a socialist society.
 In this article Nan Moc quotes Vice-Premier and Politburo member
 Truong Chinh as saying:  "Marxism-Leninism contends that in a class
 society, literature reflects the class struggle, is certainly possessed
 of a class spirit, and serves an obvious political line....  Our litera-
 ture is definitely on the'side of our national interests and those of
 the working people, and acknowledges the leadership of the Vietnam Lao
 gong Party.  This is a characteristic of the Vietnamese artistic and
 literary movement in our present, era.  It also demonstrates the party-
 mindedness of the literature of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam."
 In further-explaining TruongChinh's statement, Nam Moe outlines
 the precepts and rules which should govern Vietnamese authors in their
 writing.  These are:
 1.  "A literature possessed of party-mindedness is primarily a
 literature for the service of the revolution..'.. 'Literature must remain
 close to the taske and responsibilities of the revolution."
 2.  "The revolution under the leadership of the party aims at noth-
 ing but liberating the working class and laboring people from- oppression
 and exploitation.  Therefore, when we say that literature must serve the
 "evolution, we mean also that literature must serve the people."
 3.  "A literary work imbued with party-mindedness is one which makes
 the people stronger in some-way o ter they have read it:' with greater
 steadfastness in viewpoint, greater knowledge of their friends and enemies,
 more love for the regime, more hatred for the US-Diem clique, more love
 for socialism, more hatred of cap.talism, more love'for collectivism,
 more hatred for individualism, more love for work,'-more hatred for exploita-
 tion, more faith in the party, and more enthusiasm for the, implementation
 of its policies."
 The author then explained that for a writer or artist to be party-
 minded-he must:

 1.  "Primarily, penetrate the social life of the masses of workers,
 peasants,, and soldiers....  Under our regime, the working people are the
 masters of society; therefore, the arts must reflect the working people'.s
 thoughts,, sentiments, and actions in all aspects; they must describe the.
 most progressive workers, peasants, and soldiers in production and in the'.
 class struggle."
 2.  "Understand the Marxist-Leninist viewpoint and the party lines
 and policies, so that he can reflect reality."
 3.  "Respect the party leadership in every aspect.  Party-mindedness
 in literature can be realized only through party leadership.  This is
 only natural.  There is no reason why literature,*which is an essential
 part: of :revolutionary work,: should not be under the leadership of the
 party because revolutionary'work as a whole is under its leadership.....
 The party has educated the writer in Marxism-Leninism, in lines and
 policies,,.in the revolutionary spirit, and in the spirit of serving
 the'people;... and the party has encouraged writers to.penetrate into
 realities, and to penetrate: into the masses.  By doing this, the party
 has created favorable conditions under which.writers can produce good
 works."
 . In the papers and periodicals surveyed, there. is no evidence that
 any of the contributors do not adhere rigidly to all the stipulations
 mentioned above.  On the other hand, such stipulations, especially made
 by one as powerful in the party as Truong Chinh, might be construed as
 a warning to those in North: Vietnam who might have revisionist tendencies.

 Relations With Soviet Union and China; Internal Dissension
 Very few individual commentaries on party ideology by Mongolians
 appear in the press.  Internal party differences have existed and still
 do exist, but most of them seem tobe hazed on personal interests.
 Marxist-Leninist ideology at the international level is-interpreted by
 most Mongols as that which is defined, by the Soviet. authorities.  In
 recent times the Mongols have also supported the three red banners of
 the People's Republic of China,-i.e.,the general,line, the big leap
 forward,, and the people's communes.  There has been no effort to analyze
 any contradictions between Soviet and Chinese interpretations of the
 meaning of Marxism.-Leninism.
 relations With Soviet Union
 Political and economic contract with the Soviet Union has been longer
 and more intimate than withany other; socialist country.  At present, all
 ,major speeches of-N. Khrushchev and h*.s associates are translated in full
 and published, frequently'in the official newspaper, Unen. Khrushchev's
 comments on foreign affairs are accepted verbatim.  Condemnation of the
 U-2 plane-incident, for example, follows the Soviet line. Political theory
 is discussed in the party journal, Namiin Amidral (Party Life).  It
 strongly supports decisions with regard to international solidarity as
 ,expressed at the 21st Congress of the.Communist Party of the Soviet Union,
 :geld in Moscow, January-February 1959.
 During May 1960, many articles appeared concerning Lenin and Lenin-
 ism in honor of the 90th anniversary of his birth.  Of the four published
 in Unen, two were written by Tomor-ochir, Chief Secretary of.the Central
 Committee of the Mongolian People's Republic.  Translations of Lenin's
 works are published regularly, and.Marxism-Leninism is referred to con-
 stantly as the key to international party solidarity.

 Tsedenbal, Chairman of the Council of Ministers, speaks fluent Russian,
 and in politics he is pro-Soviet.
 J. Sambuu, Chairman of the Presidium of the Great National Rural,
 was touring European Satellite countries during May.  In East Berlin he
 stated that the Mongolian People's Republic fully supported the principles
 of peaceful coexistence as proclaimed at the Bandung Conference.  In the
 Soviet Union-he was very well received by the authorities.  .
 Relations With Communist China
 Since 1952, relations between the Mongolian People's Republic (MPR)
 and the 'People's Republic of China have been steadily improving. China,
 as well as the Soviet Union, has extended long-term credits to Mongolia
 from time to time for economic and technical aid.--Recently the Mongolian
 press hae tended to support the policies inaugurated early in 1958 by
 the Chinese government.  On 6 April 1960, Unen published a translation
 of an article by Yu Chao-li, which first appeared in the Peiping Hung Chi.
 Its subject was "Imperialism as the Source of War and the Struggle of the
 Peoples of the World to Maintain Peace."  Lenin is quoted with regard
 to "special conditions" which require "special reforms."  On 15 May 1960,
 Unen published an article by S. Choyjamts, member of the delegation from
 the Great National Rural visiting China.  It praised the successful
 development of the Hung-hsing (Red Star) Commune. near Peiping, stating
 that "the great-leap forward and the victory of the people's communes
 are a great tribute to Marxism-Leninism and to'the People's Republic of
 China."
 On 7 May 1960, an information agreement was signed by representatives
 of the Mongolian People's Republic and the People's Republic of China.
 The persons involved were J. Dzunduy, chairman of the Information and
 Broadcasting Administration of the Mongolian, People's Republic, and. Mei
 Yi, chairman of-the Broadcasting Administration of the People's Republic
 of China.
 Articles which were complimentary to Chinese economic policies pre-
 ceded the arrival of Chou En-lai at Ulan Bator on 27 May 1960.  The pur-
 pose of his visit was..to draw up a Sino-Mongolian Treaty of Friendship
 and Mutual Assistance.  He was greeted at the airport by Tsedenbal; J.
 Sambuu; L. Tsende, Second Secretary of the Central Committee; and D.
 Molomjamts, First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers. He was
 accornpan.ied. by Vice-Premier Chen I.  Many other people were present.
 On arrival,'Chou En-lai remarked that his last visit to Mongolia
 was in 195+; he then proceeded to condemn "US imperialism, which wrecked
 tlhe'summit.conference in Paris."  Tsedenbal welcomed him heartily and
 in his speech referred several times to the wise leadership of Mao Tse-
 tung.  Chou En-alai remained in Mongolia for. several days, and after the
 signing of the treaty left Ulan Bator by special plane on,   June 1960.

 Mongolian People's Republic:"  Since Mongolia is situated between China
 and the Soviet Union, a reasonable amount of compromise may be necessary
 to maintain a' minimumamount of independence.
 Internal Dissension (1937-1960)
 Internal political dissension within the NPR has a long history.
 The issues giving rise to such dissension generally fall into the same
 pattern, namely, traditionalist and nationalist views as against sub-
 servience: to either China or the Soviet Union., Three important personali-
 ties who were purged as a result of such dissension were Ts. Jamtsarano,
 Dashiin Damba,-and Dr. B. Rinchin.
 Jamtsarano was a noted scholar and popular figure in his country.
 Ardently nationalist and anti-Russian, he published many scholarly studies
 on Mongolian history and folklore.  One of his works was on the Khalka
 Law from the Yuan Dynasty through the 17th Century.  The original
 Mongolian text of this work appeared in 191; a Russian translation,
 with explanatory notes, was'issued later.  Jamtsaranb was sent to the
 University of. Leningrad in the mid-1930s to work, presumably under N.
 N. Poppe.  However, he became one of the first victims of a major purge
 and was sent to prison in 1937.  He died in prison 2 years later.
 Dashiin'Damba was long a strong supporter of the Mongolian People's
 Revolutionary Party (MPRP).  In April 1954, when Tsedenbal was released.
 from his duty as first secretary of the party, Damba replaced him in
 this post.  This move seemed to be an attempt to emphasize""collective
 leadership," because Tsedenbal retained his post of Chairman of the
 Council of Ministers.  When the 12th Congress of the MPRP met in
 November 1951+, it reappointed Damba as first secretary.
 At the 13th Congress of the party in March 1958, DambA condemned
 the praise,given the late Marshal Choybalsan, indicating that it violated
 the Leninist principles of "collective leadership."  He also charged that_
 certain "revisionist tendencies" existed among the Mongolian intelligentsia.
 His comments appeared to indicate a pro-Chinese Communist attitude.  His
 attack on the "personality cult" also appeared to pose the question.: did
 it also refer to Tsedenbal?
 Late in October 1958, Tsedenbal visited Moscow.  When he returned
 to Ulan Bator he again assumed the position of first secretary of the
 party.  A meeting of the MPRP Central Committee late in November 1958
 reduced Damba to his'former position as second secretary.  Four months
 later, he was dismissed from the Politburo:  On 30 March 1959, he was
 expelled from the Presidium of the Great National Hural and disappeared
 from the public scene.

 Damba was excluded ~frora the high councils of the MPRP "for lack
 01' principles, conservatism and inertness, conceit and lack of critical
 att3t~4e toward hSmmal,i', and opla(?rtvnism, o,eeor?ricniecl by distortion and
 ahoftporiings in hirs work."  On )r April 1960, Unon published a long ar-
 ticlp discussing his defects, which made -it- clean that the name Damba
 was now a symbol of dissidence to be avoided at all costs for successful
 political development.
 Dr B. Rinchin is`a well-known. scholar who still corresponds' with
 many people in Europe and America.  He Is multilingual and was director -
 of the Language and Literature Section in the Committee of Sciences of
 the M PR-  He. was removed from this post early in 1960 because of his
 obvious anti-Soviet views and his traditionalist and nationalist in-
 terests.                             Rinchin has stated that Mongolian studies have declined greatly
 since the death of Vladimirtsov and the exile of N. N. Popped
 In the fall of 1959, Rinchin published Jamtsarano's'Khalka Law (old
 Mongolian legal code).  IIe was subeequencly charged with inducing his
 students to be anti-Moscow.  His chief opponent in the MPR was Tsevegmid,
 who made most of the charges against him and irho claimed that the articles
 written by Rinchin were in the sane, spirit as -those of Pasternak in the
 Soviet Union.  Tsevegmid resigned his,post as chairman of the Committee
 of Sciences, but grad appointed First Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs.
 Rinchin now lives alone (supported by his daughter, who is a
 teacher) and continues to work on Mongolian folklore studies.  Some
 time ago he wrote a novel., Da%?rn in the Ste  es  (which has also ap-
 peared in  Chinese, Korean, and Czech).---
 The latest action against Rinchin was a resolution passed by.the
 Politburo of the Central Committee of the WR criticizing his contradic-
 tory views.  The resolution stated that Rinchin never accepted the new
 concepts of revolutionary socialism  nor did he ever sympathize with
 basic Marxist-Leninist ideology.  It was pointed out that his patriotic
 ,and nationalistic views were merely 'a cover for his personal ambitions,
 His contradictory views were likened to those of Damba,.who had already
 become, a symbol for deviationist words and deeds.

 1.    Published References to Ernst Friedrich Wollweber
 The following survey is based on references to Ernst_"'Wollweber
 found. in scanning all available 1958, 1959, and 1960 issues of Neues
 Deutschland, the central party daily; Einheit, the month]y party jour-
 nal; and Neuer Weg, the Central Committee organ on party life published
 twice a month.
 It should be noted that, with the exception of comments found in
 the Neues Deutschland coverage of the 35th plenum proceedings of Febru-.
 ary 1953, .almost all references to Wollweber were made in alliance with
 and frequently subordinate to the chief target of criticism, Karl
 Schirdewan.  Thus, the "Schirdewan-Wollweber Group" or "the group made
 up of Schirdewan, Wollweber, and others" or the "Schirdewan, Wollweber,
 and Ziller Group" are variously referred to throughout 1958; references.
 after 1958 were confined simply to the "Schirdewan Group."  No unquali-
 fiedly favorable comments regarding Wollweber were found.                               The following
 represent all excerpts directly referring to Wollweber as they appeared
 in the Neues Deutschland coverage of the 35th plenum of February 1958,
 at which Wol weber was removed from the Central Committee "in connection
 with his offenses against the party statute" and at which he was strongly
 censured (Neues Deutschland, 8 February 1958).  These also represent the
 most substantive material found on Wollweber during this period.
 8 February
 '.'...Several comments on the attitude of Comrade Wollweber are
 necessary here.  The Central Committee has been informed, in three meet-
 ings, of questions pertaining to the work of the Minister for State Se-
 curity.                                 Comrade Wollweber had falsely evaluated the situation.  His
 false: evaluations and ideas hindered the organs of the state security from
 executing its necessary tasks.  Comrade Wollweber criminally neglected
 the fight against enemy agents.  Investigations revealed that he failed
 in his work.  Instead of doing his work, he tried to recruit other com-
 rades for fpctional activity in the Schirdewan group.  In the course of
 this factional activity, much foolish talk was spread. Enemy gents could-ac-
 quire knowledge of internal party questions which they used against the
 party.
 "Comrades Schirdewan, Wollweber, and others were obviously of
 the opinion that party policy, as it had been worked out by the Central
 Committee, would lead to problems.  They speculated on the problems con-
 nected with the further development of socialist transformation of the
 GDR...."  (From the Politburo report on the 35th plenum)

 "...Comrade Wollweber has said here [at the 35th meeting of the
 Central Committee) that he has no differences [of opinion] on the sues-
 :ion of party policy and especially that he has not taken part in fac-
 tional activity.  One must try to make this clear.  But we have had two
 discussions with Comrade Wollweber, in order to clarify matters;....
 Comrade Wollweber says he never placed Comrade Schirdewan in oppositi
 to Comrade Ulbrieht.  No one said that he had...; nevertheless,,-'the fa.-
 is that he has popularized Comrade Schirdewan as the coming man.   ...We
 asked him [Wollweber];  You have certainly talked with Comrade Schirdewan
 on the situation in the Politburo?:'  He answered:  This I have also never
 disputed. I only dispute the fact that this is factional work.' But he
 did have discussions with Comrade Schirdewan on questions [being considered]
 in the Politburo.  The question, therefore, is:  How did Comrade Woolweber
 know that there are disputes and differences of opinion in the Politburo?
 About what have they talked?...  The fact that Comrade Schirdewan not only
 had personal and friendly relationswith Comrade Wollweber, but also spoke
 about all party questions and all questions on the situation in the Polit-
 buro, is clear.                       There can be no differences of opinion  on this.
 "...Comrade Wollweber feels himself to be falsely treated and
 has differences [of opinion].  All those who have differences find their
 way to each other...." (Hermann Matgrn, at the 35th plenum)
 "...Comrade Schirdewan has obviously passed oh false reports of
 certain decisions and discussions or disagreements within the Politburo.
 Yesterday Comrade Schirdewan said that he had not dealt with these differ-
 ences outside the collective.                       But Comrade Wollweber knew of the differ-
 ences within the Politburo.  Comrade Wollweber and Comrade Schirdewan must
 answer the question:  Where did Comrade Wollweber learn of these differ-
 ences?  Obviously'from Comrade Schirdewan....
 "Regarding Comrade Wollweber, this is my personal opinion:  I
 have valued him as an old and experienced comrade and I am much younger
 than he and have also much less experience than he.  But today I must
 say that Comrade Wollweber has played a ruinous role, and precisely be-
 cause he has had so many great experiences in the class fight.  Why did
 he not openly see to it that these differences were cleared up if he
 thought such differences existed?  Why did he not come to the Politburo
 or to the Central Committee?  It has already been said here that one
 cannot consider this anything other than distrust of the Central Commit-
 tee.

 "Comrade Woliweber showed no initiative in issues where it was
 necessary precisely for stabilizing the republic and if I were to judge
 him today,, I would say:  He has failed politically and also morally; for
 he was certainly an old and experienced comrade with decades of party
 work [behind him] and should be a model [to others], like! all old com-
 rades...."  (Willi Stoph, at the 35th plenum)
 26 February
 "...How does it happen that comrades who have had a responsible
 place in the revolutionary workers movement, such as Comrades Woliweber
 and Schirdewan, have gone astray on the road of factional work and deny :
 what they themselves have taught in speeches and articles as the law of
 the party, as the law of stabilizing the republic?...
 "At the basis of Comrades Schirdewan and Wollweber's concept
 lie a false evaluation of the political situation and a concept which is
 in opposition to the line of the Central Committee,... an underestimation
 of the imperialist danger, a tendency toward evolutionary development.
 The danger exists among old officials who have had great responsibility,
 that they do not become masters of themselves, that they either do not
 master the...desire toward power and arrogance or that when they receive
 a blow from the party for their behavior, they are in danger of falling
 into passivity and sulking silence.  I believe these things play a role
 with Comrades Woliweber and Schirdewan; when such comrades cannot become
 masters of themselves, then the party must help them, and if this does.
 not suffice, the party must bring them to this by means of the hardest
 measures...."  (Franz Dahlem, at the 35th plenum)
 An editorial in the 9 Feburary 1958 issue of Neues Deutschland
 made the following accusation:  "The entire course of the 35th meeting
 of the Central Committee brought clear proof that Comrades Schirdewan
 and Woliweber had serious vacillations in questions of principle and
 tactics of party policy and that, following repeated and sharp criticism
 by the Central Committee, they undertook an unprincipled and factional
 fight against the party leadership....  Schirdewan and Woliweber inter-
 preted the results of the 20th Congress of the CPSU in an opportunistic
 manner.  They did not realize that the tensions in Germany cannot be
 reduced if the GDR is not thoroughly stabilized and strengthened.  Both
 had a false evaluation of the situation in the fall of 1956 and later.
 As a result, Schirdewan underestimated the subversive work of NATO di-
 rected against the GDR,, the activity of hostile groups, and the penetra-
 tion of bourgeois ideology.  Wollweber's false.evalun of the situation
 "
 led to a criminal neglect of the fight against enemy agents.

 The 22 February 1958 issue of Neues Deutschland pointed to increased
 production pledges in I3ezirk Karl-Marx-Stadt as  proof of the workers'
 ;rust in...the party policy and as refutation of the gossip [Geschwaetza,
 :af the opportunistic group of,Schirdewan, Woliweber, and others."  Polit-
 a=o member Heinrich Rau was cited in the next day's issue of this paper
 as saying at a party ;acticrists  meeting that the Schirdewan-Woliweber
 group tried to distort the Politburo formulations on the need to set up
 realistic plans and that this group sought to establish "soft plans" which
 would involve little difficulties and would slow down the rate of develop-
 rent.  He also said, "the group of'Schirdewan, Woliweber, and others?con-
 sidered the main task to be that of unconditional [ohne irgendwelche
 lorbedingungen) reunification, thus, reunification at any price.  The
 first task, however, is the socialist development of our country...."
 An article in issue No 5, March 1958, of Neuer Weg,said,,!"Schirdewan
 and Woliweber? underestimated the intensification of the class fight
 which is taking place in our country under the conditions of the exis-
 tence of two German states with different social systems.  They mini-
 mized the...enemy and the existence of hostile groupings....  Schirdewan
 -epresented the dangerous theory of letting things develop by themselves
 and of opening valves [granting more freedom].'  Comrade Woliweber in-
 terpreted several measures for the :further development of our socialist
 '.emocracy and for relaxing the international situation in such a way that
 :e believed one could gradually abolish security measures against the
 -lass er ny."  This same accusation was made against Wollweber in the
 ,arch 1958 issue of Einheit.
 In the 13 March 1958 issue of Neues Deutschland, it was pointed out
 that "to destroy German militarism,'-r~ e should not strive for a balance 11 between imperialism and socialism, as would have resulted from the concept
 of the Schirdewan-Wollweber group."
 In the light of Wollweber's Commnznist resistance activity'against
 the Nazis in World War II, the East German Committee of Antifascist Re-
 sistance Fighters published its complete support of the 35th plenum de-
 Visions in,,.the9 March 1958 issue of Neues Deutschland, in which it
 "`sharply condemned the opportunistic group of Schirdewan, Wollweber, and
 others which, through the formation of a faction, tried in an underhanded
 gray to change the party line and leadership....  It deeply moves us that
 those involved were Schirdewan, Woliweber, and Selbmann, former resis-
 tance fighters from whom we demand that they, in word and deed, draw the
 .Lessons from the past struggles of the German working class.  The honor-
 able title resistance fighter is deserved only by those who recognize also
 today the party' leadership and protect the unity of the party...."

 In the minutes of the Seventh All-German Workers Confergnce, held
 in Leipzig in March 1958, Hermann Matern accused Wollweber again of neg-
 lecting his function as Minister of State Security, from whicch post
 Wollweber had resigned in October 1957 "for reasons of heal,?."  Follow-
 ing a statement ridiculing the idea of elections in East Germany, he
 said Schirdewan believed in "allowing all possible freedom in our coun-
 try or opening valves,' as he [Schirdewan) called it....  We have dis-
 cussed. these questions with these comrades [Schirdewan, Wollweber, and
 .0elssner) for almost 1 1/2 years and have tried to convince these com-
 rades of the harm of their standpoint....  The comrades whom we have
 removed from our party leadership believed that we should go slowly in
 building socialism, in the interest of coming together with West Germany.
 This was the idea of Schirdewan and of Wollweber, who as Minister for
 State Security was of the opinion that we need hardly be on the alert,:
 that nothing more could happen in our country.  This is not true, al-
 though we are stable enough."  Also contained in these minutes, which
 were published in the 18 March 1958 issue of Neues Deutschland, a Com-
 rade :Konrad .from  westerns Westphalia was quoted as saying that
 "particularly in the past few years, Wollweber has been violently cri-
 ticized in the West German press; but in that moment when he and the
 others were removed from the Central Committee...Wollweber suddenly
 became the man of the West German press."
 The May 1958 issue of Einheit went further, in the words of Kurt
 Hager, in accusing the "group of Schirdewan, Wollweber, and others of
 .the belief that a development toward socialism without conflict was
 possible, i.e., this group was directed toward a policy of stagnation
 and preservation of the status quo, which would have ultimately led to
 restoration of capitalist elements....  They were oriented one-sidely
 toward a broad democratization in the sense of a liberal development and
 underestimated the need of a constant fight against the enemies...."
 An article by Alexander Abusch, Deputy Minister of Culture, in the
 June 1958 issue of Einheit says that the "important point about the group
 of Schirdewan, Wollweber, and others was not that they deviated ideolo
 gically...and condemned our party to a lack of influence, but that they
 represented the embod~ment of revisionistic currents of 1956 as a fac-
 tional group which represented (in many cases, unconsciously) a community
 of ideas."'
 Critical mention of the Schirdewan-Wollweber group continued through
 the Fifth Party Congress held in July 1958, but no essential additions
 were made to the above comments.
 Judging from press references of this period, the effects of the
 Schirdewan-Wollweber group continued to be most apparent for a time
 among party and trade union officials in factories.  Paul Verner, at
 the Fifth Party Congress, said (as reported in'the'16 July 1958 issue of
 Neues Deutschland), "It cannot now be proved [but it is suspected] that
 the views of the Schirdewan group, which are known to have reflected the

 vacillations and illusions of certain, backward circles and the pressure
 of the enemy, were also expressed.in'.the trade unions and still exist here
 and there today."  The 30 July 1956 issue of Neues Deutschland, in an
 article urging that "revisionism in trade unions be c ears  up "d~says,
 "the secretariat of the central governing committee of the IG t ndus-
 trial Trade Union] for the Chemical Industry did not consider it nec-
 essary to draw conclusions applicable to its work from the exposure of
 the factional group of Schirdewan, Wollweber, and Ziller, or to'disp'ute
 the revisionist and opportunist views:emanating from this group."  The
 July 1958 issue of Einheit, in pointing out that party and union leaders
 at a Leipzig printing machine plant were slowing down production and
 supporting an alleged "human" socialism, said, "The extent of the ideo
 logical morass'of this party organization is obvious from the fact that
 their annual report contained no condemnation of the...Schirdewan,
 Wollweber, and Ziller group."
 Following publication of the Fifth Party Congress Resolution in
 July 1958, no other direct substantive references to Woliweber or the
 Schirdewan group were found in 1958 sources.
 At the beginning of 1959, at the fourth meeting of the Central Com-
 mittee, Walter Ulbricht made the fol.awing statement, which appeared in
 the 20 January 1959 issue of Neues Dettschland and in the January 1959
 issue of Einhe l.t :
 "The Policy of the Schirdewan :group -- that of letting things run
 along by themselves, and the stagnatidn of social development -- is based
 on the simple idea'that socialism consists primarily in the building of
 factories, after which the socialist transformation of agriculture, the
 inclusion of the petit-bourgeoisie in socialist development, and the for-
 mation o: Socialist consciousness on the part of the masses will follow
 of itself.  In contradiction to this,~we stand on the ground of material-
 ist dialectics:  The principle has been confirmed through practice that
 it is not simply a question-of development, but of socialist transforma-
 tion."
 Only seven amore brief references to the group (not mentioning
 Wollweber's name) were found in 1959 sources, none of which substantially
 supplement what has been reported above.  Two of these references, more-
 over, were contained in the self-critical statements of Karl Schirdewan,
 Fritz Selbaiann, and Fred Oelssner in the September and November (No 18
 and 21) 1959 issues of Neuer Weg.  No 1960 sources have as yet yielded
 references to either Wollweber or the Schirdewan group.

 2.  Disunity Among Literary Theorists; Stagnation of Marxist Literar
 Theory
 The following excerpts are taken from an article published in the
 East Berlin monthly periodical Neue Deutsche Literatur, May 1960.
 "'...Socialist-realist literature today is new not only because it
 has a new political character, reflects new social situations, and sets
 optimistic goals.  It is new...in its entire aesthetic-historical struc-
 ture....  However, because it  does  not  acquire  these new qualities
 spontaneously, but rather according to a law, the discovery of new aesthe-
 tic laws developed from history must be connected with the discovery of
 social, reality itself.  Thus, it is extremely important at this time for
 Marxist aesthetics and scholarship in literature...to analyze what new
 social and literary practice has thus far developed....  The time is
 certainly ripe for a more rapid development of theoretical knowledge in
 the field of literature in the GDR...and for a comprehensive theoretical
 agreement among our writers.  In so doing, it is to be hoped that several
 literary theoreticians will overcome their dogmatic and often lifeless
 ideas on the special characteristics of the creative process, and also
 that several writers will give up the ... remnants of a perceptible tendency
 to concentrate on purely technical-organizatiorfal tasks while neglecting
 theory.  Thus, it is necessary that the German Writers Union develop the
 arrangements for a basic discussion between its members and persons from
 the field of literary scholarship and to carry out common planning, which
 is certainly not yet always the case.  (The fact is that today disagree-
 ment prevails among union members even on what appear to be simple con-
 cepts and terms.  How can we speak of a common platform when we are not
 in a position ...to attain agreement on basic concepts of Marxist literary
 theory and on basic concepts of our creation?)...
 ."The socialist worker as both the hero and consumer of literature
 'determines literature's epochal being and determines on a higher histori-
 -cal level of literary development the principles of national literature..
 "...It is false to look on the individual elements of portrayal
 (e. g., the selection of material and a hero) from the restricted view-
 point of usefulness.  It is just as false to follow bourgeois traditions
 by trying to add a few additional types to literary characters created
 from a conventional and purely. sociological conception, in order to ex-
 pand the number of characters; these methods have been used for a very
 long time by naturalistically oriented bourgeois literature.  It will
 also not do to give literary form to a current political task by adding
 [in literary work] different tasks to it [the current political task]...
 or placing details,,. rather than the essential things, in the foreground.
 Artistic activity which recognizes the general historical role of the
 working class.. but neglects to reveal the qualitatively new characteris
 tics,t,in the historical. development of the class, will remain unfruitful....

 "The tendency to look on the great classic bourgeois literature of
 the past as a preparatory phase of socialist realism is certainly not
 oorrect. The treasures of our literary heritage...are an integral part
 of our...natione.l socialist culture.
 "Regarding our national literary tradition, many problems..,,.are only
 superficially known and have hardly been processed scientifical:y....
 +or example, what is the plebeian tradition in German literature which
 extends from Lenz to Buechner to Bertolt Brecht?  ...Is there a clearly
 recognizable direction toward a definite type of socialist novel?  And
 how is it historically founded?  What. laws do we discover in literary
 history where an emerging class places its heroes in new and higher
 aesthetic relationships?  These...questions cannot be answered by West
 German bourgeois literary scholarship....  With a few respectable ex-
 eptions..., West German scholarship is only capable of a...one-sided
 view df the historical past or of a deeply pessimistic judgment of their
 future.  How can it be otherwise in view.of a literary situation which
 is'...in its last period?...
 "Since there has recently appeared in well-known novels here a cer-
 tain schematism iii portraying negative hharacters, we should learn from
 Anna Seghers the art of drawing negative: characters from a historical-
 aesthetic standpoint....  [Literary] theory cannot offer a recipe to,
 individual authors, but it can make them aware of certain problems;
 e.g., the discovery [development] of a realistic fable, about which
 --.fell-known novelists in our republic unfortup.ately have very divergent
 views, or the discovery of new conflicts in human life, as Anna Seghers
 has done....  Even so, the actual source of art can never be theory, but
 only reality.   'All works of literature,. the products of a progressive
 ideological attitude..., are the result.!..of national life reflected in
 the mind of the writer' (Mao Tse-tung).  One thing is clear:  Anna Seghers
 and others have already attained the basis of a new socialist exemplari-
 ness, in that they have, through the....new hero of our literature, the
 consciously socialist...worker, portrayed GDR society...as ever pro
 gressing....  In this, these works clearly differ ... from bourgeois and.
 classic novels...."
 A discussion at the April Cultural Conference, as reported in the
 4 May 1960 issue of Der Z rgen, East Berlin daily newspaper, included
 the following comments:
 "...Our .[literary] hero is not a radiant hero.  He has had a hard
 past and a difficult development.  Our hero stands before human problems
 which demand political decisions, so that there is simply no question of
 this having] a cheap opt..mism.  These [heroes] are people who want to be
 taken seriously....  I have heard from the Western press that we [in East
 uermany] are in the midst of a process of mass leveling and that such out-
 standing artists as Professors Kraemer, Arnold, and Mohr are a product
 of this leveling.  I must honestly admit that I do not understand this...."

 Lenin IB.eale in "Party Democracy" and in Guarding Party Secrete
 An article by Sandor. Szerenyi, titled "Lenin -- Creator, of a New
 Type of Revolutionary Party," appeared in the April 1960 issue of
 Partelet.  The first half of this article discusses the history of
 Communist Party organizational principles -- Marx's Federation of
 .Communists in London 113 years ago, the social democrat parties of
 the turn of the century, Bernstein's revisionism, and Lenin's strug-
 gle with the Mensheviks -- and proceeds to Lenin's view of the party
 as the vanguard and militant general staff of the labor class.  The
 author, Sandor Szerenyi, quotes at length from Lenin-Sztalin  Part e-s.11,
 page 91)) which stresses that the party must be purged not only of
 "Mensheviks and reformists," but also of "outstanding Communists" if
 they harbor any "inclination to vacillate or sway over to the side of
 'unity' with the reformists."  Szerenyi concludes the first half of
 his article with'the observation that the victory of the Great October
 Socialist Revolution proved. the correctness of Lenin's organizational
 principles.
 The following excerpts are from the second half of the article.
 "...]n recent years, revisionists, exploiting the transitional
 .errors connected with the cult of personality, have again revived the
 old organizational debate.  Everywhere, but especially among us, the
 .revisionists attacked the party in order to deprive the working class
 of its most important weapon,. because they denied the Lenin principle
 of the leading role of the working class and of the party....  They
 prated that 'the principle of centralism is bureaucratizing the party?
 that 'party spirit and party discipline are outmoded concepts' which
 impede the development of free debates and impede further development.
 They protested that the Lenin organizational principles of the party
 were outmoded, that they were valid only for illegal circumstances.
 Their every attempt, exploiting the real errors. committed by Matyas
 Rakosi and his group, was aimed at breaking party unity, turning the
 .party members against the party leaders and the masses against the
 party....
 "The events of the Hungarian counterrevolution convinced every Com-
 munist and,,, in general, all clear-sighted men, that one ofthe most im-
 portant sources of errors and troubles was just that the old leadership
 had turned from the Lenin principles.  The troubles arose, not least of
 all, from the fact that there was satisfactorily realized within the party
 neither the principle of democratism, the freedom of debate of the Com-
 munists, nor the principle of centralism, against the revisionist and
 Approved For Release 2000/09/14: CIA-RDP78-00915R001200120003-2
 sectarian-dogmatic elements destroying party unity.  Similarly, the only
 correct policy of principle was not sufficiently realized with the labor
 class or in general with the working: people.  Frequently, the sword of
 the dictatorship of the proletariat was turned against honest revolu-
 tionaries instead of against the class enemy and its revisionist toadies.
 "The Lenin rules of party building and party life are not outmoded'.
 On the contrary.  Their general, international validity and correctness
 have been proved before the world.  And if the Hungarian and the inter-
 national revolutionary worker movement has achieved results (and who
 would deny that it has achieved great results?) since the 20th Congress
 of the CPSU'or since the defeat of the Hungarian counterrevolution, then
 this is largely due to the fact that we have returned to the Lenin prin-
 ciples.  Never again will it happen that we will let ourselves be swayed
 from the Lenin norms of party life    from a consistent realization of
 the principle of democratic centralism, from the principle of collective
 leadership, from a maintenance of party democracy and strict party disci-
 pline, from a honoring of the right of criticism, or from a following
 of the necessary self-criticism, or from a consequent ideological strug-
 gl.               on two fronts against all sorts of erroneous, revisionist, subjectiv-
 ist,'sectarian-dogmatic, or, in a word., any anti-Marxist view.  And we
 will do everything in'the interest of ensuring the leading role of the
 party...."
 Szerenyi quotes at length from Khrushchev's speech to the Hungarian
 seventh Party Congress to the effect that it is improper to say that the
 criticisms voiced at the 20th Congress of the CPSU were too sharp.
 Szerenyi continues:
 "...Learning from previous mistakes, we consistently realized in
 our party the Lenin principle of democratic centralism.  Not only does
 the membership democratically and secretly elect all the leading organs
 from below, but it also debates in a wide circle all the more important
 questions.  At the sake time, we have strengthened voluntary party dis
 cipline.   The res',lotions are binding and the party organs take care to
 maintain them.  Never has the guarding- of party secrets occurred so
 smoothly as since the defeat of the counterrevolution.
 "The ideological-political, and crgenizational unity of the party and
 of the Central Committee is strong and unbreakable!  We must here note
 that we did not achieve this by avoiding debates.  On the contrary.  Com-
 rade Kadar said at the National Party Conference:                     'I believe that the
 Central Committee has debated more [since the 1956 revolt] than in the
 past 5 years put together.'  But these debates take place on a basis of
 'principle, in that spirit'of'Communist humanism which permeates all our"
 party work:  We fight not against men but against errors, patiently,
 humanly,' with persuasion and not with administrative tools.

 "In addition to a consistent realization of the principle of col-
 lective leadership, it .s of extraordinarily great significance in the
 .strengthening of party unity that now, for the first time ifi party his-
 tory, the three .iving labor generations are together -- the 1919ers,
 the fighters of the years of illegality, and the young posiliberation
 cadre....  Within the party we make no differences betweenfthe-former
 social democrats and the former illegal Communists.  It'is, against the
 Lenin party building and organizational principles to makany distinc-
 tion according to occupation,; origin, earlier worker movement affilia-
 tion, age, or sex, or from any other viewpoint....  Our party has only
 members of equal rank....  Unfortunately, such distinctions are made
 here and there.  But luckily,'both the leading organs and the party mem-
 bers are acting ever more swiftly and ever more determinedly against
 such distortions of Lenin organization principles....
 "It is the task of the party to use every effort, everywhere, al-
 ways, and under, all circumstances to win the masses.  There must be
 trust. in the masses coupled with proper distrust of the class enemy....
 Even today, one of the chief obstacles in our struggle to win the masses
 is the remnant here,. and there of dogmatic thinking and sectarian poli-
 tics....
 "Correct selection of party cadre and the arming of them with the
 science of Marxism-Leninism, with the Lenin methods of party work -- this;
 is an exceptionally important task.  Our party cadre has developed greatly,
 especially in the complex struggles of the past 3 years....  From the
 viewpoint of educating the party cadre in a Lenin spirit, that statement
 of Comrade Kadar is especially significant according to which Communists
 need not be exceptional men, 'but only men in the true sense of the word.'...
 "In his famous  book titled What Is To Be Done? Lenin worked out the
 ideological basic principles of a Communist party....  He clearly exposed
 the deepest roots of opportunism,... the bowing down before ideas of
 spontaneity....  Our party has drawn much from this teaching of Lenin.
 With its aid we have smashed the various revisionist 'theories,.' not for
 getting the harmful nature of subjectivism, sectarianism, and dogmatism...

 Introduction
 As, the word was originally used, in an open society, "revision-
 ism" meant reformist as opposed,to revolutionary Marxism.  Behind the
 Iron Curtain it refers to any person or policy, now condemned, who erred
 in the direction of.liberalism.  In these two senses the term cannot be
 meaningfully. applied to dissident trends discoverable in the open journals
