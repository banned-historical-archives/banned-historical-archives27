			    	Tokyo  JPS  in  English  0920  GMT  8  Sep  79  OW
																										~
			     	[Text]    	Tokyo,   	Sep  8,   	JPS--The  Liberal  Democratic  Party-Ohira  cabinet  on
			     	September  7  enforced  the  dissolution  of  the  Diet  with  its  own  partisan
			     	interests  and  in  collusion  with  the  Socialist,  Komei  and  Democratic  Social-		    	r
		_		     	ist  parties.    	The  35th  general  election  thus  was  decided  to  be  proclaimed			 	-
			     	on  September  17  and  the  voting  on  October  7.
			     	The   	~ocialist,  Komei  and  Democratic  Socialist  parties  on  September  7  pre-
			     	sented  a  non-confidence  motion  in  the  lower  house  plenary  session,   	thus
			     	helping  the  dissolution  of  the  Diet  by  the  LDP.    	The  Cotnmunist  Party  argued
			     	that  although  the  Ohira  cabinet  is  not  worthy  of  confidence,  but  the  presen-
			     	tation  of  non-confidence  motion  to  the  Diet  at  this  state  is  nothing  but
			     	to   	lend  a  hand  to  such  LDP  maneuver,   	to  arbitrarily  dissolve  the  Diet  without
			     	holding  deliberation  on  bills  relating  to  people's  urgent  needs.    	The  Com-
	  	-		~	  	-munist  ~'arty  thu~  severely  criticized  such  moves  and  did  not  join  in  pre-
			     	senting  the  motion.
			     	The  JCP  Dietmembers'   	(?group)  on  the  same  day  held  a  general  meeting  and			  	~
			     	was  resolved  to  win  a  victory  of  the  party  in  the  general  election.    	Presid-		  	_
			     	iurn  Chairman  Kanji  Miyamoto  said,   	"Let  us  put  an  end  to  the  mal-administra-
			     	tion  of  the  LDP  and  achieve  well  ~ne  big  task  to  establish  new  Japan  in  the
			     	198U's".
			     	Miyamoto  called  on  the  Dietmembers  to  "do  their  best  to  defeat  the  LDP  and
			     	at   	the  same  time  defeat  the  anti-communist  parties  which  have  lent  a  hand
			     	to  the  LDP  even  at  the  final  stage  of  the  Diet,   	and  concentrate  severe
			     	criticism  on  all  these  parties.    	Let  us  win  a  victory  of  the  JCP,   	a  genuine
			     	progressive  party".																   	~
			     	On  behalf  of  the  incumbent  JCP  Dietmembers,   	Secretariat  Chief  Tetsuzo  Fuwa
			     	also  expressed  his  determination,   	saying  "we  shall  meet  here  again  as  a
			     	winner".    	131  JCP  candidates   	for  the  general  election  on  the  same  da~  in
					front  of  major  station  bills  throughout  the  country  and  took  to  the  street
					for  campaign.     	[Sentence  as  received]    	They  denounced  the  "collusive  disso-
					lution  of  the  Diet"  and  appealed  to  the  people  to  give  support  to  the  JCP
					for  its  victory.

			     	["Nagatocho  Doings"  column,  by  Takehiko  Takahashi,   	adviser  to  the  MAINICHI

			     	r'action  Is   	the  Aim  of  the  General  Election"]
			     	[Text]    	Prime  Minister  Masayoshi  Ohira  has  finally  succeeded  in  making  a			     	_
			     	dissolutio~n  of  the  House  of  Representatives  and  a  general  election  "definite."		   	~
			     	Why  has  Prime  Minister  Ohira  decidad  to  carry  out  a  Diet  dissolution  this
	   	'		  	autumn?    	There  may  be  high-level  political  reason  for  this.    	On  the  other
			     	hand,   	the  reasons   	lying  in  a  low  dimension  cannot  be  ignored.
			     	The  most   	important  political  problem  facing  Prime  Minister  Ohira  is   	to  be
			     	reelected  as  president  of  the  Liberal-Democratic  Party  in  next  year's
			     	party  election.    	Because  of  this,   	he  believes   	ir  necessary  to  increase  the
			     	number  of  pro-Ohira  party  members   	and  Diet  members.
			     	Most  party  members  belong  to  associations  supporting  Diet  members.    	Accord-
			     	i.ngly,   	to   	increase  the  number  of  pro-Ohira  Diet  members  wi11  have  the  same
			     	meaning  as   	increasing  the  number  of  party  members  supporting  Ohira.
			     	In  order   	to  increase  the  number  of  pro-Ohira  Diet  members,   	it   	is  essential
			     	to  increase  the  number  of  formally  recognized  candidates  attached  to  the
			     	Ohira   	faction  and  to  give  them  sufficient  financial  support,    	For  this
			     	purpose,   	the  party's  secretary  general,  who  belongs  to  the  Ohira  faction,
			     	must   	take  command  of  the  general  election.
			     	At  the  time  when  Ohira  became  the  LDP  president,   	confusion  rose  within  the
	   	~		  	party  over  the  secretary  general's  post.    	The  newspapers  reported  that  a1-
	   	-		  	though  President  Ohira  had  at   	first  conside,red  Zenko  Suzuki  for  the  post,
			     	the  Fukuda  faction  and  others  raised  objections  and  Ohira  suddenly  switched
			     	to  Kunikichi  Saito.
			     	Nevertheless,   	at  a  meQting  recently  of  the  party's  reform  headquarters,
			     	0}iira  declared,   	"I  had  thought  of  Saito  as   	the  secretary  general  from  the
	    	a		  	beginning.    	It  was  not  a  temporary  move."									  	.

					The  Truth																				-
		~		     	It  is  bPlieved  that  this  statement  by  Ohira  is  the  truth.    	This  is  supported
		-		     	by  the  Ohira  faction's  report  on  political  funds  that  was  made  public  re-
		-		     	cently.    	From  about  July  last  year,   	a  considerable  amount  of  money  was  dis-
	 	'		     	bursed  by  the  Ohira  faction  in  preparation  for  the  party  presidential
	 	=		     	election.    	Tn  most  cases,   	Saito  was  the  recipient  of  this  money.    	This  means
					that  the  pres~nt  Secretary  General  Saito  was  a  man  whom  Ohira  trusted  the
					most  in  the  handling  of  the  money.
					The  Ohira-Saito  combination  had  already  been  formed  at  that  time.
					The  term  of  office  of  the  secretary  general  and  other  party  officers  is
					one  year.    	When  December  comes,   	if  the  secretary  general  is  aga~n  from  the
					Oh:ira  faction,   	the  rise  of  anti-Ohira  feeling  within  the  party  will  became
					inevitable.    	It  might  be  n?r.�~ssary  to  give  t~.p  the  selection  of  the  secre-
					tary  general  from  the  Ohira  fa   	`i_on.
					Under  such  circumstances,   	it  is  essential   	for  the  general  election  to  be
					held  while  Secretary  General  Saito  still  retains  his  post.    	If  that  is  done,
	 	.		     	i.t  will  be  possible  to  carry  out  drastic  mea~ures   	to  in  order  to  increase
					pro-Ohira  strength.
					This  strategy  of  Prime  Minister  Ohira  and  Secretary  General  Saito  of  the
					Ohira  faction  is  being  strongly  opposed  by  the  Fukuda,  Miki  and  Nakasone
					faccions.
					On  August  23,   	Takeo  Fukuda,  Taiceo  Miki  and  Yasuhiro  Nakasone  met,    	The			     	_
	 	_		     	biggest  problem  taken  up  during  the  talk  was   	the  Ohira  faction's  strong			    	_
					attitude  toward  the  forthcoming  general  election.									 	_
					This  concerns,   	first  of  all,   	the  problem  of  those  informally  decided  as
		-		     	party-recognized  candi.dates.    	It  is   	the  artempt  of  the  Ohira  faction  to
					eliminate  those  newly  seeking  to  become  candidates   	from  the  anti-mainstream
					factions  in  favor  of  those  filling  candidacies  from  the  Ohira  faction.
		-		     	Di.fference																		    	-
					In  an  election,   	there  is  a  big  difference  between  candidates   	formally  recog-		  	~
					n.ized  by  the  party  and  those  who  are  not.    	If  formally  recognized,   	financial		  	_
	 	-		     	help  will  be  forthcoming  from  the  party  and  they  can  be  assisted  directly				-
					in  local  regions  by  Diet  menbers  belonging  to  the  LDP,    	~n  addition,   	in-			  	-
					fliaential  LDP  politicians  will  go  to  the  aid  of  formally  recognized  candi-
					dates.
		~		     	There  will  be  none  of  this  kind  of  support  for  a  candidate  who  is  not  form-
					ally  recognized  by  the  party  and  who  runs  as  an  independent  conservative.
					Accordingly,   	there  are  some  who  may  give  up  their  candidacy  just  because
					they  fail  to  be  formally  recognized.    	This  is  what  the  Ohira  faction  is
	 	_		     	aiming  at  in  order  to  achieve  "success  zn  strategy."

					  	Tokyo  THE  DAILY  YOMIURI.in  English  2  Sep  7S  p  2  OW
					  	[Editorial:    	"Makeshift  Energy  Policy"]
																										  	.
					  	[TextJ    	The  Comprehensive  Energy  Council's   	interim  report  on  the  nation's
					  	long-range  energy  prospects  fails  to  convince  us  as  being  realistic.
					  	The  report  is  merely  warmed-over  stew.    	It's  a  rehash  of  the  preliminary
					  	seven-year  economic  projections  prepared  in  1977,  which  served  as   	the
					  	basis  fcr  setting  oil  import  targets  at  the  Tokyo  summit.
					  	Once  upon  a  time,   	in  the  good  old  days  when  we  were  assured  plentiful  sup-
					  	plies  of  oil,   	it  was  possible  to  fix  the  economic  growth  rate  and   	then
					  	calculate  how  much  energy  was  needed  to  attain  the  set  target,    	Tt  wasn't
					  	a  f.oolproof  formula,  but  it  somehow  worked.
					  	iae  now  discover  that  the  Comprehensive  Energy  Council,   	an  advisory  organ
					  	to  the  International  txade  and  industry  minister,   	is  still  using  this
					  	arcliaic  method  in  working  out  its  latest  estimates  wnen  we  are  not  even
					  	assured  of  stable  supplies  of  oil.    	It's  placing  the  cart  before  the  horse
					   	to  figure  out  energy  demand  when  there  may  be  no  supply  at  a11.
					  	Juggling  the  Books
					   	It's  reported  that  members  of  the  council  stretched  the  estimates  of  energy
					   	supply  in  order  to  balance  it  with  demand  so  as  to  attain  a  5.7  percent
					   	growth  rate  in  the  seven-year  economic  program.
					  	Originally,'it   	is   	to  be  recalled,   	the  nation's  economic  growth  rate  was  set
					   	at  under  4  percent  based  on  a  calculation  of  possible  energy  supplies.
					  	However,   	an  order  went  out  from  on-high  to  attain  a  5.7  percent  growth  rate
					   	and  the  books  were  reportedly  juggled  to  stretch  the  energy  supplies.
					  	When  the  seven-year  economic  program  was  mapped  out,   	it  was  calculated  that		   	~
					  	we  would  need  to  import  7  million  barrels  of  oil  a  day  in  1985  to  sustain
					   	a  5.7  percent  gxowth  rate.

				     	Can  such  an  important  matter  as   	the  nation's  s~ven-year  economic  program  be
