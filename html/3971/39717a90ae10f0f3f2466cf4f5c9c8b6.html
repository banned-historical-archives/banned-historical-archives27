 INTELLIGENCE MEMORANDUM*
 The Leadership Upheaval in Communist China
 SUMMARY
 Communist China has,  in a sense,  entered a transi-
 tion period even before Mao's final departure.   Mao's
 absences from the public scene are growing longer and
 longer,  suggesting recurring illnesses, perhaps of
 growing seriousness.   Circumstances surrounding his
 last absence for five and one-half months this past
 winter and spring are unknown,  but it is inconceivable
 that events would have unfolded as they have if his
 grip on the party had not slipped.
 Mao Tse-tung probably remains the dominant leader,
 an.d can probably impose his will, but at least since
 November has not had the sure sustained control of
 events that a party leader aims at;  he is more de-
 pendent on his key lieutenants than he used to be;
 and not all of them are thoroughly reliable in his
 terms.   It is possible, moreover, that he is being
 pushed by ambitious colleagues to turn over to them
 more and more of the party machinery and the authority
 to make domestic and foreign policy decisions.   It
 could be that we are seeing the beginning of the end
 of the long Mao era.
 At the present moment,  the situation is highly
 fluid,   Disclosures already made point to a power
 play  by Teng Hsiao-ping,  the powerful general secre-
 tary of the party, who seems to be making a bid to
 replace Liu Shao-chi as Mao's deputy in the party
 and therefore the heir apparent,  and in this he may
 be succeeding.   Teng is probably working with or
 *Prepared by the Office of Current Intelligence
 and coordinated with the Office of National Estimates.

 using Lin Piao,  whose place in the army would make
 him a useful ally. Teng probably built the case
 that led to the recent ouster of Peng Chen,  a rival
 in Mao's inner circle of advisers,  and is probably
 attempting to place loyal followers in key spots
 throughout the party, security,  and military ap-
 paratus.   Peng Chen has already been replaced in the
 Peking city apparatus with one of Teng's proteges.
 Teng is in a key slot. As general secretary
 of the party and ranking member of the secretariat,
 he controls the day-to-day business of the party
 machine. There are important parallels between Teng's
 position today and that of Stalin and Khrushchev when
 they made their bids for supreme power.
 The duration of this fight and its outcome are
 conjectural.   Forces have already been loosed which
 may be hard to cage again.   If the process is a
 lengthy one--a definite possibility--it could turn
 disorderly.   Men who have submerged differences and
 ambitions under Mao will not necessarily continue to
 do so under his successor.   The situation could even
 degenerate into regionalism, which traditionally ap-
 pears when central authority is weakened.
 We do not expect to see abrupt shifts in do-
 mestic or foreign policy while the struggle goes on.
 All the contenders--Liu Shao-chi,  Teng Hsiao-ping,
 Chou En-lai and Lin Piao-.are hardline Chinese Com-
 munists,  and quick changes are unlikely.   There
 might be some modifications in approach,  however,
 if only in reaction to the immobilism of Mao's de-
 clining years.   Any new leadership might, for ex-
 ample, elect to turn the country's attention to the
 problems it faces at home in an effort to get the
 Chinese Communist revolution moving again.

 The Fall of Peng Chen
 1.   The Chinese Communist Party,  long one of
 the most stable and tightly knit in the Communist
 world,  is being racked by an unprecedented chain of
 events which have already extended. over six or more
 months  (a detailed chronology is provided as Annex
 A).    The external manifestations of the internal
 realities of these events are fragmentary and usually
 tardy.   Firm conclusions as to what really is going
 on are a risky business,  since the known facts lend
 themselves to several explanations.
 2.   Conceivably: Mao Tse-tung may be fully in
 charge of the purge of an errant comrade or two.   If
 so,  he is proceeding in a most uncharacteristic way.
 In the past, Mao has conducted his infrequent purges
 by acting first and explaining to the Chinese public
 later.   He has shown a distaste for airing dirty
 leadership linen in public.   In the present case,
 leading party ,journals have been openly and persis-
 tently attacking one another over a period of months.
 This we take to be a sure sign of disarray in the
 higher councils of the party,  from which normally
 flow the rigid guidelines governing the makeup of
 the publications.
 3.   The hypothesis which best fits this and
 other unusual features of the Chinese political
 landscape this past winter and spring is that a
 genuine power struggle has been and is under way
 in Peking.   Central to this interpretation are both
 the case of Peng Chen, until March one of the five
 or six top Chinese Communists,  and the indications
 since his fall in April that some party leaders re-
 main unsatisfied.   Peng was a key figure in the con-
 trol of the party apparatus,  and it was whispered
 in Peking that he was a leading contender for party
 leadership after Mao was gone.   As such he was a
 natural rival of Teng Hsiao-ping,  similarly placed
 and with similar ambitions,.
 4.   The case Teng built against; Peng Chen,  the
 only important figure publicly removed so far, re-
 veals tactics which may be used to bring down other
 officials.

 5.   Peng's authority stemmed primarily from his
 senior positions in the politburo and the secre-
 tariat,  the body responsible for running the party's
 day to day affairs. He also performed largely cere-
 monial functions as first secretary of the Peking
 municipal party committee and mayor of Peking,  and
 it was through these positions that he was publicly
 attacked.
 6.   The chief charge leveled against him, but
 never specifically articulated,  is that he tried to
 pave the way for a coup d'etat.   He reportedly did
 this by directing party journals published by his
 Peking committee to print numerous essays and ar-
 ticles from 1959 through 1962 satirizing and slander-
 ing Mao Tse-tung and the party.                      Writers employed by
 him are now described as revisionist renegades of
 the worst sort.  They include men like Teng To,  a
 Peking party secretary,  and Wu Han,  a vice mayor of
 Peking.
 7.   The major work which figured in the attack
 on Peng Chen was   "Dismissal of Hai Jui," a play
 written by Wu Han in January 1961.    This play de-
 picts the trials of a virtuous Ming Dynasty (1368-
 1644) official who tried to help oppressed peasants
 and was dismissed by an unjust emperor for his pains.
 Since April,  all major party newspapers have seen
 this as a symbolic play,  in which the leading figure
 represented former defense minister Peng Te-huai,
 purged as a "right opportunist" in August 1959,   The
 unjust emperor,  of course, was taken to represent
 Mao Tse-tung,   The charges go on to claim that Wu
 Han, working on behalf of right opportunists who
 survived the 1959 purge, wrote the play both to pro-
 test Peng's removal and to encourage other survivors
 to wait for an opportunity to seize party leadership.
 8.   The charges make no effort to explain how
 the true meaning of "Hai Jui" and other allegedly
 slanderous material escaped the attention of the
 party for so many years,  and it is difficult on
 other grounds to accept the charges at face value.
 Peng Chen was long a member in good standing of the
 dominant doctrinaire group of top leaders and had
 risen in recent years.   In 1964 Peng was brought into
 the elite group of men identified as Mao's "close

 comrades-in-arms." Liu Shao-chi,  Chou En-lai, Teng,
 and Lin Piao are the others given this accolade.
 As a hardliner,  Peng has been in the forefront of
 the anti-intellectual campaign begun several years
 ago by the regime.
 9.   The opening gun for the attack was fired
 in the 10 November Shanghai Wen Hui Pao in an ar-
 ticle by Yao Wen-yuan,  a name ater linked directly
 with the attacking forces.   Yao called "Hai Jui" a
 big poisonous weed. The article was republished in
 the 29 November Liberation Army Journal, which ap-
 pended an editorial note endorsing Lao's view. The
 journal later called this an "important, militant
 and correct" view.   The Peking Daily, published by
 Peng's party committee,  a so reprinted Yao's article
 on 29 November, but added a neutral editorial note
 stating that "Hai Jui's" status was undetermined.
 This stand was promptly endorsed explicitly by
 People's Daily and implicitly by Red Flag,  the
 prestigious organs of the central committee itself.
 10.   The stand taken by these two organs means
 that Peng,  in effect, was being protected from at-
 tacks by the party leader then in charge, who would
 have been Liu Shao-chi in Mao's absence.   Peng's
 heavy schedule of appearances from November through
 March also indicates that his position remained se-
 cure.   In that period he made numerous speeches,
 some on important issues,  and greeted many foreign
 delegations.   (See Annex B).   On 1 January, Red Flag
 published a major statement which took an extremely harsh line against "cultural" enemies and attrib-
 uted this line to Peng Chen,  as well as to Mao and
 Lin Piao.   Peng's last major act was to host Le Duan,
 first secretary of the Vietnamese party, on his 22-
 25 march visit to Peking,   Le Duan may still be
 puzzling over that one.
 11.   During April,  the case aimed at Peng Chen
 began building up in the party press in a way indi-
 cating that he had come under heavy attack in high
 party circles about the end of March.,   Red Flag on
 5 April finally conceded that "Hai Jui"was indeed
 an antiparty,  poisonous weed.   People's Daily broke
 down on 8 April,  admitting that "all" articles pub-
 lished since November labeling "Hai Jui" a poisonous
 weed had been correct.

 12. The ambivalent record of the two organs
 later in April,  however,  could suggest that Peng
 was still being defended among top leaders who were
 trying to mitigate the charges against him.   Perhaps
 a better explanation is that they had already thrown
 Peng to the wolves and were busy trying to defend
 themselves.
 13.   The next major development in the case
 against Peng Chen was an abject confession by Peking
 Daily  (Pen.g's journal) on 16 April.   This bore all
 the earmarks of a last-minute,  desperate attempt to
 defend against behind-the-scenes attacks.   The Peking
 paper admitted that it had published much "antiparty"
 material in 1961-62 and that the principal authors--
 Teng To,                    Liao Mo-sha,  and Wu Han,  all Peng's subor-
 dinates--were members of an "antiparty gang."   Neither
 People's Daily nor Red Flag took note of the confession.
 People's Daily on 19 April attacked a writer not con-
 necte   with the Peking apparatus,                      possibly to divert
 attention from it.   Red Flag on 29 April again at-
 tacked Wu Han,  but no    eng To or Liao Mo-sha.
 14. By early May,  the fate of Peng Chen. appeared
 to be settled.   The Liberation Army Journal, which
 has stayed in the forefront of the attack,  declared
 on 4 May that the party was engaged in a "life and
 death" combat with unnamed "right opportunists" within
 the party.   This was the first public revelation that
 such enemies were currently active.   On 8 May,  the
 Liberation Army Journal unleashed a savage attack on
 the Peking Daily and Cen.g To.
 15.   The army journals' onslaught signaled the
 beginning of a nationwide campaign of extraordinary
 intensity.   For more than three weeks,  all party
 papers,  including People's Daily and Red Flag, were
 filled with attacks on Teng To's "black store."
 Meetings and symposia were held throughout the na-
 tion to denounce Teng To and his "backers."   Expo-
 sure of the "behind-the-scenes boss" was demanded
 with increasing frequency.   The Chinese people were
 therefore well prepared for the disclosure on 3 June
 that Peng Chen had been dismissed.   Peng has publicly
 been stripped only of his post as first secretary of
 Peking,  but the press has been treating his downfall
 in all political roles as an accomplished fact.

 16.   Behind these public revelations lie the
 facts of the matter:   that persons opposed to Peng
 Chen used the intensifying anti-intellectual drive
 set in motion by Mao in 1964 and 1965 to get Peng,
 and that they carefully built a case against him.
 The record indicates that Peng was brought down
 shortly after his last public appearance on 29 March
 and was formally stripped of his powers in early May,
 possibly after a behind-the-scenes trial during
 April.
 The Power Struggle Continues
 17.   It is possible that Mao, morbidly suspicious,
 was persuaded that Peng Chen was no longer reliable
 and condoned the purge for this and no other reason.
 This is not likely,  however.   The slow development
 of the attacks against Peng and the growing signs
 that other key figures fell with him and that still
 others are under attack strongly suggest that this
 is not a situation where a unified leadership under
 Mao is conducting a purge, but that it is a genuine
 power struggle.
 18.   The two ostensible charges against Peng--
 that he is a bourgeois revisionist opposed to Mao's
 thinking and that he aspired to the top post--are
 implausible.   Peng's record stamps him unmistakably
 as a doctrinaire hardliner.   He was sixth in the
 power structure,  and did not have enough power assets
 to pull off a coup by himself.
 19.   As already'noted,  in the past when. Mao
 found it necessary to remove an errant comrade,  he
 moved quietly,  not even hinting that a purge was
 under way until it was an accomplished fact.
 20.   If this were a purge of men who could not
 be trusted to carry out Mao's revolutionary line,
 then the wrong leaders have been brought down.
 Peng Chen,  and others on a growing list of suspects,
 are hardbitten old revolutionaries, without an ounce
 of softness,  stamped in the same mold as Mao.   They
 are mainly key officials in the control apparatus of
 the party and army,  the kind of men one would expect
 to see picked off early in a genuine power struggle.

 21.   Signs of confusion at the top last winter
 and spring--while Mao was out of sight--also argue
 that the leadership had been disputing.   Plans to
 send Chou En-lai abroad,  first detected in February,
 were repeatedly postponed in March and April.   There
 also seemed to be uncertainty in March over whether
 China would attend the 23rd Party Congress in Moscow.
 22.   The clearest evidence that factions have
 been disputing is the differing,  and at times op-
 posing,  lines taken by major party journals since
 last November.   Liberation Army Journal was in the
 forefront of the a   arc    ha   le u   imately to Peng
 Chen.'s downfall.   From November through March,
 People's Daily and Red Flag were trying to soften
 and deflect the attack.     The two fell in line after
 1 May,  but there are still signs of differences,
 and the army paper continues in the forefront.   Its
 attacks have been consistently sharper than those
 of the two central committee publications,  and other
 differences remain.
 23.   So far the Liberation Army Journal has not
 attacked the People's Daily and Red Flag by name,
 as it did Peng    en s   e ing Daily.   It has criti-
 cized stands taken by tie pair and implied that they
 had lagged in the struggle.   On 17 May the army
 journal blasted the "absurd" view set forth by the
 People's Daily on 14 April that the purpose of put-
 ting politics in command was to get work done.   Ac-
 cording to Liberation Army Journal,  the purpose
 should be to revo u ionize peop e s outlook.
 24.   On 6 June the Liberation Army Journal pub-
 lished a list of key statements on the struggle that
 have appeared in various party journals.   The paper
 represented itself and the Shanghai Wen Hui Pao as
 being in the forefront of attacks launched in No-
 vember 1965, with Red Flag entering the fray in Feb-
 ruary and People'sTaily in June.   This version of
 history,  however, was promptly disputed in an 11 June
 NCNA  (N?w China News Agency) broadcast.   The broad-
 cast agreed that Shanghai Wen Hui Pao had launched
 the attack,  but did not trekfl    e Liberation Army
 Journal with playing a role until May.   The first
 T'677-ow-ups to the Shanghai attack cited by NCNA were
 articles that had appeared in Red Flag and People's
 Daily in early April.

 25.   It is reasonably clear by now that a group
 controlling the Liberation Army Journal and the Shang-
 hai Wen. Hui Pao has   een attacking the group in con-
 trol oft e major central committee organs,  People's
 Daily, Red Flag,  and NCNA.   The attackers appeared
 to have won the first round by early May,  but the
 struggle is far from ended.
 26.   The Liberation Army Journal has been de-
 scribed recent y as an organ of the military affairs
 committee of the central committee.   Because of its
 responsibility for indoctrination in the armed forces,
 the general political department  (which is subordinate
 to Teng Hsiao-ping's secretariat) may actually publish
 the paper.   In any event,  the editor in chief is an
 old associate of Teng's.
 27.   The Shanghai Wen Hui Pao is published by the
 East China bureau of the party.   This bureau has been
 without an announced head since April 1965,  and is
 quite likely being run directly by the secretariat.
 28.   The People's Daily and Red Flag,  the party's
 most  authoritative journals,  have- always been con-
 trolled by the top leadership.                            Their secondary,  and
 at times defensive,  role in developing the attacks
 on party "enemies" is significant;  it indicates that
 the entrenched top leadership team of Mao and Liu
 was not behind the attacks.
 29.   Mao himself may not necessarily be under
 attack.     He could,  however,  be under strong pressure
 to replace Liu with a more impressive deputy to
 serve during his absences.
 30.   Much of the vacillation apparent in. People's
 Daily and Red Flag recently could be explaine    y
 Mao's reluc ancee to turn against his old comrade
 Liu.   Or,  since Mao presumably condoned the ouster
 of Peng Chen,  a Liu protege,  he may have already
 agreed to retire Liu,  but is still undecided on his
 replacement,
 31.   Whatever the explanation,  fresh disclosures
 of leadership turnover are expected,   Since Peng's
 announced ouster on 3 June,   the Peking press has
 hinted several times that there are "party overlords"
 and enemies in "very high positions" who will. not be
 able to conceal themselves much longer.

 The Role of Mao Tse-tung and Others
 32.   With the limited information that trickles
 out of Peking,  it is extremely difficult to assess
 the role of top leaders and their relationships to
 one another.
 Mao Tse-Tung
 33.   Mao's personal position is most uncertain.
 He appeared to be healthy and alert in movies taken
 when he received an Albanian delegation in early May.
 Nevertheless,  he is 72 years old,  chain-smokes,  is
 suspected of having a history of cardiovascular
 trouble,    and very likely was seriously ill for a
 period last winter and spring.   His absences from
 public view are getting longer and longer.   He did
 not make a single public appearance between 26 No-
 vember last year and early May.                      On 10 May Peking
 announced that he recently met with a visiting Al-
 banian delegation.   He has not reappeared.
 34.   The meeting came at a time when diplomatic
 rumors and press stories that Mao was incapacitated
 had reached a high point.   Foreign press speculation
 to this effect had drawn angry denials from Chinese
 Communist Foreign Ministry spokesmen on 26 March and
 3 May.
 35.   Mao's grip on party affairs appeared to be
 weak during his absence.   This is suggested by a num-
 ber of things.   Almost immediately after Mao went
 out of sight on 26 November, party newspapers began.
 taking opposing positions on issues which led to
 the ouster of. Peng Chen.  The uncertainty in March
 over whether China would attend the 23rd Party Con-
 gress in Moscow and the backing and filling in March
 and April on plans to send Chou En-lai abroad have
 already been mentioned.
 36.   There was a remarkable upsurge in adulatory
 attention to Mao as an institution in the Chinese
 press from December through March,  and again in June
 as all parties tried to wrap themselves irk Mao's
 mantle.

 37.   Most signs of leadership confusion since
 November occurred during his long absence. He prob-
 ably was incapacitated,  especially in the early
 months of his absence,  but he has been able to
 exercise a greater unifying influence since his
 return.     In. general, however,  his position seems
 to have been weakened and his current role must be
 put down as uncertain.
 38.   The role of Liu Shao-chi, who has been
 Mao's deputy in the party and chosen successor since
 the mid-50s,  is equally in question.   It is diffi-
 cult to see how Liu could avoid being weakened by
 his irresolute leadership from November through
 March as well as by Peng's downfall.    Peng had been
 Liu's deputy in the party from 1949 to 1954 when
 Teng Hsiao-ping came in and squeezed Peng out of
 the inner circle.   Liu was presumably at least
 partially responsible for Peng's comeback in recent
 years.
 39.   Liu's appearances since Peng was brought
 down in March and the slight but perhaps significant
 change in treatment of him in the Peking press sug-
 gest that his party stature has declined.   From 22
 March to 20 April,  during a period of intense po-
 litical infighting in Peking Liu was out of town.
 He was abroad for much of this period but he also
 spent a total of 15 days,  for no apparent reason,
 in the provincial towns of Hotien, Urumchi and Kun-
 ming.   There was no reception for him on his return
 to Peking or even an acknowledgement that he was
 back. No precedent is known for this omission. Even
 minor officials. are greeted publicly on their return
 from abroad.   Liu did not appear with Mao at his re-
 surfacing ceremony in May.   Liu's place at Mao's
 right hand was taken by Teng Hsiao-ping.
 40. Liu continues to appear routinely in his
 ceremonial role as chief of state  (Chairman of the
 Chinese People's Republic), but press attention to
 him as a leader and ideological authority has dropped
 off since March.   All top leaders are normally greatly
 overshadowed by the attention given to Mao,  but for
 several years Liu.,  more than his colleagues,  has

 His work "How To Be a Good Communishasn sreccom-
 mended,along with Mao's works,   as   ideological
 material.     Liu had been described as an. effective
 leader,  a reliable interpreter of Mao,  and---along
 with Mao--an authority for domestic policies.   Last
 winter Liu's name was cited in this manner two or
 three times a month,  but few such references have
 been noted since March.   (See Annex C)
 Teng Hsiao-ping
 41.   On the surface, the three remaining men in
 the top power structure--Teng Hsiao-ping,  Chou En-
 lai,               and Lin. Piao__appear to have remained in good
 shape or gained as a result of recent developments.

 graphs of that meeting show Teng, Chou,  and Lin,  in
 that order,  sitting to the right of Mao.
 42.   At the moment, Teng seems to be gaining.
 The removal of a potent rival,  Peng Chen, strengthens
 his position.   Peng's replacement as first secretary y
 of the Peking city apparatus,  North China party
 Li Hsueh-feng,  probably is a protege of Tong's.   FF ew
 of the key officials who dropped out of sight
 Peng had important past connections with Teng, who
 may well be replacing them with his own loyal fol-
 lowers.   The most important official whose status
 is in question is Lo Jui-thing,  army chief of staff
 and top security chief.   Lo has not appeared since
 27 November and,  according to diplomatic rumors in
 Peking, was removed in March.   A likely repiaeemeIt-

 Chou Enmlai
 43. Premier Chou En-lai,  China's Mikoyan in
 terms of flexibility,  appears thus far to have
 managed to stay aloof from the struggle,   He is a
 useful technician and as such has a good chance to
 survive

 Lin Piao
 44.           Contrary to western press speculation, De-
 fense Minister Lin :Pao probably is not a contender
 for the top slot. His name is sometimes used to re-
 inforce Mao's authority, but this practice goes back
 several years,   Exhortations to study the instruc-
 tions of Lin Piao as well as Mao have appeared with
 increasing frequency since the publication of a ma-
 jor article by Lin in September 1965.
 45,   Lin. Piao may be cooperating with Teng Hsiao-
 ping,  presumably the driving force behind the attacks.
 Lin's place in the army would make him a useful ally.
 It is unlikely that Lin himself, with his long record
 of illness and absence from public life,  seriously
 aspires to the top job,   This and the fact that Lin
 has little strength in the party may be reasons why
 Teng might be willing to work with him.   It is pos-
 sible that Mao now considers Lin Piao a suitable
 interim successor.   If so, Teng might acquiesce,  be-
 lieving he could use Lin as a front man.
 46.   Lin has a brilliant record as a revolutionary
 field commander and is the only military man in the
 inner circle.   This in itself makes him an unlikely
 candidate for the top post in a state that places
 such great stress on party primacy over the army.
 The Period Just Ahead
 47,   Thus,     on  the basis of all information
 available to us, we believe that a struggle for
 Mao's mantle has already broken out and will go on
 until Mao finally does shuffle off and his successor
 is able to consolidate power.   Although the struggle
 has developed with a rapidity which must have been
 startling to some in Peking,  its duration and out-
 come are uncertain at this point of time.
 48.   The process could turn out to be even more
 disorderly than it has been so far.   We cannot ex-
 pect men who have submerged their personalities and
 ambitions for years under Mao's restraining hand to
 be equally willing to do so for another figure.  Mao
 was absent for five and one-half months this past

 winter and spring and was probably ill for some part
 of this period.   His absence seems to have reminded
 party officials that he will not be around forever.
 Signs of disarray were not long in appearing.
 49.  There is indeed a chance that Mao's filial
 removal will permit differences to be brought more
 clearly into the open.   This could lead to overt
 factionalism,  affecting the cohesion and direction
 of the regime.   If the struggle is protracted we
 may even see a recrudescence of regionalism, which
 traditionally appears in China when the central au-
 thority is weakened.
 50.   The possibility of such a series of devel-
 opments would be less if the hard--driving Teng Hsiao-
 ping were able to bring down his major party rivals
 before Mao goes.   He has already been instrumental
 in Peng Chen's downfall.   In the process he has prob-
 ably weakened Liu and possibly even Mao.   He has not
 yet won all the cards.     He could still be stopped if
 his potential victims were to write and work ener-
 getically against him.                             Now,  however,  the tide seems
 to be running in his favor.
 51.   As we see it now,  the struggle among the
 leaders is primarily over power,  not issues.   Its
 public manifestations have been couched in terms of
 hard-core revolutionary purity and. an absolute fi-
 delity to the thought of Mao Tse-tung.   The attackers
 present themselves as unswerving champions of both,
 willing and able to spot the first  hint of deviation.
 Those attacked are presented in this material as
 having tried over a period of years to besmirch the
 true revolutionaries, undercut Mao's thought,  and
 restore the hated bourgeoisie.   These autiparty ele-
 ments are shielded by "knuckleheaded" party  leaders
 who cannot tell a fragrant flower from a poisonous
 weed.
 52.   Such charges and testaments of orthodoxy
 are, however,  poor guides to what the attackers
 actually represent and will  do  if they win out,
 In the Soviet Union  the attackers sometimes stole
 the very policies espoused by -those they attacked
 and vanquished.   It is too early to speculate as
 to what will cone out of the struggle  in  the way
 of specific policy.

 53.   Some special remarks can,  perhaps,  be made.
 It seems fair to say that for the duration of the
 struggle,   the attention of the top men in Peking
 will be fastened on the issue of personal survival.
 Abrupt shifts in policy--or even in the execution
 of established policy--do not seem likely either at
 home or abroad.   There is already evidence that the
 disarray at the top is breeding confusion at the
 lower levels.
 54.   All the contenders for the leadership are
 confirmed and practicing dogmatic Communists, and
 this is not likely to change no matter who comes
 out on top.   There might be changes in approach,
 however,   if only in reaction to the immobilism of
 Mao's declining years, which has gained the Chinese
 precious little at home and led to a series of set-
 backs abroad.   Future Chinese leaders would surely
 wish to better this record,  and could conceivably
 turn their attention to an effort to get the nation
 rolling again.   The task at home will be formidable,
 especially since the party apparatus is likely to
 be damaged and made less effective by fallout from
 the power struggle.
 55.   We see no reason to expect any changes
 from the present implacable hostility toward the US.
 Nor do we see Chinese leaders moving quickly to kiss
 and make up with the Soviets.   Basic changes, of
 course,    are possible over the long term but the
 shift would take time.

 as an ideological authority,  an effective
 leader,  a reliable interpreter of Mao,  and
 Mao's deputy.   This buildup has been in a
 low key, with usually only one or two refer-
 ences a month to Liu's name in this manner.
 No other leader besides Mao has been given
 this attention,  however,  and it has been
 clearly designed to groom Liu as Mao's suc-
 cessor.
 This list of references to Liu's name
 is limited to those that deal with his party
 role and his writings, and does not include
 his numerous public activities as ceremonial
 chief of state.
 The attention to Liu in his party role
 was heavier than usual last winter and spring,
 but dropped off after March.

 for "Survey of China Mainland Press" published
 by the American Consulate General in Hong
 Kong.   All references to "FBIS" are to the

 ANNEX D
 Status of Chinese Communist Leaders
 Normally in a Communist state the power structure equates roughly to the
 Central Committee.  In China, however, the current central committee was
 formed ten years ago, and many members have become inactive for one reason
 or another, while some who are not central committee members have risen to
 positions of authority.  The following list includes the men who were at the
 top of the apparent power structure in 1965, plus selected provincial leaders
 whose career have been connected to either Peng Chen or Tend Ilsiao-ping.

 As Mao's personal position of leadership can hardly be helped by the present divisive party
 struggle, it is possible that Mao had already lost partial control of the party machinery
 to Teng after a serious illness last winter.
 As the long-established heir-designate to Mao. Liu has undoubtedly lost stature as the
 result of current party in-fighting.  There is further evidence that the low-key process
 of grooming him for the succession virtually halted at about the time of P'eng's political
 demise in March.
 Occupies strategic position in placement of top personnel and transmission of party policy;
 third in power structure since mid-1950's, he appears to have benefitted the most from
 the political demise of his rival for leadership withip the radical wing of the party, P'eng
 Chen.  May now play the leading role in party.
 Once the focus of loyalty for the party's "moderates," he appears so far to have gone along
 with, perhaps even abetted, Teng's drive.  He is a useful technician and probably
 will survive.
 Lin is the only leader besides Mao to have been cited as an ideological authority during the
 past two months in the major party journals. It -is likely, however, that he is being used
 as little more than a front man for Teng.  A former Marshal.
 An unlikely ally of Teng, Li has managed so far to stay out of obvious trouble, like Chou.
 In most respects closely associated with Chou, but may have profited from the purge of
 Jao Shu-shih and, thus, from Teng's concomitant rise.  A former Marshal.
 One of Peking's three top economic administrators,  aligned with radical group  during
 Great Leap.
 As the only regional leader who seems to have built his own personal power base, T'ao
 would be a likely ultimate target for Teng.  There has been some evidence that Central-
 South propaganda outlets have not kept pace in the attacks aimed at P'eng Chen.                                                                                                                                                                                     As
 of now, however, T'ao seems to have made his temporary peace with the victors.
 Counted among the economists of the party's moderate wing.

 Active in China's foreign relations, especially with non-Communist countries.
 Spokesman for Peking's anti-Soviet propaganda since 1962.
 Like Chen Po-ta, Wu:s parts role aid the lag in his paper's taking up the attack make
 him suspect to the Teng forces, but past linking to Teng may mitigate.
 Perhaps associated with Liu Shao-ch'i, his status is in doubt, largely because of obvious
 failures of YCL.
 Transferred to SEC from 1st secretaryship in Shansi Province in 1965; has also been a
 secretary on North China Bureau, CCP.
 Chu at 79 is pretty much out of it as far as political maneuvering within the party is
 concerned.  A former Marshal.
 One of 12 founders of CCP with Mao, Tung still sits in inner party circles, but at 80 is
 no longer an important active member.
 Top non-Han leader in CCP, but apparently has little authority in his own right.
 A former Marshal, is probably not as important as his posts might indicate.
 Associated in 30s with Chang Kuo-t'ao, who was purged in 1938, Hsu has nevertheless
 remained publicly active.  A former Marshal.
 Served under P'eng Te-huai, but not implicated in 1959 purge.
 Not on Central Committee.
 Not a Central Committee member.
 Over 30 years service with Chu Te, Ho Lung, and P'eng Te-huai, does not appear greatly
 important.
 Not a Central Committee member.
 Appointed to Ministry in 1959 after P'eng Te-huai purge; however, earlier associated with
 Chang Kuo-t'ao; once opposed Mao in Yenan.
 Replaced Wu Chih-1)'u in Ilonan (1990 or 62) after Wu's radical Leap Forward and com-
 mune policies there had led to agricultural disaster and peasant/militia riots.
 Served apparently as trouble-shooter for the party in Kweichow Province in spring of 1995,
 replacing Chou Lin as 1st Secretary there until relieved himself by Chia Ch'i-yiin.
 A military con, Inander since the 1930>. Yen has served under Teng, Li Ta-cliang, Li Ching-

 WVas 1st Secretary, Kirin, at time of his assigmneut to help Li flsiieh-fen" clean out Peking

 Succeeded K'o Ch'ing-ship ns mayor in Dec 05 (K'o had died in Apr); appears frequently,
 his lost appearance being directly connected with the present "cultural revolution" (i.e.,
 power struggle).
 Had been 1st Secretary in Ronan antii accused of "right opportunism" in Mac 1958 and
 replaced by %Vu Chih-p'u; later headed All-China Federation of Supply and Marke tin,'
 Cooperatives.  His new job, replacing On-yang Ch'in, a possible P'eng Chen roan, suggests
 some connection with Tong Hsiao-ping.
