 CONFIDENTIAL
 THE EUROPEAN BORDERS OF THE USSR
 Introduction
 The boundaries of the Soviet Union are of particular interest to
 the intelligence community because of the manner in which they are
 sealed to ordinary international intercourse.  It is necessary to go
 back in history to the mid-nineteenth century and the boundary between
 Korea and China to find a comparable attempt to seal off a country
 from bordering peoples with similar cultures.
 In March 1946, Winston Churchill, speaking at Fulton, Missouri,
 observed that from "Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic,
 an iron curtain has descended across the Continent.  Behind that line
 lie all the capitals of the ancient states of central and eastern
 Europe..."  Actually, the Soviet regime was suspicious of the outside
 world from its inception, near the end of World War I, and had erected
 an "iron curtain" along its own western frontiers in the interwar pe-
 riod.  The establishment of tight border security west of the Soviet
 satellites after World War II was therefore merely an extension and
 elaboration of the already adopted Soviet policy of impermeable fron-
 tiers.  The present boundary of the USSR is in reality an iron curtain
 within the Iron Curtain.
 Three months after Churchill's Fulton address, John Foster Dulles
 propounded a theory that extended beyond Churchill's premise and en-
 compassed the Far East.  His thesis was that, for the purpose of
 achieving Soviet policy, the USSR had divided the world into three
 zones: (1) an Inner Zone, the USSR itself; (2) a Middle Zone, repre-
 senting a belt or cordon sanitaire surrounding the Inner Zone; and (3)
 an Outer Zone, representing the rest of the world.  The Soviet Inner
 Zone comprises the Soviet Union as originally established in 1917,
 together with adjacent territories subsequently incorporated.  The
 Middle Zone, which cannot be regarded as fixed, consists of countries
 that have come under Soviet influence, with an increasing measure of
 control from Moscow.  The central European part of the Middle Zone
 includes East Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia, eastern Austria,'Hungary,
 Rumania, Bulgaria, Albania, and (until 19+8) Yugoslavia.  In Asia the
 zone includes Outer Mongolia, Manchuria, North Korea, the Sinkiang
 Province of China, and probably the rest of Communist China; it is
 difficult, however, to predict the role that the Communist regime of
 Mao Tse-tung will ultimately play within the Soviet sphere.  The third
 or Outer Zone comprises the balance of the world.

 The efforts of the Soviet Government to establish a security zone
 along the entire border of the USSR extend to nations along the south-
 ern frontier.  In both Turkey and Iran, however, fierce resistance to
 Soviet pressures has been encountered, and the usual pattern of Soviet
 penetration and domination has been successfully thwarted.  As a re-
 sult, areas of the Near and Middle East have not disappeared behind
 the Iron Curtain but have remained one of the major arenas of the
 struggle between East and West.
 The Soviet technique of creating and maintaining an "iron curtain"
 serves two purposes, one domestic and the other foreign.  From the
 domestic standpoint, nonintercourse is intended to insure that "pure"
 political thinking in the USSR will not become tainted, and at the
 same time it helps to prevent the internal discontent that might arise
 if the people of the Soviet Union were able to compare their standard
 of living with that prevailing in other countries.  The Soviet people
 are told that a broad security belt, or buffer zone, is a necessary
 defense measure against an unfriendly world.  From the external stand-
 pointy Soviet propaganda is the more effective because actual condi-
 tions within the USSR are a matter of conjecture.
 The great length of the Soviet frontier, the irregularities of
 terrain, and the heterogeneous population are a few of the complex
 factors with which the Soviet Government is faced in the effort to
 guard its borders.  The northern and central European frontier areas
 are largely plains across which passage between the east and the West
 is comparatively easy.  This accounts in part for the strict security
 measures employed by the Soviets and the fact that the European area
 is heavily guarded.  The longest zone of Soviet influence lies in
 central and eastern Asia, reaching from the Pamir Mountains to Vladivos-
 tok, a distance of about 4,000 miles.  That portion of the boundary
 with its vast stretches of mountains and deserts is not as stringently
 controlled as the Western European borders.  This indicates that the
 Soviet manpower is not distributed indiscriminately but according to
 the type of terrain, the border peoples, the political significance of
 the border area, and the existence of known trouble spots.  It is also
 quite probable that the employment of variations in the methods of
 guarding the frontier is a deliberate practice on the part of Soviet
 authorities intended to deter penetration or escape.
 The present report deals specifically with the European bound-
 aries of the USSR, those with Norway, Finland, Poland, Czechoslovakia,
 Hungary and Rumania.  Only two of these countries are part of the
 free world, the others being Soviet satellites.
 The attitude of the free governments in regard to the border dif-
 fers greatly from that of the Communist countries.  Although in a

 precarious geopolitical position, Finland, a non-satellite neighbor
 of the USSR, would consider it a restriction of individual liberty
 to prevent Finnish civilians from living in close proximity to the
 border.  The Soviet Union, on the contrary, is meticulous in securing
 the inviolability of its own side of the boundary, and the Iron Cur-
 tain countries conform to the same pattern, employing rigid restri--
 tive measures within their border areas.  In order to further safe-
 guard the impenetrability of the frontier, Soviet border guards are
 carefully picked and highly disciplined. Recruits are also trained
 in the art of observation and collection of intelligence in the fron-
 tier area.  It is obvious that Soviet authorities do not consider the
 existence of Communist regimes as a sufficient security guarantee.
 Portions of the Soviet European boundaries were nominally drawn
 on ethnic principles.  A considerable degree of ethnic homogeneity has
 been achieved in the satellites by postwar boundary changes and shifts
 in population.  The Soviet Union and the satellite regimes have not
 used the principle of ethnic homogeneity within international bound-
 aries as a means of reducing international or internal friction, but
 simply as a convenient tool to be applied or ignored, depending on
 which course best suited the purposes of the governments.  Thus,
 partial ethnic uniformity was forced upon the new Poland by moving
 Poles westward from former eastern Poland when that region was taken
 over by Belorussia and the Ukraine, and by the expulsion of many
 Germans from the areas east of the Oder-Neisse Line.  Germans were
 also expelled from their former homes in northern East Prussia when
 the area was taken by the RSFSR, but there does not seem to have been
 a corresponding attempt to secure a solidly Russian population there,
 for it is reported that peoples from Soviet Central Asia have been
 moved into the areas on the Soviet side of the new boundary.
 There is a sharp contrast between Soviet policy regarding peoples
 and Soviet policy regarding commerce along the boundaries.  The western
 boundaries are sealed to the movement of people, but economic policy
 requires a maximum movement of goods among the satellites and the USSR.
 Measures employed by the Soviet Bloc countries to seal their
 frontiers consist of a combination of physical barriers, border guards
 and patrols, border-zone restrictions, and constant surveillance of
 internal movements of the population.  The existence of this wide-
 spread system of border controls is in itself a psychological deterrent
 to escape.  Soviet citizens attempting to defect along the central
 European borders are faced with the additional problem of crossing
 satellite territory in order to find refuge in the West.  Continued
 Soviet sensitivity and extreme security consciousness indicate that
 restrictive measures, rather than being relaxed, will be more rigidly
 enforced in the future.

 In this study each boundary segment is discussed under four main
 headings: history; linear descriptions; boundary markings administra-
 tion, and security; and available maps.
 The section on history gives in each case the background of the
 present boundary without attempting to present a full discussion of
 disputes and territorial transfers.  The documents forming the legal
 basis of the present boundary are cited.  Under linear description,
 each boundary sector, together with its immediate vicinity, is de-
 scribed topographically in as much detail as the available sources
 permit.  Because of the scarcity of source materials, the descriptions
 of the boundaries of the Soviet Bloc countries are not as complete as
 those of the frontiers with Norway and Finland.  The surveys and de-
 marcation of each boundary, types of boundary markers used, provisions
 for regulating intercourse across the line, barbed-wire entanglements,
 watchtowers and other security structures, and personnel engaged in
 boundary administration and security are discussed.  Examples of
 security structures and measures typical of the boundary area in
 general are presented.  It is not possible, however, to give a com-
 plete and detailed picture of boundary security measures and personnel,
 not only because these factors are subject to almost constant change,
 but also because complete information on them is seldom available.
 The maps that accompany the report are mostly at small scales and
 rather generalized, but citations of more detailed maps are given.

 I.  Norway-USSR Border
 A. History of the Boundary
 The boundary between Norway and the USSR has retained its pre-
 sent alignment with only minor changes since 1826 (see accompanying
 map 11738). 1/*  In that year, in an effort to prevent difficulties
 in the Foelleds Districter (districts held in common by Sweden,
 Norway, and Russia), the King of Sweden and Norway and the Emperor
 of All the Russias agreed to a demarcation of the line of sovereignty
 in the boundary area.  The agreement was included in the "Convention
 of Limits Between Russia and Sweden," 2-14 May 1826, signed at St.
 Petersburg. J  This division of the area by Norway and Russia
 precluded Finnish access to the Arctic Ocean.  The problem thus intro-
 duced was to exert great influence and to cause several changes in
 Norway's neighbors along the boundary.
 The line established in 1826 was the boundary between Norway and
 Russia until 1920 and between Norway and Finland from 1920 to 1944.
 This boundary was described generally as following the Pasvikelv
 Pats-Yoki7** and Jakobselv LVor'yema7 Rivers, with several long,
 straight, connecting land sectors.  The actual 1826 marking of the
 line consisted of only 10 markers or stone cairns, most of them set
 at the main breakpoints.  Krokfjell (Muotkavaara) Mountain was
 established in 1833 as the meeting point of the territories of the
 USSR, Norway, and Finland by representatives of Russia proper and
 the Grand Duchy of Finland, but the marker was not erected there-
 until after the 1846 Norwegian-Russian survey of the boundary.
 After Finland became a neighbor of Norway in 1920, the two
 countries opened talks concerning the boundary in the Finnmark-Petsamo
 fP-echengaa7 area.  An agreement was reached on 28 April 1924 that
 superseded the 1826 agreement concerning the boundary between Finnmark

 Province (fylke) of Norway and Petsamo District (herred) of Fin-
 land. 3/  Although it made no basic changes in the boundary de-
 scription, the 1924 agreement contained a clause calling for the
 establishment of the line in the territorial sea north of the mouth
 of the Jakobselv.  During the negotiations, however, the Norwegians
 proposed two modifications of the 1826 line, both to no avail.  First,
 they wished to apply the thalweg principle to the Pasvikelv River
 near Ostrov Chevessuolo (island) and Ostrov Niva-saari; second,
 they proposed that the line leave the Pasvikelv in an easterly di-
 rection in the vicinity of Ozero Kuets-yarvi (lake) and continue to
 the Jakobselv, instead of following the river to a point north of
 Kolttakengyas (formerly the Boris Gleb area)* and then taking a
 southeasterly course to the Jakobselv.   The second proposal had
 been rejected in the negotiations preceding the 1826 agreement,
 which not only established the boundary farther north but also pro-
 vided for the cession by Norway to Russia of a small area around
 the Russian Church of Boris Gleb on the west bank of the Pasvikelv.
 In the 1922-24 Finnish-Norwegian negotiations, the Finns rejected the
 proposal for a change on the ground that Norway could offer no terri-
 torial compensation.
 In 1925, Norway and Finland conducted a survey of the bound-
 ary.       So that there would be no doubt as to the course of the
 line in the Boris Gleb area, a boundary road was built and additional
 markers were erected.   The Pasvikelv sector of the boundary was to
 follow the line in the river that had been established previously
 by the Norwegians and Russians.  Special signs were placed on river
 islands to designate the country to which they belonged.
 A supplementary protocol to clarify the position of the boundary
 in the mouth of the Jakobselv was signed on 12 September 1931 (see
 accompanying map 12104).  This protocol established 11 points through
 which the line was to be drawn and also provided that vessels of both
 countries could freely lie and anchor on either side of the boundary.
 The line provided for in the protocol of 1931 was finally marked in
 1939, using a series of 20 sight markers placed on the land in such
 a manner that the sight lines intersected at the 11 points along the
 boundary line.
 *The name "Kolttakengyas" is the present Russian version of
 "Kolttakongas," the name given to the town by the Lapps who settled
 the area.  In the 16th century a Russian Orthodox church was built
 at the site of the present town of Kolttakengyas and dedicated to
 two 8th-century Russian princes, Boris and Gleb.

 In August 1946, representatives of Norway and the Soviet Union
 met and. established the Joint Soviet-Norwegian Commission for the
 Marking of the International Boundary Between the USSR and Norway.
 Its basic task was to establish the international boundary in accord-
 ance with the old Norwegian-Russian line.  The discussions of the
 Joint Commission had the following results:  (1) the line in the
 mouth of the Jakobselv was to follow the thalweg as determined at
 low tide, in accordance with the recommendation of the Norwegians;
 the USSR was to give up demands for a change at Grensefoss
 Waensefoss) Falls where Norway controls both banks of the Pasvikelv
 (marker No. 11); and (3) Norway would transfer the three small islands
 in the Pasvikelv to the USSR.
 Only preliminary discussions were held on the problem of the
 territorial sea north of the mouth of the Jakobselv.  Since the
 viewpoints and claims of the two countries to territorial waters
 differed radically, the Norwegians claiming 4 nautical miles and
 the Soviets 12)-the Joint Commission decided to keep this question
 open for future diplomatic negotiations.
 At the conclusion of the marking of the Soviet-Finnish boundary
 in 1945, it was agreed to place a three-nation boundary marker at
 Krokfjell.  A Norwegian representative was present to approve the
 position of the marker, and a tri-state protocol was signed on 26
 October 1945.  After the Yaniskoski-Niskakoski area was ceded to
 the Soviet Union by Finland in 1947, a new demarcation of the
 northernmost sector of the Finnish-Soviet boundary, just south of
 Krokfjell, was undertaken.  In the summer of 1947 a Norwegian repre-
 sentative inspected the marker, and on 3 December 1947 a new tri-
 state protocol regarding the marker on Krokfjell, replacing the
 1945 protocol, was signed.
 During the summer of 1947, two mixed Norwegian-Soviet sub-
 commissions (under the Joint Commission) marked the boundary.  One
 subcommission was supervised by the USSR, the other by Norway. The
 Soviet-supervised subcommission marked the first section of the
 boundary, from the junction at Krokfjell northward 61.1 miles to
 69?32'N, north of Holmfossen.  The Norwegian-supervised subcommission
 marked the second section, from 69?32'N northward 60.5 miles to
 marker No. 415, a buoy stake north of the mouth of the Jakobselv.
 Each subcommission  as responsible for placing, painting, and number-
 ing the markers along its section of the boundary.  A topographic
 survey of a strip at least 0.5 kilometer (about 0.3 mile) wide
 along each side of the boundary was made at the scale of 1:25,000,
 and a polygon system was laid on which the rectangular coordinates
 of the boundary markers were computed.

 On 18 December 1947, with the final drafting and reviewing of
 the boundary documents, the boundary agreement, together with the
 maps and protocols,* was signed in Moscow. ~7/  The Norwegian
 Storting ratified the agreement unanimously on 3 December 1948, and
 the instruments of ratification were exchanged on 23 May 1949 in
 Moscow. 8/  Before ratifying the agreement, the Norwegian Storting
 questioned the cession to the USSR of the three small islands in the
 Pasvikelv.  The issue was dismissed, however, because the islands
 were regarded as being of no strategic or economic value, and it was
 agreed that under the terms of the 1826 convention the islands fell
 on the Soviet side of the line.  The course of the boundary as marked
 in the mouth of the Jakobselv proved satisfactory to the Norwegians,
 since it permitted their fishing vessels to enter and leave the river
 without crossing the line.     10   The demarcation maps show the
 boundary along the channel of the river at low tide, which was the
 line held by the Norwegians during the dispute with the Finns over
 the issue following the 1925 investigation of the boundary.
 B.  Linear Description of the Boundary**
 Only about one-fifth of the 121.6-mile-long Norwegian-USSR
 boundary is on land.  The course of the remainder of the line is
 determined mainly by the deepest channels of the Pasvikelv (Figure 1)
 and Jakobselv and their associated lakes.  (Figures 2 and 3.)
 The westernmost point of the border is at Krokfjell Mountain,
 where the boundaries of Norway, Finland, and the USSR meet (see map
 11738).  From Krokfjell the boundary follows a southeasterly direction
 in a series of short, straight-line sectors through somewhat hilly,
 partly marshy terrain to the Pasvikelv, which it crosses to marker
 No. 11 near Grensefoss, a main breakpoint in the boundary.  At that
 marker the entire river lies within Norway.  From marker No. 11,
 the line takes a northeasterly direction, at first for 70 meters
 (229.66 feet), then down the steep slope of the Gelsomio Promontory
 and over to the Pasvikelv.  It continues along the mountain lake
 Grensevatn (Grensevann) to marker No. 12, leaving Aittasaari (island)
 on the Soviet side.  The Norwegian post stands on the east side of

 Grenseneset Point on a hillock 165.1 meters (5+1.65 feet) from the
 boundary.  The Soviet post is on the northwestern point of Aitta-
 saari, 6 meters (19.68 feet) from a steep slope and 115 meters
 (377.29 feet) from the boundary.*
 From marker No. 12 the boundary follows Grensevatn in a north-
 easterly direction to marker No. 14; leaving an islet having a
 boundary post on the Soviet side and Balgisholmen (island) on the
 Norwegian side.  The boundary then extends in a north-northeasterly
 direction along the lake, with Bj~rkholmen on the northern side.
 From this point the boundary continues in the same direction from
 Grensevatn (marker No. 16) out into the Pasvikely (marker-No.
 17), and then follows the channel of the Pasvikelv for approximately
 3.7 kilometers (about 2.3 miles) to marker No. 21+, situated on a
 small wooded island on the Norwegian side.  The boundary continues
 in a general north-northeasterly direction to marker No. 28, located
 on the northernmost islet of a group of three on the Soviet side;
 the Norwegian post stands on the east slope of a hillock, north of
 the mouth of Gjeddebekken Creek.  From marker No. 28 the boundary
 extends along the channel chiefly in a northeasterly direction,
 passing wooded isles and rocks on the Norwegian side, to marker No.
 30.  At this point the boundary resumes a north-northeasterly
 course through Tangefoss, then turns toward the northeast past five
 small islands -- two on the Norwegian and three on the Soviet side --
 to marker No. 31.
 The boundary passes from marker No. 31 along the channel of
 the Pasvikely, first in a northeasterly direction past three isles
 on the Soviet side, and then in a north-northeasterly direction to
 marker No. 32, situated on a wooded island on the Soviet side.
 Maintaining the same course, the boundary goes past a group of
 reefs or sandbanks on the Norwegian side to marker No. 33, at which
 point it extends in a curved line toward the north-northwest, past
 a Soviet reef, and then toward the north-northeast, past a Norwegian
 reef, to marker No. 34.  From there the boundary follows the channel
 to the northeast past two islands (Norwegian) to marker No. 35, then
 makes an arc, turning north to marker No. 36.  The Norwegian post
 stands on the left riverbank, directly opposite the mouth of the
 Kornetijoki, 63.4 meters.(208 feet) from the border; the Soviet
 post is on the right riverbank, on the south side of the mouth of
 the Kornetijoki, 100 meters (328 feet) from the border.  The boundary

 then passes along the channel in a north-northwesterly direction to
 marker No. 37 before curving toward the north-northeast to marker No.
 38.  On the Norwegian side the post is situated 300 meters (984.25
 feet) southwest of a railroad track.
 The boundary continues in a general north-northeasterly direction
 to marker No. 40, bending along the river to Hestefoss, then along
 the falls to marker No. 41.  From marker No. 41 the boundary turns
 with the channel for about 3.3 kilometers (approximately 2 miles),
 passing numerous isles (Skiltholmen on the USSR side and Bj~rnholmen
 and Sauholmen on the Norwegian side), to marker No. 46 on the right
 riverbank (Soviet side) 60 meters (196.85 feet) southwest of a
 dwelling house on the Hoyhenjarvi rKheykhen"yarvi7 (Khoyhenyarvi)--
 Majatalo 5Mayatalo7 road.  The AMS series Finland-Scandinavia

 (Pechenga; NR 35,36-8: 58-761)* connecting. Norwegian Highway 955 with
 the Arctic Highway on the Soviet side.  From marker No. 46 the bound-
 ary goes in a general northeasterly direction to marker No. 48, pass-
 ing a number of isles and islands, and then turns toward the north-
 west between Tjernholmen and Rittasaari to marker No. 49.  North of
 Kisteholmen, at marker No. 50, the boundary takes an east-
 northeasterly course along Lake Fjaervatn (Hoyhenjarvi), passing an
 island (Jakolan-Lammasaari) on the Soviet side and a sandbank on the
 Norwegian side, to marker No. 51.  The boundary continues along
 Fjaervatn for approximately 4.6 kilometers (about 2.9 miles) to mark-
 er No. 58, at which point it turns along the lake toward the north,
 past a Norwegian reef, and then follows the channel in the Pasvikelv
 toward the northeast to Jordanfoss (marker No. 59).
 The boundary bends with the channel in the Pasvikelv past sever-
 al reefs and isles before turning into Lake Vaggatem (Vaggetemjavrre)
 to marker No. 62.  The Norwegian post stands on the western shore of
 the lake, 175 meters (574.14 feet) northwest of a narrow-gauge rail-
 road track.  The Soviet post stands on a  romontory on the eastern
 shore of the lake, 85 meters (278.87 feet p) north-northwest of the
 mouth of an unnamed creek.  From marker No. 62 the boundary goes in a
 generally northerly direction, passing numerous isles, to marker No.

 meters (377.29 feet) southeast of Nesheim and 261.8 meters (858.92
 feet) from the border.  From here the boundary bends along the lake
 in an arc for about 2.6 kilometers (approximately 1.6 miles) to
 marker No. 68, leaving Gravholmen on the Norwegian side and Skolte-
 holmen  Jstrov Chevessuolo7 on the Soviet side.  From this point to
 marker No. 78 the boundary extends in a general northerly direction
 past a number of isles -- Vaerholmen, Lavholmen, and Bj~rnholmen --
 on the Norwegian side and Krokholmen and Brannholmen on the Soviet
 side. In this sector the Skogly Farmstead is located on the Norwegian
 side southwest of marker No. 71.  From marker No. 78 the boundary
 passes along Lake Vaggatem in an east-northeasterly direction to
 marker No. 80, at which point it continues along the Pasvikelv, then
 through the Vaggatemstryket (rapids) and an old riverbed (the Stein
 Rapids) to marker No. 85.  In this stretch of the border, an isle,
 Brennholmen, is situated on the Soviet side.
 The boundary passes from marker No. 85 along the old riverbed
 toward the northeast, first over a dry section, then over a deep
 pool, and past a Norwegian isle to marker No. 86; the Soviet post
 stands on the northwest side of Nivasaari, 23 meters (75.45 feet)
 from the border.  From here the boundary follows an east-northeasterly
 course to marker No. 88, turns in a southeasterly direction along the
 channel of the Pasvikelv, and then passes through the Vakkerstryket
 Rapids to marker No. 90.  From this point the boundary curves in an
 east-northeasterly direction out over Kattolampolo (lake) to marker
 No. 93, leaving the isle of Grasholmen on the Norwegian side.  Con-
 tinuing in the same direction for approximately 2.1 kilometers (about
 1.3.miles) the boundary extends to marker No. 97, with Sauholmen
 situated on the Norwegian side, then turns along the channel of the
 Pasvikelv in a northeast-southeast arc to marker No. 98.  The
 Norwegian post stands on the left side of the river, on the south-
 western part of a promontory 225 meters (738.18 feet) south-
 southeast of the end of a narrow-gauge railroad track, and 54.6
 meters (179.13 feet) from the border.  From marker No. 98 the
 boundary passes toward the east and northeast through Kobbfoss to
 marker No. 99, then arches toward the south-southeast along Lake
 Langvatn (Bossojavrre) to marker No. 100.  From here the boundary
 continues south-southeastward to marker No. 102, where it makes a
 bend in an east-southeasterly direction to marker No. 103.  The
 boundary curves slightly along the lake in an east-northeasterly
 direction from marker No. 103 to No. 104, leaving Aittasaari on the
 Soviet side and Hareholmen on the Norwegian side.  Maintaining a
 northeasterly direction for approximately 7.1 kilometers (about 4.4
 miles), the boundary extends to marker No. 118.  In this sector
 Kaurinkisaari is on the Soviet side and Langnes (peninsula) and
 Frigard and Lyng Farmsteads are on the Norwegian side.

 From marker No. 118 the boundary passes along the lake in an
 arc toward the north-northeast, with Niskasaari on the Soviet side,
 to boundary marker No. 119.  The Norwegian post stands on the left
 shore of the Pasvikelv on the point of a small promontory 65.1 meters
 (213.58 feet) from the border.  Continuing in a north-northeasterly
 direction, the boundary extends from Langvatn out over the Pasvikelv,
 following the channel through the Skogfoss (Hakokoski) (Figure 4)
 to marker No. 122, leaving an isle and reefs on the Norwegian side
 and five isles and reefs on the Soviet side.  The Norwegian post
 stands on the left shore of the rapids, 80 meters (262.46 feet)
 south of the northern end of a narrow-gauge railroad track, and 71.6
 meters (234.9 feet) from the border.  The boundary passes from marker
 No. 122 along Skogvatn in a line curving first northeast then north-
 northwest, with sandbanks on the Norwegian side, to marker No. 123.

 shore of the lake, on the southwestern side of Harrnes Point, 65
 meters (213.25 feet) from the border.  From marker No. 123 the bound-
 ary extends along the lake close to the western end of Harrnes, then
 toward the north-northwest past Grasholmen and a smaller islet south
 of it on the Soviet side, to marker No. 124.  Here it passes through
 a narrow strait with a strong current at the Lillestrmmmen, describing
 an arc toward the northeast, to marker No. 125.  In a winding but
 generally east-northeasterly course along the lake, with two small
 isles and Gravholmen on the Soviet side, the boundary extends to
 marker No. 129, leaving Fuglebukta (bay) and Grasholmen on the
 Norwegian side.  The Norwegian post stands on the northwestern shore
 of the lake, 80 meters (262.46 feet) west-northwest of the south end
 of a narrow-gauge railroad track and 60.2 meters (197.5 feet) from
 the border.  The Soviet post stands on the southeastern shore of the
 lake, at the northwestern end of Koskennis-Kanniemi Cape, 16 meters
 (52.49 feet) from the shore and 125 meters (410 feet) from the border.
 From marker No. 129 the boundary passes first along the channel
 toward the southeast and then along Melkefoss (Maitokoski) in a
 general northeasterly direction for about 4.7 kilometers (approxi-
 mately 2.9 miles) to marker No. 136.  In this sector, Norwegian post
 No. 133 stands 50 meters (164 feet) northeast of a dwelling house
 at Mikkelstad.  Huhmunsaari Island (marker No. 134) is on the Soviet
 side of the border.

 follows a north-northeasterly direction for approximately 5.3
 kilometers (about 3.3 miles) to marker No. 152.  In this sector
 Ostre Skr$ytnes, Tangen, Myreng, and Framnes Farms are on the
 Norwe ian side.  Marker No. 150 is located on the northwestern shore
 of Bj rnsund, 61 meters (200.13 feet) northeast of the southernmost
 dwelling house on Utnes.  Norwegian post No. 151 stands on the
 northwestern shore of the sound, on Langnes (point) 318.4 meters
 (1,044 feet) from the border.  In this same area, Soviet post No.
 147 stands on the southeastern shore of Lake Svanvatn, 215 meters
 (705.38 feet) west of the fork on the Petsjenga Jechenga7--
 Rovaniemi road (Arctic Highway).
 From marker No. 152 the boundary follows the sound in a north-
 northeasterly direction for a few kilometers to marker No. 156,
 leaving an islet south of Furumo on the Norwegian side.  From marker
 No. 156 the boundary turns in an arc toward the northeast and north-
 northwest along the Bj6rnsund to marker No. 158.  From here the
 boundary extends along the channel of the Trongsund in a general
 northerly direction to marker No. 164 -- a distance of approximately
 2.5 kilometers (about 1.6 miles).  Norwegian post No. 164 stands on
 the western shore of the sound, on the east side of a promontory,
 65 meters (213.25 feet) northeast of the Trongsundneset Farm.
 The boundary runs from marker No. 164 along the channel of the
 Trongsund, then across Bj5rnvatn (Kontiojarvi) in a general northerly
 direction to marker No. 167.  The Norwegian post stands on a
 promontory on the western shore of the lake, 32 meters (101+.98
 feet) northeast of the road between Kirkenes and Svanvik.  From
 marker No. 167 the boundary passes along the lake in a curved line
 in a north-northeasterly direction and then to marker.No. 169, a
 cairn set up on the southern point of Store Grenseholmen in 1896 and
 restored in 1947.  The boundary then proceeds along a border road
 toward the north-northeast via Store Grenseholmen to marker No. 172,
 where it continues in a northeasterly direction along the channel of
 the Pasvikelv between Litleholmen on the Norwegian side and an un-
 named isle on the Soviet side, to marker No. 173.  The Norwegian post
 stands on the left river bank on the Kirkenes-Holmfoss road, near a
 destroyed bridge, 108.4 meters (355.64 feet) from the border.  The
 Soviet post stands on a promontory, on the right riverbank 15 meters
 (49.21 feet) west of the Holmfoss-Ahmalahti road and 150 meters
 (492.12 feet) from the border.

 From marker No. 173 the boundary bends along the middle of the
 river in an east-southeasterly direction, then turns in a north-
 easterly direction past two small islands (one on each side of the
 border) to marker No. 174.      The Norwegian post stands on the south
 point of Floytarneset Cape, 135.5 meters (444.55 feet) from the
 border.  Nordmo Farm is located to the northwest of marker No. 174.
 Continuing in a north-northeasterly direction, the boundary extends
 along Klistervatn to marker No. 176, leaving Skolteholmen on the
 Norwegian side.  From here the boundary winds along the lake, first
 toward the northeast then toward the north and northwest, to marker
 No. 178.  The Norwegian post is situated on the top of wooded
 Ellenholmen Island, 390 meters (1,279.5 feet) from the border.
 From marker No. 178 the boundary winds along the lake in a north-
 northeasterly direction to marker No. 181, then turns in a north-
 northwesterly direction to marker No. 182.  In this sector,
 Norwegian post No. 179 stands on the western shore of the lake, on
 the southern part of Fjellfrossneset Point, 320 meters (1,049.86
 feet) from the border, and the Soviet post stands on a steep
 mountain sloe on the eastern shore of the lake, 160 meters
 (524.93 feet) west of the Storskog-Ahmalahti road.  From marker
 No. 182, the boundary passes along the lake, first in a north-
 northwesterly direction and then bending toward the north-northeast,
 to marker No. 183, where it curves again in a general northwesterly
 direction, which it maintains for about, 2.8 kilometers (approxi-
 mately 1.7 miles) to the northern end of the lake (marker No. 187).
 In this area Iso Palossari Jstrov Iso Palosarj7 is on the Soviet
 side.
 From marker No. 187 the boundary continues along the Pasvikelv
 in a north-northwesterly direction toward Harefossen, then along
 the middle of the falls to marker No. 189.  The Soviet post stands on
 the right bank of the falls, on a mountain ridge to the north, 50
 meters (164 feet) west of a narrow-gauge railroad.  From marker No.
 189 the boundary follows the middle of the river rapids (below
 Harefossen) along a northwesterly course to marker No. 190, then
 turns in a northeasterly direction to marker No. 191.  The Soviet
 post stands on a wooded gravel hill on the right riverbank, 30
 meters (98.42 feet) west of the Skoltefossen-Ahmalahti road.
 From this point the boundary trends generally northward, first along
 the middle of the rapids in the Pasvikelv, then along Fossevatn, past
 two islands on the Soviet side and one on the Norwegian side, to
 Boddiholmen (marker No. 192).  The boundary then extends along the
 middle of the lake in a general north-northwesterly direction to
 marker No. 196 at Skoltefossen, where it leaves the Pasvikelv
 (a breakpoint).

 In the Pasvikelv, the boundary follows the deep channel and,
 for the most part, it also follows the middle of the lakes.  Except
 for Skolteholmen ZO-strov Chevessuolo7 and Nivasaari fostrov Niva-
 saari7, the islands in the river and lakes are allocated to the
 country on whose side of the channel they lie.  Only a few islands
 or sandbanks are crossed by the boundary, the only one of_signifi-
 cant size being Store Grenseholmen [Ostrov Sture Grense-kholmen7,
 on which markers Nos. 169-171 are located.
 After leaving the Pasvikelv, the boundary proceeds in a straight
 line to the west for about 1.8 kilometers (about 1.1 miles) to marker
 No. 208 (a breakpoint).  In this sector the boundary traverses a
 barren mountain, crosses a path, a marsh, a winter road, and Lake
 Georgsvatn (Jokonjairvi).  From marker No. 208 the boundary turns in
 a north-northwesterly direction, first down the barren slope of
 Georgvasstoppen, and then over rolling terrain west of Eskiojarvi
 to marker No. 209.  The boundary continues in the same direction over
 a barren, rounded mountain to marker No. 211, situated on top of
 Grensefjell (a breakpoint), where it turns in an east-northeasterly
 direction to marker No. 212, located on a barren mountain on the
 northwestern slope of Karhunpaa.  From here the boundary follows
 an east-northeasterly course to marker No. 216, which stands at
 the west side of the Kirkenes-Kolttakengyas (Boris Gleb) road,
 then crosses the Pasvikelv to marker No. 219 on the right bank of
 the river.  This sector of the boundary encircles the town of
 Kolttakengyas and leaves an area of more than 1.5 square miles on
 the west bank of the Pasvikelv under Soviet control.  The Soviet
 Union also has complete control of the river for approximately 2
 miles.
 From marker No. 219 the boundary continues in a straight line
 in an east-northeasterly direction across increasingly rough ter-
 rain to marker No. 222 on Russefjell Mountain (a breakpoint), where
 it turns to the southeast.  The boundary extends in that direction
 for about 1 kilometer (0.62 mile) to marker No. 226, located on the
 western shore of the northwestern inlet of Lake Pikevatn (Neitijarvi).
 From there it crosses the lake to marker No. 230, situated on the
 west side of the Storskog-Ahmalahti road, then continues in a
 southeasterly direction up a barren mountain slope to marker No. 233,
 a cairn erected at an earlier date and restored in 1947, on the top
 of Vardehaug (hill).  From marker No. 233 the boundary turns slightly
 to the south-southeast and continues down the mountain slope in dense
 forest and marshland to marker No. 236, which stands on the western
 shore of Langvatn.  The boundary maintains the same course for
 approximately 3.6 kilometers (about 2.2 miles) to marker No. 248.
 In this sector, marker No. 240 is located on the top of Storsl9ttfjell
 and No. 245 is on the northwestern slope of Vardefjell.  The boundary

 continues to follow a southeasterly course across rising terrain to
 marker No. 249, located on a small mountain knoll 140 meters (459.31
 feet) southeast of the southernmost end of Fiskevatn, then down
 a steep mountain slope and across a brook between Hamborgvatn and
 Joosepinjarvet to marker No. 251.  Maintaining a southeasterly
 direction, the boundary extends along a border lane, across a de-
 pression with a little brook, then up a very steep slope Hoghaugen
 (markers Nos. 252 and 253), from which point it continues over
 slightly rising terrain, a barren mountain, and a marsh with sparse
 plant growth to marker No. 254.
 The boundary continues from marker No. 254 in the same direction
 over rising terrain for approximately 2.6 kilometers (about 1.6
 miles) to marker No. 264.  In this area the border crosses Serdivatn
 (Siertijarvi) and the slopes of Siertitunturi and Aborvassfjell.
 From here the boundary passes in a southeasterly direction to
 Grensevatn (Rajajarvi), marker No. 268, crosses the lake, and
 continues to marker No. 274, which stands on the northeastern slope
 of Pieni Vohtastunturi.   The boundary continues a southeasterly
 course to marker No. 278, then turns in a slightly more southerly
 direction to marker No. 279 just southwest of Hundvatn.  Boundary
 marker No. 278 (a cairn erected in 1925 and restored in 1947) is
 located on the southwestern slope of Hundvasshaugan.  In this entire
 sector -- from marker No. 219 to No. 279 -- the border crosses fairly
 rugged land, barren mountains, moors, marshes, and numerous small
 lakes and ponds.  From marker No. 279 (a breakpoint), the boundary
 extends in an easterly direction to marker No. 285, situated 245
 meters (803.8 feet) northeast of the eastern end of Kuasjarvi.
 From marker No. 285 the boundary turns slightly, taking an east-
 southeasterly direction to marker No. 290, located on a wooded
 moraine ridge east of a small depression, 20 meters (65.61 feet) north
 from Tardenmyran.  From here the boundary continues in the same di-
 rection along rocky, open terrain to marker No. 293, situated 400
 meters (1,312 feet) north of the summit of lasertunturi, at which
 point it turns in a slightly more southerly direction, but continues
 generally east-southeast for about 3.3 kilometers (approximately 2
 miles) to marker No. 302, where it joins the Jakobselv.  As in the
 Pasvikelv, the boundary follows the deep channel and, in general,
 the middle of the lakes through which it passes.  Islands are allo-
 cated to the country on whose side of the channel they lie.
 The boundary continues from marker No. 302 in a general east-
 southeasterly direction to the point of directional change in the
 Jakobselv where it meets the river's channel.  From this point the
 boundary runs along the channel, first turning north and then veering
 sharply toward the east to marker No. 304.  It then follows the river
 in a general east-southeasterly direction, past an isle on the

 Norwegian side, to boundary marker No. 308.  From here the boundary
 swings along the channel in an arc to marker No. 309.  At a rock
 isle on the Soviet side the boundary extends in a southeasterly
 direction to marker No. 310.      The boundary winds along with the
 channel, in general in a southeasterly direction, to a point where
 the river widens, flowing around a small wooded isle, to marker No.
 313 (on the Soviet side).  At that marker the boundary turns to the
 northeast, past two isles on the Norwegian side and one on the Soviet
 side, to marker No. 314, then extends in the same general direction
 for about 2.3 kilometers (approximately 1.4 miles) to marker No. 322.
 Norwegian post No. 322 stands on the steep left riverbank, 50 meters
 (164 feet) northeast of the mouth of a brook and 20.5 meters (67.25
 feet) from the border.  The Soviet post stands near the right bank,
 on marshland skirted by a river bend (where a brook flows out of
 the marsh), 15.8 meters (51.83 -feet) from the border.  The boundary
 continues from marker No. 322 along the channel in an east-south-
 easterly direction to marker No. 323, then turns in a north-north-
 easterly direction, past an isle on the Soviet side, toward Jakob-
 selvvatn (Vuoremijarvi) to marker No. 325.
 From marker No. 325 the boundary goes along the lake in a
 general northeasterly direction to its outlet (marker No. 330).
 The boundary then continues along the channel of the Jakobselv in a
 northeasterly direction along the rocky riverbed, with an isle on the
 Soviet side, and then on toward the north between seven islets (four
 on the Norwegian side and three on the USSR side) to marker No. 331.
 Maintaining the same general northeasterly direction, the boundary
 extends for about half a kilometer to marker No. 334, situated on
 the Pechenga-T&rnet road.  The Norwegian post stands on the left
 riverbank on the west side of the road from T$rnet, near a partially
 destroyed bridge.  The Soviet post stands on the right bank, also
 west of the road to Pechenga and near the same bridge.  From marker
 No. 334 the boundary follows a north-northeasterly then northeasterly
 course to marker No. 336, at which point it turns northward to
 Langvatn (marker No. 337).  The boundary follows the lake in a
 northerly direction to marker No. 338.  The Soviet post stands on the
 eastern shore of the lake, on the wooded slope of a hill, 70 meters
 (229.66 feet) south of the outlet of the Sulajoki and 84.5 meters
 (277.23 feet) from the border.  The boundary continues northward
 along the-lake to marker No. 339, from which it swings to the north-
 east and then north again to marker No. 340.  The Norwegian post
 stands on the western shore of the lake, 260 meters (853 feet)
 northeast of the mouth of the Korpelva, and 49.5 meters (162.4 feet)
 from the border.  From here the boundary proceeds northward along
 the lake to its outlet into the Jakobselv and then northwest along
 the channel to marker No. 341, whence it follows the winding channel
 northward to marker No. 342, situated on an islet on the Soviet side.

 The boundary continues from marker No, 342, at first along the
 channel in the Jakobselv and then out into Lake Rundvatn, before
 extending toward the north and northeast along the lake and again
 along the channel of the river to marker No. 343.  From here the
 boundary continues northward to marker No. 346, where the Norwegian
 post stands on the left riverbank on the northern point of a wooded
 promontory.  The Soviet post is located on the right bank, at the
 northern end of a marsh strip where the river flows into Lake
 Trollvatn.  From marker No. 346 the boundary goes in a northwesterly
 direction along the lake, then follows the channel in the Jakobse'ly
 to marker No. 348, at which point it turns in a northeasterly
 direction to No. 349, leaving an isle on the Norwegian side and
 three on the Soviet side.  From marker No. 349 the boundary extends
 in the same direction, past two Norwegian isles and one Soviet isle,
 to marker No. 350.  It follows a northerly course along Lake Kjosen,
 then turns in a northeasterly direction to marker No. 352.  From here
 the boundary extends toward the northeast along some rapids and then
 in a general northerly direction to marker No. 353, at which point
 it follows the bends of the channel for approximately 2.7 kilometers
 (about 1.7 miles) to marker No. 358.  In this sector the boundary
 passes numerous isles along Rundholen, a wide-section of the river.
 From marker No. 358 the boundary follows a general northwesterly
 course past a number of islets to marker No. 362; the Sandvasselv
 enters the Jakobsely on the Norwegian.side of the border between
 markers Nos. 360 and 361.  The boundary then continues in a north-
 northwesterly direction to marker No. 364, with several wooded islands
 on both sides of the border.  The Norwegian post stands on the left
 riverbank, 66 meters (216.53 feet) north of a hut (Elveheim), and the
 Soviet post stands on the lower right bank, at the northern tip of
 two small rock islands.  From marker No. 364 the boundary continues
 along the channel, swinging to the west and then the north in a sharp
 curve, to marker No. 365, whence it continues along the channel in a
 north-'northwesterly direction, past three isles on the Soviet side
 and two on the Norwegian side, to marker No. 366.  The boundary then
 turns in a northeasterly direction to marker No. 367, where it
 makes a double bend toward the southeast, the northwest, and back to
 the east-southeast to marker No. 368.  It then swings along the
 channel in another horseshoe curve around Langletneset, passes two
 isles on the Norwegian side, and turns to the north-northeast to
 marker No. 369.  From there the boundary travels in a general norther-
 ly direction (first northeast, then northwest) to marker No. 372,
 from which point it swings along the channel in three sharp turns,
 chiefly west-northwest, leaving five isles on the Soviet side, to
 marker No. 373.

 The boundary continues to marker No. 374 along the channel in
 a northwesterly direction, turning west-northwest and passing two
 islets on the Soviet side, to marker No. 375, where it turns in a
 north-northeasterly direction to marker No. 376.  Passing along
 the channel of the river, which bends around two promontories --
 Storsteinneset on the Norwegian side and an unnamed peninsula on
 the Soviet side -- the boundary extends in a generally northwest
 direction to marker No. 378, then winds toward the northwest, west,
 and north over some rapids to marker No. 379.  Continuing in a
 general northwesterly direction to marker No. 382, the boundary
 turns toward the northeast past a small brush-covered isle on the
 Soviet side to marker No. 383.  The Norwegian post stands on the low,
 rocky left riverbank, 120 meters (393.7 feet) south-southeast of
 the Bjornstad Farm and 33 meters (108.26 feet) from the border.
 Curving along a bend in the channel toward the east and southeast
 past the mouth of the Tverrelva River to marker No. 384, the bound-
 ary extends in a general northerly direction (first east and then
 west) to marker No. 386.  In this sector the Norwegian post stands
 on the left bank, on a large crag 4 meters (13.12 feet) west of a
 road running between Lillesanden and Bjornstad.  The boundary turns
 from marker No. 386, first in a northeasterly direction, then bend-
 ing sharply toward the east and then the northwest, to marker No.
 387, located on a low, wooded promontory on the Norwegian side, 170
 meters (557.74 feetY northeast of the Heimdal Farm and 36 meters
 (118.11 feet) from the border.  The Soviet post stands on the right
 riverbank, at the edge of a steep wooded slope 16.5 meters (54.13
 feet) from the border.
 Continuing to wind along with the channel in a general north-
 northwesterly direction, the boundary extends approximately 3.5
 kilometers (about 2.2 miles) to marker No. 394.  In this area,
 Norwegian marker No. 391 is situated 52 meters (170.6 feet) north-
 east of a school at Eggemoen, and marker No. 394 is located 140
 meters (459.31 feet) from the Heggdalsmo Farm.  The Soviet post
 stands on the right riverbank, on a low, rocky sandbar 13 meters
 (42.65 feet) from the foot of the northwestern slope of Pikkutunturi
 Mountain.  The boundary then twists and turns in sweeping curves along
 the channel, chiefly to the northwest, to marker No. 400, then turns
 in a general westerly direction to marker No. 401.  In this sector
 Norwegian post No. 396 stands on the left bank of the Jakobselv,
 on a steep mountain slope descending from Ovrefl&g, 5 meters (16.4
 feet) west of the Lillesanden-Bjornstad road, and post No. 399 is
 located on a steep dip descending from Nedrefl9g, 7 meters (22.96

 (939.3 feet) from the border.  From marker No. 405 the boundary
 goes along the deep channel toward the north-northwest, past a
 large sandbank that divides at Storbekken, to marker No. 407.  From
 here the boundary extends in the same direction for less than a
 kilometer to marker No. 411, with the Norwegian post on the left
 bank at the northeast end of Storsanden, and the Soviet post near
 the top of a crag on the right bank, 9.6 meters (31.5 feet) northwest
 of a cairn that was erected in 1826 and bears the old number 363.
 At low tide, numerous sandbanks are exposed in the wide section
 of the Jakobselv south of its mouth.  The boundary in this area
 follows the channel of the river at low tide, which places it close
 to the Soviet side of the estuary (see map 12104).  The boundary
 continues near the Soviet bank through the narrows to marker No. 412,
 the last marker at the mouth of the river.  Between markers Nos.
 412 and 415 the boundary is marked by a series of sight lines from
 boundary markers and by special sight markers. From marker No. 412
 the boundary goes north-northwest in a stria  t line for 47.8 meters
 (156.8 feet), north for 214 meters (702 feet), and again north-
 northwest for 429 meters (1,407 feet) to the final marker, No. 415.
 C.  Boundary Marking, Administration, and Security
 The land boundary between Norway and the USSR is marked by pairs
 of wooden posts or by single stone cairns (Figures 5 and 6).  Each
 marker is visible from the next, and in no case are the markers more
 than 1 kilometer apart.  Double markers on land are placed at a
 distance of 2 meters (6.56 feet) on either side of the line, and the
 line itself is indicated by a small wooden post or by the center of
 a 25-centimeter (9.84-inch) circle carved in rock.  A cleared strip
 along the entire land boundary measures 8 meters (26.24 feet) in
 width, which, in the case of the double markers, includes the 4 meters
 (13.12 feet) between the posts and 2 meters (6.56 feet) behind each
 post.  Markers Nos. 11, 208, 211, 222, and 279, at the main break-
 points (changes of direction) in the boundary (see map 11738),
 are old stone cairns, which were-restored in 1947.
 Where the boundary follows the Pasvikelv and the Jakobselv, it
 is marked by double posts, one on either side of the river or lake,
 or one on a bank (Figure 7) and one on an island. North of the
 mouth of the Jakobselv is the northernmost marker of the 1947 bound-
 ary, marker No. 415.  This is a buoy stake anchored at a depth of
 17 meters (55.77 feet).
 Most of the boundary posts are 2 meters (6.56 feet) high and
 22 centimeters  (8.66 inches) square.  The Norwegian posts are

 painted yellow with black tips, and the Soviet posts are painted in
 alternating red and green stripes with red tips.
 A very detailed agreement dealing with border activities and
 providing means for the settlement of conflicts and incidents was
 signed on 29 December 1949.  The agreement went into effect on
 30 October 1950, after exchange of instruments of ratification in
 Moscow. 11/
 The agreement provides regulations for the following: (1) the
 inspection and maintenance of markers and a cleared strip (vista)
 along the boundary; (2) the use of boundary streams and lakes, in-
 cluding shipping, log floating, and fishing; (3) land use along
 the land boundary, including hunting, agriculture, and mining; (11)
 the avoidance of incidents; and (5) the solution of disputer and the
 enforcement of the provisions of the agreement.  Article I states
 specifically that the boundary extends under the ground and into the
 air.  Points 2 and 3 are of particular interest, since their effec-
 tiveness in guaranteeing to residents of the border areas the right to
 pursue their means of livelihood will determine whether the course
 of the boundary will be subject to dispute in the future.
 The provisions for the movement of vessels and for fishing apply
 to both the Pasvikelv and Jakobselv, but the regulations on timber
 floating apply only to the Pasvikelv, probably because the Jakobsely
 area is almost barren.  Vessels may use the main channel, even if
 they must cross the line to do so, in the narrow sections of the
 Pasvikelv between markers Nos. 9 and 10 and at marker No. 196 and
 along the entire Jakobselv boundary.  This permits Soviet travel
 through the part of the Pasvikelv that lies wholly within Norway.
 Limitations at marker No. 196, on the other hand, prohibit Norwegian
 transport through the Soviet Kolttakengyas area, thus preventing
 Norwegian use of.the river as a route to and from the sea.  Above
 this area, the river would not be a main waterway even if it were
 open, since only shallow Lapp boats can navigate above the Soviet-
 held portion and portages are necessary at the falls and rapids.
 In the larger lakes the only vessels allowed to cross the boundary
 are those used in log floating, which may do so under certain
 conditions.
 Fishing is allowed up to the boundary, but fishing zones are
 not defined by marker numbers.  Presumably fishing by nationals
 of the USSR is not permitted in the part of the Pasvikely between
 boundary markers Nos. 9 and 11, which belongs to Norway, or by
 Norwegians in the Kolttakengyas region, which belongs to the USSR.
 Both travel along and fishing in the rivers at night are prohibited

 except on the larger lakes, where vessels must stay at least 200
 meters (656.2 feet) from the line and be adequately lighted.  All
 vessels must be marked clearly, and landing on the bank of the other
 country is allowed only in case of distress.
 Limitations on the floating of timber are not so strict.  Nor-
 mally, logs may be floated freely through the two sectors of the
 Pasvikelv that lie entirely on either the Norwegian or Soviet side
 of the line.   This is a distinct advantage to the Norwegians, since
 it gives them access to the mouth of the Pasvikely, which lies in
 their territory.  Soviet regulation has disturbed the water level in
 some areas to such a degree, however, that log floating by Norwegians
 has been restricted.  Until special agreements have been reached on
 control of the water level of the Pasvikely, the Norwegians will
 probably avoid the risk of having timber lie dry in the riverbed.
 The boundary administrators are to decide by 1 April of each year
 when timber may be floated in the area.  Foremen and crews are
 allowed to cross the river and work on the opposite bank by daylight
 to set up installations essential to the floating activities.  At
 least 5 days' notice of such a boundary crossing must be given to
 authorities of the other country, and the workers must have special
 certificates from their boundary commissioner.  Timber floated down
 the river is not subject to customs or other duties.
 Agriculture, lumbering, and mining, are to be carried on without
 violating or damaging territory or property of the other country or
 crossing the boundary for any reason.  Wild animals and birds are not
 to be shot or pursued across the boundary.   The other party must be
 notified of dangerous forest fires across the boundary, or of
 trees that have fallen across the line, which will then be cut and
 returned.  Mineral deposits may not be explored or exploited in a
 manner that might cause damage on the other side of the boundary.
 (Figure 8.) These activities are prohibited within a 20-meter
 (65.6-foot) strip along the boundary unless the two parties agree to
 an exception and make adequate provisions to "insure the preservation
 of the boundary line."
 Conflicts and incidents resulting from nonconformance with the
 regulations or from such issues as injury of persons living on the
 other side of the boundary, unapproved crossings and communications,
 animals straying across the boundary, photographing of parts of the
 other country, and damaging of markers are to be handled by the
 boundary commissioners.  Serious issues may be negotiated through
 diplomatic channels, but provision is made for returning such issues
 to local authorities for discussion.  (Figure 9.)

 The 1949 regime agreement provided for the concluding of
 special agreements regarding the construction of any installations
 on the boundary rivers that might affect the flow or level of water.
 Before the regime agreement was drawn up, some Norwegian farmland
 in the valley had been flooded during the summer and suffered from
 drought in the fall because the USSR had dammed the river and regu-
 lated the water level, probably in connection with the Yaniskoski
 powerplant upstream beyond the southern end of the Finnish-USSR
 boundary.  The problem of waterflow seems likely to become increasing-
 ly significant since the Yaniskoski dam has been completed.  Another
 dam is under construction at the Rajakoski (Ragjeguoikka) (falls)
 and possibly still another on the Pasvikelv near Kolttakengyas.
 The great number of boundary restrictions necessitates a system
 of almost constant patrol, particularly in the settled Pasvikelv
 Valley.  The Norwegians, as a result of the December 1949 agreement,
 planned to expand their frontier police force and, in response to
 Soviet protests against Norwegian boundary crossings, to have a
 permanent police force in the frontier areas where settlement
 is comparatively dense.  According to recent press reports, the
 Norwegian Government, in connection with the next national budget,
 will recommend that the present border patrol be almost doubled in
 strength.  If the reported proposals are put into effect, a force of
 approximately 50 men will patrol the 122-mile-long Norwegian-Soviet
 frontier.  The recommendations will also include the construction of
 houses and watchtowers to facilitate the work of the border guards.
 The USSR has placed wooden watchtowers at points along the
 Pasvikelv portion of the boundary averaging one-half kilometer
 (1,640 feet) apart and about 200 yards behind the line. 12/  Although
 the border is watched closely by Soviet guards, it is apparently
 possible to cross undetected during the summer.  The Soviets can
 "organize a very effective pursuit" if an illegal crossing is sus-
 pected, 13  but the Soviet side of the border does not appear to be
 as heavily guarded here as farther south.
 D.  Maps of the Boundary
 The exact location of the present Norway-USSR boundary is shown
 best on the official 1947 demarcation map at 1:25,000 (1 in list
 of citations at end of this section).  Ranking second is the Norwegian
 topographic map series at 1:100,000, which shows the Norwegian version
 of the line.  No large-scale Soviet maps produced since the USSR
 acquired Pechenga a,re available.  Two sheets of a 1941 Soviet map at
 1:500,000 (2) show the boundary, but this is neither an official
 presentation of the line (the Pechenga area was still a part of
 Finland) nor of much value in tracing the actual detailed course of

 the boundary, since the scale is too small.  Consequently the pres-
 ent Soviet area is covered only by some very old Finnish map series.
 Maps at scales smaller than 1:100,000 do not show adequately
 such detailed features as islands and sandbanks in the boundary
 rivers, which have been the main subjects of dispute.  Sheet No.
 35, 36-8, Pechenga, of the AMS 1:250,000 series (3) shows the bound-
 ary line at that scale as "approximate."  For the Jakobselv area even
 the scale of 1:100,000 is much too small, and sufficient detail is
 given only on the 1947 demarcation map (1) and the Finnish 1:20,000
 maps (4).  Usefulness of the Finnish maps is limited because of the
 early date (1928-33) of the surveys on which they are based;
 changes in the thalweg and islands of the rivers since the surveys
 .were made have altered the position of the boundary considerably.
 Furthermore, the map does not show the boundary symbol in the
 estuary of the Jakobselv and the waters to the north, and the
 available sheets cover the boundary only as far south as approximately
 69'2o'N.
 Finnish coverage of the boundary area at scales of 1:100,000 and
 1:200,000 is spotty, the former covering approximately the same area
 as the 1:20,000 series and the latter covering only the southernmost
 part of the boundary.  Although the scale is too small to show bound-
 ary detail, Finnish map coverage of the boundary is provided by the
 1:400,000 general map of Finland (5).  The most recent date of this
 series is 1946, but a supplementary sheet has been issued that shows
 later boundary revision, including the delineation of the new Finnish-
 Soviet boundary in the Yaniskoski-Niskakoski area.
 German maps and the British GSGS maps of the border area are
 based on the Norwegian and Finnish series, with the boundary line
 apparently taken from the Norwegian 1:100,000 series.
 The boundary demarcation map (1) is more useful than the
 descriptive protocol because it shows the exact position of the
 line; the protocol merely supplements the information shown on the
 map.  The demarcation map locates the boundary line and its 415
 markers and carries topographic detail for strips 0.5 kilometer
 (1,640 feet) wide on both sides of the line, including the areas
 along the banks and shores of boundary rivers and of all but the
 largest boundary lakes..  The markers are located on the map with
 an error of not more than 0.2 millimeter, and topographic detail
 within the boundary strip is plotted with almost equal precision.
