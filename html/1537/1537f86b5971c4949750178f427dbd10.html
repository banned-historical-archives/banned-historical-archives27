Estimated effect of atom developments on Soviet aims-- US Embassy Moscow, in making a tentative comment on the probable effect on Soviet policy of recent developments concerning the atom bomb, expresses the view that the basic US estimates concerning Soviet intentions need not be altered. The Embassy considers that even though the unanticipated Soviet progress in the atomic field might advance the date on which the Kremlin would be prepared to begin hostilities, this date would by no means be in the near future, The Embassy estimates, however, that the Kremlin will consider its hand strengthened in current foreign relations, will be inclined toward increased firm- ness in negotiations, and will try to exploit popular fear throughout the world. Concerning the problems of atomic energy control, the Embassy believes that the USSR will try to stampede the West into acceptance of the Soviet proposal. - 1 b40.14.1Rent NI). .0 -lb 0TOP li CHANGE in Class.

Bevin will reportedly attempt to learn whether the USSR really wants a treaty at this time and what the minimum Soviet position is. Bevin has submitted to the US and French delegations a set of proposals on the outstanding issues which could be used as a basis for a comprehensive settlement, but he will not commit the western powers in his talk with Vishinsky. 4.

Mucci� reports that the initiative in these negotiations, which began during the Chiang-Rhee conference in late August, haS been wholly Chinese, and the Korean Government has been reluctant to commit itself to any agreement which would risk involvement in the Chinese civil war. According to Mucci�, the Chinese wanted Korean bases for carrying out the Nationalist air and sea blockade of the north China coast as well as permission to establish Intelligence installations in Korea; they were unwilling to assure Chinese naval assistance in the event of war with the northern Korean regime, offering only a Chinese fighter- bomber group. Rhee is reportedly seeking a means of terminat- ing the discussions and has assured US Embassy Seoul that no concessions will be made. rit Doc nt No. e/f0 - NO CHA in Class. - 2 - DECLAS IED Class.

Views of four foreign ministers on Austrian trea According to the WS-delegation at ihe Austrian trea talks in New York, Soviet Foreign Minister Vishinsky revealed no change in the Soviet position concerning the treaty in an informal meeting with foreign ministers Acheson, Bevin, and Schuman. Secretary Acheson has advised the Department of State that the meeting with Vishinsky was held in order to review the entire range � of unagreed issues on the Austrian question, thus ena- � bling the western ministers to determine on what points, if any, they might offer to bargain. The Secretary indi- cates that at an earlier meeting of the western ministers Bevin again made a plea for the early conclusion of a treaty, which he believes should not be held up by the present points of disagreement. Schuman, while agree- ing with Bevin concerning the urgency of a treaty, is not prepared at present to agree to all the Soviet demands. The Secretary expressed the view that the USSR is press- ing the western powers as far as possible for the purpose of weakening Austria and eventually establishing a perma- nent hold through control of the Austrian economy. .0.00 2.

Spaak is reported to be very dubious that devaluation will achieve its goal of narrow- ing the European dollar deficit because he does not believe Europe can produce sufficient extra goods for sale in dollar's to reduce the present deficit. Spaak's general attitude was reportedly one of genuine gloom, although lie "wryly" admitted that "an ex-Prime Minister is by nature inclined to be critical." z ocx icg4 1103 Document No. NO CHANGE in Class. 0 DECLASSIXIED liss.

UK-France favor Austrian treaty on Soviet terms--The British and French representatives at the Austrian treaty talks in New York have taken the line with US Representa- tive Reber that the conclusion of an Austrian treaty at the present time, even on Soviet terms, is better than no treaty at all. The British-French view is that if negotia- tions break down now, the treaty will be indefinitely post- poned and the Soviet occupation prolonged, a development which will more effectively wreck the Austrian economy than will the treaty terms which the USSR now demands. The three representatives agreed, after Reber had pointed out that the US approach to the question is basically differ- ent from the British and French, to refer the matter to their respective foreign ministers in order to determine a common approach for the next meeting. US views on Austrian treaty--The Department of State has advised Secretary Acheson in New York that present British and French views regarding the Austrian treaty raise serious questions regarding the whole western position toward the treaty. The Department believes it should be strongly pressed upon Bevin and Schuman that any further concessions to Soviet demands would endanger the basic US objective of creating an Austrian state capable of independent existence. The Department believes that Vishinsky's present position Indicates that the USSR does not at this time want a treaty which would require military withdrawal from Austria, Hun- gary, and Rumania, except on terms which would permit sub- sequent Soviet repossession of all Austria. The Department stresses that to yield to Soviet demands following the atomic announcement would have more serious repercussions in Europe generally than failure to conclude an Austrian treaty. : :11-0 Document No. NO CHANGE in Class.

French reject German mark devaluation proposal--VS High Commissioner 1ViceIoy reports from Paris that the "nervous" French political situation was an important factor in the French Government's refusal to agree to a 20% devaluation of the German mark. According to McCloy, the French are insisting that agreement be reached simultaneously on German devaluation and on the establishment, not later than 1 January 1950, of parity between German domestic and export prices, especially for coal. McCloy, on the other hand, con- siders it impractical and unwise to attempt to remedy the consequences of a new mark rate before the results of German devaluation are known. McCloy recommends that the High Commission proceed with a 20% devalua- tion of the mark, even without French concurrence; he points out, however, that if the French then appeal the action of the High Commission, the results in Germany would be most unfortunate, if not disastrous.

EUROPE 2. YUGOSLAVIA: Cannon favors Ingoslav SC me mbershie.-- US AmbassadorZannon reports that he is inclined td favor Yugoslav membership in the Security Council. Cannon points out that US support for Yugoslavia might adversely affect US-USSR working relationships, but he considers it likely that Yugoslav membership in the SC would contri- bute to the healthy development of the UN as a truly repre- sentative body. Cannon emphasizes that despite the Yugo- slav-Kremlin quarrel, Yugoslavia is still a "Communist, Eastern European and Slavic" nation and thus its election to the SC would be consistent with the existing principle of geographic and political representation. According to Cannon, a US attempt to exclude Yugoslavia would smack suspiciously of power politics and would help maintain the rigidity of two political blocs. Cannon concludes that although Yugoslavia could scarcely be expected to follow the West out of spite to the Kremlin, the middle-of-the-road policy it may follow in the UN would be a salutary influence.

Quetille indicated that besides the immediate difficulties of the 1950 budget and French worker demands for increased wages, the Present Government has greatly lost prestige because of "political considerations of an international character." Queuille reportedly cited three "major inci- dents" which had caused questioning and bitterness in France: (a) the division of ECA aid, which he believes made the UK "the most favored nation"; (b) the devalua- tion of the British pound, which he feels was handled in such a way as to demonstrate a "complete lack of loyalty" to the continental countries; and (c) recent US moves con- cerning "drastic devaluation" of the German mark, which he regards as "obviously both to the advantage of Germany and the disadvantage of France." The Premier declared that he cannot rely on maintaining his Government in power if France is subjected to further disappointments and shocks.

The Embassy estimates that the cost of living will increase by some 5% in the next six months and that general pressure for higher wages will not become serious be- fore next spring. The Embassy considers that devalua- tion has increased the odds in favor of a fall election but points out that Labor Party leaders are at present divided on the question.

Greek fears over coming GA session--US Ambassador Grady reports that, as the General Assembly session approaches, the Greeks are beginning to fear that they have much to lose and little to gain. They are particularly anxious lest any formal conciliation talks sponsored by the Big Four result in a compromise which: (a) might provide an opportunity for the USSR to intervene in such Greek internal affairs as elections and the treatment of the guerrillas; and (b) thus enable the USSR to continue, through political means, to promote unrest and disorder that would require the expenditure of US aid largely for non-productive purposes. Grady feels that any consulta- tions between Greece and its northern neighbors should therefore be under UN rather than Big Four auspices, unless there are concrete indications of a change in the Soviet attitude. Grady also urges that the US concentrate its efforts on the heart of the problem, namely Albania and Bulgaria, and endeavor to secure strong GA recom- mendations which would provide some hope of at least Interfering with the return of the guerrillas to Greece from those countries. 1 7 SEP '1949 1093 rloun'; n).

McCloy expresses his opinion that dismantling has little value to the US and has a "great abrasive effect" on the Germans, whereas abandonment of the process might give solid support to the new German Republic and provide a "breathing spell of cooperation." McCloy points out that many aspects of dismantling are economically incongruous: he also ex- presses the conviction that present agiistion against dis- mantling is not Inspired by former Nazi elements.

The western commandants indicate that although they see little chance that this change of tactics will result in normalization of Berlin life, they want to present "as good a record of endeavor', as possible to any new meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers; the military officials express the view that western commandants have formerly been too prone to reject Soviet proposals on procedural grounds. (CIA Comment: CIA agrees there is little chance that Berlin life can really be normalized as a result of local discussions with the Soviet commandant.

Estimated effects of US aid for southwest China group--In response to a Department of State query regarding the mili- tary requirements and potentialities of the Nationalist group In southwest China headed by Li Tstmg-jen and Pal Chung- hsi, US Embassy Nanking has replied that the military capabi- lities of this group to organize and continue resistance against the Communists must be considered limited. The Embassy considers that the forces of Pat and Li, if given sufficient US assistance, could maintain themselves against superior Com- munist strength for a maximum period of one year, but that the Comnumis are capable of cutting off Pai's access to coastal ports, thus making an airlift the only channel of supply for these forces. The Embassy- points out that the considerations favor- ing a US plan to bolster this group include: (a) the southward sweep of Communism would be obstructed by continued resist- ance in southwest China, even if only for a year, which would give Southeast Asia more time to strengthen defenses; and (b) effective defense of the southwest would encourage potential resistance groups within the Communist areas of China and generally weaken Communist authority. The Embassy includes among unfavorable considerations that: (a) an openly hostile attitude by the US toward the Communists would unquestionably prevent the establishment of diplomatic relations with the new government of China for some years to come; (b) renewed mili- tary aid to the Nationalists would mean the rapid extinction of all American interests in Communist China; and (c) such action probably would strengthen rather than weaken Chinese Commu- nist ties with Moscow. The Embassy concludes that even by the most optimistic estimate of the benefits to be derived from maintaining Nationalist resistance for a year, the adverse effects would outweigh the advantages. �1-.

No evidence of imeendinj Soviet military activity against Tito.-- S1S In response to requests for evidence regarding Soviet plans to cirm take military action against Yugoslavia, US military attaches in 0 the Soviet orbit countries report that they have found no evidence of Soviet preparations to invade Yugoslavia in the near future. US military authorities in Germany consider that an intensified campaign of Soviet-inspired incidents on the Yugoslav borders will probably be motivated by a Soviet desire to sharpen the war of nerves against Tito and to enhance the chance of success- ful internal Yugoslav disturbances. The US military atiache in Moscow believes that only as a last resort will the Kremlin attempt to remove Tito by Soviet-Satellite military action of a guerrilla nature. (CIA Comment: CIA believes that although the USSR may intensify the current war of nerves against Tito, the Kremlin is unlikely to resort to direct military aggression against Yugoslavia in the near future.) USthinking on referrinav- e uKr mlin dis The Department of State has informed US Embassy London of Its belief that it would be unwise to force Tito's hand either by appealing the Tito-Kremlin problem to the UN or by urging Tito to lodge a complaint. The Department adds that recourse to the UN at this time would have the disadvantage for the Yugoslays of substantiating Soviet charges that Tito is bidding for support from the West; however, should Yugoslavia decide the situation warrants reference to the UN, the US would support appropriate UN action to safeguard Yugoslav independence. Regarding future Yugoslav-Soviet relations the Department expresses the view that if the Soviet campaign against Tito develops into an imminent threat to peace or acts of aggression, referral of the problem to the UN would be both logical and necessary.

Bevin reiterated his belief that it would be wise for the western powers to maintain trade relationships and western establishments in China in order to influence the Chinese Communists in favor of the West. Bevin implied that although he would not press for a prompt conclusion of the Austrian treaty if the US disagrees, he considers the quick conclusion of a treaty, even though re- latively unsatisfactory, to be more advantageous for the US and the UK than a return of the question to the Council of Foreign Ministers. 9 AUG 194S 1077 British Foreign Office views on Austrian treaty--US Embassy London reports that the ritish favor the conclusion of an Austrian treaty in the near future because they: (a) have little hope that the Foreign Ministers could arrange better terms; (b) believe that another opportunity for concluding a treaty may be a long way off; and (c) consider it important to get Soviet forces out of Austria before the Yugoslav situation comes to a head, thereby bolstering the Yugoslav will to resist Kremlin pressure.

Soviet militaryAlove against Tito still held unlikely--US Embassy 3elgde reiterates the view that the Kremlin would prefer to accomplish the liquidation of Tito by methods ostensibly internal rather than by the open use of external force. The Embassy believes that the two recent Soviet notes and the rumors of Soviet troop movements fit this pattern. Pointing out that the Kremlin may, however, regard Tito's elimination important enough to justify the risks in- volved in direct action, the Embassy declares that the only way to deal with this possibility is for the US to make un- mistakably clear to the Kremlin that it will not stand idly / by and see the sovereignty of any small country violated by the USSR. The Embassy believes that if it becomes appro- � palate to refer the Tito-Kremlin issue to the Security Council, the matter should be kept to the basic issue of � Soviet determination to replace the Tito regime with one subservient to the USSR and that in any event only Tugosla,via should take the issue before the UN. British views on referring Tito-Kremlin issue to SC -- According to US Embassy London, the British Foreign Office has concluded that,the Tito-Kremlin dispute has reached the point where all possibility of Soviet military intervention cannot be ruled out and where consideration of preventive measures can no longer be deferred. Concerning the possi- bility of referring the dispute to the Security Council, the Foreign Office believes that such action would have the merit of bringing the situation before world opinion and might not only deter Soviet action against Yugoslavia but would also be useful against the Soviet "peace offensive." The ritish Ambassador in Belgrade has reportedly been instructed to sound out Deputy Foreign Minister Bebler concerning the official Yugoslav view on the possibility of referring the dispute to the SC, either by Yugoslavia or some other country.

The Embassy considers that the reply cannot be called conciliatory because it uncompromisingly restates Yugoslav sovereignty and declares concerning the treat- ment of Soviet citizens that such citizens may leave Yugo- slavia if they wish. The Embassy regards the intent of the Soviet note to be an effort to intensify nervous pressure on the Tito Government and particularly to suggest to the western powers that Tito is a poor economic risk. The Embassy expects this campaign to continue and indicates that Yugoslav officials believe their reply will gain them time but not a relaxation of tha pressure. 2.

The Embassy indicates that the Foreign Office, which would hive by such action to thwart possible Soviet intentions to take decisive action against Tito, believes the preferable course would be for Yugoslavia to take the issue to the SC. (CIA Comment: CIA estimates that Tito, fearful that an appeal to the Security Council at this time would be an ad- mission of weakness which might have bad repercussions intetnallq;mould consider such a move premature.

The Depart- ment indicates that the US proposes to regard favorably the export to Yugoslavia of aviation equipment and the ex- change of reciprocal air rights between Yugoslavia and nations friendly to the western powers. The Department advises Embassy London that although the US perceives no danger to the interests of the US in dealing with Yugo- slavia on such a basis, it does not desire that friendly states pursue such a policy unless they derive positive benefits from the exchange. 2.

The Embassy Indicates that a re-examination of the evidence has not altered its contrary estimate concerning such a network. The Em- bassy suggests that the note was timed so as to profit by this 'critical moment in Yugoslavia's economic situation and specifi- cally to coincide with the arrival in Belgrade of a survey mission from the International Bank.

Soviet military move against Tito held unlikely�US Ambas- sador Kirk reports that foreign diplomatic observers in Moscow continue to discount the probability of direct Soviet action against Tito at this time despite the ominous tone of the latest Soviet note to Yugoslavia. According to Kirk, the US Embassy is in general agreement with the view of most observers that the Kremlin is counting on the liquidation of Tito as a consequence of the serious Yugoslav economic situ- ation and a Soviet "war of nerves" accompanied by harassing measures short of hostilities. US Embassy Belgrade reports, concerning current rumors of Soviet troop movements along the Yuroslav border, that although the Yugoslav Government is believed fully aware of such rumors, there is no evidence that new security measures are being taken. (CIA Comment: CIA agrees that overt Soviet military action against Yugoslavia remains doubtful. CIA considers the rumors from Hungary and Rumania regarding Soviet troops movements along the Yugoslav border to be a part of the Soviet "war of nerves' rather than an indication of imminent military action by the USSR.) 1071 2. British policy on Italian colonies�The British Foreign Office has informed US Embassy London that as a basis for settling the Italian colonies problem, the UK now favors: (a) independ- ence for Libya within two to five years, with interim administra- tion by present occupying powers; (b) incorporation into Ethiopia of all Eritrea except the western province which would go to the Sudan; and (c) either Italian trusteeship over Somaliland or, if this is not acceptable to the UN General Assembly, postpone- ment el the question to the 1950 GA session.

The UK also opposes an inde- pendent Eritrea on the grounds that it would be a weak state and open to undesirable influences. The UK believes that the question of unifying Cyrenaica and Tripolitania should be decided by the Libyans themselves after their independence has been granted and that meanwhile nothing should be done � to prejudice eventual unification. 3. British and French views on future handlin_g of Austrian talks-- US Representative Reber in London expresses the view that the Soviet deputy at the Austrian treaty negotiations is clearly not authorized to accept at this time any compromise on major outstanding issues but that the USSR expects further discussions at the ministerial level later. Reber indicates that the British, who favor the conclusion of a treaty by the 1 September dead- line, believe this can be accomplished by accepting the Soviet terms on the German assets question. Reber explains that both the French and British wish to avoid a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers before settlement of the Austrian treaty because they fear that the USSR might insist upon dis- cussing Germany as well as Austria. 4. US views on Southeast Asia unio --In reply to the request of Philippine UN Representative Romulo for active US support of a non-military Southeast Asia union, the Department of State has reiterated that the US will view sympathetically any efforts by the peoples of Asia to cooperate in pursuit of common economic and political objectives but will avoid taking any steps at this tine which could be misinterpreted as US maneuver- ing behind the scenes.

According to Reber, the British feel that the importance of completing a treaty by approximately 1 September outweighs the disadva.ntages of accepting present Soviet terms which they believe do not create sufficient hardship to warrant the risk of indefinite post- ponement of the Austrian treaty. British officials con- sider that western failure to reach agreement with the USSR now would have a depressing effect internationally whereas an Austrtan agreement would bring real im- provement and would benefit Austria by freeing the � country from occupation costs and Soviet exploitation of eastern Austria.

Kirk suggests that the vehemence of recent Soviet propaganda claiming that Tito, not the USSR, abandoned Yugoslav claims on Austria, reveals Soviet embarrassment over the Paris agreement. Kirk indicates that some diplomatic personnel in Moscow believe that the Kremlin has a definite plan for Tito's liquidation but that the US Embassy is not inclined to accept this theory. The Embassy believes the Kremlin may estimate that a combination of subversive guerrilla activities and Yugoslav economic difficulties will bring about Tito's fall at an early date.

Reber believes that if the Soviet stand is not relaxed, it will soon be necessary for the western powers to present their minimum treaty requirements and thus indi- cate the point at which the treaty will require further considera- tion by the Foreign Ministers. Reber suggests that while it is important to delimit the area of Soviet control in Austria, additional treaty provisions having this effect can be obtained only by granting new concessions to the USSR. Reber feels it is more material for the US to determine how Austria is to meet its payments obligations to the USSR than to discuss the consequences of Austrian default.

Douglas believes the US faces the same dilemma, but points out that: (a) by opposing Libyan aspirations for independence the US might create a situation which would seriously prejudice the continued enjoyment of vitally important strategic facilities there: (b) if the US supports the French in delaying Libyan independence, the large bloc of states stretching from the East Mediterranean to the Philippines would accuse the US of sacrificing principle to political expediency; and (c) there is no assurance that agreement to delay Libyan independence would induce the French to speed the introduction of basic reforms in French North Africa. Douglas points out that the US views on French North Africa are known to the French, while the British have pursued a "hands off" policy.

YUGOSLAVIA: Analysis of Yugoslav economic situation-- US Ambassador annon expresses his belief that, largely as a result of tightened economic sanctions by the Soviet bloc without a compensatory increase in Yugoslav trade with the West, the Yugoslav economic situation will be critical for the next year. Cannon adds that without moderate western credits the Tito regime may be weakened to the point where it cannot be effective in the role the US expects it to play. In pointing out that such credits would be insurance against the collapse of Tito's regime, Cannon believes that early conclusion of the British-Yugoslav nego- tia.tions involving a credit of eight to ten million pounds would help counteract the effects both of the reduction in Yugoslav trade with the East and the suspension or slowdown of Italian-Yugoslav economic negotiations.

Although Patterson believes that Egypt might take a more conciliatory attitude toward the proposal if the US were actually able to guarantee Egypt a land bridge to yordan as compensation for the Gaza strip, he fears that "continued harping" on the merits of the Gaza plan might cause the Eygptians to regard the US as "an accomplice of an expansionist and aggressive Israel."

Kirk believes, however, that Soviet acceptance of the western proposal would constitute the greater blow against Tito and that, therefore, there is sufficient danger of the Kremlin's adopting this policy to warrant every effort by the US to promote a compromise agreement on Trieste between Italy and Yugoslavia. 18 JUL 1949 � nal 2 S ia to acce t Israeli compromise armistice--Syrian Prime r araz s omre � � - $ - er eeley in Damascus that the Syrian delegation to the armistice talks " ith Israel has been instructed to accept the armistice agreement as modi- fied by Israel.

US views on Yugoslav-Greek relations --The Department of Ste has suggested that US Embassy Belgrade express to Yugoslav officials the satisfaction of the US Governmeg regard- ing Tito's recent declaration on closing the Greek frontier, as well as the hope that this policy statement will be imple- mented immediately by concrete measures. In order to con- firm the announced cessation of Yugoslav aid to the guerrillas, the Department also suggests that Tito be requested to allow. a "routine" inspection trip of the Greek border by western military attaches in Belgrade. The Embassy may also in- dicate that the immediate advantages to Yugoslavia of a positive rapprochement with Greece include: (a) resumption of normal commercial relations; (b) re-opening of a Yugoslav Free Zone in Salonika; and (c) restoration of Salonika-Belgrade rail communications. The Department, in pointing out that the Greek Government has expressed its willingness to negotiate these matters with Tito, sees no objection to the Embassy's sounding out possible Yugoslav reaction to Greek overtures or to supporting a Greek demarche if and when it is made. 1 5 JUL 1949 1039 ledvit FAR EAST 2.

Soviet relations and Yugoslavia's desire to improve relations with the West. In support of this view, Cannon points out that Tito directed the burden of his attack against the USSR and clothed his criticism of the western powers in "friendly terms." According to Cannon, Tito's speech revealed Yugoslav concern that a four .power agreement on Trieste might sacrifice Yugo- slav interests there and implied that the Trieste question could be solved by Yugoslav-Italian agreement. Cannon attaches great importance to Tito's announcement that the Greek-Yugo- slav border would be closed and believes it indicated a basic change in Yugoslav policy toward Greece. Cannon adds that Tito's more conciliatory attitude regarding Greece may be a bid for sympathetic western treatme t on Trieste.

British view of Berlin traffic situation--According to US CIFI IS Ambassador Douglas in London, recent Soviet measures re- stricting truck traffic to Berlin are regarded initially by the British Foreign Office as merely another attempt by the USSR to throw its weight around. The Foreign Office believes once the USSR feels that the West has been "suitably impressed," traffic will be permitted to resume its normal flow. 'Douglas adds that the British consider the current restrictions illustrate the danger of any relaxation in western efforts to build up Ber- lin's stocks for the coming winter. (CIA Comment: CIA believes that the USSR will continue to impose sporadic obstructions on Berlin traffic in order to keep the western position in Berlin as weak as possible and to maintain pressure on the West during the present interzonal �trade talks.) 2. Early four-power agreement on Austrian Army urged--General Keyes, US Commander in Austria, pointing out that the impor- tant question of the establishment of an Austrian Army prior to the withdrawal of occupation forces was not dealt with in the Council of Foreign Ministers, urges that the deputies take up this matter before treaty negotiations proceed too far. Keyes believes that: (a) it would be futile to attempt to secure Soviet approval in the Allied Council granting Austria permis- sion to begin military planning before the treaty is ratified; and (b) the western powers would be inviting disastrous re- prisals if they began organizing an Austrian Army in their zones without prior Soviet approval. Keyes expresses the opinion that in order to avoid grave risks to Austrian indepen- dence, this problem must be satisfactorily solved before the treaty is signed. Meanwhile, Keyes reports that 18 July has been accepted by the British and French as the date on which to commence the training program of the Austrian gendarmerie regiment in the western zones.

IRAN: Pro sed US ai_m..cncasiticized--US Ambassador itttley reports that in a second discussion of the proposed US aid to Iran, Governor Ebtehaj of the National Bank of Iran was more vehement than during the first talk. Ebtehaj expressed the view that the US approach to Iran on this matter was not only "Incomprehensible and unacceptable but also dictatorial in nature." He declared that if "this token and measly gesture" represented the final US word, he would most strongly recommend to the Shah that Iran disassociate itself from the US and, without going over to the Soviet side, either try to find help in other countries or stand on its own feet. Wiley believes that the Shah will be greatly influenced by Ebtehaj's reaction to the US offer and will not be satisfied unless US assistance to Iran equals that given to Turkey.

CHINA: US pressure recommended to ease Shanghai situation-- S US Consul deneral Cabot in Shanghai, in an anarYsis ot tne disquieting pattern of recent events in Shanghai, reports that: (a) the only law in Shanghai is that of the Communist military authorities; (b) foreigners are often subjected to an invasibn of their fundamental rights; and (c) on the basis of available Information, events in Shanghai are believed part of a normal pattern of revolution rather than a deliberate Communist plan. Cabot points out that foreign firms are currently losing heavily but fears that if they try to close down, foreign nationals may find themselves virtually held for ransom, with the approval or acquiescence of Communist authorities. Cabot believes that if the US is to pursue an antagonistic policy toward the Chinese Communists, it would be better to get all Americans out of Shanghai (and if necessary pay them for their property losses) rather than leave them where they are subject to Communist retaliation and where their continued presence under such circumstances will lead to further incidents. Cabot therefore, in the hope of forcing the Communists to do some- thing about the situation in Shanghai, recommends that the US request permission from Communist authorities in Peiping to evacuate by. commercial ship or planes all Americans desiring to leave Shanghai. (CIA Comment: CIA believes that the Chinese Com- munist Party, while officially committed to the protection of foreign interests, welcomes the opportunity provided in Shanghai for channeling the demonstration of popular dissatisfaction with present conditions toward foreigners rather than the new Com- munist regime. The Communists thus hope indirectly to war the western powers that their future in China depends upon the establishment of friendly diplomatic and commerical relations with the new regime. Because the Communists do not wish US commercial interests to withdraw from China at this time, how- ever, a withdrawal threat might well induce the Communist Party leadership to order local authorities in Shanghai to ease the situation.)
