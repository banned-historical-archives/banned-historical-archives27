 Briefly Noted
 moon U.rokae Ramer 7's successful mission (28-31 July) made headlines in
 almost all areas.  The effect of this US space success should be prolonged by
 replaying all forthcoming stories on the scientific results of Ranger 7's
 photography, or on improved prospects for an early Apollo manned flight to
 the moon.  Press Comment of 3 August carries an article by Sir Bernard Lovell
 from the British scientific magazine, New Scientist, on   1  'y.   Future
 stories might note that even before the successful Ranger 7 shot, Sir Bernard
 (not noted as being critical of Soviet space achievements) hadlu the hat
 "there seems little doubt that the Russians are fast losing ground Americans." Sir Bernard also concludes (and President Johnson's comments on
 Ranger 7 could be used to confirm this) that there is no sign of a real slow-
 dawn in the US civilian space program.  it might be further noted that Sir
 moon
 Bernard identified the absence
 anger    successful
 tossoas a lve this problem both
 the U US and
 the US.
 OAU Heads of State Meeting
 African heads of state gathered in Cairo July 17th for the second OAU
 meeting since its founding ]A months earlier.  Accomplishments:  Addis Ababa
 was named permanent headquarters, Guinean Dialio Tell  esecretary-general;
 Nkrumah'a call for immediate union and em Africai military high Ncommand
 pre-
 independence passed over in favor of gradual unity urged by Tanganyika
 independence borders were declared binding unless changed by peaceful means.
 Problems:  How to enforce the boycott against shippers and airlines who deal
 with South Africa, without suffering severe commercial losses; how to coordi-
 nate rival liberation movements and increase liberation committee assistance
 to rebels in Portuguese territories and Southern Rhodesia.
 Sukarno Plays With a Communist Pandora's Box in Malaysia.
 Indonesian agents are reported contacting former Malaysian terrorists in
 southern Thailand.   NY Times or Press Comment 19 Julyj  News of Sukarno'.s
 expanding "crush Malaysia  campaign comes-6n'-the heels of Mikoyan'a promise
 in Djakarta to supply Indonesia with more weapons for aggression and to sup-
 port Sukarno's war against "neo-colonialists."  It also coincides with an
 Indonesian campaign to incite Malay racial antagonisms against the Chinese
 (75% of the population) in Singapore.
 Most of the Malaysian Communist terrorists, many of whom not only (find
 safe haven In Indonesia but are being trained there by Sukarno, are ethnic
 Chinese -- whose allegiance both Sukarno and Khrushchev should have reason
 to question.  This strange coalition for aggression makes Sukarno's Panch
 Shila and Khrushchev's Peaceful Coexistence look phonier than ever.  We must
 expose this deadly war-like adventure of the two self-proclaimed "peace
 champions" at all opportunities.

 Principal Developments:
 1.  The Chinese replied to the CP8U15`June declaration of intent to
 accelerate prep's?.tions'for a world conference in an 8,000-word letter dated
 28 July, probably the most brutally arrogant reiteration yet of CCP intent
 to "bury" the CPSU leaders unless they surrender (see summary in Chrono,
 July 30/31)?  It refutes all aspects of the CPSU letter, recalls that the
 CPSU's 'special right" in convoking meetings was made contingent or prior
 consultation and`unan.3mous'agreement, declares that the CCP will never take
 part in a Soviet-118pttist meeting, and taunts the CPSU with having fallen
 into its own trap and facing an insoluble dilemma.  In addition to denouncing
 Soviet betrayal"ant subversion of the Japanese GP by conniving with Shiga
 and company, it charges that the CPSU is "ganging up with Indonesian reaction-
 aries" against the PKI.  Chinese media heavily replay anti-Soviet JCP, PKI
 end N. Korean materials; also the Rumanian protest against joint Danube ex-
 ploitation.
 2.  The open. `w9rfare between the C1'S'(J and the" Japenes`e OP described in
 +33 assumed major'proportions,with new developments almost daily.  The Indone-
 sian and N. Korean parties openly supported the JCP against the "subversive
 machinations" of the "modern revisionists," the N. Koreans adding:  "We have
 already had bitter experience of such an act of these people."  (See Chrono,
 throughout the period.)
 3.  Soviet media coxtinued to carry "routine" anti-COP material and
 statements of support from other parties -- including specific Finnish sup-
 port of a Soviet-style preparatory meeting -- while unconfirmed reports say
 that behind-the-scenes preparations for such a conference are going ahead.
 Pravda on the l5th'and 24th published extensive excerpts from Chinese docu-
 ments and speeches -- carefully selected and juxtaposed to show how the CCP
 line has changed over the past five years and more.
 o~ K~irushchev, Novotny, and Ulbricbt with Gomulka in
 4.  The ga her ing'
 Warsaw for the '~Oth anniversary -of "People's Poland," the 5-day visit of the
 top-level Rumanian delegation headed by Premier Maurer to Paris, and an un-
 expected 2-day visit of C?SU leader Podgorny to Bucharest added nothing to the
 overt dissensions in the SCM.
 5.  The M              ~oreim Ministry sent another protest note to the
 Chinese Embassy in Ulan Bator, this time in connection with "obscene, rowdy
 acts of certain' Chinese"citizens" in U.B. during Chinese Mongolian cycle
 races (Chrono, July 3l).
 6.  As the fperiod ended, another major public batt1e, ' before non-Communist
 peace partisans as wa l'as'hard-line Communists, was developing in Japan in
 connection with the rival Tokyo and Hiroshima world "Ban-the-Bomb" conferences.
 The Chinese and their supporters won the first round hands down, -- but the
 va1I-out of''alsnost half of the delegations in support of the Soviets may have
 made it a hollow victory. (See Chrono, Jul   0 and continuing.)

 Sinificance:
 The 28 July COP letter, brazenly but deftly countering mostof the points
 of the 15 June C1 tT letter, clearly outlined the dilemma in which the CPSU
 finds its.e].f.  It is' most difficult to foresee a successful outcome of Khru-
 actuaolls toeconvenethaiigmeeorna or a preparatory 2b-party meeting:  if he manages
 which we still consider rather doubtful,
 considering the opposition even among pro-Soviet CPs, let alone within the
 C?SU itself (of which we kizow too little) --, then he must formalize the split
 and pay a virtually unacceptable price to obtain some semblance of world-wide
 support (not from the Chinese themselves who are almost certainly beyond con-
 cessions, but fic'm some of the "wavering!"parties).  His only other alterna-
 tive is to abaodop;the plan of a world conference -- which must result in
 further heavy loss of face 'tor the'CPSU and for Khrushchev personally.
 Meanwhile, the non-Communist peace movement throughout the world must be
 further disillusioned by the bitter public battles characterizing this year's
 rival ban-the-bomb conferences in`Japan.

 "welc  es with great pleasure" the "new victory" of the Japanese CP in driv-
 ing out "the revisionist.Shiga=Suzuki.group."  (It also reiterates PKI in-

 "Youforcedthe delegation to accept the draft of a ,joint com-
 ;
 mmuniqua wh1a~ was utterly different "from the contents of the talks.  it
 is natural, therefore, for the delegation to have rejected ilt.
 Taking up the Soviet charge that the JCP refused to publicize CPSU views, the
 JCP asserts it has "intensively publicized important Soviet material, includ-
 ing that differing from ` m  the stand and opinion of the JCP."
 "On the contrary., you have long refrained from informing the Soviet
 Communists and people'of`lthe important decisions and statements of the
 JCP. After all,- you arbitrarily demand that the JCP publish your ma-
 terial only`and?that the SC? unconditionally agree with your stand and
 opinion.  You, however, have no such rights...."
 Regarding the CPSU complaint that 'heir 18 April letter had not been discussed
 in JCP inner circles,
 "Your assertion is no  true a  all.  In any case, just when and how our
 Party's Presidium and`Cd'disciis6 the problems of the ICM and relations
 with the CPStT is our Party's internal problem."
 Noting that "we have mutually agreed not to announce the contents of the Japan-
 Soviet party conference in'Moscow," the statement asks rhetorically:
 "What is the objective of this unilateral announcementof your let-
 ter?                    The only answer' is that you are providing materials to slander our

 the CCP 'will never'take Part" in a Soviet-style meeting, and taunts the CPSU
 with its "insoluble dilemma."
 The C P letter, is divi.ed into 5 numbered parts.  The first, addressing
 itself to the Soviet charge' of a SYiinese ?"volte-face" on the question of a
 world meeting, reviews the history of the question a la COP, beginning with
 their endorsement in the'spring of''1962 of a joint Indonesian-Vietnam-New

 it is really a Soviet'"volte-race.'   Of particular interest:

 some of the 26 countries and you and i?;e di fer as to which of the two should
 attend."  Also, "it is necessary to achieve unanimity" or "no preparatory
 meeting of whatever kind will be legal."
 -- Second, on CCP-CPSU talks, it notes that the CPSU is now "trying to brush,
 them aside" as of little import" and preparing to call a world meeting with-
 out agreement between the two.  "?What is this if not a resolve to call a
 meeting to precipitate a split?"
 -- Third, on the composition of the international meeting, it rejects emphat-
 ically the CPSU criterion for  new participants, stating that "M-L parties
 which have been rebuilt after breaking with revisionism...wil1 of course be
 entitled to participate, and no one has any right to exclude them."
 -- Fourth, on the right to convene an international meeting, it rebuts the
 CPSU claim of a "special responsibility" deriving from a 1957 decision by
 noting that the full text of that decision requires "consultation with the
 FPs before calling any meeting."
 "Moreover, we wish to point out that the principle of unanimity
 through consultation among the FPs was established at the meeting of the
 FPs in 1960.... Should you dare to violate this principle..., you will
 have no right whatsoever to call any international meeting."
 Section IV is a bold claim of the rapidly growing strength of the true
 Marxist-Leninists -- which "strikes terror into your hearts" -- and reaf-
 firmation of CCP "duty" to "give firm support" to them, including some of
 the following passages:
 "Your letter brazenly charges us with 'the intensification of
 factional, disruptive activities, and the utmost exacerbation of po-
 lemics.'  This only serves to show that you are so terrified by the
 mighty forces`df 14-L that you have taken leave of your senses and are
 talking nonsense.
 "The splits that   ve occ6red in the CPs of Australia, Belgium,
 Brazil, Ceylon, and many other countries are the result of your own
 pursuit of a `revisionist and divisive line and of your own frenzied

 813.  De Gaulle's ym,.enilinour o: South America (20 September - 16 October)
 25X1 C
 SITUATION:  De Gaulle's grand design of restoring France to the rank of
 a world power -- as she had not been since the days of Louis XIV and Na-  ..>;
 poleon I -- has three principal aspects:  in Western Europe, he wants a loose
 federation of governments under French hegemony (possibly with West Germany
 as a junior partner), eliminating U.S. Influence as much as possible; outside
 Europe, especially in Africa -- but now also extending into Asia and Latin
 America --, he wants, at the very least, to re-establish a French "presence"
 by means of active diplomacy (which includes offers of intervention in matters
 of little real concern to France, such as Cyprus), trade, some technical
 economie aid and especially cultural relations, utlizing for these purposes
 the far-flung net of former French colonies; finally, he wants to make him-
 self arbiter between East and West -- which he has started by recognizing Com-
 munist China, by proposing -neutralization" of Southeast Asia, arid, most re-
 cently, by rapidly improving France's relations with the Eastern European
 Communist regimes, at the moment focusing upon Rumania.
 The tenor of de Gaulle's press conference on 23 July 64 reflected his
 continuing determination to obstruct Western unification wherever it does not
 meet de Gaulle's terms and to undermine U.S. influence with friendly nations.
 There is every indication that his month-long Latin American tour, ambitious
 sequel to his more modest visit to Mexico last March, is designed to enhance
 French relations in the Western Hemisphere at the expense of US relations and
 policies as necessary.  De Gaulle's regime attempted to befriend leftist
 Brazilian President Goulart until he was overthrown, while Peronistas in
 Argentina are looking forward to the visit of the man with whom they share
 enmity against the U.S., a preference for "strong-man" rule and a common
 nostalgia for the policies and military tactics of the long-dead past.
 De Gaulle is pre-occupied with certain themes which he adapts to the
 situation or locale of the moment.  The unclassified attachment itemizes some
 of these recurring themes, along with pertinent rebuttals which de Gaulle has
 provoked from France's own allies.  It is particularly notable that the
 loudest expressions of distress over de Gaulle's actions have come not from
 the Communists of China, the Soviet Bloc, or France, but from France's Free
 World partners.  But US criticism in Latin America would be counterproductive.

 (813 Cont.)
 If it appears at all necessary to counter statements by de Gaulle or
 any high French official accompanying him (or comment made by officials or
 media of the host countries), such counter moves should follow these guide
 lines (and should not use any US comments):
 1.  Criticism should be based on Latin American or free world interests
 and views, but not as a defense of U.S. interests and policies.
 2.  Perso   Uv slighting attacks on de Gaulle or adverse criticism of
 France or of the French people as a, whole must be strictly avoided.
 3.  Critical analysis of de Gaulle's grand design and his resulting for-
 eign policy should emphasize that (i) France's human and material
 resources clot fulfill these over-ambitious plans, (ii) weakening
 of free-world unity and solidarity threatens the qgtional securit
 of every free country and tends to endanger world peace, (iii) his
 views on Comm=ism are utterly unrealistic ("neutralization" mans
 to leave the Communists in possession of the areas they rule, e.g.
 North Vietnam, while offering them a partnership in the areas they
 have not yet conquered, e.g. South Vietnam).
 If de Gaulle offers a host country economic advantages, media should at-
 tempt to                      in him (or his spokesmen) down to specific figures, times and con-
 ditions.                         Where applicable, those advantages might be compared with the host
 country's gross national product, total foreign trade, or with benefits under
 the Alliance for Progress.  Data on French expenses for her former colonies,
 especially on a per capita basis, might also be used in this context.  See in
 this context --

 1~+.      uoui Aggi~ession and the ?Jiv
 SITUATION:  The Chicom leaders, educated in the hard school of the Long
 March, the Yenan caves and the fierce struggle to take over China, place their
 confidence in violence and armed revolution as the most efficient and effective
 means of solving the problems of the world.  Without their "messianic" ambi-
 tion, their racial arrogance and their fanatical intolerance of any view their own, Mao and his colleagues would never have been able to survive, let
 alone seize power and exert control over all of mainland China.  These same
 characteristics have led them to arrogate to themselves the rights of sole
 arbiter not only of what is good for China but what is good for the entire
 world.  These same characteristics cause them also to make the same mistakes
 over and over and prevent their adapting their outmoded dogma to conditions
 and circumstances that exist in China and in the rest of the world today.
 The aggression against Tibet, Korea and India, the chaotic failure of
 the Great Leap Forward, the moralizing stridency and righteousness of their
 dogmatic position in the Sino-Soviet split are all evidence of Chicom deter-
 mination to mold the world into her own narrow image, by force if, where and
 as soon as they are able.  They have allied themselves with extremists every-
 where and have played on nationalistic differences and racial prejudices; they
 make their appeal to the dissatisfied and the disgruntled to bring disorder
 and chaos to established governments, especially those that need all of their
 resources for their own people's welfare and can ill afford and supported create large
 organizations to resist dissident elements encouraged g          pP   ea by the
 Chicams.
 In spite of clear Chicom behavior, beliefs and goals, many countries
 sponsor or support the CPR application for UN membership.        Some do so believ-
 ing that she can be dealt with more effectively there, by being forced to ad-
 here to UN principles, or simply that all nations should belong to the world
 organization.  Others, like de Gaulle, believe that nationalism will, of its
 own force, win over communism everywhere and, therefore, that the Chicoms
 should be treated as everyone else.  Still others, who participate in inter-
 national organizations and maintain various other types of relations with
 the CPR, either feel obligated to extend these relations into the UN or feel
 embarrassed or inconsistent in their actions if they refuse such admission.
 There are those, in addition, who truly want to see Chicom membership in the
 UN, for a variety of reasons which include failure to recognize any serious
 consequences from such membership or an assumption that they themselves will
 benefit from CPR admission (e.g. leftists or extreme nationalists in Afro-

 815 d.  Khrushchev's Cultural Destalinization
 SITUATION:  Khrushchev faces a difficult problem:  he needs to maintain
 the rule of the CPSU and its leadership, since this is the foundation of his
 power; on the other hand, he wishes to win popular support, to encourage
 initiative, and to rebut Chinese Communist demands for uncompromisingly re-
 volutionary policies.  He tries to answer the problem by exonerating the
 Party and himself, while blaming past terrorism on Stalin, and present stag-
 nation and factionalism on "survivals of the personality cult."  But the
 logic of anti-Stalinism leads the Soviet Union, and especially its intel-
 lectual avant garde, in directions which Khrushchev never intended.  In parti-
 cular, the conflict with Peking, and the consequent need to bid for support
 from revisionist elements abroad, handicaps the efforts of the CPSU to insist
 on intellectual orthodoxy at home.
 Khrushchev's aims differ sharply from those of the "liberal" writers and
 artists in Moscow and Leningrad.  Khrushchev has sanctioned pooms and novels
 which he thought would help to discredit Stalin.  The younger poets, novelists,
 and artists seek to extend the attack to condemn all efforts to dictate a
 rigid orthodoxy.  Leaving aside the old Stalinists, there is within the
 liberal camp itself a range of opinion about the degree to which artistic
 work should contribute to "Communist construction."  Tactical compromises are
 often made.  But in general, the liberals bring a continuous pressure for
 more freedom of expression and more freedom to travel.   They promptly seize
 on any apparent relaxation of party control for new publications and exhibi-
 tions.  After Khrushchev approved the publication of Aledsandr Solzhenitsyn's
 prison camp novel, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, editorial offices
 were (according to one of the Party's chief ideologists, L.F. Ilichev)
 flooded with "vile, anti-Soviet manuscripts."  ''then it was rumored that Khru-
 shchev had made a secret speech in the Central Committed calling for greater
 creative freedom (23 November 1962), Moscow's "underground artists" organized
 within one week a public exhibition of their paintings and sculptures.
 Knowing how Khrushchev would react to abstract art, conservative artists
 and bureaucrats saw to it that he visited this exhibition (they also probably
 helped arrange it, as provocation), and after making various unprintable re-
 marks, he "declared war" on the liberals.  (The remarks were printed in
 Encounter, April 1963.)  Conferences of writers, artists, and party leaders
 were held in December 1962 and March 1963, and a party plenum in June 1963
 repeated the customary calls for strict observance of the party line.  During
 this period sharp attacks were made against Ilya Ehrenburg,Viktor Nekrasov,
 Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Vasily Aksenov, and Andrey Voznesensky, and in July 1963
 the liberals lost control of the Moscow writer's organization.
 But after April 1963, there was on the whole a relaxation.  The leader-
 ship apparently became concerned over domestic fears of a return to Stalinism,
 and over hostile comment from abroad; the Italian Communist Party publicly
 dissociated itself from the Soviet hard line on 17 April.  The cultural aspect
 of the June plenum was eclipsed--and probably influenced by--the open eruption
 of the Sino-Soviet controversy.  During the past year, liberal writers have

 published (August 1963) Aleksandr Tvardovsky's anti-Stalin poem,
 'Vasily Terkin in Paradise," and the conservative magazine Oktyabr  October)
 objected violently, Izvestiya ruled that the conservative criticisms were
 "unacceptable."  Now the conservative writers are writing stories about loyal
 party men who maintain their party spirit despite imprisonment, or who suffer
 anguish over the terrible orders they must carry out.
 It still is easy for reactionary officials to punish or harass those
 whom they think remiss in party spirit.  The case of Josef Brodsky shows what
 can happen to a young poet.  (See attachment:  since attachment was written,
 Victor Zorza has reported that Brodsky has been released, but on what condi-
 tions is not yet known.)  In Poland, once considered relatively permissive,
 the regime has acted against the liberals by tightening press censorship, and
 by restricting paper supplies.  34 leading Polish intellectuals signed a
 letter of protest which received publicity in the west, and the regime re-
 taliated against the signers by suspending their passports and stopping the
 publication of their work.
 The Polish government has since withdrawn most of its punitive measures
 as a result of the public protest, including that abroad.  As in the Soviet
 case in 1963, the opinion of foreign intellectuals seems to have effect.  And
 even if foreign intellectuals could be ignored, the Soviets and their friends
 must respond to Chicom attacks.  On 11 July, Lituraturnaya Gazeta, not ordi-
 narily liberal, defended. Yevtushenko, Voznesensky, and Yevtushenko's ex-wife,
 Bella Akhmadulina, against Chinese charges of revisionism and, in answer to
 Chinese mockery of the Soviets for only criticizing erring writers, the Soviet
 Journal answered:  "tidhat else would you want, to arrest them?"  Domestically,
 as in an article in Kommunist #10, the CPSU has tended lately to take an
 "above the struggle" stance, and this kind of position is certain to be ex-
 ploited by the intellectuals.

 816 tqH,g.  Juanita Castro's Defection
 LIF-or more complete background information see unclassified attachment:
 Juanita Castro Chooses Freedom and its Spanish version Juanita Castro escoge
 la libertad.  Either of these may be passed to indigenous assets, but with
 the caution that they are to be used for the facts contained in them and
 n o t  reproduced verbatim.  Forwarded also is a zerox copy of her statement
 as it appeared in Excelsior, Mexico City, 30 June, along with an English trans-
 lation.  See Press Comment for further background or for any future develop-
 ments
 SITUATION:  FYI Only.  It is fairly evident, from the volume of the
 news stories and the tenor of the editorial comment, that Juanita Castro's
 defection has had a notable impact upon world opinion.  Speaking as she did
 some three weeks before the Washington meeting of foreign ministers of the
 OAS, it was natural for her to make a special appeal for OAS action against
 Cuba, whether or not this actually influenced any votes.  In any event, the
 strong wording of the resolution and the 15 to 4 decision was certainly better
 than most anti-Castro observers had hoped for.  Also, just how far her action
 will go in weakening the internal fabric of the Castro regime time alone will
 tell.  All in all, her move is an important and favorable development in the
 cold war against Castro.
 As this is being written, it has been learned that Tuanita has sold ex-
 clusive rights to her story to Life magazine.  Since Life en espanol is
 second in circulation only to Selecciones del Readers Ages t in Latin
 America, this will serve to keep the subject in the public conscience of
 that region for some time to come.
 Some time during the month of August, Juanita will probably proceed to
 Brazil, where she has a number of devoted and very influential friends.  Her
 arrival there will undoubtedly be the occasion of additional interviews and
 feature stories.  She received her asylum papers from the Mexican. government
 on 30 July.  In order to be able to re-enter Mexico after her trip to Brazil,
 she will have to make a formal request for a re-entry permit.  Thus, it is
 not known where she will make her permanent residence.  While in Mexico she
 will be inhibited -- unofficially, by the government -- from making further
 critical remarks about Cuba.
 From the point of view of U.S. interest, perhaps the only unfavorable
 development in the whole affair was the allegation in a number of papers
 -- generally not included in Press Comment -- that Juanita had been secretly
 working for the CIA for years.  The most important of these appeared In the
 Nev York Herald Tribune, 3 July 1961, over the by-line of Barnard L. Collier.
 The writer did not identify his sources but claimed that the information was
 confirmed by highly placed intelligence sources in Washington.  See below
 for treatment of this aspect of the case.  End FYI Only.

 ,ion:  First Trots  ite Ent   Into Coalition Government
 817. Cgy
 SITUATION:    For the first time in history, a non-Communist nation has
 included a Trotskyite party in its government.  Ceylon, since its independ-
 ence (1947) racked by communal strife between Sinhalese and Tamils, beset
 by eco_._nomicc difficulties and ruled since 1956 by a vacillating, though .auto-
 cMtic, leftist and neutralist leadership, has now "broadened its base of
 government by forming a coalition, in a desperate attempt to overcome eco-
 nomic and communal strife as well as reckless Marxist opposition.
 Communists, whether orthodox or "deviationists" (such as Trotskyites,
 Titoists, etc.),  n e v e r  treat non-communist "allies" gs  e a u a 1B
 -- due to their doctrinary insistence that the future belongs to the workers
 and peasants, that only one party can represent one class: and hint they are
 that one party, thus entitled to monopoly rule.  however disguised for
 tactical reasons, Communists apply this basic strategy in all united front
 combinations, whether in or out of government.  This was originally demon-
 strated by the first Popular Fronts in the thirties, in France and Spain.
 It is now being exercised in Indonesia, where the Communists -- though not
 formally in the government -- increasingly dominate Sukarno's regime, in
 Cuba -- where Castro's non-Communist supporters were gradually elicit cted --
 and in quite a few other instances.
 Even though the government of Ceylon (where the non-Communists are
 faced with an orthodox CP, now  s p 1 i t  into Moscow and Peking factions,
 as well as with a Trotskyite Party) would appear to have a better than even
 chance to keep its dangerous partners in bounds, it remains very much to be
 seen whether Mrs. Bandaranalke, despite her anti-imperialism, anti-Western-
 ism and neutralism, will be realistic and farsighted enough to keep the Com-
 munist factions disunited and to strengthen her mass support from non-Com-
 munist labor and other groups.

 August 1964
 The U.S. Versus Free Europe
 At his 23 July press confer ice de Gaulle resumed his self-appointed
 role as prophet and spokesman for Europe, and recited his favorite non
 sequitur - "the division of the world into two camps led respectively by
 Washington and Moscow no longer corresponds to the new situation," there-
 fore, the interests of Free Europe and the U.S. are in conflict.  While
 de Gaulle has never explained the why and how of this vaTua assertion,
 he has been using it ever more insistently to confront Free World govern-
 ments with an alleged necessity to choose between French and American
 policies. In the face of America's post-war rehabilitation of i',rrope,
 de Gaulle presents the U.S. as economically predatory, politically domi-
 neering, and militarily unreliable as a partner.
 Whereas de Gaulle's reasonings are obscure, his intent to regain
 the glory that was France and raise her to an eminent position as a world
 power is clear.  The flood of reactions by his European allies to his
 latest pronouncements are likewise clear and somewi.;t more to the point.
 Belgium.  An article in Brussels' Le Soir criticized de Gaulle for,
 "in a sense refusing to accept the world as it is. - - - ?trance cannot
 again become a world pivot by simple affirmation of its gr  deur."    he
 French term "grandeur" means greatness as well as splendor    The article
 added that the Gaullist concept suffers from "internal contradictions":
 unwillingness to accept the "supremacy of two 'great powers' because
 France is not one of them," and French inability to "oppose power consti-
 tuted by two great confederations of people which axe the U.S. and USSR
 with an equivalent force because it can be obtained only throe n a feder-
 ation of European nations which would dissolve some of the Frencsh father-
 land's prerogatives which he (de Gaulle) does not intend to renounce at
 any price."  The article concludes that the "European Europe" which de
 Gaulle pleads for would already exist if it were not for his opposition.
 -A front page editorial in Brussels' Libre BeMiaue condemned the Gaullist
 concepts as "short-sighted" and asked,  'who follows de Gaulle?"  The French
 nuclear force concept was derided as a "design resulting from de Gaulle's
 pride," and it was charged that nuclear force in the hands of such a
 "middle-class power" as France is a grave peril to world security and is
 bound to enhance the proliferation of nuclear weapons.  The editorial con-
 cluded that the world asks more than that of France.
 Under a headline, "The Dramatic Isolation of France," Brussels' So-
 cialist Vooruit noted that after the Americans had twice saved Europe,
 "de Gaulle pretends that they would not do so a third time."  Tice Vooruit
 article went on to say that not only had de Gaulle faced 900 journalists
 an old and solitary man, but that France is also alone, having lost marry
 Free World friends, and is in the process of alienating the youngest, West
 Germany.

 Brussels' Catholic Labor newspaper Het Volk accused de Gaulle of
 seeking French CoiaLrmist support by pu ating spokes  in the wheels of NATO
 and Western unity.   The paper suggested that French recognition of Commu-
 nist China permitted de Gaulle to escape Communist propaganda in Africa,
 and that his attacks on the U.S. are used to advantage with the French
 Communists.  He, t Volk had "the impression that de Gaulle desires to play
 the role versus America that Tito plays versus the USSR."
 West Germany.  The irritated reaction of the West German government
 to de Gaulle's 23 July press conference was an immediate news release at-
 tributed to "highest Goverment circles in Bonn," and widely reported in
 the 24+ July press.  De Gaulle's pointed attack on the Federal Republic
 was described as unexpected and troubling after the positions taken by
 de Gaulle during his visit to West Germany just previously. Bonn considered
 that the views expressed by de Gaulle could only be interpreted as a demand
 for the Federal Republic (FRG) to choose between American and French poli-
 cies and leadership.  Bonn could not understand this in view of the French
 knowledge that there is no real choice in the matter for Germany.  Accord-
 ing to the press release, the FRG considers an integrated defense and a
 close alliance with the U.S. essential: de Gaulle's "characterization of
 the close relationship of Europe and the U.S. in NATO as one of 'subordi-
 nation' to the U.S. is rejected by the FRG." Bonn regretted that de Gaulle
 failed in his press conference to define what he conceives to be   a "Euro-
 pean Europe" with its own independent policy.  If the FRG was resisting a
 disintegration of NATO and the concomitant reduction of its defensive
 power, this was held to be precisely in order to enable Europe - insofar
 as possible all of Free Europe - to become a genuine partner of the U.S.
 Concerning de Gaulle's expression of disappointment over cooperation, up
 to now, under the Franco-German treaty, Bonn regretted that the French
 President evaluated the results already achieved so negatively - "In the
 German view there is no basis for this."
 FRG Press Office spokesman Von Hase issued an additional statement
 pointing out that "German policy is dependent neither on the U.S. nor
 France.  It was added that a "joint policy of two gover.': nts cry not mean
 that one government adopts all the viewpoints of the           1,111.1o FRG too
 expressed regret that the Franco-German treaty had not ye.t led to an accord
 of viewpoints of the two governments on important questioizs, such as the
 Allied Multilateral Force (MGF).  It was noted, however, that the FRG had
 made quite clear upon signing the treaty that it wished to participate in
 the MLF.  France, which had indicated its intention not to do so, had re-
 peatedly declared that it understood the German position.
 Foreign Minister Schroeder said in a Cologne speech, "We did not
 enter into the Franco-German treaty in order to take over French policy."
 Lastly, the daily Frankfurter A    mein saw a "dangerous inconsist-
 ency" between de Gaulle's statement that Europe is an entity and his re-
 jection of European political integration.  "We believe that before pur-
 suing a joint policy Europe has to be united - - - "

 Itm&.  De Gaul's press conference singling out of Italy, which
 considers itself the most pro-European of the "Six," as obstructor of
 European unity, served to whip up the strongest anti-de Gaulle reaction
 in the Government and press since de Gaulle blackballed entry of the U.K.
 into the European Economic Community (EEC).  While the Foreign Ministry
 press release was comparatively restrained, the press itself was not.
 Christian Democratic 13. Popolo charged that the Gaullist grand design
 was "Born in an atmosphere of daydreams of grandeur, foreign to the true
 interests of Europe, the West, and the French people themselves.
 Socialist daily Av nti editorialized that Italy, Belgium, and Erhard's
 Germany "are not at all disposed to submit to de Gaulle's blackmail, and
 as for Italy - since the General wished to single her out as responisble
 for the failure of a 'Europe of Fatherlands' - it would be well to repeat
 that such a Europe is not for us."
 An 4genzip DemoGr atica communique universally ascribed to Social
 Democratic Foreign Minister Saragat took indignant issue with de Gaulle's
 call for Europe to liberate itself from American hegemony.  "What hegem-
 ony and what Europe?  The hundred millions of Europeans in satellites
 who must endure governments propped up by foreign armies?  The 20 mil-
 lion Germans separated by threat of 20 enemy divisions - one for every
 million inhabitants - from the mother country?  Countries like Italy,
 Great Britain, West Germany and France itself which owe their survival
 as free nations on extreme western edge of immense Eurasian continent to
 the Atlantic Alliance?  Would it be this Europe which ought to liberate
 itself from American hegemony?  One can well understand the irritation
 of the German Government and the amazement of other European governments,
 which are asking themselves in what dream world Frt-unce exercises its
 foreign policy ....  If the EEC should fail, and the Atlantic Alliance
 disintegrate, there would be only one alternative: neutralism, fore-
 runner of disaster for Italy and for everyone."
 France.  Even the French press conceded the negative foreign re-
 ception of de Gaulle's press coL:forence.  The Director of Paris' Lem
 commented editorially that Fran a is not responsible for all difficulties
 in uniting Europe, but "It remains true that Gaullist nationalism offers
 all others a precedent and a sort of justification."  He added that de
 Gaulle had clearly signalled to France's partners'that a "European policy"
 had to be a French policy.  "By this fact he paralyzes effort, whose
 necessity he proclaims, and throws our neighbors still more on the Anglo-
 Saxons, whom he wishes so much to keep at a distance."
 The Paris F_igaro commented that whatever is happening in the U.S.
 and USSR, it was doubtful that European, states, themselves in disarray,
 would willingly rally to a France, "whose language they considered too
 rude, whose manners undiplomatic and whose ambitions quite disturbing."

 Chatleri   L1.S. Relri.abil{tar
 In exhorting Western nations to look to France instead of America
 for leadership, de Gaulle has repeatedly tried to raise doubts on Ameri-
 can integrity by suggesting that good intentions of the present U.S. gov-
 ernment would not be bind.ng on future administrations.
 This is a weak and unbecoming argument in the face of the U.S. Gov-
 ernment's recent demonstration of its capacity for smooth leadership
 succession and policy continuity.  It is even weaker in the face of the
 Prospects that France, after de Gaulle, would be in poor shape indeed to
 be an effective partner, much less a leader.
 The "Anax1o-Saxon Menace"
 To justify his disruption of Western unity, de Gaulle says that the
 Western Alliance is "unhealt;ly," and "satisfies only the Anglo-Saxons."
 Not since the 19th Century doctrine of Manifest Destiny have Anglo-Saxons
 been heard of politically, except from de Gaulle.  This anachronistic
 mental reversion reveals him exercising French foreign policy in terms of
 issues long dead and forgotten by the rest of mankind.
 Erance:  Whose Ally?
 Whereas de Gaulle professes opposition to Communism, his actions
 have consistently given aid and comfort to the Cozmnunists.  The worst, of
 course, was his diplomatic recognition of Communist China.   Like the So-
 viet Union, de Gaulle has refused to support UN peacekeeping operations,
 financially or otherwise.  It is universally recognized that his suggested
 neutralization of Southeast Asia" would leave the area open to Chicom
 takeover.  He insinuated France back into the Vietnamese picture by talk-
 ing of the four major powers concerned with "the past an. present fate of
 Vietnam."  However, it is questionable that his proposal for massive out-
 side aid to "Indochina as a whole" is more than talk so far as France is
 concerned. Any increase in France's current aid program there would im-
 pose strains on the French budget which de Gaulle could relieve only by
 cutting French commitments elsewhere, such as in Latin America.

 Chicoms Advocate Violence and War
 The Chinese Communist leaders see their policy problems and their
 own role in world affairs in the light of their own past experience.
 Their view is dominantly colored by their lengthy existence as outlaws
 in the Yenan caves followed by the fierce guerrilla war against the forces
 of Chiang Kai-shek. During all this time, Stalin (who was then considered
 infallible in the Communist world) advised Mao to bide his. time and enter
 a united front with Chiang's Kuomintang.  With the exception of his collab-
 oration with the government for the sole purpose of fighting the Japanese
 in WW II, Mao ignored Stalin's advice.  Both before and after that war,
 he plunged China into a savage civil war that ended in the Communist sei-
 zure of power and the destruction of any elements in Chinese society that
 did not support the Communist program.  In the light of this experience it
 comes as no surprise that Mao and his colleagues place their entire confi-
 dence in violence as the most efficient and effective means of solving
 problems and that they recommend this means to others.  (Nor is it surpris-
 ing that Mao and Company are in no mood to listen to the advice of the So-
 viet comrades -oar of anyone else for that matter--regarding the solution
 of the world's problems today.)
 On a great number of occasions the Chicom leaders have expressed their
 preference and support for violence.  In 1936 in his "Strategic Problems of
 China's Revolutionary War," Mao called war "the highest form of struggle."
 He also said:
 "The (Chinese) Communist Party has led and continues to
 lead the stupendous, sublime, glorious, and victorious revolu-.
 tionary war.  This war is not only the banner of China's lib-
 eration, but it is also pregnant with significance for world
 revo lutiou."      (Emphasis added.)
 In his "Problems of War and Strategy," Mao said:
 "Experience in the class struggle of the era of imperi-
 alism teaches us that the working class and the toiling
 masses cannot defeat the armed bourgeois and landlords ex-
 cept by the power of the gun."
 Mao' s'report?to:the November 1938 plenum of the Chinese Communist
 Central Committee plenary session, in which he made his famous observation
 that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun, was also quite ex-
 plicit regarding his views of revolution and war.  He said:
 Some people have ridiculed us as advocates of the 'omni-
 potence of war.'  Yes, we are the advocates of the omnipotence
 of revolutionary war, which is not bad at all, but is good and
 is Marxist."

 Mao leaves no doubt that his views on the subject are the same to-
 day as they were in those ear  er times.  On 3 August 1963, the New China
 News Agency reported that Mao said "The people who have triumphed in
 their revolution should help the struggle of those who are still strug-
 gling for liberation."
 Fifteen Years of Violence:  Not only have the Chicoms on may occa-
 sions stated their views on the subject, they have demonstrated those
 views by their actions.  In the relatively brief 15 years in power they
 have vi rious y subjugated the Tibetan people, they have made a mockery of
 the U.N. Charter and the members of the U.N. by their aggressive attacks
 against U.N. forces in Korea, and they have wantonly attacked India in
 spite of India's earlier role as Communist China's chief apologist.  Com-
 munist China's refusal to sign the nuclear test-ban treaty was the final
 straw for many people and nations who had earlier hoped to bring her closer
 to the rest of the world.
 In addition to aggressive attacks on her neighbors (not to mention the
 countless occasions when the Chicoms subjected their own people to terror
 and deprivation), Communist China openly advertises herself as the sup-
 porter of violence and insurrection everywhere in the world.  On 4 March
 1964, the principal Chicom newspaper PEOPLE'S DAILY carried an editorial
 on South Vietnam which applauded the Viet Cong for having "exposed" the
 United States as a paper tiger.  (See Pro    n~ d  Notes Series A, #51,
 march 24, 1964.)  The editorial said t
 "the people of a a y country or region subjected to U.S.
 aggression can win victory if only they are not overawed by
 its (U.S.) apparent strength and dare and know how to struggle.
 So, in this sense, the victories won by the South Vietnamese
 people have u n i v e r s a l significance."
 The editorial also in effect calls on the peoples of Asia, Africa
 and Latin America to rise in armed insurrection against "the imperialist
 aggressors"--a misnomer they apply in an attempt to denigrate the free
 world..  It adds that in doing so they will not only be winning their own
 battle, they will at the same time "assist the South Vietnamese people by
 harassing U.S. imperialism everywhere and thus preventing it from throwing
 its entire strength against the South Vietnamese people."
 In case air more explicit proof of Chicom support for the Communist
 Viet Cong insurrection in South Vietnam were required, that proof was pro-
 vided by the Chicom delegate to the 15 February 1964 Budapest World Students
 Conference, Chien Ta-wei, who said that the South Vietnamese people had no
 choice but "armed struggle," which he declared to be "the most reliable roast
 for the oppressed nations to win complete liberation."  Chien called for
 extensive mass activities and propaganda in support of the Viet Cong as well
 as "substantial political and material help, including w e a p o n s."
 Guerrilla Training for Latin Americans:  It was reported in July 1960
 that a special school had been set up in Peking for "the training of Latin
 American Communists in the art of subversion" and that the curriculum in-
 cluded training in organizing labor movements, education for and direction
 of the anti-imperialist struggle and guerrilla warfare."  In June 1963

 five Ecuadorans were arrested at Quito Airport as they returned from a
 trip abroad.  They hac,_ been in couta,ct vith C:'lieoms while abroad and in-
 structions for carrying out subversive activities were discovered in the
 luggage of two of the arrested persons.  In November 1963 there was a sim-
 ilar report from Peru.  Six members of the Movimento de la Izquierda Revo-
 lucionaria (MfR) left in October enroute to China, for guerrilla warfare
 training.  There are rumors that the NIR plans to send as many as 50 mem-
 bers in small groups on a similar mission.
 Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Spirit:  The Chinese Communists,
 like all other Communists, have from time to time found it expedient to mask
 their basically violent views and to pose as advocates of conciliation and
 peaceful coexistence.  In the mid-1950's the Chicoms sought to expand their
 influence among the Asian nations and the newly developing countries that
 made up the majority of the so-called neutralist bloc.  At the Bandung Con-
 ference of Afro-Asian nations in April 1955 the Chicoms played a prominent
 role in creating the "spirit of Bandung" and in publicizing the five princi-
 ples adopted at the conference:  (1)  Mutual respect for territorial integ-
 rity and sovereignty; (2) mutual non-aggression; (3) mutual non-interference
 in internal affairs; (4+) equality and mutual benefit; and (5) peaceful co-
 existence.  The Chieoms pose as the arch-advocate of peaceful coexistence
 so long as it serves their purposes, but the pose has become increasingly
 hard to maintain particularly since the wanton Chicom attacks against India
 in violation of every one of the vaunted Five Principles of Peaceful Coex-
 istence.  In spite of their blatant violations of the "Bandung spirit" all
 around the world, there are many people who still are vulnerable to Chicom,
 exploitation on this point.  Chou En-lai, for example, on his latest trip to
 Africa succeeded in convincing many people, some in influential positions
 that the Chicoms desire only to be left alone to develop their own country
 and to help other countries who need. Chicom help.  Those who are inclined
 to accept this description of Communist China's aims and aspirations should
 take the trouble to acquaint themselves with the long-standing (and openly
 stated) views of the Chicoms.

 August 1964
 STATUS OF THE SOVIET INS. hMLECTUAL FRONT, 1964
 The meetings of Khrushchev and other party leaders with writers and
 artists in December 1962 and March 1963 seemed to foreshadow serious repres-
 sion; Leonid lichev condemned formalism and reaffirmed the principles of
 "socialist realism," while Nikita Khrushchev roundly denounced modernism in
 all the arts, attacked several writers and artists by name, and made it clear
 that all intellectuals would be expected to conform to the lines prescribed
 by the CPSU.  A Central Committee plenum was scheduled for may 1963, with
 ideology as the subject matter, and the press discussed various measures,such
 as eliminating small newspapers and magazines and forming a single (conserva-
 tive-dominated) cultural union, which` would effectively curb the liberal ele-
 ments.                 Yet the plenum was delayed a{month, and when it met it failed to take
 any drastic action; even though Ilichev himself endorsed the single union con-
 cept, it was. not imposed by the plenum.  Perhaps the incapacitating illness
 of a prominent conservative, Frol Kozlov, caused a change in course, perhaps
 the reaction from the West influenced the party leadership.  Certainly Soviet
 leaders were preoccupied with the rivalry with the Chinese Communists, which
 came to a full boil just before the plenum when the Chinese published an open
 letter to the CPSU.  And certainly it became clear that the younger intel-
 lectuals were not impressed by mere slogans, while Khrushchev was not really
 ready for more drastic action, such as Stalin and Zhdanov would have taken.
 Liberals Not Routed
 In July 1963, the liberals did lose control of the Moscow writers' union.
 But many of them kept their editorial positions, and their writing continued
 to appear.  That summer, Not Mir (New World) published a new Aleksandr
 Solzhenitsyn story, For the Good of the Cause, which showed that what was
 "the cause" in the eyes of the officials was not the same thing as "the cause"
 embraced by the people.  On August 18, 1963, Izvestiya ran a poem by Aleksandr
 Tvardovsky, entitled "Vasily Terkin in the Netherworid"; the fact that this
 was preceded by an introduction by Aleksey Adzhubey inpiied that Khrushchev
 himself approved the publication.  When the conservative magazine Oktyabr got
 into a controversy with the liberal Novr vy Mir over the propriety of Tvardovsky's
 attacks on Stalinism in "Vasily Terkin,  Izvestiya ruled that the conservative
 complaints were "unacceptable."  Viktor Nekrasov, whose reports on Italy and
 the United States had caused Khrushchev to demand his expulsion from the party,
 was back in print (in Novy Mir) in December 1963.
 A long public debate took place as to who should be given the 1964 Lenin
 Prize for literature.  Liberals wished to award the prize to Solzhenitsyh for
 his One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, which was abhorrent to the con-
 servatives:  the latter focussed their criticism on the character of
 Solzhenitsyn's hero, Ivan Denisovich Shukhov.  One critic even indicated that
 Shukhov should have attacked the guards of his camp, as a Mikhail Sholokhov
 character had done against the Nazis in a German POW camp.  A liberal critic,
 on the other hand (N. Gubko in Zvezda (Star), February 1963), had already
 argued that One Day showed "the terrifying corrupting force of uncontrolled
 power which demoralizes and corrupts people," and called on Soviet writers
 to lead their country out of the mire, stating:  "the immediate perpetrators
 of all this and their executors lost all semblance of morality and humanity."
 Considering the implications of Gubko's remarks, it was somewhat surprising

 sprof 1961 he was still on Zvezda's editorial board
 and still defending One Ds ; he now demanded recognition f of e~rez?~' Sdi? 3,ua1 y               gnition of the moral re-
 of the events of the Stalin period, and
 he condemned "the. moral corruption of people in whom uncontrolled power over
 others has exterminated everything civic, everything human."  Despite liberal
 argument, however, the Lenin Prize went to A. G. Gonchar for Tronka, a sac-
 charine portrayal of collective and state-farm life; even the conservatives
 had not taken it seriously.
 The Conservatives on the Bandwagon
 Other novels on the Stalin period include Konstantin Simonov's Soldiers
 Are Not Born, describing an officer who, after arrest in the 1937 purges, is
 released to fight in the war, and who finally, after meeting Stalin personally,
 suddenly realizes that Stalin was fully aware of the nature of the purges, and
 Yuriy Gert's Who if Not You, on the disillusionment of young Komsomol members
 who, after fervent belief in Stalin, find out about the real world.  Because
 of Khrushchev's political interest in denigrating Stalin's memory, such books
 as this are not now very daring.  Indeed, conservative writers are climbing
 on the bandwagon; they Join in showing--less graphically than Solzhenitsyn
 did--the suffering of the period of the cult, but their heroes are loyal party
 men who never lose faith in the ideals of Lenin, and who inspire their fellow
 prisoners with their own party spirit.  A classic story by the conservative
 leader Vsevolod Kochetov recently appeared in Okt abr, showing the prolonged
 sufferings of a lieutenant who, during the Civil War period, made "excessive
 demands" on the peasants; this "victim" is arrested, nearly condemned to
 death, reprieved because he thought he had acted for the good of the state,
 rearrested in 1937, and released when the war begins.  As if to show skeptics
 that some officers actually were released when the war began, the memoirs of
 General Aleksandr Gorbatov appeared in print this spring; Gorbatov described
 his arrest in 1938, claimed that he refused to testify falsely under torture,
 described Arctic gold-mining conditions resembling those undergone by Ivan
 Denisovich, and concluded with an account of his release, thanks to the inter-
 cession of Marshal Budenny.  This developing le gend of party courage in the
 camps might be described as the domestication of Denisovich.  An arrest under
 Stalin is now almost a status symbol:  a sto   was recently told in p on ok
 (Little Light) (the Soviet equivalent of Life that Stalin's agents were pre-
 paring to kill Mikhail Sholokhov, the Grand Old Man of Soviet official liter-
 ature, and that his life was probably saved by a friendly Cossack who knocked
 on Sholokhov's door one night and advised him to hide.  Needless to say,
 Stalin's agents could easily have caught Sholokhov if they had really wanted
 to do so.
 Continued Pressure by Writers
 Some writers do keep pushing, however, against the limits of what is
 permitted.  A. Ya. Kucherov recently wrote a novella, "Once in a Lifetime,"
 (in Zvezda, X12, 1963), in which he painted an unattractive picture of con-
 temporary Soviet society, still riddled with the fears and hypocrisy of the
 cult years. In August 1964, a new Solzhenitsyn story described a Siberian
 village whose inhabitants receive as gifts the dogs from a disbanded mining
 camp.  When the villagers parade on a holiday, the dogs remember their train-
 cg and surround the people, snarling and baring their. teeth. Fortunately a

 ing the prison compound and the clogs stepped saerling.  The story can be read
 as a parable on the survival of Stalinism in Soviet society.  The conflict
 of generations is a sensitive subject; Khrushchev violently denied the ex-
 istence of such a conflict in his speech to the writers on March 8, 1962,
 while his very remarks showed the gulf between himself and the younger Soviet
 public.  The problem of the generations was raised in Aleksandr Shteyn's play,
 "Between the Cloudbursts," (Teatr #4), based on the Kronstadt Rebellion of
 March 1921.  Instead of following the conventional Soviet treatment, which
 blames the Revolt on counter-revolutionaries and foreign imperialists, who
 are supposed to have exploited the political backwardness of young sailors
 Shteyn (like most western scholars) analyzes the Rebellion as one of disil-
 lusion.  He opposes a bureaucratic father, Commissar Pozdnyshev, to his son,
 Ivan, who joins the rebels and who accuses his father of belonging to a
 "Commissarocracy" which has "betrayed the ideas" of the Revolution.  Instead
 of exhorting the masses, as is usual in Soviet mythology, Lenin is seen as
 following the story of the Revolt in French newspapers, and as deciding to
 switch from war communism to the New Economic Policy.  Shteyn's play appeared
 in print in April 1964, but Pravda sharply attacked him for his many "errors,"
 and he has been told that the play cannot be staged unless it is re-written.
 Shteyn's memoirs have also been appearing this spring; in one place,
 Shteyn describes the 1949 arrest and post-Stalin release of a novelist friend,
 S. A. Zonin.  Zonin was unable to return to his old life, and soon died.  A
 more important victim of Stalin was Isaac Babel, whom western critics consider
 to have been the greatest of the post-revolutionary prose writers.  He ceased
 to publish in the 1930's, though he continued to write, and he was arrested
 and executed in 1939.  Now Babel's letters and unpublished writings of the
 '30's have been collected in an English translation by Andrew R. MacAndrew
 and Max Hayward, Isaac Babel:  The Lonely Years, 1925-1939.  The Soviet maga-
 zine, Moskva, is preparing to publish the memoirs of the writer Lev Nikulin,
 Years of Our Life, and this will also include correspondence with Babel and
 other figures of the 1920's and '30's.
 Repression Continues
 Even now, people are sent to prison camps for non-criminal reasons:  on
 July 21, 1964, Literaturnaya Gazeta (Literary Gazette) disclosed that members
 of a sect, the True Orthodox Wandering Christians, had been sent to Siberia
 for forced labor.  The case of Josef Brodsky, arrested and sentenced as part
 of a campaign against "parasitism," shows that those who do not have estab-
 lished reputations and especially those who are Jewish are still very vulner-
 able to the whims of party bigots.  In May, employees of two Moscow book-
 stores were arrested on charges of selling "pornographic literature"; it
 seems that much of this was actually Western or unauthorized Soviet writing.
 Even better known figures, like Andrei Voznesensky and Viktor Nekrasov, were
 banished to factories and construction sites for a time in 1963, though they
 have now been permitted to return to Moscow.  It is now reported that Olga
 Ivinskaya, the model for Boris Pasternak's character Lara in Dr. Zhivago, is
 seriously ill and becoming blind in a prison camp 300 miles east of Moscow.
 Arrested in 1960 after Pasternak's death, she received an eight year sentence
 on a manufactured charge of currency speculation, and she still remains in
 jail, despite personal pleas from Nehru, Bertrand Russell, and Eleanor
 Roosevelt.  If not released and given proper medical care, she will probably
 not survive much longer.

 Vested Interests
 Cultural conservatism is backed by powerful vested interests.  For
 example, on February 7, 1964, Marshal Malinovsky spoke to a group of writers
 and artists, and denounced recent "incorrect trends" in the description of
 war:  the'bortrayal of little, lost people in naturalistic detail," unflat-
 tering descriptions of the army in peacetime, and works which undermine the
 authority of commanders (as in the description of a Soviet officer evading
 identification by the Germans by putting on a private's tunic).  Like the
 Nazis, Malinovsky has little use for the work of Erich Maria Remarque:  "We
 have no right mechanically to transfer Remarque's ideas into our creative art
 and to deprive it of the real and true heroism natural to our life."  No doubt
 many people, such as the ex-KGB man who masterminded Brodsky's arrest, would
 like to put a stop to all the talk about the camps and the executions.
 Myth and Reality
 The strategy of the top leadership is to use the writers and artists to
 sweep away loyalty to Stalin, and at the same time to try to make them propa-
 gandists for the present Soviet system.  Instead of rigid controls, the party
 seeks both to spur and to placate the intellectuals.  It wants to warn them,
 but it doesn't want to lose contact with them.  Early in June, the CPSU Cen-
 tral Committee's Ideological Commission held an expanded meeting with various
 of the tamer writers, composers, and artists.   It was agreed that tremendous
 progress had been made since the December 1962 and March 1963 meetings, and
 that:
 "in the past year Soviet literature and art has taken a new stride for-
 ward in the artistic embodiment of the labor exploits and the spiritual
 world of the builders of Communism...the Soviet writers and artists,
 having repudiated esthetic views alien to us, have rallied even more
 firmly around the positions of socialist realism, whose fruitfulness
 has been proved by life itself."
 This picture of the situation' scarcely reflects the facts.  Despite all
 the sermons of 1963, there were no full-dress recantations, only a half dozen
 vague promises to do better. Shteyn still wrote his Kronstadt drama, and
 Viktor Rozov has had a play ("On the Wedding Day") approved for production
 in which a young girl says:  "They cannot understand at all that their age
 is past and another is coming...." and "The old people will die off and we'll
 get our way."  The central character in a recent novel by Vasily Aksenov
 (It's Time, Friend,It's Time), Valentin Marvich, openly expresses his anger
 over the deprivation of independence and the work under orders which Soviet
 artists and writers suffer.  In mid-June, a controversial artist, Ilya
 Glazunov, held a show at Moscow's Manezh Gallery.  The conservatives first
 tried to prevent the exhibition; nevertheless, it was approved personally
 by Aleksandr N. Kuznetsov, First Deputy Minister of Culture.  To settle the
 controversy, after the exhibition had been seen by enthusiastic crowds, a
 private viewing and discussion was arranged for Kuznetsov and the conserva-
 tives.  But a large number of young people staged a "sit-in" and demanded a
 chance to take part in the debate and an extension of the exhibition, which
 had been scheduled to close.  The youth of the USSR will not be poured back
 into the old molds.

 THE CASE OF JOSEPH BRODSKY
 Russian Writers Prot st Mainst a Gr ve Miscarriage of Justice
 By Victor Frank
 On March 13 last, Joseph Brodsky, 24+, a Russian poet and translator
 of unusual promise, was sentenced by a Leningrad court to five years' de-
 portation with hard labor on the somewhat odd charge "of earning too
 little money."  The verdict said literally:  "Isolated instances of earn-
 ings made by Brodsky do not indicate that he fulfilled one of the most
 important duties laid down in the constitution, the duty to toil honestly
 for the benefit of the country and for one's own well-being."  The young
 man, who suffers from a chronic nervous disability, and who has been
 under treatment for several years, is now reported to be living on a
 state farm iii the remote province of Archangel where he is employed as
 a driver carting manure to the fields.
 Joseph Brodsky's trial may yet become a cause celhbre in modern
 Russia not because of the nature of the charge brought against him, but
 because he has been courageously defended by some of the most famous per-
 sonalities in Russian arts and letters.  The greatest living poet, the
 76 year-old Mrs. Anna Aklunatova; the translator of Shakespeare's "Sonnets"
 and of Burns' poems, Samuel Marshak; the immensely popular author of
 children's books, Korney Chukovsky; and the composer Dmitri Shostakovich -
 were all prepared to vouch for the innocence of Joseph Brodsky, whom they
 consider an outstanding poet and translator.  After their efforts to pre-
 vent a blatant miscarriage of justice had failed, they appealed directly
 to the Central. Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and
 to the Union of Soviet Writers.  The text of their petition has become
 known abroad.  It is a remarkable document on two counts; first, it re-
 veals what can and still does happen in Mr. Khrushchev's Russia, eight
 years after the denunciation of Stalin's crimes; secondly, it shows that
 people (some people, at least) are no longer afraid of speaking out on
 behalf of innocent victims of the State.
 The broad outline of the Brodsky case is as follows.      In 1962, two
 men, Shakhamatov and Umansky, were arrested and sentenced in Leningrad on
 charges "of exerting harmful influence on young people and of preaching
 mysticism (Yoga philosophy), anarcho-individualism etc."  The young people
 implicated in this affair included Joseph Brodsky, at that time a young man
 of 22, who after leaving school at 11+, had earned his living as a stoker, a
 metal worker and a laborer with a geological expedition.  The case against
 Brodsky was dropped, however, when the investigating magistrate learned that
 Brodsky had broken with Sha'khmatov of his own accord a year earlier.  The
 police merely confiscated Brodsky's,.papers, among them diaries dating back
 to 1956 and 1957 when Brodsky was a youth of 16-17.  The diaries contained
 some anti-Soviet remarks but the investigating magistrate came to the con-
 clusion that Brodsky had discarded this "unhealthy adolescent mood," and
 that there was no case against him.

 The authors of the petition do not say so in so many words, but imply
 that these diaries confiscated by the police became Brodsky's perdition
 eight years after their composition.  There was one man in Leningrad who,
 for reasons of his own, was evidently bent on Brodsky's destruction.  This
 was a certain Lerner who until 1956 served as an officer with the K.G.B.
 (political police) and who, after dismissal from the K.G.B., became a
 leading light in the so-called "people's squads," officially sponsored
 vigilante groups with the task of assisting police in combating crime,
 hooliganism, etc.  The authors of the petition say that in performing his
 duties Lerner used "methods and devices condemned by the 20th and 22nd
 Party Congresses," that he forced people detained by the squads to become
 informers, confiscated documents, bullied and blackmailed people, fabri-
 cated false evidence, etc.
 Impeccable Life
 It was this frustrated ex-police bully who finally succeeded in run-
 ning down Brodsky.  Brodsky's friends say that, within the last few years,
 the young man had become an outstandingly able translator and poet in his
 own right, and that he had been leading a frugal and morally impeccable
 life, devoting all his energies to his literary activities.  The first
 round shot by Lerner was a scurrilous attack on Brodsky in a local news-
 paper, Vecherr Leningrad, which, late in November 1963, described Brodsky
 as a cynical, loose-living good-for-nothing, ascribed somebody else's
 poems to him, maliciously distorted lines from his own poems and generally
 defamed his character.  Letters to the editor in Brodsky's defence were
 ignored, but Lerner visited the employers of the writers of the letters
 and described them as "protectors of a political criminal."  Lerner also
 succeeded in enlisting the support of some local party officials and of
 the secretary of the Leningrad branch of the Union of Soviet Writers, the
 Stalinist poet Alexander Prokofyev.  A closed meeting of the branch sec-
 retariat, from which Brodsky's friends were excluded, passed a resolution
 demanding that Brodsky be brought to trial as ?"a parasite."
 Witch-Hunt
 As a result of this witch-hunt, Brodsky's health broke down, and in
 January 1964 he entered a Moscow hospital.  On his return to Leningrad., he
 was arrested in the street on February 13 as "a parasite trying to evade
 the course of justice," although (as the authors of the petition say) he
 had never been served with a summons.  Despite protests by the local pros-
 ecutor, Brodsky was kept in prison as a common criminal.  On February 18
 he made his first appearance in court.  He was remanded in custody, and
 a number of well-known writers and scholars appealed to the relevant party
 and law authorities offering evidence in Brodsky's defence.  They pointed
 out that the case was based entirely on Brodsky's old diaries and on new
 evidence fabricated by Lerner.  The court disregarded their pleas, and on
 March 13 passed sentence on Brodsky - characteristically not for any polit-
 ical offences, but merely for alleged moral misdemeanor.  It was after the
 verdict was pronounced that Brodsky's friends took an unprecedented step:
 they made public the text of their petition on his behalf.  In this docu-
 ment they not only point to a blatant perversion of justice and to a dis-
 turbing revival of old police methods, but also to the dangerous mood

 generated during the trial which was in ,e;:?pretea by the crowd as a condem-
 nation of the intelligentsia in general.  What shocked ethe signatories of de-
 fence more was that the press was allowed to heap gross
 fence - "an unprecedented fact in the history of our press (they  not) :  even

 Fish in Winter - A Poem b  Joseph Brody
 Fish in the winter,
 Fish chewing oxygen,
 Fish swimming in the winter,
 Brushing the ice with their eyes,
 To where it is deeper,
 To where the sea is,
 Fish,
 Fish,
 Fish,
 Fish swimming in the winter,
 Fish trying to swim free,
 Fish swimming in darkness,
 Under a wintry, weary sun.
 Fish swimming away from death
 Along the eternal route of fish.
 Fish don't shed any tears,
 Pressing their heads against ice.
 In the cold water
 The eyes of the fish
 Are freezing.
 Fish,
 Fish,
 Fish,
 Poems about fish
 - like fish -
 Stick in one's gullet.

 The defection of Juanita Castro Ruz, younger sister of Fidel and Raul,
 is undoubtedly the severest blow that the Castro regime has suffered since
 the missile crisis of October 1962, more embarrassing even than the findings
 of the recent meeting of foreign ministers of the OAS.  The revelations which
 she made to the press in Mexico City on 29 June 1964 are in themselves a seri-
 ous enough indictment; but coming from a devoted sister who had loyally
 served the 26 of July Movement, they are symbolic of the disintegration and
 disillusionment that are developing in Cuban society and government.
 According to newspaper reports, Juanita had arrived in Mexico some nine
 days before and had remained in seclusion at the home of a younger sister,
 Emma, who is married to a Mexican engineer, Victor Lomeli.  (Although Emma
 has made no public pronouncement, she, too, is looked upon as a defector.)
 After the Interview., Juanita again went into hiding, presumably awaiting
 action by the Mexican government on her request for political asylum.:  This
 she received some four weeks later.
 Although Juanita's defection may have come as a shock to Fidel, it was
 apparently to surprise to Raul:  she left the Havana airport via a scheduled
 Cubana Airlines flight, with 21 pieces of luggage and in full view of dozens
 of agents of the "G-2,." Castro's secret police.  Subsequent stories reflect
 that no less a person Raul Castro himself arranged for her flight and that
 he did so in order to protect her from the wrath of their brother Fidel.
 Juanita Castro Ruz appears to be the fourth of six children born out of
 wedlock to Angel Castro, a wealthy plantation-owner of Oriente Province, and
 Lina Ruz, a servant-laundress in the household.   Angel was born in Spain and
 immigrated to Cuba in 1898 as a day laborer.  He soon made good and married
 Maria Argota, of a respected Santiago family. There were two children born
 to this family:  Pedro Castro Argota, who fled to Central America in 1960,
 and Lidia Castro Argota, who lives in Havana and works for the government.
 Throughout the duration of this marriage, Angel consorted with Lina
 Ruz and produced six children by her, born, according to the best available
 information, in the following order:  Ramon, Fidel, Raul, Juanita., Emma, and
 Angela.  There have been conflicting reports about Juanita's age.  Some news-
 paper writers have said recently that she is only 31 years old, others that
 she is 41.  She claims she was born 6 May 1933.  It is definitely known that
 Fidel was born. 13 August 1926.
 Eventually, Maria Argota left Angel Castro and returned to Santiago,
 where she obtained a divorce.  Some time later, apparently when Fidel was
 about 20 years old., Angel and Lisa were married., thus legitimizing the six
 children, at least under civil law.  Angel died in 1956, and Lima in November
 1963.
 By Cuban standards of the last three decades., Angel Castro was a wealthy
 man.  It was estimated that his assets, which consisted primarily of the sugar
 plantation which he operated in conjuction with his oldest son Ramon, totaled
 half-a-million dollars.  The children had access to the best available educa-
 tion.            Fidel studied at the University of Havana, finally graduating in law.
 Juanita was educated in an Ursuline convent school in the elegant Miramar
