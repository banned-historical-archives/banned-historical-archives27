CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 7219 
before in history. It must be clear to any-
one familiar with criminal law that many 
of the accused do not want fair trials at all, 
if those trials produce justice. What they 
want is mercy; or if guilty, they want a 
smart mouthpiece who can get them off on 
a legal technicality and help them to beat 
the rap. 
Heraclitus reputedly said: "The major 
problem of human society is to combine that 
degree of liberty without which law is 
tyranny with that degree of law without 
which liberty becomes license." 
The emphasis recently has been too much 
on license. Court of law are courts of just-
ice, not courts of mercy. It is the executive, 
the President or the governor who by law 
has the power of pardon. Courts owe a para-
mount duty to the public. Judges swear to 
uphold the Constitution of the United States. 
The preamble of that Constitution states 
that it is ordained to insure domestic tran-
quility?that is, order. Without order there 
can be no blessings of liberty. It is impor-
tant that justice not only be done but that 
it be seen to be done. It is not seen to be 
done when the guilty escape and the inno-
cent walk the streets in fear. When courts, 
out of mistaken sympathy or for any other 
reason, refuse to apply the law as courts of 
justice, then we are approaching the time 
when there will be liberty and justice for 
none. 
THE MESS IN VIETNAM XVI?A 
POLICY IN SEARCH OF A GOVERN-
MENT 
Mr. GRUEN1NG. Mr. President, noth-
ing could more completely reveal the 
falsity, the farcicality, the feebleness, 
and the bankruptcy of the administra-
tion's policy in southeast Asia than What 
is happening in South Vietnam. 
What is happening there can best be 
described as a civil war on top of a civil 
war or a civil war within a civil war. 
Americans?allegedly called into South 
Vietnam by a friendly government?are 
ordered by our own authorities to stay 
off the streets of Saigon because it is 
not safe for them to be out, so great ap-
pears to be the hostility of the inhabi-
tants of that city toward the United 
States. That is In Saigon, not Hanoi. 
Premier Nguyen Cao Ky?the U.S. 
anointed leader of South Vietnam, whose 
one hero is Adolph Hitler?is now at-
tempting to put down by force of U.S. 
arms the growing protests against his 
rule. 
The press is rigidly censored?the peo-
ple are not allowed to learn what is going 
on. Is this the freedom, the protection 
of which we have sent American boys 
to fight for and all too often to die? 
Twelve years of fumbling folly-12 
years of moving inexorably further into 
the quagmire that is South Vietnam?
apparently has not taught successive 
administrations in the United States that 
political problems cannot be solved by 
military might. 
Mr. Tom Wicker, in a thoughtful and 
thought-provoking article in the New 
York Times, April 1, 1966, entitled "Di-
lemma in Vietnam" analyzes the unfor-
tunate predicament of the United States 
In South Vietnam in seeking to build 
upon the quicksand government of Pre-
mier Ky. 
I ask unanimous consent that Mr. 
Wicker's article be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
DILEMMA in VIETNAM?UNREST MAY LEAVE 
UNITED STATES Wm./ CHOICE : LET KY FALL 
OR BACK HIM AT ANY COST 
(By Tom Wicker) 
WASHINGTON, March 30.?Continuing po-
litical unrest in South Vietnam may bring 
the Johnson administration face to face with 
a tormenting double question: 
Can it afford to let the present military 
government fall or should it move openly to 
keep it in power if that becomes necessary? 
So far, the administration regards the situ-
ation as threatening but basically unclear. 
Officials are not yet convinced there will be 
a final clash between the military council 
that has held power in Saigon for 9 months 
and civilian elements primarily in-spired by 
Buddhist leaders. 
So far, it is believed here that the military 
council will weather the storm. But Wash-
ington is perplexed by the council's failure 
to take stronger action to sustain itself, and 
It is not forgotten here that it was Buddhist 
power lathe streets that led to the downfall 
of the regime of President Ngo Dinh Diem in 
1963. 
Since Roman Catholic pressures also are 
being brought on the Government in Saigon, 
and a distinctly anti-American tone is be-
ginning to emerge from student demonstra-
tions, the possibility that the military coun-
cil might be unseated is not discounted here. 
That possibility is taken seriously enough, 
in fact, that attention is being given to the 
question whether the United States could 
afford to let the Ky government fall. Air 
Vice Marshal Nguyen Cao Ky is Premier and 
leading spokesman for the militaty council 
of 10 generals. 
There are two reasons why the ouster of 
Marshal Ky and his military colleagues 
would be regarded here as far more damaging 
than any of the succession of government 
changes that occurred between the Diem 
overthrow in late 1963 and the capture of 
power by the military council last June. 
The first is that President Johnson and 
the administration publicly embraced the 
Ky government at the Honolulu conference 
in February, proclaimed its leaders as part-
ners in winning the war and rebuilding 
South Vietnam, and gave strong endorse-
ment to its plans for pacification and other 
reform programs. 
Thus, the Ky government's overthrow, 
particularly by popular demonstrations such 
as those going on in Hue and DaNang rather 
than by a secret coup, would be something 
of a South Vietnamese repudiation of the 
United States. That could have strong 
repercussions on public opinion in this 
country, in Congress, and among other gov-
ernments. 
It would bolster Communist claims that 
the United States is the aggressor in South 
Vietnam, rather than a defender of a coun-
try that has asked for assistance against 
aggression. 
The other reason is tbat the administra-
tion believes the reform programs of the Ky 
government are sound, that at least the 
major figures in the military council are 
strongly committed to them and that politi-
cal stability in South Vietnam is vitally nec-
essary if these efforts are to have any chance 
of success. 
The administration now is committed to 
the idea that reforms to provide a better 
life for the South Vietnamese people are a 
necessary part of the struggle to win lasting 
control of the populace for the Saigon gov-
ernment. The Ky government is seen here 
as the best hope, at least for the time being, 
to carry out such reform. 
Thus, the administration is desperately 
anxious for the Ky government to survive 
its troubles. They were set off when the 
Saigon military council expelled Gen. Nguyen 
Canh Thi, a Buddhist, who commanded in 
most of the five northernmost provinces, 
where the demonstrations are now strongest. 
An informed source here likened his ouster 
to a snapping rubberband that had set off 
the sequence of events. 
One source of' puzzlement here is why the 
Ky government did not quickly get General 
Thi out of South Vietnam after his ouster 
from the military council. Instead, it al-
lowed him to return to the area where he had 
commanded, and demonstrations have been 
going on there ever since, 
Nor does Washington understand why the 
Ky government has tolerated such events as 
the temporary takeover of radio stations in 
northern cities by student demonstrators, 
who then broadcast antigovernment propa-
ganda. 
Marshal Ky has threatened to take "very, 
very strong measures" if the unrest con-
tinues, but has not yet done so. This also 
puzzles the administration, although it is 
remembered here that when the Diem re-
gime responded with violence to Buddhist 
opposition in 1963, the effect was only to 
create even stronger sentiment against the 
government. 
For much the same reason, overt American 
support for the Ky government would prob-
ably exacerbate the anti-Americanism al-
ready cropping up in some demonstrations?. 
today in Da Nang, for instance?and further 
undermine the government's position with 
the South Vietnamese people. 
If the situation reaches the crisis stage, 
however, the administration would have to 
answer the hard question whether to move 
openly to keep the Saigon government in 
power. 
The disadvantages are obvious. The Ky 
government would immediately be labeled a 
"puppet" of the United States, any claims it 
might have to popular standing would be 
dissipated, and anti-Americanism in South 
Vietnam would be greatly enhanced. On the 
world scene, the U.S. position as the defender 
of an Invaded country would be eroded, and 
congressional critics of the war would be 
mightily bolstered. 
Thus, the administration policy now is to 
lend the Saigon government whatever moral 
and covert support and advice it can, in an 
effort to help Marshal Ky and his colleagues 
surmount the unrest. 
Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge and other 
Americans in Saigon are working overtime to 
convince dissident elements that, whatever 
their problems are now, they are likely to be-
come worse if a change of government is 
forced at what the administration believes is 
a critical stage of the war. 
Mr. Lodge was credited in reports from 
Saigon with having helped persuade Roman 
Catholic elements to tone down a statement 
of their demands for a civilian government, 
lest they undermine the Ky government. 
The Catholics, a powerful minority, are 
said to have warned the government not to 
go too far in appeasing Buddhist demands, 
however. They threatened open opposition 
to Marshall Ky if he did not take vigorous 
steps against the Buddhist-Inspired demon-
strators. 
Marshall Ky, therefore, is caught between 
conflicting pressures and so is the Johnson 
administration. 
A mS,jor question that no one here yet can 
answer concerns the nature of any govern-
ment that might succeed the military coun-
cil. In all likelihood, it is believed here, such 
a government could be "lived with" and 
would prosecute the war, despite the setback 
to social and economic programs that might 
be caused by the upheaval. 
There remains always, however, the possi-
bility that a new government would seek to 
end the war. And no one here rgetends that

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
LT. ( j.G.) PHILIP OWEN ROBINSON?
AMERICAN CASUAT,TIES IN VIET-
NAM 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr, President, within 
a single week last month three young men 
from Wyoming died in battle. One of 
the three was Navy Lt. (j.g.) Philip Owen 
I';,obinson, of Sheridan. 
Several days ago I was in receipt of a 
copy of the letter that he sent to his 
father, Owen. I, Robinson, the day before 
lie was mortally wounded at Quang Nghi, 
Vietnam. 
This young man's death came very 
much as a personal loss to Mrs. Simpson 
and myself. Sheridan has been more to 
me than just another city in Wyoming. 
it was there that I met, courted, and 
married my wife, and I spent a good part 
of my life in that city. I have known 
Mill's parents for more years than I can 
remember and I have watched this young 
man, who died for a cause in which he 
deeply believed, as he passed through 
elementary and secondary school into 
high school and, then to the University 
of Wyoming: He was a student and a 
fellow ATO fraternity member while I 
was president of the university's board 
of trustees. I know personally the fine 
man that, he was and the potential he 
held for his State and Nation. He fell 
in battle along with two other young 
Wyomingites. Army Pfc. Leonard May, 
of Medicine Bow, and Marine Pfc. 
Michael Beck, of Cheyenne. These fight-
in.gmen died less than 5 days apart and 
brought the death toll of Wyomingites 
in Vietnam to It 
Mr. President? it is questionable that 
'any war is worth the cost in lives, not 
because the objectives of the moment are 
not attained, but because history tells 
us that the peace achieved at the end of 
war is so short lived as to vitiate the 
noises for which the blood was shed. 
Those who study this war 20 years from 
now may welt say of us that we could 
neither win the war nor keep the peace., 
on that we can only make supposition.. 
But of one thing I am certain. Phil 
llobinson, Leonard May, Michael Beck, 
those of Wyoming and other States who 
died before them, and those who will 
follow, will have died in vain if com-
munism is not driven. from South Viet-
nam. 
We are fighting a war in that south-
east Asian nation, which denies the polit-
teal context of the endeavor. We have 
only to read today's newspapers to real-
iso that, tlIPIP. are three battlefields in-
volved in the southeast Asian war and a 
loss on any one of the three can mean a 
de feat ir. totality. 
The hills 01111 swamps of the shooting 
war are not, the only battlefi.eld,s oni 
which the war for Vietnam will he de-
ef.led, There are two other fronts of 
equal importance?the governmental 
hatticifield. of Saigon and the political 
of Washington. I have no 
doubt that American fighting men, freed 
of the political hobbles which restrain 
them, could win the shooting war. What 
causes me the greatest concern is the 
war in Washington and the chaos in 
Saigon, neither of which allow us the 
luxury of a protracted conflict in a na-
tion which is teetering on the thin edge 
of political and hence, military disaster. 
Lieutenant Robinson was a iunior offi-
cer uninitiated in the intrigues of 
Saigon or the machinations of high-
level, politically oriented military strat-
egy. But his plea that we "open up on 
the enemy sanctuary in North Vietnam" 
is being heard more and more and not 
only from junior officers but by those 
long experienced in the conduct of war. 
I do not know that bombing Hanoi is 
the answer. Nor would I commit myself 
to a policy of blockading the harbor at 
Hanoi. I do know that by some means?
perhaps mining the harbor or knocking 
out the railroad tracks which connect 
the Communist Chinese mainland to the 
capital of Hanoi--we must stop repeat-
ing the tragic sanctuary blunder of 
Korea. 
I have no desire to see the war in Viet-
nam escalated to a degree that will 
trigger a major land war in Asia. But I 
am firmly convinced that no government 
has the legal or moral right to send sol-
diers to fight when policy has dictated 
in advance of their commitment that 
they will, not be allowed to win. If we 
can require that our Nation's finest 
young men fight and die in Vietnam, we 
must enable them to fight and wirt?f or 
their sake as well as ours. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President, will the 
Senator from Wyoming yield? 
Mr. SIMPSON. I yield to U!e distin-
guished minority leader. 
Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. Pretlident, I 
would like to associate myself with the 
sentiments expressed by the distin-
guished Senator from Wyoming and I 
would like to add a few sentences from 
a letter from the father, who writes from 
Sheridan. Wyo. 
He wrote: 
warPhil  a good boy and the whole city is 
shocked. He was stationed an a ,,smiununi-
cations ship at Norfolk in charge of the code 
room. A year ago he called and sad that he 
would be home the following week. I asked 
him what gives and he said, "Dad I've been 
giving it a lot of thought?thinki a;.; of my 
Mandy and friends and (my way eti life and 
decided to do something about it. I think 
that we had better stop the Communists in 
Vietnam al ,c1 not wait until they get to the 
Montana border." 
Trt keeping with that conviction, he 
did to Vietnam and there lost his life. 
His father wrote further: 
He had been an adviser to the junk fleet 
with one or two other Americans- ? a lonely, 
risky life. He lived with the natives, ate 
with them, saw the atrocities of the Viet-
cong and was completely sold on the Viet-
nam and their cause. He said, "Dad, this 
is a young moan's war?the boys under 20 are 
doing a tersinc job. He had the greatest of 
praise for the chopper pilots as he rode with 
them. He said they know that they are 
sitting ducks but if there is an American to 
be gctten out, especially if wounded they go 
in. 
As I recall, he wrote his last letter to 
his father the day before he died. So 
there is not only another casualty, but 
there is also another hero in the cause of 
the country, 
April 5, 1966 
In line with all of this, Mr. President, 
the first young man from Crawford 
County, Ill., in the little town of Pales-
tine, who lost his life was Thomas A. 
Jennings. I was struck by the fact that 
the casket simply contained these words: 
Thomas A. Jennings, 1945-66. 
That speaks a volume, because he was 
born in one war, and he came to his un-
timely end in another war this year. 
That brings the war home to the coun-
try. Probably one of the tragedies also 
is that his father is a retired Army ma-
jor and was at the services at the time. 
So little towns and large towns, but 
particularly in the small towns, the war 
comes home to them when one who has 
lived in the bosom of the community is 
suddenly snatched out of this li:e. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, I thank 
the Senator from Illinois for his remarks. 
I ask unanimous consent that articles and 
editorials from Wyoming newspapers 
pertaining to Lieutenant Robinson's 
death and the death of Pfc. Leonard 
May and Pfc. Michael Beck, be printed 
in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the articles 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
"AND MAY HE NOT FAIL You"-??-Loc ,s. MARINE 
IS KILLED IN VIET 
(By Wanda Ban(s) 
"And may he not fail you, his country, nor 
his mother. Thank you, God." 
Holding back the tears, Mrs. Weston Beck, 
38, of 147 King Court, read again nclay the 
"Mother's Prayer for Her Marine." 
Yesterday, Mrs. Beck and her husband, a 
railroad brakeman, were notified that their 
son, Pfc. Michael Beck, 19, wa,s kil ed Tues-
day on patrol near Quan Ngni, Vietnam. 
Sgt, William J. Moore, Marine recruiter. 
brought the news to the Beck home, a pink 
shingled house with a decal on the from; 
door, "We are proud to be a service family." 
Only yesterday, Mrs. Beck had received two

A TIME FOR REASSESSMENT 
In this election year of 1966, there are 
signs of restiveness among the American 
people over the way the Johnson adminis-
tration is running the war in Vietnam, and 
over its domestic programs. 
Perhaps the people have no one to blame 
but themselves, for it is with them that the 
ultimate power lies. 
Perhaps, too, the American people des-
perately need today, as peacenika march in 
the streets of our cities and chant slogans 
calculated to serve the purpose of our enemy, 
to make a reassessment of their Government 
and its current conduct of the wax against 
both the North Vietnamese and against pov-
erty; and also to make a reevaluation of their 
own attitudes. 
This past weekend, It was announced that 
a young Navy lieutenant from our own State 
had been killed only last Friday in Vietnam. 
The story of Lt. Philip Robinson, who was 
28 years old, is a deeply moving account of 
dedication to the cause of this country, and 
of personal sacrifice. 
"A year ago in April" said his father, Owen 
Robinson, "he called us and told us he had 
asked for a year's extension in Vietnam. 
He said he had been thinking of his family 
and his friends and our way of life?and 
since he was single, he thought he should do 
something about it." 
He said, Mr. Robinson recounted, "that 
if we were to stop communism we'd better 
do it there than on the Montana border." 
This past weekend, too, Ronald Reagan, 
a movie and TV actor who is a candidate 
No. 59-4 
for the Republican nomination for Gov-
ernor of California, told a meeting in Ne-
braska: "If our sons are going to be al-
lowed to die for their country, they ought 
to be allowed to win." 
While the story of the death of Lieutenant 
Robinson was being told, and Reagan was 
making his speech in Lincoln, Nebr., and 
thousands of anti-Viet war demonstrators 
were marching across the country, there was 
mounting evidence that the real professional 
military leaders of the United States were be-
coming increasingly dissatisfied with the 
manner in which the Johnson administra-
tion is running the war. 
Gen. Earle Wheeler, Chairman of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff, the five generals who are top 
servicemen in the Military Establishment, 
made it known through all but direct quo-
tation that the Joint Chiefs are concerned 
over the prospect of an intensification of 
the war in Vietnam not through a more 
aggressive waging of that conflict by the 
United Statea, but by lack of it. 
For one thing Wheeler and the Joint Chiefs 
have noted intelligence reports indicating a 
greater buildup of North Vietnamese regular 
forces in South Vietnam. For another, they 
also are worried about fuel oil storage sites 
In North Vietnam that they have not been 
allowed to bomb. 
But President Johnson has subordinated 
the advice, based on the professional skill 
and training of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to a 
civilian industrialist, Robert S. McNamara. 
Furthermore, under this wholly civilian op-
erational setup, he has subordinated a 
strictly military concept of the war to a po-
litical basis. 
Our military analyst, Gen. Ira Baker, one 
of our most capable and thoroughly profes-
sional combat leaders of World War II, de-
cries this tendency on the part of the John-
son administration in an article printed in 
an adjacent column today. General Baker 
points out that for the first time in the his-
tory of this country, we have placed almost 
total reliance on strategy as well as tactics 
in the hands of civilians who are amateurs. 
He might have said, one civilian: Mr. Mc-
Namara. This civilian with the possible as-
sistance of the State Department has enun-
ciated the concept that one cannot go too 
far in war?at least in this war?because it 
might bring on greater war, a specious theory 
which overlooks the stark fact that war once 
commenced must be waged with vigor be-
cause the only other alternative Is defeat. 
As for the American people themselves, 
they too must come to realize that they are 
in this as much as the Lt. Philip Robinsons, 
and the young men who already have given 
their lives in sacrifice in this deadly struggle, 
and their families. 
It is not enough that these alone must bear 
the brunt of saving our way of life, as Lieu-
tenant Robinson recognized as his duty. We 
all must bear the common burden. 
In so doing, let us dispense with the belief 
that we can have business as usual; that we 
can simultaneously fight wars of poverty and 
wars of liberation of the oppressed; wars of 
economics at the same time we are fighting 
wars for freedom. Let us discard the notion 
that all we need worry about is material com-
forts at home while young men like Lieuten-
ant Robinson are fighting arid dying for us 
8,000 miles away. 
In short, let us get to the guts of the Viet-
nam matter, now?wholly, totally, and with 
singleness of purpose, through whatever may 
have to be done?including a sacrifice on the 
part of some people of seeking forever to win 
elections by keeping everybody happy.

The returns are coming in faster than ever 
from Vietnam. Yesterday it was Michael 
Beck; 4 days earlier Philip Robinson; the day 
before that Leonard May. 
Three Wyoming boys have yielded up their 
lives in a war far from their homeland, 
within less than a week's time. Michael 
Beck is the second casualty of the war from 
our town; the first was Robert Guthrie. 
What can we say to the parents and fam-
ilies of these? 
In our own incompetent, dumb, and un-
comprehending way, we can say we are sorry; 
that we are saddened, and weep with them 
over their loss. 
That is the very least we can do. 
We can tell them?and especially the 
mothers and wives?that we share with them 
In a modest way, their bereavement. 
It will not help very much, but it may a 
little. 
We can tell them that these are the men 
who were made men far ahead of their time; 
and who further than that have rendered 
the ultimate contribution to their fellow 
man, and to their country. 
They join a legion of Americans that 
stretches back to the war of 1776; to the 
likes of the 32-year-old physician named Dr. 
Charles Warren who stood in the ranks at 
Bunker Hill on a hot June day and yielded 
up his own life that there might be an 
America. 
Or men the stripe of Davy Crockett and a 
rag-tag band of beardless youths and mid-
dle-aged men who perished in the Alamo in 
a similar battle fought 130 years ago this 
very month?then on a foreign field, against 
a despot and tyrant. 
Or the 600,000 men, mostly youths, who 
gave their lives in the most terrible war of 
this Nation's history, from Bull Run through 
Antietam, Shiloh, Gettysburg, Stone Moun-
tain, Appomattox. 
Or the Indian Wars that covered some 30 
years and ground that we presently live on, 
in comfort and security. 
Or San Juan Hill, San Mihiel, the Argonne, 
Bataan, the Battle of the Bulge, Pork Chop 
Hill. 
More than three-quarters of a million men 
have died for the America we know today, in 
battles here and far away; on our home 
ground, in France, Germany, Guadalcanal, 
Tarawa, Iwo Jima, the Philippines. In Ko-
rea and now in Vietnam. 
Vietnam probably will get worse before it 
gets better; and there will be more dread 
messages. 
But let us say that whatever comes we 
must not falter and turn away, if only for 
these who already have given the last ounce 
of their devotion to America. 
They fought for an America that may not 
really exist except in their hearts and minds. 
But if the ideal was theirs, it is for us the 
living to perfect that ideal. 
It is now no question that they have 
measured up to the greatest heights of any 
man, be he President or average citizen. 
They now are tested in time. 
The question before us, the living, is: Do 
we measure up to them?

sideration of Senate Joint Resolution 12'7 
and that the Senate proceed to its im-
mediote consideration. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
joint resolution well be staled for the 
information of the Senate. 
The legislative clerk read as follows: 
A joint resolution designating April 9 of 
erch year is "Sir Winston Chmebill Day." 
Mr. DIRKSEN. The resolution prob-
ably has 35 or more sponsors. The rea-
aon for calling it up by unanmous con-
sent, even though it has not cleared the 
full committee, is that on April 9, which 
is a few days hence, we will observe Sir 
Winston Churchill Day becarse it is the 
third anniversary of the dale when the 
bill was signed which conferred upon 
him honorary citizenship. 
I am advised that in the garden of the 
British Embassy a very impressive statue 
of Sir Winston Churchill wlli be dedi-
cated. 
The House of Representatives, I be-
lieve, will pass the joint resolution today 
also. I believe it timely and appropriate 
that we do likewise. In the terms of 
the joint resolution we ask that the 
President proclaim that day es Sir Win-
ston Churchill Day. 
Mr. DODD. Mr. President, in Jan-
uary I introduced Senate Joint Resolu-
tian 127, which would authorize and 
request the President; to declare April 9 
of each year as Sir Winston Churchill 
Day. 
Forty of my distinguished colleagues 
joined me in cosponsoring this resolution, 
demonstrating quite clearly the wide and 
strong support for such a tribute to per-
haps the most outstanding man of the 
20th century. 
It has been my earnest hope that this 
measure could be passed before next 
Saturday. That will mark the third 
anniversary of the act which made Sir 
Winston the first honorary citizen of the 
United Slates. 
It would coincide also with the un-
veiling of a magnificent bronze statue of 
Churchill at the British Embassy.. 
A most notable occasion would become 
even more significant if the dedication 
of the statue could be the fest anni-
versary cif Sir Winston Churchill Day. 
I want to thank the distinguished Sen-
ator from Illinois, Senator DIRE SEN and 
the distinguished Senate majority leader, 
Senator MANSFIELD, for their interest in 
this measare and their invaluable assist-

BYRON ROGERS, chairman of the House 
Judiciary Subcommittee which hand/es 
such legislation, would like to see this 
April 5, 1966 
taken up on the House floor as soon as 
possible before the Easter recess. 
I would like to express my apprecia-

7234 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
Washington will provide money and set 
standards to serve these needs, but it should 
not attempt to control every step in the 
process, leaving nothing to local imagination 
or initiative. 
Yet the States and localities are poorly 
organized to do their part, and the existing 
systems for sharing Federal revenues are un-
wieldy and outdated. 
It is the task of creative federalism to fos-
ter new institutions at the grassroots level 
and develop new fiscal arrangements so that 
State and local governments can become true 
partners with the Federal Government, and 
not merely little brothers. 
WATER POLLUTION AN EXAMPLE 
One presidential aid, aware that this ex-
planation is a bit fuzzy, cites the adminis-
tration's water pollution bill as an example 
of things to come. A single State cannot 
clean a river. A regional agency with juris-
diction along the river's entire course is 
necessary. Therefore, the bill withholds 
funds from any State whose Governor has 
not promised to join an interstate body hav-
ing power to force compliance on those who 
can control sources of pollution. 
"We are saying, 'You put together an 
organization of counties, cities, towns, and 
States, and we'll give you the money to clean 
your river,' "explains the White House assist-
ant. 
An example of new revenue-sharing ideas 
is found in the administration's recent pro-
posal for rebuilding urban hospitals. Previ-
ous Federal assistance has been funneled to 
the States through Hill-Burton grants and 
loans. It has gone primarily for construc-
tion of new hospitals under a formula that 
guaranteed help for rural States with low 
per capita incomes. 
But it did little for the larger cities, where 
most of the Nation's obsolescent hospitals 
are located. So early in March the President 
sidestepped the Hill-Burton program with 
a new grant-and-loan plan geared specifi-
cally for old hospitals that need new equip-
ment or a general rebuilding. It is tailor-
made for big cities and it is generous in 
financial terms, even by the standards of 
the American Hospital Association. 
A TREND SYMBOLIZED 
The break with tradition in aiding hos-
pitals symbolizes a trend in several other 
Great Society programs proposed or enacted 
In the last 15 months. The drift is away 
from across-the-board grants-in-aid and to-
ward programs that are directed, through 
Federal standards, straight to points of great-
est need. 
Elaborate and specific guidelines bind the 
antipoverty program, demonstration projects 
in cities, and educational funds for children 
of low-income families. Even the school 
milk and lunch programs, Mr. Johnson sug-
gests, should go only to those children who 
need them, not to every child that enters a 
schoolhouse door. 
The shift to tighter Federal restrictions 
means less authority for Governors. States 
participate in the new programs primarily 
in conjunction with other States through 
such associations as the Appalachia Commis-
sion or the proposed regional river commis-
sions. The Governor who had wide latitude 
in determining where an interstate highway 
went in the 1950's will have no such author-
ity in a clean river project of the 1960's. 
The confusion and disagreement over 
trends in federalism are nowhere better re-
vealed than in the cities demonstration pro-
gram, A key figure in this plan for rebuild-
ing central cities is the Federal coordinator, 
the man Who would be assigned to pull to-
gether Government programs at the block 
level. 
His role is viewed by administration de-
signers as one of creating more initiative, 
dynamism, and variety in local development 
plans. But local officials are wary of poten-
tial czardom. 
"Already, proposed coordinators of Wash-
ington's handouts to metropolitan areas are 
being hailed as Federal 'mayors,'" charges 
Michigan Gov. George Romney, who has de-
scribed a "new centralism" in which power 
flows to Washington as Federal money comes 
to the localities. 
Aware of this trend, such Governors as 
John Connally, of Texas, and William W. 
Scranton, of Pennsylvania, far apart in dis-
tance and political philosophy, have voiced 
identical complaints: that they are not given 
a loud enough voice in the development or 
operation of Federal programs. 
Connally has traveled to Washington to 
keep his hand in the Camp Gary Job Corps. 
Scranton complained that the Federal Gov-
ernment keeps talking about cooperation 
without seriously seeking State advice. 
Many share California Gov. Edmund G. 
Brown's lament that "while an increasing 
number of government services are adminis-
tered under joint State and Federal auspices, 
the Governor is brought into the policy-
making discussions * * * only infrequently, 
informally, and haphazardly." 
NEW INSTITUTIONS NEEDED 
A key element entering into any discussion 
of creative federalism is the need for 
new institutions, and White House offi-
cials speak of both public and private insti-
tutions. In the public sector, examples are 
obvious: the river commissions, metropoli-
tan planning organizations encouraged by 
the carrot of financial aid and the rural 
development districts proposed to do what 
separate country towns cannot. 
Applying creative federalism to the private 
sector is more difficult. Officials speak of 
drawing universities into cooperative re-
search centers with the magnet of Washing-
ton money. Or they talk of semipublic cor-
porations formed to do what private business 
alone cannot afford. 
One test of the new approach, they say, is 
coming soon in the development of a proto-
type of the supersonic transport aircraft. 
Private industry alone cannot foot the bill, 
sometimes put at $59 billion, for an SST 
program running from initial research 
through the first generation of 200 planes. 
But the Government wants to avoid a per-
manent subsidy of the sort that threatens 
to engulf it in connection with the maritime 
industry. Federal officials now are trying to 
work out an arrangement with manufac-
turers before entering the prototype stage 
next year. 
"We are looking for some arrangement in 
which we can give them the money to get 
over the hump, help them with information 
and then get some of our money back," one 
official said. 
Such innovations in either the private or 
public sector would be critically reviewed in 
Congress, which is normally skeptical of fun-
damental changes. But there is evidence of 
growing concern. 
Senator EDMUND S. MUSICIE, Democrat, of 
Maine, citing the critical absence of coordi-
nation in Federal grants-in-aid and the local 
governments' shortage of skilled planners and 
managers, is on record in behalf of two fun-
damental reorganizations. He wants a Na-
tional Council for Intergovernmental Affairs 
established in the White House and exten-
sive Federal help in training local personnel. 
What creative federalism really means is 
still anybody's guess. Mr. Johnson appar-
ently is not sure himself, for in his state of 
the Union address he announced that "a com-
mission of the most distinguished scholars 
and men of public affairs" would be created 
to "develop" the new concept. 
There is little doubt, however, that the 
President expects it to be a major contribu-
tion of his years in the White House.

GROWING DISSIDENCE IN VIETNAM 
Mr. CHURCH. Mr. President, in the 
face of the endemic political division and 
deterioration in South Vietnam, I would 
like to bring two items which recently 
appeared in the New York Times to the 
attention of my colleagues. Last Sun-
day James Reston wrote on the "Myths 
and Realities in Saigon." He empha-
sized that an effective war against the 
Vietcong depends upon a cohesive Saigon 
government which does not now exist. He 
feels the recent demonstrations at least 
have exposed the reality. In an editorial 
the next day the Times said Prime Min-
ister Ky's effort to smash opposition in 
Danang, and thereby possibly precipitate 
another civil war, is the application of 
military power to what is basically a po-
litical problem. Because of this, "a 
change in government in Saigon is 
clearly going to be necessary." 
I ask unanimous consent that these 
Items by printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the material 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as folrows: 
[From the New York Times, Apr. 3, 19661 
WASHINGTON: MYTHS AND REALITIES IN 
SAIGON 
(By James Reston) 
WASHINGTON, April 2.?The latest political 
agitation in South Vietnam, with its under-
tones of rebellion and anti-Americanism, 
gives the impression of a new and particu-
larly vicious crisis, but this is misleading. 
It may be a crisis?though it can undoubt-
edly be handled?and it is vicious, but it is 
certainly not new. The demonstrations of 
the Buddhists and the students against the 
Washington and Saigon Governments are not 
transforming the situation but only exposing 
it. They are not changing the political fun-
damentals, but merely reminding us of what 
they are. 
THE ANCIENT PROBLEM 
The nub of the American problem from 
the beginning of this adventure was the 
fragility of the political base from which we 
chose to operate. The present Saigon Gov-
ernment is a coalition of military warload.s. 
The Prime Minister in Saigon, General ity, 
never really had control over the South Viet-
namese military commander in the 1st Corps 
area, General Thi, whose domain bordered 
on North Vietnam. 
The present difficulty arose from the fact 
that the Prime Minister, General Ky, tried to 
prove that he had control over the whole 
country. President Johnson summoned him 
to a dramatic conference in Honolulu. He 
outlined a very sensible program of social and 
agrarian reform for South Vietnam with 
which General Ky agreed. President John-
son treated General Ky as the leader of all 
of South Vietnam, knowing this was not true 
but hoping he could make it true if he said 
so, but it didn't work. 
It is too bad. There should be social re-
form and there should be a powerful central 
government in Saigon that could bring it 
about, but there isn't. General Ky tried to 
prove that there was. Inspired by all the 
publicity and flattery of Honolulu and all 
of the Johnson-Ky photographs, he tried to 
elieninate his rival in the 1st Corps area, 
General Thi, and the trouble started. 
BUDDHISTS AND STUDENTS 
The Buddhists and the st'idents took to 
the streets in support of their deposed local 
leaders. The protests spread from Da Nang in 
the 1st Corps area to Saigon. The U.S. Con-
sul in Da Nang, Samuel B. Thomsen, had to 
urge Americans, including the 60,000 U.S.

CHINA ISOLATED 
The United States old not, isolate Red 
obina from the Soviet Union or from Indo-

Tee United States didn't isolate Red China 
hoof Algeria, or from Yugoslavia, or from 
Lbs African nations which have expelled

been trying to Pring this about for years. 
led China blocks it. 
Would Paing accept an exchange of am-
betesadors with the United States? There 
ls every evidence that it would not, except 
ou its own terms. For example, Peking 
(creed General de Gaulle to withdraw the 
French Ambassador from Formosa before it

int know and it seems to me the U.N. 
should find out. So far Red China has laid 
U >wit wholly unacceptable conditions: For-
ire-ii must be expelled; the 1950 U.N. reso-
le (ion citing Red China as an aggressor in 
the Korean war must be rescinded and the 
United States named the aggressor instead; 
the "imperialist nations" and their "pup-
pets" should be removed from the U.N. 
if a two-thirds majority wants Red China 
lei, why shouldn't they make it quite clear 
lied: nobody is going to be expelled and on 
that premise invite Peking to take a seat? 
Filch a course will, at least, show whether 
the U.N. is keeping Red China out or whether 
Cott China is keeping itself out. 
kg,king's self-isolation doesn't mean that 
we should not try to bring it into wider 
..ontact. It does mean that it will take 
ie long time to do it, almost certainly into 
he next generation of Chinese Communist 
leaders. Like Stalin s Russia, Red China 
apparently needs to picture the United States 
ie; a big enemy in order to justify the mees-
eve repressions of the Mao regime. A -U.S. 
pohicy of containment and contact makes 
e'use. 
IVIORE Bici BROTHER 
Mr. LONG of Missouri. Mr. Presi-
h!ent, 2 weeks ago the Senate Subcom-
nittee On Administrative Practice and 
l'eocedUre resumed its hearings on inva-
sion of privacy. We took testimony on 
number of problems, ranging from gov-
f.q.nmental invasions of privacy to Indus-
t-rial espionage in the drug industry. 
ikIntarently, our subcommittee was not 
the only (Inc concerned with this serious 
problem. My good friend and colleague 
r.onator Armco:Fr took testimony from 
Mr. 
Rile h Nader on the activities of 
1.A:neral Motors. And even the State 
liepartment was involved in tracking 
01.kiwii American citizens as they traveled 
broad. 
Max Lerner has writ-ten a most, inform-
alive on this subject. His 
opening sentence expresses my feelings, 
when he says: "Snoopers, snoopers, 
everywhere." I ask unanimous consent 
in insert at this point in the RECORD, the 
article by Mr. Lerner which appeared in 
the Evening Star on Tuesday, March 29, 
1966. 
There being no abjection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
THE PATH TOWARD A DOSSIER STATE 
(By Max Lerner) 
Snoopers. snoopers, everywhere. Doubt-
less it is sheer coincidence that three major 
cases of snooping, in -three widely different 
fields, should have hit the headlines at the 
same time. But in the America of 1965 
rather than of 19E4 the effeet is too eerily 
big brotherish to be shrugged off. 
All three have broken here in Washington 
One was a ease of industrial espionage and 
involved the highly artificial price structure 
of the drug industry. The head of a firm 
of industrial sleuths, working for a drus 
manufacturer, told a senatorial subcont-
raittee that he had planted a spy in a, 
wholesale drug company to discover whether 
he was cutting his prices to retailers. 
The second was an admission by the head. 
of General Motors, before another Senor e 
committee, that this giant company lied 
spied upon a young Washington lawyer tyro 
had written a book that is highly critical cff 
cars as containers for human beings, am hi 
which attacks them as death traps. 
Third was the disclosure that at the re-
quest of the FBI, the State Department in d 
asked the embassies in Paris and Moscow ,.0 
place a Harvard professor of hietory under 
surveillance. 
I am sure that somewhere in each caee 
somebody thought he was (Mine the right 
thing: I am also sure that these are not iso-
lated. cases. Industrial espionage is wide-
spread; massive auto corporations, with a big 
invostment. in current models, are 'tempted 
to protect their investment by len; than open 
methods; the State Department now tells -ts 
that it is a common practice, and that hun-
dreds and even thousands of Americans hese 
been treated with this extra attention. 
Shades of Adam Smith, who saw the see-
tern of business competition as "nature's 
simple plan." Shades of Jeffers-eel, who WaS 
convinced that the crucial value i.n the young 
American republic was the jealous safeguard-
ing of the right al criticism. Sb id-es of JIIS-
thee Holmes, who spoke of the "dirty business 
of wiretapping" and had the old-fashiored 
sense of honor and openness that gave him a 
healthy dislike for snooping in every form. 
The fact that there things are done com-
monly and on a big scale does not mete 
them more attractive but 
Of the three cases I find the sleuthing of 
americans by U.S. embassies abroad the mieit 
disquieting. The target was FI. Stu-:rt 
Hughes, a teacher and scholar of distinciti, in, 
who has taken some naive political positi. ,ns 
I'm the past but probably not any more so 
than many other American mtellectu ,Is. 
One doesn't have to agree with Hughes in 
order to believe that his political posit: ,ns 
are no justiffeation for shadowing him when 
he goes cm a research assignment to Eurtpe. 
It appeared at first that the passport cf.vi-
sion of the State Department had issued eise 
surveillance order on its own, without a re-
quest from any agency. Then it turned ont 
that the FBI lied sent through a reqmest. 
Perhaps it's more consoling for the shack-reed 
person to know (if he ever discovers it) i Pat 
the surveillance of him is p'u-suant to a 
reouest from a Government agency, and leat 
everything has been done in proper /cum. 
But bureaucratic order doesn't help muco if 
the principle itself is a highly doubtful ane. 
While saying that it has been common 
practice for years to shadow Ameri,,ans 
abroad, the State Departmene was tmsble 
to cite the legal authority under which is 
done. I suppose the answer is that in. is 
not a legal but a practical peoblem. at a 
tirne of war, whether cold or hot, there are 
agencies whose tasks it is to guard U.S. 
security. They keep a watch over certain 
men within U.S. jurisdiction, and when they 
go abroad the vigil presumably continues. 
There may be no real answer to the prob-
lem. The FBI and similar agencies would 
feel crippled if they could not ask for sur-
veillance of people they suspect. But the 
trouble is that there is no way for the rest 
of us?the Nation as a whole?to form any 
Judgment of how responsibly or irrespon-
sibly those suspicions have arisen, how 
and why a particular man is chosen for 
shadowing, by whom and on what grounds 
the decision to make the request is reached, 
and what use is made of the harvest of infor-
mation that is gathered about the suspect, 
Can we not, with ail our vaunted intel-
lectual resources, contrive some way by 
Which the security of the Nation will be 
tolerably guarded while retaining one of the 
prime values of our society: 
The right of a person to live his life, well 
or ill, without benefit of the snoopers? 
INTEREST IS BUILDING IN CRE.A? 
TIVE FEDERALISM AND INTER-
GOVERNMENTAL RELATIONS 
Mr. MUSKIE. Mr. President, the 
growing interest of the Nation's press in 
the development of a creative federalism 
to help State and local governments bet - 
ter meet public needs is both salutary 
and significant. This interest, of course. 
is heightened by President Johnson'..; 
particular concern with modernizing our 
Federal system to bring State and local 
governments into a closer partnershio 
with the Federal Establishment. A very 
well-written and thoughtful article by 
William Chapman appeared last Sunday 
in the Outlook section of the Washingto ) 
Post entitled "The States as Partners." 
It highlights some of the thinking ef 
Presidential assistants, State leader:3, 
and others on this important subject. 
I ask unanimous consent that Ma 
Chapman's article be printed in tl e 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the arti;),e 
was ordered to be printed in the P,ECORD, 
as follows: 
THE STATES AS PARTNMS--L.B.J. WANTS Trim IV 
TO COOPERATE WITH FEDERAL GOVERNNI:1 T 
BUT NOT AS LITTLE 13ROTHERS 
(By William Chapman) 
In city halls and State capitols, ears are 
cocked apprehensively toward the W I)' 
House these clays for answer to a widely ft:?
cussed question: "What is creative federalit 
all about?" 
It is a common but enigmatic phrase teei

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
soldiers in Da Nang, to keep off the streets, 
and even American officials and Congressmen 
were advised to cancel their proposed trips 
to Saigon. 
An this proves is that the political situa-
tion is unchanged, and that the propaganda 
of Honolulu has not prevailed over the power 
and tradition of Saigon. There is no cohe-
sive national spirit in that nation for the 
simple reason that there is no nation. 
It is still a tangle of competing individuals, 
regions, religions, and sects, dominated by a 
group of military warloads, representing, dif-
ferent regions, an army without a country, 
presiding over a people who have been torn 
apart by war and dominated and exploited 
by Saigon for generations. 
THE AMERICAN DILEMMA 
No doubt American power will be able to 
sustain the central government of General 
Ky in the present crisis, but the more power 
we use, the more American domination will 
be resented. This is the dilemma. It has 
been there from the beginning and the latest 
political struggle has merely brought the 
facts to the surface. 
The basis of American intervention in the 
beginning?and even of the official American 
thesis now?is that we are in Saigon to sup-
port a "government" and a "nation" against 
external aggression, which that Government 
and nation must win or lose primarily by 
themselves, but there is no Saigon Govern-
ment that can govern, and no South Viet-
namese "nation" in our understanding of 
the word. 
ENDS AND MEANS 
Meanwhile, the war goes on, unaffected so 
far by the political turmoil, but there is a 
basic problem still unresolved. Washington 
is still counting on a cohesive Saigon 
Government that does not exist. It cannot 
count on effective political or military action 
by the South Vietnamese and it is not pre-
pared to produce the political and military 
manpower to take their place. 
/n short, the administration in Washing-
ton has not adjusted to the facts. It has 
not brought its ends and its means into line, 
It has accepted the ends of the "hawks"?
destruction of the enemy's forces?but not 
the means, and it has accepted the ends of 
the "doves"?a negotiated compromise?but 
not their means, negotiation with the Viet-
cong who are doing most of the enemy fight-
ing. 
So Washington is in trouble. It is relying 
on myths and the only consolation of the 
present political demonstrations is that they 
are at least exposing the reality. 
1From the New York Times, Apr. 4, 19661 
VIETNAM: WAR WITHIN WAR 
Premier Ky's threat to smash dissidence in 
Danang and Hue by flying in troops from 
Saigon raises the danger of military clashes 
with local forces that could precipitate a 
second civil war in South Vietnam. It is 
the application of mlitary force to what is 
essentially a political problem. And the use 
of American planes and weapons for this 
purpose?despite the claim that American 
troops will not be requested?makes it vital 
that Washington call a halt to this dan-
gerous adventure. 
A change of government in Saigon is 
clearly going to be necessary. The question 
is not if, but when?and how?a representa-
tive civilian regime can be established. Al-
though he has only been in office 7 months, 
Premier Ky already has overstayed by 5 
months the time predicted for him by former 
Ambassador Maxwell Taylor. 
President Johnson's Honolulu embrace 
who obscured the Conference's real pur-
pose?to generate a new program of social re-
form?weakened rather than strengthened 
Premier Ky's position and made recourse to 
anti-Americanism a logical move for his po-
=cal competitors. An attempt to perpetu-
ate Premier Ky in his post to save face for 
Mr. Johnson would only tar him further as 
an American puppet. 
A new political balance has to be struck 
in Saigon. What is most important is not 
Its exact nature but that a new balance of 
political forces should emerge?and that It 
emerge in as orderly a fashion as possible. 
The crisis in South Vietnam is not a popu-
lar upheaval calling for panic moves; nor has 
the Vietcong taken over Danang and Hue. 
What was in progress, until this past week-
end, was essentially a Cabinet crisis, accel-
erated by the dismissal from the military 
directorate of its most powerful member, 
the northern commander, Gen. Nguyen 
Chanh Thi. The street demonstrations, 
even if somewhat infiltrated by Vietcong 
agents, were traditional maneuvers by or-
ganized factions seeking to influence the 
outcome. The first need is not to "restore" 
Saigon's control of South Vietnam's north-
ern provinces?a control it has not been able 
to exercise for many weeks?but to come to 
terms with the political problems. 
This, Premier Ky now promises to do by 
calling a national political congress of all 
factions to select a constituent assembly. 
The makeup of the constituent assembly is 
the critical issue between the Saigon direc-
torate and the militant Buddhist faction led 
by the Hue monk, Thich Tri Quang, whose 
stronghold is also in the northern provinces. 
Tri Quang insists that the new constituent 
assembly be drawn entirely from local and 
provincial councils to which last year's elec-
tions returned predominantly Buddhist 
elements. 
It is a mark of Premier Ky's political in-
eptitude that the formation of this assembly, 
planned last year and promised for February 
at Honolulu, was not completed before the 
dismissal of General Thi?and that General 
Thi then was permitted to return to Hue. 
The crisis illustrates again the extent to 
which the United States is becoming Sai-
gon's prisoner. The American Embassy was 
not consulted or even informed of General 
Thi's dismissal until the military directorate 
had taken its fatal decision. 
Premier Ky's decision to send troops to 
Danang appears also to have been taken 
without consultation. Before the situation 
gets further out of hand, the strongest in-
fluence must be exerted to resolve the Saigon 
struggle by political means. 
REA YOUTHFUL PRIZE WINNERS 
Mr. MONRONEY. Mr. President, each 
year the Farmers Union in Oklahoma 
sponsors a Washington trip for its mem-
bers and for youth winners of an essay 
contest in the State. Always, the group 
is an interesting one and I enjoy visiting 
with its members. 
One of the winning essays this year 
was by Steve Powell, of Altus, Okla,, 
who discussed how 4?H Clubs promote 
community living. I ask unanimous con-
sent that it be inserted in the RECORD. 
A second essay by Kirk Castleberry, Nin-
nekah, Okla., stresses the benefits for 
farming as a good way of life provided 
by the Farmers Union and by rural elec-
tric cooperatives. I also ask unanimous 
consent for its inclusion in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the essays 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
How MY ORGANIZATION PROMOTES 
COMMUNITY LIVING 
(By Steve Powell, Altus, Okla.) 
I am 15 years old and I do not know 
exactly what a community is. What a com-
munity means to me might be something 
7235 
entirely different than to you. Webster 
doesn't define it as to site, but says it is a 
group of people having common organiza-
tion or interest. So, if this is true, all of 
Oklahoma could be considered a community, 
but whether it be all of Oklahoma, western 
Oklahoma, Jackson County, or a small com-
munity in Jackson County, my organiza-
tion?the 4-H Club?it is the same in prin-
ciple wherever 1-II Clubs are found. It is 
its purpose to first develop the person. 
While the person is being developed, we do 
like my grandmother does when she is bak-
ing a cake. We throw in a pinch of incen-
tive, a dash of leadership, and a large help-
ing of citizenship. Placed in the oven of 
community life to grow for a few years, soon 
we are "done" enough to take our place as 
responsible' citizens in our communities. 
While we 4-41 members are still cooking, we 
are definitely making a contribution to com-
munity living. We represent free enterprise 
in miniature. We voluntarily joined our 
community 4-II Club. No one forced me to 
join or dictated which club I should join. 
I voluntarily selected my own projects. 
The success of 4-H Club projects depends 
upon the time and energy that each member 
puts into them. Upon the successful com-
pletion of our porjects, we usually receive 
some kind of award as the fruits of our 
labor. This is true of any community. It 
is no better than the people who live there 
and no community progresses unless much 
effort and leadership is put forth. The 
awards I receive are mine and mine alone. 
I do not have to share them with those 
who have been lazy and less diligent. With 
this kind of training, the community we 
live in will be in a position to go forward and 
be a better place to live as a result of my 
organization, the 4-H Clubs. 
I am disturbed by the comments older 
people make, but mostly I am disturbed 
about uninformed people, some of them pro-
fessional peddlers of gloom and doom, who 
shout to the housetops the American family 
farm and rural communities are being wiped 
out. I am disturbed to hear some of them 
describe American farming as our greatest 
problem. And I hear some of these same 
people caution us young people to stay away 
from, or get out of farming?that it's not 
a good life, that it's too risky. For years the 
Farmers Union has promoted and encouraged 
family farms. All of us will agree that a 
family farm today is much larger than a fam-
ily farm was 20 years ago, and that our com-
munities do not have the same boundary 
line they had 20 years ago, but as we 4-H 
members view this situation this is a sign of 
the times, it denotes progress and we want 
to be a real part of this progress of the 
changing time. Our 4-H Clubs have geared 
their programs and projects to the changing 
time just as the Farmers Union has had to 
do too. Let us further compare the objec-
tives and goals of our two organizations. 
Farmers Union means many things to hun-
dreds and thousands of men, women, and 
young people. But each and every activity, 
whether on the local or national level, has a 
single purpose. The single purpose of Farm-
ers Union or the 4-H Clubs is a strong 
family relationship, in a strong agricultural 
community, in a strong America. It all 
comes back to the family, the most impor-
tant unit in Farmers Union, also the most 
important to 4-H Club work. 
Strength for your organization or my 1-H 
Club comes through knowledge. That is 
why your Educational Department of the 
Farmers Union is so important to your over-
all program and this is why 4-H Clubs were 
first started and this is why they are stronger 
today in every community than ever before. 
And every member of the family is impor-
tant to your organization. Our 4-H Clubs 
members believe that it is not guns, missiles, 
and atomic power alone that keep our great 
country strong and free. We believe that

local people and local communities that are 
Interested in local affairs contribute more 
to a strong economy, a better way of life, 
more opportunity for ns young people than 
any other factor. I know this is all true: 
for the Farmers Union of Jackson County 
has and still is taking a real interest in us 
4. -1-1 members both with their time and 
money, or I have been the recipient of their 
efforts. 
Yes; we are very much alike: Farmers 
Union means summer camps, National and 
State conventions, local action and enter-
taining meetings, international exchange 
programs. This is our program, too. So 
with the same program, Farmers Union and 
4 .T1 Clubs can continue to hold hands and 
move forward in our communities promoting 
a better living for all. The spirit of our 4-H 
Club Is refleeted in the prayer of the Saint 
O.oin Assisi: "May T seek not so much to be 
served, as bi serve others."

out a greet change was coming. On 
May 11, 1935. President Franklin Roosevelt, 
by Executive order, created the Rural Electric 
Ad min istra, i on. 
When. Congress provided funds, it hoped 
private utility companies would use this low-
interest money for rural electric develop-
ment, but they thought it wouldn't pay. 
Their lines served 20 to 50 customers per 
mile. The rural system would average three. 
eio the farmer lived in the "dark age" from 
10 to 20 years longer. 
'Dien the Farmers' Th,lon which had

J, when this trusted. organization sug-

listened, 
Each of these rural electric cooperatives IS 
local, inDeoenrient enterprise whose pri-
mary purpose is to furnish dependable, low-

On the farm more than 400 uses of elec-

rural homes and stock tanks. Electrified 
dairy farms produce more pure milk than 
ever before. It Irrigates fields, augers grain, 
runs hay elevators, and furialshes power for 
all farm shop tools----welders, solderers, saws, 
and drills. 
Many farm families are enjoying all-elec-

washed and dried indoors; electric heat and 
air conditioning are being added to farm 
homes each month, 
The EEC's also provide minty benefits to 
the local, State, and National communities. 
Competition is Oklahoma's greatest guar-

Seven hundred million doll us have been 
spent in Oklahoma towns by ItEC customers 
on appliances. Motels, restatrants, filling

No environment; can be more pleasant than 
the farm community. Farm :'amities work 
together to understand and soh e each other's 
problems. Farm children sht re the work

velop an early sense of respons bility toward 
both. 
Farm people have a strong al preci.ation of

COLUMNISTS UND 
INVESTIGATION 
Mr. WILLIAMS of Delaware. Mr. 
President, in the April I, 19C6? issue of 
the Washington Post there appeared an 
article by Drew Pearson and J ick Ander-
son entitled "Columnists Unctr. Investi-
gation." 
During the past several weeks these 
writers have written several ayticles out-
lining questionable transactions which 
allegedly involve a Member of the U.S. 
Senate, and that Senator ha; officially 
asked both the Justice Depart ment and 
the Senate Ethics Committee lo investi-
gate all of these charT,es and announce 
their decision to the public. 
In fairness to the man bein, charged, 
this investigation should be eonducted 
thoroughly and promptly. 
If the charges are false the man has a 
right to have his name clearel?and if 
they are true then the Ethics Cmunittee 
should so notify the U S. Senate. 
But as this investigation proceeds, let 
it be remembered that the No 1 job is 
to establieh the accuracy or ir accuracy 
of the charges. After this has been 
done it will be time enough thui should 
there be a question as so the manner in 
which the information was obtained. 
I repeat, the question here is not how 
did Mr. Pearson get the information, but 
is it true or false? 
I ask unanimous consent thal the ar-
ticle be printed in the RECORD. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printcd in the ,R,ECoRD, 
as follows: 
1515 IlasnSR IN VESTIGA-1 ION 
(By Drew Pearson and ,lack Ancierson) 
A funny Thing happened to us the other 
day at the Justice Department. 'lee were 
called down there by Attorney General 
Nicholas dela Katzenbach and were told, we 
were under criminal investigation on a 
April 5, *If-966 
charge filed by Senator THOMA3 Done, Demo-
crat, of Connecticut, of stealing documents 
from his files. 
This raises a very importane point. If it 
Is a crime for newsmen to seek evidence doc-
umenting charges of corruption against a 
U.S. Senator, then the press must give up 
one of its important functions and Senators 
will remain a sacrosanct body, able to expose 
others regarding deep freezes, mink coats, 
vicuna coats, and Bobby Baker's conflicts of 
interest, but immune from exposure them-
selveS. 
For it is almost impossible to prove in-
dictable facts regarding a Senator, or for that 
matter any official, without using evidence 
obtained from the inside. 
Furthermore, using inside evidence is one 
of the chief ways the FBI and most law en-
forcement agencies operate. 
It would have been impossible for instance, 
for the FBI to secure evidence on the Ku 
Klux Klan in the Liuzzo murder case with-
out having an FBI agent inside the Klan. 
Almost every week the FBI pays money for 
inside information. So does In iernal Reve-
nue. Many of the tax convictions in the 
United States result from inside information. 
There is a law on the statute books pro-
viding remuneration to tax informers; and 
Congress appropriates the money for tile FBI 
to pay for inside information. 
PUBLIC'S RIGHT 'no KNOW 
As it happens, we paid no money and stole 
no documents. We did talk to fernier Mem-
bers of DODD'S staff who were motivated by 
the highest interest, namely tao public's 
right to know when a U.S. Senator delivers 
speeches and performs chores for a foreign 
agent; when he deposits in his personal ac-
count thousands of dollars contributed to his 
election; when he accepts valu ibles from 
companies he helped in regard to Govern-
ment contracts; and when he charges both 
the taxpayers and private organist tions lor 
trips he makes around the country 
The Attorney General's investigation also 
raises an important point regarding sen 
tonal "theft" or use of unauthorized docu-
ments. 
We asked Mr. Katzenbach, for instance, 
whether he had investigated Senator joilu 
WILLIAMS, Republican, of Delaware, as 1,0 
how he obtained the documents which is 
publicized in the Bobby Baker case. Obs - 
ously they were obtained from Governmer t 
employees who believed in the 
to know. 
The Attorney General said he hr ii not in-
vestigated Senator WILLIAMS. 
We also asked whether he had le oestigs Sc'! 
Senator DODD'S possession or possible theft of 
the Otepka papers. This was the famon; 
case where Done, as vice chairmen of the 
Senate Internal Security Subcomni ltee, wit 
personally involved with obtaining ,qate De-
partment files. 
The State Department considered thin 
theft. For on September 23, 1963, it charged 
Otto F. Otepka, Chief of the Evidence Voids - 
tion Division of the State Depart/net lOs 0111.*.e 
of Security, with violations of 13 rewilathie8 
by giving confidential informatior. to tie 
Senate Internal Security Subcommittee. 
CHAMPIONED THEFT 
On November 5, Otepka was (1,.znir-4.0. 
Later that day, Senator DODD denounced the 
State Department, warning that if Olepkan 
ouster "is permitted to stand it will become 
impossible or exceedingly difficult in ellen 
any information from employees of the ex-
ecutive branch that bears on * * wron;;-
doing by their superiors." 
Katzenbach said he had not inve.aigated 
Donn in connection with the alleged ,heft et 
the Otepka papers.

prime weapon needed to bring about a re-
duction in accident frequency and severity. 
We do not need more Federal encroachment 
in safety matters in noncoal mining. What 
we need is an enthusiastic and deeply in-
grained safety consciousness in top manage-
ment; a firmly supported educational pro-
gram for all employees in safe working 
habits; and continued and vigorous efforts 
to personally recognize and stimulate each 
employee's interest in safety through awards 
programs, frequent safety meetings, and by 
sustained instruction in accident preven-
tion." 
Mr. Goodwin admits that some States need 
to improve the position of local inspectors, 
eliminate out-of-date laws, and improve 
State controls over health and safety in the 
mines. Why for the past 20 years have many 
of the States lagged in this vital matter? 
Why is the threat of a Federal statute re-
quired to have the States do what they 
should have been doing all along? 
The record for this period shows that more 
than enthusiasm on the part of management 
is required to bring about a reduction in ac-
cident frequency and severity. For anyone 
to advocate otherwise is to fly in the face of 
reality. 
In the December 1963 issue of the Mining 
Congress Journal, an article by James Boyd 
states as follows: 
"We must acknowledge that all mines do 
not live up to safety standards that are well 
recognized, and that there are no means by 
which the industry itself can enforce com-
pliance; hence, some public authority with 
enforcement powers is necessary. We firmly 
believe that these powers should remain with 
the State or local authorities. Enlightened 
management recognizes that both the human 
and the economic considerations require 
strict attention to safety standards, and by 
far the majority of mining administrations 
enforce within their own operations stand-
ards which are more stringent than can be 
feasibly set by law. There are only a few 
Who do not live up to these standards and 
whose accident rates give rise to the clamor. 
for Federal enforcement powers." 
Some operators realize that all mines do 
not live up to safety standards. There are 
no means by which the industry can enforce 
compliance on itself. 
Many of the corporations engaged in me-
tallic and nonmetallic mining are cooperat-
ing with the Bureau of Mines health and 
safety programs at this very moment. 
The following statement on page 58, House 
hearings on mine safety, 87th Congress, re-
veals the following: 
"Mineowners are indebted to the U.S. Bu-
reau of Mines for its data on accidents and 
recommendations for their prevention. The 
Bureau employs competent engineers and 
obtains trustworthy data in rendering its 
service." 
The attempt to augment this excellent and 
necessary activity with Federal inspection 
saw the operators retreat to State inspection 
and statutes as the better approach to mine 
safety. 
If they have such great respect for the 
Bureau staff on an educational basis, why 
the resistance when an inspector is given 
the authority to see that all mines are made 
as safe as they can humanly be made? 
The very nature of underground mining 
makes it a dangerous industry in which to 
operate and to work. 
You cannot have too many involved in 
safety, be they State or Federal agencies, 
or private associations. The operators ad-
mit they can't enforce compliance. 
The attitude of the Bituminous Coal Oper-
ators Association is in marked contrast to 
the metallic and nonmetallic operators of the 
American Mining Congress, In a paper de-
livered by Mr. George C. Trevorrow, safety 
director of the association at the American 
Mining Congress mining show, Las Vegas, 
Nev., October 11-14, 1965, stated as follows: 
"Top management of most of the larger 
coal companies insist on a strong safety 
program at its mines. This attitude is re-
flected in every case in a low number of in-
juries and a low injury frequency rate. Part 
of this insistence is due to the increasing 
sensitivity to public opinion, but mainly be-
cause its representatives have learned that 
a safe coal mine is an efficient one and that 
a good safety program is just good business. 
In many of these companies the top man-
agement insists on getting reports of all 
mine inspections, reports of the investiga-
tions of injuries and those of any unusual 
occurrences in or about the mines. Such 
management obviously is kept informed of 
the injuries occurring at the mines. It fol-
lows with this careful scrutiny that inspec-
tions and investigations are carefully made; 
the supervisors are anxious to keep substand-
ard conditions found on these inspections to 
a minimum; and every reasonable attempt 
is made to prevent recurrence of injuries." 
The task at hand is such that State in-
spection where it is experienced benefits 
from contact with and the work of the Bu-
reau of Mines inspectors, as the operations 
In coal have proven. This trend has not 
diminished, for they look to the Bureau of 
Mines for guidance and information. 
Progress in this effort for mine safety leg-
islation in the metallic and nonmetallic 
mines has been painfully slow, but there has 
been progress none the less. The fact that 
this act, HR. 8989 is before the subcOmmit-
tee is evidence as to that. 
If the need was not there the legislative 
efforts to secure mine safety legislation 
would have faltered back in the 84th Con-
gress and come to nothing. The need was 
there. The hearings of the 84th, 87th, ,and 
89th sessions of the Congress bear out that 
contention. The 24-month study by the 
Department of the Interior as authorized by 
Congress made a major contribution to mine 
safety, when it provided the vehicle for the 
introduction of a mine safety bill sponsored 
by the administration. 
The House reported out a good bill. HE,. 
8989 can become a better one, if amended 
as has been proposed. 
We hope this subcommittee will be able 
to report favorably on HR. 8989 with the 
suggested amendment to section 13 of the 
act, and that the Committee on Labor and 
Public Welfare will vote its approval of this 
much-needed legislation in the vital field 
of metallic and nonmetallic mining. 
I thank you for the opportunity you have 
given me in presenting this stat 
RULES OF U.S. MILITARY ASSIST-
ANCE COMMAND IN VIETNAM 
Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, every 
American who is a member of the U.S. 
Military Assistance Command, Vietnam, 
Is issued a very important document, en-
titled "Nine Rules for Personnel of U.S. 
Military Assistance Command, Vietnam," 
immediately upon his arrival in Vietnam. 
I believe this document speaks rather 
eloquently of our fighting men in Viet-
nam who are involved not only in war-
fare but also in the very important task 
of bringing about better understanding 
and improved relationship between our 
people and the Vietnamese. 
I wish to share with my colleagues the 
nine important rules issued by our com-
mand in Vietnam to our service per-
sonnel. 
I ask unanimous consent that the full 
text of this document be printed in the 
RECORD. 
There being no objection, the rules 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
NINE RULES FOR PERSONNEL OF U.S. MILITARY 
ASSISTANCE COMMAND, VIETNAM 
The Vietnamese have paid a heavy price 
in suffering for their long fight against the 
Communists. We military men are in Viet-
nam now because their Government has 
asked us to help its soldiers and people in 
winning their struggle. The Vietcong will 
attempt to turn the Vietnamese people 
against you. You can defeat them at every 
turn by the strength, understanding, and 
generosity you display with the people. 
Here are nine simple rules: 
1. Remember we are guest here; we make 
no demands and seek no special treatment. 
2. Join with the people. Understand their 
life, use phrases from their language and 
honor their customs and laws. 
3. Treat women with politeness and re-
spect. 
4. Make personal friends among the sol-
diers and common people. 
5. Always give the Vietnamese the right-
of -way. 
6. Be alert to security and ready to react 
with your military skill. 
7. Don't attract attention by loud, rude, 
or unusual behavior. 
8. Avoid separating yourself from the peo-
ple by a display of wealth or privilege. 
9. Above all else you are members of the 
U.S. military forces on a difficult mission, re-
sponsible for all your official and personal 
actions. Reflect honor upon yourself and 
the United States of America. 
"PA AND MA AND L.B.J." 
Mr. BYRD of West Virginia. Mr. 
President, in times such as these, when 
many of us feel the tenseness of the 
war in South Vietnam and the pressure 
of domestic problems of inflation and 
taxation, it is helpful to sit back and see 
the lighter side of life. 
For this reason, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD an 
article from the April edition of Nation's 
Business. The article is entitled "Pa and 
Ma and L.B.J." with the subtitle, "Or 
How To Become a Casualty in the Gov-
ernment's War on Poverty." It was writ-
ten by Jim Comstock, editor of the West 
Virginia Hillbilly of Richwood, W. Va. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD 
as follows: 
PA AND MA AND L.B.J. 
Pa had no sooner climbed out of the truck 
which he'd thumbed a ride in when he 
hollered at Ma to get him the foreign coun-
try map and find out where poverty was a 
President Johnson had just declared war on 
that country and expected every man to do 
his duty, and Pa was preparing to do his but 
he wanted to know where the place was and 
how to get there. 
Fiddlin' Clyde, who sat in the parlor a-
strumming his guitar, quit humming the 
song he had just composed called "I Left My 
Baby Depressed in the Mountains," or "I 
Want to Hold Your Handout." He allowed 
Ma needn't worry none about no geography 
because he knew where Poverty was. It was 
in Kentucky. He knew because he heard the 
Great Society social worker ,say if anybody 
wanted to find Poverty in West Virginia, 
they ought to have a look in Kentucky first. 
Fiddlin' Clyde ain't called Fiddlin' Clyde 
because he plays the fiddle but because he 
fiddles around with the guitar. And he al-
ways makes songs about what Pa is think-
ing about.

certain sections of the act. The amendment 
postpones, until 1 year after the date of

datory mine health and safety standards, the 
power of the Secretary to issue a notice to 
a mine operator requiring the abatement of 
a- violation of curb a standard or to issue an

the date of publication of the mandatory

The extent to which this amendment will 
postpone the effective date of the Secre-
tary's powers to issue abatement notices and 
orders of withdrawal and debase/vitt, will de-
pend upon the timelag between the enact-
ment of the act and the designation of man-
datory standards, as well as upon the timing 
of legislative sessions in the individual 
States?particularly in those States whose 
legislatures meet only biennially. 
During 1906, 26 States will hold legislative 
salons. The remainder of the States do not 
have a regular legislative session scheduled 
Oil iii 1967.. 
To illustrate what would be presumably an 
axtreme possibility for postponement of Fed-

the act and the date of publication in the 
,lPederal Register of the mandatory health

committees, With a State legislature meet-
ing biennially which does not convene until 
18 months after the Federal Register publica-
tion date, with a session lasting 4 months, a 
total of 43 months, or 3 years and 7 months 
Would elapse between the date of enactment 
of the act and the date at which Federal 
inspectors would acquire the authority to

draw and debar persons from mines where 
,in immediate or imminent danger of death 
or serious physical harm Is found to exist. 
The purpose nt delaying the effective date 
will 90 days after the close of the next State 
legislative session is to give the State legis-

itself of the opooriamity?to look at the 
mandatory standards designated by the See-

tion that may be required for establishment 
of. a State inspection and en forcement plan to

Section 13, espeelally (di, will delay the 
4,ffeetive and timely implementation of fpR,, 
1t95.9. It creates a no man's land between 
the Secretary of 'Interior and the several 
States. Delays, and indecision would be the 
order of the day. Instead of expediting 
health and safety for the miners it will serve 
to hamstring this ohlective. 
With the States having recourse to judicial 
review as to the actions of the Secretary, the 
No. 5S---7 
specter of frustrating delays is all too ap-
parent. 
The record as developed over the pest.dec-
ade leaves little to hope for as far as bringing 
about some degree of effective and uniform 
health and safety measures on the part of 
the States. 
We respectfully refer to page 167 ,?)f the 
hearings on mine safety, before the Select 
Subcommittee on Labor of the Committee on 
Education and Labor, House of Representa-
tives, 89th Congress, for a detailed staMment 
as to the failure of the States to improve their 
mine safety codes, if they have them, and 
bring some degree of safety to the miners 
through thorough inspections and training.

House of Representatives, on pages 4, 5, and 
6, sets fortis the many and various ftilures 
of the several States, as related to mine safe-
ty in the metallic and nonmetallic mires, 
We strongly urge the subcommittee to 
review the hearings that were held before the 
Select Subcommittee on Labor of the Com-
mittee on Education and Labor. Boone of 
Representatives, 87th Congress, pages :14-56. 
These individual reports are facts that can-
not be ignored and reveal the terrible i,lade-
quacies of Stale mine enforcement and in-
spection. 
The record will show that many of the 
States are reluctant to appropriate adequate 
amounts of money to insure enforcemcnt of 
their mining codes by their State F,:ilety 
agency or department. 
There is no assurance that under section 
13 the States will snake any effort to provide 
these funds, preferring to let well enough 
alone, and lot the Secretary of Interior take 
over all these functions. 
The gap between the legislative session of 
the State legislatures and the one given over 
to appropriations would only serve to con.. 
fuse and delay the putting into being the 
health a:nd safety measures that are needed 
now?not 2 or 4 years from now. 
Since its inception over 50 years age, the 
Bureau of Mines has had as one cf its ,nain 
objectives the promotion of health and -:eafe--
ty practices in this mining industry. This 
aim is being: accomplished. through < ifety 
education, first aid training, sechnical eon-
sultation, and safety inspection, of mine, in-
cluding specific recommendations for elimi-
nating or minimizing hazards. The Bureau 
staff is ready to assist In every possible way 
to prevent injury in mining operations 
The responsibility for mine safety in the 
metallic an.d nonmetallic field should be giv-
en to the one agency that has experienee in 
mening. The Bureau of Mines has the:, ex-
perience and knowledge. 
The Bureau is carrying out the inspeelion 
and enforcement of health, and safety st 1.11(1-
ards in all the coal mines of the Nation, em-
ploying more than 14 miners. That retron-
sibility was given in the 82d Congress 'wider 
Public Law 552, the Neel y-McConnell Act. 
This subcommittee referred favorably a hill, 
H.R. 3581, dealing with small coal mines to 
the standing committee on Labor and Edu-
cation in the 1st session of the 119th Congress. 
:rm. 3584 gives the Bureau responsibility 
for carrying out various provisions relating 
to health and safety. 
This bill has been favorably voted on by 
the Senate. 
'Phe responsibility for Federal action in 
health and safety activities has been estab-
lished in. many fields. Some of the more ob-
jective examples of this are such Federal 
activities in atomic energy, coal mines. in-
spection services of the Department of Agri-
culture, Food and Drug Act, and the :hip 
inspection service. 
All of labor, therefore, recommends Mat 
section 13 be amended as 'follows: 
'Sgc. 13. The Secretary shall previde that the 
7915 
major responsibility for administering the 
provisions of this Act shall be vested in the 
Bureau of Mines of the Department of the 
Interior. The Secretary acting through the 
Bureau shall have authority to appoint, sub-
ject to the civil service laws, such officer:, and 
employees as he may deem requisite fo-- the 
administration of this Act; and to pros Tine. 
powers: duties and responsibilities of all of-
ficers and employees engaged in the ad inn-
istration of this Act: Provided, hoLccrer, 
That to the maximum extent feasible, in the 
selection of persons for appointment as mine 
inspectors, no person shall be so selected un-
less he has the basic qualification of at least 
five years practical mining experience and 
in assigning mine inspectors to the inspec-
tion and investigation of individual mines, 
due consideration shall be given to I heir 
previous practical experience in the S' ate, 
district, or region, where such inspect,ons 
are to be made." 
This amendment will make for a more

The American Mining Congress has at; ted 
that seven in a hundred underground in ?tal 
miners can expect to be killed at work in a

The Bureau of Mines reports that for 
metals alone the period 1963-64 there was 
a sharp increase in fatalities in 1964 to a 
total of 59, 13 more than in 1963. Nonfatal 
disabilities also increased to 3,745 in 1964, 
compared with 3,485 in 1963. 
In October 1965 at the American Mining 
Congress Convention held at Las Vegas, Nev., 
Mr. Sidney S. Goodwin, vice president, the 
New Jersey Zinc Co., stated as follows: 
"You may or may not be aware of iani

PRICE AND WAGE CONTROLS 
Mr. PEARSON. Madam President, in 
a speech in this Chamber on March 29, 
1966, I proposed that the appropriate of-
ficials of the administration be invited 
to appear before an appropriate congres-
sional committee to explain the adminis-
tration's current policy of indirect price 
and wage controls. 
I argued that this was necessary for 
two principal reasons. First, despite the 
fact that the administration is engaged 
In an extensive price-wage fixing, the full 
Intentions of the administration have 
never been fully identified and the tech-
niques have never been adequately ex-
plained. Indeed, the administration has 
deliberately attempted on numerous oc-
casions to obscure from the American 
public its intentions and its methods. 
Second, a policy of indirect price and 
wage controls is very likely to result in 
numerous inequities and various groups 
in our society are likely to be forced to 
make sacrifices not demanded of others. 
Madam President, full and open de-
bate on this extremely important public 
policy which affects the vital interest of 
every individual in the group can no 
longer be delayed. Therefore, I had 
delivered to Senator JOHN L. MCCLELLAN, 
chairman of the Committee on Govern-
ment Operations, a letter requesting that 
this committee initiate hearings on the 
administration's indirect price and wage 
control policy. 
This is the same procedure now being 
followed in the House of Representatives 
seeking to find some definition of not 
only policies but the methods. 
Madam President, I want to empha-
size that I am not calling for imposition 
of mandatory controls at this time, nor 
am I saying that indirect controls should 
never be used. However, I am saying, 
and most emphatically, that because the 
decision to engage in indirect price and 
wage controls constitutes the making of 
a public policy of greatest importance, 
these decisions and their justifications 
must be subject to free and open debate. 
The Congress must be provided with an 
adequate explanation from the admin-
istration and must have the opportunity 
to approve, or reject, or modify the op-
eration of this policy. 
Madam President, these are the facts. 
The administration has been applying 
price and wage controls without any ex-
pressed consent of the Congress, and it 
Is applying these controls, as far as I can 
determine, without any standards or 
rules of Government intervention and 
without adequate consideration of their 
overall and selective economic impact. 
In this connection it would appear 
that the only rule or guideline that the 
administration is using is simply to ap-
ply pressure at those points where its 
enormous powers can be used most ef-
fectively. Thus, prices in some indus-
tries and businesses have been rolled 
back while other prices have advanced 
rapidly. For example, while there have 
been price roll backs in aluminum, cop-
per, steel and cigarettes, there have been 
price advances in such key areas as 
chemicals, plastics, TV tubes, gasoline, 
newsprint, and rubber tires. 
Some labor contracts have resulted 
in wage increases that are within the 
3.2 percent productivity guideline while 
other wages have gone beyond this 3.2 
percent increase. 
In illy statement of March 29, 1966, I 
expressed the concern that the adminis-
tration's undercover war on inflation was 
resulting in economic inequities particu-
larly in agricultural, and I identified sev-
eral areas in which the administration 
had acted to force down farm prices. 
Farm prices are indeed falling but 
there is absolutely no assurance that this 
is going to have any anti-inflation effect. 
Thus the result of these actions may well 
do nothing more than reduce the farm-
ers' already slim margin of profit. 
The Secretary of Agriculture, Orville 
Freeman, apparently took pleasure last 
week in announcing the decline in farm 
prices. As William M. Blair reported in 
the New York Times of March 31, 1966: 
It was the first time in the memory of Fed-
eral farm officials that a Secretary of Agricul-
ture indicated that he was pleased with a 
decrease in farm prices. 
I am just as concerned about inflation 
as Mr. Freeman, but I see nothing that is 
pleasing about the decline in farm prices. 
It is particularly disturbing to me that as 
farm prices are falling, the farmers' cost 
of production is rising. The Department 
of Agriculture report which showed a 
turndown in the prices received by the 
farmer also showed an increase in prices 
paid out by the farmer. Thus, the parity 
ratio dropped from 83 in February to 82 
in March. The price cost squeeze on the 
farmer is cutting deeper and deeper. 
Madam President, the farmers' eco-
nomic position has been weakened and 
the Administration is confidently pre-
dicting that farm prices wil continue to 
fall. In an article published in the 
Washington Post of April 3, 1966, John 
Schnittker, Undersecretary of Agricul-
ture, predicted that farm prices will drop 
another 10 percent in the near future. 
The adniinistration can make these 
predictions with confidence because it 
has the power to force such a rollback. 
But Madam President, the farmers and 
the Congress want to know if the admin-
istration can also keep the lid on prices 
paid by farmers and also if lower farm 
prices will ever mean lower retail food 
prices. 
I see no evidence to date that suggests 
that either of these will occur. Mr. 
Freeman has expressed the hope that 
lower farm prices will be reflected in 
lower retail prices. But the experience 
of past history is not at all encouraging 
on this score. 
7255 
Last Friday the distinguished Senator 
from South Dakota [Mr. McGovERN] ex-
pressed the belief that recent administra-
tion actions in milk price supports "have 
been carefully tailored not to assure fair 
returns to the farmer but to avoid any 
actual increase in consumer prices." 
This appears to be the case not only 
In regard to milk but also in regard to 
other agricultural products. Farm 
prices are frozen or rolled back while 
farm costs continue to rise and consumer 
prices continue to move upward. 
In my statement of March 29, 1966, 
I pointed out that the rollback in cattle 
hide prices did not prevent a subsequent 
increase in shoe prices. But several 
days after major shoe companies had 
announced major price increases the 
Secretary of Agriculture was quoted in 
the Christian Science Monitor of April 
1, 1966, as saying "the housewife should 
be able to save on a pair of shoes as a 
result" of the administration's drastic 
export limitations on skins and hides. 
This is exactly the type of thing that 
makes it vitally important that the ad-
ministration's indirect price and wage 
control policy be brought into the open 
and submitted to full and searching de-
bate. The Congress must be an active 
participant in this debate. It is im-
perative, therefore, that congressional 
hearings be initiated as soon as possible. 
Mr. PEARSON. Madam President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to call 
the roll. 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that the order 
for the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. With-
out objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. FULBRIGHT. Madam President, 
during the recent hearings held by the

think can come out of this Honolulu con-
ference. 
Senator Cunneen I hope that greater em-
phasis will be given to the economic and 
political side of the war in Vietnam RR a 
result of this conference. I think that an 
tntensification of the war, given the circum-
iitances, is also inevitable; but I would hope 
that it does not take the form of broad-
ening the war front or widening the war 
horn. in Vietnam. 
Mr. McBEE. Does it not take some of the 
izenatorial heat, and accompanying press cov-
erage oft of the administration at this par-
ticular time? 
Senator Cnoricu. Well, It may have that 
effect for the next few days because naturally 
and properly, the President is the principal 
focus of the news, and the coverage he will 
receive in Hawaii will be very thorough and 
complete, but I think the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee hearings, which are meant 
to continue considerably beyond that time) 
will get the attention that they ought to get, 
and I am not concerned on that score. 
Mr. CHAPMAN, Senator CHURCH, on his 
arrival in Honolulu the President said as 
part of his remarks, "There are special plead-
ers Who counsel retreat in Vietnam, they be-
long' to a group that has always been blind 
to experience and deaf to hope." Do you 
think this is the way the President regards 
his critics on Capitol Hill, you among them? 
Senator (Menem I would not think so, be-
noise I do not know of any here on Capitol 
hill who have advocated retreat in Vietnam. 
If there are any, they are very few and far 
between. and I certainly am not one. He 
may have been referring to some of the dem-
onstrators who have gone very far in pro-
testing 'the war. I would think that he did 
not have in mind responsible critics, because 
if it were his purpose to silence responsible 
criticism. this would be the stifling of free-
dom right here in America, and I cannot 
tinitgine that the President would have any-
thing like that in mind. 
Mr. CHAPMAN. Well, in answering report-
ers' questions at the White House, after he 
,ahnounced onFriday he was going to Hono-
lulu, he seemed to refer to your hearings as 
"a show." Do you think the criticisms 
being made up here are falling on deaf ears? 
Senator CEIURCII. I cannot say what the 
President's attitude may be in that respect 
I should think, however, that he would be 
interested in the inquiry that the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee is making and 
that this would form a part of his continuing 
appraisal of the situation. I should not 
think that be would want to isolate himself 
in the Whi ficiniie with a e.ertein. coterie of 
handpicked advisers, all of whom reflect his 
own opinion about the war: and for that 
reazion I would hope that he would give seri-
ous attention to these proceedings in the 
Senate committee, and any other proceed-
ings here on Capitol Hill that are directed 
toward a thorough examination of the prem-
tees thaS underlie the war and the objective, 
the ultimate objective that we have in mind 
out there. 
Mr. CHAPMAN, Senator CHURCH, do VOU, 
1,niiik the President is carrying out what 
Obinsetion he has, to answer these basic ques-
tions that are being raised himself, as op-
posed to making exhortatory speeches about 
time war effort? 
Minator CHT -RCM I think that it is a part 
of the evil of war. I suppose you could say, 
that the further a country becomes em-
broiled, the greater the degree of emotion. 
It natural enough, we have got 200.000 
boys out there now and it is becoming in-
creasingly difficult to take El dispassionate 
view of the war; and the larger the Amer-
heir; military commitment becomes, the 
greater the danger becomes to the country: 
and the longer the casualty lists grow, the 
more difficult it will be to remain unemo-
tional about the war. I should think this 
would be perhaps the highest responsibility 
of the Presidency; to set the tone that will 
permit us to continue to be objective and 
rational about American policy in Vietnam. 
Mr. McBEE. Senator Cii URCH. do you think 
thal, the President had any recour?e, from a 
military standpoint, but to resume bombing 
North Vietnam? 
Senator CHUncn. I think that from a 
military standpoint the resumption may 
have been indicated. The question of how 
long the suspension should have been con-
tinued was not a military one bu a diplo-
matic one. Obviously, the bombing has 
failed to achieve the military objectives 
that were once proclaimed for it. it has not 
cut oil the continuing supply of the Vietcong 
from the North. It may have ha; assed the 
supply lines, but obviously they have con-
tinued and in fact the Vietcong has grown 
very much stronger during the period that 
the bombings have been underway-, so that 
the military objectives of the bombing have 
not succeeded. I think that by reinstituting 
them we merely want to commence again 
the kind of harassment that makes the 
supply routes more dangerous iind more 
difficult. 
Mr. ALMBEE. Well, is it because of the 
danger of Red China, do you think, that 
heavier bombardment is not being employed 
and populations are not being deetroyed? 
Senator CHURCH, Well I think that there 
are several reasons for this. In the first 
place, North Vietnam is a rural country. 
We could strike the cities, we could destroy 
Hanoi, and we could destroy Haiphong, their 
major port. But, if we destromd their 
cities and all their industry this amounts 
to less than 10 percent of the tot el produc-
tion of their economy, and the government 
in Hanoi could resort once again to the 
countryside and the resistance vemld con-
tinue, so this will not, I think break the 
back of Hanoi. It will not force them to the 
negotiating table, It will not aecomplish 
what we hope to accomplish; namely, a 
political settlement of the war in Vietnam. 
On the other hand, it could intensify their 
determination to persist in the war, and it 
could, of course, increase the de lager of a 
Chinese decision to come down. We have to 
remember, our memories are not to be so 
short as to lead us to forgot our experience in 
Korea when the Chineae did come down 
after we had reached a certain point in the 
extension of that war northward toward the 
Chinese frontiers. I think there'; a, plate-
glass window up there somewhere ....we don't 
know exactly where it as, but it we con-
tinue to expand the dimension of the war 
northward. at some print we're going to 
break that window, and when we So. I think 
we rem expect the Chinese to respond as they 
responded in Korea, when they poured 
down over the Yalu Riven with 600.000 men. 
Mr. McBsri. Senator, to you ever have a 
feeling that the inclination- amour some of 
the U.S. military now is to take on China 
now, to bring them in if possible, before they 
hare atomic delivery cannbilities? 
Senator Cuuneu. Well, I would hope that 
this is not seriously intended by the military. 
I cannot, say whether there is any advocacy 
within the military itsel f of such a policy, 
But T remember about 15 years ago when 
there was considerable argument on behalf 
of a preventive war against the Soviet Union, 
and it was said then that we will cether have 
to fight the Soviet Union now or iater, it is 
better to fight her now than later. I am 
glad that counsel did not prevail :15 years 
ago, and I think that the same counsel 
ought not to prevail now I canal; t imagine 
a war that would involve a greater tragedy 
for the United States, that would involve a 
larger number of casualties, and that in the 
end would lead to such frustration as a war 
with China. No nation in history has man-
aged to conquer China, are we now going to 
undertake what all other i;ountries have tried 
and failed to do for centuries and iienturies 
in the past? People who think ithat a war 
against China will merely consist 01 sending 
a few bombing planes over and destroying 
her nuclear plants are just deceiving them-
selves and the country. That is just the 
opening overture in such a war. Eventually, 
the only way that China can be conquered 
is for land armies to invade and occupy 
China. This means conquering an area 
larger than any other in the world, save 
Russia; and a population of 750 miliion peo-
ple in a body to body confrontation. Now, 
I do not know anything at the present that 
requires us to engage in such a Ii lcscaust, 
and I would certainly hope that rational 
leadership will prevail against any counsel. 
if it does exist, to extend this war in Asia 
to the point where we find ourselves en-
gaged against China on the opposite side of 
the world. I cannot believe that Ude is in-
tended by the administration. I an certain 
that the President is endeavoring in every 
way possible to keep the war in Vietnam 
within manageable limits.

jective in Vietnam is a political settlement, 
could we promote that objective by recog-
nizing Vietcong as an agent at the bargain. 
hag table? 
Senator CHURCH. I think that ;lie only 
way we are likely to get to the le rgaining 
table is by engaging the Vietcong directly in 
preliminary talks that might lead ft a-politi-
cal settlement. 
Mr. CHAPMAN. Right now? 
Senator Cifuncx. I think that the sooner 
that this is done, the better. I kninv of Tic 
war that has ever been settled witneut en-
gaging the combatants, and obviously the 
Vietcong is the largest single element in 
South Vietnam against which our terces arc 
now deployed. 
Mr. CHAPMAN. But the thing the I. we arc 
fighting against is the domination of South, 
Vietnam by the Vietcong. Now shouldn't ars 
role for the Vietcong be a concession we make 
during the negotiating process mil not in 
advance of it? 
Senator CHURCH. Of course, and I think 
that this country would oppose, and certainly 
I would oppose, any settlement that delivered 
over South Vietnam into the control of the 
Vietcong. I am merely saying that the Viet-
cong need to be engaged in conversation: 
with other non-Communist elements jr 
South Vietnam, looking toward the possi-
bility of establishing some form 01 interior 
regime which would restore order and super-
vise the conduct of elections that could ulti-
mately determine the political character ul 
the regime in South Vietnam. 
Mr. CHAPMAN. Well, Hanoi is mincing tin; 
as a sticking point at this time, we muse 
recognize the National Liberation Front, tilt 
Vietcong, as the spokesman for South Viet-
nam. Do you feel that if we did eic,me SODA' 
way toward it that Hanoi might not point 
some other sticking point because of the ii 
feeling that they can't conquer South Viet-
nam? 
Senator CHURCH. There is no 1- etairailig 
that the Communists will come to the bar-
gaining table under any circumstances. :But 
It would seem to me it would be it irealittaz 
for the United States to overlook the peoptc 
who are principally engaged in tbe war ir 
South Vietnam against the Vietnamese that 
we support there. I do not think that tht 
United States as a government can open en 
conversations with the Vietcong. But I Se 
think that the Vietnamese who are involece 
against the Vietcong should be encouraged 
to open up conversations to cleterminf 
whether or not some basis can be found Re 
a political settlement in South Vietnammi 
which would of course be consistent with 
the commitment that we have made to the 
Saigon government. I think it is unrealistic.

the people who are themselves involved in 
the battle and who are each day dying in 
large-numbers, and to assume a posture that 
permits us to talk only to some other gov-
ernment, whether it be Hanoi, or whether 
it be Peking, or Moscow. I think that is the 
least likely way to reach the conference table. 
Mr. McBEs. Do you think, sir, the Saigon 
government can talk independently to the 
Vietcong, apart from Hanoi? 
Senator Crrtracx. I think that definitely, 
that there are non-Communist elements in 
South Vietnam that should be encourged 
to open up conversations, preliminary con-
versations, in the hope that this might lead 
to* a more formal conference at which all 
elements could be represented. I should 
think that this might permit Hanoi then to 
back up the Vietcong, while we backed up 
the non-Communist elements and would put 
neither side in the position of appearing to 
be backtracking upon pledges made. The 
problem that we have in South Vietnam, our 
determination not to backtrack on our 
pledges, is similar in ways, I suspect, to 
pledges that it has made in support of the 
Vietcong. Therefore, the best way to reach 
a conference is to engage the fighting ele-
ments in the field. Suppose during our own 
revolutionary war that the British had taken 
the position that they would deal only with 
the French, and not talk at all with George 
Washington? The French had more troops 
at Yorktown than Washington had conti-
nentals. Obviously, it is not realistic to ex-
pect negotiations to commence which do not 
involve the principal participants In the 
fight. And yet, up till now this has been the 
American posture. 
Mr. McBEE. Do you think, sir, during Pres-
ident Johnson's peace offensive there was a 
serious breakdown or lack of liaison with 
Saigon? Marshal Ky said that certain of the 
military might attempt to overthrow him at 
any moment, there was very little notice 
given to the Saigon regime that the Presi-
dent was about to conduct this worldwide 
peace offensive. 
Senator CHURCH. Well, that I really am 
not competent to say. I do not know what 
notice was given to Saigon, I do know that 
the Saigon government is dependent entirely 
upon the United States for its sustenance, 
for a long time it depended utterly upon us 
for our money, now it depends on us for our 
men. If it must depend upon us to fight its 
war, then I think that we ought not to be 
handcuffed in our efforts to reach a satis-
factory peace. 
Mr. McBEE. On the other hand, sir, might 
you infuriate the Saigon regime by treating 
them as something of a junior partner in 
their own country? 
Senator CHURCH. I am sure that the Presi-
dent has not done this, and the very fact 
that he is now conferring with the chiefs of 
the Saigon regime in Hawaii, confirms, I 
think, all of the recognition and all of the 
prestige that the President of the United 
States can give to this regime. 
Mr. CHAPIVIAN. Senator CHURCH, I gather 
that your basic point of view on the way to 
settle the Vietnam war is attuned to your 
feeling that we have exaggerated the impact 
of communism within the revolution that is 
going on there, as elsewhere, and that we 
have really no right and certainly no wisdom 
to go in after every revolution, including this 
one, because there are Communist elements 
or even a possibility of Communist domina-
tion. Is that your point of view? 
Senator CHURCH. My point of view is this: 
I think that the United States has an inter-
est in doing all that it can to discourage the 
spread of communism in the underdeveloped 
world. I think, however, that American mil-
itary intervention more often than not May 
turn out to be less of a deterrent to the 
spread of communism than a stimulant. 
Mr. CHAPNIAN. Is that true in Vietnam? 
Senator CHURCH. I am afraid in Vietnam 
that our decision to convert the war, more 
and more, into an American war, pitting 
hundreds of thousands of white Western 
troops, imported from the opposite side of 
the world, against Oriental troops in the 
Orient makes the war appear to many 
Asians to be an attempt on the part of a 
Western nation to reassert political control 
over the affairs of an Asian country. Now, 
we know this is not our intention. But the 
important question is: How do the Asians 
see it? And I am afraid that the reason that 
Mao Tse-tung is so much opposed to the 
settlement of this war and so anxious for 
the war to continue is not because he thinks 
that the Hanoi government can defeat the 
United States of America, but because he 
feels that the continuation of the war will 
assist China in her larger interests in Asia 
and will have more effect in spreading com-
munism elsewhere in Asia than a negotiated 
settlement would have. I think it is a great 
misfortune that we did not better appreciate 
Mao Tse-tung's view of this war some years 
ago. I think he has ensnared us in a trap 
which he obviously feels serves China's in-
terest. We must remember in this part of 
the world that after two centuries of colo-
nial experience, the thing that is most feared 
by Asian people is Western imperialism, not 
communism as such; and in the lands that 
I have visited, many of the lands in this 
region of the world, it is capitalism, not com-
munism that is the ugly word. Because 
they haven't known our kind of capitalism, 
they have only known the kind that was 
associated with their old colonial experience. 
So when we move into South Vietnam with a 
large Western army, this permits the Com-
munists to say that the government we sup-
port is merely a puppet of Western imperial-
ism. It permits China to pose in the role 
that she most wants to be accepted in among 
her Asian countries. Namely, the role of 
champion of Asia for the Asians. And it 
helps to identify communism with the one 
nationalist aspiration that dominates the 
feeling of most people in Asia, it helps to 
identify communism with the effort to ex-
pel Western imperialism or colonialism from 
Asia. Now that is a losing cause, I think, 
and that is the reason why Mao Tse-tung is 
so anxious to see this war continue. 
Mr. CHAPIVIAN. Senator CHURCH, in a quar-
ter of a minute, how do we prevent Thailand 
from becoming another Vietnam? 
Senator CHURCH. The best way is by not 
permitting the Thai Government to become 
accusable of being another puppet of the 
United States. 
Mr. CHAPMAN. Thank you for 
with 
us on "From the Capital."  
EDITORIAL COMMENT BY JOHN S. 
KNIGHT 
? 
Mr. PITLBRIGHT. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent that four ex-
cellent editorials written by the distin-
guished editor and publisher, Mr. John S. 
Knight, be printed at this point in the 
RECORD. Mr. Knight is one of the most 
experienced and knowledgeable ob-
servers of the American and world scenes 
today. He is also one of those unusual 
publishers who writes editorials which 
give to his newspapers an unusual in-
terest and zest. 
There being no objection, the edi-
torials were ordered to be printed in the 
RECORD, as follows: 
[From the Detroit (Mich.) Free Press, 
Feb. 13, 1966] 
THE EDITOR'S NOTEBOOK: NATION SEES IN VIET 
POLICY ARBITRARY DISPLAY OF POWER 
(By John S. Knight) 
It is often said that Lyndon Baines John-
son is a complex and baffling individual. 
This understatement was never more 
clearly illustrated than in the President's 
actions of the last 2 weeks. Prior to the 
recent Honolulu Conference, Mr. Johnson 
was wooing the doves of peace by insisting 
that we wanted no more than an honorable 
truce in Vietnam. 
The President also urged that the Vietnam 
war be placed on the agenda of the United 
Nations Security Council for discussion and 
possible U.N. action. 
By these moves, Mr. Johnson clarified our 
position and won world approval as he skill-
fully placed responsibility for continuance 
of the war on Hanoi and Peking. 
Yet 1 week later, the scene was shifted and 
the President spoke from another stage. 
This time he was in Honolulu where he 
assured Premier Nguyen Ca,o Ky and Chair-
man Nguyen Van Thieu that the United 
States is irrevocably committed both to the 
defense of South Vietnam and a social revo-
lution designed to solve its problems of 
hunger, ignorance, and disease. 
Furthermore, the U.S. military buildup in 
Vietnam will double this year and may in-
crease to 600,000 in 1967. 
"The road ahead," said the President, "may 
be long and difficult. But we shall prevail." 
General Ky and his entourage were greatly 
encouraged by these pledges, as well they 
might be. They had succeeded beyond their 
most optimistic expectations. 
So there you have it, stroking the ruffled 
feathers of the doves one week and sharpen-
ing the claws and beaks of the hawks on the 
next. 
As James Reston has said so succinctly: 
"The President has recently been giving the 
impression that he is not following a clear 
strategic policy, but that he is thrashing 
about, rejecting peace offensives and then 
trying them, stopping bombing and then 
starting bombing, rejecting the U.N. and then 
appealing to the U.N., sending Vice President 
HUMPHREY to brief Asian leaders on the Hon-
olulu conference which he did hot attend?
all in an atmosphere of restless experimenta-
tion and self-righteous condemnation of 
anybody who differs with him." 
My own analysis is that President John-
son?ever the strong and prideful one?is 
showing marked impatience over our failure 
to achieve significant military victories in 
Vietnam. 
And so, unlike the Government of France 
which gave only limited support to their 
forces in 1954 and saw them fall at Dienbien-
phu, President Johnson is prepared to rout 
and defeat the enemy without regard to the 
size and cost of our commitment. 
In a word, the President characteristically 
rejects any thought of failure. If and when 
the United States sits down at a negotiating 
table, it will be on Johnson's terms and be-
cause he is the victor. 
No, I don't think the President is running 
a bluff. He will continue to talk of peace, 
but his implacable determination to make 
war unrewarding for the Vietcong and the 
North Vietnamese seems now to be an in-
disputable fact. 
Where all of this rapidly escalating in-
volvement will lead is a matter of conjecture. 
Entrance of the Red Chinese, as in Korea? 
A rift with Russia? Nuclear war? Who 
really knows? 
What a shocking thing it is that the small 
involvement which began as economic as-
sistance with a few hundred U.S. advisers

President Johnson's new foreign aid ap-
proach is to be concentrated on countries 
that "are not, hostile to us and give solid 
evidence that they arc determined to help 
themselves." 
This is welcome realism, but don't count 
mein seeing it happen. 
Contrary to general belief, Lt. Gen. James 
M. Gavin (retired) did not advocate the 
holding of enclaves in Vietnam to the ex-
clusion of all other alternatives. It Was 
Generals Gavin end Matthew Ridgway who 
persuaded General Eisenhower not to com-
mit IT S. farces to Indochina when. Vice Pres-
ident Nixon was urging that course in 1951. 
In his meninirs, General Ridgway said this: 
"When the day comes for me to fare my 
maker and account for my actions, the thing 
won Id be roost humbly proud of was the 
lact that I bit lit against, and perhaps con-
hoted to preventing, the carrying out of

Yet it did happen, less than 10 years 
later, when there were no longer any Gavins 
or etidgways with the courage to oppose the 
civilian "generals" in power. 
A Washington newsletter reports that Fed-
eral officials are trying quietly to figure

believe we will have any left.

PUBLISHER'S NOTEBOOK: VIETNAM Di :BATE LATE 
BUT GRAVELY NEEDED 
(By John S. Knight) 
.ANswaiis, AT LAST 
The Senate hearings on. the war ii Vietnam 
are OrOVIdin ET, the American people with sorely 
needed information on he backftround of 
our involvement and the possible pe 35 which 
lie ahead. 
For the first time, we are get- Mg both 
opinion a" ii fact from competent a,ithorities 
Who have tether dealt with the la nblem at 
firrithand or whose long experiem o in the 
military and diplomatic fields ens) lasthem 
to see a local war in a global contett. 
This is rot to say that the revel:: laons are 
new. Newspapers and megazines which are 
dedicated to the principle that an informed 
public govt ms best, have f itithfully iiorierayed 
each and every development leadit g to our 
present position in southeast Asia. 
And yet, despite millions of words ale-tures, 
maps, interpretation, and editorial eamment, 
the Vietnam picture has remained unclear 
and imprecise. 
TRUTH, NOT THEORY 
ThalightHII discussion is often oh .2-lared by 
simplistic theories which apnea,' logical 
enough if not carefully examined. Thus we 
have the "win or get out" school of thought, 
the "victory" squad led by Barry Goldwater 
who now charges President John on with 
"groveling" before the enemy, and the "Nix-
onites" who favor "doing more" but stop short 
of advocating all-out war, 
We have seen, too, the :3uperpatti eta who 
would deny the right of dissent and who ap-
pear to believe that any citizens Wm ques-
tion the wisdom of our course are oowardly 
and lacking in patriotism. 
So it was a good day for our coup ry when 
Senator J.. WILLIAM FULBRIGHT, chaaanan of 
the Foreign Relations Caom mittee, decided to 
stage a full-scale review of the 'Vietnam 
problem in an unrelenting search for truth. 
SENATE WAS SILENT 
The hour is late, as Senator FULDP,;:CHT has 
conceded. Eve:n as the peril mour ted, the 
august Semite was meekly bowing to the 
President's will when it should ht vii been 
challenging the wisdom of his policios. 
Only Se aators GRUEN:ENG, of Alaska, 
MORSE, of Oregon, McGovaaN, of South Da-
kota, runes:mar, of Arkansas, CHCRCH, of 
Idaho, MCCARTHY, of Minnesota, MAINSFIELD, 
of Montana.. CLARK, of Pennsylvar iii-, and 
GORE, of Tennessee, expressed either their 
reservations concerning Vietnam policy or 
their opposition to it. 
Since no Republican men iber of t1L Senate 
could find his tongue there was no najor de-
bate on Vietnam in what was once called 
the greatest deliberative body in the world. 
The information which might hire been 
brought to the American people several years 
ago was tragically delayed as the administra-
tion literally smothered all oppositiem with 
optimistic and meaningless offici ,1 pro-
nouncements on how well the war Was pro-
gressing. 
A DEBT WE OWE 
But late as it is, the Fulbright committee 
is now tearing away the veil of secnocy and 
performing a notable public service for the 
country. 
The televised hearings imove proe 'iced a 
needed challenge to the administration,. a di-
versity of views from eminent authorities 
and a broader comprehension of the total 
situation. 
It has been a long, long time since both the 
chairman of the Foreign Relations Cianmit-
tee and the majority leader have been iit 
odds with the President on major policies 
Mr. Johnson is known to be ci .wnright

PERSONALITIES 
Senator WAYNE MORSE, the most r dentless 
critic of administration policies In Vietnam, 
is a former dean and professor of law who 
was first elected as a Republican 1. at later 
switched to the Democratic Party. 
He is a strong supporter of the United 
Nations and believes the United lit; tes is 
acting in violation of international law. 
Senator MORSE, a confirmed maverick, is a 
blunt and merciless questioner wl o often. 
dilutes his effectiveness by resorting to ex-

Senator J. WILLIAM FULBRIGHT, 
scholar and former university president, Mu; 
a mind which "encompasses everything." 
He has been critical of U.S. intervention in 
both Vietnam and the Dominican Republic. 
An ideal presiding officer, Senator Fla,-
BRIGHT is ever courteous, a disarming inter-
rogator, and a convincing low-key speaker. 
He arid President Johnson have bun long-
time Senate friends. 
Senator RUSSELL B. LONG, son of the 
famous or infamous Huey, has been moving 
Up in the Democratic power structare and 
serves as acting majority leader In the ab-

He is a stanch defender of Johnson's poli-
cies, an arm-waving orator who said last 
Wednesday that he "swells with pen e when 
he sees Old Glory and prays he shall never 
see a white flag of surrender." 
Senators KARL MUNDT and BOLIEKI: RICK - 
ENLOOPER are conservative Midwest republi-
cans who have generally supported the ad-
ministration on Vietnam but appear to be 
thinking of how the Republicans ca ii capi-
talize on an unpopular war in 1966. 
Senator GEORGE ASKEW, Republican, of Ver-
mont, is known as the "owl" in a mixed 
cote of doves and hawks. The Senator is 
Well respected for his fairness and judicial 
temperament, as is Senator Join/ Sonar:mare, 
Democrat, of Alabama, who was Adlai Steven-
son's Vice-Presidential running mate ,n 1952. 
General Maxwell Taylor, former chief of

15 months. 
The McNamara-Taylor reports of several 
years ago on the war's progress prove ii to be 
extravagantly optimistic. 
George Kennan, long a career diplomat 
and former Ambassador to Russia, and Yugo-

war. He believes, as do many military ex-
perts, that Vietnam is a poor staging area 
for a major conflict.

THE EDITOR'S NOTEBOOK: GREAT DEBATE OVER 
VIETNAM HAS SERVED THE NATION WELL 
(By John S. Knight) 
The great debate over Vietnam is produc-
ing some welcome results. 
For the first time since our unfortunate 
involvement began more than 10 years ago, 
the American public is beginning to under-
stand the full significance of our role in 
southeast Asia and the nature of our so-called 
commitments. 
It has been the fashion to deplore teach-
ins, street demonstrations against the war, 
and the writings of those who have differed 
with administration policies, 
Yet these protests have served a useful 
purpose. For there is today a public aware-
ness that the Vietnam problem has many 
facets and no simple solutions. 
The Senate hearings conducted by Chair-
man J. W. PULBRIGHT, of the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, brought to the Nation the 
views of able and scholarly men with wide 
experience in global relations. 
We can be proud that our country is served 
by Generals Gavin and Taylor, the broad 
knowledge of former Ambassador George 
Kennan and the lucid expositions of Secre-
tary of State Dean Rusk. 
And, with an exception or two, the Sena-
tors who conducted the interrogations posed 
questions which were pertinent and direct. 
Whether one agrees or finds fault with in-
dividual testimony is not so important as the 
fact that every American citizen had the rare 
privilege of hearing a full exposition of the 
Vietnam war from all viewpoints for the first 
time since U.S. military participation readhed 
major proportions. 
Until the Senate hearings, the objectors to 
Government policies were held in contempt 
as being either flaky or downright un-
patriotic. 
But no such charges could be brought 
against Gen. James M. Gavin, paratroop 
commander in World War II and former U.S. 
Ambassador to France. 
Nor did they apply to George Kennan, a 
former Ambassador to Russia and the archi-
tect of our "containment" concept in the 
cold war with Moscow. 
Such men, along with Senator FULBRIGHT 
and a handful of Democratic Senators who 
dared to defy the all-powerful Lyndon John-
son, spoke with courage and conviction. 
And yet there are some superheated patri-
ots among us who find the Senate "disguist-
hag" and charge the Fulbright committee 
with "giving aid, comfort, and -information 
to the enemy." 
One such is a Mr. Frederick J. Read, of 
Grand Rapids, who would bring the press, 
NBC, and the Fulbright committee into 
court to show reason why they. should not 
be tried for treason. 
The Reads and those of his persuasion 
forget that the purpose of the Fulbright 
hearings is to enable our citizenry to becorne 
better informed on Vietnam and that such 
a clearing away of misconceptions is vital to 
a healthy democracy. 
The charge of traitorous conduct is un-
worthy of a reply other than to remind Mr. 
Read that the United States is not officially 
at war. 
A free nation could not long endure in a 
climate of no dissent. Only dictators flour-
ish for a time in those unhappy lands where 
freedom of expression is shackled by the 
State. 
The Fulbright hearings were long overdue. 
For years, the August Senate sat in silence 
as administration spokesmen in Washington 
and Saigon brainwashed the American pub-
lic with optimistic pronouncements which 
bore little or no resemblance to the truth. 
One need only to recall the fatuous state-
ments by Ambassador Lodge and the Mc-
Namara-Taylor reports to President Ken-
nedy to understand how completely we were 
misled on the progress of the war. 
Had it not been for the dissenters, the 
studied conclusions of Senate Leader MIKE 
MANSFIELD and the Fulbright hearings, we 
might still be searching in vain for the truth., 
President Johnson, who bridles at opposi-
tion in any form, is reported to have watched 
the televised Senate hearings with avid in-
terest. He should have been pleased since 
Gen. Maxwell Taylor and Secretary Dean 
Rusk, reflecting administration policies un-
der merciless questioning, came off very well 
indeed. 
It appears, however, that the President 
is now harkening to the voices of dissent. 
At least he senses the need for a clarifica-
tion of administration policies. 
Thus he gave the country needed reassur-
ance in his Freedom House speech by stating 
that the United States was not caught in a 
"blind escalation of force" which might lead 
to a vast conflict with Communist China. 
Bill D. Moyers, the White House press sec-
retary, told reporters that the President did 
not intend the speech to be an answer to his 
critics or a denunciation of those who dis-
agree. 
But had It not been for the critics, it is 
an open question as to whether Mr. Johnson 
would have declared himself against a wider 
involvement with such evident emphasis. 
Of course the larger question is whether 
a wider war can ultimately be avoided since 
we have ample evidence at hand that "small 
wars" often lead to major confrontations. 
Nevertheless, the President's address pro-
vided a partial and long-sought exposition 
of policy. 
The great debate over Vietnam has served 
us well. 
RANDOM NOTES 
The administration's reaction to Senator 
ROBERT KENNEDY'S first statements about 
bringing the South Vietnamese and indig-
enous Vietcong into a coalition government 
is a good example of Potomac confusion. 
Vice President HUBERT HUMPHREY ridiculed 
this idea as akin to "putting a fox in a 
chicken coop * * * an arsonist in the fire 
department." But in the Senate hearings, 
Secretary of State Dean Rusk insisted that 
the United States would stand for free elec-
tions in Vietnam and accept the result. The 
outcome of such elections could mean pre-
cisely such a coalition as KENNEDY originally 
mentioned. 
President Nasser of Egypt, who once told 
Americans they "could drink sea water" if 
they didn't like his policies, is at it again. 
Nasser, who has received millions in Ameri-
can assistance, is now assailing U.S. military 
aid to Israel and threatens a "preventive 
war." 
Sukarno of Indonesia is another recipient 
of our favors who never misses an opportu-
nity to blast the United States. We deserve 
him since the Truman administration en-
couraged the Netherlands to yield their 
sovereignty to Sukarno in 1949. 
Just before the death of Fleet Adm. Chester 
Nimitz, he warned that Japan will remain 
friendly to the United States "just so long as 
that friendship profits Japan." 
The admiral predicted that whenever the 
Japanese feel they can do better elsewhere, 
they will do it, and that "includes an alli-
ance or trade agreements with Red China." 
At some stage, Japan could become a fac-
tor in the Vietnam struggle since she is 
known to be unhappy over the possibility of 
an enlarged war. 
The current agitation in Congress to force 
safety improvements in automobiles is com-
mendable, but how does one cope with 
drunken drivers, others with weak eyes, and 
poor reflexes and car-happy kids who "own" 
the rood? 
You can't pad sense into people.

THE PUBLISHERS NOTEBOOK: GREAT DEBATE 
UNCOVERS A arum NEW BRINK 
(By John S. Knight) 
RANT VERSUS REASON 
No responsible editorialist enjoys belabor-
ing Government policies merely for the sake 
of controversy. Unbridled and irresponsible 
criticism can be as harmful to the national 
interest as remaining silent when it is being 
endangered. 
The great debate over Vietnam is a case 
in point. Senator WAYNE MORSE, of Oregon, 
is one of the courageous few who has con-
sistently challenged the validity of our in-
volvement in southeast Asia. Yet he often 
unhorse,s himself when engaging in ill-tem-
pered bombast. 
By contrast, Senator J. W. PULBRIGHT, Of 
Arkansas, is even tempered, judicial, and a 
model of propriety as he interrogates the wit-
nesses who appear before the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee. 
There are likewise journalists who rant and 
fume in columns of lint-picking, captious 
criticism. They become largely ineffective 
since they persuade no one, but only harden 
the beliefs of those who already agree. 
Responsible writers of opinion do not lack 
conviction. But they prefer the use of facts, 
logic, and analysis to make their case. Not 
as exciting, perhaps, but decidely more in-
formative and trustworthy. 
Being human, both the politicians and 
members of the press can be arbitrary, 
capricious, petty, and illogical. Or, they 
may be fair, objective, analytical and zeal-
ously devoted to the search for truth. 
The Senate hearings on Vietnam have re-
vealed both the bellicose traits of a few 
and the even dignity and composure of the 
many. In journalism, with notable excep-
tions, the comment has been vigorous and 
well reasoned. 
THE ULTIMATE GOAL 
As Senator FULBRIGEIT now concedes, the 
public debate on Vietnam came several years 
too late. Yet it has been productive if only 
because the Johnson administration is now 
aware of the boiling disent and the chal-
lenge to its policies. 
Senator PITLBRIGHT'S oomrnittee has pro-
vided a badly needed, full-scale review of the 
Vietnam situation. This has been most 
helpful to a confused American public which 
seeks nothing more than clarification of our 
aims and ultimate objectives. 
Within recent days, it has been illuminat-
ing to learn that even as we fight an un-
declared war in Vietnam, the ultimate goal 
is the containment of Red China. 
Defense Secretary McNamara and Vice 
President HUBERT HUMPHREY have said as 
much in interviews and appearances before 
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
So the "little war" of a few years ago 
which we were told was being fought to resist 
aggression and protect the liberty-loving 
South Vietnamese is now a major exerci se in 
power politics.

-U.S. SPOTLIGHT ON CHINA 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Madam President,

at this point in the RECORD an article-, 
entitled "Now U.S. Spotlight Turns on 
China," written by Frederic Collins, and 
published in the London Sunday Times 
of recent date. 
There being no objection, the article

Tee focus of debate now is shifting to 
China from the Vietnam war. Senator Pith-
:adorer begins public hearings on China on 
Tuesday before the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee and will extend them over sev-
eral. weeks. There is every prospect that they 
will conic to command attention as serious 
and intense as those he held on the war 
tele f. 
The transfer of interest is general. Offi-
cial comment, public and private, is begin-
ning to center on China, as is public discus-
:Mina The debate on the war has at least 
temporarily exhausted itself, leaving opin-
ion seemingly still divided between majority 
etipport for President Johnson and an ir-
reconcilable minority of opposition, appar-
ently not growing at the moment. 
The change in debate reflects the sense 
of a need to find a policy on China which 
can be clearly understood by the public and 
win its support. The curious fact that such 
a policy does not new exist is explained by 
the involvement of the China issue in the 
most vicious kind of idedlogical publics over 
at least two decades. 
Proponents of almost any course c ther than 
uncompromising hostility toward Commu-
nist Chins became the oljects of snti-Com-
munist witch hunts. One effect we: to drive 
most Gil tett experts out of the go ernment. 
The administration for that very reason'will 
be hard put to find stars to presen: its views 
in Poiannenr's hearings, when C.mir turn

Senn tOr FT7I.BRIGHT, announcing the hear-
ings, rernarked that netiniand China has 
been something of a ford; tdden sul: iect since 
the days of Senator McCarthy. He hopes the 
hearings may "give more maneuverability to 
the Government," induce a "feeling of free-
dom," and embolden "same peor e in the 
administration to change the polite...a 
That indeed might happen. The four 
most recent administrations have Mien hope-
lessly restricted by the miuderous aolitics of 
the issue. Ventilation could help a lot. 
The quickening discussion is already be-
ginning to produce indica tions of tea: kind of 
policy which might result from full debate. 
The goal seems to be a formula foe the con-
tainment of China without either foil-scale 
hand-to-hand war with her or an unending 
task of military resistance to proxy aggres-
sion, as in Korea (including 1 ml ion Chi-
nese "volunteers") arid in Vietna.m. 
Eirective peaceful containment c' -cud then, 
under such a formula, provide a climate 
within which China's fears could be quiet-
ened and her aggressive impulses cured by 
persuasion. 
Senator FULBRICIrr treight one day find 
common ground with .t.he administration 
One? more in such a policy, after their long 
estrangement. He believes the oLly course 
open in Asia is an understanding with China 
permitting neutralization of southeast Asia. 
The administration, including highest 
officers, scorns this, holding that Commix-
nial,s, or any compulsive aggressor:, are not 
to be trusted in neutralize tion schemes. But 
liVI.REICHT counters that if the issue of 
Chinese and American power is .eft unre-
solved, even a total victory in Smith Viet-
nam is unlikely to solve very much. 
It seems clear, however. that the differ-
ences between him and the administration 
are in considerable part those of timing. 
The administration thinks it madness to talk 
now of treating with China or ev,m hoping 
to. Fi,LIMIGHT thinks h: not, too early to 
begin talking abo it. 
THE MITA:RATION OF GLOIBALISM 
Mr, FITT,BRIGIM Madam President, 
ii.sk unanimous conserit to haw printed 
at this point in the RECORD ar article 
entitled "The Frustration of GLibalism," 
written by Walter Lippmann, and pub-
lished in the Washington Post if recent 
date. 
There 'being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in tht. RECORD, 
as follow.: 
Ineusraarraer ..:Ft GLOW?: EOM 
(By Walter Lippmann) 
The edginess which him apoeare.1 recently 
among the President's principal cidvisers is 
a symptom of the frustration which is so 
pronounced in Congress Eclad in the country. 
The frustration springs not from any fear 
that the American forces in Vietnam can be 
defeated on the battlefield. The frustration 
springs from doubt that there is "my other 
course still open except to escalate the war 
without any genuine prospect of eliding it. 
The President is supported in Congress and 
in the polls because there seems ai be no 
alternative to what he is doing. 
Once the President had raised the stakes 
by investing 200,000 American troops 
it made the fight predominantly an American 
war. He had, as one of his suppc thers lit-
marked recently, painted himsell into a 
Corner. 
From the perspective of the WI.i e Housc 
the pursuit of a militery decision could lead 
to a confrontation with China or the Soviet 
Union or both. On the other hand, the at-
tempt to negotiate a truce raised inavoid-
ably the question whether Presitient Johnson 
was prepared to negotiate with Ids enemies 
in the field, of whom some 80 pet sent arf: 
Vietcong. 
if for the time being we cannot do any-
thing to dissolve the President's predicament 
we can, at least, make an effort to understand 
how for 12 years we have slithered .ind now 
have slipped into such a war. 
In a preceding article I argued that ti:e 
containment of Red China, which is a neces-
sary objective of our policy, is beim!: grosely 
mishandled by the President's prin anal ad-
visers, Messrs. Rusk and McNamara. Then 
way of containing China has left us without 
support, and in certain cases with tile ac Live 
opposition, of every great power in Asia. Yet 
if China is as expansionary as we t iiink she 
is and must be contained it can be cone ongy 
by a coalition of great powers concerned with 
Asia. In the preceding article I u aid, too 
that the egregious result of our policy wet 
hidden from view by a piece of well-circu-
lated political mythology; namely, that tin 
outcome of the fighting in South Vietnam 
would decide China's foreign policy and tin 
future of the Communist revolutioe on tint 
planet. 
I venture to believe that the root of the 
Rusk-McNamara misconception of our for-
eign relations is the myth, propagated since 
the First World War by the naive aiid ideal-
istic followers of Wilson, that all overeigr 
states, whether big or small, are not only alike 
in their human rights but alike aka: in their 
right to exercise influence in the vorld, 
believe this to be a myth which fal ;hies the 
nature of things and the facts of fife. It hal. 
rendered Mr. Rusk incapable of sound juicig-
ments in foreign policy. 
In the Senate hearings, for exai iple, 1\1c', 
Rusk discussed with great moral fervor the 
conception of spheres of influence in inter-
national politics. They were inadnitisible, 
said. Therefore we could not recorenze that 
China too might claim a sphere of influence. 
We were too pure for such worldly ?id thine::: 
as spheres of influence. But on what ground:. 
we were doing what we have been doing in 
the past few years in Cuba, Guatemala, the 
Dominican Republic, and Panama, 'Yin Reel, 
was too dainty to say. 
For a foreign minister to deny inat 
treat the territory south of us as a i Ameri-
can sphere of influence, and that we dm 
risk a world nuclear war to prevent ticc SOWifl. 
Union from entering it, and that we have 
suppressed revolution in the Don-dale:in Re-
public on suspicion of the intrusion of for-
eign Communist influences?all ills is tv 
blatantly contrary to the facts that it is re-
garded everywhere else as extremt ly crud( 
hypocrisy. 
For my own part I know of no Sell011S cmi 
educated student of international polite,s 
who attempts to deny that great powers vdt 
insist on spheres of influence which no other 
rival great power may enter with it: icilhltccil 
forces. This is one of the element try facie, 
which every competent foreign minister 
keeps in mind. It is a fact, just a the eii-
istence of two sexes is a fact. 
While the existence of spheres of nfluenee 
is undeniable, there can be great ddlerenest 
in how the great power exerts its influence

April 5, 1966 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? sENA'i E 
Historically, there was a revolutionary turn-
ing point in the evolution of the concept of 
spheres of influence when President Roose-
velt declared that our Latin American policy 
would be the good neighbor policy. He did 
not say that we did not have a sphere of in-
fluence. He said that we intended to act 
within it, not as lords and masters, but as 
friends and partners with our neighbors. 
This was the progressive evolution of the 
classic concept of spheres of influence. 
U.S. POLICIES IN THE FAR EAST 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Madam President, 
I ask unanimous consent to have printed 
at this point in the RECORD the text of a 
broadcast by Eric Sevareid on the CBS 
evening news of March 14, 1966. 
There being no objection, the text of 
the broadcast was ordered to be printed 
in the RECORD, as follows: 
When it comes to the President's conduct 
of foreign relations, the U.S. Senate has the 
constitutional right and duty to advise and 
to consent. When it consents, that's not 
news. In our 16 years' involvement with. 
Vietnam that is all it has done. But when 
it advises, that is news. And so, in a way, 
the biggest story in Washington now is the 
story of the Senate, specifically its foreign 
relations committee, more specifically its 
chairman, FULBRIGHT, of Arkansas. 
Two and three weeks ago, administration 
officials were privately denouncing the Sen-
ator's public inquiry into our Far Eastern 
policies, conveying to the enemy and the 
world, they said, an image of the United 
States as a divided country. Mr. FULBRIGHT 
made the right answer today; since the 
country obviously is divided, he said, what 
was conveyed was not an image, but a fact. 
Yesterday Vice President HUMPHREY said 
FULBRIGHT'S current hearings on China are 
among the most fruitful procedures now go-
ing on. Nobody in power was talking about 
the Senator that way a while back. 
What this means is that FULBRIGHT has 
won his first objective?to make the admin-
istration think far more seriously and deeply 
about the danger of a condition in which 
the world's greatest power and the world's 
most populous power, both armed with nu-
clear weapons, are scarcely on speaking 
terms. We have nothing like the means of 
communication with Peking that we had 
with Moscow at the most critical moments 
in Russian-American relations. 
The Vice President's remark yesterday that 
we should try to contain China without iso-
lating her?in other words, do as we did with 
Russia?is public recognition of FULBRIGHT'S 
achievement. Now the real authorities on 
China, and there are several, buried rather 
deep in the layers of Government, are more 
likely to be listened to at the top levels. An-
other signal that Washington wants to get 
on a new footing with China is the Presi-
dent's decision to let American scholars trav-
el to China?if China will let them in. 
All things begin in the mind, including 
catastrophes. For months, many minds in 
Washington have been gradually drifting 
from the idea of war with China as a possi-
bility toward the idea as a probability. The 
next stage would be expectation. This is 
what FULBRIGHT has detected and wants ito 
halt. 
THE WAR IN VIETNAM?COMMENT 
BY THE BRITISH MAGAZINE "THE 
ECONOMIST" 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Madam President, 
the January 29 issue of the widely re-
speeLed British magazine, the Economist, 
No. 59-9 
contains a perceptive and provocative re-
port from Saigon entitled "Ones Who 
Wait and See." I should like to sum-
marize the main points in this article 
because I think that they raise questions 
that all of us should ponder. They point 
up to me the subtle contradictions and 
paradoxes of the war in Vietnam. 
First af all, the Economist points out 
that as more American troops pour into 
Vietnam, especially as they approach in 
numbers the size of the South Vietnam-
ese Regular Army, there is a growing risk 
that the South Vietnamese Army will be 
looked on as mercenaries. The article 
notes that while General Westmoreland 
is reportedly aware of this danger, "sta-
tistics are working against him." 
The second point the article makes is-
that the larger the American establish-
ment in Vietnam becomes, the more it 
dwarfs the Vietnamese Government and 
the more the suspicion grows "that Viet-
nam's independence and sovereignty 
have become a mere shadow." 
The third point in the article is that 
as the war grows in intensity, democracy 
and freedom become empty words. The 
generals that have stepped into Presi-
dent Diem's shoes "are telling the peo-
ple?with the Americans nodding ap-
proval?that they cannot indulge in the 
luxury of a democratic regime as long as 
the war lasts." 
The fourth point is that many Viet-
namese are becoming increasingly bitter 
and indifferent because they see, on the 
one hand, that if the Communists win, 
the country will be enslaved, while, on 
the other hand, the alternative of na-
tional independence and freedom "is no-
where in sight either." The article 
points out that this has led more and 
more people, including a good many in 
the South Vietnamese Army, to ask: "For 
what and for whom are we fighting?" 
Finally, the Economist states that after 
20 years of war: 
The Vietnamese are back where they 
started but this time with the Americans 
instead of the French by their side. 
Summing up, the article concludes that 
so far as the Vietnamese are concerned: 
National independence and individual free-
dom seem to be two irreconcilable aims in 
a country caught in an East-West confron-
tation which has reached the stage of open?
though indirect?military conflict. 
As for the United States: 
In coming to Vietnam to defend freedom 
they cannot escape infringing on Vietnam's 
national independence. 
The United States will inevitably "reap 
the resentment of the Vietnamese peo-
ple, because, to win the war, they will 
have to take over the effective direction 
of the country." 
It seems to me that the article is an 
unusually good analysis of the inevitable 
consequences of the war in South Viet-
nam. These consequences are per-
suasive arguments, as if any more were 
needed, for hoping that we shall soon 
be able to move to a negotiated settle-
ment of the war. 
Madam President, I ask unanimous 
consent that the article mentioned above 
be printed in the RECORD at this point. 
7261 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
ONES WHO WAIT AND SEE 
(Prom our Saigon correspondent) 
Too few people are paying attention to 
something that is going to exercise increas-
ing influence on the course of the Vietnam 
war. This is the resurgence of Vietnamese 
nationalism. To French residents of Sai-
gon?many of them ex-members of the 
French expeditionary corps who have made 
Vietnam their home?the present political 
picture is strangely reminiscent of the early 
1950's. Attentisme?fence-sitting?is grow-
ing among the Vietnamese. 
As more American troops pour into Viet-
nam (they will soon outnumber the Viet-
namese Regular Army) and engage the Com-
munists directly in big battles, the Viet-
namese Armed Forces risk being looked upon 
as suppletifs. These were the local auxil-
iary troops recruited, armed, and paid by 
the French in the earlier Indochina war, 
who fought under the heavy moral handicap 
of being looked upon by their Vietnamese 
Communist opponents as mercenaries. The 
American commander in Vietnam, General 
Westmoreland, is reported to be acutely 
aware of this danger. He is trying his best 
to correct the impression. But statistics are 
working against him. 
The bigger the American establishment in 
Vietnam gets, the more the Vietnamese Gov-
ernment is dwarfed. No assertion to the 
contrary by Vietnam's ruling generals can 
wipe out the suspicion that Vietnam's inde-
pendence and sovereignty have become a 
mere shadow. 
This is one side of it. There is another. 
As the war grows in scale and intensity, 
democracy and freedom, the two slogans 
which were so prominent in the last years of 
President Diem's rule and rallied round 
them all the forces which were to overflow 
his regime, have now become empty words. 
The generals who tossed President Diem 
out in the name of democracy and freedom 
speak Mr. Diem's language now that they 
have stepped into his shoes. They are tell-
ing the people?with the Americans nodding 
approval?that they cannot indulge in the 
luxury of a democratic regime as long as 
the war lasts. 
Many people, in particular the articulate 
elements who had turned a Ceaf ear to the 
same plea by Mr. Diem now say they have 
been deceived. Hence the growing bitter-
ness, brooding indifference, and attentisme. 
The Vietnamese Government and the Ameri-
cans are shocked by this attitude, just as 
Bao Dai and the French were in the early 
1950's. But even allowing for the undoubted 
loss of nerve and cynicism of a number of 
Vietnamese, there is a real moral problem 
here. To many honest and courageous Viet-
namese it looks well-night insoluble. If the 
Communists win, the country will be en-
slaved. But the alternative?national in-
dependence and freedom?is nowhere in 
sight either. The question now being asked 
by more and more people, including a good 
many in the Armed Forces, whose daily lot 
is lighting and dying, is: for what and for 
whom are we fighting? 
After 20 years of war, suffering and wait-
ing, the Vietnamese are back where they 
started, but this time with the Americans 
instead of the French by their side. The 
political problem remains unsolved. Per-
haps it cannot be solved, for national inde-
pendence and individual freedom seem to be 
two irreconcilable aims in a country caught 
In an East-West confrontation which has 
reached the stage of open?though indi-
rect?military conflict. 
To? the Americans too the answer seems 
unfindable. Whether they like it or not, in

coming to Vietnam to defend freedom they 
cannot escape infringing on Vietnam's na-
tional independence. Mr. Arthur Schlesinger 
says in "A Thousand Days" that President 
Kennedy was acutely aware of the dilemma 
but died before he could solve it. The United 
States will have expended a great deal of 
blood and money to save Vietnam only to 
reap the resentment of the Vietnamese peo-
ple, because, to win the war, they will have 
to take over the effective direction of the 
country. They will have to find a formula 
that will reconcile the desire for individual 
liberty with the equal desire for Vietnam 
to be independent of any great power. Other-
wise the war will be very much the "dirty 
war" so well known to the French?long, 
bloody, costly. exasperating, and indecisive. 
STATEMENT ON U.S. POLICY 
*rOWARD CHINA 
Mr. FULBRIGHT. Madam Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent to have 
printed at this point in the RECORD a 
statement on United States China policy 
prepared by a number of Asian scholars 
who -support in principle the changes 
recommended for U.S. policy toward 
China. 
There being no objection, the state-
ment was ordered to be printed in the 
:-Z,Econ.n, as follows: 
STATEMENT itS UNITED STATES CHINA PO L IC Y 
We, the undersigned, submit the following 
statement for the consideraation of the ex-
ecutive branch, the Congress, and members 
of the public. 
'Chat the formal China policy of the United 
States has long since been out of date is 
widely recognized and tacitly accepted even 
by officials of the American government. 
Changes in this policy will not solve the 
Los or political and military challenges to 
the United States in Asia, but they can im-
prove the ability of the United States to deal 
wish these problems and reduce the likeli-
hood that a crisis could turn into a major 
military confrontation. 
We believe that the following represent ac-
curately factors on which United States 
policy on China should now be based: 
1. The People's Republic of China with its 
capital at Peking is a reality of international 
politics, whose importance to the course of 
international affairs will grow. There is in-
creasing danger in the isolation of the United 
States from China and of China's relative 
isolation from other nations and internations 
of institutions, 
S. The People's Republic of China is now 
committed to a policy of hostility to the 
Vol led States and has made opposition to 
U.S. policies a cornerstone of its foreign 
il. in the immediate future the United 
Shoes is unlikely to persuade Peking that it 
is not its most implacable enemy. But the 
United States can hope to convince Peking 
that, while prepared to respond when chal-
lenged, the U.S. is at the same time interested 
in, exploring areas of mutual interest and 
normal] sing rel at i ons wherever possible. 
1 . The government of the Republic of 
China on Taiwan will be a member of the 
international community for the Indefinite 
rut are, but only as the government of Tai-
wan, and not as a potential government for 
mainland China. 
Ii. The major prOblems for the United 
States in Asia have to do with establishing 
stable and mutually satisfactory relations 
between the United States and Asian national 
governments, while helping to develop social 
and economic viability within Asia countries 
through technical and economic aid pro-
grams. Although the problems are intensified 
by the existence of an expansioniat Commu-
nist force in Asia, they arise from factors in-
dependent of communism itself and must be 
dealt with in the context of the total situa-
tion. 
In the light of these principal factors and 
others, we urge that the U.S. Government 
adopt the following polities: 
1. The United States should cease to use 
its influence to prevent the admittance of 
the People's Republic of China to the United 
Nations and other international bodies. In 
the interests of international peace and the 
national interests of the United States, the 
government at Peking should be acii:epted into 
these institutions, without conditions posed 
by us or by Peking. 
O. The U.S. Government should announce 
that it is prepared, while maintaining rela-
tions with Taiwan, to enter into negotiations 
regarding the establishment of full and for-
mal diplomatic relations with the People's 
Republic of China. 
8. The United States should oropose to 
the People's Republic of China in opening 
of a new phase of bilateral negotiations at 
which the following items wouid be dis-
cussed: (a) Exchange of diplomatic repre-
sentation: (b) renunciation of farce as an 
instrument of policy; (c) arms control in-
cluding problems of the control over nuclear 
weapons. 
4. The United States should e,nnounce 
that it is prepared to accept accredited news-
papermen scholars, and others from the 
People's Republic of China and call upon 
the People's Republic to reciprocate. Ameri-
can willingness to accept Chinese visitors 
should not, at least in the short ran, depend 
on reciprocation. 
5, The United States should end its total 
trade embargo with Communist China and 
permit the importation and exportation of 
nonstrategic materials. 
We believe that the measures suggested 
here would only initiate what must be a long 
and difficult process leading, we Ii 'pe, to the 
normalization of relations bet ween the 
United States and the People's Republic of 
China and a reduction of hostilities between 
the two countries. We believe, despite the 
antagonism shown by the Chinei:e govern-
ment, that it is up to the Uniteci. States to 
try to move the Chinese to a greater accept-
ance of the principles ef coexiste ace in the 
emerging world community. 
--
POSI7CION PAPER: RECOMMEN DAM NS FOR A 
CHANGE IN UNITED STATES -CHID ESE RELA-
TIONS AND POLICIES 
INTRODHC TION 
The purpose of this paper is to set forth 
reasons supporting CET tam n recommended 
changes in U.S. policy toward China. It is 
hoped that the paper will contr.bute to a 
growing consensus within the tinted States 
that our China policy should be modified, 
that our Government should indice te willing-
ness to undertake changes, and that these 
proposed changes should be debated and dis-
cussed increasingly by citizens throughout 
the country. 
There are occasions When poliQ makers in 
government are reluctant to emoark on a 
given policy change because they think such 
a change would not be support:id by the 
public. With respect to U.S. policy toward 
China it appears that this factor is one of 
those inhibiting U.S. sosvernmensal action. 
Therefore, it is important throuirth discus-
sion and sober exchange of views, to per-
suade the Government that there is wide-
spread support for a change in its policy 
toward China and that the United States, 
by changing its policy within parameters dic-
tated by its own best interests, can con-
tribute ultimately to an improvement in re-
lations between the two countries. 
BACKGROUND 
A policy statement was drafted by a small 
group of scholars concerned with U.S. for-
eign policy. It was submitted to members 
of the Association for Asian Studies to learn 
the views of a group considered among the 
most knowledgeable about China, Asia, and 
U.S. relations with nations in that part of 
the world. The members of this association 
have varied backgrounds and posit is knowl-
edge about different facets of Chinese life 
or other parts of Asia. Most of them are 
members of university faculties; some are 
serving abroad in various capacities. Of 
about; 2,700 who were sent the draft state-
ment, over 300 (11 percent) responded, a 
much better than the average response to a 
mailed request for an answer. 
The Asian specialists were asked to indi-
cate whether they approved the statement 
in principle, whether they desired to recom-
mend changes in it, or whether they did not 
wish to be associated with this effort. Over 
85 percent (258) said they were sympathetic 
with the aims of the statement. Of these 
198 were prepared to support it in principle 
and have their names so designated. (A list 
of these is available.) The remaining 60 
said that they would sign the recommended 
policy changes if certain moth-Ile itions in 
wording or concept were made. Since, in 
most cases this could not be done without 
resubmitting the statement to all those who 
had already signed, these names have had 
to be omitted. Eighteen respondents sell 
they supported the statement but for vari-
ous reasons did not wish to sign it. Only 10 
stated they did not wish to be associated 
with the statement because they opposed 
the proposed changes in United States-China 
policy; in most cases the opposition was not 
to the statement in its entirety but to parts 
of it. Five respondents stated that they did 
not wish to sign the statement, but gave na 
explanation of their views. 
The large number of signers who are ex-
perts in Asian studies is convincing evi-
dence that the changes suggested are 
grounded in knowledge about China or the 
surrounding area as well as in recognition 
of U.S. interests in that part of the world. 
The general point of view of the Asian spe-
cialists, as revealed in comments of those 
who responded to the statement circulated, 
is reffected in the following pagss. This 
paper is not necessarily endorsed by the 
signers of the statement on changes recom-
mended. 
GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS 
The United States has always been op-
posed to Communist expansionist and ag-
gressive policies. In the past the Govern. 
ment has also refused to deal with Commu 
nist governments. We have believed com-
munism to be an antidemocratic i'orce, in-
imical to the growth of freedom slid self - 
government, and bent on the dcetruction 
of those governments whose economic sys-
tems were based on a measure of free enter-
prise and capitalism. At times we assumed 
that Communist governments w mted to 
destroy any society or government that wait 
not Communist. 
Because of the above considers' ions the 
United States waited for 14 years before i 
established diplomatic relations with the 
Soviet Union in 1933, and then the fact or 
recognition in no way implied approval of 
its government or policies, but r: tiler ac-
ceptance of the Soviet Union as s. govern-
ment in control of a large population and 
important territory. After World War TI, 
while the United States never severed diplos 
matte relations with the Soviet Union, our 
Government, nevertheless, felt that the So-
viet Union had to be contained in what we 
believed were aggressive and expansionist 
policies. Today the Soviet Union has given

POLITICAL INSTABILITY AND CHAOS 
IN SOUTH VIETNAM 
Mr. MORSE. Madam President, since 
late 1963, when President Diem of South 
Vietnam was deposed, the political and 
military situation in that country have 
seemed to race each other toward the 
brink of failure and disaster. 
For 9 months, we have heard that po-
litical stability is being achieved, so the 
military situation can be retrieved by 
American military forces. But, in the 
last week, the political instability and 
chaos of South Vietnam has reached a 
new peak. Police, armed and trained 
by the United States, and apparently 
some army units, have taken part in 
demonstrations against the government 
of General Ky. American air transport 
has been furnished to Ky's forces to sup-
press them. If there is such a thing as 
a civil war within a civil war, it surely is 
transpiring today in South Vietnam. 
A new addition to these demonstra-
tions, and an almost inevitable one, is 
their tone of anti-Americanism. Visits 
by White House arid Cabinet officials and 
Members of Congress have to be sus-
pended, so as not to add to the appear-
ance that the country is an American 
vassal, which unfortunately it is. 
But at the same time, the jingoism 
whipped up by the administration to sup-
port the war has been reflected in press 
editorials calling for a crackdown on 
dissidents not only by the Government of 
South Vietnam, but also by the United 
States if necessary. Obviously, the ra-
tionale for what we have done up to now 
requires that we remain whether or not 
there is a government in Saigon worthy 
of the name. 
It is the opinion of the senior Senator 
from Oregon that we will remain in 
South Vietnam irrespective of what hap-
pens to its government, because we have 
made, South Vietnam an American vas-
sal, to the shocking discredit and dis-
grace of our country, as our action will 
be recorded on the pages of history for 
future generations to read. 
Having sold ourselves the concept that 
we are in Vietnam to save people from 
communism, there are no limits to what 
we can convince ourselves must be done 
to stay there. We never pretended that 
freedom and liberty for the people of 
the south were at stake, because they 
never had freedom or liberty under their 
various governments. It is only commu-
nism from which we mean to save them--
not tyranny, not death, not misery, not 
destruction, not foreign rule. All these 
and worse are being visited upon the 
people of South Vietnam by the com-
bined forces of the United States and 
General Ky, all as a result of the wrong 
that the United States has committed in 
South Vietnam, the wrong action of the 
United States in supporting an immoral 
and illegal war and involving itself in 
bloodletting in a country in which it had

no right to be in the first place. It is 
all as a result of the policy of the United 
States in South Vietnam as we proceeded 
in 1954 to violate our treaty obligations, 
and, in effect, to help destroy the 
Geneva accords. 
Madam President, that is the sad and 
sordid record of the United States which 
is being supported by the present Presi-
dent of the United States. As a Demo-
crat, I want to say that the responsibility 
rests primarily upon my party, and my 
party should be held to an accounting 
by the American people unless my party 
etops its illegality in South Vietnam. 
As wc send increasing numbers of sol-
diers into Vietnam to hunt and destroy 
the Vietcong and send increasing num-
hers of aircraft to smash both south and 
north, we can scarcely avoid a growing 
animosity among its people for a foreign 
'military power that destroys their coun-
try in the name of its own national in-
terest. 
We must expect the rationalization 
tram the Pentagon and from the White 
t louse that what we do to help put down 
Lids insurrection or civil war within a 
civil war is done because we are satis-
lied that it is Communist dominated. 
The American people will not receive 
any rationalization from the Johnson 
administration for the continuation of 
this butchery in South Vietnam without 
being told that we are doing it in order 
to put down communism. 
say that the American people ought 
to be protected against the loss of their 
lives from an administration that is us-
ing this false rationale in order to jus-
tify our illegality in South Vietnam. 
We ought to say to the people of south-
Asia: "Yell are going to run your 
own affairs and we are not going to kill 
,ninerican boys to support one side in a 
war that has been a civil war from the 
beginning." This is being demonstrated 
o clearly now in South Vietnam for 
i,hose who are willing to see that what is 
mvoived there is a civil war, and some 
A the characteristics of a religious war, 
I am one Senator who will never vote 
to kill an American boy in a war that has 
;Lay of the overtones and undertones of 
m religious war. I do not intend to vote 
ip kill American boys in South Vietnam 
ln a contest that has a scintilla of cause-
L.?-effect relationship between Ca.tholi-
eism and Buddhism. This administra-
ion cannot deny the religious overtones 
and undertones that have been involved 
ln this war from the beginning. 
Madam President, the absence of any 
elittine government in South Vietnam 
?or this country to respond to, and the 
Failure of our alliance partners to invoke 
,Lhe 3EATO treaty, are instinctively 
understood by the American people. In 
Einy opinion, they explain the widespread 
attitude of the American people which 
supports their government, but which 
also seeks an end to the war by negotia-
Lion, by United Nations action, or even 
by some exclusive knockout blow that 
would get it over with. It has only been 
the most recent public opinion polls 
which have gotten away from the ques-
tion of whether people simply support 
their government, for most people will 
say "Yes" to that, no matter what it 
does. But framed in terms of whether 
they would support a candidate for Con-
gress who, in the words of the poll, "says 
he would try harder to reach a compro-
mise peace settlement in Vietnam," 67 
percent believe they would vote for him. 
Another poll queried the public on 
their attitude toward a United Nations 
arbitration of the issue, and found 2 to 
1 in support for that solution, pi ovided 
the Communists agreed in advance to 
abide by it. 
Pollsters are increasingly commenting 
on the fact that persons advocating 
greater use of military power tn. the 
South and in the North do so in the 
assumption that it will bring a quick 
end to the war. 
It is this latter point that the Presi-
dent heavily distorts when he tries to 
create the impression that "warhawks" 
are pressing him against his wishes to 
step Up the level of the war. He has even 
sought to lay the blame for this at the 
doorstep of the Senate Foreign Rela-
tions Committee, by saying our hearings 
created more wa.rhawk sentiment in the 
country. 
Far from creating ivarliawk senti-
ment, our hearings have con vinced 
many people that our real task in Viet-
nam is to find a way to end the war; 
some erroneously feel that a bigeer ap-
plication of military power will do that. 
That false impression was planted by 
the President's own administration when 
it advertised the bombing of North Viet-
nam as a means of forcing Hanoi to the 
bargaining table. Every time the Sec-
retary of State announced that a new 
application of military power was aeeded 
to make someone stop what they were 
doing, he contributed to the seductive 
notion that bombs would solve our prob-
lems there, if only we use enoagla of 
them. 
This talk has come primarily from 
the White House and from the Presi-
dent's Cabinet. I say to President John-
son that the real warhawks are in his 
own administration. It is the Pnssident 
himself who seeks to deride and belittle 
those in Congress who seek peaceful 
solutions in Asia. If there were the 
pressure he talks about from public 
opinion to increase the scope and level 
of the war against his wishes, he would 
do what every politician does in those 
circumstances, and encourage the peace 
wing of his own party to hold hearings, 
to speak up, to offer alternatives, and in 
general, to offset unwelcome war talk. 
This the President of the United 
States has not done and is not doing, 
and I shall be surprised if he ever does 
it. He has not done it; he has do, ke just 
the opposite. He has tried to ridicule 
the speeches, to offset the hearines? and 
to dismiss the alternatives. The White 
House displeasure with the peace wing 
has been made evident on many occa-
sions and in many ways. But no White 
House displeasure or rebuke was di-
rected, for example, at General tieMay 
when he suggested bombing North. Viet-
nam into the Stone Age. No rebulai was 
administered to the White House adviser 
General Taylor when he urged the min-
ing of Haiphong Harber, withte it the 
slightest basis in international law for 
that war-hawk proposal. He continues 
to sit at the President's right hand and 
continues to give him bad advice, with 
the result that both Taylor and the Pres-
ident, plus Rusk, McNamara, and Lodge 
and the rest of the bad advisers of the 
President, are misguiding this country 
into a war that will eventually kill Amer-
icans by the hundreds of thousands. 
These war-hawk views are emanating 
from the President's personal and official 
family. The organized strength of that 
family is brought to bear not against the 
war talk, but against the peace talk. 
I deeply regret this, because I wel-
comed the Johnson platform of 1964 
when he said in his campaign speeches 
that "we will not go north" and he would 
not send American boys to fight a war 
that Asians should fight for themselves. 
I am sorry to repeat it again, but I 
intend to repeat it on the platforms of 
America from coast to coast, as long as 
there is any hope for us to stop this 
American outlawry in southeast Asia. 
The American people gave President 
Johnson a mandate in November 1964, 
and it was a mandate joined in by mil-
lions of Republican voters, as w 11 as 
Democratic voters. It was a mandate 
against the Goldwater war policy. It 
was a mandate for peace. It was a man-
date against an escalation of the war. It 
was a mandate against sending increas-
ing thousands of American boys to be 
slaughtered in South Vietnam. 
The President of the United States 
has walked out on that mandate. It is 
his administration that beats the war 
drums and waves the flag to tatters. 
Therefore, as I have said before, it is 
for the people to take account or this 
administration, and of those running 
for office who support escalating the war 
and increasing the slaughter of Ameri-
can men. Those men should not have 
been sent there in the first place, for the 
reasons given by candidate Johnson in 
the fall of 1964. They should be given 
the protection advocated by General 
Gavin, General Ridgway, George Ken-
nan, and other recognized authorities, 
who have recognized the soundness of 
the enclave approach, as contrasted to 
the Johnson approach of an expcnsion 
of this war that is going to lead lo the 
killing of untold hundreds of Arneeicans 
in a part of the world where we he ve no 
interest. 
It would seem evident that the Ameri-
can people must make good on the indi-
cations that they would support candi-
dates for Congress who would try harder 
to negotiate an end to the war, whether 
through the U.N. or directly with our 
adversaries. 
Is it not interesting that in this civil 
war, as with any war in Vietnam these 
days. those Vietnamese who are oppos-
ing the tyrant, Ky, are urging arbitra-
tion or negotiation of the war though 
the United Nations or through reco:iven-
ing of the Geneva Conference? 
That is not Communist propaganda, 
Madam President. That sounds like 
people seeking to deliver their country 
from a war that is being conducted by 
a foreign power?the United States. I 
am not surprised at the anti-American

sentiment that is characterized by the 
opponents of Ky. 
Madam President, I repeat, it would 
seem evident that the American people 
must make good on the indications that 
they would support candidates for Con-
gress who would try to negotiate an end 
to the war, whether through the United 
Nations or directly with our adversaries. 
I pray they will, for this administration 
can be checked only by a Congress will-
ing to check it, and that must be pro-
vided by the voters. 
I close, Madam President, by saying 
that I think it is exceedingly sad that 
my Government is supporting such a 
tyrant as General Ky, the leader of a 
military junta, whose first reaction to 
opposition seems to be, "Kill." 
We have seen his brutality manifested 
on many occasions. Now, because he is 
being opposed in Da Nang by one of the 
most highly educated men in South Viet-
nam, a scholar and a brilliant doctor?
who points out so clearly that Ky's talk 
about the Da Nang rebels being Com-
munist controlled, which unfortunately 
is endorsed by American officials in Viet-
nam, is not supported by a scintilla of 
evidence?Ky's response is, "Kill him." 
That is the kind of a brute we are sup-
porting in South Vietnam. That is the 
kind of a tyrant American boys are dy-
ing to keep in power. 
Madam President, my country cannot 
justify it. This administration cannot 
justify it. We have no moral right to 
send U.S. forces to South Vietnam in 
support of this brute who has come to 
control the military junta of South Viet-
nam. 
Oh, I think the rebellion will be put 
down. But let me warn the American 
people today, when it is put down, with 
the use of American arms and American 
planes?and I suspect also with the use 
of American power?the headlines will 
say, "Ky Sustained?Ky Victorious?
Stablity Maintained"; and yet the sad 
fact is that my Government and yours, 
may I say to the Senate, is supporting a 
tyranny in South Vietnam, a brutal 
military junta that has not the slightest 
conception of the meaning of the word 
freedom. 
That is our record. 
Mr. GORE. Madam President, will 
the Senator yield? 
Mr. MORSE. I am happy to yield 
to the Senator from Tennessee. 
Mr. GORE. In the opinion of the 
senior Senator from Oregon, will this 
position deter, discourage, or contain 
communism, or does it lower the prestige 
of the United States, and thereby in-
crease the prestige of communism? 
Mr. MORSE. The United States, 
since it started violating the Geneva ac-
cords in 1954, has been creating Com-
munists by the hundreds of thousands in 
the underdeveloped areas of the world 
and throughout Asia. The greatest aid 
communism has in the world is Amer-
ican foreign policy. 
The United States, through its mili-
tary aid, through its support of military 
juntas, is the greatest aid communism 
could have. We cannot defeat commu-
No. 59-10 
nism with American bullets, as the Sen-
ator from Tennessee has heard me say 
so many times. We possess the greatest 
weapon against communism; Bread, not 
bullets, and the expertation of our sys-
tem of economic freedom which gives 
to individuals dignity and self-respect 
and helps to develop them so that they 
can develop their own political freedom. 
I do not have to tell the Senator from 
Tennessee, the Senator from Alaska, or 
the Senator from North Dakota what is 
going on in South America. The support 
my country has given military juntas in 
Latin America by way of military aid 
has increased the threat of communism 
in Latin American, not decreased it. 
To the extent that we are being suc-
cessful in some areas in Latin America, 
it is in those areas where a democratic 
form of life is desired by the masses of 
the people, because they understand it 
and we have been building it up by pre-
paring the seedbeds of economic free-
dom of choice for the masses. 
That is the way, to defeat communism. 
But, my country is out on a bloody 
course of assuming that it can contain 
communism with bombs and bullets and 
military power in Asia. We will be bog-
ged down there for decades to come, 
until finally the American people under-
stand?as the French people came sadly 
to learn and understand?that we can-
not contain Asia with western military 
power. 
Some of us have got to be willing to 
speak out and take the abuse that goes 
with it, and have all our motives chal-
lenged, including our patriotism. 
I consider it the greatest patriotic chal-
lenge which has ever confronted me in 
my 21 years of service in the Senate. 
It is my duty and my trust to do what 
I can to save American lives in south-
east Asia. I cannot save American lives 
in southeast Asia by supporting Lyndon 
B. Johnson in continuing to escalate 
America's war in southeast Asia. 
Madam President, I am perfectly wil-
ling to let history be the judge in my 
opposition to what I am sorry to say has 
now become Johnson's war in Asia. 
Madam President, I suggest the 
absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to call 
the roll. 
Mr. BIBLE. Madam President, I ask 
unanimous consent that the order for 
the quorum call be rescinded. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
HOME RULE FOR THE DISTRICT OF 
COLUMBIA?APPOINTMENT OF 
CONFEREES 
Mr. BIBLE. Madam President, home 
rule for the District of Columbia is a sub-
ject that has been debated on Capitol 
Hill and elsewhere for many years. I 
am hopeful that conferees from the Sen-
ate and the House of Representatives can 
sit down around the conference table at 
a very early date. 
Reasonable and responsible men with 
conscientious differences of opinion have 
traditionally worked out legislative differ-
ences by the conference route. 
Six times since 1949 the Senate has 
passed legislation to grant self-govern-
ment to the District of Columbia. With 
House passage late last year of a charter 
approach to this question, Congress has 
come further down the home rule road 
than ever before in modern history. 
Therefore, as an eternal optimist, I ex-
press the hope that conferees from both 
bodies can make real progress in this 
area. 
The PRESIDING 0.F.V.ICER laid be-
fore the Senate the amendments of the 
House of Representatives to the bill (S. 
1118) to provide for the District of Co-
lumbia an elected mayor, city council, 
board of education, and nonvoting Dele-
gate to the House of Representatives, and 
for other purposes, which were, to strike 
out all after the enacting clause and in-
sert: 
That this Act may be cited as the "District 
of Columbia Charter Act". 
DECLARATION OF POLICY 
SEC. 2. It is the intent of Congress to make 
available to the inhabitants of the District 
of Columbia such measure and form of local 
self-government as they themselves shall 
democratically establish if such self-govern-
ment is consistent with the constitutional 
injunction that Congress retain ultimate 
legislative authority over the Nation's Capi-
tal. In taking this action it is further the 
intent of Congress to demonstrate its funda-
mental and enduring belief in the merits of 
the democratic process by exercising its re-
tained legislative responsibility for the seat 
of the Federal Government only as it con-
cerns amendments to any charter which 
might be established under this Act, but 
not as it concerns the routine municipal af-
fairs of the District of Columbia. 
SELF-GOVERNMENT REFERENDUM AND CHARTER 
BOARD ELECTION 
SEC. 3. (a) (1) The Board of Elections shall 
conduct a referendum, on a day specified by 
it, not later than one hundred days after 
the date of enactment of this Act to deter-
mine if the residents of the District of Co-

want a District of Columbia Charter Board

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- HOUSE April 5, 1966 
ties prosper, and there is great confi-
dence in the future. We must trace this 
good fortune to the basic resources of the 
region?to the good earth, the water, 
and the hardworking and skilled people 
on the farms and ranches and in the 
towns. 
We have done more than build?we 
have rebuilt. We have conserved and de-
veloped our resources and made them 
work for us. We are proud of this herit-
age. But we know that we can sustain 
our prosperity only by continued dedica-
tion to the principles of sound resource 
conservation and development. 
We know, too, that all is not well with 
the land and the waters that flow across 
it. The soil still washes and blows where 
it should be held secure by vegetation. 
The streams are polluted with wastes 
that limit or destroy the value of this 
needed water. 
While we have accomplished much in 
conserving and developing our land and 
water resources, we have much yet to do. 
In Kansas, soil conservation districts 
embrace every farm and ranch, and the 
majority of these districts have signed 
modernized agreements with the De-
partment of Agriculture to permit 
broader and more useful development of 
the rural lands and waters of the State. 
Yet, only 34 percent of the needed soil 
and water conservation work on Kansas 
farms and ranches has been completed, 
and at the current completion rate of 
about 11/2 percent per year the job 
clearly will take a long time to finish. 
Of a total of 236 watersheds that need 
project-type action in Kansas, 40 have 
been authorized for planning assistance, 
and of these 21 have been authorized 
for installation of works of improvement. 
These examples are a brief indication 
of basic soil and water conservation work 
that remains to be done in Kansas. A 
similar picture could be drawn for every 
State, for every State has a great backlog 
of watershed protection and other con-
servation work waiting to be acted on. 
This is a challenge we cannot ignore. 
We must move resolutely forward in 
programs to conserve and develop our soil 
and water and related resources?to 
clean our streams and curb further pollu-
tion of them; to prevent damaging 
floods; to save the soil from washing and 
blowing away; to make the best possible 
use of our water resources through im-
poundment and distribution as needed 
for building sound local economies; to 
preserve the woodlands from heedless ex-
ploitation; to enrich the lives of our 
people by continuing to make the coun-
tryside a more beautiful as well as a 
more useful place for the benefit of all 
Americans. 
UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION 
(Mr. ANDREWS of North Dakota (at 
the request of Mr. BROWN of Ohio) was 
granted permission to extend his re-
marks at this point in the RECORD and to 
Include extraneous matter.) 
Mr. ANDREWS of North Dakota. Mr. 
Speaker, H.R. 8282 which is pending on 
the important matter of unemployment 
compensation, is of a good deal of inter-
est to all of us in the House. I have been 
in contact with a constituent of mine, 
Mr. Richard H. Barry, a well-known 
financial and business consultant, who 
has some ideas pertinent to the revision 
of this legislation. They are embodied in 
a resolution from the Fargo Chamber of 
Commerce, which I would like to insert 
In the RECORD at this point for the study 
of those interested: 
RESOLUTION 
Whereas the Fargo Chamber of Commerce: 
1. Is strongly in favor of an equitable sys-
tem for both employees and employers in 
administering the mechanics and financing 
cycles of temporary and seasonal unemploy-
ment in the permanent work force as distin-
guished from part time or occasional workers, 
and 
2. Recognizes the need and advisability to 
up date the unemployment compensation 
insurance system from time to time in the 
light of experience and changing conditions, 
such as the premise in most States that the 
employer should pay 100 percent of the cost 
of unemployment insurance; and 
3. Is unalterably opposed to H.R. 8282 in 
-its present form, as it is woefully inadequate 
insofar as the need for an up-to-date system 
of unemployment insurance is concerned; 
and 
4. Suggest that the time has come for the 
Congress of the United States to redefine the 
following; 
4.1 The purpose and scope of unemploy-
ment compensation insurance; and 
4.2 The respective financial responsibilities 
of the employer, the employee and the gen-
eral public to pay the insurance premiums, 
first for cycles of temporary and seasonal 
employment of the permanent work force, 
and second, the much higher cost of insur-
ance programs embracing part time and oc-
casional workers, plus cycles in excess of 6 
months; and 
4.3 The duties and compensation of the 
State and Federal administrators of the pro-
gram, plus the mechanics of how such regu-
lators and administrators are appointed; and 
5. Suggest to the Congress of the United 
States that legislative bills such as HR. 
8282 are frequently drawn and sponsored by 
civil service employees of the United States 
Department of Labor giving to them, through 
the office of the Secretary of Labor, unwar-
ranted and excessive bureaucratic control 
without sufficient regard for the following: 
5.1. The full context of what is in the best 
interests of the public; and 
5.2. For the tax inequities caused the 
majority of employers; and 
5.3. For the excessive financial burdens for 
the majority of small employers with stable 
payrolls; and 
5.4. For the denial to all employers of effec-
tive recourse to the judicial branch of gov-
ernment to establish the intent of the law; 
and 
6. Suggest that the foregoing preamble to 
the resolution summarizes the attitude of the 
vast majority of employers in describing 
their concern with the implications of H.R. 
8282 to grant to a few unidentified key em-
ployees in the vast U.S. Department of Labor 
under the guise of authority to issue routine 
regulations or bring about uniformity, a 
wide range of excessive control over the rights 
of employers and in effect making such Fed-
eral administrators the sole proprietors of 
all knowledge; and 
7. Suggest that the Federal advisory com-
missions appointed In the past exclusively 
by the U.S. Secretaries of Labor to represent 
labor, business and the best interests of the 
citizens as a whole have failed to function 
effectively in that capacity; and 
8. Suggest that a specific instance of the 
failure of a recent Federal Advisory Commis-
sion to function for extended periods of time 
and failure to issue reports at reasonable 
intervals is shown by the attached letter 
dated August 2, 1962, from the office of the 
late Congressman, Hjalmer C. Nygaard: Now, 
therefore, be it 
Resolved, That Congress in its evaluation of 
H.R. 8282 be hereby urged to take into con-
sideration the foregoing preamble and take 
affirmative action to have the President of 
the United States with the advice and con-
sent of the Senate appoint a full-time bi-
partisan three-man Unemployment Compen-
sation Board of Administration of which the 
Secretary of Labor would be an ex officio 
member to deal more knowingly and equita-
bly with the employee and employer in the 
full context of what is in the best interest of 
the Nation; and be it further 
Resolved, That this resolution be forwarded 
to the following Members of Congress for the 
State of North Dakota with the request that 
each of them evaluate these recommenda-
tions and if they are in accord with them 
that they write their colleagues on the Ways 
and Means Committee of the House of Repre-
sentatives encompassing their thoughts on 
the substance and spirit of this resolution: 
Senator MILTON R. YOUNG, Senator QUENTIN 
BURDICK, Congressman MARK ANDREWS, and 
Congressman ROLLAND REDLIN. 
FARGO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. 
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES, 
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
Washington, D.C., August 21, 1962. 
Mr. RICHARD BARRY, 
Fargo, N. Dak. 
DEAR Ma. BARRY: Unfortunately I am not 
able to come up with the material you wanted 
relative to S. 3411 and H.R. 12385, copies of 
which are enclosed. 
I am advised that the Federal Advisory 
Commission under the Bureau of Employ-
ment Security is not functioning at present. 
The terms of the past members have expired 
and new members have not as yet been ap-
pointed. It is expected they will be named 
within the next 10 days or 2 weeks at which 
time I will send you the names. The last 
report published by this Commission came 
out in 1954 and is now out of print. I have 
been put on a waiting list for any new report 
which may be forthcoming. 
This is a rather vague and cloudy reply, 
but it is the best I can give you under the 
circumstances. Under separate cover, I am 
sending you a 1962 Congressional Directory. 
On pages 516 and 517 you will find the make-
up of the Bureau of Employment Security-
which may give you some information that 
will be helpful. I am holding copies of the 
two bills and the information you gave me 
over the phone for Mr. Nygaard. 
Sincerely, 
IRENE MARTIN EDWARDS, 
Assistant to Congressman Rjalmar C. 
Nygaard. 
HAIPHONG, THE SANCTUARY THAT 
HURTS 
(Mr. DICKINSON (at the request of 
Mr. BROWN of Ohio) was granted per-
mission to extend his remarks at this 
point in the RECORD and to include ex-
traneous matter.) 
Mr. DICKINSON. Mr. Speaker, I 
have spoken so often of this matter that 
I feel a little redundant. However, the 
Issue is too vital, so important to our 
Nation, that I feel compelled to bring 
the matter to the attention of the House 
and the public until something effective 
is done about it. 
My reference is to the need of blockad-
ing Haiphong and other North Vietnam 
ports in order to keep the British and 
other free world ships particularly from 
carrying in supPlies to the Vietcong. I 
am happy the Greek Government no

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- HOUSE 
Similarly, the provisions of law relating 
to the payment of unpaid salaries in the 
event of the death of a Member of Congress 
during his term of office are made applicable 
to the District Delegate (subsec. (c) ), 
and the privileges of participating in the re-
tirement benefits of the Civil Service Retire-
ment Act which are applicable to Members of 
Congress are made applicable to the Dis-
trict Delegate (subsec. (d) ) . 
In the same way, subsection (e) makes ap-
plicable to the District Delegate, and to his 
office, the provisions of law relating to al-
lowances for stationery, telephones, the hir-
ing of clerical help, and the furnishing of 
office equipment which now apply to Mem--
hers of Congress and to the Resident Com-
missioner. The statutory provisions for con-
gressional office space are also made applicable 
to the District Delegate (subsec. (f). 
The provisions of Federal criminal law 
which relate to Members of Congress, to their 
iietivities, and to their elections, are also 
made applicable to the District Delegate. 
Thus, the Federal Corrupt Practices Act is 
made applicable to the Delegate's position 
(subsec. (g) ), as are also the provisions 
of law making it -a Federal crime to intimi-
date voters (subsec. (h) ), as well as those 
punishing the use by Federal employees of 
influence or authority to interfere with elec-
tions (subsec. (i) ) . 
;Subsection ()) contains the changes re-
quired in existing law to assure that appoint-
ment of candidates to the armed services 
academies from the District would be made 
by the elected Delegate, rather than by the 
appoin fed ,Cornmissioners. 
..;ECTION 5 
'1'his section contains the definitions which 
are used throughout the bill, and also a num-
ber of miscellaneous provisions which will 
be important in administering the law. Sub-
section (a) contains the definitions. Sub-
section (b) simply brings up to date the 
provisions of the existing law with respect 
to the current name of the former munici-
pal court. Subsection (c) changes the dead-
line date for tiling nominating petitions 
for candidates for local party elections, so 
as to give enough time for the operation of 
the new procedure for challenging nomi-
nating petitions, established by subsection 
Id) below. 
The new subsection (d) amends the existing 
District of Columbia election law so as to 
give the Board of Elections authority to ac-
cept initially the signatures on duly filed 
nominating petitions, but sets up a mecha-
Mani by which the petitions can be timely 
challenged, and the challenges resolved by 
the Board of Elections, with a right of later 
review in court. It also provides that the 
order in which the names al candidates 
will appear on the ballot shall be determined 
by choosing lots. 
Subsection (e) amends the existing law 
slightly to clarify the authority of the Elec-
tions Board to issue regulations to accept 
some ballots which have been cast outside 
the precinct in which the registrant lived--
as one example, in the case of a person who 
was registered in one precinct but on elec-
tion day is in a hospital in another precinct 
and is voting as a "shut-in." 
Subparagraph (f) changes the existing 
elections law slightly so as to require that 
only one of the officials in the polling place 
will be needed to accompany an illiterate 
or handicapped voter into the voting booth 
in order to carry out the voter's directions 
with respect to recording his vote (present 
law requires the presence of two officials). 
The change would also provide that the voter 
can, if he so desires, have a second official 
of the Board of Elections to witness the 
recordation. of his vote in accordance with 
his directions. 
Subsections (g) and (h) will shorten and 
simplify the party "primary" ballots under 
the 1955 Election Act, by eliminating the elec-
tion of altern,ates to the various party offi-
cials. The party primary ballots have been 
widely criticized because of their length 
and complexity. The elimination of the elec-
tion of alternate officials will substantially 
shorten the ballots in a number of cases. At 
the same time, the alternates can, of oourse, 
be selected by the parties themselves, by cau-
cus or other means not involving the use of 
the citywide primary election machinery. 
The party officials themselves. (national com-
mitteemen and women, delegates to the Pres-
idential nominating conventions and when 
designated by the parties, members and offi-
cials of the local party committees) would 
continue to be elected by ballot uneer the 
present election law. 
Subsection amends the existine elec-
tion law to make it clear that if the local 
political party committee so desires, the party 
primary ballots may contain presielential 
preference questi.ons to be answered by the 
voters. The bill requires that the local 
party committee furnish the potentia i presi-
dential candidate with written information 
to the effect that it is so proposing his name 
to go on the ballot. At the same time the 
bill provides a mechanism by which the po-
tential candidate may, if he chooses, re-
move his name from the ballot without the 
necessity of stating a reason for his decision 
in tins respect. 
The right to have these president:, 1 pref-
erence questions on the ballot unacr the 
present law has 'been sharpy disputed ever 
since the act was passed in 1955, and a 1964 
court decision cast a further cloud on the 
authority of the board of elections lo per-
mit presidental preference questions under 
existing law. With this amendment these 
presidential preference questions would also 
replace the so-called pa:rty questions. These 
party questions have been criticized as di-
luting the powers of the elected party officials 
to formulate party policies, and also because 
the questions add further to the length of 
the ballot. 
Subsection (1) would remove an ambiguity 
in existing election law by establishing a 
clear deadline for filing the designanons of 
the offices of local party committees to be 
filled by the party primary elections. 
Under the existing election law each can-
didate on the ballot has the right to have 
one watcher at each polling place. Subsec-
tion (k) would change this arrangement 
slightly in the light of the length of the 
party primary ballots (in tae 1964 election, 
for instance, there were over 250 candidates 
on the party ballots), to give the Bieird of 
Elections authority to issue regulatimAs rea-
sonably limiting the number of watchers in 
each voting place, and reasonably to regulate 
the scope of the watchers' activities while 
at the same time preserving their rights to 
perform their important duties. 
Subsection (1) would give the Board of 
Elections clear authority to declare that duly 
nominated and unopposed candidates for 
party office are elected without opposition. 
The fact that they have been so elected 
would appear on the party ballot, together 
with the names of all the candidates who are 
opposed and whose election is to be deter-
mined by the voters. This change witl fur-
ther simplify and shorten ballot forms, with-
out in any way diminishing: the effectiveness 
of the elections under the act. 
Subsection (m) changes the method of 
compensation of the members of the three-
man Board of Elections. They are now paid 
$25 per day while performing their duties. 
With the enactment of this act there will be 
two elections in every even-numbered year, 
with occasional special or party runoff elec-
tions to be expected from tone to time, thus 
substantially increasing the activities of the 
Board of Elections. The amount of time 
spent by Board members NI an election year 
is substantial, and the changeover to some 
-7331 
modest, fixed annual compensation i.3 de-
sirable and appropriate under all the circum-
stances. 
Subsection (n) amends the law an as to 
give the candidates a period of 30 days after 
each election in order to complete and file 
their financial reports. At present they have 
only 10 days in which to perform this work, 
a period which is insufficient and unwork-
able. 
Subsection (o) tightens up the enOirce-
ment provisions of the present Taw so as to 
make it clear that any false statement by a 
registrant with respect to qualifications for 
voting will render him subject to penalty, 
whereas the present act limits the applicabil-
ity of the penal provision to false statements 
as to the registrant's residence or \ oting 
privileges outside- the district. The bill also 
makes the enforcement provisions of the act 
applicable to the restrictions on contribu-
tions and requirements for reporting exsend-
itures. 
Subsections (p) and (q) amend the title, 
and the first section of the existing le,w, so 
as to reflect the fact that the act provides 
for the election of the Delegate to the Souse 
of Representatives in addition to the other 
officials elected under the existing law. 
SECTION 6 
Enactment of the first five sections cf this 
bill would have the effect of convertirg the 
present quadrennial election cycle in the 
District of Columbia to a biennial cycle--
that is, there would be two elections, in 
every even-numbered year, whereas mit the 
present time there are two elections only ill 
every fourth year?in presidential election 
years. 
Enactment simply of these first live sec-
tions in an election year such as 1966 would 
raise some operating problems. It; takes 
several months to get ready to run an elec--
tion well, and funds have to be made avail--
able for the purpose. 
In order to take care of these initial start-
ing problems, section 6 has been added which 
authorizes special elections in the autumn 
of 1966 to elect a Delegate to the House to 
serve in the 90th Congress, which convenes 
next January. This section 6 spec:Means; 
validates for purposes of these 19136 elec-
tions all the 1964 registrations (approxi-
mately 200,000 of them were made al that 
time) to the extent that the registrants prove 
that they continue to meet the qualifies.. 
ionsrequired by the District of Cab imbia 
election law. 
Section 6 also provides for additional reg--
istrations for these 1966 elections, and gives 
the Board of Elections flexibility in schedul-
ing the dates for the 1966 primary and gen--
eral elections for Delegate, and for party run--
off elections also, if such additional elec-
tions prove to be necessary. The section pro--
vides a time limit in which the Board is 
required to complete the installation of the 
new permanent registration system in re-
place the present periodic registration.; now 
required. The deadlines prescribed w;11 as--
sure that the permanent registration system 
will be in full operation for the 1968 elec-
tions. 
Technical note: The bill has been (tented 
to meet the codification requirements of the 
District of Columbia Code and also, in sec-
tions 2(a) and 4, the codification require-
ments of the United States Code.

longer permits Greek-flag ships to engage 
in this trade; so, perhaps we are making 
progress, even if it is slow. 
It has been noted that Soviet Russian 
vessels are carrying the latest Mig-21's 
to Haiphong for unloading; one ship 
we have been informed, arrived just the 
other day. Yet the propaganda line is to 
paint the Russians as the "good guys" 
and the Red Chinese who are presently 
doing far less for the Vietcong as the 
"baddies." 
While I do not pretend to be an au-
thority on this subject, others are. By 
unanimous consent, I introduce an edi-
torial from Navy, the official publication 
of the Navy League of the United States: 
HAIPHONG, THE SANCTUARY THAT HURTS 
The question of when or whether the 
United States should take decisive steps to 
shut off the flow of arms and war supplies 
into Haiphong, North Vietnam's biggest and 
busiest port, continues to gnaw at the John-
son administration. 
Pressure for such action has mounted in 
recent weeks, as American aircraft losses and 
the number of North Vietnamese regular 
army troops infiltrating into the south in-
crease. The principal methods advocated are 
these: (1) bombing from the air; (2) laying 
of minefields in the harbor, and (3) the es-
tablishment of a partial blockade or quaran-
tine of the type ordered by President Kennedy 
during the Cuban missile crisis of 1962. 
Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor, a former Chair-
man of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and now a 
Presidential adviser on Vietnam, told Con-
gress early last month that he believed it was 
time to do something about Haiphong. He 
said he throught mining the harbor would 
be the simplest way to discourage shipping 
from entering that port. 
About a week later, a raft of interpretive 
stories came out of the Pentagon?indicating 
that a background session for reporters had 
been held by official spokesmen?which said 
that the Joint Chiefs want to bomb some of 
Haiphong's industrial and petroleum storage 
areas as part of a general expansion of the 
air war against North Vietnam. 
Several leading Republicans, including 
Senate Minority Leader EVERETT DIRKSON 
and former Vice President Richard Nixon, 
have been advocating a blockade of the Com-
munist port. A number of influential Demo-
crats in Congress, Senators RUSSELL and 
SYMINGTON, for example, also favor such a 
step. 
EXPLOITING OUR FEARS 
The thinking behind these recommenda-
tions for ending the de facto sanctuary status 
of Haiphong goes like this: It doesn't make 
sense to bomb North Vietnam at all if the 
Communists are allowed to import anti-
aircraft guns and missiles and the shells and 
bullets which make the bombing more 
expensive in American lives and money and 
increase the casualties among our forces 
engaged against the enemy in the south. 
The administration, however, is f &art@ 
that if we attack Haiphong, or blockade it, we 
might risk a serious crisis with the Soviet 
Union and/or Communist China. The Rus-
sians and Chinese are well aware of this fear 
and have exploited it. The Russians report-
edly have passed the word through diplo-
matic channels that if we strike either Hai-
phong or the capital city of Hanoi (also a 
saneutary) they will have to take some kind 
of counteraction. The Chinese have said the 
same thing publicly. According to a member 
of the Philippine Senate, who had Just 
returned from a visit to Peking, the Chinese 
told her that they would feel Justified in 
entering the Vietnamese war if the United 
No. 59-18 
States attacked the two big cities in the 
north. 
State Department and Pentagon leaders 
have played down the heavy military aid the 
Soviet Union has been giving the North 
Vienamese aggressor, presumably on the 
theory that good relations with Moscow 
should be maintained so that it might, one 
day, persuade Hanoi that it should come with 
us to the peace table. As a consequence there 
has been a tendency on the part of the ad-
ministration to downgrade the importance 
of Haiphong to the war effort against us and 
also to entangle it with the question of 
bombing Hanoi, for which there is far less 
pressure. 
Accordingly, there must have some red 
faces in Washington late last month when 
a copy of a letter purportedly sent by the 
Kremlin to Communist parties around the 
World found its way into print in the West-
ern World. Dealing with the Moscow-Peking 
split, the communication for the first time 
gave the American people a fairly detailed 
account of the kind and scope of the mili-
tary aid the U.S.S.R. has been supplying our 
enemy. Here is what it said, in part: 
The Soviet Union delivers large amounts 
of weapons to the DRV (Democratic Repub-
lic of Vietnam), including rocket installa-
tions, anti-aircraft artillery, airplanes, tanks, 
coastal guns, warships, and other items. In 
1965 alone, weapons and other war materiel 
worth about 500 million rubles ($550 mil-
lion) were placed at the disposal of the 
DRV. 
"The DRV is receiving support in the 
training of pilots, rocket personnel, tank 
drivers, artillerymen, and so on. Our mili-
tary aid is being rendered to the extent the 
Vietnamese leadership itself thinks neces-
sary." 
Figures on the value of Chinese military 
aid to North Vietnam are not available, but 
it is doubtful that it would match the So-
viet's half-billion dollar annual rate, a rate 
the Kremlin makes clear may go even high-
er?Han01 only has to ask. 
BULK. OP IT GOES BY SEA 
With China and the U.S.S.R. assailing each 
other so bitterly that some observers believe 
the two Communist giants are near a com-
plete break, it may be assumed that the bulk 
of this Soviet aid reaches North Vietnam by 
ship, through Haiphong. Again, the Krem-
lin letter referred to above sheds some light. 
It said; 
"The Chinese Communist Party leadership 
hindered the implementation of the agree-
ment of the Government of the U.S.S.R. with 
the Government of the DRV on an immedi-
ate increase in military aid for the DRV. The 
CCP leaders did not permit Soviet transport 
planes with weapons to fly over CPR (Chi-
nese Peoples Republic) territory. 
"Then, Chinese personalities also placed 
obstacles in the way of the transportation of 
war materiel to Vietnam by rail. Thus, at 
their request, an additional shipment of mil-
itary equipment, including anti-aircraft artil-
lery, which is needed so urgently to protect 
the Vietnamese cities and villages against the 
United States air pirates, was recently deliv-
ered to the Vietnamese comrades. The Chi-
nese authorities refused for a long time to 
relay the freight, under the pretense that the 
papers for its transit had not yet been filled 
out and that they did not know whether 
Vietnam needs this war materiel." 
It is clear that the port of Haiphong is 
vitally important to the North Vietnamese 
war effort and that this importance will in-
crease as Soviet and East European Commu-
nist aid expands. Militarily, it would make 
sense to disrupt this lifeline that helps sus-
tain our enemy. We control the sea and the 
air and could do so. There are, of course, 
diplomatic and political factors that the 
7333 
President must weigh. But the American 
people now know, ironically from the Krem-
lin and not from the White House, how vast 
the Soviet military aid to North Vietnam is 
and how necessary Haiphong is to its deliv-
ery. The pressure for a new decision by the 
President is bound to increase further. 
Should he decide to allow Haiphong to re-
main a sanctuary, he will have to make a new 
case. His present one is not convincing. 
DISRUPTIVE CCC CORN SALES 
SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY IN-
VESTIGATED 
(Mr. NELSEN (at the request of Mr. 
BROWN of Ohio) was granted permission 
to extend his remarks at this point in 
the RECORD and to include extraneous 
matter.) 
Mr. NELSEN. Mr. Speaker, on March 
8, 1966, I sent the following letter to the 
distinguished chairman of the House 
Committee on Agriculture, calling his at-
tention to the recent policies of the 
Commodity Credit Corporation which 
have initiated a potentially disastrous 
situation in the Minnesota corn market: 
MARCH 8, 1966. 
Hon. HAROLD D. COOLEY, 
Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, 
House of Representatives, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: In the face of de-
partmental predictions to the contrary and 
drastically dropping corn prices, the Com-
modity Credit Corporation has dumped near-
ly 175 million bushels of corn on the market 
since the first of this year. During the past 
9 weeks, the Commodity Credit Corporation 
has disposed of about one-till-71 of the total 
CCC reserve supply. 
Can this be the same Government agency 
which predicted in December that corn re-
quirements this year could "be met largely 
out of the 1965 crop, with only limited 
amounts of corn expected to be made avail-
able from (Government-owned) stocks"? 
On December 17, the USDA announced that 
sales in 1966 would be less than last year's 
total of 417 million bushels. Nevertheless, 
in the first 9 weeks of 1966, the Commodity 
Credit Corporation has sold a total which 
already amounts to 42 percent of the entire 
1965 total. In January, the Commodity 
Credit Corporation dumped 62 million 
bushels of corn, compared to only 8.4 million 
bushels in December. The February total of 
140.2 million bushels dumped was the high-
est for any month in 4 years and more than 
double the amount for February 1965. The 
Commodity Credit Corporation seems bound 
and determined to break their newly estab-
lished record this month. Last week, they 
unloaded 72 million bushels of corn. 
In 2 days of last week, the Commodity 
Credit Corporation dumped 40 million 
bushels of corn in Minneapolis; nearly five 
times the amount sold in December on all 
markets. These sales in Minneapolis were 
made at 6 to 7 cents under the level of the 
futures contract in Chicago for March. The 
closing prices of corn futures after these two 
days were from 6% to as much as 10 cents 
below the February 14 level. 
Most of the unloaded grain was purchased 
by domestic users. In February, for ex-
ample, the Government sold 122.9 million 
bushels for domestic use and 17.3 million 
bushels for export. Why has this heavy em-
phasis on domestic sales occurred during a 
year when exporters say that total exports 
will exceed '700 million bushels if the sup-
plies are available at ports, an increase of 
130 million bushels over the 1964-65 total.

7334 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - HOUSE 
The answer, of course, is a concerned Gov-
ernment effort to drive the farmer's corn 
prices down, This effort has succeeded, as it 
always has. Prices on No. 2 yellow corn in 
Chicago have dropped since mid-February 
. from $1.33 to $1.27. Prices on corn sold for 
future delivery on the Chicago Board of 
Trade closed last Friday at $1.23 a bushel, 
down 8 cents from mid-January. 
It is very discouraging to farmers that, at 
a time when the parity price ratio shows 
signs of creeping upward, the heavy hand of 
the Commodity Credit Corporation would 
shatter this reviving trend with its dumping 
practices. It may be that as in the recent 
cases ot actual or threatened dumping of 
aluminum and steel, the official excuse will 
be that of curbing inflation. However, some--
one will have to prove to me how a segment 
of our economy can be held responsible for 
our growing threat of inflation when they 
only receive 80-some percent return on their 
contribution to our economy. 
A better explanation for these recent 
dumping practices just might be tied in with. 
their timing. This happens to be the time 
of year that farmers are being asked to sign 
up for acreage-retirement programs. As 
some corn traders have suggested, "we can 
only suspect the corn disposal has the aim 
of discouraging a large corn acreage this 
year. This amounts to no less than economic 
Assault being used to force fortners into pro-
grams which Congress clearly intended to 
,snnain voluntary, 
I would hope that through your leader-
ship, the House Committee on Agriculture 
will act quickly to halt this misinterpreta-
tion of congressional intent and insure the 
restitution of the grain market to the sup-
ply and demand influences of a free economy. 
Sincerely yours, 
ANCHER NELSEN. 
Member of Congress.

DEPARTMENT OP AGRIC riLTORE, 
Washington, D.C., March. 23, 1966. 
lion. HAROLD D. 000LEY, 
Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, 
House of Representatives. 
DEAR MR. CHAIRMAN: We appreciate this 
opportunity to respond to the inaccurate or 
misleading statements contained in Con-
gressman A NeitER NELSEN'S letter to you 
which was forwarded to us for reply. 
The Department, in the press release noted 
by Congressman NELSEN, stated that CCC 
sales in 1965-66 were expected to be consid-
erably smaller than in the previous year, but, 
we further indicated that in application of 
the ever-normal-granary principle, CCC sup-
plies would be offered as necessary to insure 
,in orderly movement of supplies into domes-
tic use and export. This principle involves 
acquisitions by COO when supplies are over-
burdensome and releasing stocks when the 
market flow is inadequate. The basic objec-
tive of the ever-normal-granary and CCC 
sales policy is that of promoting orderly mar-
keting over a period of years and within a 
given marketing year. This has been, and is 
presently the basis for the CCC sales and 
procurement policy. 
As has been the case since enactment of 
the present type of feed grain pr gram, the 
Department this season has offered its stor-
able corn supplies for unrestricted domestic 
use at the market price but not less than the 
legal minimum, that is, the applicable loan, 
plus a gradually increasing month] y markup. 
The markup this season began with 4i/4 cents 
per bushel for October (compared to nothing 
in past years) and is again being increased 
by .11,t2 cents in each succeeding month to 
reach a scheduled final total of 17% cents 
for July, August, and September. 
Thus, the CCC minimum price has a built-
in upward seasonal trend and is above the 
current loan redemption value for producers 
at all times by a gradually widening differ-
ence. 
Sales of corn for restricted use, mainly for 
export, or of nonstorable qualities, have also 
been available at not less than market price. 
The increase in rate of disposals beyond 
the levels indicated in December is accounted 
for by several subsequent developments. 
First, it became apparent by February that 
total utilization would be larger than initi-
ally estimated by nearly 90 million bushels, 
including an increase of 50 million bushels 
in exports. The estimate of the /965 corn 
crop also was adjusted downward by 8 mil-
lion bushels and from the feed value stand-
point may actually be somewhat lower. 
Second, an unevenness developed in the 
market offerings of corn after harvest ac-
companied by an uncharacteristic price 
movement considering the size of the 1965 
crop (see tables 1 and 2), partly because a 
larger-than-usual proportion of the new 
crop went into storage at relatively high 
moisture levels, hence was taking more time 
to get into condition considered desirable for 
sale by producers. A good many producers 
also reacted to the somewhat unqualified dis-
cussion of growing world food needs by put-
ting off corn sales against the possibility of a 
big surge later in export demand. 
It became apparent by January that if the 
Department was to carry out its general re-
sponsibility of insuring an adequate and 
reasonably steady supply movement to users, 
It would be insufficient to limit CCC offer-
ings, as initially anticipated, primarily to 
get rid of supplies unsuitable for further 
storage and to meet the needs of the emerg-
ency livestock feed program at concessional 
prices as required by law. 
As more was learned about the low quality 
and high-moisture condition of 1965 corn in 
the northwest Corn Belt, particularly in 
Minnesota., it also became apparent that con-
siderable quantities of dry corn from CCC 
stocks would be desired. for blending with 
the new crop to improve its acceptability in 
the market. In this connection, it may be 
mentioned that up to 2 million bushels of 
CCC bin site corn per week are continuing 
on offer to local Minnesota buyers to further 
insure coverage of blending needs. 
From now on, however, it seems likely that 
total CCC disposals will taper off substan-
tially as the movement of corn from other 
sources normalizes. 
Incidentally, the reference to CCC dispos-
als of about 140 million bushels in February 
being the highest in 4 years for that 
month is not a very good indicator of the 
average overall monthly rate so far this 
season. At only 4.8 and 8.5 million bushels 
respectively, the recent October and Decem-
ber rates were the lowest for those months in 
all of the five seasons since the present; type 
of feed grain program began. The November 
total of 19 million bushels was the lowest 
April 7i, 1966 
for the month in the five seasons with the 
exception of 1964-65 and at less than 62 
million bushels the current January dispos-
als were the smallest for the Month except 
In 1963-64. 
We hope that the foregoing deals ade-
quately with respect to the points raised in 
the letter from Congressman NELSEN. 
Sincerely yours, 
JOHN A. Sermirrann, 
Under Secretary.
