 THIS MATERIAL CONTAINS INFORMATION AFFECTING THE NATIONAL
 DEFENSE OF THE UNITED STATES WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE
 ESPIONAGE LAWS, TITLE 18, USC, SECS. 793 AND 794, THE
 TRANSMISSION OR REVELATION OF WHICH IN ANY MANNER TO AN
 UNAUTHORIZED PERSON IS PROHIBITED BY LAW.
 1.         Indian Communist Party invited to send delegate to 19th
 Party  ongress:  Ajoy Ghosh, general secretary of the commu-
 nist Party o  India, has been invited to attend the 19th
 Party Congress in Moscow as a fraternal delegate, according
 to an announcement by the party's Calcutta headquarters.   (U
 New Delhi 981, 6 Sept 52)
 Comment:  This is the second indication that the Commu-
 nist               a$ rty of the USSR is inviting delegations from non-
 Soviet Communist Parties to attend the 19th Party Congress.
 An invitation has been accepted by the Israeli Communist Party,
 which will be represented by its secretary, Mikunis, and Tewfik
 Toubi, both of whom are parliamentary deputies.   It has also
 been reported that the secretaries of all national Communist
 Parties will meet in Moscow on 15 October after the Congress.

 2.         Italian Foreign Office concerned over instability in
 Albania:     e Italian Foreign Office is muc  concerns  over
 the   resent unstable situation in Albania.   Although the
 Foreign Office believes that Premier Hoxha's days are
 numbered, it sees in Hoxha's speech on 20 August, in which
 he stated that Albania could not easily be defeated because
 she had allies to protect her, a possible indication that
 the Albanians have received reassurance from the USSR
 against the consequences of Yugoslav activities in Albania.
 Comment:  The USSR has provided Albania considerable
 economic but little military, assistance, and it has carefully
 avoided any military commitments.  Only Bulgaria has a formal
 mutual assistance pact with Albania.

 There is no evidence of an imminent Yugoslav-inspired
 governmental coup in Albania or of Soviet willingness to risk
 a war to secure Albania?s positionin the Soviet Orbit,
 3.         Czechs-impressed by air show marking Czech Air Force Day:
 The American  massy reports that tears ow on   September
 which marked Czech Air Force Day obviously impressed the
 150,000 Czechs who observed it.   Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov
 and Military Attache Gusev occupied the seats of honor at the
 flypast which, although displaying approximately the same
 aircraft as shown on Liberation Day last May, was significantly
 better executed.   (C Prague 153, 8 Sept 52)
 Comment:  The Czech Air Force is apparently showing
 results     the training of pilots in the USSR.   Its increased
 capabilities are evidenced by the fact that Czech jet planes
 started flying border patrols early in June and are now
 claiming publicly that no American planes dare to approach
 the frontier for fear of Czech interception.
 In previous Air Force displays, formation flying was not
 well executed and was susceptible to interception by adverse
 weather conditions.   Rain and poor visibility this year had
 no apparent effect on the flypast,
 4.          Major explosion reported near Budapest:   The US Legation
 in Budapest repor s that a major explosion followed by a
 fire occurred at a town about fifteen kilometers north of the
 center of Budapest on 8 September,  Attempted visits to the
 fire area showed extreme security measures by police, military
 and paramilitary organizations.  The cause of the explosion is
 unknown, but it is speculated that a chemical or ammunition
 dump or an explosives factory blew up.   (C Budapest 232, 8
 Sept 52)
 5,         Rumanians allegedly violate Yugoslav diplomatic immunity:
 The Belgrade radio has announced that Rumanian police attempted
 to throw three Yugoslav diplomats off a train at Cernavoda,
 accusing them of having taken photographs in a prohibited
 area.   The Yugoslav Charge, who was involved, protested at
 the Rumanian Foreign Office against this "breach of diplomatic
 immunity,"
 The Yugoslavs consider that "the attack was designed in
 Bucharest in order to worsen relations with Yugoslavia,"

 They recall the "countless incidents" along the Yugoslav
 frontier and "other forms of pressure," including "intoler-
 able" living and work conditions of the Yugoslav diplomats
 in Bucharest.   (R FBIS Belgrade, 7 Sept 52)
 Comment: If the Yugoslavs were actually taking photo-.
 graphs  n t e restricted Dobrudja area, the Rumanian action
 could be expected now that Yugoslavia is considered a member
 of the "imperialist camp."
 The charge that Bucharest is trying to worsen relations
 follows another recent diplomatic incident between Yugoslavia
 and Bulgaria and will probably be used to support the Yugoslav
 resolution in the UN which proposes standardization of treat-
 ment of diplomatic representatives.
 6.            Yugoslavs estimate future food import requirements as
 a result of o ourour ght:  Yugoslav officials estimate that    ey
 will be unable  o finance $55,000,000 of their food import
 requirements for the coming year.   They plan to import
 700,000 metric tons of wheat, of which 360,000 tons have
 already been contracted for, and 200,000 tons of corn, as
 well as other food imports.   These quantities would maintain
 a normal rate of consumption of basic foodstuffs and sufficient
 feeding of livestock.
 The Embassy views these estimates as optimum requirements,
 not as minimum real needs.   (C Belgrade 308, 7 Sept 52)
 Comment:   The estimated $55,000,000 deficit on future
 food imports is more serious than the figure indicates, be-
 cause in normal years Yugoslavia is a net exporter of food.
 Previously, the Yugoslavs claimed that the total foreign ex-
 change losses resulting from the drought would be $150,000,000,
 but IBRD representatives estimated $120,000,000.  However,
 an unknown volume of reserve food stocks and foreign exchange
 reserves resulting from an unexpectedly large volume of ex-
 ports in the first half of 1952 will reduce the minimum extra
 needs for foreign exchange to less than $120,000,000.   Some
 short term foreign credits have been negotiated with Turkey
 and with the Chase National Bank for Canadian wheat, but this
 merely increases foreign exchange deficits in future years.

 7.            Rhee may attempt to reimpose control over Liberal Party:
 25X1C                                                               President Rhee
 in late August requested the Liberal Party members outside
 the National Assembly to set up a supreme council to take the
 place of their present vice chairman.   A similar request had
 also been made by the pro-Rhee Liberals in the Assembly.
 Prior to 3 September the "outside" Liberals agreed to the
 plan and Rhee was to appoint a "reform cabinet" in the near
 future, chosen from "outside" Liberals who are not currently
 25X1A       holding office.                                 Rhee's desire to
 set up a supreme council is twofold; to re-establish his
 control over the party and to check the power of Yi Pom-sok,
 the current vice chairman.  C
 Comment:  With the House of Councilors elections and the
 National Ass mbly by-elections scheduled for the near future,
 it is probable that Rhep will effect some sort of rapproche-
 ment with the Liberal Party.
 8.         Manchurian official deviates from party line on Soviet
 Army role: Rao Chung-min, one of   ree vice chairmen o _Tie
 Nor aces  People's Government, asserted at the V-J Day cere-
 monies in Mukden that the "liberation" of Manchuria was ac-
 complished by "the heroic fighting of the Chinese People's
 Liberation Army, supported by all the Chinese people and the
 entry of the Soviet Army.  .  .  ." (R FBIS Peiping, 4 Sept 52)
 Comment: The full text of Mao Tse-tung's V-J Day mes-
 sage to Stalin showed that Mao, while reaffirming the Chinese
 claim to have played the leading role in the war against
 Japan, endorsed the Soviet claim to have defeated the Kwang-
 tung Army, the "main force" of the Japanese Army, in Manchuria
 in August 1945.
 In asserting that, on the contrary, the Chinese had
 played the leading role in Manchuria and had merely been
 "supported" by the Soviet Army, Kao Chung-min may simply
 have been ignorant of the party line.   Peiping's broadcast
 of Kao's remarks, two days after the line had been dissemi-
 nated, is less easily explained.

 Communists claim business revival in Shanghai:  A Peiping
 news BYoa-cast asserts that an industrial an  commercial boom
 is under way in Shanghai.   The volume of business during the
 East China trade conference from 25 May to 13 June is said to
 have been three times the original target.   (R FBIS Peiping,
 5 Sept 52)
 Comment:  A trade depression during the first half of the
 year repu   ed from the Communist "anti-vices" campaign attack-
 ing businessmen.   Some recovery was expected to follow the
 cessation of this campaign, but reliable reports have not yet
 been received to confirm the Communist claims of a business
 revival.
 10,        Chinese Communist arm  demobilization reports continue:
 25X1X         A                               source on   September repor e
 tha   a  new persona  y o       e actual demobilization in
 Kiangsi of 10,000 regular Chinese Communist troops and had
 also heard that 80,000 troops had been demobilized there
 between February and August.  According to his report most
 of the demobilized men were Korean war veterans apparently
 from different armies.   (S Hong Kong,Joint Weeka 36, 6 Sept 52)
 Comment:  This is the first report which has stated
 that   Ti-e--"We-mobilization" has been limited to Korean veterans.
 Other reports have suggested that units are being demobilized
 to allow the troops to be used for agricultural work.   It is
 possible that they can be so used without deactivating any
 units.
 11,        Reorganization of French administration in Indochina
 planne :     French administrative reform commission  n  ndo-
 ci na has submitted recommendations for the replacement of
 the French High Commissariat by a small high-level organi-
 zation for Southeast Asia,  The new organization would be
 roughly comparable to Malcolm MacDonald's Commission General,
 and would entail sweeping cuts in the number of French
 personnel.
 While the plan faces many difficulties, American Ambassa-
 dor Heath sees in it the possibility that the French Union
 concept "may possess greater evolutionary elasticity than
 some observers have supposed."   (S Saigon 537, 8 Sept 52)

 Comment:   If this plan is approved by the French
 parliament, the resultant alterations of the French admini-
 strative structure in Indochina should have a salutary effect
 on Vietnamese public opinion.
 General Phao reportedly negotiating with former Thai
 army leaders:                                                                  25X1C
 Nice-Director General Phao has offered to restore to their
 former high positions in the army two recently released par-
 ticipants in the unsuccessful 1948 military countercoup.  One
 of the two generals has refused to re-enter the army under any
 conditions, while the other will resume his career only on
 condition that a general amnesty be granted to all partici-
 pants in the 1948 coup attempt and all leaders be reinstated
 in the army.
 Comment:   If true, this report indicates that Phao is
 attempting to enhance his influence in the army, where his
 chief rival, General Sarit, enjoys widespread popularity.
 13,          Thai Premier's views on collective defense in Pacific:
 In a recent press interview, Premier PEibun endorsed in
 general the principle of defensive alliances, but did not
 commit Thailand to a Pacific defense system.  Thailand, he
 stated, would observe the attitudes of other interested
 powers, "especially those taking the initiative."  Burma
 and Indochina, according to Phibun, would be important
 parties in any consideration of southeast Asian defensive
 alliances.
 The American Embassy in Bangkok interprets Phibun's
 statements as an attempt to "nudge." the United States into
 extending security arrangements to Thailand, which, in the
 absence of firm Western guarantees, considers itself "po-
 litically overextended."   (C Bangkok 372, 29 Aug 52)
 American Ambassador to Thailand recommends termination
 of ru  er agreemen :  Ambassador   an on recommends term-I-na-
 tion of the unpopular US-Thai rubber purchasing agreement,
 which he maintains is rapidly becoming a domestic political
 issue.  He believes that termination would demonstrate
 American desire for "open-minded cooperation" with the
 Thai Government, neutralize Communist charges that the
 agreement forced Thailand to sell rubber at unfavorable

 prices, and relieve the US of the necessity of continued
 purchases of unwanted low-grade rubber.   (C Bangkok 409,
 6 Sept 52)
 Comment:  Although the agreement is based on world prices,
 there  s w  espread belief in Thailand that it is restrictive
 and prevents producers from selling rubber to other buyers
 under more favorable terms.  Opposition groups, especially
 the Communists, blame the agreement rather than falling world
 prices for the current rubber slump in southern Thailand,
 15.         Kashmir Assembly President plans Moscow visit:  A recent
 report that Ghulam  a  q,   res   en  o  The  as m r Consti-
 tuent Assembly, intends to visit Moscow in November for
 medical treatment suggests that Sadiq will report to the
 Kremlin on recent Communist activity in Kashmir and seek
 instructions for future action.   Sadiq, who like Thorez will
 probably be a guest of the Soviet Government, also wishes to
 visit Eastern European countries.
 Sadiq, the most prominent leftist and suspected Communist
 in Kashmir, is one of the Prime Minister's closest advisers.
 The announcement of his projected visit comes just a month
 after the first Communist-line "peace" conference and two
 weeks following the first public Communist Party meeting in
 Kashmir.  These events suggest that the Communists now feel
 strong enough to conduct regular overt operations.   (Factual
 data from: U New Delhi 990, 8 Sept 52)

 General Fahrmbacher,
 rman m     ary adviser, met privately with General
 Nagib several times prior to the July coup.  On these oc-
 casions Fahrmbacher allegedly furnished Nagib with detailed
 plans for occupying and holding Cairo.
 Immediately following the coup Nagib praised the German
 officers in the presence of both his Egyptian military staff
 a.nd the German advisers.                                              25X1A
 Comment:   Several reports have indicated, that the German
 military advisers in Egypt played a smaller part in the
 military coup than press accounts have suggested.
 This group, which has been characterized as an economic
 mission, consists of approximately 25 officers.   Thus far
 the Bonn government has shown no interest in securing their
 services.

 18,            Communists plan internptional conference on German problcm:
 A preparatory committee for an                  conference for tTh
 "peaceful solution of the German problem" met in Prague on 4
 September. The meeting, attended by British, East German, Bel-
 gian, French and Czech delegates, drew up resolutions against
 the West German threat to the "peace campaign." (C Prague 150,
 5 Sept 52)
 Comment:  The Communist meeting is one of three commissions
 set up at the World Peace Council in Berlin to prevent ratifi-
 cation of the EDC and contractual agreements.   It is probably.
 now designed to allay any fears of East European Satellites re-
 garding East German rearmament:,  In a speech of 5 September,
 -East.German Foreign Minister Dertinger felt the need to point
 out that East German rearmament was for peaceful purposes.
 19.         Leipzig Fair used for Soviet propaganda: In a speech at
 the opening of the Leipzig Fair on 7 September the Deputy Prime
 Minister of the German Democratic Republic described'one of its
 primary missions as the promotion of East-West trade J.n line with
 the great effort initiated earlier this year by the Moscow Econo-
 mic Conference.   (R FBIS Berlin, 8 Sept 52)
 Comment: At the Vienna Fair the USSR is exhibiting a variety
 of Soviet industrial and consumer products but apparently is not
 taking orders, advertising only that a number of the sample items
 may be purchased after the closing of the fair.   The Satellite
 countries are expected to stage exhibits on a smaller scale at
 succeeding trade fairs in other European cities.
 20.   West German parties to oppose discussions with East German
 commiTs on:  According to American officials in Bonn, the 5
 September proposal of the East German Government to send a five-
 man delegation to the Federal Republic to discuss unification
 will be opposed by all leading West German political parties.
 The politicians available for comment have generally rejected
 the offer as a ruse.
 Even the executive committee of the opposition Social
 Democratic Party has declared that "tinder ro circumstances"
 could the West German parliament negotiate with the East German
 parliament since such negotiations were reserved for the four
 occupation powers.   (C Bonn 1028, 6. Sept 52)

 Comment: Bonn has not yet officially received the East
 German proposal.   In the probable event of its rejection, the
 East German Government may try to prolong its propaganda maneuver
 by getting West German Communist-front groups to send "unofficial"
 representatives.
 21.          Socialist opposition to Bonn's foreign policies seen
 moderating: The West German Social Democratic Party is already
 show ng 1gno of moderating its opposition to the government's
 foreign policies following the death of its former leader, Kurt
 Schumacher.
 At a recent party meeting, Carlo Schmid, chairman of the.
 parliamentary foreign affairs committee, boldly advocated that
 the party reverse its stand on European integration after the
 ratification of the Bonn and Paris treaties.   He also  declared
 that the party should develop aggressive policies which would
 accelerate the development of a united Europe.
 While his statements were received with interest and appar-
 ently without opposition, such a switch in party tactics is
 somewhat unlikely, because the party's opposition has become too
 extreme to be suddenly reversed prior to next year's federal elec-
 tions, now tentatively scheduled for June.  Because Schmid will
 play an even larger role in party affairs than previously, how-
 ever, he and other moderates will at least soften the opposition
 to Adenauer's foreign policies.   (Factual data from:  C Bonn
 891 and 1016, 8 Aug and 6 Sept 52)
 22,        Three Saar officials protest against possible reintegration
 with Germany:  Following press reports on the possible return
 to   rmany of that portion of the Saar which was German prior
 to 1945, three Saar officials from this area filed oral protests
 in early August with the Saar Minister of the Interior against
 exclusion of any part of their districts from Europeanization.
 The American Consulate in Strasbourg observes that these
 officials may have been acting tc protect their political future,
 but that it seems more reasonable to assume that each was acting
 on what he conceives to be the desire of the population concerned.

 Comment: The Saarlanders are showing increasing enthusiasm
 for Europeanization which would protect the economic advantages
 they already enjoy and also bring with it the benefit of having
 the Schuman Plan High Authority located in Saarbruecken.
 23.           Argentine revolt reportedly scheduled for mid-September:
 25X1X
 25X6
 An Argentine revolt starting in the interior provinces  s
 scheduled for mid-September                                              25X1X
 Civilians, as well as members o   the armed forces, will
 participate.   The new government  is to be temporarily headed
 by an army-navy-air triumvirate.
 The government-dominated General Confederation of Labor
 recently distributed 8,000 pistols to "loyal" followers.   The
 underground was immediately able to buy 1,200 of them.   (S USNAVA
 Buenos Aires, 051935Z Sept 52; S USNAVA Montevideo, 051345Z
 Sept 52)
 Comment: An Argentine exile recently told the US Embassy in
 Montev      that eleven unidentified army generals and certain
 military garrisons were "completely in sympathy" with a revolt
 against the government. He also stated that Peron undoubtedly
 suspects a revolt,`but does not know where to look for it.   This
 revolutionary group reportedly includes men involved in the
 September 1951 attempt led by the anti-US General Menendez.

 25.         Venezuelan reaction to American "oil cartel" investigation
 still undecided:    Venezuelan reaction to the     Federal Trade
 Comm ss on s report on the alleged international cartel arrange-
 ments of major American oil companies is still cautious and
 guarded. Six of the seven companies accused operate in Vene-
 zuela, and three of them are responsible for over 85 percent
 of the country's production.
 Although the two major political parties and several pro-
 minent dailies have renewed their periodic attacks on "big
 companies" and the Venezuelan petroleum laws, opinion in general
 seems to be that the accusations must be examined carefully and
 that whatever the outcome, the charges will play into the hands
 of Communists everywhere. The government, which: stands to lose
 prestige if it appears to have been duped, has commented merely
 that final judgment must await the outcome of court proceedings.
 In. the past, neither the Venezuelan Government nor any
 important segment of public opinion has favored "cracking down"
 on the  American companies, most of which have good public re-
 lations and have provided valued public services.   Now, however,
 there appears to be a growing feeling that an investigation in
 Venezuela similar to the one in the TTnited States will be a
 political necessity.   At least one top Venezuelan official hopes
 that such an investigation can be avoided, but fears that the
 publicity received so far will force the government to be
 "tougher" in its dealings with the companies.   (Factual data from:
