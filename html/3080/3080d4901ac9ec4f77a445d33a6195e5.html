1. UK views on Hong Kong aircraft--US Embassy London 
has been informed by the UK Minister of State for For-
eigh Affairs that he is not sanguine about the chances 
for a favorable British response to the strong US pro-
test against British acquiescence to the removal by 
Chinese Communists of aircraft parts (and ultimately 
the aircraft) now under litigation in Hong Kong. The� 
Minister expressed the opinion that under present law 
the British Government could not interfere with further 
withdrawals of the aircraft equipment by the Communists; 
he added that his government could effect only a tempo-
rary delay before permitting the Chinese Communists to 
remove the aircraft. 
(CIA Comment: The firm determination of the 
UK, despite US protests, to avoid antagonizing the Chinese 
Communists over the issue of the aircraft and aircraft 
equipment in Hong Kong reflects primarily British fears 
that the Chinese Communist regime will take retaliatory 
measures against the British in Hong Kong or the im-
portant British interests in China.)

I. French statement on Indochina urged--The Department 
of State has asked US Embassy Paris to make "strong 
oral representations" to the French pointing to the urgent 
�need for a public statement regarding the evolutionary 
nature of French agreements with the three new states in 
Indochina and emphasizing that the purpose of the agree-
ments is to establish ultimately the complete sovereignty 
and independence-of the three new states within the French 
Union, The Department points out that US attempts to gain 
recognition by non-Communist Asian regimes for these 
states, which is considered a matter of prime importance, 
have met with limited success because most Asian countries 
continue to view the new regimes as "French puppets." In 
the Department's opinion, much greater Asian support would 
become possible after such a French announcement. The 
Department believes that, without such .a statement, French 
accomplishments and intentions in Indochina may be "tragically 
misunderstood," both in Asia and throughout the Western world.

position Socialist Party .(SPD) that: ('a) their party's position 
will not affect the outcome of the Bundestag vote; and (b) the . 
SPD will send representatives to the Council of Europe if 
Germany becomes a member. McCloy expresses the opinion

3. GERMANY: Suggestions on all-German electoral law--
US High Commissioner McCloy in Frankfurt proposes that 
the High Commissioners of the three occupation powers be 
. authorized to issue a communique giving "full support" to 
the recent public proposals of the Federal Republic in regard 
to all-German elections. McCloy suggests that the proposed 
communique include a statement of Western willingness to 
deal with the Soviet Control Commission for the sole purpose 
of framing a law to govern elections to an all-German con-
stituent assembly. McCloy expresses the view that, although 
the principle of a constituent assembly (to draft an all-German 
constitution) was not put forward by the Western Powers at 
the last meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers, such 
an assembly would "in no way 'endanger" the west German 
basic law. McCloy believes that it is of paramount importance 
to the USSR to legitimize the east German regime and expresses 
the view that the proper timing of the proposed Western offer 
of an all-German electoral law could interfer with the Kremlin's 
timetable in legitimizing the east German regime.

4, CZECHOSLOVAKIA: US attitude toward future relations--
The Department of State, in response to estimates that 
the Czech Government is considering making a major attack 
against principal Foreign Ministries, has authorized Am-
bassador Briggs in Prague to attempt as soon as possible 
a comprehensive and forthraglit survey of US-Czech re-
lations with the new Czech Foreign Minister. Briggs is to 
indicate to the Czech Foreign Minister that the US would be 
obliged to act in its own protection if the Czechs ignore 
accepted diplomatic standards and disregard� American 
rights. The Department informs Briggs that, if his re-
presentations have no effect in deterring the Czechs from 
taking some drastic step against the US, retaliatory measures 
against Czechoslovakia will probably become necessary. The 
Department also authorizes the Ambassador to discuss the 
possibility of a tripartite approach along these lines with the 
British and French Ambassadors and to inform them that the 
US will act unilaterally if a. tripartite cour�e is not possible.

Ambassadors to European nations, meeting in Rome, have 
agreed that the US should continue its general policy in 
Western Germany, with perhaps increased emphasis 
upon action designed to counter increasingly vigorous 
"Soviet infiltration and propaganda." .The Ambassadors 
recommend that: (a) the Western protest over the forma-
tion of an East German military force be expedited; (b) the 
western occupation powers repeat their offer of free elec-
tions in Germany; and (c) "vigorous and immediate efforts" 
be made with respect to Berlin, especially to relieve the 
"pressing" economic situation, The US Ambassadors con-
sider Berlin's retention to be "vital" to the West. The 
US Ambassadors also recommend � that the policy of non-
recognition of the German Democratic Republic be rigidly 
maintained and that a Western tripartite or larger con-
ference be held to discuss the German refugee and ex-

next meeting should be held in Berlin, probably in July 1950, 
2. US views on Hong Kong aircraft--The Department of State 
has instructed US Ambassador Douglas in London to make 
strong representations to the UK Government at the highest

to deny to the Chinese Communists the former Chinese 
Nationalist aircraft and aircraft equipment now the subject 
of litigation in Hong Kong. (A Hong Kong court recently 
refused to grant an injunction freezing the former Chinese 
Nationalist aircraft and aircraft equipment pending the 
outcome of current litigation.) The Department points out 
that British acquiescence to withdrawal of further equip-
ment or planes by the Chinese Communists would contribute 
directly to the military potential of the Soviet sphere and 
.inay.seriously prejudice US-UK relations and current 
prospects for US military and economic aid to the UK.

3. GREECE: Prime Minister may resign--US Ambassador 
Grady reports that in a recent conversation Greek Prime 
�Minister Venizelos appeared extremely worried over 
the stability of his government and over possible difficulties 
within his own Liberal Party. �Grady expresses the opinion 
that Venizelos may resign before Parliament convene 
31 March 1950 and may offer to support the candidacy of 
General Plastiras in the belief that these voluntary actions 
now would help save his own prestige and that of the Liberal 
Party. 
(CIA Comment: CIA agrees that Venizelos may be 
compelled by mounting popular and political pressure to 
resign before parliament convenes, although his resigna-
tion might be delayed because of continued maneuvering 
by the King. CIA further believes that the termination of 
the present government, by making possible the forma-
tion of a broadly based coalition government under Plastiras, 
would tend to increase Greek political stability.)

1. US Ambassadors survey world situation--The US Ambas-
sadors to European nations meeting in Rome, in reviewing 
the world situation as it affects the US, have agreed that 
the Western Powers should intensify their efforts to check-
mate Soviet aggressive action throughout the world. The 
US Ambassadors urge, in line with these intensified anti-
Communist efforts by the West, that: (a) the US launch a 
vigorous propaganda campaign to recapture for the West 
the leadership in the world movement for peace; and (b) the 
North Atlantic Treaty (NAT) Council be convened early in 
May to consider the establishment within the NAT system 
of a "strong, high-level means of direction." The Ambas-
sadors strongly suggest that serious thought be given to 
utilizing German material and supplies in building the de-
fense of Western Europe and that the relationship of the US 
and UK throughout the world be clarified, including the UK's 
role in European affairs. The Ambassadors are convinced 
that the preservation of Southeast Asia from Communism 
should be a cardinal point of US policy, and believe it is of 
the utmost urgency to take steps to hold that area.

ANNEX 
28 March 1950 
INCREASED TENSION BETWEEN INDIA AND PAKISTAN 
Tension between India and Pakistan has increased 
seriously during the past few days. In India, where press, 
public, and government feeling regarding the safety of the 
Hindu minority in East Bengal continues to run high, Prime 
Minister Nehru has reportedly Intimated that although he 
personally continues to oppose war with Pakistan he would 
be forced to send troops across the East Pakistan border if 
new anti-Hindu violence should break out there. The recent 
buildup of Indian Army troops and supplies _near Pakistan's 
West Punjab border has led the Pakistan Government to 
urgently request the US", the UK, Canada, and Australia to 
counsel India to move its troops back from the frontier; and 
Pakistan Army leaders feel that they should have already 
countered India's military buildup by strengthening their 
own border forces. 
Although the situation will undoubtedly remain ex-
plosive, there is some possibility that friction at the highest 
level between India and Pakistan might be lessened through 
a meeting of the two prime ministers; the US has strongly 
suggested to both governments that such a meeting is of 
"prime importance." Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan of 
Pakistan recently sent a long personal letter to Nehru 
inviting the latter to visit Karachi for a personal discussion 
of the situation, an action which parallels previous efforts 
on the part of Nehru. Although the two prime ministers 
are likely to have some difficulty in reaching agreement on 
the time and place, such a meeting may take place and could 
lead to a top level understanding on methods for reducing the 
present critical tensions between the peoples in the two 
countries.

I. Australian attitude toward Pacific defense pact--US Embassy 
Canberra has been informed by Australian Minister of External 
Affairs Spender that his government desires to do everything 
possible to promote a Pacific pact which would include mili-
tary commitments. In Spender's view, however, no Pacific 
nation or group of nations can be expected to embark on a 
course which without US backing might prove "futile and even 
disastrous." Spender believes that discussions at the forth-
coming Baguio Conference (called by the Philippine Govern-
ment) will be futile, because of the lack of support by Asian 
countries themselves and the absence of support from the US.

2. GERMANY: Reform of German interzonal trade set-up urged--
The Berlin branch of the US High Commission in Germany be-

ing German interzonal trade. - The Berlin branch recommends 
that the Federal Republic's interzonal trade negotiator be re-

lished on the Soviet Zone border; the branch-also suggests that 
preparations for sanctions which could be applied to the German 
Democratic Republic whenever it departs from the interzonal 
trade agreement should be completed. The branch proposes 
to ban at once iron and steel shipments and 40 percent of other 
shipments to East Germany until the present trade unbalance 
ends.

(a) communication equipment for civil police; (b) earth-moving 
equipment for the clearing of jungle roads, resettlement 
areas, and airstrips; and (c) educational personnel to assist 
in reorienting the present pro-China and pro-Communist

1, GREECE: New Cabinet formed--According to US Charge 
Minor in Athens, the Venizelos Cabinet appointed on 23 March 
creates the impression of -an imposed solution to frustrate 
the freely expressed will of the Greek people and exposes 
the Palace to charges of political favoritism and intrigue. 
Minor expresses the view that the Venizelos Cabinet will not 
receive the support of the other centrist leaders (Plastiras 
and Papandreou), will be tolerated by the rightist parties 
only so long as they see fit, and does not even have the full 
backing of Venizelos' own Liberal Party. Minor adds that 
the new Cabinet will seek a vote of confidence and then sus-
pend Parliament for at least three months, but that the first 
meeting of Parliament may be postponed from 30 March 
until 17 April. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that the Venizelos 
Cabinet may, with considerable difficulty, be able to stay 
in power temporarily, but lacks the basis for effective par-
liamentary government. The centrist majority in the pre-
sent parliament, upon which any viable government would 
have to depend, has been seriously split by Venizelos' action, 
and an impasse may develop necessitating a new national 
election soon. In such an election, the Greek people would 
show increased displeasure with the established major poli-
tical parties, and as a result of the Palace's political in-
triguing might again become sharply divided into traditional 
monarchist and republican camps, to the great detriment of 
the nation's stability.)

'Jarman in Canberra reports that the newly-elected Liberal-

In Jarman's opinion, this "bold and vigorous" action indi-

points out that the action appears to have strong popular 
support and predicts that the government "stands a good

US Embassy Brussels has been informed by former Belgian 
Premier Spaak that there is "not the slightest doubt" that 
a majority of the Belgian Ministers of State (an advisory 
group of "elder statesmen" who have been called into 
special session) will favor a formula providing for the 
� dignified and honorable abdication of King Leopold. Spaak 
described Carton de Wiart, who has been called on by the 
Regent to form a government,-as� a "moderate" on the 
subject of the King's return. Spaak expressed the opinion 
that his Socialist Party (which has heretofore adamantly 
opposed Leopold's return)"would display excellent manners" 
if Leopold would agree to return and then abdicate.

3. IRAN: Shah !Limes Ali Mansur as Prime Minister�US 
AmbasSadror Wiley in Tehran reports that the Shah has 
accepted the resignation of Prime Minister Saed's Cabi-
net-and has appointed All Mansur to form a new govern-
ment in its place. According to -Wiley, the immediate 
popular reaction to the -Shah's action was one of bitter 
disappointment and increased frustration. Wiley adds 
that Prince Abdor Reza (the Shah's personal representative 
in the Seven-Year Plan Organization) now plans to withdraw 
from active participation in economic affairs and that Minis-
ter of National Economy Taq'i Nasr has indicated that he 
will not continue in office with what he calls "the most 
corrupt and self-seeking elements in the country." 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that the Shah's appoint-
ment of Mansur may well have been motivated by fears that 
his weak political position called for appeasement of the 
powerful landowners and other vested interests .with whom 
Mansur has long been associated. CIA considers that, re-
gardless of the Shah's motive, Mansur 's appointment will 
probably reduce progress toward the economic and political 
stabilization which Iran needs, particularly because the 
Shah's appointment of a man with Mansur's reputation will 
alienate the progressive elements in the population and dis-
courage the general popular hope that the Shah could put 
through a reform program. Moreover, the new government 
will be handicapped by the withdrawal of the two most promin-
ent men in Iran's economic and social development program.)

Embassy Paris reports that French Defense Minister 
Pleven is greatly concerned over the arrival dates of 
.MDAP shipments, because the French Army will be at 
half strength from 15 to 25 April 1950, when one class 
of conscripts will have been released and the new class

the initial MDAP shipment will arrive well before. 
15 April and that the next shipment will not arrive until 
after 25 April. The Embassy urgently recommends: 
(a) that every effort be made to speed the initial MDAP 
shipment; and (b) that Pleven be informed as soon as 
possible of the approximate arrival time of the shipment. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that the French 
Government's capabilities for coping with serious dis-
orders between 15 and 25 April will be seriously weakened, 
because immediately after the present conscript class is 
released on 15 April, the troop units in France will con-
sist almost entirely of conscripts having, about four 
months' training.)

According to US Consulate Lahore, US Military Attache 
Meyers has been informed by Pakistan Army headquarters 
that a steady buildup of Indian Army troops and supplies 
along the East Punjab border opposite Lahore has been 
taking place since 5 March 1950. Meyers reports that the 
Pakistan Army Chief of Staff interprets these military 
moves as part of a plan to provoke Pakistan into taking 
the military initiative and feels that, failing in this, the"next 
step" for India would be to declare the present Kashmir 
cease-fire line final and dismiss the UN observers there. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes the reported troop 
movements probably have taken place and the fears of the 
Pakistan Army Chief of Staff may well be justified. CIA 
considers that although the Indian Government dbes not 
want war, it has clearly indicated a determination to re-
tain all of the territory it occupies in Kashmir. India may, 
therefore, adopt provocative tactics, in the hope of either 
maneuvering Pakistan into becoming the aggressor or 
establishing so clearly Pakistan's reluctance to open 
hostilities as to indicate probable acceptance of steps 
aimed at consolidating India's present position in Kashmir.)

US Ambassador Douglas in London Atrongly recommends that 
the US provide "diplomatic assistance' to the British during 
the impending negotiations between the UK and Egypt regard-
ing mutual defense arrangements. According to Douglas, 
a British Foreign Office spokesman expressed the hope that 
the US could make it clear to the Egyptian Government that 
it would be useless for Egypt to attempt to "play off the 
US against the UK," and suggested that US Army Chief of 
Staff Collins (who is. expected to be in Cairo about 4 April) 
might take the opportunity to talk to King Farouk frankly 
concerning the present world situation. The Foreign Office 
spokesman expressed the view that King Farouk has been

that time will be needed before the Wafd Government, which 
has been out of power for some time, will Inodify its present

believes there would be no difficulty in getting immediate 
Assembly approval of such a resolution addressed to the

clearly demonstrate to the Germans and the rest of the 
world the cynicism behind the Berlin Youth Rally scheduled 
for 28 May, which is ostensibly for "peace, unity, national 
independence, and a better life." McCloy also points out 
that if the USSR accepts the election proposal, the West 
should insist on complete freedom of speech during the 
campaign throughout Berlin, and should readmit the USSR 
to the Kommandatura only after the elimination of the veto. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that the USSR is un-
likely to agree to the holding of city-wide elections in 
Berlin on terms acceptable to the West.)

US Ambassador Caffery in Cairo has learned from British 
officials there that an Egyptian note, calling for an early Brit-
ish withdrawal from Suez and the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, is 
en route to London for delivery to Foreign Secretary Bevin. 
According to the British, the note was moderately worded, 
largely because King Farouk insisted that the original draft 
be "toned down." 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that the Egyptian Gov-
ernment, which had been expected to reopen negotiations re-
garding its alliance with the UK, is probably asking for more 
than it expects to get, both for bargaining purposes and for 
home consumption. CIA further believes that: (a) the UK 
may agree to concessions in the Suez Canal area; (b) it is un-
likely that the UK will agree to withdraw from the Sudan; and 
(c) Anglo-Egyptian discussions will probably be both prolonged 
and involved.)

UK Foreign Office has expressed an initially unfavorable 
opinion of a recommendation made by the British Am-
bassador in Prague that the US, UK, and France issue 
a joint warning to the Czechoslovak Foreign Minister 
against further "spy trials" involving Western nationals. 
The Foreign Office explained this attitude by stating its 
view that (1) there is no indication that any such trial 
is in the offing; (2) Western demands would be unlikely 
to stop the trial if it were being planned, and (3) a 
Western demarche might even impel the Czechoslovaks 
to organize one.

Ambassador Grady reports that while discussing the Greek 
political situation with Kingftul, he warned the King against 
his expressed desire to form a government other than one 
based on the centrist bloc headed by Plastiras. Indicating 
his belief that such a centrist solution would reflect the will 
of the Greek people as revealed in the recent election, Grady 
told the King that any other solution would bring criticism 
upon the Palace for interference and Greece would be thrown 
into a period of political confusion as the result of an un-
stable government. In answer to King Paul's expressed 
fear that the US would become disgusted with Plastiras and 
withdraw aid, Grady assured him the US would be more dis-
turbed by political confusion than by the designation of 
Plastiras as prime minister. Grady pointed out that by-
passing Plastiras would force him to join forces with the 
leftists, thus creating a strong leftist group which might 
ultimately take political control of Greece. Grady concluded 
by pointing out to the King the dangers of further delay in 
forming a new government.

le Situation in Iran termed "especially dangerous"--US 
Embassy Moscow views the current situation in Iran as 
"especially dangerous" and believes the USSR will be 
quick to exploit the situation. The Embassy adds that 
the fall of Iran to the USSR would have an extremely 
depressing effect on the entire Middle East. As possible 
remedial action, the Embassy suggests that surplus US 
foodstuffs, clothing, and medicines be distributed in Iran 
and that a "high calibre" American be sent to Iran to 
prepare a list of urgent projects for submission either 
to the Export-Import Bank or to the US Congress. The 
Embassy comments that such a visit, properly publicized, 
would have a heartening effect in Iran and would notify 
the USSR that the US does not propose to let Iran fall into 
Soviet hands by default. 
2. Views on German unity issue--US Embassy Moscow

zation" of the claim that the GDR and National Front 
speak in the name of all Germany. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes the USSR is unlikely 
to conclude an early separate peace treaty with the GDR 
unless the Western Powers conclude a separate treaty 
with the,Bonn Government in the near future.)

that to think of present-day Germany as a source of aggres-
sive action against the Western Powers is absurd. Pointing 
out that the question is not a sentimental but realistic one, 
he asserted that Western Germany must be used as bulwark 
against the "only visible danger," the USSR. Eyskens be-
lieves that Western Europe must have a minimum of 80 
equipped divisions and that the defense of the area is im-
possible without German participation. Murphy stresses 
that these views are personal to Eyskens, not the views of 
the Belgian Government, but indicates such views are the 
private opinion of "other leading Belgians."

that because of the negative attitude of the Yugoslav Gov-

to take no further action at present in a settlement of the

(CIA Comment: CIA believes that India, despite 
its continuing vocal objections to the principles embodied 
in the UN resolution, will finally accept it "under protest," 
as a means both of easing tensions with Pakistan and 
obtaining a new procedural basis for arguing the impractica-

likely to accept the resolution only if it becomes convinced 
that the objective of an impartial over-all plebiscite will 
not be abandoned as a result of negotiations carried out by 
the mediator.)

Charge Villard in Oslo expresses the opinion that although 
there are chronic isolationists in Nonni, the Norwegian 
Government and general public have an 'inner conviction" 
that Norway is correct in aligning with the Atlantic com-
munity and believe that the survival of Norway as a nation 
is intimately linked with the future of Western civilization. 
Villard says that the Norwegian will to fight, which he feels 
is strong, is based on the expectation of US aid and on con-
fidence in, the active implementation of the Atlantic Pact. 
He believes that the arrival of MDAP material will have 
profound psychological effects on the people. According 
to Villard, the Norwegians are under no illusions that they 
could withstand an invasion by the USSR and foresee 
national extinction as the result of such an attack.

1. JORDAN: Abdullah forced to recall "anti ..treaty" Cabinet 
USMinister Drew in Amman has been informed that King 
Abdullah has been forced to prevail upon Tawfiq Pasha to 
withdraw his resignation as Prime Minister -(recently sub-
mitted in protest against Abdullah's proposed settlement 
with Israel). Drew comments that although an eventual 
resumption of the Israeli negotiations is not precluded, this 
development represents a major setback for the King and 
will probably make further attempts on his part to obtain 
a settlement much more difficult. Drew's informant ex-
pressed the view that the Cabinet's opposition to the King's 
proposed settlement resulted from unwillingness to offend 
the other Arab League states, whose press and radio had 
already begun violent attacks on Jordan. Drew's informant 
attributed Abdullah's current difficulties to the King's 
insistence on speed in the negotiations, and suggested that 
the Cabinet might have found an acceptable formula if given 
more time to study the matter. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that this setback to 
King. Abdallih, who appeared powerful enough to ignore 
public opinion,demonstrates the continuing importance and 
strength of anti-Zionist feeling among Arabs.)

I. FINLAND: Communists may be included in new Cabinet--
US Minister Cabot in Helsinki has learned from various 
quarters that� responsible businessmen, government officials, 
and politicians are considering the inclusion of Communists 
in unimportant positions in the new Cabinet. Cabot adds that 
the apparent Finnish intention would be to place the Commu-
nists in positions where they wil,1 be "well hedged in." The 
Minister expresses the opinion that there may be some vali-
dity to the argument that the inclusisin of the Communists 
in the Cabinet will "draw their domestic political sting" 
by making it difficult for the Communists to avoid responsi-
bility for damage to the Finnish economy resulting from 
their irresponsible agitation. In reviewing the "obviously 
formidable" objections to including Communists in the Fin-
nish Cabinet, Cabot points out that the Communists would 
try, regardless of government precautions, to gain control 
of the government. The Minister also expresses concern 
� 
regarding the unfavorable effect the reversal of Finland's 
attitude toward the Communists would have in other Euro-
pean countries, particularly those where Communists had

High Commissioner comments that the military capabili-
ties of this organization, which is under complete Soviet 
control, will remain negligible for at least another eight 
months. McCloy suggests that a Western protest against 
Soviet remilitarization activities would: (a) serve as 
a basis for further Western propaganda against the pro-
gram; (b) register Western moral indignation; (c) under-
mine to some extent the current Soviet "peace" propa-
ganda line; and (d) let the East Germans know that the

1. Western European attitude toward neutrality:--US Ambas-

of neutrality in the East-West struggle has been debated in 
the French press, there is no indication of a swing in public 
opinion against the North Atlantic Treaty (NAT) and the 
Military Defense Assistance Program. Bruce is convinced 
that the French Government retains its original motives

If attacked during the spring of 1950, the Belgian Govern-

NAT. Murphy adds that the Belgians would fight at a later 
date if they thought their side would be successful, but that 
they have no desire to be "liberated again." 
US Charge Villard in Oslo expresses some concern 
over what seems to be growing apprehension among Nor-
wegian newspaper writers and individual businessmen that 
the hydrogen bomb negates all efforts to prevent war. Villard 
reports, however, that he ha 8 detected no sign of doubts or 
waning enthusiasm in government circles or among Norwegian 
people generally regarding the principles of mutual defense. 
- US Embassy The Hague believes the Dutch are "not 
greatly attracted by the neutrality idea." The Embassy adds, 
however, that there are indications of a revival of neutrality 
sentiment among Western Europeans and that there is some 
suspicion that the US has abandoned the policy of containing 
the USSR without making an alternative known.

people of Rumania, reports that the initial gratification 
of the non-Communist majority at the vigorous US action

such an attack would start World War Em Allen's in-

(CIA Comment: CIA believes that although Yugo-. 
slav leaders are probably genuinely concerned over the 
possibility of some major Cominform move during the 
spring of 1950, Tito's current expressions of alarm are 
calculated primarily to counteract the unfavorable impres-
sion resulting from both Yugoslav recognition of Ho Chi 
Minh in Indochina and recent anti-Western speeches 
apparently designed for Cominform and internal consump-

there present the "most grave" threat to the peace of South 
Asia since partition. According to Henderson, Nehru has 
stated that atrocities committed against minorities in East 
Bengal (Pakistan) have produced an atmosphere which might 
result in a general exodus of a substantial proportion of 
East Bengal's 12 million Hindus if India were to permit 
them to enter; Nehru also expressed fear that a violent com-
munal reaction beyond the ability of the government to con-
trol might take place throughout India. Henderson suggests 
that although British observers question the "authentic 
quality" of the present Bengal crisis, believing it possibly 
inspired by a desire to prejudice the UN Security Council 
debate on Kashmir, the situation remains dangerous if only 
because of Indian emotion over the matter.

US High Commissioner McCloy in Frankfurt reports that 
there is increasing evidence that a persistent and formidable 
effort will be made by the USSR during 1950 to gain heavy 
advantages in Berlin, "if not to take over the city." To 
counteract Soviet pressure, McCloy suggests: (a) an im-
mediate announcement by the ECA nations that they are pre-
pared to increase their purchases in Berlin; (b) the institu-
tion of an increased US public works program in Berlin to 
reduce unemployment and bolster morale; and (c) designation 
by the Bonn Government of Berlin as a "distressed area" and 
the speed-up of relief measures by the West German Republic. 
McCloy reports that the Allied Council has agreed to reinforce 
Western troops in Berlin against a possible emergency in 
connection with the Free German Youth rally scheduled for 
May 1950 and to undertake a further recruitment of local 
police. In, discussing the over-all German problem, McCloy

Jordanian representatives have initialed an "agreed set 
of principles" as a basis for a five-year "friendship and 
non-aggression" pact. According to the Israeli spokesman, 
the "agreed principles" include a joint Israel-Jordan 
guarantee of access to and freedom of the Holy Places, 
continuance of present armistice lines, and initiation of 
normal commercial intercourse between the two countries. 
McDonald adds that another meeting is to be held 28 Feb-

1. British release aircraft to Chinese Communists--US 
Consul General Rankin in Hong Kong reports that the 
British court in Hong Kong has lifted the injunction 
involving the assets of two Chinese airlines and that 
only registration formalities remain to be accomplished 
-before the Communists fly the aircraft away. Rankin 
believes that the actions of Hong Kong executive and 
judicial authorities can be explained only if they have 
been in possession of highly secret instructions from 
London to see that the Communists obtain the aircraft 
under any-circumstances. Rankin points out that this 
action demonstrates a fundamental divergence between 
the US and British attitudes toward Communist China.

I. French views on Indochina--US Ambassador Bruce in 
Paris has been informed by French Foreign Minister 
Schuman that he regards Indochina as primarily a 
French responsibility and that he would like to get im-
mediate US aid in considerable quantities. According. 
to Bruce, Schuman believes that French evacuation of 
Indochina would: (a) lead to a massacre of French 
troops, French civilians, and natives; (b) cause grave 
political disturbances in France.; (c) have a serious 
effect on the French Union, especially in Africa; and 
(d) create an impression of Western defeatism. Schuman 
asserted that France's ability to continue in Indochina 
would have to be considered in connection with the over-
all policy to be adopted by the US, UK, and France in 
regard to the Far East. Meanwhile, the Secretary General 
of the French Foreign Ministry has told Bruce that France 
intends to follow an "evolutionary process') with the Indo-
chinese regimes, but doubts the wisdom of publicizing this 
intention. 
2. Southeast Asia situation reviewed--US Ambassador Kirk 
in Moscow expresses the belief that "everything possible 
short of involvement of US fighting forces' should be done 
to stop the Communists before they control Indochina 
Thailand, and Burma. The Ambassador, in support of 
his position, expresses the view that: (a) "drawing the 
line at the Chinese border will have a vital psychological 
effect throughout Asia; and (b) preventing the Chinese Com-
munists from extending their influence in Southeast Asia 
and from obtaining foodstuffs there will expose Sino-Soviet 
relations to a strain which both partners may be hoping to 
avoid. Kirk points out that Japan's economic development

I. Reported Soviet military preparations in Austria --US 
Ambassador Johnson in Rio de Janeiro reports that the 
Brazilian Minister in Vienna has been informed by 
Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber that he is "absolutely 
sure" the Soviet command in Vienna began about twenty 
days ago military preparations which indicate the USSR 
is planning large-scale military action. In support of 
his conviction, Gruber stated that: (a) new strategic 
points in Austria have been occupied by considerable 
Soviet forces; (b) large quantifies of modeern materiel 
� 
and equipment are continuously arriving at Soviet garri-
sons; and (c) Soviet lines of communication are being 
carefully protected by new contingents of selected troops. 
Gruber also assured the Brazilian Minister that he is ex-
pecting momentarily a Soviet "surprise" in Europe, not 
excluding the possibility of the opening of hostilities in 
some sector. 
(CIA Comment: CIA has no reliable information 
justifying the belief that the USSR is planning large-scale 
military action in Europe in the immediate future. CIA 
believes, however, that the preponderance of Soviet mili-
tary strength in Europe and stringent security measures 
in the Soviet sphere provide the USSR with the capabilities 
for initiating military operations with little or no advance 
information becoming available to the Western Powers.) 
2, Increased Communist pressure in Southeast Asia predicted--

1. Western European attitude toward defense planning--The 
US coordinating committee for European military aid (ECC) 
expresses concern over the first signs of diminishing 
European public conviction of the "essential rightness" 
of proceeding resolutely with combined North. Atlantic 
Treaty defense planning. ECC believes that development 
of this tendency, together with such unsettling events as 
the H-bomb and Soviet successes in the Far East, "could 
lead to a resurgence of the neutrality complex" in Western 
Europe and a weakening of the will to build Western soli-
darity and strength. 
2. Southeast Asian views on the Bao Dai Government--The

reporting the impressions gained from the recently con-

to be a "French puppet" and are not prepared to support 
his government unless its status is modified drastically. 
The AssistantSecretary recommends that US assistance 
to Indochina be contingent upon a public agreement by the 
French to take steps which would lead to Indochina's 
achieving a status similar to that of Indonesia.

1. soviet jitotives tn_Berliniraffic.4tualtion--US High 
Commissioner McCloy in Frankfurt suggests that the 
Intermittent slowdown of truck traffic to Berlin may be 
motivated by Soviet desires to: (a) prevent the unauthor-
ized shipment of materials and goods from the East Zone; 
(b) divert shipments from trucks to trains, because the 
Reichsbahn needs the revenue and trains are easier to 
control; and (c) test the firmness of Western policy in 
Berlin. McCloy expresses the opinion that pressure on 
the USSR through a selective embargo on industrial and 
raw material items badly needed in the Soviet Zone would 
be more effective and less open to Soviet reprisal than a 
general imposition of traffic restrictions. 
(CIA Comment: CIA concurs in this analysis of 
the Berlin traffic situation.) 
2. ECC views on strikes against military aid shipments 
TheUS coordinating committee for European military aid 
(ECC), in estimating the purposes of the current Commu-

European popular fear of war by instilling doubts regard-
ing the objectives of the North Atlantic Pact and US policy; 
and (b) convince the US Congress and US public that MDAP 
Is a waste of money and equipment because European 
recipients of military aid are unreliable allies. ECC be
that physical interference with MDAP shipments is 
a secondary objective and that the Communists have no 
illusions regarding their ability to interfere seriously, with 
deliveries.

3. France to call on US for aid to Indochina--According to 
US Charge Bohlen in Paris, French Ambassador Bonnet 
in Washington has been instructed to request large-scale 
US assistance to Indochina on a long-term basis. Bonnet's 
instructions reportedly convey the view of the French Gov-
ernment that a US-UK-French conference on Indochina is 
less urgent at this time than a direct approach to the US 
with a view to ascertaining the general attitude of the US. 
Bohlen recommends that Bonnet be impressed both with 
the importance of development by the French of a "concrete 
and realistic" program for Indochina and with the primary 
responsibility of France in that area. 
4. Proposals to improve Austrian position--US Minister 
Erhardt in Vienna expresses the view that in the event 
there is no Austrian treaty, the Western Powers should 
take steps to strengthen the sovereign control of the 
Austrian Government. As preliminary measures, Erhardt 
suggests that the Western Powers first propose to the USSR 
the immediate termination of the occupation; if this is re-
fused, the West should press the USSR to agree to a sub-
stantial reduction of occupation forces, abolition of zonal 
boundaries, renunciation of occupation costs, and elimina-
tion of unnecessary functions of the Allied Council. Erhardt 
adds that after Soviet rejection of all these proposals, which 
would demonstrate Soviet responsibility for the continued 
occupation, the Western Powers could proceed with their own 
measures to strengthen Austria by: (a) a renunciation by 
the UK and France of claims for occupation costs; (b) termina-
tion of the few unilateral controls in the Western zones;-(c) the 
appointment of a civilian High Commissioner, who would 
symbolize the end of the military phase of the occupation; and 
(d) a reduction in occupation forces.

take place regarding the future administration of Dutch 
New Guinea, The Australian Foreign Minister points out 
that Australia has "vital strategic interests in Dutch New 
Guinea" and that the future of that area directly concerns 
Australia. Spender expresses the opinion that the inclusion 
of Dutch New Guinea in the United Slates of Indonesia 
might result in that area's being "undeveloped, undefended

Australia's vital interests in the future administration of 
Dutch New Guinea." Meanwhile, the Chief of the Far East 
Division of the Netherlands Foreign Office has informed 
US Ambassador Chapin at The Hague that the Australian 
note is being studied. The. Netherlands Foreign Office 
representative characterized the Australian note as "extra-
ordinary" and remarked that his government has no intention 
either of answering the Australians until it is "good and 
ready" or of antagonizing the Indonesians by "cooking up" 
some arrangement over Dutch New Guinea with Australia

an impartial plebiscite will be required in the Vale of 
Kashmir in any event, the US is prepared to support any 
settlement acceptable to India and Pakistan, including 
partition. Pointing out that demilitarization of Kashmir 
is essential to any final settlement, the Department ex-
presses the belief that the immediate objective is to seek 
modification of India's intransigence on this point. The 
Department comments that attempts to assess blame in the 
Kashmir case would be unfruitful and adds that the Security

to divert it from the basic task of bringing about a political

1. US views on anti-US restrictions by Satellites --The Depart-

analysis of current US-Satellite relations, the view that 
recent anti-US restrictions in Czechoslovakia are part of 
a general pattern under "central direction" with the intent 
of reducing. Satellite contacts with the West to an absolute 
minimum. The Department suggests that if this interpreta-
tion is correct, a stormy period ahead may be anticipated, 
with added difficulties and obstruction in Czechoslovakia and 
the other Satellite countries and a consequent deterioration 
in US-Satellite relations. The Department declares that in 
devising tactics to counter this attempt to reduce US opera-
tions or possibly to drive the US out of Czechoslovakia, the 
paramount objective must be to maintain contact with the 
Czechoslovak people. The Department points out that this 
consideration may make the US reluctant on occasion to take 
strong action which might seriously impair this contact.

GENERAL 
1. Italy may be willing to negotiate Trieste settlement--
US Ambassador Dunn in Rome has been informed that 
the Italian Government would be willing to enter into 
direct negotiations with Yugoslavia to settle the Trieste 
problem only if assured that the Yugoslav Government 
is ready to begin serious talks on the basis of the tri-
partite declaration of 20 March 1948, which favored 
Italian control over all of the Territory of Trieste. 
Dunn adds that the Italian willingness to consider nego-
tiations arises from the beliefs that: (a) the US is now 
in a position to make informal inquiries regarding 
Yugoslav intentions without jeopardizing Italian ad-
herence to the tripartite declaration; and (b) a spring 
political crisis may occur in Yugoslavia and Italy would 
have no hope of obtaining agreement from a Soviet-
controlled successor to Tito. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that Italy will not 
engage in negotiations with Yugoslavia on Trieste ex-
cept on the basis of the tripartite declaration. CIA 
further believes that although preliminary talks may 
take place between Italy and Yugoslavia, there is little 
likelihood that these talks will lead to formal negotiations 
for settlement in the near future.) 
2. Yugoslav-Satellite relations-- US Ambassador Allen in 
Belgrade has been informed by Yugoslav Foreign Mini-
ster 1Cardelj that although Yugoslavia's diplomatic relations 
with 411 the Satellites have long been at the breaking point/ 
Yugoslavia would hold out "as long as humanly possible.' 
Kardelj pointed out, however, that the endurance point has

The Foreign Minister added that Satellite treatment of 
Yugoslav diplomats in Sofia has been "inhuman beyond 
description" and that the Yugoslav Ambassador in Rumania 
had been recalled but has been unable to obtain an exit visa. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that Yugoslavia will 
probably be forced to withdraw more and more representa-
tives from the Satellites as the Kremlin continues its efforts 
to isolate Yugoslavia from Eastern Europe.) 
3. Yugoslav views on UN seating of Chinese Communists--The 
US Delegation to the UN transmits the opinion of Yugoslay. 
Security Council representative Bebler that the fundamental 
issue involved in seating the Chinese Communists in the UN 
is the independence of China. Bebler feels sure that this 
question must be connected with Mao's long stay in Moscow 
and believes that the longer the Chinese Communists are 
kept out of the UN, the more the West will be helping the 
Soviet effort to isolate China from the West and to destroy 
Chinese independence. 
4. Thailand to delay recognition of Bao Dai--US Embassy Bangkok 
has been informed by Premier Phibul that the Thai Govern-
ment intends to delay recognition of the Bao Dai regime in 
Indochina "for the time being". In support of the Thai deci-
sion, Phibul pointed out that considerations favoring recognition 
are outweighed by Thai desires, in common with those of other 
Asian peoples, to see nations still considered to be under 
"colonial domination" achieve "real freedom and independence". 
The Premier added that the Thai people are not convinced that 
Bao Dai and his government have yet achieved real freedom, 
independence, or a large measure of popular support.

1. French to ask US-UK consultation on Indochina�Accord-
ing to US Ambassador Bruce in Paris, a high official of 
the French Foreign Office has informally advised the US 
Minister in charge of MDAP affairs that France intends 
to approach the US and the UK regarding a tripartite con-
sultation on the entire situation in Indochina. Bruce adds 
that the French believe: (a) the USSR would not have 
recognized Ho Chi Minh (Moscow-trained opponent to the 
French-supported Bao Dai Government in Indochina) unless 
It had intended to do what it could to support him, probably 
through a considerable increase in military assistance via 
the Chinese Communists; (b) in this event the French would 
find it very difficult "to continue to hold the fort in Indo-
china alone"; and (c) the time has come to consider the 
Indochinese situation in its relation to the entire Asiatic 
and world situation in the struggle against Soviet Com-
munism, The French official pointed out that the Govern-
ment was not thinking in terms of some limited military 
aid under the MDAP but wished to discuss the larger poli-
tical, economic, .aiid military aspects of the problem. The 
Ambassador comments that there is no sign of a change in 
French policy since Soviet recognition of Ho, but that the 
French margin in Indochina is not great, and an all-out 
attack by Chinese Communists or major assistance to Ho 
could render the French position in Indochina untenable. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes the French will press 
for speedy US and UK aid to bolster their own and Bao Dai's 
position in Indochina. CIA further believes that if the mili-
tary situation in Indochina worsens considerably in the next 
six months, the French Government would be compelled to 
consider reversing its policies in Indochina, including the 
possibility of withdrawing its military forces.)

2. Effects of possible Yugoslav recognition of Ho Chi Minh--
The Department of State has instructed US Ambassador Allen 
in Belgrade to inform the Yugoslav Government that the US 
is seriously concerned over the possibility that Yugoslavia 
may recognize the Communist-led Ho Chi Minh regime in 
Indochina. The Department points out that such Yugoslav 
action would: (a) strengthen the very forces against which 
Yugoslavia is fighting for its independence; (b) raise in-
surmountable difficulties in the US for providing further 
support for Yugoslav independence; and (c) lead to an in-
crease in French demands on the US for assistance in 
supporting the Bao Dai Government in Indochina. The De-
partment comments that the limited resources of the US 
cannot be dissipated in any such fashion. 
EUROPE 
3. YUGOSLAVIA: Increased aid from West requested--
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Kardelj has presented an urgent 
oral request through US Ambassador Allen in Belgrade for 
increased US economic assistance. In support of his re-
quest, Kardelj pointed out that Yugoslav economic conditions 
are becoming increasingly difficult and that the USSR would 
consequently redouble its efforts to unseat Tito in 1950. 
The Foreign Minister added that if Yugoslavia had to balance 
1950 exports against import needs, the Yugoslav standard of 
living would be depressed and the resulting internal difficulties 
would provide much ammunition for hostile Cominform propa-
ganda. Allen comments that in view of both political and eco-
nomic considerations, it would be highly important to ease 
the present Yugoslav foreign trade difficulties. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that Yugoslavia's pres-
ent economic situation, including present and contemplated 
Western aid, does not justify the alarm expressed by the Yugo-
slav Foreign Minister.)

1. Gruber reviews Austrian treaty situation--US Minister 
Erhardt in Vienna has been informed by Austrian Foreign 
Minister Gruber that a bluntly worded note will be delivered 
to the Soviet Foreign Office, insisting on the resumption of 
the Austro-Soviet financial talks (which have been delaying 
the treaty negotiations in London). Gruber reiterated the 
hope that the Western deputies in London would reach agree-
ment with the Soviet deputy on all issues other than financial 
settlement for the USSR in Austria so that blame for failure 
to conclude a treaty would be placed squarely on the USSR. 
The Austrian Foreign Minister added that strong words from 
the Austrians and the Western Powers might have a "restrain-
ing influence" upon the USSR in its plans for Austria and ex-
pressed the fear that prolonged Soviet occupation might lead 
to communization of eastern Austria and to eventual parti-
tion of the country. Erhardt comments that Gruber would 
like to arouse similar apprehensions among the Western 
Powers as a means of ensuring a determined effort to obtain 
an agreement on a treaty.

1. French views on status of Indochina�US representative 
Gullion in Paris has been informed by Parodi, Secretary-
General of the French Foreign Office, that the French 
Government is unable at this time to issue a statement 
outlining a plan for "evolutionary" development in Indo-
china. Parodi points out that the Government cannot tell 
the French Parliament the agreements just ratified are of 
"merely passing value" and comments that the French 
cannot afford to "kindle unrealistic nationalist appetites" 
in Indochina that would have to be disappointed later. 
Parodi adds, however, that "important extensions" of 
the 8 March 1949 Franco-Vietnam agreement will be made, 
and he cites as an example the recent permission given 
the Vietnamese to establish missions in London and 
Washington. Parodi concludes that the French, "after 
thoughtful consideration," intend to seek US and UK views 
on the very serious problems in Indochina.

2. CHINA: Shanghai air raid damage reported to be severe--
US Consul General Shanghai reports that the. Chinese 
Nationalist air raid of 6 February resulted in severe. 
damage to the city's power facilities. The Consul General 
estimates that the necessity to maintain essential public 
services will result in a heavy cut in the amount of power 
normally supplied to industrial users and transmits the 
opinion of top officials in the Shanghai Power Company that 
a continuation of such damaging air raids during the next 
few days would render Shanghai "virtually untenable:" 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that although the 
6 February raid caused considerable temporary disruption 
in Shanghai, its broader significance in terms of Nationalist 
military capabilities or the effect on Communist China cannot 
be established unless frequent raids of similar weight and 
accuracy are staged.) Document No.

Bruce in Paris, Parodi, Secretary of the French Foreign 
Office, is very "gloomy" about the implications for Indo-

that the Chinese Communists will grant strong

guerrilla leader Ho Chi Minh and that they may even 
launch a direct military assault against Indochina. Parodi 
stated that the French, in either case, could not withstand 
indefinitely and that his Government was planning to make 
Inquiries concerning US intentions if such developments 
should materialize.

munists can make substantial military supplies available 
to Ho Chi Minh but that they are unlikely to send a major 
military force into Indochina.)

I. Views on admission of Chinese Communists to UN--The 
US Delegation to the UN has expressed its belief that in 
view of the basic US policy to preserve the peace through 
collective action in the UN, it is to the interest of the US 
that the USSR resume participation in the UN as early as 
possible. The US Delegation also believes that: (a) the 
trend of developments may inevitably transform what is 
probably intended as a temporary Soviet withdrawal into 
a permanent one; and (b) the issue of Chinese Communist 
representation in the UN is not necessarily "a favorable 
one') on which to risk Soviet withdrawal. The Delegation 
concludes that in the absence of countervailing considerations, 
the US should cease discouraging other UN members either 
from recognizing the Chinese Communists or from voting 
against seating the Chinese Communist representatives in 
the UN. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that early seating of 
the Chinese Communist delegation by the UN would bring 
about the termination of the Soviet walkout.)

Soviet recognition of Ho Chi Minh, with its implicit attack

will of the people and Government to resist and contain

in France, increase popular support for a more cohesive 
and determined policy toward the USSR. Pointing out that

ANNEX 
1 February 1950 
IMPLICATIONS OF SOVIET RECOGNITION OF THE 
HO REGIME IN INDOCHINA 
Soviet recognition of Ho Chi Minh's "Democratic 
Republic of Vietnam" early this week, following similar 
action by the Chinese Communists, has jeopardized the al-
ready uneasy position of the French--and the French-
sponsored Bao Dai regime--in Indochina. The implicit 
threat in the Communist diplomatic maneuvers is strength-
ened by the presence of Chinese Communist forces on the 
Indochina frontier and their ability to make substantial mili-
tary supplies available to the pro-Communist Ho regime. 
This combination of political and military pressure may, by 
itself, force the French to withdraw from Indochina within 
a year. In the unlikely event that the Chinese Communist 
Government should send a major military force into Indochina 
for action against the French, French withdrawal could be ex-
pected within six months. 
If France is driven from Indochina, the resulting 
emergence of an indigenous Communist-dominated regime 
in Vietnam, together with pressures exerted by Peiping and 
Moscow, would probably bring about the orientation of adjacent 
Thailand and Burma toward the Communist orbit. Under these 
circumstances, other Asian states�Malaya and Indonesia, par-
ticularly�would become highly vulnerable to the extension 
of Communist influence. 
Meanwhile, by recognizing the Ho regime, the USSR 
has revealed its determination to force 'France completely 
out of Indochina and to install a Communist government. 
Alone, France is incapable of preventing such a development. 
Although Western nations are committed to support of the

French on the diplomatic level--the US and the UK, for ex-
ample, plan shortly to extend recognition to the French-
sponsored Bao Dai regime--such actions are unlikely to 
halt the present trend in Indochina. Prospects for obtaining 
additional diplomatic support for the French or Bao Dai are 
poor in view of the unwillingness, of most Asian nations to 
assist that. they regard a-s a_ "colonialist" -puppet regime. , 
In fact, many of these nations can interpret Soviet and Chinese 
recognition of Ho as concrete action in support of Asian na-
tionalism. 
In resisting the Communist advance, France can 
now turn for assistance only to the US, which, in the face of 
recent actions by the USSR and China in seizing the initiative 
in Southeast Asia, is now confronted with the general alter-
natives of either increasing its support-of Bao Dai or with-
drawing such support as has already been afforded. Adoption 
of the-first alternative sets up Bao Dai as the principal anti-
Communist instrument in Indochina, despite the inherent 
weakness of his position. Asian nations, moreover, would 
tend to interpret such US action as support of continued 
� Western colonialism. The second alternative, which would 
result in the inevitable downfall of Bao Dai, would open the 
way for intensified Communist action in Southeast Asia and 
would render increasingly difficult the containment of Soviet 
influence throughout the Far East.

they do not wish to prejudice the treaty negotiations,

GENERAL 
1. Views on the Soviet UN walkout--US Embassy Belgrade 
transmits the opinion of the Yugoslav Government that 
the Soviet walkout from the UN is part of a scheme to 
isolate Communist China from contacts with the outside 
world. According to the Embassy, the Yugoslav Govern-
ment believes that the USSR does not "really want": 
(a) the Chinese Communists to be seated in the UN; or 
(b) the US to recognize the Chinese Communist Govern-
ment. Meanwhile, the US delegation at the UN reports the 
fears of Secretary General Lie that unless the contro9rsy 
over the seating of the Chinese Communist delegation is 
resolved within four to six weeks, the USSR may "stay 
out of the UN for good, keep the Chinese Communists out 
and proceed to set up a rival organization comprehending 
perhaps 7 to 8 hundred million people." 
(CIA Comment: CIA concurs with the Yugoslav 
opinion that the USSR is seeking to discourage US recogni-
tion of Communist China. CIA further believes that: 
(a) the Kremlin may wish to delay the seating of the 
Chinese Communists in the UN until satisfactory poli-
tical and economic arrangements with Mao have been 
concluded; and (b) the USSR is unlikely to withdraw from 
the UN permanently.)

GENERAL 
1. Views on Soviet strategy--US Embassy Moscow, comment- 3IS 
ing on British and French views that the USSR is easing 
tension in Western Europe and shifting its attention to the 
Far East, expresses the opinion that during 1950 Commu-
nist moves in the Far East will be more dramatic than those 
in Europe, but considers it erroneous to assume that Soviet 
"attention" to the Far East implies "material Soviet 
neglect of Western Europe." 
(CIA Comment: CIA agrees that the USSR has 
neither abandoned its objectives in Europe nor will relax 
its efforts to achieve them.) 
2. Austrian views on Treaty prospects--Austrian Foreign 
Minister Gruber has informed US representative Reber in 
London of his conviction that the USSR has no intention of 
concluding an Austrian treaty at present. Gruber fears that 
the USSR has some definite drive in mind for 1950, possibly 
involving increased sabotage tactics by local Communists, 
and is thus anxious to counteract any Soviet allegations con-
cerning Western responsibility for the deadlock. Gruber 
therefore recommends that when treaty negotiations are 
resumed on 15 February the Western Powers make every 
effort to dispose of the unagreed articles, thereby depriving 
the USSR of any pretext other than the Vienna financial nego-
tiations for stalling on the treaty. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that the USSR will not 
conclude a treaty on terms satisfactory to the West. CIA 
further believes that instead of agreeing to a treaty the 
USSR will: (a) attempt to force the Austrian Government to 
negotiate a bilateral agreement; and (b) begin to utilize its 
occupation power to undermine the authority of the Austrian 
Government in the Soviet Zone.)

Tito expressed the view that the USSR would do every-
thing short of war to cause Yugoslavia to "crumble poli-
tically and economically." Tito appeared to regard with 
some seriousness the possibility that unrest might develop 
in Yugoslavia as a result of: (a) economic hardships 
caused by Soviet economic pressure; and (b) the infiltra-
tion of Soviet agitators. Tito made no specific -requests 
for US assistance, but considered it essential that close 
economic relations be developed with the US.

Views on possible Trieste settlement--Acting US Political 
Advisor Judd in Trieste transmits the view of General Airey, 
Commander of the British-US Zone, that the Allied Military 
Government (AMG) in Trieste should be terminated before 
the expected end of the European recovery program in 1952. 
According to Judd, General Airey believes that AMWs pro-
blems are sure to increase and that Allied withdrawal now 
is likely to be less awkward than at a later date. Airey also 
expressed the opiniOn that although British and US pressure 
may be necessary, present circumstances are favorable for 
direct Italo-Yugoslav negotiations on the Trieste problem. 
Airey believes that the Allies should retreat as little as 
possible from their present stand that the entire Trieste 
territory be returned to Italy and that negotiations should 
be prolonged at least until Atlantic Pact arrangements near 
completion. Judd comments that he personally favors, as 
a means of obtaining some indication of Tito's intentions, a 
preliminary and informal approach to the Yugoslays with 
the clear statement that "the US would be unable to support 
Yugoslav territorial and other claims."

1. Early_Trieste settlement urged-- US Embassy Belgrade 
reiterates its firm belief that an early settlement of the 
Trieste problem by direct negotiations between Italy and 
Yugoslavia would be very much to US advantage. The 
Embassy strongly endorses the idea of a joint US-UK 
demarche to Italyand Yugoslavia and points out that the 
UK Foreign Office also believes an early settlement is 
desirable. In addition, the Embassy expresses the 
opinion that the Yugoslays are sincerely desirous of an 
early settlement of the Trieste issue because Soviet 
acceptance of the US-UK-French declaration in 1948 
favoring the return of all of the Trieste Territory to. Italy 
would place the Yugoslav Government in an "obviously 
critical" position. The Embassy comments that there is 
no prospect of an Italian compromise unless US influence 
is exerted to alter the "negative attitude" of the Italians. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that the reluctance 
of the Italian Government to engage in direct negotiations 
with Yugoslavia regarding Trieste probably reflects con-
cern over the internal political repercussions which 
� 
would result from any major reduction in Italian claims. 
CIA further believes that the gradual improvement of 
over-all relations between Italy and Yugoslavia, now in 
progress, will eventually facilitate an Italian-Yugoslav 
settlement of the Trieste issue.) 
2. Views on UN seating of Chinese Communists--The US 
Delegation to the UN expresses the opinion that it would 
be in the interest of the US to accept the UN seating of 
Communist China's representatives in due course "as 
gracefully as possible and without unnecessary delay." 
The Delegation suggests that this policy be followed 
irrespective of the timing of US recognition of the Chinese 
Communist Government,

1. Schuman's views on Saar agreements--US Ambassador 
Bruce in Paris has been informed by French Foreign 
Minister Schuman that he has no intention of entering 
into any agreement with the Saar that does not specifi-
cally provide that the agreement is "in every respect" 
subject to an eventual peace treaty. Schuman-added that 
he felt such a provision would largely still the present 
excitement over the issue. Although Schuman would not 
promise that French leases on Saar coal mines would not 
extend beyond the date of a peace treaty, he pointed out 
that the proposed 50-year period for the leases was 
simply a suggestion of technical experts. The French 
Foreign Minister was not willing to postpone the opening 
of the Franco-Saar conference (scheduled for 7 February), 
but he indicated that the negotiations will require a long 
time and could be deliberately lengthened. (German 
Chancellor Adenauer has indicated his strong opposition 
to any hasty decisions regarding the Saar.) Schuman 
emphatically asserted that the Saar difficulties would not 
alter the determination of the French Government to have 
West Germany become an associate member of the Coun-
cil of Europe. 
2. Interpretation of "new" Soviet attitude--US Ambassador 
Kirk in Moscow interprets Vishinsky's reply to Secretary 
Acheson's recent statement concerning Soviet imperialism 
in China as one more example of the "rashness" being 
displayed by Soviet officials as they become convinced that 
the Soviet position is improving and the Western position 
deteriorating. As further evidence of Soviet "rashness," 
Kirk points to recent aggressive statements of top Soviet 
officials and to the Communist treatment of Western

ern Commandants in Berlin agree that the recent Soviet 
interference in Western traffic to Berlin reflects a deliberate 
Soviet plan to sabotage the economic: rehabilitation of Berlin, 
undermine the confidence of Berliners and WestGermans,

2. 15 February proposed for resuming Austrian treaty talks--
US representative Reber in London reports that the Western 
Deputies to the Austrian treaty talks have agreed upon 
15 February as the date of the next Deputies meeting in 
order to keep the London talks alive, while giving the USSR 
an opportunity to conclude its financial negotiations with the 
Austrians in Vienna. (Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister 
Gromyko has insisted that the Vienna talks must be com-
pleted before the Deputies in London can discuss as a group 
the outstanding issues of the Austrian treaty.) The Depart-
ment of State has informed Reber that the completion of the

occupation forces remains the major US objective in Austria 
and that if a treaty cannot be concluded at this time, the 
Department will consider alternative courses of action to 
achieve Western aims in Austria.

learned from the Austrian Foreign Office that during a

authorized spokesman for Chen and that further conversa-

I. Possible shift in Soviet tactics in Austria--In discussing 
the new Soviet attitude in Austria, US Legation Vienna 
expresses the opinion that increasingly "vigorous" Soviet 
tactics in the Allied Commission and the harsher Soviet 
attitude toward the Austrian population may be explained 
as attempts to intimidate the Austrian Government and 
people in order to minimize Austrian objections to Soviet 
stalling on the Austrian treaty negotiations. The Legation, 
however, does not exclude the possibility of a basic change 
in Soviet strategy, perhaps including a decision to split 
Austria along the German pattern. The Legation points 
out that the Kremlin may now ,consider that: (a) an early 
treaty and the subsequent withdrawal of Soviet troops 
would no longer enable the USSR to gain dominance over 
all of Austria; (b) the liquidation of Tito requires the 
presence of Soviet troops in Austria; and (c) the USSR 
must now concentrate on the further integration of the 
present Soviet sphere, including eastern Austria. The 
Legation recommends that regardless of the reasons behind 
Soviet 'stalling. on the Austrian treaty, the US put Soviet 
intentions squarely to the test and use all available means 
to obtain Soviet withdrawal from Austria. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that the present 
aggressive attitude of Soviet officials in Austria reflects 
the continuing Soviet 'desire to delay conclusion of an 
Austrian treaty rather than a Soviet decision to attempt 
to split Austria in the near future.)

US Ambassador Bruce in Paris expresses the opinion that 
anything that can be done to speed decisions on French re-

would be "most helpful' to US security interests. Bruce 
points out that French Defense Minister Pleven, in planning 
for recruitment and disposition of French land forces, is 
faced with decisions affected by the delivery dates on MDAP 
aid. According to Bruce, Pleven considers that it would be 
unwise to give the Communists an opportunity to build up 
their propaganda on Western disunity by any protracted 
delay in MDAP deliveries. 
(CIA Comment: CIA agrees that any delay in MDAP 
shipments to France is likely to be effectively exploited by 
the French Communist Party as evidence of Western dis-
unity.)

1. US stand on Saar issue�The Department of State has ad-
vised US Embassy Paris that Secretary Acheson's recent 
statement on the Saar means unequivocally that the US 
supports French claims for political detachment of the 
Saar from Germagy and financial-economic integration of 
the area with France. In instructing the 'Embassy to dis-
cuss the Saar with the French Foreign Office, the Depart-
ment observes, however, that arrangements made prior to 
the peace treaty are provisional and that any proposal look-
ing toward long-term regulation of economic and political 
life of the Saar, such as the current French proposal to 
lease mines from the Saar Government on a 50-year basis, 
is subject to US-UK consultation. The Department notes 
the "pressing urgency" of drawing Germany closer into 
the Western European community and expresses the view 
that the French would be wise not to introduce new propo-
sals which at the present time "can only be expected to 
excite nationalistic feelings in Germany and thus retard 
improvement of Franco-German relations."

Indonesia and other states during the absence of the USSR 
from the UN, expresses the view that the US should not 
support any membership applications at this time. The

to adopt substantive resolutions in the absence of a per-
manent member but points (a) to the likelihood that the 
USSR would never recognize the new members as UN 
members and (b) to the "conceivable" possibility that

1. Adenauer disturbed by French Saar policy--US High 
Commissioner McCloy in Frankfurt has been informed by 
German Chancellor Adenauer .that "there is no possibility" 
he will be able to bring the Federal Republic into the Coun-
cil of Europe if the French persist in their present course 
in the Saar. Adenauer expressed the view that the timing 
of the French action is the most important element in the 
situation, and asked that the US and the UK bring pressure 
to bear on the French to gain more time for a settlement, 
possibly through direct French-German-Saar conversations. 
McCloy agrees with Aden.auer's opinion that French timing 
on the Saar projects is "most unfortunate" and expresses 
the "firm conviction" that the announced French intentions 
will probably prevent German entry into the Council of 
Europe. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that early French 
action to conclude long-term leases on the Saar mines is 
likely to jeopardize the chances for German entrance into 
the Council of Europe. CIA further believes that Adenauer's 
attitude on the Saar issue is governed primarily by his 
anxiety to avoid prejudicing the final settlement of German 
boundaries and partly by his desire to counter German 
critics of his "pro-French" policy.)

sponse. In reply to the Western Ambassadors' statement

London could discuss other unagreed articles of the treaty. 
Kirk points out that Gromyko was willing to study the West-

According to US High Commissioner McCloy in Frankfurt, 
French Foreign Minister Schuman is determined to acquire 
50-year leases for France on Saar coal mines, even though 
German Chancellor Adenauer has expressed the fear that 
such French action might endanger Franco-German rapproche-
ment. McCloy adds that Schuman, while emphasizing that any 
arrangements made now will be subject to review in the peace 
treaty, apparently also intends to effect some "administrative 
changes" in the Saar, including converting the Office of the 
French Commissioner to a Legation. McCloy believes that 
the 50-year leases would prejudice final disposition of the 
Saar and agrees with Chancellor Adenauer that the French 
policy will make Franco-German rapprochement more diffi-
cult 
(CIA Comment: CIA agrees that the French policy 
on the Saar will make the achievement of a Franco-German 
rapprochement more difficult, and believes that the French 
Government will probably maintain its present firm stand 
regarding the Saar.)

major issues are sure to wreck his efforts; the obviously 
tired and discouraged Nationalist Governor expects de-
cisively unfavorable developments in the near future, with 
"complete failure" probably becoming apparent before the 
end of February 1950. The Charge expresses the conviction 
that Wu's appeal was not only on instructions from above 
but also represented Wu's own last hope to achieve some-

to join with the French and British Ambassadors in making 
an approach as soon as possible to Soviet Foreign Minister 
Vishinsky on the question of the Austrian treaty, The Depart-
ment indicates that the approach should consist of an oral

a flat Soviet refusal to continue negotiations or assurances 
that the Austrian treaty may be concluded on the basis of 
existing agreements withoUt, the creation of further obstacles

assets were accepted; (b) avoid detailed discussion of specific. 
articles of the treaty; and (c) avoid giving the impression that

which the UN might well endeavor to solve.

countries to recognize Bao Dal, Following discussion 
during the Colombo Conference on the problem of recog-

extend "de facto" recognition to Bao Dai until the French

1. US agrees to suggested protest to Moscow �The Depart-
ment of State has informed US Representative Reber in 
London of its concurrence in the plan for a tripartite oral 
protest in Moscow in the event that "no conclusive result" 
is reached during the 13 January meeting on the Austrian 
treaty. In order to avoid the appearance that the Western 
powers are breaking off negotiations in London, the Depart-
ment recommends that a specific date be fixed during the 
13 January meeting for another meeting of the representa-
�-dyes during the following week. The Department adds that 
no hint should be given the Soviet deputy that a tripartite 
protest is contemplated, and suggests that the protest bed,

GENERAL 
1. Soviet attitude disturbs Austrian leaders--According to 
US Legation Vienna, Austrian Foreign Minister Gruber 
has indicated that he has scant hope for early agreement 
on the Austrian treaty primarily because of the increas-
ingly unfriendly interviews he and the Austrian Premier 
� have had with Soviet Deputy High Commissioner Zheltov. 
In support of his fears of renewed Soviet pressure on 
the Austrian people, Gruber points to: (a) the revival of 
lawlessness in the Soviet Zone; (b) Soviet propaganda 
about neo-Nazism and war criminals; and (c) Soviet un-
friendliness to Austrian officials. Gruber expresses the 
hope that the London treaty negotiations will not completely 
bog down and says that the Austrian Government will avoid 
any display of impatience that would aid Soviet moves to 
frighten the Austrian people. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that the present 
Soviet actions in Austria reflect the Kremlids desire to 
delay conclusion of an Austrian treaty.)

GENERAL 
1. Proposed Western approach to Moscow on Austrian treaty... 
USRepresentative Reber now attending the Austrian treaty 
talks in London reports that, because the 9 January meeting 
indicated the USSR has no present intention of concluding 
the treaty negotiations, the Western representatives have 
agreed that a joint western approach should be made to 
Moscow. The US, UK and French representatives feel that 
the three Western ambassadors in Moscow should make 
a joint representation to the Soviet Foreign Office as soon 
as possible after the 13 January meeting when a continuation 
of the negative Soviet attitude is expected. Reber recom-
mends that the joint representation: (a) recall the Kremlin's 
past assurances of a desire to conclude a treaty; (b) point 
out that, despite progress, new obstacles are continually 
being created; and (c) request that the Soviet Government 
state, its attitude toward the Austrian treaty and give proof 
of its intention to proceed with negotiations. The Western 
representatives 
representatives are also in favor of having the joint approach 
to Moscow accompanied by adequate publicity to demonstrate 
that the USSR is blocking the current negotiations for an 
Austrian treaty. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that the USSR will 
continue its present stalling tactics on the Austrian treaty 
negotiations regardless of a tri-partite approach to Moscow.)

1. Possibilities for discussing Kashmir issue at Colombo--
In connection with the proposal that the Kashmir problem 
be discussed at the Colombo conference of British Common-
wealth countries, the UK High Commissioner in New Delhi 
expresses the opinion that India would "resent any suggestion 
that the Kashmir question should be raised in any formal. 
way" at the Commonwealth meeting., The UK High Com-
missioner adds that the most to be hoped for is "some 
progress on the Ministerial level with Pandit Nehru in an 
entirely informal and friendly" discussion.

L US-UK relations reviewed�US Embassy London, in 
discussing causes of strains and stresses on US-UK 
relations, expresses the view that despite the growing 
number of differences between the US and UK there is 
no reason to believe that these differences are result-
ing from any change in the basic British policy, designed 
to assure harmonious and cooperative working relations 
with the US. The Embassy comments that although there 
have been several periods of tension between the US and 
UK since World War II, the present period is potentially 
the most serious because US-UK differences are now 
more numerous, complex and intangible and some are 
likely to remain for a considerable time. In reviewing 
the factors considered to be contributing to the current 
US-UK tension, the Embassy lists: (a) the continuing 
economic difficulties in the UK; (b) British annoyance 
over the increase in general US pressure and criticism; 
(c) the uncertainties caused by the pending general elec-
tion in the UK; (d) a constant state of British bewilder-
ment over the US political system; and (e) the degree of 
fatigue in top governmental circles in London and irrita-
tions caused by the numerous US official and private 
visitors to the UK.

I. US urges UK and Canadian pressure for Kashmir settlement-- Sis 
Secretary 'of State Acheson has informed the Canadian and C Nis 
British Foreign Ministers of his concern over a possible stale-
mate in India-Pakistan negotiations on the Kashmir issue, and 
has urged them to raise the problem with the two Dominions 
11111 
during the conference of Commonwealth Foreign Ministers 
beginning on 9 January in Ceylon. The Secretary urged the 
two Foreign Ministers to use their influence to impress India, 
which has been less cooperative than Pakistan, with the 
necessity of continuing negotiations "on a real give and take 
basis" until a satisfactory solution is reached. The Secretary 
also informed the British and Canadians that he planned to 
"emphasize this point" on 9 January with the Indian and 
Pakistani Ambassadors to the US.

2. CHINA: Nationalist mines in Yangtze estuary�The US 
Naval Attache in Shanghai reports that British naval authori-
ties in Formosa and Hong Kong assume that the Chinese 
Nationalist Navy has laid approximately twenty mines of 
Chinese manufacture in the Yangtze estuary. The Attache 
agrees that mines have been laid but seriously doubts whether 
these initial mines will be efficient either in design or place-
ment or will remain in position against the strong currents.

1. Possible Western action on Austrian treaty negotiations--
According to US Representative Reber now in Paris, French 
representatives agree that if the USSR continues to stall 
on the Austrian treaty negotiations, the three Western 
Powers may be forced to do something "spectacular" to 
demonstrate that only the Soviet attitude blocks progress 
on the treaty. In discussing with Reber the possibility of 
a tripartite approach to Moscow, the French are inclined 
to agree, that if. the Soviet Deputy continues his delaying 
tactics atthe new meetings beginning 9 January, such a 
joint Western approach should be made within a few days 
after the talks are resumed.

1. INDOCHINA: US plans for recognizing Bao Dai--The 
Department of State has informed US Embassy London 
that the US is planning to extend some form of re-
cognition to the Bao Dai Government of Vietnam, as 
an associated state in the French Union, provided the 
French National Assembly adheres to the estimated 
timetable for ratifying the agreement transferring 
limited powers to Bao Dai. The Department expresses 
the hope that recognition can be synchronized with a 
"spontaneous" French pi4blic statemeht of liberal in-
tentions and concrete plans for further evolution of 
political independence in Vietnam. The Department also 
hopes that some South Asian nations may be persuaded 
to extend some form of recognition to the Bao Dai 
Government before the US acts. Meanwhile, US Em-
bassy Paris estimates that the "most optimistic" date 
for the start of French Assembly debate on the agree-
ments for relinquishing certain Freneh powers in Indo-
china is now 17 January 1950. (French Foreign Minister 
Schuman orginally estimated that debate would begin 
by 12 January.)

1. Implications of Mao's prolonged stay in Moscow--
Commenting on the recent statement by Chinese 
Communist leader Mao Tse-tung that he expected 
to remain in the USSR for "several weeks, US, 
Embassy Moscow considers it odd that Mao would 
absent himself from China for an extended period 
at this critical time. The Embassy cites previous 
reports of the "nationalistic" flavor of Mao's leader-
ship and suggests that: (a) Mao's return to Peiping 
is being delayed by failure to reach agreement in 
negotiations with the USSR; and (b) strongly pro-
Kremlin elements in the Chinese Communist Party may 
be expected to take advantage of Mao's absence to 
strengthen their position at the expense of the "national-
istic" faction in the Party. 
(CIA Comment: CIA believes that Mao's return to 
China may be delayed by an inability to reach Agrebment 
on certain provisions of a revised Sino-Soviet treaty. 
CIA has no evidence, however, that Mao is out of favor 
with the Kremlin or that an anti-Mao coup is being 
planned in China. )

Views on Chinese Communist recognition--US Ambassador 
Kirk in Moscow expresses the view that US long range 
interests would best be served by early recognition. of the 
Chinese Communist regime. Kirk points out that the US 
cannot exploit the Chinese situation without representatives 
actually in the country and that the USSR prefers that the 
US delay recognition until a dependable local Communist 
regime and an efficient secret police system have been 
established. Kirk adds that it would be 1.ackly dangerous 
for the western world to s issue of recognition 
and considers c d action by the US and UK to be 
highl le. In recommending early recognition of 
� ommunist regime, however, Kirk emphasizes that 
the question of recognition be clearly separated from that 
of trade policy and that no steps be taken to lessen the 
burden of the USSR in meeting China's desperate need for 
outside assistance. Meanwhile, Kirk opposes any US action 
to strengthen the Nationalist regime on Taiwan on the 
grounds that such action would preclude the establishment 
of relations with the Peiping regime and would cause a 
strong adverse reaction in Southeast Asia. 
2. UK to grant de facto recognition to Vietnam--According 
to US Embassy London, the British Foreign Office has in-
formed the French that the UK has decided to accord de 
facto recognition to the Bao Dai regime in Indochina after 
the Colombo Conference and that Bevin will appeal to the 
Commonwealth Foreign Ministers there to follow the UK's 
example. The Foreign Office explained that UK recognition 
before the Conference might cause those Commonwealth 
governments inclined to withhold recognition to "harden 
their attitude."

3. British position on Somaliland�The UK Foreign Office 
has informed US Embassy London that if the UN and 
Italy have not completed a trusteeship agreement for 
Somaliland by the end of March, the UK will be prepared 
to reconsider the timing of the formal transfer of ad-

SPAIN: Implications of denial of Argentine wheat--The 
Spanish Minister of Industry and Commerce has informed 
US Representative Culbertson in Madrid that Argentina 
has cancelled its wheat agreements with Spain and that. 
Spain must now turn elsewhere for substantial imports of 
wheat. Culbertson expresses the opinion that although the 
Minister overestimates Spain's import requirements, 
Spain would be forced, unless it received US aid; to draw 
further on its meager gold reserves, with serious economic 
consequences. Culbertson recommends that the US make 
a determined effort to enable Spain to solve its difficulties 
without using its gold reserves. In the absence of such an 
effort, Culbertson believes that by accusing the US of re-
fusing to aid the Spanish people, the Franco regime would 
strengthen its internal position and weaken US influence. 
(CIA Comment: CIA agrees that the Spanish Minister 
overestimates Spain's wheat needs, but doubts that Franco's 
internal position would be strengthened in the event of serious 
economic difficulties.)
