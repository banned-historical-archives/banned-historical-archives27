 LET THE MOTHERLAND'S SEEDLINGS GROW EVEN MORE STURDILY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82 pp 2-4
 [Editorial]
 [Text]  Our party has always shown loving care for children and has placed
 high hopes in them.  Comrade Mao Zedong long ago encouraged children to
 "study well and make progress every day" and expressed the hope that
 "children will close their ranks and study to be new masters of new China."
 Comrade Deng Xiaoping also "hopes that children throughout the country will
 resolve to be people with ideals, morality, knowledge and physical strength
 and will resolve to make contributions to the people, the motherland and
 humanity."  In February last year, the CCP Central Committee Secretariat
 gave more instructions on work with children; it called for mobilizing
 forces of the whole party and the whole society to take an active interest
 in the healthy growth of children and to regard successfully nurturing and
 educating children as their strategic task, and it adopted many important
 measures for carrying out this task.  Party organizations at all levels have
 responded to the call of the central authorities and conscientiously
 strengthened leadership over work with children.  As a result, a new phase
 has emerged in the work of educating children.  Nurtured. painstakingly by
 and under the loving care of the party, and with the consideration and
 protection shown and given by the whole society, our country's children
 are like seedlings which have broken through the soil and are bathed in the
 sunlight and bounty of the socialist system.  They are growing up strong and
 healthy.  The Chinese children's spirit of vigorously making progress shows
 that they are full of promise.
 It will be a protracted struggle for building our country into a powerful
 socialist country with a high degree of material civilization, a high degree
 of spiritual civilization and a high degree of democracy, and for holding
 high the great banner of communism, to persevere in our striving for a final
 victory.  It will be necessary to carry on this struggle generation after
 generation over a long period of time.  Children who are now between 7 and
 14 years old will become a powerful labor army within 20 years.  They will
 become the main strength of the construction and defense forces for realizing
 the cause of socialist modernization, and will achieve the magnificent goals
 of the four modernizations.   To accomplish this historical mission, we must
 train our children to become people with the highest level of political

 consciousness, selfless and perfectly impartial and absolutely devoted to
 the cause of communism; we  must train them to become people who are firm
 and indomitable, imbued with the spirit of revolutionary optimism; train
 them to become people with courage to think and speak out, highly creative
 in a revolutionary way and daring to struggle against any backward elements
 that hinder the advance of our society; and train them to become masters of
 the latest scientific and technical knowledge, capable of effectively con-
 quering nature and thus benefiting the people.  In short, our country's
 children should be trained to become new socialist men.
 Bringing up such a new generation is certainly no easy job; it requires
 great effort by the whole party.  In particular, during the building of
 our socialist spiritual civilization, we should be farsighted and think of
 and view things strategically, judging from the level of the development of
 our scientific, educational and cultural-undertakings and judging from the
 direction in and the level of the development of people's political and
 ideological characters such as communist ideals, values and morality, we
 can see that the education and training of children are a means of laying
 foundations.  Leading comrades of the central authorities have repeatedly
 noted:  The development of communist traits of morality such as lofty ideals,
 the spirit of sacrificing one's own interests for the sake of others and
 civilized manners and habits should be started during childhood.  Compara-
 tively speaking, firmly grasping the education and training of children and
 enabling people to foster communist values from childhood have far greater
 significance.  Comrade Deng Yingchao explained this point in her speech at
 the capital's report meeting in celebration of 1 June, International
 Children's Day.  She said:  "Promotion of work with children is the starting
 .point for molding the people, a process which will take 100 years.  Promo-
 tion of work with children is also the starting point for building material
 civilization and socialist spiritual civilization and for fostering a gen-
 eration of people of a new type.                      This is a most important step we take
 during the great course of building socialism and fighting for'the cause of
 communism."  This is because by molding our children now in accordance with
 communist ideology and morality, we can change the mental outlook of a new
 generation of people who will become adults in less than 20 years.  Children
 who are now 5 or 6 years old have no memories of the 10 years of civil
 strife and even children now 13 to 14 years old are relatively less tainted.
 Our principal task concerning these children is "maintaining health" and not
 "curing illness."  Moreover, because of their youth their thinking and
 character are more malleable.  They are readily receptive to teachings on
 the differences between truth and deception, between good and evil, between
 beautiful and ugly, and between correct deeds and wrong deeds.  It is also
 easy for them to cultivate habits.  Moreover, children are very imitative
 and handle affairs conscientiously.  The education a person receives in his
 childhood will directly affect his lifelong development.  Their good think-
 ing and behavior will also have a certain influence in various social
 situations.
 In educating our children in communist ideology and morality, we should
 attach importance to teaching them the five virtues of love.  According to
 Article 22 of the Draft of the Revised Constitution, "The state promotes

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100310001-3
 the virtues of love for the motherland, the people, labor, science and
 socialism."  Thus the actual contents of and demand for teaching the five
 virtues of love.  Education in the five virtues of love is education in
 patriotism, collectivism and communism.-  To foster and develop these
 socialist virtues throughout the society, we should start with fostering
 and developing them among children, because children happen to be the
 future masters, pillars and backbone forces of our country and our whole
 society.
 During the recent "five stresses and four beautifuls" and "all-people
 civility and courtesy month" campaigns, vast numbers of children responded
 to the call of the party and enthusiastically participated in activities
 within their power under the correct guidance and leadership of teachers
 and of instructors from the Young Pioneers.  As a result., the children
 have been educated and tempered.  However, there is a noteworthy problem:
 While asking children to pay attention to civilization, order and dis-
 cipline, some comrades have established quite a few restrictions and
 restraints, thus rigidly keeping children within bounds.  We can illustrate
 this problem with the following case:  A child has just visited Chairman
 Mao's former residence at Zhongnanhai.  The child's mother asked what her
 child saw there.  The child grumbled that he only saw the back of the head
 .of his schoolmate standing in front of him.  Why?  Prior to the visit, the
 children were told to observe this discipline:  "You must follow the one
 in front of you; you must not whisper to each other; and you must not
 glance right or left."  How could they issue these trivial orders to
 restrict and restrain the children's innocence and liveliness, which are
 children's natural characteristics!
 It is very important to teach our children to understand manners and
 observe discipline and social order.  To suit the needs of this kind of
 teaching, there should also be a requirement of a fair and reasonable moral
 standard.  However, we must not neglect to foster the child's indomitable
 will, his lively, bright and cheerful disposition, and courageous and fear-
 less spirit.   This-kind of fostering is also an important aspect of
 spiritual civilization.  If we persist in stressing obedience and do not
 allow our children to express differing views, we will probably turn them
 into people who unthinkingly become blind followers when problems arise.
 We should guide our children to have the courage to dissuade others from
 giving rise to unhealthy tendencies, uttering wrong words and taking
 erroneous actions, and to struggle against such tendencies, words and
 actions.  We must not turn them into yes-men and cowards; who are afraid of
 getting into trouble.  We should teach our children to be ready to take up
 the cudgels for a just cause and to be enthusiastic in helping companions
 in dire peril, and also in helping the old, weak, sick and disabled.  We
 must not turn them into selfish people who hang back in the face of danger.
 We should also make it possible for our children to be imbued with vitality
 and strong faith in life and to be lively, cheerful, optimistic and highly
 creative.  We must not turn them into reticent young people who dare not
 speak and laugh in public and lack vigor and drive.  Only if we pay atten-
 tion to all these aspects can our children meet the party's expectations of
 healthily growing up to be successors in an all-round way.

 It is our party's fine tradition to care for the healthy growth of children
 and it is the Chinese people's communist virtue to have deep love for a new
 generation.  Those who care for the motherland's future and destiny will
 definitely care about the children's development.  It is the whole party's
 undertaking to nurture and educate children.  Our party has always cared
 for nurturing and educating children.  All party organizations must con-
 tinue to broaden their understanding of the strategic significance of
 training successors for the cause of communism, and implement the guiding
 principle of the party central authorities for mobilizing forces of the
 whole party and the whole society to strengthen the education and training
 of children.  Schools, families and society must truly strive to coordinate
 their work, make joint efforts and fulfill their respective duties.  It is
 imperative to overcome the views that issues concerning children are not
 issues that concern the general situation.  It is also imperative to over-
 come the theory of natural growth which has these arguments:  "Without
 grasping agriculture, there will be no grain; without grasping industry,
 there will be no steel; without discipline, children will still grow up"
 and "Although the flowers have been cultivated purposefully, they do not
 bloom; although some willows have been planted unintentionally, they now
 shade the lanes."  We can surely promote educational undertakings for
 children as long as party organizations at all levels make reasons, gains
 and losses clear to all party members and take the lead in promoting educa-
 tional undertakings for children.
 Childhood is a period for growing up physically and also for absorbing
 knowledge.  Children must study cultural knowledge but they also want
 entertainment, games and places to exercise.  This means that our party
 and the whole society must try in every possible way to create conditions
 for promoting children's education and activities.  We must make primary
 education universal and enable all children of school age to receive pri-
 mary school education.  We must also try in every possible way to strengthen
 preschool education and do well in running childcare centers and nursery
 schools.  We should also build more clubs for children's after-school
 activities such as the children's palaces.  We should hold small-scale and
 varied summer camps for children and effectively organize their holiday
 time.  As the central authorities have decided to turn an official garden
 into a national center for children's activities, big and medium-sized
 cities throughout the country should also set aside their best houses and
 buildings for children's activities.  Vast numbers of children have not had
 some children's palaces open to them for a long time.  Such a situation must
 be changed.
 With the restructuring of organs and with the reshuffling of leading groups,
 a large number of veteran cadres will either retire or leave jobs to
 recuperate.  All veteran cadres have gained revolutionary experience.  They
 are an important force for educating the children in the revolutionary
 tradition.   We should organize retired veteran cadres to participate in the
 social activities of educating children.  Old people have a deeper love for
 children.    To them, seeing innocent and guileless children is just like
 seeing fresh blooming flowers; allowing them to participate in the activ-
 ities of educating children can also fill their later years with great joy.

 At present, cases of infringing upon children's rights and interests and
 cases of trampling on children have been occurring repeatedly.  Some
 places for children's activities have been willfully invaded and occupied;
 due to serious pollution of the environment that is in close vicinity to
 some schools, the physical and mental health of children there are affected;
 some schools still have corporal punishment; and some children still face
 discrimination, maltreatment, physical punishment and abuse.  In particu-
 lar, from time to time children have been humiliated and beaten for exposing
 economic crimes and safeguarding social morality.  Children are children
 after all.  Their ability to revolt against and resist attacks is inferior.
 They need adults' protection and they want adults to speak for them.  Both
 the state and the whole society are responsible for protecting children.
 This responsibility, above all, is the responsibility of party organiza-
 tions.  The Communist Party serves.the people, including children.  Our
 party organizations at all levels must pay close attention to safeguarding
 children's legitimate rights and interests.   They must mobilize forces of
 the whole party and the whole society to form powerful and lasting public
 opinion and supervision for successfully safeguarding children's legitimate
 rights and interests.   It is imperative to urge the departments concerned
 to prosecute those people who have seriously trampled on children.
 The motherland's seedlings can surely grow even more sturdily as long as
 comrades throughout the party become hardworking gardeners.

 A BRILLIANT EXAMPLE OF THE PARTY'S LEADERSHIP IN LITERATURE AND ART
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82 pp 5-6
 [Article by Commentator]
 [Text]  To mark the 40th anniversary of the publication of his "Talks at
 the Yanan Forum on Literature and Art," Comrade'Mao Zedong's 15 private
 letters to writers and artists were published.  The publication of these
 letters is of great significance in the correct and comprehensive under-
 standing of the fundamental spirit of the "Talks," in the strengthening of
 the party's leadership, over literature and art and in the adherence to the
 orientation of serving the people and socialism.
 Comrade Mao Zedong's letters to writers and artists are not ordinary letters
 to old friends or individuals.  Through these letters, we can deeply feel
 his loving care for the literary and art circles and his patient and syste-
 matic guidance for the literary and art workers.  Proceeding from the
 actual conditions, he always realistically solved various problems in the
 literature and art fields and guided the literary and art workers to advance
 in the correct direction.  These letters are a brilliant example of the
 party leadership in literature and art.
 The question of whom literature and art should serve has always been a
 fundamental question.  In these letters, Comrade Mao Zedong also considered
 this question of primary importance.  Since "the life at present is also a
 struggle," he particularly stressed that "we need militant works now," and
 that "both Yanan and the border regions badly need dramas reflecting the
 struggles in the enemy's rear flanks."  Although the situation is different
 today from that of the war period, it is still an important task for writers
 and artists to reflect the people's struggles and life in the revolution and
 construction.  In these letters, he enthusiastically supported the work of
 popularizing literature and art.  He affirmed the role played by the journal
 POPULAR LITERARY AND ART PRACTICE, which was aimed at helping correspondents
 and beginners raise their writing ability, and affirmed the article "Forms
 of Yangko Opera," which summed up the experiences of this opera.  On the
 question of how to comprehend Lenin's talks on art with Clara Zetkin, Com-
 rade Mao Zedong held that revolutionary literature and art should place
 their bases among the masses and serve the masses, so that "the feelings,
 thoughts and will of the masses" which were dispersed due to economic,

 political, geographical and national reasons, could be "united" through the
 spread of literature and art.  That is, as an artistic form spreading
 ideology, exchanging feelings and arousing consciousness, literature and art
 must promote the unity of the people so that they will take an active part
 in the fighting with one heart and one mind.  It was proceeding from this
 principle that Comrade Mao Zedong affirmed the play "Be Driven to the
 Liangshan Mountain," which "reveals history in its true colors."  The orien-
 tation Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out here for literary and art work is the
 same orientation he repeatedly stressed in his "Talks" and is certainly the
 only correct orientation of serving the people and serving socialism, which
 we must adhere to in our literature and art work today.  Under no circum-
 stances should our literature and art deviate from the general orientation
 of uniting the people, educating the people and encouraging the people to
 join in the revolution and construction with one heart and one mind.
 A very important question for our party in leading literature and art is
 how to correctly handle the relations between the party leaders and the
 literary and art workers.  This has a bearing on whether the large number of
 literary and art workers can be closely united around the party and whether
 their enthusiasm can be brought into full play to create more and better
 works for the people.  In these letters, Comrade Mao Zedong always fully
 affirmed the achievements and progress of the writers and artists with,
 immense zeal.  Understanding the orientation of serving the workers, peasants
 and soldiers after the Yanan forum on literature and art, a large number of
 literary and art workers plunged into the fiery struggles and soon scored new
 achievements.  With his keen strategic insight as a proletarian revolutionary
 and politician, Comrade Mao Zedong paid close attention to this new develop-
 ment.  When Comrade Ding Ling and Ouyang Shan wrote two special features
 about two exemplary people in cooperative work in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia
 border region, Comrade Mao Zedong "finished reading them in one breath after
 taking a bath and before going to bed" and wrote immediately to the two com-
 rades, extending his "congratulations to the Chinese people and to both of
 you for your new writing style."  Although this letter was written dozens
 of years ago, it is so ebullient that it still touches the receivers' hearts
 when they reread it today.  Comrade Ding Ling said:  "I was greatly encour-
 aged by this letter and thus began my new writing style.  What is my new
 writing style?  It is none other than writing about the workers, peasants
 and soldiers."  Comrade Ouyang Shan said:  "Whenever I recall this letter,
 I always feel a strong force that spurs me on."  Today, when we read these
 letters, Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings still warm our hearts.  We deeply
 feel that Comrade Mao Zedong was really an intimate friend and teacher of
 the literary and art circles.
 Comrade Mao Zedong took a serious attitude toward the work in the literature
 and art fields as well as in other fields and had a strong sense of prin-
 ciple.  While enthusiastically and cordially affirming and encouraging the
 writers and affirming their achievements, he also offered his sincere and
 comradely criticisms and aid and gave explicit and hearty directions to
 them. When he was informed by a writer about the situation in Yanan, he
 first replied in the affirmative that there actually were unhealthy practices
 in Yanan which needed to be rectified.  At the same time, he hoped that the

 writer would also "pay attention to one's own weak points and not to look at
 things one-sidedly."  "One must pay attention to the correct handling of
 one's relations with other people and must compel oneself to intentionally
 examine one's weak points."  He also required the writers to "examine their
 works with the Marxist viewpoint."  Whenever we read these sincere words and
 earnest requirements of Comrade Mao Zedong today, they still touch our
 hearts.  A speech made by Comrade Chen Yun in 1943, which was republished
 simultaneously with the publication of these letters, embodies the same
 principle and spirit.  In this speech, Comrade Chen Yun criticized two
 shortcomings in the literary and art circles at that time.  "One is privilege
 and.the other is arrogance."  He requested our party's"literary and art
 workers to first regard themselves as ordinary party members and not learned
 scholars.  He also asked them not to unrealistically overestimate the roles
 of literary and art work as well as personal achievements and talents.  This
 is still of important and immediate significance today.  Literary and art
 criticism is an important aspect of the party leadership in literature and
 art.  It includes commending good and excellent works and criticizing bad
 and erroneous works.  Under no circumstances should we.give up the weapon
 of criticism.  Some people dare not carry out principled criticism over the
 works or viewpoints which have obvious erroneous-tendencies for fear that
 the enthusiasm of the writers and artists may be dampened or that they them-
 selves may be blamed as "wielding big sticks."  Thus, the party leadership
 hasibecome lax and weak.  This situation must be changed.  However, there. is
 also a problem of method and result in carrying out criticisms.  The method
 of criticism displayed in Comrade Mao Zedong's letters, which is highly
 principled, must be taken as an-example for our leaders at various levels
 and for literary and art workers when carrying out literary and art
 criticisms.
 Comrade Mao Zedong was a great Marxist, and a great poet, too.   He was
 knowledgeable on the law of art.  He also paid serious attention to the
 investigation and study of the situation in. the literary and art circles.
 Before he made the speech at the Yanan forum on literature and art, he
 listened attentively to various opinions.  He discussed with Comrades
 Ouyang Shan and Cao Ming "problems concerning the literary and art policy,"
 and then wrote to them, asking them to "collect NEGATIVE opinions for me."
 [capitalized word underlined]  From here we can see that Comrade Mao Zedong
 not only paid attention to listening to positive and similar opinions but
 also paid attention to listening to negative and different opinions.  All
 correct and realistic policies,. principles, schemes and plans should be
 worked out after sufficient investigation and study and after listening to
 both positive and negative opinions.  Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks" is a
 brilliant Marxist work.  This is inseparable from his spirit of investiga-
 tion and study.
 Forty years have passed since the publication of the "Talks."  These letters
 were also written more than 30 or 40 years ago.  Now, as the situation has
 changed, Mao Zedong's literary and art thought.must also be developed in
 the light of the new situation and our historical experiences.  The past
 erroneous tendency of studying Comrade Mao Zedong's "Talks" and other works
 with a dogmatist attitude must be prevented.  However, Mao Zedong's

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 literary and art thought is still of important guiding significance today.
 Total repudiation of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought under the pretext
 of past mistakes or other reasons is an expression of bourgeois liberaliza-
 tion and must be resolutely opposed.  We must adhere to the basic principles
 of Mao Zedong's literary and art thought and continue to follow the brilliant
 example of Comrade Mao-Zedong in leading the work in the literature and art
 fields.  We must adhere to Mao 'Zedong's literary and art thought and the
 guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.  This is the only correct road for the
 development of our revolutionary literature and art.

 ARID AREAS IN THE NORTHWEST SHOULD ATTACH IMPORTANCE TO PLANTING TREES AND
 GRASS AND DEVELOPING A DIVERSIFIED ECONOMY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82. pp 7-8
 [Article by Commentator]
 [Text] Having little rainfall, some arid areas in the northwestern part
 of our country, such as Gansu Province, suffer more from natural disasters.
 In these areas, it is relatively difficult to make agriculture prosper at
 one stroke.  However, with large territories and rich resources, these areas
 have bright prospects and favorable conditions for developing a. diversified
 economy.
 Our problem, however, is that quite a few cadres in charge of rural work in
 these areas have a poor understanding of the importance of a diversified
 economy, and know little about how to promote it.  Unaware of the bright
 prospects of developing a diversified economy in these areas, they have
 failed to readjust crop planting distribution in light of the actual situa-
 tion and according to local conditions.  In fact, these areas should grow
 more industrial crops and should not attach sole importance to the produc-
 tion of grains on existing farmland.  There is no doubt that it will be
 relatively difficult to change the face of these backward areas if they
 depend solely on grain production.
 To effectively promote a diversified economy requires resolution and per-
 sistence.  The drive to promote a diversified economy must be pushed for-
 ward several times a year, and constant and continuous attention must be
 paid to the work.  Furthermore, investment in agricultural construction
 must be adjusted accordingly, and more funds should be allocated to promote
 a diversified economy.  Old practices must be cast off and new paths opened
 up in accordance with new circumstances.
 However, the most important step is to vigorously plant trees and grass so
 as to change the arid condition in the area.  To launch this drive, we must
 courageously criticize the thinking that tree and grass planting will not be
 successful without water conservation projects.  More than 100 years ago,
 Zuo Zhongtang, then governor of Shaanxi and Gansu Provinces, planted poplars
 and willows along the road stretching from the Shaanxi-Gansu border to
 Yumen.  In noticing Zuo Zhongtang's merit, someone wrote a poem for him, a
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 verse of which reads, "Poplars and willows have been planted along a road
 3,000 li long, and thus the spring breeze is brought to Yumen Pass."
 Although a feudal bureaucrat, Zuo Zhongtang still had such boldness of
 vision! How can we communists be afraid to embark on similar projects?  We
 must have firm faith that we can do a better job than he did if we are
 really determined.  Last December, when talking to the comrades of Sichuan
 Province, Comrade Deng Xiaoping strongly urged them to plant trees and,
 grass.  Planting trees and grass has many benefits.  It can conserve water
 and soil, purify the air, regulate climate, ease pollution and prevent sand
 from being blown by the wind.  In fact, this is a radical way to expand the
 area of vegetation, conserve soil and water, maintain an ecological balance
 and preserve the environment for the cycling of matter, which is indispen-
 sable for human existence.  Therefore, all arid areas must: pay attention to
 this work and should never lower their guard.
 Organs, schools, PLA units, and enterprises must be vigorously mobilized to
 take the lead in planting trees and grass.  For these areas, how many trees
 a person must plant a year is not an essential question.  Instead, we should
 try our best to plant as many.trees and as much grass as possible under
 existing conditions.  We must widely publicize the drive to plant trees and
 grass and carry it out in a big way.
 We should also be determined to develop animal husbandry, such, as cattle
 breeding, sheep breeding and so forth.  About 2,000 years ago, Ma Yuan, a
 well-known figure in the Han dynasty, achieved his great cause of developing
 animal husbandry in Gansu.  It is thus clear that husbandry has been well
 developed in Gansu in historic times.   In order to vigorously develop hus-
 bandry, we must pay attention to properly preserving grasslands.  Although
 there are vast grasslands in these areas, the number of livestock they
 carry is low as scientific methods have not been used to popularize a fine
 variety of pasture and management of the grasslands is poor.  Such a situa-
 tion must be completely changed.
 Furthermore, great attention must be paid to developing the processing
 industry for agricultural, sideline and special local products.  Great
 importance must also be attached to light industry and manufacture of
 products by minority nationalities, so that they can be developed as soon
 as possible.
 We must urge our cadres to go to grassroots units to conduct investigations
 into the problems involved in promoting a diversified economy and planting
 trees and grass.  We encourage more investigation and study, learning from
 the masses and from practice, because our cadres' knowledge in this field
 is limited and their ability to solve problems is poor.  This is the only
 way to enhance the knowledge of our cadres.
 Undoubtedly, our cadres in these areas such as Gansu have many merits which
 are worth being developed.  They are loyal, hardworking and honest.  How-
 ever, some of them also have several weak points:  For example, they are not
 sufficiently openminded and farsighted, and consequently, they are not
 readily receptive to new matters.  In fact, they are restricted by objective

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 conditions.  In remote border areas like these, culture is underdeveloped
 and people are poorly informed.  Therefore, we must pay close attention to
 arming our cadres with modern scientific knowledge.  We must educate them
 to broaden their view and open their minds by learning from people who
 have advanced experiences and are well versed in scientific knowledge.
 Our slogan is to take advanced people as our teachers and arm ourselves
 with scientific knowledge.

 GRASP THE BUILDING OF MATERIAL CIVILIZATION WITH ONE HAND AND THE BUILDING

 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82 pp 9-13
 [Article by Wang Shoudao]
 [Text]  Editor's note:  We commend this investigation
 report to the readers.  As circumstances permit, the
 veteran comrades pay visits and carry out investiga-
 tions.in the lower levels each year and meticulously
 compile written reports afterward.  It is a very good
 sign and should be encouraged in a big way.  By so
 doing, first, they will be able to keep in close touch
 with the actual conditions, and better propagate and
 implement the principle, lines and policies of the
 CCP Central Committee; second, they will be able to
 discover certain problems and put forth suggestions--
 this is the most practical advisory work; third, taking
 the lead in so doing, the veteran comrades pass on their
 yaluable experience to the cadres in power and particu-
 larly, the younger cadres.
 This spring I carried out an investigation of factories and villages in the
 municipalities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Zhuhai, Zhongshan, Xinhui, Jiangmen,
 Foshan, Nanhai and Conghua.  I held discussions with a number of responsi-
 ble comrades of the province and the prefectures, municipalities and coun-
 ties and also with rural cadres.  I also visited a number of workers' and
 peasants' homes.  I noticed that, in recent years, in the field of economic
 construction, Guangdong has achieved a faster rate of growth and higher
 economic returns.  The political situation is also getting better and
 better.  There have also been improvements in the party style, social
 climate and public order.
 Economic Construction Is Steadily Developing
 In the past few years, Guangdong Province has seriously implemented the
 central authorities' guiding principle on further readjusting the national
 economy and their decision that Guangdong should practice a special policy
 and flexible measures in its external economic activities.  Proceeding from

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 Guangdong's actual situation, the province has handled relatively well the
 relationships between centralized control and enlivenment of the economy,
 between advance and retreat, between readjustment and restructuring, and
 between expansion of external economic activities and economic readjustment
 and development.  As a result, steady development of the province's economy
 has been promoted.
 1.  Agricultural production is steadily developing.  In promoting agricul-
 tural production, Guangdong Province has linked the functioning of the
 superiority of the collective economy to the mobilizing of the individual's
 initiative, by means of continuously perfecting the agricultural production
 responsibility system, and thus has added strong driving force to the
 development of the rural economy.  Under the guidance of the state plan, the
 province has readjusted its agricultural economic distribution according to
 the local conditions, and thus has changed the relatively unitary economic
 structure of the past.  Comparatively remarkable development has been
 achieved in both the diversified economy and communes' and brigades' indus-
 trial and sideline production.  For example:  Vigorously promoting the
 diversified economy in the Zhu Jiang Delta under the circumstances that the
 rice growing area has been stabilized; reducing the grain procurement quota
 for mountainous areas and the border special zones, so as to push ahead with
 the development of forestry, forestry sideline production, the production of
 special local products and agricultural and sideline products for foreign
 trade such as vegetables, fish, poultry and so on; linking grain production
 with sugarcane production so as to push ahead with the latter; and estab-
 lishing a number of bases of commodity grain and bases of oil crops, fishery,
 forestry, animal husbandry, special local products, and so on, so as to
 gradually rationalize the internal production structure of agriculture.
 Last year relatively great development was recorded in industrial crops and
 diversification despite serious natural disasters such as floods and typhoons
 which caused a fall in grain output of 3 billion jin.  Sugarcane output may
 have reached 12 million tons, an increase of more than 30 percent over the
 previous refining season; this was the biggest increase recorded since the
 founding of the state.  Total value of the province's agricultural output
 rose by 3.3 percent over the previous year.  Nanhai County scored outstand-
 ing achievements.  Its total value of agricultural output in 1981 was 23.8
 percent higher than in 1980.  Despite a slight reduction in the grain and
 cocoon harvests due to natural disasters, forestry output value rose by 9.3
 percent, animal husbandry by 3.3 percent, sideline production by 44 percent,
 and fishery production by 4.1 percent.   The collective economy has developed
 rapidly, the political situation in the rural areas is more stable, and one
 of the best rural situations since the founding of the country has indeed
 emerged.
 2.  New progress was recorded in industrial production.  As far as industrial
 production is concerned, we have readjusted the orientation of service,
 improved the product mix, enlarged the scope of service and realized a rela-
 tively fast speed of development in accordance with the characteristics that
 there are a large number of workshops in the province, the degree of flexi-
 bility is high, and that there are sufficient export facilities since our
 province neighbors Hong Kong and Macao, and in accordance with the market
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100310001-3
 demand.  As a result, development of light industry was accelerated and
 there was a certain growth in heavy industrial production.  Last year total
 output value rose by 11.4 percent, with increases of 17 percent in light
 industry and 1.8 percent in heavy industry.  Based on the experiences gained
 in Jiangmen, Qingyuan and other municipalities and counties where experi-
 ments on reform of the economic system have been actively and steadily
 carried out, Guangdong has pushed forward various forms of the economic
 responsibility, rights and interests, improved business and management and
 aroused the enthusiasm of the enterprises and the broad masses of workers.
 The economic returns of state-owned industry and communications enterprises
 in Foshan municipality previously were never very good.  Profit per 100 yuan
 of output value was only some 5 yuan in 1979, lower than the average for the
 province, and also lower than the municipality's previous, best level.  Last
 year the Foshan Municipal CCP Committee vigorously popularized the experience
 of the Shiwan chemical industry ceramics plant in implementing the system of
 "four fixes and four guarantees" ("four fixes" means that: the plant fixes the
 number of workers in the workshops, fixes equipment, fixes raw material sup-
 plies and fixes expenditure; "four guarantees" means that: the workshops must
 guarantee quantity, quality, variety and profits).   Internal economic activ-
 ities among the enterprise units were carried out in accordance with esti-
 mated costs and the system of "free supply" was abolished.  On completion
 of the task of "four guarantees" the workshops would be given a certain
 amount of money as a bonus.  However, those workshops which were unable to
 complete the task of "four guarantees" would be fined in accordance with the
 regulations.   Various other forms of the economic responsibility system were
 also practiced in the administrative offices.  Thus the economic responsi-
 bility and economic interests of the internal units of the enterprises and
 the individual workers were made clear.   Thus', the staff'and workers of the
 enterprises were encouraged to enthusiastically seek ways to increase pro-
 duction and economize expenses.  As a result, distinctive economic results
 were obtained and large-scale. increases of production and revenue were
 achieved.  The municipality's industrial production quota was fulfilled 46
 days ahead of schedule.   Total value of industrial output: showed an
 increase of 23.11 percent, while profits rose by 55.29 percent and profit
 turned over to the state increased by 14.4 percent.  This was the highest
 rate throughout the province.
 3.  The province has actively developed external economic activities and
 speeded up the development of its domestic economy.  The trial operation of
 special economic zones has not only directly provided favorable conditions
 for economic construction in the special zones themselves, but has also
 indirectly supported economic development in the interior, stimulated joint
 undertakings'with the interior, and expressed the complementary relationship
 between economic development in the special zones and the interior.
 In the course of implementing its open-door policy, Guangdong has achieved
 three integrations.  First, economic activities with foreign countries have
 been integrated with economic readjustment and.now serve economic readjust-
 ment, thus enabling local industries to enjoy development in the course of
 the open-door policy and enabling their products to penetrate foreign
 markets and so bring their own superiority into play.  Second, economic

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100310001-3
 activities have been integrated with the technological transformation of
 enterprises and a number of enterprises have been equipped with advanced
 and suitable foreign technology.  Third, economic activities have been
 integrated with the development of urban and rural public facilities.
 Through various channels, they have attracted foreign capital for use in
 education, culture, bridges, roads, and so forth.  They have thus speeded
 up urban and rural construction.  Furthermore, in cities in border regions,
 they have started up lawful border trade on a small scale.  This has also
 definitely had a hand in increasing peasants' income, improving the lives
 of commune members and stabilizing public order in the border regions.
 4.  The markets are prosperous and lively and the standard of living of
 people in the urban and rural areas has improved.  In the wake of the
 development of production and the increase of the circulation channels, the
 markets have grown more and more prosperous.  Comparing 1981 with 1980, total
 volume of commodity retail sales rose by 15.9 percent, while purchasing
 power increased by 13.4 percent.  There were ample supplies of clothing and
 utensils.  Savings deposits of the urban and rural people increased by 45.7
 percent over 1980, urban workers' wages rose somewhat, jobs were found for
 400,000 during the year, and 5.1 million square meters of urban workers'
 housing were completed.  Housing conditions improved to some extent.
 The peasants' income from collective and domestic sideline occupation
 increased to a certain extent over last year.  In the rural areas new housing
 construction by peasants can be seen everywhere; this is a major hallmark of
 the improving standard of living of peasants.  In the rural areas in Nanhai
 County, there was an upsurge in building houses.  In many places both the
 scale and standard of construction exceeded the previous records, and.a
 situation in which "each household prepares the materials and each brigade
 is engaged with construction work" existed.  According to incomplete statis-
 tics for the county, the rural areas of the whole county built over 16,000
 houses last year, with a total area of over 1 million square meters.  Over
 90 percent of them were reinforced concrete structures.  Many old villages
 have taken on a new look.  Xiaolan commune in Zhongshan County built 3,502
 new houses last year (1,637 houses were reconstructed), showing an increase
 of 1,966 houses over the preceding year.  Peasants living in brick and tile-
 roofed houses accounted for 93 percent of the commune's total population.
 Many peasants in Nanhai County have developed from purchasing the "three old
 things" (bicycles, sewing machines, watches) to the "three new things"
 (television sets, radio-cassette players, electric fans).  The peasants in
 Xiaolan commune in Zhongshan County owned 24,069 bicycles in 1981, showing
 an increase of 2,992 over the preceding year; 10,681 sewing machines, show-
 ing an increase of 2,415 over the preceding year; 1,810 television sets, an
 increase of 835 over the preceding year; 7,416 electric fans, an increase of
 5,179 over the preceding year and 2,632 radio-cassette players, an increase
 of 1,193 over the preceding year.  Visiting the lower levels and seeing the
 improvement in the life of the broad masses, we are more confident of the
 future of our economic development.

 The Building of Spiritual Civilization Has Yielded Results
 In our socialist state, if socialist ideology fails to occupy a dominant
 position in the society, it is impossible to ensure a socialist orientation
 in building material and spiritual civilization.  At present, it is neces-
 sary, by centering on the task of building spiritual civilization and in the
 light of practical problems in work and ideology, to strive for a decisive
 turn for the better in party work style, social mood and. social order.
 First,.the problem of party work style occupies an important place in
 socialist spiritual civilization.  Guangdong implements special policies
 and adopts flexible measures in its external economic activities, but it
 should by no means be exceptional in party work style and party discipline.
 The open-door foreign policy and relaxation of domestic policy also chiefly
 refers to economic policies.  We should never relax party work style and
 party discipline, but should enforce them more strictly.   It should be
 affirmed that the foundation of the party work style in Guangdong Province
 is good.  The majority of party members and cadres are loyal to the cause
 of the party and the people, diligent and hardworking.  There are plenty of
 cadres who are willing to serve the people wholeheartedly and who bend
 their backs to their tasks until their dying day; there are also plenty of
 cadres who are honest in performing their official duties and remain uncon-
 taminated.  However, owing to various complicated causes, both historical
 and practical, the problem of party work style has now become an outstanding
 problem that should be solved urgently.  Due to the proximity to Guangdong
 of Hong Kong and Macao, the corrupt bourgeois ideology and lifestyle will
 definitely take advantage of the open-door policy to work their way in.
 In the economic sector, unhealthy tendencies and violations of the laws and
 discipline have been fairly serious.  A considerable number of party members
 have committed economic errors.  The proportion of economic cases in rela-
 tion to the total number of criminal cases has risen.  Furthermore, the
 amounts involved are generally quite big.  Viewed from the nature of the
 problems, illegal activities such as speculation, profiteering, graft,
 embezzlement, smuggling and selling of contraband, and offering and
 accepting bribes are on the increase; acts in violation of financial dis-
 cipline such as indiscriminate issuance of bonuses and loans, arbitrary
 price increases and illicit distribution of public property as well as
 unhealthy tendencies such as.making use of one's connections and influence
 have developed to some extent.  What is worthy of attention is that the
 circumstances of some cases are serious and the methods employed are
 heinous.  This reflects that some party members and cadres, and even lead-
 ing cadres, have a prominent tendency to "think of everything in terms of
 money."  Furthermore, some leading cadres quite obviously use their power
 for their own. gain and seek privileges.  Some leading cadres are seriously
 guilty of bureaucratism, are extremely irresponsible in their work and
 their revolutionary zeal is waning.  In the rural areas, some party members
 participate in feudal superstitions, gambling, armed conflicts and other
 activities, and the situation is also quite serious.  In view of the situa-
 tion stated above, the Guangdong Provincial CCP Committee has mustered its
 strength and grasped the problem from within.  With the power of a thunder-
 bolt and the speed of lightning, it has resolutely carried out investigations

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 and meted out punishments to those party members and cadres who have dared
 to flout the law and who openly take part in the smuggling and selling of
 contraband, graft, embezzlement, offering and accepting bribes and other
 violations of the law and discipline.  It has spared no one, regardless of
 seniority.  The.provincial CCP committee has stipulated that CCP organiza-
 tions at various levels should vigorously grasp party work style this year.
 It is necessary to mobilize the whole party to study again the "Guiding
 Principles for Inner-Party Political Life" and carry forward the party's
 three important work styles.  It is necessary to vigorously praise good
 party members and cadres, expose typical examples of unhealthy party work
 style and deal with them seriously.  The three special zones of Shenzhen,
 Zhuhai and Shantou have formulated regulations governing party and govern-
 ment cadres in the special zones so as to educate and check up on them.
 In Shenzhen, rectification of the party has been started by grasping typical
 cases of illegal building of houses and smuggling and selling of contraband
 and by dealing with them with great fanfare.  This has hit out at the
 unhealthy trends and practices, caused far-reaching repercussions and
 brought about an improvement in the social mood.
 Second, a problem that merits our serious attention in Guangdong is pre-
 serving a good social mood and preventing cadres and the masses from being
 contaminated and corrupted ideologically as a result of the open-door policy.
 The Guangdong Provincial CCP Committee has repeatedly and explicitly
 announced:  We should absorb as well as resist capitalist elements to a
 certain extent.  With respect to funds and technology from Western capital-
 ist countries, we should absorb them, but we should uphold proletarian
 spiritual civilization, maintain and carry forward the fine traditions of
 our nation and the proletariat and foster a new socialist mood.  Since
 February last year, the "five stresses and four beauties" activities have
 been vigorously launched in Guangdong.  In the past year, especially since
 the second half of last year, the building of spiritual civilization in
 Guangdong has yielded some results and social mood and social order has
 started to take a turn for the better.  To counter the problems of "dirt,
 disorder and high cost" in municipal environment and sanitation and in
 prices, Guangzhou municipality launched last year a "three rectifications"
 drive (rectifying the environment and sanitation, social order and traffic,
 and market prices) and, by taking this as a breakthrough in building
 spiritual civilization, organized several big activities.  At the same time,
 Guangzhou municipality launched extensive education in morality and in
 democratic and harmonious new family relationships along with activities
 .such as promoting new wedding styles and "learning from Lei Feng and
 adopting new habits."  At present, the appearance of the city's 25 main
 streets has started to change.  Some guest houses which were criticized by
 foreign guests in the past for their poor service have, through the
 civility and decorum activities, improved their work to a considerable
 extent.  The mood of unity and mutual help and of taking pleasure in help-
 ing others has also been initially revived and carried forward.  Moving
 examples reflecting the spirit of "a family in trouble enjoys the support
 of 100 families" have emerged in many localities.  Last year, the activities
 of "five stresses and four beauties" and "three loves" (love for the mother-
 land, socialism and the collective) were vigorously launched in the three

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 special zones of Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shantou.  At the same time, efforts
 were made to improve municipal environment and sanitation, traffic and
 order. The social appearance is now developing in a good direction.
 School education has an important position in building spiritual civiliza-
 tion.                     The special zones attach great importance to conducting positive
 education among youths in order to inspire their patriotic enthusiasm and
 guide them to study hard, engage in healthy and uplifting activities and
 develop in an all-round way, that is, to develop morally, intellectually
 and physically.  The atmosphere and appearance of the middle and primary
 schools in Shenzhen are taking a gradual turn for the better.  In Shenzhen's
 Futian junior middle school, there were only eight CYL members in April last
 year and the political atmosphere was weak.  Since the launching of the
 "five stresses and four beauties" activities, many pupils have been keen on
 making progress politically and, by the end of last year, the school had
 succeeded in recruiting 71 CYL members.  With the economic development in
 the special zones, the spiritual outlook of the people in the special zones
 is also changing.  The youths are very keen on studying and urgently wish to
 study new knowledge and technology.  More young workers have registered to
 take part in sparetime studies and studying diligently has become the order
 of the day.  The Guangming Overseas Chinese electronic factory in Shenzhen
 has proposed the "three resistings and three promotings" drive (resisting
 corrosion and influence by bourgeois ideas and promoting the style of being
 honest in performing one's official duties and of remaining uncontaminated;
 resisting the influence of the bourgeois practice of each trying to cheat
 or outwit the other and of benefiting oneself at the expense of others and
 promoting the style of being concerned for comrades and taking pleasure in
 helping others; resisting the influences of out-and-out bourgeois egoist
 ideas and promoting the style of safeguarding public property and abiding
 by social morality) and extensively and thoroughly conducted education in
 upholding the four basic principles and in socialism, patriotism and
 collectivism.
 Third, in strengthening the socialist legal system, improving social order
 and defending social order, Guangdong has done a lot of work.  Since last
 year, the party and government organs at various levels have extensively
 launched the "three rectifications" drive.  The public security and judicial
 departments have made a concerted effort in promptly and severely punishing
 various criminals such as counterrevolutionaries and murderers, arsonists,
 rapists, looters, traffickers in narcotics and ringleaders of criminal gangs
 who seriously endangered social order.  With respect to various illegal
 organizations and publications, obscene books, paintings, tapes and video-
 tapes, steps have been taken to.resolutely ban them in accordance with the
 relevant regulations, laws and decrees of the state.  The work of suppressing
 smuggling in the border and coastal areas has also been strengthened by
 mobilizing the masses to report or expose offenses to the authorities.  A
 number of cases such as smuggling and selling of contraband, tax evasion and
 speculation have been proved through investigation.  This has dealt a severe
 blow to economic criminal activities.  By so doing we have succeeded in
 consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship and further removing
 various factors unfavorable to stability and unity.  This has contributed to
 the relatively stable environment in life and work throughout the province

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 and ensured the smooth progress of industrial and agricultural production
 and other work.  There was a turn for the better in social security as a
 whole last year.  The healthy tendency is in the ascendant and the unhealthy
 tendency is in the descendent.  Good people and deeds related to the strug-
 gle against bad people and deeds have emerged in large numbers.  The dis-
 orderly conditions such as "the neighbors closing their doors when a house-
 hold is being robbed," "all people looking on with folded arms while another
 is being maltreated," and "good people are bullied while bad people are over-
 weening" have changed.  Last year the incidence of crime was 18 percent less
 than in 1980.  This included a 55 percent decline in cases of robbery.  How-
 ever, owing to various reasons, especially to the proximity of Hong Kong and
 Macao to Guangdong and to its being situated in a border and coastal area,
 which results in an excessive number of transient people and in a relatively
 complicated situation, the social order as a whole has not taken a funda-
 mental turn for the better.  Various criminal activities such as robbery,
 theft, gambling and mercenary marriage still continue to occur.  We should
 still make tremendous efforts in order to check the unhealthy tendencies..
 Several Questions That Merit Attention
 This visit to Guangdong was very fruitful.  I and other comrades who traveled
 with me were glad to see fast economic development in Guangdong and a
 promising urban and rural political situation.  While carrying out inspec-
 tions and discussions on our way, we gathered the following opinions:
 1.  When the Central Committee decided to set up experimental special
 economic zones in Guangdong and Fujian Provinces, it was a brand new under-
 taking.  We are groping our way forward.  We need to continuously sum up
 experiences and lessons in the'course'of practice. Whether they are experi-
 ences of success or lessons of error, as long as we clear-headedly recog-
 nize them, they will all be beneficial to our work.  The Shenzhen-Shekou
 industrial zone has taken the initiative by setting up special zones and
 has reaped distinct results.  The Shenzhen-Xili reservoir resort has its
 own rustic flavor.  The Zhuhai-Shijingshan mountain resort has set up a
 strict, scientific management system and has enlightened us much in our
 work.  Certain of our units and organizations are overstaffed.  There are
 more personnel than matters to be attended to.  They are plagued by bureau-
 cratism.  Whenever they are confronted with work, they try to pass the buck.
 Efficiency is extremely low.  Some people hold "iron ricebowls" and eat from
 a "big pot."  Should they not learn from these good experiences to overcome
 the malpractices in their own work?  *Some comrades have adopted all along a
 negative, suspicious attitude toward the open-door policy and the experi-
 mentation with special zones.  They think that the open-door policy has
 opened a back door for bourgeois ideology and has corrupted the party style
 and social climate.  We are no longer in the period of remote antiquity.
 No country in the world can now afford to keep itself to itself.  During
 the feudal dynasties of the Ming and Qing in Chinese history, we tried on
 numerous occasions to implement a "closure of ports."  This was to have dire
 consequences on the development of our own productive forces and caused
 tremendous political and economic loss.  The open-door policy is highly
 conducive to the enlightenment of people's thinking and the promotion policy

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 will inevitably cause certain lawless elements to take advantage of the
 situation and carry out activities designed to sabotage socialist construc-
 tion and also definitely affect the party style and social climate.  How-
 ever, the present problems associated with the party style and social
 climate are not entirely due to the open-door policy.  We must both
 acknowledge its side effects and even more recognize the nature of the prob-
 lem.  We must have full confidence in the open-door policy and our experi-
 mentation with special economic zones.  We must conscieni_iously sum up and
 continuously improve.  The special economic zones must not be completely
 Westernized.   They must not turn into second Hong Kongs or Macaos.
 2.   There has been a good start in building spiritual civilization and an
 improvement in the social and moral atmosphere.  However., the development
 is unbalanced.  What merits our attention now is that there are still many
 party committees and leading cadres who do not have a sufficient under-
 standing of the significance of building spiritual civilization.   Some of
 them think that they are too busy with their work and cannot spare time to
 promote the building of spiritual civilization; some of them lack confi-
 dence in building spiritual civilization, holding that "a bonus of 10 yuan
 is better than doing 1 year's work in grasping spiritual civilization"; some
 think that spiritual civilization is unable to solve problems and is like
 scratching an itch from outside one's boots; some think that grasping
 civilization is the work of the departments, and wonder why the CCP Central
 Committee and the provincial CCP committees should make a fuss of it.  In
 order to persistently and profoundly launch the building of spiritual
 civilization, we must strengthen and improve party leadership and further
 enhance the whole party's understanding of building spiritual civilization.
 In the course of building spiritual civilization, we must strongly grasp the
 question of party work style, social customs and social order.  We must
 create public opinion in a big way so that it can become regular and syste-
 matic among the masses.  On the basis of extensively mobilizing the masses
 and improving the level of understanding, we must make the best use of the
 situation and formulate certain practicable facts, agreements with the
 masses, management regulations, rules and so forth in relation to the over-
 all situation or certain aspects of building spiritual civilization.  We
 must, by means of building spiritual civilization, make our people become
 people who have ideals, morality, culture and who abide by discipline.
 3.  Market prices is a major matter to thousands and thousands of families.
 Last year in Guangdong, procurement of agricultural and sideline products
 at negotiated prices and increases in the rural financial credit expendi-
 ture, workers' bonuses and transient laborers accounted for the situation
 in which a large amount of the currency was put in circulation, an exces-
 sive amount of food coupons were in the hands of the people and there was
 short supply of vegetables, nonstaplefoods, construction materials for
 the rural areas, medium-size and small farm tools and other commodities.
 In addition, slackened market management and increased prices of commodities
 have affected the livelihood of the masses and, in particular, the liveli-
 hood of a certain section of workers and staff members.  The question of
 commodity prices is a matter of overall importance and is a relatively
 complicated question.  We must resolutely implement the 10 regulations on

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 stabilizing market prices issued by the State Council recently, and adopt
 the comprehensive measure of integrating economic and administrative methods
 and ideological education.  The state-owned commercial enterprises must take
 the lead and set good examples in implementing the market price policy and
 strictly forbid private price increases and price increases made in dis-
 guised forms.   It is necessary to seriously deal with cases in violation of
 the price policy and price discipline.  We must punish according to law
 those who break the law.  Governments at all levels must perfect the organs
 in charge of commodity prices, carry out regular inspections of the market
 prices, form a system and strengthen supervision by the masses.  Maintaining
 fundamentally stable commodity prices is extremely essential to stabilizing
 the economy, maintaining stability and unity and improving the masses'
 livelihood.  This must not be treated lightly.

 ENHANCE THE ROLE OF BANKS AND DEVELOP DOMESTIC CAPITAL
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82 pp 14-17, 8
 [Article by Liu Hongru [0491 7703 0320]]
 [Text] While explaining the Ten Point Economic Construction Policy at the
 4th Session of the 5th NPC, Comrade Zhao Ziyang pointed out:  "The role of
 banks in accumulation, transfer and unified control of credit funds should
 be strengthened."  Implementing earnestly this policy, bringing the role of
 banks into full play and developing domestic capital have great significance
 in finding a solution to present financial difficulties, in carrying out
 the mission of economic readjustment and in accelerating the socialist
 modernization program.
 Lack of funds is an outstanding problem in maintaining a certain growth
 rate in our economic construction.  However, it must also be noted that at
 present there is amazing waste in various fields, ranging from production
 and circulation to capital construction.  Enormous social wealth will result
 if potential is tapped.  Therefore, on the one hand, we must through our
 policies arouse the enthusiasm of the enterprises, the communes and their
 subdivisions, the staff and workers as well as the peasants, tap potential,
 develop the economy and try by every means possible to increase production
 and revenue and add to the wealth of society.  This is a basis for develop-
 ing domestic capital.  On the other hand, we must pool the scattered funds
 and by means of banking and the use of bank credits use them in the produc-
 tion and construction needed by the state, while putting financial matters
 under centralized control and making use of capital.
 Lenin long ago advocated the use of the bank to regulate the socialist
 economic life of the country as a whole.  However, we have for many years
 failed to pay attention to fully enhancing the role of banks.  Since the
 3d Plenary Session o.f the 11th CCP Central Committee, the CCP Central Com-
 mittee and the State Council have pointed out that efforts should be made
 to help banks become a tool for developing the economy and renovating tech-
 nology and that stress should be laid on encouraging banks to become
 involved in more activities, undertake more tasks and give full play to
 their greater role in opening up new prospects of acquiring and accumu-
 lating funds and im improving the use of funds.  Following this orienta-
 tion, we have over the last 3 years adopted various methods of collecting
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100310001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100310001-3
 funds and have expanded the scope of bank credits.  For example, we have
 changed from the method of free subsidies for some parts of the investment
 in fixed assets to that of bank loans which have to be repaid with interest;
 the People's Bank has begun to grant medium- and short-term loans for buying
 and upgrading equipment with emphasis on the replacement and renovation of
 equipment and technical transformation of enterprises which produce goods
 for everyday consumption; the eligible recipients have been expanded from
 production and circulation fields to service trades, tourism and units in
 the scientific and technological departments which have business income and
 the ability to repay.  In controlling credit, we have followed the principle
 of dealing with each case on merit and supporting those which excel in their
 business and paid attention to implementing the role of such economic levers
 as credit rate and foreclosure.  All of these reforms have played a fairly
 satisfactory role in improving the economic results of the funds, developing
 domestic capital and promoting economic readjustment.  Practice has proved
 that emphasizing utilization of the bank to raise social funds and using
 those funds for production and construction through loan distribution are
 in complete accord with the new conditions of the development of our economy
 and reflect the objective requirements of the economic structural reform and
 a correct way to improve the economic results of investment.
 The banks' capital comes mainly from:  1) official listed capital and the
 accumulation of a certain portion of profits which the bank is entitled to
 keep~as credit funds; and 2) the currency issued in accordance with the
 needs of the development of production and the expansion of circulation.
 With the development of production and the increase in the people's income,
 more and more money has been absorbed by the bank.  Particularly since the
 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee, with the greater finan-
 cial power of the local authorities and enterprises, the growing collective
 economy, the increasing income of the urban and rural population and more
 money in the hands of the enterprises, units and individuals, the bank is in
 a position to accumulate these scattered funds by means of absorbing
 deposits on which interest is paid.  This will, on the one hand, safeguard
 the economic rights and interests of the depositors and,.on the other hand,
 enable the state to arrange and use these funds in a planned way.  During
 the 3 years from 1979 through 1981, various kinds of bank deposits increased
 by a big margin at an average annual rate of 2,000 percent over 1978.  But
 we must also understand that bank deposits are reserve currency and the
 monetary expression of social material wealth; therefore, the growth in
 deposits is restricted by production increases, national income and the
 consumption fund.  Bank loans are limited by the sources of capital on the
 one hand and by the volume of material supplies on the other.  Provided the
 volume of bank loans is complementary to that of material supplies, the
 realization of bank loans in kind can be ensured.  Banks should not rely on
 an oversupply of currency in circulation to expand their credits because
 the issuance of currency must suit the needs of commodity circulation.
 Oversupply of currency in circulation will lead to price hikes and infla-
 tion.  This is an objective demarcation line.
 The CCP and the people's government have always adopted a policy of keeping
 the value of money stable and have persisted in not adopting the method of
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100310001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 issuing more money to expand the scope of capital construction.  This is a
 major condition for ensuring the smooth implementation of the economic
 readjustment, effecting the steady growth of the economy and consolidating
 the stability and unity of the political situation throughout the nation.
 The fairly rapid growth of currency in circulation over the last 3 years
 has resulted from the changes in economic development.  This is because the
 fairly rapid growth of agriculture and light industry and the expansion of
 the scope of commodity circulation created a need for a corresponding
 increase in the supply of currency in circulation.  At the same time, with
 the implementation of the various forms of the production responsibility
 system in rural areas and the restoration and development: of the collective
 economy and the individual economy in cities and towns, there have been many
 more economic units and management levels for preserving cash in the urban
 and rural areas, and with more people working, the growth of income for
 people in both urban and rural areas and the increase in the reserve money
 of the units and the individuals, there has been a greater capacity for
 currency in circulation.  However, we must also acknowledge that the present
 supply of currency in circulation is still on the excessive side and the
 ratio of the currency in circulation to the volume of commodity supplies
 still has not reached previous normal levels.  Latent dangers still exist.
 If more currency is issued, it will be difficult to keep market prices
 basically stable or to consolidate the results of the economic readjustment.
 Must we therefore adopt the method of tightening money supply and reducing
 consumption to withdraw huge amounts of currency from circulation as we did
 when our country encountered economic difficulties in the 1960's?  This also
 will not do.  This is because, first, the current economic readjustment is
 carried out in a situation where there is a sustained increase in both
 industrial and agricultural production.  Furthermore, in order to lay a
 foundation for future long-term development, we must maintain a certain
 growth rate.  This determines that in financial matters, reducing the amount
 of bank loans by a big margin and stifling the economy is not permissible.
 Second, the current economic readjustment is carried out in a situation
 in which the peasants' income has increased, large numbers of people
 awaiting employment in cities and towns have been given fobs and there has'
 been an increase in both wages and bonuses.  Reabsorbing currency from
 circulation by relying on reducing the number of staff and workers and con-
 sumption is not permissible.  Instead it is necessary to suit currency
 circulation to commodity circulation by significantly boosting production
 of consumer goods, of agricultural means of production and of building
 materials for agricultural use and increasing commodity supplies.  Third,
 although large and medium-sized projects under construction, whose scopes
 are overstretched and building cycles rather long, cannot produce results
 for the time being, they must not be abandoned all at once as was done in
 the past when we suspended construction of the "small local construction-
 groupings."  The disproportions in the economy and the oversupply of cur-
 rency in circulation are the result of the "leftist" mistakes which have
 existed for years.  It will take time to return to normal and it cannot be
 accomplished in a year or two.  Precisely because of this, although the
 supply of currency in circulation is on the excessive side and exceeds the
 needs of commodity circulation, in order to help readjust heavy industry
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 to service orientation, we must, within the limits of state plans for the
 national economy and of bank credits, increase loans for production and
 construction as much as possible, and in particular support the production
 of goods for everyday consumption, boost the production of brand-name goods
 which sell well and also the production of building materials for agricul-
 tural use and the agricultural means of production which are needed by the
 peasants.  Rather than reabsorbing huge amounts of currency from circula-
 tion by adopting the method of tightening money supply and reducing con-
 sumption to shrink production in an oversimplified way, we must support
 agriculture in developing grain production and a diversified economy to
 provide more raw materials, to light and textile industries so that they can
 develop and supply the market with more commodities.  Thus, for a .certain
 time there will be no rapid improvement in the situation in which the supply
 of currency in circulation is still on the excessive side.  However,
 because bank loans are used mainly to finance operational activities which
 require less money but promise quicker and bigger results, once they produce
 economic results, it is possible to increase commodity supplies at a fairly
 rapid pace, step up the withdrawal of currency from circulation, boost
 financial revenue and thus provide a material base for returning currency
 circulation to normal.
 At present, the contradiction confronting us is this:  on the one hand,
 .theme has been an oversupply of currency in circulation and the issuance
 of currency must be put under strict control, while, on the other hand,
 it is still necessary to increase some loans to revitalize the economy
 under a unified state plan.  In order to solve this contradiction, accumu-
 late more funds and raise the economic results of the use of funds, banks
 should devote their energy and time in the following ways:
 1.  Vigorously develop the savings undertakings in urban and rural areas.
 In recent years, with the increase in their income, urban and rural resi-
 dents have had more cash in their hands, part to be used as a working fund
 for covering the needs of daily life and production and which cannot be
 absorbed in large quantities as'savings deposits, and the other part to be
 used as reserve funds for buying such goods as durable consumer goods and
 for savings which will rise for a long time.  By absorbing into the bank
 this part of personal savings which will not be used for the time being,
 we will be able to turn consumption funds into production funds in a plan-
 ned way.and that part of the latter which is relatively stable over a long
 period of time can be used to support construction.  At the same time, the
 realization of its potential as purchasing power can be postponed, thus
 reducing the currency in circulation.  Of course, to increase savings
 deposits, banks must adopt strong measures, such as doing a good job in
 propaganda work, improving the quality of service, readjusting savings
 interest rates, increasing varieties in savings which suit the needs of
 the masses, setting up more savings networks and strengthening the work of
 rural credit cooperatives.
 2.  Offer leadership to the various enterprises and units in planned use of
 funds in production and construction.  In accordance with the regulations
 of the state's system of cash control, apart from a small quantity of cash

 to be retained for services and supplies, the monetary income of the
 enterprises and units must go to the bank.  For the. enterprises and units,
 the question of absorbing idle funds in society does not exist.  The problem
 at present is how to guide enterprises and units which have surplus funds
 at their disposal to try as far as possible to invest these restricted funds
 in production and construction which are urgently needed by the state and
 promise good economic results.  The guidance may be multifaceted.  For exam-
 ple, the bank is allowed to handle fixed deposits of the enterprises and
 units, pay them higher interest than is paid on current deposits and con-
 vert short-term funds into long-term ones; it is allowed to issue bonds
 under specified conditions so as to concentrate long-term funds and support
 the small number of construction projects within the jurisdiction of state
 plans; to handle trust business in places where conditions permit and within
 the limits of state regulations; and to adopt flexible and various ways to
 absorb and use funds and do more work under a unified state plan so as to
 benefit the revitalization of the economy.   Further, developing domestic
 insurance will enable us to establish a system of economic compensation on
 the one hand and play the role of accumulating funds on the other.  In
 struggle to combat floods and help to tide the people over natural disasters,
 as in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Liaoning Provinces in 1981, the system of insur-
 ance displayed its great compensatory role.  The insurance premium handed
 over by Sichuan Province to the insurance company in the 2 years 1979-80
 was no more than 20 million yuan but in 1981 the insurance company paid an
 indemnity of 77 million yuan for losses suffered by Sichuan Province from
 natural disasters, thus helping the disaster-stricken enterprises quickly
 restore production.  This shows that establishing this system of economic
 compensation on a nationwide scale and putting the transfer of funds under
 unified control will play a positive role in restoring production and
 stabilizing life in the disaster areas and ensuring the stability of
 financial revenue and expenditure.
 3.  Tap the potential of existing funds, try hard to reduce the funds
 seized and left idle in the circulation field, increase goods and materials
 and speed up the turnover of funds.  At present, large quantities of circu-
 lating funds are seized and left idle by industrial and commercial enter-
 prises all over the country; the turnover of these funds is slow.  This is
 an outstanding manifestation of poor economic results.  For example, the
 turnover rate of circulating funds of state-run enterprises in 1981 was 3.12,
 a decrease of 1.15 compared with the 1965 record of 4.27.  The turnover rate
 of the circulating funds of the commercial enterprises also did not reach
 the highest record in history.  Reducing our circulating funds by 2 or 3
 percent will mean a nationwide savings of 7 to 10 billion yuan.  In dis-
 cussing the principle of reproduction, Marx said that commodity reserve is
 divided into voluntary reserve and nonvoluntary reserve.  The former is the
 necessary. condition for commodity circulation and the latter is the result
 of goods not being sold well.   We must strive for a growth rate on the basis
 of products of good quality and responsive to social demands.  This is a
 true growth rate void of exaggeration.  While speed is mentioned, we must no
 longer blindly seek output value, because this will result in huge over-
 stocking of surplus goods and poor-quality and unmarketable goods and
 ineffective use of huge funds.  Consequently emergence of the phenomena

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 whereby "in industry, good news is announced while in commerce, bad news;
 in warehouses, there is overstocking while in finance, nominal increases."
 Eventually, as a result more banknotes have to be issued.  In order to pre-
 vent this situation, in regard to the enterprises whose products are in
 excessive supply banks should practice stricter and tighter control over
 funds and resolutely carry out the system of raising interest rates and
 requiring more interest as a forfeit and even stopping the granting of
 loans.  It is necessary to uphold the principle of production, purchase and
 order according to sale, stimulate the enterprises to economize on the use
 of funds and cut down the seizure of funds.  We must strive to support the
 enterprises to produce and market more products which meet social demands
 with the least possible credit funds and provide the state with more accumu-
 lation.  At the same time, in order to increase goods and materials and
 revitalize the economy, it is also necessary to use the bank to do a good
 job in smoothing things out.  For example, of the machinery and electrical
 products kept in stock, some are needed for replacement and renovation of
 equipment and technical transformation.  However, handicapped by a lack of
 funds, the enterprises are unable to buy them.  In regard to these products
 kept in stock which have a ready market, banks should on the one hand grant
 loans to units to purchase and upgrade needed equipment and, on the other,
 call in the circulating fund loans used in stocking materials.  Some products
 kept in stock can be marketed through installment payments.  In this way,
 with little or no increase in the total amount of loans, the goods and mate-
 rials kept in stock can also come into play and reinvigorate heavy industry,
 thus bringing to the state additional income in taxes and profits.
 4.  With regard to helping to improve economic results, transfer funds and
 choose the orientation and key points for their'tise and explore and open up
 new sources of revenue.   In accordance with the decisions of the state on
 the entire national economy and the nature of credit funds that loans con-
 tracted from credit funds should be repaid and credit funds kept in con-
 tinuous circulation, in using limited funds, banks should give priority to
 production and construction activities which require less money but promise
 quicker and bigger results by adopting a method of "rolling a snowball" so
 that they can provide more products and funds in a fairly short period of
 time.  1) Vigorously support the development of the rural commodity economy
 rather than using funds purely in relief work.  2) Substantially support
 development of the production of consumer goods and stimulate heavy industry
 to readjust its orientation toward services.  At the same time, positive
 support should also be given to such fields which need funds as service
 trades, tourism, culture, education and hygiene.  3) Support existing
 enterprises which are carrying out technical transformation in an orderly
 way and do a good job in the technical transformation of enterprises pro-
 ducing consumer goods.  Positive credit support should also be given to
 energy and transport and communications projects under the jurisdiction of
 state plans which ensure a quicker turnover of funds, promise bigger results
 and have business resources and the ability to repay.  Practice shows that
 so long as the above-mentioned orientation and key points are upheld, it is
 very necessary to explore and open up new sources of revenue for the bank to
 use in granting certain medium- and short-term loans for buying and upgrad-
 ing equipment to be used in replacement and renovation and technical

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 transformation.  The total amount of the additional medium- and short-term
 loans for buying and upgrading equipment which was granted by the People's
 Bank in the 3 years 1979-81 constituted 10 percent of the total amount of
 the increase in loans.  These credit funds were used mainly to replace and
 renovate equipment and in the technical transformation of old enterprises;
 about 70 percent were used to support the technical transformation of enter-
 prises in the light and textile industries.  This has played a fairly satis-
 factory role in boosting the production of consumer goods and promoting
 economic readjustment.  With a big increase in the production of consumer
 goods--an important condition--market prices can thus be kept basically
 stable and the supply of currency can be reduced.  Thus, it is justified to
 say that proper use of loans can boost financial revenue, accelerate with-
 drawal of currency from circulation and benefit the realization of the basic
 balance between finance and credit.
 5.  Do a good job in the overall balance between funds and materials.  At
 present, the bank not only grants circulating fund loans but also extends
 fixed assets loans.   In a situation in which the country has financial
 difficulties and the supply of currency in circulation is still excessive,
 will credit inflation emerge?  This is a question which concerns some com-
 rades and is also a problem existing in our practical work and calls for
 attention and earnest solution.  Besides practicing strict planning and
 control over the scope, orientation and key points of the use of bank loans
 as we have stated above, it is also necessary to do a-good job in the over-
 all balance between funds and materials.  First, the balance between the
 source and use of credit funds is achieved mainly in terms of the total
 amount and the makeup of funds.  In terms of the total amount of funds,
 the amount of bank loans extended must correspond to the source of funds.
 This is a premise.  It is still necessary to make an analysis of the con-
 ditions of long-term funds (for a year or longer), the officially listed
 bank capital, the relatively stable part of long- and short-term deposits
 which are continuously circulating, some being drawn out and some invested
 to make up the sources of funds.  Second is the balance between bank loans
 and goods.  The question whether or not credit inflation will emerge lies
 in whether or not a balance between bank loans and goods can be maintained
 and the specific terms of the loans, whether or not the required goods can
 be ensured, the materials are applicable and the economic results can be
 guaranteed rather than in the size of bank loans.  Every bank loan must go
 through strict examination to see whether or not the source of goods has
 been fixed and whether or not fairly good economic results can beprac-
 tically ensured.  In our work, so as to prevent blind and duplicate pro-
 duction, we must act according to the plans stipulated by the state and we
 must not undertake new projects outside the state plan.  Finally, it is
 still necessary to adhere to a unified balance between finance and credit.
 6.  Credit funds should be put under a unified plan and policy as well as
 control.  In order to speed up construction, some localities and departments
 have undertaken more capital construction projects by pooling funds.  Some
 localities have set up various forms of investment companies and run local
 banks in a disguised form; some have raised funds by asking banks to give
 them money not set in the previous planning.  These actions, in fact, amount
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 to drawing out funds which have been deposited in banks and which have
 already been included in the banks' planning and also going in for non-
 budgetary capital construction or using funds for other purposes.  Actually,
 as far as the enterprises and units are concerned, there are no idle funds.
 Their funds are all deposited in the bank.  The bank takes account of such
 deposits in making credit plans.  Withdrawal of the deposits of enterprises
 and units results in deficits in the arrangement of funds.  Eventually, all
 parties concerned would reduce their deposits in the People's Bank with the
 result being either the issuance of more banknotes, which is not permissible,
 or the reduction in bank loans which are needed in normal production and
 circulation.  This is to no avail.  Therefore, money must be collected and
 funds raised through the bank.  The People's Bank must earnestly carry out
 its  responsibilities as the central state bank, be responsible for issuing
 banknotes, balance credit plans in a unified way and, while balancing, try
 hard to ensure increases in some places while decreases emerge in other
 parts and to eliminate deficits.
 Our country has always practiced a centralized and unified policy in its
 financial undertakings.  Practice in the 32 years since the founding of the
 PRC has proved that this policy conforms to the objective requirements of
 the socialist planned economy and the inherent laws governing the movement
 of credit funds.  In accordance with the regulations stipulated by the
 State Council, credit matters must be centralized in the hands of banks and
 no localities are allowed to set up any financial organs without authoriza-
 tion.  The financial organs approved by the State Council must also bring
 their credit activities into line with a unified plan, do a good job in the
 overall balance so that the issuance of currency can be put under strict
 control.  Under a unified policy and plan as well as unified control, the
 various banks (including the People's Bank of China and specialized banks)
 must share the work and cooperate with one another, gradually reform the
 management system and work regulations and rules which are not suited to
 the needs of economic development, accumulate more funds, put the funds to
 effective use, transfer funds in a flexible way and make concerted efforts
 to raise the economic results of the funds.  At the same time, it is also
 necessary to strengthen the supervisory functions of the bank, resolutely
 combat criminal activities in the economic field and resolutely struggle
 against all sorts of activities which violate financial and economic dis-
 cipline.  Strict checkups must be carried out on the various items such as
 loans, transfer closing accounts, receipts and payments of cash and revenue
 and expenditure of foreign exchange so as to stop the leaks.  If problems
 crop up, they should be investigated thoroughly and dealt with seriously.
 It is necessary to sum up experience, further enhance the role of banks and
 make greater contributions to the socialist modernization program.

 EARNESTLY CARRY OUT RESEARCH ON THE ECONOMIES OF DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82 pp 18-22
 [Article by Qian Junrui [6929 0193

 I
 Under the present international circumstances, it is of great importance to
 earnestly study the economic issues in developing countries.  This can pro-
 mote China's modernization construction, develop friendly cooperation with
 Third World countries, particularly in the economic field, and carry for-
 ward our common struggle to establish a new international economic order.
 Since World War II, along with the upsurge of national liberation movements,
 many colonial and semicolonial countries have won independence-one after
 another; the colonial system of imperialism has disintegrated and the Third
 World has mounted the stage of history as a new force.  The national econo-
 mies of developing countries have been growing and getting stronger.  How-
 ever, owing to the long-term rule, plunder and exploitation of colonialism
 and imperialism and the aggravating scramble of the two superpowers for
 spheres of influence and world hegemony, developing countries still face a
 lot of difficulties and problems in developing their economies.  They have
 the solemn task of developing national economies and safeguarding political
 independence.  China is a developing socialist country which belongs to the
 Third World.  We have the same past experiences as other developing coun-
 tries and shoulder a common fighting task together with them.  We con-
 sistently give our sympathy and support to developing countries in their
 struggle to defend national independence, develop national economies and
 strive for social progress.  The Chinese people will always stand side by
 side with the Third World countries and peoples and fight to break the old
 international economic order and establish a just and reasonable new inter-
 national economic order.
 The developing countries hold an important position in the world economy.
 They have three-quarters of the world's population and cover three-fifths
 of the globe.  They are rich in natural resources and there are industrious
 and wise people in these countries.  The people of developing countries have
 created prosperous economies with their own hands and have had brilliant
 ancient cultures.  It is only since the 15th century that they successively
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 suffered aggression, oppression and plunder by Western colonialism and
 imperialism and therefore were reduced to the status of poor and backward
 colonies, semicolonies and dependencies which supplied raw materials for
 imperialism, were markets for its products and gave it opportunities for
 investment.  Since their independence, however, these countries have
 increasingly strengthened their capability to develop their economies
 independently.  The economies of developed Western capitalist countries,
 on the other hand, have become more and more dependent on developing coun-
 tries.  Some 75 percent of crude oil needed in developed capitalist coun-
 tries is supplied by the Third World.  Some 40 percent of the crude oil
 needed by the United States and 90 percent of that needed by Japan, West
 Germany and France must be imported.  Besides crude oil, 60 percent of their
 needs for major agricultural and mineral raw materials have to,be supplied
 by developing countries.  In particular, nearly all major strategic raw
 materials used in the nuclear energy, space navigation and electronics
 industries, such as beryllium, lithium, cobalt and other rare metals, must
 be imported from developing countries.  In addition, developed Western
 countries must also depend on exporting capital and selling products to the
 Third World.  It can be seen that, at present, in the interdependent world
 economy, most of the developed capitalist countries would find it difficult
 to subsist without the developing countries.  Developing countries have
 great potential for developing their economies.  Those who deem that Third
 World countries have no impetus from within to develop their economies but
 can only achieve development by depending on the "charity" of the developed
 countries are obviously people with wildly arrogant prejudice (some people
 in developed countries) or have an inferiority complex (some people in the
 Third World); their point of view is absolutely groundless.
 Since their independence the developing countries have worked out and
 carried out a series of strategies, policies and measures to develop their
 national economies.  For example, they have handled these matters:  How
 a state should intervene in economic life to mobilize the initiative of
 various economic elements; how strategies and plans for economic development
 should be worked out in the light of local specific conditions and how
 unreasonable economic structures should be reformed; how to utilize, limit
 and supervise foreign capital on the basis of self-reliance, to import
 practicable technology and to develop scientific and educational undertak-
 ings; how to exploit manpower resources and to promote economic develop-
 ment; how to prevent the environment from being polluted and how to pre-
 serve the ecological balance; and so on.  In the course of practice, they
 have had successful experiences and have drawn lessons from failures.
 Although the social systems of those nationalist developing countries are
 different from ours, and other socialist developing countries have their
 respective specific conditions, a lot of things about their past and
 present conditions are similar to ours. Therefore, we must earnestly study
 and make use of their experiences, so as to benefit the development of
 China's socialist economy.
 Third World countries are all quite young.  With the exception of a small
 number of newly developed industrial countries and petroleum producing
 countries, the level of their economies is, in general, still comparatively
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 low; people still live in poverty and there are still many difficulties and
 obstructions in the course of their economic development.  They need to
 strengthen economic cooperation on the basis of collective self-reliance
 and take a road that can lead to common prosperity.  China is willing to
 stand together with the people of developing countries in the struggle
 against the exploitation, oppression, control and economic infiltration of
 imperialism, colonialism and hegemonism and against the imperialists'
 monopoly of the world economy.  In doing so, we must devote great efforts
 to intensifying our study of the economies of developing countries so as
 to make clear our needs and capabilities as well as theirs.  In accordance
 with actual conditions and characteristics, we can thereby expand our
 economic relations, develop economic cooperation and jointly strive for a
 common prosperity on a practical, equal and mutually beneficial basis.
 This is one of the basic principles of our foreign policy.   It is our
 unshirkable sacred duty to do a good job in this field.
 The rise of the Third World and the increasingly heightened position of
 developing countries in the world economy are new phenomena arising since
 World War II.  This has posed many new questions in theory and in practice.
 What are the main questions that we should study at this time?  We believe
 that the following are of importance and worth emphasizing:
 1.  The economic control, infiltration and exploitation of developing coun-
 tries by the superpowers and multinational corporations and related
 theories, policies and measures.  Since World War II, along with the dis-
 integration of the colonial system of imperialism, superpowers and inter-
 national monopoly capital have changed their tactics in their attempt to
 pursue neocolonialism.- In particular, as capital has become more and more
 internationalized, multinational corporations have rapidly expanded their
 domain in developing countries.  Using various means and methods,
 imperialists and hegemonists have carried out economic plunder, exploita-
 tion and domination in developing countries.  They have cultivated their
 cohorts, plotted subversion against legal governments in. developing coun-
 tries or even committed aggression against them.  The Soviet hegemonists,
 who call themselves "natural friends" of the Third World, under the pre-'
 tense of "assisting" national liberation movements and carrying out
 "internationalism" and "the international division of labor" also spare no
 effort in infiltrating and controlling developing countries politically,
 economically and militarily, plundering their raw materials, and occupying
 their strategic areas.  They have even sent troops to invade Third World
 countries.  All this is conducted under the cover of a greatly deceptive
 theory and realized by means of extremely sinister tactics and ruthless
 measures.   We must seriously study and thoroughly expose their acts and
 wage a blow-for-blow struggle against them.
 2.  The strategies and different modes of economic development in develop-
 ing countries and their theoretical basis.  In the postwar period,
 developing countries have worked out and carried out various strategies
 for development in line with their respective conditions, thus forming
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 varied modes of development.  In terms of strategy, some practice exporting
 primary products; some practice import substitution, others practice export
 substitution; some give priority to heavy industry, others lay stress on
 the development of light industry and agriculture.  In recent years quite a
 few developing countries, by summing up their past experience in development
 strategies, have embarked on working out and practicing strategies oriented
 to satisfying the basic needs of the people.  These strategies and modes of
 development vary in content.  Each has both advantages and shortcomings.
 In the course of practice, some have promoted economic development; some
 have yielded few benefits; others have even met with great setbacks.  The
 crux of the reasons for the above different results is whether development
 strategies in these countries are derived from a correct guideline and
 whether they are suited to their own specific conditions.  At present, we
 are making a further study of the specific conditions of our country and
 are working out and practicing a strategy for developing our socialist
 economy.  Under these circumstances, it is imperative for us to study the
 conditions, contents, results and theoretical basis of various development
 strategies and modes practiced in developing countries and use them as our
 references.
 3.  The problems of population growth, economic development and pauperiza-
 tion in developing countries.  Since World War II, developing countries
 have achieved certain successes in developing their national economies.
 The average yearly growth rate of their gross national product was 4.71
 percent in the 1950's; 5.6 percent in the 1960's; 5.3 percent in the 1970's;
 higher than the corresponding rates--4.1 percent, 5 percent and 3.1 per-
 cent--of developed Western countries.  In spite of this fact, because of
 their weak economic foundations coupled with a higher population growth rate
 than in developed Western countries, the majority of developing countries
 still lag far behind developed Western countries in terms of gross national
 product per capita.  The gap is becoming even wider.  Calculated at 1950
 constant prices, the per capita GNP of developed countries in 1950 was
 $3,840, while that of developing countries with low incomes was $164.  The
 former was 23 times more than the latter.  In 1980, per capita GNP of
 developed countries increased to $9,684, nearly 40 times that of developing
 countries with low incomes which was only $245.  The difference thus
 increased from $3,676 to $9,439.  It is particularly noteworthy that because
 the population of developing countries grows faster than grain output, many
 of them have changed from grain exporting countries to grain importing coun-
 tries and the degree of self-sufficiency has markedly dropped.  In particu-
 lar, hundreds of millions of people in Sub-Saharan African areas and in
 South Asia are still living in starvation or semistarvation.  Grain has
 become a prominent problem in many developing countries.  This problem not
 only severely affects economic development, but also the stability of the
 political situation.  Therefore, the study and solution of the problems of
 population, grain and pauperization brooks no neglect..
 4.  The economic cooperation between developing countries.  In order to
 fight against control and exploitation by superpowers and international
 monopoly capital and jointly overcome difficulties in the course of their
 economic development, developing countries have displayed the spirit of
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 collective self-reliance and, with solidarity and militancy, have strength-
 ened their economic cooperation.  They have formed many regional cooperation
 organizations and organizations of raw material producing or exporting
 countries, such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Andean
 Group, the Economic Community of West African States, the Organization of
 Petroleum Exporting Countries and so on.  In the struggle in the inter-
 national economic realm, they coordinate their stands and policies and
 fight against exploitation and plunder by imperialism, colonialism and
 hegemonism.  In the course of developing their national economies, they
 coordinate their development plans and strengthen economic cooperation in
 all fields with a spirit of solidarity and mutual aid.  At present, all
 kinds of economic cooperation organizations of developing countries are
 developing vigorously; they have occupied increasingly important positions
 in the realm of international economy.  This shows the strong power of
 developing countries in their economic cooperation with the spirit of
 collective self-reliance.  However, owing to the problems related to
 economy, boundaries, nations and religions left over by the rule of imperial-
 ism and the imbalance in economic development between them, coupled with the
 fact that imperialism and hegemonism are sowing dissension, developing
 countries meet many difficulties and obstructions in the course of develop-
 ing their economic cooperation.                     It is extremely important, therefore, to
 find how developing countries can remove all external interference, frus-
 trate plots to split their ranks and eliminate internal disputes with the
 spirit of setting store by overall interests, seeking common ground on major
 issues while reserving differences on minor ones, and mutual understanding
 and accommodation.  Thus the economic interests of different countries can
 all be taken into account on the basis of equality and mutual benefit and
 the development of economic cooperation between developing countries can get
 further impetus.  This matter calls for our.study from the angles of theory
 and strategy.
 5.  North-South dialogue and the issue of establishing the new international
 economic order.  Although the colonialist system of imperialism has basically
 disintegrated since World War II, the unfair and unequal. old international
 economic order which merely protects the interests of imperialism and inter-
 national monopoly capital still exists.  It has seriously prevented the
 national economies of developing countries from developing smoothly.  In
 order to change this state of affairs, in the postwar period, especially
 since the 1970's, with the Group of 77 as the backbone, developing coun-
 tries have struggled to break the old international economic order.
 Through intense struggle and repeated negotiations, the position of develop-
 ing countries in the United Nations and in other international economic
 organizations and conferences has been raised.  They have also strengthened
 their independent decisionmaking power as regards limiting activities of
 foreign monopoly capital and multinational corporations.  In negotiations
 and conferences, they have, with developed countries, reached some agreements
 which are beneficial to developing countries, and have gained some substan-
 tial benefits in overcoming their economic difficulties.                      These facts show
 that developing countries have become a major force in the international
 struggle of anti-imperialism, anticolonialism and antihegemonism and the
 struggle to establish a comparatively fair and reasonable new international

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 economic order.  North-South dialogue, however, has made only slow progress
 because most of the developed Western countries adopt dilatory tactics and
 the Soviet Union refuses to recognize its duty.  At present, gaining a clear
 idea of the standpoints, tactics and policies of the superpowers and
 developed capitalist countries in North-South dialogue, particularly find-
 ing methods to strengthen the internal unity of developing countries, work-
 ing out a correct strategy and tactics in accordance with scientific guide-
 lines which tally with realities, waging struggle in a reasonable, profit-
 able and methodical way and making unremitting efforts to establish a new
 international economic order have become very important tasks of developing
 countries.  Chinese people are, of course, willing to make the due efforts
 in this regard.
 What are the basic principles guiding us in studying the above important
 questions?
 First, after collecting a large quantity of reliable information, we must
 apply Marxist standpoints, basic viewpoints and methods in conducting
 intensive and thorough analysis and study from the high plain of theory
 and strategy in a realistic manner and by means of dividing one into two,
 so as to correctly realize the historic position and basic conditions of
 developing countries.  We should also sum up their experiences and draw
 lessons from the course of their national economic development and go
 deeply to learn the laws governing their national economic development.
 Marxist classical authors have made a host of profound expositions on the
 economies of colonial and semicolonial countries in the light of the
 historic conditions of their time.  For example, Marx has expounded on the
 plunder and exploitation of colonial and semicolonial countries by
 colonialism; Lenin put forward the theory on national liberation movements
 in colonial and semicolonial countries and national economic development
 after their political independence.  Comrade Mao Zedong enumerated the
 theory on the division into three worlds and, taking China as a typical
 example, he explained that the bourgeoisie in colonial and semicolonial
 countries can be divided into-the comprador bourgeoisie and the national
 bourgeoisie and also noted the duality of the national bourgeoisie and the
 essential importance of the peasant problem in these countries.  All these
 are of great guiding significance in our study of the national democratic
 revolution and the development of the national economy in the broad develop-
 ing countries.  Many of these viewpoints are still our major theoretical
 basis in analyzing the economies of developing countries.  Of course, since
 World War II things have changed greatly.  We cannot rigidly adhere to a
 few prepared conclusions.  Instead, we should base ourselves on the new
 conditions, study new problems and draw new conclusions, creatively develop-
 ing scientific theories to guide our acts.                 We should, therefore, on the
 one hand oppose the dogmatist method which does not proceed from realities
 but merely looks for conclusions from books and, on the other hand, oppose
 the erroneous attitude that varies from Marxist basic theory and totally
 and uncriti.cally accepts the bourgeois theory.  At present, the most

 important thing for us is to widely and intensively absorb knowledge of the
 past and present economies of developing countries, collect detailed mate-
 rial and make an analysis by means of discarding the dross and selecting
 the essential, eliminating the false and retaining the true, proceeding
 from the outside to the inside, and proceeding from one to the other, so
 as to discover the nature of things and draw scientific conclusions in the
 unity of history and logic.
 Second, we must earnestly acquaint ourselves with foreign theories and
 methodology on the economic development of developing countries.  Since
 former colonies and dependencies won political independence one after
 another, Western bourgeois economists have intensified their study of the
 economies of developing countries in order to protect the colonial inter-
 ests of imperialism in these countries and regions.  In accordance with
 Keynesian theory, they have laid emphasis on the key function of state
 intervention and expanding demand.   They peddle to developing countries
 the "models" of economic development designed by them, the most famous
 among these being the "Harrod-Domar model."  It should be pointed out that
 some of their methods in analysis are indeed worth taking as our refer-
 ences.  In general, however, these theories do not tally with the realities
 in developing countries.  Some are even designed for the exploitation and
 plunder of developing countries.  For example, the theory of "equilibrium
 of international demand" put forward by Western scholars deems that trade
 between developed countries and developing countries is conducted on the
 basis of exchange of equal value without exploitation.  Progressive
 scholars in developing countries have criticized this theory.  This criti-
 cism contains many reasonable factors which are worth our serious consid-
 eration.  But some people in developing countries put forward a theory of
 "center and margin" in which developed capitalist countries are taken as
 the "center" of the world, while developing countries are only viewed as
 the "margin" which.has no inner impetus and can only seek development by
 attaching itself to the "center."  This theory is wrong in both system and
 methodology.  If the economies of developing countries have to circle the
 "center"--developed capitalist countries--then they will, never shake off
 their economically dependent position.  Some other people go to another
 extreme by advocating "severing all relations with Western countries."
 Both these theories go against the general tendency of contemporary economic
 development.  Thus, both are harmful.
 The "theories" mentioned above influenced policymaking of the governments
 of developing countries to varying degrees.  Many developing countries have
 worked out their respective development strategies and policies under the
 guidance of this or that theory.  Some have achieved a certain success and
 promoted their economic development; others have met with setbacks and
 failures and got their national economies into trouble.  In some countries
 where the economy has developed at a fairly high speed comes another prob-
 lem--aggravating polarization and sharpening social contradictions.
 Therefore, it is necessary to concretely analyze foreign theories and
 methodology on economic development..  We should assimilate whatever is
 reasonable and, with the spirit of seeking truth, point out what is wrong

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100310001-3
 and why it is wrong.  We should also seriously criticize what is reactionary.
 Each school of foreign "development theories," and each part of the develop-
 ment theories in developing countries together with its methodology should be
 taken seriously.  We should gain a clear idea of its origin and development,
 content and essence.  Only thus can we correctly study the strategies and
 modes of developing countries in developing their economies and absorb
 valuable scientific elements, so as to speed up the economic construction of
 our country.
 Our research on the economies of developing countries has just begun.  We
 need to mobilize the cadres who are concerned with foreign economies and
 trade and the comrades who are concerned with researching and teaching of
 world economy throughout the country to coordinate in collecting and sorting
 out materials and in carrying out thorough specialized study in a planned
 and organized way.  Comrades who handle actual foreign economic work should
 strengthen their theoretical study and exploration, while comrades who are
 engaged in theoretical work should pay more attention to actual economic
 work.  Only thus can one learn from others' strong points to offset one's
 weaknesses and closely combine theory with practice.  At the same time,
 when possible, we should strengthen academic exchanges with foreign
 scholars, particularly progressive scholars of the Third World, in a planned
 way, so as to benefit our research on the economies of developing countries.

 AN IMPORTANT REFORM IN THE SUPREME STATE ADMINISTRATIVE ORGANS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82 pp 23-26
 [Article by Xu Chongde [6079 1504 1795]]
 [Text] The State Council of the PRC, or the central people's government, by
 means of exercising its supreme administrative power, handles our country's
 major domestic and foreign affairs and realizes the state. function of the
 people's democratic dictatorship.  The work of the State Council is directly
 related to the success or failure of our country's socialist modernization.
 Thus, the reform and perfection of the administrative system of the State
 Council is of far-reaching significance.
 There are only three articles under the section "The State Council" in the
 present constitution, which was adopted in 1978.  However, they have been
 increased to nine in the draft of the revised constitution (referred to below
 as the draft) after being revised, adapted and redrafted.  The content is
 more substantial than the present constitution and represents a new develop-
 ment.  Regarding the nature and status of the State Council:  It is the
 executive organ of the highest organ of state power and is the supreme state
 administrative organ.  This basic point was determined when our country's
 first socialist constitution was promulgated in 1954.  The later two consti-
 tutions were formulated on the basis of the first one.  The objective of this
 revision is to more perfectly display the above-mentioned nature of the
 State Council and further strengthen its status and give play to its role.
 This kind of revision on the one hand reflects the continuity of our coun-
 try's constitutions and on the other hand shows the vitality of our country's
 organs of power, which are incessantly developing and perfecting.
 Based on the original constitution, the draft has made great changes, mainly
 regarding:  1) the organization of the State Council; 2) the leadership
 system of the State Council itself; 3) the tenure of office of the State
 Council leading personnel; 4) the power and function of the State Council;
 5) the establishment of an auditing organ.  In addition, since the State
 Council is the organic constituent of the whole country's structure, the
 series of reforms of other organs, such as the enlargement of the function
 and power of the NPC and, in particular, the Standing Committee of the NPC,
 the restoration of the PRC chairman, the establishment of the Central
 Military Commission, and so on, will definitely exert certain influence on

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 the structure and activities of the State Council.  In short, the draft has
 reflected the reforms of the State Council in many ways and cannot be dis-
 cussed in detail in this article.  Let me give my view on several questions.
 The change of the structure of the State Council proposed in the draft is a
 summation of experiences.over a long time in the past and is also a reflec-
 tion and affirmation of the results of the reforms in the structure of the
 State Council which are being carried out at present.  The structure of the
 country's highest administrative organs has undergone three stages of
 development.
 The first stage was the government administration council of 1949-54, which
 was a committee system.  The council consisted of one premier, several vice
 premiers, a secretary general and several administrative councillors.
 Administrative councillors could hold concurrent posts as directors of
 council commissions or ministers, who were not necessarily administrative
 councillors.  That is to say, the directors of council commissions or
 ministers were not necessarily members of the administration council.  Such
 a regulation was made at that time because the administration council had
 30 subordinate ministries, committees, councils, departments and administra-
 tive offices.  Besides the administrative councillors who did not belong to
 any ministries, if all the ministers and directors were administrative
 councillors, there would be too many administrative councillors.  Thus, it
 would be more difficult to conduct administration council meetings.  The
 structure.and work methods of the administration council have provided
 valuable experience for the reform of the leadership system of the present
 State Council, the appointment of state councillors and the establishment
 of a standing committee of the State Council which consists of a premier,
 vice premiers, state councillors and a secretary general.
 The second stage was a system stipulated in the 1954 constitution.  Under
 this system, the State Council consisted of a premier, several vice
 premiers, all ministers, directors of all commissions and a secretary
 .general.  This system lasted the longest.  There have not been any changes
 except that the secretary general was deleted from being a member of the
 State Council in the 1975 and 1978 constitutions.  It was different from the
 structure of the administration council in that there were no committee mem-
 bers holding either concurrent posts as ministers or ministers without
 portfolio; and all ministers and directors of commissions were without
 exception members of the State Council.  Therefore, we called this an
 organizational form of ministerial meeting.  The advantages of this system
 were that all ministers of the State Council and directors of all commis-
 sions were members of the plenary meetings of the State Council.  They could
 participate in the critical discussions of matters of overall importance
 under the charge of the State Council.  Such a form, in principle, is still
 kept by the current draft of the revised constitution.
 The structure of the State Council stipulated in this draft of the constitu-
 tion is the third stage of the development of our country's highest adminis-
 trative organs.  Looking at Article 86 of the draft--on members of the State
 Council--it is different from both the administration council and the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 original State Council.  It is based on the two kinds of structures which
 have been practiced by the country's highest administrative organs since
 the founding of the country and has absorbed their strong points.  It is
 also a development of the former structure.  In accordance with the stipu-
 lation of the draft, the leadership system of the State Council itself after
 being reformed is called the premier responsibility system.  This system is
 a form of what we usually refer to as a directors responsibility system.
 Its main characteristics are:
 First, the number of vice premiers is reduced to the minimum, appointing
 state councillors so that the leadership system is more centralized.  The
 draft explicitly points out:  "The premier directs the work: of the State
 Council.  The vice premiers and state councillors assist the premier in his
 work."  This shows that the premier holds the dominant post: in the leader-
 ship system of the State Council although the State Council. is under collec-
 tive leadership.  The vice premiers and the state councillors are assistants
 of the..premier.  The state councillors are entrusted by the: premier to be
 in charge of certain work and certain major tasks.  They are also entrusted
 by the premier to carry out important foreign activities.
 Second, the draft stipulates that "the premier calls and presides over the
 regular meetings and the plenary meetings of the State Council."  This kind
 of meeting is different from that of other organs which practice the
 collegiate system of work procedure and method of making decisions.  The
 status of each member of the organs which practice the collegiate system is
 fundamentally equal.  While making decisions, each member has the same right
 to vote.  But it is different in the premier responsibility system.  The
 premier not only has the power to call and preside over the regular meetings
 and plenary meetings of the State Council, but also has the power to gather
 correct opinions and make the decision of the State Council during the meet-
 ings in which major problems are discussed fully by all members.
 Third, the draft stipulates.that the premier is to be appointed by the
 chairman of the People's Republic of China.  The chairman appoints the
 premier with the approval of the NPC.  In the past, people have not paid
 much attention to the significance of such procedures.  As a matter of fact,
 .the chairman is the symbol and representative of the state.  Therefore, the
 premier actually receives the mandate from the state.  He is to represent
 the interests of the people in organizing the government and in bearing the
 responsibility of managing state affairs and leading the highest administra-
 tive organ.  In the future, after the restoration of the post of chairman of
 the PRC, this solemn legal procedure of appointing the premier will also be
 restored and the responsibilities of the premier will be made more explicit.
 On the other hand, the premier has the right to propose to the highest organ
 of state power the appointment of State Council vice premiers, state council-
 lors, ministers, directors of various commissions, the chief auditor and the
 secretary general.  When he thinks necessary, the premier also has the power
 to propose to the highest organ of state power the dismissal of the func-
 tion and power of these people.   In light of this, we see that the adminis-
 trative responsibilities of all people involved are clearly laid down.

 minister or director responsibility system."  Now that the number of deputy
 positions and vacant positions is reduced, the personal responsibility of
 the department heads will become greater in actual work.
 Among the various subordinate departments of the State Council, there is the
 establishment of the auditing organ which is to independently exercise the
 power of auditing and supervision under the leadership of the chief auditor.
 This is a new characteristic of the draft on reform of the administrative
 organs.  By means of supervising the accounting procedures and the qualifi-
 cations of the auditors themselves, the auditing organ exercises overall
 supervision over financial and economic activities.  Therefore, the auditing
 department should be separated from the department of financial accounting
 in modern economic management.  The objective of auditing supervision is to
 ensure that the state's capital is more rationally and legally gathered and
 utilized and that it brings better economic benefits.  It also helps to
 strictly enforce financial discipline and prevents possible flaws that may
 occur in the state's financial and economic activities and is thus conducive
 to the socialist modernization drive.
 Since ours is a vast country with a dense population, there are several
 hundreds of thousands of enterprises and an enormous number of work units
 and administrative organs, and it is necessary to practically protect the
 state's huge capital and property.  For many years in the past, because  .  .
 there was neither a perfect legal system nor a complete auditing system or
 an organ in charge of auditing supervision, unsavory trends appeared in the
 area of financial and economic management.  There was also malpractice which
 made serious inroads on the state's property.  Thus, it is extremely neces-
 sary to perfect the auditing system and set up an independent organ in
 charge of auditing supervision.  In the wake of the development of socialist
 construction, and in the wake of the expansion of thedecisionmaking rights
 in the localities, departments and enterprises and the adoption of open
 economic policies, new contradictions crop up incessantly, and thus the
 demand for the establishment of an organ in charge of auditing supervision
 has become more urgent.  The draft stipulated:  "The State Council will
 establish auditing organs to audit and supervise finance and the financial
 revenue and expenditure of the people's government at all levels and of the
 financial and monetary organizations, enterprises, institutions and organi-
 zations under the people's government."  This complies with the demand of
 China's financial and economic management and the building of the four
 modernizations.
 In order to continue to make the best possible use of the State Council.and
 bring the'role of the highest administrative organ into full play, the draft
 has, to a certain extent, expanded the authority of the State Council.   One
 relatively important item is that the State Council has the authority to
 stipulate and approve administrative laws and regulations.  The State Coun-
 cil is the executive organ of the highest organ of state power.  In the
 course of carrying out laws and decrees, the State Council must make
 administrative strategic decisions and promulgate regulatory documents in
 accordance with the actual complicated situations.  This is called adminis-
 trative laws and regulations.  This is the first concept stipulated in the
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100310001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 draft on China's administrative laws and regulations.  In our actual life,
 the administrative laws and regulations deal with a wide range of things.
 According to the stipulation of the draft, the State Council has the
 authority to use the administrative laws and regulations to define the
 obligations and duties of all ministries and commissions.  This shows that
 the authority of the State Council has expanded.
 As a matter of fact, that the State Council has the authority to stipulate
 and approve administrative laws and regulations does not mean that the State
 Council has legislative power, nor does it mean that the State Council is a
 legislative body.  Although determined by the nature and characteristic of
 the administrative power, in actuality, there are many more administrative
 laws and regulations than laws and decrees.  However, administrative laws
 and regulations are after all different in principle from laws and decrees.
 First, laws and decrees are stipulated by the highest-organ of state power.
 In China, only the NPC and its Standing Committee, which are state.legisla-
 tive organs, can exercise state legislative power.  Moreover, administrative
 laws and regulations are but administrative regulations promulgated by the
 State Council in the course of implementing the law so that the law will be
 carried out smoothly.  Second, from the point of view of what binds and
 compels, although administrative laws and regulations are almost similar to
 laws and decrees, administrative laws and regulations. must abide by laws
 and decrees and must not contravene the law.  If there is any contradiction,
 the NPC Standing Committee can change and repeal the administrative laws
 and regulations.   The difference between administrative laws and regula-
 tions and laws and decrees is manifested in the subordinate nature of the
 State Council to the highest organ of state power.   In China, democratic
 centralism and the system of "integrating discussions with action" are the
 basic principles of the socialist political.. system.  Even though this is
 the fact, the draft has, for the first time, defined the status of adminis-
 trative laws and regulations in the constitution.  We cannot deny that this
 is an important feature.
 The reform of China's highest administrative organ manifested in the draft
 of the revised constitution is very important.  We can predict that the
 working system of China's government will continue to improve and its effi-
 ciency will be greatly enhanced.  This will certainly perfect and strengthen
 the organization and leadership of the socialist modernization.

 CHERISH THE MOTHERLAND'S HONOR, SAFEGUARD NATIONAL DIGNITY
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82 pp 27-30
 [Article by Wang Bingnan [3769 3521 0589]]
 [Text] Cherishing the honor of the motherland and safeguarding national
 dignity is a sacred duty of every Chinese.  In "The Draft of the Revised
 PRC;Constitution," it is written:  "The citizens of the PRC have the obli-
 gation to safeguard the motherland's safety, honor and interests.  They
 must not do anything that harms the safety, honor and interest of the
 motherland."  It is of great significance at present that we strengthen
 education of the cadres and masses in this aspect.
 Over the past few years, by adhering to the principle of maintaining inde-
 pendence and keeping initiative in our own hands, and reconstructing our
 motherland through self-reliance, we have implemented the open-door policy
 and scored positive results in promoting the building of the four moderni-
 zations and enhancing mutual understanding and friendship with people of
 other countries.  In our ever increasing contacts with foreign countries,
 many of our cadres and masses have displayed the lofty style of associating
 their words and actions with safeguarding the honor of the motherland and
 the dignity of the nation, and there have been many lively and stirring
 deeds to win the acclaim of foreign friends.  On the other hand, some
 unhealthy phenomena have also appeared--some have done such things as
 worshipping things foreign and toadying to foreign people, bowing and
 scraping, forfeiting their self-respect and losing their personality and
 national character.  These people have no sense of decency.  By dis-
 crediting the honor of the motherland and hurting the dignity of the
 Chinese people, they have not only aroused the indignation of the broad
 masses of people within the country, but they have also deeply disturbed
 many international friends, patriotic Overseas Chinese and Hong Kong and
 Macao compatriots as well as having aroused their extreme concern.
 Although these phenomena have only appeared among a small handful of
 people, they exert a very bad influence.  If we let them run rampant and
 do not strengthen political and ideological education and take effective
 measures, the body of our party and country will be seriously corroded and
 the modernization program will be endangered.

 There are social and historical reasons for phenomena such as worshipping
 things foreign and toadying to foreign people.  First of all, China
 experienced a semifeudal and semicolonial society for more than a century
 and some people have not yet got rid of their capitalist ideology and the
 colonial slave mentality.  Second, the 10 years' internal disorder of the
 "Great Cultural Revolution" seriously damaged the fine traditional ideology
 and work style of our party.  The patriotic sentiments, moral concepts and
 sense of discipline of many people become blunted to the extent that some
 even completely ignore them.  Furthermore, since putting the open-door
 policy into effect, we have underestimated the corrosion caused by corrupt
 bourgeois ideology and ideological and political work have lagged behind.
 And the precautionary measures are imperfect.  For these reasons, when they
 confront the dazzling bourgeois human world with its myriad temptations
 some irresolute youths without experience in life cannot resist being
 corroded by corrupt bourgeois ideology and, as a result, they are shot by
 "sugar-coated bullets" and fall captive to bourgeois ideology.  Therefore,
 to overcome the ideology and acts of worshipping things foreign and toady-
 ing to foreign people, we must educate the people, particularly the youth,
 to correctly understand the motherland and our obligations and responsi-
 bilities toward our motherland and foster a high degree of national pride
 and confidence.
 Our country is a great country and our nation is a great nation.  Ours is
 a country with a vast territory; our mountains and rivers are magnificent;
 our products are abundant and we have a long history.  Generation after
 generation, the children of China have been living, working and struggling
 in this land and we have created a magnificent national culture.  For a
 considerably long period of history, China's science and technology ranked
 among the first in the world and we made great contributions to the develop-
 ment of human society.  According to the statistics of Joseph Needham, the
 British scholar and author of "History of China's Science and Technology,"
 more than 30 important Chinese inventions were spread to Europe and other
 regions of the world from the opening of the Silk Road to the end of the
 18th century.  As Chinese, we should feel greatly honored.  The Chinese
 nation is not only famous for diligence and intelligence, but also for its
 patriotic spirit and revolutionary tradition.  Over thousands of years,
 many national heroes and patriots who were "impervious to the temptation
 of wealth and high position, not to be shaken or modified by poverty or
 destitution, and did not succumb to military force" have emerged to safe-
 guard the nation's honor and dignity.                        Particularly in modern Chinese
 history, national heroes and patriots are as bright and abundant as the
 stars.  After Western capitalist countries blasted open China's gate with
 their cannons in the Opium War, foreign colonialists colluded with the
 Chinese feudal ruling class and willfully trampled on China.  As a result,
 China was in an abyss of misery for a long time.  However, the people of all
 nationalities in China never surrendered and they resisted foreign invasions
 many times.  There are many heroic and moving deeds.  People like Lin Zexu,
 Hong Xiuquan, Kang Youwei, Tan Sitong and Sun Yat-sen were outstanding
 representatives of the Chinese people during this period.  It is exactly
 because the Chinese people indomitably advanced wave upon wave to resist
 invasion that, although large and small imperialist countries of the world

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 united to invade and suppress China, they could not destroy China.  Since
 the birth of the CCP, under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, the glorious
 patriotic tradition of the Chinese people has been further inherited and
 brought forth.  The CCP led the Chinese people to wage some extremely
 arduous struggles and finally overthrew the three big mountains and won
 national independence and liberation.  Since then, the Chinese people have
 controlled the national power, become the masters of their country and
 resolutely followed the socialist path.  This is the fortune, glory and
 honor of the Chinese nation.  Thousands and millions of Overseas Chinese
 rejoice that the long period during which they were squeezed out and dis-
 criminated against is now over.
 Since the founding of the P RC some 30 years ago, although our country has
 made mistakes and suffered setbacks, we have scored significant results in
 economic construction.  This is obvious to all and is universally
 acknowledged.  When new China was first established, we inherited from old
 China a country in a complete shambles.  The industrial base was very weak,
 the equipment and installations were obsolete, the technology was backward
 and the level of productive forces was extremely low.  However, after 30
 years' arduous struggles, the Chinese people have brought about profound
 changes in various aspects.  Basically, we have an independent and rela-
 tiv~ly complete socialist industrial system and national economic system.
 We could not manufacture accurate or large-sized machine tools just after
 liberation, but now we are able to manufacture 270 varieties of relatively
 complete machine tools.  We are not only capable of manufacturing automo-
 biles and airplanes, but also atomic bombs, guided missiles and manmade
 satellites.  Agriculture in our country has also made relatively great
 progress and we have basically solved the problem of feeding our 1 billion
 population.  On the basis of the continuous development of industrial and
 agricultural production, there has been a significant improvement in the
 people's material and cultural life.   Comparing China's standard of
 economic development with other developed countries, ours is still rela-
 tively backward.  However,. when compared with old China or other foreign
 countries, the rate of economic development over the past 30 years is
 relatively fast. The socialist system is not only superior to the semi-
 feudal and semicolonial society, but also to modern capitalist society.
 This has been proven by evidence.  Since the 3d Plenary Session of the
 11th CCP Central Committee, we have summed up the positive and negative
 experiences and proposed a new path for the building of socialism that suits
 the actual situation of our country.  There is no doubt that the superiority
 of China's socialist system will be effectively brought into full play.
 At present, our motherland has obtained its proper place in the world.  The
 age when foreigners treated the Chinese as.  the sick man of East Asia" and
 "an inferior nation" is long gone.  In our contact with people of other
 countries, we hold high the banner of opposing imperialism and hegemonism
 and safeguarding world peace; we adhere to proletarian internationalism,

 countries and we have friends all over the world.  The Chinese People's
 Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries has nongovernmental
 contacts with some 120 countries and has established friendly relations
 and connections with some 100 Chinese friendship associations from some 60
 countries. In our nongovernmental friendly contacts with the people of
 other countries, we deeply feel their sincerity toward the Chinese people.
 They pin great hopes on China and try their best to cherish and safeguard
 China's international reputation.  They are distressed that some people
 worship things foreign and toady to foreign people.  Many foreign friends
 treat China as their second homeland.  Some friends want. to make a final
 trip to China even though they are very old; some sacrificed their precious
 lives for the Chinese revolutionary cause and for friendship with the
 Chinese people; and others had deep love for China during their lifetime
 and wanted to have their bones or ashes laid to rest in China.  Many
 Chinese friendship associations in foreign countries have overcome diffi-
 culties regarding manpower, material and financial resources and launched
 various activities to introduce China to their own country and to promote
 mutual understanding and friendship with the Chinese pecple.   How inspiring
 and exciting this is!  Compare it with those people who have lost their
 national pride and who damage national honor and dignity.  Do they not feel
 ashamed of themselves?
 People usually compare their motherland to their mother.   This is a sacred
 and solemn metaphor, and it vividly shows us the lofty status and great
 significance which is due the motherland in our minds.  Through the ages,
 no one with a conscience would allow others to infringe upon the dignity
 of his mother, and no one with high aspirations would use words and deeds
 to bring disgrace on the reputation of his mother.  People compare their
 motherland to their mother, that is to say, all. people should ardently
 love their motherland as they ardently love their mothers.  They should
 take safeguarding the honor and dignity of the motherland as their sacred
 duty and winning glory for the motherland as their solemn obligation.  We
 are all raised with the milk of the motherland.  Without: the motherland,
 we would have nothing.  In the poem "Singing for the Motherland," Martyr
 Chen Hui wrote:  "0 motherland, you raise me with your milk of love; and I
 will safeguard you with my flesh and blood," and Martyr Chen carried out his
 pledge.  This is a model that we should always follow.
 As a matter of fact, our motherland is still rather poor at present.  This
 is a fact that we will not deny.  However, how should we tackle poverty in
 our motherland?  This is a question that tests our ideology and our sense
 of values.  Can we reject the motherland because she is poor?  Can we beg
 from foreign people?  This is definitely not the proper attitude for a
 loyal Chinese.  Although the conditions of material life in developed
 capitalist countries are better than ours, there is an insurmountable dark
 side of things and there are incurable social evils.  Bourgeois society is
 a society of exploitation of man by man.  Unemployment, drugs, robbery,
 murders...emerge one after another in capitalist countries.  Many people
 have no ideals or convictions and lead lives devoid of meaning.  It is
 exactly like a foreign friend said:  Having money does not mean having
 happiness.   The United States is one of the richest countries in the world;

 however, many people dare not step out of their doors at night and muggings
 are not uncommon during the day.  Although China is still relatively poor
 today, because of the establishment of the socialist political system and
 economic system, the people have a common ideal, common morality and common
 discipline and there is stability and unity in public order.  This is some-
 thing beyond comparison with any capitalist country.  Our forefathers said:
 "Poverty cannot stifle one's lofty ideals."  This is the glorious tradition
 of the Chinese people.  The modern writer and professor Zhu Ziging'was very
 ill in 1948; however, he preferred to die of starvation than take food
 handed out in contempt.  He refused to take any U.S. "relief grain."  This
 illustrates the integrity of the Chinese people. Comrade Mao Zedong highly
 praised him and proposed "writing a eulogy for Zhu Ziqing."  Thus the
 poverty of the motherland should not shake our pure hearts but should become
 a powerful motivating force inspiring us to work hard for the prosperity of
 the country.  A specialist, who has rejected the superior living conditions
 in a foreign land and returned to China to take part in the socialist con-
 struction of the motherland, said:  "The magnificent mansions and houses of
 others are not as good as our own humble houses. We must build our own
 magnificent mansions for the Chinese people."  These words are very well
 spoken!  They reflect the deep love of the Chinese people for their mother-
 land as well as their aspiration to build up China.  Every Chinese, espe-
 cially the young people, should take these words as his motto.
 A man should have his moral integrity and a country should have its spirit.
 The key to whether or not we can gain the respect of foreigners in our con-
 tacts with them lies in whether or not we can safeguard our own moral
 integrity and the spirit of our country.  As the saying goes, people will
 respect you if you conduct yourself with dignity and people will have a low
 opinion of you if you have a low opinion of yourself.   If we have self-
 respect, we will certainly win the respect of the honest foreigners.  On
 the contrary, if we lose our integrity and the spirit of our country, as
 some people do, and assume an air of complacency and servility, then
 foreigners will look down on us.  In having contacts with foreign friends,
 we ought to stress civility and courtesy and be friendly.
 On the eve of winning the national revolution, Comrade Mao Zedong exhorted
 us to heighten our vigilance against the attack of bourgeois "sugar-coated
 bullets."  Since then, he has taught us many times to combat Jia Gui's
 ideology.and work style and enhance our national self-respect and self-
 confidence.  Comrade Zhou Enlai also repeatedly taught us in dealing with
 foreign friends to abstain from great-nation chauvinism on the one hand,
 and to be neither overbearing nor servile on the other.  We must "build up
 our integrity and confidence."  Many workers, peasants, workers involved
 with foreign affairs, scientists and technicians, students studying abroad,
 actors and actresses and sportsmen have adhered to the teaching of Comrades
 Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai.  Whether in having contacts with foreign friends
 at home or abroad, or during working, investigating, studying, competing and
 performing abroad, they have tried very hard to make their words and deeds
 comply with the demand of safeguarding the motherland's honor and national
 dignity, and there have been many stirring deeds.  This has inspired and
 encouraged the people of the whole country.  When Wei Yu, a lecturer from

 Nanjing Technical College who was awarded a doctorate by a technical college
 in West Germany, was studying in West Germany, she was wholly absorbed in
 her studies and led a very hard life.  When people asked her why, she
 replied:  "Foreigners always appraise the Chinese social system, education
 system and women's liberation by evaluating. every individual Chinese.  I
 must not let them down in my words and deeds."  China's woman scientist
 She Baoguang effected a breakthrough in the study of hepatitis B vaccine
 during her advanced studies in the United States.  However, she declined
 an offer of a high salary in the United States and resolutely returned to
 the motherland.  "I want to work for the well-being of the people in the
 motherland."  These are indeed lofty patriotic sentiments and awareness!
 In international competitions, the sportsmen of our country struggle for
 the honor of the motherland.  Therefore, when they score outstanding results
 and when the five-star red flag is slowly hoisted on the playing field,
 people burn with righteous feelings and are moved to tears.  The mother-
 land's honor and the national dignity affect the sentiments of thousands
 and millions of Chinese because they have a mutual affinity and are closely
 linked with each other.  History and evidence have proved that being Chinese
 is an honor of which we should be proud.  No matter what the circumstances,
 we must never forget that we are Chinese, members of the great Chinese
 nation.  Our words and deeds must comply with the spirit of our country and
 our moral integrity, and we must never do anything to harm the interest and
 image of the socialist motherland.  This is the rudimentary and basic moral
 character that we should have.
 The CCP Central Committee called on us to strengthen the building of social-
 ist spiritual civilization while strengthening the building of socialist
 material civilization, so that the people of all nationalities in our
 country will become people with ideals and moral character, disciplined and
 well educated.  Safeguarding the honor and national dignity of the mother-
 land is an essential substance and demand of the building of socialist
 spiritual civilization.  Every one of us must take practical actions to
 implement this demand.   We believe that if we strengthen ideological and.
 political education, if the leading cadres at all levels. and the party
 members set an example for others to follow and if we seriously deal with
 the small number of people who violate party discipline and laws, the
 patriotism and internationalism of the people in our country will certainly
 be brought into full play.  We will be able to overcome the unhealthy trends
 existing in foreign affairs, and thus the open-door policy will be imple-
 mented in a healthier way and we will score better results.

 TRANSPORT WORKERS SHOULD STRIVE TO BECOME VANGUARDS IN PROPAGATING SOCIALIST
 SPIRITUAL CIVILIZATION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82 pp 31-33
 [Article by Pan Qi [3382 3825]]
 [Text] In the past few years, I have taken every opportunity to go to many
 places in Shandong, Liaoning, Zhejiang, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Guangdong and
 Beijing.  Recently I have been to Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hubei and Anhui.  I went
 from place to place to visit bus stations.  Occasionally, I took a long-
 distance bus.  Through direct contact with passengers, bus drivers, con-
 ductors and bus station personnel, I have come to know much about the
 situation and have heard various opinions.  I have a strong impression:
 There are many problems in the present bus transport work but the most
 pressing problem to be solved is how to successfully carry out the building
 of socialist spiritual civilization.
 Not long ago, Comrade Hu Yaobang pointed out:  "Bus  transport corps and
 bus drivers work in a decentralized manner.  They are so decentralized that
 they are not easy to supervise.  If we can handle them well, they will
 become a very good force that can propagate socialist spiritual civiliza-
 tion.              If we cannot handle them well, they will propagate bourgeois pesti-
 lences and evil trends."                      Therefore we must first straighten out the mood of
 bus transport corps and bus drivers.  He also pointed out:  "Keeping to the
 positions of the party, the state and the people, we must set strict demands
 on them, explain to them the character and style appropriate to bus trans-
 port corps and bus drivers of a socialist 'country and require them to
 change their mood."  Cadres, party members and YCL members should play
 their exemplary vanguard role and strive to become vanguards in propagating
 socialist spiritual civilization.  Comrade Hu Yaobang further said:  "The
 problem now is that the higher the ranking of an institution, the more
 unable it is to do ideological work.  Such institutions are unable to do
 big jobs and then look down on small ones.  They do not know-how to do
 political and ideological work among the staff and workers on this front.".
 He requires that we not only call for action, but also go into selected
 units, work with the workers for a specified period of time, maintain close
 contacts with the masses, set a good example, play an exemplary vanguard
 role and carry out criticism and self-criticism.  He also requires us to pay
 attention to the livelihood of the staff and workers.

 Comrade Hu Yaobang's opinions are quite correct and very important to bus
 transport personnel.  He has pointed out a general aim for all comrades
 doing bus transport work:  Be vanguards in propagating socialist spiritual
 civilization.  Bus transport has the characteristics of being mobile and
 decentralized, of operating independently, of going into the depths of
 the cities and towns and of maintaining close ties with the broad masses.
 The style of bus transport personnel not only affects the production and
 livelihood of the people, but also makes-a great impact on the mood of
 society.  In recent years, the attitude and. quality of service of the
 majority of bus drivers and bus station personnel have improved, and they
 are energetically propagating socialist civilization.  But a certain num-
 ber of bus stations and bus transport corps still have many problems, some
 of which are very serious.  They are still far from the general aim of being
 vanguards in propagating socialist spiritual civilization.
 On 1 December last year, I witnessed the situation which was described by a
 passenger who had written the following in the complaints book of a bus
 station:
 "On my way to your bus station, I saw your bus stations along the way had
 something in common, whichI will summarize in the following four
 sentences:
 "1.  Dirty--There is rubbish in and around the bus stations.  It is
 unsightly.
 "2.  Disordered--Passengers do not buy tickets in an orderly manner.  They
 do not queue up to board a bus, nor do they get off a bus and leave the
 station in an orderly manner.
 "3.  Bad--The working personnel are not responsible enough.  They do not
 call the numbers of the buses.  Once some passengers asked a station
 attendant when the next bus would arrive.  He did not know that a bus had
 arrived.
 "4.  Unhealthy trends--Unhealthy trends are rampant.  Acquaintances may go
 first without taking a number or queueing up.  Passengers from other places
 have to wait longer even if their turn has come."
 This passenger's opinion reflects the common characteristics of many bus
 stations.  It also represents the opinions of the majority of passengers.
 The seriousness of this problem is evidence that many comrades in communi-
 cations departments turn a blind eye and deaf ear and are apathetic to the
 above phenomenon.  Some comrades "are not itchy even though their bodies are
 full of lice," and "are not worried even though they are debt-ridden."  They
 do not care what happens.  Some run away from trouble, cannot exert them-
 selves, do not have enough faith in themselves and give up their posts.
 How can they become vanguards in propagating socialist spiritual civiliza-
 tion unless this spiritual phenomenon is changed?!

 In 1980 and 1981, I went to Yentai in Shandong Province and Changshu in
 Jiangsu Province to visit two bus stations which had long been cited as
 Daqing-type enterprises.  I particularly read all the opinions written in
 the complaint books by their passengers.  Really, it was not unique but
 had its counterpart.  Passengers' opinions about these two bus stations
 were so similar and serious.  It was really astonishing!  Most of the
 passengers' opinions about the bus station.in Yentai were directed at the
 station's ticket sellers and working personnel who performed their duties
 very badly and abominably.  There were even three cases of hitting and
 abusing passengers.   Most of the passengers' opinions about the bus station
 in Changshu were also directed at the station's working personnel who per-
 formed their duties very badly and abominably.  There were three cases of
 creating difficulties for passengers and of quarreling with passengers.  A
 passenger wrote:  "Let me ask:  Where are your leaders' party spirit and
 mass viewpoint."
 It has been 5 or 6 years since the smashing of the "gang of four," but
 these problems still took place in the two bus stations which had been
 cited as Daqing-type enterprises.  What was the cause of these problems?
 And what did these problems show?   I think we should find the root cause of
 the problems:  What is the purpose of our socialist bus transport?  Is it
 .for the people or merely for production and profits?  How should we trans-
 port enterprises handle the enterprise's relationship with shippers and
 passengers?  Who are the masters after all?  Who should transport enter-
 prises serve?                    What are the standards for measuring the quality of our bus
 transport work?  Who are the judges of our work?    Should we look only at
 how the eight great indices are fulfilled, or should we also look at
 whether passengers and shippers are satisfied. with our work?  What is of
 particular importance is whether we should also build spiritual civiliza-
 tion and do ideological and political work well while in terms of attention
 we are paying attention to material civilization in tons and man in kilo-
 meters.  These are fundamental questions in our communications and transport
 work.  But some units and comrades often overlook these questions.  They
 even confuse the relationship of these questions.  Take these two Daqing-
 type enterprises for example.  It was true that their achievements in ful-
 filling the eight great indices were substantial and that they enjoyed a
 resounding reputation after being cited as Daqing-type enterprises.  But
 their attitude toward and quality of attending passengers were very, very
 bad.  To make things worse, they beat up and abused some passengers.  This
 was the fundamental reason why they were severely criticized by their
 passengers.  Through the activities of the "five stresses and four beauties,"
 and especially through this year's "all-people civility and courtesy month"
 activities, the two bus stations have made great progress in their work.
 This lesson is profound enough to learn from.
 In the final analysis, socialist transport personnel must become vanguards
 in propagating socialist spiritual civilization, and the bus transport
 trade should take this as its own goal.  But we must adopt a series of
 measures to achieve this goal.  At present, we must particularly set forth
 specific requirements, because spiritual civilization is not at all empty
 or abstract.  On the contrary, it is concrete and real.  In particular, it

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100310001-3
 must be manifested through the concrete actions of man.  Do not our passen-
 gers say that our bus stations are dirty, in disorder, bad and full of
 unhealthy trends?  To build spiritual civilization, we must first solve
 these four points.  We must do a good job in public health, maintain good
 order, raise the quality of service and improve the attitude in attending
 to passengers.  But the most fundamental thing is to solve the problem of
 unhealthy trends.  If a bus station or a bus is full of unhealthy trends,
 it must be dirty, in disorder and bad.  Once we have got rid of unhealthy
 trends, the problems of being dirty, in disorder and bad will also be
 solved.
 Not long ago I went to the Zhuhai special economic zone in Guangdong
 Province.  I saw the rules and regulations of the staff and workers of a
 car corps of the Shijingshan touring center.  I believe their rules and
 regulations are very good and quite specific.  For instance, working
 personnel are required to greet visitors with a smile.   The driver must
 open the door and say "please" when allowing passengers to board the bus
 or car.  Only after this may he board his bus or car and begin to drive.
 They have a set of rules for rewards and punishment.  Absence from work
 without leave and taking care of personal matters during work hours are all
 recorded.  The working personnel do not have to argue about the amount of
 money to be deducted from bonuses.  Those who observe all of the rules and
 regulations are entitled to their rewards.  Therefore everyone is very
 serious and energetic during work hours.  I stayed there for 1 or 2 hours.
 No one was grinning impudently or loafing.  If you-go there, they will
 greet you with a smile.  They are refined and courteous and are ready to
 answer any question.  They have very few supervisors, but their work is in
 perfect order, and the staff and workers are full of vigor.  The Zhuhai
 special economic zone in Guangdong Province is open to foreigners.  It is
 close to the capitalist world.  It is our outpost in the true sense of the
 word, and the working personnel there are our vanguards worthy of the name.
 They can perform their duties very well under such circumstances.  Why
 cannot working personnel in other places do the same?  So long as bus
 transport units all over the country can learn from this method, and so
 long as everyone is willing to work hard, rely on the party and the masses
 (including transport workers and passengers) to enable bus drivers, bus
 station personnel and ticket sellers.to become vanguards in propagating
 socialist spiritual civilization, it is completely possible for our bus
 transport corps and bus stations to become outposts in building socialist
 spiritual civilization.  Since the unfolding of the activities of the first
 nationwide "all-people civility and courtesy month," many bus stations and
 bus transport corps have been advancing in this orientation..  So long as
 we can persevere, make the foregoing a regular and systematic practice and
 constantly consolidate and develop it, I believe Comrade Hu Yaobang's
 requirements on transport workers will certainly be realized.
 Editor's note:   Pan Qi is an old comrade.  He was vice
 minister in the Ministry of Communications.  He has
 taken every opportunity to investigate bus stations and
 buses, and has made direct contact with passengers, bus
 drivers, ticket sellers and bus station personnel.  He is

 well acquainted with the opinions of the masses and
 constantly studies and improves his work.  Leading
 cadres at all levels, especially middle-aged and young
 cadres who have just been promoted to leadership posts,
 are required to pay attention to and learn from his
 work style of going deep into the grassroots level and
 maintaining close ties with the masses.  If leading
 cadres at all levels can perform their duties in this
 way, we will greatly reduce our bureaucratic work style
 and subjectivism, and there will certainly be a great
 improvement in our work.

 GRASP FIRMLY THE CENTRAL LINK--IDEOLOGICAL EDUCATION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82 pp 34-36
 [Article by Xin Cheng [2450 4453]]
 [Text] Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out:  "Ideological education is the key
 link to be grasped in uniting the whole party for great political struggles.
 Unless this is done, the party cannot accomplish any of its political
 tasks."  ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 3, p 1043)  We should firmly
 grasp the central link of ideological education regardless of the time or
 what kind of work we are doing.  Our party has a fine tradition in this
 respect.  Our party itself is the product of the integration of Marxism-
 Leninism and the workers' movement.  In this sense, it is appropriate to
 say that our party has built itself up by relying on ideological and
 political work.  Ideological and political work has given impetus to our
 cause of revolution and construction so that it develops, grows and
 advances.
 Millions upon millions of the maases have as their cause revolution and
 construction.  Without the direct support and unswerving struggles on the
 part of the broad masses of people, it is impossible to achieve our goal.
 To encourage the broad masses of people to take part in the cause of revolu-
 tion and construction in an active and orderly. way, we should strengthen
 ideological and political work so that the masses will become people with
 ideals, morals and culture and who observe discipline.  We should know that
 people's actions are governed by their ideology and that. ideals and belief
 are their spiritual support.   Their ideology and state of mind are connected
 with the orientation of their actions and effects.   The fundamental task of
 our ideological and political work is to persist in using Marxism-Leninism-
 Mao Zedong Thought to arm the cadres and the masses, raise their conscious-
 ness and enhance their ability to understand the objective world.  In so
 doing, we will arouse their enthusiasm to reform the objective and subjective
 world and to carry on the revolutionary spirit.  They will enhance their
 revolutionary vigor to ensure the accomplishment of the task of revolution
 and construction.
 In the past, Lin Biao and the "gang of four" had an ulterior motive in
 preaching the theory of the "omnipotence of spirit," saying that spirit and
 ideology might reverse the course of events and decide everything.  This was

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100310001-3
 truly ridiculous.  After repudiating this idealist fallacy, the truth of
 materialism shines again.  However,_some comrades wrongly think that
 ideological and political work is no longer important.  Such an idea is
 obviously wrong.   The reasons why some of the theories of Lin Biao and the
 "gang of four" were ridiculous were that they reversed the relations between
 matter and ideology on the one hand and economics and politics on the other.
 This ran counter to the objective law of the development of matter.  We
 uphold dialectical materialism and admit that matter decides ideology.
 Furthermore, we affirm the active role of ideology.  We should not neglect
 ideological and political work because we have abandoned the idealistic
 theory of the "omnipotence of spirit."
 Under the present socialist conditions in our country, there are various
 kinds of contradictions--the contradictions between the advanced and back-
 ward units, between right and wrong and between leaders and the masses.
 There are contradictions between the masses, state, collectives and indi-
 viduals.  In particular, there are the contradictions between the prole-
 tarian ideologies and various nonproletarian ideologies such as capitalist
 ideology, feudal ideology and so forth.  Although the exploiting class has
 been  eliminated as a class, its ideological influence will not disappear
 overnight.  Furthermore, there are remnants of the exploiting class in our
 country, the dregs of Lin Biao and the "gang of four," and counterrevolu-
 tionaries.                         There is also the influence of and infiltration by Taiwan,
 Penghu, Jinmen, Mazu, Hong Kong, Macao and international capitalism.
 Therefore, class struggle within certain limits will exist for a long time.
 Our party members and cadres are still facing the danger of degeneration.
 At present, serious trends of bourgeois liberalization have occurred in
 various fields of the social life in our country; this is particularly so
 of the unlawful and criminal activities in the economic field.  All these
 are the manifestation of the class struggle-under new historical conditions.
 In order to promote the great cause of. building our country into a socialist
 and modernized power, we should correctly understand and solve these con-
 tradictions and problems.  To do this, we should never for a single moment
 cut ourselves off from ideological and political work.  In particular, under
 the present conditions where the ideological influence of the exploiting
 class at home has not disappeared and where international capitalism still
 exists, the ideological field is not calm and tranquil.  If we fail to
 strengthen ideological and political work, decadent bourgeois ideology will
 inevitably take advantage of this opportunity to intrude and corrupt our
 ranks.  Over the past 2 years or so, unlawful and criminal activities in the
 economic field developed to a very severe extent and even some party members
 and cadres were involved in criminal activities.  This situation was, apart
 from other reasons, attributed to the defects of our work.  In other words,
 while implementing an open-door policy toward foreign countries and enliven-
 ing our domestic economy, we neglected the improvement of our management
 system and measures and did not do our ideological and political work well.
 Therefore, we should on no account neglect ideological and political work.
 We should conscientiously grasp it and persist in doing so for a long time.
 Some think that so long as we do a good job in the economy and improve the
 people's material living standard, they will automatically excel in

 ideological work, and that there is therefore no need for us to grasp
 ideological work.  This is really an oversimplified way of treating the
 relationship between economic development and ideological change.. Will
 people's ideological consciousness be automatically raised when we have
 effectively improved our economy and enhanced material living standards?
 Admittedly, the development of production and the improvement of our mate-
 rial and cultural life will have a great bearing on the people's ideology;
 spiritual civilization cannot be separated from certain material condi-
 tions.  However, spiritual civilization is not a direct derivation or
 appendage of material civilization.  Instead it is a great ideological con-
 struction project.  In order to build socialist spiritual civilization, we
 must carry out careful and painstaking work over a long time.  We should
 use ideological education to promote spiritual civilization and should make
 use of the legal system, discipline and public opinion to maintain and con-
 solidate it.  While using positive measures and the role of advanced exam-
 ples as guidance, we should criticize and struggle against passive, backward
 and reactionary things.  While advocating the new socialist ideas, morals
 and habits, we should carry on and absorb fine historical traditions.  It is
 not to be supposed that if we engage only in the building of material
 civilization, the tall buildings of spiritual civilization will automatically
 tower in front of us.  Marxism has told us that what directly determines
 people's ideology is not productive forces but production relations, that is,
 people's economic status (or class status in a class society).  People's
 ownership of the means of production, their positions and role in the
 process of social production and what they get from the distribution of
 social products determine their ideological viewpoints and feelings.  Once
 a kind of social ideology has been established, it is relatively independent
 of its economic base.  Although the old economic base has disappeared, the
 old ideology will not vanish immediately.  To eliminate its influence, we
 should carry out a fierce struggle in the ideological field so that the new
 ideology will take the place of the old one.  Furthermore, no kind of
 systematic doctrine or theory will spontaneously take.root in the people's
 minds; the people can only acquire them through propaganda.  This is par-
 ticularly the case with Marxist-Leninist theories and communist ideology.
 To enable the broad masses of people to master communist theories and
 ideology, we should, under the leadership of the party, carry out extensive
 and profound ideological education and a sustained struggle against the
 ideological concepts of the exploiting class and private ownership mentality.
 This objective cannot be attained through effective economic work alone.
 For example, in the 1950's and early 1960's, people's mentality and the
 general mood of the society were better than at present.  However, the level
 of economic development at that time was not as high as at present.  It is
 incorrect to say that with the development of material production, people's
 socialist ideological consciousness will also rise.  Any spontaneous theory
 viewpoint is utterly groundless because it goes against the law of ideologi-
 cal changes.  Furthermore, without strengthening ideological and political
 work and raising people's ideological.consciousness, it is impossible to
 fully arouse their enthusiasm for socialism, promote the national economy
 and enhance their living standard.

 There is another viewpoint related to the aforementioned one.  It is that
 some attribute certain unhealthy phenomenon and bad tendencies in the
 society to the low level of the development of production and the poor con-
 ditions of people's material life.  Such a view is completely wrong.  Do a
 low level of production development and poor conditions of material life
 inevitably usher in unhealthy trends or even unlawful and criminal acts?
 If we accept this view as correct, it means that we hide the evil conse-
 quences of the protracted sabotage of Lin Biao and the Jiang Qing counter-
 revolutionary cliques and deny the struggle between corrosion by the capi-
 talist ideology and corrosion-resistant socialist ideology, a struggle which
 really exists.  In other words, we admit that unhealthy trends and unlawful
 and criminal acts are pardonable.  Moreover, our production is constantly
 developing and the people's living standard is continuously rising.  It is
 improper to say that the level of development of our production is low and
 our'material living conditions are poor without making any analysis.
 Actually, the reason that some people were influenced by unhealthy trends
 or even committed crimes was not because they lacked food or clothing, but
 because they were corroded by the capitalist decadent ideology and the
 bourgeois way of life.  It is impossible to clarify the problem or seek a
 correct way of solving the problem by simply seeking the economic cause.
 .Some comrades maintain that as long as we do things according to economic
 law, we will promote economic construction well.  To them, it is unneces-
 sary to stress the importance of ideological education.  This is also a
 kind of muddled idea.  To carry out economic construction, we should, of
 course, do things according to economic law and make. use of necessary
 economic means.  There is no doubt about that.  However, it is wrong to
 merely regard economic work as a process of economic development.  This is
 because economic work is done by the people.  It is the people who under-
 stand and make use of economic law.  Are people's ideological conditions
 and mental attitudes not connected with their understanding and utilization
 of the economic law?  It is appropriate to say that if we deviate from
 ideological education and fail to enhance people's level of understanding
 of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and raise their communist conscious-
 ness, it is impossible for us to truly understand economic law and con-
 sciously utilize it.                        We will inevitably be manipulated by the spontaneous
 role of economic law.  For instance, we should rely mainly on the guidance
 of the state plan to develop our economy in the rural areas.  At the same
 time, we should make use of the role of law of value.  However, if we give
 up ideological and political work and fail to provide peasants with the
 education of "paying equal attention" to the interests of the state, the
 collectives and individuals, some of them might disregard the interests of
 the state and the collectives.  Thus the economy of the rural areas will go
 astray.  In-our economic work, we should stick to the principles of relying
 mainly on the planned economy, making the law of the marketplace subsidiary
 to these principles and coordinating all the activities of the nation as in
 a chess game.  To do this, we should oppose erroneous ideas such as selfish-
 ness, seeking private gain at public expense, decentralism, departmental
 selfishness and so forth.  Otherwise we will follow an erroneous tendency.
 To effectively implement the principle of distribution according to work
 and overcome egalitarianism, it is necessary to give staff members and

 workers who have overfulfilled production quotas and scored marked achieve-
 ments a certain amount of pay and bonuses.  This will help arouse their
 enthusiasm.  However, if we give up ideological and political work and
 regard the issuance of bonuses as the sole motive force for arousing the
 masses' enthusiasm in production, things will go contrary to our wishes.
 We will not only fail to arouse people's socialist enthusiasm, but also
 encourage them to "take money as the end-all."  As a result, they will go
 astray.  Some enterprises have learned profound lessons in this respect.
 We should bear it firmly in mind.  Of course, ideological and economic work
 should be combined with economic work and people's material interests.  We
 are not allowed to indulge in empty talk.  In other words, we should closely
 integrate ideological and political work with reality and carry it out in a
 thoroughgoing and painstaking way.  We should convince people by reasoning,
 not coercion.  Otherwise, it will be difficult for us to achieve good
 results.
 Those who educate the people should be educated first.  To strengthen
 ideological and political work, leading cadres should, first of all, fully
 understand the importance of the work.  When we raise the subject of
 strengthening ideological and political work, some people. think that we
 intend to provide only the masses with ideological education..  Actually, we
 should, first of all, solve the ideological problems of the leading cadres.
 If leading cadres fail to straighten out their ideas, do not fully under-
 stand the importance of ideological and political.work or are even influ-
 enced by a number of erroneous and muddled views, they will not be able to
 carry out ideological and political work effectively.  Therefore, leading
 comrades at all levels should strengthen their study of Marxism-Leninism-
 Mao Zedong Thought and fully understand the interrelationships between
 material civilization and spiritual civilization-on the one hand and poli-
 tics and economics on the other.  They should also clarify the inter-
 relationships between politics and technology as well as economic work and
 ideological work.  They should truly and firmly grasp the central link of
 ideological education and never for a moment relax their efforts in this
 respect.

 TEACHERS SHOULD SET EXAMPLES IN BUILDING SOCIALIST SPIRITUAL CIVILIZATION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82 pp 37-39
 [Article by Yu He [6735 4421]]
 [Text] Millions of people are concerned about the development of youths
 and it is a matter of strategic significance to educate well the hundreds
 of millions of youths across the country.  It is the responsibility of the
 whole society to educate young people, but the responsibility of primary
 andsecondary school teachers is even more direct and concrete.  The state
 and parents of youths have entrusted the children to schools, hoping that
 teachers will educate them well.  The reason why we should pay attention to
 the work of teachers and stress the importance of such work is that we have
 placed our hopes in the future and in the next generation.  There will be
 hope for our cause only if we are able to educate the next generation well.
 Lenin pointed out:  "The most important course in any school is political
 orientation.  Who decides this orientation?  It can only be decided by the
 entire teaching staff."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 15, p 438)  Com-
 rade Mao Zedong also said that for a school "the most important things are
 selecting the principal and teachers and defining reaching principle."
 ("Selected Works of Mao Zedong," Vol 1, p 161)  Following definition of
 teaching principle, an important problem is the question of teachers, for
 both ideological education and teaching work in schools are mainly carried
 out through teachers.  Whether teachers are able to carry out their work
 well will directly influence the growth of the broad masses of primary and
 secondary school pupils.  There are more than 10 million primary and
 secondary school teachers in our country.  They make up a big revolutionary
 army.  These teachers have heavy responsibilities and are busily occupied
 with their work.  With arduous tasks,.they work very hard and have a par-
 ticularly important responsibility of bringing up a new generation and of
 building socialist spiritual civilization. Whether they are teaching
 culture and scientific knowledge or nurturing the broad masses of primary
 and secondary school pupils in ideology and morality, all such works are an
 important aspect of the building of socialist spiritual civilization.  The
 youths that are being educated by primary and secondary school teachers will
 become builders of socialist materialistic civilization and spiritual
 civilization.  Therefore, it is' true when we say that teachers are engineers
 of the souls of mankind and active and direct builders of socialist spiritual
 civilization.

 The "five stresses and four beauties" campaign that is being launched across
 the country is an important part of the building of socialist spiritual
 civilization.  It is very important to launch such a campaign in primary and
 secondary schools.  As for the pupils, through the requirement of concrete
 images and the implementation of students' regulations, pupils will be able
 to differentiate between what is beautiful and what is ugly, between good
 and evil, and between what are good, beneficial and civilized deeds that
 should be actively undertaken and what are uncivilized, ugly and unhealthy
 things that should be resolutely discarded.  Consequently, they will be able
 to constantly raise their ideological consciousness and morality, strengthen
 their sense of organization and discipline and grow along a correct and
 healthy road.  This campaign has provided the teachers with an opportunity
 to combine the building of socialist spiritual civilization with their daily
 routines so that their educational work will have a stronger ideological
 nature and more definite goal.  In addition, teachers will be able to do a
 good job in the campaign, lead. pupils to follow their examples and make all
 schools have a good style of study and work only when they set examples.  If
 the tens of hundreds of our schools are able to do well in this regard, they
 will constitute a tremendous motive force in improving social practice and
 in establishing new habits.
 The delegates to the national conference of the trade unions of the primary
 and secondary schools across the country to exchange experiences in
 ideological and political work called on teachers to set examples during
 the campaign.  This is a significant proposal and it has pointed out a
 direction for teachers' activities.  The "four beauties" first of all means
 beautiful souls.  The beautiful souls of teachers are mainly demonstrated
 in their loyalty to the party's education cause and their love for their
 work, their schools and their pupils.  Pupils represent our future and are
 the successors of our revolutionary cause.  Therefore, the conditions of
 these pupils' growth and ideology are important and directly related to the
 future of our country, the fate of the nation and the success or failure of
 our revolutionary cause..  Therefore, the teachers must demonstrate their
 love for the party and the socialist motherland first of all by doing a
 good job in their own work and in nurturing their pupils.
 Love for pupils is an invaluable feeling as well as a foundation for doing a
 good job in education.  Our purpose is to educate pupils according to the
 requirement of the party and the country so that the pupils may develop
 their morality, knowledge and physical fitness and become laborers with
 socialist consciousness and culture and talents, having political con-
 sciousness and professional knowledge.  This is the glorious and yet heavy
 historical task of teachers.  The educators of new China must not only pass
 on knowledge but also be responsible for educating students in ideology and
 morality so that they will not only possess rich knowledge but also have
 higher ideological consciousness and beautiful morality and understand that
 the purpose of gaining knowledge is to use it to serve the people and con-
 tribute to their motherland and to mankind.  If we pay attention only to
 injecting knowledge and examination subjects into the minds of pupils but
 pay no attention to making them wise, and if we do not guide them to form
 high ideals and do not pay attention to helping them form an aesthetic

 outlook and to carrying out physical conditioning, we will run counter to
 the goal of socialist education as well as to educational principles.  Good
 people's teachers must educate and instruct people, implement the party's
 educational principle in an all-round way and be concerned with the growth
 of all the pupils.
 In order to educate pupils it is imperative to understand them and to be
 acquainted with each of them so that with a definite objective in view we
 will be able to teach them with skill and patience and help them grow.  If
 you do not understand them and do not know what they are thinking, then you
 only speak your own words and they think their own problems.  Thus you will
 not be able to do a good job in education.  Some outstanding teachers main-
 tain close contact with the pupils and make friends with them.  The pupils
 regard such teachers as their intimate friends.  They like to tell the
 teachers what they have on their minds in order to seek guidance from them.
 Teachers must work hard to make themselves respected and loved by the
 pupils, not respected but distant.  Teachers cannot disregard those pupils
 who are doing poorly in their studies, nor can they despise them.  On the
 contrary, teachers must love them, must even show particular concern for
 them and give them more help.  In fact, pupils with more shortcomings need
 more concern from their teachers.
 Teachers must not only ardently love their pupils but must also be
 accomplished and skilled in carrying out their work or they will not be
 able to accomplish their tasks.  Therefore, they must study hard and be
 professionally competent and spare no efforts to improve teaching methods
 so as to improve their teaching standard.  Their study and profession must
 include specialized knowledge on subjects taught and each teacher must
 understand related knowledge about pedagogy, psychology and teaching methods,
 and have some knowledge of Marxist-Leninist basic theories and the party's
 important policies and principles.  Only when teachers have grasped this
 knowledge will they be able to teach with good results and according to the
 requirements of the party and the people and to the young people's psychology
 and physiology.
 Primary and secondary school pupils are in the stage of rapid growth, highly
 impressionable and incapable of distinguishing right from wrong.  They have
 little ability to control themselves and are vulnerable to outside influence.
 They often understand things and differentiate right from wrong proceeding
 from concrete images; therefore, the deeds and the attitudes of their
 teachers have a particular influence on them.  That is why we have particu-
 larly stressed the importance of the role of teachers' examples and demanded
 that the teachers always pay attention to their own moral cultivation, place
 strict demands on themselves, train themselves to become politically con-
 scious and professionally competent and set examples for pupils with regard
 to cultural development, ideological standards and morality.  Since teachers
 demand that pupils form a high spiritual civilization, it is first of all
 imperative for teachers to do so.  Since teachers demand that pupils speak
 beautiful words, the teachers themselves must not speak ugly and uncivilized
 words.  They must say beautiful things during or after class, in front of
 pupils, in school, when not around pupils, outside school and at home.

 Setting an example for others means playing an exemplary role, being as good
 as one's word, thinking and behaving in a certain way,'and teaching by
 personal example as well as by verbal instruction.  That is to say, teach-
 ers must educate and influence the feelings and souls of the pupils through
 their own deeds and with vivid and sound reasoning.
 It is imperative for the party organizations and educational administrative
 departments and teachers' organizations of education trade unions at various
 levels to make concerted efforts to enable the broad masses of teachers to
 meet the above-mentioned requirements and set examples.  It is necessary now
 to further implement the party's policy on intellectuals, unite the broad
 masses of teachers around the party, fully mobilize their initiative and
 creativity, further improve their political and professional level and work-
 ing capability and further improve their conditions for work, study and life
 as well as their position.  Primary and secondary school teachers have been
 an important army in the ranks of intellectuals; it is the biggest such army.
 We cannot say that there are no problems in the question of how to use and
 treat teachers.  Even today, the leadership in some regions and units still
 do not really understand the importance of education and the position of
 the roles of intellectuals in this new period.  They do not conscientiously
 carry out the pertinent policies of the CCP Central. Committee issued since
 the 3d Plenary Session of the CCP Central Committee.  Particularly, they do
 not show enough concern for young intellectuals.  As a result, the capabil-
 ities of many young people have not yet  been fully displayed and their
 difficulties in work, study and life have yet to be properly resolved.  In
 addition, since the implementation of the open-door policy, some people have
 been influenced by bourgeois ideology while our ideological and political
 work is very weak.  Consequently, some problems have appeared in our work.
 Therefore, it is imperative for party organizations at various levels to
 conscientiously implement the party's policies concerning intellectuals and
 eradicate the biased views about intellectuals that still exist within the
 party and in society.   It is necessary to treat intellectuals equally in
 politics, use them daringly in their work and be concerned with their live-
 lihood.  It is imperative to make the broad masses of teachers realize that
 they are masters of their country and schools so that they will be able to
 fully display their initiative and pool their wisdom to run schools well.
 Some schools have experimented in setting up the system of teachers' con-
 gresses under the leadership of party committees with encouraging results.
 We must also create broad public opinion in schools and society so as to
 form a new social practice of pupils respecting teachers and the latter
 loving the former.
 The party committees at various levels must carry out vivid, practical and
 effective ideological and political work and do a good job among the teach-
 ers through education trade unions.  Education trade unions recently pointed
 out that it was necessary "to proceed from the features of education trade
 unions and to give priority to doing a good job in ideological and political
 work among teachers."  This statement is in accord with reality and repre-
 sents a glorious tradition of the education trade union.  The broad masses
 of intellectuals are part of the working class.  But the working class is
 not a golden symbol.  It must set examples through its own deeds and

 constantly transform its subjective world outlook in the process of trans-
 forming the objective world.  In order to carry out ideological and political
 work well, it is imperative first of all to arm teachers with Marxism-
 Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought and the party's principles and policies, and to
 educate them in the revolutionary tradition of the working class and his-
 torical tasks.  It is also necessary for teachers, through study and prac-
 tice, through criticism and self-criticism and by overcoming shortcomings,
 to get rid of various influences of bourgeois ideology, constantly raise
 their communist ideological consciousness, persist in the four basic prin-
 ciples, constantly improve their sense of responsibility toward the revolu-
 tionary cause, step up their consciousness in implementing the party's
 education principles, persist in and develop the morality and tradition of
 the working class and make demands of themselves, influence pupils and
 carry out their work with the ideology and morality of the working class.
 Leading cadres at various levels must visit schools, contact the broad
 masses of teachers to understand their situations with concern, patiently
 and honestly help them to solve problems and make friends and talk with them.
 When conditions permit, the teachers' actual problems in their work, life and
 study must be resolved immediately.  When they have problems in their
 ideology and understanding, leading cadres should in no way take the stand
 as educators and criticize them; on the contrary, they must proceed with
 good intentions, patiently help them to solve problems, become friends of
 the masses and combine the work of solving ideological problems with actual
 problems.  Primary and secondary school teachers have a certain cultural
 level with various talents; politically, they protect the party and social-
 ism, they work conscientiously with sense of responsibility.  They have a
 healthy, modest and reasonable ideological style.  Their social economic
 position is not high.   Therefore, it is imperative for the leadership to
 understand, trust, respect and have concern for them.  They are busily
 engaged in their work.  Their lives are monotonous and therefore they must
 be given an opportunity for contacts with society and nature.  Teachers not
 only have to improve themselves, but they also must educate pupils.  There-
 fore, they must be given some "capital" so that they can play still greater
 roles.
 Trade unions are communist universities and full use must be made of the
 features of trade unions in carrying out ideological and political work.
 It is necessary for self-education of the masses to be carried out from the
 top down to grassroots levels so as to promote the basic positive educa-
 tion method of displaying the advanced to lead the general, to carry out
 educational activities with definite purpose, and to carry out various .
 lively and imaginative educational activities and inspire and exert influ-
 ence on people's character and thinking.  With definite guiding ideology
 and fully representative of mass organizations, the work of trade unions
 will be very helpful.
 In short, with policies implemented and a good job done in ideological work,
 people will be convinced to improve their understanding and step up their
 efforts.  In this way, it will be possible to form a deep ideological foun-
 dation for teachers to set examples while the work in educating our new
 generation will be guaranteed.

 IT IS HELPFUL TO STUDY THE THEORY OF REPRODUCTION
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82 pp 40-42
 [Article by Huang Zhigang [7806 1807 0474], second secretary of Tianjin
 Municipal CCP Committee]
 [Text]  Not long ago, some cadres in Tianjin municipality studied the
 Marxist theory of reproduction and the reaction was quite good.  Taken as
 a whole, the study has helped us deepen our understanding of the principle
 of readjustment, restructuring, reorganizing and upgrading that has been
 implemented by the CCP Central Committee since the 3d Plenary Session of
 the 11th CCP Central Committee.  The following derives from my understand-
 ing gained in the study of the Marxist theory of reproduction, and I use my
 understanding in concretely explaining the guiding role of this theory in
 our economic construction.
 It must be said that the principle of the proportionate development of
 production of the two big categories is the core of the Marxist theory of
 reproduction.  Marx classified the complicated and intermingled economic
 activities into two big categories--production of the means of production
 and production of the means of consumption.  He also pointed out the rela-
 tionship of mutual adaptability and mutual balance between the two cate-
 gories and within each of these categories.                         This is an objective need in
 social mass production that is independent of people's will.  Because of
 the influence of "leftist" ideology for quite a long period in the past,
 our planning to a certain degree departed from our country's objective need
 for proportionate development of the national economy and departed from
 practice.  As a result, our national economy was out of balance which
 caused serious waste of social productive forces.  The purpose of the
 readjustment put forth by the CCP Central Committee is aimed at enabling
 our national economy to take the road that accords with proportionate
 development in production of the two big categories and to achieve better
 economic effects.  Therefore the questions of what is to be readjusted,
 how to readjust it and how to realize a good circulation in the national
 economy can in no way be defined subjectively; they must be guided by the
 Marxist theory of reproduction.
 In expounding the conditions for the realization of social reproduction,
 Marx pointed out that whether in simple reproduction or in expanded
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 reproduction, the production of the first category must not only make up
 for its own consumption of the means of production but must also meet the
 needs of the second category in terms of means of production; the produc-
 tion of the second category must not only make up for its own consumption
 of the means of subsistence but must also meet the needs of the first
 category in terms of means of subsistence.  Social reproduction can be
 carried out smoothly only when we are able to follow the proportionate
 relationship between these two categories as pointed out by Marx and
 realize the conditions for this relationship.  Many of the problems that
 cropped up in our economic life over the past many years, such as consumer
 goods being in short supply for a long period and unbalanced phenomena such
 as enormous stockpiling of heavy industrial products, particularly mechani-
 cal and electrical products, were caused by the fact that we upset this
 balance.  The CCP Central Committee pointed out that in carrying out read-
 justment work it is imperative to combine the work of developing light
 industry and the textile industry with readjustment in the service orienta-
 tion of heavy industry so that the production of the two big categories will
 gradually become balanced.  This is completely correct.  Under the leader-
 ship and with the support of the CCP Central Committee, Tianjin munici-
 pality has, since 1979, emphasized the development of light industry and
 the textile industry.  On the one hand, the city has concentrated its
 efforts in developing 18 trades, promoting the production of 136 varieties
 of famous brand products and "fist" products and in carrying out 902 tech-
 nical reform projects.  On the other hand, it has organized heavy industry
 to serve the technical reform and equipment renewal of the light and
 textile industries and to provide urgently needed advanced technical equip-
 ment and good quality raw materials with applicable specifications.  Thanks
 to these efforts, the value of. the city's gross industrial output increased
 on an average by 8.8 percent annually over the past 3 years.  Of this, the
 output value of light industry increased by an average of 14.8 percent
 annually while heavy industry increased by 2.2 percent.  In the gross
 industrial output value, the proportion of heavy industry has decreased and,
 as a result, the industrial structure has tended. to be more rational.  This
 shows that the national economy will be able to develop smoothly only when
 our planning accords with the law of mutual agreement in the production of
 the two big categories.
 According to the Marxist theory of reproduction, the various departments
 within the production of the two big categories must also develop propor-
 tionately.  Take the first category for example.  In addition to producing
 the means of production for the production of the second category, the
 first category must also meet its own needs and carry out exchanges among
 its own various departments.  Marx referred to this situation as "producing
 a constantly repeated movement" between the constant capital within the
 first category and constant capital.  This situation is in fact what
 today we often call self-service by heavy industry.  Therefore it can be
 seen that self-service by heavy industry is imperative and, under the pre-
 requisite that it accords with the law of reproduction movement, can in no
 way be neglected.  We made mistakes in our work in the past because we

 production just for the sake of production.  In the process of readjustment,
 it is necessary to stress the importance of heavy industry serving agri-
 culture and light industry but at the same time we cannot neglect the impor-
 tance of heavy industry serving itself.  We must pay attention to this
 question.  In the final analysis, the rational self-service within heavy
 industry itself is in the interest of serving agriculture and light indus-
 try still better.  Take the machine building industry for example:  Unless
 the structure of the products of the machine building industry is readjusted,
 no new varieties of products are added and no improvement is made in the
 quality of the products.  It will thus not be possible for the various
 departments of our national. economy to have an advanced technical founda-
 tion and consequently the constant and stable development of our national
 economy will be affected.  Therefore it is imperative for us to understand
 the Marxist principle of the interrelationship between the production of
 the two big categories in an all-round and correct way.
 In referring to the expansion of reproduction, Marx pointed out the
 existence of the two forms of reproduction.  One is extensive expansion of
 reproduction, that is "building new factories outside the old factories."
 Today we refer to this situation as adding new items and projects.  Another
 is intensive expansion of reproduction.  This means relying on the existing
 enterprises by tapping their potential and improving their "efficiency of
 the means of production" so as to expand the productive force.  It is of
 great significance to have a clear understanding of the forms of these two
 different forms of expansion of reproduction.  In readjusting the national
 economy, the party Central Committee stressed the importance of the stra-
 tegic measures of intensively expanding reproduction as the main factor so
 as to mend the longstanding lopsided point of view and method of expanding
 the scale of production by mainly relying on adding new items and projects.
 Marx expounded the concrete contents of intensive expansion of reproduc-
 tion from many aspects such as progress in production, technology, rational
 organization of productive forces, improvement in the skills of laborers
 and making full use of the means of production.  Such intensive development
 in the expansion of reproduction is in fact developing production in depth
 and breadth.  Our investigations showed that over the past few years, some
 trades and enterprises have.paid attention to intensively expanding repro-
 duction.  They have improved their management, carried out coordination
 among specialized departments, undertaken technical reform and equipment
 renewal, improved scientific technology and quality of products and added
 more new varieties.  They have made considerable achievements as they have
 carried out only one or two of these items, but in a good way.  The Tianjin
 No 3 Steel Rolling Plant has carried out a major technical reform every
 year since 1978 and basically it has been able to put the results of the
 reform into production in the same year.  This plant has been able to add
 an annual 10 million yuan of profits for 3 years running.   The Tianjin
 Dyeing and Textile Industry Company and its subsidiaries carried out coor-
 dination in production among specialized departments and as a result,
 production output value in 1981 was 99 percent higher than 1978 and profits
 increased by 1.2 times.   The Tianjin Seamless Tubes Factory implemented an
 accounting system in economic contacts between departments, workshops and

 teams and as a result, the profit rate of capital grew to 30 percent in
 1981, or 1.2 times higher than 1978, while profits increased by 4.7 times.
 If all our enterprises are able to proceed from their own specific condi-
 tions and carry out feasible and comprehensive measures, they will no
 doubt achieve better economic effects.  When we stress the importance of
 carrying out intensive expansion of reproduction as the main, we do not
 mean putting aside extensive expansion of reproduction when it is possible,
 and particularly not in energy and communications construction.  It is
 imperative to overcome this weak link in order to create conditions for
 the better development of our national economy.
 The principle of capital circulation and turnover constitutes an important
 part of the Marxist theory of reproduction and therefore it is also of
 realistic significance to study this principle.
 It can be seen from the whole process of socialist social reproduction that
 whether the movement of capital can be carried out smoothly mainly depends
 on whether or not we can correctly handle the proportional relationship
 between the two big categories and the relations between intensive expan-
 sion of reproduction and extensive expansion of reproduction.  But we must
 understand that the movement of capital itself is relatively independent.
 Therefore when there are problems in some links of the movement of capital,
 such as a lack of coordination in supply, production and sale and the rela-
 tions between industry and commerce and between industry and trading not
 being in harmony, these problems will spoil the balance between the two big
 categories.  Consequently it is necessary for us to fully understand the
 importance of capital circulation and turnover.  Marx' explanation about
 rational utilization of fixed capital and working capital is helpful to us
 in solving such problems as the low utility rate of fixed assets and
 excessive use of working capital; his views about how to sell commodities
 in a timely way is useful in solving such problems as having limited
 channels for commodity circulation, too many intermediary links and bad
 circulation; his views on "voluntary" and "involuntary" commodity reserves
 will help us solve such problems as irrational commodity reserves and
 irrational use of capital, while his views about banking are helpful to us
 in improving the roles of our banks in raising, collecting and using
 finance and in speeding up capital turnover.  Therefore, industrial, agri-
 cultural, commercial, banking and tax revenue departments must proceed from
 the point of speeding up the movement of social gross capital, closely
 coordinate with each other and spare no efforts in carrying out their own
 duties.  They must in no way proceed from departmentalism and disregard the
 whole situation; otherwise they will cause waste in the use of capital.
 As mentioned above, I believe it makes a big difference for the broad masses
 of cadres, particularly those working in the economic sector, whether or
 not they study the Marxist theory of reproduction.  In studying "Das
 Kapital" in the past, we mostly concentrated our attention on exposing the
 exploitation and decadence of capitalism and in understanding the objective
 necessity of the dying out of capitalism.  This method of study is of
 course right.  But from this book we must absorb more spiritual nourishment

 that is needed in our modernization program.  Last year and in spring this
 year, Tianjin city organized leading cadres above the regional, prefec-
 tural and bureau level to study the Marxist theory of reproduction and the
 results were quite good.  Practice in this study proved that the Marxist
 theory of reproduction is not beyond our reach, nor does it depart from
 practice.  On the contrary, this theory has an important guiding role in
 our economic construction.  We must sum up our experiences in this study
 so that our cadres will be able to make further progress in their study.

 DIALECTICALLY PONDER OVER ECONOMIC PROBLEMS
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82 pp 43-45, 42
 [Article by Zhang Jing [4545 4544]]
 [Text] In the study of economic theory, we should ponder problems and sum
 up experiences using the scientific ideological methodology of materialist
 dialectics.  In other words, we should grasp the dialectical relations of
 the development of objective affairs in the sphere of economics and link
 the general laws of materialist dialectics with actual practice in economic
 wo r1f .
 People can readily see that the economic sector really is a "boundless
 universe."  It comprises numerous divisions and trades.  The network of
 production and circulation is widely scattered while the division of work
 and coordination are profoundly related to each other and form a criss-
 cross network of immense dimensions.  Each and. every economic "factor" not
 only is mutually dependent, subjected to reciprocal control and part of the
 organic whole but also is influenced by internal and external factors and
 remains in a state of constant motion and change.  Furthermore, all matters
 in the economic sector have their inherent contradictions and are governed
 by the relations of the unity of opposites.  For example, the productive
 force and production relations of the entire socioeconomic system, the
 accumulation and consumption of the national income, the "bones" (produc-
 tion construction) and "meat" (nonproduction construction) of capital
 construction, expanded reproduction by intension and expanded reproduction
 by extension, the central authorities and the local authorities of the
 management system, big planning and small freedom, and so on, are all
 examples of the unity of opposites.  As for an individual economic divi-
 sion, it also has many concrete instances of the unity of opposites such as,
 for example, grain production and diversified operations in agriculture,
 heavy industry and light industry in industry, centralized leadership and
 diversified management in commerce, and so on.  The parties of the contra-
 diction in the unity of opposites repulse each other but depend on each
 other, jointly form the composite body of the national economy and foster
 and promote economic development.  Lenin said:  "Dialectics may simply be
 verified as the theory of the unity of opposites."  "In order to understand
 the 'self-movement,' self-generated development and vitality in all the
 goings-on in the world, we must understand these proceedings as the unity

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100310001-3
 of opposites."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 38, pp 240, 408)  In
 economic work, our guiding thought should be to correctly understand and
 handle the various contradictions in the economic sector.  The results of
 our work will have to depend to a certain extent on whether or not we can
 consciously employ materialist dialectics and correctly grasp and regulate
 the dialectical relations of the contradictions between the two parties of
 the unity of opposites.
 Looking at past historical experience, we are deeply impressed by the
 importance of dialectically pondering economic problems by pursuing the law
 of the unity of opposites.
 Early in the democratic revolutionary period, Comrade Mao Zedong had
 already noted the importance of the use of materialist dialectics in guid-
 ing economic work.  He formulated such principles as promoting production,
 protecting supplies, centralizing leadership, diversifying operations,
 having regard for both the military and the civilian, considering both
 public and private interests, placing equal emphasis on production and
 economy, and so on.  These were all measures to promote the. development of
 production and economic prosperity in the base areas.  At that time, the
 matters of primary concern were the military and political struggles and
 economic construction had yet to place on the daily agenda for delibera-
 tion.  Consequently, there was not yet a possibility of fully developing
 economic dialectics.  After the founding of the PRC and following the
 large-scale development of economic construction, the use of material
 dialectics to guide economic work became an-important lesson in guiding
 thought.  During the first 5-year plan period, we were comparatively more
 cautious and.more realistic.  We handled relations between productive force
 and production, industry and agriculture, accumulation and consumption,
 "bones" and "meat" and the like fairly well.  We succeeded fairly well in
 bringing about an overall balance.  As a result, economic development
 progressed at a rapid pace and the 5-year plan was triumphantly fulfilled
 in less than 4 years.  In Comrade Mao Zedong's 1956 report "On the 10 Big
 Relationships," he made use of materialist dialectics to give a systematic
 summary of the experiences in practice in socialist construction.  Espe-
 cially concerning the relations between industry and agriculture, heavy
 industry and light industry, coastal industries and inland industries,
 state production units and individuals, and central and local authorities,
 the discussions were full of economic dialectics and were extremely signifi-
 cant in guiding our economic work.  When Comrade Chen Yun was in charge of
 economic and industrial affairs, he strongly insisted on the principle of
 being practical and realistic and was keen to make use of materialist
 dialectics to analyze and solve problems.  For example, many of his view-
 points were full of economic dialectics, such as his views that in a
 socialist economy state-operated enterprises and those operated by the
 collectives should form the principal part and a restricted number of
 individually operated enterprises should be supplementary; that in indus-
 trial and agricultural production, planned production should be primary
 and free production within the sphere of the national plan should be supple-
 mentary; that in a socialist unified market, the state market should be
 primary while the free market under the state's leadership and within a

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 prescribed area should be supplementary; that economic construction and the
 people's standard of living should both be given due attention and be bal-
 anced; that great attention should be given to the study of the proportionate
 relations within the national economy and to achieving an overall balance;
 that in.capital construction both the general and the particular or pivotal
 points should be ensured and attended to; that in. arranging construction
 projects note should be taken of the existence of light items among the
 heavy ones and of the existence of heavy items among the light ones, and so
 forth.  These correct viewpoints of Chen Yun further amplified and developed
 the economic thought brought forth by Comrade.Mao Zedong in his treatise
 "On the 10 Big Relationships" and played an important part in guiding
 China's economic construction at that period.  Although at the time certain
 of his views were not given great attention or adopted, yet because they
 reflected the dialectical relations of objective things and constituted
 materialist dialectics that could be put to concrete use in economic work,
 they were able to stand the trials of actual practice and examination.
 Even today, after more than 20 years, they still possess great vitality.
 It can thus be seen that in the final analysis a correct economic guideline
 and a correct economic theory reflect and summarize the dialectical rela-
 tions of objective things in the realm of economics and in fact are the
 results of dialectically pondering economic problems.
 If it is established that the triumph in our country's socialist economic
 construction is indivisible from the due regard given to the use of mate-
 rialist dialectics in our guiding thought, then it may be concluded that
 the errors or setbacks suffered in our country's economic construction are
 to the same extent closely related to our overlooking or even violating
 materialist dialectics.
 Our violation of materialist dialectics is mainly due to one-sidedness in
 understanding.  Just as Comrade Chen Yun pointed out:  "Our errors are due
 to the failure to do things according to objective facts.  But those of us
 who have committed errors were not without some support.  Rather, they
 mistook the part for the whole."  ("How To Make Our Understanding More
 Complete")  Our errors in economic work were mostly of this nature.  For
 example, our socialist transformation may be said to have been as a whole
 successful, but in the course of its progress some comrades were over-
 impressed by the merits of centralized production and centralized operation
 and overlooked the fact that centralized production and diversified produc-
 tion and centralized operation and diversified operation were in reality
 the unity of opposites and, although opposed to each other, could readily
 assist each other.  As a result, the phenomena of blindly chasing after the
 merging of small plants into big plants and of converting diversified opera-
 tions to centralized operations developed.  This brought about such maladies
 as certain products deteriorating in quality, a decrease in the variety of
 products, poor services rendered, inability to respond to the consumption
 needs of the populace, and so on.  Again, for example, since the latter
 part of the 1950's and over a fairly prolonged period, the one-sided over-
 emphasis on the development of heavy industry (particularly the iron and
 steel industry) and on achieving large accumulation and a high speed of
 development has resulted in the entire national economy losing its balance

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100310001-3
 and there is no way for it to develop smoothly.  Hence, although generally
 speaking one-sidedness cannot be said to be idealism, yet if one-sidedness
 has a start and if one side of the contradiction develops to the point of
 absolute predominance, this may possibly lead to idealism and to the oppo-
 site side of materialist dialectics.
 Engels long ago pointed out:  "Contempt for dialectics will invariably
 bring punishment."  ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 3, p 482)
 For many years, we have suffered much in this regard and have had many
 painful experiences and lessons.  These experiences and lessons may be
 summarized from different angles and different sides but there are two
 points of a regular and basic nature.  These should be especially noted
 and thoroughly studied in the course of theoretical study.
 One point is that in economic work we must hold firm to this materialist
 dialectic basic concept of the 'unity of opposites.  At no time and under no
 conditions should we strongly emphasize one side, overlook or even refute
 the other side or, in short, sacrifice one side in order to play up the
 other side.   To put it in Lenin's words, we should not hold one side "in
 esteem to the point of the absolute."  ("Collected Works of Lenin," Vol 38,
 p 222)
 When touching on economic relations and economic contradictions, Engels
 said:   "Since this is one type of relations, it means that the reciprocal
 connections of the two sides are involved."  ("Selected Works of Marx and
 Engels," Vol 2, p 123)  Since objectively the two sides are mutually
 related and mutually dependent, losing one side renders the other side
 untenable.  Hence, we cannot artificially separate the two sides or one-
 sidedly care for one end but forsake the other.  Take for example this
 problem of economic interests with which we customarily meet.  They
 habitually comprise the relations between two sides, namely, current inter-
 ests and long-term interests, and interests of a sector and interests of
 the whole.  Only in simultaneously studying the two-sides and proceeding
 further to examine the form of their mutual relations and their reciprocal
 role, that is to say, studying their dialectical relations of the unity
 of opposites, can we find the correct method of solving the problem.  To
 isolatedly and one-sidedly at any time play up one side and overlook the
 other side can bring about losses.   Certain contradictions may clearly be
 seen to be principal or secondary and leading or subsidiary, as, for .
 example, the frequently mentioned big collective and small freedom, big
 centralization and small diversification, and planned economy as the
 principal and regulation by market mechanism as supplementary.  Because of
 the great disparity in the status of the two parties of the contradiction
 and objectively because of the actual conditions of one party commanding
 great attention and the other being lightly regarded and one party being
 primary and the other supplementary, it is very easy to lay great stress
 on the one and to neglect the other.  Under such conditions, it is all the
 more important to grasp the unity of opposites between the two parties and
 to grasp the dialectical relations of their opposing each other yet also
 complementing each other, and guard against holding one party in "absolute
 esteem."

 ARE CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION AND EXPANDED REPRODUCTION ONE AND THE SAME THING?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82 pp 46-47
 [Article by Li Mengbai [2621 1125 4101]]
 [Text] The concept of capital construction was first mentioned in Stalin's
 report "On the Economic Condition of the Soviet Union and the Party's
 Policies."  Generally, it is used to describe the process of the formation
 of fixed assets.  Newly established production departments must carry out
 capital construction for the formation of new fixed assets.  For example,
 old China did not have an aviation industry, but since the founding of the
 PRC we have established a new aviation industry.  The production equipment
 and facilities it possesses have been.formed via the capital construction
 process.  As for production departments that have already been established,
 if they wish to continuously enlarge the scale of their fixed assets so as
 to increase their production capacity, they will have to go through capital
 construction to realize this objective.  In order to make a rational dis-
 tribution of productive force on a nationwide scale and also to carry out
 construction of the cities and towns and communications, it is also neces-
 sary to rationally assign various kinds of fixed assets to the various
 .localities and the relevant departments.  All this is brought about by
 means of capital construction.  Capital construction is a type of compre-
 hensive economic activity which is spread through the various material
 production departments and the nonmaterial production departments.
 Although capital construction plays an important role in social expanded
 reproduction, it is not one and.the same thing as social expanded repro-
 duction.
 First, capital construction constitutes an important means for the realiza-
 tion of expanded reproduction but is not the only and sole means.  While
 capital construction is for the purpose of serving social expanded repro-
 duction, the expansion of the scope of social production does not depend
 entirely on capital construction for realization.  In his analysis of the
 road of expanded reproduction, Marx said:  "The yearly expansion of produc-
 tion comes from two sources:  First, a continuous increase in the input
 of capital into production; and second, a continuous improvement in the
 utilization efficiency of capital."  ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels,"
 Vol 26, p 598)  He further pointed out that expanded reproduction was in two
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100310001-3
 forms:  "In the event of an expansion of the production premises, then it is
 expanded reproduction by extension; in the event of improvement in the effi-
 ciency of the means of production, then it is expanded reproduction by
 intension."  ("Selected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 24, p 192)  Expanded
 reproduction by extension has the special feature of the expansion of the
 production premises and is shown in the building of a new plant outside the
 original plant or expansion of the original plant.  Hence, expanded repro-
 duction by extension is realized by means of capital construction, while
 expanded reproduction by intension is not necessarily accompanied by capital
 construction.  This is because of two possible conditions:  In the event of
 improving the quality of the machines, speeding up the operations, improving
 the labor organization, effecting economy in raw materials, and so on, then
 capital construction is not needed; in the event of improving the handicraft
 or production technique, raising the degree of automation, expanding the
 production line, and so on, then this will need an appropriate scale of
 construction and the installation of new equipment.  As for capital con-
 struction, we should let it display its role in full both in expanded
 reproduction by extension and in expanded reproduction by intension.  Over
 the past years it was customary that whenever production development was
 contemplated, fervent efforts would be made to undertake capital construc-
 tion of the extension type and the measures of the technical restructuring
 of the enterprise units and improving the operation and management were
 neglected.  This could hardly achieve the best returns on investment.  We
 should firmly remember lessons of this kind.
 Second, capital construction serves not only expanded reproduction but also
 simple reproduction.  For a long period of time, under the influence of the
 one-sided belief that capital construction and expanded reproduction are
 one and the same thing, arrangements for the simple reproduction items have
 been frequently overlooked in capital. construction.  This is not in con-
 formity with Marx' theory on reproduction.  In discussing the relations
 between simple reproduction and expanded reproduction, Marx pointed out:
 "Simple reproduction is part of the yearly reproduction on an expanded
 scale and in fact constitutes its most important part."  "The material
 basis for expanded reproduction is derived from the internal production of
 simple reproduction."  (Ibid., pp 457, 560)  All along simple reproduction
 has been an important constituent part and the basis of expanded reproduc-
 tion.  Moreover, viewed from the actual conditions of social production
 development, following the continuous increase in the base figure of pro-
 duction, the proportion occupied by simple reproduction in the expanded
 reproduction each year has grown continuously.  Hence, despite the fact that
 capital construction is intended mainly to serve expanded reproduction, it
 must also serve simple reproduction.  Take, for example, the case of coal
 production.  In a given period, certain old pits are bound to be abandoned.
 Prior to these old pits being reported abandoned, new pits must be built in
 time to replenish the gradually diminishing production capacity.   Since the
 building of new pits necessarily calls for a sizable amount of construction
 and installation work and may indeed involve a rather lengthy construction
 period, undoubtedly such new building work comes under the category of
 capital construction.  Yet it serves simple reproduction.  A similar state
 of affairs is found in production construction of the petroleum industry.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100310001-3
 Similarly, when natural disasters like earthquakes and floods ransack fixed
 assets including plants, mines, bridges, houses and the relevant machinery
 and equipment, all of which must be repaired, rebuilt or repurchased, the
 necessary recovery and construction work also constitute capital construc-
 tion and they first of all serve simple reproduction.  Hence, in capital
 construction, we should never overlook the construction projects necessary
 for the. maintenance of simple reproduction.
 Third, capital construction serves not only the development of production
 but also the improvement of the people's standard of living.  Concurrently
 with handling such production measures as the building of plants, mines,
 oilfields and electric power generating units, capital construction likewise
 engages in the building of houses and the public utilities that go with them
 as well as such nonproduction items as parks, theaters, hospitals and
 libraries.  All of the above serve the purposes of improving the material
 and cultural life of the people.  Marx' theory of reproduction tells us that
 the social reproduction process encompasses not only production but also
 consumption.  It includes not only consumption for production but also for
 the individual's. daily needs.  Social reproduction cannot progress smoothly
 if it is concerned with production only and not with consumption.  Capital
 construction is a category of economic activity which provides all produc-
 tion departments and nonproduction departments with fixed assets and serves
 both the development of production and improvement of the people's standard
 of living.  In the past, under the influence of "leftist" thought, fre-
 quently production was heavily stressed while living was lightly regarded
 and capital construction was taken as a means to serve the development of
 production only.  This was the cause of the imbalance between "bones" and
 "meat" and the fact that for a prolonged period of time, particularly with
 regard to the housing problem, the people's standard of living could not be
 improved.  Since the 3d Plenary Session of the 11th CCP Central Committee,
 this situation has undergone a great change.  With regard to capital con-
 struction, we should sum up our past experiences, follow Marx' theory on
 reproduction as the basis and in conjunction with the actual national con-
 ditions of our country, comprehensively arrange for production construction
 and for the people's life and in this way promote the all-round development
 of the four modernizations.

 CAN ROBOTS PRODUCE SURPLUS VALUE?
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82 pp 47-48
 [Article by Tan Huazhe [6223 5478 6568]]
 [Text]  The robot is developed on the technical basis of the manipulator
 and the operating machine after having absorbed certain of the latest
 scientific and technological achievements.   It is a new form of automatic
 device fitted with various types of machines, precision instruments and
 automatic computers and can do various jobs independently and automatically
 like a human being.  The robots now in use in industry can do only simple
 and repetitive tasks.  Certain countries are currently experimenting with
 the making of a new generation of robots which not only possess the power of
 mankind to see, feel, hear, write, compute and distinguish between tools and
 charts, but also can walk around at the plant site.  Although robots are
 more complicated than ordinary machines, and,are of a much higher grade,
 yet after all they are not human beings but mere machines.  Hence, in the
 hands of the capitalists, they belong to the category of fixed capital
 like other means of production.  In the production process all they can do
 is to transfer the original value to new products.   They cannot create new
 value or increase value.  The extensive use of various kinds of advanced
 technology and robots will greatly raise social labor productivity, achieve
 savings in man's labor input and reduce the required social labor time in the
 production of commodities.  In turn, this will lower the cost of the com-
 modities.
 People may ask:  With the capitalists using robots and the rise in labor
 productivity, there is a great reduction in employment.   Under such condi-
 tions, where does the large amount of surplus value reaped by the capital-
 ists come from?                      We say that this still comes from the labor of the hireling
 workers.
 First, under the capitalist system the phenomenon of machines squeezing out
 workers has long been in existence.  The appearance of the robot further
 intensifies this contradiction.  In certain departments and enterprise
 units, the increasing use of robots has caused a relative diminution in
 the number of workers, sometimes very extensive.  However, robots cannot
 completely replace the work of human beings.  On the one hand, robots are
 created and invented by human beings.  The study and making of robots, and

 continuously improving them to the stage, or near the stage,.of`'perfection
 require in themselves the input of a large amount of human labor.  For
 example, in the study and research.work on the making of robots, the
 Hitachi Electronics Company of Japan alone employed over 500 scientists and
 engineers, not counting a large number of trained workers and management
 personnel.  On the other hand,'no matter how advanced the robots have
 become, in the production process they require human labor for their con-
 trol, management and maintenance.  Even though some day it.will be possible
 to concentrate workers, technicians and management personnel into a main
 force to form a technological service center, this will represent a change
 in organization and structure and will not alter the substance of things.
 Some people connive at the idea of setting up a "factory without workers,"
 but in reality human beings cannot be dispensed with.  Separated from human
 beings and separated from the technical service center, the factory will, be
 paralyzed and the robots will become a pile of useless materials.  Thus,
 capitalists must continue to hire people and the surplus value reaped by,
 the capitalists can only have its source in the labor of the hired laborers.
 Second, under the conditions of socialized mass production, the definition
 of production personnel comprises a large number of engineering and tech,-
 nica . personnel, scientific and research workers directly related to pro-
 duction, and workers of the production command and of the control and
 management system.  Their labor is all production labor.  Marx put it very
 clearly:  "Following the development of the nature of coordination in the
 labor process, the concept of production labor and of production workers!
 will necessarily be expanded.  Taking part in production labor now does not
 necessitate doing the work itself.  Rather, being a part of the composite
 picture of workers and performing one relevant function only will be amply
 sufficient."  ("Collected Works of Marx and Engels," Vol 23, p 556)  The
 various categories of personnel mentioned above all constitute what Marx.
 described as the expanded "production workers."  Their labor input similarly
 creates value and surplus value.  Following a steady advance of science and
 technology, the proportion of manual laborers in the ranks of laborers has
 been steadily falling, while the proportion occupied by mental laborers has
 been steadily increasing.  Foreign statistical data show that under the con-
 dition of a low degree of mechanization, the ratio between manual laborers
 and mental laborers is 9 to 1, while under the condition of a medium degree
 of mechanization the ratio is 6 to 4 and under the condition of full auto-
 mation the ratio becomes 1 to 9.  Therefore, despite the progress of automa-
 tion and the use of robots and the decrease in the number of ordinary
 workers in certain departments or enterprise units, the number of their
 personnel engaged in complex labor work such as the scientists, engineers
 and technicians is increased.  As we all know, within the same given period
 .of time, complex labor creates much more value than simple labor.  In this
 way, in spite of a sizable decrease in the personnel employed by the capi-
 talists, they still manage to reap a large amount of surplus value.
 Lastly, under the conditions of the use of robots still not being common-
 place, those enterprises making use of robots can reap much larger profits
 .than the ordinary enterprises.  This is, because of the higher labor produc-
 tivity, lower labor input, shorter time taken in production than time

 required by society, and lastly the sale of their commodities at the pre-
 vailing market prices.  A portion or a great portion of the surplus profits
 of the enterprises is transferred from the surplus value created by workers
 of other enterprises. Robots do not constitute the source of income but
 the material conditions enabling these enterprises to gain larger income.
 Thus, that the use of robots can reap large surplus value does not mean
 that robots can create value and surplus value.  Rather, both value and
 surplus value are created by the labor of hired workers.  The progress in
 science and technology and the use of robots have by no means changed the
 basic reasoning of Marx' theory on the value of labor and his theory on
 surplus value.

 SEVERAL PRACTICES IN INTENSIVE FARMING
 Beijing RED FLAG in Chinese No 11, 1 Jun 82 inside back cover
 [Article by Wen Jianhu [2429 0256 5706]]
 [Text] Intensive farming means putting a fairly large quantity of means of
 production and labor force into a certain area of land with the application
 of science and technology so as to achieve high and stable yields per unit
 area.
 China has, a huge population but little arable land.  With its present xiela-
 tively weak economic strength, it is rather difficult for our country to
 put immense funds and huge amounts of energy into the total mechanization
 of agriculture and into efforts to promote the extensive use of chemical
 fertilizers and other farm chemicals in agriculture.  However, we can take
 advantage of our strong point of having available an abundance of labor
 and carry forward the tradition of intensive and meticulous farming, use
 more labor and apply more fertilizer to the fairly limited cultivable
 land, and try hard to increase the yield per unit area so as to boost total
 output and make production costs lower and lower.
 Some communes and brigades and specialized households in Hunan Province
 started developing intensive farming in the main according to the follow-
 ing procedures:
 1.  Practicing intensive cultivation and multicropping with both early and
 late maturing crops and raising the utilization rate of land.  Apart from
 continuous cropping and cultivation, in light of the principle of crop-
 plant symbiosis, they adopted intercropping, interplanting and mixed sowing,
 ingeniously mated long-stalked crops with short-stalked ones, vine crops
 with root-tuber ones, grain crops with leguminous ones, crops which demand
 light with those that grow in the shade and early-maturing crops with late-
 maturing ones and turned plane planting to three-dimensional planting.  In
 addition, they paid attention to rotation of paddy and nonirrigated-
 farmland crops and of crops and green manure so that the more the land was
 farmed, the richer its soil would become.  In recent years, the Pitai pro-
 duction team of You County, the Xiadafang production team of Liling County
 and the Shengli.production team of Liuyang County adopted these methods
 with the result that the per mu yield of paddy topped 2,000 jin and the per
 mu yield of paddy in specific years reached 2,300 to 2,400 jin.

 2.  Adopting intensive rearing and fully utilizing pens and barns and water
 surfaces.  In recent years, some localities have built double-deck pig
 houses and multideck batteries and rabbit cages and put space to full use.
 For instance, Huang Jianbai, a commune member of Shahe production brigade
 of Jinhuahu commune in Yiyang municipality, raised 56 pigs in 5.2 square
 meters of pigsties in 1981.  With .close breeding, there was little room for
 pigs to move about, thus reducing their consumption of calories.  A pig
 would eat only 1 jin of concentrated feed and 3 jin of coarse fodder per
 day but would produce 1 to 1.2 jin of pork.  In the whole year, the whole
 family only spent 0.8 of a labor force [as published] to raise pigs and
 sold a total of 4,327 jin of pork to the state.  Zhuzhou fish farm is
 another example.  In the last few years, it has imported advanced technology
 and bred fish in net cages on a trial basis.  The total output of fish came
 to 40,000 or 50,000 jin per mu, which was equal to about 100 mu of water
 surface for conventional fish breeding.  There are still some localities
 which breed fish and soft-shelled turtles or fish and pearls in a mixed
 way.  This method has brought them high per unit area yield, high output
 value and big results.  The average income per mu has been from 5,000 to
 6,000 yuan.
 3.  Developing a diversified economy., ensuring overall development and
 tapping the potential of natural and labor resources.  Xihu commune of
 Hengyang municipality practiced a three-in-one operation combining vege-
 table growing, pig raising and fish breeding.  Pigs were fed with vegetable
 roots and leaves; ponds were fertilized with pig dung; and vegetables were
 grown with pond silt.  As a result, a benign cycle of more vegetables, more
 pigs and more fish has gradually taken shape. Over the past few years,
 some communes and their subdivisions and specialized households have first
 used green manure as fodder to feed pigs, gone on to make methane with pig
 dung and weed, and then applied methane fertilizer to the farmland rather
 than directly applying green manure, thus obtaining fairly satisfactory
 economic results.  Xie Wankun of the Zhongzhou production team of Jiashui
 production brigade of Guankou commune in Liuyang County fed chickens with
 concentrated feed, fed pigs with the fermented feed made of chicken dung
 and grit, further used pig dung to raise earthworms and then fed chickens
 with earthworms.  In 1981, he and his wife used 5 rooms in their house to
 raise 180 setters and 2,200 broilers and sold 12,531 fresh eggs and 1,500
 broilers to the state.  They earned an annual income of 8,663 yuan or a net
 income of 2,250 yuan after deducting expenses.
 4.  Building small-sized agricultural engineering facilities to gradually
 convert some agricultural production links into factories [gongchanghua
 1562 1681 0553].  In recent years, a few communes and brigades, farms and
 centers and specialized households, which have conditions have begun to build
 small hothouses, plastic sheds, chicken-raising factories and fish-breeding
 factories and so on, and simulated the natural conditions to create suitable
 conditions so that agricultural production can be free from the restrictions
 of seasons and regions.  In its small hothouses and plastic sheds, the
 Dongtundu commune in Changsha adopted the method of multicrop interplanting
 and high-density cultivation to grow vegetables, thus prolonging the growth
 period on the one'hand and putting space to full use on the other.  At least

 20 jin of mushrooms were gathered every quarter on every square meter.  The
 per mu income from vegetables, of which most were high-yield varieties,
 was more than 2,000 yuan.
 .5.  Integrating traditional skills with modern science and manual labor with
 mecha ized operations.  For instance, in paddy production, some localities
 cross long-stalked varieties with short-stalked ones, practiced rational
 close planting, coupled scientific application of fertilizer with meticulous
 management and timely prevention and control of plant diseases and elimina-
 tion of pests, thus achieving stable and high yields.  In fish farming,
 some localities bred large species of fingerlings, rationally applied
 fertilizer and threw in bait, did'a good job in the prevention and cure of
 fish diseases, captured and seeded the fries in rotation in-good time and
 installed pressurized-oxygen machines to increase the supply of oxygen and
 boost the fish yield per unit of water surface area by a big margin, and
 so on.
