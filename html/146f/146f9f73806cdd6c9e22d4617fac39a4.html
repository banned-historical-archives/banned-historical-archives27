 Mao Tse-tung's voice is added to the expressions of support for
 Sihanouk's new "Royal Government of National Union" with the release
 of a statement on 20 Mny.  Declaring that "revolution is the main
 trend in the world today," Mao expresses "warm support" for Sihanouk's
 "fighting spirit" and for the Indochinese summit conference
 declaration.  Making no reference to aid, he repeats the standard
 Peking line that the Indochinese people, "strengthening their unity"
 and "persevering in a protracted people's war," will certainly win
 complete victory.  The statement notes pointedly that 10 days after
 its establishment the Cambodian government has been recognized by
 "nearly 20 countries."  Peking has not directly mentioned Soviet
 failure to extend recognition.
 The assertion in the IF May Soviet Government statement on Cambodia
 that the expansion of U.S. "aggression" in Indochina "makes even
 more pressing" the need for socialist unity is repeated in the 18 May
 PRAVDA editorial article, in the course of a comprehensive indictment
 of Chinese policies.  Routine Soviet comment, like PRAVDA, continues
 to score the PRC for failing to join in "united action" in support of
 Indochina.
 Brezhnev comments on the "aggravated" Southeast Asia situation in a
 message to an international front conference in Cairo "in support of
 the Laotian people's struggle."  Noting that "the insolent intrusion"
 of U.S. and Saigon troops into Cambodia extended the "aggression"
 into all of Indochina, he states that "peace-loving arid democratic
 forces" must rally their ranks closer to end the U.S. "criminal war."
 He also declares that the USSR is rendering the Indochinese people
 "all-round support and assistance."
 A passage in DRV Premier Pam Van Dong's 18 May Hanoi speech commemorating
 Ho Chi Minh's birth anniversary could reflect concern over the continuing
 Sino-Soviet polemic.  In a catalogue of Ho's virtues, Dong calls him
 the "clearest embodiment of proletarian internationalism," then quotes
 the passage in IIo's lust will and testament on his pain at the present
 discord among fraternal parties and his certainty of eventual unity.
 In the first comment by a top DRV leader, Dong calls the U.S. "massive
 aggression" against Cambodia an "extremely impudent challenge."  He
 reiterates the pledge of solidarity of the three Indochinese countries
 but does not mention that the DRV has recognized the new "Royal
 Government of National Unio~," noting only that "the Cambodian people"
 have warmly welcomed the setting up of leading organs of the FUNK
 and the new government.
 DRV COMMENTATORS DISCUSS SITUATION IN CAMBODIA, INDOCHINA
 In addition to b*.i;tle reports of successes of the "Khmer liberation
 armed forces," DRV media in the past 10 days have carried articles

 allied operations in some detail.     The U.S.-South Vietnam objective of
 clearing out Vietnamese communist sanctuaries in Cambodia continues to
 be generally ignored, although a commentary attributed to "Chien Binh"
 (combatant), broadcast by Hanoi radio on 10 May, does say that the
 Khmer people's property is being destroyed "under the pretext of
 looking for communist headquarters."
 A 14 May QUAN DOI NHAN DAN article attributed to one Tran Phu, broadcast
 by Hanoi radio, calls the Cambodian operations "a repetition of
 the failure of the 'Junction City' military operation three years
 ago on a far larger scale."  The article does not identify Junction
 City as a search-and-destroy operation, however.  A 13 May QUAN DOI
 NHAN DAN article by "True Chien" (hand-to-hand combat), broadcast by
 Hanoi the same day, says that "after only a few days" the allies
 admitted that their Cambodian operations were "unsuccessful," had,
 achieved "only poor results," and "could not attain the set objectives."
 The article does not indicate what these objectives are, saying merely
 that the allied forces "cannot save the Lon Nol-Matak clique from
 danger."
 Stating that the allied thrusts have been "on a 400-kilometer-long
 battlefront from the northeastern part to the southeastern part of
 Cambodia," the Truc Chien article goes into unusual detail regarding
 the operations:  on 30 April 12,000 ARVN soldiers with U.S. support
 moved against the Parrot's Beak area of Svay Rieng Province; the
 Fishhook operation commenced on 2 May with 10,000 men from the 1st
 U.S. Air Cavalry Division, the 11th U.S. Armored Regiment, and units
 of the ARVN 5th Division; on the 5th, a third offensive was launched
 with 6,000 men of the U.S. 4th and ARVN 22d divisions, helilifted
 from Pleiku Province in South Vietnam into Ratanakiri Province; on
 the 6th, a fourth drive began with some 4,000 men mainly from the
 U.S. 25th Division attacking an area of Prey Veng-Kompong Cham
 provinces, and on the same day "two other offensives" were launched
 in the northern part of the Fishhook area; on the 9th, there were
 two new attacks by the U.S. 25th Division in the Parrot's Beak and
 Fishhook areas, as well as the launching of the allied naval
 expedition up the Mekong River.
 Truc Chien asserts tt.,.at the "patriotic Cambodian armed forces" have been
 activated ;.nd are "rapidly" developing in Ratanakiri, Mondolkiri,
 Kratie, Kompong Cham, Svay Rieng, Prey Veng, Kandal, Takeo, Kampot,
 Siem Reap, and Battambang provinces.  (Sihanouk's message to the
 armed forces on the 12th claimed that a large part of the population
 had been "freed from the control of the Lon Nol administration in
 13 provinces, including Battambang.")

 Claiming that allied forces are being rebuffed throughout Indochina,
 Truc Chien cites "victories" achieved during April in South Vietnam
 and Laos, noting specifically the seizure on the 28th of Attopeu in
 lower Laos near the Cambodian-South Vietnamese border.  He calls
 this a reflection of the "close coordination" of the Lao-Khmer-
 Vietnamese struggles.  An unsigned QUAN DOI NHAN DAN article on the
 same day also singles out the "liberation" of Attopeu by the
 "Lao armed forces and people" in reviewing the April "victories"
 in Indochina.
 The Chien Binh commentary broadcast on the 10th discusses what the
 author calls "Nixon's five errors in Indochina"--the move into
 Cambodia, the reliance on a failing Vietnamization program, the
 1969 attacks in the Plain of Jars area of Laos, the overthrow of
 Sihanouk, and "blind reliance" on the policy of using force to
 achieve a position of strength in Vietnam.  Chien Binh claims that
 the United States has never been more isolated politically, with
 "all mankind," except for some U.S. "lackeys" in Thailand, South
 Korea, and South Vietnam, opposed to the moves.
 BATTLE      Vietnamese communist media continue to report "Khmer
 REPORTS     liberation armed forces" successes in Cambodia, with
 VNA and LPA recounting action in Svay Rieng, Prey Veng,
 Kompong Speu, Kratie, Mondolkiri, and Kompong Cham provinces.  VNA
 claimed on the 17th that Khmer liberation forces were in "complete
 control" of Stung Treng provincial capital,* and on the 19th VNA
 reported the "liberation" of Siem Pang district capital in Stung
 Treng Province.
 A Liberation Radio commentary on 19 May, reviewing "two months of
 glorious victories of the Cambodian armed forces and people," takes
 brief note of the action arotzd Kompong Cham city, but there is no
 reference to its changing hands.  The commentary claims that the
 Cambodian liberation forces "annihilated more than 1,900 enemy troops"
 in action around Kompong Cham and Mimot.
 CAMBODIAN FRONT OFFICIALS REPORT TO SIHANOUK ON SITUATION
 The situation in Cambodia is also discussed in a 10 May message to
 Sihanouk by Khieu Samphan, Hou Youn, and Hu Nim--the three individuals
 said to be in Cambodia as government ministers and officials of the
 National United Front of Kampuchea (FUNK).  As released by Sihanouk's
 secretariat in Peking and disseminated by NCNA on the 18th, the
 message claims that "our armed forces" have to date "liberated
 *  Sihanouk in his 12 May message to the armed forces had claimed the
 "capture" of Stung Treng, as well as Kratie, Senmonorom, and Chhouk.

 numerous towns and cities in the provinces of the northeast and south-
 east, northwest and southwest; the capital Phnom Penh is being
 menaced from all sides."
 The message adds that the people in the "liberated" areas have
 elected FUNK committees and "organs of power at different levels
 and are ardently and enthusiastically making voluntary contributions
 both in manpower and materials to the great cause of national
 resistance."  The three functionaries also express their thanks to
 Sihanouk for their election to the FUNK CenLcal Committee's
 Political Bureau and the government and for "entrusting us to
 manage all the affairs of the country and mobilize our people to
 fight the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys."
 DELEGATES AT 14 MAY PARIS SESSION STRESS "ESCALATION" OF WAR
 The VNA account of the 66th session of the Paris talks on 14 May notes
 that the PRG and DRV delegations had postponed the 66th session, which
 should have been convened on the 6th, until the 14th in order to
 "protest against the repeated U.S. bombing raids on North Vietnam"
 on 1, 2, 3, and 4 May.
 VNA's account of the allied presentations says that GVN delegation
 head Phani Dang Lam "advanced absurd contentions and shamelessly
 slandered the DRV in an attempt to justify American-Saigon 'puppet'
 troops' overt aggression against Cambodia."  U.S. delegate Habib,
 according to VNA, "again tried to sell the so-called 'good will'"
 of the Nixon Administration and to defend it "in face of the storm
 of public anger in the world and in the United States against its
 dragging out the aggressive war in South Vietnam, escalating the
 war in Laos, and overtly sending American and Saigon puppet troops
 to invade Cambodia, which have led to the expansion of the war to the
 whole of Indochina."  VNA ignores Habib's references to the
 President's remarks on working for peace and says only that the U.S.
 delegate "brazenly slandered the Vietnamese people and threatened that
 the United States would take 'appropriate action,' meaning to further
 intensify and widen the aggressive war against the Indochinese peoples."
 V NA reports that deputy head delegate of the PRG Dinh Ba Thi,
 speaking third, ridiculed the notion that the President's decision
 to send troops into Cambodia would assist the U.S. troop withdrawal
 program.  It says Thi also refuted the "shopworn allegation"
 that a U.S. withdrawal woulc allow the massacre of millions of
 innocent civilians and charged that it is the United States and
 "its lackeys" who kill civilians.

 Recalling that the NFLSV had put forth its 10-point solution on
 8 May a year ago, Thi said that at his 8 May press conference the
 President had "once again opposed the legitimate demands of the
 Vietnamese people and uttered insolent threats."
 DRV delegate Nguyen Minh Vy, "analyzing Nixon's recent deeds in
 Indochina and his recent statements, especially in his 30 April speech
 and 8 May press conference, laid bare the bellicose nature, the
 obstinate and perfidious attitude" of the Nixon Administration,
 according to VNA.  He charged that since it assumed office, the
 Nixon Administration has never really meant to peacefully settle
 the Vietnam problem but "has always nurtured the illusion of gaining
 a military victory and of negotiating from a position of strength."
 Vy pointed out, the VNA account says, that the United States has
 committed itself "totally and unconditionally" to stopping the bombings
 of the DRV--a commitment which led to the convening of the Paris
 conference.  Repeating the allegation that the recent May bombings
 of the DRV have "seriously jeopardized the work of the Paris
 conference," Vy said that "if the United States continued the bombings
 the DRV delegation would feel compelled to draw the necessary
 conclusions" and the United States "must bear full responsibility
 for the grave consequences" arising from its acts.  (Although not
 reported by VNA, PRG delegate Thi also said the escalation of the
 war to Cambodia and the early May air attacks against the DRV
 "directly threaten" the Paris talks.)
 The DRV delegate echoed Thi in rejecting the President's explanation
 of U.S. moves and said that "nobody sees any sigi tha, Nixon is
 going to confine the invasion of U.S. and Saigon puppet - troops"
 within his stated limits.  Vy saw clear evidence of this in "the
 operation of over 100 warships with thousands of U.S. and Saigon
 troops on board sailing up the Mekong River to Phnom Penh and
 Kompong Cham on 11 and 12 May," the statements by Nguyen Van Thieu
 and Nguyen Cao Ky indicating that there should be no limitations to
 GVN troop operations in Cambodia, and the mobilization of the GVN
 navy with the participation of the Seventh Fleet for an "illegal
 blockade" of Cambodia.
 MAO TSE-TUNG SUPPORTS CANEODIAN, INDOCHINESE STRUGGLES
 Mao Tse-tung's 20 May statement on Cambodia and Indochinese developments
 seems designed to make propaganda capital of widespread opposition to
 recent U.S. military moves and to draw attention to standard :Taoist
 doctrines on revolutionary struggle.  While the statement is pegged
 to the "revolutionary armed struggle" in Indochina, it also expresses

 20 MAY 1970
 the Chinese people's support for the current "revolutionary struggle"
 in America as well as struggles and national liberation movements
 worldwide.
 Declaring cryptically that the danger of a new world war still
 exists, Mao's statement adds:  "but revolution is the main trend of
 the world today."  It goes on to repeat the characterization of U.S.
 imperialism as a paper tiger and to declare that "a weak nation
 can defeat a strong, a small nation can defeat a big."
 The passage on world war and. revolution is a gloss on a Mao statement
 released in Lin Piao's report to the CCP Congress in April 1969.
 Lin quoted Mao as saying regarding the possibility of world war that
 there are "but two possibilities"--either a war will give rise to
 revolution or revolution will prevent war.  The effect of Mao's
 present gloss on this doctrine is to underscore the efficacy of local
 protracted struggles and to play down the dangers of a larger
 conflagration.
 Peking's motive for issuing the statement at this particular time is
 unclear, though the timing may be related to the fact that 20 May
 is the date on which a session of the Sino-U.S. talks in Warsaw was
 scheduled to be held.  An NCNA announcement the day before said the
 Warsaw meeting had been cancelled in protest against U.S. actions in
 Cambodia.  Taken together, the cancellation and the release of the
 Mao statement seem calculated to underscore Peking's support for
 Sihanouk and other Indochinese forces and implicitly to accuse the
 Soviets of lagging behind by not recognizing Sihanouk's new government.
 BACKGROUND     The statement is the first to be issued by Mao since
 the 16 April 1968 statement that followed the assassination
 of Martin Luther King.  Mao declared then that the assassination had
 shown black people that the philosophy of nonviolence is bankrupt,
 and he linked the Negro struggle to the worldwide one against American
 "imperialism."  Mao had issued a statement on U.S. "racial
 discrimination" on 8 August 1963, and similar statements over the
 next year and a half dealt with the "people's struggles" in South
 Vietnam, Panama, the Congo (Leopoldville), and the Dominican Repu;lic.
 A 29 August 1963 statement expressing Chinese support for struggle in
 South Vietnam--which was pegged to Ngo Dinh Diem's "repressive measures"
 against Buddhists and others--included a reference to U.S. "violations"
 of the 1951+ and 1962 Geneva agreements and declared:  "Apart from those
 who are deliberatea.ly deceiving the people or are utterly naive, no
 one will believe that a piece of paper called a treaty will make U.S.
 imperialism lay down its butcher's knife and become a Buddha at once,
 or behave a little better."

 PEKING NOTES PRESIDENTS REMARKS ON DIPLOMATIC INITIATIVES
 Available current Peking comment does not repeat the direct charge
 that the USSR is colluding with the United States in Indochina, but
 a measure of the effort to keep the notion alive is evident in a
 13 May NCNA comment on the President's press conference of the 8th.
 Unlike Moscow and Hanoi, NCNA acknowledges the President's comments
 on diplomatic initiatives, quoting him as saying "we are exploring
 with the Soviet Union .  . . , with Great Britain,' and with
 participants in the 'conference of Asian countries' sponsored by
 the Indonesian fascist regime and 'through every possible channel'
 methods to see that the 'neutrality' of Cambodia and Laos is
 'guaranteed.'"  NCNA thus inserted ellipses where the President
 remarked that the explorations with the Soviet Union had met "with
 not too much success to date."  NCNA routinely calls the President's
 comments on diplomacy "another counterrevolutionary tactic."
 The 18 May CCP Central Committee message to the VWP Central Committee
 on the occasion of Ho Chi Minh's birth anniversary predicts that the
 Vietnamese, Lao, and Cambodian peoples "will unite closely" in
 their struggle.  And it adds:  "whether U.S. imperialism continues
 to expand the war, use its accomplices or lackeys to serve its
 aims, or intervenes or conducts sabotage through the United Nations
 or any other international conference, it and its lackeys cannot
 save themselves from complete defeat."
 CALL FOR SOCIALIST UNITY REPEATED BY PRAVDA, CEMA STATEMENT
 Moscow's continued call for socialist unity in the face of U.S.
 "aggression" in Indochina is expressed authoritatively in the
 18 May PRAVDA editorial article which replies to Chinese attacks
 on the Lenin centenary.*  PRAVDA recalls the assertion in the
 i May Soviet Government statement that the expansion of U.S.
 aggression in Indochina "makes even more pressing the need for unity
 and greater co'.iesion" of the socialist, anti-imperialist, and
 peace-loving forces.  The article adds that this position is
 shared by the "fraternal countries of socialism and the Marxist-
 Leninist parties of the whole world."
 Delivering a broadside at Chinese policy in Asia, PRAVDA says
 that using Peking's logic "it would be better for the peoples
 struggling against imperialism to be isolated from the main

 revolutionary force of our time and to be left face to face with a
 strong and cunning enemy."  Charging that Peking thus demonstrates that
 it does not intend to take concerted action with the USSR and other
 socialist countries against the imperialists, the article sees the
 latest events in Indochina as added proof that Peking's stand
 "encourages the imperialists."
 Routine comment in Moscow's Mandarin-language broadcasts on the eve
 of the editorial article's appearance continued the charges of the
 past few weeks that President Nixon's decision to "escalate" the
 Indochina war was related to the Chinese refusal to take united
 action on Vietnam.
 CEMA STATEMENT     A statement on Indochina adopted by the CEMA
 countries at their 12-14 May meeting in Warsaw,
 carried by TASS on the 14th, repeats the standard call for "closer
 cohesion of the socialist countries on the basis of the principles
 of Marxism-Leninism."  Like the 4 May Soviet Government statement,
 it says that all states that treasure peace and freedom "must show
 great responsibility for further developments of events and must
 show determination to help rebuff the aggressor."  In decrying
 intensified U.S. aggression against Cambodia, Laos, and the DRV,
 the CEMA statement seems to go a step further than the Soviet
 Government statement when it warns that the spread of aggression
 in Indochina "not only aggravated the situation in Southeast Asia
 but also led to the worsening of the overall international situation
 and jeopardized the solution of many outstanding international
 problems."  The Soviet statement said only that the U.S. intrusion
 in Cambodia "may result in further complication of the general
 international situation."
 EUROPEAN CP CONFERENCE APPEALS FOR UNITED ACTION
 Increased support for the Indochinese peoples' struggle in the wake
 of U.S. "escalation" was discussed at the Paris meeting on 15 May
 of representatives of 18 communist parties of European capitalist
 countries.  The conference issued a joint appeal and sent a letter
 of support to the VWP, NFLSV, NLHX, and FUNK.  VNA carries the
 documents textually, and they are summarized by TASS.
 The appeal declares that the parties participating in the conference
 "will contribute to the strengthening of the unity of action of
 the international communist movement, believing that the common
 action of all the communist and workers' parties will facilitate the
 victorious rallying of all anti-imperialist forces."  It adds that
 in view of the urgent and serious situation, the parties call for

 "the strengthening of unity and for a more and more resolute and
 sustained action against the extension of the war, and for the
 withdrawal of U.S. forces from Indochina."  The parties address
 themselves in particular to "workers and their organizations,
 socialist parties, Christians, and students."
 The letter to the Indochinese parties and fronts reports the European
 parties' decision to further develop "political, moral, and material
 isupport" for the Indochinese struggle, to demand speedy, total, and
 t.nconditional U.S. troop withdrawal, and to increase pressure on
 the governments of the capitalist countries of Europe to condemn
 U.S. aggression.  Days of action and solidarity will take place
 in Europe, it says, which will contribute to the "political
 isolation" of the Nixon Administration and back the antiwar movement
 in the United States itself.
 ELEVEN-NATION DJAKARTA CONFERENCE ON CAMBODIA SCORED
 STATEMENT BY         The 16-17 May Djakarta meeting of the foreign
 SIHANOUK REGIME      ministers of 11 Asian nations on the Cambodian
 situation prompts a statement on the 17th from
 Sihanouk's "Royal Government of National Union" which "strongly"
 condemns the gathering as "grave interference in Cambodian internal
 affairs and a naked violation of Cambodian sovereignty."  As
 transmitted by NCNA, the statement says the composition of the
 Djakarta conference reveals the meeting to be an undertaking
 "inspired and maneuvered" by the United States, since four of the
 participants are U.S. "lackeys" and the remainder are "closely
 subordinated" to the United States.*
 The statement declares that if the conference were "really" concerned
 with Cambodian independence and neutrality, the conferees "should
 in the first place condemn the United States and its lackeys for
 this open aggression against the sovereignty of a member state of
 the United Nations."  The Cambodian problem, it adds, can be "easily
 settled" by the Cambodian people themselves after the immediate
 and complete withdrawal of U.S. and "lackey" troops from Cambodia.
 The statement also expressed thanks to countries which refused to
 participate in the conference and singles out Burma, India, Pakistan,
 Ceylon, Afghanistan, and Nepal in this regard.  It does not mention
 that the PRC and other Asian communist countries were also invited.
 *  The participants were Australia, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea,
 Laos, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
 and South Korea, with Cambodia attending as an observer.

 Although it was transmitted by NCNA some 12 hours after the Djakarta
 conference communique was released, the statement fails to acknowledge
 any of the substance of the communique.
 PEKING     Chinese reaction to the "sinister" Djakarta meeting comes
 on the 20th with an NCNA report and a PEOPLE'S DAILY
 Commentator article.  NCNA notes that the communique "pretentiously"
 calls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Cambodia and
 for the respect by all parties of Cambodia's independence, sovereignty,
 neutrality, and territorial integrity and denounces these statements
 as a "deliberate attempt to mislead the people and absolve U.S.
 imperialism from its crime of invasion of Cambodia."  The PEOPLE'S
 DAILY article scornfully dismisses the conferees' call for respect
 for Cambodian independence as "downright ridiculous."
 The NCNA dispatch also notes the communique's "clamor" for "a 'peaceful
 solution'" to the Cambodia question by convening an international
 conference and reactivating the ICC through consultations between a
 three-nation committee--Japan, Malaysia, and Indonesia--and the 1951E
 Geneva conference co-chairmen, "etc."  These appeals, NCNA says, are
 no more than attempts to raise the signboard of a "'peaceful solution"'
 in order "to serve U.S. imperialism in its aggression against Cambodia
 and the expansion of its aggressive ',gar in Indochina."  NCNA neglects
 to mention that the other mission of the three-nation committee is
 to contact the UN officials to seek UN action on Cambodia.  But
 PEOPLE'S DAILY does note that the three-nation committee is "to link
 up" with the United Nations, which "everyone knows" is "manipulated
 by U.S. imperialism" and which has "no right to interfere in Cambodia's
 affairs."  The Commentator article, unlike the earlier NCNA report,
 fails to cite the communique's call for an international conference
 and reactivation of the ICC.
 Both the PEOPLE'S DAILY article and the NCNA dispatch shower abuse
 on the conference participants, particularly on Japan and Indonesia.
 The article calls the participants a "gang of vassals, accomplices, and
 puppets of U.S. imperialism."  The dispatch adds that "some Asian
 countries boycotted and did not attend the conference," but NCNA does
 not name any countries and thus does not acknowledge that the PRC
 was among those invited.
 HANOI AND FRONT     A NHAN DAN commentary on the 20th, as summarized by
 VNA, says the conference "dared not lift a finger
 to condemn the U.S. aggression" in Cambodia and instead "took up
 the U.S. plans of using the United Nations.nd other international
 organizations and conferences to plead for the United States and
 legalize the aggressive acts of the United States and its henchmen."

 NHAN DAN thus suppresses the fact that the communique urged reactivation
 of the ICC.  But it takes note of the communique's call for respect for
 Cambodia's sovereignty, neutrality, and territorial integrity arid
 for the withdrawal of "'foreign troops" from Cambodia, "and so on,"
 commenting that these statements cannot conceal the "dirty scheme
 of the U.S. aggressors."  On the 19th a brief VNA report cites the
 communique's "dark scheme" of hoping to use the United Nations
 "to interfere in Cambodia so as to lend a hand to the Lori Nol-Matak
 clique in opposing the patriotic movement of the Khmer people,"
 VNA mentions neither the communique's reference to an international
 conference nor its reference to reactivation of the ICC.
 In advance of the meeting in Djakarta, DRV and PRG media carried a
 number of denunciatory press and radio commentaries, and both issued
 foreign ministry statements.  The DRV statement, issued on the loth,
 notes that "with the exception of a handful of lackeys and satellites
 of the United States," the Asian countries have refused to participate
 in the conference.  "Obviously," the statement contends, the meeting
 is "intended to serve U.S. aggression in Cambodia."  It says that "the
 Vietnamese people and DRV Government sternly condemn the so-called
 'Asian Conference on Cambodia' and declare that all resolutions and
 recommendations adopted by it are illegal and null and void."  The
 PRG statement, issued the next day, similarly declares any decision
 by the conference "null and void."  It lists the participants,
 describing their political complexions and terming the meeting a
 "brazen intervention in the internal affairs of the Khmer people, and
 at the same time a step of preparation for deeper involvement by the
 U.S. satellites in the U.S. war of aggression against the Indochinese
 peoples."
 MOSCOW     The first Soviet acknowledgment of the substance of the
 conference communique 'comes in an 18 May English-language
 broadcast which says it contains a4'hypocritical appeal for an
 immediate cease-fire in Cambodia."  The broadcast  also says that
 the communique advocates immediate reconvening of the 1951 Geneva
 conference--a step which is "untimely as long as Cambodia is
 occupied by American troops."  This line is echoed in a Radio
 Peace and Progress commentary, broadcast in English on the same day,
 which adds that "an immediate cease-fire at a time when Cambodian
 resistance is growing against the American-Saigon troops would be
 advantageous only for Washington and the forces that support it in
 Phnom Penh."

 A dispatch by `PASS Commentator Kharkov on the 18th acknowledges none
 of the substance of the "lengthy" communique but remarks that it
 "abounds in much too abstract calls which offer no effective measures
 in connection with the extremely grave situation in Cambodia."
 Kharkov claims that the communique amounts to an "encouragement
 of the U.S. aggressive actions" and that from it an American
 behi.rid- the-so cene presence in Djakarta is "rather easily discernible."
 MILITARY SITUATION IN SOUTH VIETNAM
 There are scattered reports of current military activity throughout
 South Vietnam, with the focus on engagements in areas north of
 Saigon to the DMZ.  PLAF military action in the Central Trung Bo
 area during the early April upsurge in fighting draws praise in a
 QUAN DOI NIIAN DAN article of the 15th, which singles out the
 "repeated attacks" against Da Nang, Qui Nhon, Nha Trang, and Cam
 Ranh port.  A NIIAN DAN commentary of the 20th, carried the same
 day by Hanoi radio, praises the liberation forces' activity in the
 Nam Do Delta area since early April in their emulation drive to
 commemorate IIo Chi Minh's 80th birth anniversary.  A Hanoi radio
 commentary on the 18th also reports instances throughout the South
 of PLAF military achievements in the emulation drive.
 The GVN's declaration of a cease-fire on 18 May to mark Buddha's
 birthday prompts no Vietnamese communist comment.   The communists
 took no such initiative this year, although they had marked the
 anniversaries with cease-fires last year and in 1967.  In 1968, in
 the wake of the Tet offensive, there was no cease-fire declaration
 by either side.

 HO CHI MINH'S EIGHTIETH BIRTH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATED
 NORTH        The 8Oth anniversary of lie Chi Minh':i birth on 19 May
 VIETNAM      is marked by Ilanoi with a meeting sponsored by the
 party, government, and Fatherland Front, editorials
 in the press, and the publication of a biography of Ho and a
 collection of his i0important" speeches and articles.  The meeting,
 held on the 18th, was attended by all the members of the party
 Politburo except Pham Hung and Hoang Van 1loan.  (Roan appeared as
 recent]-; as 6 May at a V-E Day meeting.)  President Ton Duc Thang
 delivered the inaugural speech at the meeting and Premier Pharr
 Van Dong gave the main address.
 In his broad-ranging address, carried by VNA on the 18th and 19th,
 Pharr Van Dong lauds Ho as a successor to Lenin and Marx and
 enumerates his virtues as a person and a revolutionary.  Ile also
 claims that "the revolutionary line and strategy of President Ho
 and our party are the development of the Marxist-Leninist theory,
 a worthy contribution to the treasure of experience of the world
 revolution."
 Discussing the party's strategic line, Dong says that it is "first
 and foremost a strategy of offensive" but adds that it is also "a
 strategy of persistent, protracted, staunch, indomitable, and
 thorough struggle."  This dual guideline has been similarly spelled
 out in other Vietnamese statements in the last several months, as
 has Dong's injunction that "we must apply the strategy of protracted
 fight to gain strength and win more and more victories as we fight."
 Dong adds that the strategy requires a struggle on three fronts--
 political, military, and diplomatic--"with emphasis to be laid on this
 or that front depending on the circumstances of time and place,
 driving the enemy more and more into a difficult and passive position,
 hence to repel him step by step, defeat him part by part, before
 winning total victory over him."
 Pharr Van Dong echoes periodic statements since Ho's death which
 have characterized the party leadership as "collective."  He
 declares. that "the collective leadership of our party at present
 comprises the disciples, comrades, and companions-in-arms of
 President Ho Chi Minh, who for dozens of years now have united and
 fought around him as one man . . . ."
 In touching on North Vietnamese domestic achievements, Dong
 concentrates on the problems of management and organization--an
 area of concern which was similarly stressed by Le Duan in his
 14 February article on the party's anniversary.  The "most
 essential thing" for further achievements in the North, according

 to Dorig, is to "know how to manage and organize."        lie declares that
 "In the management of the national economy and the people's life,
 we must make fundamental and all-round calculations, which must
 have big and long-term strategic significance and at the same time
 mutt be very concrete and practical."  He says that these
 calculations must be reflected in state plans--long-term as well
 a  annual--and he notes that "to lead the struggle for the
 realization of a plan requires organizational capacities together
 with managerial capacities, which are very necessary to all of us,
 first of all to the responsible comrades in state organs."  Hanoi
 propaganda routinely calls for efforts to fulfill the 1970 plan,
 but has not in recent months noted that the 1970 plan concludes
 a three-year plan begun in 1968.  While other comment, like Pham
 Van Dong, has stressed the importance of long-range planning, the
 propaganda has not indicated whether a new plan for more than one
 year will be put into effect after 1970.
 SOUTH        Liberation Radio on 18 May reports that a joint PRG-
 VIETNAM                             NFLSV-Alliance meeting was held that day in a "liberated
 area" to mark Ho's birthday.   Chief among those reported
 present was PRG President Huynh Tan Phat, who delivered the main
 address.  Routinely pledging to step up the general offensive to
 defeat the United States and overthrow the GVN, Phat declares that
 the "South Vietnamese compatriots and combatants will express their
 profound remembrance of President Ho .through an emulation movement
 for fulfilling all tasks set forth by the NFLSV and PRG for 1970,
 especially for this spring-summer, and through their unshakable
 determination to win complete victory."
 Both LIBERATION PRESS AGENCY (LPA) and Liberation Radio on 19 May
 carry a 17 May joint NFLSV-PRG message from Nguyen Huu Tho and
 Huynh Tan Phat to DRV leaders "expressing the South Vietnamese
 people's gratitude to President Ho Chi Minh" on the occasion of
 his 80th birthday.  The message, addressed to Ton Due Thang, Le Duan,
 Truong Chinh, and Pham Van Dong, praises Ho's contributions to the
 Vietnamese people's revolutionary cause.   It routinely claims
 "unprecedented and all-round victories" since the spring of 1968,
 charges that the United States is "very obstinate, bellicose and
 tricky," and scores the Nixon Administration for its Vietnamization
 program, for escalation of the war in Laos, and for staging the
 coup against Sihanouk and invading Cambodia.
 Additional attention to the anniversary includes a 12 May special
 communique, broadcast by the Front on the 13th, from the NFLSV
 Central Committee and the PRG.  A message was sent from Vietnam
 Alliance chairman Trinh Dinh Thao, and LPA on the 18th carries
 an LPA memorial editorial on Ho.

 PEKING     NCNA and Peking radio on 18 May publicize the message from
 the Central Committee of the CCP to the Central Committee
 of the Vietnam Workers' Party commerating H''s 80th birth anniversary.
 The message eulogizes Ho as an "outstanding proletarian revolutionary"
 who dedicated "his whole life to the cause of national liberation of
 Vietnam and to the cause of communism."  It notes that during China's
 "revolutionary civil war and war of resistance against Japan," Ho
 visited China "many times, shared weal and woe with the Chinese people
 and fought shoulder to shoulder with them."  It says he "forged a
 profound militant friendship with the Communist Party of China and
 the Chinese people," and that he "made important contributions to
 the world proletariat."
 NCNA on the 19th reports the "grand meeting" held in Hanoi the
 previous day to celebrate the anniversary and on the 18th it carries
 a version of the 12 May NFLSV-PRG -,pecial communique.
 MOSCOW     The Ho anniversary is noted in Moscow press and radio
 comment and marked by a meeting of the directorate of the
 Soviet-Vietnamese Friendship Society, but there was no official
 Soviet message.  PRAVDA on the 19th, according to TASS, carries
 a detailed biography of Ho and comments that he was a "true
 internationalist and Leninist who regarded friendship with the
 Soviet people and their Communist Party as an earnest of success
 for the whole of the socialist community."  The paper notes that
 Ho "enjoined the Vietnamese communists to continue his cause and
 make a worthy contribution toward strengthening and developing
 friendship and cooperation between socialist countries, toward
 strengthening the unity of the entire international communist and
 working class movement."
 DRV COUNCIL OF MINISTERS RESOLUTION ON GRAIN POLICY
 A resolution on the stabilization of grain distribution and the
 sale of grain to the state, reportedly issued at a 3 March plenary
 session of the Council of Ministers, is broadcast by Hanoi radio on
 15 May.  The broad goals of the new grain policy spelled out in the
 resolution are to boost grain production; to uphold the "self-
 sufficiency spirit" in solving grain problems--overcoming dependence
 on the state and imports and stimulating agricultural-cooperatives
 to solve their own grain needs; "to correctly implement the
 principle of distribution to labor within cooperatives"--he who
 works eats; to strengthen state management of grain distribution
 through the country--including the elimination of waste,
 speculation, and theft from the state; and to strengthen and
 consolidate the worker-peasant alliance--an effort to stimulate
 the flow of industrial products to cooperatives and grain from
 the cooperatives to the workers.

 As a basic measure to stabilize the sale of grain, the resolution
 stipulates that the state will, fix the norm which the peasants
 must sell to the state based on the results of three harvest yields
 from 1963 through 1969--the most abundant, average, and poorest.
 This norm will not be raised for five years, from 1970 to 1974, and
 any increase in production will be retained by the cooperatives
 and the peasants, who will be free to dispose of it by developing
 husbandry or selling it to the state or to those short of grain.
 The day after the broadcast of the resolution, Hanoi radio carries
 excerpts of a talk by Le Thanh Nghi, said to have been given at a
 "March conference of local officials," discussing implementation
 of the new policy.  Observing that in the past the party and
 government have laid down many policies concerning food, Nghi goes
 on to discuss some of the weak points of the policy on collection
 and distribution of food "which appeared during the struggle
 against the war of destruction."*  These shortcomings, according
 to Nghi, result in lessened enthusiasm for production and
 consciousness of the "duty to sell food to the state."  He also
 says that there has been a tendency to rely on the state and that,
 a free market in food has been observed.  He explains that this
 situation has caused the state to experience difficulties in
 balancing food supply and demand.
 *  An article on grain management and distribution by To Duy,
 deputy director of the Department of Finance and Trade, which
 appeared in NHAN DAN in August 1968, noted that the Secretariat
 had passed Directive 149 in April 1968 on changing the direction
 of grain distribution during wartime, and Decision 1,79 in June
 1968 on the task of unifying the management and distribution of
 grain within the state and agricultural cooperatives.

 PRAVDA EDITORIAL ARTICLE REBUTS CHINESE POLEMICAL ATTACKS
 A PRAVDA editorial article on 18 May--the first commentary on China
 on this authoritative level since 28 August 1969--presents Moscow's
 most comprehensive indictment of Chinese policies since the opening
 of the Peking talks and appears to negate any current prospects of
 a Sino-Soviet accommodation based on united action.  The article is
 responsive to Peking's equally authoritative joint editorial attacking
 the Soviets on the Lenin centenary across a wide range of domestic
 and foreign issues.  It ends a period of relative Soviet restraint
 on China, during which North Vietnamese party chief Le Duan spent
 three weeks traveling between Moscow and Peking as well as visiting
 Poland.*  PRAVDA indicates that the Soviets see no hope that their
 dispute with the Chinese can be muted in the name of united action,
 citing "the latest events in Indochina" to renew the charge that
 Peking's rejection of joint action has encouraged "imperialist
 aggression."  The burden of PRAVDA's attack is that Peking's policies
 are designed to further Chinese great-power aims at the expense of
 the communist and third-world forces as well as of the Chinese people's
 own well-being.
 Almost as an afterword, the editorial article addresses itself to
 the Peking talks in an effort to stress Moscow's desire to keep the
 negotiations alive despite the bitter polemical exchange.  The
 article repeats--without attribution--Brezhnev's remarks on China
 in his 14 April Kharkov speech in which he urged that ideological
 c?.ifferences be contained on the party level and reiterated the
 Soviet interest in a border settlement. In renewing his warning
 that Chinese war preparations cannot pressure the Soviets, the
 article interjects a comment on the Chinese space satellite,
 charging that the launching has been used to foment "nationalistic
 passions" and for threats against the Soviet Union.  The article
 concludes by quoting from Brezhnev's Lenin centennial address
 calling on the Chinese to come together with the Soviets in joint
 struggle.
 *  In contrast to DRV Premier Pham Van Dong's trips to Moscow and
 Peking last October, Le Duan's travels have not been accompanied by
 signs in the propaganda that the North Vietnamese have been able to
 play a mediatory role in Sino-Soviet relations.  See the TRENDS of
 29 October 1969, page 21, and 13 May 1970, page 16.

 Though in an earlier passage, cataloguing Peking's deviations in
 foreign policy, PRAVDA refers to Chinese territorial claims and to
 the border clashes, the article fails to imply any current
 difficulties along the border or to accuse the Chinese of recent
 provocations.  The Chinese joint editorial had similarly avoided
 suggesting a deterioration of relations directly affecting the
 border confrontation.  The current polemical exchange thus seems
 designed as another, major exercise In the ideological contest for
 authority in the communise movement, a contest the Chinese had
 promised in their pronouncements on the agreement to hold the
 talks last October.
 The PRAVDA editorial article is largely a point-by-point response
 to charges pressed in the Chinese joint editorial.  Points on
 which the two sides have joined issue in the latest polemical
 round include the following:
 +  Introducing the term "Brezhnevism," the Chinese editorial had
 sharply assailed Brezhnev's leadership and personalized the
 ideological vendetta.  PRAVDA returns the compliment with a
 bitter attack on Mao in a section damning "Maoisr:'` as a
 "reactionary-utopian, petty bourgeois" doctrine.  Judging from
 the PRAVDA article, the -Soviets were taken aback by the Peking
 editorial's citation of a previously unpublished remark by Mao
 in 1956 charging that the Soviets had discarded Leninism.*
 Interpreting the disclosure of this remark as indicating Mao's
 personal role in initiating the current anti-Soviet attacks,
 PRAVDA contrasts the newly quoted remark with Mao's praise for
 Soviet policies when he was in Moscow in 1957.  "An obvious fact
 of unscrupulous perfidy," PRAVDA intones.
 +  The Peking editorial introduced the epithet "social militarism"
 in addition to the standard charges that the Soviets practice
 social fascism and social imperialism.  PRAVTDA replies by condemning
 Maoism as a Chinese version of "social chauvinism."  On the score
 of militarism, PRAVDA draws on old polemical themes in attacking
 Mao for believing in "the inevitability and even desirability of
 war" and for being cynical about the effects of nuclear devastation.
 The article portrays China as undergoing militarization in all
 phases of life, though there is no attempt to depict Chinese war
 preparations as a threat to Soviet security.
 *  As quoted by Peking, he also said the Soviets  had abandoned
 Stalinism, but PRAVDA chose to ignore this.

 +  The exchange has overtones of racism, with each side comparing
 the other to Hitler.  The Chinese editorial evoked a specter of
 traditional pan-Slavic expansionism in denouncing the "new tsars"
 now occupying the Kremlin.  PRAVDA retorts that the Chinese have
 revived Hitler's talk about the need to contain a Slavic threat.
 Each side has renewed charges that the other oppresses national
 minorities.
 +  The Chinese editorial devoted a section to the "Brezii-ne^
 doctrine," condemning the invasion of Czechoslovakia and denouncing
 Moscow's notion of a socialist community as "nothing but a synonym
 for a colonial empire."  PRAVDA's rejoinder complains that Peking
 has spearheaded its foreign policy against the socialist community
 and has sought to undermine the Warsaw Pact and economic integration
 under CEMA.  Unlike the PRAVDA editorial article last August, which
 discussed Peking's line on Czechoslovakia as well as the Warsaw Pact
 and CEMA, the current article ignores the Czechoslovak question.
 +  Peking's joint editorial dealt relatively briefly with the third
 world, accusing the Soviets of exploiting the underdeveloped countries
 and trying to suppress national liberation movements.  In this
 connection it charged that the Soviets had helped reactionaries in
 such countries as Indonesia and India to massacre revolutionaries.
 The PRAVDA article, whose title calls the Chinese "pseudorevolutionaries,"
 turns the chexge back against Peking by laying blame on the PRC for
 the loss of tens of thousands of revolutionaries who allegedly followed
 its "adventuristic" line.  In a pitch for broad support against Peking,
 PRAVDA rebukes the Chinese for promoting insurrection against "progres-
 sive" Asian regimes (an allusion to such regimes as Ne Win's,: in Burma),
 for provoking conflicts between states(bringing to mind, for example,
 the Indo-Pakistani conflict), and generally for seeking to isolate
 the national liberation movement from the Soviet bloc.  In what may
 be read as a lecture to Indochinese elements being wooed by Peking,
 PRAVDA warns that to follow the Chinese line in opposition to the
 Soviets would leave "peoples struggling against imperialism" face to
 face with "a strong and cunning enemy."  After citing current
 developments in Indochina, the article impugns Peking's motives as
 stemming from great-Han dreams of ruling "at least Asia, if not the
 whole world."
 A TASS report on the 19th, rounding up world reaction to the PRAVDA
 editorial article, cites the New York TIMES on PRAVDA's criticism of
 Peking regarding Indochina.  The TIMES article said PRAVDA was
 ambiguous on this matter, leaving it uncertain whether the Soviets
 were simply charging that Peking's past failures to cooperate on

 saying that Peking had currently rejected a Soviet call for united

 only the first interpretation and ignores a reference in the same
 passage to speculation that Hanoi may be seeking at the present
 time to put together a united front.

 SOVIET CENTRAL PRESS DECRIES MOTIVES BEHIND CHINESE LAUNCH
 The 18 May PRAVDA editorial article's swipe at the anti-Soviet uses
 being made of the Chinese space satellite is the first direct,
 authoritative Soviet comment on any individual test in the PRC's
 nuclear-missile program.  It caps a succession of Soviet propaganda
 items on the launch--a departure from Moscow's customary abstention
 from comment on past Chinese tests after briefly reporting  hem.
 The editorial article, a broadside at Mao and the policies of.
 Chinese "pseudorevolutionariess" points to the "military psychosis"
 being fanned in the PRC and the Maoist regime's calls on the people
 "prepare for war," then observes'th at "even the recent launching
 of a satellite as a result of the selfless efforts of Chinese
 scientists, engineers, and workers is being used to whip up
 nationalistic passions and for threats against our country."
 The Soviet propaganda reaction to the 24 April satellite launch
 began two weeks after Moscow media tersely reported the event on
 the 25th.  Beginning early in May, Moscow used the proxy of foreign
 press articles and foreign "observers" to impugn the Chinese
 leadership's motives and to play up the role of former U.S. Air
 Force Colonel Chien Hsueh-shen in making the PRC achievement
 possible.  The first such item, in issue No. 19 of ZA RUBEZHOM signed
 to the press 6 May, was a reprint of a Paris INTERNATIONAL HERALD
 TRIBUNE article on Chien's role in the development of the satellite.
 A Moscow radio commentary in Albanian on the 13th, noting Chinese
 propaganda efforts to ascribe the success to Mao Tse-tung's thought,
 cited "foreign observers" as stressing the "decisive role" in fact
 played by Chinn, who "became a member of the CCP Central Committee"
 in May 1969.  The major contribution of the American-trained Dr. Chien,
 along with that of West uerman suppliers and experts, is also
 emphasized in an article from the Indian weekly LINK reprinted in
 LITERARY' GAZETTE on 13 May.  The article estimates the cost of the
 Chinese nuclear-missi.le program as six billion dollars annually--
 a sum, LINK remarks, that could have been used to feed and educate
 the Chinese people.
 While Moscow avoids coming directly to grips with the military and
 strategic implications of the launch, LITERARY GAZETTE's reprint
 of the Indian article includes a reference to the launch as a
 development which the world, and particularly China's neighbors,
 must view "primarily against the background of the almost explosive
 development rates of the military potential" of China--as an event

 of basically "military significance."  Moscow media did not report
 remarks made in Geneva by chief Soviet disarmament negotiator
 Roshchin, who was quoted by Henburg's DPA on 28 April as stating,
 in response to a question about the effect of the launch on
 armaments policy, that "this question needs detailed study" and
 that Chinese participation in disarmament and arms control is
 "one of the very grave pending problems" today.
 Nor did Moscow publicize remarks by Soviet cosmonaut Leonov in
 an interview carried in the Tokyo YOMIURI on 13 May, contrived to
 project for Japanese readers an image of Soviet reasonableness
 vis-a-vis a self-isolated China acting against its own interests
 by refusing to ;Join the international community.  Leonov said it
 was the USSR's "impression" that the PRC is "wasting both money
 and energy by trying to do what we accomplished 10 years ago
 because China does not want to rely on the help of other nations."
 Peking has itself avoided discussion of the implications of the
 launch in its own comment.  In a diminishing volume of propaganda
 on the satellite, it has continued to publicize foreign messages
 of congratulations which in some instances hail the blow dealt to
 the "imperialists" and "Soviet revisionists."

 PRC CANCELS WARSAW MEETING, CITES U.S. ACTIONS IN CAMBODIA
 In an announcement similar in timing to its cancellation of the
 135th session of the Sino-U.S. ambassadorial talks scheduled for
 20 February 1969, the PRC announced on 19 May (Peking time) that
 the 137th session scheduled for the 20th in Warsaw would not be
 held in view of U.S. military actions in Cambodia.  On each
 occasion the announcement was released in Peking media early on
 the day before the date of the scheduled meeting. The February
 1969 cancellation, announced in a statement by the PRC Foreign
 Ministry spokesman, was attributed to "the current anti-China
 atmosphere" allegedly created by the United States in its
 handling of a Chinese diplomatic defector.  The present brief
 announcement simpll quotes the Chinese side at the Warsaw talks
 as having notified the U.S. side on 18 May that the PRC "deems
 it no longer suitable" to hold the meeting as scheduled "in view
 of the increasingly grave situation created by the U.S. Government,
 which has brazenly sent troops to invade Cambodia and expanded the
 war in Indochina."  This was the charge lodged in the I+ May PRC
 Government statement reacting to the U.S. military incursion into
 Cambodia and air attacks on'the DRV in early May.
 The two cancellation announcements differ significantly in their
 implications for the near future of the talks.  The February 1969
 announcement took the occasion to denounce the "vicious features"
 of the Nixon Administration and to accuse it of following its
 predecessor in "making itself the enemy" of the Chinese.  The
 announcement said nothing about rescheduling the meeting.
 Subsequent Chinese comment took a notably hard line on Sino-U.S.
 relations, in contrast to essentially noncommittal comment at
 the time of the Nixon Administration's inauguration.  The 135th
 session of the Warsaw talks was not held until January 1970.
 The current announcement avoids naming the Nixon Administration
 and does not refer to the state of Sino-U.S. relations.  Also
 unlike the February 1969 announcement, it broaches the question
 of rescheduling the meeting, saying this will be decided upon
 "later" through consultation by liaison representatives of the
 two sides.  The announcement thus manages to register protest-
 against U.S. actions in Indochina, and implicitly to suggest a
 contrast between Peking's purity and Moscow's uninterrupted
 participation in the SALT sessions in Vienna, while indicating
 to both of the other sides in the triangular relationship that
 the Warsaw talks will continue.

 SOVIET  BLOC  RELATIONS
 Romania's defiant response to Soviet efforts to tighten the reins
 on the European bloc through the Warsaw Pact and CEMA forms  u
 pervasive undercurrent of articles surrounding the Pact's 15th
 anniversary, 14 May, and the 12-14 May CEMA Council session in
 Warsaw.  The example of Czechoslovakia, where the Pact was invoked
 to "defend the gains of socialism," is a prominent motif of
 Soviet comment on the Pact anniversary.   And the comment on both
 events appears against the backdrop of the recently concluded
 Soviet-Czechoslovak treaty, which for the first time in such a
 document makes defense of "socialist gains" in each country a
 common internationalist duty and for the first time refers to
 "socialist economic integration" in CEMA.
 Romania, whose renewed bilateral treaty with the Soviets was
 initialed two years ago but has yet to be signed, has made clear
 its rejection of both concepts.  The Romanians declined to join
 the CEMA "international investment bank" established at the Warsaw
 session, and a deadline of lU July for members to sign the
 agreement on the bank appears to anticipate continuing efforts
 to break down Romania's resistance.  Romanian party chief Ceausescu's
 hurried trip to Moscow on 18-19 May, after the CEMA session and in
 the wake of a TASS annoi.ncement that the Warsaw defense ministers
 committee will meet in Sofia "in May," appears to signal a new
 round of intensified pressures on Bucharest.
 Moscow's effort to emphasize Pact concerns in a wide geographical
 co~.text adds another dimension to the tense state of relations.
 While authoritative Soviet comment mentions Indochina and the
 Middle East and evokes the Sino-Soviet situation in statements
 prefacing  references to the Pact forces, authoritative Romanian
 articles insist that the Pact exists "only" as a defense against
 "imperialist attack in Europe" and emphasize that the Romanian
 armed forces are responsible solely to the Romanian party and
 state.

 SOVIET ARTICLES IMPLY BROADENED ROLE FOR WARSAW PACT
 Soviet media made extensive use of the Warsaw Pact anniversary* to
 underscore, on the one hand, the role of the Pact as exemplified by
 the intervention in Czcchonlovakia and, on the other hand, the
 "international" scope of Pact concerns.  Both aspects are reflected
 in RED STAR's 13 May anniversary editorial, which hails the Soviet-
 Czechoslovak treaty as exemplifying the principle of "defense of
 socialist achievements" and declares that U.S. "aggression" in
 Southeast Asia, Israeli "aggression," and the anti-Soviet campaign
 in China "demand from Soviet soldiers, as well as from our
 comrades-in-arms in the fraternal socialist countries, an increased
 vigilance and a constant readiness to defend socialist achievements
 selflessly."  The editorial declares that "the American invasion of
 Cambodia compels the Soviet Union and the other Warsaw Pact
 countries to do everything possible to repulse and to stop
 imperialist aggression"; and with an eye to the Sino-Soviet
 conflict, it goes on to stress the Pact members' determination
 "to insure the inviolability of their frontiers."
 Pact Commander Yakubovskiy's anniversary article in PRAVDA on
 14 May stresses in general terms that the Pact is "reliably
 defending the gains of socialism" and dwells on its members'
 loyalty to their "international mission."  Yakubovskiy does
 not directly repeat Pact Chief of Staff Shtemenko's reference
 in RED STAR in January to the "allocation" of individual
 countries' troops to the joint forces, rather referring
 generally to "diverse forms of military cooperation" includng
 "regular meetings and conferences of the armies' leading
 personnel" and joint maneuvers.  But Shtemenko brings up
 this sensitive issue again in a 14 May IZVESTIYA article,
 noting that "in the interests of collective defense the
 Warsaw Pact member states created the combined armed forces,
 consisting of national contingents which are assigned for
 joint operations."
 *  Radio Moscow's propaganda on the occasion amounted to almost five
 percent of its total comment in the week ending 17 May--more than
 double the volume devoted to the Pact's decennial anniversary in
 1965.  In addition to his article in PRAVDA on this year's anniversary,
 Pact Commander Yakubovskiy contributed articles to leading dailies
 of Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland, and Bulgaria; the then Pact
 Commander Grechko had marked the 1965 anniversary only with articles
 in PRAVDA and NEUES DEUTSCHLAND.

 Yakubovskiy does call attention in PRAVDA to the presence of Soviet
 troops in certain Pact countries, stressing the "lasting combat
 friendship" between "the groups of Soviet forces and the personnel
 of the armies of the GDR, Hungary, Poland, and Czechoslovakia."
 In his article published in Prague's RUDE PRAVO and the Bratislava
 PRAVDA, also on the 14th, the Pact commander is more heavyhanded
 than in his Moscow PRAVDA article. in declaring that "all that one
 army achieves becomes the joint property of all the allied armies."
 CEMA SESSION CARRIES FORWARD MOVES TOWARD INTEGRATION
 The CEMA Council session in the Polish capital, at the premier level,
 was called to implement the decisions on "economic and scientific-
 technical cooperation" taken by the 23d "special" CEMA Council
 meeting held in Moscow in April 1969, attended by party first
 secretaries as well as premiers of the member countries.  The
 communique on the Warsaw session, carried by PAP on 14 May, goes
 beyond the April 1969 communique in calling for stepped-up
 "socialist economic integration" of the CEMA countries, where
 the earlier document had referred only to economic "cooperation."
 The replacement of the less sensitive term with the more blatant
 one follows the insertion of references to "socialist economic
 integration" under CEMA--in addition to customary references to
 "international socialist division of labor"--in the new Soviet-
 Czechoslovak treaty.
 INVESTMENT BANK     In announcing implementation of the decision of
 last year's meeting on creation of an "inter-
 national investment bank" under CEMA, the communique lists all the
 attending countries except Romania as having joined in the agreement
 on establishing the new entity.  It adds that the subscribing
 countries "have agreed that they will have signed the agreement
 by 10 July 1970."
 PAP reports TRYBUNA LUDU as revealing on 19 May that the "decision"
 on the new bank contains a statement to the effect that "all
 decisions to be made in the bank will not be adopted unanimously,
 but by a two-thirds majority of votes."  The paper says this proviso
 will increase the bank's "efficiency" and will also be "a precedent,
 because the principle of unanimity, applied so far in all CEMA
 organizations, not infrequently hampered the activity of that
 organization."  The new provision thus in effect serves notice
 that Soviet-sponsored decisions in CEMA will be imposed regardless
 of maverick attitudes like Romania's.

 The new bank's "main aim" is defined as the granting of credits for
 implementation of the international socialist division of labor as
 well as for development of individual countries' economies--an
 apparent indication that Czechoslovakia in particular must look to
 CEMA for aid in this form rather than in the kind of hard-currency
 loan it had sought from Moscow during the 1968 liberalization.  The
 commur~que provides, at the same time, for continuation of CEMA's
 International Bank of Economic Cooperation, the vehicle for
 "settling multilateral accounts in transfer rubles," which had
 been established by a CEMA executive committee session in Moscow
 in December 1963 under the chairmanship of Romania's Birladeanu.
 The communique reports another step in the integration process
 in the form of a new "institute of economic problems of the world
 socialist system," designed to "prepare complex elaborations of
 economic problems and to further deepen and improve the cooperation"
 of the CEMA member countries.
 CEAUSESCU VISIT TO MOSCOW REFLECTS RISING TENSIONS
 Romanian party chief Ceausescu's unheralded talks with the Soviet
 party leadership in Moscow on 18-19 May, at a time when serious
 flooding is occurring in Romania, underlines the strains in
 bilateral relations and appears to signal a new round of Soviet
 pressure on Romania to live up to its "obligations" as an ally.
 A brief TASS report on the Moscow talks on the 19th says that
 they passed in "an open and comradely atmosphere" and that there
 was "an exchange of views"--a euphemism for serious disagreement.
 TASS adds that the discussions covered the international situation,
 the world communist movement, and bilateral relations and that
 both sides reaffirmed their desire to "strengthen and develop
 friendly relations."  Another brief TASS report on the 19th notes
 that the Romanian delegation--which included Niculescu-Mizil, the
 RCP's chief representative  for international party affairs--was
 seen off at the airport by Brezhnev, Suslov, and Katushev.
 Tension surrounding the talks had seemed reflected in Bucharest
 radio's gratuitous emphasis, in reporting the delegation's sudden
 departure for Moscow, on the unity of the people and party behind
 Ceausescu.  Noting that the delegation was seen off by Maurer,
 Pana, and other leading party and state officials, the radio said
 many Bucharest citizens also went to the airport to demonstrate
 their affection for the leadership, "reasserting once again the
 close unity of the people around the RCF and their total adherence
 to its domestic and foreign policy."

 The hurried visit came against the background of evidently increasing
 Soviet displeasure with Romania's independent behavior.  A major
 factor contributing to present tensions appears to be Romania's
 reluctance to abandon its neutralist posture in the Sino-Soviet
 dispute and, as a member of the Warsaw Pact, to support Soviet
 foreign policy positions.  At a time when Moscow was seeking to
 preserve its options in Indochina by holding off on recognition
 of the Chinese-sponsored Sihanouk government-in-exile, Bucharest
 took the course followed by Belgrade in promptly recognizing the
 Sihanouk regime.  Soviet displeasure over Romania's attitude, toward
 the PRC is implied in the 18 May PRAVDA editorial article on China,
 which accuses Peking of trying to "undermine" the Soviet Union's
 relations with its Warsaw Pact allies and to "hinder plans for
 economic integration."  In the light of Romania's refusal to
 participate in CEMA's international investment bank, the
 implication is that Romania is susceptible to such influences.
 Soviet-Romanian differences on the role of the Warsaw Pact are
 prominent in propaganda on the Pact anniversary.  In direct
 conflict with Soviet articles underscoring the Pact's "inter-
 national" role, Romanian media used the anniversary to put
 pointed emphasis on its limitation to the European theater and
 to reiterate that Romania will retain control over its own
 armed forces.  An article under the authoritative signature of
 I. Iliescu in SCINTEIA on 14 May, reported by AGERPRES, cites
 Article 4 of the Warsaw Treaty which stipulates that the Pact
 will act "in case of ar armed attack in Europe."  Against the
 background of Moscow's deletion of the "in Europe" clause in
 bilateral pacts with its European allies, and in patent response
 to such statements as Yakubovskiy's--in the 14 May PRAVDA--that
 the Pact is a powerful factor for security in Europe "and other
 continents," Iliescu states flatly that the alliance's "only
 objective is defense against an imperialist attack in Europe."
 Iliescu's article also responds to the implications of current
 Soviet articles in insisting that "the sole leader of our
 armed forces is the party, the State Council, the Supreme
 National Command; only they can give orders to our army, and
 only these can be carried out."  Moscow has conveyed a picture
 of joint Warsaw Pact forces ready to serve anywhere needed in
 "defense of socialism."  Thus Yakubovskiy, after condemning
 the U.S. actions in Cambodia, declares in the PRAVDA article:
 ".     being aware of their loyalty to their international
 mission, the joint armed forces are determined to do everything
 in their power to discharge with credit their duties as a reliable
 shield of socialism."

 Iliescu's counter-emphasis on the control exercised exclusively
 by Romanian constitutional and party bodies over military actions
 recurs in other Romanian commentaries relating to the Pact
 anniversary.  These commentaries echo the view of the function
 of the Pact and Romania's role in it that was spelled out by
 Ceausescu to a group of military cadres on 5 February, in
 remarks apparently responsive to Shtemenko's 24 January RED
 STAR article which referred to "combined" Warsaw Pact forces.
 Ceausescu made it clear in that speech that his country would
 not renounce party and state control over its own armed force=.

 WEST GERMANY
 SOVIET, GDR MEDIA DECRY BRANDT, SPD "INCONSISTENCIES"
 Soviet and East German media hammered at the "inconsistencies"
 between West German Chancellor Brandt's words and deeds as Soviet-FRG
 talks resumed in Moscow and on the eve of the scheduled 21 May summit
 meeting in Kassel between Brandt and GDR Premier Stoph.  Commentators
 have cctinued to express skepticism about Bonn's readiness to make
 the concessions which Moscow and East Berlin say are essential if
 relations are to improve.  Extensive Soviet and GDR comment evinces
 disappointment at the SPD's 17th party congress at Saarbruecken and
 Brandt Is report to it.
 Moscow has made no comment on the talks between Gromyko and FRG
 State Secretary Bahr that resumed 12 May.  But a prompt, brief Soviet
 report on the reopening of the talks contrasted with Moscow's
 failure to even mention the first rounds in December, February, and
 March until their conclusion.
 Moscow comment for German listeners on the 11-14 May
 SPD congress stresses that Brandt's main address there
 "clearly exposed all the inconsistencies" in the policies of the
 government led by the SPD.  Repeated demands that Bonn accept "reality"
 and agree to recognition of the GDR and Europe's postwar status quo
 suggest a concerted Moscow-East Berlin effort to confront the Brandt
 government with a tough, united bargaining position.
 Typically, commentator Zholkver observes in daily reports on the
 cong"ess that it brought to light growing dissatisfaction among "PD
 members and voters over the "open inconsistency of the SPD elite"
 and the FRG Government.  This was revealed, Zholkver says, in the
 shelving, "under leadersLip pressure," of progressive foreign policy
 resolutions favoring recognition of the GDR and the Oder-Neisse
 frontier as well as in the SPD leadership's "unequivocally negative
 attitude" toward domestic reforms.  At the same time, Zholkver says
 there was "no lack of praise" :'or FRG capitalism and monopolists and
 that Brandt delivered a "eulogy" on the "aggressive NATO pact."
 A Zakharov commentary on the F.'D congress, broadcast to Radio Moscow's
 German listeners on the 12th, offers a gloomy evaluation of the SPD's
 achievements to date under Brandt's slogans of "continuity" and
 "reform."  Remarking that the SPD inherited from Kiesinger's CDU
 a state of "Frussian character, intellectual decay, chauvinist
 nationalism, and anticommunism," Zakharov cautions that "reactionary
 forces" in the FRG are gaining strength much more rapidly than the

 "active democratic forces, eE ecially within the SPD.            He calls
 the Social Democrats' stand or, the GDR an increasingly important
 indicator of whether they are in fact committed to "peace and
 social progress."  And he concludes that SPD pursuit of continuity
 with CDU policies in the military field and in nonrecognition of
 the GDR and Europe's status quo "destroys the hopes" for renewal
 of the Bonn state and West German society.
 In addition to its own negative reporting on the SPD congress, East
 Berlin's ADN publicizes a statement by the West German Communist
 Party (DKP) executive leveling a strong attack on the SPD and the
 Brandt regime.  ADP! quotes the DKP statement on 15 May as saying
 BrLidt "again" ignored reality and made it clear "only a few days
 before the Kassel meeting" that the SPD leadership and the FRG
 Government "cannot be expected to make a contribution to a policy
 of peace and detente" based on international recognition of the
 GDP and Europe's postwar frontiers.
 BONN'S "BLACKMAIL" AT WHO MEETING SEEN AS F.'D OMEN FOR KASSEL
 East German media are bitter and vituperative in discussing the
 FRG's role at Geneva in the World Health Organization's one-year
 postponement of a vote on GDR membership.  ADN charges on the
 14th that Bonn employed "transparent manipulations and blackmail"
 at Geneva because it feared the World Health Assembly would admit
 the GDR.  A GDR Foreign Ministry statement on the 15th, carried by
 ADN, calls the FRG's "impudent presumption" of special prerogatives
 "indeed a bad omen" for the "proposed" summit talks.  It adds that
 Bonn is "fatally wrong" if it believes it can apply the same
 "blackmail" policy in its talks with the GDR.  The FRG's "antihumani-
 tarian attitude" confirms anew that the FRG "has forfeited the
 right to talk about 'humanity' and 'human alleviations,'" as
 suggested by Brandt at Erfurt, the statement says.
 A 16 May NEUES DEUTSCHLAND commentary on the WHO vote postponement
 points out that the FRG's delaying tactics were employed just a
 week before the "scheduled" Kassel meeting.  The paper contras-;s
 Brandt's Erfurt assurances about "exclusion of any discrimination"
 with the FRG's actions at Geneva, which it says revealed "an
 outburst of the greatest hostility toward the GDR, a brutal 'no'
 to equality, presumption to sole representation in WHO, and an act
 of scandalous discrimination in its most provocative form."
 The Warsaw PAP's Bonn correspondent reports on the 18th that political
 circles in Bonn "seriously" considered the possibility of the Kassel
 summit being cancelled as a result of Bonn's "forcing through" the
 decision to postpone the WHO vote on GDR membership.  Neither East
 German nor Soviet media have mentioned this possibility specifically.

 PRC  INTERNAL                 AFFAIRS
 PROVINCIAL MEDIA STRESS NEED FOR ECONOMIC SELF-RELIANCE
 Recent central and provincial radio reports point to a continuation of
 the Chinese leadership's drive to divide the country into semi-independent
 economic units with the county as the base.  Numerous press reports
 applaud the success of local industry in using local resources to provide
 needed agricultural equipment, fertilizer, and processing plants.
 SHANGHAI      A Shanghai radio commentary on 8 May, however, again
 PROBLEMS      raises the problem of coordination of economic efforts--a
 special problem for Shanghai, which depends on other areas
 for food and raw materials while -,ending most of its own output to other
 areas.  The radio commentary includes the admonition that the "new form
 of socialist cooperation" involving extensive division of labor does
 not mean "splitting up the socialist economic entity into many unrelated
 departmental economies."  It adds that trades and professions must be
 broken down, and the worker must not only think about his own factory
 or bureau but must take "the entire city of Shanghai and the t?*hole
 country into consideration and firmly establish the idea of coordinating
 all the activities of the nation as in a chess game."
 The "chess game" thesis had been advocated by former Shanghai chief Ko
 Ching-shih as a means of protecting Shanghai's raw materials supply
 during the Great Leap period.  The radio commentary appears to amplify
 previous hints that the slogan is now also being used to explain to
 Shanghai residents why they must increase their efforts to support the
 rest of the country.  The article criticizes "some people" who say that
 production capability is limited and warns against the idea that
 "cooperation must be reciprocal."  Cooperation, it says, means "utterly
 devoting oneself" to the national good.
 EXPERIMENT     The economic transformation of less industrialized areas seems
 IN FUKIEN      to be still in the experimental stage, but Foochow broadcasts
 on 7 May illustrated how it might be achieved along lines
 laid down in Mao's 7 May 1966 instruction.  As in the few previous examples
 of relatively complete transformation of an area, the Foochow plan is based
 on the idea of making everyone a producer.  The people of the area that
 was transformed, the largest township in Nanping municipality, were
 completely reorganized by the commune revolutionary committee:  farmers
 were sent to the hills to develop forestry and crops, the old or disabled
 were I,:; to work on subsidiary production, and "most" of the nonagricultural
 population was sent out to work in production teams.

 A basic feature of the new plan, according to the broadcasts, Is an
 increase in the size of the basic agricultural unit, an idea that has
 been tested extensively in neighboring Kiangsi with little apparent
 success.  Production teams "cultivating large expanses of acreage but
 short of manpower" are grouped into units called "7 May villages" with
 cadres, township residents, and youth brought in to meet the manpower
 deficit.  All those ?;L.,.se skills are needed in the countryside have
 been sent to the agricultural villages and brigades, as have handicraft
 workers dependent on agricultural supplies.  One apparent reason why
 ther,e radical measures are not being adopted more widely may be found
 in the modest results of this experiment so far.  Grain production in
 the commune last year, even based on the possibly inflated figure
 claimed by the Foochow radio, was only 10 percent higher than in the
 previous year--a very ordinary increment by stated PRC standards.
