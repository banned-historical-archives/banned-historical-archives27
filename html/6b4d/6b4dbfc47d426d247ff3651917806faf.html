the External Programs section has many items of in-

not aware of the full scope of training opportunities in 
the field of finance and budgeting, the rather long item 
on this subject in the Bulletin Board section shouldbe 
of considerable interest.... This issue carries sched-

INTERROGATION Joint training seminars in the exploitation of captured 
SEMINARS enemy documents and personnel at the strategic level 
will be conducted at Fort Holabird during the periods 
17 - 28 June and 15 - 26 July 1963. The seminars are 
sponsored by the Joint Interrogation Planning Commit-
tee for reserve officers who, in the event of hostilities, 
will be engaged in interrogation or document exploita-
tion. From CIA, both reservists and nonreservists 
are eligible. 
FINANCIAL The 13 May running of the new Travel Procedures  
COURSES Course announced in the April BULLETIN is already 
oversubscribed and applications are being accepted 
for the 20 September course. 
Other courses offered by OTR for the Comptroller 
include: 
Budget and Finance Procedures: two one-week seg-
ments, the first covering support theory for all field 
stations and designed as an introduction for the sec-
ond week and the two courses which follow; the sec-
ond segment covers Class B budgetary and financial 
accounting and Type II property accounting proce-
dures, and is primarily a skill course for personnel 
in small stations. 
Financial Familiarization--Class A budgetary and  
financial accounting and Type I property accounting  
procedures (one week, primarily for personnel in 
large stations). 
Financial Familiarization--Commercial Accounting 
(one week, primarily for employees in commercial 
cover or proprietary project assignments). 
These OTR courses were designed to give Training Of-
ficers and employees flexibility in requesting only 
training pertinent to the assignment; each may be taken 
separately or in combination with any of the others as 
needed. Two factors limit these courses: each is 
scheduled for only 40 hours; and Agency operating com-
ponents have such differing procedures that there is a 
point beyond which it is impractical to give detailed

and uniform procedures to employees of different 
components in the same class. 
In addition, there are three courses given directly by 
the Comptroller: Survey of Budgeting, which is basic 
and general, and Budget Execution and Budget Formu-
lation, which are advanced and technical; these are 
designed primarily for Headquarters application. 
OTR and the Office of the Comptroller wish to meet 
the requirements of the operating components. If the 
two series of courses outlined above do not meet an 
individual or group need, the training requirement 
should be referred to the Chief/Operations School/ 
OTR, or to the Comptroller Training Officer. OTR 
can arrange tutorial training and the Office of the 
Comptroller can provide on-the-job training. Given 
proper definition of training requirements and ade-
quate training time, the Agency is able to meet the 
increased demands for financial and budgetary train-
ing which have resulted from new laws, the continuing 
federal Financial Management Improvement Program, 
and internal Agency administrative and operational 
needs. 
The Registrar Staff has information on the courses to 
be conducted in Washington by the Army Management 
Engineering Training Agency(A.META). These courses 
are being offered under Bureau of the Budget sponsor-
ship and at no cost. Courses are: 
Systems and Procedures Analysis for ADP(13-24 May) 
Managing Research and Development Activitie s(20-22 May) 
Systems and Procedures Analysis (3-14 June) 
Management Statistics (17-28 June)

CPYRGHT 
GEORGE'S SCHOOL IS PROGRESSIVE 
When I ran into George in the kitchen the other morn-
ing, my ten-year-old, a rotund egghead already in bi-
ocals, was breakfasting on yogurt, sunflower seeds, 
and Kant's "Critique of Pure Reason." 
"Well, how's school?" I inquired, being rather good 
at small talk. 
George attends a progressive school. He can give 
you a formula for the alpha rhythm of the cortex and 
next year he's going to learn about the alphabet. 
"We are starting a new project," George informed 
me. Clearly, he expected the Nobel Prize Commit-
tee would be watching eagerly. 
Another class project! We'd just have to be brave 
about it. 
On the last one, two kids were trapped in a bathy-
sphere on the bottom of a lake. This new project 
could be anything from a campaign to impeach the 
mayor to building a swamp. 
"On Monday," George went on, "we start building a 
swamp." 
"A real challenge, eh?" I knew better than to appear 
distraught or to suggest that somebody at his little, 
mad schoolhouse was over-dosing with pep pills. 
Article six of the school's Code for Enlightened Par-
ents cautions that adult skepticism could injure the 
young, inquiring mind. 
When George went downstairs to his fallout shelter 
to repair a damaged atom, I called his home-room 
teacher, Miss Grosskopf. 
"What good," I demanded, "is a swamp?" 
"Now, now," she scolded, "it's to be no ordinary 
swamp. It's one on the moon."

LEARNING THE COUNTRY-TEAM APPROACH 
Stop the world, I want to get off! This surrender is 
heard today only in "civilized" lands, only in the 
"developed" countries. For every individual or group 
which panics and calls for the conductor to let them 
out of the struggle there is a whole nation clamoring 
to get in. Nations which have sat out the flow of mod-
ern economic and social advance have suddenly awak-
ened and are crying "Stop the world, I want to get on!" 
They want to be part of the new world they have ignor-
ed so long or of which they have only now become a-
ware. These are the developing countries.

Take any one of these developing nations--Iran, Thai-
land, South Vietnam, Nigeria, Colombia, almost any 
of the countries of Asia, the Near East, Africa, or 
Latin America. Any one you consider has economic 
problems: its agriculture is inefficient and ineffective, 
its industry not in tune with its resources or the needs 
of the world of trade or too limited, its wealth poorly 
distributed. It has political and social difficulties: a 
government system which no longer works or is break-
ing down, wildly too great disparities between its so-
cial classes, ignorance and illiteracy and no plans or 
means to overcome them, unrest in social patterns 
and institutions, and the surge toward social and eco-
nomic revolution. There may be and usually are threats 
to its stability or even existence, whether from subver-
sive insurgency at home or outside pressure. 
And on top of all the stresses and strains of the devel-
opmental process, the country is caught in the strug-
gle between Communism and the Free World for pri-
mary influence over the direction and outcome of that 
developmental process. 
This country is a problem not just to itself; because 
our policy and world circumstances have made it so, 
it is a problem to the United States. The U. S. objec-
tive in overseas internal defense is to safeguard and 
assist less developed societies in fulfilling their aspi-
rations to remain free and to fashion ways of life inde-
pendent from communist or other totalitarian domina-
tion or control. The susceptibility of developing soci-
eties to dissidence and violence which can be exploited 
by the communists requires the development of indige-
nous capabilities to cope with the threat to internal 
security in whatever form it appears. Reasonable sta-
bility is. necessary for healthy economic growth and 
the evolution of human liberties and representative gov-
ernment. 
Briefly: We have a political and ideological interest 
in assuring that developing nations evolve in a way 
that affords a congenial world environment :or inter-
national cooperation and the growth of free institutions.

We have a military interest in assuring that strategic 
areas and the manpower and natural resources of these 
developing nations do not fall under communist control; 
that these nations are able to maintain their internal 
security and preserve their independence. We have an 
economic interest in assuring that the resources and 
markets of the less developed part of the world remain 
available to us and the rest of the free world. And we 
have a humanitarian interest in assuring the achieve-
ment of the social, economic, and educational aspira-
tions of these nations. 
When U.S. resources are to be applied to the solution 
of these problems, the job goes to the U.S. envoys 
in the country in question--the embassy, the U.S. Op-
erations Mission (AID), the Public Affairs Officers 
(USIA), the Defense Department representatives, the 
CIA station. These form the "country team". U.S. 
policy is that the representatives of these agencies 
work together, each playing his unique and indispensa-
ble part, but coordinating and cooperating on the prob-
lem as a team. 
Because the problems of developing countries, espe-
cially those faced with subversive insurgency, are 
so difficult and their solution so urgent, the five agen-
cies named above have joined to sponsor the course 
called Interdepartmental Country Team Seminar: 
Problems of Development and Internal Defense. The 
course title indicates the subject matter and the meth-
od of attacking it. Just as in the country involved, so 
here in Washington the country team approach is used 
--students from each of the participating agencies form-
ing teams during the course to study an area in a gen-
eral way and then a particular problem of a specific 
country. In this way a spirit of cooperation and under-
standing is encouraged which will assure maximum in-
tegration and effectiveness of the U.S. effort in that 
country. 
The objectives of the course, then, are to familiarize key civilian and 
military officers assigned to developing countries, especially those 
where insurgency is active or incipient, with U.S. policy, doctrine, 
and capabilities applicable to the prevention and defeat of subversion 
and subversive insurgency. This is done through examination of the 
political, economic, social, and psychological factors which produce

dissidence and insurgency inimical to U.S. interests; of the nature of 
the internal and external threats; of the broad strategic concepts in-
volved in modernization and internal defense; of the availability and use 
o U.S. resources to support local governments in their efforts to pre-
vent or defeat subversive insurgency; and of the operational doctrine 
and techniques for the application and integration of these resources at 
the country team level on the basis of a common understanding of U.S. 
purposes and of the limitations on U.S. capabilities. 
Students in the Country Team Seminar 
study the origins of insurgency and available techniques to de-
feat it; 
learn as much as possible of the unique and indispensable con-
tributions the various operational arms of U.S. policy 
can bring to bear at the country team level in preventing 
and defeating insurgency inimical to U.S. interests; 
examine American AID and military assistance programs to 
gain a better understanding of their effectiveness; 
analyze methods by which U.S. resources can assist local gov-
ernments to increase their acceptability among the "crit-
ical sectors" (students, youth, elites, intelligentsia) and 
strengthen the social cohesion of the people through pro-
grams designed to close the critical gaps between urban 
centers, the government, and the countryside (civic ac-
tion, community development, agrarian reform); 
focus on methods of identifying and encouraging the "innovators" 
and entrepreneurs within developing states; 
probe the difficulties of inducing traditional establishments, 
with the help of our military and other assistance and ad-
vice, to I) move in the direction of effective internal 
defense structures based on military, paramilitary, and 
police forces; and 2) undertake programs to enhance the 
identification of populace with the constituted government. 
During the first three weeks of the seminar the en-
',tire group hears two lectures each morning devel-
oping the political, economic, and social problems 
which produce dissidence and insurgency in the un-
derdeveloped countries and the question of internal 
defense against that insurgency, both the violent and 
that which stops short of violence. Country teams 
meet each afternoon to discuss the application of U.S. 
resources to the problems of development and insur-
gency in their area. 
Both the intensive instruction given during the lec-
tures and the country team discussions emphasize 
the range of U.S. resources which can be employed 
in the field, including assistance to host governments

with economic and political problems and assistance 
in training their specialists in military, police, or 
information operations. The lecturers are experts 
in their fields and come both from government and 
from leading universities. They include ambassadors 
and officials of the secretarial level of the State De-
partment, experienced general officers from the arm-
ed services, key officials of AID and USIA, and rep-
resentatives of CIA such as Lyman Kirkpatrick and 
During the last two weeks of the course the country 
teams meet daily to apply the analyses of the first 
three weeks to selected case and country studies. 
During this time there are presentations by qualified 
experts to show how U.S. resources have been or are 
being used; these talks are not given to the whole group 
but only to country teams interested in the specific ar-
eas to be discussed. If the team finds that it needs ad-

current vital problem facing the U. S. Government. 
The written plan is presented orally to the seminar 
and a selected board of auditors for discussion, and 
it is made available in written form to appropriate 
officers in the participating agencies for their infor-
mation and possible evaluation, and to the Special 
Group (CI). 
Suggested country team problems might be: 
Possible lines of action available to the U.S. Embas-
sies in Phnom Penh and Saigon to assist the Cambo-
dian and Vietnamese Governments to reconcile their 
differences in the discovery of common interests for 
mutual security against communist subversion and 
insurgency. Consider measures to deal with Siha-
nouk's neutrality proposal so as to assure maintenance 
of the U.S. MAAG role in Cambodia while protecting 
our posture in South Vietnam. 
What action should the United States take to secure a 
more favorable attitude in Iraq toward the United 
States and its programs and policies? Are there ele-
ments in the Kurdish revolt which should be developed 
and exploited? 
Analysis of the sources of and reasons for the poten-
tial subversion of the Nkrurriah government, and pos-
sible U.S. courses of action in that connection. 
What actions should the United States take to isolate 
and separate the left sectors of the MNR in Bolivia 
and to assure control of that party by moderate ele-
ments in preparation for the 1964 elections? 
This course was instituted and developed on the rec-

who are being assigned to responsible positions in the 
underdeveloped areas to attend the course before leav-
ing for their posts. 
Ctudents assigned to this course by State are usually 
ambassadors and deputy chiefs of mission; Defense 
sends general officers and senior colonels; chiefs of 
USOM's (AID) and PAO's (USIA installations) attend, 
and the general level for CIA is chief or potential 
chief of station and key officials from substantive divi-
sions in Headquarters. The Agency is sending eight 
officers to each running of the course, which is sched-
uled about six times a year. Senior people from State, 
Defense, and the other agencies, in many cases the 
department heads, address the seminars. 
The Department of State furnishes on a reimbursable 
basis all physical facilities for the course, class-
rooms, auditorium, seminar rooms at the Foreign 
Service Institute. It also provides the clerical staff 
and the Coordinator of the course is a leading State 
officer. Many films have been made available for 
screening at the option of country teams, and both lec-
turers and teams may call upon a fully equipped audio-
visual aids department. There is a special library 
set up for the seminar, including multiple copies of 
books on the required reading list and classified ma-
terial, and a reference staff is at the service of the 
students. As mentioned before, faculty representa-
tives from each of the participating agencies are on 
hand to aid the student in their discussions and pre-
paration of reports, either by contributing their own 
knowledge and experience or by putting students in 
contact with expert guidance. 
For the benefit of those who won't have an opportunity 
to take the course but would like to look deeper into 
the subject, here are some readily obtainable selec-

NATIONAL WAR COLLEGE 
Tours CIA Headquarters 
On 18 April, the Agency was host to the entire student 
body and faculty of the National War College. At the 
invitation of General Marshall S. CarterDeputy Di-
rector of Central Intelligence, they visited Langley 
Headquarters for an all-day orientation into some of 
the more important aspects of CIA activity. 
The reason for the invitation, as expressed by General 
Carter, is that the men now at the National War Col-
lege are or will be ranking military or civilian officers, 
both in Washington and at overseas posts, with whom 
CIA will be working and upon whose cooperation much 
of the Agency's work will depend. A better understand-
ing and appreciation by them of CIA's function, opera-
tions, and capability cannot but be helpful. This is a 
major objective of those Agency employees who are 
now students at the NWC, and is the goal of those who 
planned the NWC visit. Briefly, their intention was, 
through a program of talks, visits to several areas of 
the Headquarters building, and special exhibits, to 
"surface" CIA to this group of military and civilian 
leaders. 
During the morning the NWC students met in the audi-
torium. After a brief welcome by General Carter, 
DrAlbert D Wheelon Assistant Director for Sci-
entific Intelligence, and Major General Jermain F. 
Rodenhauser, Chief of the Air Force Technical Appli-
cation Center, talked about U. S. capabilities in the 
detection and study of Soviet missile launchings and 
nuclear tests. Colonel J. C. King, Chief of the Western

Hemisphere Division, then described insurgency in 
Colombia and efforts to counteract it. Closing the 
program, General Carter answered questions on CIA. 
Lunch was served to the visitors in the north dining 
room. CIA hosts were senior Agency officials and 
Agency alumni of the NWC. 
During the afternoon the visitors divided into nine 
groups. Each group was able to see at least three or 
four of the exhibits prepared for the occasion. These 
included a very complete display of Agency publica-
tions, 
ment, selections from OTR training films, and tours 
of the Cable Secretariat, the Security Control Room, 
and Records Integration Division's computers and 
document machines. 
The Agency hopes to make a visit by the students and 
faculty of the National War College an annual event.

SOME NOTES ON 
BRIEFING 
MOSTLY OF THE HOW-TO-DO-IT SORT.... 
Most readers of this BULLETIN will at some time 
have the opportunity to give a briefing (note use of 
the word "opportunity"--briefing need not be a chore). 
Your briefing may be given just to a new employee 
who has to be shown the office ropes; it may be an 
explanation of the work of your office to a large or 
small audience, to Agency employees or to outsiders; 
briefing may be an intermittent assignment for you, 
or you may be the briefing officer of your component. 
A briefing is by nature explanatory, 
expository; it is not a sales talk or a 
welcome address or an after-dinner 
speech. Neither is it a part of a 
course, where you have more time 
for development of your topic, an op-
portunity to assign reading, and ex-
ams; a briefing must achieve maxi-
mum impact in mimimurn time. 
A veteran briefing officer lays down the following as 
essential elements of a successful briefing technique: 
I. KNOWLEDGE OF SUBJECT 
This sounds obvious, and normally you will not be 
asked to brief on a subject you know nothing about. 
But many a briefer has tried to explain something 
without really understanding it himself, or at least 
without having clearly thought it out in his own mind 
Approved For Release 2000/05/05 :4r1it4RDP78-03090A000200040004-1 
CTA INTERNAL USE ONLY 15 
SECRET 
Approved For Release 2000/05/05aelATRD17185103990A000200040004-1 
so that he can give a lucid explanation and answer 
questions. While it is a truism that subject knowl-
edge is basic to successful briefing, it is one often 
honored in the breach and worth consideration both 
by those newly come to the game and by experienced 
briefe rs. 
If, for example, the briefing you are giving is on 
the organization of an office, make sure you have 
that organization clearly pictured or charted in 
your mind, and that you are not dependent on a 
chart or vu-graph for the basic facts of your talk. 
If the purpose of your talk is to explain a proposed 
course of action, make sure you know exactly what 
action is to be recommended; what are the prelim-
inary steps, in what order, the reasons for each; 
what results are expected; what obstacles are pos-
sible, probable; what can be done to overcome 
them..., and be prepared to answer objections. 
II. ORGANIZATION 
This involves many aspects: 
1. You must have your purpose clearly in mind, know 
what you want your audience to understand or believe 
or do. 
2. You must figure out and decide how this purpose is 
to be achieved. 
3. You must fit your briefing to your audience..., each 
is unique. Learn beforehand whom you will be speak-
ing to, why they are there to hear you, what they want 
to know, how much they already know. This brings in 
the idea of selectivity, choosing material for its utility 
in this particular situation, throwing out what is not 
helpful or is harmful. 
4. You must organize your talk to fit the place and 
physical circumstances?the size of the room, need 
for or availability of loudspeakers, the ease or diffi-
culty of using visual aids there, possible disturbances. 
These things should be seen to before the briefing.

5. You must plan the talk: putting the points you 
want to cover in some order so that you can empha-
size your central idea, make your main points, group 
suppo ring material where it belongs, throw out every-
thing which is not pertinent, come to a conclusion 
without leaving out anything important. Make it logi-
cal; build each statement on a foundation. Tailor 
your material to the time available to you. 
6. In preparing your talk, don't fear to be basic. This 
does not mean talking down to your audience, for ev-
ery talk should compliment the intelligence of its 
hearers--but it is most effective, even necessary, to 
be basic, to stress fundamentals, and to give peri-
pheral aspects of your subject short shrift, or at 
least subordinate standing. 
7. You will probably have to keep in mind the require-
ments of security and the need-to-know principle. 
III. COMMUNICATION 
This, of course, is the purpose of all that went be-
fore. The best studied and organized and planned 
briefing will not be a success unless it gets through 
to the audience, unless your ideas become theirs. 
Several elements enter into the communication of 
your thoughts to your audience: your delivery, your 
contact with the audience, your use of visual aids, 
your personality (sincerity, conviction, directness, 
humor, as manifested in your platform manner) your 
reaction to and handling of questions. 
Each of these is good for an article all its own. But 
we can give a few ideas on each right here (these are 
stated very sketchily, and if you don't have access to 
a good textbook on speech or if you plan to refer to 
these notes later, you will have to flesh them out 
yourself.) 
DELIVERY 
a) Diction is your choice of words. These should be 
correct, while avoiding grammatical pur-
ism. Selection of words should be precise; 
SECRET 
Approved For Release 2000/05/0502.4AIROK8-03090A0002000400.04-1 
S4CRETs ONLY 
Approved For Release 2000/05/05 .t1A\-klbg7g-b360A000200040004-1 
your choice may depend somewhat on your 
audience, but there should never be an oc-
casion when you want to appear uneducated. 
Slang is only seldom appropriate. 
b) Voice quality. Your voice should be easily audible 
to all, but not sustained at maximum vol-
ume; clear, not harsh or breathy; flexible, 
able to vary constantly in volume, pitch, 
rate, inflection; unaffected; pleasant, with-
out (to damage a metaphor beyond repair) 
a chip on its shoulder; lively, reflecting ani-
mation and emphasis. 
c) Articulation. Without clear and distinct pronuncia-
tion and enunciation of your words, your 
ideas will not be understood or even heard 
by your audience. Even mild failure in 
articulation subjects the audience to unwar-
ranted effort. Most bad enunciation is 
caused by not opening the mouth adequately 
and not using the lips. 
d) Speed--too fast and no one can understand you, too 
slow and all will go to sleep. Your aim: 
clear enunciation, logical grouping of words, 
and a fairly even rate of speed. 
e) Volume. Make sure you are being heard--that's the 
level you want. Shouting may antagonize 
your audience and will certainly injure your 
throat. 
f) Gestures should be natural and uncontrived, empha-
size what you are saying, not draw attention 
away from it (which can happen both if they 
are inept and if they are too flamboyant). 
Remember that head movements and facial 
expressions are also gestures. A good rule 
for the hands: unless you have a good nat-
ural reason for a gesture, do nothing with 
them. 
g) Platform manner should show confidence (felt or 
unfelt), create a good impression, induce a 
positive response. This will happen if you 
are alert, pleasant, friendly, natural, en-
thusiastic. Look at the audience, at indi-
viduals in the audience, not at the ceiling 
or out the window or at the floor. Control

body actions, avoiding up-and-down move-
ments, swaying, pacing, jiggling change 
in pockets. Stand erect, at ease, every 
movement under control. 
VISUAL AIDS should be 
a) easy to see (did you ever try reading half-inch 
letters from the rear of a large room or viewing 
a slide when the projector is in the way?) 
b) easy to handle (examples of what not to use are a 
chart too heavy or awkward for you to lift, a map 
folded 17 times, a picture rolled so tightly it 
won't stay unrolled, a projector which won't pro-
ject.) 
c) attractive, but not distracting (remember that it 
is an "aid", not the purpose of the briefing.) 
d) clear (expressing the ideas you want to get over 
or emphasize, and no others); simple (not clut-
tered with extraneous material or so elaborately 
lettered or designed as to confuse more than help.) 
e) dynamic (it's better to limit yourself to black-
board and chalk than to depend on a static display; 
parenthetically inside these parentheses, the use 
of chalk can be very creative, illustrating a talk 
as it develops and in accord with audience need 
and interest.) 
f) designed, if possible, for the particular audience 
with which it is used. 
g) thoroughly planned in advance, including an attempt 
to anticipate everything which can go wrong. 
(Editor's Note; The use of visual aids will be the sub-
ject of a separate article in an early issue of the 
BULLETIN.) 
HANDLING QUESTIONS--How To 
Often there will be a question period following your 
briefing; there may be questions even if not expected. 
Here are some suggestions on how to handle them: 
Try to anticipate what points may be raised and pre-
pare for them. 
Approved For Release 2000/MOAT:EgWVF07g-03090A00020004009f-1 
SF.CRET 
Approved For Release 2000/05/05c!tiATAitilbitEO9Jt0A000200040004-1 
If the questioner is asking for information, answer 
him, if you can, by expanding, amplifying, or re-
phrasing your briefing material. If you don't know 
the answer, say so. 
If the question is argumentative it may support your 
stand or take issue with you. If the former, be grate-
ful for the support; if the latter, answer as best you 
can, recognize the questioner's right to differ, and 
turn as soon as possible to another question. 
If the query is irrelevant, handle as gently as possi-
ble, trying to avoid offending the questioner, who is 
sure his problem is pertinent. 
Do not repeat a question unless audience cannot hear 
it or you are not sure you understand it. 
If you have a question period but no one asks any, try 
to stimulate some. When time is up, firmly cut the 
questions short. 
SOME COMMON PROBLEMS 
1. Nervousness. Even years of experience are no 
guarantee that you won't feel the familiar "butter-
flies". One thing you should remember is that 
the audience is not likely to know you are nervous 
unless you tell them. And one of the best ways of 
hiding and dissipating nervousness is through con-
trolled bodily movement; perhaps read your in-
troductory remarks, begin by writing on the black-
board, take a moment to adjust a visual aid or 
begin the talk by drawing attention to it, or begin 
with an extra forceful voice. These and other 
types of physical activity release the emotional 
tension which is making you nervous. 
2. The vocalized pause, usually a long or short "uh", 
sometimes one or more per sentence. There is 
only one solution--be conscious of the habit and 
practice getting along without it.

zo 
SECRET , 
Approved For Release 2000/0cgibetitlaPcill-103090A000200040004-1 
3. Avoid dropping your voice at the end of sentences. 
4. The mental blackout--you can't for the moment 
remember a thing. First, realize it won't last 
long, even though it may seem long to you. You 
may be able to make it seem a deliberate pause, 
Remember too that you are the only one who knew 
what you were going to say and thus the only one 
who knows that you have forgotten. Check your 
notes. Forge ahead on the next topic of your 
briefing. If what you have forgotten comes back 
to you, fit it in if appropriate; otherwise, ignore 
it. 
5. Disturbances inside or outside the room. Ignore 
them unless they interfere with communication 
between you and the audience. If they do, pause 
until they end; if they refuse to end, do something. 
6. Should you read your talk? Although there are 
some occasions which demand that a speech be 
read, this is not true of a briefing. In addition, 
a talk read to an audience is seldom as effective 
as one (seemingly) ad libbed or given extempora-
neously. The use of a script ties you to the lec-
turn, inhibits gestures and the use of visual aids, 
may distract or displease audience. And it doesn't 
make last minute changes or inspirations easy. 
If you must read, try to follow the same rules of 
composition given above. 
7. Hands?what to do with. If not gesturing, they 
should hang at your sides, relaxedly.... not in 
your pockets. 
8. How do I end my talk? Restate and stress the 
main points, succinctly and vividly, if you can; 
summarize anything else worth repeating; and 
end; 
9. Do I need an introduction? It helps, but make it 
short.

SECRET 
Approved For Release 2000/05/0V camown-ttm9oA0002oom0004-1 
10. Talking down to the audience. This results 
more from an attitude of mind than from choice 
of words. Remember that your hearers are in-
telligent men, not children. Choose a nontech-
nical vocabulary, though, unless you are talking 
to technicians. 
Editor's Note: In a sense, what you have been read-
ing was a briefing. For your own benefit, go back 
over it and decide whether it follows its own rules, 
where it fails. Does the "briefer" seem to know what 
he is talking about? Can you see any evidence of a 
plan? Has he made his purpose clear and achieved 
it? You can't judge delivery, of course, but has he 
done everything required of him before presenting it 
orally? Has he anticipated most of your questions? 
The teaching machine?still in the process of estab-
lishing a place for itself in the educational curricu-
lum?has won recognition as an interesting historical 
development. The Smithsonian Institution in Wash-
ington has asked Ohio State University for the loan of 
the first teaching machine for display with the origi-
nal patent models of such historic inventions as the 
phonograph, telegraph, sewing machine and cotton gin. 
Invented by Dr. Sidney L. Pressey, who retired from 
the university as professor emeritus in 1959, the 
teaching machine was shown to the American Psycho-
logical Association in 19Z5, the year it was built. Dr 
Pressey, now 74 years old, teaches educational psy-
chology at the University of Arizona. 
His teaching machine, built from typewriter parts, 
asked the student questions with a choice of four pos-
sible answers. If the student selected the wrong an-
swer, he was helped to find the correct answer. The 
machine also recorded his attempts and rewarded 
good performance with a piece of candy.

37 years of age and should have demonstrated leader-
ship ability and a potential for broader management 
responsibilities. Candidates must also have completed 
the Agency's Management Course. Requests to attend

SOME GENERALIZATIONS ABOUT PEOPLE 
IHII 1111 IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII 
The following observations and generalizations are drawn 
from the experiences of a number of successful managers. 
These are by no means rules for human relations. Their ap-
plication as such without the presence and underlying support 
of a sound managerial outlook is not likely to be successful. 
These observations do not establish techniques but may as-
sist the manager to develop and mold useful attitudes toward 
himself and toward those people with whom he must deal to 
achieve a smooth operation within his organization. 
People's behavior is caused to a very great extent by habit 
and emotion, and to a much lesser extent by consid-
erations of reason. 
People are different; they expect and deserve to be treated 
as individuals. 
People work best when they know that their chief is interested 
in them. 
People work harder when helped to feel important than when 
motivated by fear. They like to get credit when they 
deserve it. 
People are generally averse to sudden changes; they are more 
likely to accept them if they are prepared for them. 
People try to live up to the supervisor's expectations of them. 
Subordinates often copy the way the chief does things. 
People like to receive simple, clear, understandable instruc-
tions so that they know what is expected and how the 
supervisor wants it done. They work best when inform-
ed of matters that concern them. 
People work best when they feel that they belong; they wish to 
participate in an organization's undertakings. 
People will work best for a supervisor whom they trust and 
respect; they look for consistency of treatment from 
the standpoint of knowing what the supervisor will per-
mit and what he will not allow. 
People work best for a supervisor who likes people and mani-
fests an interest in their personal affairs.

People expect and deserve to be punished or reprimanded 
when it is required. Supervisors should establish 
standards of behavior and effectiveness that must be 
met. 
People dislike and resent public criticism and unfavorable 
comparison to others in the group; they dislike "losing 
face". 
People will produce more when there is some incentive pres-
ent; they like to know the objectives of the team. 
People like to feel that they are using the abilities they have 
and that their future will be secure if they do a good 
job 
People like to be told, in the right way, when they are doing 
something wrong; but they also like to be told the cor-
rect way or how to improve. 
People like to be understood and to know where they "stand".

(Continued from page 4) 
"But are there any swamps on the moon?" I inquir-
ed, attempting to suggest she might be practicing a 
deceit the school directors would view dimly. 
"That," she replied severely, "is neither here nor 
there." 
Possibly Miss Grosskopf was a little weak on lunar 
bogs. 
"We mustn't predispose the young imagination, sir, " 
she cautioned, gently now, intimating that perhaps it 
would not be necessary after all to keep me in after 
class. 
"The children will discover and interpret as they prog-
ress. Should they decide on the evidence that there 
are no swamps on the moon, then they will create one 
proper to a lunar environment which would permit 
swamps. We do want to encourage creativity, don't 
we? We do see now, don't we?" 
I felt I had been burped. 
Walking down the hall, I reported to my wife: "George's 
class is going to build a swamp." 
"That's odd," Myrtle said as she went on setting tile 
in the bathroom, "you'd think a school like that would 
have gotten one long ago."
