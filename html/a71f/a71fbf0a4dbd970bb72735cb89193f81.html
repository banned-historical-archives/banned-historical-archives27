chief in Moscow, said that he felt the Soviet attitude toward 
?Nasir was "hardening." He counseled Syrian-Lebanese Commu-

stress Egypt's "exploitation" of Syria, but to  avoid calling for

Venezuela: Economic problems confronting the coalition of 
President Betancourt could touch off a political crisis. Depletion 
of the country's' foreign exchange and signs of growing opposition to 
foreign investments in iron and oil are causing a loss of business 
confidence. Betancourt's broad military and civilian support was 
recently demonstrated when the government cted against conspira-
torial activity, but considerable unrest apparently prevails beneath 
the surface calm. The mid-October transfer of 30 military officers 
to posts outside Caracas suggests that some dissidence exists 
within the armed forces. Page 6)

I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Mao Tse-tung Indicates Desire to Increase Influence in Asian 
Communist Parties 
'Peiping's desire to diminish Soviet influence and iprreaRp its 
own in Asian Communist movements were indicated to I  
Mao 
Tse-tung hinted that the Chinese want to lead the Asian 
Communist parties on the grounds that the problems facing Asian 
Communists are better appreciated by the Chinese-01 
Whatever its claims to keener insight into Asian Communist 
problems, Peiping's advice, like Moscow's,has in fact served pri-
marily to advance its own foreign policy interests and only second-
arily the interests of the Asian Communists. The Indian Commu-
nists, for example, were asked by Peiping to take a pro-Chinese 
stand on the Tibet revolt. Later, they were embarrassed by ve-
hement Chinese statements�including attacks on "Indian expan-
sionists"--and had to advise the Chinese to moderate their attacks 
on New Delhi.1 
iPeiping in the past year has had considerable contact with 
Communist leaders from Japan, Indonesia, and India. In an ef-
fort to avoid the appearance of directly challenging Moscow's in-
fluence, however, Chinese counsel has generally been offered as 
complementary to rather than competitive with that of the USSR. 
Peiping apparently agreed with Soviet advice to the Indian Commu-
nists to rely on "parliamentary means" to come to power; but the 
Chinese went on to counsel the Indian party to adopt a "tougher" 
line than it has previously followed in opposing certain policies 
of the Congress party. "United front" tactics for the Japanese 
Communists, apparently sanctioned by Moscow, were reaffirmed 
as appropriate for the Japanese party in the communique signed 
in Peiping on 20 October between Liu Sliao-chi and party chairman 
Nosaka.I

Hungarian Party Factionalism on Eve oitvongress  
/Acrimonious factional debate within the politburo and central 
committee of the Hungarian party has broken out over the extent 
and direction of agricultural and industrial development during the 
period of the next Five-Year Plan, 1961-65, 
The last 
time a factional struggle within the Hungarian party reached sim-
ilar heights--at the party conference in June 1957--it was glossed 
over, but the basic issues were not resolved. Intraparty unity 
was again threatened during the December 1958 central committee 
meeting, by the decision to speed up collectivizatiorq, 
fft_alinist elements led by Depaty Premier and politburo mem-
ber Antal Apro, Minister of Heavy Industry Janos Czergo, and the 
director of the party's central school, Geza Kassai, favor a more 
rapid completion of agricultural collectivization and greater em-
phasis on the expansion of heavy industry than is called for in party 
leader Kadar's draft plan. The group reportedly advanced its views 
at a central committee meeting in September, but was rebuffed 
by ICadar's supporters, from whom politburo member Jena Fock 
was then designated to present the draft plan to the Congress on 
30 November instead of Apro� who was reportedly in line for the 
assignment. 
apro then is said to have formalized his objections in a memo-
randum which he asked Soviet Ambassador Shtykov to forward to 
Moscow. Shtykov is known to have left for Moscow unexpectedly 
on 26 October. In the meantime, Apro has twice taken issue pub-
licly with the draft plan's provisions on agriculture. On 16 Octo-
ber he called for the complete "socialist" reorganization of agri-
culture by 1965--a goal carefully avoided in the plan--and on 24 
October he said that present conditions favor the "total socialist 
transformation" of the villages within the next five years:4 
Ca_se pite these implicit disagreements, Apro was chosen to 
deliver a report on deficiencies in Hungary's present economic 
planning to another central committee meeting on 22 October. 
While no decision on his future has apparently yet been made!!

party functionaries reportedly anticipate that Apro and his ex-
tremist colleagues will be demoted at the congress. Press crit-
icism of "dogmatists" and "sectarians"--ostensibly within the 
party's lower ranks--has become increasingly bitter during the 
past four weeks, suggesting that Kadar may be planning decisive 
action to overcome the influence of Stalinist elements in both the 
higher and lower levels of the party apparatus-d

Bakdash States' Views. on (�ompunibrn  
S rian Communist leader Khalid Bakdash, now in exile 
in the Communist bloc, said early this m'onth that he believed 
Iraq should be kept neutral for the present. Speaking in Moscow 
to the secretary general of the :Lebanese Communist party, 
Nicolas Shawi, Bakdash voiced the hope tat the Lebanese Com-
munists would give "sensible advice" to their Iraqi counterparts 
who, he said, had realized their previous extremist policy had 
been wrorig), 
Lon Soviet-UAR relations, Bakdash said Moscow's attitude 
toward Nasir was "hardening" and implied that, although the 
USSR had not attacked Nasir politically as yet, such action is 
likely to occur if his accommodation with the West reaches the 
point where his personal popularity and influence in the Arab 
world become vtnerable. Meanwhile, Bakdash advised Arab 
Communists to keep up their attacks on Nasir's policies, empha-
sizing Egyptian "exploitation" of Syria but not calling for dis-
solution of the union. Bakdash further advised the Lebanese 
Communist party to continue supporting Prime Minister Karami, 
whom he considered a lesser evil than other candidates for the 
Lebanese premiershii5.4 
(Shawl. told Bakdash that since Nasir's crackdown there were 
probably between 200 and 300 Communists underground in Syria, 
with their activities limited to keeping the party alive. He gave

Shah Asked to Give Friendly Israeli Message to Jordan's  
King Husayn  
Israeli Foreign Minister Golda Meir, 
has requested that, when the 
Shah of Iran visits Jordan on 2 November, he convey a message of 
Israeli good will to King Husayn. Mrs. Meir reportedly said that 
Israel has always had friendly feelings toward the King personally, 
citing the fact that at the time the British were sending emergency 
aid to Jordan following the Iraqi revolution, "He did not prevent 
the flight of their planes over Israel." 
Her remarks reflect Israel's continued interest in the per-
petuation of Husayn's relatively weak regime as an alternative to 
a Nasir-dominated Jordan. Israel and Jordan have a 330-mile com-
mon border, passing about 12 miles from Tel Aviv, which would b 
difficult for Israel to defend. fin the past Israel has stressed that 
if a pro-Nasir regime should come to power in Jordan, Israel 
would probably feel compelled--as a "defensive" measure--to oc-
cupy West Jordan--the Palestinian sector of the country west of 
the Jordan River:' 
Mrs. Meir made similar cordial references to Husayn last 
April, calling him a courageous young man with hitherto unsus-
pected potentialities for leadership. At that time, in a conversa-
tion with the American charge, she said Israel had no complaint 
about the Jordanian Government's attitude, and that she was con-
vinced the occasional border incidents were unrelated to any Jor-
danian policy. 
(Husayn probably will welcome the message, since he has been 
concerned over what Israel's reaction might be if Jordan found it 
"necessary" to preserve the integrity of its borders or even to 
take some sort of action in Iraq. He remains in contact with a 
group of royalist Iraqi exiles who want him to aid their plans to 
re-establish the Iraqi monarchy-.1

cordial though informal relations with the Israelis. Israel has pro-
moted a close intelligence relations:lip with Iran and imports

III. THE WEST 
Situation in Venezuela  
Venezuelan President Betancourt% coalition is confronted by 
economic problems�especially a decline of foreign exchange and 
a loss of business confidence--which could touch off a serious 
political crisis. At the end of August,Venezuelan exchange re-
serves, although the highest in Latin America, had dropped to 
about $9301000,000, and less than a third of this amount was in 
liquid dollar reserves, which have been dwindling rapidly. The 
president of Venezuela's largest oil company has expressed con-
cern that the need for foreign exchange may cause the sale of 
gold that makes up the remainder of the exchange reserves, and 
that this would cause a complete loss of confidence abroad and a 
panic in Venezuela. He said the government had already asked 
the oil industry to buy $300,000,000 worth of short-term treasury 
notes. 
The uncertainty has been compounded by rumors of plotting 
and financial deterioration; by recent policy statements by the 
minister of mines unfavorable to the economically important for-
eign-owned oil and mininginterest�;andby the threat of a paralyz-
ing strike accompanied by violence if negotiations for a new oil-
worker g contract fail. 
The basic stability of Betancourt% regime was demonstrated 
by the broad civilian and military support which rallied to him af-
ter the government arrested about 40 persons in Caracas for con-
spiratorial activity on 12-13 October. The recent transfer of 30 
military officers to posts outside the capital suggests, however, 
that dissidence is present in some degree in the armed forces.
