 Casualties and property damage in the fighting between Muslims and Christians
 have been extensive in both Tripoli and Zagharta, and the 2,000-3,000 militiamen
 on each side have now abandoned combat at close quarters and returned to their
 usual tactic of shelling from fixed positions.
 The militia of the right-wing Phalanges Party, which played a central role in the
 violence in Beirut earlier this year, has not become deeply involved in the latest
 fighting. The party, Lebanon's largest Christian political organization, is not strong
 in the area where the fighting is taking place.
 The major fedayeen groups are also staying on the sidelines, despite the
 presence of some 16,000 Palestinians in two refugee camps near Tripoli.                    25X1

 he government continues to resist calling in the army. Kamal Jumblatt,
 leader of the Progressive Socialist Party, has warned Prime Minister Karami against
 using the army, and leaders of Beirut's Muslim community have predicted civil war if
 the army becomes involved.
 The cabinet met for the second time in two days yesterday. Following the
 meeting, Karami said "measures" had been decided upon and would be announced
 today. Newspapers in Beirut reported this morning that the army would be ordered
 today to intervene in the fighting. They said that the cabinet yesterday had agreed
 to give army commander Iskandar Ghanim a six-month leave of absence. Ghanim is a
 Christian and a long-time supporter of President Franjiyah.
 Ghanim might be replaced by army chief of staff Nasrallah, a Druze, who
 would be acceptable to both sides in the present dispute. Another possibility is army
 intelligence chief Jules Bustani, who has in the past served in a liaison capacity
 between the Lebanese army and the fedayeen. He is a Christian, but he would be
 much less objectionable to Muslims than Ghanim.

 Portuguese Socialists appear to be taking full advantage of the Communists'
 recent setbacks, although they remain concerned that their gains could be wiped out
 by an attempt to seize power from either the right or the left.
 Socialist sources have told the US embassy that Prime Minister - designate
 Azevedo has agreed to form a government based on the Socialist program and that
 the new cabinet could be announced as early as today. These sources are also
 claiming that in fact they turned down an opportunity to form a Socialist
 government because they did not want the other parties criticizing on the sidelines
 at a time when tough decisions are necessary.
 The Socialists claim that they will be given at least five of the approximately 15
 cabinet posts, although they  may  have  reached this number by including
 independents sympathetic to their cause. According to the Socialists' version of the
 new cabinet, the Popular Democrats-who finished a respectable second to the
 Socialists in the elections last April-will receive two posts, and the Communists will
 be given at least one and possibly two. The Communists might still reject such a
 reduction in their own role unless pro-Communist military officers are also present
 in the new lineup.
 The Socialist Party reportedly hopes to seize the initiative while things are
 going its way so as to gain effective control of the government. The Socialists'
 strategy includes an effort to convince the military to return to the barracks and an
 attempt to disarm the various revolutionary groups, including the Communists'
 paramilitary apparatus-which they claim numbers approximately 6,000 in the
 Lisbon area.

 Phnom Penh gave Prince Sihanouk and his party a festive welcome when they
 arrived in the Cambodian capital yesterday.
 The Prince was accompanied by Deputy Prime Minister Khieu Samphan.
 Deputy Prime Minister for National Defense Son Sen delivered the welcoming
 address.
 The Khmer communists apparently have been trying for some time to entice
 Sihanouk to return. The invitation, tendered to the Prince when he was in
 Pyongyang in mid-July, evidently was not the first one offered him. Although
 Sihanouk has dutifully served as a mouthpiece for the communists since their
 take-over in mid-April, the Cambodian leadership is well aware of his record of
 unpredictable behavior and probably wants to have more control over his actions.
 They may also have been concerned about the Prince's earlier reported threats to
 renounce his title and go into permanent exile abroad, from where he could snipe at
 regime policies.
 The Prince's current visit to Phnom Penh will be short. He will return to China
 to attend the National Day celebrations on October 1, then travel to New York to
 address the UN General Assembly. From New York, he will go to Pyongyang for the
 anniversary of the Korean Workers' Party on October 10, and finally return to
 Peking to commemorate his birthday on October 31. Following this round of travel,
 Sihanouk may be resigned to spending most of his time in Phnom Penh.
 Sihanouk's decision to return to the inhospitable political conditions in Phnom
 Penh was a difficult one, but he apparently decided that the trappings of high office,
 at least for a while, are better than obscure retirement abroad. He has, in fact, little
 leverage in dealing with the Khmer communists.

 The Chinese ambassador to Cambodia may have been aboard the aircraft
 carrying Sihanouk to Phnom Penh. A press report quoting diplomatic sources in
 Peking said he would be, but Phnom Penh did not announce the ambassador's
 arrival. If the Chinese envoy did come, he would be the first foreign ambassador to
 be allowed back in Phnom Penh since the communist take-over. At any rate, Peking
 appears to have cemented its ties with the Khmer communists.
 The Chinese have continually accorded Sihanouk correct and sometimes even
 lavish treatment. At a farewell banquet on September 6, Vice Premier Teng
 Hsiao-ping expressed his "sincere wish" that Sihanouk and Prime Minister Penn
 Nouth would continue their contributions to national unity and development. The
 Chinese almost certainly have not pushed hard for a significant political role for
 Sihanouk, however, out of fear of antagonizing their Khmer communist friends.
 Indeed,   they  probably  regarded  his continued  residence  in China as an
 embarrassment and played some role in paving the way for his departure.
 PORTUGUESE TIMOR
 The left-wing Revolutionary Front for the Independence of Timor (Fretilin) on
 September 8 announced victory in the month-long strife.
 Meanwhile, the leftists have publicly abandoned their demand for immediate
 independence and are calling for a gradual decolonization program similar to the one
 announced by Portugal in June.
 Indonesian President Suharto will probably come under further general staff
 pressure to order unilateral action before Fretilin consolidates its control and

 UN Secretary General Waldheim again was unable yesterday to get Greek and
 Turkish Cypriot negotiators Clerides and Denktash to agree on an agenda for their
 present round of meetings in New York. Waldheim intends to have the negotiators
 meet in formal session today in an attempt to obtain agreement for another round
 of talks at a later date.
 Denktash gave a negative reply yesterday to a proposal by Waldheim that the
 Turkish Cypriots consider permitting the return of some Greek Cypriot refugees to
 Famagusta. Waldheim believed that such a move could compensate for Denktash's
 unwillingness to follow through on his promise to address the territorial question
 and make it worthwhile for Clerides to negotiate.
 Denktash told Waldheim on Monday that problems with his colleagues in
 Cyprus as well as the attitude of the Turkish government made it impossible for him
 to discuss the territorial question during the current talks. Denktash added that he
 would be prepared to address the territorial question sometime after the Senate
 elections in Turkey on October 12 and the Turkish Cypriot elections later in the
 year. The Turkish Cypriot leader said when pressed that he might agree to another
 round of talks in late November.
 Clerides remains steadfast in his refusal to participate informal talks unless
 Denktash presents concrete proposals on the territorial question. He agreed,
 however, to seek instructions from his government on the question of another round
 of talks in the future to discuss the territorial question. Clerides told a US official
 later in the day that the talks should be adjourned and no date set for another
 round, but he may have been expressing his own opinion. He acknowledged that a
 break-up of the talks by the Greek Cypriots would free the Turks from the
 obligation of maintaining the status quo on Cyprus and provoke them into settling
 Turks in the Greek Cypriot section of Famagusta, which has for the most part been
 left vacant.
 Ankara may yet instruct Denktash to offer something to the Greek Cypriots
 with an eye to securing a lifting of the US arms embargo, but Clerides is under
 equally strong pressure from Athens and President Makarios to reject any token
 gestures that might help the Turkish case on the embargo.

 High-ranking officials are taking steps to reassure the Israeli people that
 security matters will not be de-emphasized in the aftermath of the Israeli-Egyptian
 Sinai accord.
 Prime Minister Rabin is emphasizing that the new interim agreement should
 lessen the danger of a coordinated simultaneous attack from a number of sectors.
 Cautioning against the expectation that large sums would be spent on economic
 development, Rabin has remarked that at least 75 percent of the US assistance
 would be used to finance arms, and that other US aid would be used to compensate
 for the loss of Sinai oil.
 Defense Minister Peres is pointing out that the Israeli Defense Forces still face
 the primary problems of terrorist activity and a possible flare-up on the Syrian and
 Jordanian fronts, as well as the need for developing new defensive concepts and
 systems.
 Peres pledged that the counterterriorism campaign will be improved. He also
 made clear the defense forces' preference for maintaining the initiative against the
 fedayeen by striking their base camps in Lebanon. He pointed out that these
 operations are designed to avoid harming civilians and with a view toward causing
 minimal political damage to the Lebanese government. Peres reaffirmed Tel Aviv's
 policy of dealing with the fedayeen only on the battlefield and of not submitting to
 terrorists' blackmail attempts.
 The defense minister also stressed that the defense forces must be prepared for
 a Syrian-sponsored attack on the northern and eastern fronts involving Jordan, Iraq,
 Lebanon, and the PLO.
 In the Sinai, field fortifications must be built and new defense plans developed
 that will emphasize mobile operations, according to Peres. He also said that the
 Defense Ministry intends to complete fortifications along the Jordan River. Civil and
 regional defense will also receive increased priority. They have been largely neglected

 Moscow is missing no opportunity to continue registering its disapproval of the
 Sinai disengagement agreement.
 According to Western press reports, Soviet officials plan to boycott the
 working sessions of the Egyptian-Israeli military group in Geneva, which are to work
 out details for the accord's implementation. This would be further evidence of the
 Soviets' displeasure, following their failure to attend last week's signing ceremonies.
 Moscow's news media are stressing that the agreement failed to resolve basic
 Middle East problems and has served to heighten rather than reduce tensions in the
 area. The press on September 7 for the first time carried an article that charges that
 the accord was reached outside the framework of the Geneva peace conference. I n
 an apparent attempt to attack the accord's legitimacy, Pravda noted that the
 "negotiations had an obviously separate character," despite efforts to give it the
 "outward appearance" of being within the Geneva context. The article concludes by
 restating  Moscow's standard formula for achieving a settlement-multilateral
 negotiations involving all interested parties-but did not specify the Geneva
 conference.
 According to a Soviet official, the Soviet community in Cairo has initiated a
 word-of-mouth campaign critical of the accord. He said that Egyptian communists
 reportedly have joined in this effort and are said to have begun spreading criticism
 among the people.

 Responding to an unprecedented upsurge in left-wing violence and kidnapings,
 President Peron has formally outlawed the Montonero guerrillas, who supported the
 return of Juan Peron. This may be the first step in a major government offensive
 against terrorism.
 Although the Montoneros themselves declared "war" on President Peron in
 September 1974, her government had avoided taking official action for fear of
 antagonizing many moderately liberal Peronists, who do not necessarily agree with
 the Montoneros but have been alienated by the conservative policies of the present
 administration. Because of their position and strength, the Montoneros have played
 an effective political role through agitation within the Peronist labor movement.
 They even fielded candidates under the banner of the "Authentic Party" in a recent
 provincial election.
 The government's decision gives security forces great freedom of action in
 counterinsurgency operations. Until now, sympathetic newspapers and broadcasting
 stations could force the release of Montonero guerrillas held without charge by
 publicizing their names. Such actions in behalf of outlawed groups, however, are
 forbidden under current censorship restrictions.
 Other measures are likely to be announced soon. The new army commander,
 General Jorge Videla, has told newsmen that the army's anti-guerrilla operations in
 Tucuman  Province-where the principal  opponent has been the People's
 Revolutionary Army-could be extended throughout the country  "if the
 circumstances warranted it." He added that a federal organization might be formed
 to coordinate the actions of all the security forces.
 The Montoneros and the People's Revolutionary Army hope to goad the armed
 forces leaders into ousting the civilian government, which they regard  as
 insufficiently  radical.  The  expected popular revulsion against military
 administration, they believe, would virtually assure a left-wing political victory once
 elections were held. In pursuit of this long-range goal, the guerrillas have been
 focusing their terrorist attacks on all branches of the armed forces.
 Economic deterioration and mounting violence could in time bring about the
 political polarization the extremists seek. Recent statements by military leaders
 strongly indicate that they have decided to support the government in the initiative
 against the terrorists rather than allow the situation to deteriorate further.

 Romania is demonstrating its continuing close ties with Peking, perhaps in
 reaction to fresh assaults on the Chinese by the Kremlin.
 Ilie Verdet, a member of the Romanian Politburo and party secretary for cadre
 affairs, arrived unexpectedly in Peking on Friday at the head of the highest level
 Romanian delegation that has visited China since President Ceausescu was there in
 1971. The Romanians are en route home from North Vietnam's 30th anniversary
 celebrations.
 In Peking, Verdet specifically praised the leadership of Mao Tse-tung and
 emphasized the good relations between the Romanian and Chinese parties; both
 sides pledged to expand their ties. On Sunday, Verdet met with Chou En-lai to
 convey Ceausescu's personal greetings and best wishes to the Chinese leadership.
 The timing of the visit suggests that it was a calculated act of defiance of
 Moscow. It comes on the heels of an authoritative, very harsh attack on China and
 its supporters published in the Soviet party's theoretical journal, Kommunist.
 Indeed, Kommunist warned that those who are neutral or conciliatory toward Mao
 and his policies "objectively promote the anti-Marxist, anti-socialist aims of the
 Chinese leadership."
 Verdet's presence in China puts Moscow on notice that Romania clearly
 intends to oppose any criticism of the Chinese-or any attempt to read them out of
 the international communist movement-at the proposed conference of European
 communist parties.
 In the past, Ceausescu has demonstrated a remarkable ability to gauge the
 limits of Soviet tolerance to his displays of independence. After the Verdet trip, he
 may now pull in his horns and, at least over the short run, become more
 accommodating toward Moscow-but without compromising what he regards as the
 principles of Romania's independence within the Warsaw Pact.

 COLOMBIA: The assassination on Monday of inspector general of the armed
 forces Rincon was apparently the work of the pro-Havana National Liberation
 Army. Although Rincon was a staff officer, he previously headed the brigade most
 involved in containing the group's rural guerrillas.
