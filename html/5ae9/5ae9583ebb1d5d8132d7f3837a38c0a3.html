 "On the        Cultural Purge Hits Chi-
 Receiving                              com Propagandists Hard
 End"
 According to the NEW YORK
 TIMES, 23 November 1966,
 at least 20 of the leading propagand-
 ists of the Chinese Communist Party
 (CCP) have been purged.   Among them
 were Chou Yang, Deputy Director of
 Propaganda for the Central Committee
 of the CCP; Wang Kuang, propaganda
 chief for 5 central-south provinces;
 and Tseng Tun, a propaganda leader
 for Hupeh Province.   All had held
 their posts for many years.   (MEDIA
 LINES, BPG #197, 15 August 1966 rem
 ported the dismissal of Lu Ting-yi
 as head of CCP propaganda operations,
 and also as Minister of Culture.)
 The Chinese press has been denounc-
 ing these men for weeks, asserting
 that for years they frustrated the
 will of Chairman Mao.   The "evidence"
 against them consisted of their pub-
 lished statements and informers' re-
 ports of private conversations with
 them.in which they questioned certain
 official views and programs.   Taken
 together, the charges against them
 are a catalogue of what constitutes
 ideological` heresy in China to-day.
 Among the main charges against such
 men as Messrs. Chou, Wang and Tseng
 are that they denigrated the idea of
 Mao's infallibility and opposed the
 (disastrous) "Great Leap Forward" of
 1958.   They are also accused of op-
 posing rural communes, the supremacy
 of politics over technique in art and
 literature, and the renewed class
 struggle (precursor in 1965 to the
 "great cultural revolution" of 1966).
 Having said that China should run
 schools known for academic excellence,
 Chou is accused of having clearly
 tried to abolish the party leader-
 ship over schools and turn them
 into "bourgeois nurseries."   (Actu-
 ally, a telling comment on Commu-
 nis education!)  Wang is quoted
 as having said (during the 1965
 campaign to revive the class strug-
 gle between poor peasants and old
 bourgeois elements) that it would
 be more profitable to "collect more
 manure in your spare time".
 Terms are      "Socialism" and
 grossly        "Capitalism'
 distorted
 The term "capitalism"
 has been discredited
 throughout much of the world by the
 success of the Marxists in labeling
 everything bad as a,product of "capi-
 talism," abetted in this by rapac-
 iously exploitative capitalists
 (unfortunately still extant in some
 countries of the world).   Conse-
 quently it is generally more effec-
 tive to speak of "free enterprise"
 or "private enterprise" than of
 "capitalism."
 However, as confused as the
 meaning of "capitalism" may be, it
 is easily surpassed by the distor-
 tion which has arisen in the use
 of the word "socialism."  The Sov-
 iets proclaim that theirs is a
 "socialist" regime which is build-
 ing "communism," and they speak of
 the "socialist camp," excluding
 therefrom the socialist governments
 of Sweden or England which are part
 of the "capitalist camp."

 For propaganda purposes we must
 persist in labeling Communists as
 "Communists," and refer to the "Com-
 munist bloc" rather than the "social-
 ist camp" (and never the "people's
 democracies" -- unless, perhaps, one
 refers to the "so-called people's
 democracies").
 The confusion in these terms
 was discussed in a useful article
 which appeared in the Review of the
 Swiss Press on 1 November 1966, a
 copy of which is enclosed -- in
 English and French.
 Cadre Schools    AAL APSO Fostering
 For Three        Guerrilla Warfare
 Continents
 Some countries were
 shocked by the declarations issued
 by the Tri-Continent Conference in
 Havana, January 1966.   The Economic
 Committee of the Tri-CC, for example,
 passed a Resolution calling for
 "economic, financial, and material
 aid of all kinds, including arms
 and munitions, to the authentic
 representatives of the countries
 which fight with arms in their hands,
 so that they may liberate their
 country and consolidate peace in--the
 world."  Reaction was particularly
 strong in Latin America.   The Uru-
 guayan Foreign Minister publicly
 demanded a formal clarification of
 the declarations made by the chief
 Soviet delegate, Sharaf R. Rashidov,
 at the conference and of his status
 as an official representative of
 the Soviet government.   After con-
 sulting with Moscow, the Soviet
 ambassador in Montevideo rather
 lamely alleged that Rashidov repre-
 sented a "Soviet social organization,"
 rather than the Soviet government.
 The Havana declarations were not
 empty threats.  The permanent orga-
 nization created at the conference
 -- the Afro-Asian~Latin American
 People's Solidarity Organization
 (AALAPSO) -- on 18 November 1966
 called for the establishment of
 schools to train political cadres
 of the revolutionary movement in
 Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
 The same communique revealed that
 Cuba and North Korea have already
 agreed to create such institutions.
 Thus we have an official announce-
 ment of AALAPSO (of which the USSR
 claims to be a leading member)
 overtly announcing the establishment
 of schools to train revolutionaries
 to subvert governments on three
 continents.
 Member governments of the
 AALAPSO organization should be called
 to account for this brazen step.
 Should they issue disclaimers, as
 did the USSR to Uruguay, they should
 be asked to renounce this official
 communique of the organization.
 A copy of the text of the com-
 munique as carried over Radio Havana
 is attached, along with a Reuters
 article which provides useful commen-
 tary.

 A field station has suggestedthat PRESS COMMENT could usefully
 include more articles from Communist publications.   We agree, and are
 now instituting a new section of PRESS COMMENT entitled "From COMMUNIST
 Sources."  This will appear once a week, and will carry items from
 Communist or Leftist, Communist-lining publications.   Our aim is not
 to give the Communists "equal time" but to circulate materials which
 are-of interest to our propagandists, including articles criticizing
 conditions in Communist countries, articles revealing respect for the
 Free World, articles showing changes of line, articles which can be
 redirected against audiences for which they were not   intended, articles
 attacking religion, articles showing revisionist tendencies, or articles
 which lend themselves to satire.   In some cases we will follow up with
 Briefly Noted comments.   (This new section(does not affect our period-
 ical issuance of annotated COMMUNIST TEXTS.)
 If you find this a useful feature, help us by forwarding items
 which could be included in this section.   In particular, we suggest
 that readers let us have items which (1) appear in periodicals of
 small circulation or in exotic languages, or (2) which -- while
 effective Communist propaganda in the local setting -- will be anti-
 Communist dynamite when planted elsewhere.   (We need original clips
 or clear black and 'white reproductions:   thermofax copies cannot be
 reproduced.   Translations should accompany items in foreign languages.)  ??

 ICM AND "SOCIALIST CAMP" AFFAIRS
 1.  Mutual recriminations and splintering among the world's Communist and
 their cohorts accelerate as the Chinese appear unable to bring their "cul-
 tural revolution" (CR) to any conclusive result and increasingly alienate
 the rest of the world.  While Chinese relations with the Soviets become
 even more bitterly hostile, the Peking government now feels impelled to
 lash out insultingly at the Bulgarian} and Hungarian regimes (as well as
 at the non-Communist Ghanaian and Indonesian Governments and the Gandhi-
 Nasser-Tito "neutral summit").  The Soviets open support for their position
 and condemnation of the Chinese by an "overwhelming majority" of the Commu-
 nist world, yet they fail in still another effort to win general approval
 for convening a world conference .   (See details below.)
 2.  The current alignment of the ICM is graphically highlighted by congresses
 of the ruling Albanian and Bulgarian parties.  Apart from the "big brother"
 Chinese, the "neutral trio"'(N. Vietnam, N. Korea and Rumania), and the tiny
 but disciplined New Zealand CP, the Albanian Congress is attended only by a
 handful of representatives of small pro-Chinese dissident minority "parties"
 or groups.  Not only are the Soviets and Yugoslavs castigated by name as
 leaders of the modern revisionists, but Tirana publicizes a message read at
 the Congress by the Belgian Grippe, purporting to come from a pro-Chinese
 "Provisional CC'of the Polish CP," and attacking the "counter-revolutionary
 turn in Poland."   (Nov 1-8)
 3.   The Bulgarian Congress, on the other hand, is attended by high-level dele-
 gations of a majority of the world's national CPs, including all of the ruling
 parties except the Albanians and Chinese.   Bulgarian chief Zhivkov leads off
 denouncing Chinese conduct and saying that "conditions are ripe" for conven-
 ing a world conference.  His initiative is quickly, though somewhat cautiously,
 seconded by Brezhnev.   Rumanian chief Ceausescu, however, immediately reaffirms
 Rumanian opposition.  Although PRAVDA at the close of the Congress claims sup-
 port of the conference initiative by the Czech, E.German, Hungarian, French,
 and a number of lesser parties, it was opposed by the N. Koreans, Yugoslavs
 and Italians, -- and apparently ignored by the N. Vietnamese, Mongolians,
 Cubans, and others.  PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA articles on the 19th, however,
 indicate Soviet intention to continue to push for the conference.   (Nov 14-19)
 4.  A further demonstration of the alignment of the ruling parties is given
 as the Chinese alone walk out in protest against critical comments in October
 Revolution speeches in Moscow while the Bulgarians, E. Germans, Czechs, Hun-
 garians, Poles, and Mongolians join the Soviets in walking out of a Peking
 mass rally when Chou En-lai attacks the Soviets (12).

 A Chinese delegate describes ~ar~athe' btti   iiternal struggle against the
 5
 .
 Soviet revisionists at an international front meeting, the "5th International
 Conference of the Trade Unions of Metal and Engineering Workers" in Sofia,
 Oct. 18-23t again the Soviets engaged in "tricks of every kind" to impose their
 line and suppress the Chinese.  (Nov 8)
 6.   A Peking "Afro-Asian Writers Bureau statement" denounces "new plots" of
 the "Soviet splittists in Cairo"'and describes its own Peking-based publishing
 activities. (Nov 12)
 7.   A statement by the CPR National Women' ,s Federation blasts Soviet manipu-
 lation of the WIDF-sponsored Oct. 3-6 Stockholm "World Conference for Children."
 (Nov 18)
 8.   A Havana communique of the Afro-Asian-Latin American Peoples Solidarity
 Organization (AALAPSO) announces that schools to train revolutionaries from
 all 3 continents are being established in Cuba and N. Korea. (Nov. 18)
 Our Chronology cites a host of reports (and these, are selected.-from a larger
 volume received) on developments in the Chinese CR, -- yet our picture is far
 from complete, clear, or reliable.  Most of our information comes from foreign
 correspondents in Peking -- primarily-Communist Bloc, Japanese, and Canadian
 -- and they are reporting largely what appears on wall newspapers, posters
 and leaflets, plus limited first-hand observation.   Regular Chinese publica-
 tions, now sharply curtailed in number and.vdlume and hampered by heavy staff
 purges, devote much space to the'CR, but the material they carry is generally
 exhortative and often seems designed to misinform or cover up rather than to
 'inform.   As of this writing, our best assessment of the available information
 seems to indicate that:
 a.   The power struggle in the hierachy is far from decided.  By the time of
 the rally of 2 million on Nov. 12, Lin Piao seemed to be more clearly in
 the ascendancy and Liu Shao-chi, Teng Hsiao-ping, and Chen Yi were practically
 ignored.   Yet at the rally a week later, Liu and Chen seemed to be back in
 close public rapport with Mao, and Lin was unaccountably missing from the huge
 procession on the following day while Chou and Chen Po-ta shared the lead car
 with Mao, -- and Chinese reporting concealed Lin's absence.   (There is some
 speculation that Lin's health, not good for the past two years, may not be
 bearing up.)  The last two, highly contradictory, reports in our Chronology,
 both from TANYUG Peking, illustrate the difficulty in trying to interpret or
 forecast developments in this situation.
 b.  More than 10 million Red.Guards have now been reported as having come to
 Peking and participated in one (or more?) of 7 huge rallies.  Red Guards have

 (WCA Cont.)
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24 tT    P78-03061A000400070004-8
 been reported in clashes with other RG units, army units, workers, and uniden-
 tified civilians.   Their posters have attacked most of the top Party/State
 officials at one time or another, and some have been replaced by new posters
 defending the former targets.   Rampaging Guards occupied the building housing
 the Peking City Committee, run by the CR's own appointee Li Hseuh-feng, and
 they camped outside Chou En-lai's office demanding to talk with him.   Much
 of this activity seems to be undirected, and some even out of control, though
 Soviet and Czech media emphasize the militarization of the Guard and its pre-
 paration for war.   A drastic reduction in RG activity may be expected to follow
 the ban on travel to Peking effective Nov 21.   However, the ban was presumably
 adopted primarily because the transportation network was threatened with a
 complete breakdown by this heavy overloading rather than as a means of reduc-
 ing RG action:   moreover, it has been announced that the schools will remain
 closed throughout the remainder of the school year, -- and the regime is
 now promoting the concept of "long marches" for the Guards.   Thus the future
 scale of activity and role of the Guards remain a big question mark.
 c.   Publications have been so heavily purged that PEOPLE'S DAILY is the only
 'general circulation" newspaper still published in Peking.   One report indi-
 cated that even its future was in doubt, but then its chief editor and half
 of the editorial staff were replaced by personnel from the LIBERATION ARMY
 DAILY and it was permitted to continue.
 10.   Simultaneously, the Chinese regime has sharpened the animosity of its
 attacks on the Soviets, hit insultingly at the Bulgarians and Hungarians
 (both Nov 18) and at Ghana (Oct 29), and has again struck at the Indonesian
 Govt.   (Nov 10), -- all in the form of official "diplomatic" notes!   They
 heavily exploit the Chinese students expelled from the USSR as eyewitnesses
 to Soviet "degeneration" (Nov 3, 6, 9, 14, 16), and publicize another state-
 ment by Indonesian students resident in China denouncing Soviet betrayal of
 Indonesian Communists.
 11,   A Swiss Catholic news agency reports that 5 Chinese Catholic priests were
 sentenced and buried alive in Tientsin.   (Oct 29)
 12.   ComChina has bought 1.5 million tons of wheat from Australia for delivery
 in the first half of 1967, bringing Chinese purchases for the year ending
 June 1967 to 4 million tons.   In view of this year's mediocre crop, eventual
 purchases for the year may top last years 6.3 million.   (Confidential)
 13.   Reaction to China's announcement of a nuclear-armed missile test brings
 Communist reaction ranging from a Soviet one-sentence note to Albanian
 rejoicing in the "magnificent victory."   (Oct 27)
 14.   Soviet celebration of the 49th anniversary of the October Revolution is
 "routine" and almost low-key (leading to speculation that they were "saving
 up" for next year's 50th).   Criticism of Chinese conduct by Pelshe and

 Malinovsky is brief and restrained, but it provokes Chinese walk-out and a
 shrill NC to denunciation.
 15. Soviet media give much space to the Chinese CR and to statements by other
 parties and Communist leaders criticizing the Chinese and supporting the Sov-
 iets.             A Soviet Foreign Ministry note to the Chinese on Oct 27 protests the
 newest provocative actions outside the Embassy in Peking and says that such
 flagrant violations of international law and of diplomatic immunity are
 becoming standard practice in China.  A particularly biting denunciation of
 the Chinese by the famous Spanish Communist woman leader Ibarruri ("La
 Pasionaria") is featured by PRAVDA on Nov. 5.   On the 19th, TASS announces
 that Chinese ".hostile and insulting attacks"forced a Soviet-Chinese Friend-
 ship Society delegation to cut short its visit to China and return home:
 the delegaion head, PRAVDA's Mayevsky, gives details at a press conference
 on the 21st.
 16.   The Soviets tighten ties with Finland with 3 high-level exchanges (Oct
 29-November 20), and Podgorny's visit to Austria, though held in pleasant
 forms, gives him occasion to warn bluntly against ties with the EEC.   (14-20)
 17.   The editor of the Paris-based Polish emigre literary journal KULTURA,
 who had served as a channel to Western publishers for Soviet writers Sinyavsky
 and Daniel, discloses to the press that he has received 10 letters signed by
 more than 95 leading Soviet writers protesting the sentences passed on S & D
 and intends to publish them in a book.   (Nov 13) Two of them are published
 in English translation by the NYTIMES on Nov 19.   (PRESS COMMENT, 21 Nov.)
 18.   Three cases of Soviet espionage are charged during the period:   in the U.S.
 (Oct 31); West Berlin (Nov 2); and Italy (Nov 3).  Soviet security organs
 are also suspected of complicity with the Czechs in diverting a Soviet air-
 liner to an unscheduled landing in Prague where the Czech police removefa
 Czech-born American accused of`(anti-Czech activities in the distant past.
 (Nov 15).  And the Soviets claim that they caught two spies. (ostensibly Chi-
 nese) just inside their Far East border with China.                   (Nov 4)
 19.   ALBANIA:   Along with international aspects described in para. 2, the
 Party Congress re-elected Hoxha and reaffirmed the old course.
 20.   BULGARIA:  Same comment re the Bulgarian Party Congress, which reelected
 Zhivkov.   A Bulgarian military attache is expelled from Greece.
 21.   HUNGARY:   The 10th anniversary of the 1956 uprising passes quietly.
 22. POLAND:   Continuing intellectual ferment is demonstrated by the circum-
 stances surrounding the expulsion of prominent Party philosopher Kolakowski.

 23.   CZECHOSLOVAKIA:  An amazingly frank article on "The Social Roots of
 Dogmatism" is published in the Slovakian Party daily PRAVDA.   (Oct 19)
 24.   JAPAN:  A series of new convulsions in the Japanese left results in new
 splintering from the JCP and complete splits of several key national front
 organizations.     (Oct 25 and continuing)
 25.   VIETNAM:  Albania has agreed to receive a permanent representative of
 the "National Liberation Front" (NLFSV), thus giving it representation in
 all Communist countries except Mongolia as well as in several free world
 nations(SECRET).   Stop press item:  Defectors from the Vietcong in North
 Vietnam rose to a record 2,505 in November (Unclassified).
 26.   THAILAND: Further battles of armed Communist guerrillas with police
 patrols in Northeast Thailand are reported.   (Nov 13)
 27.   FRANCE:  A prominent French CP theorist defects to the pro-Chinese "M-L
 Movement," charging "ideological collapse" of the PCF.   (Nov 11) L'HUMANITE
 NOUVELLE, organ of the pro-Chicom French M-L Movement, "leaps forward" from
 a monthly to a weekly (Sept/Oct).
 28.   SWITZERLAND:  The tiny Swiss CP completes another about-face (see #3
 and BN, BPG #203), returning to a total pro-Chinese alignment:  there is
 evidence that one Pierre Charles has taken de facto control from founder
 Bulliard.   (Sept/Oct.   For details:  JPRS Translations on International Com.
 Developments #907.)
 29.. CUBA:   The Party/State delegation to the Moscow October conference goes
 to Pyongyang and Hanoi and back to Moscow before returning:  there is no
 indication of the results, if any.   (Oct 27-Nov 3)  An Oct 27 GRANMA article
 again blasts Chilean President Frei, Yugoslav journalist Barbieri, and, by
 strong implication, the USSR and any other socialist country which likes Frei.
 Ten dancers of the Cuban national ballet request asylum in France (Nov 5).

 WORLD COMMUNIST AFFAIRS
 Se tember/October (delayed):  The September issue (Vol. 2, No. 21) of
 L'HUMANI   NOUVELLE, Marseilles-published monthly organ of the.pro-
 Chinese dissident `French Communist Movement (M-L)," announces that it
 will become a weekly as of 6 October.  The same issue describes noisy
 street rivalry between activists selling this organ and those selling
 the Sunday edition of the French CP's organ, L'HUMANIT9 DI.MANCHE.
 The September issue (Vol. 3, No. 22) of L'ETINCELLE, monthly
 organ of the dissident Swiss CP, reveals that this tiny group has
 returned once more to the Chinese camp.  No. 18, March-April, had dis-
 closed a surprising about-face from a former pro-Chinese stance to a
 new line bitterly critical of the Chinese and pro-Chinese dissident
 groups in other countries (especially the Grippa group in Belgium)
 and had sounded an open call for collaboration with the old Soviet-
 aligned Swiss Labor Party.  (See Chrono #3.)
 October 19 (delayed):  Bratislava PRAVDA, daily organ of the Slovakian
 Party CC, carries an amazingly frank article on "The Social Roots of
 Dogmatism" by Miroslav Kusy, including the following passage:
 " ... Vulgarized dogmatic Marxism is not in the interests of the
 class of manual workers and of the socialist society but only
 of a given ruling group which takes a position outside of
 this class and society, a group which claims that it is above it
 and can make decisions independently of it.  This group must
 insure its position by a dictatorship of dogmatized ideology
 which is supposed to sancti   each step which it makes, justify
 each move which it makes, and praise uncritically the given state
 of affairs as if it were the best possible state of affairs....
 This is precisely where the determining social roots of dogmatism
 lie:  in the change of the dictatorship of the proletariat into a
 dictatorship of leaders and cliques, ... in the change of the
 political theory into its apology...."
 October 25 and continuing:  New splits in the Japanese left apparently
 result from the JCP's shift from alignment with the Chinese CP to
 "neutral independence" -- which leave significant elements of the
 Japanese Socialist Party more pro-Chinese than the JCP itself!  (See
 also Chrono #7, Oct. I1, for slavish endorsement of China vs. the
 Soviets by head of a JSP delegation in Peking.)
 -- On the 25th, Chairman Miyazaki and 28 other JSP-aligned officers
 of the Japan-China Friendship Association withdraw to form a separate
 organization.  ASAHI EVENING NEWS says next day that the split was

 touched off by JCP objections to a joint statement signed in Peking
 on the 12th by a Miyazaki-headed delegation which indirectly blames
 the JCP for obstructing friendly relations between Japan and ComChina.
 -- According to the same ASAHI article, the JCP's 10th Congress on the
 25th heatedly discussed the opening report by SecyGen Miyamoto on the
 214th (see Chrono #7 for opening), with only 23 of the 150 delegates
 supporting it.  On the 28th, the JCP expels "6 members now staying in
 Peking."  According to Tokyo JIJI agency, the expellees had "roughed
 up' 8 other JCP members in Peking "loyal to the Party's new policy of
 independence from all foreign influence":  this brings to 11+ the number
 of expelled JCP members in Peking.  The Congress ends smoothly, how-
 ever, confirming the new "independence" course and reelecting Nosaka

 October 25 and continuing:  Chinese Communist media continue to devote
 their principal attention to the "'cultural revolution"  (CR) and strive
 to show acclaim and support abroad.  On the 25th, for examples PEOPLE's
 DAILY "prominently features (according to NCNA) an article in the

 from Japan, Tanzania, and Mexico, and'by French and Greek journals."
 October 25 and continuing:  Soviet and other Bloc media continue to

 proletarian CR ""  and on the 26th critical excerpts from CPUSA theore-

 German Party] West Berlin daily DIE WAHRHEIT,  while TASS publicizes
 its own correspondent's report from Peking on the latest posters and

 the Ministry of the Coal Industry for the fifth day, and "difficulties
 of accomodations, food and transport" plus increasing  sickness result-

 Yugoslav TANYUG agency on the 25th reports from Peking on a new poster
 containing the text of a speech by Lin Piao which says that
 "Mao Tse-tung is far above Marx, Engels, Lenin and Stalin.
 In the present-day world there is no personality who can be com-

 "(The Red Guards)... are thus continuing to discredit the

 Havana resumes its polemic with Belgrade with a GRANMA. article

 the Mexican journal SIEMPRE of 28 September by Belgrade POLITIKA's
 Latin American correspondent Barbieri, it rants:
 "Barbieri ... asserts that 'Fidel had initiated against the
 Chilean president a series of attacks which have caused great
 surprise in LA circles.'  B. describes this as a 'negative reac-
 tion.'  Hitting the lowest in insidiuous insinuation, B. suggests
 that this posture is due to the fact that socialist countries
 'support the Frei alternative, and the spread of Frei's ideas is
 also in contrast with the Cuban search for leadership in the

 In an implied warning to the USSR, he adds:  "The socialist

 calumnious assertion regarding support for the 'Frei alternative.'"
 October 29: A TASS Peking report emphasizes the military threat of

 The HW are affecting an army type of organization.  They have

 give them instructions on bayonet fighting, etc.  The HW are formed
 into combat units and regiments.  They have their own headquarters,
 supreme headquarters, and command.  In their leaflets and news-
 papers, the HW declare that they have arms.  The army supplies them
 with its own motor cars and gives them old uniforms as well.
 Millions of HW have been conducting 'military training' over the
 last two months, moving from city to city. They have at their
 disposal railway, automobile, and river transport.
 "Since our HW are soldiers, they must fight, writes the news-
 paper HUNG WEIPING PAO.  The Chinese HW declare that they are
 called upon to 'remake the entire world with the help of Mao
 Tse-tung's ideas,' that theyare preparing for a 'world war'

 CHINESE STUDENT'S COMMENTS ON DEGENERATION IN USSR
 TNCNA lI+ November 1966 English-language release on Chang Peng-ya's exposi-
 tion of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, sufferings of
 the Soviet people, and discontent and opposition.
 Peking, November 14 -- Facts exposing the restoration of capitalism in
 the Soviet Union by the revisionist leading clique there were given by
 Chang Peng--ya, a representative of the Chinese students who were un-
 justifiably ordered home by the Soviet Government.  He said that it had
 brought sufferings to the Soviet people, among whom it was arousing dis-
 content and opposition.
 He originally presented the facts in his speech at the Peking mass rally
 on 5 November, which was held to welcome back the returned students....
 When Chang Peng--ya spoke at the more than 15,000--strong rally, the whole
 audience responded by repeatedly shouting the slogan:  "Carry on the
 struggle against modern revisionism to the very end---the leadership of
 the CPSU is the center of modern revisionism.
 The following excerpts are taken from Chang Peng--ya's speech at the rally:
 We are now back home, where our beloved leader Chairman Mao lives, back
 in the embrace of our great motherland at a time of a new upsurge in the
 great proletarian cultural revolution.  In this stimulating revolutionary
 atmosphere, and the excellent situation in which an all-round leap forward
 is taking place in our socialist construction, we recall the Soviet re-
 visionist restoration of capitalism which we witnessed in the Soviet Union.
 It added to our anger at the monstrous crimes committed by the Soviet re_.
 visionist leading clique and helped us to understand more profoundly its
 hideousness and reactionary nature.
 In the Soviet Union today, the dictatorship of the proletariat has been
 replaced by the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.  The high-salaried
 privileged stratum of society which the Soviet revisionist leading clique
 represents forms a new exploiting class which oppresses and exploites the
 Soviet working masses in all sorts of ways and stops at nothing to main-
 tain its rule amounting to fascist terror.
 There was a Soviet drilling worker we knew.   He was fired from his job
 by the Soviet authorities and subjected to vicious political persecution
 solely because he showed some disapproval of the reactionary actions of
 the Soviet leading clique.  The so-called Soviet Security Department had
 him labelled mad` end sent him to a 'psychiatric hospital.
 This clique, which is afraid of the masses, afraid of the truth, often
 confines honest Soviet people in `psychiatric hospitals" and "insane
 asylums" on a variety of pretexts, and subjects them to outrageous mental
 torture, as one of its methods of repression of the Soviet people.  Such
 cases are now quite common in all parts of the Soviet Union.

 It has destroyed proletarian democracy at the very roots in order to
 maintain its reactionary rule.  The wor_.ng masses of the Soviet Union
 have been deprived of all freedom of speech, assembly, and election.
 At the same time the high-salaried privileged stratum uses its privileged
 position to engage in embezzlement, speculation, rigging of the market,
 and Craft.  Members of this stratum live extravagantly and dissolutely,
 in glaring contrast with the growing  impoverishment of the masses of
 the working people whom they recklessly exploit.  They wallow in the
 blood and sweat of the people.
 Not far from the capital of one of the union republics where we lived
 there are some lovely hills, and nestlinrc among them, a fair sprinkling
 of villas--resorts of some of the big Soviet bureaucrats and rich men.
 They enjoy themselves and live a princely life there.  The ordinary
 Soviet people call the place ''Little America.`
 The party secretary in one locality, with just a few members in his
 family, occupies two great mansions, magnificent buildings with a total
 floor space of more than 1,300 square meters.  Yet a large number of
 workers there are living in very bad housing conditions and some are
 virtually homeless.
 One leading Soviet revisionist had a most luxurious mansion built for him-
 self on the outskirts of Moscow, but, not content with that,has had a
 private villa constructed on the Black Sea, coast.  This villa has two
 swirmning pools, one for fresh water and another for sea water.   1e had a
 specia.1 pump installed to draw in the see, water.
 At a school an old worker said to us with great bitterness:   To think
 that I have lived to see the emergence of new capitalists and landlords
 in our country!"  Corruption, bribery, and speculation are absolutely
 rife.  It's incredibly widespread.  Urban and rural sharks, countenanced
 and even abetted by members of the leading clique of Soviet revisionists,
 speculate in almost everything, from fruit and vegetables to grain and
 automobiles, operate black markets, or set up underground factories.
 Some people, quite openly,build pleasure villas on the outskirts of
 cities or at scenic sites and let them out to r'embers of the high-salaried
 privileged stratum or to speculators.  The rent for a night's stay at one
 of these villas comes to the equivalent of a month's earnings for a lower-
 paid worker.
 We know of the manager of a shoe-repair cooperative who has devised a
 variety of pretexts whereby he squeezes several thousand rubles out of
 the workers every month.  If any worker rails to give him a "'kickback,`
 this manager finds a way to retaliate and expel him from the co-op.
 There are many cities where bribery is blatantly practiced even by the
 police bureaus and the courts.
 Capitalism is rampant in the Soviet countryside today, and the collective
 economy has been undermined,-, the polarization process is intensifying and

 new kulaks are rapidly emerging.  There is a so-called "collective farmer"
 who employs several men to look after his large private herds of sheep,
 the total number of which adds up to 15,000.
 There is another  collective farmer` who, together with the members of
 his family, draws around 800 rubles a year from the collective farm.  But
 his income from. the grapy alone which he grows in his private orchard
 amounts to some 4,000 rubles annually.  In addition, he has many horses,
 cows, and sheep.  There is an endless number of instances of this sort.
 And because the leading Soviet revisionist clique is pursuing a line which
 results in the restoration of capitalism, today in the Soviet Union--where
 there has been great talk about the beginning of the building of "cormu-
 nism"_.-the gap between workers and the peasants, between toms and country
 and between mental and manual labor, far from growing nn`rrower is growing
 wider day by day.  Wage differences are very great.  The highest wages are as
 much aw a hundred times as great as the lowest wages. A Ukrainian coal
 m1Iier once told us:   The differences in pay are growing in our country.
 Many of our leaders are richer than millionaries of the tsarist times."
 A doctor at a certain hospital told. us:  `I have been working in this
 hospital for more than two decades.  Yet my son and I still live in a col-
 lective dormitory, while one of our so-called leaders has a special room
 even for his dog.`
 More and more workers in the Soviet Union have become unemployed or semi--
 employed.  And many have to work at more than one job to make ends meet,
 toiling for 10 or 12 hours a day.  Many students of worker and peasant
 origin are compelled to hire themselves out for odd jobs at night or after
 classes. They carry loads at railway stations or transport coal.
 Chairman Mao has taught us:  To overthrow a political power, it is
 necessary,  first of ally to create public opinion, to do work in the
 ideological sphere.  This is true for the re-olutionary class as well as
 for the counterrevolutionary class.  This is exactly what the Soviet re-
 visionist leading clique, which has betrayed Marxism--Leninism, has been
 doing.
 In October of this year KOM4SOMOLSKAYA PRAVDA declared that revolutionary
 heroes like Paul Korchagin were long out of date.
 The Soviet revisionist leading clique uses the Dress, radio, and television
 to spread the most degenerate bourgeois stuff to befuddle people and poison
 the minds of the young.
 To push their general policy of collaboration with America against China,
 they spread a pro-American outlook among the people, a worship of every-
 thing American, and a fear of the United States.  They have given the
 green light to decadent films and fiction and to photographs of women in
 the nude, and publish "fashion" and `hair--style' magazines, to corrupt
 the Soviet people, and particularly the young peoples.

 In order to maintain and consolidate their revisionist rule, the Soviet
 revisionist leading; clique takes the edn,.i.cational front as its main sphere
 for  ryetting  its grit, on th:  young pt 3ple,. for selecting and training its
 successors.   Its line for education is a revisionist one which serves
 its revisionist political line in all respects, in the system of enrollment,
 the content of education, the examination system, the allocation of posts
 after graduation, and so on.  There is discrimination against children of
 worker or peasant families.      Education is divorced from reality and from
 labor, and there is indulgence   in scholasticism.  The schools place
 money in command" and 'marks above everything.'?  The amount of a student's
 subsidy is determined by his or her marks.
 ,here is a graded system of post-graduates, candidate doctors, and doctors.
 The higher the degree, the higher the salary.  This is done deliberately
 to encourage teachers and students to seek personal fame and monetary reward.
 As a result of the wide dissemination of reactionary bourgeois ideas among
 the people, and particularly the youth, the social atmosphere in the Soviet
 Union is deteriorating.  Prostitutes ply on the streets of some cities
 even in the daytime.  Drunkeness, immoral conduct, violence, and. murder
 are common.  Juvenile delinquency is on the increase.  It is an everyday
 occurence in the courts for youngsters to be sentenced to punishment.
 But where there is repression there is struggle.    great Soviet people,
 nurtured by the great Lenin, will never submit to the reactionary rule of
 the Soviet revisionist leading clique.  Chairman Mao always tells us that
 the overwhelming majority of the masses all over the world, including the
 Soviet Union, favor revolution.  The great majority of Communist Party
 members and cadres in the international communist movement, including those
 of the CPSU, favor revolution.  The fact is that the Soviet people remember
 Lenin and Stalin, and by every possible means are resisting and opposing
 the moving away from socialism which they achieved under Lenin's leadership,
 at the cost of so much self-sacrifice,and the restoration of capitalism by
 the leading clique of Soviet revisionists.
 The counterrevolutionary revisionist line pursued by the Soviet leading
 clique has become increasingly unpopular among the people.  In August, a
 Soviet journalist said:  "The group that is now in the leadership of the
 CPSU has got nothing in common with the party of Lenin.  The members of
 this new gang leading the CPSU are all of the Khrushchev type.'
 A taxi driver said angrily:  "Our leaders are exploiting the people to
 the limit!`  A middle-aged Soviet woman told one of our Chinese students:
 `We all call them 'Red capitalists' -- those people in the CPSU leadership,
 who draw fat salaries.  They don't want communism or revolution.  They
 are afraid of revolution, and they are afraid of China's great cultural
 revolution.' A Soviet worker said:  1'Khrushchev was like a bad tooth that
 was pulled out without pulling out the root.  That makes it all the more
 painful!
 ``
 Broad sections of the Soviet revolutionary people see more and more clearly
 through the sham "building of communism" by which the Soviet revisionist
 leading clique tries to deceive the people.

 There are signs that the strong dissatisfaction felt by the Soviet people
 with the leading revisionist clique is steadily growing to the point of
 struggles against it.  The taxi drivers in one city went on strike on
 two occasions in the siring of this year.  Five Soviet university students
 were recently arrested for distributing leaflets and organizing other
 activities opposing the leading Soviet revisionist clique.  'Tot long ago,
 news began circulating widely in the Soviet Union about the activities
 of an underground group of 25, consisting of workers, intellectuals,
 engineers, and others.  Its slogan of action is  from bureaucratic dictator-
 ship to the dictatorship of the proletariat.' They are determined to over-
 throw the bureaucrat-.capitalist class and restore the dictatorship of the
 proletariat.
 The great Soviet people will surely undertake revolution.  They see a,
 bright future in China, they draw hope from China, they draw hope from
 China, for China is persisting in the socialist road.  They draw hope
 from Chairman Mao, the greatest leader of the revolutionary people of the
 world.  As one Soviet friend put it to us:  "bur hopes are now placed on
 the Chinese Communist Party headed by Corrade Mao Tse-tung.  Our hopes
 are on China."  Many Soviet people told us with great confidence:  sooner
 or later we will make a revolution right here."
 We are absolutely convinced that one day the great Soviet people with their
 revolutionary tradition will rise up in rebelling against the Soviet re-
 visionist leading clique.  The proletarian revolution which the leader-
 ship of the CPSU has strangled will shine again in all its glory in the
 home of the Great October Socialist Revolution, and the banner of Marxism-
 Leninism which they have torn down will once again fly high over the land
 of the Soviets.

 1078.                  THE "OTHER WAR" IN VIETNAM
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:   The military role the U.S. is playing in Vietnam is
 receiving so much attention from world news media that the very consider-
 able hand the U.S. is taking in nation-building in Vietnam is widely ignored.
 As a result of this international chronicling of U.S. military might, the
 U.S. is widely pictured as a savage white warlord constantly counting over
 the regularly reported toll of enemy dead, callously burning villages and
 raining unending destruction from bomb-laden B-52s on roads, livestock and
 oil dumps.   By contrast the pajama-clad Viet Cong is made to look virtually
 helpless and an object with whom Asians and the people of underdeveloped
 lands can readily identify.
 Well buried in the emotionalism generated by reports of mountains of
 U.S. equipment and the U.S. fighting men who use it, is the cold fact that
 at least 50,000 of these "pajama clads" are heavily armed, well-trained
 regular units of the North Vietnamese Army (see unclassified attachment for
 figures on enemy forces -- figures which are seldom aired for general consid-
 eration although every additional complement of U.S. men is thoroughly pub-
 licized by friend and foe alike).
 Completely erasing the picture of the rich white warlord trampling the
 gallant, slender Asian is a difficult task:   obviously the dramatic and the
 grisly side of the war will continue to receive the lion's share of atten-
 tion.   What we hope to do - despite the news appeal of the shooting side of
 the war:-is to divert attention from the U.S. role in Asia as a fighter to
 her role as a nation-builder,  always with stress on how nation-building in
 South Vietnam is a mutual venture shared in by 34 other nations (unclassified
 list attached).  And as a corollary to this, to keep before the public eye
 the facts, wherever available, about North Vietnamese troop strengths and
 military maneuvers, their wanton killing of Vietnamese civilians, women and
 children and the like.
 The latest elements of the nation building program in South Vietnam
 were born at the much-publicized Manila Conference in late October this
 year (see unclassified attachment) when the Conference set its sights be-
 yond the purely military aspects of the Vietnam war and eventually beyond
 Vietnam itself with plans to help alleviate the ills that have burdened

 much of Asia for centuries.   The emphasis in Manila was placed on gains
 that can be made in economic cooperation on an Asia-wide basis, once the
 communists have been persuaded to end their war against South Vietnam.
 Nation-building is vitally necessary in every newly independent coun-
 try; it can be carried on in countries where the situations range from the
 early stirrings of subversion through guerrilla activity and armed insur-
 rection.  Until the present daring experiment in Vietnam, however, nation-
 building has never been attempted by a nation in the throes of a war on its
 own soil.     Whatever the circumstances under which nation building is at-
 tempted, its long-range objectives are to lay the foundation for a viable,
 indigenous administrative and political structure which is actively sup-
 ported by the population.   This is the basis of the sweeping training pro-
 gram started in the Vietnamese Army on 7 November (see unclassified attach-
 ment).   The program may be considered over-ambitious by some, and will un-
 doubtedly suffer setbacks and unforeseen emergencies.   But it unquestionably
 represents the most in daring, imagination and confidence in the future that
 any nations deeply involved in a full scale war have ever attempted in the
 non-military field.                                                                      25X1 C1 Ob

 SITUATLON: During the past two years, the World Peace Council (WPC)
 has planned changes in its structure which it has begun to implement
 since last spring.   They affect above all its leadership, direction and
 control.  With its special appeal to pacifists, intellectuals, idealists,
 the church-oriented, etc., the WPC has been most successful among all
 Communist fronts in camouflaging its true nature and in winning non-
 Communist members.                                    But it also has the greatest difficulty of all the
 fronts in keeping its variegated membership in line; with its more ab-
 stract "peace" objective it is organizationally less cohesive than some
 of the other international Communist fronts such as the labor front, WFTU.
 The Sino-Soviet conflict has accentuated these inherent weaknesses
 within the WPC, has lessened outright Soviet control over the organiza-
 tion, and has reduced the WPC's effectiveness.  The changes which are
 being made are calculated to restore the influence which the WPC exerted
 as a Communist auxiliary in the Fifties in the changed world and under
 the different conditions of the late Sixties.  At the same time, regard-
 less of organizational changes, the war in Vietnam has tended to breathe
 new life into the WPC for many months.  WPC's activities have stimulated
 some interest and support in Asia and Africa where its avowed aims of
 mobilizing the peoples of the world in "defense of peace", of exposing
 "warmongers", and bringing  about peaceful settlement of international
 differences are not always recognized as being a covert way of fur-
 thering the quite different interests of the Soviet Union and of Inter-
 national Communism.
 Priority Propaganda Objectives.  WPC's current major campaigns are:
 A multitude of world-wide and regional actions in support of the people
 of Vietnam and against U.S. aggression; support of the struggle of the
 peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America for national independence;
 actions for "European Security" and for disarmament.
 United Action is Key to Operational Success.  At the WPC's full
 Council meeting in Geneva (13-16 June, 1966), the resolution on the
 principles and organization of the WPC stressed the "universality" of
 the mass movement and put great emphasis on the need for united action.
 The resolution said inter alia:  "Every individual, every national or

 regional group, every national or international organization taking part
 in the struggle for peace and independence has a place inside or along-
 side our movement and can put forward their viewpoints on all problems
 of peace....    he WP7 seeks cooperation with all other peace organiza-
 tions and forces; it welcomes participation of these organizations in
 common and parallel activities; and it encourages and supports all ini-
 tiatives for common actions for peace -- for no peace organization has
 a monopoly on peace activity". The resolution further stated on liaison
 with other peace organizations that measures should be taken to ensure
 that liaison with all organizations and movements engaged in the struggle
 for peace "becomes an integral. and important part of our actual regular
 and day-to-day activities".
 In practical terms this has meant that the WPC has increasingly
 opened its conferences and national gatherings not only to representa-
 tives of other Communist fronts (an older practice), but also to repre-
 sentatives of pacifist, neutralist and non-Communist international
 organizations; further, that the WPC has set out to engage in joint
 activities with non-Communist groups pursuing "peace" goals or in at-
 tempts to become a partner of their :independently launched activities.
 Some recent and future examples are: The Vietnam Solidarity Conference
 (Brussels, 24-25 September) held jointly with the non-Communist Inter-
 national Confederation for Disarmament and Peace (ICDP); the study con-
 ference on "Education for a World without War" in Warsaw in August
 held in conjunction with the War Resisters' International (WRI); propo-
 sals for a World Culture Conference, a Festival for Peace, and an Inter-
 national Exhibition of Art in the Service of Peace -- all envisaged to
 attract non-Communist participation; an appeal to leading (Communist,
 pro-Communist,.and'.non-Communist) figures in all countries for signa-
 tures to statements on the war in Vietnam for subsequent publication in
 leading world papers; attempts, particularly in connection with its
 "European Security" and the Disarmament campaigns, to obtain the coopera-
 tion of Christian elements and of Socialist forces; support of the All-
 India Peace Council's International Conference against War Danger (New
 Delhi, 13-16 November); representation at such conferences as Pugwash
 and East-West Round Table (Paris); world-wide circulation of the resolu-
 tion of the 20th Congress of the Red Cross (on the bombing of North
 Vietnam); support for an appeal proposed by Swedish doctors (also re-
 lated to the Vietnam war) etc.
 In other words, the WPC increasingly associates itself with the
 idea of its former President Professor Bernal of "unity in diversity",
 and seeks to translate his concept into action on the international
 plane as well as in the national peace movements.
 Organizational Emphasis and Changes.  The Geneva meeting also re-
 organized the WPC.   Change of the character and scope of the WPC was
 the main subject of meetings of the Presidential Committee and leaders
 of affiliated national peace movements, held in Budapest in March 1966.

 (1)  The resolution on structure stated that the WPC is "the
 supreme body of the Lpeace7 movement"; that it takes a stand on all
 issues concerning the struggle for peace and on campaigns and programs
 of action for peace; and that it reflects the broad political and geo-
 graphic composition of the movement, being composed of representatives
 of national peace committees and of national, regional and international
 organizations and movements "agreeing with its principles and aims." It
 adopts resolutions and decisions by majority vote, if unanimity cannot
 be obtained, the right of the minority to express its opinion being
 recognized (this is the formal way of dealing with the opposition of
 the Chinese and their supporters).  Well-known personalities, represen-
 tatives of national peace committees and of other peace organizations
 may be invited to WPC sessions as guests and observers.
 (2)   On national (peace) committees, the resolution stressed that
 they are autonomous and independent organizations; that the effective-
 ness of the movement hinges on their activities as initiators of mass
 action; that they should constantly strive toward growth and expansion
 and increased liaison with ever-wider sections of the people in their
 respective countries.   The WPC is not an organization with rigid rules;
 its structure conforms to changing realities, "varying in accordance
 with different conditions in different countries and regions" as the
 resolution says.
 (3)  The Presidential Committee, elected at full Council sessions,
 constitutes the leadership of the WPC between sessions of the Council
 and is empowered to adopt resolutions and decisions in its behalf.
 According to the resolution on the structure, the Committee should re-
 flect in its composition the political and geographic breadth of the WPC.
 The chairman of the Presidential Committee carries out their work with
 the help of the Secretariat.
 A new enlarged Presidential Committee was elected, bringing in 17
 new members and increasing the total membership from 28 to 45.  The
 enlargement provides for bigger Asian, African and Latin American repre-
 sentation.*  The aging Belgian Isabelle Blume was elected "Coordinating
 Chairman", still leaving the Chairman of the Presidential. Committee
 position unfilled since the resignation of British professor Bernal in
 the summer of 1965 on grounds of ill-health.
 (4+)  The resolution stressed in rather specific terms the role of
 the WPC executive body, the Secretariat.   The Secretariat is charged
 with sparking the peace movement's actions around the world; with
 popularizing initiatives and experiences of national peace movements,
 working out proposals and recommendations, liaising with national nom
 mittees, promoting cooperation with other peace organizations,supporting
 The new members include delegates from Nigeria, South Africa, the Por-
 tuguese African Colonies, Madagascar, Cuba, Chile, North Korea, North
 Vietnam, "South Vietnam" (NLFSV), Syria, the USA (Carlton Goodlet,~),,
 West Germany, Bulgaria, and representatives of the WFTU and WIDF.

 research and studies, ensuring the editing and production of the various
 WPC publications, making operational trips to different countries, etc.
 The Secretariat was also enlarged from 6 to 13 positions.  Romesh
 Chandra (India) was appointed Secretary-General, a post unfilled since
 1959.  As in the case of the Presidential Committee, the Secretariat's
 enlargement provides for bigger "third world" representation.* Also,
 the WPC would seem to have reason to expect that Chandra's appointment
 to the secretary-generalship will enhance the WPC's image and facilitate
 its operations in the Afro-Asian area.
 Staff Operations.  Peace Research and Study for Peace was stressed
 as an important, hitherto much neglected, WPC activity, to be practically
 applied to the movement's activities.   On questions of Publications and
 Publicity, decisions were reached to replace the BULLETIN OF THE WPC by
 two monthly publications, PERSPECTIVES and INFORMATION BULLETIN.  While
 the WPC stresses its publications program as a means to popularize its
 activities, to prepare documentation, and to develop dialogue with
 other "peace" groups, it also recommends that stress be put on films
 and exhibitions as publicity media.
 In the meantime,one issue of PERSPECTIVES, published in Vienna,
 has become available.   PERSPECTIVES is designed to appeal to an audience
 beyond the ranks of the WPC and thus is in sharp contrast to the BULLETIN
 which it replaces as the WPC's major periodical.   The BULLETIN functioned
 as a house organ.   It appealed to WPC members with reports that publi-
 cized their accomplishments, boosted their morale, and high-lighted
 current propaganda themes.  Even for WPC members, however, the BULLETIN's
 articles were of short-term value and they held little conceivable
 interest to non-members.
 PERSPECTIVES' articles are more substantial; while maintaining
 brevity they focus more on issues or events with, not surprisingly, an
 article on Vietnam taking the lead.  Many of the articles are signed
 contributions and some of the authors seek to give an impression of ob-
 jectivity by adroit use of statistics and research.  The editors launched
 the first issue with a promise of quality content, free discussion,
 and a confrontation of views and concepts in politics, economics,
 science, and the arts; PERSPECTIVES' tone may attract sympathetic con-
 tributors and readers.** In a signed editorial, Isabelle Blume announced
 Current representation by nationalities:   India (2), Iraq, France,
 West Germany, Spain, China, USSR, Latin America (2), USA, Africa (2).
 A Pole was appointed head of the "Research Institute"; and an
 Italian Chief Editor of WPC Publications.
 The editors have adopted a fairly appealing 62 x 92 format for PERSPEC-
 TIVES.   It is printed on the same flimsy paper as the BULLETIN, but
 through improved design it looks less like a throw-away than the BULLE-
 TIN and its page layouts have a cleaner, less cluttered appearance.
 Like the BULLETIN, it is printed in black and white with ample photo
 illustrations, and the recurring use of blue for background accent
 and print.

 the change as being in line with "revised working methods and structure'.'
 of the WPC; and committed the journal to opening wider a dialogue that
 has begun "across once-rigid Cold War barriers", between "all forces
 seeking peace".   PERSPECTIVES is to be issued in English, French, Spanish
 and German.  INFORMATION BULLETIN, probably in future to take up the role
 of house organ, is to be issued between publication of PERSPECTIVES.
 Finances.   In February 1966, the WPC established a World Peace Fund
 in Helsinki, Finland, whose stated task is the promotion and support
 of actions for peace in all world areas.   It will attempt to gather funds
 by organizing lotteries and international bazaars; by asking painters
 and writers for authorization to sell their works in the cause of peace;
 by outright solicitation from individuals in different countries, es-
 pecially in ecclesiastical circles, etc.                                 However, the WPC continues to
 collect funds from national peace committees and for special activities
 through its Secretariat.   It may well be that the World Peace Fund is
 designed to camouflage for friend and foe alike the major Soviet funding
 channel to the WPC -- and perhaps to instill a feeling of active (mone-
 tary) support to the peace movement from individuals and organizations
 from the "third world".
 IIP -- Legal Cover for the Secretariat.   The WPC still has not
 legalized the status of the WPC Secretariat in Vienna, where since the
 Expulsion of the WPC by the Austrian authorities in 1957, it has opera-
 ted under cover of the International Institute of Peace (IIP). Since
 its establishment, leading IIP staff members have been, at the same
 time, members of the Secretariat and functionaries of the WPC.  The
 projected scope of WPC operations and the enlargement of the "Secre-
 tatitt"(for practical purposes of the IIP) will result in accelerated
 IIP activity,but the IIP must proceed with caution in any expansion
 since the prohibition of WPC activities in Austria is still in force.
 TIP missions will include:   direct contact with various national peace
 groups; collection and dissemination of intelligence requiring contacts
 in the academic and journalistic community; intensified guidance and
 support for WPC participation in international seminars, colloquia and
 symposia; closer ties with special organizations of the U.N. and with
 institutions pursuing pacifist aims.
 Chicom Disruption Tactics; "Third World" Dissatisfaction.  The
 Chicoms and their supporters continue to-do their best to disrupt the
 WPC's activities, attacking the Soviet control and policy line with
 virulence.   They accuse the Soviet leaders of using the WPC as an instru-
 ment of Soviet diplomacy and of trying even to reduce it to a tool of
 U.S. imperialist aggression.   But there is no indication of a Chicom
 intent to boycott the WPC, as they have recently done in the case of a
 WIDF conference in Stockholm and a conference of the International Organi-
 zation of Journalists (IOJ) in East Berlin; they continue to pursue
 their policy of disruption from within.   In the meantime, the Chinese
 posted in Vienna appear to be making Maoist propaganda among the new
 staff of functionaries and creating dissension.   There is also more
 rational, less politically-charged dissatisfaction within WPC ranks: Some

 representatives from the underdeveloped areas feel that even with the
 changes they are still inadequately represented on committees and com-
 missions, that there should be less concern for prominent names and more
 for practical regional work and conferences, and that there should be
 more direct discussions with national. organizations and generally more
 awareness of the many millions who only recently began to speak for
 themselves.  Moreover, even within WPC ranks the fact is not overlooked
 that some WPC "representatives" have questionable influence or standing
 in their own countries, i.e. that they "represent themselves", more or
 less.

 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  There are currently ten  clandestine broadcasts carried
 by Communist transmitters for audiences in Europe and the Middle East.*
 With one exception (the "National Voice of Iran," which is broadcast from
 the Baku area), the transmitters are located in the East European Satellite
 countries.   These stations operate without overt registration under inter-
 national broadcasting conventions, emanate from an unannounced location,
 and -- usually speaking in the name of an exile or illegal group, such as
 a banned local CP -- are aimed primarily at subverting the target audience.
 In general, they are more harshly anti-Western and their language is far
 more abusive than broadcasts for the same areas originating from the overt
 facilities of Radio Moscow.
 The oldest Communist clandestine broadcast, "Radio Espana Independiente,"
 began operations in the USSR in 1941, but in 1954 switched its transmission
 facilities to the Bucharest area.  Most of the others which are still heard
 today started in the late 40's or early 50's.  A few which began during this
 period are no longer heard:
 A group of programs for France ("Aujourd'hui en France," "Ce Matin en
 France," and "Ce Soir en France") broadcast from 1950 to 1955 by trans-
 mitters in Prague, Budapest, and Warsaw.
 *Because of the unstable situation in SEAsia, this Guidance does not treat
 the programs now being carried on the Communist clandestine broadcasts of
 Radio Pathet Lao (in Laotian, Meo, and French), Radio of the Laotian Kingdom
 (in Laotian and French), Liberation Broadcasting Station (in Vietnamese,
 Khmer, Cantonese, and Ki.oyu), the Voice of the People of Thailand (in Thai).
 Nor does it discuss the discontinued Communist clandestine broadcasts of
 Radio Free Japan (from 1952 to 1955), Voice of South Vietnam (from 1948 to
 1955), Voice of Nam Bo (from 1948 to 1955), and Voice of Free Saigon-Cholon
 (from 1950 to 1955).

 A program for Italy ("Questa Sera in Italia") broadcast from 1951
 to 1953 by transmitters in Prague, Budapest, Leipzig, and Wroclaw.
 A program for Yugoslavia ("Radio Free Yugoslavia") broadcast from
 1949 to 1954 by transmitters in Rumania.
 A program for Greece ("Radio Free Greece") broadcast from 1947 to
 1948 by transmitters in Yugoslavia and from then until 1955 by trans-
 mitters in Rumania.
 A program for Iran ("Azerbaijan Democratic Party Radio") broadcast
 from 1947 to 1953 by transmitters in the Baku area.
 A program for Algeria ("Voice of National Independence and Peace")
 broadcast from 1954 to 1955 from Budapest.
 Another deactivated program, "Radio Return to the Homeland," began
 broadcasting in 1955 to Soviet expatriates in West Europe, using trans-
 mitters in Leipzig, East Germany.  Although it did not announce its location
 (except by inviting its listeners to write to a P.O. box in East Berlin) it
 did not fit under the general category of clandestine radios; it purported
 to be a quasi-official organization of Soviet citizens inviting the return
 of emigres to the USSR.   In 1959 this program also began a service for North
 America originating from facilities in the Ukraine.
 That the"official" line of the  ten different programs is centrally
 coordinated by Moscow, and periodically altered to correspond with changes
 in Soviet Government policy, is evident when one studies their pattern over
 the years.   For the past two decades programs for Iran, to cite a good ex-
 ample, have modified the harshness of their invective against the person
 of the Shah in proportion to Moscow's official overtures to his regime; the
 familar clandestine broadcast pattern of virulence against him periodically
 re-emerged whenever Moscow-Teheran relations cooled.   (See the attached
 article from the 2 September TEHRAN MOSAVVAR magazine for details.)
 Recently, the clandestine radios have all been plugging the theme of
 the need for a "united front" to combat the Western imperialists (see, for
 example, the "Briefly Noted" items of 15 August, "West German Communist
 Party Ban Noted    Another Call for a Popular Front," of 1 August, "United
 Fronts in Middle East Urged by Communist Parties -- Subversion by Radio,"
 and of 5 July, "Spanish Civil War Anniversary Cited by Communist Party --
 Proposes United Front Against Franco").
 Another indication of the firm control Moscow exerts over the
 clandestine broadcasts is the "monolithic" stance they have adopted in
 regard to the Sino-Soviet split.  In broadcasts heard to date, all the
 clandestine transmitters have sided with Moscow.  For example:
 A statement of the Political Bureau of the Greek Communist Party
 (KKE) Central Committee, broadcast by the clandestine "Voice of Truth"
 on 8 September, declared:   "The KKE considers inconceivable the Chinese

 leaders' persistent refusals of every proposal for agreement and
 common action by all Socialist countries on such a vital problem
 for the socialist camp and world peace as the problem of U.S.
 imperialism directed against Vietnam."
 An article in the Iraqi CP organ TARIQ ASH-SHAAB, quoted on the
 clandestine "Voice of the Iraqi People" on 11 October, stated:
 "The Iraqi Communists and other progressive and national forces
 are seriously concerned at the events which have taken place during
 the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, particularly since
 acts are being committed which have no connection whatsoever with
 proletarian ideology and which harm the unity of the socialist camp
 and the Communist movement in general."
 A commentary entitled "Where Are You Taking China?" carried on the
 clandestine "Radio Peyk-e Iran" on 29 August, observed:   "What is
 going on in China today is contrary to Marxism, a cause for the
 happiness of the enemies of socialism, and a cause for anxiety
 among friends of the Chinese people, all progressives, and all
 Marxists-Leninists."
 Only "German Freedom Station 90W1 is currently identified as an outlet
 of a Communist Party:   it announces itself as the voice of the outlawed
 West German CP (KPD).*  The clandestine broadcasts to Iraq, Greece, Spain,
 and Portugal come close to openly admitting their sponsorship by devoting
 considerable broadcast time to appeals and decisions of the respective
 (illegal) CP's of those countries.   In the countries where the Communists
 have other overt mechanisms for spreading propaganda, Italy and Turkey,
 the broadcasts refer much less frequently to the CP's.
 Attached is an unclassified compilation of material containing back-
 ground information on the  ten  clandestine radios, along with exploitable
 quotations from recent broadcasts.   Transcripts of significant items on
 these programs are published periodically in the Foreign Broadcast Informa-
 tion Service DAILY REPORT, normally in the sections devoted to the country
 to which the broadcast is beamed.                                          25X1 C10b
 'Voluminous KPD propaganda is also carried by the overt East Berlin broad-
 casts which can be heard in both zones of Germany.   The East Berlin overt
 broadcasts in Persian have also acted as an outlet for the Iranian Tudeh
 Party, while the clandestine "National Voice of Iran" rarely mentioned
 this local CP.

 1081 f.            YOUTH PROBLEMS IN EUROPEAN SATELLITES
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  (Unclassified)  The Communist regimes of Poland, Czecho-
 slovakia, Hungary, and East Germany are faced with increasingly serious
 youth problems.    Many youths in these countries are apathetic to Marxism-
 Leninism and sharply critical of the systems formed under Soviet sponsor-
 ship. The most dramatic illustrations of disaffection are seen in recent
 events at the universities (see attachments and discussion below).  More
 generally, youth's mood in Prague (and possibly in other Satellite capitals
 as well) has been stated recently by a Czechoslovak as follows:
 "Our young people not only heartily dislike the regime, they
 have developed a hostile attitude toward the older generation as a
 whole (including their parents) because they blame it for having
 brought about the dismal state of affairs, i.e., drabness, despon-
 dency and especially the pervading atmosphere of the big lie."
 At the universities in these countries students have been reprimanded
 for shortcomings in their ideological education, and they have made impli-
 cit demands for greater political and cultural freedom.  Furthermore, the
 punishment of some outstanding and popular young faculty members suggests
 that the regimes are increasing their efforts to insulate the students
 from the appeal of liberal views.
 At Poland's Metallurgy and Mining Academy in Cracow, 734 first-year
 students were polled in 1965 and found deficient in ideological education,
 appallingly ignorant of the Polish political system, and unwilling to
 include a single Pole among the first 5on their list of heroes.*  At
 Warsaw University Leszek Kolakowski, the prominent 39-year-old philosophy
 professor, was expelled from the Party following his harshly critical
 speech which stimulated students to attack regime policies and even to
 call on older men to step down from their positions of leadership.   At
 Prague's Charles University the Party leaders, including Novotny himself,
 were unable to restrain the students from raising and printing heretical
 proposals on youth organization.  At Budapest University, 11 popular
 liberal professors who could not be influenced by the CP were dismissed.
 Students at Humboldt University in East Berlin and at the University of
 Leipzig were charged with inadequate political-ideological education and
 patriotism, and indifference to the Party program.
 *President Kennedy was the choice of a great majority of the students.

 Other evidence of disaffection and apathy is seen in a smattering of
 recent incidents and reports.  According to the Czech press, on 20 Septem-
 ber a group of about 20 youths paraded around Prague shouting anti-regime
 slogans and clashed with police; all but the minors were tried and given
 sentences ranging up to 17 months in jail.   In Budapest a group of youths
 daringly passed out anti-regime leaflets on 23 October, the 10th anniver-
 sary of the Hungarian Revolution.   Polish youths in unexpected numbers
 participated on the side of the Church in its recent clash of popular
 appeal with the state.
 Frequent press reports discuss the prevalence of "hooliganism" and
 alcoholism amongst youth in the Satellites.  A report in KULTURA (pub-
 lished by Polish emigres in Paris) cites CP studies on. the apparent cyni-
 cism of Polish youth.  A recent Polish press item notes estimates that
 each year there are about 200,000 youths who are not in school and unem-
 ployed in small towns and settlements in economically underdeveloped areas;
 some of these youths have been in trouble with the law and, because of a
 general lack of education, they are having difficulties in finding employ-
 ment.   In June 1966 the editor of the Hungarian Communist Youth Organiza-
 tion journal, IFJUSAGI MAGAZIN, was fired by the Central Committee of the

 1082.                  THE NORTH VIETNAMESE INVASION
 OF NEUTRAL LAOS
 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:   North Vietnamese Army (PAVN:   Peoples Army of Vietnam)
 incursions into Laos started in the 1950's when Ho Chi-minh's troops went
 into Laos to bolster the Pathet Lao* in their interminable guerrilla war
 against the Royal Laotian Government (RLG).   By 1962, when the warring
 elements in Laos reached an uneasy accord at Geneva, there were several
 thousand North Vietnamese troops in Laos.   Despite Geneva rulings requir-
 ing the withdrawal of foreign troops and materiel from Laos by October
 1962, fewer than 50 North Vietnamese soldiers left the country through
 the Conference-established checkpoint and by late 1964 Hanoi's troop
 strength in Laos had reached an estimated 7,000.   By mid-1965 the number
 had grown to an estimated 10,000 and one short year later Hanoi was
 denying reports that 20,000 North Vietnamese troops were battling in
 Laos.
 Accurate estimates of North Vietnamese strength in Laos are extremely
 difficult for such estimates must include PAVN units regularly operating
 in Laos; PAVN units using the infiltration routes through Laos from North
 Vietnam into South Vietnam; North Vietnamese truck crews bringing mili-
 tary and related supplies over Laotian roads and into South Vietnam for
 PAVN troops and Viet Cong units fighting there; coolie bearers packing
 supplies over the Laotian routes into South Vietnam and finally the great
 numbers of North Vietnamese construction workers impressed into repair
 maintenance work  on    Laotian roads damaged by bombing.
 The U.S. Government has regularly issued official and unofficial
 protests against  1) North Vietnamese incursions into Laos;  2) infringe-
 ments of the 1962 Geneva Accords to which Hanoi is a signatory and  3)
 the use of Laos as an infiltration route for an estimated 4,500 PAVN
 troops moving every month from North Vietnam to join other PAVN units
 already battling in South Vietnam.
 *organized in 1950 from leftist Laotian groups by North Vietnamese com-

 military equipment and troops supplied by Hanoi, Peking and Moscow.

 In the propaganda sense U.S. protests have not been too successful
 for two reasons -- first, we are not an Asian nation and second, we are
 not considered disinterested.   However, the tide may have turned, for in,
 September 1966 the long-suffering Laotian government issued a 230-page
 White Paper; subject:   North Vietnamese violations of the Geneva Accords.
 The Paper is long and rambling but it provides hard evidence of North
 Vietnamese violations of Laotian territory.   Included are interrogations
 of PAVN troops captured in Laos; accounts of PAVN battles with Laotian
 forces on Laotian territory; North Vietnamese documents, pertinent photo-
 graphs such as weapons captured in Laos bearing Chinese, Soviet and North
 Vietnamese markings, etc.  (see unclassified attachmentsfor details).
 The Lao government White Paper contains excerpts from another docu-
 ment which also supports U.S. and free world complaints.   The document in
 question was published on 22 August 1966 by the British Co-Chairman
 and consists of a report prepared by the Indian and Canadian members of
 the ICC* for Laos; the subject!   North Vietnamese presence in Laos in
 1965 (see unclassified attachment for quotations and details).   The most
 dramatic facet of the ICC report is the evidence given by nine North
 Vietnamese prisoners who were captured by RLG forces in mid-March 1966
 at Dong Hene, Laos.   North Vietnamese troops had attacked the Royal Lao-
 tian Reserve Officers Training Academy at Dong Hene and were repulsed by
 Academy cadets who killed upwards of 180 PAVN soldiers and captured the
 nine prisoners who later provided so much useful information regarding
 North Vietnamese military activity on Laotian territory.
 An"earlier ICC report released by the British in December 1965 high-
 lighted the interrogations of North Vietnamese army prisoners and their
 Laotian captors.   The ICC investigating team concluded that:   "North
 Vietnamese regular army soldiers have entered Laos with weapons and ammu-
 nition to wage war against the Laotian people and government" (see un- 25X1C10 b

 25X1C10b
 SITUATION:  Until very recently there was little doubt anywhere that
 the ruling Congress Party of India would again be the easy victor in
 the fourth general elections scheduled for next February.   After twenty
 years in power dating from Indian independence from the British in 1947,
 Congress Party leaders have expected to win a comfortable majority in
 Parliament and in all but two or three of India's 17 states, in spite of
 the growing disunity within the Party and waning confidence in its leader-
 ship.
 The significance of the elections -- the focal point towards which
 political events in India are now directed -- is far greater than simply
 who will come out on top.   Election results will indicate not the "will
 of the people" so much as the ability of the Congress Party to pull it-
 self together during the next two months and the extent of political
 and civil: irresponsibility to which the opposition parties will resort.*
 Furthermore, the ability or inability of the Congress Party to con-
 trol the outbreaks of violence erupting all over India and to function
 as an effective unified government may determine the future of freedom
 and democracy in all of Southeast Asia.   Should democracy fail in India,
 optimistically relied upon by a sometimes-complacent Western world as
 the bastion of democracy in Asia, this will be due more to Congress
 Party factionalism and ineptness and mischievous political maneuverings
 rather than to the allure of communism to the Indian people.
 *The February elections will be the first national elections contested
 by the Congress Party without the leadership of Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru,
 who died in May 1964.   They will also be the first national elections in
 which the opposition will include two Communist Parties of India (CPI/L
 and CPI/R), which formally split along Sino-Soviet lines in October 1964.

 Whatever the outcome next February, there now appears to be some
 danger that the 1967 elections may be the last elections to follow the
 pattern: India has known since achieving independence.  Although important
 sections of the electorate have been disenchanted with the Congress
 government, the opposition is too divided to offer an effective threat
 or alternative.  All it can hope for is to reduce Congress dominance and
 exacerbate existing splits within that party.  Major opposition forces
 at the national level include two rightist parties and four parties on
 the left (See unclassified attachments for details of political parties
 of the opposition).  None of these groups has more than a limited regional
 following (with the exception of Kerala, where Congress lost state elec-
 tions;in 1957 and 1965, and where the February elections are already
 written off as going to the United Leftist Front -- i.e., the CPI/L);
 none has a realistic chance of displacing the Congress government in
 New Delhi.  What the opposition does possess, and what it is wielding
 with almost incredible irresponsibility, is the power to instigate pub-
 lic disorder and fan the growing dissatisfaction among all levels of
 society with the seeming inability of government to solve India's many
 crucial national problems.
 While attempting to cope with a  sagging economy, the second consec-
 utive year of critical food shortage and the threat of famine, the Con-
 gress leadership has been bedeviled with an increasing; tempo of rioting
 and demonstrations.   Groups with grievances have acquired the habit of
 violence:  the slightest cause has become a provocation for violent law-
 lessness, usually led by restless students and the urban poor, which the
 Congress government has for the most part proved unable to contain.   The
 opposition parties, spearheaded by communists and socialists, have pub-
 licly announced their determination to "splinter and smash" the Congress
 Party even before elections, to further disrupt the economy through
 strikes and riots, and so complete the voters' disillusionment with the
 democratic processes.   (See Bi-Weekly Propaganda Guidance 978, "India,
 Famine and Communist Demagoguery".)
 According to official U.S. observers in New Delhi, the tragic clash
 in front of Parliament 7 November between police and demonstrators pro-
 testing the government's refusal to pass national legislation against cow
 slaughter is a further expression of trends which have been developing
 for some time.   These disturbances represent a composite reaction reflect-
 ing a variety of forces such as
 a) the frustration of many university students resulting from an
 outmoded educational system, the lack of minimal amenities and inadequate
 opportunities to utilize their abilities;
 b) traditional modes of Indian life in bitter conflict with demands
 of modern society, as typified by fanatical Sadhus living in the past and
 seeking to force enactment of legislation to ban cow slaughter which the
 government maintains is unconstitutional;

 c) political leaders of both left and right who are frustrated by
 the still powerful position of the Congress Party and are seeking to
 exploit domestic discord to bring themselves to power and advance their
 particular ideology;
 d) the desperate food situation which remains intractable because
 of the continuing perversity of the weather despite major effort at
 comprehensive agricultural reform.;
 e) other economic distress as a result of rising food prices, lag-
 ging wages and increasing unemployment;
 f) international insecurity stemming from a hostile Pakistan, an
 aggressive Communist China rapidly developing nuclear military capacity,
 fear that a common ideology and external threat may bring the Soviet
 Union and Communist China together, increasing lack of confidence that
 the U.S. and the West will support India, and the collapse of the non-
 aligned group which appears to have lost its impact -- all of which seems
 to leave an economically weak India out in the cold, and buffeted by
 forces it cannot control; and
 g) a well-organized and well-financed, although not yet broadly
 based, communist movement directed partly by Moscow and partly by Peking,
 and ready and eager to pour gasoline on every spark or flame.   (See Bi-
 Weekly Propaganda Guidance 981, "Effect of Sino-Soviet Rivalry on Com-
 munist Parties of India")
 Mrs. Indira Gandhi inherited these bewildering and urgent problems
 when she was sworn in as Prime Minister in January 1966, following the
 death of Lal Bahadur Shastri in Tashkent,   As the compromise choice of
 Congress Party bosses and the daughter of Nehru, she was then regarded
 as a "caretaker" Prime Minister expected to provide only nominal leader-
 ship in the interim before the February 1967 elections.   She has shown
 unexpected decisiveness in making and defending major shifts in economic
 policy. Her handling of several political crises,however, most of them
 involving regional and linguistic disputes, has been less forceful.   In
 both these areas, she has brought her government under heavy opposition
 fire; she has evoked criticism from Congress Party leftists, and the
 disapproval of state Congress Party leaders and government officials on
 several scores -- all varying in degree upon the issues as they affect
 the parochial and personal vested interests of individual parties and
 politicians.
 The shifting of alliances and splits that have characterized Congress
 Party politics since Nehru's death have increased; in the absence of any
 serious threat to its supremacy from another indigenous political party,
 there has been no compulsion to end Congress infighting even in the face
 of the approaching general elections.   Despite Mrs. Gandhi's election
 slogan of "One Country, One Team," factional strains and jockeying for
 position with an eye to the plums of office continue to weaken hopes of
 party unity at a time when it is most needed.

 Confidence in Mrs. Gandhi's leadership has, been eroding for several
 months and was not strengthened by the awkward handling of the Zidian
 cabinet re-shuffle of 13 November.  However the shift of one of"the most
 competent men in the government, Y.B. Chavan, from the Defense Ministry
 to the Home Ministry has strengthened the cabinet in some respects; the
 Home Ministry has responsibility for security as well as for law enforce-
 ment.   Chavan's firm steps to prevent a national protest march by students
 on 18 November, which in all probability would have resulted in a repeti-
 tion of the "ban the cow slaughter" violence earlier iri the month, give
 new hope that the Gandhi government has recognized the peril into which
 it has fallen, largely through vacillation and internal party bickering.
 A further complication for the Congress Party government has devel-
 oped from Premier Kosygin's late November postponement of his visit
 until after the February elections.*  Indian officials had predicted
 that he would arrive in November, and had been looking forward to his
 visit as a strong boost to Mrs. Gandhi in the elections.   Soviet offi-
 cials now claim that Premier Kosygin has a full schedule through February.
 The Soviet press and radio have been increasingly critical of India's
 political and economic policies.  They regard Mrs. Gandhi's recent con-
 cession to private enterprise as evidence that the right wing of the
 Congress Party is in control, and charge the government with neglecting
 the public sector of the economy.   Moscow has urged the "unity of left
 forces" for the elections, is covertly financing the CPI/R election slate,
 and apparently hopes that the parties of the left and the left wing of
 the Congress Party will make substantial electoral gains.
 Although the Soviets are still openly holding to their pose as a
 friend of India (e.g., the November 21 announcement that the Soviet Union
 was coming to India's aid in surmounting her food shortage by giving
 machinery and equipment for seed farms),the refusal to "endorse" Mrs.
 Gandhi suggests another interpretation:  Moscow's assessment that the
 Congress Party has been so weakened by recent events that India is ripe
 for major CPI/R gains.
 *His earlier scheduled visit to India last spring was cancelled because
 of Prime Minister Shastri's death.

 "Socialism" and "Capitalism"
 In a "referendum-contest" an African weekly of world renown asks its
 readers if they are for the socialist or capitalist way, in the economic
 sense.
 This is as good a point as any to consider the terminological
 embroglio in which we all find ourselves entangled the minute it is a
 question of capitalism or -- and especially -- of socialism.   In this
 case  moreover, those who edited the text of the contest have been aware
 of the difficulties, since they earlier explained the term "socialist
 way" by the two points of the program of "planning and nationalization,"
 while they added the adjective "liberal" to the term "capitalist way,"
 thus placing it in a sort of ideological neutrality.
 The term "capitalism" is prejudiced
 This does not diminish the fact that the reader, when he finally
 finds himself confronted by the alternative posed in the form of "social-
 ism" or "capitalism," will find his freedom of choice somewhat limited.
 I find it difficult to imagine a reader who, preferring a "liberal" sys-
 tem in one form or another would call it "capitalism."  Because the term,
 although technically applicable to economics, is politically prejudiced.
 Of Marxist origin, it was chosen to define, in the context of the 19th
 century moreover, a system which had to be opposed.   In this sense capi-
 talism signified not only private ownership of the means of production,
 but also the exploitation of man by man which always resulted therefrom.
 Therefore there is fundamentally a negative and polemical meaning to the
 word, a meaning which is still deliberately intended in the Communist's
 vocabulary and in a perhaps less conscious way in everybody else's usage.
 If this interpretation is correct, it is understood that those
 people who adhere to the system which their adversaries call capitalist,
 see it in a different way, indeed would not otherwise support it.   No-
 one would normally say that he prefers to be exploited by another (or to
 exploit others) just because he is against state planning as it is prac-
 ticed in the Communist countries, for example.  Nevertheless, this is
 just what is required of him when he is asked if he is for a socialist
 or capitalist system.   It is as if you asked a religious person if he is
 for a rational view of the world or for religious superstition.   Or as
 if you asked a Communist if he is for freedom of the peasants or for the
 slavery of the kolkhozes.

 But if leading questions are forbidden in judicial proceedings, they
 are practically inevitable when it is a question of current political
 language. In the case which we are using as an example could one have
 replaced the word "capitalist" by "liberal" or something equivalent?
 The result would have been to replace a negative connotation with a posi-
 tive one.   Insofar as the term "liberal capitalist" is concerned, used in
 the introduction to the contest question of which we are speaking, it
 has the merit of being neutral, but mostly as a result of the cumulative
 effect of the two contradictory connotations, which leads to an artifi-
 cial and totally hybrid creation.
 The term "socialist" is equivocal
 But things become more complicated when one gets to the term
 "socialist."  Right off, it has the virtue of not evoking elements of
 moral judgment as in the case of "capitalism."  Not only are the pole-
 mical connotations missing, but by the success of its historical evolu-
 tion it has acquired a positive tone for the great majority of people.
 The result is that everyone claims kinship with it.
 And that's where the virtue turns into a fault:   In the current
 political vocabulary no term lends itself to more confusion than that of
 "socialism."
 Fundamentally this does not seem inevitable, since socialism origi-
 nally defined an economic system.   But can one stop there?  "Certainly,"
 some people reply.   "Since it is the economic system which interests me,
 I can speak of it outside any political context."  -- "No," others
 answer, more precisely the Marxists and their sympathizers, "since the
 socialist economic system necessarily requires an adequate political
 structure.   And it is the latter which will guarantee the building of
 socialism as an economic system."
 And there we are in the middle of an ideological debate.   Those who
 affirm that the question of socialism can be posed on the economic plane
 alone, find themselves already, whether they want to be or not, in a
 political contradiction with the Communists who cannot conceive of this
 separation.  Whether this contradiction is or is not evoked in the frame-
 work of a given political debate depends on the momentary interests of
 the participants, but does not remove its fundamental nature.
 Also, the question of knowing what is or is not "socialist" has
 always been subject to confusion on the political level..   Take for example
 the distinction between "socialist countries" and "capitalist countries."
 In reality this separates the countries where a Communist party is in
 power from the other countries where this is not the case.  A political
 distinction, therefore.   Elsewhere countries governed by a socialist
 party, such as Sweden or Israel, appear in this classification as capi-
 talist countries.   Thus it is always necessary to be clear about what
 one means in speaking of a "socialist country."

 In the same way there is a terminological confusion when socialist
 parties are involved.   There are some which are Communist (as for example
 the East German party) and others which are not.   Other analogous titles
 require equally close scrutiny.   Thus the Labor party in Albania or
 in Switzerland is Communist, that of England certainly is not.   Speak-
 ing of terminology, you can also, if it amuses you, speak of an identity
 between Fascism and Communism:  the single party in Hitler's Germany was
 officially titled "Germany National Socialist Workers' Party."
 In the Third World:   Confusion even more marked
 But if, in Europe, people have for better or worse become more or
 less adept in the daily task of distinguishing between socialism as con-
 ceived by the Communists (although even there also ideological unity has
 cracked) and socialism as conceived by others, things are not the same in
 what is called the Third World.  People there are actively studying the
 political systems of many countries.   In the process socialism is a key
 word and consequently each person (inwardly and outwardly) uses  it to
 suit himself, sometimes poorly defining it, sometimes deliberately fal-
 sifying it.
 And people skip from one criterion to another.   Take for example
 Algeria.   It was recognized by the Soviets as a country building socialism
 up to the summer of 1965, but not since.  What happened?  Did its eco-
 nomic structure deviate towards a capitalistic path?                               Not at all; to the
 contrary as a matter of fact, if one judges by the way it has developed
 since.   Of course, what happened was the downfall of Ben Bella -- a
 political event.   In this case, therefore, the criterion for judging the
 level of socialism which has been attained was exclusively of a politi-
 cal nature.   But on the other hand this does not hinder Algeria from
 following quite faithfully the criteria of the Soviet Union and her
 allies for determining what is socialist and what is not in the world --
 excepting, of course, its own case.
 An analogous phenomenon is very widespread:   On the one hand the
 socialism of countries with Communist regimes is accepted as authentic,
 while on the other hand people limit their meaning of socialism to some-
 thing quite different in their own country.   In effect this sometimes
 amounts to supporting a political system in other countries while attack-
 ing the proponents of this same system at home.  Between the death of
 Stalin in 1953 and the assumption of power by the military in Djakarta
 in 1965, the greatest persecution of Communists was in Egypt, wherever
 recently some Communists were executed following the trials instituted
 against certain Moslem brethren.   Notwithstanding, on the international
 level Egypt recognizes socialism in the sense which the Communists give
 to it.
 So much for political practice, where one could multiply the examples.
 But there is certainly a basis for the problem which cannot be explained

 by simple political manipulation.   Plain socialism tends towards an
 economic program which socialism in the Communist sense also acknowledges,
 but adds to it the remainder of its program which it sees as an entity:
 the exercise of power by the party, its monopoly on ideology, the mono-
 poly of the party in all aspects of life, etc.  Yet the difficulty resides
 in the fact that all this is considred less and less as a whole pack-
 age, to take or to leave.   From that point on one never knows very well
 whether or not one is including specifically political elements when
 one speaks of socialism and, if so, which ones.  Here are several ver-
 sions among the varied choice:   "Socialists the only party, yes; ordained
 ideology, no."  "Marxist ideology, yes; atheism, no."  "Socialist camp,
 yes; China, no." "Dictatorship of the proletariat, yes, but with the
 minor exception that we don't have one, having no industry."  Etcetera.
 It is a game anyone can play.
 In brief, we are in the presence of a multitude of conceptions when
 one refers to socialism.  Moreover, this is agreeable to all those who
 believe in something other than a bare dogma (wherever it may come from).
 But the situation has its humorous side when it comes to communicating.
 Because each person tends to think of his own socialism when he uses or
 hears this term.  And the confusion grows from day to day.
 There is no remedy to the multiple meanings of the term "socialism."
 But there is still a long way to go in defining it more, precisely.   If
 each person takes the trouble to make clear to his interlocutor what
 he really means in using this all-purpose term and if each person tries
 to discern what his partner understands by this same term, each will
 understand more clearly.   This will be too bad for those who prefer the
 confusion, but better for the others.

 AALAPSO PLANS EEVOLUTIONAIiy CADRE SCHOOLS
 For the purpose of giving effective support to the national
 liberation movements of the peoples of Africa, Asia, and Latin America,
 the Executive Secretariat of the Afro-Asian Latin American Peoples
 Solidarity Organization (AALAPSO) adopted an agreement some days ago
 to proceed with the creation of schools for the training of political
 cadres for the revolutionary movements of the three continents.
 The agreement stemmed from a resoliitidn voted by the Tricontinental
 Conference regarding the creation of such schools which are to have
 extraordinary importance in the development of the revolutionary move-
 ment in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.  It is one of the most impor-
 tant tasks of the AALAPSO Executive Secretariat,
 A call was issued recently to the governments of independent nations
 represented by the AALAPSO Executive Secretariat to provide the neces-
 sary funds for the creation in their respective territories of the
 aforementioned schools.  The call has been favorable received by the
 governments of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the
 Republic of Cuba.
 The creation of the political cadre training schools is an
 effective step by the peoples who are struggling against the aggres-
 sions of the imperialists headed by the United States.  Their existence
 will be a symbol of the friendship and the spirit of international
 solidarity of the revolutionary forces.
 by Michael Arkus
 Havana, Cuba, November 18 (Reuters) -- Cuba will set up a school
 to train political officers to lead revolutionary movements in Latin
 America, Africa and Asia, it was announced today.
 It will be organized under the auspices of the Havana-based tri-
 continental anti-imperialist organization.
 In a communique today the organization described it as an
 "effective step of the peoples struggling against imperialist aggres-
 sions headed by yankee imperialism."
 The communique said North Korea has also agreed to establish a
 similar school in its territory and that it was initially planned to
 have at least one such school in each of the three continents.
 The Tri-Continental Secretariat called on the governments of
 independent countries represented within it to provide the financial
 resources necessary for establishing such schools on their territory.
 Apart from Cuba and North Korea, they are Syria, the United Arab
 Republic, Guinea and possibly North Vietnam.

 The remainder of the Secretariat's membership is formed by the
 revolutionary movements in Pakistan, the Congo (Kinshasa), the Portu-
 guese territories, Venezuela, Chile, Puerto Rico, and Santo Domingo --
 all opposed to the governments of their respective countries.
 The tri-continental organization was set up in Havana last January
 following a conference here of communist revolutionary movements of
 Africa, Asia and Latin America.
 This is the first published concrete measure taken to step up
 the revolutionary struggle in three continents.

 5 December 1966
 In April 1965, President Johnson outlined plans for a billion dollar
 program of cooperative development in Vietnam in conjunction with the
 United Nations (which has had such programs in Vietnam since 1961) and
 with other industrialized nations.
 On 13 May 1966, President Johnson said:
 "We began in 1954, when Vietnam became independent, before the war
 between the North and the South.   Since that time we have spent more than
 $2 billion in economic help for the 16 million people of South Vietnam.
 And despite the ravages of war, we have made steady, continuing gains. We
 have concentrated on food, and health, and education, and housing, and
 industry.
 "Like most developing countries, South Vietnam's economy rests on
 agriculture.   Unlike many, it has large uncrowded areas of very rich and
 very fertile land.   Because of this, it is one of the great rice bowls of
 the entire world.  With our help, since 1954, South Vietnam has already
 doubled its rice production, providing food for the people as well as pro-
 viding a vital export for that nation.
 "We have put our American farm know-how to work on other crops.   This
 year, for instance, several hundred million cuttings of a new variety of
 sweet potato, that promises a sixfold increase in yield, will be distributed
 to these Vietnamese farmers.   Corn output should rise from 25,000 tons in
 1962 to 100,000 tons by 1966.   Pig production has more than doubled since
 1955.  Many animal diseases have been eliminated entirely.
 "Disease and epidemic brood over every Vietnamese village.   In a
 country of more than 16 million people with a life expectancy of only 35
 years, there are only 200 civilian doctors.   If the Vietnamese had doctors
 in the same ratio as the United States has doctors, they would have not the
 200 that they do have but they would have more than 5,000 doctors.
 "We have helped vaccinate, already, over 7 million people against
 cholera, and millions more against other diseases.   Hundreds of thousands
 of Vietnamese can now receive treatment in the more than 12,000 hamlet
 health stations that America has built and has stocked.  New clinics and
 surgical suites are scattered throughout that entire country; and the
 medical school that we are now helping to build will graduate as many
 doctors in a single year as now serve the entire civilian population of
 South Vietnam.
 "Education is the keystone of future development in Vietnam.   It
 takes trained people to man the factories, to conduct the administration,

 and to form the human foundation for an advancing nation.  More than a
 quarter million young Vietnamese can now learn in more than 4,000 class-
 rooms that America has helped to build in the last 2 years; and 2,000
 more schools are going to be built by us in the next 12 months.   The
 number of students in vocational schools has gone up four times.   En-
 rollment was 300,000 in 1955, when we first entered there and started
 helping with our program.  Today it is more than 1,500,000.  The 8 mil-
 lion textbooks that we have supplied to Vietnamese children will rise
 to more than 15 million by 1967.
 "Agriculture is the foundation.   Health, education, and housing are
 urgent human needs.   But industrial development is the great pathway to
 their future.
 "When Vietnam was divided, most of the industry was in the North.
 The South was barren of manufacturing and the foundations for industry.
 Today more than 700 new or rehabilitated factories -- textiles mills and
 cement plants, electronics and plastics -- are changing the entire face
 of that nation.   New roads and communications, railroad equipment, and
 electric generators are a spreading base on which this new industry can,
 and is, growing.
 On 1 February 1966, President Johnson proposed that the United States
 spend $550 million to support the Government of Vietnam in carrying for-
 ward programs of economic and social improvement in villages and building
 the foundations for rural progress.
 The joint declaration which concluded the Honolulu meeting of
 American and Vietnamese leaders on 8 February 1966, set forth the objec-
 tives of both the Vietnamese Government and those of the U.S.:
 "The United States will give its full support to measures of social
 revolution including land reform based upon the principle of building up-
 ward from the hopes and purposes of all the people of Vietnam.
 "Just as the United States is pledged to play its full part in the
 world-wide attack upon hunger, ignorance, and disease, so in Vietnam it
 will give special support to the work of the people of that country to
 build even while they fight.   We have helped and will help them -- to
 stabilize the economy -- to increase the production of food -- to spread
 the light of education -- to stamp out disease....
 "Within the framework of their international commitments, the United
 States and Vietnam aim to create with others a stable peace in Southeast
 Asia which will permit the governments and Peoples of the region to devote
 themselves to lifting the condition of man...."
 After President Johnson returned to the U.S. at the conclusion of the
 Honolulu talks, he said of Vietnam:

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400070004-8
 "One front is military.   The other front is the struggle against
 social injustice, against hunger and disease and ignorance, against
 political apathy and indifference."
 And he spoke of his conversations with Vietnam's leaders:
 "We talked of many very special and specific things.  We talked of
 rural construction, of agricultural credits, of rural electrification,
 of new seeds and fertilizers for their crops, of schools and teachers
 and textbooks for their children, of medical schools and clinics and
 equipment to give them better health, of how to give training and educa-
 tion to the refugees, of how to deal with inflation in a war-torn coun-
 try, of how to build the bases for a democratic constitution and for
 free elections, of how to seek the peace, and of how to effectively con-
 duct the war."
 On 23 February, President Johnson said:   "... men ask if we rely on
 guns alone ... the answer is 'No."  "From our Honolulu meeting, from the
 clear pledge which joins us to our allies, there has emerged a common dedi-
 cation to the peaceful progress of the people of Vietnam -- to schools for
 their children, to care for their health, to hope and bounty for their
 land."

 TEHRAN MOSAVVAR
 Teheran, Iran
 2 September 1966
 Report on Anti-Iran Broadcasts
 For 86 weeks, the three broadcasting stations belonging to the
 Soviet Union and East Germany have been pouring out 14 hours of lies
 daily against the nation's regime, the government, the people and the
 nation's foreign policy.
 During these 86 weeks or 2616 days, these radio stations have
 broadcast 36,610 hours of anti-Iran material.  This has only earned
 the Soviet Communist Party and the escapee Iranian traitors the con-
 tempt of the Iranian people and particularly the working classes who
 have been saved by the Shah's Revolution and led into an era of patriot-
 ism, love for the Shah and social consciousness.
 From the year 1338 (1958-59) when Soviet Foreign Under. Secretary
 Kuznetsov and Soviet Foreign Office Assistant for Middle Eastern Affairs
 Pavlov left Tehran in anger until now, three radio stations calling
 themselves Peyk-e-Iran, Sedaye-Iran--e-Azad (The Voice of Free Iran)
 and Radio-ye-Melly [The National Radio--Ed] have been operating from
 Soviet and East German soil.
 Up until two years ago, the Moscow, Baku and Eshqabad radio sta-
 tions devoted about two hours a day to anti-Iran propaganda, but with
 the gradual improvement of relations between Iran and the Soviet Union,
 the tone of these radio broadcasts also changed to a point that now
 these radio stations at Moscow, Baku and Eshgabad devote daily commen-
 taries in praise of Iran and its foreign policy.
 But at the same time, the two radio stations located near the
 borders of Iran - Sedaye-Iran Azad and Radio-,ye-Mellyr - and also Peyk-
 e-Iran, operated by fugitive members of the Tudeh (Communist) Party
 from East Germany, daily broadcast 14 hours of propaganda against our
 sacred national traditions.
 Iranian officials believe that these talks and features are pre-
 pared in Tehran and transmitted by one of the embassies to the other
 side of the frontier.  A few hours later, they are broadcast by the
 above-mentioned radio stations.
 In September of 1959, a 100-kilowatt transmitter and jamming
 equipment were purchased by one of the government agencies to stifle
 these voices of the evil owls of Communism.  But when the matter was
 brought to the attention of His Majesty, he expressed his opposition
 to the idea.  He said, "Let these people say what they want.  The
 judgment of our people and their reaction and indifference to such
 broadcasts is the best answer we can give."  As a consequence, the idea
 was dropped and the equipment was used for other purposes.

 The Shahanshah has given appropriate answers to these broadcasts
 in his various press conferences.  In answer to a question from an
 Iranian news correspondent during a 1959 press conference, the Sha-,
 hanshah expressed surprise that such material could be broadcast by
 a government radio station contrary to all accepted standards of
 behavior.  He felt that after the arrival of the new Iranian ambas-
 sador, the matter would be studied and a decision would be made
 whether the subject should be taken up in the UN.  He had also stressed
 at his news conference in Paris that in listening to the contents of
 the broadcasts from our Northern neighbor, we sometimes feel that
 their action spr_.ngs from a colonial mental attitude.
 Nine months later, in referring to the rubbish of Communist

 casts  during th.o lart year or  so have, been abnormal  but we  do not
 mix feelings with politics." In 1960, a.1 ter the people had become
 inured to Communist broadcasts, the Shahaoshah told the correspondent
 of the French TV Netwo: k that the Communist radio attacks are understand-
 able becaube they are going their way and Iran is going her own way.
 Moreover, the people had by now become used to such broadcasts.
 When the Soviets extended a hand of friendship toward Iran and
 asked for the estabii s'hment of fr~enG_;`. relati ins between the two
 countries, the   :,~rl:+.~,;1 ah said at a riress confer,nce:   "I hope that
 after this, radio broadcasts between the two countries will be normal
 and friendly so that we may be able to live in comfort as neighbors
 and to have extensive trade."
 During the 86 months that the Communist and Soviet broadcasts
 have been abusing and attacking our regime, our government and our
 people, only one of the Premiers - Dr. Eqbal - has answered the un-
 founded accusations of these radio stations.  In 1959, he tcld the
 Senate that these radio stations think that their broadcasts will up-
 set the order in. Iran and will enable them to attain their vile objec-
 tives, but all their calculations have proved wrong.  If they had
 familiarized themselves with the history of Iran and the Iranian
 people, they would have realized that our people have never broken
 under the burden of events and would never be affected by such talk.
 Seven years have passed since the start of the 11t-hour-a-day
 broadcasts of Soviet and Conununist stations.  A1thouuh Iran's rela.-
 tions with the Soviet Union have improved and the Hoveyda Government
 claims progress in this direction, neither the Premier nor the Foreign
 Minister nor the Iranian Ambassador have taken any action to stifle
 the evil voices of the escapee owls of the Tudeh Party and Soviet
 agents.   If the Soviets claim! frien-lshir towards Iran, why don't they
 put a stop to the daily broadcasts of abuse and venom against us from
 radio stations operating near our borders'  If the Soviets claim that
 these radio transmitters are not on their soil, we are prepared to

 send three high-echelon experts of the Ministry of Posts and Tele-
 graphs and the Army with proper equipment to find and show them the
 location of these stations.
 If the government is powerless to put a stop to these evil foreign
 voices, it should so inform the people.  The only action taken was
 during the second visit of the Shahanshah to the Soviet Union two
 years ago.  During official talks, Iranian Ambassador Tah.muress Adami'-
 yat frankly brought up the existence of such radio stations within
 the Communist orbit and asked that they be stopped.  But the Soviet
 leaders were disturbed by the frank statements of the Ambassador and
 denied the presence of these stations on Soviet soil.  With the
 reassignment of Adami'yat, the question was left unsolved.
 If the Foreign Ministry authorities and the person of the Pre-
 mier are powerless in this matter, perhaps they should do what was
 done on the border in 1959.  At that time the Communist anti-Iran
 radio attacks had reached a peak.  Propaganda Chief Plosratollah Mo'-
 inian would daily write and sometimes personally broadcast a talk in
 Persian and Russian against the Soviet Union and the Communists over
 Radio Iran and the provincial radios.  The effect of this action was
 so great that during the first few months, the Russian reacted by set-
 ting up loudspeakers and relaying talks and features from Radio Iran
 and local material in Persian, Russian, Azarbaijan Torky, Uzbeg and
 Tajik.  Twenty five days after the initiation of this border propa-
 ganda warfare, the Soviets suddenly stopped broadcasts and dismantled
 the equipment and asked Iran to stop their broadcasts, too.
 If after 86 months the Government is unable to put a stop to the
 voices of the evil owls of Communism, it should allow the people,
 political parties and national spokesmen to answer in Persian, Torky,
 Uzbeg and other languages via the national radio networks, and to pub-
 licize the defeated objectives of Communism and the social, economic
 and political backwardness of such countries.

 December 1966
 CON iUI I T CLANDESIl-!- E BROADCASTS
 As the year 1966 came to a close, local Communist Parties in West
 Europe and the Middle East were attempting to establish a new guise of
 political respectability, making these parties better able to serve
 the hidden aims of the World Communist Movement.
 At the same time, however, ten clandestine radios (one using trans-
 mitters in the Soviet Union and the other nine in East European Satel-
 lite countries) were spewing forth a total of almost 250 hours of
 broadcasts a week.  These programs, speaking for the most part on
 behalf of banned Communist Parties in several countries of West Europe
 and the Middle East, contained an almost unbelievable amount of
 irresponsible and inciting statements, in addition to instructions to
 Party militants, that gave a complete lie to their sister parties'
 attempts to convince people that they were no longer subversive groups.
 There have been other clandestine broadcasts emanating from trans-
 mitters in the USSR and East Europe during the past 20 years for
 audiences in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa,* but for a
 variety of reasons best explained by the shifting needs of Communist
 political expediency and subversion they are no longer heard.  These
 included a group of programs for France (which ceased abruptly in
 1955 when the French Communist Party became the largest party in the
 French Parliament), a program for Yugoslavia (which was heard during
 the period between that country's expulsion from the Cominform and the
 later improvement of relations between Belgrade and Moscow), a program
 for Algeria (which was broadcast during the early stages of the
 National Liberation Front's open warfare and Communist Party subversion
 against the French administration), and programs for Italy, Greece, and
 Iran (which have since been replaced by other ones for these countries).
 Most of the clandestine broadcasts of the Moscow-controlled "net-
 work" were discontinued in late 1955, in apparent deference to the
 "Geneva spirit" of the time.  Only broadcasts to Spain and Italy were
 operating in 1956 until "German Freedom Station 904" began broadcasting
 from East Germany, but purporting to be a West German station, after
 the West German Communist Party was banned in August 1956 and could no
 longer spread its propaganda overtly.  Today's clandestine broadcasts
 -- a means of directing to localized audiences propaganda for which
 the Soviet Union does not want to be held directly accountable -- are
 all in one way or another contrary to the recognized norms governing
 * Communist clandestine broadcasts beamed today to Vietnam, Laos,
 Cambodia, and Thailand, as well as discontinued ones to Indochina
 and Japan, are not discussed in this paper.

 international broadcast behavior.
 In a resolution adopted on 17 December 1954, the United Nations
 General Assembly declared that the "International Convention Concerning
 the Use of Broadcasting in the Cauee of Peace" (which had come into
 force on 2 April 1938 following ratification by the member states of
 the League of Nations) was still in force.  This convention prohibits
 broadcasts of such a character as to incite the population of any
 territory to acts incompatible with internal order or security and "any
 transmission likely to harm good international understanding by state-
 ments the incorrectness of which is or ought to be known to the persons
 responsible for the broadcasts."
 How the Communists flagrantly violate the terms of this convention,
 as well as other international agreements such as those regulating the
 assignment of broadcast frequencies, is outlined below in the sections
 devoted to the countries to which these ten clandestine broadcasts are
 beamed today.
 Broadcasts to Spain
 Radio "Espana Independiente" is the oldest of the clandestine
 broadcasts still being beamed to West Europe and the Middle East.  On
 the occasion of its 20th anniversary of broadcasting in 1961, the radio
 described itself as "the voice of the Spanish Communist Party," which
 has "always been in the vanguard of the struggle against Franco."
 Up until the end of 1954 the programs were transmitted, although
 not identified as such, over the-facilities of Radio Moscow; since
 then they have originated, in a similarly covert fashion, from Rumania.
 The same transmitters it began using in June 1959 were used at other
 times for the Radio Bucharest International Service, although they
 were: not so indentified by Radio "Espana Independiente" itself.  The
 station also calls itself "Radio Pirenaica".in an attempt to give the
 impression that it is broadcasting from the Pyrenees in Spain; in
 August 1964 "Espa Independiente" advised its listeners to send letters
 to the station in care of post office boxes in Prague, Paris, and Stockholm.
 The radio broadcasts 66 hours and 30 minutes of programs a week
 in Spanish, and occasionally in Catalan and Basque, most of which it
 claims are jammed by Spanish Government facilities; programs period-
 ically call upon Spanish Army technicians allegedly assigned to this
 t ask to alter their jamming signal in such a way that the clandestine
 broadcasts can be heard.  Official Spanish Communist Party statements,
 as well as speeches by Party leaders and articles by exiled writers,
 form a staple part of the broadcast content.  The standard theme is
 that by "united front" action the Communists joined with other anti-
 Franco forces can remove the present government and "socialism" (the
 Party's euphemism for "communism") can be adopted as the way of life
 for Spain.

 On 20 November 1966, for example, "Espa1ia Independiente" broadcast
 a report of a speech given three days earlier at the Moscow Institute
 of the International Workers Institute by Santiago Carrillo, Secretary
 General of the Spanish Communist Party, who declared that the second
 stage of the "struggle" in Spain would be:
 ". . for a thorough agrarian reform which would solve the problems
 of the countryside, give the land to those who till it, and free
 the peasants from their burdens; for the nationalization of
 finance and credit, as well as the big monopolistic enterprises,
 creating a broad sector of state democratic capitalism; and for
 achieving the transfer of power to the hands of the workers,
 peasants, and petit bourgeoisie.'
 Although the Spanish Communist Party usually couhces its appeals
 'for action in terms which imply that this change of power can be accom-
 plished by peaceful means (in contrast to the definitely more inciting
 appeals of several of the other nine clandestine broadcasts) and
 frequently calls for cooperation with the lower echelons of the Catholic
 Church, overtones of 1936-1939 Civil War propaganda Still creep into
 some of the programs.  On 19 September 1966, "'Espana Independiente"
 carried a recording of a speech made in Budapest by Spanish Communist
 Party leader Dolores Ibarruri, the famed "La Pasionaria" (Passion
 Flower) of the-Civil War, who with great relish described Spain today
 in these terms:
 "While in the industrial areas and in the cities the students,
 workers, priests, and intellectuals are waging a struggle, the
 peasants are rising in Galacia, in Aragon, in Asturias, and in
 Catalonia.  They are compelling the govenment  to grant their
 justified demands and claims against a feudalistic church, against
 a fascist aristocracy, and against monopolistic campanies enjoying
 the protection of the dictatorship itself."
 While the majority of programs on "Espana Independiente" are for
 audiences in Spain.itself some are for Spanish workers abroad.  In this
 connection, a broadcast in July 1966 for Spanish workers in West
 Germany was advertised in advance by the clandestine East German "Free-
 dom Station 904" -- an unusual and perhaps inadvertent admission of
 the central control of these broadcasts.
 Broadcasts to Portugal
 The newest of the Communist clandestine broadcasts beamed to
 Europe is Radio "Portugal Livre" (Free Portugal), which was first heard
 in March 1962 and.is now on the air for 13 hours and 20 minutes each
 week attacking the Salazar regime in much the same way that Radio
 "Espana Independiente" attacks the Franco regime.  "Portugal Livre"
 also emanates from transmitters in Rumania.

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400070004-8
 A typical program, heard on 4 November 1966, carried a manifesto
 issued by the Executive Committee of the Portuguese Communist Party
 attacking a decree which empowers the Government to deport prisoners
 to the colonies.  It declared:
 "To prevent the deportation of political prisoners to camps of
 slow death in Africa, action by the popular masses with the
 working class in the vanguard is essential.  In this urgent action
 all Portuguese democrats, irrespective of parties or political
 groups, beliefs or creed, can and must unite to act promptly."
 On 3 October 1966 the radio quoted from an article in the Portu-
 guese Communist Party publication MILITANTE which described the "Two
 Indispensable Qualities in the Life of a Communist Militant":  these
 are "intransigent firmness in the face of the enemy and the defense
 of conspiratorial work," to oppose the Salazar Government's "fierce
 and bloodthirsty fascist rule which does not care what methods it
 uses in the repression of the rising popular movement."
 In addition to calling for "united fronts" on the home front,
 "Portugal Livre" also devotes attention to the situation in the Portu-
 guese colonies.  A broadcast on 3 July 1966 reviewed the contents of
 the first issue of PASSE A PALAVRA, the clandestine publication of the
 "Popular Front for National Liberation" among the Portuguese military
 forces.  In addition to an article by an alleged deserter calling on
 his former comrades to lay down their arms, the publication reportedly
 "points out that the struggle of the Portuguese people against the
 Salazar regime and the national liberation movement in the Portuguses
 colonies are parts of the same struggle -- for the overthrow of the
 fascist regime in Portugal."
 Broadcasts to West Germany
 There are currently two clandestine broadcasts beamed from trans-
 mitters in East Germany to West Germany, in addition to the several
 other East German official broadcasts which can easily be heard in
 the West carrying propaganda of the illegal West German Communist Party
 (KPD).  The first one, "Deutscher Freiheitssender 904" (German Freedom
 Station 904 -- the numeral being derived from the frequency in kilo-
 cycles on which it is transmitted), was first heard in August 1956 on
 the same frequency as that carrying Radio "Return to the Homeland."*
 Radio ""904" carries 28 hours of programs a week with critical comment
 * This broadcast from East Germany began in 1955 and purported to be
 the voice of a quasi-official organization of Soviet citizens inviting
 the return of emigres to the USSR.

 on West German politics interspersed with coded messages for secret
 agents.
 Identifying itself as the voice of the outlawed KPD, Radio "904"
 features statements by Party leaders couched in terms almost identical
 with that of the radio and press of East Germany which warn of the dan-
 gers of West German remilitarization.  Extremely vituperative attacks
 by "904" commentators on the Christian Democrats have been coupled with
 appeals for united action by West German workers against the Bonn
 Government; in the latter regard, treatment of the West German Social
 Democratic Party has been fairly friendly whenever the latter's policies
 complemented those of the Communists.
 Radio "904" also stresses repeated calls for the lifting of the
 ban on the KPD.  On 17 August 1966 it broadcast a KPD Central Committee
 on the occasion of the 10 anniversary of the ban on the Party, including
 this "united front" call:
 "The time has come for Social Democrats, Communists, and trade
 unionists to discuss how the effects of the sole rule of the
 monopolies and the incorrect economic policy of the Erhard
 government can be opposed.  The working class must face the
 monopolies and government with an economic policy of its own."
 The other clandestine broadcast to West Germany, "Deutscher
 Soldatensender" (German Soldiers' Station), carries 29 hours and 10
 minutes of programs a week attacking the policies of the West German
 Army and NATO.  Unlike the other clandestine broadcasts presumed to be
 (basically nonmilitary audiences in West Europe and the Middle East,
 "Soldatensehder" makes wide use of saracastic and "sexy" material
 aimed at lonely and disgruntled troops in the barracks.  West German
 leaders have been pictured as lecherous old men and incorrigible Nazis
 on these broadcasts which began in October 1960.
 West German and American policies in regard to Vietnam also receive
 considerable insulting and critical cc~,,ment on these broadcasts.  On
 27 October 1966, for instance, a commentator referred to President
 Johnson's statement on the increase in U.S. troop strength in Vietnam
 and concluded:  "While President Johnson talks of honorable peace, his
 air gansters bomb a school and kill 30 children.  We ask the President:
 How many children do you want to kill today?"
 Broadcasts to Italy
 Two parts of the same broadcast in Italian, 1TOggi in Italia"
 (Today in Italy) and "Oggi nel Mondo" (Today in the World), are pre-
 sented 31 hours and 30 minutes a week.  Since the beginning of 1951
 these programs have emanated without source identification from trans-
 in Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Rumania, and East Germany (which

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400070004-8
 are also used at other times for official Satellite government broad-
 casts).  The "Oggi" programming style and content are designed to
 create the illusion that they are official Italian broadcasts, and the
 material on which they are based is apparently supplied on an up-to-
 the-minute basis by Italian Communist Party sources.
 The "Oggi" programs carry statements by Italian Communist Party
 leaders on Italian affairs, as well as news and comment setting forth
 the Soviet position on international affairs, in particular criticizing
 the Rome Government's NATO-oriented foreign policies in standard terms
 characteristic of Radio Moscow comment.  In a broadcast on 21 Rovember
 1966 "Oggi" quoted Italian Communist Party Secretary General Luigi
 Longo's remarks on the election successes of the "neo-Nazis" in West
 Germany.  In terms similar to all the other Moscow-controlled spokes-
 men, he demanded:
 "It is now necessary that all democratic and antifascist forces
 join their efforts to bring about a new policy which will make
 Bonn understand that Italy intends to put up a firm opposition to
 the Strausses and others who tread the dangerous path of nation-
 alism, Pan-Germanism, and Nazism."
 Since the Communist Party is legal in Italy (unlike those in
 Spain, Portugal, and West Germany), "Oggi" broadcasts are generally
 more restrained and sophisticated in their appeals to audiences in
 Italy.  They have been sufficiently inflammatory on several occasions
 in the past, however, to occasion official protests by the Italian
 Government to East European Satellite regimes.
 The Rome daily newspaper IL GIORNALE D'ITALIA on 7 June 1958
 published a long expose of the "Oggi" operations, which included this
 passage:
 "A division of labor in the treatment of various problems can
 be noticed in the Communist invasion of the radio networks.  This
 presupposes the existence of an 'orchestra conductor.'  Moscow,
 which apparently pays the expenses of all Iron Curtain propaganda,
 keeps for itself the privilege of broadcasting during the day
 a series of Italian-language programs; this is followed 30 minutes
 later by 'Oggi in Italia.'  It seems that in Moscow there is also
 a third editorial board for Radio Prague's Italian-language
 programs.  Its task is to deal, with certain nuances, in problems
 of foreign policy.          These programs are broadcast on the same
 Czechoslovak wavelength as the pseudoclandestine 'Oggi nel Mondo,'
 which disappears and reappears in accordance with the needs of
 Communist propaganda."
 Broadcasts to Greece
 In March 1958 a new clandestine broadcast to Greece (and to Greek-

 speaking audiences in Cyprus), "Radioforikos Stat rhos i Foni tis
 Alithias" (Voice of Truth), replaced the earlier "Radio Free Greece"
 broadcasts which had been carried from 191+7 to 1948 by transmitters
 Yugoslavia* and from then until 1955 by transmitters in Rumania.  Today
 the "Voice of Truth" is on the air for 20 hours and 10 minutes each
 week, emanating from transmitters in East Germany which are also used
 for other clandestine broadcasts as well as the official East German
 Radio.
 The "Voice of Truth" speaks for the Greek Communist Party (KKE),
 publicizing its statements and pleas for legalization in much the
 same way that the "904" transmissions do for the West German Com-
 munist Party.  A statement of the Political Bureau of the Central
 Committee of the KKE, for example, broadcast on 12 October 1966
 declared:
 "The KKE considers it imperative to increase the efforts of the
 entire political world which opposes dictatorship in order to
 find, within the framework of the United Democratic Left, a
 democratic way out of anomaly.  In the face of the increased
 danger of fascist dictatorial solutions, it is imperative that
 there be agreement among all parties and all patriotic forces
 which sincerely believe in the need for normal democratic progress,
 for immediate elections, and for the granting of democratic
 guarantees which will be carried out, primarily for the abolition
 of all emergency measures and the legalization of the KKE.  The
 IKE calls on all democratic parties and all political figures
 to rise to the importance of the occasion and their responsibili-
 ties and to silence the dictatorial problamations by insisting
 and imposing the democratic solution of free elections."
 Broadcasts also link demands for "freedom" for Greek "democrats"
 with statements concerning the need for concerted action to "free"
 the Cypriot Greeks.  A "Voice of Truth" program on 26 November 1966
 reported a greeting message sent from the KKE to the Cyprus Communist
 Party, which concluded:
 "We express our firm belief that united, with the active support
 of the Greek people and the help of the socialist countries
 and all anti-imperialist forces, the people of Cyprus will
 finally impose their will.  We wish you with all our hearts,
 dear comrades, success in your  just and patriotic fight."
 The  FFree Greece" transmitters in Yugoslavia became unavailable for
 the Moscow-directed clandestine broadcast "network" when this country
 was expelled from the Cominform.

 Broadcasts to Turkey
 At the same time in March 1958 that the "Voice of Truth" began
 broadcasting attacks on the Greek and U.S. Governments, "Bizim Radyo"
 (Our Radio) launched similar attacks on the Turkish Government for
 its subservience to the United States.  It is now heard for 21 hours
 each week over the same East German transmitters that carry other
 programs of this clandestine "network."
 "Our Radio" attempts to conceal its Communist sponsorship,
 although it does occasionally carry a Turkish Communist Party pronounce-
 ent which stresses the radio's general line (similar to that of Radio
 Moscow broadcasts) charging the existence in Turkey today of oppression
 and economic hardship, occasionally adding to his calls for the people
 to rise up against the "police state."  A broadcast on 10 September 1966
 carried a commentary on the 146th anniversary of the founding of the
 Turkish Communist Party which included this statement:
 "Today the Turkish Communist Party is in the front line of the
 struggle being waged so that our people may rid themselves of the
 foreign yoke, live independently, destroy American overlordship,
 and establish a progressive and democratic Turkey completely
 liberated from destitution, usurpation, aghas, and foreign
 exploiters.  The Turkish Communist Party is the most important
 political organization of the working class."
 A typical  - incitement broadcast was carried by "Our Radio" on
 11 October 1966 in a comment on the Turkish Government's action against
 striking pipeline workers.  It concluded:
 "The progressive forces -- the workers, the intellectuals, the
 youth, the May 27th Revolution officers, the Ataturkists, and
 all the opposition -- are proclaiming that there is no time to
 waste in establishing a united front designed to remove the
 Justice Party Government from power in order to protect the May
 27th Revolution by preventing the Government from implementing its
 counterrevolutionary plan and by taking the necessary action to
 establish such a front."
 "Our Radio" also devotes broadcast time to the plight of the Kurds
 in Turkey, who it claims "cannot help revolting," and to the situation
 in Cyprus.
 Broadcasts to Iran
 Over 30 hours a week of clandestine broadcasts are beamed to
 Iran, 5 hours and 15 minutes in Persian and Azerbaijani from "Seday-
 e-Melli Iran" (The National Voice of Iran) and 25 hours and 40 minutes
 in Persian and Kurdish from "Peyk-e Iran" (Iran Courier).  The former

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-03061A000400070004-8
 has emanated since April 1959 from transmitters in the Caucasus and is
 today the only Communist clandestine radio still operating from within
 the Soviet Union.  One of the female announcers on the "National Voice,"
 incidentally, also appears on the overt Soviet radio broadcasts in
 Persian for Iran emanating from Baku.
 The latter, "Peyk-e Iran," was originally broadcast as an overt
 program of the East German Radio International Service in 1962, and
 listeners were invited to send letters with their comments about the
 programs to a P.O. box in East Berlin.  In 1963, however, "Peyk-e
 Iran" no longer advertised its whereabouts and actually switched its
 transmission facilities to Bulgaria (emanating since then from the
 same clandestine transmitters which carry the "Voice of the Iraqi
 People").  Listeners to "Peyk-e Iran" are now advised to send their
 letters to a P.O. box in Stockholm, and on 8 September 1966 the radio
 announced that readers of the Communist underground newspaper KURDISTAN
 should send their letters to an address in Helsinki -- in the same way
 that Radio "Espana Independiente" advises its listeners to contact it.
 The "National Voice" has been much more vituperative in its
 attacks on the person of the Shah than have those of the overt Persian-
 language programs of Radio Moscow, but it has also tempered these
 attacks whenever the Soviet Government was in the process of making
 official overtures to his regime and then resumed its familar clandes-
 tine broadcast pattern of virulence against him periodically whenever
 Moscow-Teheran relations cooled.  Similar patterns have been observed
 on "Peyk-e Iran," the self-styled voice of the Iranian Tudeh (i.e.,
 Communist) Party.
 On 2 September 1966 the Iranian magazine TEHRAN MOSAVVAR complained
 that "for the past 86 weeks three broadcasting stations belonging to
 the Soviet Union and East Germany have been pouring out l1 hours of
 lies daily against the nation's regime, the government, the people, and
 the nation's foreign policy."  But, the paper added, this "has only
 earned the Soviet Communist Party and the escapee Iranian traitors the
 contempt of the Iranian people and-particularly the working classes who
 have been saved by the Shah's Revolution and led into an era of patri-
 otism, love for the Shah, and social consciousness."*
 The accusations made in TEHRAN MOSAWAR were coolly denied in
 a 10 September 1966 broadcast by "Peyk-e Iran" which declared:
 "TEHRAN MOSAWAR wonders why, despite the improvement of relations
 * The full text of the article is attached.  The magazine has linked,
 incorrectly, a clandestine broadcast emanating from another country in
 the Middle East with the two Communist ones; it also has not kept
 abreast of the change in transmitter location site of "Peyk--e Iran."

 between Iran and the Soviet Union, no official action has been
 taken to close down 'Peyk-e Iran.'  The publisher of TEHRAN
 MOSAVVAR knows very well that there cannot be any connection
 b tween 'Peyk-e Iran' and the Soviet Government.  We have repeatedly
 said the 'Peyk-e Iran' belongs to the Iranian Tudeh Party and
 reflects to voice of all the Iranian people."
 .'"Peyk-e Iran's" listeners are supposed to believe, then, that the
 opinions of the Iranian people change every time Moscow's policy changes.
 Another recent reference to activities of Communist clandestine
 broadcasts to Iran was contained in the CYPRUS MAIL of 27 September 1966.
 The Nicosia paper noted that the "National Voice," which it described
 as "operating from the Soviet Caucasus," had given further evidence of
 the political character of trade with Communist countries when it
 claimed that by expanding trade with Communist countries (in this case
 the strange proposal of sending Iranian oil to oil-rich Rumania) Iran
 could further its industrial development and win "independence from
 imperialist capital."
 Another broadcast on the "National Voice," subsequent to the
 one noted by the Cypriot paper, was also devoted to furthering the
 World Communist Movement's scheme of fostering international relations
 which primarily benefit the Soviet Union and its Satellites.  On
 21 September 1966 the radio hailed offers of economic "cooperation"
 made by Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Poland, and then warned:
 "The Iranian landlords, who are in the service of Britain and the
 United States and who are the farmers' enemies, do not want Iran's
 relations to expand with the socialist countries since this would
 favor the farmers.  That is why all national and patriotic elements
 in Iran today endeavor to repulse the opposition of the British
 and U.S. imperialists and the landlords."
 A broadcast on 21t November 1966 of "Peyk-e Iran" was considerably
 more explicit in outlining the methods the Tudeh Party has considered
 in bringing about a change in the structure of Iran:
 "As to how this revolution can be staged, this can be done peace-
 fully or violently, depending on the situation and the presence or
 absence of democracy.  If these conditions are present but at the
 same time the way is closed to democratic struggle and development,
 as it is now, the revolutionary forces have to resort to the
 violent method of revolution."
 A message to the Central Committee of the Iranian Tudeh Party
 from the Central Committee of the Iraqi Communist Party (broadcast by
 the "Voice of the Iraqi People" over the same Bulgarian transmitter
 which carries "Peyk-e Iran") on 12 October 1966 hailed the 25th

 anniversary of the founding of the Iranian Communist group.  It quite
 clearly exposed the close relationships which exist in this "network"
 of propaganda outlets when it declared:
 "Our party, dear comrades, closely and with great interest follows
 the valiant struggle of the Iranian masses against the clique of
 the Shah, who is the mercenary of the imperialists, for the accom-
 plishment of their full national liberation, democracy, and social
 progress....  Our party appreciates your efforts to revive the
 unity of the World Communist Movement on the basis of Marxism-
 Leninism and the international proletariat.  Our party also
 appreciates your attitude of bolstering solidarity with the Soviet
 Union and the other socialist countries in the common struggle
 against the forces of imperialism, aggression and war, and partic-
 ularly in support of the heroic people of Vietnam."
 Broadcasts to Iraq
 In February 1963, according to Victor Zorza of the MANCHESTER
 GUARDIAN, the clandestine station which had been carrying programs
 beamed to Iran began a new service in Arabic calling on the people in
 Iraq to overthrow the new regime there.  The broadcast coincided,
 Zorza remarked, with a Moscow Radio denial that any calls for a rising
 against the Baghdad Government had been made on its Arabic services.
 The official Radio Moscow broadcast in Arabic on 18 February 1963 had
 carried this quite unusual denial of incitement by a Soviet source:
 "REUTERS, the British news agency, has again reverted to fabrica-
 tion of news.  Its correspondent in Baghdad alleges that the Moscow
 Radio is interfering in the internal affairs of Iraq, and that it
 is even calling on the Kurds to rise against the new government.
 What is the purpose of these REUTERS reports?  The news agency, it
 appears,wants to fish in troubled waters.  Certain circles in
 Britain and the United States still obstinately talk about schemes
 for exploiting events in Iraq in order to consolidate the positions
 of the imperialists in the Near and Middle East.  The provocative
 allegations about what is called 'incitement' by the Moscow radio
 are nothing but fabriacted, false reports which will not mislead
 anyone."
 The Zorza report, published on the same day as the Moscow Radio
 broadcast, went on to give these details of the "Voice of the Iraqi
 People" -- which is now (1966) transmitted from Bulgaria for a total
 of 8 hours and 10 minutes each week:
 "The denial was factually correct, for the: secret station in East
 Germany is not administratively a part of the Soviet radio network.
 It is operated by Middle Eastern Communists mostly as a propaganda

 vehicle for the Tudeh Party of Persia.  But of late the station
 has devoted itself increasingly to Iraqi affairs in its broadcasts
 directed to the Kurdish tribes.  Last Friday, clearly in response
 to the February 8 revolt in Iraq, it instituted a service in
 Arabic to repeat directly to the Iraqi people the calls it had
 been making in the Kurdish language for a Kurdish rebellion against
 the new regime.
 "The radio quoted from an Iraq Communist Party statement announcing
 that 'in the past few days the Communist Party has itself resorted
 to an armed rebellion' and called on the people to do likewise in
 a united front with the Communists.  It claimed that the new
 regime, which has institued a crackdown on Communists, 'was
 confronted with the armed rebellion of the Iraq people from the
 very beginning."'
 Today's "Voice of Iraq" has not changed much since 1963.  A
 comment broadcast on 24 October 1966, for example, denounced the meeting
 :field by Premier Arif the preceding week in these inciting terms:
 "Arif's national conference will fail because differences in the
 ruling class are increasing and the people's campaign against the
 regime is widening.  The people must eliminate the existing crisis
 in the regime for their awn sake.  For this they have to topple
 this dictatorial regime and replace it with,a nationalist govern-
 ment with the participation of all patriotic and anticolonial
 forces."
 In addition to programs concerning the need for "strengthening the
 unity of Kurdish forces" in Iraq, a theme also used on both the clandes-
 tine radios beamed to Turkey and Iran, the "Voice of the Iraqi People"
 also lends its broadcast facilities to other Communist Parties in the
 Middle East to rail on this topic.  On 4 October 1966 it broadcast the
 text of an article published in NIDAL ASH-SHAB, organ of the Central
 Committee of the Syrian Communist Party, attacking a solution to the
 Kurdish problem proposed by the Baath Party.  On 22 November the
 program was devoted to quoting an interview  in Cairo's AKHBAR AL-YAWM
 with Secretary General of the Syrian Communist Party Khalid Bakdash
 who proposed a "united front" of all Arabs to work toward a goal of
 "scientific socialism" -- alluding in this connection to the proven
 capabilities of his party to lead a struggle against "imperialist"
 forces in the Middle East.
 A regular program on the "Voice of the Iraqi People" is devoted to
 "Students and Youth" in the Arab World.  The 17 October 1966 broadcast
 discussed the situation in Yemen and concluded  with this prescription
 for ending the problems of the area by joining in with the efforts of
 well-known World Communist Movement fronts:

 "The Yemeni Democratic Youth Federation expresses its strong support
 for cooperation and solidarity with the youth of the great socialist
 camp, which extends to Yemen all human brotherly help.  The Federa-
 tion's manifesto expresses close alliance with the World Federation.
 of Democratic Youth and the International Union of Students.  While
 greeting the establishment of the Yemeni Democratic Youth Federation
 we wish it steady progress in serving the causes of the Yemeni
 people and youth and in struggling against imperialism and reaction
 both on the local and international levels."
 One answer to all this propaganda broadcast to Iraq from Bulgaria --
 in terms which are equally applicable to the other countries which are
 the targets of similar Communist clandestine radio propaganda -- was
 given in the 2 February 1966 issue of the Iraqi newspaper AL-JUMHURIYAH
 and quoted that day on Radio Baghdad.  Commenting on the discovery of
 arms on board a Bulgarian ship in a Lebanese port, the paper said:
 "Strong friendship, good relations, and many economic and trade
 ties exist between most Arab countries and Bulgaria.  The Arab
 countries have been eager not to let anything harm or disturb
 these friendly relations.  They expected Bulgaria to realize its
 duty and act similarly, at least, and not to permit its country
 to be used for plotting and for attacking any Arab country if it
 really respected Arab friendship and sincerely wished to perpetuate
 and develop it.
 "The Arab countries have never interfered in Bulgaria's domestic
 affairs despite the many events that took place in it during the
 past few years and despite the differences in their social systems.
 Why then does Bulgaria depart from convention and permit the
 spreading of lies and rumors in its country against Arab countries,
 including Iraq?  The odd voice emanating from Bulgaria has been
 defending insurgents hired by Western imperialism to serve its
 interests and revive its dead influence.  Does this action conform
 with Bulgaria's social and political system or with relations of
 friendship?  If Bulgaria prefers a group of opportunist renegades
 to its relations with many Arab states, it is  then our opinion
 that diplomatic courtesy toward such a state is out of place.
 "The sons of Iraq pay no attention to what is being broadcast
 from Bulgaria against their homeland.  None of them heed the
 blusterings of that faction broadcasting from Bulgaria, but what
 provokes their feelings is the discovery of large quantities of
 Bulgarian automatic weapons in Beirut, because this constitutes
 an intentional encroachment against t1e security and peace of
 this area and an open adoptation of imperialist plans.  It is
 inconceivable that Bulgaria is not aware of the dispatch of these
 arms or their intended receivers, why this particular time has been
 chosen for their dispatch, and who is to be the target.

 "It can only be said that the Bulgarian weapons were intended for
 criminals and that Bulgaria cooperated with imperialism and
 entered a race sponsoring joint crime, fully aware tha'tthis arms
 shipment -- there could be other shipments as well -- will render
 the Arabs very cautious in their relations with Bulgaria.  If
 Bulgaria had been sincere and really harbored goodwill and friend-
 ship, it would not have permitted this poisonous broadcasting
 station to continue functioning in its country and would not have
 permitted the dispatch of these weapons while being aware of
 their intended purpose and destination.  We have the right to
 ask:  What of communist principles, ideologies, and theories in
 the light of such cooperation with imperialism?  We assure Bulgaria
 that pretenses and inconstancy cannot change the logic of facts
 and proofs which reveal hidden intentions and objects."

 IDEOLOGICAL PROBLEMS AT HUNBOLDT UNIVERSITY
 In reporting a 18 October meeting of the party organization, the
 31 October issue of the Humboldt University party newspaper clearly.
 indicates the continued existence of ideological problems at the
 East Berlin university.  It says: "Class education of students must be
 strengthened and high academic results attained.  Although progress has
 been made in the political-ideological education of students, the basic` _
 analysis has clearly shown that a real basic change in political education'
 at our university has not yet been carried out.  As Horst Schumann
 said at the 13th Central Committee plenum: the thinking and action of
 all students must be based upon the following four theses; namely, that
 the GDR is my state, that-the BED is my party, that West German
 imperialism... is my enemy, and that the Soviet Union is ttMv best friend.
 When we reflect upon these four questions as the important ideological-
 political criteria of class education, then we can see that an actual
 'change has certainly not been attained in.,regard to this.  The
 university party secretary during the meeting,. outlined the causes for
 defects existing in political-ideological education and said that party
 members must set the example in progress in this regard, that greater
 personal support of the party must be developed among party members,
 and that faculty organizations must promote political training of its
 members."  He also made clear that "complex socialist rationalization"
 at the university clearly included improvement in political education.
 and persuasion.  The concluding speaker at the meeting said that "the
 13th plenum set the task precisely before the party organization of
 Humboldt University, to attain a visible change especially in the
 class education of students by the Seventh Party Congress.  These
 changes can only be attained if the fighting force of the party
 organization is essentially increased and if every individual party
 member completely fulfills his responsibility.  All signs of petit-
 bourgeois thinking and ways of living must be decisively opposed in
 basic party organizations and groups."
 Similar criticism was leveled against the FDJ (Free German Youth)
 at Leipzig University in the 20. October issue of this university's
 party newspaper which said that the FDJ group in the social science
 faculty had given only cursory attention to the statements at the
 13th plenum, that party members were not taking the lead in FDJ
 .groups and did not have the knowledge necessary for attaining
 political-ideological influence among the students.

 EDITORIAL C1]E8 YOUTH UNEMPLOYMENT PROBLEM -- Warsaw, Zycie Warzawy
 Estimates show that each year there are about 2009000 youths from
 small towns and settlements who are not in school and are not employed.
 This phenomenon occurs for the most part in the economically Underdeveloped
 wo jewodytwos.     It.-is also worth adding that of this group 'a large
 portion are youths. who have not completed their primary school education,
 as well as a portion who have already been in trouble with the law,.
 There are various reasons why these yoUT1u people find thl-m elvca
 in such a, sit'ction.  Outside of subjective reason,;; such as personal
 frivolity and disregard for educational importance, one can mention such
 factors as; for example, shortage of space in secondary schools and basic
 vocational schools, the flight from congested rural 'arms, the reluctance
 of factories to train and employ girls., and finally the lack of skill
 in adapting to a specified norm of social coexistence.  To fill these
 needs of youth groups, the Volunteer Work Groups (Ochotniczo Ilu ce Pracy)
 were formed to offer opportunities of gaining employment and a profession.
 Presently, nearly 200 of those work groups are in operation through-
 out the country, training about 6,000 youn  people for professions.  At
 the beginning of 1966, more than 10,000 youths, had already obtained
 'basic vocational qualifications in this isauner?.  The most significant
 1 development of such work groups is being demonstrated in the f'olluwin,
 wouewodztwos: Krakow ,Warsaw, Zielona Gora, Lodz and Wroclaw.  The
 most numerous group of. Young participants in these groups work in
 .enterprises subject to the ministries of heavy industry and construction.
 Interest in youth who are out of school and are uneurployed is not
 adequately Great everywhere.   Iii contradistinction to the wojewudztwo
 ZiiE directorates operating in the cibuve-thontioncd areas, the Olsztyn
 and the Gdansk directorates do rn.o- show proper concern for these uffaira .
 The work groups for the youths are divided into "boarding" groups,
 that is Croups comprised of youths 'cho tuko up their residence in the
 locality in which the work group is  in operation, and into percmancnb
 groups with quarters.  In both div .uionj, -     all increase in the salary
 rates in the Volunteer Work Groups to 6U0 zloty per month has increased
 the attractiveness. of the  prograim.
 The principal aim of the Work groups is educational activity.
 These work groups look upon their task as nob only the formation of a
 prosper ratio of education and. wort;., Lab also the formation of dCF:ialaibe

 YOUTH SEEKS A HERO ; A POLL OF POLISH YOUTH
 /Following is a translation of an article by Jozef Lipiec in
 the Polish-language publication Zycie Literackie (Literary Life),
 Krakow, No 45, 6 November 1966, pages 1,2_!
 The poll I am reading does not aim at depicting a full system of
 youth attitudes. The survey was made during the past academic year among
 students of almost all departments providing day programs at the Mining
 and Metallurgy Academy. Questions were mainly asked of-first year and
 !fifth year students who were either beginning or completing a new courser
 "Fundamentals of Political Sciences."
 In the wealth of presented data, I shall select answers related to
 the question: "Who is your hero ?" I have confidence in such broadly formu-
 lated . questions. Although drawing correct conclusions from a list of lite-
 .rary or movie  heroes is much more difficult than deriving generalizations
 from pre-set patterns by which the investigator carefully circumscribes the
 range of an answer.
 The questiont9'Who is your real life hero ?"  was answered by the overwhel-
 ming majority of students with: John Fitzgerald Kennedy! Next came, in des-
 tending ordert Gagarin and de Gaulle (1), John XXIII and Karl Marx. Many
 saw their "real life heroes" among their closest relations: parents, brothers;
 .a few girls mentioned their boy-friends. Others answered Stalin, Khrushchev,
 "unknown partisans," Army engineers, and the fighting Vietnamese. But that
 is the end of the list.
 Let us realize what it meanst Young Polish students studying at a
 difficult university in 1966, i.e., those who in a few or a dozen years
 will hold key positions in State economy, i.e., the future technocrats who seem
 so alarming to  our lofty esthetes, acclaim as their ideal an intellectual
 President who was not afraid of undermining the holy dogmas of his own so-
 ciety and paid for his courage with his life; an old General for whom the
 the fear of spaces the first Pope for whom the wordst "Love Thy  neighbor"

 .really meant a policy of love for'the fellow-man; the first thinker who
 derived the essence of man from his action, and who, by his own action,
 started the vast process of world metamorphosis. I must frankly confess:
 it is an imposing group by the sheer weight of the names; but why were these
 .names chosen, and not others. Is it good, or bad ?
 Let us continue our investigation. The "literary" hero is...Kmicic,
 .followed, especially among girls, by Dr. Judy (boys obviously like him less).
 .Not much behind come: Robert Jordan, Martin Eden, Rafal Olbromski and "pan's
 Wolodyjowski. The main movies and television heroes area Templer, Kildare,
 Captain Klos, Jean Marais, and John Wayne. When we add the preferred authorst
 Hemingway, Sienkiewicz, Zeromski, and Steinbeck, in that order -- the picture
 becomes rather clear. According to this poll, youth like and admire straight-
 forward young men, with powerful muscles and a high spirit, but also men
 who want to do something, who do something, and who accomplish something.
 Incidentally, we may, note here that the young readers' demand for high-spiri-
 ted literature and modern heroes obviously is not met by the fare offered
 by the Polish present writers. A few of them, in a rather haphazard way,
 appear at the bottom of statistical tables. Does this mean that these students
 do not read our post-war literature, or that they'do not like it ? Each of
 their answers, apparently directed to-an anonymous question, actually bears
 on our responsibility.
 When we compare these imaginary heroes with the real life heroes we
 reach the conclusion that actually they have something in common, based on
 the needs of youth (and therefore "conTion" to all)t All these heroes are
 doers. It is true that a comparison between Kmicic and nennedy, or Marx and
 Martin Eden, is rather nonsensical, but if we replace them in their appro-
 priate fields, adjust the right proportions, and take into account the imma-
 turity of the subjects, we shall obtain a similar character of sustained
 activity, for which.-..youth  are  looking with such a determination. In
 .addition, we notice that "life" constitutes for them a richer and more
 direct source of ideals (already popularized by the mass media information)
 than literature and, in more general terms, art. Concrete evidence prevails
 .over literary fiction.  Obviously a consciously experienced reality today
 can sometimes replace art in one of its major functionst idealization and
 creation of ideals.
 Extraordinary results were obtained in the part of the survey asking
 the students (those who did not yet take "political courses") to demonstrate
 .a certain familiarity with political matters. Out of the 734 first year
 students, i.e., those who had just completed their secondary education (65 %
 coming from   regular high schools), only 45 % were able to give correct
 answers about Polish regime, Constitution, organization of the State, etc,
 For example, 273 said that the "Chief of the State" is the Sejm, others named
 the CC.of PZPR or Wladyslaw Gomulka. To the questiont "What is the function
 of..," - a) Wladyslaw Gomulka -- there were 18 blanks and 2 wrong answers;
 b) Edward Ochab -- 43 blanks and 24 wrong; c) 1: Loga Sowinski -- 109 blanks
 and 80 wrong.

 Equally significant is a comparison between various answers given to
 questions probing the knowledge of international political problems. It
 appears indeed that Polish students know much better the party situation
 and politics in the USA and Great Britain than in...West Germany. When asked
 about the main political parties and the party in power, about 8o %  ave
 correct answers for the USA, about 78 % for Great Britain, but only  5 96 for
 West Germany, including the low 15 % who gave complete answers (also highest
 percentage of unanswered questions). Among the wrong answers, some claimed
 that a "fascist party" or, surprisingly, the. "NSDAP" was the ruling party
 in West Germany; but they were rather rare. The question: "Why does Poland
 not have diplomatic relations with West Germany ?"' was answered exactly only
 by 82 students,.330 knew the answer "more or less," 120 did not answer, and
 450 gave wrong answers.
 The conclusions are thought provoking. To state them-in the mildest
 forms our students (i.e., our future intellectuals) do not know enough about
 their own country and its neighbors. Actually, they cannot be suspected of
 lacking interest in political matters since they are relatively well informed
 about the situation in overseas countries. And this is an important problem
 because it is basically related to the capital issue of our societyt How to
 form conscious patriots and citizens of a State involved in building socia-
 lism.
 We launched a powerful ideological offensive in that direction, un-
 fortunately only in some universities because of a lack of personnel. The
 first results are very encouraging. After taking the semester course "Funda-,
 mentals of Political Sciences," even.girls (even those who, like a large
 city high school graduate, answered: "Paris Commune" to the questions "Who
 issued the 1944 July Manifesto?") are able logically and intelligently to
 make a fruitful synthesis out of the heterogeneous elements of modern poli-
 tical science, and carry out value. judgments. The Mining and Metallurgy
 Academy, one of the leading universities involved in this experiment, will
 provide its students during the current academic year with the following
 related courses% first year -- "Fundamentals of Marxist Philosophy," second
 and partly third year -- "Political Economy," third year -- "Organization
 and Sociology of Labor," and fourth year -- "Fundamentals of Political
 Sciences." And when: we are asked: "Why do they need all that?" -- we answer=
 It is our wish and a matter of necessity that knowledge of man and the world,
 the so-called mature and universal social consciousness, be spread out among
 the population as a whole, so as to deprive esoteric sects or academic and
 literary clans from the monopoly on "political wisdom." Cultural revolutions
 take place among people and not on banners.
 In politics, the great sin is the belief in mechanism, and plain
 stupidity causes submission to a mechanism. Since educational cqncepts and
 their implementation add up to a policy, it is high time to begin discussing
 their effectiveness. Indeed, if the ethical and civic theoretical content
 of the new subject "Civics" introduced in the terminal classes of elementary
 schools is not concretely'embodied in a real and honest educational process,

 there is little doubt that our schools will train a large percent of cynical
 youth who are provided with knowledge but not with the desire to accomplish
 anything. Decent citizens are formed in households and/sohools which know
 how to create and sustain a positive attitude toward one's own and other
 people's labor. Whicl} obviously by no means implies that social habits should
 not be systematically,raised up to the level of. social consciousness, nor
 that all sorts of ideological subjects taught on all levels of school edu-
 ;cation do not play an important role. Nevertheless, we must not equate the
 .words, however well inte'ritioned, with the concrete education.
 Therefore we cannot and we must not believe in the mechanical educa
 tional effectiveness of ideological courses which exist"or develop in our
 universities and polytechnical institutions. A few days ago I listened to
 the fascinating story of successive chairmen of the Polish Students Associa-
 tion in a certain university. This story of embattled factions using all
 available means. in their fighting, attractive vacation spots preemptied by
 the leaders and their girl-friends, a shameless cutting of classes (for the
 sake of "action"), examinations postponed for several (1) years -- could
 serve as an amusing background for some witty farce, if it only were not
 true. And if its occurrence in certain.microcosms did not teach our youth
 to show the same attitude in the real society. Besides, who can measure the
 total social damage resulting from a permanent demoralization caused by the
 "action" of irresponsible people ? I spoke to an assistant at one of our
 universities, and he saidt "I was told that comrade N. will manage both
 his studies and his social work, and if he is not up to the standards, well,
 he will learn with time." Similar news have reached me from other institu-
 tions and from other sources. Here and there we still believe in the idea,
 inherited from the times when only survival counted, that it is more impor-
 tant to know how to push ahead than to show true character. It is easy to
 forget that we destroy our educational goals when we underestimate (or run
 down) the value of work. A contradiction between the words and the deeds..
 cannot be. camouflaged.
 The political stereotypes prevailing among students cover the whole
 range of ideas accessible to youth. Awakening the mind and the humanistic
 outlook during, say, philosophy lectures, and teaching the knowledge of the
 world during classes in political sciences, contribute in an essential way
 to the formation of the youth's worldview4
