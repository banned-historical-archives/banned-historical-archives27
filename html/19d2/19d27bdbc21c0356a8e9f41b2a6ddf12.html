 'ravda condemns Peking on Indochina,
 By Anthony Astrachan
 Waohtngton Post Poretgn service
 MOSCOW,   may   18  -
 1'ravda thundered  a broad
 condemnation of China today
 in what some analysts saw as
 evidence that Peking had said
 "no" to some specific but still
 unrevealed Soviet proposal for
 cooperation in Indochina.
 The polemic in the Commu-
 nist party paper was a clearly
 authoritative,  6,000-word un-
 signed  editorial.             It covered
 virtually every point in dis-
 pute  between               the  Soviet
 Union and     China.  Among
 other things, it accused Pe-
 king of trying to split Moscow
 from Hanoi and other national
 liberation movements.
 At a press conference May
 4,  Soviet  Premier  Kosygin
 hinted at a Soviet proposal for
 a joint.. response to the "escala-
 'tion of U.S. aggression in In-
 dochina." He said the 'escala-
 tion "makes even more imper-
 ative the need for ... colie-
 sion of all socialist and anti-
 imperialist    and   peaceful
 forces."
 Moscow analysts saw other
 signs that the Soviets were
 proposing  cooperation with
 Peking.
 End of Lull in Polemics
 One was a two-week lull in
 polemics, which ended with
 the Pravda outburst today.
 Others included the return
 of  Soviet border negotiator
 Vasily Kuznetsov to Peking,
 May 8; the moderation of So-
 viet leaders' comments about
 Peking in major speeches, a
 Chinese-language   broadcast
 from Moscow on May 7 ap-
 pealing for  Sino Soviet ? co Peking and appears to, be a I uautraI . in  the Sino-Soviet
 operation  of  the  kind that piece in Mao-Tse-Tung's game,
 "solved the Indochina ques- at least for the moment.
 tion in 1954," and the two I  Another Pravda accusation
 trips that North Vietnamese
 party leader Le Duan made
 from Moscow to Peking this
 month.
 Some observers saw a simi-
 lar sign in Moscow's failure to
 reply to fierce denunciations
 by Peking's three major publi-
 cations on the centenary of
 Lenin's birth, April 22, and on
 May Day. Today's Pravda arti-
 cle replied explicitly to these
 denunciations. Other observ-
 ers said delays of 17 and 25
 days might be normal for an
 authoritative response.
 "In Asia," Pravda said, "the
 Chinese leadership has been
 conducting for some years a
 course .of  undermining  the
 progressive regimes, of pro-
 voking   conflicts                                              between
 states, of isolating the nation-
 al-liberation  struggle of na-
 tions from their allies-the so-
 cialist   community countries
 and the International commu-
 nist and workers movement."
 China Blamed for Discord
 This language referred not
 only to the vital Moscow-Pe-
 ?king-Hano? triangle but also
 implicitly blamed China for
 the   Vietnamese-Cambodian
 discords  ("conflicts  between
 states") which facilitated the
 overthrow of Prince Norodom
 Sihanouk as Cambodian head
 of state (';undermining the
 progressive regimes").
 Some analysts read this as
 another indication that Mos-
 cow was still in no hurry to
 recognize Sihanouk's govern-
 ment in exile, which has been
 recognized by both Peking and
 read to some observers like a
 strong hint that Peking was
 Interfering with Soviet mili-
 tary  and economic aid to.
 North Vietnam.
 It said that certain "friends
 of. the people" in Peking were
 painting  Soviet-bloc  support
 for liberation movements as a
 "socialist imperialist' policy,"
 and that they "'evert had the
 nerve to concoct monstrous
 lies about 'Soviet neo-colonial-
 fiim."'
 No Joint Action
 Such behavior shows the im-
 perialists that Peking ""does
 not intend to have joint ac-
 tions with thq USSR and other
 socialist countries against the,
 Imper1aiistAggression,"
 Pravda continued. .     ?
 ? Refusal of joint action was
 not just a sin of omission,
 Pravda said. "It encourages
 the 5mperialist circles to en-
 gage in t h e i r anti-popular
 plans and designs, and an-
 other proof of this is the re-
 cent events in Indochina."
 Read one way, this blames
 Peking for the U.S. Incursion
 into Cambodia. Read another
 way, it confirms that Moscow
 saw the U.S. move as an at-
 tempt to exploit the Sino,-So-
 viet. quarrel in a particularly
 irritating way.
 The Pravda article went on
 to claim that the Chinese were
 trying to undermine relations
 between Warsaw Pact and Co-
 mecon members. This unu-
 sually   explicit   statement
 quarrel and 'has refused td
 join in some Warsaw Pact and.

 for  talks  "on      agreement

 rest said Ceausescu saw the,
 ambassador   of   Albania;;

 Chia Dunning the Red
 Guards for Cost of.. Rampages
 Was.'ington Post Foreign $ervlca
 HONG  KONG,  May 19-
 Chinese youths are being com-
 pelled to compensate the Pe-
 king government for the dam-
 age  they  caused  as  Red
 Guards  during Communist
 leader Mao Tse-tung's convul-
 sive Cultural Revolution.
 This new regulation, being.
 enforced in Canton, Shanghai'
 and other cities at present,i
 reveals the extent to which:
 the authorities are cracking
 down on young radicals for-
 merly encouraged to destroy
 so-called feudal and bourgeois
 vestiges throughout China.
 The  disciplinary measures
 appear to be part of a wide-
 spread effort by the army, the
 main power in most of China's
 provinces,     to  stabilize  the
 country after years of turmoil.
 Among         its  other  actions
 aimed at restoring order, the
 army is reported to be arrest-
 ing former Red Guards and
 other      Maoist  militants for
 extremist activities during the
 upheaval. Many of those ar-
 rested, including figures once
 prominent      in  the  Cultural
 Revolution, have been brought
 before  "people's     tribunals"
 and publicly executed.
 Thousands of youths . are
 being sent to remote rural and
 border regions on the pretext
 that they will .'become imbued
 with   a  true  "proletarian

 Influence Remains
 Former Red Guards who
 have defected to Hong Kong
 ,in recent months have told of
 ,other cases in which the gov:
 ernment  has  tried  to bill
 youths for the expenses they
 incurred at the height of the
 ?Cultural Revolution.
 From August through Nov-
 ember 1966, more than 10 mil-
 -lion  youths  were urged toy
 travel  to Peking  for  Red
 Guard rallies as well as visit
 other cities to spread the revo-
 lution.
 The Red Guards believed
 that their food, lodgings and
 I
 train fares were being paid by,
 the state, which had exhorted'i
 them to "exchange revolution-i
 ary experiences," as the slo-
 gan went.
 But one youth who arrived
 here not long ago from nearby
 ,Kwangtung Province said that
 the authorities had presented
 him with a bill for nearly $200.
 for the trips he had made ins
 11966.
 The efficiency of the gov-
 ernment  accounting system
 even during that chaotic pe-,
 riod is reflected in the fact
 that, according to this former'
 Red Guard, his bill was item=
 ed to include expensed he
 had incurred while visiting Pe-
 king, Shanghai and Chung-.
 king. The youth, whose father
 is a construction engineer, ex-
 pressed the hope that his fam-
 ily would not be held responsi-
 iblt for his debts.

 to be a counter demonstration

 By ADAM CLYMER
 [Sun Staff Correspondent]
 K a b u 1,  Afghanistan-The
 maxiskirt may not be winning
 favor In Baltimore, but it has
 plenty of support among the
 mullahs, or Muslim priests of
 'Afghanistan.
 The mullahs may need any
 allies they can find, even in Par-
 is fashion houses, for they are
 not only fighting short skirts but
 also taking on Lenin, patron
 saint of Afghanistan's giant
 northern neighbor, the Soviet
 Union.
 Lenin Centennial
 In the last two weeks normal-
 ly placid Kabul has seen march-
 directly in this Muslim kingdom.
 The, stir began with Lenin just
 before centennial observances
 for his birthday April 22, which
 the Afghan government joined
 Soviet representatives in cele-
 brating.
 Purcham; a leftist weekly de-
 voted a special 12-page issue to
 Lenin, including a rhapsodic
 poem `lauding Lenin with the
 work "droud" (peace be upon
 him), a benediction ordinarily
 reserved here for the prophet
 Mohammed.
 For the first couple of days
 the mullahs protests concentrat-
 ed on Purcham, with demands
 that it be shut down and the
 poet tried for blasphemy, for
 which the penalty is death.
 Demands Broadened.
 But~Boon their demands broad-
 ened into attacks on miniskirts
 cause nu. one:att cke..riigt"1(even4,in 'i{abul fie??nhortest
 an airport workers' strike, be-
 skirts to be observed on women;
 are no more than an inch
 above the, knee), a wine factory
 established with Italian help, ll=
 quor licensee, coeducation, send-]
 ing Afghan women abroad for.,
 schooling, and general moral;
 decay.
 The stir, with repeated dem-
 onstrations outside Parliament,
 sent diplomats here scurrying to
 their history books to refres'
 their memories on the unres
 which forced King AmanullaI t
 abdicate in 1929. His efforts at
 modernizing Afghanistan wer
 sharply attacked by the mullah
 then, but tribal unrest may hav
 had more to do with his depar'
 ture.
 The diplomats were also ask'
 ing why the government was toP,
 erating the unrest and what was,
 !behind it. Certainly many of the.
 participants saw it as a way 00,
 warning leftists to pull in their,
 "'horns.
 The general assumption hall'
 'been that the government feels-
 it can turn off the stir whenever'
 ,it wants. "No one Is getting pan., o
 'icky," King Mohammed Zahir
 `Shah observed dryly during a
 ,recent interview.
 ' Indeed the pace of demonstra-
 tions  slackened  considerably
 oast weekend. Sebghatullah Mo-I
 jadedi, one of the protest lead-'
 ers, credited the King's support
 with what,' he claimed, welt
 statement-~-a ban on Purcham
 prosecution of the weekly, and s'
 promise of government action,
 as yet undetermined, about
 short skirts and the wine facto-
 ry.
 Two Issues Missed
 The government hasn't an-
 nounced anything about an
 agreement however, , although
 Purcham has now missed two
 Issues.
 Mr. Mojadedi thought the stir
 would not end, until the govern-
 ment announced the pact public-
 ly. Even then, he said it was
 important for the mullahs t
 work harder at religious educa-
 tion,, "to build a great strong
 wall   against   communism'.1
 among Afghan Youth.
 On skirts, he said he was will-.
 tng to compromise; "If it Ii W
 Or the knee, it is all right."

 WASHINGTON DAILY NEWS,
 20 May 1970
 CPYRGHT 'Bruce Biossat / Slaughter by VC
 winter, 1968.
 A  SOUTH  VIETNAMESE
 farmer tripped over a piere of
 wire sticking out of the sand,
 so the story goes, as he was
 walking in the dunes near the
 South China sea east of the
 city of Hue. Thus he opened
 another chapter of grisly de-
 tails about the Red massacre
 of thousands of civilians dur-
 ing the fabled Tet offensive of
 Angry, the farmer tugged on the wire. Out
 came a bony hand and arm and, ultimately,
 the whole body of a buried civilian whose
 hands had been wired behind his back before
 he was killed. At this and other similar sites,
 known now as the Sand Dune Finds, were un-
 covered the bodies of 808 other Hue civilians
 slauhgtered by the Viet Cong.
 Those discoveries occurred between March
 and July in 1969. Two months later, another
 find - of 428 bodies - was made in the re-
 mote Da Mai creek area 10 miles south of
 Hue. And last November, in another desolate
 sector east of Hue near the fishing village of
 Luong Vien, some 300 additional bodies were
 dug up in the Phu Thu salt flats.
 It is estimated the latter find may finally
 come to 1,000, since some 1,946 Hue civilians
 are still unaccounted for and the checking at
 Phu Thu is evidently extremely difficult.
 THE populace of Hue was not startled to
 learn of these 1969 finds. Post-Tet estimates
 placed the number of missing near 5,800.
 Nearly 1,000 are presumed dead from acci-
 dents related to the bitter battle in which U.S.
 and South Vietnamese forces retook the city.
 Right after the fighting ceased, 1,200 massa-
 cred civilians were found at 19 sites in and
 near the city itself.
 The newest and most graphic account of the
 Red Hue massacres is provided in a work
 called "The Viet Cong Strategy of Terror," by
 Douglas Pike, United States Information Serv-
 ice officer presently stationed in Tokyo but a
 longtime resident of Vietnam, a recognized. au-
 thority on the VC and author of two penetrat-
 ing books on the subject.
 WHAT is the point of our dwelling on this'
 grim business right now? The real points are
 two:
 A good many Americans, some of them
 highly -influential, are saying that if Hanoi's
 regulars and the VC were to triumph in South
 Vietnam, there would be no "bloodbath" visit-
 ed upon the South Vietnamese.
 But these are merely declarative assertions,';
 Inescapably lacking in supportive proofs.
 Those who speak thus, cannot read the future.
 But we can read the past for signs. And Mr.
 Pike's overall judgments, already reported in
 dispatches from Saigon, are that the Red mas-
 sacres in Hue were no random killings by pan-
 icky troops or guerillas but were systematic
 extermination of key civilian population ele-
 ments.
 The slaughter was highly selective, begin-
 ning with an actual black-list of administrative
 leaders, then embracing intellectuals (hated
 for their utter contempt of communism), a
 broad range of people called "social nega-
 tives" - Hanoi's jargon for people tied to the
 old order - and, finally, witnesses who could
 identify the many secret VC who surfaced at
 the time of Tet.
 The second point, made by Mr. Pike but
 striking me with particular force, is how little
 the world - and -self-styled humanitarian lib-
 erals in this country -- have made of the hor-
 cror at Hue. As Mr. Pike writes:
 "There was no agonized outcry. No demon
 strations at North V i e t n a m e s e embassies
 around the world. (The late) Lord Russell did.
 not send his 'war crimes tribunal' to Hue to
 take evidence and indict."
 Unquestionably the gruesome finds at Hue
 rank with the worst Nazi atrocities of World
 War H. The people of Hue were numbed into
 deep sadness and near-silence for months.
 Unlike the famed assassinations by VC to
 intimidate villagers, these murderers meant to
 hide their killings. Helicopters had to destroy
 a canopy of tall trees to get access to the Dal
 Mai creek burial sites.
 But now the "Humanitarians" know. Yet
 where are their voices? Is their quotient of
 outrage exhausted in assault upon America's
 role in Vietnam?

 THE WASHINGTON POST
 15 May 1970
 VC Would Liquidate 3Million
 Cor101d'.It Won, U.S. Expert Contends
 By Robert G. Kaiser
 'Washington Post Foreign Service
 SAIGON, May 14-One of:
 the U.S. government's leading,
 experts on the Vietcong has',
 written a paper predicting that
 "if the Communists win des
 cisively in South Vietnam, all
 political opposition, actual or
 potential, would be systemati-
 cally eliminaed."
 The author of the paper is
 Douglas Pike, who has written
 two books on the Vietnamese;,
 Communists  and  is  now a
 United  States  Information
 Service officer In Tokyo. He
 wrote "The Viet Cong Strategy
 of Terror," a 125-page mono-
 graph earlier this year. The
 U.S. mission here plans to re-
 lease it soon.
 Pike's work seems to be a
 rejoinder to those who have
 mocked suggestions that the
 Communists would wipe out
 thousands of their opponents
 if they took over South Viet
 nam. Pike says that if the
 Communists win the war here
 decisively ("and the key word
 is decisively," he writes), the
 result will be "a night of the
 long knives" to wipe out all
 conceivable  dissidents-per-
 haps 3 million persons.
 Pike contends the massacre
 would go on in secret, after all
 foreigners had been expelled
 from Vietnam. "The world
 would call it peace," Pike
 writes.
 He cites a list of 15 catego-
 ries of citizens who would be
 murdered, saying such a list of
 categories is often found in
 c a p t u r e d documents. Pike
 notes a statement by Col. Tran
 Van Dac, one of the highest-
 ranking Communists ever to
 defect to the Saigon regime,
 that' "there  are  3  million
 South Vietnamese  on the
 blood debt list."
 Pike's predictions are the
 most dramatic aspect of his
 paper. Most of it'is devoted to
 an analysis ? of the Vietcong's
 present and past uses of ter-
 ror. A major section analyzes'
 the 1968 massacres at Hue.
 "It would not be worthwhile
 nor is it the purpose of this
 monograph to produce a word
 picture of Vietnamese Com-
 munists as fiendish fanatics
 with blood dripping from their
 hands," Pike writes. Rather,;
 he says, he wants to describe
 how the, Vietcong use and jus-.
 tify terror as a crucial part of
 their war strategy.
 Current Vietcong. doctrine,
 Pike contends, calls for terror,
 for three purposes: to dimin-
 ish the allies' forces, to main-
 tain or boost Communist mo-
 'rale, and to scare and diso-
 rient the populace. He says
 the enemy seems to be moving
 more and more toward a ter-
 rorist strategy a3 part of a
 new kind of protracted war,
 i(Official government terrorist
 statistics show a sharp in-
 crease in kidnapings, assassi-
 nations and other terrorism in
 recent months.)
 In central Vietnam, Pike
 writes, Vietcong  units are
 giyen terrorist quotas. to fulfill
 As an example, he cites Intelli-
 gence information that special
 Vietcong squads, in parts of
 two provinces were told to
 "annihilate" 277 persons' dur-
 ing the first half of 1969..
 In the.most detailed analy-
 sis of the killings at Hue yet
 published, Pike writes that
 "despite contrary appearances,
 virtually no Communist ki~ling
 was due to rage, frustration or
 panic during the Communist I
 withdrawal" from Hue, which
 the Vietcong held for 24 days
 in February 1988.
 "Such   explanations   are.

 "but they fair to hold 'up'

 - Aecording to Pike's analysis
 of the Hue massacres, the
 Communists  changed  their
 minds twice after seizing the
 ,city on Jan., 31, At first, Pike
 writes   he claims, captured,
 documents  show   this-the
 Vietcong expected to hold Hue
 for just seven days.
 During that first phase, Pike
 says, the. Vietcong purpose-

 i als whose elimination 'would
 'greatly weaken the govern.

 ' After they held on more
 than seven days, Pike's theory
 continues, the Communists deg
 1-tided! they would be able to
 stay in. Hue indefinitely. Pris-
 oners, . ralliers and intercepted
 messages at the time confirm
 .this, according to Pike.
 In this euphoric mood, he
 writes,' the Communists set
 out to reconstruct Hue society,
 eliminating not just specific
 individuals, but whole catego=.
 ries of citizens whose exist
 ence would hinder-creation of
 a new .revolutionary society.
 'Perhaps, 2,000 of the estimated'
 5,800 persons killed at Hue ;
 were slain during this . second
 phase, Pike suggest.
 Eventually, Pike continues,'.
 the battle turned against the
 Communists- in Hue and they
 realized they would have to
 abandon the city. This realiza.
 tion led to phase three, Pike
 writes:  "elimination of wits;

 ground Vietcong structure in
 Hue had probably revealed it
 self by this time, and now had
 to protect itself by elimi iating

 THE COMMUNIST SCENE
 (24 April - 22 May 1970)
 1.   Last Gasp of the Lenin Centenary
 After nearly two years of build-up and several days of adulation, the
 joyless jubilee for Lenin's centenary of 22 April is over.   Communist leaders,
 including those from 66 non-ruling parties (Moscow's figures) have departed
 leaving the Soviets with the very same problems they had hoped to solve or
 to lessen with their costly, tedious anniversary-year programs:
 nationalism remains a major force, both in the Satellites and
 non-ruling parties, despite all that the Soviets said Lenin
 said about the necessity for proletarian internationalism;
 the need to galvanize the Soviet people into greater produc-
 tivity to pull the Soviet Union out of the industrial and
 agricultural doldrums is unchanged.
 All ruling parties were represented except China and Albania.  All. spoke
 but the substance was thin and the words familiar.   Each speaker used Lenin's
 writings as a quarry (the Guardian weekly suggested) from which to dig out
 words to justify his own Party's already well-known policies.   President Tito
 of Yugoslavia, conspicuously absent, had his say in an 18 April Pravda article.
 Citing Lenin against rigidity of doctrine, Tito defended his nationalistic ap-
 proach to socialism and challenged Soviet claims that the Brezhnev doctrine
 of limited sovereignty is pure Leninism.  President Nicolae Ceausescu of Ruma-
 nia emphasized his country's neutrality in the Sino-Soviet polemical battle,.
 It is significant that these two leaders who have taken their countries
 furthest from Soviet domination, probably are most popular, personally, at
 home.  At the other extreme was Czechoslovakia's Party Secretary Gustav Husak
 who thanked the Soviet Union for the 1968 Warsaw Pact invasion and the occu-
 pation of his countryl   Others mouthed platitudes according to the degree to
 which they rest under the Soviet thumb.
 Host Brezhnev's three-hour speech called for strengthening the Warsaw
 Pact, defended the invasion of Czechoslovakia which was formalized into a
 doctrine bearing his name. In a display of the Great Russian chauvinism
 against which Lenin had warned, Brezhnev lashed out at deviationism, national-
 ism and Red China and other such evils.   There was nothing new, no hint of
 accommodation to the national needs of other parties with other cultures, not
 the slightest suggestion that the CPSU understands problems of rising expecta-
 tions in Communist countries and of the technological revolution in the world
 or that it is able to provide the leadership to solve them.   There was nothing
 to convince the Soviet citizen he would have anything more to eat or pur-
 chase than past promises; or that he would gain any greater control. over his
 own life.

 Around the world, Lenin celebrations were used to beat the same old ene-
 mies and defend the same old policies.   Communist China, to be different,
 celebrated alone by stepping up polemics against the CPSU, which China has
 accused for the past ten years of betraying Leninist principles.   The Peoples
 Da:    , Red Flag, and Liberation Daily of 22 April. carried a joint 3-page ar-
 ticle of name-calling while claiming, as always, to be the sole interpreters
 of the "universal truths" of Marxism-Leninism (see attachment).
 "Celebrations" planned by non-ruling Communist Parties and. Soviet embas-
 sies were marked by non-enthusiasm and non-attendance from Brussels to New
 Delhi.. Ritual speeches, exhibits and receptions were arranged, papers were
 published, but few -- either Party members or public -- seemed to care enough
 to listen or attend.
 Perhaps the only significant event of the whole Lenin centennial, was an
 angry attack by the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) on the CPSU for violating
 the most fundamental thesis of Lenin that Party unity must be preserved at all
 costs and that "splitters" must be severely dealt with.  Akahata, theoretical
 journal of the JCP, delivered the blast in its 5 May issue, onthe grounds that
 Soviet officials had supported the splinter Communist group identified with
 Yoshio Shiga by attending the centenary celebrations put on by the splinter
 faction.   Some years ago the JCP broke relations with the CPSU because of the
 latter's clandestine support to the splinter group, but in 1968, relations
 were somewhat repaired when the Soviets agreed to withdraw this support.   The
 JCP now reminds the Soviets of their bargain and accuses them of betrayal.
 2.   Burial Rite for the Czechoslovak Ex eriment
 Under slogans chosen by the Czechoslovak Central Committee for the occa-
 sion, Soviet and Czechoslovak leaders held another cheerless celebration, the
 25th anniversary of the Soviet "liberation" of Czechoslovakia which wound up
 with the 6 May signing of a new 20-year joint treaty of "friendship, coopera-
 tion and mutual assistance."  The treaty is like a burial rite, a final gesture
 to mark the end of the Czechoslovak experiment which started with the ascendan-
 cy of the Dubcek leadership in January 1968 and which was ended by the Soviet
 invasion in August 1968.
 While this treaty closely resembles other USSR-Warsaw Pact treaties, the
 f`"ew additions and perhaps the deletions, are significant.   The key new para-
 graph is the long-feared incorporation of the Brezhnev doctrine of limited
 sovereignty,   The Soviets would doubtless like to incorporate this feature
 into all future treaties with the East European Communist regimes.   How or
 whether the Brezhnev Doctrine is included in the initialed but still unsigned
 Soviet-Rumanian treaty will be of special interest and will be of immediate
 and extreme concern to all Communist regimes.
 To understand what the treaty means, not merely what it says, a glossary
 of Communist euphemisms and circumlocutions might be useful for non-Communists.
 While the Brezhnev Doctrine, of course, is not mentioned, every good Communist
 will recognize that notorious doctrine in these words from the Preamble:
 "Confirming that the support, consolidation and protection of socialist
 achieved at the price of the heroic efforts and selfless labour of each pgains
 eople,
 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000400090001-3
 are a common internationalist duty of socialist countries..." (our underlining)?
 Thus, any Communist country, if not itself the victim of Soviet-ordered inter-
 vention, is obligated to assist Soviet forces to dethrone a neighbor or attack
 a "deviationist."  This proviso implicitly strengthens the possibility of Soviet
 adventurism in international disputes, the current quarrel with Communist China
 being the most immediate example.   Earlier treaties had described the relation-
 ship to the USSR as according to "principles of socialist internationalism."
 These "principles" which are also mentioned in Article 1 of the new treaty, are
 understood to mean that binding decisions will be handed down by the CPSU to
 other Communist Parties.   That principle and its domestic counterpart "demo-
 cratic centralism," are a basic control weapon of the CPSU and continuaLly un-
 der attack by Yugoslavia and by dissidents in many non-ruling parties.
 Article 10 includes the obligation of each party to consider an attack
 on the other as "an attack against itself," to offer "every assistance, in-
 cluding armed assistance" to the other regardless of the quarter from which
 the attack is mounted.   The Warsaw Pact treaty and other Soviet bilateral
 treaties with its Satellites expressly limit mutual defense obligations to
 Europe.   By omitting this limitation in the current treaty, the way is open
 for use of Czechoslovak troops to assist the USSR anywhere in the world,
 Communist China being the outstanding possibility at this time.
 Another new addition is Article 4, which provides for direct "ties be-
 tween bodies of state power and the public organizations of working people...":
 sanctification for close Soviet inspection, and even supervision, of Czecho-
 slovaks at every level.   It undoubtedly means the presence of a Soviet advi-
 sor in every key area of Party and government and the type of "shadow"
 government which prevailed in the pre-Dubcek era.
 The Soviet Union apparently thought better of consecrating a "mutual
 friendship treaty" with agreement for armed occupation of the "friend's" ter-
 ritory.  Without public sanction the military occupation may be considered
 somewhat extra-legal but that is a nicety of little value to the Czecho-
 slovaks.   By omitting any mention of troops the USSR has avoided any awk-
 ward precedents in the wording of treaties following future occupations.
 3. Rumania:  The Next Beneficiary of "Normalization?"
 The Soviet-Czech treaty signed on 6 May can be taken as the signal. that
 the Soviets are finally satisfied that they have "normalized" Czechoslovakia,
 nearly two years after their invasion.  All outstanding differences have been
 ironed out;  no more issues requiring "negotiation" or compromise.
 The Soviets may now be addressing themselves to a "normalization" of
 Rumania.  At least, that seems to be the import of the news that the Ruma-
 nian  leaders suddenly and unexpectedly were summoned to a meeting in Moscow
 with Soviet leaders on 19 May.  A Soviet-Rumanian treaty was initialed two
 years ago; again and again the formal signing has been postponed.   The main
 reason may be that the Soviets wish to achieve a normalization a la Czecho-
 slovakia before they signal their satisfaction by signing a, treaty.   But there
 are a host of differences which will be difficult to flatten out:   the appli-

 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000400090001-3
 cability of the Brezhnev Doctrine, the applicability of the Warsaw Pact be-
 yond Europe (e.g. to defend against Chinese attack), the holding of maneu-
 vers on Rumanian soil, relations with China, integration of East European
 economies with that of the Soviet Union, the role of CEMA (Council. for Mu-
 tual Economic Aid) and other transnational mechanisms, etc.  A brief commu-
 nique after the short visit gave no suggestion that any of the problems had
 been ironed out.
 With Soviet troubles multiplying on many Communist and diplomatic fronts,
 especially relations with China and the awkwardness of their situation with
 respect to Cambodia, Soviet patience with Rumanian "obstructionism" may very
 likely run out, so that rumors of a Soviet forcible attempt to bring the mav-
 erick Rumania into line are more plausible than they have been for many
 months.   The question that is raised is whether the Soviets will continue to
 treat the Rumanian sickness with the therapy of persuasion, pressure, bribery,
 etc, or whether they will resort to the surgery of another invasion.
 ~.   Community of Communist Dissidence
 a. Garaudy Accuses the PCF of Abetting Czech Stalinization
 With Roger Garaudy's long pursued quarrel with the French Communist
 Party (PCF) leadership and with his expulsion from the Politburo, his ouster
 from the PCF was no surprise.  On 30 April Garaudy was ousted by his Party
 cell, a move which was then, as expected, ratified on 20 May by the Central
 Committee.   The real news came in Garaudy's letter (published in Le Monde)
 to his cell secretary acknowledging the cell's action (the original and a
 translation are attached).   Garaudy set off a major scandal when he revealed
 in his letter that in late 1969 the PCF leaders had sent to the post-Dubcek
 leadership material which would help in the campaign to denigrate and punish
 Dubcek.   Garaudy pointed out that the current pro-Soviet Czech leadership
 had publicly thanked the French for their help in the "normalization" program.
 George.Marchais; acting Secretary General of the PCF, at first denied
 the accusation, but when Garaudy used French radio to read the Czechoslovak
 leader's acknowledgement of PCF help and announced that the transcript of the
 Waldeck-Rochet/Dubcek exchange would be published in full in the French Com-
 munist dissident magazine Politique Aujourd'hui on 20 May, Marchais capitu-
 lated and had the document published in the regular French Communist daily
 L'Humanite.  Among the more damaging statements in the transcript was Wald-
 eck-Rochet's warning about the danger of reviving the Social Democratic Party.
 The lesson will not be lost on the French non-Communist left with
 which Marchais claims he wishes to cooperate.  Waldeck-Rochet's warning to
 Dubcek that it is better to do without the existence of social democratic par-
 ties reveals the true, as distinguished from the public, attitude of Commu-
 nists toward the non-Communist left.
 Finally, it might be noted that the PCF's shameful collaboration in
 Czech "normalization" (re-Stalinization) is symbolic of the PCF's gradual and
 now apparently complete about-face from a gesture of independence in its con-
 Approved For Release 1999/09/02 : CIA-RDP79-01194A000400090001-3
 demnation of the Czechoslovak invasion to a posture of total subservience to
 Soviet ends.   The PCF, too, has been fully normalized.
 b.   Communist anti-Soviet Film:   "L'Aveu"
 The PCF's difficult position as a result of the Garaudy expose is
 not made easier by the fact that the French public is flocking to see a film,
 L'Aveu (The Confession), made by a Greek Communist, Constantine Costa Gavras,
 on the notorious Stalinist mass purge trials in the early 1950's centered on
 the Czech leader Slansky.   For a time, during the Dubcek era (until April
 1969), it was acceptable to condemn Stalinism, as this movie does, but now
 that Czechoslovakia and the PCF are normalized, L'Humanite finds it necessary
 to condemn the film as anti-Communist and anti-Soviet.   The attached article
 in the English edition of Le Monde of 13 May, gives a detailed account of the
 film and the PCF's attitude toward it.
 c.  Austrian Communist Prager Bids Farewell to the Party
 Theodor Prager, a long-time member of the Austrian Communist Party,
 adds his name to the growing roster of prominent ex-Communists.   In Prager's
 case, as his simple and quiet testimonial appearing in the April issue of
 Politique Aujourd'hui shows, the Austrian Communist Party's continuing serv-
 ing of Soviet rather than its own ends was the essential feature he could
 not condone.   (Prager's "Farewell to the Party" is attached.)

 Ceausescu, President of Ru-

 anniversary of the birth of
 Lenin.
 From all indications, virtual-
 ly every Communist party ex-
 cept China's will be repre-
 ented at the largest assembly
 f top Communists since last
 une's meeting of Communist
 eaders In Moscow. Following

 every Communist country must
 chart its own course, an in-

 to pressure its Eastern Euro-
 pean allies to follow its policies.

 Soviet negotiations -- he un-
 derscored his refusal to allow
 Rumania's Warsaw Pact forces
 to be used against Communist

 In the last year, Rumanian
 sources have said that the So-

 get support from its Warsaw
 Pact allies to show that any
 But Mr. Ceausescu, after stat-1
 operate with other Warsaw
 Pact countries,' said that its
 armed forces were always ready
 "to make their contribution in
 ,defense of the interests of so-
 cialism and peace from any im-
 perialist aggression."
 Cuban Leader Arrives
 If Mr. Ceausescu's remarks
 Indicated continued differences
 with Moscow, the arrival of
 President Osvaldo DorticosTor
 redo of Cuba underscored t4e
 Improvement in Soviet-Cuban
 relations In the last year.
 Mr. Dorticos had been sched-
 uled to represent Cuba at the
 1967 anniversary In Moscow
 marking the 50th ? anniversary
 of the Bolshevik revolution.
 But differences on ideological
 and economic Issues led Premier
 Fidel Castro at the last moment
 to substitute the Public Health
 Minister fo' Mr. Dorticos, In
 effect snubbing the Russians.
 Relations have Improved as
 a result of Mr. Castro's..less
 aggressive  policy  in' Latin
 America and agreement on the
 The most important leader to
 arrive so far, from Moscow's
 viewpoint? was Le Duan, the
 First Secretary of the North
 Vietnamese party, and the man.
 thought likely to replace Ho
 Chi Minh as the dominant t
 figure In Hanoi.
 Also arriving today was Choi
 Yong Kun, the head of state of
 North Korea. Both North
 Viet-nam and North Korea are trying
 to remain, neutral in the Chi-
 nese-Soviet rift, and are being
 !actively courted by Moscow and
 !Peking.
 Presumably,   Mr.   Duan's
 presence will give Soviet lead-
 ers an occasion to have a full
 discussion of the situation In
 Southeast Asia,, as well as the
 various proposals for a new
 Geneva conference.
 Any question that the Soviet
 leadership has been changed
 was disposed of today with the
 traditional posting of portraits
 of the 11-man Politburo in vas
 lions parts of Moscow. They all
 were accounted for in the usual
 order, led by General SecretaryLeonid I. Brezhnev.
