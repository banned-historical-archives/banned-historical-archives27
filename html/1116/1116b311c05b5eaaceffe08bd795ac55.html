 MIDDLE EAST:   Diplomacy
 Israeli Prime Minister Begin's speech to the
 Knesset yesterday contained no surprises or hints of greater
 flexibility.  Begin did little more  than recount the public
 events of the past two weeks and reiterate his desire for peace
 and for negotiations with all of the Arabs,  except the Pales-
 tine Liberation Organization..
 Begin repeated his agreement--this time formally--to
 hold an informal meeting in Cairo to prepare the way for the
 Geneva peace conference.  He also named two senior bureaucrats
 to represent Israel,  at least initially,  at the talks.
 Both Begin's speech and his choice of representatives
 reflect Israel's decision apparently to take a cautious approach
 for now to Egyptian President Sadat's public initiatives.  Begin
 and Foreign Minister Dayan have repeatedly sought to lower pub-
 lic expectations in Israel by insisting that Sadat's visit to
 Jerusalem does not mean that Israel must make substantive con-
 cession in return and that differences still remain to be re-
 solved through negotiations.  Indeed,  Dayan has deliberately
 sought to blur the distinction between a concession that would
 help reduce Arab suspicions that Sadat is seeking a separate
 peace agreement and one meant only to reward Egypt.
 By responding in low-key ways, Begin and Dayan may be
 hoping to reduce public pressures on them to move faster and
 further than they are now prepared or perhaps able to go in
 making concessions. At the same time,  they wish to appear respon-
 sive to Sadat but avoid charges from Israeli hard-liners that
 they have given up too much in advance of real negotiations.
 According to one usually well-informed Israeli corre-
 spondent, the Israeli Defense Ministry is preparing working pa-
 pers in anticipation of the talks in Cairo.  The working papers
 reportedly take for granted that Sadat cannot conclude a sepa-
 rate agreement with Israel now and that Israel must come up with
 some new ideas to resolve the Palestinian problem. The corre-
 spondent suggested that the Israelis might formulate compromise
 proposal somewhere between Dayan's functional plan for the West
 Bank and the demand for Palestinian autonomy.

 Because of Libya's negative reaction to Sadat's
 diplomatic initiatives,  the Egyptians are apprehensive about
 Libyan President Qadhafi's future moves. The Egyptians probably
 do not foresee a resumption of hostilities along the border,
 but they are taking the precaution of keeping a sizable mili-
 tary force in the area.
 Japanese Prime Minister Fukuda's reshuffle of cabinet
 posts over the weekend has strengthened the  lineup of his eco-
 nomic policymakers and his control of the ruling Liberal Demo-
 cratic Party. Fukuda advanced his timetable for the cabinet
 changes, which were expected next month, in part to organize
 his new team before responding to recent US proposals for cor-
 recting Japan's growing trade surplus. The Prime Minister in
 fact suggested Zast week that several economic initiatives
 are in the offing and he may well announce some of them in the
 next few days.
 Fukuda's primary objective was to strengthen the
 cabinet's economic portfolios.
 Tatsuo Murayama,  the Finance Minister,  is an economist
 and a close confidant of Fukuda. He is certain to follow the
 Prime Minister's lead in guiding the Ministry, which is the
 heavyweight in the Japanese economic policymaking establishment.
 Toshio Komoto,  the new International Trade and Industry
 Minister, is one of the ruling party's most effective brokers
 with the business community. Komoto, who has long supported the
 business community's call for more economic stimulation, has

 previously clashed with Fukuda over the Prime Minister's reluc-
 tance to push a more reflationary approach.  Fukuda may hope,
 however, that Komoto can use his connections to win business
 support for a compromise approach to economic policy.
 Ichiro Nakagawa,  the Minister of Agriculture and an
 agriculture policy specialist, has long been an outspoken con-
 servative advocate of Japanese interests. Given the current
 pressures to liberalize Japan's agricultural trade policies,
 Fukuda may well have selected him for the politically sensitive
 post in part to smooth the way for any policy changes with
 rural voters, who strongly support the Liberal Democrats.
 Kiichi Miyazawa,  Director of the Economic Planning
 Agency,  is an economic policy specialist. A former Foreign
 Minister and Director of the planning agency, Miyazawa is
 likely to strengthen the Agency's role as the mediator in the
 government's internal policy disputes and also serve as a
 general spokesman for Japan in international forums.
 Fukuda's leverage in policy debates is likely to be
 strengthened by his selection of Sunao Sunoda as Foreign Min-
 ister and Nobuhiko Ushiba,  a former ambassador to the US, as
 Minister without Portfolio.  Sonoda, one of Fukuda's senior
 lieutenants, has played an active role--resented by Foreign
 Ministry officials--as the Prime Minister's chief cabinet sec-
 retary in negotiations with both Peking and Moscow. He is cer-
 tain to continue to operate in controversial style as Foreign
 Minister.
 Ushiba, who is charged with coordinating international
 economic policy,  is also a long-time Fukuda adviser. Because
 he has experience in dealing with the US, he is likely to be-
 come one of the government's key contact men in any interna-
 tional negotiations.
 Fukuda's new cabinet maintains a rough balance among
 the Liberal Democrats'  internal factions--including those of
 party Secretary General Ohira and former Prime Minister Tanaka,
 the two leaders whose support brought Fukuda to power last
 December. Even so, Fukuda has strengthened his intra-party po-
 sition by naming his former rival, Yasuhiro Nakasone, as one
 of the Liberal Democratic Party's senior executives.
 Fukuda is certain to continue depending on Ohira as
 his primary political ally, but the Prime Minister almost

 certainly regards his ties with Nakasone as added insurance
 should there be any attempt next year to mount a direct challenge
 to unseat him.
 //Ethiopian forces reportedly still con-
 trolled the key stronghold of Harar in the Ogaden Region yes-
 terday, although chances are probably better than ever that
 the city will fall to the Somalis soon.  The  loss of Harar would
 cause Ethiopian military men who are already critical of the
 ruling council to question its  leadership even more. A serious
 threat to the council's survival, however, would probably take
 time to develop, and the council would have at least an even
 chance of remaining in power in the near term even if Ethiopia
 suffers a serious military defeat in the Ogaden or Eritrea./
 //The Egyptian military attache in Somalia, Colo-
 nel Halim,  told the US Ambassador on Sunday that the Somalis
 have a 75-percent chance of taking Harar. He did not believe,
 however,  they would meet their timetable of completing the of-
 fensive by Saturday.//
 //According to Halim, the Somalis have not cut
 the road from Harar to Dire Dawa but can control traffic because
 they hold positions in the nearby hills. He thought the Ethiopians
 might leave their forces besieged in Harar rather than attempt to
 withdraw them.  The Somalis reportedly have lost many men but not
 much equipment during the two-week attack.
 //A small Ethiopian counteroffensive along the
 rail line from Dire Dawa late last week reportedly stalled some
 30 kilometers northeast of the city when the attackers ran into
 Somali units.         Another Ethiopian attempt to relieve Somali pres-
 sure on the Harar - Dire Dawa road apparently also failed.//
 These Ethiopian attacks seem to be tactical responses
 to the Somali assault on Harar rather than the beginning of a
 concerted counteroffensive.  For several weeks the Ethiopians
 have been planning a counterdrive into Somalia but the Somalis
 appear to have regained the momentum,  and a concerted Ethiopian
 counterassault this year does not appear likely.

 Dissatisfaction within the Ethiopian military,  though
 widespread, is unfocused.  Some military personnel disagree with
 the council's political program,  especially its socialist domes-
 tic policies, while others criticize its ineffectiveness in
 meeting the threat from Somalia.
 Dissidence is most evident among the troops in Eritrea,
 and---to a lesser extent--among those in the Ogaden.  In Eritrea,
 many of the military personnel are weary of fighting a war they
 believe cannot be won.  In the Ogaden,  there is friction between
 the regular army and the recently formed people's militia.  Regu-
 lar army officers are also angry over the council's attempt to
 place political cadres among their commands.   Shortages of rations
 and military supplies have damaged morale.
 It is difficult to gauge the extent of militant oppo-
 sition to the council.  Those people who do oppose the council
 and Chairman Mengistu are not united and are leaderless.  Suc-
 cessive purges have eliminated most of the officers likely to
 mount a serious challenge to Mengistu.  The swift execution of
 Mengistu's opponents has no doubt cowed other would-be plotters.
 Many of the remaining officers either support Mengistu or lack
 the talent or desire for political intrigue.
 Even those antigovernment officers and troops who might
 seriously consider moving against Mengistu would face the possi-
 bility that others might accuse them of further weakening Ethi-
 opia's military effort against the Somalis and the Eritreans.
 Whatever their attitude toward the council, many officers are
 still reluctant to risk starting a civil war.
 If the troops in the Ogaden or Eritrea suffer a humil-
 iating defeat, however,  they could react emotionally and demand
 the council's ouster.  They might be joined by units in Addis
 Ababa that so far have remained loyal to Mengistu.  It is possi-
 ble that in such a situation none of the contending military

 factions would be able to gain decisive control of the govern-
 ment quickly, and Ethiopia's ability to counter the Eritreans
 or the Somalis would be further weakened.
 USSR: Sakharov Wants to Visit US
 Dissident spokesman Andrey Sakharov  told the US Em-
 bassy in Moscow yesterday that Soviet authorities have refused
 to accept his request to visit the US.  He has been invited by
 George Meany to attend the AFL-CIO meeting in Los Angeles next
 month.  Unlike December 1975,  when the USSR denied him permis-
 sion to receive the Nobel Peace Prize on the grounds that he
 had past access  to state secrets,  Soviet officials this time
 merely said the invitation was  "improper" and left open the
 possibility that they may grant Sakharov an exit permit.
 Sakharov said authorities told him the invitation
 must be to him as Meany's personal guest, not as a participant
 in a meeting "which did not have permanent character." Sakharov
 added that if he receives an invitation that satisfies the
 authorities, he intends to try again to obtain exit documenta-
 tion for himself and his wife.  Mrs.  Sakharov returned to Moscow
 from Italy last week after the Soviets denied a further exten-
 sion of her exit visa that enabled her to obtain medical treat-
 ment this fall.

 The fact that Sakharov is making a request for foreign
 travel  knowing that he could be barred from returning home--is
 another sign -.--hat his past determination to stay in Moscow in
 order to carr:7 on his struggle against Soviet authorities may
 be weakening. A Western newsr.?an recently quoted Sakharov as
 saying that dissidents who have a chance to leave the USSR
 "must" do so. Earlier this month,  the Soviets permitted promi-
 nent dissident and former general Petr Grigorenko to visit the
 US.
 //Polish party leader Gierek arrived in Rome
 yes-rer ay   or a 'four-day official visit.  Although he will hold
 talks with Prime Minister Andreotti and Italian Communist Party
 officials,   the highlight of the trip will be his private audi-
 encE  with Pope Paul on Thursday.//
 //The Vatican and the ailing Polish Primate,
 Stefan Cardinal Wyszynski, have carefully coordinated the ap-
 proach to be taken toward Gierek. Wyszynski has been in Rome
 for three weeks and has undoubtedly conveyed to the Pope his
 concern about Poland's internal tensions.
 The Vatican will also assert its and Cardinal Wyszyn-
 ski's interest in greater freedom for religious education,
 more church building permits, and greater access for the Polish
 Catholic church to the media.  Gierek can already claim that his
 government has issued at least 18 new building permits, and he
 may indicate a willingness to consider other concessions.  He
 hopes to garner support at home from this trip and will want
 the atmospherics to be good.

 In Warsaw,  the US Embassy has noted a sudden a.ncr.e.ase
 in meat available in the metropolitan area and attributes this
 to efforts by the government to calm consumer tensions. P_Nc)rmally,
 the government releases extra supplies to the market several
 weeks before Christmas.  This year's early efforts indicate how
 serious it sees the public mood.  The increase in meat supplies
 has coincided with a larger than usual number of police patrol-
 ling the streets.
 WEST GERMANY:   Schmidt's Diplomacy
 /West German ChanceZZor Schmidt's official visit
 to Poland Last week appears  to have been a mild diplomatic suc-
 cess,  although he signed few new agreements.  This week the West
 German Leader will meet with Italian Prime Minister Andreotti
 to discuss economic issues and terrorism.//
 //According to the communique issued in Warsaw,
 Schmidt and Polish leader Gierek concentrated on improving bi-
 lateral relations by stressing mutual "intentions" toward a num-
 ber of issues,                  including disarmament, nonproliferation, East-
 West cooperation, development aid to the Third World, and ef-
 forts to achieve unbiased education in their respective school
 systems.  The latter initiative is intended primarily to weaken
 Polish animosity toward Germans.//
 //The two leaders signed a memorandum calling for
 increased economic cooperation among medium and small industries
 in both countries, but no financial agreements were announced.
 One proposal that might lead to a promising East-West venture
 was a suggestion that West Germany and Poland cooperate on joint
 industrial projects in third countries.  Such cooperation might
 open the door to similar arrangements between other countries
 in Eastern and Western Europe.  The two leaders also expressed
 interest in cooperation in the electric power field.//
 //While admitting that both countries were tied to
 their respective mutual defense organizations,  Schmidt empha-
 sized that Poland and West Germany share a common concern about
 the arms race and that both have worked toward arms limitation
 in Europe. He said that it is inevitable that the Poles and West

 Germans "will play an outstanding role in the Vienna talks,"
 but he waffled when asked whether the two countries might pre-
 sent a coordinated position at the force reduction talks.//
 Press reaction in West Germany to the trip was generally
 favorable, but the opposition in Bonn scored the Chancellor for
 ignoring the question of human rights in Poland.  It is doubtful,
 however, that the opposition can do much to destroy the impres-
 sion that the visit was a mild success. One news commentator re-
 minded Helmut Kohl,  leader of the opposition Christian Democrats,
 that he was invited to accompany Schmidt to Poland but elected
 to stay home.
 Schmidt's visit to Italy originally was scheduled for
 August but the escape from an Italian prison of a Nazi war
 criminal temporarily soured bilateral relations, and the visit
 was postponed. Schmidt and Andreotti are scheduled to meet in
 Verona in turbulent northern Italy, and some demonstrations are
 likely.
 AZZ members of Greek Prime Minister Caramanlis' new
 ca znet,  appointed yesterday,  come from his New Democracy
 Pari-y.  Earlier reports suggested that CaramanZis might form
 a coalition government with the Union of the Democratic Center,
 which dropped to a distant third in the balloting,  but some
 leaders of the Union apparently resisted joining the government
 because they feared the party would Zose its identity alto-
 gether.
 Some ministers served in the previous government,
 although most now have different portfolios.  To recoup some
 of the losses his party suffered at the polls, Caramanlis ap-
 pointed a few new men to ministries that have frequent contact
 with the public.
 The most significant transfer of portfolios was in
 the  "inner cabinet." Minister of Coordination Panayiotis Papa-
 ligouras replaced Demetrios Bitsios as Foreign Minister, while
 Minister of Education George Rallis took over the Coordinatipn
 portfolio.  Defense Minister Evangelos Averof, who has served
 as a bridge to the military,  continues in office.

 In an apparent effort to avoid alienating these three
 men--one of whom might possibly succeed him--Caramanlis filled
 one of the two positions of Deputy Prime Minister with Con-
 stantine Papaconstantinou, a respected party elder and formerly
 President of Parliament. The other slot remains vacant.
 A new ministry with special responsibility for rela-
 tions with the European Community was also created, indicating
 that Caramanlis expects to devote much attention to ne otsations
 for EC membership during his second term in office.                        25X1
 Leaders of the South-West Africa People's
 Organization on Sunday rejected a proposal by  the Western con-
 tact group for resolving the impasse between SWAPO and Pretoria
 over the South African military presence in Namibia.
 The SWAPO leaders again demanded that all South African
 troops be withdrawn before a preindependence election is held.
 They did this despite warnings that SWAPO must compromise on
 the troop issue in order to obtain an overall agreement on an
 independence program for Namibia.  South African Prime Minister
 Vorster has insisted that 4,000 men remain until an independent
 government is established;  the contact group has proposed a
 residual force of 1,500.
 Conceivably,  the SWAPO leaders intended their
 adamant statement as a tactic preliminary to hard bargaining.
 Although Nujoma said on Sunday that SWAPO was not clos-
 ing the door to further negotiations,  the contact group doubts
 that SWAPO will accept any South African residual force unless
 the presidents of the frontline countries exert concerted pres-
 sure on SWAPO's leadership.

 Since the contact group met with Nyerere on 21 November,
 Presidents Khama of Botswana and Kaunda of Zambia also have ex-
 pressed qualified support for the Western settlement package.
 On the other hand, Angolan President Neto, who holds relatively
 more leverage over SWAPO, has put off meeting the contact group
 until Angola's ruling Popular Movement concludes its first party
 congress, which begins Sunday.
 CHINA-YUGOSLAVIA: Party Relations
 China and Yugoslavia apparently are establishing
 party-to-party relations.  While there was no official announce-
 ment of the move--and none is  likely--an official Chinese mes-
 sage yesterday on the occasion of Yugoslavia's national day ex-
 tended warm congratulations  to the  "League of Communists of
 Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav government and people" on behalf
 of the  "Communist Party of China and the Chinese people." Chair-
 man Hua Kuo-feng sent the message in his dual capacities as head
 of the Chinese Government and party  to President Tito,  who holds
 equivalent posts.
 The two countries decided to move ahead with party
 relations in September during a visit to China by President
 Tito, who has long been eager to balance Yugoslavia's party
 ties with the USSR. The move reflects Chinese desires to im-
 prove their relations with Belgrade before Tito dies. The Chi-
 nese are concerned that Tito's death will create openings for
 the USSR to expand its influence in Yugoslavia.  In this sense,
 mutual opposition to Soviet dominance rather than any resolution
 of ideological differences has provided the basis for the estab-
 lishment of party ties.
 Domestic and foreign policy considerations are behind
 the cautious manner in which Peking is easing into the new re-
 lationship with Belgrade.  The move is a reversal of the position
 taken by Mao Tse-tung, who sided with Moscow during the Soviet-
 Yugoslav break in 1948. Mao persisted in his opposition to Yu-
 goslav "revisionism" despite China's own split with the Soviets
 a decade later. Any alteration of a policy so closely identified
 with Mao is clearly a matter of some delicacy for the current
 Chinese leadership.

 The establishment of party ties with Yugoslavia will
 create additional problems for China in dealing with Albania--
 which remains ideologically opposed to Yugoslavia--and could
 prompt additional defections of Communist splinter parties from
 the Chinese side to the Albanian side. Anticipation of such com-
 plications may in part explain why China early this month pub-
 lished a comprehensive and authoritative ideological justifica-
 tion of its foreign policy.
 VENEZUELA: Anti-Insurgent Activity
 /The Perez administration in Venezuela is inten-
 sifying its efforts  to eliminate growing insurgent activity
 in the eastern states of Anzoategui and Monagas b  stationing
 four additional ranger battalions in the area.
 //The government's embarrassment over its ina-
 bility to eliminate the 150 to 200 guerrillas was heightened
 last week when an army patrol suffered six killed and five
 wounded in an ambush.
 Unless the government can regain control soon, more
 drastic measures may be necessary.  Some military leaders be-
 lieve that the guerrillas are feeling confident enough to take
 on army and national guard units at will. They are also con-
 cerned that the insurgents may be planning to increase their
 activity--possibly even opening a "second front" in the west-
 ern states--to coincide with the formal start of the general
 election campaign early next year.

 ish-built Centurions it now has. Although they have not ruled
 out any options,  defense officials may decide before the end
 of the year to buy some 400 of the new West German tanks when
 they become available, rather than the earlier model Leopard
 I or the US-built XM-1 that is still being tested.//
 //According to a Dutch military attache in Bonn,
 the Dutch favor the Leopard II over the XM-l because it will
 probably be available by 1979, at least a year before the XM-l;

 that he would oppose buying fewer tanks simply to save money,

 tanks. The Dutch tank force currently includes about 350
 Centurions with 105-mm guns, more than 450 Leopard I tanks,  and
 a number of older or obsolete Centurions.//

 The Soviets have been negotiating with a US firm
 since last spring to buy production technology for coatings
 needed for gas turbine engines with higher corrosion resistance
 and higher turbine inlet temperatures than those the Soviets
 now produce.
 The coatings would be used to produce marine, air-
 craft, and industrial gas turbine engines;  the Soviets use
 such power plants on several classes of high-speed naval ships
 and aircraft.  Increasing the corrosion resistance of marine
 gas turbine engines permits longer operating times between
 overhauls and engine changes. Increasing the turbine inlet
 temperatures increases engine efficiency and allows a longer
 operating range.
