 China's Seventh
 Five-Year Plan                                                25X1
 Summary       We believe current leadership changes in Beijing will lead to a slowdown in
 Information available the economic reform program and a postponement of some of the more
 as oft March 1987 controversial and innovative proposals. Statements by Chinese leaders,
 was used in this report.
 however, suggest that the basic economic goals in the Seventh Five-Year
 Plan (1986-90) remain unchanged and that the Chinese will pursue the
 Plan's three major goals:
 ? Invigorating state-owned enterprises by making them independent eco-
 nomic entities responsible for their own production, profits, and losses.
 ? Expanding the role of markets.
 ? Reducing the use of direct administrative regulation to control the
 economy and increasing the role of indirect macroeconomic levers (such
 as taxes and interest rates).
 Progress in reaching these goals will be hampered by the need to back off
 temporarily on some supporting reforms, including labor and price reform,
 which were planned for 1987. Because of the unsettled political situation, it
 is difficult to forecast how long reform will be affected, but these
 supporting reforms would increase consumer prices and cut housing and
 food subsidies-moves currently viewed by the Chinese leadership as
 potentially destabilizing.
 The evolution of the plan document suggested an unusual openness in
 China's political process, blending the opinions of a wide circle of
 government, party, and technical experts during the three-year drafting
 period. Both proponents and opponents of reform, within limits, criticized
 current policies and broached still very controversial topics. We expect this
 openness to characterize future planning.
 In general, the Plan's economic production targets appear well thought out
 and attainable-higher than the targets for the past five years, but below
 growth rates achieved during that time. The gross value of industrial and
 agricultural output is planned to increase at 6.7 percent annually. Al-
 though this rate will probably be met as an annual average, the implemen-
 tation of reform during the period is likely to cause overall economic
 growth, as well as the production of individual sectors, to be uneven. The
 increased attention and funding allocated to energy and transportation
 highlight Beijing's concern that these sectors are severe constraints to
 economic growth, but in neither case do we expect planned improvements
 to ease significantly these constraints. We cannot evaluate more minor
 goals of the plan because only highlights of the document have been
 released.

 The plan's targets for regional development illustrate Beijing's growing
 acceptance of the ideological propriety-or at least the economic inevita-
 bility-of income disparities. Economic growth between and within the
 various regions is expected to proceed at different rates, causing unavoid-
 able differences in income.
 A decreasing share of state investment is scheduled to go to military
 expenditures over the period, and the giant Three Gorges Dam hydroelec-
 tric project is not included in the plan. Initial work for a mammoth south-
 to-north water diversion project is included, however, and Beijing may be
 reserving funds in case the Three Gorges Project is approved before 1990.
 Over 900 other major projects call for state capital construction expendi-
 tures of 500 billion yuan (US $135 billion), a jump of almost 50 percent
 above the last plan.
 The impact of the Plan on US economic interests will be mixed. Some US
 industries will benefit from the type of goods that China hopes to purchase;
 the plan calls for imports of computer software, advanced technologies-
 including telecommunications and electronics-and transport- and energy-
 related equipment. Sales opportunities may improve later in the plan period
 because Beijing has pledged to strictly limit spending during the first two
 years. However, a shortage of foreign exchange, fueled by declining
 revenues from oil exports and by China's hesitancy to borrow, will make a
 bonanza unlikely for these US firms even during the later years of the plan.
 Other US industries may be hurt by Beijing's plan to expand its exports by
 8 percent annually. Increased competition will probably come in expanded
 exports of Chinese textiles, grain, coal, and light manufactured goods.
 Many of the manufactured goods China hopes to export also will compete
 with those of US allies in East Asia, which are already experiencing a
 slowdown in their export growth.

 China's Seventh
 Five-Year Plan
 As a result, we look for the Chinese to adhere to the
 major points of their Seventh Five-Year Plan, un-
 veiled at the Fourth Session of the Sixth National
 People's Congress in March 1986. The document,
 which covers the 1986-90 period, includes more than
 the production targets of previous plans, and contains
 sections on politics, science, and education, as well as
 on ideology and foreign affairs. According to the
 Chinese press, the primary task during the next five
 years is to create a sound overall setting in which
 economic reform can progress smoothly. In pursuit of
 this goal, the plan calls for:
 ? Increasing the productivity of medium and large
 state-owned enterprises by making them more re-
 sponsible for their profits and losses.
 ? Gradually expanding the role of markets.
 ? Placing greater emphasis on macroeconomic con-
 trols-such as interest rates and taxes-to guide the
 been put on hold.
 The dismissal in January of Hu Yaobang as General
 Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party has
 chilled the intellectual atmosphere that allowed
 China's economists to explore Western economic con-
 cepts and propose unorthodox approaches to China's
 development problems. Because of the unsettled polit-
 ical situation, it is difficult to forecast how seriously
 and for how long economic reform will be affected;
 nonetheless, official media have highlighted conserva-
 tive themes not seen in many years. An economic
 newspaper praised Chinese self-reliance, a term asso-
 ciated with Maoist economic policies, and other press
 reports criticized Western-style consumerism. A slow-
 down in some areas of reform was looming even
 before Hu's dismissal, as Beijing coped with the social
 side effects of reform. For now at least, planned
 initiatives that would have the greatest impact on
 workers-price reform, reductions in food and hous-
 ing subsidies, and full-scale bankruptcy laws-have
 Although the more radical and potentially destabiliz-
 ing reforms appear dead for the moment, press reports
 and statements by Chinese leaders indicate that Deng
 Xiaoping remains committed to basic economic re-
 form. The official announcement of Hu's removal
 stressed that personnel changes would not affect
 China's opening to the West and that economic
 reform would continue. The appointment of Zhao
 Ziyang, a highly respected advocate of economic
 reform, as acting Party General Secretary was intend-
 ed to send a similar, reassuring signal. Press reports
 and diplomatic reporting suggest that even those
 officials who are critical of market-oriented reforms
 believe that some market mechanisms are necessary
 to prod the planned economy, and favor continued
 exchanges with the West, albeit on a smaller scale
 than reform leaders have advocated.
 economy.
 A Key Five-Year Period
 In our judgment, the 1986-90 period shaped up to be
 a critical one for the reform movement and its
 leadership even before the recent events in Beijing.
 The period is likely to see the death or incapacitation
 of Deng Xiaoping (83 this year), whose vision and
 leadership are largely responsible for the program's
 progress. Popular concern about the permanence of
 the reform policies and the succession will be great, as
 will concern about the ability of Deng's successors to
 manage the reform program.
 The 1986-90 period will probably be a difficult eco-
 nomic one, too. Western economists agree that the
 easiest gains in economic productivity from reform
 have already been achieved. Much of the increase in
 agricultural productivity, for example, was achieved
 by removing state interference from small work units,

 In the late 1920s, the Soviets began constructing five-
 year plans as guidelines for economic planning and to
 motivate production units. China, borrowing from the
 Soviet Union, established its first five-year plan for
 the years 1953 through 1957.
 In both China and the USSR, five-year plans are
 intended to set policy direction and broad goals, and
 often bear little resemblance to the five annual
 plans-the operative directives for enterprises. The
 text of the five-year plan is often not agreed on until
 sometime sifter the planning period has begun, and
 leaves errors, omissions, and changes to be addressed
 in the annual plans. In recent years, both countries
 have invested significant resources in upgrading eco-
 nomic forecasting capabilities to improve their long-
 term planning.
 The targets in China's plan are less ambitious than
 those in the Soviets' 12th Five-Year Plan. And, when
 the plans end in 1990, the results are likely to mirror
 those of the most recent plans-China will surpass
 the majority of its targets, and the Soviet Union will
 fall short. The two countries also differ in the number
 of organizations participating in the planning process.
 Numerous administrative bodies and industrial min-
 istries play an active role in constructing Soviet
 plans, whereas Chinese plans-at least until this
 most recent one-were drawn up by a relatively small
 number of central officials.
 and simply allowing peasants to farm the way they
 wanted. But, in reforming other sectors of the econo-
 my, it will be more difficult to link personal income
 closely to productivity. The more complicated reforms
 that lie ahead also risk greater social and economic
 disruptions than have occurred to date.
 The drafting of the Seventh Five-Year Plan was
 characterized by a new openness in policy formula-
 tion, a process we expect to continue unless Zhao and
 the reformers lose control over economic policy. The
 three-and-a-half-year drafting period saw a clear
 expansion of what could be debated and who could
 participate in that debate. This was in stark contrast
 to the drafting of previous Chinese plans which,
 according to the Chinese press, involved far fewer
 government and party officials and no scholars, scien-
 tists, or businessmen. Moreover, the debate allowed
 discussion of alternative approaches to China's devel-
 opment problems.'
 The Plan is also noteworthy as the first ever to be
 discussed or adopted by the National People's Con-
 gress (NPC) before being distributed for implementa-
 tion, and only the third plan ever to be made public.
 Of these, the First Five-Year Plan (1953-57) was not
 published until July 1955, and the Sixth Plan (1981-
 85) was not released until December 1982. The
 Chinese press publicized the differing opinions of the
 NPC delegates, tabulating their criticisms and dis-
 senting votes-almost as if to prove that the new
 leadership was open minded. Indeed, a comparison
 with the initial text indicates that 31 changes were
 made to Zhao Ziyang's proposal.
 Beijing has not released the entire 100,000-word text.
 However, excerpts in the Chinese press give the
 highlights of each of the 56 chapters, and include the
 major points covered in the proposal for the plan
 published at the National Party Conference in Sep-
 tember 1985 (see appendix).
 Without the text of the entire plan, it is difficult to
 judge how comprehensively economic targets were
 drawn up for the period compared with those for
 ' The debate was confined within limits, of course. Marxism could
 not be rejected, although the form it should take to be suitable to
 modern China could be discussed. A senior party theoretician
 stated in late 1986 that virtually all topics were open to discus-
 sion-except the party's leadership and state ownership of the

 Chronology of the Seventh Five-Year Plan
 Proposal as Described in the Chinese Press
 Early 1983
 The State Council ordered "relevant departments" to
 begin research on the major economic and social
 issues likely to face the nation from 1986 through
 1990. Government leaders in charge of various de-
 partments, administrative regions, and enterprises
 met with scholars from natural and social sciences
 institutes.
 August 1985
 The input from the more than 1,000 people reviewing
 the document was drawn together into the sixth draft.
 The Politburo revised the document, and the seventh
 draft was distributed to all delegates to the coming
 party conference with directions to hold discussions
 on the document.
 Early 1984
 The Central Committee Secretariat and the State
 Council began deliberation on the material being
 gathered.
 April 1985
 Drafting began, under the direction of the Secretariat
 and the State Council, on a "proposal" laying down
 the major tasks, principles, and policies for the Plan.
 July 1985
 The Secretariat, having approved in principle the
 fourth draft of the proposal, submitted the fifth draft
 to a group of 200 individuals for 10 days in mid-July.
 The group included national leaders in the party,
 government, and the military; economists; natural
 scientists; officials from selected large state-owned
 enterprises; and leaders from 10 provinces, munici-
 palities, and autonomous regions. Draft copies were
 also submitted to all members of the Central Com-
 mittee, the Central Advisory Commission, and the
 Central Discipline Inspection Commission asking for
 suggestions.
 Concurrently, the Central Committee called a sympo-
 sium of "party and nonparty democratic personages, "
 whose opinions were incorporated into the eighth
 draft.
 September 1985
 The eighth draft was presented at the Fourth Plenary
 Session of the Central Committee and at the Nation-
 al Conference of Party Delegates, where the proposal
 was made public for the first time. Further revisions
 were made, and the ninth draft was approved by the
 party conference.
 March 1986
 The National People's Congress revised and approved
 Zhao Ziyang's report and a resolution supporting the
 guidelines and policies of the Plan. Excerpts were
 approved and published, and the entire Plan was
 approved in principle.
 previous plans. The new Plan targets tend to be
 slightly conservative, falling between past overly con-
 servative plans and much higher, actual production
 levels (see figure 1). The priority areas for economic
 development remain much the same as in the Sixth
 Plan-energy, transportation, and technology-but
 the issues have changed dramatically. For the Sixth
 Plan, national leaders debated purely economic issues
 such as the rate of investment, consumer needs, and
 the relative growth of heavy and light industry. For
 the Seventh Plan, debate over such economic targets
 appears to have been relegated to lower level officials,
 leaving the top leadership free to discuss the broader
 political and ideological issues.

 Guidelines for Decisionmaking, as Outlined
 in the Seventh Five-Year Plan
 1) Give priority to reform and make sure that reform
 and development are adapted to and promote each
 other.
 2) Keep a basic balance between demand and supply,
 and try to balance state budgets and foreign
 exchange.
 3) Give top priority to improving productivity and
 especially product quality, and correctly handle the
 relations between productivity and growth rates and
 between quality and quantity.
 4) Further rationalize the industrial structure to keep
 pace with the people's changing demand patterns and
 with the modernization of the economy.
 5) Keep total investment in fixed assets within proper
 limits; rationalize investment patterns; and accelerate
 the development of the energy, transport, telecom-
 munications, and raw and semifinished materials
 industries.
 6) Shift the emphasis of development to the techno-
 logical transformation, renovation, and expansion of
 existing enterprises, and have them expand chiefly by
 increasing productivity.
 7) Attach strategic importance to the advance of
 science and education, promote scientific and techno-
 logical progress, and accelerate the development of
 intellectual resources.
 8) Open wider to the outside world and better link the
 development of the domestic economy to expanded
 economic and technological exchange with other
 countries.
 9) Further improve the material and cultural lives of
 both urban and rural residents on the basis of
 increased production and higher productivity.
 10) Promote the cultural and ideological advance of
 socialist society while furthering its material
 progress.
 11) In all efforts to build the country, maintain the
 Chinese tradition of hard work and thrift.
 increase by creating more economic competition
 among enterprises and by encouraging them to form
 lateral relationships-such as subcontracting-with
 other enterprises. Beijing is allowing enterprises to
 carry out experiments with bonuses and other incen-
 tives for individual workers, including issuing workers
 stock in their enterprise. Excerpts from the Plan
 indicate that Beijing will proceed without experimen-
 tation on some measures, including the devolution of
 state-owned enterprises. With the exception of a few
 strategic government departments and industries-
 such as defense and energy-all ministries, provinces,
 and autonomous regions must turn their enterprises
 over to departments and municipalities. Vice Premier
 Li Peng told a June 1986 national conference on the
 machine-building industry that, after the national
 ministry had divested itself of its enterprises, munici-
 palities and departments would devolve the ones they
 currently operate to lower level administrative units.
 It is not clear, however, how much of this devolution is
 scheduled during the first stage of the Plan.
 Parallel to the reform of enterprises in the first
 stage-and essential to the success of this reform-
 the plan calls for further development of macroeco-
 nomic "levers" with which to control the economy.
 Some levers are currently being improved, such as
 bankruptcy laws and central banking reforms, and
 more are to be undertaken during the plan's final two
 stages of reform.
 The Plan states that in the second stage of reform,
 originally scheduled to begin this year or in 1988, the
 role of state mandatory planning will be further
 reduced, with state quotas and regulations dropped
 wherever possible. Macroeconomic levers are to be
 improved in the tax, financial, and monetary systems,
 and the first stages of price reform are to be undertak-
 en. Prices are also to be used as a "lever" to encourage
 production in all but a limited number of "strategic
 commodities."

 During the third and final stage of reform, as outlined
 only vaguely in the Plan, Beijing will concentrate on
 placing enterprises under the proper authorities (pre-
 sumably downward divestitures), removing barriers
 between departments and regions, and separating the
 functions of government and enterprises.
 Major Projects
 The excerpts from the Plan call for 925 major capital
 construction projects.' The number is somewhat mis-
 leading, however, as at least 60 percent are continua-
 tions of long-term projects, and only 450 of the
 projects are to be completed during the plan period
 (see figure 2).
 figure 3).
 Following an uncontrolled 40-percent jump in capital
 construction expenditures in 1985, the Plan sets the
 goal of limiting expenditures to 500 billion yuan (US
 $135 billion), still almost 50 percent more than capital
 construction during the previous plan. Beijing is com-
 mitted to using the first two years to slow capital
 construction expenditures and to improve the alloca-
 tion of funds to the key sectors of the economy.

 increase over the Sixth Plan, rising from 34 to 37
 percent of total capital construction expenditures (see

 Noticeably absent from the Plan is the giant Three
 Gorges Dam hydroelectric project, which many for-
 eign observers expected to be included. The Chinese-
 owned Hong Kong paper Ta Kung Pao has reported
 that "preparatory work" for the project will be com-
 pleted during the Plan, but other reporting suggests
 that the final decision on the project and its timing
 has yet to be made.

 The Plan includes initiating the first phase of a
 massive project to divert water from the Chang Jiang
 (Yangtze River) to the North China Plain. Although
 the project has been under consideration for over 30
 years and an eastern route along the Grand Canal was
 officially approved three years ago, it has received
 little attention in the Chinese press. In recent discus-
 sions with Chinese officials, US researchers learned
 that a western route for the project, which had earlier
 been discarded because it requires that water be
 elevated by the Three Gorges Dam, is again under
 consideration. All-out construction on the eastern
 route may be awaiting the decision on the Three
 Gorges project. Completing even the eastern route
 along the Grand Canal-without a dam-would re-
 quire pumping water up 40 meters over a 1,150-
 kilometer route and crossing the Yellow River, greatly
 straining China's budget and engineering skills.

 Regional Targets
 The Plan divides the country into three economic
 regions, with only slight boundary changes from those
 outlined in the Sixth Plan, and places more emphasis
 on economic cooperation within each region (see
 figure 4). By encouraging regions to produce different
 goods, China is further retreating from the Maoist
 Because resources are generally allocated by province,
 past regional projects have usually met with redtape,
 mismanagement, and a lack of coordination. These
 roadblocks may well remain; although the major
 targets of each region have been announced, the
 mechanism to improve intraregional cooperation is
 noticeably missing from the highlights of the plan.
 Military
 Defense spending during the Plan is forecast to reach
 102 billion yuan (US $28 billion), including 20 billion
 yuan for capital construction, research, and engineer-
 ing. This annual increase of roughly 3 percent in
 defense spending stands in sharp contrast to total
 government expenditures, which are projected to rise
 four times as fast over the period, and continues the       25X1
 trend devoting a declining portion of state budgetary
 resources to the armed forces.' Some savings for the
 ' China's announced budget reflects the overall trends but not the
 full extent of its defense spending. We estimate actual annual
 military expenditures are approximately twice as large as the

 ganization of the PLA, which calls for retiring older
 ships, aircraft, and officers, as well as reducing forces
 and streamlining administration. Defense industries
 may also obtain some financial help from self-gener-
 ated funds, both through international arms exports
 and domestic sales of consumer goods. Defense indus-
 tries are currently undergoing reforms that encourage
 the production of civilian goods with the goal of being
 profitable. Savings and profits from all of these
 activities will probably be plowed back into new

 Quality of Life
 The textj states bluntly that economic growth between
 and within economic regions will proceed at different
 rates, causing disparities in income. Under the goal of
 increasing the prosperity of all the people, Beijing is
 encouraging a more direct link between income and
 productivity, accepting widening gaps in income, and
 at the same time adopting progressive income taxes
 and other measures to ensure that the gaps do not

 Chinese newspaper and journal articles are increas-
 ingly referring to the need to improve living standards
 to create the proper environment for carrying out
 reform, and the plan shows ambitious goals for im-
 proving the quality of life. In addition to the goals for
 wages and consumption and the production targets
 (see appendix and table 1), the plan calls for improve-
 ments in drinking water supplies, construction of 650
 million square meters of urban housing, and rapid
 increases in residential central heating systems and
 We believe the target for 6.7-percent average annual
 growth in the gross value of industrial and agricultur-
 al output (GVIAO) is feasible and will allow the
 Chinese to reach the overall modernization goal-set
 at the 12th Party Congress in 1982-of doubling 1980
 output by 1990. The goal of increasing the gross
 national product by 7.5 percent annually should be

 viewed with caution, however, because China's meth-

 bearing little resemblance to the Western concept of 25X1

 Although the overall average growth rates will proba-
 bly be reached, we believe it unlikely that economic
 growth during the period will be steady, as called for
 in the plan document. As with the implementation of
 past reforms, those outlined in the current plan will
 probably cause swings in production as officials seek
 the right mix of incentives and regulations.

 Furthermore, we believe some targets will be difficult
 to reach. Industry's target of 7.5-percent annual
 growth is, in our opinion, more likely to be surpassed
 by light than heavy industry (see table 2). The urban
 reform program promulgated in late 1984 has made
 little progress in reforming heavy industry, and we
 view its problems as long term and difficult to resolve:
 ? Poorly trained and uneducated managers.
 ? Inefficient allocation of resources because of irratio-
 nal prices.
 ? Low labor mobility.
 ? Lack of a nationwide social security system to
 provide for displaced workers.
 ? Few penalties for inefficient production, such as
 through bankruptcy laws and bank regulations on
 lending.
 Because many of the one-time gains in agricultural
 productivity from adopting the peasant responsibility
 system have probably occurred, we expect the growth
 in agricultural output, which fueled overall economic
 growth during the early 1980s, to slow and pull down
 overall growth rates. The most rapidly growing sector
 of the agricultural economy will continue to be the
 rural industrial sector; total agricultural production is
 targeted at 6-percent annual growth, but the goal for
 agricultural growth without village industries is only
 4 percent.
 We believe that the goal of providing 145 million jobs
 for new workers and peasants leaving agriculture is
 unlikely to be fulfilled. Even if Beijing could provide
 jobs in the industrial and service sectors to gainfully
 employ that number, it is unlikely that it will have to;
 a study by the US Bureau of the Census, based on
 Chinese population data, indicates that at most only
 85 million new jobs will be required. This apparent
 inconsistency between Chinese planning for labor and
 population may result in better conditions than Beij-
 ing is expecting in a number of areas:
 ? Lower unemployment figures.
 ? Fewer problems resettling peasants outside large
 urban areas.
 ? Fewer jobs that have to be created in the service and
 industrial sectors.
 The Plan's energy production targets are low in
 anticipation of the slower growth in production that
 has occurred in the last year (see table 3). The planned
 average annual growth in energy production during
 the period falls short of the planned 6.7-percent
 growth in the overall economy, and is well below the
 1985 energy growth rate. And although some in-
 creased efficiency in the use of energy is likely, the
 supply of energy will remain well below demand
 throughout the plan period.

 reaches the Plan goal.
 We also expect transportation to remain a major
 constraint on economic growth through the plan
 period (see table 4). Transportation goals call for total
 freight tonnage carried to increase 8 percent annually
 and thus outpace overall economic growth. This goal
 of tonnage transported is more impressive than it
 appears because as the economy develops the type of
 goods handled will increase in volume faster than
 weight. In any case, China's transportation sector will
 be, in our judgment, unable to meet demand even if it
 We believe the general thrust of the Plan bodes well
 for US-Chinese economic relations, although some
 increase in trade frictions is likely. In order to reach
 Plan goals of an 8-percent-per-year increase in ex-
 ports and for a 6-percent increase annually in imports,
 for example, China will try to expand exports of
 textiles, coal, and grain. Chinese sales of coal and
 grain will be in direct competition with US sales, and
 textiles will continue to cause trade frictions as China
 attempts to expand its sales to the United States. We
 believe Beijing will also try to diversify its exports into
 light manufactured goods, many of which will com-
 pete with products from US firms, as well as with
 those of US allies in East Asia, which are already
 experiencing a slowdown in their export growth. We
 believe that the proposal to use prices and customs
 duties to encourage the production of export goods
 illustrates that Beijing plans to press exports to the
 West. The number of trade complaints filed by
 China's trading partners is therefore likely to increase
 over the period. At the same time, we believe Chinese
 purchases of consumer goods will be constrained by
 Beijing's efforts to conserve foreign exchange and
 protect domestic industries.
 US firms selling advanced technologies and equip-
 ment, however, will benefit from the Plan. China
 generally views US technology as the world's best,
 and we believe that particularly good opportunities
 exist for sales of US equipment and technology in a
 number of areas:
 ? Electronics, especially computers and integrated
 circuits.
 ? Telecommunications.
 ? Energy-related equipment.
 ? Food processing.
 ? Transportation.
 ? Water conservancy projects.
 We expect that US sales opportunities will be slow in
 coming, however, particularly through the end of this
 year, while Beijing is concentrating on controlling
 expenditures and while leadership issues remain un-
 settled. China's foreign exchange reserves dropped       25X1
 sharply in 1985 as the plan was being prepared (see
 figure 5).? Moreover, the decline in oil prices and the
 growing Western concern about limiting imports of
 Chinese textiles are undoubtedly causing the charac-
 teristically conservative Chinese to be even more
 concerned about bringing foreign exchange reserves
 ' This drop led to a recalculation of foreign exchange reserves in
 mid-1985 to include holdings of foreign government securities,

 Appendix A
 Major Goals of the Seventh
 Five-Year Plan (1986-90)
 Agriculture. The gross value of agricultural output to
 reach 353 billion yuan (in 1980 prices), an annual
 average growth of 4 percent (or 6 percent if the output
 value of village industries is included). State invest-
 ment to increase, with emphasis on infrastructural
 facilities, including weather forecasting. New forests
 to cover 27.7 million hectares, increasing China's total
 afforested area to 14 percent. See table 1 for food
 production goals.
 Economic Efficiency. International standards are to
 be adopted for major products. The energy required to
 produce 10,000 yuan of national income should be
 11.4 metric tons of standard coal, down from the 1985
 figure of 12.9 tons. Labor productivity to rise by an
 average of 3.8 percent annually.
 Banking. Total state credit available to increase by
 474.5 billion yuan over the five years. Credit mainly
 to be used for the operating expenses of industrial and
 commercial enterprises, agriculture, and investment
 in fixed assets.
 Budget. A balanced state budget of 256.7 billion yuan
 of state revenues and expenditures in 1990, or a total
 of 1,119.4 billion yuan of each over the entire plan.
 An average annual increase of 8 percent for educa-
 tion, science, culture, public health, and sports. "Prop-
 er limits" will be put on the growth of expenditures
 for capital construction, national defense, and admin-
 istration. See also figure 2.
 Consumption. Total consumption funds for the five
 years set at 3,007 billion yuan. Per capita annual
 consumption of 517 yuan ($140 at current exchange
 rates) by 1990, an average annual increase of 5
 percent (4.2 percent for urban residents and 5.1 for
 rural residents). Output of consumer goods to increase
 40 percent, with major output targets as listed in table
 1. Sales of consumer goods to increase 8.7 percent
 annually to reach 574 billion yuan in 1990. The
 number of retail stores, restaurants, and service shops
 is to double to 25 million.
 Culture. Literature and art to support the current
 economic reforms and the drive for modernization.
 Film, radio, and TV industries to improve quality
 before increasing quantity-radiobroadcasting to
 reach 80 percent of population, TV to reach 75
 percent. Publications to increase roughly 50 percent
 by 1990. A total of about 700 major cultural and
 historical sites under state protection by 1990.
 Economic Zones. Three regions for economic develop-
 ment are created. (See figure 4.) Development plan-
 ning is to occur at three levels-between provinces,
 intraprovincial, and city.
 Education. Nine-year compulsory education system to
 be introduced gradually. By 1990, students in voca-
 tional and technical schools to increase by 65 percent,
 undergraduate students to increase by 21 percent, and
 postgraduate students by 17 percent. Full-time adult
 education and part-time training for cadres, workers,
 and peasants to expand.
 Foreign Exchange. More to be earned through export,
 an increased proportion to be earned from sources
 other than trade, adequate reserves to be maintained,
