 Briefly Noted
 13 March 1961
 1.  Ehrenburg on Humanism: In a broadcast marking his seventieth
 birthday, Ilya Ehrenburg, the well-known Soviet writer, stated: "Soviet society
 is engaged in a fight against a world based on the principle of material gain, on
 the rule of money. We must win not only through the perfection of our machines,
 through our cosmic travels, through prosperity, but also through our spiritual
 flights and the quality of human feelings, through beauty and inspiration. "
 When the first man reached the moon, said Mr. Ehrenburg, the importance would
 lie not only in the fact of his having been able to arrive but in what kind of a man
 he was and what kind of spiritual resources he brought with him. Ehrenburg
 spoke scathingly of the banality of much Soviet art which he likened to fifth-rate
 colored photographs in splendid frames, " incapable of inspiring young Russians
 with love, duty, loyalty or highmindedness. "The fact that these pictures portray
 a pleasant-looking farmer in a semi-worsted suit instead of a stern-looking
 Marshal in dress uniform, does not constitute art. " "Everyone knows, " said
 Ehrenburg, "that the Fascists had to be removed; everyone understands that
 peace is essential but now that the building of a new society is almost completed
 and we have to think of how people should Mve in it, things become a bit more
 complicated. " We should publicize Ehrenburg's statements in intellectual circles,
 contrasting them with the actual situation in the Soviet Union and other
 Communist countries. We quote them to bloc intellectuals both as an example to
 be emulated and as a justification for similar assertions on their part.
 2.  Ehrenburg on Pasternak:  According to a Reuters despatch from
 Moscow, dated 1 March 1961, Ilya Ehrenburg defended Boris Pasternak in an
 article published in the magazine Noui Mir (New World), breaking a two-year
 Soviet silence on Pasternak. New World, organ of the Soviet Writers Union,
 published a five page extract from Ehrenburg's new autobiography.  In it
 Ehrenburg stated he was convinced that Pasternak did not intend "to bring
 damage to his country" through Doctor Zhivago.  Ehrenburg added the book
 contains "wonderful verses" and concluded "you cannot  push Pasternak's verses
 away from the world.  They live. " (See Bi-Weekly #56, 31 January 1961,
 Item #349.)
 3.  Japan Pays Full Share of UN Congo Expenses: On 7 March the
 Kyodo News Agency Tokyo reported that the Japanese government had decided
 to pay its full share of expenses for the UN Congo expedition, waiving its
 privilege of receiving a 50% reduction.  We shouldnole this further indication of
 Asian dedication to the maintenance of the UN.  Coupled with India's decision to
 supply troops for the Congo, this makes clear the fact that.-Soviet determination
 to undermine the UN will mee t strong resistence.  (See Bi-Weekly #56, 2 Januarl:
 1961, Item #332. )

 rouna:  L'n t' r ebruary, at the opening session of the Indian
 Parliament, President Rajendra Prasad accused Peiping of "intransigence" and
 said: "We firmly hold that frontiers between India and China have been for long
 well established by treaties, custom, and usage. " He insisted that India could not
 accept the "results of unilateral action or decisions taken by China. " After he had
 spoken, Prime Minister Nehru presented parliament with a detailed document
 prepared by the Indian Government, 567 pages in length and containing the
 evidence and conclusions of six months of negotiations about their border dispute
 between Indian and Chicom officials. The report was accompanied by a thirteen-
 page statement by the Indian Foreign Office defending New Delhi's stand on the
 border issue. This statement. asserted that the talks had established "beyond
 doubt" the traditional 22, 500-mile long boundary between India and Communist
 China as shown on Indian maps. It charged that the Chicoms were in "unlawful
 occupation of about 12, 000 square miles of Indian territory. " This territory is in
 the Ladakh area of Kashmir on the Indian side of the India-Pakistan cease-fire
 line. (Peiping has claimed, in all, about 50, 000 square miles of Indian territory.
 The lengthy Indian Government report brought out, among other things, the
 following points: India contends that there really is no border dispute because the
 boundary has been well defined and is supported by treaties, geography, and
 cu stom. India further maintains that the border runs along a natural watershed
 and that the Chicoms never even raised any question about it until 1959. Peiping's
 assertion, as reported by the Indian Government, is that no treaty exists between
 New Delhi and Peiping defining the border. (Peiping has also blamed British
 "imperialism" for having left the border question behind them when they departed
 from the Indian sub-continent.) The report also brought out two further points:
 it claimed that Peiping refused to accept India's treaty relations with the
 Himalayan principalities of Sikkim and Bhutan (Sikkim is an Indian protectorate:
 India also, while not interfering in the internal affairs of Bhutan, does control its
 defense and foreign relations); the Chicoms also reportedly refused to discuss
 with the Indians the border between Sinkiang and the part of Kashmir now
 occupied by Pakistan.

 se Claims to Korea as an Inter-al Part of China
 Background: Since the thirteenth century,  orea, as we
 lands now bordering on China proper, paid tribute to China. It was through this
 imperial system that the Chinese developed their concept of the Empire and it is
 largely from these old relationships that the Communists derive their territorial
 claims today. Among the numerous areas over which China lost control in the
 nineteenth century was Korea, which was occupied by Japan in 1895 and which
 remained under the:.control of the Japanese until 1945.
 Mao Tse-tung set himself the task of remaking China, of reestablishing
 Chinese power and prestige and of regaining Chinese = Eontrol over the old
 imperial boundaries by the application of pressure and, if necessary, by the use
 of armed force. Hardly a year after taking over power in China, Mao Tse-tung
 invaded Tibet (October 1950) and only a few weeks later dispatched "volunteers"
 into Korea. Had he succeeded in defeating the Koreans, Korea - like Tibet - woul(
 today be part and parcel of the Chinese People's Republic. Proof of this lies in
 Mao's own claim, which he made in 1939, that scores of "national minorities",
 including the Koreans, are fundamentally Chinese and belong rightfully to China.
 (Mao Tse-tung in "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party"
 published in Chinese, 15 November 1939.)
 Although the 1931 constitution of the Chinese Soviet Republic stated that,
 "the Soviet Government of China recognizes the right of self-determination of the
 national minorities in China, their right to complete separation from China, and
 the formation of an independent state for each national minority.... all Koreans
 and others living on the territory of China shall enjoy the full right of self-
 determination"; the constitution of 1954 changed all this and provides that, "the
 Chinese People's Republic ig a unified national state... in areas where the people
 of the national minorities live in numbers, regional autonomy applie a... all the
 areas of the national autonomy are inseparable parts of the Chinese People's
 Republic. " The situation in Tibet provides an all too real example of the fate of
 so-called autonomous regions.
 The Handbook of People's China, official guide to the Communist
 government operations, lists the Koreans among the most populous of the 64
 ethnic groups which are scattered over more than 60% of the Chinese mainland. A
 special department, the Nationality Affairs Commission, was established in 1952
 to communize and supervise the minority communities.
 Background: On 4 March 1861 (19 February Old Style), Czar Alexander
 II issued an imperial decree, ending all serfdom in Russia, the last country in
 Europe to have the institution. As in Prussia 50 years before, emancipation was
 largely a consequence of military defeat, in this case in the Crimean War.,
 Liberation led to striking changes in Russian institutions, and it, rather than the
 October Revolution, launched Russia on the path-. of modern development.
 Unfortunately, it was an incomplete liberation. The peasants' attitude had been
 that although they belonged to the landlord, the land belonged to them, But the
 liberation only gave them part of the land, and they had to repay the landlords for
 that part, at exaggerated prices, so that the landlords retained for forty-four
 years a measure of control over them. Henceforth they dreamed of a "black
 division" of the landlords' lands, which in their eyes had been "cut off. " This
 felt injustice was one side of the Russian agrarian problem; the other, of which
 the peasants were largely unaware, was that since the communes (mirs) continued
 to farm with the traditional communal system, in which each peasant worked
 scattered narrow strips under the super.ision of the Elder of the mir and the mir
 council, there remained a serious brake on agricultural progress and efficiency.
 Some peasants began to shake off the mir's control and to develop
 concentrated farms (rather than strips) with secure tenure, and in the later
 Czarist period, this tendency was actively encouraged by the Minister Stolypin.
 By 1915, almost half the farms had become hereditary and non-communal, and
 Lenin feared that Stolypin's efforts to create a peasant bourgeoisie would succeed.
 But the war set the stage for a "black division" in 1917, with the Bolsheviks jump-
 ing on the bandwagon by endorsing peasant land seizure. The White forces never
 had much of a chance, since the peasants feared that if the Whites succeeded, the
 landlords would return. The old strip farming was doomed in any case, but the
 evolution before 1917 and after the Civil War was in the direction of larger, more
 concentrated, mechanized, private farms, with the poorer peasants working as
 hired hands or moving to the cities. Government measure s, such as the extension
 of low-interest loans, might have minimized such undesirable accompanying
 phenomena as Kulak usury. But the trend was intolerable for the Communists, not
 so much because of social inequalities (although this was the argument used), as
 because it meant the firm establishment of private property and even capitalism
 on the land, and the existence of free peasants who would only surrender their
 produce in return for goods. Collectivization, applied after 1928, solved one old
 problem by conclusively eliminating the strips, but it revived another old problem
 by taking all the peasants' land away (except, as a concession after initial difficul-
 ties, the time-honored private gardens). Nominally there is collective ownership
 by all, but since every farm has high quatas to meet, the peasants are in effect
 serfs of the regime, whose only land is their gardens, repeatedly threatened with
 seizure. In typical Communist fashion, all local opponents of collectivization were
 stigmatized as Kulaks; this broke resistance, but crippled farming thereafter. Asi
 Aside from the inju3,ce involved in effectively seizing peasant lands, collectivi-
 zation removed incentive from farming; as one expert has stated, the problem of
 providing incentives is "the major impediment to the efficient functioning of the

 Kolkhoz system. " This problem has in some respects grown worse with the
 amalgamation of farms in the $fifties, placing more of the work in the hands of
 large brigades. The peasants, drawing on centuries of experience, try to
 circumvent the arbitrary system, with such typical results as the fact that in
 1960, roughly half of the Soviet meat, milk and vegetable production came from
 the tiny private plots and private cattle.

 Background; While military forces within the USSR were reduced during
 the first year of Khrushchev's "demobilization program", manpower of the Soviet
 forces in East Europe (Poland, Hungary and East Germany has been maintained
 at approximately the 1959 level and the over-all effectiveness of the Soviet
 command increased.
 The strength of Soviet Group Forces in Germany includes a. total of
 approximately 336, 000 troops.  Specifically: Motorized Rifle Divisions ? 14
 ank 1 3.visions - 10; Heavy Tanks - 1, 120; Medium Tanks - 4, 600; Artillery
 Piecea'? 5, 800; Jet Fighters - 524; Jet Light Bombers - 112.
 Northern Group Forces (Poland) include a total of approximately 44, 000
 troops.. Specifically;  Motorized Rifle Divisions - 1; Tank Divisions - 1; Heavy
 Tanks - 95; Medium Tanks - 475; Artillery Pieces 225; Jet Fighters - 308; Jet
 Light Bombers.. 000.
 Southern Group Forces (Hungary) include a total of approximately 65, 000
 Troops.  Specifically; Motorized Rifle Divisions - 1;-Tank Divisions - 3; Heavy
 Tanks ,- 285; Medium Tanks - 980; Artillery Pieces - 420; Jet Fighters - 216;
 Jet Light Bombers - 60.
 Not only were no line units disbanded ortransferred, but the forces have
 been strengthened by the continued introduction of improved-tanks, guns and air-
 craft.              Soviet units in East Europe are highly trained, well_.quipp.  +Mwev-9,
 maintained at a higher level of combat capability than the Soviet average and
 relatively immune to the short-term fluctuations in policy that affect Soviet forces
 elsewhere.   In East Germany, such troops constitute an armored striking force
 with appropriate infantry,  artillery and tactical air components.  They are well
 organized and equipped to conduct either offensive action into Western Europe or
 a mobile defense of their own area.  In Hungary, the recent conversion of a Soviet
 rifle division to a tank division suggest that the forces there are no longer serving
 primarily as an occupation force (their function since the 1956 Revolt).  This
 command, by its present composition and disposition, forms a southward extension
 of the forces in Germany and increases Soviet capability for ground combat against
 Central Europe and the Mediterranean area.  Soviet forces in Poland are organized
 to protect Soviet communication routes across that country.  Soviet tactical fir
 elements in East Germany, Poland and Hungary have increased their combat
 capability through the acquisition of new cla.sses of fighters and through..improve-
 ments in support and weapons systems.  Training of both the ground and air

 Communist Party between Maurice Thorez, the 61-year-old Secretary General,
 and his trusted lieutenants and close associates, Laurent Casanova and Marcel
 Servin. Casanova was the Politburo member responsible for the ideological
 direction of intellectuals, he had been a supporter and friend of Thorez for many
 years, he received the Lenin Peace Prize in December 1960. Marcel Servin, who
 was also a member of the Politburo and in charge of party organization, had once
 been secretary to Thorez. Others involved include: Maurice Kriegel-Valrimont,
 Central Committee mernbex, former National Assembly Deputy and, until the
 summer of 1960, editor-in-chief of the party weekly France Nouvelle; Madame
 Claudine Chomat, wife of Casanova and Central Committee member; Jean
 Pronteau, Central Committee member and former Deputy; Andre Souquiere,
 Central Committee member, former Senator and member of the Council of the
 Republic and a former secretary to Thorez; Jean Kanapa, Central Committee
 member, writer and philosopher and former editor-in-chief of La Nouvelle
 Critique; Jean-Pierre Vigier, Central Committee member, writer and research
 director of the National Center for Scientific Research,
 On 24 February, it was announced that both Casanova and Servin had
 been dropped from the Politburo and that Servin had also been relieved of his
 duties as chief of the organization section. The immediate cause of the dispute is
 their disagreement with the total opposition of Thorez to De Gaulle's Algerian
 policy. Servin and Casanova have argued that the brunt of the party's attack
 should be directed at French rightists rather than against De Gaulle personally,
 whom they regard as the leader of the "liberal" faction of the bourgeoisie. Thorez
 on the other hand, prefers to see De Gaulle as the head of a regime of
 "nationalist demogogy, " controlled by the "monopolies" and pursuing policies
 leading to fascism. The deviation charge developed from the disagreement over
 the French CP's decision to vote "no" in the January referendum on De Gaulle's
 Algerian policy. Casanova was charged with refusing to establish in the French
 peace movement a network of committees for peace in Algeria. -Actually, the
 charges of "opportunism and deviationism, " are based on long-.standing
 differences, including - in addition to those concerning the Algerian War - the
 question of how to interpret the principle of "proletarian internationalism, "
 internal contradictions in the French bourgeoisie, the question of "united front"
 tactics. The action taken against these senior party officials may also represent
 an attempt by Thorez to put them in a position where they would have little
 chance of succeeding to the leadership after his demise. The Central Committee
 meeting of 23-24 February also criticized Kriegel- Valrimont for his "thoroughly
 opportunistic assessments" of the nature of the "contradictions among the
 imperialists. (
 What measures, if any, the party has taken against other members of
 the group is not known. Of those listed so far, only S ouquiere has recanted. The

 Casanova is evident among lower party echelons and Thorez apparently fears that
 more serious disciplinary action might provoke large-scale defections. Servin
 and Casanova claim that Thorez by his rigidity and intransigeance in opposing
 De Gaulle, has caused the Communist leadership to lose touch with the Party rank
 and file. The party's condemnation of De Gaulle's self-determination policy for
 Algeria in September 1959 constituted a serious tactical error. Once this policy
 hid been well received by the FLN in Algeria and had been approved by
 Khrushchev himself, Thorez was obliged to make a public volte-face which made
 the entire party look ridiculous.
 Future developments within the French Communist Party cannot be
 forecast as yet. For the mment, Servin and Casanova remain in the party as
 Central Committee members. How much influence they can bring to bear on policy
 and to what extent they can develop support for their positions remains to be seen.
 It is unlikely, however, that Thorez can continue indefinitely to ignore the conse-
 quence s of a revolt which has its roots in the attitude of the Party rank and file. 25X1 C10b

 Background: The December 1960 issue of World Marxist Review, widely
 disseminated English-language edition of Problems of Peace and Socialism, the
 authoritative, theoretical publication of the world Communist movement sponsored
 by the CPSU with the assistance of most other Communist Parties and issued in
 Russian and at least twenty other languages, contains an article entitled: "The
 Reign of Terror in the United Arab Republic. " 'Beginning with the statement that
 "The reactionaries have launched a violent offensive against democratic freedoms
 and civil rights in the UAR and especially in its Syrian region, " it goes on to
 denounce the "reign of terror" launched in the UAR with police brutality that
 "surpasses the horrors of the inquisition. " The article is signed by one "Said
 Mahmoud" but may or may not have been written by Khaled Bakdash, former
 leader of the Communist Party in Syria, who fled the country when it joined
 Egypt to form the UAR, Bakdash is now out of the UAR 's reach in Communist
 territory, either in Prague or Moscow. One possible clue pointing to this
 conclusion is that the same issue of World Marxist Review contains another
 article entitled "We Will Build a National Front" as advocated by "the underground
 organ" of the Central Committee of the Syrian Communist Party. Coming in fort
 special attack in the "reign of terror" article was the allegedly brutal treatment
 meted out by the UAR Security authorities after they had arrested (in Damascus)
 Farajallah Helou, Lebanese "patriot" and Secretary of the Central Committee of
 the Lebanese Communist Party. "The group that questioned Helou, " the paper
 reports, "consisted of thirty men devoid of conscience and experienced in the
 art of interrogation. " Helou,  " it said, "was stripped naked and flogged until his
 body turned into bleeding pulp, then cold water was thrown over him and the
 beating resumed. " The article points out that, contrary to what the UAR
 authorities claim, "the police persecute workers, peasants, students, trade
 unionists, writers and journalists who are remote from Communism. " This
 article, which contains still more accounts of "terror, lawlessness and despotism,"
 is directed toward audiences in a country which maintains substantial cultural con-
 tacts with the Soviet Union, and which both receives economic aid (such as the
 construction of the High Dam at Aswan), and looks to the USSR for military
 material of many sorts.
 The allegations of police brutality in the UAR are perhaps best
 understood in the context of the Moscow Declaration of 6 December 1960, which
 was issued by the world conference of representatives of Communist parties.
 This document stated: "On behalf of all Communists cf the world, the conference
 expresses feelings of proletarian solidarity with those who are languishing in
 prison torture chambers, the glorious sons and daughters of the working class,
 and the 'democrats of the United States, Spain, Portugal, Japan, West Germany,
 Greece, Iran, Pakistan, the UA.R, Jordan, Iraq, Argentina, Paraguay, the
 Dominican Republic, Mexico, the Union of South Africa, Sudan, and other
 countries. " The charges against the TUTAR show that Communist propagandists
 were quick to carry out the new directive. However the Communist propagandists,
 attack has not been limited to the UAR. At one of t e Co 1      paithe Latin

 Council in Mexico City during the first week of March 1961, a special report was
 presented on political prisoners in Mexico. (See also Item 355 of Bi-Weekly
 Propaganda Guidance, Issue #60, dated 27Februaryl961, for recent attacks
 against the government of Iraq.) It is interesting to note that the UAR, Iraq, and
 Mexico were specifically named in the statement quoted above, in addition to the
 more usual targets of Communist propaganda attack. Apparently, the new ...
 directive is designed to provide a convenient theme for attacking any regime,
 including those who seek to have good relations with Moscow, whenever it suits the
 Communists to do so.
