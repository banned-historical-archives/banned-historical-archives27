 in interviewing                      a Cuban defector who Sourwine believes has
 valuable information on certain U. S. citizen dealings with North Vietnam.
 I told Sourwine we would check and be back in touch.  (Yesterday, Al Tarabochia,
 of the Subcommittee, staff, alerted             of possible Subcommittee     25X1
 interest. )

 Subcommittee on Internal Security,  called and asked if we had any objections
 to public use of the translation we provided on 22 December of the 16 December
 Red Star attack on Senator Eastland.    He said the article would be "water on
 the wheel" for the Senator.  I told Sourwine I didn't think there would be any
 problem in using just the straight text of the article, but that I would check
 and let him know if any problems exist.

 JMM)  Called Representative Philip J. Philbin at his
 home in Massachusetts to explain our problem with the Civil Service
 Commission in connection with the transfer of funds provision in our
 recently passed retirement legislation.  Mr. Philbin seemed to under-
 stand the problem and assured us he would do anything within his
 power to resolve it.  He said he planned to return to Washington on
 Tuesday or Wednesday, 29 or 30 December, at which time he would
 like us to have ready for him a memo setting out the problem in
 detail.  He indicated that a statement for the record would probably
 be the best solution and that he would be glad to provide one in
 accordance with our suggestions.

 FE Division, called concerning
 1.             GLC) I
 a contact made wiLLnn him by Jim Pont, Deputy Director East Asia and
 Pacific Affairs, ISA, DOD, concerning ISA's response to an inquiry from
 Senator Fulbright about incursions in South Laos.  ISA had planned to
 include in their response a suggestion that Fulbright contact the Director
 if he wished an intelligence briefing on this area, but II had objected
 to this and I agreed with his position.         was interested, however, in
 providing Pont with the date of the Director's appearance before the Senate
 Foreign Relations Committee.  I advised        that the Director briefed
 the Committee on 28 October 1969 and was present at Ambassador Unger's
 appearance on 17 November 1969, but did not participate.
 Z.  Messrs. Houston,                   attended a meeting with
 State Department officials: Colgate Prentice, Deputy Assistant for
 Congressional Relations; Stanley Futterman, East Asian and Pacific
 Affairs; and Thomas Pickering, Deputy Director for Bureau of Politico-
 Military Affairs.  The meeting was at their request to discuss possible
 congressional action on the so-called Fulbright amendment to the Defense
 Appropriations Act.  We discussed several possible provisions which
 might come out of the House-Senate conference on the bill.  While no
 conclusions were reached, it appeared the State Department representatives
 appreciated the Agency's position with regard to some of these alternatives.
 It was agreed that we would keep in touch regarding subsequent developments
 on the bill.

 to subsection (c)(1) of section 252 of the CIA Retirement Act were
 sufficiently clear so as to authorize the Commission to transfer Govern-
 ment retirement contributions accumulated under the Civil Service retire-
 ment system to the Agency for employees transferring into the Agency's
 system, we discussed the problem with William Cook, of the House
 Armed Services Committee staff.  We discussed the alternatives of a
 letter to the Commission from the Chairman and/or a statement by one
 of the Members which would be inserted in the Congressional Record.
 It was decided that we would take this up with Frank Slatinshek when
 he returns next week.

 1.              - JGO) Met briefly with John Martiny, Chief
 Counsel, House Post Office and Civil Service Committee, who told me
 that he expects the conference report on the pay bill to clear through
 the Senate before recess.     He anticipates no difficulty on the floor of
 the House.
 2.                        - JGO) Met with Mr. Earl Morgan,
 House Armed Services Committee staff, and thanked him for his part
 in the handling of S. 4571 on the floor of the House yesterday.  Mr. Morgan
 found it somewhat fortuitous that half the time available for discussion
 of the bill was taken up in eulogies for Representative Philip J. Philbin
 (D. , Mass.) who was defeated on his bid for reelection.
 3?                          JGO)  Met with Miss Mary Swann,
 Administrative Assistant to Representative F. Edward Hebert (D. , La. ),
 and gave her a copy of the Garrison book Heritage of Stone.  Miss Swann
 told me that unless something unusual happened on the floor of the House
 Mr. Hebert may not return to the city until sometime after the first of
 the year.
 4.                  - JGO)  In response to her request of yesterday
 returned to Miss Judy Waggoner, on the staff of Senator John G. Tower
 (R. , Texas), constituent correspondence relating to employment in the
 Secret Service.
 5.                       I - JGO) Delivered to J. G. SourwineI s
 office for Sena or James      astland (D. , Miss. ) English-language text
 of the Red Star attack on Senator Eastland of 16 December, and an article by
 B. Karpovich entitled "The Neanderthal Man from Capitol Hill" together with
 Red Star items of 14 October and 15 November referring to Senator Percy.
 I left a note for Mr. Sourwine outlining the fact that Red Star's gratuitous
 personal attack on Senator Eastland in a full-scale article is unusual.

 The constituent has applied for a job with the Secret Service and was

 Central Intelligence Agency.  She thanked me for the call and requested
 that the correspondence be returned to their office.

 WH Division, has been advised.
 Mr. Tarabochia also told me that a longtime close friend, a
 a general practitioner with a flourishing
 practice in Miami, Flon a, who has a background as a naval officer and
 training in decompression work, is interested in possible Government
 service.  He was approached by the Agency many years ago but was unable
 to serve at that time.  I told Mr. Tarabochia that Agency interest in the
 Miami area at the time of the Cuban invasion related to particular on-going
 operations and that I would doubt that there would be any present need for
 similar service but that I would check the matter and be back in touch with
 him.                        DDP, has been advised.
 5.             JGO)  I received a call from Miss Dorothy Fosdick,
 Staff Director,  u committee on National Security and International
 Operations, Senate Committee on Government Operations, who asked the
 number of surface-to-surface missiles that have been put into Egypt by
 the Soviets for Senator Henry Jackson's use this afternoon.  She indicated
 that the Senator needed the information as soon as possible. After
 checking with Bruce Clarke, OSR, I told Miss Fosdick that the Egyptians
 are believed to have two battalions of samlets which would approximate
 some 50 (samlet) cruise missiles located in Alexandria and similar
 shore installations and six frog-mark 7 located in the Cairo area.  The
 frogs were identified as being present in Egypt in midsummer and the
 samlets as early as 1968.  Miss Fosdick was most appreciative.

 for   r,   ous on, I talked to Ralph Preston, House Appropriations
 Committee staff, about the press reports concerning agreements between
 Senator J. Fulbright (D. , Ark. ), Senator Michael Mansfield (D. , Mont. )
 and others with Chairman George Mahon of House Appropriations Committee.
 In brief, Mr. Preston told me it is the Chairman's position that the Senate
 should take the Defense Appropriations Bill conference report to the floor
 of the Senate and vote the measure as has been done in the House.  It
 would appear that no compromising agreements have been reached between
 the objectors in the Senate and Mr. Mahon.
 7.                    JMM)  Talked to Bill Cook, House Armed
 Services Committee staff, regarding the possibility of contacting some
 of the House "objectors" to head off any possible problems when our
 retirement legislation reaches the floor.  Cook advised against any action
 on our part, remarking that Acting Chairman Philip Philbin had told the
 Committee staff that he alone would handle the problem of the objectors.
 I mentioned to Cook that the Time article on Cienfuegos was mis-
 leading in a number of important respects and I would be glad to brief
 any of the Committee on the details if they were interested.  He said he
 saw no need for this at the moment.
 8. I         I- JMM)  Met with Ralph Preston, Staff Assistant, House
 Appropriations Committee, whom I brought up to date on recent information
 regarding Communist tactics in Vietnam, radar installations in Egypt,
 political developments in Poland, and Soviet naval activities in Cuba.
 Mr. Preston had no new information on the status of the conference
 report on the Defense Appropriations bill, but argued that it would be a
 great mistake at this stage to delete the language which had been added to
 the so-called "Fulbright amendment" at Mr. Mahon's suggestion, since to
 do so at this time would lend weight to the restrictive interpretation of the
 Fulbright amendment.

 Appropriations Committee, whom I briefed on recent information
 regarding Communist tactics in Vietnam, radar installations in Egypt,
 political developments in Poland, and Soviet naval activities in Cuba.
 Woodruff said that things were so confused now over the Appropriations
 bill that there was no telling what if anything would finally emerge before
 the end of the session.
 10. I          I- JMM)  Met with Representative John O. Marsh
 in response to his letter recommending                               U. S. Army,
 a VMI graduate, had been scheduled to escort Vice President Agnew on a
 tour of South Vietnam but when the Vice President's trip did not materialize
 he was assigned to escort Marsh. Marsh sai                who is most   25X1A
 anxious to join the Agency's paramilitary program, is known to COS
 Saigon.  I told Marsh I would look into the matter.
 as a candidate for Agency recruitment.  According to Marsh,

 with Representative Paul Rogers (D. , Fla.) to try to clean up a problem
 which Rogers apparently had with the Agency.  Actually this was the result
 of a remark of his that was misunderstood.  See Memo for Record.
 At the same time, I asked Rogers if there were any matters on
 which we could be of assistance and he asked about reports of Soviet naval
 activities in Cienfuegos.  I ran down the latest information on the subject
 explaining that the version presented in the current issue of Time con-
 siderably exaggerated the seriousness of the situation.                      25X1

 transcript of Colonel W 'te's testimony before the House Armed
 Services Committee in support of our retirement bill on 17 December.
 We corrected several errors and ambiguities in the transcript and
 added one clarifying statement.
 I also left with Mr. Slatinshek's secretary a message regarding
 our latest information on Soviet negotiations with Singapore.

 16 December and after checking with the Office of Personnel, talked
 to I                     the Agency's participant in the Congressional
 Fellowship Program, and informed him that the Agency had no record
 on                    lother than she was an applicant for the CT program
 in 1965.  I told          that if Senator McClellan is interested in
 I             application to the Agency, she should be advised to suggest
 the Senator contact the Agency directly.  He said this would cause no
 problem and based on our earlier discussion he had in effect already
 told her this.
 4.             GLC) Met with Bill Woodruff, Senate Appropriations
 Committee s a   , and brought him up to date on several current intelligence
 items including Cienfuegos, recent evaluation of Soviet MRV shots, the
 missile site in China, and the slowup of the ICBM program.
 Woodruff said that with the present situation in the Congress he
 thought it very doubtful that we would be able to make the trip to Europe
 after the first of the year.
 Woodruff mentioned that the House amendment to the Fulbright
 amendment of the Defense Appropriations bill will probably cause consider-
 able problems in the Senate and could even result in the bills going back
 to conference again.

 to Senator John C. Stennis (D. , Miss. ), called to say that the Agency
 employee in whom he had expressed interest on behalf of Senator Stennis
 had been in touch with him.  He said she had given him the impression
 that her suggestion that she retire at her present grade in six months
 was made under considerable pressure, if not duress.  Cresswell is not
 objecting to the solution to which she proposed, but suggested that she
 be given the opportunity to think the matter over during the holidays
 before making an irreparable decision.  I told Cresswell that I would
 check with the Director of Personnel to be sure this was agreeable and
 if not would let him know.  I subsequently talked with Mr. Wattles who
 said this was quite agreeable to him.

 interest in the case of an Agency employee whom they feel is being
 pressured into retirement.  The employee is well-known to the Senator
 and has asked that he arrange for her to meet with the Director.  Cresswell

 1. ~- JMM)  Ralph Preston, Staff Assistant, House
 Appropriations Committee, called to say that in the Senate-House
 conference on Saturday it appeared that they might be willing to
 accept an amendment to the Fulbright amendment which would involve
 adding to the existing language the following:
 but nothing herein will be construed to prohibit
 support of free world or local forces in actions designed
 to promote the safe and orderly withdrawal or disengage-
 ment of U.S. forces from the war in Indochina. "
 I told Preston that this language, which was almost identical to that
 proposed by the Agency, would go far toward solving our problems
 and I hoped he would pull hard to get it accepted.
 Later I discussed the above with Bill Woodruff, Counsel, Ice
 Appropriations Committee, who agreed also to work for acceptafice of
 the above language, although he said the last few words should be changed
 from " the war in Indochina" to "combat activities in Southeast Asia. "
 3. I                       I RJK)  Delivered to the offices of Senators
 Mike MansiieICL   . ,          and Allen J. Ellender (D. , La.) FBIS items

 Chairman Moss' letter of December 10.      I advised Mr. Matteson that the
 President's directive concerning public relations activities was not
 addressed to the Central Intelligence Agency and that recheck with the
 Office of Management and Budget has verified that no report on the matter
 is expected from the Central Intelligence Agency.  Mr. Matteson thanked
 me for the advice and said that a one paragraph response to Chairman
 Moss' letter advising that the subject matter of President Nixon's
 November 6 directive has no application to the Agency will be sufficient.

 no information re the case of the Lithuanian seaman who attempted to
 defect to the Coast Guard vessel.   However Westphal said the Committee
 did have a problem in that some personal effects of this man which had been
 left on the Coast Guard vessel, including some of his notes, had been classi-
 fied by the Coast Guard.  Westphal said the Committee wanted this material
 presented in open session of the Committee on Monday, and wondered whether
 its classification had been at the Agency's insistence.  After checking with
 CDC staff, I called Westphal to say that we saw no need for
 this material to be classified and had so informed the Coast Guard.

 had another commitment and Colonel White will appear before the full
 Committee in support of our retirement legislation on 16 December.
 Slatinshek said that unfortunately he had already sent out a notice to
 the Committee members indicating the Director himself would appear,
 and he assumed that if Colonel White appeared in his stead we could
 explain the Director's unavailability.
 Slatinshek said a Democratic caucus was scheduled for 0830 on the
 morning of the 16th and therefore he had rescheduled our appearance for
 10:30 a. m.  He said even this time. might have to be slipped back if the
 caucus was delayed.

 Chairman Rivers had come through the operation satisfactorily.

 Mr. Preston said he had just come from a meeting between
 Secretary Laird and Chairman Mahon in which the Chairman asked
 Laird why Defense had not objected to the Fulbright amendment in
 their reclama to the Defense Appropriations bill.  Laird said he had
 not wanted to formally object but he thought this amendment should be
 deleted since it apparently caused some problems for CIA.  Preston
 told me that Mahon agreed that the Fulbright amendment was undesirable
 and would probably oppose it in conference, but Preston thought it would
 be well for the Director to let the Chairman know firsthand about our
 problem with this amendment.  I passed this suggestion on to the
 Director.

 later in 1971 and possibly two pay increases in 1972 when the proposed pay

 7. 0 JMM) Accompanied                          Chief FE,
 to meet with Richard Moose, of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee
 staff, where we reviewed the draft report on Cambodia prepared by Moose
 and Jim Lowenstein, of the Committee staff, on the basis of their recent
 trip to Southeast Asia.  Moose readily agreed to excise from the published
 version of this report those few passages which we thought might create
 security problems.  (See Memo for the Record)
 8. ~- JMM)  Met with Senator Milton Young (R., N. Dak), whom
 I briefed on recent intelligence items regarding the situation in Cambodia,
 new information on ChiCom strategic missiles, Soviet naval activity in Cuba,
 Soviet air and naval activity in the Middle East, and Soviet ICBM deployment.
 In response to Senator Young's question I said the Son Tay operation
 was strictly a Defense Department responsibility.

 latest figures on    e overall picture" in Southeast Asia, so far as combat
 strength was concerned.  He said he would like figures on North Vietnamese,
 Vietcong and any other active Communist forces in South Vietnam, Cambodia,
 and Laos, and also figures on friendly forces in these areas.  I said he
 should go to the Pentagon for the latter but we would be glad to provide
 information on enemy forces to meet the Senator's deadline by close of
 business today.
 Later in the day I met with Senator Hollings and showed him the
 figures as prepared by SAVA, explaining that they were based on sensitive
 sources.    He looked them over but said he didn't want to keep a copy and
 had no intention of making this information public.

 Tuesday - 8 December 1970
 1.                - GLC) In response to his request yesterday
 for information about the will of Anna Louise Strong, I left a message
 for J. Sourwine, Chief Counsel, Senate Internal Security Subcommittee,
 that since we did not make it our business to follow the activities of
 American citizens abroad we had no information about Anna Strong's
 will except the recollection of some of our China hands who had seen
 a recent article in Combat magazine about it and understood that the
 contents of her will, which was executed in 1966, were divulged some
 time prior to her recent death.  I suggested that the Subcommittee
 contact the State Department and the FBI for further information on
 this.
 2. I[ JMM)  Met with Frank Slatinshek, Acting Chief
 Counsel, House Armed Services Committee, and told him that our
 retirement legislation was being reported out by the Senate Armed
 Services Committee and we hoped the House could act on it before
 adjournment.  I left with Slatinshek the brief outline of the main pro-
 visions of our bill.  He said he would do what he could but unfortunately
 Chairman Rivers was going to be out of town for the next several days
 and there were no bills on the Committee agenda so he was not sure when
 they could take it up.
 Briefed Slatinshek on status of Soviet ICBM deployment, Soviet
 airfield and port construction activity in Egypt, Soviet naval vessels in
 Cuban area and Soviet submarine activity in the Pacific.

 3.             JMM)  Richard Moose, Senate Foreign Relations
 Committee staff, called to say that he and Jim Lowenstein, of the Com-
 mittee staff, had prepared a report on Cambodia based on their recent
 trip to Southeast Asia and had been asked by the Committee to sanitize
 it for publication as rapidly as possible.  Moose asked if we could have
 someone come over and review it with them from a security standpoint
 on a strictly unofficial basis, it being understood that they would not
 necessarily be bound by our recommendations, and the knowledge that
 we had seen the re  rt at all would be strictly between us.  After checking
 with the Director,  o               hie.f, FE, and I arranged to meet with
 Lowenstein and Moose at 0800 tomorrow.
 4. II- JMM)  Pat Holt, Senate Foreign Relations Committee
 staff, called and referred briefly to a resolution introduced in the Senate
 by Senator Dole regarding Son Tay, adding that it had been referred to
 the Foreign R elations Committee and the Committee had scheduled
 executive session hearings on this subject for Monday, 14 December,
 at which they would like "somebody from CIA" to appear.  He added
 that they would expect the Director to appear personally, but did not
 wish to so specify in their formal request.  He said the hearings would
 run all day and the morning would be taken up by DOD so Agency witnesses
 could expect to appear in the afternoon.
 5.                        - LLM) At the request of Albert Bustamante,
 in the San Antonio office of Representative Henry Gonzalez (D. , Texas),
 spoke with an individual who claimed that he had submitted his application
 25X1A          some weeks ago for work with the Agency as a load master
 and was anxious about the outcome, saying that he had dealt
 25X1A          with a F         ::1  Per Mr. Bustamante's request that we handle this
 directly with the constituent, I told
 25X1 A                                                      that we would look into the
 status of his application and be back in touch.
 6.                  - LLM)  The office of Representative Emilio
 Daddario  U. , Conn,  ca led and requested two copies of the Agency's Red
 China map folio for the Congressman and indicated that they had been
 referred to us by Representative William Murphy (D. , Ill. ), the retiring
 Chairman of the Asian and Pacific Affairs Subcommittee, House Foreign
 Affairs Committee.    I said we would be happy to oblige.

 report in the Committee office on the CIA Retirement Act amendments.
 The proposed report was identical to the draft report we had given to
 Ed Braswell at his request on 3 December with the addition of one
 sentence to the explanation of the ceiling increase to the effect that
 without the proposed relief the Agency would not be able to accommodate
 all projected retirees through 30 June 1974.  Later I advised Phyllis
 Bacon, on the Committee staff, of two typographical errors made in the
 Committee print-up of the bill, and she thanked us for calling this to her
 attention.

 1.  I ~LC)  J. Sourwine, Chief Counsel, Senate
 Internal Security Subcommittee, called and said he would like to see the
 will of Anna Louise Strong. He described her as a well-known communist
 who spent her last years in China and is reported to have left her estate
 to Mao Tse-Tung.  Her lawyer is now sending money to the Black Panthers,
 supposedly under the terms of her will.  We are looking into the matter.
 2. RW)  Phyllis Bacon, in the office of Ed Braswell,
 Senate Armed Services Committee staff, called to say the CIA retirement
 bill will be on the Committee executive agenda tomorrow.
 3. I I JMM) During a chance encounter at a social
 gathering over te weekend, Senator Fulbright mentioned an Agency
 "report" which he said indicated some 30, 000 communist agents operating
 in South Vietnam.  I told him that the press reports about such a document
 were seriously misleading, that I had explained the situation to members
 of his staff, and that we would be glad to brief him on the facts if he was
 interested.  He said this would not be necessary.
 4.                    JMM)  Called Senator Henry Jackson (D., Wash.)
 of the Agency's Armed  ervices Subcommittee, to remind him that our
 retirement legislation will be on the Committee's executive agenda
 tomorrow and to ask that he try to make sure it gets attention.  He said
 he would "look out for it. "

 Appropriations bill reported yesterday by the Senate Appropriations
 Committee.  Mr. Preston told me that he has discussed the Senate
 amendments restricting the use of funds in Southeast Asia with the
 Chairman.   Mr. Preston does not know when to expect determination
 by the Chairman whether he will recommend that the House accept the
 Senate amendments or reject them and go to conference on the bill.
 I briefed Mr. Preston on the TU-95 flights to Cuba; Cienfuegos;
 and Soviet naval facilities at Sollum and Mersa Matruh.
 5              JGO)  Met with Mr. Frank Slatinshek, Acting Chief
 Counsel, House Armed Services Committee.  I brought him up to date
 on the Senate handling of the Agency retirement bill.  As an aside
 Mr. Slatinshek noted that the Defense Department briefing of the full
 Committee yesterday afternoon on Son Tay, bombing, and Cuba was not
 a very satisfactory one.     Many of the members had already departed and
 other incidents apparently marred the continuity of the briefing leaving
 those present less than satisfied with the briefing.
 I briefed Mr. Slatinshek on a Chinese missile site.

 Armed Services Committee staff, the draft Committee report on the
 CIA Retirement Act amendments he had requested from
 Mr. Maury yesterday and he said it was exactly what he wanted.  I
 brought his attention to the fiscal data section and told him that the
 amendments would initially result in a net increase of funds for the
 system due to the infusion of funds under the employer contributions
 provision.  I gave him a written report on the status of the retirement
 ceiling as of 3 December, indicating only 22 unencumbered slots remain,
 and he agreed this fully demonstrated the urgency of our needs.  I also
 left with him a short paper on ceiling for him to use as an aide-memoir
 in the executive session of the Committee.  Braswell was hopeful that
 he might be able to see the Chairman later this afternoon, looking towards
 favorably reporting out our amendments early next week.

 Referring to a question he brought up at our last Subcommittee
 hearing, I filled Bow in on recent developments regarding terrorism in
 Uruguay.
 I also mentioned certain developments regarding Soviet and ChiCom
 missile and Soviet naval activities.
 In response to my question Bow said attacks on the Agency from
 the House membership, such as the Democratic Study Group allegations,
 need not be taken seriously at this time.
 In response to Bow's question I said that the operation at Son Tay
 was strictly a military affair for which the Agency had no responsibility.
 Bow said he was glad to hear this, but we'd be hearing a lot about this
 and an effort would certainly be made to try to pin it on the Agency.

 2. I        I- JMM)  Last evening discussed with Ralph
 Preston, Staff   ssis an , House Appropriations Committee, the problem
 posed by the fact that apparently the language of the Fulbright amendment
 is to be incorporated in the Senate version of the Defense Procurement
 bill.  Preston feels that this would pose some very serious problems
 for Chairman Mahon on the House side, and this morning Preston called
 to say he had received an advanced copy of the bill which would be
 formally sent to the House this afternoon and it did indeed contain a
 provision identical to the so-called Fulbright amendment.  Preston is
 concerned that this language could properly be interpreted as applying to
 certain going programs in Southeast Asia.  He feels that before deciding
 on how to handle this bill on the House side Chairman Mahon will want to
 assure himself of exactly what the effects are, and for this reason may
 want to discuss the problem personally with the Director.  Preston hopes
 to take the matter up with Mahon before the end of the week and will let
 us know the results.
 3.                    JMM)  Ed Braswell, Chief of Staff, Senate
 Armed Services Committee, called to say that he was hard pressed for
 time and would have difficulty in finding time to prepare a Committee
 report on our retirement legislation.  He asked if we could do a draft
 for his use, which I agreed to undertake, with the deadline of Friday
 afternoon, 4 December.

 Ed Braswell, Chief of Staff, Senate Armed Services Committee, and
 stressed our concern about getting our pending retirement legislation
 through before Congress adjourns.  Mr. Maury pointed out again that
 the legislation was noncontroversial and merely conforming in nature.
 Braswell said he would talk to Senator Stennis about it this week.  In
 response to Mr. Maury's offer to talk with the Chairman personally
 about the legislation, Braswell suggested that we wait until he has an
 opportunity to take the matter up with him.  The Committee will have
 an executive session in the next few days and it is possible the legislation
 can be reported at that time.
 Braswell asked for our assistance in pulling together unclassified
 information on the extent of trade on the part of various countries with
 North Vietnam.  We said we would check with our people and be back
 in touch with him.

 2.1     1 GLC) Messrs. Maury and met with Bill Woodruff,
 Counsel, Senate Appropriations Committee, and Mr. Maury gave him the high-
 lights of yesterday's meeting with Ed Braswell, Senate Armed Services Com-
 mittee staff and Ralph Preston, HouseAppropriaticus Committee staff. Woodruff
 expressed the opinion that the total Agency budget figure could be divulged
 without serious consequences but gave the impression that he did not plan
 to push this position at this time.  We expressed concern that revelation
 of the total Agency budget figure would merely be a first step which would
 result in increasing pressure for more details on Agency expenditures.
 We brought Woodruff up to date on several current intelligence
 items including the position of the Soviet sub tender near Cuba, the
 status of Soviet-Cuban relations, Egypt's pilot training effort, and
 status of the Soviet SU-7 Fitter fighter bomber.

 3.1                   GL C) I advised Gerry Elliott, Staff Assistant
 to Representative Donald M. Fraser (D., Minn.), that we had taken up
 with the Director their request of yesterday for an Agency briefing on
 Cambodia for Congressman Fraser.  I told him since the State Department
 and the Department of Defense have all the information the Agency has
 on Cambodia and have appeared before the Foreign Affairs Committee,
 the Director felt it would be inappropriate for the Agency to give personal
 briefings to members of the Committee.  Elliott said he had informed
 Representative Fraser of our conversation yesterday and the Congressman
 had expected that we would not want to brief individual members, but
 wondered whether the Director would respond favorably to a request from
 Chairman Morgan if Fraser could persuade the Chairman to call the
 Director before the Foreign Affairs Committee.  I told Elliott that, of
 course, I could make no commitment for the Director on this, but was
 certain the Director would give serious consideration to any request
 from Chairman Morgan and would cooperate to the extent possible under
 the circumstances.
