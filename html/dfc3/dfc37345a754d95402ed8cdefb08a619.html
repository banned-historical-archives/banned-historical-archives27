 INCIDENT
 People throughout the world have been
 profoundly shocked and disturbed by the
 news that an American espionage plane was
 shot down over the Soviet Union.  There is
 no doubt that our Government has suffered
 a serious setback at a critical moment.  As
 an incident this one is likely to go down
 in history as the greatest single item of na-
 tional embarrassment in the 8 years of the
 Eisenhower administration.  As a symbol of
 what is basically wrong with the present con-
 duct of our foreign policy, it is of even
 greater importance.  I am conscious of the
 delicacy of the situation itself.  I am aware
 that while the administration has been em-
 barrassed by these events, all Americans are
 embarrassed- with it.  I do not wish to add
 personal or partisan fuel to the controversy
 which will be raging for weeks ahead on this
 issue.  Nor do I wish, in anything r say, to
 imply that I have any more information, of-
 ficial or unofficial, on the intelligence aspects
 of this case than does any other American
 citizen.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - APP    IX
 As I said on television yesterday afternoon
 ("Meet the Press," NBC-TV, Sunday, May 8,
 1960):
 "I don't think any one of us as outsiders
 can know what is essential in the way of
 espionage.  We are all realists.  We all know
 that this is a difficult and complex world.  We
 know we are at a disadvantage, that the
 Soviet is a closed police state and has certain
 very great advantages over us.    I don't know
 the inside story of how much information we
 have or what we lack or what risks should be
 required to get it.  I would assume that we
 should  not  do this  sort  of thing  for  a
 marginal gain.
 "But we are preparing for a summit meet-
 ing.  The whole history of the world may
 depend upon our ability to negotiate with
 the Soviet Union.  We are in a very delicate
 position and certainly this would be a time
 to be far more circumspect than obviously
 these people have been.  I think they have
 committed a very gross case of misjudgment
 and I think it is highly reckless, dangerous,
 and hurtful."
 a&I see them      are the unalterable,
 in
 i.`are St3tteepaitifieii' kid teen caught
 in a drac$_              .  The Department
 may ifave been the victim of misinformation
 provided by  other  Government  agencies.
 Nevertheless, foreign    governments-both
 friendly and otherwise-are bound to press
 the point that the word of the U.S. State
 Department can no longer be trusted.   In
 international negotiations,  as  in personal
 relationships, lack of trust is damaging and
 costly.
 2. If the flight really was not authorized
 in Washington, the incident demonstrates
 that the I'ra~3iii&                   or-
 aryea?gf,,,pxLUcally important developments
 and activities within our own Government.
 This, in turn, seriously undermines the pres-
 tige of the President at a time when the
 world urgently needs his strength and in-
 fluence in behalf of peace.
 3. The Russian suspicions of our good faith
 in negotiating the control and inspection
 systems which are essential to disarmament
 programs have been increased.  As a result,
 we will find them even more difficult to deal
 with on these critical questions at the Sum-
 mit.
 4. We have placed ourselves in a defensive
 position in our efforts to negotiate a step
 by step relaxation in cold war tensions.  In
 contrast the Soviet position has been greatly
 strengthened.  It is safe to assume that the
 Kremlin will use its advantage to the limit
 in mustering world opinion against us.
 Hence this incident adds up tom-&Ir
 .   :g;xl4      the-quality-pf.,  Ierican
 lea,q,.e     is A loss of faith in the reliability
 and"straightforwardness of official U.S. state-

 in the conduct of critical policy matters; and
 a loss of faith in U.S. sincerity in easing ten-
 sions in advance of the summit meeting.
 hesei        #,:,#p ?a      - .     .. ~,... I do not
 underestimate it.   But tha         is an  argu-
 ment for greater Presidential control, not
 less.  The astonishment and incredulity of
 many millions of Americans today over the
 headlines is magnified     by      the knowledge
 that our President and his administration
 are simply not in control of their own opera-
 tions.  The bumbling nature of this whole
 incident-t   4                        ordination
 betweP,ll nna ..rnar y                        .  t
 aim ? rIiat merits our strongest dismay.
 It symbolizes what is chiefly wrong with
 this administration's record in foreign pol-
 icy.  Indeed we can generalize from this
 instance.
 The administration i  uncop;(,11ugted.  No
 on      i &fitiai:" g`fi *6'4` i~P.p   YOnt is
 not-it doesn't even know what some of our
 military and intelligence people are doing.
 The' President is not a master in his own
 house.  Each sector of the administration
 undermines another.
 This has been the story all along-on de-
 fense, on disarmament, on foreign aid.  No
 one has a firm grasp on where we are headed.
 Lacking overall  goals,  we  continually let
 means get in the way of ends.  Our military
 policy defeats our economic policy.  Our in-
 telligence  policy                                                                        defeats  our diplomatic
 policy.  Our short-term requirements defeat
 our long-term ones.
 This Government and this Nation simply
 cannot survive piecemeal, uncoordinated ad-
 ministration where our vital national inter-
 ests are clearly at stake.
 This incident, embarrassing, dangerous,
 and damaging as we know it to be, may in
 the long run prove to be worthwhile if it
 will wake America and the world to the
 hideous dangers of this cold war struggle.

 IN THE I  U S E OF REPRESENTATIVES
 .Fiday, May 6, 1960
 Mr. POR         .      Mr. Speaker, under
 leave to exte my remarks in the REC-
 ORD, I include                                                      a following testimony by
 Mrs. Maurine   euberger in support of
 pay increases f  postal and Federal em-
 ployees.  Mrs.                                                            euberger appeared be-

 Service Commmitt   on May 5, 1960.
 Her husband, t   late Oregon Senator,

 the Post Office an Civil Service Com-

 chairman of the Fe  ral Pay Subcom-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 statement by the distinguished junior
 Senator from Wyoming CMr. McGEE].
 There being no objection, the state-
 ment was ordered to be printed in the
 ,,'RECORD, as follows:
 STATEMENT BY SENATOR MCGEE
 Today marks the 60th anniversary of serv-
 ice performed by Vernon Talbertt.  Vernon,
 as he is affectionately known to us in the
 Senate, has served with dignity and distinc-
 tion.               He has been especially helpful to new
 Members and their staffs as they assume
 their duties in the Senate; and I am pleased"
 to join my colleagues in paying tribute to this
 outstanding employee.  I wish him well, and
 trust he will be able to serve the Senate for
 another 50 years.
 Mr. MOSS. Mr. President, it is hard
 for those of us who have recently come
 to the Senate to contemplate the full
 import of 50 years of service to this body.
 Vernon L. Talbertt, the Chief Messenger
 in the Office of the Secretary of the
 Senate, who today celebrates his golden
 anniversary as a Senate employee, was
 going about his tasks before many of us
 were born.
 There is little one can say that com-
 pensates for so many years of steady and
 devoted service. If his satisfaction in a
 job well done is half as great as that of
 the Senate, this should indeed be a grati-
 fying day for him.
 From the first time I met Vernon, and
 on every subsequent occasion, he has
 been pleasant, courteous, devoted, and
 efficient.  I am sure the many men in
 public life whom he has served could say
 the same. We all wish him well.
 Mr. CANNON.  Mr. President, I feel
 ,enuinely privileged to have the oppor-
 'Otunity of joining with my colleagues to-
 day in honoring a man who has given
 unselfishly of his confidence, service, and
 ability to the Senate of the United States
 for half a century.
 To me, Vernon Talbertt, the Chief
 Messenger of the Office of the Secre-
 tary, a man who has served eight Secre-
 taries of the Senate, typifies the high
 purpose and genuine loyalty that per-
 vades this great institution and which
 motivates all of the employees and staff
 that serve in making our Government
 work.
 His devotion to duty and quiet effi-
 ciency attracted my atention when I first
 came to the Senate, and the high opinion
 of this man that I formed then remains
 to this day.
 I look forward to his continued employ-
 ment in the Senate and hope he will be
 with us for many more years.
 RETIREMENT OF SENATOR JOSEPH
 C. O'MAHONEY
 Mr. MURRAY.  Mr. President, I was
 saddened to learn that my good friend
 the senior Senator from Wyoming, has
 decided to retire. Having made a similar
 decision last month, I realize how difficult
 it is to weigh conflicting personal, family,
 and political desires.  JOE O'MAHONEY
 has richly earned the right to lay aside
 the duties and demands of office, but the
 Senate will suffer a great loss from his
 absence.
 JOE O'MAHONEY was one of four Mem-
 bers now in the Senate serving when I
 came here 26 years ago. Then already,
 with years of prior experience on Capitol
 Hill as secretary to the late Senator
 Kendrick, JOE O'MAHONEY was highly
 trained in the technicalities of govern-
 ment; and his counsel to me and other
 incoming Senators was invaluable, as it
 has been through the years.
 I recall with pleasure and was proud
 of my years of service with him when he
 was chairman of the Committee on In-
 terior and Insular Affairs, which ac-
 complished so much for our country.
 Subsequently, I became chairman, and
 when JOE O'MAHONEY returned to the
 Senate I was pleased that he also re-
 turned to the Interior Committee, to
 which he contributed so much in wise
 counsel and sound judgment.
 Mr. President, I wish to mention two
 great endeavors of Senator O'MAHONEY
 which illustrate the foresight that has
 characterized his legislative endeavors.
 He was coauthor of the O'Mahoney-
 Milliken amendment, which reserves to
 upper basin States the use of waters
 arising in those States prior to use for
 navigation,.  Rural electric cooperative
 leaders in the upper Missouri basin have
 an ever-deepening appreciation of this
 provision of law, enacted 16 years ago,
 and now being cited in protection of our
 rights.
 Perhaps JOE  _O'MAHONEY'S  greatest
 contribution to this Nation was his bril-
 liant leadership as chairman of the
 Temporary National Economic Commit-
 tee. I think it is fair to state that the
 TNEC   study,   conducted  by  JOE
 O'MAHONEY, was the first exhaustive,
 thorough and workmanlike evaluation of
 this Nation's economy. The TNEC study
 laid some Of the groundwork for the Em-
 ployment                                                             Act   of  1946,  and JOE
 O'MAHQNEY properly served, with dis-
 tinction, as first chairman of the Joint
 Committee established by the Employ-
 ment Act of 1946.
 I wish you good health, JOE, and many
 pleasant years of retirement for you and
 Mrs. O'Ma:honey.
 PROSPECTIVE  RETIREMENT  OF  SENATOR
 O'MAIIONEY
 Mr. WILEY.  Mr. President, when I
 heard that my dear friend, Senator
 O'MAHONEYY, had made up his mind not
 to be a candidate for reelection, that an-
 nouncement brought back memories of
 my association with him, through the
 years, on subcommittees of the Judiciary
 Committee. At this same time, I should
 like to pay a brief tribute to this dis-
 tinguished and outstanding Member of
 the Senate.
 Mr. President, in the last 2 days
 several Members of this body have ex-
 pressed their regrets because of the an-
 nouncement of the very able senior
 Senator from Wyoming that he will not
 leader,  appropriately commented that
 few men who have served in this body
 have rendered more dedicated or more
 patriotic service than has the Sena-
 tor from Wyoming, Senator  JOSEPH
 O'MAHONEY.
 The senior Senator from New York,
 who was acting minority leader during
 the Tuesday session, paid his tribute as
 9389
 a Republican to Senator O'MAHONEY and
 to his unusual abilities as a lawyer.
 I should like to add a few comments
 relating to the dedicated work and ac-
 complishments of Senator O'MAHONEY,
 with whom I have had the pleasure of
 serving in the U.S. Senate and on its
 committees for more than 20 years.
 Senator O'MAHONEY has always been
 a fighter.  He has fought for economic
 freedom, for the little man, and for
 American economic and political success.
 One of his basic beliefs is that "political
 liberty cannot exist without economic
 freedom."
 In fact, from early childhood, Senator
 O'MAHoNEY  learned to be a fighter.
 After his father died, he studied at night,
 while he worked in the daytime for a
 publishing house.  He held many odd
 jobs, and wrote many freelance articles.
 One of them was entitled "A Hundred
 Years Hence," and predicted television,
 nuclear science, and other modern-day
 marvels.
 In 1916, Senator O'MAHoNEY went to
 Cheyenne, Wyo., to make his permanent
 home there.  Ever since, he has stood
 out as a vocal proponent of the Ameri-
 can West. He first came to Washington
 as secretary to Senator John B. Ken-
 drick, of Wyoming. Later, he served as
 First Assistant Postmaster General; and
 in 1934 he was appointed to fill the seat
 of Senator Kendrick, who died in office.
 Senator O'MAHONEY has held this seat
 ever since, with the exception of the
 years 1952-54.
 Senator  O'MAHONEY first served on
 the Judiciary Committee in 1936. When
 he was reelected to the Senate in 1954,
 he was again named to the Judiciary
 Committee; and since then he has played
 a very vigorous role on that committee
 and on its Antitrust and Monopoly Sub-
 committee-on both of which I have had
 the privilege of serving with him.
 Senator O'MAHONEY has been known
 for his independence of thought.  Al-
 though I have not always agreed with his
 political or his economic thinking, I have
 always appreciated his candor, his forth-
 rightness, and his courage.
 In  the   retirement  of      Senator
 O'MAHONEY, the U.S. Senate and the
 American people will lose a devoted serv-
 ant, a fighting representative, and a con-
 stitutional scholar.  As a Republican, I
 naturally must hope that the one who
 will replace him will be a member of my
 own party.  Yet, as an American, I cer-
 tainly pray that the stature of the man
 who will replace him in this body will be
 equal to that of my dear friend, Senator
 JOSEPH O'MAHONEY.
 to`     fieattention of the Senate to
 the article in the Washington Post this
 morning by Mr. Walter Lippmann in
 which he discusses the present situation
 resulting from the flight of the U.S. U-2
 airplane over the territory of Soviet Rus-
 sia. As so often is the case, Mr. Lipp-
 mann hits the nail squarely on the head..
 He said:

 the Soviet Union, it will henceforth be our
 avowed policy to fly over Soviet territory,
 using the territory of our allies as bases.
 He goes on:
 To avow that we intend to violate Soviet
 sovereignty is to put everybody on the spot.
 It makes it impossible for the Soviet Gov-
 ernment to play down this particular inci-
 dent, because now it is challenged openly in
 the face of the whole world.  It is compelled
 to react because no nation can remain pas-
 sive when it is the avowed policy of another
 nation to intrude upon its territory.  The
 avowal of such a policy is an open invitation
 to the Soviet Government to take the case to
 the United Nations, where our best friends
 will be grievously embarrassed.
 Mr. President, I was very unhappy and
 dubious about the announcement of this
 policy which seems to me to be insup-
 portable throughout the world.
 Mr. Lippmann goes on to say in ana-
 lyzing the situation as to what should or
 should not have been done:
 The administration should have said that
 it was investigating the charge and would
 then take suitable action.  We should then
 have maintained a cool silence.
 I have heard it suggested that certain
 of the committees-t

 to secure some information about the

 on an avowed policy of violating Soviet
 airspace and sovereignty.  World opin-
 ion, our allies, and the United Nations
 will repudiate that policy.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the entire article by Mr. Lipp-
 mann be made a part of the RECORD at
 this point.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 Ties SPY Busnwss
 (By            ]Mann)
 In the whir  of incidents following the
 capture of the spy plane the administration
 has ventured, perhaps the right word for it
 would be stumbled, into an untenable policy
 which is entirely unprecedented in inter-
 national affairs.                Our position now seems to
 be that because it is so difficult to collect in-
 formation inside the Soviet Union, it will
 henceforth be our avowed policy to fly over
 Soviet territory, using the territory of our
 Allies as bases.
 Although the intention here is to be can-
 did and honest and also to make the best
 of a piece of very bad luck, the new policy-
 which seems to have been improvised be-
 tween Saturday and Monday-is quite un-
 workable.
 To avow that we intend to violate Soviet
 sovereignty is to put everybody on the spot.
 It makes it impossible for the Soviet Gov-
 ernment to play down this particular inci-
 dent because now it is challenged openly in
 the face of the whole world.  It is compelled
 to react because no nation can remain passive
 When it is the avowed policy of another na-
 tion to intrude upon its territory.  The
 avowal of such a policy is. an open invitation
 to the Soviet Government to take the case to
 the United Nations, where our best friends
 will be grievously embarrassed.  The avowal
 is also a challenge to the Soviet Union to put
 pressure on Pakistan, Turkey, Norway, Japan,
 and any other country which has usable
 bases.  Our allies are put on the spot be-
 cause they must either violate international
 law or disavow the United States.
 Because the challenge has been made open-
 ly, it is almost impossible to deal with this
 particular incident by quiet diplomacy.
 The reader will, I hope, have noticed that
 my criticism is that we have made these
 overflights an avowed policy.  What is un-
 precedented about the avowal is not the
 spying as such but the claim that spying,
 when we do it, should be accepted by the
 world as righteous.  This is an amateurish
 and naive view of the nature of spying.
 Spying between nations is, of course, the
 universal practice.  Everybody does it as
 best he can.  But it 1s illegal in all coun-
 tries, and the spy if caught is subject to
 the severest punishment.  When the spying
 involves intrusion across frontiers by mili-
 tary aircraft, it is also against international
 law. Because spying is illegal, its methods
 are often immoral and criminal.  Its meth-
 ods  irxclude  bribery,  blackmail,  perjury,
 forgery, murder, and suicide.
 The spy business cannot be conducted
 without illegal, immoral, and criminal ac-
 tivities.  But all great powers are engaged.
 in the spy business, and as long as the
 world is as Warlike as it has been in all
 recorded history there is no way of doing
 without spying.
 All the powers know this and all have ac-
 cepted the situation as one of the hard facts
 of life.  Around this situation there has
 developed over many generations a code of
 behavior. The spying is never avowed and
 therefore the Government never acknowl.
 edges responsibility for its own clandestine
 activities. If its agent is caught, the agent
 Is expected to kill himself.  In any event,
 he is abandoned to the mercies of the gov-
 ernment that he has spied upon.
 The spying is never admitted.  If it can
 be covered successfully by a lie, the lie is
 told.
 All this is not a pretty business, and there
 is no way of prettifying it or transforming

 tent.
 In addition to the great contributions
 which he made to the church and to the.
 Nation-such as the restoration at Wil-
 liamsburg-he has done a great deal in
 private philanthropy and charitable giv-
 ing which has been not only useful, but
 inspirational.
 I have particularly in mind the occa-
 sion in 1942 when I became chairman
 of the national campaign organization
 to raise funds for the USO, which was
 then in its second year.  We were given
 a goal of $32 million to raise for the
 USO for service to the Armed Forces at
 that time, shortly after Pearl Harbor.
 This seemed like a staggering sum to me,
 but Mr. John D. Rockefeller, Jr., felt that
 the task was not insurmountable, and
 that, on the contrary, the amount was
 probably not nearly so much as we ought
 to be trying to raise.
 I recall that in those days and all
 through the war he-was the' principal
 inspiration to the efforts of that great
 organization, the United Service Organ-
 ization, in which the three faiths com-
 bined, through their 6 service organi-
 zations, to render assistance and to pro-
 vide a home away from home to all the
 men in the Armed Forces.
 I recall that as we were about to start
 our big drive, in the spring of 1942, go-
 ing to the office of our organization one
 morning and finding a letter addresse
 to me from Mr. Rockefeller.  I opene*i,
 it, and out of it fell a check for $1 mil-
 lion.  I had never seen anything like it
 before. I wanted to be sure that what
 I was seeing was actually so. Therefore
 I took the letter to my assistant in the
 next room and asked him if that is what
 he read too.  He said, yes, Mr. Rocke-
 feller had talked to him about it and had
 it into something highly moral and wonder- decided recently that that was the least
 ful.  The cardinal rule, which makes spy- he could do.

 THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 M ?            of Texas.  Mr. Presi-
 dLs ~~e to make a few ob-
 servations about an event which coup
 determine the destiny of our collritry
 for many years to come.  It is, o.1 course,
 the summit conference which will take
 place next week.                   -
 The conference will take place against
 the most dramatic. background in his-
 tory.  The world is changing before our
 very eyes. We must keep our heads cool
 and our hearts strong if we are to sal-
 vage the values which all Americans hold
 dear.
 Mr. President, these are turbulent
 times.  In Africa, men and women are
 awakening from the slumber of cen-
 turies.                   In Asia, the surging spirit of
 nationalism is sweeping away the bonds
 of the 19th century, in a desperate grasp
 by the people there fora place in the
 sun.  In the Soviet Union, a political
 philosophy which openly challenges the
 concept that men are born free is
 thrusting communism into new spheres
 of worldwide influence. In Latin Amer-
 ica, a restlessness grips the whole conti-
 nent. In Europe; political tides are ris-
 ing and fallirig,'arid men and women live
 on the precipice of danger and destruc-
 tion.
 Our President is going forth to deal
 with these challenging problems.  At
 best, the situation will be very difficult
 to handle.  But it can be complicated
 beyond recognition.
 It can be complicated if throughout
 the world there is a feeling that our Na-
 tion is divided by its fears.  It can be
 complicated if in other lands it is felt
 that ours is a Nation which has been
 split by suspicion.
 Mr. President, at times there is an
 aspect of our political system which can
 create that impression.  Frequently, it
 is difficult for other nations and other
 peoples to understand how we in the
 United States operate under our demo-
 cratic system. An outsider can look at
 our land and can come to the conclusion
 that the West fears the East, that the
 South distrusts the North, that the farm-
 ers fear the politicians, that labor fears
 management, and that Republicans and
 Democrats spend their time lambasting
 each other hammer and tongs.
 Mr. President, if our system were car-
 ried to an extreme, that would be so. If
 we were incapable of admitting the con-
 cept that an adversary can be acting in
 good faith:, then we could be destroyed.
 But, Mr. President, I believe our system
 has the vitality to survive .
 We are approaching an important
 election which could easily be the divid-
 ing line of the 20th teat,     In that 11 election, all the issues *i  be debated
 fully, frankly, at length, ,gird, 2 am sure,
 heatedly. This is as it shoed be, and as
 it must be.  But in,,,,trii& debate, I hope
 and believe that we h 11 close our ears
 to the hate mongers; th't't we shall de-

 and all the! objectf          'Inuster.
 When our Presi                the summit
 conference, I want            2 the buoy-
 ancy of a united counti'y:c'i   President
 is a member of a political party with
 whose concepts I do hotFpgxee. But he
 is still our' President, sill continue
 to be our President until next January.
 He is the one wt ni    pea for our Na-
 tion; and practi 'li          are Amer-
 icans before we are part ssa'ns.
 I also want to feel that our next Presi-
 dent, regd,rdless of his party, will be
 backed by the same unity of purpose
 when he speaks for this country.  The
 times are much too imporant for any-
 thing else.
 Yes, Mr. President, there is a time for
 partisanship; that is when we present the
 issues; that is when wg ask the American
 people to decide between the parties.
 But, ?Mr. President, there is also a time
 for unity. That is when the decision has
 been made, and when our Government
 must act for all the people.
 We cannot and we must not, permit

 half  sa race, of creed, of religions, of
 conference, he can tell Premier Khru-
 shchev in all confidence that this land,
 our own America, is united. We debate
 issues, and we debate them heatedly.
 But there is one issue that is beyond de-
 bate: that is our united determination
 to preserve our freedoms of discussion,
 of religion, of the right to disagree, and
 of the right to live in a land that is
 governed by law.
 Mr. DIRKSEN.  Mr. President, the
 n             is the commenda-
 tion and the congratulations and the
 thanks of the country for the observa-
 tions he has made with respect to the
 necessity for restraint at a time when
 the summit conference is soon to take
 place in Paris, and the Chief Magistrate
 of this country will go there to repre-
 sent our country.
 When the President leaves this country
 tomorrow for Paris, he will go not only
 as President of all the people, but he will
 go as the Commander in Chief of the
 Armed Forces of the country. It would
 certainly be amazing for the highest of-
 ficer elected within the gift of the people
 to go abroad for a conference of such
 momentous importance and feel that the
 specter of doubt had to dog him as he
 went into that conference and into the
 .interchanges between him and those who
 will be sitting around the conference
 table.
 As the majority leader pointed out,
 this conference is important and mo-
 mentous, because it involves the continu-
 ing peace of the world, and it involves
 the security and survival of our own
 country.
 It would be amazing if a commander
 had to move into battle never quite sure
 whether he had to entertain some doubts
 as to whether all of them were with him
 at a time when great decisions had to
 be made.
 This is, indeed, a time for unity and
 restraint. I saw a brief reference to an
 address  which was made  yesterday,
 which I shall not identify further than
 that, and I thought it was rather unfor-
 tunate because of some terms which were
 used.
 I think the Congress in itself is to be
 congratulated on the rem, it has
 shown about this wh67e,V=a.,pcident.
 We had a briefing se't`s o on Monday. It
 w a s a erid'e`d'b T1d1'   "drs of Moth bodies
 of Congress, from both sides of the aisle.
 And when it was concluded, it was agreed
 that the Secretary of State should speak
 for everybody and make a formal state-
 ment; and, with the exception of a laud-
 atory  and  commendatory  statement
 made in another branch of the Congress,
 we carried out that agreement in full. I
 think it indicates the restraint the Con-
 gress manifests.  Even though it is fair
 to assume that Membcrs_-of_Congress
 have access_to.,coiiSdential and secret
 dt  'flieystill shpwggjestraint, where-
 as sotff tfinet that restraint is not shown
 by others.
 Mr. President, there is a place for this
 center aisle in our deliberations as we
 differ on domestic matters and some-
 times on matters of foreign relations;
 but that time and that circumstance
 must be put aside when the Commander
 in Chief, when the President of the
 country, goes to the conference table,
 there to cross sabers, so to speak, on great
 issues.  He must feel that his hand is
 being held up, and that we will support
 him, and that he speaks for a unified
 country.
 I commend the majority leader for the
 statement he made this morning, because
 I think it will give the President great
 heart. I fully share and concur in those
 sentiments.

 seek peace and want disarmament and
 that they, as we, want to devote their
 energies and resources to improving the
 lot of their own people.
 But to speak disarmament is easier
 than to achieve it. We must be prepared
 for long, tedious-often discouraging-
 negotiations.  We must be prepared to
 compromise.
 This has been the case with negotia-
 tions to permanently end nuclear weap-
 ons testing, and we are now near that
 essential goal.
 Only an ostrich which has kept its
 head in the ground would say the nego-
 tiations, if they succeed, have not been
 worth it.
 So it is with disarmament. Years of
 negotiations, if they achieve the goal,
 will repay us with relief, with security,
 with safety, and with the comforting as-
 surance that mankind will endure and
 will not commit the final and irrevocable,

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 have been a Member of the Senate.  I
 think we must continue the program. I
 deeply believe there is a need for it, and
 I know the Senator from Alaska feels
 likewise.  But, on another occasion, I
 said there is such a thing as being so
 broadminded that we get fiatheaded;
 and I am wondering if we have not
 reached that point on foreign aid in this
 country.   We are so concerned about the
 poor and the unfortunate and the needy
 abroad-which we should be, and prop-
 erly so, that we go to the extent of
 neglecting our own.  That is the point
 the Senator from Alaska is so ably mak-
 ing.- I am glad he is doing so, because it
 needs to be done.
 Mr. GRUENING.        As the Senator has
 noticed, in the last year we have been
 borrowing money from our own people
 to be able to spend abroad as the $12
 billion deficit in 1959 reveals and, under
 the policies of this administration, which
 wishes to raise interest rates, our people
 will have to pay still more to raise the
 money to give and lend to foreign na-
 tions,. whereas, loans made to foreign
 countries are really not true loans at all,
 since they are repayable in soft curren-
 cies, which makes them virtually gifts,
 masquerading as loans.
 Mr. DODD.  Of course, they are.  I
 do not want to delay the Senator fur-
 ther.       I wish to hear what else he has to
 say.  However, I should like to say that
 his complaint is not that we are carry-
 ing on a foreign aid program, but, rather,
 that we are not carrying it out properly,
 that we are not doing the job as it should
 be done, and that we are not taking care
 of our own people as they should be
 taken care of and, in my own judgment,
 as a priority matter.  It is getting so
 that it is considered bad for an American
 to stand up and say that America should
 be given a priority in anything.  In some
 quarters it is considered wrong to do
 that. It has got so that if one raises his
 voice so he can be heard In this Chamber,
 he is characterized as a demagog.  We
 are led to believe that we must whisper;
 we must speak softly, in double terms
 and then only in certain places.  It is
 high time that our leaders, as the Sena-
 tor from Alaska is doing, speak up so
 they can be heard, and give the people
 the facts they need, so we can move
 ahead at home and abroad.
 Mr. GRUENING.  I thank my able
 colleague from Connecticut.  I shall not
 delay the Senate much further, but I
 think when the people read in today's
 RECORD, what some of these foreign proj-
 ects are, they will have a better under-
 standing  of  the  Eisenhower-Nixon's
 double standard.  Let me refer to the
 list of projects.
 Here is one item for $10 million for a
 textile mill in the Sudan.
 Here is one for $2 million for agricul-
 tural and industrial development in
 Somalia.
 Here is one for $800,000 for construc-
 tion of a warehouse in Nigeria.
 Here is one for $23 million for an irri-
 gation project for the Kingdom of
 Morocco.
 Here is one for $5 million for an elec-
 tric power plant for the Government of
 Libya.
 - Here is one for a pulp factory in
 Tunisia; and so on-projects which in
 this country our Government would de-
 nounce as socialistic and all the other
 adverse things. that it says about any
 projects for the American people.
 What makes these foreign aid projects
 sacrosanct?  Yet projects costing much
 lesser amounts, projects which have been
 carefully worked out, that have passed
 both bodies of Congress, which are aimed
 at relieving distress, whether for area
 redevelopment, education, housing, re-
 source development or to end water pol-
 lution, needs that exist in this country,
 are labeled as "unnecessary, unwise, and
 costly"?
 Perhaps there Is some allergy on the
 part of the Eisenhower-Nixon admin-
 istration to loans repaid in American
 dollars and that. when the loan is to be
 paid in new Taiwan dollars, rupees, or
 other soft currencies, the loan no longer
 is "unnecessary, unwise, and costly"?
 Mr. President, I confess that I cannot
 understand such double talk.
 But I can understand this, Mr. Presi-
 dent: Our gross national product has
 now reached the sum of one-half a tril-
 lion dollars annually.  What we were
 seeking to do in enacting S. 722 was to
 devote a sum approximately equivalent
 to what could be produced by our na-
 tional effort in 4 hours to relieving the
 economic distress of our fellow citizens
 here at home in areas needing economic
 redevelopment,
 It is my sincere opinion that the de-
 votion of that small fraction of our gross
 national product to such a worthy pur-
 pose at home has at least as much merit
 as devoting many times that much to
 similar projects abroad.
 The time will come-and I hope it will
 be not too long distant-when the Eisen-
 hower-Nixon administration will rue the
 day that it forsook the interests of the
 people here at home in favor of the peo-
 ple in 104 foreign countries, and adopted
 its double dealing, double talking, double
 standard, making it the first administra-
 tion in American history which by its
 actions shows that it prefers the interests
 of the people of foreign lands to the in-
 terests of the people of our own.
 Mr. President, I yield the floor.
 Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President, I sug-
 gest the absence of a quorum.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER. The
 clerk will call the roll.
 The legislative clerk proceeded to call
 the roll.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I

 for the quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 COMMUNIVV ANTENNA SYSTEMS
 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, un-
 less there is further business, it is the
 intention to adjourn the Senate shortly.

 situation, when the Senate adjourns this
 afternoon until 12 o'clock tomorrow, the
 pending business will be Calendar No.

 announce to the Senate that this meas-
 ure will not be considered today, but will
 be taken up for consideration at the con-

 I believe unanimous consent has been
 granted that if morning business should
 conclude before 2 o'clock, the bill, S.

 will be open for consideration and de-
 bate by the Senate.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The

 THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 Mr. KUCHEL.  Mr. President, this Is
 wffd-V" M! ,,his melancholy world.
 What mankind had fondly hoped might
 conceivably result in forward progress
 toward the cause of peace with honor
 apparently in advance has been doomed
 to failure.
 Today in Paris the Soviet Premier has
 done a tragic and frightening disservice
 by his announcement calculated to scut-
 tle a summit meeting which he himself
 originally sought.
 Fo            pyS have maintained
 a            s stem of espionage all

 be held for trial on charges of espion-

 while, they announce the orbiting in
 outer space of a mechanism, which, when
 perfected, perhaps could supply a world-
 wide reconnaisance capability to them.
 This morning the Soviet Premier used
 the U-2 incident as a basis for effective-
 ly preventing the meeting from being
 held.  What is it, Mr.. President, which
 the Soviets apparently, at all costs, de-
 sire to have remain secret behind their
 own borders? Is it progress iri the fields
 of peaceful pursuits, or is it something
 else?

 of American liberty, and equally, with

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - STE
 be prepared to make, and it will make
 them with the unstinting approval of all
 the American people and, I feel sure,
 with the approval of free governments
 and free peoples everywhere.
 I have just read the     ,, tl a merit.      ,q> r Press en made today
 in Faris at the c$fif  liCL   Et   i `ads
 of state. I ask unanimous consent that
 the text of this statement appear at this
 point in my comments.
 There being no objection, the state-
 ment was ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 Having been informed yesterday by Gen-
 eral de Gaulle and Prime Minister Macmil-
 lan of the position which Mr. Khrushchev
 has taken in regard to this Conference dur-
 ing his calls yesterday morning on them, I
 gave most careful thought as to how this
 matter should best be handled.  Having in
 mind the great importance of this Conference
 and the hopes that the peoples of all the
 world have reposed in this meeting, it con-
 cluded that in the circumstances it was best
 to see if, at today's private meeting, any
 possibility existed through the exercise of
 reason and restraint to dispose of this mat-
 ter  of  the  overflights  which  would have
 permitted the Conference to go forward.
 I was under no illusion as to the proba-
 bility of success of any such approach but I
 felt that in view of the great responsibility
 resting on me as President of the United
 States this effort should be made.
 In this I received the strongest support of
 my colleagues, President de Gaulle and Prime
 Minister  Macmillan,  Accordingly,  at  this
 morning's private session, despite the vio-
 lence and inaccuracy of Mr. Khrushchev's
 statement, I replied to him on the follow-
 ing terms:
 "I had previously been informed on the
 sense of the statement just real by Premier
 Khrushchev.
 "In my statement of May 11 and in the
 statement of Secretary Herter of May 9,
 the position of the United States was made
 clear with respect to the  is   a          ty
 of  esiona~gge,  activities 1   a          r    w ere
 natlbns  c{trust each      other's         intentions.
 We pointed that these activities had no ag-
 gressive intent but rather were to assure
 the safety of the United States and the free
 world against surprise attack by a power
 which boasts of its ability to devastate the
 United States and other countries by missiles
 armed with atomic warheads.  his is well
 known, not only the United States but most
 other countries are bonstantly the targets
 of elaborate

 official  statements, threatened  continued

 rest was emphasized and repeated by Mr.
 Khrushchev. T                            A.
 ngju.'hJhrsa .   either I nor my     overn-
 ment has intended any.  The actual state-
 ments go no, further than to say that the
 United States will not shirk its responsi-
 bility to safeguard against surprise attack.

 to 15e res         $r    fig y,   s cannot be,
 the issue.
 "I have come to Paris to seek agreements
 with the Soviet Union which v~      elimi-
 nate the necessit                          Pgx ~rsonae,

 t-I                                              the conference.
 "Should it prove impossible,, because of
 the Soviet attitude, to come to grips here in
 Paris with this problem and the other vital
 issues threatening world peace, I am plan-
 ning In the near future to submit to the
 United. Nations a pro_ lsal for the creation of
 a'ZYY1it;e  3a ons aerial surveillance to de-
 tect preparations                 is YSI
 had intended to place before this conference.
 This surveillance system would operate in
 the -territories of all nations prepared to
 accept such inspection.  For its part, the
 United, States is prepared not only to accept
 the United Nations aerial surveillance, but
 to do everything in its power to contribute
 to the rapid organization  and  successful
 operation of such international surveillance.
 "We of the United States are here to con-
 sider in good faith the important problems
 before  this  conference.  We are prepared
 either to carry this point no further, nor
 undertake bilateral conversations between
 the United States and the U.S.S.R. while the
 main conference proceeds."
 My words were seconded and supported by
 my Western colleagues who also urge Mr.
 Khrushchev to pursue the path of reason
 and commonsense, and to forget propaganda,
 Such an attitude would have permitted the
 conference to proceed.  Mr. Khrushchev was
 left in. no doubt by me that this ultimatum
 would never be acceptable to the United
 States.
 Mr. Khrushchev brushed aside all argu-
 ments of reason, and not only insisted upon
 this ultimatum, but also insisted that he
 was going to publish his statement in full
 at the time of his own choosing.
 It was thus made apparent that he was
 determined to wreck the Paris conference.
 In fact, the only conclusion that can be
 drawn from his behavior this morning was
 that he came all the way from Moscow to
 Paris with the sole intention of sabotaging
 this meeting on which so much of the hopes
 of the world have rested.
 In spite of this serious and adverse de-
 velopment, I have no intention whatsoever
 to diminish my continuing efforts to pro-
 mote progress toward a peace with justice.
 This applies to the remainder of my stay in
 .Paris as well as thereafter.

 PLOYEE TRAINII~                           FOR BETTER
 PUBLIC      SERVI     - MESSAGE
 FROM THE PRE-SID
 The PRESIDENT pro to   ore laid be-
 fore the Senate the followi                  message
 from the President of the Uni States,
 which was read and, with the ccom-
 panying report, referred to the C                  mit-
 tee on Post Office and Civil Service:
 To the Congress of the United States
 Act (Public Law 85-507) directs the Civil
 Service Commission to submit annually
 to the President for his approval and
 transmittal to the Congress a report with
 respect to the training of employees of
 the Government under the authority of
 the act. I am transmitting to you with
 this letter the Commission's report en-
 titled "Employee Training for Better
 Public Service."
 It is my firm conviction that training
 has long been essential for the success-
 ful operation of Federal agencies.  To-
 day's demands, however, bring a new
 urgency to training, especially for our
 career managers. I have, therefore, re-
 cently  asked  all  agency  heads       to
 strengthen their programs for the selec-
 tion, development, and training of these
 key officials. This directive is in addi-
 tion to that issued in 1955 which sup-
 ported all types of training.
 The action of the Congress in broad-
 ening authority to train Federal em-
 ployees was a healthy and progressive
 move.  The Commission's report shows
 that Federal officials have made intel-
 ligent use of their authority under the
 act and that it has helped to meet an
 urgent need.  I was particularly inter-
 ested in the C'ommi?sion's comments on
 "The Future," which point out two im-
 portant areas needing improvement-
 planning, and budgeting and scheduling
 for training activities.

 summit conference either a shambles or
 a forum f   Soy, et propaganda.- These
 in lea Ions were more than confirmed
 by the manner in which the Soviets have
 acted in the past 2 days.
 Premier Khrushchev arrived in Paris
 with what every correspondent has de-
 scribed as a display of toughness.
 A few hours ago he withdrew his in-
 vitation to President Eisenhower to visit
 the Soviet Union; and now we are in-
 formed that Mr. Khrushchev's price for
 negotiating at all is one that obviously
 is unacceptable to the United States.
 In other words, he is not going to discuss
 the issues upon which there might be
 some possibility of agreement, unless
 there are first discussed issues upon
 which there is no possibility of agree-
 ment.
 This development is one which will
 disappoint the whole world.  But the
 world has become accustomed to such
 disappointments.
 Mr. President, this is not the first time
 the Soviets have deliberately broken up
 an international meeting, and probably
 it is not the last.  The world would have
 a great deal more faith in Soviet inten-
 tions if these Communist leaders were.

 have h'Mr no op or tunity to familiarize
 myself with the statements and the facts
 with respect to the summit conference
 which have appeared on the ticker.
 However, I am advised that, first, the
 invitation for President Eisenhower to
 visit the Soviet Union has been with-
 drawn.  What the facts and circum-

 appear to me, offhand, that this comes

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE                      1"579\
 ciation of the President of the United
 States.
 I have been informed that the Presi-
 dent was absolutely firm in his own atti-
 tude.  I applaud him for it, and I am
 sure the people of this country will ap-
 plaud him for it, because it is the only
 kind of attitude the Soviet leaders can
 well understand, as we learn when we
 look into history in retrospect.
 The tragedy of it all is that all this
 could have been understood without the
 necessity of the President's making a
 trip to Paris in the first instance.  The
 Soviet leaders must have known, before
 they arrived for the conference, that this
 was going to be the "play," and. they
 could just as well have uttered their in-
 tentions first, as last; and then we could
 have known, and on that basis could
 have absented ourselves from the con-
 ference, or else could have had a confer-
 ence without the Soviet leaders.
 A moment ago I was officially advised
 that very shortly the President will
 make a statement from Paris.  I am
 confident it will be a firm statement
 from a man who is noted for his firm-
 ness in an hour of challenge and crisis.
 Mr. MAD          Mr. President, the
 news"from Paris is discouraging, but I
 would remind my colleagues and my
 countrymen that this is a time, not to
 give vent to our emotions, but to remain
 calm in the face of the danger which
 confronts us.  I have said this before.
 I will say it again.
 The events of the past week, accentu-
 ated by the reports of today's summit
 meeting, should bring home to all-to
 the Russians, to Americans, and to peo-
 ples everywhere-a realization of how
 slender is the reed by which we clinch
 to a civilized survival. That is the fact,
 and it ought now to be visible to all. Yet
 this blazing fact is in danger of being
 lost at Paris. National passions rise up
 on all sides to overwhelm it. The strug-
 gle of propaganda takes precedence over
 it. The incident is not being appraised
 in terms of its deep implications for the
 present state of the world's tensions.
 Let me say with all the seriousness
 that I possess that if this game goes on
 in its present vein-*hjsnf nprgna-
 gada        12

 Ml; 1 will be for some o er generation,
 not this one, to study it. For the wreck-
 age will be not just a plane.  It will be
 the charred remnants of the civilization
 which houses living mankind.
 That is the grim and fundamental
 reality which confronts the chiefs of
 state. There is no room at this meeting
 for displays of outraged indignation on
 anyone's part.  There is no room for
 propaganda plays designed to bring to
 any nation the label of sole custodian
 of peace or the sole source of provoca-
 tion to war.
 At this critical juncture the four men
 who meet are in every sense the prin-
 cipal guardians of humanity's highest
 hopes-perhaps of the human species
 itself.  This may well be the decisive
 moment when the deadly game begins
 to end in the beginnings of a beginning
 of a durable peace, or drift into the path
 of inevitable war. If they maintain that
 perspective, these men will put aside,
 and they will urge their peoples to put
 aside, the dangerous provocations and
 the glib propaganda. They will see these
 provocations, this propaganda, for what
 they are, fragments embedded ' in the
 great wound which festers in mankind
 and threatens the very existence of civil-
 ization.
 I would express the hope that Presi-
 dent Eisenhower and         Sffe- ev
 T!1      rIvately lay their dil!fer-
 ex1         OEM'
 ` a ' tafk them out, and
 then, along with their colleagues, Prime
 Minister Macmillan and President De
 Gaulle, recognize the danger which faces
 civilization-not just the United States
 and the U.S.S.R.-and do their utmost
 to bring a modicum of peace and stabil-
 ity to all mankind.
 The hopes of mankind are wrapped up
 in the deliberations of these four men.
 Let us pray that these hopes will not
 be treated lightly, but with the profound
 gravity to which they are entitled.  It
 is not a question of saving face; it is a
 question of saving civilization.
 Mg,     H  Mr. President, I applaud
 the s a em e-7 ? 's of the majority leader
 and the minority leader and also the
 Senator from Montana. I believe what
 they have said would meet the approval
 and the enthusiastic backing of a large
 majority  of  the  Senate,  and  it  is
 fitting that these three leaders in the
 Senate should at this time speak out
 as they have so eloquently done this
 morning.
 Mr. 22.W. Mr. President, the feeling
 of'i      ent must be unanimous among
 the American people that the President
 has been insulted by Mr. Khrushchev. I
 agree with the junior Senator from Mon-
 tana that it is a time when one must
 hold his emotions in rein. That is nec-
 essary, because the consequence of trag-
 edy in Paris today could be grave, in-
 deed.  Unless the rift can be healed by
 statesmen of good will and noble pur-
 pose, one consequence-one regrettable
 consequence--might be an intensifica-
 tion of the armaments race, the easing
 of which the people of the world had
 earnestly hoped for.
 I thought it was most appropriate
 that the Chaplain of the Senate prayed
 for careful, dispassionate, earnest con-
 sideration af, the summit conference
 when the Senate convened a few mo-
 ments ago.
 I believe the American people can
 trust President Eisenhower to react as
 the gentleman that he is, as a military
 leader, as a man of honor, as an em-
 bodiment of the pride, of the hopes,
 and the aspirations of the American
 people for peace.
 Mr. President, Senators will recall that
 I am one of those who have had mis-
 givings about a haphazard approach to
 a conference among heads of state.
 Regrettably, the events of today dem-
 onstrate   a unwisdom of substituting
 p  s                                rd
 w    and   ca  ul ste by-ste  so u-
 tion o                                                         Ei o T "   eYf  yji      s-
 ta mg negotiation through the custom-
 ary courses of diplomacy.  That, how-
 ever, is beside the point just now. What
 does the future hold?
 We must look to our strength.  We
 must look to the strength of our res-
 olution, to the strength of our dedica-
 tion to the central pulse of our crea-
 tion.                                                                                                  We must look to the strength of
 our defense and that of the free world.
 Mr. Khrushchev created the Berlin
 crisis.  We have an agreement about
 Berlin.  It was Mr. Khrushchev who
 created the current Berlin crisis, the
 problem, and then demanded that we
 settle it to his advantage. Peace is not
 promoted by such threats and tactics.
 air        dent o u o    proportion to
 its  mportance, the Russian dictator
 has undertaken to pr~ee the plamupon
 the United States for failure of the
 conference, while making it impossible
 for the conference to succeed other than
 through an acceptance by the Western
 Powers of the Khrushchev formula.
 As it is reported now, Khrushchev is
 demanding an ignoble apology by the
 President of the United States of Amer-
 ica as the price of further conferences.
 If true, our President will react honor-
 ably.
 Events of the next decade, Mr. Presi-
 dent; may well determine whether a free,
 unregimented  society  such  as  ours,
 through the processes of democracy and
 persuasion; can successfuly cope with
 the challenge of a completely regimented
 society, a dictatorship which now engulfs
 one-third of the world and surges with
 the monolithic unity of totalitarianism.
 To provide the answer, the United
 States must reassess its policies, must
 rededicate itself to its fundamental pur-
 .pose-to the goal of greatness to which
 destiny beckons it.
 Several Senators addressed the Chair.
 The PRESIDENT pro tempore.  The
 Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.
 Mr. WILEY.  Mr. President, the de-
 lid'M   'pus p Khrushchev to scuttle the
 conference reflects once more the twisted,
 unreliable, tortuous line of Communist
 policy,  I said "the deliberate act."
 - We saw Khrushchev get off the plane
 smiling.  He had made some preliminary
 remar'_s before coming to the conference.
 Everyone thought there was to be a
 home coming of nations, with a big pur-
 pose of arriving somewhere.  Instead of
 that, Khrushchev "blew his top."  The
 arrogant way in which he made the de-
 mand for the apology of the President of
 this country at the opening session of
 the conference is in itself most repre-
 hensible and not in accordance with rea-
 sonable conduct of international affairs.
 What he did causes every person who has
 a thinking apparatus to ask why he did
 it.  The answer must be that he did it
 for home consumption.  Things are not
 going very well within the borders of
 Russia.

 think he has fooled very many people by
 it.  He has, however, created another
 crisis-and it is a crisis.

 p  on.  He knows also that Switzerland
 "kicked out" a couple of spies the other
 day.
 What does Khrushchev think? Does
 he think that Europe and the rest of the
 world are simply children in evaluating
 these conditions?  What about these
 things, Mr. Khrushchev?
 After long months of attempting to
 get an agreement for a summit confer-
 ence, Khrushchev now throws the world
 hopes out the window and throws out
 the window the hoped-for agreement
 which might lessen world tensions. The
 world, I believe, will hold him account-
 able.
 Of course, we know his motives. First,
 wet let him come to this country.  We
 treated him like a gentleman.  By the
 usual trickery of Communist policies, he
 has now denied the equivalent right to
 our President, the right to meet the Rus-
 sian people.  Why is this?  Is he fear-
 ful the salesmanship of the Chief Ex-
 ecutive of this country is such, in relat-
 ing the facts, that the Russian people
 might, indeed, say to Mr. Khrushchev,
 "We do not like your lies. We do not
 like the way you behave. We like the
 way the American Nation treats its'peo-
 ple and the way the President of that
 Nation treats the people."
 Of course, Khrushchev, as an interna-
 tional poker player, thought he had a
 trump card.  As a matter of fact, it was
 only a deuce. He has already overplayed
 his hand.
 Now we will all wait to see what the
 President will have to say.  I am sure we
 will find he will call a spade a spade.  He
 will not mince any words.
 As I understand the situation, Khru-
 shchev is proposing another adjourn-
 ment of 8 months.  Perhaps he hopes
 then there may be a new President whom
 he can handle.
 He is going to be fooled.  No candi-
 date for the Presidency has any con-
 fidence in Khrushchev's methods or his
 promises.  They know the history of
 Mr. Khrushchev and Stalin. I believe
 the American people should consider
 this food for thought when they select
 the next President of the United States.
 Yes; these are challenging times, and
 it is up to all of us to realize, as has been
 suggested already, that we should not
 go off halfcocked ourselves, but think
 sanely.  But, more than that, we should
 keep the Nation alert and adequate.
 Mr. CA W by           President, Mr.
 Khrrus c ev by his action this morning,
 in  canceling  President  Eisenhower's
 visit to Russia, has again demonstrated
 to the world that he has no desire to live
 in the world as a neighbor with neigh-
 bors.
 I wish to associate myself with the re-
 marks which have been made by the
 majority leader, the minority leader,
 and the assistant majority leader, as
 well as others, on the floor of the Senate,
 in regard to the most delicate situation
 that is confronting this Nation and the
 world today at the summit meeting.  I
 am pleased by the calm statements and
 carefully selected remarks which have
 been made this morning on the floor of
 the Senate. All who have spoken realize
 the seriousness of the situation.
 I have a personal feeling with regard
 to this which I should like to state. Mr.
 Khrushchev, through his provocative re-
 marks and propaganda during the last
 week, has let the world know that he
 did not dare have the President of the
 United visit the Soviet Union, because
 of his position, because of his personal
 appeal, and because of his fine method
 of meeting folks in various countries,
 which has been demonstrated time and
 again.  I regret it sincerely, because I
 believe it would have been a great thing
 for the Soviet nation-the rulers and
 the people of that nation-to have had
 an opportuntiy to come in contact with
 the President's thinking and his person-
 ality at a time when the world sorely
 needs that type of leadership.
 I believe that on this occasion all of
 us should be proud of the fact that we
 treated Mr. Khrushchev as a ruler of a
 great country, and that we gave him
 every consideration when he was in the
 United States on his visit. Every cour-
 tesy was extended to him, and all doors
 were opened to him. Now he has demon-
 strated to the world that he does not
 care to live in a neighborly fashion with
 the rest of the world.
 It is our duty now to remain calm and
 deliberate and take no hasty action, but
 realize that we are living in a very diffi-
 cult time.
 Mr. DODD.  Mr. President, I have
 lis'tE'i!t'freat interest to the state-
 ments made this morning by. the distin-
 guished majority leader, the very able
 assistant majority leader, the gentle
 minority leader, and other leading Mem-
 bers of the Senate'on both sides of the
 aisle regarding the latest developments
 in Paris.  Certainly I wish to commend
 all of them for the interest which they
 have expressed at this critical hour.
 I am sure all of them agree with me
 that while this is a time for sanity and
 self-control, it is, as well, a time for
 reflection; and also a time for all of us
 to wake up and recognize that we have
 been pursuing a course which has led
 this Nation perilously close to grave
 disaster.
 A few months ago, just 7 months ago, I
 stood in my place here on the floor of
 the Senate and tried my best to warn
 my colleagues and my countrymen of
 what I thought was a great blunder: to
 bring to the United States of America,
 and indeed to its capital, this very citadel
 of freedom itself, to this Senate Cham-
 ber, one of the greatest tyrants in world
 history, and give him a cloak of respect-
 ability and acceptance by the forces of
 justice and decency in the world.
 But that is past history, sad history,
 tragic history.  Let us learn, its lesson
 well.
 Since then, it seems to me, we have
 moved step by step closer to what I
 described a few minutes ago as a grave
 disaster.  For, Mr. President, unless we
 mend our ways disaster will visit us.
 There are several points that ought to
 be made this morning.  One of them is
 that we should never have agreed to
 attend a so-called summit meeting with-
 out knowing in advance what is going to
 May 16
 be talked about; that we should not go
 to such a meeting like country bumpkins.
 That is what happened in 1955. I was
 a Member of the other body at the time,
 and I raised my voice then, and at that
 time I said I thought it was wrong to do
 so.  But  we  went  and  accomplished
 nothing and suffered a setback.  Some
 of us hoped we would learn a lesson then.
 But we kept right on. from one mistake
 to another.
 Now this has happened.  It was all
 predictable, I say.  I do not believe that
 Khrushchev ever intended to have Pres-
 ident Eisenhower visit the Soviet Union,
 because he knew the President's visit
 would threaten his control over the peo-
 ple he holds in subjection under his
 tyranny.  He knew it would threaten, as
 well, control over the millions of people
 he holds in confinement in the captive
 nations.  He could never permit Presi-
 dent Eisenhower, with his frankness and
 honesty and his captivating personality,
 the opportunity to talk to the Russian
 people who are held in thralldom by the
 evil dictatorship of the Soviet Union.
 So I repeat it was predictable.  The
 tragedy of it is that we welcomed
 Khrushchev to our own country and
 thereby increased his prestige and stand-
 ing in the world and furthered his evil
 plans.  While this is no time for vio-
 lence and no time for recklessness, it is,
 however, a time for reflection, for prayer-
 ful reflection.
 Right now I am sure Khrushchev is
 carrying on a massive propaganda effort
 to get us to permanently suspend all
 nuclear testing.  Many well-intentioned
 people are being used by him.  Insofar
 as my limited talents are concerned I
 tried to make this clear here in the Sen-
 ate last Thursday. There are better in-
 formed persons in Congress on this sub-
 ject than I, persons with more prestige
 and more experience in this field.  I say
 they should speak up and tell the people
 the facts and what needs to be done.
 Senator ANDERSON has done so, so have
 other Senators, but much more should
 be said and done by the President.
 We all want peace, but we want peace
 with honor and peace with justice.  We
 cannot blunder our way to peace.    We
 cannot beg our way to peace. We can-
 not wish our way to peace.  We must
 work and pray our way to peace if we
 want to have it.
 The effort by the Soviet Union to
 stymie us and cripple us and paralyze us
 with respect to nuclear testing is another
 massive move by this evil force in the
 world to destroy us and to destroy our
 allies who are with us in this fight for
 freedom.  Let them not succeed.  From
 this hour forward let us give up all self-
 deception and speak and act like free
 men who know the truth and are not
 afraid.
 So I hope that we will wake up.
 I say to the President that he need not
 feel embarassed or deeply disturbed.
 He can come home to the American
 people and to his free friends in the
 world.  We will. receive him well.  His
 only fault is that he trusted this evil
 man too much, but he did so with all
 good intentions for our country.

 NGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE                      9551
 e PRESIDENT pro tempore laid be-
 fore the Senate the following letters,
 which were referrec't as indicated :
 PROPOSED TRANSFER OF VESSEL BY NAVY DE-
 PARTME:,~TT TO THE AMERICAN LEGION, ELLS-
 WORTH, MICH.
 A letter from the Assistant Secretary of
 the Navy (Material), reporting, pursuant to
 law, that the`,Department of the Navy pro-
 poses                                                                          to  trxpsfer  the   vessel  Flamingo

 about fighting and dying for the things
 that are right.  A man is made to feel
 like a fool or knave when he speaks of
 these  things.   What must we `do to
 awaken in our people the spirit of justice
 and freedom?     What must we do to
 teach them not to be frightened into
 peace at any price?
 That is the great lesson to be learned
 from this calamity. Let us be strong in
 our faith in freedom, and brave in the
 face of threat and bring to our side free
 men everywhere. Let us recall the days
 of our early founding, when only a hand-
 ful of people on a strip along the Atlantic
 Ocean gained the respect of the world
 because these men were not afraid to
 stand up and fight for freedom.
 Mr. SCOTT.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator from Connecticut yield?
 Mr. DODD.  I yield.
 Mr. SC      I am personally very
 mttL   r1 e a the sensible, courageous,
 and patriotic position taken by the
 distinguished Senator from Connecticut.
 Whenever in this country we are con-
 fronted by a crisis, it is, in my judgment,
 important that voices such as that of the'
 Senator from Connecticut be heard to
 summon the country to a unified recog-
 nition of the fact that America is not
 only the strongest nation in the world
 in its armament, in its resources, and in
 its physical attributes, but that there
 exists within us a moral strength and a
 pride in our national history which will
 resist the sharp tactics of a bully and a
 blusterer, and which support the Presi-
 dent in the kind of situation which has
 developed today.
 While I shall speak further on this
 subject later, in my own time, at this mo-
 ment I wish particularly to congratu-
 late the Senator from Connecticut, who
 is never wanting in the expression of
 the kind of patriotic and forthright
 views which make so clear 'the attitude
 of most Americans.  Truly this is not a
 time in our country for sissies or panty-
 waists or timid. apologists, because the
 need and the circumstances call for uni-
 fied support of our country.
 Mr,         Mr. President, I deeply
 ap reciate, the remarks of the Senator
 from Pennsylvania.   He understands
 this situation. He can help us all to
 better understand.
 The sorriest spectacle of all, to me, Is
 Khrushchev, of all. people, lecturing
 President  Eisenhower  on  morality.
 Certainly a new, all-time low has been
 hit in the world when a man of Khru-
 shchev's record, having the blood of mil-
 lions on his hands can lecture a man like
 Dwight  Eisenhower  about  morality.
 Perhaps this incident will help to wake
 up the American people.  Think of a
 man who has never kept his word, who
 is full of deceit, who has caused all kinds
 of trouble in the world, a bloody butcher,
 lecturing a fine human being like Presi-
 dent Eisenhower, who every honest man
 and woman in the world recognizes to be
 such, on the subject of morality.

 LIMITATION OF IMPOS:ION  OF

 izing studies by congressional commit-
 tees of this type of taxation.                                               A com-
 panion bill is being introduced in the
 House by. Representative EMILIO Q. DAD-
 DARIO, of Connecticut's First District,
 Mr. President, businessmen and manu-
 facturers in ray own State of Connect-
 icut, as well as in other States, have been
 alarmed by the predicament in which
 they have been placed by the U.S. Su-
 preme Court decision in the Scripto,
 Inc., against Carson case, decided March
 21, 1960.  This deciison would permit
 any State having a use-tax law to compel
 an out-of-State seller "at retail" to act
 as tax collector and file periodic tax re-
 turns, even though the only connection
 of the seller with the taxing State is that
 orders are solicited there by an inde-
 pendent representative who acts for
 other firms as well.
 An equally troublesome situation has
 existed for some years as a result of the
 Supreme Court decision in the General
 Trading Company case (322 U.S. 335),
 which permits States to impose the same
 responsibilities on out-of-State sellers
 who send traveling salesmen to solicit
 business in the taxing State.
 May 16
 The unfortunate result of these two
 decisions is that manufacturers, large
 and small, are faced with the prospect
 of learning the details of the sales- and
 use-tax laws of every State in which
 they do business, collecting use taxes
 from their customers  id filing periodic   Orr?"
 tax returns.  This illioses an impossible
 burden, particularl` on small business,
 and is a serious i,>erference with inter-

 sales and use taxes within the scope of

 committees, and to limit the imposition
 of use taxes by the States on activities

 municate and deliver said information and
 material to other coconspirators for trans-
 mission  to  the  said  Government  of  the
 Union Of Soviet Socialist Republics. It was
 also a part of the said conspiracy that co-
 conspirators residing outside the United
 States would direct, aid and assist the de-
 fendant and certain coconspirators as afore-
 said to act as such agents within the United
 States and would receive and transmit the
 said information and material to the said
 Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist
 Republics.
 4. It was further a part of the said con-
 spiracy that the said Government of the
 Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and its
 officers, agents and employees would em-
 ploy, supervise and maintain the defendant
 and Reino Hayhanen, also known as "Vic,"
 within the United States as such agents of
 the said Government of the Union of Soviet
 Socialist Republics for the purpose of ob-
 taining, collecting, receiving, transmitting
 and communicating information and ma-
 terial of a military, commercial, industrial
 and political nature.
 5. It was further a part of the said con-
 spiracy that the defendant and certain of
 his coconspirators would receive sums of
 May 17 d
 money and other valuable considerations
 from the Government of the Union of Soviet
 Socialist Republics, its officers, agents and
 employees, in return for acting as said agents
 of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics
 within the United States for the purpose
 of obtaining, collecting, receiving, transmit-
 ting and communicating Information, ma-
 terial, messages and instructions on behalf
 and for the use and advantage of the said
 Government of the Union of Soviet Socialist
 Republics.
 6. It was further a part of said conspiracy
 that  the  said  defendant  and  his  cocon-
 spirators                                                                                                                                              would  use  false  and fictitious
 names, coded communications, and would
 resort to other means to the grand jury
 unknown to conceal the existence and pur-
 pose of said conspiracy.
 Overt acts
 In  pursuance     and  furtherance  of  said
 conspiracy and to effect the object thereof,
 the defendant and his coconspirators did
 commit, among others, within the eastern
 district of New York and elsewhere, the overt
 acts as alleged and set forth under count I
 of this indictment, all of which overt acts
 aft hereby realleged by the grand jury.

 THE NEEDS AT THE PARIS
 CONFERENCE
 Mr..UaNSEIFi.n  Mr. President, at
 this point it appears unlikely that the
 summit meeting will continue.  The
 need to save face may well prevail over
 the need to save civilization.  There is
 still a possibility, however, that Mr. Mac-
 millan and President de Gaulle will be
 able to impress upon Mr. Khrushchev
 the need for these meetings to go on to
 the end that a greater measure of
 stability may be brought about in the
 international situation, before the little
 stability that is left disappears entirely.

 intended to have this meeting. Why?
 Because he needed to "shoot off" his

 Those are not my words, but those are
 substantially the words of an
 c0mmp~i  a .nw ;n    A Np      ast, who is
 acquainted with the conditions as they
 exist.
 In other words, this was a diversionary
 tactic on the part of Mr. Khrushchev.
 Of course, if he can call a conference
 later on, when conditions at home have
 been smoothed over, and probably when
 the people in Russia who are feeling
 the ferment all over the world for a bet-
 ter standard of living have been put to
 sleep in one way or another, he may
 think it will be more opportune to hold
 a conference then.  Then, if the con-

 his ways and means, to give us a sleeping

 shchev has known what has been going
 on, but because the Russians happened
 to shoot down this young American,
 Khrushchev had a chance to blow up

 I am not one of those who thinks
 war is "right around the corner," so long
 as we are adequate and so long as we are
 prepared for any emergency, of which
 fact Khrushchev will be made aware.
 He, of course, it the prime actor on the
 world stage.  He can pull most any
 stunt and get the publicity he desires.
 I agree with the commentators of last
 evening.  The general consensus was
 that Khrushchev is not getting by with
 this, that the common people in the
 e is.

 do not believe it is shared by the Russian
 people; and if there is a public opinion In
 the Soviet Union, Chairman Khrushchev
 has by now driven matters so far that
 even it might assert itself.
 What is important to us is that Chair-

 remarks made by the distinguished Sen-
 ator from Montana [Mr. MANSFIELD], the
 distinguished Senator from Vermont
 [Mr. AIKEN], and others with regard to
 the episode which the world witnessed
 yesterday, and commend them for the
 views they expressed.
 Certainly, for all-around arrogance, it
 would be extremely difficult to outdo yes-
 terday's performance by the world's
 highest ranking blusterer, Mr. Khru-
 shchev. It was not enough that he had
 already rece ved assurance that   rM

 lic hi  liati   of the  resi e>4
 t, of the
 United States.  He wanted apologies,
 punishments, and guarantees as his price
 for remaining in Paris, and as an added
 insult, he withdrew his invitation to
 President Eisenhower to visit the Soviet
 Union.
 The height of his insult was reached
 in his effort to i terfere wi   t e e c-
 toralpxnresses_it~,,                            ,' in
 the statement that a new administration
 might have a different method of deal-
 ing with him.  Then he threw into it,
 for good measure, some very insulting
 remarks about the President of the
 United States.
 I do not believe that Mr. Khrushchev
 will be successful in influencing the peo-
 ple of this country with respect to their
 selection of candidates for high office.  I
 rather anticipate also that Mr. Khru-
 shchev will learn before he is through
 that the people of this country are very
 well united in their method of dealing
 with him.  Certainly this effort on his
 part to interfere with our electoral
 process was a gratuitous insult of the
 first order.

 nec ion,  Mr.  Khrushchev had                   better
 think twice.
 Millions and millions of people in this
 country and all over the world prayed
 that the summit conference would re-
 solve issues or, at least, take an impor-
 tant step in that direction.  It is still
 the hope of many, including myself, that
 the summit talks will continue, although
 certainly a heavy cloud has been cast
 over that hope.
 What can possibly be the. motives of
 a man who deliberately seeks to wreck
 the conference on its very first day?
 Clearly this is not something that was
 thought out on the moment.  It was
 preconceived in Moscow.  The reaction
 of thinking people in the free world can
 only be one of utter disgust.  It is ob-
 vious that Mr. Khrushchev wants the
 cold. war to continue.  The world now
 knows that his pious pleas for peace were
 as phony as an aluminum half dollar.
 As for his crude withdrawal of his in-
 vitation to the President, this is one of
 the rare cases in history when inhos-
 pitality has been used as a weapon.
 Khrushchev apparently is disposed to
 feel that he cannot run the risk, not of
 hostile demonstrations, as he has indi-
 cated, but friendly demonstrations to-
 ward our President by the Russian peo-
 ple.  In the light of President Eisen-
 hower's triumphal visits to India and
 Pakistan and South America, this is per-
 haps understandable.
 The militarially realistic Soviet people
 cannot be sold the idea that s  m  is
 the acts gL,gvil,. as Khrushc ev   as
 put it.                    i cc ?tca
 policy, pf th           '   ment. Fun-
 darrientalty  is is not a positive move on
 Khrushchev's part; it is a negative move,
 and a move of retreat. The thin armor
 plate of moral indignation he has as-
 sumed does not become this man whose
 past does not bear complete unveiling.

 Mr. President, the world knows that
 President Eisenhower is a truly dedi-
 cated man of peace, more dedicated to
 the maintenance and preservation and
 furtherance of peace in this world than
 any other individual, and that he has
 done as much as he honorably can do to
 hold the summit together.  If the sum-
 mit disintegrates, the responsibility will
 rest squarely upon Nikita Khrushchev.
 Mr. SCOTT.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. KEATING. I yield.
 Mr. SCOTT.  I thank the distin-
 gi  hl'ff"S'elM r from New York for
 yielding to me. Does not the Senator
 agree with me that Mr. Khrushchev is
 fighting a certain intangible which he
 cannot beat, and which he can never
 hope to beat?  I refer to the fact that
 he has indicated he does not want Presi-
 dent Eisenhower to appear in Russia. A
 statement given out by his aides strongly
 indicates that his purpose is to take a
 chance on the next election, and there-
 by hope that under those circumstances
 a future President might come to Russia
 under conditions which he thinks would
 be more favorable to him; whereas the
 next President of the United States, no
 matter who he is, will go not only as
 President, if he goes to Russia, but also
 as the symbol of something that Mr.
 Khrushchev cannot lick, and that is the
 symbol of freedom.  If he goes, he will
 be cheered. If he goes, the hearts of the
 Russian people will go out to him, as the
 people of the satellite countries gave
 their hearts to the leaders of America,
 and as the peoples of tl- a world gave
 their hearts to Eisenhower. They stand
 and cheer and they stand and weep,
 because they see before them the symbol
 of the free peoples of the earth.
 Does not the Senator agree with me
 that what Mr. Khru hchev is hoping for
 ,hat snmannP wi            Q    e hook,
 from which he cannot extricate himself
 because he is the head of a slave system?
 Mr. KEATING.  What the Senator
 says is true. Khrushchev will be fooled.
 In the first place, the most insulting
 move I have ever heard of is the attempt
 to tell the American people whom they
 should name or what party they should
 name to control the destinies of this
 country.
 Secondly, I do not believe it will be of
 any,effect in this country, because our
 Nation stands united, no matter who our
 President is. If the President ever went
 to Russia, he would go with the backing
 of the American people.  Certainly we
 do not propose to let Mr. Khrushchev
 be successful in indicating who he thinks
 that President should be.
 He may not like the present adminis-
 tration, and may not, as he has indicated
 very clearly, like the President or the
 Vice President personally.  However, he
 will find, I anticipate, that whoever is the
 President, he will stand four-square for
 the things we believe in.
 Mr. SCOTT.  Exactly.        My point is
 that whether the President is a Demo-
 crat or a Republican, Mr. Khrushchev
 has nothing to hope for in that direction,
 if he seeks to divide us or to smother the
 symbol of freedom and equality and cou-
 rageous defense of those fundamental
 principles which our next President,
 whoever he may be, will surely exemplify.
 Mr. KEATING.  I am sure that is so.
 I appreciate the remarks of the distin-

 RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF
 EDUCATION, YONKERS, N.Y.
 Mr. KEATING.  Mr. President, I want
 to call attention this morning to a reso-
 lution of the board of education of
 Yonkers, N.Y., concerning the excis
 tax on general telephone service.' Th3
 resolution provides for the levying of
 this tax at the State level for educa-
 tional purposes.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that this resolution be printed in
 the RECORD, and appropriately referred.
 There being no objection, the reso-
 lution was referred to the Committee on
 Finance, and ordered to be printed In
 the RECORD, as follows:
 Whereas on April 8, 1960, Governor Rocke-
 feller signed into law chapter 418 of the
 Laws of 1960; and
 Whereas this chapter authorizes the im-
 position of a tax for school purposes on
 general telephone services on a countywide
 basis; and
 Whereas additional funds are urgently
 needed by the board of education of the
 city of Yonkers to provide more adequately
 for the educational program in the public
 schools, and
 Whereas the city of Yonkers is presently
 within $10,326.14 of its constitutional tax
 limit of 2 percent, and is thereby restricted in
 providing additional funds for the educa-
 tional program, and
 Whereas the board of education of the city
 of Yonkers, in order to serve more adequately
 the educational needs of the more than 25,-
 300 pupils enrolled in the Yonkers public
 schools, wishes to utilize the revenues from
 this source beginning September 1, 1960, in
 the event that the Federal Government does
 not reimpose this tax: Now, therefore, be it
 Resolved, That the board of education of
 the city of Yonkers, pursuant to chapter 418
 of the Laws of 1960, hereby requests the

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 place the land at another point and also
 replace the building which' had been on the
 ceded land.
 The services not only refuse to yield real
 estate but persistently try to do more with
 what they have.  The Army recently pro-
 posed reactivating its nearly idle Cleveland
 and Lima, Ohio, ordinance plants and its
 Detroit arsenal.  The Cleveland plant was to
 be  used to produce lightweight  combat
 vehicles, and the Detroit and Lima plants to
 produce medium-weight combat vehicles-all
 satisfactorily produced by private firms. The
 Army argued its plants could produce the
 vehicles more cheaply and better. Top Penta-
 gon officials vetoed this plan as too sweeping,
 but expect the Army to come back shortly
 with a more modest proposal.
 When the services do get ready to dispose
 of  installations, they frequently run into
 stormy opposition.  Local merchants like the
 military payrolls.  Southern Wisconsin took
 months to quiet down not long ago when the
 Air Force decided to discontinue construction
 of the new Bong Airbase and dispose of the
 land.  Right now Maryland and Virginia
 Congressmen of both parties are teaming up
 again, as in past years, to pressure the Navy
 into revising plans to cut back Washington's
 naval weapons plant with its 5,500 employees.
 The plant makes a variety of missile control
 devices, antisub gear and other items which
 management specialists agree could be bet-
 ter produced elsewhere.
 PROBLEM OF DUPLICATION
 Elimination of military duplication is con-
 sidered another huge area of potential sav-
 ings, and here too there is marked resistance
 to change within each service.  Each has its
 own medical, communications, supply, con-
 tracting, auditing, and weather forecasting
 systems-and each aims to keep them as long
 as it can.
 A congressional staff study recently esti-
 mated Armed Forces medical- costs at over
 $400 million a year, with some 185 hospitals
 in the United States and 90 overseas.  The
 hospitals have a total capacity of about
 105,000 beds and average occupancy of less
 than 40 percent. They employ about 145,000
 people, about 75 percent military and 25
 percent civilian.
 "It is difficult to conceive," the report said,
 "of an area that would more readily lend it-
 self to consolidation than medical care.  The
 conditions which require medical service, the
 facilities for treatment, and the professional
 standards for medical personnel are virtually
 indistinguishable among the services."
 At Denver, a 350-bed hospital at Lowry Air
 Force Base keepsonly 100 beds in use to care
 for an average load of 51 patients.  Six miles
 away, Fitzsimons Army Hospital, with 2,078
 beds, operates about 900 of them to care for
 an average of 684 patients.
 At Langley Air Force Base in Virginia, a
 217-bed hospital keeps 100 beds in use to care
 for 62 patients, on the average.  Six miles
 away, at the Army's Fort Monroe, there is a
 141-bed hospital, in which 35 beds are main-
 tained to care for an average 20-patient load.
 DEPOTS DO SAME JOB
 Supply distribution is an area of rampant
 duplication, experts say.  in the Southeast-
 ern United States, one congressional investi-
 gation has found, the Army's Atlanta and
 Memphis depots, the Air Force's mobile depot,
 the Marine Corps supply center in Albany,
 Ga., and four Navy stock points are all sup-
 plying their respective services with the same
 supplies.  Army supply' operates through
 seven different technical Services-Ordnance,
 Chemical,- and the like-each with specific
 types of material assigned. it.  This results
 in no less than 24 separate Army supply con-
 trol  points           in  the  continental  United
 States-several for each of the 7 services-
 when 5 to 8 could handle the job nicely,
 according to one management expert.
 Military overbuying, lack of standardiza-
 tion, bad inventorying, and slow and costly
 surplus disposal habits long have been fa-
 vorite congressional targets.  Some progress
 has been made, budget scanners say, but
 much remains to be done.
 This year the Navy has begun buying extra
 plane engines on the basis of having a 150-
 day supply in the pipeline; previously, it
 insisted on a 210-day supply.  Though the
 shorter cycle would. save millions, it took the
 General Accounting Office, Congress' spend-
 ing guardian, two long battles to get the
 Navy to change.
 Attempts to standardize military footwear
 have so far eliminated 752 different types and
 finishes, but 339 types remain. Pentagon ex-
 perts recently attempted to prescribe a black
 low men's shoe as standard for all services.
 The Marine Corps insisted on keeping its ma-
 hogany shoe because it matched the bill on
 the Marine caps, and the Navy insisted on
 keeping a brown shoe for its fliers because it
 has been  traditional-ever since late I
 World War 11.
 Over 1.3 million common supply items, ac-
 cording to congressional investigators, differ
 among the services in such relatively minor
 respects as color, finish, or even just names.
 Defense officials estimate they could  save
 about $1 million a year in management ex-
 penses alone-not counting procurement sav-
 ings from placing larger consolidated or-
 ders-for every 1,000 items eliminated from
 the supply system.
 The Defense Department has been bally-
 hooing its single manager system as the an-
 swer to many of its buying problems. Under
 this system, one service buys all supplies
 of one kind for all the services; the Navy
 does all the fuel purchasing, for instance.
 But management experts say it's only a step
 in the right direction.
 For one thing, the Pentagon is installing
 the system very slowly; seven supply cate-
 gories were put under single managers in 1955
 and 1956, but only two more minor categories
 have been added since then. More important,
 though, the single manager has authority
 only to consolidate and place the orders he's
 given.  He has  no  power to standardize
 equipment, redistribute excess stocks, or cut
 back orders.
 "If we can extend its use, and raise it to
 a higher level of command where it can really
 accomplish more, the single manager system
 might some day pave the way for a separate
 single supply service," one would-be reformer
 wistfully asserts.
 FRINGE BENEFITS
 Perhaps one of the touchiest areas of theo-
 retical saving in the entire military establish-
 ment is the vast number of "fringe" benefits
 which military personnel now enjoy. Many
 have grown out of all proportion to the origi-
 nal intent, and now seem beyond uprooting.
 Commissaries are a prime example. These
 food supermarkets were supposed to be set up
 where there were no private facilities selling
 at reasonable prices convenient to the post.
 Now there are over 250 commissaries in the
 continental United States, many in cities
 such as Washington and New York.
 The right to buy there is now extended not
 only to people living on the posts, but to mili-
 tary families off the post, reserve and retired
 personnel, and Public Health officials.  Less
 than 20 percent of the people holding permits
 to buy at U.S. commissaries now live on the
 base where the store is located.  In Washing.
 ton, customers at the Walter Reed Army Hos-
 pital commissary include such off-base types
 as a National Institutes of Health neurologist
 and a World War n: Navy nurse, now a reserv-
 ist, who is the mother of seven children and
 extremely unlikely ever to return to active
 duty.
 The Government not only employs 9,000
 people to man the commissaries, but supplies
 the buildings, equipument, light, heat and
 other services.  The customers pay only the
 original cost of the food, plus transportation
 charges, and a highly inadequate 3 percent
 markup to cover all else.  Military experts
 figure the annual running subsidy is $75 mil-
 lion, not counting depreciation on the build-
 ings and equipment.
 The Government also provides medical care
 and hospitalization for military men and
 their dependents, including veterinary care
 for pets; a retirement plan completely Gov-
 ernment-financed; quarters, often including
 all or much of the furniture; in many areas,
 free libraries and even bus service to public
 schools; in many cases, subsidized laundry
 service;  free personal travel on military
 planes and ships if space is available; and
 burial in Government-owned cemeteries, in-
 cluding plots for pets.

 istration official, "is marked by growing so-

 northern half of Alaska-the entire area
 north of the Yukon and Porcupine Riv-

 ing most of the Alaska Peninsula and
 the 900 miles of Aleutian Islands-had
 to be set aside as an area which could
 be withdrawn wholly or in part for de-
 fense purposes. This is an area of over
 225,000 square miles, an area larger than
 California, and almost as large as Cali-
 fornia and Oregon combined.
 I have here in the Chamber a map

 able colleague [Mr.  BARTLETT],  which
 shows the Eisenhower line dividing Alas-
 ka practically in half.  All that area

 tremendous extent of that area.
 Alaskans, and the Alaska delegation,
 saw no justification for this proposal, but
 were told officially that this would be a
 prerequisite to getting Presidential ap-
 proval of the Alaska statehood bill. So
 we agreed, and section 10 and subsec-
 tions A, B, C, D, and E thereof of the
 statehood act provided for the drawing
 of a so-called Eisenhower line, osten-
 sibly in the interest of national security,
 in this strategic area.  There has been
 nothing like it in previous American his-
 tory. The constitutionality of this pro-
 vision was challenged during the Senate
 debate on the statehood bill. But these
 objections were overborne by the as-
 sumption that such a huge potential ex-
 cision from the 49th State was deemed
 indispensable for the future security of
 our Nation by the Commander in Chief.
 Now, in effect, the offensive and defensive
 strength of northern Alaska is to be
 largely withdrawn.

 tions. of the Eisenhower administration
 be reconciled?  Let us not delude our-
 selves that Alaska is now adequately de-

 other Pearl Harbor.  A few months ago,
 our excellent theater commander in chief
 of the Alaskan command, Lt. Gen. Frank
 Armstrong, called attention to the total
 lack of missile bases in Alaska.  He felt
 so strongly on the subject that he ex-
 pressed this view publicly.                                But his
 warning and plea were Ignored by the
 administration. The Pentagon informed
 us the other day that he was not even
 consulted about this latest proposed
 slash in Alaska's fighter strength.

 any Ililss a ms a a 1'oiis there to protect

 or the offensive sorties which may follow.
 Twenty-five years ago a great and
 courageous Army officer, a pioneer flyer,
 the late William "Billy" Mitchell, testi-
 fied before a House Committee on Mili-
 tary Affairs:
 Alaska Is the most central place In the
 world for aircraft and that is true either of
 Europe, Asia, or North America.  I believe in
 the future he who holds Alaska will hold the
 world, and I think it is the most important
 strategic place in the world.
 Billy Mitchell's great wisdom about the
 importance of aircraft in        war was
 scorned at the time by the high military
 commands of both the Army and Navy.
 Indeed Billy Mitchell, for his vision, for
 his courage, and his unflinching deter-
 mination  to  safeguard  the                               military
 strength of our country, was crucified on
 what we might call a cross of brass.  He
 was, in fact, cashiered and driven out
 of the Army. But after his death, his
 vision about the importance of the air-
 plane as an instrument of combat came
 to be appreciated. The high command
 of that day was proved wrong.  It was
 wrong, however, at a time when the
 consequences of its shortsigtedness and
 its wrongness were not as they are and
 could be now. We did not then face a
 ruthless, determined, and unprecedent-
 edly powerful totalitarian enemy which
 makes no secret of its purpose to conquer
 the free world and to substitute its Com-
 munist way of life for ours.  Our rela-
 tions wi  _Russia  whichy'er
 esl vicu_?.-..Our
 guard, are m%ej            iAaped by
 the r        2 episo a and what has
 since develope in Paris.
 Nor was Billy Mitchell's wisdom about
 the strategic value of Alaska appre-
 ciated, despite the pleas of Alaskans,
 notably those of our late Delegate in
 Approved For Release 2004/05/13 : CIA-RDP90T00782R000100050001-8
 NGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 the House, Anthony J. Dimond, and,
 consequently, Alaska's defenselessness
 caused it to be the only area in North
 America during World War H that was
 invaded and for a time held in part by
 the enemy. There was some subsequent
 improvement thereafter in Alaska's de-
 fenses, notably because of Alaskans'
 protests, including the protests of our
 succeeding delegate in the Congress, my
 present colleague [Mr. BARTLETT), but
 for a long time the inadequacy of Alas-
 kan defenses continued, and they have
 never been adequate. As General "Hap"
 Arnold wrote in his book, "Global Mis-
 sion:"
 Through to this day, Alaska has never
 received the attention in national defense
 planning that it deserves.
 And further:
 Alaska had always been and no matter
 what happened in any theater of war, always
 remained, to me privately, a high priority.
 But we were never able to get the money
 gr allocations for the air force that we really
 needed there to give us the kind of bases
 we required then-and need more than ever
 now.
 Those words, although written 11
 years ago, are certainly no less and
 possibly more true today.
 Mr. President, there was, as I have
 said, for a time an improvement in the
 defenses of Alaska, but they have never
 been sufficient.  At the same time, we
 have been spending billions of dollars
 on bases all over the world.  Many of
 these are, figuratively speaking, built on
 quicksand.  Some of them we hold at
 the dubious pleasure of dictators.  And
 even in the free world, our tenure of
 some bases, which have cost billions of
 dollars, is most uncertain. I do not wish
 to . embarrass the administration by
 citing these examples specifically, as I
 could, or going into detail about some
 of the strategems and the expenditures-
 if we can use that polite euphemism-
 which have had to be employed to per-
 suade other governments to permit us
 to keep our bases within their borders.
 By contrast what we build in Alaska,
 on American soil, is not built on politi-
 cal quicksand, not amid peoples of
 doubtful sympathy with our cause, not
 in areas subject to the dangers of sub-
 version and sabotage, not in countries
 whose tolerance of our presence must be
 ever reconfirmed  and rebought,  but
 instead is built on the solid rock of
 American terrain, amid an American
 population militantly loyal, patriotic,
 and alert. So we have just another ex-
 ample of this Administration's double
 standard, which I have pointed out re-
 peatedly in other aspects of the so-called
 mutual security program.  While we
 spend lavishly abroad on establishments
 of dubious validity and permanence, we
 are jeopardizing security within our
 own borders, to the detriment of our
 safety and of our economy, by a budg-
 etary policy that is the height of folly.
 To return to the latest blow at our
 actual defensive strength in Alaska, there
 are: some strange contradictions and
 anomalies In the Air Force's action.
 Testifying before the Subcommittee on
 Military Construction of the Senate
 Armed Services Committee as recently as
 April 13 last, less than 1 month after
 which we were told of the liquidation of
 the entire fighter force at Ladd Air Force
 Base, Under Secretary Charyk testified
 that subsequent to the Air Force submis-
 sion of its fiscal 1961 construction pro-
 gram, major changes In the previously
 programed air defense system were ap-
 proved, and he named three necessary
 revisions.  They were,. first, a more time-
 ly completion of an improved defense
 against air-breathing enemy weapons;
 second, an acceleration of systems de-
 signed to provide ballistic missile warn-
 ing; and, third-and kindly note this, Mr.
 President-an improved deterrent pos-
 ture.     -
 Just how Is our deterrent posture,
 which Under Secretary Charyk says is
 one of the Air Force's objectives, im-
 proved by the elimination of the entire
 fighter force north of the Alaska Range,
 and nearly 50 percent of our total fighter
 force in Alaska-for at Elmendorf Field,
 300 miles to the south, is the balance of
 our Alaska fighter force consisting of 33
 fighters?
 And even more amazing-in view of
 the Air Force's proposed action-is the
 statement, a few sentences later, by
 Under Secretary Charyk, to be found on
 page 319 of the printed hearings:
 To complete the picture, we also plan a
 revised  and  improved  fighter-interceptor
 force.
 Just how is the total elimination of our
 fighter force at our northernmost air-
 base and nearly half of Alaska's present
 total fighter force, a revised and im-
 proved fighter-interceptor force?
 Either Under Secretary Charyk had
 adopted "Newspeak," in which words
 mean the opposite of what they say, or a
 fundamental change in Air Force pro-
 gram and policy had again occurred in
 the less than 30 days between Under
 Secretary Charyk's appearance before
 the committee and our delegation's visit
 to the Pentagon on May 10.  The Nation
 is entitled to an explanation of a defense
 policy that is so radically changed within
 a few weeks that it is changed once after
 the submission of the 1961 construction
 authorization  program  and  changed
 again after that program Is testified to
 before the Senate committee.
 Moreover, later that same day, April
 13, just a little over a month ago, Colonel
 Parkhill, presented by General Curtin
 as the Air Force spokesman for the line
 items, testified as follows:
 The Alaskan Air Command Is responsible
 for providing early warning in the Alaskan
 area in case of attack against the United
 States.  It is also responsible for the air
 defense of Alaska, and furnished operational
 and certain logistical support for the Stra-
 tegic Air Command, the Military Air Trans-
 port Service, the Command of the Alaskan
 Sea Frontier, and the U.S. Army. To provide
 for the accomplishment of these missions,
 the command supports three major. opera-
 tional bases, Elelson, Elmendorf, and Ladd.
 So, less than a month earlier, Ladd
 Field was referred to as one of the three
 operational Air Force bases in Alaska,
 but now it is reduced to an aero medical
 laboratory, a hospital, and some housing
 which it is hoped the Army in Alaska
 may be induced to occupy, although its

 forces are not to be increased by a single
 soldier.
 Mr. President, even before the world-
 shaking events that have come to us
 from Paris, even before the prospects
 of improvement in internatioanl tension
 had been rudely shattered at the summit,
 the discussion on the floor of the Senate
 last Friday, in connection with the adop-
 tion of the military construction bill,
 shows how little justification there was
 for these rapid changes by the Air Force.
 Let me point out that in the new authori-
 zation for the military construction pro-
 gram totaling $1,074 million, the Air
 Force received well over half-some $726
 million-far more than the Army, Navy,
 and other parts of the Defense Estab-
 lishment received.
 The able junior Senator from Missis-
 sippi [Mr. STENNIS], chairman of the
 subcommittee of the Armed Services
 Committee, who is in charge of the bill,
 stated:
 Prior to the time the committee could
 complete consideration of the bill * * * the
 Department of the Air Force again drastically
 revised its air defense planning, although no
 testimony had been presented to indicate
 any major change in the air defense threat
 since the submission of the revised plan In
 June 1959.
 And Senator STENNIS added:
 The committee has not been able to recon-
 cile the cancellation of these long-range
 ground-to-air defense missile sites located on
 the perimeter of our country while continu-
 ing those of shorter range primarily designed
 for last-minute protection of our cities and
 military installations.
 And he says further:
 Most of us felt all the time that too much
 money was being put in ground-to-air mis-
 siles at the expense of the affirmative or
 purely offensive weapons.
 In view of all this, and much else that
 I will not bother to repeat, for it can be
 found in the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD of
 last Friday, Senator STENNIS reported
 that the committee has requested that
 the revised air defense plan be again re-
 viewed in detail by the Joint Chiefs of
 Staff and the Secretary of Defense.
 And finally, Senator STENNIS  said-
 and this was last Friday:
 The committee is still very uncertain as to
 exactly what the present situation is and
 certainly dissatisfied with the situation in
 its present state.
 I do not wonder that it is dissatisfied.
 The entire Congress and the American
 people should be dissatisfied.
 Still later in the discussion, our dis-
 tinguished colleague from the State of
 South Dakota, FRANCIS CASE, a member
 of the committee, gave his view that the
 bill-to quote his words-is "to some
 extent, out of date"; and he stated that
 this was the case "because our military
 posture has been built around certain
 deployments abroad and because the
 present situation inevitably will affect
 the availability of some of the bases and
 fields that have been developed."
 S   for CASE was referrin?to the con-
 sequences o  '1-ie disco rv n~'
 mission over Russia.  But his       nt
 took place..belgre, eta, Khrushc ev had
 virtually , ruptured his relations with the
 President and with the summit meeting.
 tion on the part of the members of the
 Armed Services Committee last Friday,
 there is infinitely more cause for even
 greater dissatisfaction and for immedi-
 ate revision, and revision upward, now.
 Mr. President, we do not, to date, know
 what foreign bases the United States will
 be allowed to retain by the government
 of the countries in which they are lo-
 cated.  We do not k>ia4w  het ,
 that we cap    cert   of is that what-
 ever bases? whatever offensive or de-
 fensive strength we have in Alaskwill
 cnntir only our militarave the
 vision and understanding to reverse their
 incredible latest decision.  Indeed, they
 should not merely carry out the plan
 of a month ago of replacing the 25 F-89
 fighters at Ladd with more modern
 fighters, but actually by adding to the
 present  fighter  strength  additional
 fighter planes.
 I call upon the Armed Services Com-
 mittees of both Houses and the Appropri-
 ations Committee immediately to look
 into this situation and to insist that the
 Air Force, at the very least, reverse its
 position and restore the fighter squadron
 to the northernmost American air base
 and the American air base nearest to
 Russia.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent to have printed in the RECORD at
 this point in my remafks, the story of
 our meeting at the Pentagon with the
 Air Force officials, as published in the
 Anchorage Daily Times, and written by
 Mr. A. Robert Smith, its Washington cor-
 respondent;, as well as two editorials from
 the Fairbanks News-Miner, from the is-
 sues of May 12 and May 13, respectively,

 Our Defenses?" and "Are We Expend-

 ALASKAN                   DEFENSES  CUT;  STATE  SAID "No
 LONGER                    KEY  OUTPOST"-25  FIGHTERS AT
 LADD To LEAVE; SOLONS SHOCKED
 (By A. Robert Smith)
 WASHINGTON.-Air   Force   officials   have
 bluntly told the Alaska congressional dele-
 gation they no longer regard Alaska as a key
 defense outpost of the free world.
 This was revealed today at a press confer-
 ence held jointly  by Senators                                                         BARTLETT,
 GRUENING and Representative RIVERS to dis-
 close the outcome of a length meeting they
 had late  ey,tg dot th= eePeniTf  "'t'RM9F
 1. The 25 fghter-interceptor aircraft of the
 449th Squadron at Ladd Air Force Base will
 all be removed from Alaska, starting in Aug-
 ust and ending'by January 1.
 2. The Army may take over use of Ladd,
 but this will not mean any increase in Army
 strength in Alaska, only some shifting.
 mended last year by Lt. Gen. Frank A. Arm-
 strong, the Alaska commander.
 4. The upshot of these developments Is
 that Alaska's defensive strength will be re-
 duced 25 percent, according to Gen. Curtis
 LeMay, deputy chief of staff.
 But BARTLETT contended it means a reduc-
 tion of nearly 50 percent, inasmuch as the
 cut of 25 fighters at Ladd leaves only 33
 fighters in Alaska, all based at Elmendorf
 Air Force Base.
 5. When asked by GRUENING whether he
 didn't agree with Gen. Billy Mitchell's esti-
 mate of the strategic importance of Alaska
 for defense, LeMay replied: "Frankly, no."
 BARTLETT termed these disclosures "dread-
 fully shocking" considering the state of
 world affairs.
 "Peace hasn't been established with Rus-
 sia," he added.
 GRUENING and his colleagues vowed to op-
 pose these plans by attempting to arouse
 public and congressional sentiment against
 them, but they indicated little hope of suc-
 cess In overturning this military decision.
 The. verdict has been made, the military
 officials said.
 "This is obviously an economy move," ob-
 served GRUENING, "directed by the Bureau
 of the Budget."  When he asked why they
 didn't out out fat and waste instead of re-
 ducing strength, LeMay said he "didn't think
 the American people wanted to cut out fat."
 In support of its supposition that this was
 an economy move, the delegation noted that
 not long ago the Air Force announced it
 would substitute a superior, faster aircraft,
 the VooDoo, for F-89 fighters at Ladd which
 are becoming obsolete.
 This indicated to the Alaskans that "up
 until recently it was thought militarily wise
 to give Alaska improved interceptors, but
 that now it is no longer necessary to have
 them at all.
 This unexplained shift was thought by the
 delegation to have been forced by budgetary
 limitations which caused the Air Force to
 take its choice rather than to deploy as
 much strength, as it might have wished.
 LeMay said the Air Force constantly bucks
 up against resistance to reducing its opera-
 tions by congressional pressure such as the
 Alaskans put on, reported Gruening, in-
 ferring the General presumed they were in-
 terested only in the effect of the cut on the
 economy of Fairbanks.
 "It isn't just the money, It's that those
 people are awfully close to Siberia and they
 are bound to get uneasy," said BARTLETT.
 The delegation said it would have hurt the
 Alaska economy and the morale of all Alaska.
 BARTLETT reported the Army is still study-
 ing the possibility of using Ladd, but no de-
 cision is expected until July 15.  The Air
 Force plans to continue using some of the
 housing at the base for personnel at Eiel-
 son Air Base, 26 miles away, because Ladd's
 facilities are superior. The Arctic Aero Medi-
 cal Lab at Ladd will not be affected.
 The Alaskans were visibly incredulous at
 the news they were bluntly handed by the
 Pentagon, and particularly by the expressed
 attitude of LeMay, the tough, cigar-smoking
 former  commander  of  the  Strategic  Air
 Command.
 RIvERs  said he  pointed  out    Armstrong
 had feared the threat of 27 missile bases Rus.
 sia had built  in nearby Siberia.   LeMay,
 he reported, said he didn't think Russia is
 doing much there. Asked what they thought
 LeMay meant,  BARTLETT  blurted out:
 "God knows what he meant by anything
 he said."
 BARTLETT  recalled Armstrong's plea for
 missiles and more defense for Alaska.  He

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 Result of this action, in plain language, Is
 that Ladd and Fairbanks will be left as sit-
 ting ducks out in the middle of no man's
 land, between the Soviet armed forces con-
 centrated in strength a relative few miles
 north and. west, and America's shrunken far-
 thest north defense past at Elmendorf Air
 Force Base to the south.
 It is ironical that on the very day an-
 nouncement 1s made of America's first-line
 defense post is to be wiped out, Soviet Pre-
 mier Khrushchev baldly indicates a worsen-
 ing relationship with the United States with
 a clearcut insult to President Dwight D.
 Eisenhower.
 Taking into account Premier Khrushchev's
 current  statements,  circumstances  would
 seem to indicate strengthening of our de-
 fense posts closest to Russia as the Soviets
 maintain their belligerent status.
 Public announcement America is cutting
 defensive  strength  of  Alaska's formidable
 air patrol in the far North hardly seems the
 most effective way to soften Russia's present
 hard-nosed  belligerency.     Why should the
 bully slow his blustering when his proposed
 opponent is running away?  Is blustering
 Khrushchev going to be intimidated when
 he sees our air defense retreating several
 hundred miles? We think not.
 In yesterday's announcement, General Le-
 May, longtime plain-talking boss of SAC,
 Air Force offensive arm, took a position dia-
 metrically opposed to many other able top
 Air Force commanders.  From the time of
 Gen. Billy Mitchell to today's Alaska top
 commander, Lt. Gen. Frank A. Armstrong,
 Alaska has been given top priority in world
 air strategy.
 General LeMay's present position appears
 to be a casual writeoff of Alaska's strategic
 importance in defense of the United States.
 We disagree with General LeMay.
 We particularly disagree when results of
 his decision will not only reduce defensive
 strength of  America's first line of defense
 by approximately 50 percent, but will in the
 process leave Fairbanks and Ladd Air Force
 Base sitting out in the middle of no man's
 land like ducks in a shooting gallery.
 said LeMay brushed it off as just the desires
 of a theater commander who had been over-
 ruled.
 Was Armstrong consulted about the wis-
 dom of the elimination of 25 fighters?
 "Probably not,"  BM TLETT  quoted LeMay
 as answering.
 How will the mission of the 449th Squad-
 ron be handled after its removal?
 "We can operate from the U.S. West Coast
 with long-range airplanes just as well as from
 Alaska,"  BARTLETT  quoted LeMay as say-
 ing.
 LeMay was asked what he thought would
 happen if Soviet bombers came over Alaska,
 as Armstrong envisioned in a public speech
 last year in which he said the Russians
 could knock out Alaska and move on to hit
 deep into the interior of the other States.
 LeMay was reported to have replied he
 didn't think Soviet attacking aircraft would
 strike the United States via Alaska.  He said
 that would be foolish because they would
 risk earlier detection on that route, pre-
 sumably by the DEW line radar network.
 BARTLETT  said LeMay stated he thinks
 Elelson, the base from which SAC bombers
 are ready to strike back if necessary, is now
 of subordinate Importance If Alaska is not
 of great importance any longer in the de-
 fense strategy of the United States.
 GRUENING observed with irony that the
 White House just a few years ago thought
 Alaska so Important for defense that it in-
 sisted that the whole northern section be
 set aside for possible military use as a con-
 dition for granting statehood.
 BARTLETT observed, "This process of whit-
 tling down Alaska's defenses" has been un-
 derway for several years, bit by bit.
 GRUENING also questioned the wisdom of
 cutting back on domestic bases while de-
 pending upon bases in foreign lands where
 America may have only a tenuous hold. He
 said LeMay brushed this off by saying that
 foreign bases were important.
 LeMay also told the delegation he thought
 conditions  were unfavorable in Alaska for
 military operations because the weather goes
 down to 60? below zero and the transporta-
 tion costs are unusually high.
 GRUENING scoffed at both contentions. He
 noted that when Alaska Steamship Co. re-
 cently announced increased freight rates,
 Alaskans were unable to get the armed serv-
 ices to join them in protesting this in-
 crease.
 BARTLETT, a member of the Senate Armed
 Services  Committee, was particularly dis-
 turbed by these developments.  Last fall he
 toured military bases along the Pacific rim
 from Alaska to Japan and returned con-
 vinced that U.S. defenses needed boosting
 rather than reducing.  His pleas to that
 effect have fallen on deaf ears here.

 Is Now THE TIME To REDUCE OUR DEFENSES?
 Yesterday's  News-Miner had  two  front
 page  headlines: "Military Cuts Strength
 Here," followed by "Khrushchev May Not
 Want Visit From Ike."
 The first headline preceded an announce-
 ment by Gen. Curtis E. LeMay, Vice Chief of
 Staff of the U.S. Air Force, that one of the
 two fighter squadrons stationed in Alaska
 would be eliminated within the next few
 months; that before the year is out, the
 449th Fighter Group, manning America's and
 Alaska's farthest north defense post, will
 move south.
 The fighter base closest to Russia will be
 abandoned as a fighter base. America's first
 line of defense will retreat southward sev-
 eral hundred miles.
 Ladd Air Force Base, home of the 449th,
 and Ladd's host city of Fairbanks will no
 longer be the first line of defense.
 [From the Fairbanks (Alaska) Daily News-
 Miner, May 13, 1960]
 ARE WE EXPENDABLE?
 Gen. Curtis LeMay, Deputy Chief of Staff
 of the Air Force, would have us believe
 that, militarily, Alaska is expendable.
 He is quoted as saying that Alaska is no
 longer of great importance in the defense
 strategy of the United States.  This state-
 ment was given to Alaska's congressional
 delegation in justification of the Air Force's
 plans to cut the strength of Ladd Air Force
 Base by withdrawing the 449th Fighter In.
 terceptor Squadron.
 The action comes at a most inopportune
 time-a time when world tensions have
 reached S. high peak-a time when every
 facet of defense needs strengthening in-
 stead of weakening.
 It is hard to believe that General LeMay's
 dogmatic view on Alaska's strategic im-
 portance  is  shared  widely  in  military
 circles.
 Starting with Gen. Billy Mitchell's evalua-
 tion of the importance of Alaska as key to
 the continent's defense to similar views ex-
 pressed more recently by Lt. Gen. Frank A.
 Armstrong, Alaska's present military com-
 mander, Alaska's vital role in the military
 picture has never been minimised.
 On March  17,  1958, Franklin L. Orth,
 Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Army
 told the Anchorage Chamber of Commerce
 he considers Alaska "the keystone in the
 arch of our defensive system."
 Orth added: "Alaska has now become the
 strongest defensive link in our outpost of
 freedom."
 May 17
 Lt. Gen. J. H. Atkinson, formerly com-
 mander in chief of the Alaskan command,
 told the Alaska Chamber of Commerce: "As
 we all know, Alaska is an outpost of our
 continental defense, and I cannot overem-
 phasize its importance in the strategic pic-
 ture.  It is a shoulder of the Polar Basin,
 that most critical area which separates us
 from Siberia and from the heartland of
 Russia itself."
 In a later speech, General Atkinson de-
 clared:  "It is logical to assume that if
 Alaska is a desirable location strategically
 from which to fly manned aircraft against
 enemy targets, it will be an equally desir-
 able strategic location from which to launch
 unmanned aircraft-namely, missiles."
 General Atkinson based his remarks on the
 contention that range will. always be an
 important factor in that it is cheaper to
 send an aircraft or missile 500 miles than
 5,000 miles.
 It is even more surprising and shocking
 as Senator  BARTLETT  says-that after all
 these views on Alaska's value to American
 defense from responsible military leaders we
 are told that Alaska is expendable.
 It Is even more surprising and shocking
 for taxpayers in Alaska and elsewhere to be
 told that the millions of dollars spent to
 construct strong military outposts in Alaska
 are now construed to be in vain and useless.
 We are not military men, nor have we
 made a thorough study of military concepts
 and strategy.  Yet we cannot see the wis-
 dom of weakening and neutralizing the one
 American State which is closest to America's
 greatest potential enemy.
 We cannot see the wisdom of deciding
 that more than 200,000 Americans In Amer-
 ica's largest State are expendable and ap-
 parently to be left without adequate de-
 fenses.
 We wonder If the Russians would apply
 the same sort of thinking to the vast reaches
 of Siberia, the Kamchatka Peninsula or other
 key points in their defense system?
 We still believe-and we are convinced
 our view would have firm support in mil-
 itary circles-that Alaska is a highly im-
 portant segment of our national military
 picture.  We believe that from a standpoint
 of  continental  defense,  our  Government
 should retain Alaskan defenses at a high
 level.  We believe that instead of stripping
 Alaska of her defenses, these changes should
 be augmented with both missiles and air-
 craft.
 America's national security should not be
 sold down the river so casually.
 To weaken Alaska now would be to create
 an inviting "Pearl Harbor" which would
 prove extremely tempting to our potential
 enemies, and harmful to our national secu-
 rity.
 Is Alaska expendable?  We must disagree
 most emphatically with those who feel it is.
 Alaska is not only expendable-It is Amer-
 ica's most important shield against an ag-
 gressor.
 Loss of Alaska could prove a crippling
 blow to the entire defense of America,

 DEAR MR. SECRETARY: This is to protest, in
 feelings stronger than words can convey, the
 recently disclosed decision of the Air Force
 to deactivate the 449th Fighter Interceptor
 Squadron at the Ladd Air Force Base.
 I do so because of my deep concern with
 the effect of this reduction, predicated, ap-
 parently, solely on budgetary considerations,
 upon the Nation's defenses.
 It is my understanding that the 449th rep-
 resents more than 40 percent of the existing
 fighter strength in Alaska.  With its depar-

 (Mr. MEYERsked and was given

 Mr. MEYER.  Mr. Speaker, I believe
 that`  r rrglltgos Members of this House
 have been and are infringed upon.
 As           .th of the U-;b plane in-

 following on this floor:
 Although the Members of the House have.

 When I subscribed to the following
 oath of office-
 I, WILLIAM. H. -MEYER, do solemnly swear
 that I will support and defend the Consti-

 enemies, foreign and domestic; that I take
 this obligation freely, without any mental
 reservation. or purpose of evasion, and that
 I will well and faithfully discharge the duties,
 of the office'on which I am about to enter.
 So help me Gad=
 I obligated myself to fulfill it and to
 fulfill it regardless of what others might
 do that,might interfere with my obliga-

 in both'bodies leave me confused as to
 what actually has happened in secret.
 Nevertllcless and regardless, I claim that
 my sincere attempt to fulfill my oath of
 office is being obstructed and that this
 is harmful to my country.  I wish to
 quote these excerpts from our Consti-
 tution that relate to my claim.
 To begin with, we are charged with
 the following duties at various points in
 the Constitution of the United States:
 1. * * * Raising revenue.
 2. Lay and collect taxes ? + ? and pro-

 3. To declare war.
 4. To raise and support armies, but no ap-

 5. To make rules for the government and
 regulation of the land and naval forces.
 6. To make all laws which shall be neces-
 sary and proper for carrying into execution
 the foregoing powers, and all other powers
 vested by this Constitution in the Govern-
 ment of the United States, or in any' depart-

 I would like also to quote the following
 excerpts from the Constitution:
 7. No money shall be drawn from the
 Treasury, but in consequence of appropria-
 tions made by law; and a regular statement
 and account of the receipts and expenditures
 of all public money shall be published from
 time to time.

 agreements which had already been
 reached at lower levels; and certainly
 not, as in this most recent summit meet-
 ing, for the purpose of downgrading and
 humiliating the chiefs of staff of the
 Western Powers, and most especially
 President Eisenhower.
 Mr. President, the invitation to visit
 the  Soviet Union extended by Mr.
 Khrushchev to the President of the
 United States has been withdrawn.  I
 understand from the press, though, that
 President Eisenhower intends to visit
 Japan and Korea.  I would hope that,
 in addition to those two countries, at
 that time he will find it possible to visit
 the Republic of the Philippines and the
 Republic of South Vietnam as well.
 I would hope also that what has hap-
 pened at the summit, the breakdown,
 will not be duplicated at Geneva, be-
 cause there at the present time there
 are at least technically three confer-
 ences in being: first, a conference on
 banning nuclear tests ; second, a con-
 ference on disarmament; and third, a
 conference on surprise attack, which I
 understand has been in suspension since
 December 1958.
 I would hope devoutly that these three
 conferences would continue to the end
 that at least in these fields, a,. modicum
 of peace and stability could be achieved
 for the people of the world.
 Mr. President, for the
 1~              slave given particular
 attention to the headlines and to the
 captions on the various columns ex-
 pressing individual opinions as to whdt
 has been taking place in Paris.  It con-
 stitutes something of a fantasy when
 one writes them all in a column, taking
 a good many pages, to see what a myriad
 viewpoint is expressed.
 The comment of the majority leader
 comes as a refreshing note indeed in
 all this confusing complex, because it
 reasserts from the opposition party the
 unity of this country and its determina-
 tion to stand behind the man who is
 endowed  by  the  Constitution  and
 charged by the Constitution with the
 conduct of our foreign policy.  As he
 goes abroad to diplomatic battle, it may
 be a cheering happenstance that the
 ancient. alphabet makers put the letter
 "U" aheadof the letter "V." I have al-
 thought t fiaE "LT"       ity must

 of unity is the kind of thing that ener-
 gizes a national leader when he is thou-
 sands of miles from home, and it makes
 him feel that all of his troops, regard-
 less of their political affiliations, are
 behind him; and I think I can say, for
 the President, to the majority leader
 and his associates, "Thanks for a re-
 freshing message."
 Mr.  ~KU HL Mr. President, that is
 a sp1e           or the minority leader
 to say, and it was also fine for the ma-
 jority leader and for the assistant ma-

 disaster for our beloved country.  It has
 perhaps more than ever knit more

 States.  We do not intend to lose our

 TR  TMENT OF LICENSED PILOTS
 BY'  DERAL AVIATION AGENCY
 Mr. INNGLE.  Mr. President, I con-

 arbitraractions by the Federal Avia-

 of licensed Ivil pilots under the author-
 ity granted,  the FAA Administrator by
 the Congress ?n the Federal Aviation Act
 of 1958. Se tors may recall the tragic
 series of mida  collisions that prompted
 a review of th  then existing Civil Air
 Regulations       resulted in enactment
 by the 85th Coness of the Federal Avi-
 ation Act, which, laced extraordinary
 powers in the ha   s of a single man-
 the Administrator f the Federal Avia-
 tion Agency.  At t                                                                                             t time, I expressed
 concern with regar  to the vast power
 that would be lodge ;an one individual,
 but the act was pa  ed most expedi-

 it may be recalled that estimony before
 the Senate Interstate al Foreign Com-

 the aviation industry to    perate in the
 legislative overhaul of ourVivil Air Reg-
 ulations.  Misgivings we -e voiced by
 aviation leaders concerning certain as-
 pects of the appeal provisions of the
 Federal Aviation Act and the thought
 was expressed that recourse to the Con-
 gress would be utilized if a reasonable
 period of operation indicated that some
 modification or amendment of the act
 was required.

 form and passed by the Congress, a pro-

 LEGISLATIVE PROGRAM
 Mr.  DIRKSEN.  Mr.                President,  I
 should like to inquire, first, of the acting
 majority leader, about the program for
 tomorrow and also for the remainder of
 the week, insofar as it is possible for
 him to inform the Senate now.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, in
 response to the question asked by the
 distinguished minority leader, I must
 admit that I do not have too much in-
 formation available.            But, as of now, it
 is the intention to have the Senate meet
 at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning, so that
 at about 12 o'clock it will be possible for
 Senators who desire to do so to make
 speeches on the retirement of our dis-
 tinguished colleague, the senior Senator
 from Wyoming [Mr. O'MAHOrNEY].
 It is anticipated that we shall then
 bring up some printing resolutions and
 minor money resolutions out of the Com-
 mittee on Rules and Administration. If
 possible, we may get to the Stella bill,
 a bill of some renown. If we do not get
 to it tomorrow, we should get to it within
 the next several days.
 I hope within the next 10 minutes or
 so to have a more complete schedule to
 announce  and  to  inform  Senators
 whether we shall meet Friday or go over
 from Thursday until Monday.
 Mr. CANNON.  Mr. President, I am
 concerned today about the fate of. the
 supplemental air carriers industry in
 this country. After years of hearings the
 Civil Aeronautics Board, in. January
 1959, certificated and authorized sup-
 plemental air carriers, recognizing this
 unique and essential service as a neces-
 sary segment of the Nation's air trans-
 portation structure.  Today the supple-
 mental air carriers have a record of
 proven contribution in the framework
 of air travel, serving civilian passengers
 and cargo and as military carriers.
 These airlines are unique in that they
 have never been nor are they now sub-
 sidized by the Federal Government. In
 addition to efficient, alert, and depend-
 able day-to-day service supplied to the
 military,  supplemental  airlines  were

 May 23, 1960: U.S. News & World Report
 (p. 54) described Communist espionage in
 West Germany as follows:
 "Last year, in West Germany alone, 2,787
 Communist spies were caught. -* * * East
 Germany sent most of them * * * but 264
 were from Russia, 114 from Poland, 63 from
 Czechoslovakia,  11 from Rumania, 8 from
 Hungary and 2 from Bulgaria.
 "During the first 4 months of this year,
 820 more Communist agents were arrested,
 including 691 from East Germany, 72 from
 Russia.  Yet only a fraction of all spies sent
 from the Soviet block to West Germany are
 caught.
 "The current estimate is that 17,000 Com-
 munist spies are operating  in West Ger-
 many. * * * Red  agents  also  make  West
 Berlin the kidnaping center of the world.
 Since the war they have tried 340 kidnap-
 ings, succeeded in 255.
 "West German estimates of 17,000 active
 agents do not include either the silent group
 (Polish, Czech and Rumanian spies posing as
 refugees) or the 35,000 members of the out-
 lawed West German Communist Party.
 "Over the years, more than 15,000 Red
 agents have been arrested in West Germany.
 Of these, fewer than 2,000 have been con-
 victed.  Many were let off because they con-
 fessed, voluntarily, not long after they en-
 tered West Germany.  Others showed they
 were coerced into spying by Red threats to
 their families."

 ANNIVERSARY OF NOMINATION OF
 ABRAHAM LINCOLN TO BE PRESI-
 DENT OF THE UNITED STATES
 Mr. DIRKSEN.  Mr. President, I do
 not want this day to pass without observ-
 ing that 100 years ago today Abraham
 Lincoln was nominated, in a great struc-
 ture in Chicago known as The Wigwalm,
 as the Republican candidate for the
 Presidency of the United States.
 I have read a good many accounts as to
 what happened at that' convention, and
 particularly those of a New York re-
 porter named Murat Halstead, I think it
 is one of the most fascinating bits of
 reporting I have ever seen.
 Abraham Lincoln was 51 years old
 when he was nominated on May 18, 100
 years ago today.
 I think it was one of the statesmen
 from New York, Mr. William M. Evarts,
 who made a seconding speech, who used
 a phrase or two which were not only
 interesting,  but  very . applicable.  He
 spoke about, "for the suffrages of the
 whole country." That is an interesting
 phrase. It has been echoed by the dis-
 tinguished Senator from Montana [Mr.
 MANSFIELD]    and the distinguished ma-
 jority leader, the Senator from Texas
 [Mr. JOHNSON], when they have spoken
 of unity. Unity means speaking for the
 whole country.  That becomes an in-
 teresting echo from over a century of
 time.
 Also in the speech Mr. Evarts used the
 phrase, in presenting the name of Mr.
 Lincoln, that he was nominating him
 to be "the Chief 'Magistrate of the
 American Union."  There is a rounded
 sound  about  the expression,  "Chief
 Magistrate of the American Union."
 This is a Union. It is American. There
 is a Chief Magistrate.. His naive is
 ircumstances.
 I wish to add one squib from the
 Great Emancipator, Abraham Lincoln,
 because he had a dedication of spirit
 to the cause of peace precisely like that
 of the present President of the United
 States.  On one occasion Lincoln said:
 The man does not live who is more de-
 voted to peace than I am.  None who would
 do more to preserve it.  But it may be neces-
 sary to put the foot down firmly.
 So our President is equally dedicated
 to the cause of peace, and with that
 same devotion and that same firmness
 of spirit he has put his foot down, and
 in so doing merited the applause of our
 people.
 I think I am at liberty to say that the
 President will return to the Nation's
 Capital in midafternoon of Friday of
 this week. I hope that all the citizenry
 who are available and so disposed will
 be able to journey to Andrews Field and
 to greet the President as he returns to
 his own country.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SEN
 CRUCIAL VOTES IN CONGRESS
 Question. Have there been some occasions
 when the opposition party would have pre-
 ferred you to be absent on some of those ties,
 too?
 Answer. That is certainly true because the
 eight tie votes In which I did participate were
 on important issues.  You may remember
 that I broke the 47-47 tie on whether or not
 the Senate would approve a massive Federal-
 aid-to-education bill which would have made
 teachers'  salaries a Federal responsibility.
 My breaking of the tie on that vote was
 considered a significant step, and I did not
 take it hastily.
 Question. Don't you usually know in ad-
 '.Stance when some important issue is going to
 come up that might result in a tie?
 Answer. Exactly.  This is another reason
 why the possibility of a tie vote should not
 keep the Vice President from taking other
 assignments.  The work of the Senate is gen-
 erally so planned that you do not have votes
 called on the spur of the moment.  Generally
 speaking, votes in the Senate are taken at
 specified times, particularly on critical issues:
 Question. Is most of the work that you do
 for the executive branch in Washington
 itself, rather than out of town?
 Answer. Yes; except when a trip abroad is
 involved.  However, good-will trips are gen-
 erally scheduled for congressional recesses or
 for periods when we do not expect any legis-
 lation.  Otherwise, I are in Washington.  I
 may be at the White House, for example, and
 I might point out that, at the White House,
 I am exactly 7 minutes-I know exactly how
 long it takes-from the Senate floor.  So, if
 a vote should occur while I am at the White
 House, I am always able to'get there in time
 to vote.
 Question. In this rather intimate official
 relationship with the President for the last
 7 years, it is presumed you have gotten to
 know each other pretty well.  How would
 you describe your personal relations with the
 President?
 Answer. Why, I would say that, thanks to
 him, those relations have been friendly, and
 certainly very memorable as far as I am con-
 cerned.                      I have been able to see how he
 reacts in handling difficult problems-prob-
 lems like Lebanon, and Quemoy and Matsu,
 for example.- There is nothing that quite
 takes the place of witnessing firsthand the
 making of great decisions.
 WHEN A CRISIS ARISES
 Question. Would you say that in crises Mr.
 Eisenhower is any different from what he is
 in the normal routine of everyday work?
 Answer. I think everyone is different in a
 crisis.  In the case of the President, what
 impresses me the most is his complete ob-
 jectivity and impersonal approach to a crisis.
 You can describe it as coolness in a crisis,
 but simply saying that he is cool in a crisis
 does not adequately describe his attitude.
 In fact, those who have seen him, as I have,
 when he has made important decisions, get
 the impression that here is a man who is
 carefully weighing all the pros and cons of
 a particular course of action, without think-
 ing at all about the effect that such action
 may have on his personal popularity-think-
 ing only of what he believes is In the best
 interests of the country.  And, most impor-
 tant, by watching him in these moments of
 crisis I was impressed by the fact that the
 hotter the discussion became, the cooler he
 became.  This is probably one of the greatest
 lessons that I have learned while working
 under the President and with him during
 the past 7 years.
 There Is one other thing I might say in
 this connection which I think is important.:
 Once he makes a decision, it is made.  He
 does not continue to worry about it and to
 second-guess it.  This, I think, also Is im-
 portant in leadership.
 No. 92
 Question.. What is your feeling as you
 watch the President?  Is the Presidency it-
 self something toward which there is a sense
 of awe and perhaps of great reverence?
 Answer. Strangely enough, as you were
 stating that question the words "awe" and
 "reverence"' were exactly the ones that came
 into my mind.  Whenever I see the President
 making a tough decision I recognize how
 easy, by comparison, my responsibilities are.
 Another thing that is very impressive about
 the President is that, no matter how much
 he may have on his mind, he seldom gives
 the impression of carrying the world on his
 shoulders.  He has the ability to keep a re-
 laxed mind when he makes the important
 decisions. Some men, when they have tough
 decisions, inevitably tense up right in front
 of your eyes.  I have seldom seen the Presi-
 dent give that impression, if ever..

 Committee?
 I Vaoff' attendance at that meeting;
 and I asked Mr. Khrushchev quite a
 number of questions, and got a rather
 curt brushoff when we got around to
 the censoring of American dispatches,
 when Mr. Khrush hex said:
 How da we  now they are not all spies?
 The U-2 incident was immaterial, and
 n        _         ` _ a smokescreen. But
 I must get back to the crowbar.
 On the day Khrushchev arrived in
 Paris, Governor Stevenson was quoted in
 an interview by the Paris press. It was
 first reported to us by
 ,olle -
 Yfgk"
 man, a competent, reliable reporter on
 the staff of the Chicago Daily News
 fopign service. Mr. Stoneman reported
 that in this interview Governor Steven-
 son made three suggestions. They were
 as follows, and they were, he  lined in
 the., 12-&-h. ,,l,aers on the  a
 fCirv irs`   at he favored concessions on
 BMin in return for an agreement with
 Russia on cessation of atomic tests.
 gagnd, that he favored a reduction of
 American forces in West Berlin from
 11,000 to 7,000.
 I would gather from that suggestion
 that the distinguished former Governor
 of Illinois wants to close the last remain-
 ing hole in the Iron Curtain.
 migEtbe sought on the basis of the
 Rapachi  plan,  under  which  forces
 would be reduced by both the East and
 the West in the area of central Europe.
 Since then  avid Lwr. rig in today's
 Issue of the       or c era d Tribune,
 discusses the matter further under the
 caption, "Stevenson Is Seen Involved in
 Strange Circumstances." Mr. Lawrence
 comments at length on the matter, and
 then says:
 The strangest episode of all, however, is
 the  interview with Mr.  Stevenson,  which
 Soviet Premier Khrushchev read in Paris-
 Presse-l'Intransigeant just after his recent
 arrival in Paris.  That interview was writ-
 ten by Robert Bulay, after a visit to Mr.
 Stevenson's home at Libertyville, Ill., where'
 he said he spent an afternoon together with
 other guests.
 The  article  with    a  streamer  headline
 across the page said that Adlai Stevenson
 had proposed virtually a retreat from Ber-
 lin  and American troop withdrawal from
 Europe.  The  published  interview  was  a
 shock to Americans abroad coming as it did
 just a few days before the summit confer.
 ence was to open.
 That makes quite a picture.         On the
 eve of the conference, the man who was
 twice the candidate of his party for the
 presidency, and in an election year, sug-
 say what might happen-shows his hand
 in such fashion, Mr. Khrushchev would
 have been a fool not to consider post-
 ponement of the conference for 6 or 8
 months-that is, until after election
 day-on the theory that he might be
 dealing later with a more gentle, a more
 tractable, a more flexible, and a less
 firm President.  Or could it be with -a
 more tractable Secretary of State?
 In  Mr.  Khrushchev's  comment  to
 Mayor George Christopher at the San
 Francisco dinner, he rated Mr. Steven-
 son "the best among U.S. politicians."
 Along with all this was the suggestion
 by the Senator from Massachusetts
 [Mr. KENNEDY] in Oregon that, no mat-
 ter who was nominated, Governor Ste-
 venson would be a good candidate for
 Secretary of State.
 Did  Mr.  KENNEDY  read  Governor
 Stevenson's interview in the Paris press?
 If he did not, how did he come on the
 statement that Khrushchev had made in
 East Berlin, that for the last 7 years
 Chancellor Adenauer has been_the S.1;pSe-
 Adla' an   }1' Adlai used that hrase,
 and it a rs 49 ta-  aris in eiview.

 crowbar brought about the wreckage of
 the summit?    Perhaps it would be more
 appropriate to say it was a stick of dy-
 namite with a delayed action fuse. Or,
 since Adlai is a Navy man, we might
 remain in character and say it was a
 well-placed,   well-timed  torpedo  that
 found its mark.
 To make sure that all this is docu-

 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Is there
 objection to the request of the Senator
 from Illinois?
 There being no objection, the exhibits
 were ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 TEXT OF ADDRESS BY ADLAI STEVENSON TO A
 COOK   COUNTY   DEivrtrjC   Ci'OMMITv5E
 DINNER      ^ 9_,          t  t
 It appears that is year's' campaign will
 be waged under the darkest shadows that
 ever  hovered over the  world-the mush-
 room clouds of a nuclear war that no one
 wants.   This terrible danger-and  how to
 avert it-will and should overshadow every
 other issue.
 For the chances of a more stable world,
 which seemed to be brightening, have been
 rudely reversed by the breakdown   of  the
 summit conference in this historic week.
 Premier Khrushchev wrecked this confer.
 ence. Let there be no mistake about that.
 When he demanded that President Eiseri-
 hower apologize and punish those respon-
 sible for the spy-plane flight, he was in
 effect asking thePr"kerri to punish him-
 self.  This was an impossible request, and
 he knew it.
 SERIES OF BLUNDERS
 But we handed Khrushchev the crowbar
 and the sledge hammer to wreck the meet-
 ing.  Without our series of blunders, Mr.
 Khrushchev would not have had a pretext
 for making his impossible demand and wild
 charges.  Let there be no mistake about that
 either.

 it.   And when Mr. Khrushchev  gave the
 President an out by suggesting that he was
 not responsible for ordering the flight, the
 President proudly asserted that he was re-
 sponsible.                             On top of that we intimated that
 such espionage flights over Russia would
 continue.  At this point if Khrushchev did
 not protest he would be condoning our right
 to spy-and how long could he keep his job
 that way?  Next we evidentially reconsid-
 ered  and called  off the  espionage flights.
 But to compound the incredible, we post-
 poned the announcement that the flights
 were terminated-just long enough to make
 it seem we were yielding to pressure, but too
 long to prevent Mr. Khrushchev from reach-
 ing the boiling point.

 picious Russians to think such a series of
 mistakes could only be a deliberate effort to
 break up a conference we never wanted any-
 way?
 We Democrats know how clumsy this ad-
 ministration can be.  We are not likely to
 forget the fumbles that preceded the Suez
 crisis on the eve of the 1956 election.
 But nothing, of course, can justify W.
 Khrushchev's contemptuous conduct, espe-
 cially after President Eisenhower had an-
 nounced that our espionage flights had been
 called off,  But his anger was predictable,
 if not his violence.   dT           f    if

 Republican leaders are now saying that in
 this grave crisis we must all rally around the
 President In the name of national unity.
 Our respect for the Presidency will find us
 joined in salute to President Eisenhower up-
 on his return.  We resent deeply and bitterly
 the gross affront to the President and his
 Office.
 NO QUESTION ABOUT UNITY
 There is no question about national unity
 In a time of crisis.  But errors must be cor-
 rected, and must not forget that the oppo-
 sition party also has an obligation to our
 country and to our allies whose security is
 also involved.  It is the duty of responsible
 opposition in a democracy to expose and
 criticize  carelessness  and  mistakes,  espe-
 cially in a case of such national and world
 importance as this.      We must see to it that
 we profit from such grave mistakes and mis-
 fortunes.
 It it particularly regrettable that this hap-
 pened in an election year.  And we can al-
 ready predict what the Republicans will tell
 the people in the months ahead.
 They will stay that President Eisenhower's
 patience and dignity in Paris scored a diplo-
 matic triumph by exposing Khrushchev's
 Insincerity.      -
 They will say that the Russians are hop-
 ing that a "softed" Democratic President
 will be elected in November.  They will tell
 the people that a vote for the candidate the
 Russians distrust is a vote against appease-
 ment.
 It will be our duty, it will be the duty of
 all thoughtful, concerned citizens to help
 the situation and to face the hard, ines-
 capable  facts;  that  this - administration
 played into Khrushchev's hands;  that if
 Khrushchev wanted to wreck the conference
 our Government made it possible; that the
 administration has acutely embarrassed our
 allies and, endangered our bases; that they
 RECORD - SENATE
 have helped make successful negotiations
 with  the Russians-negotiations  that  are
 vital to our survival-impossible so long as
 they are in power.
 MUST SEEK UNDERSTANDING
 We cannot sweep this whole- sorry mess
 under the rug in the name of national unity.
 We cannot and must not.  Too much is at
 stake.. Rather, we must try to help the
 American people understand the nature of
 the crisis, to see how we got into this pre-
 dicament, how we can get out of it, and
 how we get on with the business of im-
 proving relations and mutual confidence and
 building a safer, saner world in the nuclear
 age.
 For in this age, unprecedented in human
 history, all of us, Americans and Russians
 alike, have one common enemy.  The enemy
 is the danger of war.  We must defeat the
 enemy together.  Despite his hysterics last
 night, Mr. Khrushchev says he still believes
 In peaceful progress by negotiation.  Let us
 hope he proves it, and let the United States
 come into the United Nations not content
 with the ordinary speeches, not content
 with the usual anti-Russian majority votes,
 but with constructive, positive, affirmative
 proposals to restore the hope of peace.
 To those who will see nothing but Rus-
 sian vice and American virtue, to those who
 will cry appeasement to any acknowledg-
 ment of our mistakes, I say that this is the
 toughest kind of commonsense.  For there
 is no future for any of us in a spiraling
 arms race propelled by mounting suspicion
 and distrust on both" sides.  The fact that
 Khrushchev seems to have lost his temper
 in Paris makes it all the more important
 that we not lose ours-or our heads.

 KHausHc= KEPT 4-YEAR SILENCE ON U.S.
 FLICG:?HTS; SOVIET PREMIER REJECTED PROTEST
 TO UNITED STATES IN 1956
 (News release from American aommitt.ee 1 r
 --           Liber  i        -
 NLVAr Yons.-When did Nikita Khrushchev
 first learn of the U.S. U-2 flights over the
 Soviet Union? The question assumes impor-
 tance in view of the Soviet Premier's temper
 tantrum in Paris on Monday.
 According to Radio Liberty, Khrushchev
 himself has statCa1Tfg"DTEO Enew of the U.S.
 reconnaissance flights in 1956.  Moreover, by
 his own admission, the Soviet Premier refused
 at the time to lodge a protest with the U.S.
 Government.   Instead, he said he ordered
 improvements in Soviet rocket power.
 It was a Soviet rocket which, according
 to Khrushchev, brought down the highflying
 Lockheed U-2 piloted by Francis Gary Powers
 near Sverdl"vs c'26'BL"'M1 "I.`
 "The record thus indicates that Mr. Khru-
 shchev first learned about the U.S. overflights
 almost 4 years before he raised the issue in
 an obvious effort to torpedo the Paris summit
 conference," said Radio Liberty.  "The ques-
 tion naturally arises as to why the Soviet
 Premier waited 4 years to protest."
 Radio Liberty also noted that it was during
 those  4 years-following the      alleged  1956
 plane   episode-that   Nikita     Khrushchev
 roamed the world as a salesman of "peaceful
 coexistence." Later, after he succeeded in
 being invited to the United States, he began
 expounding the so-called spirit of Camp
 David.
 "There is nothing on the record to suggest
 that Mr. Khrushchev ever brought the sub-
 ject of these flights to President Eisenhower's
 attention during his- U.S. visit last fall," said
 Radio Liberty.  "Why-if they pained him so
 deeply-he waited 4 years to finally broach
 the subject in Paris on Monday should be of
 considerable interest to the peoples of the
 Soviet Union, to whom peace is as important
 as it is to the peoples of the free world.  Is it
 possible Mr. Khrushchev had other consid-
 erations in mind when he decided to torpedo
 the summit conference?".
 Radio Liberty, which is the voice of former
 Soviet citizens, is providing thorough cover-
 age of the Paris summit developments in its
 around-the-clock broadcasts to all parts of
 the Soviet Union in Russian and 17 other
 languages from powerful  transmitters in
 Western Europe and the Far East.
 According to Gene King, U.S. programing
 chief of the network, Radio Liberty is plac-
 ing special emphasis on news developments
 which official Soviet communications media
 appear to be ignoring.  For example, Presi-
 dent Eisenhower's announcement that the
 United States was not going to resume survey
 flights over the U.S.S.R. was not immediately
 reported by Soviet press and radio.
 "We are also transmitting balanced ac-
 counts of world reactions to the latest de-
 velopments in Paris," Mr. King declared. "We
 are fully aware of the Soviet citizens' desire
 to be fully informed on matters which con-
 cern them as much as they do us."
 According to Radio Liberty, a study of
 Khr>#Ishchev's recent. speeches indicates that
 heltferred -to th  a rife U.S. flights over
 Soviet territo
 IV  7,56  rs           aFently oc-
 curred on July 2, 1956; the second on April 9,
 1960; and the third, Francis Powers' ill-fated
 flight on May 1, 1960.
 The July 2, 1956,.flight was disclosed by
 Khrushchev at a reception in the Czecho-
 slovak Embassy in Moscow last May 9.  Ac-
 cording to the text provided by TASS, the
 official press agency, this is what the Soviet
 Premier said:
 "I shall say further, when Twining, the
 then Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force,
 arrived here we welcomed him as a guest and
 entertained him. He left our country by air
 and the next day he sent a plane flying at
 great altitude into our country.  This plane
 flew as far as Kiev.           -
 "The question arose: Should we protest?
 I proposed that no protest should be lodged.
 Only an animal might act like Twining,
 which, eating at one place, might do its
 unpleasant business there.     From such be-
 havior, we drew the conclusion: To Improve
 rockets, to improve fighters.  Our fighters

 can fly as high as 28,000 meters.  But the
 difficulties of a fighter are that though it can
 rise high, it is not so easy and simple to find
 the target in. the air: a plane in the air is
 like a needle in the ocean.
 "But the rocket. finds its targets itself.
 This is the advantage of the rocket and we
 made use of it."
 The record shows that Gen. Nathan F.
 Twining arrived in Moscow on June 23, 1956,
 for what the then Air Force Chief of Staff
 later termed an 8-day "controlled" inspec-
 tion of some Soviet air and military installa-
 tions.  The day after his arrival, he later
 reported, he attended a Moscow, party ten-
 dered by the Defense Ministry on Soviet Air
 Force Day.   At  the  party,  Khrushchev
 drunkenly insulted the United States, British,
 French, and West German air officials pres-
 ent while Nikolai Bulganin, then the Soviet
 Premier, vainly shouted, "Shut up."
 General Twining left the Soviet Union
 on July 1, 1956.  According to Khrushchev,
 the following day an American plane "flying
 at great altitude ? * * flew as far as Kiev,"
 the capital of the Ukrainian Soviet Social-
 ist Republic, about 500 miles southwest of
 Moscow and about 600 miles north of Turkey.
 Khurshchev gave no further details.
 Last May 5, in his speech before the
 Supreme Soviet, Khrushchev dramatically
 announced that a U.S. plane, which had
 violated Soviet airspace  on  May  1-May
 Day-had been shot down by a Soviet rocket.
 But he also disclosed this:
 "Previously, an aggressive act was com-
 mitted by the United States of America on
 the 9th of April 1960.  A U.S. aircraft in-
 vaded the airspace of our country from the
 direction of Afghanistan.  Naturally, no per-
 son of commonsense could think or suspect
 that  this  violation was carried  out  by
 Afghanistan, a country which is friendly
 toward us.  We are convinced that this air-
 craft belonged to the United States and
 was   evidently  based  somewhere  on  the
 territory of Turkey, Iran, or Pakistan.
 "When this invasion occurred, some of our
 comrades raised the question as to whether
 the United States should be warned.     We
 exchanged views within the Government
 and decided not to take any special measures,
 not to write notes or memorandums because
 from previous experience we knew that this
 leads to virtually nothing.  We then gave a
 stern warning to our military, especially
 those who are directly responsible for the
 aerial defense of the country, that they must
 act resolutely and not permit the invasion of
 our airspace by foreign planes to go un-
 punished.
 "The  American military evidently liked
 the impunity which they experienced on
 April 9, and they decided to repeat their
 aggressive act.  For this purpose they select-
 ed May Day, the most solemn occasion for our
 people and for the working people of all
 countries."
 In his May 9 remarks at the Czechoslovak
 Embassy, Khrushchev returned to the April 9
 episode.  "Even now," he said, "this flight is
 denied in the United States.  In this case
 the thics is: If the thief is not caught, he is
 no thief. But this time we caught the thief
 and now the whole world knows about it.
 "The reconnaissance           plane should have
 been brought down on April 9, too.  But our
 military, to put it midly, let a chance slip
 by.  And we, as one says, took them to task
 for it.  On May 1 the reconnaissance plane
 was shot down.   The          military splendidly
 coped with the task when the opponent grew
 bold."

 STEVENSON  IS  SEEN  INVOLVED IN  "STRANGE
 CIRCUMSTANCES"
 (By David Lawrence)
 WASHINGTON,            a    s Niklta Khru-
 shchev want to see Adlai Stevenson elected
 President of the United States in November
 so that he can negotiate a deal at the next
 summit conference?
 Does Mr. Khrushchev hope that Mr. Ste-
 venson, if not nominated, will be consid-
 ered for the post of Secretary of State in a
 Democratic administration, as Senator KEN-
 NEDY hinted the other day?
 Why was Mr. Stevenson, in an interview
 published  in  Paris  a  week  ago  Sunday
 quoted as favoring an Allied retreat on the
 Berlin problem?
 Why  did  Mr.  Stevenson  last           Thursday
 night tell a political dinner meeting in Chi-
 cago that the administration has "helped
 make successful negotiations with the Rus-
 sians-negotiations  thrt  are  vital  to  our
 survival-impossible so long as they are in
 power?,'
 A STRANGE SEQUENCE
 These questions are prompted by a strange
 sequence of circumstances.  Thus on March
 9 last the New York Times printed a United
 Press International dispatch from Moscow
 which read:
 "Soviet Premier Khrushchev has his own
 opinions about he U.S. Democratic Party's
 Presidential possibilities,  he  revealed to-
 night.                                                                  He put Adlai Stevenson at the top of
 his list in comments to Mayor George Chris-
 topher of San Francisco at a dinner.  Mr.
 Khrushchev's rating of the Democrats:
 "Mr. Stevenson: ? the best among U.S. poli-
 ticians.
 "Senator JOHN F. KENNEDY, of Massachu-
 setts: able, but some reservations about his
 youthfulness.
 "Senator STUART SYMINGTON, of Missouri:
 he's a good man."
 No other Presidential aspirants were men-
 tioned, not even Senator HUMPHREY, who
 had once participated in a marthon confer-
 ence of several hours with the Soviet Pre-
 mier.                                                                  Mr.  Stevenson  also  conferred  at
 length with Mr. Khrushchev in Moscow and
 wrote articles about him, but they did net
 contain any of the sting that the Minnesota
 Senator included in his published remarks.
 DIPLOMACY RULE IGNORED
 Mr.  Stevenson,  therefore, apparently is
 the favorite of Mr. Khrushchev, who has
 brushed aside the old rule of diplomacy
 that a foreign government must not inter-
 fere in the political campaigns of another
 country.  The   Soviet  Premier   evidently
 thinks Mr. Stevenson, as the titular head
 of the Democratic Party, speaks for it.
 But James A. Farley, former Postmaster
 General in the cabinet of the late President
 Franklin D. Roosevelt and a former chair-
 man of the Democratic National Committee,
 has  just Issued  a statement  urging  the
 Democratic Party to repudiate Mr. Steven-
 son's speech  of last Thursday night.                                                                         Mr.
 Farley said in part:
 "The unwarranted attack of Mr. Adlai
 E. Stevenson on the President's conduct of
 the summit negotiations, in my opinion, in
 no way represents the thinking of the Demo-
 cratic  Party. * * * In  his  few  remaining
 weeks as titular spokesman of the Demo-
 cratic Party has indicated every reason why
 the Democratic Party in convention should
 select a spokesman who speaks for it in fact.
 I can think of no more effective way of
 doing so than by a unanimous resolution of
 condemnation and repudiation of his absurd
 speech in Chicago as representing the views
 of the Democratic Party."
 HIS TALK OF RETREAT
 The strangest episode of all, however, is
 the interview with Mr. Stevenson which
 Soviet Premier Khrushchev read in "Paris-
 Press L'Intransigeant" just after his recent
 arrival in Paris.  That interview was written
 by Robert Boulay after a visit to Mr. Steven-
 son's home at Libertyville, Ill., where he
 said he spent an afternoon, together with
 other guests.  The article, with a streamer
 headline across the page, said that Adlai
 Stevenson had proposed virtually a retreat
 May 23
 from Berlin and American troop withdrawal
 from Europe.  The published interview was
 a shock to Americans abroad, coming as it
 did  just  a  few  days  before  the  summit
 conference    was to  open. Evidently    Mr.
 Khruschev read it carefully, because in his
 own speech at East Berlin last Friday he
 paraphrased one of the points in the inter-
 view to charge that Chancellor Adenauer had
 succeeded "in worming his way to the post
 of Secretary of State of the United States."
 Mr. Boulay, in his interview,, quotes Mr.
 Stevenson as having said:
 "For 10 years there has not really been
 a Secretary of State for American foreign
 policy.  During that period the real Ameri-
 can Secretary  of State has been German
 Chancellor Adenauer."
 ON REDUCING TROOPS
 In other parts of the same interview, Mr.
 Stevenson is quoted as favoring American
 concessions, such as a substantial decrease
 in allied troops in West Berlin.  He is re-
 ported to have declared also that he could
 foresee in. the future the pulling of Ameri-
 can forces out of Europe.                                                                                                                                    When asked
 whether there would be a change in Ameri-
 can foreign policy after the November elec-
 tions, Mr. Stevenson is quoted as having
 said: "There will be important changes in
 American foreign policy."
 Mr. Stevenson last Tuesday denied ever
 having given any interview at all to any
 Paris newspaper.  But he issued a statement
 to the Chicago Daily News the next day ad-
 mitting that he had talked with Robert
 Boulay but calling the published interview
 incorrect.  He said it did not represent his
 views and that "the most charitable expla-
 nation of such irresponsibility, presumption,
 and discourtesy is that his English was poor
 and my French no better."
 In Paris, however, Americans who know
 Mr. Boulay say he writes and talks English
 very well and is a reliable reporter.  Just
 what did Mr. Stevenson really say to Mr.
 Boulay?  Maybe all this is something for
 Democrats in Congress to include in their
 investigation of recent events.  For there is
 no doubt that an appeasement faction exists
 today inside the Democratic party, and cer-
 tainly Mr. Stevenson's speech-just 4 days
 before the all important debate at the United
 Nations Security Council-helped to wreck
 bipartisan unity in this country.

 KENN      SAYS  SOFTER  U-2  STANCE  MIGHT
 AVE .S AWED SUMMIT TALKS
 (By-MorvtrrS?fo il&7cer)
 If Senator  JOHN F. KENNEDY,     of Massa-
 chusetts, were President he might apologize
 to Soviet Premier Khrushchev for the U-2 spy
 incident, but the Pope would keep his hands
 out of U.S. governmental affairs.
 The Democratic presidential primary can-
 didate made these points Wednesday, a day
 of appearances spanning St. Helens and
 Oregon City which ended with a campaign-
 climaxing rally at Benson Tech High School
 in Portland.
 In Friday's election he is matched against
 Oregon Senator  WAYNE  L. MORSE, who is
 campaigning actively, and Senators STUART
 SYMINGTON,  of  Missouri,  and LYNDON  B.
 JOHNSON,   who  are not appearing  in the
 State. Senator  HUBERT H.  IIUMPHREY,  of
 Minnesota, will have his name on the ballot,
 but he has withdrawn from the contest.
 It was at St. Helens High School, follow-
 ing                                                                                                                          r             'h!W_ fng for which he arrived

 Throughout Wednesday-at high school,
 supermarket, and industrial plant-KENNEDY
 used  a  defense  against  attacks  on  his
 Catholic faith that apparently was developed
 after his mid-April visit to Oregon.
 He is telling audiences that he "swore an
 oath to God" to uphold the Constitution
 when he entered   Congress, and that the
 President takes the same oath.  The Con-
 stitution, he points out, provides for sepa-
 ration of church and state.
 When KENNEDY says he would not let the
 Pope interfere with his duties as president,
 there is more behind the statement than an
 Irish  Catholic's  Independence.  The  Pope,
 it follows naturally, would be asking him
 to violate an "oath to God."
 KENNEDY says he doesn't think the Pope
 would interfere with him as president. any
 more than he does with Charles de Gaulle
 in France and Konrad Adenauer in West
 Germany.
 MILL VISITED
 The candidate toured the Crown Zeller-
 bach paper mill at West Linn, and a sam-
 pling of Democratic workmen opinion here
 brought  nothing  of  comfort  to  MoasE,
 SYMINGTON, and JOHNSON.
 Of 15 men in a lunchroom which KEN-
 PEDY  had visited, 10 were Democrats, and
 7 of them held up a hand to signify he
 favors KENNEDY for the nomination.  None
 responded to a call for a show of hands by
 MORSE supporters.
 Random Democrats at the papermill, sep-
 arated  by a  sprinkling  of                  Republicans-
 Leroy Saulsbury, 41,  Milwaukee,  a mill-
 worker, and Art Goldade, 33, West Linn, a
 pipefltter-were mostly for KENNEDY.
 One man asked:  "What's wrong with
 MORSE?"   He got no answer.
 There is a small chill for Republicans in
 one reaction to these questions, which came
 from Richard Buse, 33, a millwright.
 His wife likes KENNEDY.  She Is a Demo-
 crat and a Catholic.  But Buse likes KEN-
 NEDY, too.  He's going to vote for him if he
 gets the nomination. Buse Is a Lutheran
 and a Republican.
 There was another party line-crossing in-
 cident at Gateway Shopping Center, where
 a long queue of persons followed KENNEDY
 from shop to shop in the rain.
 A girl in a barber shop was a Democrat.
 She's for KENNEDY.
 "Most of us in here are Republicans," said
 one of several men present, "but we're go-
 ing to vote for KENNEDY in the fall"
 KENNEDY got unusual support from a fel-
 low Democrat in another Wednesday inci-
 dent, one which dramatized the widening
 Democratic Party breach occasioned by the
 election campaign.
 At a meeting of the East Multnomah
 County Democratic Women's Forum, MORSE,
 the speaker, vigorously criticized KENNEDY,
 and KENNEDYwas defended by State Sena-
 tor Monroe Sweetland, Milwaukee, a member
 of Kennedy's committee.  The unusual part
 is that Sweetland is a candidate for Demo-
 cratic nomination for secretary of state, and
 a candidate for major office does not often
 expose himself to the enemies of any other
 candidate.
 NO TAX CUT SEEN

 High School KENNEDY was asked if he would

 WOULD ADLAI HAVE BANNED THE TT-22?
 (By GW  r.;ncoln)
 Adlai Stevenson's blast at President Eisen-
 hower and the administration's handling of
 the U-2  intelligence flights over  Russia
 raises some interesting questions-while at
 the same time thrusting an issue into the
 political campaign, with Mr. Stevenson as its
 first and perhaps principal spokesman.
 Among the questions raised by the titular
 leader of the Democratic Party, who has been
 called a willing candidate for a third presi-
 dential nomination-if he can be drafted-
 is the following: Would Mr. Stevenson, had
 he been President during the last 4 years,
 have banned U-2 intelligence  flights  over
 Russian territory?  These flights have been
 called by men intimately connected with the
 security of the United States and the free

 world not only essential but of great value.
 Second: Is Mr. Stevenson in any way deny-
 ing that we should seek information regard-
 ing the intentions and the strength of a
 potential enemy-particularly during a pe-
 riod of constant sabre rattling and threats
 of destruction of the United States by Soviet
 Premier Khrushchev and other leading Rus-
 sian Communists?
 This is a subject which Mr. Stevenson has
 not thoroughly discussed in his comments so
 far.  But it is one that, should he be nomi-
 nated by the Democratic Party, he will be
 asked many times, and will have to answer.
 It is obvious he cannot have It both ways.
 Mr. Khrushchev in his recent widely publi-
 cized press conference In Paris, when he tor-
 pedoed the summit conference, said in an-
 swer to a question that he had known for
 some time of the U-2 flights over Russia;
 that he knew all about them at the time he
 visited  the  United  States  and  President
 Eisenhower at Camp David.     If he did, his
 restraint--.he did not mention these flights
 to President Eisenhower in    their intimate
 conversations-was in remarkable contrast
 to his outbursts in Moscow on May Day and
 in Paris.
 RESPONSIBILITY OF PRESIDENT
 Had Mr. Stevenson been President he
 would have been told by the country's de-
 fenders in all probability that it was of vital
 importance to rise above the Iron Curtain
 and obtain as much information as possible
 regarding Russia's military strength and her
 intentions, so that this country could be
 alerted before a surprise attack. Presumably
 Mr. Stevenson would have agreed. to this
 form of espionage.  He would have known,
 as did President Eisenhower, the need for
 our security in the face of the constant
 threat  of  Soviet  attack.   He  would have
 known, too, of the Wideflung espionage car-
 ried on-and with much success-by the
 Soviet, both in this country and in the rest
 of the world.
 Nevertheless,  Mr.  Stevenson  has  under-
 taken to thrust this whole subject of intelli-
 gence work for national security into the
 political campaign.    Another question rises:
 Have Mr. Stevenson's charges against the
 President and his handling of the use of
 these intelligence flights tended to create a
 picture in Russian minds and In the minds of
 our allies of a divided America?  The titular
 leader of the Democratic Party was careful
 in his Chicago speech to denounce the de-
 mands of Mr. Khrushchev for an apology
 from President. Eisenhower because of the
 U-2 flights and for the punishment of those
 responsible  for launching them.   He was
 careful to say that this is no time for Amer-
 ica to be divided.  But what he said, taken
 as a whole, may well be interpreted as show-
 ing a serious division among the people of
 America.  It may be interpreted as a back-
 handed apology.
 Certainly, Mr. Stevenson seems to have in-
 dicated that the country must get rid of
 the Republicans and Mr. Eisenhower and all
 his works if the United States is to be able
 in the future to negotiate with Soviet Russia
 and the Communist world.  This, in a mea-
 sure, is exactly what Mr. Khrushchev de-
 clared in Paris.  If Mr. Stevenson intended
 to exhibit himself as a better negotiator for
 a peaceful world, he has not given an im-
 pression that he would be a stronger one.
 SPEECH POLITICAL.
 Mr. Stevenson in Chicago was addressing a
 Democratic political rally, a Cook County
 fund raising dinner.  His speech was a po-
 litical speech and so intended.  The issue of
 the U-2 flights, their handling, and all other
 implications, so far as Mr. Stevenson is con-
 cerned, are firmly in the campaign.  It may
 be that other Democratic leaders will follow a
 similar  course.  The  question  naturally
 arises: Will this issue gain votes for the Dem-
 ocratic nominee for President- whether Mr.
 Stevenson, Senator  KENNEDY  or another?
 Will Mr. Stevenson picture the President as
 a wrecker of the Paris Summit Conference-
 or won't he?. It would be a difficult task to
 put that across in the minds of Americans,
 in view of Mr. Khrushchev's exhibition at
 Paris.  In his Chicago speech, Mr. Stevenson
 called Mr. Khrushchev the wrecker of the
 conference.  But he said Mr. Eisenhower had
 placed  the  crowbar  in  Mr.  Khrushchev's
 hands by ineptness, by contradictory state-
 ments emanating from this Government.
 This raises the question: Would Mr. Steven-
 son, as President, have denied the whole
 business of the U-2 flights, have disclaimed
 any responsibility for them?
 The American people have learned over the
 years that President Eisenhower is devoted
 to peace and. the preservation of a peaceful
 world.  He, however, has never been an ad-
 vocate of peace at any price.  He has insisted
 that the country be prepared and strong and
 informed in order to forestall or prevent
 Communist attack.  Now he is charged by
 Mr. Khrushchev with seeking war, with a de-
 sire to prevent a successful summit confer-
 ence.,  Mr. Stevenson would not have the
 American people believe any such thing.  His
 contention Is that the President has' been
 stupid-more stupid than a Democratic Pres-
 ident would have been.  That, however, is
 still to be proved.

 Khrushchev,, powerful as he is, cannot pre-

 To the Russian people, Dwight D. Eisen-
 hower is not just a President of the United
 States.  He is the supreme' commander of
 the allied forces who with the Soviet armies
 fought   to victory  over  the  ruthless Nazi
 invaders.  During the war his reputation
 was built up by the Soviet Government,
 through the ;press and other ways, as a great
 ally and friend of the Soviet Union.  In July
 1945, Stalin invited him to visit Moscow, and
 he was given a, hero's welcome.
 He stayed with me at the Embassy, and I
 vividly recall his reception by the people,
 particularly at the Dynamo football game.

 raised the sky with their applause when he
 and Marshal Zhukov stood up to take a
 bow, with their arms around each other's
 shoulders.
 Then we were invited to review the youth
 parade in Red Square.   The participants,
 100,000 strong, from all over the Soviet Un-
 ion, saw him standing with Stalin and Zhu-
 kov on top of Lenin's tomb.
 Last year, when I visited the Soviet Union,
 wherever I went-Moscow, or central Asia,
 or the wilds of Siberia-people talked to me
 about peace, expressed their fear of war,
 and asked why we planned to attack them.
 It is hard for us Americans to believe that
 the Russian people think the threat of war
 comes from us.  But the propaganda has
 been constantly dinned into them that our
 Government is controlled by a small indus-
 trial clique, and this clique wants war for
 profit.

 When President Eisenhower gives his mes-

 who can give it convincingly.

 tinguished minority leader had to say
 about a speech by the two-time candi-
 date of the Democratic Party, Mr. Adlai
 Stevenson, which speech was given in
 Cook County, I believe, last Thursday.
 Evidently the minority leader thinks
 that a man high in party councils should
 remain quiet when, in all good con-
 science, he perhaps feels a deepening
 disquiet.
 It appears to me that so far as the
 Democratic leadership  is  concerned
 there will be an inquiry, which I under-
 stand, from reading the press reports
 today, has the tacit support of the
 minority leader.
 Mr. DIRKSEN.  Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  I yield.
 Mr.. D      One of our distin-
 gtfl 1iWcorrespondents grabbed me this
 morning as I was coming into the
 Capitol and began to ask about a pos-
 sible investigation.  I think I qualified
 my remark by saying, "           oing
 to be an i      ation`,  that pro as y
 tie `an  e a s committee might
 undertake it.
 I begin to have some doubts about the
 merit of an investigation, when we are
 dealing with Jllq h a sensitive matter as
 country. Once that door is opened, I
 doubt whether it will be closed again.
 Then who shall say what will be the
 repercussions?
 So my statement was a qualified
 statement.
 Mr. M             I accept the Son-
 atoT s s1 aLement, and of course I believe
 it.  I was simply referring to a ticker
 tape report which indicated that if an
 inquiry were to be held the Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee.was the place to hold it.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 It happens that after every interna-
 tional conference of any significance the
 Secretary of State and other interested
 individuals almost always appear before
 the Committee on Foreign Relations and
 gives the committee a report.  Although
 my knowledge comes from press reports,
 I understand from that source that
 there may be a suggestion tomorrow,
 when the Committee on Foreign Rela-
 tions meets, that it conduct not an in-
 vestigation but instead an inquiry, to
 furnish an opportunity for many inter-
 ested Senators to raise questions which
 have been bothering them.
 Speaking about questions, I dare say
 there is not a Member of this body on
 either side of the aisle who does not have
 at least one question which he would
 like to have answered.
 If the inquiry is forthcoming, I wish
 to express the hope, as I have previously
 expressed it, that it will be an inquiry
 based upon the facts, that it will not
 become a political football and will not
 become such a campaign issue that the
 welfare and the unity of the country
 may well be lost in the shuffle.
 . I think Mr. Stevenson had the right
 to make the kind of speech he made.
 I do not think that speech is going to
 disrupt national unity.  I would invite
 the attention of my colleagues to the fact
 that we still live in a free country and
 that we still have the right to express our
 opinions as we see fit. As a responsible
 official of the Democratic Party I can
 find no fault with Mr. Stevenson for
 making his honest views known in a
 speech in Cook County.
 The minority leader has mentioned
 the fact that a story, so called, came out
 during the course of the summit con-
 ference, or prior thereto, in which Mr.
 Stevenson said something about the fact
 that he hoped the nuclear test ban nego-
 tiations would continue.  Well, I hope
 they will continue, also, because I think
 what happens at Geneva in regard to
 the ban on nuclear testing is going to
 have a great effect not only upon this
 country, but also upon mankind as a
 whole.
 The minority leader said that Mr.
 Stevenson advocated a reduction in
 U.S. forces in Berlin from 11,000 to
 7,000. I do not desire to be picayunish,
 I assure the Senator, but it is my under-
 standing that the forces of the three
 Western Allied Powers in Berlin are
 comprised roughly of 11,000 men, and
 the American forces comprise something
 on the order of 4,000 to 5,000 of the
 total.
 The third thing with which the story
 seems to find fault, on the part of Mr.
 Stevenson, is the fact that he advocated
 consideration of the Rapacki plan, by
 means of which there might be created a
 neutralized  zone  in  middle  Europe.
 Others of us have advocated that, also.
 I have advocated consideration of the
 Rapacki plan, the Eden plan, and the
 Gaitskill plan, with the proviso that
 there be a quid pro quo in return before
 anything definite is done along these
 line. I see nothing wrong with that.
 I can understand the opposition of the
 Republican Party to what Mr. Steven-
 son has said, because, frankly speaking,
 I think the Republicans look upon him
 as a possible presidential candidate.
 He may be. He may not be. This is one
 way of anticipating something in ad-
 vance.
 However, I find it extremely difficult to
 understand why Democrats should go
 out of their way to find fault with Mr.
 Stevenson for expressing his honest
 opinions. Some of them, in effect, want
 to "read him out" of the party.  He will
 not be "read out" of the party, because
 he has made many contributions to our
 country in the past, and I anticipate
 he will make many more in the future.
 Some people say, "Well, Mr. Steven-
 son is going to be our next Secretary of
 State." He may well be.  I have heard
 the names of Mr. CHESTER BOWLES and
 of the Senator from Arkansas TMr.
 FULBRIGHT]  mentioned in that respect,
 also.  That is a matter which will be
 determined by the next President, if he
 is a Democrat. If he is not a Democrat,
 we may rest assured that none of these
 three will be appointed.  If the next
 President is a Republican, of course he
 will have to make his own decisions.
 The reference to the 6 to 8 months,
 laid down by Mr. Khrushchev in the
 hope that a new administration will
 come into power, carried the implica-
 tion by the distinguished minority leader
 that if the new President happened to be
 a Democrat, and most specifically if he
 happened to be Mr. Stevenson, things
 were going to be easier, that we were
 going to. be "softer."  Well, I do not
 think we are the ones who have been
 "soft" on communism, to revive an old
 Republican Phrase.  We did not invite
 Mr.  Khrushchev  to     America.   Mr.
 Khrushchev never invited a Democratic
 Presidential candidate to visit him in the
 Kremlin.
 I do not know what Senators mean
 when they say that, because of the
 statement made by Mr. Khrushchev that
 6 or 8 months would be time enough to
 hold another conference, if a Democrat
 is to go to sizch a conference it would in-.
 dicate a sign of softness. It is hard for
 me to follow that reasoning.
 I would advise my Republican col-
 leagues, if I may, not to look too far
 ahead and not to arrive at too many as-
 sumptionst
 oo early.

 In respect to the interview, it is my

 teaview broke, that he had ., ad nothing
 to c` o, with it, and that he. 4 ?not give
 a i interview of that nature, but I cannot
 vTMI-torthat, because I am calling on
 memory, and going back to the public
 print.
 Mr. SCOTT.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  I wish that the
 Republicans would let us take care of
 our business and that they would take
 care of their own business, but let us to-
 gether take care of the Nation's business.
 Mr. DIRKSEN. Mr. President-
 Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President-
 Mr. BUSH.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield for a question?
 Mr.  MANSFIELD.  I yield  to  the
 Senator from Illinois.
 Mr. DIRKSEN.  Mr. President, I try
 aldC'd'95""~e  are ul about documenta-
 tion. Everything I have said this morn-
 ing has a documentary article to support
 the statement.  The interview In Paris
 was pretty lengthy. It was a translation
 of an article by special correspondent
 Robert Boulay.   The heading is  "I
 Passed the Afternoon With the Possible
 Successor  to   Mr. Eisenhower-Adlai
 Stevenson Told Me, `The Americans Must
 Quit Berlin and Europe if They Wish To
 Achieve Atomic Peace."'  That Is the
 headline. It his a Chicago dateline, and
 after the introductory portion the inter-
 view was on a question and answer basis.
 It is all here. It was done at Adlai Stev-
 enson's home at Libertyville, Ill. It must
 have appeared in the Paris newspapers
 because there is no more reputable
 foreign correspondent than Bill Stone-
 man on the Chicago Daily News foreign
 staff. He commented on it. David Law-
 rence also commented on it. I shall leave
 the entire question and answer state-
 ment to speak for itself as to precisely
 what Governor Stevenson said.
 Then, of course, there is the factor of
 timing.  The article hit the papers on
 the day Khrushchev got to Paris, and he
 had to read it, because he gave himself
 away in East Berlin when he mentioned
 that Adenauer had been our Secretary
 of State for 7 years, and that is pre-
 cisely what Adlai Stevenson said to
 Robert Boulay at Libertyville, Ill.  It
 would be amazing indeed to have words
 flowing out of- two diffierent mouths
 3,500 miles apart, each individual being
 insensible of what the other said.
 I have only one further comment to
 make, because I do not want to preempt
 the  floor.   My  distinguished friend
 from Montana [Mr. MANS ELD1 said we
 had invited Mr. Khrushchev here. That
 is correct.   We had invited Mr. Koslov.
 We had invited Mr. Mikoyan.  We got
 them on the "home diamond."  But I
 can remember another period in the his-
 tory of this country when the President
 of the United States went to Yalta and
 when he went to Teheran, to their orbit,
 rather than have them here, and so it
 was much better to have them on the
 "home diamond."  But all the articles
 are there and all the quotes are there;
 they must speak for themselves, includ-
 ing the estimate of the whole matter

 by the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr.
 SCOTT] with respect to the character and
 the patriotism of Governor Stevenson
 and Senator KENNEDY are most unfor-
 tunate.  I am consoled by the source
 from which they came.
 Mr. AIKEN.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, I rise to
 a point of personal privilege.
 The   PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The
 Senator from Montana has the floor.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. I yield to the Sena-
 tor from Vermont.
 ~Mpr IKEN...;,Mr. President, it seems
 to me  re      u Tr-we shoot off any more fire-
 works around here, we will not have any
 left for the Fourth of July. Our job now
 is to make certain that we will have the
 Fourth of July from now on, and that
 we have the right to celebrate it. It may
 be all right to shoot off fireworks, but I
 think we are shooting them off too close
 to the gas works to be helpful.
 Like others, I have no doubt that Mr.
 Stevenson might have spoken rather in-
 discreetly in his speeches. He appears to
 be one of the ever-hopeful variety, so
 perhaps we should accept his remarks
 in that sort of hopeful atmosphere.
 I, myself, do not regard Mr. Stevenson
 as being representative of more than one
 section of the Democratic Party. I think
 Mr. Farley represents another viewpoint
 within that party. Perhaps the Senator
 from Texas [Mr. JOHNSON] may repre-
 sent an element greater than the others
 put together. At least, that is what has
 been said. Whatever position they have
 to take, they probably have the right to
 take it.
 However, in view of all the verbal
 fireworks which have taken place, both
 on the Senate floor and around the Na-
 tion, during the last few days, it appears
 to me that we have gone too far not to
 have a discreet, judicious, and careful
 inquiry into the events of the last 2 or 3
 weeks, in the hope that we may fill in
 two or three gaps in our information. I
 do not see how this type of inquiry can
 hurt anyone.  I should think it might
 prove helpful in the long run.  I wish I
 might be present, if that inquiry is made
 by the Senate Committee on Foreign Re-
 lations, which is the place where it
 should be made, to see that there is no
 unfairness during the proceedings.
 If we undertake to suppress an inquiry
 now, it will look to the world as if we
 really had something to cover up.  I do
 not think anyone wants to do that.  I
 do not think we have anything to cover

 I think Mr. Khrushchev got himself on
 one wonderfully hot spot, and he had to
 have time-6 or 8 months, or, heaven
 knows, probably more than that-before
 he could get off the hot spot, and get
 out from under the various pressures
 which have been bearing down on him,
 and which made him scuttle the confer-
 ence.            I do not say he did not want to
 scuttle it anyway, but certainly he came
 to the conference intending to scuttle
 it, one way or another.

 before any attack is made. No one has
 attacked anyone, so far as I know-
 that is to say, no one in this body.   Peo-
 pie outside, who have their impressions,
 can say what they like, for ours is a
 free country.
 I do not know enough about all the
 background and the reasons and the
 explanations of the various statements
 made preliminary to the final break-up
 of the conference, to be able to reach any
 final conclusion.  That is why I think a
 study and anvinquib the Fore
 19tions Co     lumorrow r der.
 I lif'd~2Sse    omorrow morning, at the
 regular meeting of our committee, to
 submit this question; and I hope that
 after thorough discussion, the procedure
 the committee will follow will be agreed
 upon.  I expect the procedure of the
 inquiry to be agreed upon by the mem-
 bers of the committee of both parties,
 because it is entirely in order, and fol-
 lows the usual precedent, which I be-
 lieve always has been followed in the
 past, when anything of importance in
 the international field has occurred.
 I do not think it promotes the effort
 to keep this matter on a nonpartisan
 plane, to indulge in such acrimonious
 attacks here on the floor of the Senate
 on leading Members of either party-
 and, in this case, on Members of my
 party.  I think it is most unfortunate;
 and certainly it is premature, because I
 do not believe any one of us is now able
 to arrive at firm and final conclusions
 in regard to the very tragic event which
 occurred last week, in Paris.
 The only advice I gave to some of my
 friends of the Republican Party was that
 I hoped they would not try to pretend
 that what happened at Paris was a great
 triumph.  I said that if that were done,
 necessarily it would call for rebuttal.  I
 said I hoped we would soberly approach
 this matter, in a serious endeavor to
 determine, first, what happened; and,
 second, the practices and procedures
 which have grown up in our Govern-
 ment.            I do not mean only the practices
 and procedures in the executive branch;
 I think the Congress itself has much to
 learn in this field, and I believe there are
 ways and means by which our pro-
 cedures can be improved.  Last year, the
 Foreign Relations Committee suggested
 ways which I think would have been a
 great improvement; and from time to
 time other Senators make similar sug-
 gestions.  Certainly I do not believe that
 either the Congress or the Executive has
 perfected its methods of dealing with
 these very complex matters.
 So I believe that the purpose of the
 proposed inquiry is, in the first place, to
 understand just what has happened;
 and, in the second place, if the circum-
 stances  call  for it, to make  some
 changes, in order to tighten up the ad-
 ministration.
 But I believe the worst thing, from the
 national point of view and from the
 point of view of the welfare of the Na-
 tion, would be to pretend that we have
 experienced a great triumph, and that
 nothing need be said about what hap-
 pened.  Everyone knows what happened
 is a great tragedy for the entire world.
 Who is to blame, and so forth, is a sub-
 ject of legitimate inquiry.
 But at the moment I do not wish to
 indulge in a debate attacking members
 of my party or members of the other
 party.  At this point, I believe that
 would be quite premature.
 However, if, following inquiry, there
 are found to be reasons for criticizing
 the conduct of our policies, then, of
 course, it will be our duty to do so; and
 I do not believe that any plea for unity
 should foreclose any justified criticism
 based upon an inquiry which is held in
 a sober and responsible manner.
 I am confident that the members of
 the administration, including the Secre-
 tary of State, have no objection at all
 to coming before the Foreign Relations
 Committee and giving their explanation
 of what happened.  That is appropriate.
 That is. what Secretary Dulles did.
 That is what Secretary Acheson always
 did after international meetings.  He
 came before our committee and ex-
 plained what happened, his reasons why,
 and his point of view.  Then it was up
 to us to draw our own conclusions there-
 from.  That is the way I expect to pro-
 ceed now. I think it will be beneficial at
 the proper time to make a report or ob-
 servations or, if conditions warrant it,
 a criticism of the way things have been
 handled.
 In the meantime, I think we ought to
 be careful in what we say, and ought
 not to inflame anyone's thoughts, and
 make sure we do not lose a sense of ob-
 jectivity in forming our judgment on
 what the facts are after we develop
 them in a, proper inquiry.
 I do not propose at this time to pur-
 sue this debate on the substance of the
 speeches or what happened in Paris.
 Mr. SCOTT and Mr. YOUNG of Ohio
 addressed the Chair.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 yield first to the Senator from Ohio.
 Then I shall yield to the Senator from
 Pennsylvania.
 ,,of Ohio.  Mr. President,
 may I say at the outset, I completely
 agree with the statement made today by
 the distinguished Senator from Montana
 [Mr. MANSFIELD], the acting majority
 leader, and I admire very much the state-
 ment made by the distinguished Senator
 from Arkansas [Mr. FULBRrGHT], chair-
 man of the Foreign Relations Commit-
 tee.  I agree with him.  Certainly, the
 distinguished Senator from Vermont
 made a very moderate and very wise
 statement with which all of us can agree.
 Mr. President, unfortunately for Presi-
 dent Eisenhower, and also unfortunately
 for the American people, the law of aver-
 ages caught up with our President.  His
 good luck, over the years seemed to have
 deserted him, and at a time when he
 needed it most.
 Without a doubt, President Eisenhower
 hoped to end his administration in an
 aura of peace and good will.  He had
 been the supreme commander of the
 greatest army ever gathered under the
 bending sky of God.  He had hoped that
 the high point and final public service in
 his life would be that, as Chief Execu-
 tive of the United States, he would be
 regarded by future historians as a peace-
 maker.  He even envisioned himself as
 the father of permanent peace.  Instead
 May 23
 of that, he returned from Paris to Wash-
 ington at a time when the increased ten-
 sion in the cold war between this Nation
 and the Soviet Union has become more
 violent.  In fact, he returns at a time
 when that relationship between our two
 nations could not become much worse,
 except by the temporary ending of dip-
 lomatic relations on the part, of one or
 both nations.
 He himself did not cause this situa-
 tion.  Inept officials in his administra-
 tion created  an appearance of saber
 rattling and jingoism that President
 Eisenhower had wished to avoid.
 President Eisenhower, from the time
 of his 1952 campaign for election-that
 "clean as a hound's tooth" campaign--
 has placed an accent on teamwork on
 the part of all his associates.  Morality
 has been glorified, as is entirely proper,
 yet, in an emergency that occurred due
 to the downing of an American recon-
 naissance plane far within the territory
 of the Soviet Union, American people-
 and in fact, peoples the world over-
 were given conflicting and utterly false
 statements by administration officials in
 authority in the United States.
 Leaders  of  friendly  nations  were
 startled over the muddleheaded, men-
 tally inert, and inept handling of the
 controversy by administration officials
 over the downing of this plane.
 American  prestige  throughout  the
 world dropped, and no one is to blame
 more than officials of the Eisenhower
 administration.
 Doubtless, President Eisenhower him-
 self must share in the responsibility. It
 appears he failed to know personally de-
 tails of the work of our Central Intelli-
 gence Agency.  It may be that had he
 been an alert, active, strong President,
 he would have been in constant touch
 with the actions and activities of all ad-
 ministrative agencies and in position to
 hold in check any which directly or in-
 directly acted in violation of the law
 and customs of nations.
 arently the, President had no
 now edge that our U-2 plane pene-
 tra a                                                                                                 bdhTric Ehe Iron curtain in an
 aerial reconnaissance and was approxi-
 mately 1,300 miles within the borders of
 the Soviet Union a few days before the
 last Big Four summit conference meeting
 to be held during his administration.
 What should have been feared, oc-
 curred.  This resulted in a propaganda
 victory for Premier Khrushchev, who in-
 stantly,  violently,  and  unmercifully
 pushed his advantage to the uttermost.
 Leaders of  friendly  nations were
 shocked and our Chief Executive was
 humiliated by the tongue lashing from
 Premier Khrushchev brought on by the
 failure of his trusted subordinates.
 .It is true President Eisenhower en-
 dured with dignity and restraint a
 vituperative face-to-face tongue lashing
 from the Communist Dictator Khru-
 shchev.  Personally, I would prefer a
 President who would have lashed back
 instantly and forcefully with some blunt,
 uncensored Texas, Missouri, or Massa-
 chusetts language and plain spoken
 epithets.
 Mr. President,  I assert that what
 seems to be the Eisenhower concept of
 the Presidency  of the United States,
 Approved For Release 2004/05/13: CIA-RDP90T00782R000100050001-8

 frequently  by  remote  control  from
 Augusta and Gettysburg, and frequently
 altogether at the discretion of subordi-
 nates, is not sufficient for 1960 and this
 grim period of international anarchy.
 Operating the Presidency on a part-
 time basis and not in the personalized
 manner of Abraham Lincoln, Theodore
 Roosevelt, Woodrow Wilson, Franklin D.
 Roosevelt, and Harry Truman, removed
 President Eisenhower from key decisions
 and left our allies and our own citizens,
 even President Eisenhower himself, in a
 state of uncertainty about what was
 going on.
 In addition,  Secretary  of  Defense
 Gates calling the alert of the Armed
 Forces for Sunday, May 15, was an ex-
 traordinarily  reckless  act.                           Bear  in
 mind, Sunday, May 15, was a bitter
 day for us.  A mischance had occurred.
 Blunder was compounded upon blun-
 der.                      The tension of the cold war be-
 tween the Soviet Union and this Nation
 was increased.
 The slogan of peace and prosperity
 was not being uttered in even the softest
 whisper.  This was the hour and day
 picked by Secretary of_lefense Gates for
 an exercise to para06 the armed might
 of this Nation before the world.  This,
 added to false statements and deceit and
 the  confusion of a right-about-face
 statement, plus a bristling declaration
 that invading the air over the Soviet
 Union was necessary, plus an inference
 that this practice would be continued-
 all of this was just a little too much.
 Then, a little too late, came the state-
 ment backing down on the previous
 statement that aerial spying would be
 continued.  This despite the fact that
 the Vice President had publicly re-
 affirmed the policy of continuing aerial
 reconnaissance.
 Mr. President, we can truly say that
 these have not been our proudest hours.
 I thank the Senator from Montana for
 yielding to me.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  I yield to the Sen-
 ator from Pennsylvania.
 Mr. SCOTT.  Mr. President, would the
 Senator from Montana at this time con-
 sider yielding the floor?
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Does the Senator
 have in mind raising a question of per-
 sonal privilege?
 Mr. SCOTT.  No, I do not.
 Mr.  MANSFIELD. Because,  If  the
 Senator did, I wanted to read rule XIX.
 Mr. SCOTT.  If the Senator does that,
 he may force me into raising a point of
 personal privilege. I hope not to be
 pressed into doing so.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  I had understood
 the Senator was going to rise to a point
 of personal privilege, but I understand
 now he is not, and therefore I am de-
 lighted to yield to him.
 Mr. SCOTT.  I thank the Senator
 from Montana.
 Mr. President, am I recognized in my
 own right?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.
 Mr. SCOTT.  I thank the Chair. I
 had originally planned to raise the point
 of personal privilege, because I wished
 to make it crystal clear that I did not
 at any time, nor have I ever at any time,
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 Impugned. the patriotism of any other
 Member or of any candidate for the
 Presidency, and I do not now impugn the
 patriotism of any Senator, or of Gover-
 nor Stevenson, whose  recent unfor-
 tunate remarks have infuriated a good
 part of our Nation.
 Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. SCOTT.  If I may do so briefly,
 I am glad to yield.
 Mr. SYMINGTON.  My remarks will
 be very brief. I thank the Senator from
 Pennsylvania.
 The statement issued by Gov. Adlai
 Stevenson was issued to the press May
 18, and I shall quote it.
 My recollection is that  the young man
 was brought to my home by friends.  I never
 give  exclusive  interviews without request.
 And he would not have received one had
 he asked in such circumstances.
 As I recall, he wanted to discuss all of
 the problems of Europe; and evidently con-
 fused discussion with opinion.
 What he reports me as saying have, of
 course, never been my views and are not my
 views today.
 The most charitable explanation of such
 irresponsibility, presumption and discourtesy
 is that his English was poor and my French
 no better.
 I thank the Senator.
 Mr. SCOTT.  Mr. President, if the
 Senator from Missouri had been on the
 floor-or, if he was on the floor and had
 been paying attention-he would have
 heard me read several times part of that
 statement myself. I added that Mr.
 Boulay, among those who know him, is
 known to speak English very well, and
 therefore is presumed to be able to un-
 derstand English when it is addressed to
 him.
 I further suggested that the way to
 clarify this matter is to have the testi-
 mony of Mr. Boulay and to have the
 testimony of Governor Stevenson to see
 what was really said.
 However, I rose for the purpose of
 saying that I do not impugn the patriot-
 ism of.anyone. I regret that the Senator
 from Missouri, who is my very good
 friend, used the phrase with reference
 to myself of "considering the source." I
 am not a candidate for the Presidency.
 I hope that "considering the source" has
 no reference to Presidential candidacy.
 I will leave the remark where it has
 been made, since I rose in good faith
 and I am proceeding in good faith to
 make a certain point, which is that
 when I spoke on the floor about a week
 ago I praised the distinguished majority
 leader [M:r. JOHNSON of Texas] and the
 distinguished majority whip, the Sena-
 tor from Montana [Mr. MANSFIELD] for
 their patriotism and for their true show
 of a bipartisan approach to these criti-
 cal circumstances.
 However, after that speech a certain
 speech was made by the former Gover-
 nor of Illinois, and a certain speech was
 made by the distinguished, patriotic,
 and able Senator from Massachusetts
 [Mr. KENNEDY].  Those speeches did ap-
 pear in the press.                                                        An issue was raised
 by those Speeches which had not been
 raised on the floor, and which all of us
 had expressed the hope would not be
 raised.  That issue was whether Presi-
 dent Eisenhower should apologize to
 Khrushchev or whether President Eisen-
 hower should seek to reopen the nego-
 tiations with Khrushchev by retreating
 from a previous position.
 A further issue raised again, I will say,
 by my friend the Senator from Ohio
 [Mr. YOUNG]  a moment ago, was the.
 issue of the action of the Secretary of
 Defense in calling an air alert.
 Therefore, these matters become legi-
 timate subjects of discussion on the
 floor of the Senate.
 My answer as to whether the Presi-
 dent should have apologized is that, in
 my opinion, he should not have.  My
 answer as to whether the President
 should have appeased Mr. Khrushchev,
 or reopened the negotiations at the ex-
 pense of an expression of apology or
 regret on our part, is that he should not
 have.
 My answer as to the calling of an air
 alert ought to be familiar to all of the
 American people.
 The tragedy at Pearl Harbor occurred
 immediately after the break up of a
 conference with the Japanese leaders.
 Lest another tragedy occur in America,
 the Secretary of Defense, undoubtedly
 with the approval of the President, cer-
 tainly as a matter of policy, upon the
 breakup of this conference, or observ-
 ing that it was about to terminate, in
 any event, put this country on an air
 alert.
 Some have suggested that President
 Eisenhower should have met Khru-
 shchev with his own kind of attack, that
 he should have lashed back, that he
 should have assaulted Khrushchev with
 similar tactics.
 Mr. President, Theodore Roosevelt a
 long time ago advised us to speak softly
 and to carry a big stick.  I do not be-
 lieve that President Eisenhower should
 have demeaned himself by adopting the
 method, the manner, the tactics or the
 language of Khrushchev.    I believe he
 was correct in speaking with dignity at
 that time, and I believe he was right in
 showing that America had a big stick,
 by reason of the calling of the air alert.
 I hope, if there is to be an investiga-
 tion-if the Committee on Foreign Rela-
 tions believes such an investigation
 should be had-that an investigation
 will be made of American foreign policy
 as a whole, if the committee wishes to
 do so, and that such an investigation
 will also look into the charges which I
 regard as being unfounded, as being
 politically inspired, as being motivated
 by desires to be either President or Sec-
 retary of State.
 All of these charges-some of which
 would appear to be reckless, unfounded,
 and certainly unduly deferential to the
 leader of the Soviet Government at this
 time-ought also to be included in such
 an investigation.
 Finally, Mr. President, the Russians
 have asked for a hearing at the United
 Nations, charging the United States as an
 aggressor. Surely, the Russian Govern-
 ment should not be given ammunition by
 any responsible American and should
 not have the benefit of being able to argue
 that responsible Americans agree with
 Khrushchev that he ought to have an

 apology. The Russians should not have
 the benefit of this attitude of some peo-
 ple that the Russians were right and we
 were wrong.
 It would be well, If this Is to become an
 issue in a political campaign, that we
 have a moratorium on it until after the
 issue raised by the Russians has been
 fully heard in the United Nations, so that
 we do not furnish them with ammunition.
 Mr. President, I am very glad that
 President Eisenhower, no matter what
 any other person may think, did not
 crawl on his belly to a bully.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. SCOTT. I am glad to yield.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  The Senator rec-
 ommends that there should be a mora-
 torium on this discussion. What puzzles
 me, and what I still do not understand,
 is why the Senator and his colleagues
 chose this particular time to precipitate
 this violent attack upon certain leaders
 of the Democrats. We did not open up
 this matter.  What is the logic of the
 Republicans choosing Monday morning,
 immediately before the United Nations
 meeting is to consider these charges, to
 open up this violent partisan attack?
 Mr. SCOTT.  I am glad to point out
 to the Senator from Arkansas that these
 remarks should not be considered violent
 attacks.  They should be considered as
 rebuttal and reply to the very unfortu-
 nate statements attributed to at least
 two responsible leaders of the Demo-
 cratic Party, including the titular head
 of the Democratic Party.
 I seek to express, as I think surely we
 should express, our regret that these
 particular statements have been made, if
 in fact they were made during the past
 week.
 I appreciate the blandness of the com-
 ment of the Senator from Arkansas, but
 it does not conceal who made the state-
 ments.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  The statement at-
 tributed to Mr. Stevenson he has very
 clearly denied he made. I think a great
 deal was made of that.
 Mr. SCOTT.  If the Senator will per-
 mit,- Mr. Stevenson has not withdrawn
 the statements which he made on other
 occasions last week within the United
 States in public bodies, which were pub-
 licly reported. He has merely refused
 to accept the quotations attributed to
 him in the article appearing in a French
 newspaper.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  I do not wish to
 argue the merit of that point.  It seems
 to me rather ill advised to begin an open
 and very strong attack upon the Demo-
 crats before any Member of this body,
 at least of whom I am aware, has tried
 to be critical at all.
 I have not been critical. I conscious-
 1Y refrained from making critical com-
 ments on this subject, both when I ar-
 rived.at the airport and later this morn-
 ing in order that there might be a proper
 inquiry.  I did not wish to inspire the
 very kind of political attack which has
 taken place today.  I was taken aback
 by it. I do not think it makes it easier
 for us to conduct a reasonable, objective,
 and quiet inquiry into what has taken
 place.
 Mr. SCOTT.  I say to the - Senator
 from Arkansas, for whom I have the
 highest respect, that the Senator is evi-
 dently not aware of the statement issued
 by the Democratic Advisory Council and
 approved by the membership, including
 a number of Senators, or the action
 taken by at least 12 Members of the
 other body, all of which contributed to
 initiating an unfortunate controversy.
 Does the Senator from Missouri wish
 me to yield?
 Mr. SYMINGTON.  Mr. President, I
 understood the Senator was yielding the
 floor.
 Mr. ANDERSON rose.
 Mr. SCOTT.  I shall be glad to yield
 to the Senator from New Mexico [Mr.
 ANDERSON]  and then I shall yield the
 floor.
 Mr. ANDERSON.  May I express to
 the Senator from Pennsylvania [Mr.
 SCOTT] the hope that he will take a good
 look at his language, because I know he
 did not mean it when he said:
 It is my hope that neither the distin-
 guished Senator from Massachusetts, Mr.
 KENNEDY.. nor that other candidate for the
 Presidency, Governor Stevenson will-either
 of them-brand themselves as turncoats.
 Mr. SCOTT.  "Turnquotes," Is the
 phrase. I shall be glad to examine the
 language..
 Mr. ANDERSON. I wish the Senator
 would, because it comes close to violating
 the rule. The transcript reads:
 So it is my hope that they will relieve
 themselves of the curse of suspicion of ap-
 peasement.
 I wondered if the Senator intended
 that language.
 Mr. SCOTT. I appreciate the sugges-
 tion of the Senator from New Mexico,
 and if my language appears at any point
 to be intemperate, I shall be glad to re-
 vise it in accordance with my own better
 judgment, if it seems necessary.
 Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. SCOTT. I yield.
 Mr. SYMINGTON. If the Senator will
 withdraw his remarks with respect to
 Adlai Stevenson and the Senator from
 Massachusetts [Mr. KENNEDY], I will be
 glad to withdraw mine.
 Mr. SCOTT. I must decline the offer
 of my friend from Missouri.  The re-
 marks of Adlai Stevenson and the Sen-
 ator from. Massachusetts [Mr. KENNEDY]
 appeared in the public press and un-
 fortunately cannot now be withdrawn.
 Mr. SYMINGTON.  Mr. President, I
 then ask unanimous consent that the
 reporter read into the RECORD the state-
 ment made by the Senator from Penn-
 sylvania.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the
 Senator from Pennsylvania yield the
 floor?
 Mr. SCOTT.  I wish to address the
 same question to the Senator from Mis-
 souri  [Mr. SYMINGTON]  which was ad-
 dressed to me by the Senator from Mon-
 tana [Mr. MANSFIELD], and that is: Is
 the Senator rising on a question of per-
 sonal privilege?
 Mr. SYMINGTON. W. President, I
 am not rising on a question of personal
 privilege.
 May ,23
 Mr, SCOTT.  Then I will yield the
 floor.
 Mr. SYMINGTON.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the steno-
 graphic record be read at this point to
 the Senate.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection?  The Chair hears none, and
 the reporter will bring in the transcript.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 wish to make a parliamentary inquiry.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The
 Senator will state it.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  What particular
 part of the transcript is to be read?
 Mr. SYMINGTON.  The part which
 the Senator from New Mexico [Mr.
 ANDERSON] and I requested to be brought
 to the floor of the Senate with respect to
 the remarks about the Senator from
 Massachusetts [Mr. KENNEDY] and for-
 mer Gov. Adlai Stevenson.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection to the clerk reading the tran-
 script as described?  The Chair hears
 none, and the clerk will read it.
 The legislative clerk read as follows:
 I might also add, in connection with the
 statement of the distinguished Senator from
 Massachusetts, Mr. KENNEDY, as reported in
 the Portland Oregonian,- that the Senator
 himself said:
 "Khrushchev laid down two conditions to
 President Eisenhower for going on with the
 summit meeting.  One was to apologize.  I
 think that might have been possible to do."
 Then the quotation goes on to other mat-
 ters.
 The report in the Oregonian is that.,
 "Later KENNEDY modified the word 'apolo-
 gize,' and said the President might 'express
 regret."'
 It is my hope that neither the distin-
 guished Senator from Massachusetts nor that
 other candidate for the Presidency, Governor
 Stevenson, will-either one of them--brand
 himself as a turncoat.  So it is my hope that
 they will relieve themselves of the curse of
 suspicion of appeasement, and it is my hope
 that the unity, which started out so well in
 support of the President and in support of
 the administration, may somehow be found
 again.
 But as Mr. Farley has so well said, he has
 no part in the appeasement process as exem-
 plified by the unfortunate statement of Gov-
 ernor Stevenson.
 He said it did not represent his views and
 that "the most charitable explanation of
 such irresponsibility, presumption, and dis-
 courtesy is that his English was poor and
 my French no better."
 Mr. SCOTT. I believe the clerk is still
 reading from my statement, but I call
 attention to the fact that the word is
 "turn-quote."
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The
 Senator from Missouri has the floor.
 Mr. SYMINGTON. Mr. President, the
 RECORD has been read to my satisfaction
 at this point, and unless the Senator
 from Pennsylvania [Mr. SCOTT] would
 like to have the reading continued, I
 wish no further part of the RECORD read.
 Mr. SCOTT.  I request that no fur-
 ther portion of the RECORD be read.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I rise to
 a point of parliamentary inquiry.
 The   PRESIDING OFFICER.   The
 Senator will state it.
 Mr. MORSE. I have not heard the de-
 bate except in the last few minutes.                                                                                         I
 shall make some comment on my own

 Approved For Release 2004/05/13 : CIA-RDP90T00782R000100050001-8
 time shortly. My parliamentary inquiry
 is this: Is it proposed that the RECORD
 be changed in any way from what was
 stated on the floor of the Senate today?
 Mr. SYMINGTON. No. In answer to
 the inquiry of my friend from Oregon
 [Mr. MORSE], I state that the reverse is
 now true.
 Mr. ANDERSON. I wished to suggest
 to the Senator from Pennsylvania that
 the term "turncoat" is an unfortunate
 term, and also the expression "suspicion
 of appeasement" is an unfortunate term,
 and I expressed the hope that those
 terms might be modified.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I wish
 to make a parliamentary inquiry.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The
 Senator will state it.
 Mr. MORSE., May terms spoken on
 the floor of the Senate, no matter how
 unfortunate they may be, but neverthe-
 less spoken in debate, be changed by the
 spokesman or withdrawn by the spokes-
 man in the absence of unanimous con-
 sent?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER  (Mr.
 CARLSON in the chair). I am advised by
 the Parliamentarian that a Senator may
 correct an error which may have been
 made, but he may not substantially
 change the context.
 Mr. MORSE.  Will the Chair advise
 the Senator from Oregon the definition
 of the word "error" under the ruling?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The
 Chair will state that such an error would
 be a misstatement, possibly a misquota-
 tion, as to the form of the statement, but
 not as to content.
 Mr. MORSE. Not as to content.
 Mr. SYMINGTON.  Mr. President,
 does the Senator wish me to yield fur-
 ther?
 Mr. MORSE. Mr. President, I should
 like to have the parliamentary situation
 cleared up.  So that the RECORD may be
 perfectly clear, speaking hypothetically,
 if a Senator makes a statement which is
 critical of some Government policy or
 some Government official and then has
 a second thought minutes later which
 causes him to wish he had not said
 what he had said and asks to have the
 matter stricken from the RECORD, does
 such request require unanimous consent?
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.   The
 Chair holds that such a request would
 require unanimous consent.
 Mr. MORSE.  I thank the Chair for
 the ruling, and I wish to serve notice
 now that I shall object to any change
 in today's RECORD.
 Mr. SYMINGTON.  Mr. President-
 Mr. SCOTT.                  Mr. President, will the
 Senator from Missouri [Mr. SYMINGEON]
 yield?
 Mr. SYMINGTON. I yield.
 Mr. SCOTT.    I would like to make
 clear, so there will be no misunderstand-
 ing concerning the remarks of the Sen-
 ator from Oregon [Mr. MORSE], who was
 not present when the statement was
 made, that I have no intention of chang-
 ing the sense or meaning of anything I
 have said. If I have made grammatical
 errors or. errors of syntax, I reserve the
 same right which is available to other
 Senators to make such corrections; and
 I will, of course, be my own judge.  I
 No. 93-4
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 say to the Senator from Oregon, as to
 what changes or revisions I make, exer-
 cising the same privilege as is available
 to the Senator from Oregon.  But I
 wish now to make it perfectly clear that
 I reject any inference that I desire to
 withdraw the meaning of anything that
 I have said.
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. SYMINGTON.  I yield to the Sen-
 ator from Oregon.
 Mr. MORSE.  I assure the Senator
 from Pennsylvania that I made no im-
 plication that the Senator had any in-
 tention to change any of his remarks.
 There was a request or suggestion made
 that an opportunity be offered to change
 remarks.  To that, I object.  I merely
 wish to say that the Senator from Penn-
 sylvania, under the rule, is free to com-
 ply with the rule, but when he says he
 will be his own judge as to what he will
 change, I say the Senate will be the
 final judge in case he makes a change
 outside the rule.
 f Delaware.  Mr.
 Press en , or   e past hour and a half
 we have heard a series of nonpolitical,
 nonpartisan statements from both sides
 of the aisle. All of these remarks con-
 tained suggestions about what should or
 should not have been done at the sum-
 mit, as well as attempted to assess the
 blame for what was or was not done.
 In making these remarks, many Mem-
 bers of the Senate, as well as most of
 the presidential candidates, have been
 quoted.  However, in listening to these
 remarks, l: note that one very important
 presidential candidate has been ignored.
 To my knowledge, he has not been quot-
 ed in the Senate today.  Yet it is my
 opinion that this presidential candidate,
 in his speech on the floor of the Senate
 last week, made one of the most states-
 manlike speeches which have been made
 in connection with the summit confer-
 ence, and again, in Indianapolis, Ind.,
 `last week made another very appropri-
 ate comment, one which I believe every
 Member of the Senate would do well to
 ponder before we get too partisan.
 I refer to a statement made by our
 majority leader, the senior Senator from
 Texas [Mr. JOHNSON], in which, when
 he was asked to assess blame for the
 Paris fiasco, he observed:
 Any jackass can kick down a barn, but it
 takes a good carpenter to build one.
 [Laughter.]
 ONE LESSON FROM THE SUMMIT
 Mr. SYM        .  Mr. President, an
 uULL ~o We    onsideration at the
 summit tragedy was the administra-
 tion's fiscal policy of placing expendi-
 ture ceilings above military strength.
 If this administration had approached
 the summit conference from a position
 of relative strength over the Commu-
 nists, the rude but shrewd Kremlin chief
 would have been less belligerent.
 The Soviet leader, on the othe hand,
 approached the summit with certain
 knowledge about:
 Our small and relatively immobile
 ground forces with their antiquated
 equipment:
 Their rocket and missile superiority.
 Our failure to provide an airborne
 alert capability and the consequent vul-
 nerability of our retaliatory strength.
 Their great numerical, superiority in
 submarines, with and without missiles.
 Moreover, the Soviet leader knew that
 the United States would have been
 stronger in all of these respects if our
 military experts, rather than our budget
 bookkeepers, had been listened to.
 Instead major attention . has been
 given in this country toward feeding the
 American people a diet of complacency,
 backed up by appealing slogans.
 We cannot afford to waste any time
 in abandoning these policies of weakness.
 In fact, if we do not act promptly, it may
 soon be too late, because, at our present
 pace, and under existing policies, we
 may find ourselves shortly in a very
 critical position.
 Therefore, I recommend the follow-
 ing program now:
 That the Secretary of Defense be au-
 thorized and directed, at once, to raise
 overall expenditure ceilings in his De-
 partment so as to carry out this program.
 That the Secretary of Defense direct
 the removal of all overtime limitations
 on high priority projects and order a
 sharp acceleration in those projects.
 That the Air Force be authorized and
 directed to take the procurement and
 crew-training actions for the SAC air
 alert capability which General Power
 recommended, and that the, Congress
 appropriate  $415  million  above  the
 budget request for that purpose.
 That the Congress appropriate $360
 million above the budget request for go-

 B-70 weapons system project.
 That the Congress appropriate $1.3

 quest for acceleration of the Atlas-Titan,
 Minuteman, Polaris, Hound Dog, and
 Sky-Bolt programs.
 That the Congress authorize an in-

 870,000 to 925,000, and appropriate $120

 that $800 million be appropriated over
 and above the budget request for pro-
 curement of new equipment for the
 Army.
 That the Congress authorize an in-

 an additional $40 million for that pur-

 That the Congress appropriate $465

 The above recommendations for air
 alert, B-70, missiles, Army personnel,
 Army procurement, Marine personnel,

 amount to $31/2 billion over and above
 the budget request for those progams.
 This total of $31/2 billion is the equiva-

 GRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 W. C. HANDY, "FATHER OF THE
 BLUES"
 Mr. KEFAUVER.  Mr. President (on
 May 2 I made remarks and received
 unanimous consent to have printed in
 the Appendix of the CONGRESSIONAL REC-
 ORD a biographical sketch entitled "The
 Legend of W. C. Handy, Father of the
 Blues."
 I ask unanimous consent that my in-
 troductory remarks may be expanded to
 include, immediately after the sentence
 "The general chairman was Mr. Frank
 R. Ahlgren, of the Memphis Commercial
 Appeal," the material which I send to
 the desk.
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 At this point I should like to say that due
 recognition should be given to all of those
 who participated in making this a memo-
 rable event.  Because of their untiring ef-
 forts on Sunday, May 1, 1960, the city of
 Memphis added another page to the history
 book of the Nation.
 It was not an easy job to make this dream
 of Frank Ahlgren's come true.  However,
 when he told his dream to a group of out-
 standing civic-minded men from all walks
 of life, they all put their shoulders to the
 wheel and gratuitously agreed to shoulder
 their respective burdens to make this dream
 become a reality.
 It took almost 2 years of tireless, unselfish
 work.  Many details had to be ironed out.
 First of all a considerable amount of money
 had to be raised.
 He began his activities in 1958.  Realizing
 that the late W. C. Handy was a distin-
 guished composer-member of the American
 Society of Composers, Authors, and Pub-
 lishers (ASCAP), Mr. Ahlgren contacted Paul
 Cunningham, at that time the president of
 the American Society of Composers, Au-
 thors, and Publishers.  Mr. Ahlgren Inter-
 ested Mr. Cunningham and ASCAP to the
 extent that this 'great society, which not
 only protects the interests of its members
 but never forgets them or their loved ones
 after the member passes on,  immediately
 agreed to allocate a $5,000 gift toward the
 erection of the statue that now stands in
 Handy Park in the city of Memphis.  From
 this sizable contribution thousands of oth-
 ers gave what they could.
 When sufficient funds were raised, Mr.
 Ahlgren commissioned the famous Italian
 sculptor, Prof. Leone Tomassi, of the Mari-
 nelli Foundation at Florence, Italy, to mold
 into golden bronze the 8-foot statue of the
 never-to-be-forgotten W. C. Handy.
 After this was arranged other important
 details had to be worked out.  Again Frank
 Ahlgren, ably assisted by that great civil
 leader, Lt. George Lee, and that indefatiga-
 ble worker, George Sisler, of the Memphis
 Commercial  Appeal,  immediately  arranged
 through ASCAP in New York to bring down
 to Memphis a galaxy of stars.  Among them
 were Juanita Hall (of Rodgers and Hammer-
 stein's "Flower Drum Song"); Mahalia Jack-
 son, great delineator of spirituals;                  Lonnie
 Sattin, recording star of Warner Bros. rec-
 ords; Eubie Blake and Noble Sissle, famous
 ASCAP composers and a newcomer from the
 recording field, Was Damita Jo.
 With this array of taleht ASCAP, through
 Mr. Cunningham, reached out and arranged
 with Mr. Hank Slavick of television station
 WMCT to televise  an  hour-long program
 before  and during the unveiling of the
 statue.
 In years to come whenever I bear a W. C.
 Handy song, I shall always remember the
 city of Memphis on that day of days when
 a group of civic-minded men arranged a
 lasting tribute, attended by thousands, to
 the "father of the blues."
 Furthermore, I shall always remember the
 fitting climax that came long after the eve-
 ning sun went down when from New York
 City Mr.  Lid  Sullivan,  on  his  nationally
 televised show, dramatically told the Nation
 how the city of Memphis made history on
 Sunday, May 1, 1960.
 May 23
 tions.  This warrant is only granted
 when the court is satisfied that reason-
 able grounds exist that evidence of
 crimes will be obtained as a result of the
 wiretap.
 The inability to introduce these wire-
 taps stems from the decisions in the
 U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the
 Second Circuit in the case of People
 against O'Rourke, which follows the de-
 cisions in the United States v. Benanti
 (355 U.S.96).
 In its decision, the Supreme Court
 ruled wiretap evidence obtained by State
 officers under authority of a State law
 was inadmissible in the Federal courts.
 The language of the decision left a cloud
 on the right of States to legally author-
 ize law-enforcement agencies to obtain.
 court warrants to intercept communica-
 tions under proper safeguards.
 The  lower  courts-People  against
 O'Rourke-have followed the line laid
 down by the Supreme Court and have in-
 dicated that, while not enjoining the
 State courts, the introduction of wire-
 tap evidence by State officials in State
 courts would be in violation of section
 605, Federal Communications Act of
 1934, and thus would constitute a crime.
 The district attorney pointed out that
 the inability to use wiretaps in local
 law-enforcement cases is a severe blow
 to the side of law and order.  He ex-
 pressed the hope that Congress would be
 able to do something in this session so
 that one of our most effective tools
 against bigtime racketeers and hoods
 would not have been removed.
 On January 16, 1958, shortly after the
 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in
 the Benanti_ case, I introduced a bill,
 S. 3013--85th Congress, 2d session-
 amending section 605 of the Communi-
 cations Act, to clarify the right of State
 law enforcement agencies to use wire-
 taps to uncover evidence of the com-
 mission of serious crimes.
 The Supreme Court in the Benanti
 case did not rule an constitutional ques-
 tions.  The decision was based solely on
 the interpretation of the intention of
 Congress when it passed section 605 of
 the Federal Communications Act of 1934,
 which declares:
 No person not being authorized by the
 sender shall intercept any communication
 and divulge or publish the existence, con-
 tents, substance, purport, effect, or meaning
 of such intercepted communication to any
 person.
 It is my belief that Congress, in the
 enactment of section 605, never intended
 to cripple and hamper law enforcement
 agencies in their efforts to stamp out
 crime and punish criminals.
 When I introduced S. 3013, 1 predicted
 that the detection, investigation, and
 prosecution of crime, particularly or-
 ganized crime, would be seriously han-
 dicapped and weakened by the Supreme
 Court decision that is proving to be
 true.  In many cases, prosecution and
 investigation of crimes would be com-
 pletely thwarted and would collapse
 were wiretapping to be denied to the
 law enforcement agencies.
 Recent developments show that the
 court decisions have created an in-
 ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES ON THE PART
 OF  LABOR  RACKETEERS  AND
 MANAGEMENT
 Mr. McCLELLAN. Mr. President, dur-
 ing the course of the hearings of the
 Senate Select Committee on Improper
 Activities in the Labor or Management
 Field, we have on numerous occasions
 communicated with local law enforce-
 ment authorities when our investiga-
 tions have disclosed illegal activities on
 the part of labor racketeers or manage-
 ment.
 I should like to place in the RECORD
 an editorial of the Long Island Daily
 Press, dated May 17, 1960, entitled "Vic-
 tory and. Warning," an editorial of
 Newsday of the same date, entitled "A
 Big Victory," as well as a letter dated
 May 18, 1960, from the district attorney
 of Nassau County, N.Y., Mr. Manuel W.
 Levine, enclosing these editorial com-
 ments on the, successful prosecution of
 labor racketeers who operated juke box
 Local 266 of the Teamsters Union.
 Both the officials of this union and
 the owners of a juke box company were
 convicted of conspiracy.  The officials
 of this local were also convicted on
 charges  of  coercion  and  extortion.
 These convictions were hailed by the
 newspapers as a great victory on the side
 of law enforcement.
 I may say that much of the informa-
 tion upon which these prosecutions were
 based was developed by the Senate select'
 committee.
 I wish to commend and congratulate
 Mr. Manuel W. Levine, the district at-
 torney of Nassau County, N.Y., for the
 monumental accomplishment of secur-
 ing convictions of these racketeers after
 a trial which lasted for 31/2 months.
 The district attorney in his letter
 pointed out that it was unfortunate that
 some of the defendants were freed from
 prosecution due to inability of the prose-
 cutor to introduce into evidence certain
 wiretaps which would have proved them
 guilty of a crime.
 I understand that had they been per-
 mitted to use wiretap evidence which
 was available to them, in all probability
 all these defendants would have been
 convicted.  Those who escaped, escaped
 upon that one technicality.
 These were taps made pursuant to
 New York State laws and pursuant to a
 New York State court order.  Some
 States, such as New York State, have
 enacted laws to enable their enforcement
 agencies 'to intercept communications
 under proper safeguards and to elimi-
 nate the dangers of promiscuous and im-
 proper use. In New York, for example,
 the enforcement agencies must apply to
 the court of highest original jurisdiction

 subsistence payments for retraining, $1.5
 million for vocational training grants,
 and $4.5 million for technical assist-
 ance."
 The bill provides the following criteria
 in order to define eligibility for de-
 pressed-area aid:
 First. Unemployment of 12 percent of
 the civilian labor force persisting for 12
 months;
 Second. Unemployment of 9 percent of
 this group for 15 out of 18 months;
 3. Unemployment Of 6 percent of this
 group for 18 out of 24 months"
 The proponents of this measure define
 their objectives in the preamble of the
 bill, as follows:
 The Congress declares that the mainte-
 nance of the National economy at a high
 level is vital to the best interests of the
 United States, but that some of our commu-
 nities are suffering substantial and persistent
 unemployment and underemployment; that
 such unemployment and underemployment
 cause hardship to many individuals and their
 families and detracts from the national wel-
 fare by wasting vital human resources; that
 to overcome this problem the Federal Gov-
 ernment, in cooperation with the States,
 should help areas of substantial and per-
 sistent unemployment  and  underemploy-
 ment to take effective steps in planning and
 financing  their  economic redevelopment;
 that Federal assistance to communities, in-
 dustries, enterprises, and individuals in areas
 needing redevelopment should enable such
 areas to achieve lasting improvement and
 enhance the domestic prosperity by the es-
 tablishment of stable and diversified local
 economies; and that under the provisions of
 this  act  new  employment  opportunities
 should be created by developing and expand-
 ing new and existing facilities and resources
 without substantially reducing employment
 in other areas of the United States 45
 The Department of Labor makes regu-
 lar reports on 149 communities, in terms
 of the percentage of unemployment pre-
 vailing among the civilian labor force.
 Based on these studies, early in 1959, ap-
 proximately 20 of these areas would meet
 one of the criteria set forth in S. 722
 for depressed-area aid 49   The adminis-
 tration, the Republican and Democratic
 congressional leadership, as well as the
 supporters of the more liberal bill re-
 ferred to above, are in agreement that
 problem, which justifies some Feder
 assistance.  At the present time, mo
 existing depressed areas fall into on
 of the following categories:
 Coal-mining towns in Pennsylvania,
 West Virginia, eastern Kentucky, and
 sections of adjoining States; particularly
 hard hit are anthracite mining areas
 such as the Wyoming Valley of Pennsyl-
 vania-for example Scranton, Pa.
 New England towns in which textile
 employment has materially declined; for
 example, Lawrence, Mass.
 Areas where employment in railroad
 shops was reduced as a result of diesel-

 Resort and other areas which have
 never established a solid industrial base
 sufficient to support full-time employ-
 ment of the community's labor force;

 on a natural resource which has been
 largely exhausted-northern Michigan,
 Minnesota, and Wisconsin towns former-
 ly dependent on copper or iron mining
 or lumber; for example, Iron Mountain,
 Mich.47
 One-industry towns are characteris-
 tic of many shipbuilding industries.
 Before  discarding  existing  programs
 which enable us to maintain necessary
 facilities, careful consideration must be
 given to the ultimate cost to all taxpay-
 ers of creating additional depressed
 areas.  'These costs include not only pos-
 sible Federal grants, but, in addition, the
 loss of existing tax revenues.  Most im-
 portant is the loss of personal dignity
 for the individual directly concerned,
 and, for the community, the loss of the
 skills he possesses.
 Inasmuch as shipbuilding subsidies
 are admittedly the only means of meet-
 ing the urgent problems of national de-
 fense under a series of probable condi-
 tions in a future emergency, it is fool-
 hardy to attempt to save less than $150
 million :in gross outlays and thereby de-
 stroy an essential industry.  Further-
 more,  these savings  are   ephemeral.
 The ultimate cost includes a loss of reve-
 nues as well as expenditures to support
 new nonproductive Federal programs.
 Ships  or  any  other necessary ele-
 ment in our national defense are prefer-
 able to make-work projects which are
 implied in all of the depressed area leg-
 islation which has been before the Con-
 gress.  Under existing world tensions,
 and with rapid technological progress
 on so many different fronts, we cannot
 afford to become dependent on other na-
 tions to provide advanced designs for
 our merchant marine and naval auxil-
 iaries.
 FOREIGN POLICY PROBLEMS
 r. President, I wish
 toI~~!!1ments on some of the
 foreign policy problems which confront
 the Republic. I am not surprised at the
 Republican attack which has been made
 today on the floor of the Senate on
 Adlai Stevenson, because the Republi-
 cans very well know that if Adlai Steven-
 son should be nominated at the Demo-
 cratic National Convention in Los An-
 geles,  he  would  be  overwhelmingly
 elected President of the United States in
 November 1960.
 This is a typical Republican down-
 grading strategy which we on this side
 of the aisle must expect in the months
 ahead.  In fact, we must expect it re-
 gardless of which Democrat is nomi-
 nated.
 Adlai Stevenson is one of the greatest
 minds in American public life, and the
 White House calls for a great mind.
 We have sorely needed one in the White
 House for almost 8 years.
 As Democrats we have the responsi-
 bility in the campaign ahead to discuss
 openly and frankly with the American
 people the issues of American foreign
 policy.
 I want the RECORD to show this after-
 noon that I stand behind every word
 Adlai Stevenson spoke in his Chicago
 speech which has been referred to. I am
 glad the Senator from Pennsylvania
 [Mr. CLARK] has already put it in the
 RECORD. It was a typical, statesmanlike
 speech from Adlai Stevenson.
 It is my opinion and judgment that if
 the American people had elected him as
 President of the United States in 1952,
 we would not be as close to war today as
 we are. I wish to say to my Democratic
 colleagues I think they ought to stop the
 practice of sneezing every time President
 Eisenhower  coughs  about  a  foreign
 policy  matter.   The Democrats  have
 themselves to blame, in large measure,
 for the plight in which our party finds
 itself in regard to the matter of foreign
 policy, because we have had too many
 Democratic leaders who have been rub-
 ber-stamping a wrong foreign policy.
 The Democratic Party owes it to the
 American people to take the foreign
 policy issue to the people and give them
 a choice on foreign policy.
 It is my opinion that if we continue
 to follow the Republican foreign policy
 for many more years, we shall be in the
 midst of a nuclear war, out of which no
 one will be victorious, because, in my
 judgment, the evidence is abundantly
 clear that neither side can win a nu-
 clear war.
 Therefore, because this issue has been
 raised on the floor of the Senate today,
 I wish to make a few statements about
 it for the RECORD.
 AMERICAN PEOPLE UNINFORMED ON FOREIGN
 POLICY
 The United States and Russia are
 equally feared and jointly feared, and
 rightly so, in many parts of the globe, as
 the two great threats to the peace of the
 world.  I know the American people
 want peace; we, the people, are dedicated
 to peace; but the sad fact is our Govern-
 ment is following a foreign policy that
 is bound inevitably to end in a nuclear
 war, unless the American people make
 it very clear to the leadership of the
 leadership of the country that they want
 that policy changed.  How can they
 make it clear? The American people are
 uninformed on American foreign policy
 due to the fact that the Eisenhower ad-
 ministration, during the last 8 years, has
 taken the people a long way down the
 road to Government by secrecy.  Gov-
 ernment by secrecy does not end up in
 freedom.  Government by secrecy does
 not end up in the protection of the dem-
 ocratic processes.  Government by se-
 crecy frequently ends up in war.                                                                                                   And
 we are on the way.
 The time has come, in my judgment,
 when the Democratic Party should offer
 to lead the American people back to the
 Wilsonian doctrine of open covenants
 openly arrived at, and make clear to the
 American people, in the historic cam-

 aments race that cannot be reconciled
 by a single moral principle to which we
 bow our heads on Sunday.  Those prin-
 ciples of morality ought to be practiced
 the other 6 days of the week, as well as
 revered on Sunday.
 We are in danger of writing a sordid
 chapter in world history by a continua-
 tion of an immoral nuclear armaments
 race along with a nation the leadership
 of which we know to be amoral.  Is it
 not an historic commentary that the
 great, moral Nation of the United States
 is permitting itself to be drawn into an
 immoral nuclear armaments race, with-
 out paying. attention to the other part
 of the paradox in which we live?
 MILITARY SPOKESMEN ON FOREIGN POLICY
 We live in a paradox, Mr. President.
 We live in a paradox in which we have
 to keep ourselves so militarily strong
 that Russia will understand she will
 have everything to lose and nothing to
 gain by an aggressive action against the
 free world.  But, Mr. President, if that
 is the end of our goal, if that is the sum
 and substance of our procedures with re-
 gard to foreign policy, then the end re-
 sult is bound to be war.
 I listened to testimony of an expert,
 not very many weeks ago, who was talk-
 ing about what would happen in a mod-
 erate nuclear war. He made very clear
 that there is not such a thing, of course,
 as the possibility of a moderate nuclear
 war, because the probabilities are that if
 a nuclear war should start it would be a
 total war, and all the bombs would be
 dropped in a relatively short period of
 time.
 Speaking hypothetically about a mod-
 erate nuclear war, this expert said such
 a war would result, in the first 10 days,
 in the loss of 50 million lives in the
 United States and more lives in Russia
 and Europe.  Let us try to reconcile that,
 Mr. President, with moral principles. We
 simply cannot forget that history goes
 on and on.   Nations rise and fall.
 Mr. President, it happens to be our
 patriotic duty, as I see our patriotic duty,
 to do what we can to give the greatest
 guarantee of an ever-rising America for
 centuries to come, rather than to follow
 a foreign policy which, in my judgment,
 increases the risks of war month by
 month.
 We only have to sit and to listen to
 the top military brass testify, Mr. Presi-
 dent, to know how dangerous is the
 period in which we live.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 There is one thing the Democratic
 Party ought to make perfectly clear.  It
 is that if the Democrats are elected to
 power in November 1960 the military will
 stop issuing; foreign policy statements.
 The military, under a Democratic ad-
 ministration, will learn once more a les-
 son which it seems to have forgotten,
 that the job of the American military
 group is to administer a foreign policy
 determined by a civilian government and
 not in any way to interrupt it or usurp it.
 Periodically, Mr. President, we listen
 to statements by Admiral Burke as to
 what is going to happen in the Formosa
 Straits or in. the Caribbean, and we listen
 to statements by the Chairman of the
 Joint Chiefs of Staff in regard to foreign
 policy.  If  we  had  a  President  who
 thoroughly understood the meaning of a
 civilian government, Mr. President, that
 top brass would have been removed from
 control immediately after it violated its
 constitutional duty to stay out of foreign
 policy deter:rninations.
 ]BIPARTISANSHIP DEAD
 Mr. President, I point out to my Demo-
 cratic colleagues that under this admin-
 istration there has been no bipartisan
 foreign policy at any time, from the
 time the present President of the United
 States took his oath of office after his
 election in 1952 to date. Oh, there have
 been some conferences with leaders now
 and then at the White House.  I am
 afraid some of my Democratic col-
 leagues have permitted a little window
 dressing to go a long way with them.
 The honor of being briefed has taken
 the place of real consultation.
 The Democratic Party has had no
 voice in helping to determine American
 foreign policy under the Eisenhower ad-
 ministration.  There has been, in fact,
 no bipartisan foreign policy.  That is
 why I am always surprised when I pick
 up the newspapers and read statements
 by Democratic leaders rubber stamping
 a foreign policy, after-the fact, of the
 Eisenhower administration.
 Mr. President, of course, in an hour
 of crisis we can always be counted upon
 to close ranks behind any President of
 the United States, Republican or Demo-
 crat. But I am one Senator who is not
 going to close ranks behind a President
 in connection with a wrong foreign
 policy prior to our getting into a situa-
 tion where we are at war and before we
 have exhausted every possibility of cor-
 recting. a wrong  foreign policy by  a
 wrong President.  Mr. President, this
 President of the United States has been
 wrong many  times on foreign policy
 since he has been in office.
 I offer no apology to the American
 people.  I am proud to let my descen-
 dants read my record of dissent with this
 President in regard "to foreign policy
 time and time again.
 Well I remember my refusal In 1955 to
 go along with the Formosa resolution
 and the warning which the Senator from
 New York and the Senator from Oregon
 gave the Senate on that historic oc-
 casion-that  the  Formosa resolution
 would settle nothing, that the Formosa
 resolution 'would increase the danger of
 May N3
 war.  So it has, Mr. President, and that
 danger is increasing year by year.
 DEMOCRATS FAILED TO SUPPORT UNITED NATIONS
 Mr. President, I think it is well under-
 stood that within the next few years Red
 China will have nuclear weapons.  Can
 we think that the Formosa resolution,
 at that time, is going to be a contribu-
 tion to peace?  If the Democrats had
 not followed Eisenhower on the Formosa
 resolution in 1955, if, they had supported
 the Senator from New York and the
 Senator from Oregon, as we pleaded on
 the floor of the Senate, taking a position
 of seeking to get the United Nations to
 accept a trusteeship over the Formosa
 Straits, with the United States guaran-
 teeing to the United Nations that it
 would militarily defend Formosa and the
 Pescadores, we would be nearer to peace
 in the Formosa Straits than we are
 today.
 .But the  Democrats rubberstamped
 what I consider to be that wrong foreign
 policy of this administration, which was
 a foreign policy, again, outside of the
 United Nations, and which represented
 once again the record of the Eisenhower
 administration for unilateral action out-
 side the United Nations rather than
 through it.
 History will record that the Eisen-
 hower administration has bypassed the
 United Nations time and time again on
 the major issues which have threatened
 the peace of the world. ? The Middle East
 doctrine  is  another  example.  Once
 again the majority of the Democrats
 rubberstamped it.  More of them stood
 with us on that than in regard to the
 Formosa Straits, Mr. President, but even
 in that instance we heard the pleas for
 unity.  We heard the plea, "You cannot
 let the President down."  We heard the
 plea, "The President, right or wrong."
 That is dangerous doctrine, Mr. Presi-
 dent.                                                                                                  We have a duty, as Senators-at
 least, as I see my obligation, I do-to try
 to correct a wrong Presidential policy.
 I say, most respectfully, that we Demo-
 crats have done a rather poor job of
 that under this administration.  I am
 glad to see that eyes are, at long last,
 opening, and at least the Democratic
 voters of this country-and I will also
 say, many fine independent and Repub-
 lican voters of this country-are begin-
 ning to recognize that the Eisenhower
 administration foreign policy, if long
 continued, is going to lead us into war.
 That policy has to be stopped, Mr.
 President.  We have to stop it by stop-
 ping our support of the President of the
 United States every time he circumvents
 the United Nations, every time he re-
 sorts to secret diplomacy, and every time
 he keeps from the American people the
 facts about our foreign policy which en-
 danger the people.
 DEMOCRATS MUST OFFER ALTERNATIVES
 Mr. President, it is one thing to criti-
 cize the Republican foreign policy but
 it is another thing to tell the American
 people a constructive program which
 ought to take its place.  That is the
 responsibility of the Democratic Party,
 in my judgment.  We must come for-
 ward  with  a  constructive  program,
 are through with
 ead, that we
 re going to
 plomacy, that we a
 stop rubberstamping the secret diplo-
 macy of the Eisenhower administration.
 Therefore, it is time we make clear to
 the American people that, as the Demo.
 cratic Party, we are through with under-
 cutting and undermining the United Na-
 tions, and that we propose to return to
 a sound democratic policy of seeking to
 follow the doctrine of international deci-
 sions based upon law, and take our case
 to an international organization, such as
 the United Nations, with such reforms in
 the United Nations as we are sorely
 needed.
 We are, in my judgment, in an im-
 moral nuclear armaments race, an arm-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE
 rather than constantly be sneezing as
 'd' 1senhower coughs, on foreign policy,
 A  r than constantly standing up in
 tI'Congress of the United States to
 plead for unity behind the President on
 a wrong foreign policy.  We have, first,
 a duty to lay out what is wrong with the
 administration's  foreign policy;  and
 then to offer a constructive program to
 replace it.
 Mr. President, I like the way Adlai
 Stevenson talks.  I like the way Adlai
 Stevenson thinks.
 I like the programs which Adlai
 Stevenson has presented to the Ameri-
 can people for a number of years.  I
 remember the courage of Adlai Steven-
 son in 1956 in regard to nuclear testing.
 That was the act of a great man; and
 we all know the smear job that was done
 against him by the Republicans in 1956.
 They were talking then as NIXON has
 been talking in the past few days-"You
 are an appeaser if you criticize American
 foreign policy."
 Let me point out that if we do not
 start criticizing the Eisenhower admin-
 istration foreign policy, if we do not
 bring some reforms in regard to it, and,
 if the Democratic Party does not begin
 in the Congress by of-lering constructive
 suggestions to replace the Eisenhower
 foreign policy, I repeat that within a few
 years we shall be at war; and out of
 that war there will be no victory for
 the United States and the Western Pow-
 ers, or for Russia.  It will not be the
 end of civilization; it will merely be the
 l of American civilization and Rus-
 r         `i civilization.  There will be much
 civilization left, but it will be in Asia,
 Africa, and Latin America, because I
 am satisfied that a nuclear war would
 be bound to result in the simultaneous
 destruction of the civilizations in Europe,
 the United States, and Russia.  I do not
 think there, is any way of stopping it
 once the trigger is pulled on the first
 hydrogen bomb.  There would be such
 a chain reaction of the pulling of trig-
 gers that it would be merely a matter of
 days until we had only a remnant of
 Western civilization and Russian civili-
 zation.
 So I say to the Democratic Party that
 the time has come for it to come forward
 with a constructive program to meet the
 threat of war, because if we continue the
 program of the Eisenhower administra-
 tion, in my judgment our country will
 end up with war in a very few years. I
 have said before, and I say again, that
 if we get into a critical war in which ag-
 gression is committed against, us, of
 course we will stand united behind who-
 ever is the President of the United States
 for the duration of that war, if we have
 any chance at all of surviving, which I
 think is highly remote.
 Mr. President, I do not share the
 Democratic talk that we must not even
 whisper and criticize the Eisenhower pol-
 icies with regard to foreign policy.  In
 my judgment President Eisenhower and
 his administration have gotten us into
 precarious position we occupy in this
 k hour in American and world his
 tory. I think the time has come for us
 to give some heed to the statesmanship
 of a Stevenson and to the statesmanship
 that is set out in the point of view ex-
 pressed today by the Advisory Council
 of the Democratic Party. The time has
 also come when we must offer some con-
 structive suggestions as to how best to
 seek the peace through a total enforce-
 able nuclear disarmament program.
 MANY BELIEVE WE SHOULD FIGHT RUSSIA SOON
 If my major thesis is correct-and I
 am satisfied! it is-that this nuclear ar-
 mament race is immoral, that this nu-
 clear armament race will never stand the
 moral judgment of history which follows
 us, then we ought to be at work trying
 to win the peace, rather than giving aid
 and comfort to those within our country
 who are trying to sell the sinister propa-
 ganda across America, "We must fight
 Russia some time anyway; we are prob-
 ably in a better position to fight her now:
 So let us get on with fighting her."
 My heart is heavy when I reflect on
 how  widespread  that  sinister  prop-
 aganda already is.                                                        We call it the pre-
 ventive war theory, an expression which
 I have heard from the lips of the high
 brass in this country.  In 1955 I argued
 against the Formosa resolution because
 I knew the testimony before us had dis-
 closed that we were considering a pre-
 ventative war resolution.  I again raise
 my voice in opposition to preventative
 war propaganda in the United States.
 If we continue to follow the policy of
 the Eisenhower administration we shall
 end with a preventative war, but I do not
 think it is too late to win the peace.  It
 will call for some courage.  It will call
 for the raising of horizons. It will call
 for the return to and the putting into
 practice of a great American ideal.
 I know that when I raise my voice
 lustily and make a plea for implement-
 ing a system of international justice
 through law my critics are heard to say,
 "That is what happens when you put
 a professor in politics.  He goes idealis-
 tic on you.  He goes theoretical on you.
 He becomes impractical."
 I have many answers to the criticism,
 but I will give only one at this moment
 in the form of a rhetorical question: I
 would have these critics tell the Ameri-
 can people what is practical about a
 nuclear war.,  What is practical about a
 nuclear war'? I can think of no greater
 impracticality.
 Even when the war would be over such
 civilization as would survive for cen-
 turies would live in chaos, because if we
 stop to reflect for a moment on the
 chaotic conditions of this globe following
 a nuclear war, the sad thing is that all
 the problems which confronted us be-
 fore the war would have to be solved by
 the world that remained after the war.
 The war would solve nothing.
 We are told that it would get Russia
 out of the way. I am satisfied it would
 get Russia out of the way-and the
 United States, too; and I do not wish to
 see the United States put out of the way.
 I think we have the system of govern-
 ment, and a system of ideals which come
 nearest to making it practically possi-
 ble to implement the great spiritual be-
 liefs and teachings to which we are all
 dedicated as religious men and women
 in this country.  What concerns me so
 much is that the course of action which
 10033
 we are following cannot be reconciled
 with those spiritual principles.
 CONSTRUCTIVE ALTERNATIVES NEEDED
 So once again I plead this afternoon
 for an effort to implement a system of
 international justice through law; and
 I make these suggestions, which I hope
 will be considered constructive.
 First let me say, before I submit such
 a list, that no one can hold any brief
 for the course of action the United States
 took in regard to the spy plane, and no
 one can hold any brief for the course of
 action that Khrushchev took, either.
 I am a member of the Foreign Rela-
 tions Committee of the Senate; and as
 a member of that committee       ._the
 izatt?alled
 inter                , is    a j orite
 npy work. Everyone else ought
 to know, and I presume does know, that,
 of course, we spend great sums of money
 for espionage, and so does every other
 powerful nation.  Of course, we have
 spies in many parts of the world and we
 know that other countries do, too, in-
 cluding some of our friends in our own
 country.
 We certainly have no doubt about the
 fact that Russia had spies.  But I was
 highly amused to hear the alibi given
 by the Vice President of the United
 States, Mr. Nrxorr, in talking about the
 spy plane incident. He sought to attract
 attention to the fact that there had been
 a couple Russian spies  detected in
 Massachusetts some months ago.
 That is no surprise to anybody.  But
 if I have ever listened to a non sequitur
 argument, that is one, and I am accus-
 tomed to hear such arguments from the
 Vice President of the United States.
 What does the detection of intelligence
 personnel have to do with a course of
 action followed by the United States in
 regard to what is interpreted around the
 world as a form of constructive aggres-
 sion? That is exactly what the sending
 of the spy plane over Russia was. It was
 a form of constructive aggression.  We
 can alibi it and rationalize it all we want
 to, and we can wave the American flag
 into tatters over it, but the fact remains
 that our friends  and  enemies alike
 around the world are going to decree that
 we cannot justify our course of action
 in the spy plane incident under inter-
 national comity well recognized in the
 field of espionage.
 At no time, as I sat in the Committee
 on Foreign Relations or on the floor, and
 as I voted for the use of funds for intel-
 ligence wrok, was there even a whisper
 from anyone within the administration,
 military or civilian, that any of that
 money would be used for the sending of
 an instrumentality of war over a foreign
 sovereign power.
 I am satisfied that if any such sug-
 gestion had been made, the result with
 respect to the request for authorization
 would have been a great deal different,
 both in committee and on the floor of
 the Senate.  The administration  did
 great damage to the standing and pres-
 tige of the United States by following a
 policy which has shocked our friends
 around the world in sending an instru-

 Approved For Release 2004/05/13 : CIA-RDP90T00782R000100050001-8
 mentality of war In the form of a spy
 plane over Russia.
 Let us not forget, in these days of high
 hysteria, bordering almost on panic, in
 the thinking of many people, one never
 knows when such an incident will cause
 some misguided, uninformed, emotional-
 ly aroused person in some foreign coun-
 try to make a false deduction as to the
 purpose of such a plane, and a nuclear
 war will be started thereby.
 It was a risk that the administration
 had no moral right to ever run.  They
 ran it. The plane was shot down. I do
 not know what the facts are. We hope
 to get the facts after a thorough investi-
 gation. I do not know yet how the plane
 was shot down.
 I am not convinced by any statement
 coming out of this administration that
 it was not shot down by a land-to-air
 missile. There are reasons to doubt the
 statement.  I am satisfied that this ad-
 ministration would like to save face, if
 it can, with regard to this unfortunate
 and stupid mistake it made. I do know
 that one of the pleas made to us for a
 long time in the Senate for crash pro-
 grams in connection with the develop-
 ment of land-to-air missiles was that,
 we were told-and I violate no secrecy
 by saying this, because this has appeared
 in periodicals and press reports through-
 out the country-that the Russians were
 ahead of us in land-to-air missiles.
 The result was that huge sums of
 money were appropriated for Bomarc-
 over $3 billion.  On the basis of the
 latest findings, the record of Bomarc is
 not so good. Of course we know, when
 ,not
 appropriate huge sums of money for
 these programs, that some of them are
 not going to be the success we hoped
 they would be, and that some of them
 are going to be failures. I am not greatly
 concerned about the fact that we appro-
 priated that money.  The program ap-
 parently resulted in failure.  I would
 vote to do it again.  I will do it tomor-
 row if the administration can come for-
 ward with a program that shows an
 appropriation may help us speed up a
 crash program on land-to-air missiles.
 I say that because I have voted in the
 past and will continue to vote in the
 future for those appropriations which
 are necessary to let the Russians at all
 times know that they have everything
 to lose and nothing to gain by an ag-
 gressive course of action against. the
 free world.
 WEAPONS ARE NOT ENOUGH
 What I am trying to bring before my
 country is that merely an arms race will
 not win the peace.  An armaments race
 will not do that but, in my judgment,
 will surely assure a nuclear war in our
 time.  That we cannot justify, unless
 we know that we have done everything
 that possibly can be done by moral peo-
 ple to try to set up a system of interna-
 tional justice through law which can
 enforce a total disarmament program.
 Khrushchev shot the plane down.
 One would expect it from an amoral peo-
 ple.  International comity and recog-
 nized principles of international morality
 dictated that he not follow that course of
 action.  He has one of the best jet fight-
 er armadas in the world.  There are
 some people who think that they are bet-
 ter than our own.  I am .not expert
 enough to testify on that.
 However, I raise the. point that it Is
 good enough so that there is great con-
 cern on the part of our experts as to the
 comparison between our jet fighter ar-
 mada and Russia's.  All he needed to do
 was to send three or four of his jet
 fighters to that plane and surround it
 and give it orders to ground itself.  If
 it violated that request, then and only
 then, in my judgment, under the rules
 of international law, in such a situation,
 would he-have been justified in shooting)
 it down.
 He did not follow that course.  I have
 a hunch that he.saw a great opportunity.
 He knew as well as we did that Bomare
 has been no great success, and he seized
 the opportunity to make a demonstra-
 tion to the world in regard to land-to-air
 missiles.  I think that is a great prob-
 ability.                                                                  Be that as it may, he did get a
 great propaganda advantage over us.
 Then, having followed that course of ac-
 tion, he went to the summit undoubtedly
 with a determination to humiliate not
 only the President of the United States,
 not only the Presidency of the United
 States, but also the American people.
 He wanted to bring into disrepute the
 President as a man, the position, and the
 American people.
 PRESIDENT DID WELL AT PARIS
 Although I have been highly critical
 of President Eisenhower's foreign policy
 on many issues, I wish to say that the
 President went as far in the Paris con-
 ference as he could go with honor. He
 deserves credit for announcing at the
 very beginning that it was the plan of
 this Government to suspend any further
 use of spy planes.  That should have
 been said, and that is all that the Presi-
 dent needed to say, if Khrushchev really
 wanted to have the summit conference
 be a vehicle and a forum for negotiation
 and agreement on peace.
 Obviously, he did not want that.
 Therefore, I wish to say that in my
 judgment the President of the United
 States conducted himself at the Paris
 conference within the proprieties, and
 Khrushchev did not.
 I listened to Khrushchev's press inter-
 view.                                                       I could close my eyes at times
 during that interview and almost come
 to the conclusion that I was listening to
 Hitler, because there were sections of
 the interview which had many of the
 characteristics and overtones and under-
 tones of the type of totalitarian propa-
 ganda that Hitler preached at his height.
 Be that as it may, Khrushchev is a
 reality. Be that as it may, Khrushchev
 is at the head of a government that
 obviously is our potential enemy. There-
 fore, I believe that, with honor and
 within procedures that will protect the
 security of our country, we must proceed
 now to find out what we can do and to
 answer the question, "Where do we go
 from :here?"
 I ara not one to cry over spilled milk.
 It is better to survey the facts that get
 us into a position in which we find our-
 selves at any given time.
 But after I have surveyed that posi-
 tion, then I always ask myself the ques-
 May 23
 tion: Where do we go from here?  The,
 Russians apparently thought that t1w, y
 having this matter referred to thi`e-
 .curity Council. I think we all know that
 the Security Council cannot solve it,
 and undoubtedly will not solve it.
 There is not much hope that the Secu-
 rity Council can solve the great problem
 which confronts us, the problem of win-
 ning the peace, by bringing about a sure-
 proof, enforceable, total disarmament
 program in our time. I am not an "over-
 nighter." I recognize that such a peace
 will not be won overnight.  It will not
 be won in 2, 3, or 5 years.
 In fact, to secure such a peace prob-
 ably will consume many years.  How-
 ever, I want to stress that we ought to
 be taking forward steps toward winning
 the peace, rather than marching in re-
 verse, as we are at present. I am satis-
 fied we are marching toward war not
 toward peace. So I wish to make a few
 suggestions this afternoon which I think
 we ought to try to implement in the
 years immediately ahead.
 If we do the negotiating within the
 framework that I suggest this afternoon;
 if we have the nations of the world nego-
 tiating for peace; then, interestingly
 enough, we will have a form of mora-
 torium on war at the same time, because
 if the nations of the world are negotiat-
 ing for peace, the probability will be in-
 creased that they will not proceed to
 fight one another in a war.
 ROLE OF RED CHINA NEEDS TO BE UNDERSTOOD
 So there are a few reforms whir-
 think we ought to stand for in the ?
 of foreign policy as it affects all nations.
 Let me stress the word "all" for a mo-
 ment, because no longer can we divide the
 world into those nations with whom we
 will converse, and those nations against
 whom we will drop an American iron
 curtain.
 Of course, I refer specifically to Red
 China.  No one in this body hates the
 form of government of Red China more
 than does the senior Senator from Ore-
 gon.                                                                                                       Nevertheless, we are following a
 blind, myopic policy with respect to Red
 China, because I am satisfied that Red
 China will be a nuclear power within 10
 years.  We cannot possibly start nego-
 tiating for peace leading toward a total
 disarmament program, and not include
 Red China.
 This does not mean that the senior
 Senator from Oregon advocates the im-
 mediate recognition of Red China. I do
 not; although I point out to the Ameri-
 can people that Red China has never
 asked to be recognized. Red China has
 never made a request for diplomatic
 recognition on the part of the United
 States.
 However, I hope the time will come
 when we can recognize Red China with
 honor to ourselves. We cannot do that
 now. We cannot do it until we get some
 very definite proof that we can rely on
 the commitments of Red China which
 will show that we can count upon Re
 China to keep her international cc  -,?
 mitments.
 There  are two such commitments
 which we have the right and also the

 mu
 ch in the same way that the great
 common law was built up.  The com-
 mon law is a body of judicial precedents;
 and we should now be engaged in the
 process of building up a body of prece-
 dential law for international-law tribu-
 nals to apply to disputes which threaten
 the peace of the world, as they arise
 from year to year.
 But more than that must be done.
 We also must expand international law
 by "a statutory process or procedure."
 I suggest that we can do so by calling a
 series of extraordinary sessions of the
 General Assembly of the United Nations
 from time to time, with the agenda
 limited to specific questions for debate
 and negotiation, the purpose being to
 arrive at the adoption of resolutions,
 with the understanding that they will
 have the force and effect of interna-
 tional law until they are repealed.  Is
 that idealistic? Yes, it is. Is it theoreti-
 cal?  Yes, it is.  Is it practical?  It is
 highly practical, because, as I have said
 before, the only thing that is practical
 happens to be to put to work an ideal
 in the field of foreign policy and also
 in the field of governmental domestic
 policy.
 But the sad thing is that the Eisen-
 hower record on this matter is practically
 nil; and the sad thing is that too many
 Democrats have rubber stamped the
 Eisenhower position on that issue.
 it is time for the Democratic Party
 either to fish or to cut bait on the mat-
 ter of foreign policy, and in the months
 ahead to come forward with a construc-
 tive foreign program which will lead to
 peace, instead of the Republican pro-
 gram which rapidly is taking us down
 the road toward war.
 A series of such conferences over 'the
 years-and let it be remembered that
 earlier in this speech I pointed out that
 I am discussing a program which, in my
 judgment, may take as long as 20 years
 but, nevertheless, we should get on with
 the work, and should have conferences
 of the sort I have suggested-through
 special sessions of the General Assembly,
 will, in my judgment, promote the cause
 of peace and strengthen the chances for
 peace, and will bring us closer to a total
 nuclear disarmament program, without
 which, in my judgment, in our time we
 shall wind up with a nuclear war.
 PEACE OFFENSIVE NEEDED
 But for the immediate future-and I
 close with this suggestion-I believe we
 have a right to look to our allies around
 the world to rise to their obligations at
 this hour.  I believe the heads of great
 governments, such as those of Great
 Britain, Canada, France, Italy, and In-
 dia, those of all the free nations of the
 world-ought right now be joining in
 focusing attention on the need for the
 adoption of a system of international
 justice through law for the settlement
 of these disputes, leading to a total dis-
 armament program.
 If ever there was a time when the
 United States needed the moral support
 and backing of her allies, that time is
 now; and I am speaking of the need to
 take to Khrushchev a peace offensive
 within and through the United Nations.
 036
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 But we are not doing so, because time
 and time again we have demonstrated
 that we are not willing to submt specific
 questions to the processes of the United
 Nations for final determination.  So I
 make the plea that our allies join in ask-
 ing for an extraordinary session of the
 United Nations in the immediate future,
 because, in my judgment, it has got to be
 done through the General Assembly, not
 through the Security Council.  In the
 first place the Security Council cannot
 speak for all the nations in the world,
 and only a few nations are on the Securi-
 ty Council. But every nation, large and
 small, has a stake in peace. Every na-
 tion, large and small, has a stake in what
 the United States, Great Britain, France,
 and Russia do.
 SUMMIT MEETING SHOULD NOT BE HELD
 AT U.N.
 That is why I have been heard to say
 before, as I protested the kind of sum-
 mit conference that was called in Paris,
 that, in my judgment, we should not
 proceed in that kind of summit confer-
 ence. I think it was a mistake from the
 beginning.
 Any summit conference in which we
 participate, as I have said for a long, long
 time, should be conducted under the ju-
 risdiction of the United Nations, with the
 Secretary General of the United Nations
 sitting as permanent chairman of that
 conference, and with any arrangements
 or agreements reached in that summit
 conference going to the United Nations
 for approval.
 Why?  Because if that is not done, in
 my judgment we shall return to inter-
 natioi al power politics.  International
 power politics will not produce peace. It
 never has.  The use of international
 power politics, throughout the history of
 mankind, has produced only intervals be-
 tween wars, because always the nonpar-
 ticipants resent the fact that a few
 powerful nations decide the fate of the
 rest of the world.
 I make it a point of getting myself
 briefed  on  broadcasts  coming  from
 southeast Asia, Latin America, and Afri-
 ca.                                                     I say to Members of the Senate they
 had better get themselves briefed on
 what is coming out of southeast Asia,
 Africa, and Latin America these days.
 Those radio broadcasts indicated to me
 that loud dissents were already begin-
 ning to arise among the nonparticipants
 at the summit conference, and questions
 were being asked.
 One can call it any kind of propaganda
 he desires; nevertheless, it is a reality.
 One cannot deny that it is being beaten
 into the eardrums of millions and mil-
 lions of people in that part of the world,
 people who in numbers greatly exceed
 our population, and people who have to
 be won over to freedom if freedom is to
 survive.  In my opinion, freedom will not
 survive if it is limited to the United
 States and the Western nations.  It will
 survive in the decades ahead only if we
 win over to freedom the people in those
 parts of the world to which I have re-
 ferred.
 Mr. President, we will not sell inter-
 national politics to them.  They want
 none of it.  Why should they?  Would
 we?
 May 23
 I heard it said earlier this afternoon
 by the Senator from Pennsylvania or the
 Senator from Oklahoma-I think it was
 the Senator from Pennsylvania-when
 he quoted extensively from the Steven-
 son Chicago speech, from which I quoted
 a few minutes ago, what the reaction
 would be in our country in case a Rus-
 sian spy plane was over our country.
 We know what the reaction would be.
 Can we not hear the clamor?  There
 would be those who would want to break
 off diplomatic relations immediately.
 There would even be those who would
 want us to go to war.
 In regard to the matter of interna-
 tional power politics, therb are millions
 of people who want none of it; but they
 can be brought along, and they will co-
 operate if we give them a voice. That is
 why I made the suggestion, in which I
 hope our friends around the world will
 join us, and I hope our country will ex-
 ercise leadership in proposing, that we
 start, in the immediate future, in the
 United Nations building in New York
 City, a series of conferences open to the
 world, to which will be invited the head
 of every state in the world, large and
 small, for the purpose of laying down
 the blueprint for peace, of telling the
 world the concessions he is willing to
 make in behalf of his country, for the
 cause of setting up a system of interna-
 tional justice under law, with the im-
 mediate goal of total disarmament, to
 be enforced by a police system agreed
 upon by the United Nations to enforce
 such a disarmament program.
 I know there are those who will say,
 "Too idealistic. Too theoretical and im-
 practical." But again I ask the question,
 What is practical about a nuclear war?
 Mr. CLARK.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. MORSE. In just a second.
 I think the world is up against it, and
 I think the world has no choice but
 either to go to war in our generation or
 to give the world a system of permanent
 peace, which can be attained only by
 bringing to an end this immoral nu-
 clear armaments race.
 I yield for a moment to the Senator
 from Pennsylvania.
 Mr. CLARK.  I wish to commend the
 Senator from Oregon for the fine speech
 he is making in support of a peaceful
 solution of the world's difficulties.  I
 thank him for joining me and the Sen-
 ator from Oklahoma and a number of
 other Senators earlier today, who made
 the specific point that our job is to
 continue that search for peace, regard-
 less of the calamities and blunders which
 resulted in the breakup of the summit
 conference.  While it is important to es-
 tablish what went wrong in the summit
 conference, and who made the mistakes,
 and why, the more important matter is
 not to be turned aside from the one
 great goal of this generation, which is
 peace, and cessation of nuclear testing,
 and surrender of nuclear weapons, and
 international agreement to bring about
 world ? peace through world law.
 Our zeal in that cause should not be
 abated one iota by reason of anything
 that has happened in the world in the
 last 6 weeks.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 duty, it seems to me, to ask of her, in
 order to demonstrate to the world that
 the United States stands upon its prin-
 ciples of recognition. One of those cri-
 teria is the criterion that a nation must
 demonstrate to us or satisfy us that we
 can count upon it to keep its interna-
 tional commitments.
 So I refer to the allegations which we
 have made, over and over again, and
 which I think were merited, that Red
 China has violated the Korean truce time
 and time again.  The second allegation
 is that Red China has not followed the
 recognized procedure of civilized nations
 in respect to the treatment of our cap-
 tured nationals. We must ascertain the
 facts.
 Therefore, I suggest that as a condi-
 tion precedent to any proposal that the
 United States recognize Red China diplo-
 matically, the United States, through
 the United Nations, ought to ask Red
 China to permit a survey or an investi-
 gation to be made by an appropriate
 team of the United Nations concerning
 the extent, if any, to which Red China
 has kept to her international commit-
 ments in respect to the Korean truce,
 and in respect to her treatment of Ameri-
 can nationals whom she has allegedly
 tried in her courts and sentenced to
 various types of punishment in Red
 China.
 Does anyone think for a moment that
 the United States would object to a simi-
 lar survey to be made by the United
 Nations in the United States, in case any
 sovereign power alleged that we were
 violating the well established principles
 of civilized nations in the matter of han-
 dling prisoners, or in the living up to our
 treaty or truce obligations?  Of course
 we would not?
 The point I am making is something
 different from that of diplomatic rec-
 ognition.. I am simply asking for rec-
 ognition of the fact that if an attempt
 is made to work out a disarmament pro-
 gram, a part of the world cannot be left
 out of that distrmament program.  It
 does not follow that because we recog-
 nize the right of Red China to a voice
 in negotiations with respect to world-
 wide disarmament, we are, in effect,
 thereby diplomatically recognizing her.
 V.N. VETO POWER SHOULD BE ELIMINATED
 So if we expect to establish a system
 of international justice through law,
 which will promote and attain total nu-
 clear disarmament, then we must look
 to the existing procedures available to
 us. When we do that, we see that many
 of those procedures will have to be
 changed.  We ought to be exercising
 leadership in making proposals for a
 change in the international rules which
 already exist in those organizations of
 which we are already members.
 Thus I refer to the veto power of the
 United Nations.  Certainly, that power
 must be eliminated.  We know the his-
 tory of the veto power. There are those
 who have written authoritatively and
 spoken authoritatively of the San Fran-
 cisco Conference and have pointed out
 that when the American delegation at
 that Conference split over the veto
 issue, then the veto became a certainty,
 because the Russians were insistent upon
 the veto power.
 Many persons at the San Francisco
 Conference were against the veto power.
 But when the American ranks broke
 over the issue, then there was no ques-
 tion, from that time on, that the veto
 power would go into the charter, and it
 did.  It finally became a part of the
 charter, as the record shows, and with
 the vote of the American delegation, too.
 That was a great mistake.
 There were only a few of us on the
 floor of the Senate at the time the San
 Francisco charter came before this body
 for ratification, and who spoke against
 the veto power in the charter.  It was
 obvious at that time that that particular
 section of the charter was bound to rise
 to plague us, and it has risen to plague
 us many, many times.
 It will not be possible to have the veto
 power removed immediately, but I be-
 lieve it can be removed. As we marshal
 the leaders of the world behind a request
 for a modification of the veto power, in
 due course of time the Russian leaders
 themselves will come to recognize that
 they will have to assume the-responsi-
 bility for losing the peace, if they are
 unwilling to make a concession in a mat-
 ter which makes so much commonsense
 as the elimination of the veto power.
 I do not know how many years it will
 take, but I believe that the very discus-
 sion of it, that the making of it the sub-
 ject of one or more special sessions of
 the General Assembly of the United Na-
 tions for world debate, discussion, and
 resolution, if possible, will have an effect
 on the exercise of the veto during the
 period of time the discussion is taking
 place.
 The discussion of these problems, in
 and of itself, will further the cause of
 peace -in the international councils of
 the world as they are carried on through
 the procedures of the United Nations.
 V.N. MUST BE CORNERSTONE Or U.S. POLICY
 Third, I suggest that the time has long
 passed-is   long  overdue-when  the
 United States also will serve notice on
 the world that we are going to stop our
 end runs around the United Nations;
 that we are going to stop circumventing
 the United Nations, that we are perfectly
 willing to lay our cases on their merits
 before the procedures of the United Na-
 tions, before the tribunals of the United
 Nations, before the General Assembly of
 the United Nations, for open world sur-
 veillance.
 Therefore, Mr. President, I think pub-
 lic opinion in this country should give
 heed to the need of the United States to
 notify the world that we are going to
 help strengthen the United Nations, in-
 stead of continue to weaken in.
 INTERNATIONAL LAW MUST BE STRENGTHENED
 Fourth, I wish to point out that there
 is no existing body of international law
 sufficient in depth to be applied to all
 the international issues which arise to
 endanger the peace. International law,
 as it now exists, is, after all, very limited
 in scope. Therefore, if we are to set up
 a system of :international justice through
 law, we must expand the existing body
 of international law, so that as each
 threat to the peace arises, as each dis-
 pute between and among nations occur,
 there will be a set of principles which
 can be applied for the adjudication of
 those disputes, thus eliminating the kind
 of policy the United States has been
 following, namely, one of threatening
 massive retaliation, of proposing to keep
 25 percent of our bombers in the air at
 all times, loaded with nuclear bombs.
 What a shocking bit of news that was
 when it went around the world.  How
 shocking it was to make such a state-
 ment, and then profess that we are seek-
 ing peace, when people in other parts of
 the world know that the nuclear weapons
 on any one of those bombers could go off
 by accident or by design or by disobe-
 dience of orders, and could start a holo-
 caust.  We have to start to square our
 actions with our talk for peace; and such
 a proposal as that is not a proposal of
 peace, but threatens war.  Instead, we
 must have something to supplant the
 American policy of military threats.
 The sad thing is that around the world
 we  have  the  reputation-and  with
 cause-of being threateners, just as
 Khrushchev has the reputation of rat-
 tling the saber.  One of the sorriest
 things in the history of this administra-
 tion was the proposal for mass retalia-
 tion; and the sad thing is that the Demo-
 crats as a body did not oppose it. Too
 many Democrats went along with that
 proposal, and, in my judgment, aided
 and abetted the Eisenhower administra-
 tion in following the wrong policy for
 some 8 years.
 If we are to expand international law,
 so there will be a body of law to which
 we can turn before international tribu-
 nals, if rule and reason are to be ap-
 plied to international disputes, we must
 be willing to submit disputes which are
 subject to adjudication under existing
 international law to the tribunals of the
 United Nations which are provided for
 the handling of such cases. But we do
 not do so in regard to any matter of con-
 sequence.  We may do so in regard to
 some little fishing dispute or some minor
 dispute in regard to a vessel or in regard
 to a question about harbor damages.
 But when there is a major issue, such
 as that over- the Formosa Straits or
 that in regard to the Middle East or a
 good many issues which have arisen in
 connection with our mutual security pro-
 gram, we simply lean back and proclaim
 our sovereign rights, wave the flag, and
 say we are going to decide this for our-
 selves.  But whenever we do that, we
 lose more and more prestige around the
 world.
 So I suggest that we begin to apply
 the judicial articles of the United Na-
 tions Charter, and that we carry a peace
 offensive against Russia whenever we
 have a chance to do so, by calling upon
 Russia to join us in submitting disputes
 not only to the World Court, but, under
 the articles of the United Nations, also
 to other tribunals which can be set up
 by agreement under the judicial article
 of the United Nations Charter, for the
 settlement of such disputes.  -
 That will start expanding Interna-
 tional law with a body of precedents,

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 I ask the Senator from Oregon if
 that is not the great task which lies be-
 fore America as the leader of the free
 world, and whether we do not have to
 create in the Senate a climate in which
 that task can be pursued assiduously,
 and in which those who do pursue it get
 the plaudits of this body, and not one
 in which there is a feeling that they are
 doing something unpatriotic or being
 soft on communism.
 Mr n ).USE.  I could not agree more
 wit" ` h~the Senator from Pennsylvania.
 That is the burden of my whole speech
 this afternoon.
 NATIONS  SHOULD PUT  BLUEPRINT  FOR  PEACE
 BEFORE U.N.
 This is not the first time the Senator
 from Pennsylvania and the senior Sen-
 ator from Oregon have stood shoulder to
 shoulder on the floor of the Senate in
 the interest of permanent peace.  But
 I want to stress the fact that we have got
 to come forward with what I consider to
 be constructive, practical proposals for
 establishing that procedure. I have made
 specific references to those goals. The
 one point I was on-and I reiterate it-
 when I gladly yielded to the Senator
 from Pennsylvania, who has been so
 helpful on this speech, was that we
 should invite, and others must join us,
 the heads of all States, large and small,
 to participate in an extraordinary ses-
 sion of the United Nations, which has
 nothing to do with membership in the
 United Nations at all.  I would like the
 head of every nation, large and small,
 whether that nation is a member of the
 United Nations or not, to have an op-
 portunity to take a world platform in
 the United Nations Building in New York
 City and lay down his nation's blueprint
 for peace, and the concessions that na-
 tion is willing to make in order to estab-
 lish what the Senator from Pennsyl-
 vania, I, and others in the Senate have
 been urging for many, many years in the
 Senate, namely, the establishment of a
 system of international justice through
 law for the purpose of enforcing peace.
 Mr. President, that is going to take
 weeks and perhaps months. I am all in
 favor of taking as much time as we need,
 because, I repeat, if we have the heads
 of state around the world' devoting
 themselves to the consideration of pro-
 grams for peace, in my judgment, we
 shall have an unwritten moratorium on
 war. These nations are not going to be
 fighting each other so long as they are
 seeking to work out a peace program.  I
 think we need that time, Mr. President.
 I happen   to think  a tremendous
 amount of good can come from such a
 program as I am outlining, because I am
 satisfied there is not a spot on the world
 today  in  which  the  people  are  not
 greatly concerned about the danger of
 a nuclear war. The hearts of mankind,
 generally  speaking-including,   I  am
 satisfied, the overwhelming majority of
 the rank and file people of the Soviet
 Union of Russia-want peace.
 We know we are dealing with some ir-
 responsible leaders in various parts of
 the world, but they happen to be a
 reality.  We must stop, it seems to me,
 trying to escape from reality in this field
 of working for peace. We have to recog-
 nize that at least those leaders whom we  high for us to climb, the great heights
 consider to be irresponsible have to be which I believe God intended for us.
 drawn out into the open. We have to But God also intended that we do our
 carry to them and to the world, through share, and that share calls at this his-

 amount of progress which could be made    Mr. CARROLL.  Mr. President, will
 in  developing  a  program  for  peace. the Senator yield?
 People would have to come and go at       Mr. MORSE.  I yield to the Senator
 pect would be to have the head of state
 come to lay out his program. If a head
 of state did not want to come in person
 but wanted to send a foreign minister to
 speak on his behalf, that should be his
 right. I think most heads of state, how-
 ever, would come themselves.
 After the heads of state had laid out
 their programs, Mr. President, it would
 be necessary for them to go back to at-
 tend to administrative and executive
 duties at the heads of their governments.
 After the heads of state program had
 been laid out before the world I think
 the next step should be negotiations and
 diplomatic exchanges among the foreign
 ministers.
 It is at that point, Mr. President, I
 think months could be spent, and very
 profitable negotiations could be had,
 again under the auspices of the United
 Nations, in trying to see what agree-
 ments and understandings the foreign
 ministers could reach.
 Third, Mr. President, I propose, after
 the foreign ministers have done the best
 they can. in regard to trying to reach an
 agreement upon the program for the
 various phases of this very important
 problem of peace, to which I have alluded
 this afternoon, that the recommenda-
 tions and proposals go back once more
 to the General Assembly of the United
 Nations for the purpose of a determina-
 tion of 'what agreements can be made
 within the United Nations, among the
 members thereof, at least with respect
 to a disarmament program.
 Mr. President, highly theoretical as it
 may be dubbed, I happen to think this
 has a terrific amount of common sense,
 because if the leaders of the world
 really want peace the road I offer them
 is the road they should travel, toward
 the citadel and the cathedral of world
 peace, rather that the road which I
 think they may travel if we do not take
 spiritual leadership in the world, before
 it is too late-the road toward nuclear
 war. I do not think we have much time
 left.  We have only our generation, at
 the most.
 Franklin Roosevelt never spoke  a
 greater truth than the truth he spoke in
 the depths of the depression, when he
 uttered the words which are more ap-
 plicable today than they were in the
 depths of the depression, that our gen-
 eration has a rendezvous with destiny.
 I think our generation, Mr. President,
 has a rendezvous with a great decision,
 from Colorado.
 Mr.  CARROLL.   Mr. President,  I
 heard quite by accident a statement by
 the distinguished senior Senator from
 Oregon on television during the Oregon
 primary campaign, which I assume orig-
 inated from Oregon. This was long be-
 fore the collapse of the summit.  I
 thought the distinguished senior Senator
 from Oregon in 2 minutes made more
 sense than any other statement I had
 heard on television.  At that time the
 Senator spoke of the necessity for mov-
 ing into the United Nations with this
 terribly important problem.
 Would not the Senator from Oregon
 agree that after some 31/2 years of try-
 ing to ease the tensions in the world, of
 trying to eliminate fear and suspicion,
 we are in a worse situation than we were
 in 3 years ago?
 Mr. MORSE. There is no doubt about
 it.  That is part of the burden of my
 speech this afternoon.
 Mr. CARROLL. Would not the Sen-
 ator from Oregon agree with the junior
 Senator from Colorado that we went in-
 to the so-called summit conference un-
 der the most adverse conditions?  We
 had to have as our bargaining agent Mr.
 Macmillan of Great Britain or President
 de Gaulle of France. We were not there
 on equal terms.  How much better would
 it have been if we had gone to the United
 Nations.  Would not the Senator agree
 with that?
 Mr. MORSE. I do not know what the
 record will show, but, as the Senator
 knows, I think the record will show that
 probably as many as four to six times,
 at the very beginning of the talk about
 having a summit conference 2 or 3 years
 ago, the Senator from Oregon spoke on
 the floor of the Senate against a sum-
 mit conference held outside the United
 Nations.
 From the very beginning, I have urged
 that all summit conferences be held un-
 der the United Nations, with the Secre-
 tary  General  serving  as  permanent
 chairman of the conference and with
 the understanding that the deliberations
 of such a conference and any proposed
 agreements reached would come to the
 General Assembly of the United Nations
 for approval.
 I have said that for some years now
 because I think the United States is re-
 peating a great mistake of history. We
 are participating in international power
 politics, in the kind of summit confer-
 ence which was proposed. I think those
 are always bound to end in historic fail-

 medium we can again remove some of
 the fear and suspicion. If we do not do
 so history will record that if this great
 Nation and the other leaders of the
 world among our allies do not get to-
 gether to settle this question, there will
 not be much history left.
 Mr. MORSE.  Those who write will
 not be American historians.  Perhaps
 some in Asia may write the history.
 Mr. CARROLL.  The Senator is ex-
 actly correct.
 If the Senator will yield for one fur-
 ther observation, I have just had placed
 before me a news ticker dispatch which
 comes from Denver.  This is a UPI dis-
 patch.
 DENVER.-The Denver Post said editorially
 today that Adlai Stevenson had a perfect
 right to criticize the administration's inept-
 ness before the summit meeting and that
 "it  is  a  proper  subject  for the political
 campaign."
 The Post, which has supported the Repub-
 lican candidate in the past two presidential
 elections, also said that former Democratic
 National    Chairman  James Farley  "should
 know better about the proper role of the
 opposition in a democracy."
 After Stevenson had criticized the admin-
 istration's                                                                                                                                         presummit  activities  Farley in
 turn  criticized  Stevenson for making the
 matter a political issue.
 Stevenson  had  said   the  administration
 gave Khrushchev a crowbar with which to
 wreck the summit meeting through the U-2
 plane incident.
 The Post said in an editorial headed "Come
 Off It, Mr. Farley," that Stevenson "neither
 implied that the administration deliberately
 helped wreck the summit, nor did he hint
 that Americans were anything but united
 behind  the President in his humilitating
 trials."
 "But Stevenson did say that GOP tactics
 were very inept before the summit, which is
 true, and he did say that this is a proper

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 but I am pleased to tell my colleagues in
 the Senate that once again it. puts its
 finger right on the issue. The issue is
 not an attack upon President Eisen-
 hower.  The issue is not an attack upon
 the President of the United States.  The
 issue is crystal clear.  The issue is
 whether the American people are en-
 titled to know who is running their Gov-
 ernment.   If the President Is running
 the Government, then who has sabo-
 taged the cause of peace?  We are not
 concerned especially with Khrushchev.
 We will take care of Khrushchev in our
 own time, but I agree with the Senator
 from Oregon that we ought to take care
 of Khrushchev and all his cronies in the
 forum of the United Nations and let the
 people of the world participate.
 We do not have to give up our sov-
 ereignty.  We have only one short op-
 portunity left.  The main point is that I
 am in support of the able Senator from
 Oregon. As I say, we have only one
 short opportunity left before some fool
 launches us into atomic war.  I thank
 the Senator for yielding to me.
 Mr. MORSE.  I thank the Senator
 from Colorado very much for his wonder-
 ful contribution to my discussion on the
 floor of the Senate this afternoon.
 I agree with almost everything he said.
 I certainly agree with his thesis.  I am
 not at all surprised to find that there is
 opposition to Stevenson by the Republi-
 cans and the Farleys.  We have opposi-
 tion to Stevenson within our own patty,
 as well as opposition by the Republicans.
 There are those who are very anxious
 to see that he be not nominated at the
 Democratic convention. They recognize
 that, if nominated, unquestionably he
 will come out the victor. They have the
 right to oppose any nominee they wish
 to oppose.  I am not at all surprised by
 Mr. Farley's criticism of Mr. Stevenson,
 because I am well satisfied as to where
 he stands in the fight within our party so
 far as the Democratic nomination is con-
 cerned.
 The second thing I wish to say is that
 I reserve only one dissent from the obser-
 vations the Senator from Colorado has
 made, and that was with respect to the
 course of action we followed with rela-
 tion to the Middle East doctrine.  In my
 judgment we did not make use of the
 United Nations procedure, as we should
 have.  I made pleas at the time that we
 ought to take to the United Nations cer-
 tain proposals for commitments from
 countries of the Middle East prior to ex-
 ercising our right-and we have the
 right-to enter into agreements with
 those countries.
 I felt at the time that we would have
 greatly strengthened the cause of peace
 if we had required or sought to require
 an agreement through the United Na-
 tions with respect to certain conditions
 before the fact, before we made the
 agreement under the doctrine.
 But other than that the Senator from
 Colorado has expressed the thesis of the
 Senator from Oregon.  Our difference is
 that I would have made greater use of the
 United Nations in that instance than we
 did.  I am grateful indeed to the Sen-
 ator from Colorado for strengthening my
 record this afternoon as history will read
 it on the subject which I rose to discuss.
 Mr. CARROLL.     Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. MORSE.  I yield.
 I ought to say, to
 keep the REco    ear, that Jim Farley
 is my friend. We must remember that
 there are some political differences in
 the State of New York.  For example,
 Mrs.  Eleanor  Roosevelt and former
 Senator Herbert  Lehman  support
 Stevenson. In 1956 Jim Parley was a
 strong Stevenson supporter. Now he
 may have another candidate. However,
 that is no reason for him to speak as
 harshly as he has about Adlai Steven-
 son.  My able friend from Oregon, who
 is on the floor today, if he does not
 read it tonight, will probably read to-
 morrow morning, that another friend of
 mine, former President Harry Truman,
 is on the news wires today.  He wrote
 an article for Look magazine, on Adlai
 Stevenson. This  current  article has
 nothing to do with the statement on the
 summit by Stevenson.   However, he is
 not  speaking  in any commendatory
 terms about Adlai Stevenson. It is obvi-
 ous that he has a candidate too. He has
 a right to have one. Therefore, I be-
 lieve that people must look at these
 statements-
 Mr. MORSE.  I had one until last
 week.
 Mr.              Yes.  The Senator
 fro regonlaa very good candidate.
 Many times good horses do not run
 strong for a short stretch.  The junior
 Senator from Colorado has been that
 type of candidate. I have to have a
 longwinded campaign, sometimes last-
 ing 6 or 8 years before I am successful.
 Some runners are not sprinters. I wish
 to say to the Senator from Oregon in
 conclusion, if I may, with respect to
 these statements, that I am absolutely
 convinced that Stevenson has a deep-
 seated feeling that this issue affects the
 survival of this Nation, and that he feels
 that we must raise this issue with the
 people of the Nation.  I am confident
 that Stevenson did not raise this issue
 as a partisan political issue, but because
 he  believes  we  must  discuss  these
 matters.
 For more than 2 years the junior Sen-
 ator from Colorado has been trying to
 stir up interest in Stevenson as a candi-
 date.  I do not know Governor Steven-
 son well.  He is more an acquaintance
 of mine. I have met him only a few
 times.  However, I look upon him as
 a  great political  and  philosophical
 leader. He represents a new era in
 politics. I believe that is also true of
 JOHN KENNEDY.   I think it is true of
 the new group that is emerging in the
 Democratic Party.   I think it is true
 of other candidates. It is true of the
 distinguished  Senator . from  Oregon.
 And that is nothing new about him.
 He has been ahead of the field for years.
 That is true of Senator SYMINGTON and
 Senator JOHNSON.  I look about the
 chamber to see if there are any other
 candidates.  [Laughter.]
 We are moving into a new era.  My
 friend the able Senator from Montana
 has advocated-and I supported his
 resolution in 1957, when only a few of
 us stood here with him on the floor of
 the Senate-some supervision over the
 Central Intelligence Agency.  I do not
 like the idea of voting money for an
 agency and not knowing a little about
 what it is going to be used for.  Only
 a selected few Members of the body know
 what CIA is doing.  I do not like that.
 I represent a million and a half people,
 and I am entitled to be able to go home
 and say to the people a little something
 about what the CIA is doing.
 j~        t me correct the Sen-
 ators statement on that point.  There
 is not any select group in the Senate
 that knows what CIA is doing. I am
 a Member of the Committee on Foreign
 Relations.  There are many things I
 cannot find out about what they are
 doing.  They use the top secret label
 against us, too.
 M ^         ROLL,  I can understand
 tli'  sod me ~ught to be kept secret.
 But we ought to have general knowledge
 about the guidelines and about the con-
 trols and about who gives orders ancO who
 makes reports.
 Mr. M        I should like to make
 thb co  neaten a this point.  I do not
 think anything should be kept top secret
 without a check, under our system of
 government.  It cannot be spread out
 worldwide, but at the same time I do not
 believe in vesting any branch of our
 Government with police-state power and
 top secret power, where there can be no
 check upon its administration.
 That is a step in the direction of police-
 state powers.  I have always opposed it.
 I happen to think that the elected repre-
 sentatives of the people can be trusted
 with the type of top secrets that any
 President or any head of the CIA can be
 trusted with. Most of the people who do
 have access to top secrets have never
 been elected to political office in their
 lives. So I do not buy the argument that
 we should not have a check on the Presi-
 dent of the United States in respect to
 this matter of top secrets.
 We can have - a check on it without
 having it known throughout the coun-
 try and known throughout the world. I
 am not going. to give any man, even the
 President of the United States, un-
 checked power, because that is what
 brings about tyranny in times of crisis..
 Mr.  CARROLL.  Mr. President, of
 cottrae'?f agree-4 h that.  The Consti-
 tution provides for that. I wish to make
 this personal reference.    I had per-
 sonal knowledge at one time that Presi-
 dent Truman, _when he was President.
 a report fro   I irate ige ce la report f ro   I   e 16  . 1i oni so
 thttinow `'" at was-going -on.
 He got those reports every morning.  I
 assume that this is being done with
 President Eisenhower.
 Mr. MORSE. Let us hope so.
 Mr. CARROLL.  There may be some
 things withheld from him.  I reiterate
 this because I think it is very important.
 I think that all Americans are entitled
 to know, of course, who gave the order
 for the May Day flight. Why was it done
 on May Day?  What was its purpose?.

 Was it done stupidly, blindly; was it
 merely a colossal blunder, or was it some
 force working even against Eisenhower
 and against the administration, to blow
 up this conference? I think we are en-
 titled to know what the facts are.
 I thank the Senator for yielding.
 Mr. MORSE. I should like to say to
 the acting majority leader that I am
 about to yield the floor.  Would he like
 to have me suggest the absence of a
 quorum?
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Not at this time.
 Mr. MORSE.  I yield the floor.
 GRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 May 23
 21ST FINANCE DISBURSING SECTION,
 APO 381, San Francisco, Calif.,
 August 22, 1959.
 Eon. RALPH W. YARBOROUGH,
 Senator from the State of Texas,
 Senate Office Building, Washington, D.C.
 HONORABLE DEAR SIR: I am writing to in-
 quire whether it would be possible for you
 to give me assistance in securing a special
 bill for the admission to the United States
 of a Korean national whom I plan to adopt
 in order that I might give him an education
 and  other  opportunities  for 'development
 which I feel that I am in position to offer.
 For your preliminary consideration, I sub-
 mit the following information:
 I am 48 years of age, married (22 years),
 wife 49  years old.  Both are in excellent
 health.  We have one child  13 years old.
 Unfortunately after the birth of our daugh-
 ter, we found that we could have no other
 children. I am a Methodist minister, of the
 Southwest Texas Conference; I served as a
 chaplain in the Air Force from March 1943
 to February 1958, at which time I became a
 victim of the reduction-in-forces program.
 I still hold my Reserve commission in the
 grade  of  lieutenant  colonel.  After  the
 reduction-in-forces, I enlisted in the Air
 Force in  order to  qualify for retirement.
 Upon retirement (1963) I will again resume
 my place in the conference as a pastor or
 missionary.  I feel that I am financially able
 to undertake this project (if one can call an
 act of love for another a project) without
 any strain on either my financial or physical
 well-being.
 The young man, whom I plan to adopt (or
 sponsor), is 18 years old.  He has lived
 with or worked for Americans since the age
 of 10.  He is the third son in the Korean
 family. Although both his parents are liv-
 ing, they are agreeable to both the adoption
 and his emigration from Korea.  This boy
 has worked for me during my tour in Korea,
 and from observation-and closely at that-
 I can honestly say that I have never met a
 young man with a higher character quality
 than this lad. In spite of the many tempta-
 tions which have presented themselves to
 him while in his status as houseboy to the
 GI's, he has never adopted the profanity or
 loose moral habits so common to many of
 the other "boys" who find it profitable to
 cater to the wishes of the man they work
 for.  His habits and character bespeak the
 excellent family background from which he
 comes.   Both his mother and  father  are
 practicing Christians-Methodists.  His older
 brother, who  is  now in the Republic  of
 Korea Air Force, hopes to become a Methodist
 minister, if the opportunity could be found
 to further his education in that direction-
 which assistance I may be able to secure
 through the help of some local church which
 may sponsor his training.  As for my boy, I
 plan to place him=first in a special school or
 private tutor to prepare him for entrance
 into Lon Morris Junior College,  Jackson-
 ville, Tex., and then to Southern Methodist;
 University.  Because of the extreme poverty
 of  the  family  all  the  sons,  except the
 youngest, have had to stop school at the end
 of the free-school period, which roughly is
 equivalent to our grammar school.      I have
 checked his school record and find that he
 stood sixth in the class of almost a hundred
 children.  He has a ready and eager mind.
 and I feel that he will have no difficulty in
 pursuing his studies.
 I shall appreciate you advising me of the
 proper steps.I should take in this matter.  I
 am due to return to the United States in,
 March of 1960, and I should like very much
 to be able to take the boy with me as I go.
 If I have to await the normal quota for
 Korean immigration the time would be a
 minimum of 5 to 6 years, since he does not
 qualify for a student visa or passport.  By
 YI YOUNG AN
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the pending
 business be temporarily laid aside and
 that the Senate proceed to the consid-
 eration of Calendar No. 1289, S. 2681.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill
 will be stated by title.
 The  LEGISLATIVE  CLERK.   A bill  (S.
 2681) for the relief of Yi Young An.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER.  Is there
 objection to the present consideration
 of the bill?
 There being no objection, the Senate
 proceeded to consider the bill, which
 had been reported from the Committee
 on the Judiciary, with an amendment,
 in line 8, after the word "said", to strike
 out "Yin" and insert "Yi", so as to make
 the bill read:
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of
 Representatives  of the  United  States of
 America in Congress assembled, That, for
 the purposes of sections 101(a) (27) (A) and
 205 of the Immigration and Nationality Act,
 the minor child, Yi Young An, shall be held
 and considered to be the natural-born alien
 child of Staff Sergeant and Mrs. John L.
 Brown, citizens of the United States: Pro-
 vided, That the natural parents of the said
 Yi Young An shall not, by virtue of such
 parentage, be accorded any right, privilege,
 or status under the immigration. and Na-
 tionality Act.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent to have printed
 at this point in the RECORD the pertinent
 parts of the report as they relate to the
 desirability of this measure.
 There being no objection, the excerpt
 from the report (Rept. No. 1252)  was
 ordered to be printed in the RECD^D, as
 follows:
 PURPOSE OF THE BILL
 The purpose of the bill, as amended, is
 to  grant  to  the minor child adopted by
 citizens of the United States the status of
 a nonquota immigrant which is the status
 normally enjoyed by alien minor children
 of U.S. citizens.  The bill has been amended
 to correct the spelling of the beneficiary's
 name.
 STATEMENT  OF  FACTS
 The beneficiary of the bill is a 19-year-
 old native of Korea, presently, residing there,
 who was adopted in Korea on February 22,
 1960 by citizens of the United States.  He
 receives his full support from them.    His
 adoptive father has served continuously with
 the Air Force since 1943 as a chaplain. Af-
 ter attaining the rank of iieutenent colonel
 he was retired under a reduction-in-forces
 program, and thereafter enlisted and is pres-
 enly serving a tour of duty in Korea which
 terminates in June 1960.  After retirement
 in 1963 he plans to resume his ministry in
 the  Southwest  Texas  Conference  of  the
 Methodist Church.  The adoptive parents of
 the beneficiary were married in 1938 and
 have a 13-year-old daughter. Information is
 to the effect that they are financially able
 to care for :him.
 A  letter?  with   attached  memorandum,
 dated December 16, 1959, to the chairman of
 the Senate Committee on the Judiciary from
 the Commissioner of Immigration and Nat-
 uralization with reference to the bill reads
 as allows:
 DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE,
 MIGRATION AND NATURALISATION
 SERVICE,
 Washington, D.C., December 16, 1959.
 Hon. JAMES 0. EASTLAND,
 Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,
 U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.
 DEAR  SENATOR:  In  response to your re-
 quest for a report relative to the bill (S.
 2681) for the relief of Yi Young An, there
 is attached a memorandum of information
 concerning  the beneficiary.   This  memo-
 randum has been prepared from the Immi-
 gration and Naturalization Service files re-
 lating to the beneficiary by the Houston,'
 Tex., office of this Service, which has custody
 of those files.
 The bill would confer nonquota status
 upon the 19-year-old alien to be adopted
 by U.S. citizens.  It also would provide that
 the natural parents of the beneficiary shall
 not, by virtue  of such parentage, be ac-
 corded any right, privilege, or status under
 the Immigration and Nationality Act.   It
 is noted that there is a difference in the
 spelling of the beneficiary's name in lines
 5 and 8 of the private bill.  According to
 the records of this Service the correct spell-
 ing is Yi Young An.
 As a quota immigrant the beneficiary
 would be chargeable to the quota for Korea.
 Sincerely,
 J. M. SWING,
 Commissioner.
 MEMORANDUM OF INFORMATION FROM IMMI-
 GRATION AND NATURALIZATION SERVICE FILES
 RE YI YOUNG AN, BENEFICIARY OF S. 2681
 Information concerning this case was ob-
 tained from Mr. and Mrs. John L. Brown,
 foster parents of the beneficiary.
 Yi Young An, a native of Korea, was born
 on July 18, 1940.  He has never been in the
 United States.  He presently resides in Ko-
 rea with Mr. Brown and is fully supported
 by him.   The foster parents intend to adopt
 the beneficiary under the laws of the State

 VICE PRESIDENT-MULON DDRESSES
 ANNUAL  CONVENTION OF THE
 NATIONAL  SALES  EXECUTIVES
 ASSOCIATION IN BUFFALO, N.Y.
 Mr. KEATING. Mr. President, New
 York State recently welcomed distin-
 guished visitors when Vice President and
 Mrs. Nixon appeared in several upstate
 cities.  In a notable address before the
 annual convention of the National Sales
 Executives Association in Buffalo, the
 Vice President discussed the causes and
 aftermaths of the breakup of the sum-
 mit conference.
 More importantly, perhaps, he dealt
 with what all of this may mean for the
 future and with what America's role
 must be in leading the world to peace
 and security.  Of particular pertinence
 were his remarks on the need to extend
 the mutual security program without
 serious cuts.
 Mr. President, so that this address
 may reach the wide readership it de-
 serves, I ask unanimous consent that it
 be printed at this point in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the speech
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 TEXT OF ADDRESS DELIVERED BY VICE PRESIDENT
 RICHARD  M. NIXON BEFORE ANNUAL  CON-
 VENTION of TH    ATIONAL SALES EXECUTIVES
 ASSOCIATION ON MAY 1f;, 1960, AT BUFFALO,
 N.Y.
 Tonight I want to talk to you about a
 major problem, certainly the problem that
 is in the mind of every person in this room
 and most of the people in this Nation and
 probably in the world.  You have read and
 heard that the summit conference is over,
 Mr. Khrushchev has decided to return to
 Moscow and President Eisenhower, after his
 visit to Portugal, will return to the United
 States.  And so people are asking questions:
 What does it mean?  Why did it happen?
 Who was at fault?  Mr. Khrushchev's answer
 Is that the United States is at fault.  He
 says President Eisenhower personally must
 assume responsibility because he ordered the
 flights which have occurred over the Soviet
 Union over the past 4 years for the purpose
 of obtaining information to guard against
 surprise attack against the United States
 and  the free  world.
 efef t,haa?gad,-,# at because of heU
 dent, and because he was so shocked to learn
 that some of these flights had occurred and
 that the President had ordered them,  t Ie
 su        c9,Uf@Tence could not go forward.
 Then he went on'to say he felt that no
 conference should be held now until the
 American people should have an opportunity
 to vote for another President and then
 possibly the climate might be changed.
 Having said these things, of course, specu-
 at oon immediately comes up as to whether

 possible reason for his acting as he did was that by waiting for 6 or 7 months to pass
 pressure that he was under from Stal   stn  and for the American election to occur, that
 or- extren Isi   within the Soviet Government, the American electorate then might select

 Now if r may go to a second point.  I be-
 lieve that Mr. Khrushchev, in making his
 announcement that he was going to break
 up the summit conference, and in attempt-
 ing to convince the world that he was doing
 it because of the U-2 incident, made three
 major mistakes in judgment.
 One, he misjudged the intelligence and
 sophistication of the leaders of the world
 r
 oug
 out the world.
 And so,  having analyzed the  events  to
 date, may I turn to the future. What will
 happen now?   What will Mr. Khrushchev
 do-and what should we do?  Again, we are
 in the area of conjecture.  I would first say
 that as far as Mr. Khrushchev Is concerned,
 no one can predict what he will do on Ber-
 lin, or with regard to the disarmament con-
 ferences that have been
 i

 activities, would be so shocked to find that                     and one thing other observers have noted, is
 the United States was attempting to obtain                       that he is very sensitive to world opinion,

 could be obtained.  Certainly, I would think                     Khrushchev will have to have his assessment

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 Dr. Galbraith minimized the risk of bad
 faith in these words: "Some of our estimate
 of the danger of bad faith, we must agree, will
 be the residue of the bad feelings of recent
 years."',:,With this sweepingly simple analysis
 of the cd14 war Professor Galbraith not mere-
 ly succeeds in equating communism with
 democracy, but ignores the essential amoral-
 ity of commurlsm, its long record of perfidy
 and violated tt aties.  For my own part, I
 take it for grant?d,, that if there is enough to
 gain from cheatin~t and il' the cheating can
 be made reasonably afe, the Kremlin will
 cheat.
 .~"
 FACING CI ICE
 What would the Kremli z  ain from cheat-
 ing?                 If the Kremlin were t   et there first
 on the antimissile missile o   he neutron
 bomb or on any. other major    hnological
 breakthrough in nuclear weaponr my con-
 viction is that we would in short o  er find
 ourselves confronted with a choice b weep
 yet proposed would provide detection capa-
 bilities only  down to  the level                       of a 20-
 kiloton (Hiroshima) blast.  For the life of
 me I see no point to any detection system
 which would cost several billion dollars to
 install and probably another billion dollars
 a year to operate, and which would leave the
 Communists free to sner.k test any device
 up to the size of a Hiroshima-type bomb.
 Even  at  levels  much.  .lower  than  20
 kilotons it is possible to do a tremendous
 amount of significant testing.  Such testing
 would not merely be immediately applicable
 to the entire range of clean, tactical nuclear
 weapons but would be applicable, by extrapo-
 lation, to the development of improved or
 radically different strategic weapons.
 RISKS INVOLVED
 My estimate of the relative risks differs
 fundamentally from Professor Galbraith's at-
 titude.                 I believe that the greater our nu-
 merical and technological preponderance in
 nuclear weapons, the smaller the chance of
 war.  I believe that an effective nuclear test
 ban, if such a thing were possible, would not
 decrease the danger of war by one iota.  I
 believe that a test ban or moratorium ob-
 served only by the open societies would great-
 ly increase the danger of a thermonuclear
 holocaust.
 I believe that the  opinion of mankin
 free world served by an agreement based Oh
 President Eisenhower's proposal of Febrry
 11.  This called for a ban on all test  that
 contaminate the atmosphere and det     table
 tests in space and underground, for    joint
 research program on detection, anfor the
 extension of the test ban to oth  -areas as
 improved means of inspection wee  developed.
 Unfortunately, we have now 4arted from
 this position and agreed in prim iple to a ban
 on undetectable space shots'nd a morato-
 rium on undetectable u./de  ound tests.
 I fear that by these csions we have
 placed the free world in jepardy.

 CONFLICT OF INTERESTS
 Mr. DIRKSEI   Mr. President, a very
 interesting editorial was published in the
 Wall Street  Ournal of May 17, 1960,
 under the cation "Conflict of Interests."
 I thought the significant statement in
 the editorii`t1 was the last, which is:
 It is really a matter of determination of
 charactee't' For a conflict of interest is to be
 found  bt in a man's bank box, but in his
 heart. ',-
 I think the editorial is worthy of repro-
 duction and wider dissemination, so I ask
 No. 9e-2
 unanimous consent that it be printed in
 the RECORD at this point.
 There tieing no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 CONFLICT OF INTERESTS
 Mr. Edward K. Mills, Jr., an attorney, has
 requested President Eisenhower to withdraw
 his nomination as a member of the Federal
 Communications Commission.  It is impos-
 sible, Mr. Mills said, for him to divest himself
 of an interest in stock in the communications
 field to a degree that can be "regarded as suffi-
 cient."
 It is impossible because the stock is held
 by a bank acting as trustee for a trust fund
 established by his family with Mr. Mills as
 beneficiary some years ago.  It is impossible
 for Mr. Mills to sell his stock-as Mr. Wilson
 sold his General Motors stock at great per-
 sonal sacrifice, as it turned out-because he
 doesn't own it or control it.  But he could
 benefit from a rise in its value, or suffer
 If ever a situation could point to the up:'
 alistic policy of expecting men to diy,st

 raise the "s  dards" of TV      radio pres-
 entations by                                                                                    vernment "pe  Iasi on."
 But the iron    that if t   were to be done
 on a broad eno    scalee TV and radio
 industries believe y    uld have lost reve-
 nues.  So if anyone    eves Mr. Mills might
 have acted in a way t would influence the
 value of the comm  c    ons investments in
 his trust, :they ma very   ell be right.  Mr.
 Mills might, wh a raisin   he standards of
 the industries be was too   see, have suc-
 ceeded also i ",lowering his    n revenues.

 is a     s reputation for honesty an  integ-
 rity?"       seems to us the better    y to
 remain honest no matter what he owns or
 what temptations are placed in his way.
 It is not really a matter of divestment.  If
 it were, we ought to require all Secretaries of
 the Treasury to get rid, even of their dollar
 bills-on the ground that a man might in-
 duce the Government to follow policies that
 could make the dollar more valuable and
 thus benefit himself.
 It is really a matter of determination of
 character..  For a conflict of interest is to be
 found not in a man's bank box but in his
 heart.
 AGRICULTURE AND FARM CREDIT
 ADMINISTRATION   APPROPRIA-
 TIONS, 1961-CONTINGENCY LAN-
 GUAGE
 Mr. D:[RKSEN.  Mr. President, in the
 welter of things happening yesterday I
 had hoped to invite attention to one item
 in the department of Agriculture ap-
 propriation bill, but I was in and out
 of the Chamber so much during the day
 that I did not quite get around to it.
 However-, I talked with some members
 of the committee and with other Sen-
 ators with respect to the matter.
 My comments relate to two items.
 First, in. regard to the so-called Farm-
 ers Home Administration there was an
 appropriation provided and, in addition,
 10231
 there was language to the effect that the
 Administration would be entitled to
 spend an additional $40 million if it were
 required.  It was my notion that per-
 haps the language ought to be safe-
 guarded by requiring approval of the
 Bureau of the Budget; but there was some
 objection to doing so.  Therefore, I did
 not offer the amendment.
 I understand,'however, that under the
 language as row carried in the bill, if
 the Administrator feels it is necessary to
 spend the 1>,lbney and goes to the Bureau
 of the Budget and insists upon having
 the addiinal money made available, the
 money ;must be made available.
 Th;nteresting thing about this mat-
 ter  Simply that we enlarge the expendi-
 tu's for fiscal year 1961, but the enlarge-
 tal for that particular department.
 A comparable provision was carried
 in the bill with respect to the Rural Elec-
 trification Administration,  and made
 available an additional $60 million for
 telephone loans and $60 million for elec-
 trification loans, or a total of $120 mil-
 lion. The Budget Director has told me
 that if the demand is made it is virtually
 impossible for him to resist it, so the
 money may be expended.             -
 This is a total of $60 million plus $60
 million plus $40 million, or $160 million.
 If the $160 million is expended, then
 instead of the so-called $135 million re-
 duction in the budget figure as reported
 by the committee, actually there will be
 an excess expenditure over the budget
 figure.
 This is not exactly back-door financ-
 ing.  This is a contingent appropriation.
 I become a little concerned about it, be-
 cause instead of a back door it might
 become a trapdoor.
 I did not want the legislative record
 to be closed on this matter without allud-
 ing to this. I am sensible of the fact that
 the language was incorporated in the
 bill as it came from the House of Regre-
 t   language and did not modify the
 a unts provided, but simply concurred
 in    action taken by the House.
 I a   pretty confident that those who
 are be  with budget problems and an
 effort to  aintain a balanced budget are
 looking u ' n this with dubious eye, be-
 cause the    ay feel the budget is in
 balance an uddenly discover the de-
 mand for th contingent amounts will
 be made. If s'   a demand is made and
 the money is ex  nded in the fiscal year
 to come, then of  urse what now looks
 like a budget cut 1 really be an addi-
 tion to the budget.
 Perhaps, Mr. Presidknt, I should read
 into the RECORD the t'lpntingency lan-
 guage in one of these ps agraphs.  It is
 after the regular appropriation:
 * * * and additional amounts, not to ex-
 ceed $60 million for each program, may be
 borrowed under the same terms and condi-
 tions to the extent that such amount is
 required during the fiscal year 1961 under
 the then existing conditions for the expedi-
 tious and orderly development of the rural
 electrification program and rural telephone
 program.

 they were shouting and at least a third of
 them were crying.
 Why?  We were the Vice President of the
 United States and his wife.  Why?  We rep-
 resented a powerful country, but Mr. Khru-
 shchev had been there just a month before-
 he represented a powerful country, and he
 had not received a welcome like this.  Why?
 Because to the people of Poland behind the
 Iron Curtain under totalitarian government
 since World War II, America stood for some-
 thing more than military strength and eco-
 nomic strength.  It stood for freedom, for
 the  hopes  of  people  everywhere,  for  the
 right to be free, and for moral and spiritual
 values which have always been the great
 heritage of our Nation.  This is something
 we should never forget.
 And so tonight, may I tell you that in this
 hour of difficulty in this Nation's and the
 world's history, we  can and should have
 faith-faith in our country, faith in our
 principles, and faith in our future.  We
 should  have that faith  because  of  our
 strength, our military strength and our eco-
 nomic strength; but we should have it main-
 ly because we're on the right side, the side
 of freedom, the side of justice, the side of
 peace with honor, the side of a nation that
 wants not an acre of territory nor an eco-
 nomic concession for any other person in
 the  world.  Standing  for  these  things,
 America can and will, I am sure, help lead
 the forces of freedom and justice and peace
 K to victory in the years ahead.
 Thank you.
 MOTION PICTURE BASED ON RICH-
 ARD FREDE'S BOOK, "THE IN-
 TERNS"
 Mr. MURRAY. Mr. President, a mo-
 tion picture based on Richard Frede's
 book, "The Interns," depicting the func-
 tion and duties of interns in hospitals, .
 is being made in Hollywood by Producer
 Robert Cohn for Columbia Pictures.  I
 believe this picture will create consider-
 able discussion of the manner of opera-
 tion of modern hospitals and the way in
 which interns are treated.
 I ask unanimous consent to have
 printed in the RECORD a brief review of
 Mr. Frede's novel by Robert Cohn.
 There being no objection, the review
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 Hollywood and the motion picture indus-
 try and Producer Robert Cohn are making a
 motion picture out of Richard Frede's book,
 "The Interns."  While the book, which is,
 now in its third printing, will reach many
 thousands of readers, the screen as a mass
 medium will bring the message of the novel
 to many millions in this country and abroad.
 The sotry of what goes on behind scenes in
 a hospital will unquestionably cause many
 hospital boards and administrators to cast
 a searching look at their own domains. The
 beneficiaries of this will be the sick and
 injured of the country and everyone who
 requires hospitalization at any time in the
 future.
 TRIBUTE TO JAMES W. MURPHY
 Mr. O'MAHONEY.  Mr. President, the
 entire Senate is saddened by the death
 on April 11, 1960, of James W. Murphy,
 senior member of the corps of the official
 reporters of the Senate.
 As a Member of the Senate I feel
 deeply the loss of a dedicated, able pub-
 lic servant who, by his patience, his
 painstaking efficiency and his excep-
 tional fund of knowledge in reporting
 and editing an accurate account of the
 proceedings of the Senate, has been of
 immeasurable assistance to me and to all
 my colleagues in our work.  And as an
 individual I grieve the loss of a friend, a
 friend whose loyalty, kindness, good
 humor, wit, and unfailing courtesy have
 enriched my daily life during the nearly
 half century I have known him.
 James Murphy came to the office of
 the official reporters on December 7, 1896,
 and from that day on, for close to 64
 years, he gave unstintingly of his time
 and his very considerable talents to serve
 the Senate. , I am convinced that no re-
 porter ever gave better service to any
 parliamentary body in the world.
 With Mr,  Murphy's passing there
 ended 108 years of continuous official
 Senate reporting by his family.  The
 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD itself, the Senate
 section of which our esteemed friend and
 his most capable staff so carefully pre-
 pared every day the Senate was in ses-
 sion, was established largely through the
 efforts of the first Murphy to serve as
 Official Reporter. Dennis F. Murphy, the
 uncle of James W. Murphy, was selected
 in 1848 by Senator John C. Calhoun to
 of the summaries by which debates and
 proceedings of the body had been re-
 corded up to that time; 25 years later
 .the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD, as we know
 it today, came into being.
 Dennis Murphy served as Official Re-
 porter of the Senate until 1896, the year
 his 17-year-old nephew, James, joined
 the corps as an amanuensis.  He was the
 fourth member of the family to enter
 the employ of the Official Reporters' Of-
 fice; at that time his father, Edward V.
 Murphy, had, been a reporter since 1860,
 and the elder Murphy served until his
 death in 1911).  Another uncle, James J.
 Murphy, had, been an Official Reporter
 from 1854 to 1874. In all, the four mem-
 bers of the Murphy family served the
 Senate as Official Reporters for a total
 of 191 years, a record I doubt any other
 family can approach in any line of gov-
 ernment service.
 In the nearly 64 years James Murphy
 reported the colloquies, debates  and
 other proceedings of the Senate he re-
 corded a wealth of American history and
 gave generously of his counsel and as-
 sistance to many of our,Nation's leaders.
 In 1917, when I came to Washington as
 secretary to the late Senator John B.
 Kendrick, of Wyoming, I first became
 acquainted with Mr. Murphy, and he was
 most helpful to me in my new duties.
 He was a good friend of Wyoming's senior
 Senator Francis E. Warren, and soon
 Senator Kendrick, as well as his secre-
 tary, also came to regard him as a valued
 friend. Mr. Murphy's and my friendship
 strengthened down through the years,
 with the result that the loss I feel today
 at his death is personal and deep.  I
 shall miss this scholarly gentleman, this
 great American, during the remainder
 of my days.
 To the members of Mr. Murphy's
 family I extend my most sincere sym-
 pathy.  They may be comforted by the
 realization that he served his country
 well and that his memory will live long
 and honorably in the hearts and minds
 of countless men and women who con-
 sidered him their friend.
 The PRESIDENT pro tempore.  Is
 there further morning business? If no,
 morning business is concluded.
 Without objection, the Chair lays be-
 fore the Senate the unfinished business.
 SERVING OF OLEOMARGARINE OR
 MARGARINE IN NAVY RATION
 The Senate resumed the considera-
 tion of the bill (S. 2168) to amend the
 Navy ration statute so as to provide for
 the serving of Oleomargarine or mar-
 garine.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT.  Mr. President, the
 bill which is the pending business merely
 amends the Navy's ration statute to in-
 sert the words "margarine" or "oleomar-
 garine."  It gives the Navy permissive
 authority to use margarine for table use,
 which authority is not now explicit in
 the statute.
 The Navy Department itself for some
 time has indicated it wanted this au-
 thority.  In many cases it is not possi-
 ble to secure butter and margarine can
 be used with no loss of nutrition and at
 less cost.
 As I said at the time of the introduc-
 tion of this bill :
 There is no valid reason why the Navy or
 any other branch  of  the  armed  services
 should not be given simple freedom of choice
 to buy what foods it wants or that necessity
 requires it to use, within the structure of
 the present ration statute.  The omission
 of margarine from the ration statute is a
 simple  discrimination  against a  perfectly
 good pure food product made from American
 farm products.
 The bill S. 2168 is only permissive.      It
 does not require the Navy to buy any-
 thing.
 The bill limits this permissive authority
 by section 2, which provides that, except
 where the Secretary of Agriculture finds
 and certifies that there is a surplus of
 either soybean oil or cottonseed oil, mar-
 garine may not be used by the Navy for
 table use if surplus butter stocks are
 available to the Navy through the Com-
 modity Credit Corporation.
 It is apparent, therefore, that this bill
 is in no sense a restriction of or injury
 to the dairy or butter industries.  It goes
 far to protect surplus butter's disposition
 channel in the armed services.      It puts
 both butterfat and vegetable oils on the
 same level of treatment, insofar as those
 commodities may be in surplus.
 I am now informed that there is no
 uncommitted stock of surplus butter.
 The great majority of CCC butter goes
 into the school lunch program.
 S. 2168 is, therefore, a bill that seeks
 to remove a discrimination and to put
 two American farm products on the
 same basis in respect to use in Navy
 messes.  I urge the Senate to approve
 this bill,
 HE COMMUNIST INFILTRATION IN

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 the view, in this respect, which I think was
 very well stated, by Chancellor Adenauer
 who told me while visiting my house a few
 weeks  ago, that Mr,  Khrushchev without
 "11" question-being a dedicated Communist-
 wanted communism to rule the world; that
 this was his objective and would continue
 to be his objective regardless of the means
 or  the  shifts  in policy  which  he might
 adopt. But on the other hand, as Chancellor
 Adenauer put it very graphically, Mr. Khru-
 shchev does not want to rule a world of
 ruined cities and dead bodies.   And he
 knows, as we know, the terribly destructive
 force of atomic weapons; he knows, as we
 know, what a war would do to the countries
 which he may want to rule and what it
 might also do to his own country. And there
 is another argument Mr. Khrushchev might
 have in this respect: He firmly believes, I
 think, based on the conversations I've had
 with him-as well as other statements he
 has made-that he can gain his objective of
 domination of the world more effectively and
 more surely at less cost without war.
 This brings us, then, to the key problem
 of the future. In the massive 2; -hour press
 conference that Mr. Khrushchev held in
 Paris today, I think that the most significant
 line in it was. one that perhaps will go un-
 noticed in most areas of the reporting of
 that conference, or relatively unnoticed.  It
 was this: Referring to this whole problem
 of elections in the United States, he said,
 well, if the next President doesn't take the
 right line, we'll wait for the next President
 and the next one after that.  Then he said
 this significant thing: "Because we can af-
 ford to wait, we can afford to wait."
 There is nothing that I think is more
 typical of the Communist attitude and the
 Communist line, and more a challenge to us,
 than what Mr. Khrushchev says in this re-
 spect.  The Communist has a sense of his-
 tory. He thinks in terms of not 5 years, but
 ')f a century, or 2 centuries if necessary;
 and he is willing to wait.  He believes that
 he and his cause have the stamina and the
 strength to outlast the decadent societies
 of the West among which we, of course, are
 classified.  So this is the challenge to us.
 Do we have the stamina, do we have the
 strength, do we have the determination in
 this nonmilitary struggle, which is going
 on now and which will continue to go in the
 years ahead: One, to resist further Com-
 munist gains; and two, to win the uncom-
 mitted areas of the world, who hold the
 balance of the power, to the side of freedom
 and away from those who would win it for
 communism.  This is the key question of the
 next 10 years of the sixties and even beyond
 my day.  I'd like to direct my remarks just
 briefly to this question in the time that
 remains tonight.
 Let us look at this area.  A billion people
 live in Asia, in Africa-a billion people who
 are unlike in many respects, but who are
 alike in that most of them are desperately
 poor and all of them need economic progress.
 Prime Minister Nehru put it very graphi-
 cally to me when he said that the per capita
 income in India is one-twentieth of what it
 is in the poorest State in the United States.
 You have never seen poverty until you have
 seen it in Asia and in parts of Africa, as I
 have seen it and my wife has seen it.  You
 can see why the leaders of these countries
 say, "We must have progress."  And so the
 question is, How are they going to get it?
 Which way are they going to turn?     Some
 say, "Well, will they take progress without
 freedom?"  The answer is that they would
 prefer not, and this is one of the main cards
 we have in our hands.  Believe me, the lead-
 ers of these countries in Asia and of the
 newly developing countries in Africa, despite
 what you may hear to the contrary, want to
 be on our side.  They prefer to have their
 progress and retain their independence and
 retain an opportunity to develop free insti-
 tutions, not like ours, because they need
 different institutions since they have differ-
 ent types of development that we have, but
 institutions which at least give them the
 right of self-determination.  But make no
 mistake about it: If the terrible choice left
 to these people is progress without freedom
 or staying where they are, they will take
 progress without freedom.
 The Communists tell  them, "Come our
 way." . They don't tell them, of course, that
 the cost is freedom, but these people know
 that the cost is freedom.  But the Commu-
 nists say, "Look at what we've done in
 the Soviet Union, look at what we're doing
 in China; come our way, for this is the way
 to progress for the teeming millions who do
 not now have an adequate standard of liv-
 ing." There must be an alternative in which
 it can be shown that there is a way to have
 progress without giving up freedom; unless
 there is that alternative, the battle for the
 world will be lost in this area just as surely
 as if a war were fought in which we were
 the loser as well as civilization itself.
 That brings me to a very unpopular sub-
 ject.  There now is a bill before the Congress
 for appropriations for the Mutual Security
 Act. Part of it goes for the purpose of main-
 taining adequate defenses abroad.  Part of it
 goes also for technical assisstance, for loans,
 for other programs designed to -see to it that
 the people in these uncommitted countries
 that I have mentioned, who hold the balance
 of power in the world, are not faced with
 this terrible alternative of going the Com-
 munist. way or staying where they are.  Yet
 this is a bill which has no constituents at
 home; this is the one that is damned always
 as a give-away; this is the one where people
 say, "Cut it down and spend it here in the
 United States."  Particularly at this time,
 when in my opinion there is no question but
 that Mr. Khrushchev will step up his activi-
 ties in the nonmilitary aspects of the world
 struggle, the United States should support
 adequate programs in the mutual security
 area and particularly in the technical and
 economic aid areas of the program provided
 by this bill.
 I could say many things that would be
 much more palatable to you, but this needs
 to be said and that is why I wanted to say
 it at this point.
 One other point I would like to develop in
 that connection.  In the years ahead, we will
 have to maintain adequate military strength
 so that we are never in an unfavorable posi-
 tion or an unequal position at the bargain-
 ing table.  We also must maintain our mu-
 tual security programs, as I have pointed out,
 and we must maintain our programs of eco-
 nomic assistance abroad.  How, this means
 that, the United States must have an econ-
 omy which is strong, and sound, and produc-
 tive.  There is another point about the econ-
 omy which, I think, should be made before
 this audience.
 Mr. Khrushchev,  in  selling  his  wares
 around the world, constantly says: Ours is
 the way to the greater progress. He says, we
 are moving faster than the United States;
 the America economy used to be a pretty
 good one, but it isn't as good as it once was
 and, therefore, ours is the way of the future.
 I think he put it best, perhaps, with one of
 his very clever analogies, when he was speak-
 ing in India a few months ago.  You may
 have read what he said.  He likened this
 competition between the American economy
 and the Soviet economy, to a horse race.
 And in referring to the American economy,
 he said: "There was a horse, but now it's old
 and tired and limping, whereas our Socialist
 steed is young and vigorous and vital and
 moving faster; we will soon pass it by and it
 will never catch up."  Is he right?  My
 answer is, he is wrong, but only provided we
 stay on our horse and don't try to get on his,
 as far as the economic system 1s concerned.
 We hear a great deal about growth these
 days in this country.  How are we going to
 have adequate growth, they say, how is our
 economy going to grow fast enough?  There
 are those, some very well intentioned, who
 say: The way to growth in the United States
 is to increase the size of Government and to
 spend more in Government, and that spend-
 ing by Government of and by itself is a way
 to make the economy of the United States
 grow at a fixed level which the Government
 can set.
 Let's understand exactly what we're talk-
 ing about here.  Government has some real
 responsibilities for spending-in the military
 area, in the national security area, in the
 economic-assistance area to which I referred
 in the area of space, and in the necessary
 areas at home with which we are all familiar.
 But let us never forget that in our system
 Government should spend only what it needs
 to spend, and that Government spending
 should never be an end In itself. Or if I can
 put it another way: If we are going to have
 maximum growth of the American economy,
 that will keep us ahead of the Soviet Union
 as we are ahead of it today, the way to get
 that maximum growth is not to increase the
 size of Government or to increase Govern-
 ment spending; rather, the way to achieve
 this growth is to expand the opportunity for
 creative action  for millions of  individual
 Americans in the private enterprise system.
 If we bear that lesson in mind in these
 years and months ahead, I am confident that
 we will win this struggle.  We will be betting
 on the right horse, a horse that has served
 us well, and one that can continue to serve
 us well if we give it a chance, the chance that
 It can and should have.
 Now, if I can bring one final thought to
 you, which is perhaps as important as any-
 thing I have said, if anything has been im-
 portant in your minds up to this point.
 I've  been  speaking  about  our  military
 strength, about our economic strength, about
 the battle for the uncommitted nations and
 the prospect ahead.   I believe all of these
 are highly important parts of this struggle
 in which we are engaged.  But they are not
 all of that struggle. There is another part
 which is even more significant and one which
 I can best illustrate by an example.
 People have often asked, Why did the
 President get the magnificent reception he
 did in Asia and in South America?  Part of
 the reason certainly is because he is a world-
 famous man and people in that part of the
 world-as here-like  to  see world-famous
 people.  But it could not all be ascribed to
 that; certainly, part of it also was because
 of the country he represented.  To prove
 the point, may I tell you how my wife and
 I had a reception which could not have been
 due to the fact that the people were trying
 to receive  a  world-famous  man-nor his
 wife-but which, nevertheless, was the most
 moving experience of our life.
 It occurred after our visit to Russia last
 year.  We   went  to  Poland on  a  Sunday
 afternoon from Moscow.  The Polish Gov-
 ernment, before we arrived, had tried ap-
 parently to discourage any crowds in the
 streets by not printing our route into the
 city and not indicating the time of arrival;
 but the-word some way had gotten around.
 After the plane landed, we drove from the
 airport; as we went through the suburbs of
 Warsaw into the city, increasingly large
 groups of people came to gather on the
 streets, and they were singing, they were
 throwing bouquets of flowers onto our cars.
 When we got into the heart of the city-
 and understand, no notice by the Govern.
 ment, no attempt to get a crowd out-when
 we got into the heart of the city, a quarter
 of a million people were.there, stopping the
 caravan eight times so that we had to move
 them out in order to move on.  And when
 the caravan stopped, we were able to look
 into their faces, and they were singing and

 Ater hearing the feasibility of the lower

 THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 a0 Mr. WILEY.  Mr. President, some-
 where rook of Books, there is.the
 statement that "a little child shall lead
 them."  It was my privilege yesterday
 to speak to a group of more than 42 chil-
 dren from a high school in, as I recall,
 Oshkosh, Wis.  Then I submitted my-
 self to questioning.
 One of the questions was related to
 the recent U-2 plan incident and went
 something like this: "Senator, if we have
 agreed not to continue the exploratory
 missions w7tf-6ffr O~  how are we_gping
 to know what is goi g n ns' side  ussia?"
 That/ t"stion was as e   e ore'-Midas
 was thrown into space-our recent won-
 derful demonstration that we are not
 behind, but that we are ahead, of the
 Kremlin.  So perhaps that is the answer.
 But I could not answer the question ex-
 cept to say that in this age of explora-
 tion, we will find the answer or we will
 continue the U-2 exploratory plane mis-
 sions.  To me, that makes commonsense.
 But the little child had the answer,
 because what are we going to do if we do
 not know what is going on back of the
 Iron Curtain?  My mail indicates clearly
 that that attitude exemplifies the atti-
 tude of a good many people.  They re-
 alize we have got to be on our toes, that.
 we cannot fall asleep, that as I have said
 many times, we have got to be adequate,
 that we cannot put ourselves in the posi-
 tion of running the risk of another Pearl
 Harbor.  So that little child had the
 wisdom that some grownups do not have.
 Tomorrow, or on Friday, as everyone
 knows, we expect to have the Secretary
 of State before the Foreign Relations
 Committee, and, of course, a great many
 questions will be asked him.  Some of
 the questions were submitted on the floor
 of the Senate by the Senator from Ohio
 yesterday. Let me say that practically
 all of the questions have been answered.
 The people know the answers now, be-
 cause of the discussions over the radio
 and over television.  As a matter of fact,
 one of our great American reporters,
 whom I heard last night, intimated that
 the people in Europe are not a bit upset,
 that they understand the situation.  We
 want to know what the Kremlin is up to.
 The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The
 time of the Senator has expired.
 Mr. WILEY.  I ask for 3 more min-
 utes..
 The PRESIDENT pro tempore.          With-
 out objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. WILEY.               They recognize the sit-
 uation.  They recognize also that
 rng sas been going Qn from  >       s,
 and that there is a difference when one
 goes into a country in uniform, goes into
 that country armed, as a spy, and when
 a,_pl otQgrapherwith_ the.. .U.-2 instru-
 ment, covers the space about which he
 wants to know what is going on.  In
 other words, because we could not get
 behind the Iron Curtain, we had to go
 over it.  When we got over it, we got,
 as many of us know, excellent pictures
 of what the Kremlin has built up.
 One of the questions that has been
 asked is, "What was the underlying cause
 of Mr. Khrushchev's action in Paris?"
 Fundamentally, I believe there were a
 number of factors, including:
 The Soviet Premier did not want a
 conference, because it was evident that
 the allies, standing shoulder to shoulder,
 were not going to make concessions to
 the demands of the Communists.
 Mr. Khrushchev, too, has troubles at
 home, economic and military, with the
 proposed reduction of armed forces, as
 well. as political unrest.
 Mao Tse-tung, opposing the relatively
 conciliatory line adopted by Khrushchev,
 needled him for a tougher policy.
 The Kremlin, I frankly believe, was
 afraid of the tremendous impact which
 Mr. Eisenhower's visit would have upon
 the Soviet people.  After all, Ike has
 demonstrated his salesmanship over a
 great deal of this earth.  The people
 know he speaks with conviction and that
 he speaks honestly.   The people have
 faith in him.  Khrushchev was afraid
 of the impact of his visit, there is no
 question about it.
 One of the things I was particularly in-
 terested in was what was stated by this
 Russian youngster of 28 or 29 years of
 age, who recently left the Kremlin's
 espionage force. He said:
 You know, there is a new generation of us
 youngsters in Russia.  We are not satisfied
 with our standard of living.  We are not
 satisfied with our voice in the government.
 We want something more to say.
 That all intimated to me, at least, that
 Khrushchev is not having such an easy
 time.
 Mr. President, all added up-they
 called for Khrushchev's grabbing at
 straws, in this case, the U-2 incident-
 to call off Soviet participation in a con-
 ference that. would not give them what
 they were expected to demand.
 Is there any known explanation of
 Khrushchev's personal attacks on Presi-
 dent Eisenhower?
 While it is only speculative, it seems
 reasonable to deduce that the pressures
 on Khrushchev were so great that he
 found himself in a position not only of
 denouncing U.S. policy, but because of
 previous past, relatively friendly rela-
 tions with the U.S. President, now found
 it necessary to denounce him personally.

 If there had been no U-2 incidebi,
 would the conference have been held?
 From all evidence available, it appears
 that if Khrushchev.ld not used the U-2
 flight as an excu5.e, he_would klave found rea, anQ  er      ,,for refusing to hold the
 conference,
 What was the significance of Malinov-
 sky's attendance at the conference?
 The presence of the general-looking
 over Khrushchev's shoulder-may well
 indicate a stronger voice of the military
 in Soviet affairs.  In the past, military
 chaperons have proved far more omi-
 nous than just a,)-raveling companion
 for leaders of communism.
 What is the situation now inside
 Russia as a result of the blowup of the
 conference?
 For the Communists, the hard core of
 Stalinists apparently have won a point.
 For the general population, however, all
 evidence points toward a great uneasi-
 ness-including fear of war from the
 blowup of the conference.  A major ob-
 jective of the U.S. policy now must be
 aimed toward stemming this uneasi-
 ness-insofar as possible-and separat-
 ing the acts of the Communist leader-
 a 4-690 minority in the Soviet Union-
 from. the people.
 What was the reason for the U-2 flights
 beh'rl l'roii Curtain?
 The arts of is simple. We were gath-
 ering in       n to prevent a sneak
 attack upon ourselves or any other coun-
 tries of the world which are targets of
 Communist aggression. Until now, there
 has not, unfortunately, been developed
 any ways of obtaining information in
 specific detail, on activities behind the
 Iron, as well as the Bamboo Curtains, to
 provide us with the knowledge necessary
 to be aware of any buildup that might
 result in a sneak attack.
 The overflights provided us with this
 information. They were not military at-
 tacks. The planes were not armed. The
 flight was an integral part of our policy
 of self-preservation.
 If the Soviets were willing to adopt
 any realistic international agreements
 to prevent the possibility of armed ag-
 gression or sneak attack, these would not
 be necessary; or, if they were willing to
 agree to the open skies proposal as rec-
 ommended by President Eisenhower, the
 flight would not have proved an inci-
 dent at all.
 We recognize, of course, that the whole
 field of airspace law still is relatively un-
 explored. The nations of the world have
 their job cut out for them to more clearly
 define national interests and boundaries
 in air and space.
 Now, why were there seemingly con-
 tradictoxy statements a.lBout'? the U-2
 flight?
 Following the takeoff of the plane, it
 became known that the plane was not
 on schedule. However, there was no way
 of telling what had happened to it, or
 whether the Soviet claims of knocking
 it down were correct.  Until this could
 be established by adequate evidence,
 there  seemed some     question  as  to
 whether or not it would be realistic to
 state that the plane had been involved
 in an overflight over the Soviet Union.

 The effect of automation is to increase pro-

 of a dynamic balance between the number

 jobs is very precarious.  The solution is less

 thing for everybody  to do.   This can he
 achieved  through  the    shorter  workweek,
 through a lower retirement age, and through
 a raising of the age at which people enter the

 tained by limiting the speed at which auto-

 is taken-or, if dyer are not all taken-the

 Opponents of any reduction in the re-
 irement age maintain that such a move
 would be too expensive.  Certainly it
 would cost more than the present pro-
 gram, but how much does it cost the
 Government when X number of work-
 ers are without jobs?  Would not the
 reduced cost of public welfare and un-
 employment compensation programs go
 a long way toward equalizing the in-
 creased cost of lowering the age for re-
 tirement?
 The Social Security Administration
 provided figures recently which indicate

 The figures are based on the long-term

 would be a fraction more than two-fifths
 of 1 percent of payroll-more easily un-
 derstood, approximately $1.4 billion per
 year.  The self-employed would be re-
 quired to contribute a little less than
 one-third of 1 percent of the payroll.
 Approximately 1.5 million male workers
 would be affected immediately.
 More feasible would be the plan, as I
 have stressed, for both men and women
 to receive full benefits at age 62.  The
 ium cost, the employee and em-

 PICTURE OF A BOMB
 One of the few reports ever published
 about the neutron bomb-in the Washington
 Post,     July 19, 1959-gives you an idea of
 how e     live one version would be:
 "Too        in the maximum range, the bomb
 would be      loded high enough to reach its
 intended     v  ims  without  going  through
 structures,  t   a,  hills,  or other barriers
 which might sl       down the neutrons."
 The neutrons         uld travel with enough
 force,  however,  s     this  article,   to  go

 The bomb would deli           "a lethal dose of

 Fallout in today's bombs is crew d when
 radioactive debris and dust are carry   away
 from the immediate target area by the   ast.
 Sometimes this "hot" debris is sucked u , by
 winds that carry the fallout where it
 not intended to go.
 In the neutron bomb, only a small fission-
 type explosion would be needed as a trigger.
 This would create correspondingly less blast
 and fallout.
 Now there is talk that TNT or another
 ordinary explosive could be used to set off
 a neutron bomb.  If so, this would create
 a weapon with so little blast that not even
 the familiar atomic mushroom would appear.
 ON THE BATTLEFIELD
 Of what use is all this, anyway?  some
 civilian scientists ask, when there already
 is enough destructive power in the world?
 Such a weapon, according to one authority,
 could be used to great advantage tactically
 on a battlefield where two armies faced each
 other.  It could be used to knock out an
 enemy   division   without   contaminating
 friendly forces.  The bomb would maim or
 anihilate enemy soldiers who have invaded
 friendly soil without destroying the indus-
 try or homes of allies.
 That    advantage  works  both ways,  this
 authority points out: "The reason we think
 this principle is so important to the Rus-
 sians is that any country that wants to con-

 The danger of a neutron bomb in Yie hands

 though these officials are beili  told not to

 Work on the neutrony'-bomb theory in this
 country is said to b--centered at the Uni-
 versity of California?s Radiation Laboratory
 at Livermore, where advanced weapons are
 developed for the ,Atomic Energy Commission.
 It was at this laboratory that the hydrogen
 bomb was perfected.
 Livermore e6ientists consider the challenge
 of the neut,,i`on bomb in many ways to be
 more dem tiding than the hydrogen bomb.
 In tod
 ry's bombs, neutrons that are re-
 leased   e slowed down and "captured" in
 the b b-blast process before they get very
 far and do much damage.  A practical way
 must be found at Livermore to enable more
 neutrons to "escape" more easily and pene-
 trate great distances with great speed.
 The neutron bomb is more than a scientific
 problem, scientists say. It involves the whole
 cold-war picture.  Against that background
 you are told this by non-Government scien-
 tists who know the story-
 The big reason why scientists from the
 Livermore Laboratory, such as Dr. Edward
 Teller,  its  director, have  been  outspoken
 against   a,  test-ban   agreement  with  the
 Soviets is that they are worried about the
 neutron bomb and other atomic develop-
 ments just ahead.
 How, they ask, can you ever enforce a test
 ban?
 It also explains why Dr. Teller and others
 who know the facts have said this Nation
 should  resume  underground  testing  of
 nuclear weapons  at  the   first possible
 moment.
 They say this Nation has no time to waste.
 HOW FAR AHEAD?
 Much work is said to remain before the
 neutron bomb is perfected.
 Scientists                     see  the  Russians  as  moving
 ahead with research and possibly even with
 sebret tests of the components of a neutron
 bomb.  There is no way, under the "morator-

 HALTING ATOMIC  TESTS-CHOICE  OF   LEAST
 PERILOUS COURSE BELIEVED TO BE NECESSARY
 To the EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES:
 The recent hearings before the Joint Com-
 mission on Atomic Energy, like much earlier
 discussion, suggest the presence of a strik-
 ingly unrealistic attitude toward an agree-
 ment on halting atomic tests.  I do not sug-
 gest that this attitude is universal, but it
 does  seem  sufficiently common  to  merit
 comment,
 We most surely agree that our task is not
 to eliminate all risk from our lives-that is
 an impossible goal-but to find the course
 of policy that minimizes risk.  This requires
 that we balance the dangers of different
 courses of action.  In the present instance
 there is, on the one hand, the danger of illicit
 violation of any agreement to ban tests and
 that the violation will go undetected. On
 the other hand, there is the danger of con-
 tinued  explosions.  We  must  choose  the
 course which involves the least peril.
 Almost everyone must agree-and most do
 agree-that the dangers inherent in con-
 tinuing the tests are virtually total.  The
 tempo of competitive development and test-
 ing                                                                   will  increase.  The  countries newly
 possessed of atomic weapons will claim their
 right to poison their just share of the at-
 May 25
 mosphere.  Obviously those who are making
 tests  themselves  cannot  deny  then  the
 privilege. All of these dangers are predicta-
 ble and certain in the absence of agreement.
 POSSIBLE BAD FAITH
 Against this, as noted, we must reckon
 with the possibility of Soviet bad faith and
 that it will escape detection.  Some of our
 estimate of the danger of bad faith, we must
 agree, will be the residue of the bad feeling
 of recent years.  And. bad faith that involves
 risk of discovery is' not without disadvan-
 tage as a practical-policy.
 But it is not`my purpose to argue that
 this  course  is riskless.   Rather,  what  is
 clear is that Ohatever its dangers, they must
 be less than. the dangers of the first course,
 which are! certain and total.   Yet this    is
 not the stature of much of the present cal-
 culatioijY                                                                                                                                       It holds that the danger of viola-
 tion e ust be totally eliminated or we will
 congfiue the tests.  One is reminded of the
 m     who insists on suicide unless he      is
 y y protected against automobile accidents.
 fu l
 11- Surely we are more logical than that.
 Nor is it reassuring that many who advise
 against accepting the lesser rislbelieve that
 any test ban makes poor military sense.  We
 have recently heard that our military secu-
 rity requires a new series of tests this sum-
 mer or autumn.  And a high official of the
 Defense Department has recently stressed
 the need to develop atomic weapons which,
 though they burn, blind, disintegrate, muti-
 late, and otherwise commit to a disenchant-
 ing death, are nonetheless clean,
 CONCEALED POSITION
 The danger of illicit violation has thus be-
 come part of the case against the agree-
 ment as such.  It has no past of this case.
 If we believe an agreement is unwise, we
 should say so.. This position should not be
 concealed behind arguments over enforci-
 bility.   We fool no one with such trans-
 parent devices.
 But I have difficulty in imagining that re-
 sponsible military opinion can face with
 equanimity a world of uncontrolled tests.
 In the annals of armies there have always
 been examples of excessive and myopic pre-
 occupation   with   military   goals.    Yet
 thoughtful military leaders certainly agree
 that the purpose of the armed services is to
 ;,.protect the continuing life and civilization
 "qf the community. Arn ed services are but
 omeans to this end and diplomacy and
 dlpiomatic agreements are among the others.
 14s to see the problem whole that we have
 civilii control of the Armed Forces.  This
 will on,, occasion require the overruling of
 too paroehial a military view.  The danger
 lies not 14, doing so, but in failing to do so.

 RISKS IN BANNIk TESTS-JEOPARDY TO FREE

 To the EDITOR OF THE" lEW YORK TIMES:
 Prof. Kenneth Galb " th's letter published
 May 13 argues that in,oosing between the
 test ban  and continued testing we must
 choose the course which 1pvolves the least
 peril.  With this general p    osition no one
 can find any fault.  The onlyrouble is that
 he failed to specify what kind" test ban he
 had in mind.
 Is it to be a total ban based bp an en-
 forceable system of inspection tit offers
 some reasonable chance-let us say- one-
 In-ten chance-of detecting                                                                                                                                            and verifying
 sneak tests?  Or is it to be a total ban with-
 out inspection, in which we would have to
 rest the security of the free world on nothing
 more substantial than the Kremlin's word of
 honor?  Obviously, it makes a big difference.
 I do not see how the comparative risks can in-

 what you are comparing.

 1960                       CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENTE
 }ld Governor Stevenson's actions
 have infCuence ` W. Zfirushchev's deci-
 sion to "find an excuse" to postpone the
 summit conference?
 From all indications, from statements
 made recently by the Governor, the sit-
 uation is as follows: If the Democratic
 Party won the presidency in 1960, Gov-
 ernor Stevenson, if not President, would,
 from all indications, occupy a high
 place-perhaps Secretary of State-in
 Government.
 From Mr. Stevenson's recent state-
 ments, it would certainly be reasonable
 to deduce that if there were a Demo-
 cratic victory, the Russians might have
 a better chance to get what they wanted
 from the summit conference.
 I am not, of course, inclined to say
 that the Democratic Party, in any way,
 is "soft on communism"; at the same
 time, Mr. Stevenson's statements indi-
 cate that if he had a voice in things, he
 would be far more likely to make conces-
 sions to the Soviets.
 For example, I cite the tra.n. lotion of
 the article by Special Correspondent,
 Robert Boulay, which, though Mr. Ste-
 ~elrysi """suffers from misinterpre-
 tation, or mistranslation," was published
 in the Paris newspaper, "Paris-Presse-
 i'Intransigent," as follows:
 Question. What,  according  to  you,  Mr.
 Stevenson, is the most important question in
 the political world today?
 Answer. The suspension of atomic tests-
 this is a prime question.
 Question. Can it be achieved?
 Answer. It must be possible to reach agree-
 ment through mutual concessions.
 Question. I take it that you refer to agree-
 ment with precise control-inspection?
 Up till now the Russians have not accept-
 ed the minimum inspection formula pro-
 posed to them by the Western Powers.
 Answer. Naturally, an agreement with in-
 spection * * * but I repeat to you that an
 agreement must be possible.  This problem
 of atomic tests must be considered as abso-
 lute priority. With mutual concessions * * *.
 Question. Does this problem appear to you
 of such importance as to justify concessions
 on other matters?
 Answer. Yes, certainly.
 Question.  Does this mean that the West-
 ern Powers should make concessions on the
 German problem?
 Answer.  Yes, certainly.
 Question. On Berlin?
 Answer. Yes.
 I was surprised and persisted-
 Question. Do you establish a connection
 between atomic agreement and Germany and
 more particularly Berlin?
 Answer. There is no connection.  But an
 atomic agreement is basic and justifies con-
 cessions on other matters.  Since you men-
 tion Berlin incidentally, the present situa-
 tion cannot be maintained.
 WHY 11,000
 Question. But the Western Powers are not
 the petitioners in Berlin.  It Is the Russians
 who seem to wish to force the Western Pow-
 ers to leave Berlin?
 Answer. Mr. Boulay, the present situation
 in Berlin cannot be maintained.  Strategi-
 cally, the presence of 11,000 American sol-
 diers is meaningless * * *
 Question. Must I understand that you are
 prepared to accept a reduction of American
 forces in Berlin?
 Answer. Yes. * * * One could have, for in-
 stance, 7,000.
 Question. Why 7,000 rather than 11,500?
 Would you accept 5,000, or 3,000, or none
 at all?
 Answer. Yes, but not now; later.
 (I once again expressed surprise, and asked
 Mr.  Stevenson to  explain  himself  more
 fully.)
 Question. Do you believe it Is possible to
 take the political and moral risk of such a
 decision?
 Answer. Mr. Boulay, do not be surprised.
 All I am telling you, I have already said and
 THE NEUTRON BOMB
 Mr. DODD.  Mr. President, in my re-
 marks to the Senate on May 12, 1960, I
 indicated that there was a distinct pos-
 sibility science could produce a neutron
 bomb, which could obliterate life with-
 out causing serious physical damage to
 property. , I tried to point out that the
 nation developing this weapon first would
 have a tremendous advantage in limited
 war, strategic bombing, and defense
 against missile attack, and that a re-
 sumption of u12lierground nuclear test-
 ing was necessal'y if we were to develop
 this weapon ahea' of the Soviets.
 I asked the Pre 'dent to inform the
 Nation of the posse  ity of developing a
 neutron bomb so th t our leaders and
 our people might r  lize the critical
 nature of any test ban  reement which
 foreclosed this develop nt, while per-
 mitting the Soviets to wor on it through
 Thus far there has been 119 official re-
 sponse and last week, News                                                       ek maga-
 zine, apparently the victim    misin-
 formation, curtly dismissed t       possi-
 bility of a neutron bomb and tread it as
 News & World Report takes a diff nt
 view.  It states that United States d
 Russian scientists are working on t ; e
 neutron bomb and quotes scientists to th
 effect that .we have only a million to on
 chance of finding out whether Russia is
 secretly testing neutron bomb weapons.
 I ask unanimous consent that this ar-
 ticle from the May 30 issue of U.S. News
 & World Report be printed in the RECORD
 at this point.
 There being no objection, the article
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 [From U.S. News & World Report, May 30,
 19601 .
 MOST TERRIBLE BOMB or ALL-NEW WEAPON
 NOW IN SIGHT
 Next-a death ray bomb?
 Such a bomb is being sought here-and
 in Russia, too.
 Once ready, it could destroy human beings
 by  invisible                                       streams  of  neutrons,  leave
 buildings standing.
 Detecting  tests                                    of this      neutron bomb
 will be almost impossible. That's why many
 U.S. scientists oppose a ban on nuclear tests.
 Behind closed doors in the United States
 and in Russia, scientists are working on a
 weapon that. could alter the cold war.  It
 is the neutron bomb-the bomb that no
 one wants to talk about.
 This new 'weapon, when perfected, could
 destroy  men while  leaving  machines  and
 buildings undamaged.
 The weapon-in one possibility being dis-
 cussed-could be built as a lightweight de-
 vice able to send out streams of poison
 radiation greater than those produced by
 today's big, conventional' nuclear bombs.
 This versldn would be so compact, some
 sources predict, that a team of soldiers could
 fire neutron warheads into enemy concen-
 trations from simple launchers.  A team of
 saboteurs could carry a small neutron bomb
 into an enemy country to destroy men at
 essential nerve centers.
 Some scientists call this the death ray
 weapon of the future.  The blast it would
 almost intact.  It would produce almost no
 uncontrolled  fallout. Yet  its radiation-
 the real "guts" of a nuclear bomb-would
 be a highly effective and invisible crippler
 or killer of human beings.
 USELESS BANS
 At a time when a ban on nuclear tests is
 in the news, it is suddenly discovered that a
 workable neutron bomb would make mean-
 ingless any attempt at enforcing such a test
 ban.
 The chances of finding out whether Rus-
 sia was secretly testing neutron-bomb weap-
 ons, civilian scientists say, would be a mil-
 lion to one because the blast signals would
 be so weak and disguised.
 This is the real worry among scientists in
 this country who know all the facts about
 the neutron bomb.  They are convinced, one
 of them says, that the Soviets could make a
 mockery of any test ban, even if both sides
 agreed to numerous inspection sites and
 listening posts.
 How far both sides have advanced In their
 research on the neutron bomb is a closely
 held secret.  No project in recent years Is
 held to be more sensitive. by experts in the
 Pentagon.
 From the Soviet Union come only broad
 hints at interest-and progress-by Soviet
 scientists.  But  some  experts  have  asked
 whether the neutron bomb is the fantastic
 weapon Khrushchev recently predicted for
 the Soviet arsenal.
 NO COMMENT
 What is known, in fact, about the ability
 to produce a neutron bomb comes mainly
 from civilian U.S. scientists not connected
 with the Government.  The Atomic Energy
 Commission, by its rules, refuses to acknowl-
 edge that the bomb exists even in theory.
 It was of this secrecy that Senator THoaiAs
 eWher the United States or Russia--might
 be   ore than 6 months from reality, the
 Na   n is being kept in the dark about the
 neu   n bomb.
 Se    for Donp said that, despite the official
 seereo  he learned this:
 "Suc     a bomb can theoretically be pro-
 duced     tailoring the energy of a fusion
 explosion. that, instead of heat and blast,
 its prim  product is a burst of neutrons."
 f5ATH-DEALING STREAMS
 The storysehind the neutron bomb in-
 volves these faarther details:
 When -a nul4ear bomb is exploded, it re-
 leases energy     several forms, but mainly
 as heat and ligli,  Heat is what causes blast
 and shock and t e big mushroom seen after
 Another emana , n from a nuclear bomb
 is lethal radiatio    always in  very  small
 amounts in presentweapons-about 3 per-
 cent of the total ene'y.  One primary form
 of this radiation is streams of neutrons, the
 particles that are kick6~,1 loose from the core
 of the atom.  Most of ti$;em don't travel very
 far-now-but, when they reach human be-
 ings, neutrons deform an$,destroy body cells
 and, in sufficient dosages,' cause death.  A
 high percentage of the Hiroshima and Naga-
 saki atomic victims died not from blast but
 from radiation.
 Now it appears possible to build the kind
 of bomb that will cut down on the amount
 of. blast and "hot" debris and send larger
 and  more  powerful  streams  of  neutrons
 shooting out in all directions.         -

 THE COMMUNIST INFILTRATION IN
 THE NUCLEAR TEST BAN MOVE-
 MENT
 Mr. President, in
 his statement of January 22,
 J. Edgar Hoover warned that
 Nikita Khrushchevts
 Approved For Release 2004/05/13 : CIA-RDP90T00782R000100050001-8
 `visit to this country had resulted in the
 reinvigoration of the American Commu-
 nist movement and that the FBI was re-
 ceiving increasing evidence of stepped-
 up Communist activities at many points.
 Among  other  things,  Mr.  Hoover
 warned that non-Communist organiza-
 tions dedicated to causes that command
 popular support could expect Commu-
 nist efforts to infiltrate their ranks.
 Evidence that has come into the hands
 of the Subcommittee on Internal Secur-
 ity indicates that the Communist Party
 has made the nuclear test ban movement
 the chief target of its infiltration opera-
 tions.            I think it important that this
 evidence be placed before Congress and
 before the public so that we may have a
 better understanding of the methods by
 which the Communists operate and of
 the goals they seek to achieve. I should
 like to detail to you some of the evidence
 of this infiltration, and to suggest the
 outline of a self-defense program for all
 organizations whose purposes make them
 particularly vulnerable to Communist in-
 filtration.
 I do not accept the thesis that If one
 happens to hold a position that enjoys
 the support of the Communist Party on
 any issue, one is, ipso facto, either a pro-
 Communist or a fellow traveler.  The
 Communists are opposed to the poll tax:
 does that make all people who oppose
 the poll tax Communists? The Commu-
 nists support the Forand bill. Does that
 make the many millions of Americans
 who have endorsed the bill Communist
 sympathizers? Obviously not. But on a
 foreign policy issue of overriding im-
 portance like the test ban, if ' a legiti-
 mate organization adheres to a policy
 which coincides with Communist policy,
 then It must be prepared to expect a
 concerted effort at infiltration by the
 Communist termites.  The more urgent
 the issue, the more respectable the or-
 ganization,  the more  illustrious  the
 names on its letterhead, the greater the
 temptation from the Communist stand-
 point.
 The Committee for a Sane Nuclear
 Policy is headed by a group of nationally
 prominent citizens about whose Integ-
 rity and good faith there is no question.
 Among them are people like Norman
 Cousins, of the Saturday Review, W.
 Clarence  Pickett  of  the  American
 Friends Service Committee, Mr. Norman
 Thomas, and so forth.  They advocate
 a point of view which some of us con-
 sider unrealistic or utopian, but it is,
 nevertheless, a significant point of view
 on an issue of life and death impor-
 tance. For the personal motivations of
 most of those associated with the Com-
 mittee for a Sane Nuclear Policy I have
 the most sincere respect.  The point of
 view they represent deserves a hearing-
 indeed, it must be heard.
 Last  'hxsday evepin~19, the
 Committee for a Sane       uclear _ Policy
 held a rally at Madicnn gm4are r arden
 in New York City.  Many eminent per-

 meeting, the speakers urged that an-
 other summit meeting be convened for
 the purpose of attempting to arrive at
 an agreement banning nuclear tests.
 Because :1 esteem the sincerity of the
 original founders of themtGe for
 a Sane Nuclear Policy ari   a sincerity
 of the speakers I have named, it was
 for me an unpleasant duty to have to
 notify them that thethe uubl,- ~?cizedef

 there was also evidence of serious Com-
 munist  infiltration  at  chapter  level
 throughout the Committee for a Sane
 Nuclear Policy; that the Communist
 Party and its front organizations had
 done their utmost to promote the meet-
 ing;  that  the  Communists   provided
 much of the organizing machinery for
 the meeting because they planned to use
 it as, a pressure instrument in support
 of Soviet nuclear diplomacy.
 This information was, by
 the S1Lk?r,   tm;t .ee,pl} Interne oniy several days before the Ipqvqli4ty
 adison
 Square Garden meeting was scheduled
 to take place.  Because I wished to be
 fair to all the decent and prominent
 people who were associated with the
 meeting as sponsors or as speakers, I
 had some doubt about the advisability
 of rushing Into print with my informa-
 tion only 4:8 hours in advance of the
 rally.  Instead, I decided to communi-
 cate the information, or at least certain
 essential portions of it, to Mr.,    nian
 Cousins, the chairman of the Commit-
 tee for a Sane Nuclear Policy. Mr.
 Cousins came to Washington to see me
 a iMV6' a~ INIWAnl  'anl? discgs?ign
 about the,,ijjob1em.
 The directors of the Committee for a
 Sane Nuclear Policy, it turned out, had
 some inkling of the existence of a Com-
 munist infiltration and were extremely
 unhappy about it.  When the Commu-
 nist affiliations of the chief organizer of
 the Madison Square Garden meeting
 were brought to Mr. Qou '' s attention,
 he immediate) suspended the o  anizer
 iii'"~"izes-fion~ -Tlns was-2" cTays`lefore the
 n 66=r. - It is my understanding that
 the national committee of the organi-
 zation intends to take some further
 measures against Communist infiltra-
 tors.
 If I have any criticism to make, it is
 that the directors of the organization
 have moved so slowly to confront the
 problem and that the measures they
 have taken have been inadequate.  I
 was, for example, surprised to discover
 that one of the officers of the commit-
 tee, Mr. Norman Thom   h                                                            early
 as la's't"Janua expressed      - Sus-
 picion a gut- tie in  aual who later
 bee   eorga,nizer of the Madison Square
 Garden meeting-but that no action had
 been taken on Mr. Thomas' warning.
 To me it is appalling that the Com-
 munists should be able to infiltrate and
 manipulate a movement founded on sin-
 cere humanitarian and pacifist motiva-
 tions, and headed by so many reputable
 citizens.  Perhaps this is a situation in
 which remedial legislation is Indicated,
 a situation in which private citizens
 must have the assistance of Government
 to cope effectively with a movement that
 operates by stealth and by secrecy.
 In accordance with the subcommit-
 tee's mandate from the Senate, it was
 clear that our duty required that we do
 everything in our power to get at the
 facts. In presenting the information we
 have gleaned to the Senate, it is my hope
 that I will be able to do so in a manner
 that will avoid injury to the innocent
 and will point the way to a constructive
 course of action by Government and pri-
 vate organizations.
 The test ban has for several years now
 been the chief objective of the Commu-
 nist  propaganda  apparatus.   Of  this
 there is ample documentary evidence.
 In his speech before the congress of
 the Soviet Communist Party on January
 27, Nikita Khrushchev, in his most mili-
 tant rhetoric, called for a permanent
 ban on nuclear tests.
 The main political resolution adopted
 by the 17th congress of the Communist
 Party of the U.S.A. in February 1960
 said:
 The demand that the administration end
 nuclear testing and ban the H-bomb has
 found a widening response in community
 meetings, peace talks, petitions, and ser-
 mons from the pulpit.
 On February 16, 1060, seven Commu-
 nists foreign language newspapers took
 a full-page advertisement in the New
 York Times and called on the Presi-
 dent-
 1. To proclaim the achievement of total,
 universal, and controlled disarmament as the
 goal of National U.S. policy.
 2. To restore the moratorium on the test.
 ing of nuclear weapons and to do everything
 in your power to insure early agreement on
 the banning of all nuclear tests.
 3. To oppose the sharing of nuclear war-
 heads with NATO allies.
 The Committee for a Sane Nuclear
 Policy has not solicited the praise of the
 Communist movement, and most of its
 leaders, I am certain, would be much
 happier if they received no plaudits from
 Communist sources. The fact, neverthe-
 less, remains that the committee in re-
 cent years has been the recipient of con-
 sistent and generous praise from the
 Communist Press.  The Communist or-
 gan, New World Review, for April of this
 year, for example, carried these para-
 graphs under the caption "Peace Groups
 in the United States":
 No amount of conspiratorial silence can
 wipe out the forces for disarmament and
 peace; but it can leave them isolated from
 each other and ignorant of the efforts their
 fellows are making.
 It is our purpose to bring to our readers'

 The  LEGISLATIVE CLERK.  A  bill (S.

 tion that housing is necessary for these
 civilian employees and that there is no
 present intention to substantially cur-

 installations.  The latter certificate is
 conclusive evidence to the FHA Commis-

 posed to insert:
 The Administrator of the National )lpro-

 tent required by the Commissioner, In ac-
 cordance with the provisions of subsection
 (b) of this section, in the case of mortgages
 referred to in this subsection.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER.  The
 question is on agreeing to the committee
 amendment.
 The amendment was agreed to.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there
 be no further amendment to be proposed,
 the question is on the engrossment and
 third reading of the bill.
 Mr. KUCHEL.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator from Alabama give a brief ex-
 planation of the bill and the amend-
 ment?
 Mr. SPARKMAN.  Mr. President, I
 shall be glad to do so.
 Senate bill 3226 amends section 809,
 of the National Housing Act.  Section
 809 was added to the National Housing
 Act in 1956, pursuant to Public Law 574,
 2d session, 84th Congress, to help solve
 the housing problems of essential civil-
 ian employees of the armed services at
 research and development installations.
 The establishment of this special pro-
 gram was necessary because in some in-
 stances homes built for such employees
 in towns near or adjacent to such instal-
 lations would be above and beyond those
 needed for the normal economic growth
 of the community. In the opinion of th
 Federal Housing Administration, hom
 built in excess of those needed for nor) fa1
 growth of a community cannot meet the
 test of economic soundness requ'i.'ed by
 statute as a prerequisite for FN A mort-
 gage insurance. Section 809 permits the
 economic soundness test to bt waived in
 such cases.
 In order to qualify for?insurance,. sec-
 tion 809 provides that? can individual is
 required to hold a certificate issued by
 the Secretary of Defense which certifies
 that first, the employee requires housing;
 second, the emp],o,ree is, on the date of the
 certificate, a civilian employed at a re-
 search and development installation of
 one of the,armed services of the United
 States; and third, the employee is con-
 sidered by the armed services to be an
 essential, nontemporary employee on
 such date.
 In addition, - the Secretary of Defense
 is required to certify to the Commission-
 from the Department of Defense to
 NASA. While these transfers do not al-
 ter the intent of section 809, it has been
 conelhded by the HHFA and the NASA

 NEED TO BE STRENGTHENED
 Mr. KUCHEL. Mr. President, the ne-
 cessity to strengthen the program under
 which the United States is assisting ef-
 forts to reduce air pollution becomes
 more obvious with the passage of time.
 From many quarters, there is being pro-
 vided evidence that the proportions of
 the problem warrant removal of legisla-
 tive shackles from the U.S. Public Health
 .Service and sister agencies, which have
 been charged by Congress with helping
 clean up the atmosphere which is essen-
 tial to existence.

 my colleague from California and both
 colleagues from Pennsylvania, I intro-

 the Secretary of Health, Education, and

 Behind the Midas satellite, . there is
 the reconnaissance satellite.  This in-
 strument--still in the future-can give
 us accurate information as to what is
 happening on the face of the globe.
 It seems to me, however, that we must
 look upon these developments as. more
 than merely weapons added to the mili-
 tary arsenal of the United States.  If
 our vision is limited to methods of de-
 struction, we shall not obtain the only
 truly worthwhile goal-a world of peace
 and a world of freedom.
 The reconnaissance satellite, once it
 is in operation, will bring to a reality
 President Eisenhower's proposal for open

 We live in a country which can flour-

 It prevents their full participation in the
 life of their country. Any worker that be-
 comes unemployed during this period finds
 it impossible to get a job of any importance,
 or at a wage commensurate his ability and
 experience.   It robs him under the social
 security program of any chance of receiv-
 ing worthwhile benefits at 65 years because
 at least 90 percent of the covered employ-
 ment is contained in industry from which
 he is barred.
 The fruitless years between 40 and 65
 that should be the golden years to which
 his industry and good citizenship entitled
 him are instead a period of no meaning,
 no sense of belonging, and breed discon-
 tent and disrespect for our form of govern-
 ment.
 These age barriers are wasteful because
 they rob our economy of the wealth-produc-
 ing potentials of a segment of our labor
 force whose experience has produced skills
 that could be of untold value.  To discard
 these workers at the very height of their
 proficiency is foolish and wasteful.
 They are unsound because they remove
 from our economy a large segment of poten-
 tial   consumer-customers.    An   employed.
 worker is an asset to his country because he
 pays his own way by paying taxes.  An un-
 employed  worker  produced        nothing  and
 therefore is a liability who has to be fed by
 the rest of us through taxes.
 An employed worker creates his own job
 by the alchemy of money circulation.
 This practice has been caused by the rigors
 of present-day competition and cannot be
 corrected by the employers themselves.  It
 can  only  be  corrected  by  governmental
 action.
 Therefore the Fraternal Order of Eagles is
 asking all citizens to join with them and
 petition Congress to pass legislation to out-
 law this unwise practice.
 These petitions are now being circulated
 in prominent spots throughout the city.  If
 you see one ask to sign it.  If you wish to
 sign one and you do not see one, "Mr. and
 Mrs. Anacortes Citizen," contact the Eagles'
 Hall or one of the committee (Stan Ander-

 GATES, JR., A76,,QPENING OF THE EATO 12TH
 ~1TD"VII-S'ERS CONFERENCE, WASHING-
 TON, D.C.
 Excellencies, military advisers, delegates,
 ladies, and gentlemen, it is a unique honor
 to address this distinguished group and to
 open the 12th .SEATO Military Advisers Con-
 ference.
 On behalf of President Eisenhower, the
 U.S. Government, and the American people
 I extend to each of you a most cordial wel-
 come.
 We meet at a time when the world has
 been startled and shocked by the abruptness
 with which the hopes for the reduction of
 tensions from a successful summit conference
 have been shattered.  One thing has emerged
 of great value to all who are devoted to free-
 dom: a new appreciation of the solid basis
 on which our relationships with our allies
 rests.  The people of this country are deeply
 grateful for the unity- shown by the nations
 of the free world at this time.  The bonds
 among us have never been stronger.
 The purposes, current activities, and fu-
 ture tasks of SEATO constitute a vital ele-
 ment in maintaining stability in the course
 of world events.  With communism seeking
 to destroy all that the free nations of the
 world are striving to build and to maintain,
 the stability of the free world depends on
 the security of each of us.  SEATO is based
 on this concept of interdependence, and is
 a proud demonstration of its success.
 The purposes of the SEATO collective de-
 fense to which we have mutually bound our-
 selves remain valid.  Time moves quickly.
 It has been 6 years since eight free nations
 pledged their collective resources to maintain
 the peace and security of southeast Asia and
 southwest Pacific through common action.
 It is significant that the Communists have
 not challenged its integrity nor tested its
 collective  strength  through  direct overt
 aggression.
 During its short span of life SEATO has
 grown from an idea into an effective or-
 ganization.  National forces of the south-
 east                                                                           Asia    countries, backed  by  powerful
 mobile forces contribute to the deterrent
 and provide the security behind which the
 free peoples of the area live and develop
 their resources.  Coordinated SEATO mili-
 tary  plans  have  been                                                                             prepared  and  are
 capable of rapid execution to parry any likely
 Communist threat.
 Through military field exercises, skills have
 been developed and refined, operating pro-
 cedures established, and command arrange-
 ments tested.  SEATO exercises have prog-
 ressed   from  simple  observer  type to  the
 sophisticated maneuvers of land, sea, and
 air units of member nations.
 The United States remains dedicated in
 its support of SEATO.  We are prepared and
 will honor our commitments. Our military
 forces have never been more powerful.  They
 are capable of decisive action in general war
 if this should be forced upon us.  Together
 with our allies we can meet lesser military
 actions anywhere in the world.
 While it is inspiring to note the strides
 already made, great tasks still face us. The
 military threat of .communism has not de-
 clined since SEATO was born in Manila 6
 years ago.  Communist leaders remain dedi-
 cated to the achievement of their goal of
 world domination.  Their tactics, as you are
 aware, consist of threats and blandishments,
 warnings, and false promises.  They exploit
 every opportunity and apply various forms of
 pressure.   If a government is weak, greater
 and increasing pressures are applied in the
 A4475
 hope that a revolutionary situation will de-
 velop. If a government successfully counters
 one particular Communist thrust, the Com-
 munist tactics change.  The recent history
 of the southeast Asia and the southwest
 Pacific  is replete  with evidence  of  such
 Communist actions. jag-W-01 giray Se.iort, to
 military  forcgf,ey Believe  it     will  be
 successful.`
 The=7Piature of this opposition simply makes
 it more difficult for us to accomplish our high
 purpose.  We can be encouraged, however, by
 our success to date.. The collective security
 arrangements of the free world have deterred
 military aggression.  The resolution of the
 nations of SEATO, backed by the tangible
 assistance rendered by the  United States
 through its military assistance program, have
 achieved an effective defense.
 The Secretary of State, the Joint Chiefs of
 Staff, and I are convinced of the indispensa-
 bility of military assistance as an integral
 part not only of our own defenses but those
 of the entire free world.
 We are strongly supporting the program
 of  the President.   We are determined  to
 make the maixmum use of the resources
 which Congress makes available.  Our goal
 is to obtain on a worldwide basis the best
 possible free world defense.
 I have just returned from Paris. Since the
 world press featured the Paris events on
 their front pages almost continuously for
 2 weeks, there is not much I can add to what
 you already know.  In view of the happen-
 ings in Paris, I wish to quote from President
 Eisenhower's message to the NATO minis-
 terial meeting in Istanbul about a month
 ago:
 "We approach these Paris talks with a sin-
 cere desire to do all possible to reduce the
 tensions and dangers that now exist.  Yet we
 cannot reasonably anticipate any quick or
 spectacular results.   This meeting will be
 one more in what may prove a long succes-
 sion of diplomatic exchanges dealing with
 some of the most difficult problems of our
 era.   These  are  not susceptible  to  early
 solution.  We can, at best, hope to make
 some modest progress toward our goals."
 We did approach these talks with a sincere
 desire to reduce world tensions.  As the de-
 velopments                                                                                                                                            unfolded, however,  it became
 increasingly clear that the Soviet Union has
 decided well in advance to torpedo the sum-
 mit.  Western firmness did not back down
 before Khrushchev's ultimatums.
 I would be remiss if I failed to note that
 our colleagues from Britain and France, as
 well as the other NATO partners, displayed
 a convincing unity of purpose and action in
 the face of Soviet divisive efforts.  The So-
 viet conduct both in Paris and at the United
 Nations demonstrated that a difficult road
 lies ahead as we seek solutions to the most
 complex problems of our times.
 It is too early to tell what further de-
 velopments may take place.  The President
 of the United States will continue his efforts
 toward peace with justice and still hopes to
 make, as he put it, "some modest progress
 towards our goals" even though the Soviet
 actions have increased the difficulties.  In
 short, we still intend to seek a relaxation of
 tensions by all means, short of impairing our
 common security. We must always negotiate
 from strength.
 We recognize that military preparedness
 will not by itself meet the challenges fac-
 ing southeast Asia.   Our multilateral  ef-
 forts to promote the economic growth of the
 area and the material well-being of the peo-
 ple must be intensified.   Mere survival is
 not enough to meet the demands of the fu-
 ture.   Social and economic progress must
 be made.  Mature and stable national insti-
 tutions are necessary to the structure we
 are jointly striving to build.

 Canal Block-No Aid

 as-
 of
 a positive and firm U.S. policy in the
 Near East.  In this connection, I would
 like to call to the attention of the Mem-
 bers of this body an editorial which ap-
 peared in the May 4, 1960, issue of the
 Statesman, Salem, Oreg.
 The text of the editorial follows:
 CANAL BLOCK-No AID
 The Senate on Monday passed the mutual
 aid authorization bill.  Its ceiling was only
 about $50 million under the budget request
 Whereas the House cut was $87 million.  The
 final amount, however, will be determined by
 what is Included In the appropriation bill to
 follow.  Probably the cut will be consider-
 ably larger.
 The real battle in the Senate developed over
 a provision to withhold aid to any country
 which denies  free  access to international
 waterways.   This was in the bill passed by
 the House, but Senator FULDRICHT, Chairman
 Everyone knew  that the  provision    as
 aimed at the United Arab Republic    ded
 by Nasser of Egypt who has barre  :ships
 from using the Suez Canal if t re carrying goods to or from Israel. he pro-
 hibition has been strongly con    fned, the
 United Nations itself calling Egypt to
 open  the canal for  univers   use. Nasser
 replies that Egypt I. still instate of war
 with Israel, and so is not    and to permit
 Nasser conveniently f _       ets that United
 Nations, led by the Unit      States, pulled his
 chestnuts out of the irk 1956 when Brit-
 ain, France, and Isr    had Egypt on the
 ropes in their invaMnn and attack on the
 canal.  He forgets that, to induce the in-
 vaders to withdr                           Dulles gave assurances
 for this country expecting the opening of
 the canal.  He  orgets, too, the fast work
 under United    tions to clear the canal and
 thus renew ,,he flow  of revenues  to  the
 Egyptian tr asury from  the users of   the
 canal.  N   er also rejected the intercession
 of Dag H,   marskjold, Secretary General of
 U.N., who was .commissioned to appeal for
 openig the canal to Israeli shipping.
 If not a breach of faith, it is certainly base
 ingratitude toward U.N. for rescuing Nasser
 and his regime from probably crushing de-
 feat.  But the Arab bitterness toward Israel
 bars any  concession  even  though  the
 Egyptian stand is quite untenable.
 Nasser knows we aren't going to go to war
 to open the canal, so he just thumbs his nose
 at us.  The administration favors walking
 sly in the Middle East.  That is under-
 andable, but it is hard to justify foreign
 aid when a nation is so obdurate in resisting
 the pressures of the United States and United
 Nations.  Withholding aid is a mild alter-
 nate to brandishing Teddy Roosevelt's big
 stick.  We. don't need to be pushed around
 all the time by the small nation bidding for
 aid while it ignores its obligations to the
 international community.

 But will the man on the street so interpret
 Stevenson's attitude? The chances are great
 that he will not.   In the first place, the
 timing of the criticism was much too. be-
 lated.  The immediate reaction of the peo-
 ple to disclosure of the U-2 plane incident
 was indignation.  There was a widespread
 feeling that we had goofed, that the admin-
 istration had committed another blunder in
 a long series of diplomatic mistakes dating
 back through both Republican and Demo-
 cratic regimes.  But it soon became clear
 that the summit was doomed to failure
 under  any. circumstances.   Legitimate or
 trumped up, Khrushchev would have found
 an excuse to torpedo the meeting.
 Few Americans, regardless of party, doubt
 Eisenhower's  sincerity  of  purpose.   And
 when he and the great Nation he symbolizes
 as President were subjected to a vicious, gut-
 tersnipe attack, what happened?
 An enormous wave of sympathy developed.
 A tremendous chain reaction of resentment,
 hot as nuclear fission, built up against the
 Soviet   Union.   Our  President  was  being
 pushed around by a loud-mouthed, arrogant
 bully.   Hence, America  was being pushed

 paraphrase a popular song, has the whole

 The Democrats  certainly must  bear  a
 major share of the blame for the ineptitude
 of our bipartisan dealings with Russia over
 the years.  It is a little late in the day for
 a Foreign Relations Committee probe to fix
 blame for the spy plane incident.  The roots,
 if the investigation were fair and complete,
 would extend back at least to 1933.

 motivated both by their American patri-

 Memorial Day 1960
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JAMES E. VAN ZANDT
 OF PENNSYLVANIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Wednesday, May 25,1960
 Mr.  VAN  ZANDT.  Mr.  Speaker,
 within a few days Americans everywhere
 will observe Memorial Day.
 In keeping with the occasion the fol-
 wing statement appeared in my Wash-
 i3nton Newsletter May 28 in lieu of my
 us %l report on legislative activities:
 MEMORIAL DAY 1960
 Mem  Ial Day is distinctly an American
 institut   -a deeply significant sentimental
 custom a   blished by our American people
 more than    years ago.  It is not only ob-
 served in evd~y community across our Na-
 tion but in     y foreign lands and across
 the high seas. 111
 What the Amerman people do in their local
 communities on Memorial Day is actually
 symbolic of our contribution to the overall
 Memorial Day observance  which  is  being
 duplicated by millions throughout our land
 and in several foreign countries.
 To make the point clear the following
 facts must be considered: There are more
 thali 1 million names on the honor rolls
 of the American war dead.  These names
 are the men and women who have fought
 and died for our country since this Nation
 was founded some 185.years ago.

 if the cost is higher than our present level
 of public spending, I frankly believe that
 education and health for. our children, dig-
 nity and beauty in our civic lives, and se-
 curity and well-being in the world at large
 are more important than the "things" which
 might otherwise have priority.
 But   ill more important is America's need
 to face   uarely the facts about its situation.
 If freedo   is really the organizing principle
 of our soci  y, then we cannot forget that it

 but truth, ar`  truth alone, that makes us
 Under the infl    nee of the politics of seda-

 believe that in re   t years self-deceit has
 slackened our grip on reality.  We have
 tended to shirk the   fHcult truth and ac-
 cept the easy half-tr    .  Perhaps it is al-
 ways that way.  As th                  old humorist Josh

 reality entails hard choices      disappoint-

 ARMENIAN INDEPENDENCE DAY
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, this
 coming Saturday marks the independ-
 ence day of Armenia.  This is an anni-
 versary of great patriotic significance to
 Armenian people throughout the world,
 but it unfortunately cannot be celebrated
 in the Armenian homeland as it will be
 observed by Armenian-Americans and
 Armenian  peoples  elsewhere  in  the
 world.  The Armenian Republic was es-
 tablished and recognized by the United
 States in 19201.  But it maintained itself
 as a sovereign nation for only a few
 months, before the armed might of Soviet
 Russia overwhelmed the nation and
 overthrew the independent Armenian
 Government. In the same year of 1920,
 the Soviet Union proclaimed the Soviet
 Republic of Armenia, and the homeland
 of the Armenians remains within the
 Soviet Union today.  In February of
 1921, Armenian patriots fought a valiant
 and  temporarily  successful  rebellion
 against the Soviets, but in a matter of

 SOURCES OF NATIONAL PRIDE
 AWA&L Mr. President, the
 as come and gone.
 It failed, as many thought It would, and
 look back on the Paris meeting and the    ?
 events surrounding it, I believe that the
 American people can be proud of two
 things that emerged.
 First, we have a great source of pride
 in our President. In the face of a bully-
 ing and scurrilous attack by the leader of
 the forces who will, as long as they exist,
 make any summit an impossibility, Presi-
 dent        w=        S d a calm dig-
 nityxgnstF03t wlch  weaker man
 could `not havet?achieved a . He proved
 again that there are in his heart a
 passion and a desire for peace that we
 have not seen equaled in our lifetime.
 It was this simple badge of honesty and
 decency that accentuated the vileness of
 Khrushchev's attack, and made clear to
 the world that the real obstacle to peace
 is the Soviet Communists-not the Soviet
 people, but their leaders.
 Our         source       ids    the
 ,the
 act ievemen
 oft   IJ,;       , my co     encein
 fhls  ency was never too high; but this
 achievement has caused my opinion to-
 ward-.-W to- soar, tamendpusly.                                                                                               Those
 whoso tygs&wri%ets have been punching
 through a dark ribbon of gloom relative
 to our lack of intelligence of our enemy
 must now be amazed at what actually
 has been going on in this field, as I feel
 most Americans must be.  Our 94naze-
 ment Is coupled with pride as we gather
 the secure feeling that we have been
 obtaining knowledge of the enemy at a
 rate and of a quality that surpasses our
 greatest hopes. To the CIA and to the
 Lockheed Aircraft Co., to the men who
 flew the U-2, and to their ground crews
 must go the undying gratitude and re-
 spect of the American people. I detect
 more, by far, of a feeling such as this,
 than the feeling expressed by others-
 others who would apologize to the bully;
 who suggest it was the fault of the
 United States that the summit failed;
 who continue to be afraid of the Soviet
 and would yield West Berlin to the ty-
 rants. Thank God that those timid souls
 are in the complete minority in our land,
 and that the majority of Americans feel
 more secure in the knowledge gained by
 this program; knowledge that makes lies
 out of much that the Communists and
 their sympathizers in our land would
 have us believe; knowledge, for example,
 that the Soviet cannot, as they have
 boasted, shoot down any aircraft flying
 over their heartland, regardless of speed
 of altitude; knowledge that our deterent
 force of more than 2,000 bombers, in-
 cluding 1,400 B-47's and 550 B-52's,
 could fly against their obviously limited
 air defenses with success; knowledge
 that, by the same token, our carrier-
 based aircraft could carry out attacks
 1,000  miles  into  the  Soviet  Union;
 knowledge that some 1,000 fighter bomb-
 ers located around the periphery of the
 Soviet borders could drop atomic or
 TNT bombs from 500 to 1,000 miles with-
 in that country. This is intelligence de-
 veloped from the fights of the U-2 and
 from other sources, and it is something

 an investigation into this entire matter.
 To me what the CIA has done was some-
 thing that had to be done, and it is
 as integral a part of national defense as
 the weapon in the hands of a soldier.
 One of the first tenets of war is to know
 what your enemy has and what he might
 do with it. This is what the CIA and the
 military were trying to do, and what they
 should always be trying to do.  To me
 this is the duty of the intelligence gath-
 ering agencies, and not the business of
 some committee of Congress. To be sure,
 it would be a closed-door investigation,
 but all of us here know that there are
 hundreds of ways for what goes on be-
 hind closed doors to become the property
 of the press, the radio, the TV, our peo-
 ple, and, I might add, the Soviets. I am
 hopeful that those who, in the heat of
 developments, called for this inquiry
 will, in the interest of the country, see
 that it does not proceed. Gathering in-
 telligence of what the other fellow is do-
 ing is practiced by business, by labor or-
 ganizations; yes, even by some husbands
 and some wives. It is not new. It is not
 novel.  It must go on at the national
 level, and we, as a branch of our Govern-
 ment, should not make more difficult a
 task which is always a hard one.
 The   President's  suggestion,  made
 again last evening on TV, that the
 United States institute a system of
 worldwide surveillance so that every
 country could know what every other
 country is up to militarily, coincides with
 a similar one I made on this floor last
 week.  I urge that it be done with any
 equipment we have, and I hope we will
 utilize not only surveillance missiles but
 the B-70, with its 80,000-foot-plus, 2,100-
 mile-an-hour capability.
 Today the errors committed are far
 outweighed by the successes achieved.
 Instead of carping at our mistakes, we
 should forget them and devote our efforts
 to stimulating a national pride in the
 two successes we have-our President's
 actions in face of the enemy and our

 GOVERNOR ROCKEFELLER DELIV-
 ERS CHALLENGING ADDRESS ON
 AMERICA'S THIRD CENTURY
 Mr. TMATING.  Mr. President, at a
 meeting the World Affairs Council of
 Philadelph on April 22 Gov. Nelson A.
 Rockefeller,   New York, delivered the
 first of a se  s of four addresses on
 major issues c   ronting the people of
 the United Stat    The title of this ad-
 dress was "TheT                    d Century," its refer-

 tury of our history                     a nation is open-
 ing before us.
 Governor Rockefeller  viewed the his-
 torical background in    ch we enter
 this new century, and h stressed the
 tremendous area of challe a that lies
 before us on this threshold o   new era.
 In view of the stirring nature this ad-
 dress, of its significance in terff of our
 spiritual growth as a nation,    nd in
 terms of our position of leaderskiP re-
 sponsibility in the world of free    , I

 There being no objection, the address
 and question~ and answers were ordered
 to be printecl'n the RECORD, as follows:
 THE THIRD   ENTURY-A CONCEPT OF
 AMERI N FOREIGN POLICY
 (By Gov. Nelson   Rockefeller, of New York)
 In this city so - rofoundly linked in fact
 and in memory     th the birth of America,
 I appeal to histor o remind us plainly, as a
 people, where we    nd., for what we stand,
 where we may fall,  here we dare not fall,
 but must prevail.
 It rises from the ve history and heritage
 and character of the erican people.
 As a people, we ha    cherished and re-
 spected. basic spiritual                                                                                          d religious beliefs
 and values proclaiming        e supreme worth
 Our beliefs about indi   ual man have
 been rooted in the profo    and priceless
 truths of Judaism and Chri anity.
 These truths define man     the supreme
 creature of God.  They ther  re proclaim
 the individual the supremely    uable being
 on earth,  and the free fulfill ent of his
 destiny the supreme purpose of fe itself.
 No state can decree this fulfil  ent: God
 alone could do that.  No state       define
 Brother to all men and the servan # none,
 the free individual is gifted with a li hose
 laws   and  standards and  purposes    tand
 above, not beneath, the state.      f
 And the true role of the state, theree, is
 to respect and to serve the matchless di pity
 achieved in the political world in which th
 found themselves.
 ment of creating in the form of the Amer-
 ican  Nation  a  political  structure  within
 which this deep belief in the worth of the
 individual, and these spiritual values, could
 flourish and find fulfillment.
 This action was destined to inspire the
 dynamic   political   forces   of democracy
 principles have forever inspired us to reach
 out beyond the framework of our own Nation.
 Accordingly, through the ensuing decades,
 we as a people have given testimony by our
 deeds to the values we cherish and to our
 concern for humanity at large.
 We have done this in many and changing
 ways:  in  things  religious,  through  mis-
 sionaries to distant lands; In things social,
 through charities and foundations; in things
 economic, through aid and comfort to the
 needy  and  of licated;  in  things military,
 through lives given in defense of freedom.
 This has been the history and this has been
 the nature of our life as a people.
 Two centuries after the creative work of
 our Founding Fathers, the formidable fact is
 now emerging that these principles of indi-
 vidual freedom and individual worth can
 live and achieve universal application only
 if we join with other peoples to create larger
 political structures binding many nations in
 common purpose.
 If we fail to do this, in this mid-20th cen-
 tury, we will risk not merely national peril
 in a conventional sense; we will risk the
 death of those values that inspire the strug.
 gle for human dignity and freedom through-
 out the world.
 The task, then, is truly momentous.  It is
 nothing less than this: to match the politi-
 May ,26
 cal creativity of our forefathers by devising
 new institutions, new associations of nations,
 that can give all the world the same tangible
 hope for the realization of freedom that our
 forefathers gave to a single nation.
 In the 18th century, we succeeded as a
 people because we had a clear sense of pur-
 pose and dedication. In the 20th century we
 have not yet succeeded as a people because
 we have lacked that singleness of purpose and
 dedication-and instead we have improvised.
 In the 18th century, we, the American peo-
 ple, had an idea of man that inspired and
 governed our action and conduct as a peo-
 ple.                                                                                                                                    In the 20th century, we have too rarely,
 too  casually, related  our actions to  that
 idea-with the result that our national con-
 duct has been inspired less by our own be-
 liefs than by the threats of others.
 In the 18th century, we knew that our
 idea of man to be realized had to be trans-
 lated into concrete and specific political
 forms and institutions.  In the 20th cen-
 tury, we have tried largely to substitute mil-
 itary acts or economic acts for the vital and
 lacking political acts of creation.
 The full gravity of our position in the
 world today can be-summarized in simple
 questions.
 If it has become possible for Communists
 to twist and distort our very ideas of de-
 mocracy and freedom and justice-and to
 exploit these words as if they were their
 own-is this not plain proof that somehow
 we ourselves have failed to give these ideas
 vital and convincing expression?
 If the Communists seem forever ingeni-
 ous and inventive in promoting chaos, is not
 their apparent skill at least partly, perhaps
 largely, a reflection of our failure to promote
 order?
 If the Communists have success in waging
 political and psychological war, is not their
 success greatly due to our failure to create
 larger political structures in which freedom
 can flourish?
 If communism has an appeal to newly
 emerging peoples as a way of life bordering
 on a religion, is it not because we have
 fre   m in the 20th century with devices
 less  ld, with dedication less fervent, with
 pure     ess clear than in the 18th century.
 Whay needed to serve the dignity and
 freedf the individual in many nations
 can        be less than what was needed in
 In the     volutionary times through which
 we pass,   shall be the creators of circum-
 stance-or                                                                                                                                               e shall be its victims.  And the
 issue will     n not upon how well we can
 counter  th - thrusts  and   inventions  of
 others-but    w well we can express and
 convey our o   ',conviction.
 To carry s       conviction on the world
 scene demands    us the same two creative
 achievements o   hich the American people
 proved themselve apable two centuries ago.
 We must bind      acts as a people firmly
 to our idea of ma he free individual.
 And, working wi   other peoples and na-

 Mr.    GOLDWATER.  Mr. President,
 s        as an American rather than as
 a member of either party, I wish to com-
 pliment the junior Senator from Mon-
 tana for his constant temperance in these
 trying days.  His has been a.voice which
 has spoken out continuously for the
 proper American approach to a problem
 which involves all of us as Americans
 rather than as Democrats or Repub-
 licans.
 Mr. President, I am hopeful that in the
 coming days of the campaign the same
 restraint which has been practiced by the
 distinguished junior Senator from Mon-
 tana will be practiced by the candidates
 of both parties and by the conventions of
 both parties.
 Mr. President, this is not a political
 matter.  When the United States is
 threatened by an enemy, the American
 people solidify behind their leader.
 Mr. President, I am happy to report
 that in my travels around the United
 States since   j,detof the,U-2_plane
 I have found a great admiration and a
 great respect for the ?'resident, I find
 the Aineiican-peoSIe are solidly united
 behind him and solidly in favor of the
 program which produced the U-2 plane
 and which will produce any other system
 of espionage whereby the U.S. Govern-
 ment, its intelligence agencies and its
 military services,. can acquire intelligence
 of the intentions of and the abilities of
 the Soviets.  It is to me, Mr. President,
 as I believe it is to the majority of Amer-
 icans, this intelligence, this knowing of
 the capabilities of our enemies and the
 probable action of our enemies, which is
 the most vital thing we have confronting
 us today as an object to be achieved.
 Once again, Mr. President, I salute the
 Senator from Montana [Mr. MANSFIELD]
 for his constant temperance in the field
 of foreign relations and for his constant
 efforts to see that the best interests of
 America are served before those of his
 own party or of the party in opposition.

 with only by "reason and common-

 will hardly be dealt with by political de-
 bate which seeks to prove the relative
 degree of hardness or softness toward
 communism of presidential candidates
 of either party.  Along with the rest of
 the world we are walking too close to
 the edge of universal chaos and destruc-
 tion to support that childish game any
 longer.  We will either choose our next

 tegrity, maturity, and wisdom, or all of
 us, regardless of party, will pay the ter-

 to him speak as an American, who ex-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - S
 Senator from Tennessee, on the basis of
 the record which he made in the asking
 of questions in the Foreign Relations
 Committee, that there is ground to state
 there was not enough, perhaps, in the
 way of preparation, plans, or procedures.
 I think the record will bear out that
 statement:. from the colloquy which took
 place between the Senator from Ten-
 future, which is something we all must
 do, regardless of anything which may
 have happened in the past, He clearly
 outlined some of the steps we should
 take, including particularly his intention
 to assist the United Nations in making
 available equipment for satellite recon-
 naissance.
 I do not know what has been the ex-
 perience of other Members of this body,
 but my mail has reflected a very great
 change in the attitude of the people who
 have communicated with me over the
 period since the initial incident took
 place.  This was, of course, before the
 President made his address.  Originally
 there apparently was a feeling on the
 part of many that there had been a great
 blunder made and that this had serious-
 ly damaged our Nation.  More recently
 there has been an overwhelming indica-
 tion in the mail which I have received in
 support of the position taken by our
 Government.  Upon thoughtful reflec-
 tion, for the most part, Americans think
 this is a sound position.
 In the minds of nearly all of these
 people, the onus for scuttling the sum-
 mit conference rests solely  on  Mr.
 Khrushchev. His motives, of course, are
 not positively known but events make
 very clear that Mr. Khrushchev came to
 Paris with the fixed intention to scut-
 tle the conference and if the U-2 inci-
 dent had not been seized as a pretext,
 something else would have been.
 Like the distinguished Senator from
 Montana, I found the address of the Pres-
 ident informative, clear, and couched
 in  dignified,  nonpartisan  language.
 That same high level characterized the
 Senator's remarks  this  morning,   in
 which he joined with Americans of all
 parties in expressing the sentiments that
 we face this situation together and shall
 continue to do so, and also shall continue
 to maintain without partisan considera-
 tion those policies  of  firmness  and
 strength which alone assume a lasting
 and a just peace.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. I thank the. Sen-
 ator.
 Mr. GORE.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. MANSFIELD.. I yield to the Sen-
 ator from Tennessee.
 Mr. GORE.  Like the Senator from
 Montana, I can find, and did find, praise-
 worthy elements in President Eisen-
 hower's speech last evening.  I was glad
 to note his proposal to cooperate with
 the United Nations.  I was pleased to
 hear him say that he ravored business-
 like negotiations with the Soviet Union,
 and that these must continue.
 The lack of careful summit prepara-
 tions-the agreement to hold a summit
 conference without precise understand-
 ings as to what would be discussed, in
 what context, and what agreements were
 likely or possible to be reached-were,
 according to all of the diplomatic ex-
 perience of the United States, unbusi-
 nesslike in character.  Personal diplo-
 macy failed; summitry failed.  They
 failed in part because they were un-
 businesslike.  Would the Senator from
 Montana agree with that?
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  I would say, in
 nessee and the Secretary of State at a
 hearing before the Committee on For-
 eign Relations.
 Mr. GORE.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield further?
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  I yield.
 Mr. GORE.  As I have stated, though
 th'ei"`d''"'  r " binmendable parts, com-
 mendable elements, in the President's
 statement, I must be frank to say I did
 not think the President in the speech
 last night faced up to the extremes in
 ineptitude! which resulted, in part, in the
 worst diplomatic debacle which human
 experience affords.
 The President made general reference
 to an initial covering statement with
 ,respect to the U-,2 fight.  I ask the

 later statement by the State Department

 Tennessee has just s -id. He has always
 been frank in his co ents.  He has al-
 ways been reasonab% and constructive

 the Foreign Relatioilp  Committee.  I
 commend the Senator f m Tennessee for
