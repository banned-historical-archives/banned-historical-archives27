 Supreme Soviet Convenes 195 lid  t    martr Concern- Five-Year Plan
 Not on Agend.a    Embassy Moscow notes that the Fifth Five Year Plan is not
 scheduled for discussion at the current session of th  Supreme Soviet
 but that the annual budget for 1951 is on the agenda.         25X1
 Moscow TASS announced the "unanimous adoption00 of an agenda
 to   e discussed at the night session, 7 March, containing the following
 four points, (1) Confirmation of the State Budget,for 1951; (2) Confir-
 mation of the law on the preservation of peace;  (3) The Election of the
 Supreme Court of the USSR; (4) Confir   i   of the Decrees of the
 Presidium of the USSR Supreme Sovieto                         COMMENT:           25X1
 H. E. Salisbury, NY Times correspondent predicted that the budget would
 show a substantially lower sum both percentage-wise and in absolute
 figures than the amounts devoted to defense in the US.  Salisbury expects
 the  resentation of the Five Year Plan some time during the coming months.
 IThe item of second importance on the agenda is the
 law for the preserve     on of peace undoubtedly similar to those passed as
 a result of a WPC resolution, and now in effect in the Eastern European
 Satellites, the CPR, the Mongolian Peoples0 Republic and the GDR which
 alone provides the death penalty as punishment.  In the USSR the law may
 well result in a more severe campaign against VOA listeners

 USSR.  Soviet Remarks on UN Membership.  In the course of a conversation
 with a US delegate to the UN, Soviet Delegate. Malik, when queried about
 Stalin's interview implying Soviet intention to withdraw from the UN,
 answered that "what the General Assembly majority had done at this session
 was making the UN a different kind of organization than had been agreed
 upon at San Francisco."  In answer to the same question, Assistant
 Secretary General Zinchenko, a Soviet national, replied without hesitation
 that Stalin meant no such thing, but that a great deal had happened since
 Stalin earlier had referred to the UK as a useful "instrument of peace,"
 In a report of a public lecture in Moscow 27 Feb,
 propagandist Oleschuk is quoted as saying that "if the United Nations did
 not respond to the representations of the delegation of the World Council
 of Peace, the Soviet Union would have no alternative but to leave the
 United Nations?                              COMMENT:  The Moscow statement,
 if quoted cot#?ect y and followed by similar specific references to Soviet
 withdrawal from the UN, would represent a further development in the
 Soviet campaign to intimidate and discredit the UN and to prepare for
 possible Soviet withdrawal.  It is considered that Soviet propaganda,
 supported by a warning from Stalin himself, will soon have adequately
 prepared the Soviet people for withdrawal from the UN.
 "C"     EASTERN EUROPE.  CZECHOSLOVAKIA. Socialization of A_g ~aalture To Be
 pteAped U    According to an address delivered before the Central Com-
 mittee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party by Secretary General Rudolph
 Slansky, increased emphasis will be placed by the Party on the formation
 of agricultural cooperatives and the elimination of the kulak class during
 the coming year.  The main task of the Party would be to lay the political
 groundwork for the cooperative movement.  Slansky pointed out the danger
 of forcing farmers to join cooperatives and the necessity of using per-
 suasion.  The Party also must purge itself of deviationists in order to
 intensify the class struggle against the kulaks or village rich.  Long
 protected by Sling and Svermova, Slansky claimed, the kulaks must now
 be eliminated from the village by confiscation of their agricultural
 machinery, by increasing their delivery quotas, and by expulsion from
 the cooperatives which they have infiltrated.  Other improvements to be
 inaugurated in the cooperative movement are as follows.- (1) the intro-
 duction of a wage system based on the "labor unit", essentially a piece-
 work system; (2) simplification of the accounting system; and (3) the
 introduction of two working shifts in the Machine Tractor Stations and
 the indoctrination of the workers to become "apostles of Socialism"
 within the villages.                                     COMMENT.- The
 socialization of agriculture achieves two Important results: (1) the
 freeing of additional manpower for industry and mining, and (2) the
 elimination of an anti-regime stronghold among the wealthy landowners
 and the middle-class peasants.  The emphasis on persuasion rather than
 force indicates that the.Party recognizes the strong opposition to the
 movement on the part of the Czechoslovak farmer and wishes to avoid the
 disastrous consequences which beset the Soviet Union as a result of
 forced collectivization.

 Aa    pOI,AR'D   Development of Air Defuse Command to be Hastened. The revelation
 in the Government controlled press on 27 February that Colonel General
 Ivan Lukich Turkiel9 a high ranking Soviet Air Force Officer, is now
 Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Air Force  was reported in 0 CI Dail          25X1
 Summary
 CONiMENTo  The appointment o    r  is  w    s en the development o.  an   r
 Defense Command in Poland similar to the PVO in the USSR.  Previous informa-
 tion has indicated that the Polish Air Force is in the process        rgannilite
 zation and expansion, apparently at a more rapid rate than any other
 fricts
 Air Force.  Last fall a number of Soviet General and field grade
 air-
 Soviet j et s
 were assigned to the Polish Air Force.  In February 195e new
 planes appeared at Warsaw/Bornerowo airfield which is occupied by a Polish
 fighter interceptor unit.  No other Satellite Air Force is known to have
 received Soviet jet airplanes.  Finally, new AAA regiments are being formed
 in Poland.
 nOn         Italians 'reatened with Cud in coal Delivers?s   The Polish Government
 has approached the Italian Government and requested an additional 59000 tons
 of high grade zinc ore in ret-ern for which Poland will increase  he coal
 quota to Italy by 809000 tons.  The Italians turned the proposition
 temporarily and the Poles countered by intimating it might be difficult to
 maintain the present rate of coal deliveries to Italy..  Under the Italian-
 Polish Trade Agreement of 15 June 1949 the Polish coal quota for Italy was
 set at one million tons annually.  In the first eleven months of 1950,
 904,000 tons were delivered,  The US Embassy Rome points out that this case
 is typical of many more that will occur in the future.   While zincltisynot

 would prefer not to ship it to Eastern Europe.  However, in view of the
 increasing difficulty of obtaining adequate coal supplies, a firm refusal
 by the Italians to furnish the additional zinc ore may ultimately become
 25X1             untenable,                            COMMENTm  Poland has used similar
 tactics already against Austria and Sweden, and can be expected to do so
 in the future.
 "A"    YUGOSLAVIA.  Tito Takes Over Foreign Ministry.  The Tugoslav Government
 announced on 5 March that Marshal Tito will personally assume the post of
 Foreign Minister temporarily because of the illness of Forei   Minister
 Kardel j o                                                           !jCOMMZNT.-      25X1
 No explanation of   r e   s illness was made but a UP despatch states that
 it was reported to be a spinal ailment.  Kardelj, generally regarded as
 Number 2 man in Yugoslavia, has held the post of Foreign Minister since
 August 1948.  On February 27 Kardelj delivered a long address before the
 Yugoslav National Assembly on foreign policy, and as late as 6 March he
 was still acting as Foreign Minister (announcement was made 5 March).  On
 the evening of 6 March US Ambassador Allen had an audience with him re-
 garding a new Yugoslav request for economic assistance. It appears likely
 that Kardelj is temporarily relinquishin? his post probably to undergo an
 operation.  In view of Titoas personal popularity, however, it is possible
 that he is taking over the Foreign office in order to obtain greater sup-
 port within the Party for Yugoslavia's foreign policy as well as to
 bolster general Yugoslav morale at a critical time.
 "C"     TRIESTE.  Deal Between Italy and Yugoslavia Reported.  A Yugoslav official
 in Zone B of Trieste has passed along a report, which he himself does not
 believe, that at the forthcoming London meeting of Italian, British and
 Yugoslav officials, the Yugoslavs will agree to (1) a formal economic and
 military pact of mutual assistance with Italy, and (2) the incorporation
 of Zone B as far south as the Dragogna river into Zone A and the incor-
 poration of the rest of the Zone at a later date.  Moreover, six separate
 25X1                reports which have been received in Trieste suggest that such a do-
 ve lopment is either under consideration or already accepted by Yugoslav
 authorities,  TISPOLAD Unger states that the coincidence of so many reports
 of the same nature suggests the possibility that a settlement may be under
 way.  He further points out that the recent unofficial Italian proposal for
 the absorption of coastal towns in Zone B by Zone A may have been intended
 to prepare the ground,   He cites as possible reasons for the agreement
 Yugoslav and Italian apprehensions over a three power deal with the USSR
 in regard to Trieste at the expense of one or the other; Italian fears of
 growing independentist sentiment in Trieste and both parties' desire to
 maintain Allied troops in the area. On the other side, Unger notes the
 recent Sforza and Tito statements that the present is not a time for
 settlement, the apparent desire of  both Governments to avoid debate on
 the issue, the apparent Yugoslav C&' stand in Trieste in favor of inde-
 pendence. and the recent report of Karde  's idea of a condominium.

 of recent Yugoslav utterances and Yugoslav interests is against the
 Trieste proposal which would furnish the Cominform a gratuitous example
 of Tito's surrender to the West.   In regard to a treaty Tito has re-
 cently said that Yugoslavia has no need of formal pacts with the West
 at this time.  While Italy is clearly anxious for the return of all of
 the Tree Territory to Italian jurisdiction, the Italian Government would
 be reluctant to participate in a military assistance pact with Yugoslavia.
 Italian officials have said that the security of Yugoslavia should be a
 UN responsibility.

 "B"   JPN-    Premier Razmara Slain. Iranian Premier Razmara was assassinated
 Wednesday morning by a member of a fanatical Moslem sects  The Shah
 has requested old guard politician Khalil Fahimi, who was recently
 appointed minister without portfolio, to carry on for the time beings
 The press also reports  hat the  ro-Soviet Tudeh Party was not involved
 in the assassination.                                COMMENT: Razmara's
 -~-~
 death will have a bad psychological effect on Iran.  Despite his lack
 of success in effecting the economic and governmental reforms of which
 Iran stands in such need, he was the only man considered strong enough
 to do so.  Although he had roused. much opposition, he was respected for
 his strength.  His successor, whether he be Fahimi, who is more respected
 for the number of times he has held office than for his great ability or
 strength of charp r+f.Ar   nr by a similar member of the old guard, will
 undoubtedly be less able to cope with Iran's current internal tensions
 and problems.  Iran?s vulnerability to Soviet pressure will probably
 increase and it will be more difficult to maintain a state friendly to
 the West.
 "A"   INDIA. Speech of _Chinese Delegate to All-India Medical Students' Conference.
 According to the Peiping radio, ra delegate from the All-China Students'
 Association arrived in Madras, India, on 3 February to attend the All-India
 Medical Students' Conference.  In a speech to the Conference, the Chinese
 delegate described New China's education programs and student life.  He
 also explained the significance of his government's campaign in opposition
 to the US in Korea, and he expressed the hope that the unity of Indian
 and Chinese students would ue strengthened to consolidate the friendship
 betvreen India and China and to unite them in the common aim of world
 peace.  The Indian students responded to this speech with enthusiastic
 applause, shouting slogans such as "Lon  live Mao Tse-tung" and "Lon            25X1
 live the People's Republic of China".
 COMMENT:  The Chinese delegate was apparently not brie a  on me ica
 subjects.  In the future, the US will probably have to combat the
 influence of an increasingly large number of speeches from similar,
 politically-minded Chinese visitors to India.      ,,
 "A"          Government's Ban on an "All-India Peace Conference".  An "All- India
 Peace Conference", scheduled to meet in Delhi next April, has been banned
 by the Indian Government.  Home Minister Rajagopalachari has 'stated that
 there is no objection to the peace meeting as such, but that it may not
 be held in Delhi in view of the ban on unauthorized public meetings there.
 He further stated that it is not now in the public'interest to hold
 international meetings in India and that a peace congress, re ardless of       2 5X1
 where it was held, might be limited to Indian participants.
 COMMENT: The Home Minister's rec e  at  o  u is  inspired international conferences.
 His suggestion that he is prepared to refuse visas to foreign delegates is
 additional evidence of the strong line being taken by him against local
 Communists

 effort to definr, neutrality or to specify the extent to which the

 "C" Communist-led federation renews attack on Government strike ban,
 The Central Executive of Communist-led SOBSI (largest labor federation
 in Indonesia) issued a press statement 5 March urging the Government to
 withdraw its strike ban so that labor may have a chance in its fight against
 the attacks of foreign capital.  The statement denied that labor strikes
 cause mounting prices or imperil the Government9s position and charged
 that the Government allows foreign capital to exhaust the people's

 Association holds a plurality of 70 out of 175 seats in the Assembly.
 The Ambassador interprets the fact that recent Assembly criticism has been

 1hortage; (c) neglect of crops in battle and guerrilla-infested areas; and
 (d) direct v-ar damage to c r?ops in fields and in storage.  Despite these

 of a report that about 32,000 Koreans, including students, were assembling
 at a Tokyo Korean high school, to stage an anti-Japanese demonstration,
 approximately 1000 Japanese police were rushed to the scene to prevent.
