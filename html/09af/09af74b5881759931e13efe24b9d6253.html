 China's Independent
 Foreign Policy-
 Behind the Rhetoric
 Key Judgments  ?  . _ t China has presented its foreign-policy in a variety of ways over the past
 Information available decade for both domestic and foreign consumption. But, stripped of their

 was used in this'report 'ideological veneer, these policies have always been based on Chinese
 .
 leaders.' keen appreciation of the need to use the United States as a
 . .          counterweight to the Soviet Union.
 -Since 1982 Beijing has claimed to be pursuing. an "independent foreign
 policy." But we believe the main thrust of Chinese policy has changed little
 in practice. Chinese leaders still -regard the Soviet Union as the principal
 long-term threat to China's security and, in our view, are still interested in
 developing strategic links with the United States-albeit on a less overt
 basis than in the past. Beijing now seems to. want both to keep the Soviets
 ,guessing about the extent of US-Chinese military cooperation and to be
 able to plausibly deny that any such. ties exist.
 The Chinese readily admit in private that China and the United States are
 pursuing parallel policies in Southeast and Southwest Asia designed to
 check' Soviet expansionism. They have also told senior US officials they
 support the current US conventional buildup in the Pacific as a counter-
 -weight to the dramatic increase in Soviet naval and air power in the region
 over the past decade. Finally, over the past year Beijing has shown
 increasing interest in encouraging exchanges; between the US and Chinese
 military, and in obtaining US weapons technology. They in fact have
 already paid for site surveys for three US, weapons-related systems. In
 . doing .so, we believe they are not just seeking-help to counter Soviet
 advantages in armor and airpower but want to exploit longstanding Soviet
 concerns over possible US-Chinese military cooperation to strengthen their
 leverage in. dealing with Moscow on security. issues.
 We believe China's decision in 1981 to abandon its explicitly anti-Soviet
 "united front" approach and to adopt an, ostensibly more independent
 foreign policy, therefore, was largely- tactical. Chinese leaders were
 particularly unhappy at the time with US policy toward Taiwan, which
 .they regarded as a sign that at least some senior US officials discounted
 ' ; China's value to,the.United States.. We-believe Beijing wanted to remind
 Washington that China's alignment with the West could not be taken for
 granted and that China was: not; prepared to tolerate greater official US-
 Taiwan ties as the price for US security support.- Beijing also saw an
 ,.opportunity to reduce, tensions with Moscow, and to probe Soviet willing-
 ness to accommodate some of. China's longstanding security concerns.

 Since then Moscow has sought to woo Beijing with offers of technical
 assistance and increased trade but has not addressed the security problems
 that divide them. As a consequence, the main anti-Soviet thrust of Chinese
 foreign policy has changed little, in our view-despite attempts by Beijing
 to appear more evenhanded in its public treatment of the two superpowers
 and recent efforts to improve the atmosphere surrounding its relations with
 Moscow. China remains deeply suspicious of Soviet intentions and at least
 privately maintains that Moscow must accommodate Chinese security
 interests as a precondition for major improvements in relations.
 The change in Beijing's rhetoric, meanwhile, has given China more tactical
 flexibility in conducting its foreign policy. By emphasizing China's inde-
 pendence, Deng Xiaoping and his allies-in our view-have managed with
 varying degrees of success to:
 ? Keep Moscow engaged in a dialogue with China, both to reduce Sino-
 Soviet tensions and to increase Beijing's manuevering room in the Sino-
 US-USSR triangle.
 ? Foster a consensus on foreign policy within a leadership that holds
 conflicting views on China's relations with the two superpowers.
 ? Finesse the Taiwan issue and thus reduce the leadership's vulnerability to
 charges of not protecting Chinese interests in dealing with the United
 States.
 ? Restore China's credibility in the Third World-tarnished in Beijing's
 view by its previous close public identification with the United States-
 and ability to compete more effectively against the Soviets for influence
 in this arena.
 ? Give China greater flexibility to expand its ties to other socialist and
 Communist parties and states-especially in Eastern Europe-in order to
 encourage them to adopt a more independent course from Moscow.
 This more pragmatic tack parallels the Chinese approach to reform at
 home. As long as the Chinese see tactical advantages, we expect them to
 tout their independent policy line. There is little likelihood, therefore, of
 China's openly aligning itself again with Washington, as it did from 1979
 to 1981. With the accession of Gorbachev, we expect China instead to
 continue to probe for new flexibility in Soviet policy toward China and to
 seek ways to keep tensions with the USSR manageable. At a minimum,
 trade and economic cooperation are likely to increase-limited, however,
 by the barter nature of Sino-Soviet trading arrangements and China's
 preference for Western technology.

 Despite the recent improvement in the tone of Sino-Soviet relations, we
 doubt that the two will be able to reach a full rapprochement any time
 soon, if at all. Such a development would require both sides to make more
 far-reaching compromises on security issues than we believe they are now
 prepared to make. We doubt, moreover, that Deng and other Chinese
 leaders want to put their expanding ties with the West at risk by moving
 too far or too quickly toward better relations with Moscow.
 Should Moscow unexpectedly adopt a more flexible approach to Chinese
 security concerns, however-especially to the presence of Soviet forces in
 Mongolia-we believe Beijing would readily agree to resume the long-
 stalled border negotiations and perhaps reinstitute party-to-party contacts.
 Chinese leaders-in our view-would seek to capitalize on such an
 expanding dialogue with Moscow to buy time for China to concentrate on
 internal development and eventually to increase their leverage with both
 Moscow and Washington.

 China's Independent
 Foreign Policy-
 Behind the Rhetoric
 Origins of the Independent Line
 Before 1981 Beijing emphasized the need for a
 "united front against hegemonism" in the belief that
 US resistance to Soviet aggression needed to be
 stiffened, partly through a US defense buildup and
 partly through overt strategic cooperation between the
 United States and China. At that time, the Chinese
 perceived the Soviets as strong and aggressive and the
 United States as weak and indecisive. The Chinese
 saw the honeymoon period immediately following
 normalization of relations in 1979 as an opportunity
 to solidify the strategic relationship with the United
 States and encouraged Washington to do more
 against Moscow
 eral Secretary Hu Yaobang publicly unveiled it at the
 12th Party Congress in September 1982. Its basic
 propositions require China to:
 ? Play down strategic links with the United States in
 public while counting implicitly on the United
 States as a counterweight to the USSR.
 ? Seek a more "normal" but still fundamentally
 adversarial relationship with Moscow.
 ? Stress solidarity and cooperation with the Third
 World:
 Several factors prompted China finally to drop its
 openly anti-Soviet "united front" rhetoric in favor of
 the independent line. We believe Chinese dissatisfac-
 tion, for example, with US policies-especially
 toward Taiwan and the transfer of dual-use technol-
 ogies to China-caused Chinese leaders to question
 whether the new US administration valued China as a
 strategic asset. Chinese leaders repeatedly complained
 to US officials that US technology transfer rules
 discriminated against China (a proclaimed friend) in
 favor of India (a Soviet client).I
 Moreover, the Chinese perceived a change in the
 global balance of power that rendered a key element
 of the old united front passe. By late 1982 the United
 States had adopted a more assertive posture toward
 the Soviet Union and had taken measures to regain
 the strategic initiative in Europe and the Pacific.
 Chinese press commentators also began to stress that
 the Soviet Union was so preoccupied with a host of
 internal and foreign policy problems, such as Poland
 and Afghanistan, that it posed a less immediate threat
 to Chinese security. This has been reflected more
 recently in the Chinese media, as Beijing's spokesmen  25X1
 focus on factors favoring "world peace" rather than
 war.
 Advantages of the Independent Foreign Policy
 The new independent foreign policy line allows the
 Chinese to address a number of problems the old line
 could not. It also increases China's maneuverability
 and flexibility in meeting new situations as they arise.   25X1
 We believe the Chinese see the independence line as a
 way to increase their leverage in the strategic triangle,
 where they are the weakest element. By giving them-
 selves room to maneuver between the superpowers,
 they can attempt to assure the United States will not
 take them for granted. Beijing used talks with the
 Soviets in 1982, for example, to signal discomfort with
 US-Taiwan policy. With the resumption of US-USSR
 talks in Geneva, the Chinese probably hope that
 recent gestures to Gorbachev improving the atmo-
 spherics of Sino-Soviet relations will remind the Unit-
 ed States of China's interests in the outcome of the
 By the same token, distance from the United States
 reduces Washington's leverage over Beijing. Moves
 toward Moscow create at least the appearance of an
 alternative to strategic reliance upon the United

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/29: CIA-RDP04T00447R000200710001-4
 States, and the Chinese seem to believe that this, in
 turn, gives the United States an incentive to be more
 forthcoming on technology transfer and Taiwan.
 By shedding their "united front" rhetoric and old
 ideological polemics, moreover, the Chinese hold out
 to Moscow the prospect of more normal relations that
 allows them, at a minimum, to manage tensions in the
 relationship more effectively. Recent Chinese over-
 tures to Gorbachev, including the willingness to play
 down the "three obstacles" publicly and to refer to the
 Soviet Union as "socialist" for the first time since the
 1960s, are a logical extension of this effort. We doubt
 that the Chinese harbor any illusions about the
 Soviets going very far toward accommodating Chi-
 nese security concerns-especially in the short term.
 Moscow has too much invested in its relations with
 Vietnam to put at risk its strategic interests there-
 especially in the facilities at Cam Ranh Bay-in
 exchange for the uncertain benefits of better political
 relations with Beijing. Nor are the Soviets likely to
 give up other strategic advantages they have gained in
 the Far East by reducing, for example, their SS-20
 forces to accommodate China. The Chinese know full
 well those forces are there to counter the United
 States and Japan as well as China.
 As long as the Chinese leadership, however, can
 demonstrate its ability to manage relations with Mos-
 cow through diplomatic means, we believe it helps the
 economic reformers to deflect demands from the
 Chinese military for increased defense spending to
 close the growing qualitative gap between Soviet and
 Chinese military capabilities. China's media frequent-
 ly refer to the need to hold down defense spending to
 its present level-12 percent of the overall budget-so
 that China can concentrate first and foremost on
 modernizing the civilian economy. The current
 reform-minded leadership under Deng has long held
 the view that China's prospects of becoming a world
 power hinge on developing a strong economy.F_
 We believe the independence line also meets domestic
 political needs.
 Chinese leaders, including Ye Jianying and Li Xian-
 nian, were unhappy with China's close identification
 with the United States, symbolized by Deng's trip to
 it easier for Deng to satisfy his critics, particularly as
 he guides China toward closer military ties to the
 United States.
 By disassociating themselves from US policies the
 Chinese believe to be unpopular in the Third World,
 such as US support for Israel, the Chinese believe
 they can regain the position as a Third World leader
 they compromised when, in the late 1970s, they
 openly aligned with the United States and aggressive-
 ly pushed their Third World friends to join an anti-
 Soviet united front. As China grows increasingly
 dependent on trade and technology ties with the West,
 moreover, the rhetoric of independence probably helps
 assuage the traditional strong Chinese fear of depend-
 ency on outside powers.
 China also capitalizes on its professions of independ-
 ence and improvements in relations with Moscow to
 reestablish ties to Eastern Europe and expand its
 contacts with pro-Soviet parties in Western Europe
 and Soviet clients in the Third World such as Cuba
 and Angola. China has signed new trade agreements
 and expanded party contacts with all the East
 European states over the past two years.
 In some cases, China has reestablished contact in
 order to burnish its independent image or to undercut
 Taiwan, which still retains diplomatic relations with
 several Latin American countries. It has sought to
 induce Nicaragua, for example, to break relations
 with Taipei by offering increased trade and by criti-
 cizing US policy toward Central America
 But, by emphasizing its own independence, we believe
 China also seeks to encourage some of these states
 and parties to adopt a more independent course from
 Moscow. The Chinese publicly hold up Romania and
 Yugoslavia as countries pursuing "independent poli-
 cies" and privately point to some of the Warsaw Pact

 states, such as East Germany, as beginning cautiously
 to exercise more autonomy. We know from authorita-
 tive Soviet media comments that Moscow is well
 aware of Chinese motives and is closely monitoring
 and trying to control the expansion of East European
 contacts with Beijing.
 Independence in Practice
 Initial concern that the new independent foreign
 policy foreshadowed a shift toward a genuinely inde-
 pendent, evenhanded Chinese approach to the super-
 powers has, in our judgment, not been borne out by
 events. Beijing still sees itself locked in an adversarial
 relationship with Moscow and, by supporting insur-
 gent groups fighting against Soviet troops in Afghani-
 stan and Vietnamese forces in Cambodia, is actively
 opposing Soviet efforts to make inroads around
 China's periphery . Chinese leaders, moreover, have
 repeatedly expressed private support to US officials
 for the US conventional military buildup in the
 Pacific designed to counter the dramatic increase over
 the past decade in the Soviet military presence,
 especially air and naval forces, in the Far East
 Moscow's continued refusal to address any of China's
 principal security concerns has, in effect, left Beijing
 no choice but to continue to rely tacitly on the United
 States as a strategic counterweight. Despite their
 occasional denials, we believe the Chinese are very
 worried not only about the relentless Soviet buildup of
 strategic theater forces (SS-20s and Backfire bomb-
 ers) in the Far East but also by the pace of moderniza-
 tion of Soviet conventional forces along their border.
 China cannot afford to match the Soviets, nor does it
 have the technological know-how yet to develop the
 sophisticated weaponry it needs to counter the latest
 Soviet systems. The Chinese privately admit to US
 officials that they feel particularly vulnerable to
 Soviet armor and airpower
 Even if China succeeds in acquiring the weapons
 technology that it wants from the United States and
 Western Europe, it is our judgment that it would take
 the Chinese years to produce and absorb such weap-
 ons in sufficient numbers to make a difference. That
 places a premium, in our view, on China relying in the
 meantime on political means to handle any Soviet
 attempts at military and political intimidation. Re-
 ducing tensions with Moscow is one way. But by
 seeking to develop an arms relationship with the
 United States-which Moscow is likely to see as
 having strategic overtones-we believe the Chinese
 want to signal the Soviets that they are not isolated
 and susceptible to pressure.
 We believe China's military pressure on Vietnam, in
 turn, is intended in part to demonstrate to Washing-   25X1
 ton and the ASEAN states that it can and does play a
 useful role in attempting to contain Soviet expansion-
 ism. But more important, it also sends a message to
 Moscow that China will not be intimidated. Last year,
 for example, a joint Soviet-Vietnamese amphibious
 exercise in the Tonkin Gulf provoked China to seize
 some Vietnamese territory and conduct an amphibi-
 ous exercise of its own, leading to the last minute
 postponement of a long-awaited, high-level Soviet
 visit to China. This year, by contrast, the varying
 degrees of Chinese military pressure on Hanoi are
 without fanfare or Beijing's public discussion of
 Soviet support for the Vietnamese. This restraint fits
 into a broader pattern suggesting a Chinese willing-
 ness to improve relations with the USSR as long as     25X1
 the Soviets avoid confronting China on basic security
 issues. 25X1
 The Sino-Soviet talks over the past two years have led
 to some lessening of tensions and increased trade and
 cultural exchanges. But even in the economic sphere,
 the Soviets are at a distinct disadvantage in compet-
 ing with the West. Although Sino-Soviet trade has
 steadily increased over the past few years, it remains
 only a small fraction of China's overall foreign
 trade-about 2 percent in 1984
 Beijing has been much more aggressive in seeking
 Western technology and wooing Western companies
 to invest in China. Since last November, for example,
 China has signed contracts worth more than $11
 billion with Western firms for major development
 projects under the Seventh Five-Year Plan (1986-90).
 Direct foreign investment in China nearly doubled to
 $4 billion by the end of 1984. By contrast, the Chinese
 are still talking to the Soviets about renovating a
 handful of Soviet-equipped plants built in the 1950s.

 Chinese requests for advanced US technology, more-
 over, have risen dramatically since Washington liber-
 alized its technology transfer policy in mid-1983. The
 total value of high-technology export licenses ap-
 proved by the United States for China in 1984 rose to
 at least $1.5 billion-more than the total amount of
 trade between China and the USSR for the same
 year.
 While maintaining and expanding ties, including mili-
 tary, with the United States, China has not and will
 not shy from vocally criticizing US policy. We expect
 China will continue to criticize US foreign policy
 largely in areas where China has little strategic
 interest, indulging in a form of name calling. The
 Chinese have been most sharp in their commentary on
 US policy in southern Africa, Central America, and
 the Middle East.
 We expect the Chinese to be especially vocal when
 they believe US policy is counterproductive and
 harms the anti-Soviet effort. These include arms
 control in Europe, where the Chinese think the US
 position on theater nuclear forces plays into the hands
 of neutralists
 We expect the Taiwan issue will remain on the back
 burner unless the Chinese perceive new US efforts to
 raise the level of officialdom in dealings with the
 island or to increase the quality and quantity of arms
 sold to Taipei beyond the limits set out in the Sino-US
 communique of 17 August 1982. Beijing will continue
 to raise the issue with visitors in a pro forma fashion,
 but we believe the Chinese are not likely to try to turn
 US policy toward Taiwan into a test of the US-
 Chinese relationship any time soon
 Potential for Fundamental Change
 Given the advantages the Chinese believe they derive
 from posing as independent and nonaligned, we expect
 them to hew to their current line. But China might, in
 our opinion, reevaluate its strategic position and possi-
 bly produce fundamental changes in its foreign policy
 if:
 then began to cut back forces in areas of importance
 to the Chinese, particularly in Mongolia where the
 Soviets have five divisions.
 ? The United States moved toward detente with the
 USSR and reached an accord on arms control that
 Beijing believed seriously compromised Chinese
 security.
 ? The United States accorded Taiwan greater official
 status and/or increased arms sales to-Taipei.
 ? The succession to Deng brought to power a 'more
 xenophobic government committed to a tougher
 stand on Taiwan or a more genuinely independent
 foreign policy posture.
 ? China's economic development program, including
 the opening to the West, failed, especially if caused
 by protectionism in the markets China is banking on
 for future economic growth.
 None of these cases is highly likely and certainly
 would not come about overnight. Moscow, for exam-
 ple, has refused to offer even modest concession to
 Beijing, believing-probably correctly-that such
 concessions would only whet China's appetite. To
 withdraw from Afghanistan, or reduce aid to Viet-
 nam, or reduce forces in Mongolia or elsewhere along
 the Sino-Soviet border as the Chinese demand, more-
 over, would run directly counter to Soviet efforts to
 establish a position of military dominance in Asia and
 the Pacific. While Moscow may be prepared to make
 some conciliatory gestures, we do not believe Soviet
 leaders are prepared to give up these strategic gains in
 exchange for the uncertain advantages of improving
 relations with China. Soviet officials in fact have
 indicated privately that they regard China as simply
 trying to play off the superpowers against each other,
 hoping to trigger a bidding contest between Moscow
 and Washington for Beijing's favor-a game they'
 have made clear they will not play.
 There is room, however, for manipulation of the Sino-
 Soviet relationship short of resolving their fundamen-
 tal security issues. Upon Gorbachev's selection as the
 new Soviet party leader, for example, the Chinese
 ? Moscow agreed to accommodate key Chinese secu-
 rity concerns by slowing down its deployment of new
 weapons and forces on the Sino-Soviet border, and

 he two sides will increase the frequency and
 raise the level of official exchanges, with both capitals
 presumably seeing tactical advantages to be gained in
 their relations with Washington. Foreign Ministers
 Wu and Gromyko will probably meet this summer,
 and a meeting of Chinese and Soviet premiers could
 eventually occur.

 power, they would-face the same sobering options of
 seeking to maintain some kind of strategic relation-

 selves to. Soviet dominance. In short, China's military
 weaknesses vis-a-vis the Soviet Union would impose
 serious constraints on whomever was in power in     25X1
 Beijing.
 A US-Soviet arms accord that undermined China's
 own deterrent capability probably would strain Sino-
 US relations. Beijing, for example, made it very clear
 two years ago that it opposed any agreement on
 intermediate-range ballistic missiles that would allow
 the Soviets to transfer their SS-20s deployed in the
 European theater to the Far East. China is also
 beginning to show serious concern about the Strategic
 Defense Initiative, fearing that if the ABM Treaty is
 abandoned Moscow will boost its antimissile defenses
 to the point where it could neutralize China's limited
 but-from its point of view-extremely valuable
 nuclear deterrence.
 If the United States reversed its policy toward Taiwan
 by granting it greater official status or agreeing to sell
 the island advanced weaponry that violated the -1982
 August communique, US relations with China would
 be seriously damaged. At a minimum, we believe the
 Chinese would suspend any developing security dia-
 logue and probably threaten, at least, to downgrade
 relations as they did in 1981. They also probably
 would suspend any arms purchases and pull whatever
 diplomatic and economic levers at their disposal to
 change US policy.
 It is more difficult to predict what impact a change in
 leadership could have on foreign policy. The present
 policy clearly bears the stamp of Deng Xiaoping. If
 his chief lieutenants-Hu Yaobang and Zhao
 Ziyang-became locked in a power struggle with
 others over the succession, it is conceivable that they
 might try to shore up their domestic position by
 adopting a tougher stand on Taiwan that adversely
 affected both security cooperation and economic rela-
 tions with the United States. In doing so, however,
 Were the leadership's economic reform program, in-
 cluding the opening to the West, to collapse, for
 whatever reason, the conservatives who favor a return
 to more Stalinist economic policies would be in a
 strengthened position. This in turn would weaken the
 pull toward interdependence that Western markets
 and technology now exercise on Chinese foreign
 policy. Although the strategic imperatives that still
 largely drive US-Chinese relations would remain, the
 reformists-assuming they remained in power-
 would be forced to operate under greater fiscal and,
 presumably, political constraints. That would at a
 minimum inhibit their ability to pursue further mili-
 tary cooperation and an expanded arms relationship
 with the United States.
 Outlook
 We believe Beijing's adherence to a pragmatic,
 nationalistic foreign policy is likely to endure for some
 time and certainly as long as the present reform-
 minded leadership retains power. Paradoxically,
 China's foreign policy has remained remarkably con-
 sistent over the past 15 years. Even for periods of
 strong leftist influence during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, Chinese foreign policy was colored by a strong
 anti-Soviet hue and marked by a tendency to look to
 the United States as the only worthwhile counter-
 weight to the security threat posed by the USSR. The
 present policy has the virtues of enjoying a broad base
 of support among Chinese leaders of various ideologi-
 cal stripes and of giving Beijing greater tactical
 flexibility in conducting its relations with both super-
 powers that we believe any Chinese leader probably
 would try to capitalize on.

 In practice, this means that the Chinese will probably
 continue to pursue close economic and political ties to
 the West in order to obtain advanced Western tech-
 nology and capital investment and to ensure greater
 access to Western markets for their exports as long as
 these policies continue to produce results. We expect
 them also to move ahead, but more cautiously, in
 expanding US-Chinese military cooperation. They
 will probably remain wary, however, of making com-
 mitments on security cooperation against the Soviet
 Union and will be sensitive to international percep-
 tions on this score.
 In any event, we think there is little likelihood of
 China openly aligning itself again with Washington,
 as it did from 1979 to 1981. Instead, we expect it to
 continue to play down the nature and extent of
 whatever security cooperation develops. The Chinese
 also will probably continue to probe for changes in
 Soviet policy toward China now that Gorbachev has
 assumed power and seek ways to reduce tensions with
 the USSR, as long as they do not have to sacrifice
 anything of importance or kowtow to Soviet bluster.
 Trade and economic cooperation should, therefore,
 increase-limited, however, by the barter nature of
 the trading arrangements and China's preference for
 Western technology. We cannot rule out the possibili-
 ty, moreover, that Beijing might agree to resume the
 long-stalled border negotiations. In maintaining and
 expanding the dialogue with Moscow, Chinese leaders
 probably would rationalize such a tack as buying
 valuable time for China to concentrate on internal
