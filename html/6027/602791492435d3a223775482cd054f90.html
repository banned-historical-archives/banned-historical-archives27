 SECTION 1 (SOVIET)
 1.  USSR.  Austrian Personnel in Soviet Occupation Forces dismissed:  The
 dismissal of indigenous personnel employed as servants at Soviet instal-
 lations in Austria continues,  The vacancies are being filled by an un-
 known number of Russian women who recently arrived from the USSR.                         Sev-
 eral local rumors predict that the Soviet Occupation Force will dismiss
 all non-Communists employed in military installations., but there has been
 no indication that large-scale dismissals are intended.
 A field comment notes that a small-scale arrival of Russian char
 women has been in progress for several months in Austria,. primarily for
 use in officer clubs and messes.  Indigenous personnel continue working
 in Soviet Ordnance camps and warehouses.
 Comments  Apparently, as a security measure, the same type of re-
 placement has taken place in the Soviet Occupation Forces of East Germany.
 The German dismissals have been on a larger scale and have included a
 broader category of personnel at military installations.  It may be as-
 sumed that a similar development is in progress in Austria.
 2.   INTERNATIONAL COMMUNISM.  Communists again advocate modified neutralism:
 Pravda, on 3 October published an article by Pierre Cot, editor of the
 World Peace Council magazine In the Defense of Peace which the US Moscow
 Embassy feels is one of the most important of such statements in some
 time.  After painting a dark picture of the worsening conditions between
 the two camps into which the world  as become divided, Cot called at-
 tention to the many differences existing among nations in the "war camp"
 Weste
 25X1
 He alleged Western governments faced adverse public opinion in
 their own countries due to uneasiiess about Korea and fear of US domin-
 ation of world trade.  He urged the World Peace Council and national
 peace committees to use these conflicts by whatever method suited their
 particular country in order to impede agreement in the West.  He stated
 that, while the WPC cannot recommend the passive forms of neutralism or
 religious pacificism which the fight against war takes on in some coun-
 tries, it can. still act jointly with the local peace committees if a
 foreign policy based on neutralism could ru ture the war coalition and
 "return the UN to its original role."
 25X1
 Comments   The Communists alternate between condemning neutral-
 ism and advocating it as a disruptive device under certain conditions.

 3.       World Federation of Trade Unions Conference:  The East Berlin con-
 ference of the Communist World Federation of Trade Unions, 13 - 21 Nov-
 ember, is expected to present an important decision which will strength-
 en the unity and action of the group according to the East German labor
 federation's newspaper, Tribulene.  Main subjects to be discussed con-
 cern results of capitalist war preparations  deterioration of workersu
 living standards, and colonial problems,                                       25X1
 Comment:  This will be the first general meeting of the WFTU since
 its Second World Congress in 1949 at Milan. During this interval WFTU
 strength in the West has been weakened by the withdrawal of many unions,
 The East German labor union announced that representatives from 64 coun-
 tries will "make vital decisions upon the preservation and consolidation
 of peace" - an indication that Germanyes participation in Western de-
 fense will receive special attention,
 4.       CZECHOSLOVAKIA,  New propaganda angle on Oatis:  The Prague radio is
 now alleging that the US is exploiting the Oatis case "for an even
 sharper campaign against Czechoslovakia,"  A recent broadcast stated
 that Secretary Acheson had told both American and West European press
 correspondents to "blow up the Oatis case in every possible way until
 the General Assembly opens in Paris on 6 November,"  This reportedly
 is part of the US propaganda campaign against the possible candidacy of
 Czechoslovakia a  a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council.
 5.         Two-policemen murdered:  The US Army Attache in Prague has re-
 ceived information about the murder of two uniformed police (SNB  in a
 city near Prague on 1 October,  The attaches                               25X1
 also quoted a Czech              on stating that the commander of the
 troops in that city knew nothing of what was going on in the present
 day army, that organization., training and future planning is "in chaos
 at all levels.," and that Minister of Nat onal Defense Cepicka is despised
 at, all levels,
 Comment:  No confirmatory information is available for the above
 report,  Moreover, other evidence would indicate that this situation
 is not general throughout the Czech army,

 Comment:  Since 1949 reports from Brussels have indicated the Czech
 Legationas interest in procuring military and economic information on
 Belgium through questionnaires distributed to  s~E?i pr!toA  ~o?~.~ ?a+ , -. ,
 lea sue countiry,  in August j                         ireported that    25X1
 between 1948 and 1951 there had been uncovered certain continuing manifes-
 tations of Czech interest in the Rhine Valley, including detailed ques-
 tionnaires on specific information and maps of bridges, banks, industry,
 communications, US bridge exercises, etc.  A 1951 questionnaire was par-
 ticularly noteworthy for its clearly offensive nature since it sought in-
 formation on which sectors of the Rhine could be inundated, easily defen-
 dable bridges  possibilities of bivouac, docking facilities, etc.  The
 25X1 C                       pointed out that among the Satellites, the Czechs alone had
 shown curiosity of this sort.  No indications of Soviet offensive inten-
 tions have been uncovered through their questionnaire in which political
 and economic matters predominate.

 7.  1UNGARY,    Slavs utilized in anti-Tito propaganda:  At the recent celebra-
 tion of International Peace Day in Budapest, one of the principal events
 was a speech by a South Slav peasant comparing the happy life of the Hun-
 garian Slav minority with deplorable conditions in Yugoslavia.                           In the
 name of the South Slave he sent a message to the Yugoslav "brothers" to
 "fight against Tito."  The US Legation in Budapest reported that increas-
 ing use is b                       zarian South Slave to carry on anti-Tito
 propaganda.
 Comment:  South Slave have not been used in recent months to carry
 on the verbal battle against Tito.

 not yet ready to liquidate the kulaks.  It could ha

 Comment:  There have been numerous indications since the end of the
 harvest that an intensive campaign is underway to increase the number of
 cooperatives.  It does not appear, however, that the government is pre-
 pared to undertake full scale collectivization this fall,

 charged that the Cominform_has employed 1,932 Yugoslav citizens and 7,930
 "White Guards" for espionage purposes.  The Premier alleged that the Sov-
 iets had founded a network of 98 spy.centers in the Cominform countries
 (including 35 in the USSR and 12 in Czechoslovakia) whose function was to
 send "diversionists hourly across the borders into Yugoslavia."  Although
 he claimed that Bulgaria has employed more agents than any of the other
 satellites, Tito stressed the point that Dimitrov had refused to en a
 Yugoslavs as agents prior to the Cominform resolution.
 Comments  Minister of Interior Rankovic stated in June that since
 the Cominform break in 1948, 8,403 Cominformists had been arrested.
 TitoJs figure of 98 spy centers in the Cominform countries represents a
 considerably larger number than previously estimated.  Early this year
 the Yugoslav radio stated that over 20 00centers for sabotage" were located
 in the Satellite countries on Yugoslavia.0s periphery. While over 90 Como
 inform subversive camps have been reported to exist in the neighboring
 satellites, fairly reliable information is held on less than 20 of them.
 10.        Recent Y  oslav de ortees to Bul aria ma  have been Cominformistss
 Ambassador Allen believes that a large number of the recent Yugoslav to Bulgaria, among whom were several dentists, enginers, anddem
 professors, may have had Cominform connections.  One of the deportees
 was a former MVD officer in Germany and Poland who had remained in Yugo-
 slavia following the Cominform break by playing down his Cominform con-
 nections.  Another was his wife who formerly was the secretary of Major
 General Pero Popivoda, a former Yugoslav Communist Party member and now
 the leader of the Yugoslav Cominfo-rmists in Rumania.  The Ambassador
 cites as additional evidence the manner in which the
 in Bulgaria and the lack of subsequent Bulgarian  ublicity was received
 The Ams-
 ador hopes to verify a rumor circulating among White Russians i
 n Belg ad
 that the UDB chief in Belgrade has been arrested for his             grade
 in deporting the group to Bulgaria.                                 ability
 Comments  Although there is little doubt that some of the deportees
 were not Cominformists, the circumstances surrounding the incident, in-
 cluding the apparent foreknowledge and cooperation of Bulgarian auth-
 orities, suggest that the group may have been deported to Bulgaria in
 exchange for Yugoslav citizens.

 SECTION 2 (EASTERN)
 1, IRAN. Iranian Prime Minister desires to avoid Security Council con-
 sideration of oildis utea                                    Prime Minister Mossadeq prefers to settle the
 British- ranian oil dispute by prior negotiations and to avoid Security
 Council action.  Mossadeq expressed this sentiment in an interview with
 Assistant Secretary of State McGhee and US United Nations delegates, and
 added that the strong statement which he must make in the Security Council
 would preclude successful negotiations,  Therefore he'su  este  a dela
 ?x'da s during which an agreement could be sought,
 Comments There is no reason to assume that Mossadeq is willing to
 negot a e- on terms more favorable to the British than those previously
 offered*  Resumption of negotiations,, however9,might avoid the dilemma
 of an Iranian refusal to comply with a UN recommendation. The USSR
 would similarity'not be given the opportunity of posing in the UN as the
 champion of Iran,
 2.  BURL. Burmese officials cool in di lomatic dealings with Chinese Communists;
 Prime Mm n stet Thakin Nu, refused to attend a mass rally celebrating the
 Chinese Communist Government's second anniversary, although he was strongly
 urged to do so as a "calming influence" to prevent possible "disturbances."
 He attended a reception at the Chinese Embassy with other high Government
 officials, but they all significantly left before the showing of a Communist
 movie,
 Meanwhile, the new Burmese Ambassador to Peiping is reliably reported
 to have refused to present his credentials to the Chinese Vice Minister
 of Foreign Affairs, and to have threatened to return to Burma unless
 granted an audience with. Mao Tse-tung,  Despite the intervention of the
 Soviet Ambassador the Burmese diplomat remained adamant with the complete
 Of his 'Go ernment  and the Chinese finally acceded to his desire.
 Comment& In addition to these indications of a stiffening Burmese
 attituce towards the Chinese, Thakin Nu in a recent parliamentary speech,
 obviously referring to China, stated that if Burma were to be invaded it
 would fight the aggressor along with the "many countries which hate injus-
 tiee"                        Nevertheless, the Burmese, by and large, still refuse to face
 squarely the threat of Chinese Communist intervention in their affairs,
 This report also tends strongly to refute information that the Burmese
 Ambassador intends to invite Chinese Communist troops to enter Burma to
 eliminate Chinese Nationalist forces.

 expulsion of Chinese Nationalist troops, and the insurance of "full
 democratic rights" for the Burmese People.  He added that the BWPP was
 prepared to cooperate with any other political organization, including
 the Anti_Fascist Peoples Freedom League which controls the Government.
 The US Embassy in Rangoon believes that this statement provides the
 framework for the formation of an above round united front dominated
 by the BWPP.
 Comment:  This relatively mild statement regarding BWPP aims con-
 trasts sharply with the greetings sent to Communist China on 1 October
 by the former's labor organization which denounced the "bloodthirsty and
 warlike reactionary Americans who 61re aiding the reactionary rulers of
 Burma in constructing military bases in Burma?"
 The BWPP has long been suspected of having an intention to develop
 an anti-Government coalition which would parallel the Burma Communist
 Party's strategy of establishing an underground "Peoples Democratic
 Frontes made up of the various insurgents.
 4.           Karens threaten to Join Communists:  The US Embassy in Rangoon has
 received a letter from an unspecified Karen "delegation" which stated that
 the Karens would join the Communists unless the US and UK supplied them
 with arms.  The Embassy believes that this incident reflects "des eration
 coupled with i creased Communist influence" among the Karens.
 Comment:  There is no, doubt that the Karen position has become pro-
 gressively more desperate.  The failure of the West to do anything what-
 soever in their behalf has no doubt been a keen disappointment which
 probably has gradually turned to resentment.  Since the Karens do not
 expect the Burmese Government to offer a satisfactory solution to the
 struggle, they probably have become increasingly receptive to Communist
 propaganda.  Wholehearted Karen-Communist collaboration would be
 disastrous for the relatively pro-Western Government now in power;
 Burmese to ti hten controls on tire shi meats to China: have stated that the Government will discontinuetheRissuan emcee
 of import-transit licenses for tires.  They indicated, however, that out-
 standing licenses would be honored.  After reiterating the Burmese conten-
 tion that the US should control the transit trade through Burma by stopping
 pping
 at their source, these officials indicated that the cabinet
 was about to consider the entire problem of the shipment of tires to China.
 The US Embassy in Rangoon comments that the current interest in controlling
 the traffic in tires stems from a desire to insure the approval of US
 exports against rec-n+~y ?ssued li
 censes  for the import of goods from
 the dollar area o

 6.     BUi.MA CHINA,  Burmese intercede for Americans:  The Burmese Ambassador to
 Peiping recently joined several other chiefs of mission in calling the
 attention of the Soviet Ambassador to the harsh treatment being accorded
 American citizens in China.  The Russian claimed to have raised the
 question with the Chinese Foreign Minister who stated he "would give
 the matter consideration."   The Burmese Ambassador also reported that the
 various embassies had agreed to approach the Chinese Foreign Minister
 dividuall  on the matter as opportunities presented themselves,

 Comment:  There is no evidence to date that any of these representa-
 tions., including those of the Soviet Ambassador, have altered Peiping's
 policy toward US nationals.
 MALAYA.  Reaction to murder of Mala a~ ? s High Commissioner:  The US Consul
 General in Singapore concludes that the murder of High Commissioner Gurney
 on 6 October will probably convince the notoriously noncommittal Chinese
 population of Malaya that cooperation with the British is dangerous policy.
 The US representative also transmits the unofficial views of the
 office of the Commissioner General for Southeast Asia that the incident
 will arouse the British Government to a greater awareness of the serious
 Malayan situation be a strong boost to bandit morale, increase dissatis-
 faction with security operations, and possibly call for substitution of
 stiffer measures.

 8.  THAILAND.  Verdict given in regicide case:  The Thai criminal court,
 after more than two years,  acquitted two of the three persons charged
 with complicity in the death of the late King and sentenced the third
 to death.  The prisoner is reported to be preparing an appeal1in which
 case the matter "can drag on another few years."  The US Embassy in
 Bangkok observes that the verdict is politically useful to the Phibun
 regime:  it can be used to discredit Pr.idi, with whom the prosecution
 associated the defendents, and it can be held u  as fulfillment of
 Phibun?s premise to solve the cased

 states that there is a "bureaucratic struggle" for funds and privileges
 among the Party, the government, and the armed forces, with the Party ap-
 parently in the "weakest position."               states that the govern-
 ment "has the advantage of controlling funds,                         while the army has the
 "historic advantage of having been once virtually identical with the Party
 and the government."  The military leaders regard the government as "es-
 sentially their own-creatureH and have adoped a "rather independent"-line
 with the political cadres.               observes that, although directives
 flow from the Politburo, Party off ic a s have been told to act on govern-
 ment directives, Army directives and editorials of the  Party press without
 waiting for explicit Party' directives..
 Comments  It is believed that this account is out of date.  The Party
 controls The government absolutely, and appears to have effective control
 over the armed forces.  All important leaders of both the government and
 the armed forces are members of the Party's Central Committee.  Directives
 on major matters
 origins a solely with the Politburo; government and army
 directives, and the editorials of the Party press, of course transmit the
 will of the Politburo and have not been observed at any time to take an

 ship was obviously acquired by fiat, possibly in order to claim achieve-
 mentof Peipinggs 1951 goal of 20 million SSFA members.  Peiping radio
 last month, while citing 16 million SSFA members, admitted that the Chi-
 nese people remain apathetic to the Association and its program.  Peiping
 may next turn its attention to government employees, and so on to other
 groups, until the USSR has more official friends in China than it has
 citizens of its own.
 130     S ecial Sinkiang currency abolishedo  The Chinese Communists have
 announced that beginning on 1 October 1951, Sinkiang notes will be redeemed
 and the regular Chinese currency will be circulated throughout the pro-
 vinoe.  Uighurian language characters will be printed on the currency for
 .Sinkiang circulation, but currency without Uighurian characters may also be
 circulated.  The Chinese currency is to be the standard legal tender in the
 province  and all business transactions are to be in terms of that curren-
 Comments  One aspect of the special status of China9s border areas as
 spheres of Soviet influence has been the special currency systems of those
 areas.  In the past year, however, the Chinese Communists have sought to
 promote the economic integration of the border areas with the rest of China
 by currency unification.  In the summer of 1950, the special Port Arthur-
 Dairen currency was abolished.  The Manchurian and Inner Mongolian cur-
 rencies were reoaa.led in the spring of 1951-  With the redemption of the
 Sinkiang notes, the circulation of Chinese currency will extend to all the
 areas bordering on the USSR.
 tionsi  Reacting to the latest Communist offer to resume negotiations a
 KOREAO  South Korean reaction to latest Communist offer to resume ne otia-
 Panmunjon with an extension of the neutral zone to Munsan, ROK Foreign Min-
 ister Pyun stated that extension of the neutral zone'is "fraught with
 dangers lethal to the UN strategic position in Korea."  He argued that ex-
 tending the neutral zone across the Imjin River into Munsan would give the
 Communists a foothold across that strategic river.  Pyun asserted that "it
 is high time" for the Communists to be presented with an ultimatum on the
 conferences.
 Comments  It is generally believed that the Communist proposal to ex-
 tend the neutral zone is equally unpalatable to the UN command.  This of-
 ficial ROK statement is merely another attempt to discourage further cease-
 fire efforts on the part of the UN.

 1.   GERMANY.  Retail stores in East Germany cut prices:  Effective 8 October,
 the East German Government cut prices on certain foods, textiles, and
 industrial wares, and removed marmalade, soap, and textiles made from
 cellulose from the ration list.     US officials in Berlin estimate that these
 reductions will cause West Berliners to increase their purchases in East
 Berlin.
 Comment:.  West Berliners find that they can buy more with their West
 marks in East Berlin.  Although the West Berlin Government realizes that this
 practice is injurious to West Berlin's economy, efforts to control it have
 met with little success.

 whatever is considered by the Embassy as "perhaps the most outstanding
 feature of public opinion development."  _
 Should the USSR demonstrate, however, that it is prepared to make real
 concessions in its campaign for German "unity." French public opinion
 "would be very profoundly affected."
 Comment:  US officials in Berlin recently warned that the East German
 "unity'1 campaign might lead France to reconsider its German policy,  It is
 unlikely, however, that the defense plan will be abandoned by the French
 Government under any foreseeable international circumstances, inasmuch as
 this plan is an essential phase of the integration of Europe.  The French
 are increasingly inclined to view such integration as attainable.

 AUSTRIA.  Communist pamphlet attributes atrocities to US soldiers in Korea:
 Vienna's Communis  bookstores now offer  or p-05116 consume ion a  urn.  s ory
 of American "atrocities" in the Korean conflict.  The pamphlet, prepared
 by the Austrian member of a 17 woman delegation sent to North Korea last
 May by the World Federation of Democratic Women, is entitled "An Eyewitness
 Account of the Modern War of Destruction."  Four pages of the report are
 devoted to reproduction of "original" documents, reputedly convicting South
 Korean and American "politicians" of.initiating a war of aggression against
 the North Koreans.  The remainder of the pamphlet is devoted to an
 imaginative account of crimes attributed to Americans or to South Koreans
 acting under US orders, such as bacteriological warfare, the use of various
 instruments of torture, and the usual acts associated with brutal and ill-
 disciplined soldiery.  The author is supplementing her writte  report on
 Korea with a series of lectures,                                                    25X1
 Comment   US officials in Vienna discount the effectiveness of the
 pamphlet's i lustrations, but indicate that the text is clever.  The circu-
 lation appears to be very limited at present.  The non-Communist press has
 ignored the publication.
 Similar reports have been submitted in other countries represented
 by the delegation, and have been recognized as the end results for which
 the World Federation of Democratic Women engineered the trip to Korea.
 5e            Austrian press surveys consequences of prospective ERP cuts:
 Vienna's leading newspapers continue their gloomy analysis o  t e conse-
 quences of the anticipated reduction of about 709000,000 dollars in external
 assistance to Austria for the coming year.  Attributing Austria's economic
 plight to the rise in world prices following the Korean crisis, there is
 general agreement that further gains in living standards and the achievement
 of economic independence by 1952 are now precluded.  Surveying the prospects

 of an Austrian solution within the framework of declining foreign aid, most
 editorials emphasize the necessity of increased productivity, an expanded
 export program, and strict austerity in the matter of imports.  A People's
 Party paper calls for all-out mobilization of the country as a prerequisite
 to meeting the crisis.  A right-wing., independent newspaper vigorously
 criticizes the coalition government for creating an economic climate un-
 favorable to the obtaining of external credits to     ensate for the
 diminution in foreign aid.
 Comment:  The proposed reduction in ECA allocations has caused con-
 siderable rd,ismay among the Austrian public.  The semi-official press has
 suggested that US authorities were unaware of Austria's special position.,
 and the recent invitation for a delegation from Congress to visit Austria
 suggests a new plea for an "understanding" of Austria's peculiar problems.
 Though the Austrian press is'taking an uncommonly realistic view of the
 alternatives to foreign aid., its suggested remedies are those which ECA has
 been urging upon the Austrian Government for some time.
 6.     NETHERLANDS.  Government's proposed economic controls may still labor
 cr mac sma:  Ir# view of interna Iona  economic  evelopmen s stemming  rom
 rearmament, the Dutch Government has introduced a bill to enable it to
 control trade in a number of metal and chemical products, in effect a
 reintroduction of some of the clauses of the 1939 vital materials distri-
 bution act.                          the Government also plans to introduce a bill to ban hoarding
 and profiteering.  These proposed laws would enable the Government "to keep
 an effective eye on prices in general," and on trade in critical raw
 materials in particular.
 Comment:  Passage and enforcement of these measures may serve to quiet
 the criticism of labor that it is shouldering a disproportionate share of
 the defense burden.

 8.           Communists plan strikes and land seizures this fall:  Recent intense
 activity in  he Communist Party and in  ommunist-dominated labor unions has
 stimulated rumors of nation-wide agitation and strikes to be carried out this
 fall,  The opening of parliamentary debate on the controversial labor law
 will be the signal for this agitation,  The Communist Youth Federation has
 given its support to a plan for land accu titian in the Rome area to be
 carried out at the same time.
 Comment:  The Communists obviously hope to use the issue of restrictive
 labor  egis ation, scheduled for parliamentary discussion in the near future
 and vigorously opposed by all labor organizations, to win the support of
 the anti-Communist trade unions for their strike program;  Prospects for
 success are fairly good in regard to strikes on purely economic issues.
 All unions supported the 19 September strike of state employees for higher
 wages. However, illegal land seizures, in which the Communist Youth
 Federation has actively participated in Central Italy, are opposed by the
 anti-Communist unions.

 in late September the
 Lisbon government instructed the Macao authorities that an embargo on the
 shipment of milita   supplies to Communist areas was to go into effect on
 1 October.                                 on 26 September the avowedly anti-
 Communist Macao chief of police prevented the transfer of eight aircraft

 12,   CENTRAL AMERICA.  Comment on the Conference of Central American Foreign
 1 nisters:  At the "First Cenral American Conference of Foreign Ministers"
 which opened Monday in El Salvador, the five Central American republics
 will attempt to revive some of the aspects of the single state of which
 they were all once members.  The conference was called at the initiative
 of El Salvador which has long coveted the role of prime mover in a Central
 American bloc.
 Announced on the joint Central American Independence Day, 15 September,
 which followed by a few days a conference of Central American chambers of
 commerce, the conference is described by the Foreign Minister of the host
 country as a "preliminary exchange of impressions on the best means of
 achieving joint action by the five republics."  The agenda includes the
 establishment of special commissions for dealing with common problems and
 discussion of a charter of a Central American organization to promote group
 action.
 The conference comes on the crest of an unprecedented wave of
 confraternity among the widely divergent countries.  In recent years there
 has even been considerable hostility among certain of the republics over
 the issue of the Caribbean Legion and its plots.  Although the current spirit
 of goodwill seems genuine enough at the moment, and has been given some
 substance by the recent exchange of ambassadors between the ideologically
 opposed governments of Guatemala and Nicaragua, it is likely that the more
 grandiose of the conferences aims will eventually meet the fate of other
 previous attempts at unification -- namely: falling afoul of shifting
 governments and underlying mistrusts.
 13.   ARGENTINA.  Peron asks leave of absence until after the elections:  President
 Peron has called a special session of Congress to meet on 11 October to
 consider his request for a leave of absence until after the 11 November
 elections, according to an official broadcast.  It was stated that Peron
 did not want it to be said that his presence had influenced the elections.
 The broadcast was Peron's first official acceptance of the Peronista
 nomination for re-election.

 Comment:  Peron's request for leave may represent a compromise with
 the arme   Drees, who reportedly had demanded Peron's resignation and had
 planned to replace the Peron-Quijano slate with Colonel (retired) Domingo
 Mercante and ex Foreign Minister Bramuglia (see OCI Daily Digest, 8 Oct 5l),
 It is not clear whether Peron, in officially announcing his candidacy,
 was also speaking for Quijanoa  If he was not, there is the possibility of
 a further compromise in that Mercante may yet replace the ailing Dr. Quijanod

 1.     INDONESIA.  Foreign Minister will recommend against triangular arrange-
 ments with India and Burma:  Foreign Minister Subardjo told US Ambassador
 Cochran that Indonesia had received no invitation to participate in
 scheduled India-Burma talks in New Delhi.  He further stated that the time
 has come for Indonesia to determine friendships on a political rather than  25X1
 a sentimental basis.  Subardjo told Cochran that he would recommend to his
 government that it not enter into triangular conferences with India and
 Burma  but instead strive toward good relations with all of Asia.

 Comment:  Prior to the San Francisco conference, there was some dis-
 cussion of India-Burma-Indonesia consultation in Djakarta.  These talks,
 however, did not materialize.  Recent press reports in both India and
 Indonesia have mentioned Indonesia's inclusion in India-Burma talks
 scheduled for 21 October.
 The Indonesian Government has received considerable criticism, par-
 ticularly from Socialist Party members, for not pursuing closer relations
 with Burma and India.
 SECTION 3 (WESTERN)
 2.    ITALY. Italy seeks semblance of equality for small powers on temporary
 NATO committee:  The US Embassy in Rome "trusts that the Department of State
 will firmly oppose the French demand that the US, UK and France openly domi-
 nate the temporary NATO committee," and points out that "neither the French
 nor the British are inclined to spare the susceptibilities of Italy and other
 smaller countries on vital issues."
 The Embassy adds that Communists in Italy would take full advantage of
 the opportunity to point out the lack'of equality in NATO and charge that
 Italy is being exploited in the interests of the larger powers.  It believes
 that the benefits resulting from De Gasperits trip to the US could quickly
 be lost through such a development.                                               25X1
 Comment:  Although the Italians have long been resentful of what
 seemed to them an inadequate participation in the policy decisions of the
 NATO councils, it is doubtful that any predominance of the Big Three in
 the temporary NATO committee would arouse Italian public opinion to a
 serious degree.
