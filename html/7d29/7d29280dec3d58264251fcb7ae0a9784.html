 Brigadier Ahdab's effort to force President Franjiyah out of office has bogged
 down, and his backers are divided on what to do next.
 Rebel army leader Ahmad Khatib and Socialist leader Kamal Jumblatt
 apparently would use their militia forces to attack the presidential palace, but are
 being held back by mainline fedayeen and Palestine Liberation Army forces. These
 Palestinian groups generally back Ahdab, but hope to keep the current political
 impasse from turning into a new round of heavy fighting.
 The Lebanese army high command still backs Ahdab,
 he high command has been unable even o agree on
 the wording of a joint statement calling for Franjiyah's resignation.
 Ahdab's followers are also divided on whether to establish a new governing
 body such as the military command council promised late last week. Some Christian
 military officers oppose the idea because they favor immediate election of a new
 Christian president; some civilians, like Jumblatt, oppose it because they dislike any
 of the trappings of military rule.
 Although it is possible that Ahdab will try to ignore these differences among
 his supporters and attempt to dislodge Franjiyah with force, it is increasingly likely
 that he will instead await the outcome of a new mediation effort by the Syrians.
 A Phalanges Party leader representing his group and the National Liberal Party
 reportedly visited Damascus yesterday, as did Yasir Arafat of the Palestine
 Liberation Organization.
 According to a Beirut newspaper with good contacts in Syria, Damascus is
 attempting to put together another political package that would provide for a
 general amnesty, reconstruction of the Lebanese army under the high command, and
 a new civilian government that would implement the Syrian-sponsored political
 agreement announced last month. Franjiyah would be considered "not affected by"
 the petition demanding his resignation, but would voluntarily step down.

 If the  Lebanese politicians can  reach agreement on a successor to
 Franjiyah-still their primary worry-it is likely that they would accept this or some
 similar solution proposed by Syria. Franjiyah remains unyielding in public, but is
 believed privately to be willing to resign if a compromise is worked out that is
 satisfactory to Christian leaders Pierre Jumayyil and Camille Shamun.
 If no political solution is found, it is likely that the already strained security
 situation will deteriorate steadily toward civil war, as it did in January. This almost
 certainly would lead to an attempt by the Christians to partition the country, and
 possibly to direct military intervention by Syria.
 Ahdab yesterday denied that any Syrian troops have entered Lebanon. He
 charged that reports of Syrian military involvement in Lebanon are designed only
 "to cause confusion and disturb unity."
 Attempts by the US defense attache in Damascus to determine the readiness of
 Syrian ground force units have been inconclusive. A Syrian Foreign Ministry official
 told a US embassy officer yesterday that the Syrian army was placed on alert last
 Saturday, but the attache has observed only minor military activity that could be
 considered unusual.

 New Delhi and Ottawa initialed a nuclear aid agreement on March 6, which, if
 ratified, will commit India not to test for over a year. The agreement calls for a
 resumption of Canadian assistance for the Rajasthan Nuclear Power Project. Canada
 suspended aid to this project after India detonated its first nuclear device in 1974.
 Under the agreement, the Rajasthan project is to be completed within 15
 months of ratification by the two governments, and New Delhi has implicitly agreed
 not to test during this period. The Indians also accepted Canada's safeguards
 requirements on the Rajasthan reactors and gave an oral assurance that India does
 not intend to export explosive material or technology.
 Three senior officials in Ottawa have          indicated that they expect
 difficulties in securing the final approval of the Canadian cabinet. It seems unlikely,
 however, that Ivan Head, leader of the Canadian delegation and Prime Minister
 Trudeau's principal foreign affairs adviser, would have initialed a document that he
 thought the cabinet would reject.
 Moreover, the Indians conceded on most of the major points sought by the
 Canadians. To push the Indians further would be to risk termination of all future
 safeguards on the Rajasthan reactors. It is clear, however, that the opposition parties
 will be critical when the agreement goes to Parliament for ratification.
 The head of the Indian Department of Atomic Energy recently told US
 officials that India has been conducting site surveys in preparation for a second test.
 India apparently intends to test again and may be in a position to do so after the 15
 months have elapsed, or even earlier if the agreement is not ratified. =

 Tass yesterday issued a short, straightforward statement on Egypt's abrogation
 of its friendship treaty with the USSR that reads like a holding piece until Moscow
 determines how to react.
 Not surprisingly, the statement blames President Sadat for the decline in
 Soviet-Egyptian relations. It describes the abrogation as a new manifestation of an
 "unfriendly" policy toward the USSR that. Sadat has been pursuing for a long time.
 The text asserts that Sadat has only put a "juridical seal" on a situation in which the
 treaty was not functioning.
 This suggests Moscow may be inclined to play down the significance of
 abrogation. The Tass statement makes no explicit or implicit threat. Regarding the
 future, Tass falls back on the platitude that the USSR will continue to work for
 friendly relations with Cairo and the Egyptian people.
 An earlier broadcast in Arabic from Moscow blamed external and internal
 reactionary forces for the deterioration in Soviet-Egyptian relations and for Cairo's
 turning away from Nasir's "socialist" path. It also included an implied appeal to the
 Egyptian military, asserting that internal forces were responsible for Egypt's
 weakened military capability.

 The Portuguese Socialist Party launched its campaign for the parliamentary
 election on April 25 with a display of European Socialist solidarity in Porto this past
 weekend, but the Socialists may have paid a high price in terms of future
 cooperation with the rival centrist Popular Democratic Party.
 Seeking to capitalize on his status as the most effective advocate of Portugal's
 interests abroad, Socialist leader Mario Soares hosted a meeting of Europe's most
 prominent Socialist and Social Democratic leaders. Taking their cue from an appeal
 by Soares for a better economic deal for Portugal, the assembled leaders-including
 heads of government from the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Austria and party
 leaders from West Germany, France, Italy, and Spain-responded by promising to
 work for increased assistance to Portugal's beleaguered economy.
 Although Snares skillfully manipulated the meeting for his own political ends,
 he also managed to alienate the Popular Democrats, partners of the Socialists in the
 present government of Prime Minister Azevedo and possible partners in a future
 coalition.
 Charging that the Porto meeting constituted unwarranted foreign interference
 in Portuguese domestic politics, Popular Democratic leader Francisco Sa Carneiro
 lodged formal complaints with the embassies of the countries involved. His strong
 protests undoubtedly prompted Prime Minister Azevedo's last-minute decision not
 to attend.
 blood."
 Followers of the two parties clashed in the streets of the northern city and at
 the Porto airport. In both cases, Socialists reacted violently to attempts by Popular
 Democrats to launch their own demonstrations, which the Socialists saw as an
 attempt to detract from the international gathering.
 Although Sa Carneiro said on Saturday that the door was still open to
 cooperation with the Socialists in a post-election coalition, the Popular Democrats'
 conditions for such cooperation are now likely to harden.
 The Communists also protested the Socialist meeting, albeit in much milder
 terms than the Popular Democrats. Communist Party leader Alvaro Cunhal said that
 the meeting was "in bad taste" and that it was an attempt to pressure the voters
 prior to the election.
 The guarded  nature of Cunhal's comments, made at a national party
 conference, reflect his current strategy of attempting to draw closer to the Socialists
 in hopes of achieving an election alliance-a strategy that the conference formally
 reconfirmed. Cunhal said that this was the only way to ward off a return to fascism
 and that an election victory by the Popular Democrats and the center-right Social
 Democratic Center would plunge the country into "a dark night of terror and

 There have been a number of reports-some of them conflicting-that Teng
 Hsiao-ping has lost one or more of his positions.
 I                                                                bosters
 have been displayed on major streets there claiming that Teng has been dismissed
 from all posts except those he holds within the Chinese Communist Party. If true,
 Teng has lost his jobs as chief of staff and as vice premier in the government, but is
 still a vice chairman of the party and presumably of the party's military commission.
 I                               peking has issued directives, one announcing
 that Teng has lost his job as army chief of staff, and another that he has lost that job
 as well as his party post as vice chairman of the military commission.
 The last-mentioned directive would seem to conflict with the statement in the
 posters that Teng retains his positions in the party. The posters apparently do not
 make reference to a directive on the subject. There have also been conflicting reports
 as to who, if anyone, has replaced Teng as chief of staff. Given the attacks on him, it
 is possible that the reports reflect rumors rather than official party decisions.

 The sharp gains posted by the Socialists in the two-round French cantonal
 elections that concluded Sunday will prompt debate and political reassessments
 within both the governing coalition and the opposition left alliance.
 Nearly complete returns show the opposition winning 907 departmental
 council seats to 870 for President Giscard's majority coalition, with the Socialist
 Party collecting 498, more than twice the number of any other party. Although the
 balloting affected only about half the electorate, the left appears likely to increase
 the number of departmental councils it controls from 30 to about 42 of the 95
 total.
 The left appears to have benefited from growing public discontent over
 France's continuing high rates of inflation and unemployment and from the fact
 that this was the first election in which 18 year-olds were eligible to vote.
 Socialist Party leader Francois Mitterrand, who campaigned hard, hails the
 election results as a sign of "great progress for the left." Communist Party leader
 Marchais sees the vote as a "serious warning shot for the government," but he shows
 concern over the continuing reluctance of Socialist voters to back Communist
 candidates in run-offs against centrist or conservative parties.
 Government leaders, on the other hand, are saying publicly that the results are
 only a "light warning," as Justice Minister Lecanuet put it, and continue to
 emphasize the local nature of the contests. They point out that the opposition has
 traditionally done well in cantonal elections and that these contests have been
 notoriously poor signs of voter sentiment in legislative elections.
 Both observations are true to some extent, but the Giscard government is
 taking die results more seriously than it is indicating in public. The government
 admits That its strategy of playing down the significance of the elections and of
 keeping government leaders out of the campaign was a mistake.
 The cantonal results are likely to spark increased debate within the governing
 coalition. Giscard's Independent Republicans made substantial gains at the expense

 of the Gaullists, and is likely to engender increased defensiveness and suspicion of
 Giscard's political maneuvering among the Gaullists. Within the victorious left
 alliance, the Communists have already shown concern over Socialist gains-many of
 them at the expense of the Communists-and are likely to step up efforts to reassert
 themselves.

 In a private conversation with US officials last Friday, National Defense
 Secretary Enrile said eight generals, all overdue for retirement, are to be retired by
 the end of the month. This will be the first move to implement the military
 reorganization announced by President Marcos in mid-February.
 Three of the four service commanders and five other generals will be retired.
 The service commanders, members of the group of 12 senior officers that
 implemented martial law in 1972, will probably be given high-level government
 sinecures so that their experience and loyalty will remain available to Marcos. The
 army and air force chiefs and several of the other generals, known for their graft,
 have been obvious candidates for removal for some time.
 Their replacements are familiar members of the Marcos team, although honesty
 was evidently a factor in some of the selections, such as that for the new air force
 chief. General Espino, the armed forces chief of staff, also overdue for retirement,
 retained his position, probably because of the sensitivity of selecting a replacement.
 Major General Ramos, the most likely successor for Espino, remains chief of the
 constabulary.
 Marcos had been hesitant to replace the loyal team of senior officers that
 implemented martial law. Discontent among middle-level officers with the lack of
 promotion opportunities and allegations of corruption against some of the generals
 probably underlie his decision to move at this time.
