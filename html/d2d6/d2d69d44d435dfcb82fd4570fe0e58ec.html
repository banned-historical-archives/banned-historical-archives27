FOREWORD 
This report examines the development of the machine-building in-
dustry of Communist China, with particular attention to the period of 
the First Five Year Plan (1953-57). The report reviews allocations 
of investment, growth of production, expansion of the product mix, 
and effects of the application of Soviet industrial experience. In 
connection with the application of Soviet experience; the report draws 
attention to the manner in which Communist economic decisions have 
been affected by political ideology. 
The analysis of the difficulties of applying a highly capital-
intensive technology to a country suffering from chronic overpopula-
tion sheds light on the Soviet claim that Soviet industrial experience 
can be exported anywhere. The analysis is suggestive of certain cau-
tions for underdeveloped countries of Free Asia that also suffer from 
overpopulation.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MACHINE-BUILDING INDUSTRY IN COMMUNIST CHINA* 
1949-62  
Summary and Conclusions 
The machine-building industry** of Communist China made impressive 
advances under the First Five Year Plan (1953-57). With the help of 
the USSR, and to a much lesser extent the European Satellites, new 
industries have been established so that Communist China can now pro-
duce some large-scale precision machine tools, simple equipment for 
mining and metallurgical processing, electrical equipment for medium-
size power stations, trucks, aircraft, and large locomotives. The 
total gross value of production by the machinery and equipment manu-
facturing sector increased at an average annual rate of about 34 per-
cent in 1953-57, almost double the rate of growth for industry as a 
whole. Rates of growth in machinery and equipment manufacturing were 
extremely uneven, however, reaching a peak of 90 percent in 1956 and 
falling to about 4 percent in 1957. In fact, the machine-building 
industry expanded at such a rapid pace that by 1957 it had outstripped 
production of raw materials and power, thus necessitating cutbacks in 
production and underutilization of capacity in many branches of the 
industry. In 1957 the metal-processing sector of the machine-building 
industry accounted for about 16 percent of the total gross value of 
Chinese industrial production and about 3 to 4 percent of gross na-
tional product in terms of value added. Nevertheless, China remains 
significantly dependent on foreign sources for machinery and equipment 
to support the growth of heavy industry. 
Under the First Five Year Plan, approximately .7.2 billion yuan*** 
were invested in the machine-building enterprises of Communist China. 
This amount is about 26 percent of estimated total investment in

capital construction for industry and is the largest allocation of 
investment to any single branch of industry. Investment was very 
uneven during the period, with severe cuts occurring in early 1957, 
when many plants were made idle by shortages of raw materials. Some-
what less than 3.8 billion yuan are believed to have been invested in 
plants producing military hardware and civilian goods with military 
applications under the former Second Ministry of Machine Building. 
Of the 7.2 billion yuan allocated to capital investment, additions 
to fixed assets absorbed slightly more than 6.0 billion yuan. A 
total of 89 machine-building projects were undertaken during 1950-57, 
of which 47 projects were completed by the end of 1957. Projects 
performed with aid from the Soviet Bloc accounted for the largest and 
most outstanding plants in the industry. Although some new plants 
have been dispersed in the interior, one-half of the Chinese capacity 
for producing machinery is concentrated in the northeast. 
At the outset of the First Five Year Plan the Chinese Communists 
placed faith in the broad application of Soviet industrial experience 
and technology to their own economic conditions. As a result, the 
growth of the Chinese machine-building industry was closely patterned 
after that of its Soviet counterpart. Toward the end of the plan 
period, however, it became apparent to the Chinese that a number of 
objectives toward which the industry was progressing were unsuitable 
for Chinese economic conditions and that the manner in which the pro-
gram of industrialization was being carried out under Soviet guide-
lines had certain detrimental effects on economic growth, stemming 
largely from the failure to take maximum advantage of the abundant 
manpower in Communist China. Development had been unbalanced, waste-
ful, and costly, although any program for the development of an in-
dustrial base carried out on such a large scale and with such haste 
was almost inevitably bound to incur high costs. Therefore, the 
Peking regime was forced to reappraise the relevance and applica-
bility of Soviet experience to China. Accordingly, in 1958, drastic 
readjustments of priorities for production and investment were made 
to support lagging agricultural growth, and technological policy was 
revamped to harmonize with the superabundance of labor in China. 
-Except, perhaps, in mechanization of agriculture the Chinese depar-
tures from Soviet experience do not imply abandonment of such funda-
mental objectives of a Communist regime as preferential development 
of heavy industry, but rather a choice of different means to the same 
end. Having an economy poor in capital with an oversupply of labor, 
the Chinese Communists were forced to find new approaches to (1) opti-
mum allocation 'of the factors of production, particularly labor; 
(2) the choice of the best technology in the short run; and (3) conse-
quent differences in vertical and horizontal integration of plants 
and production processes.

Under the Second Five Year Plan (1958-62), more emphasis will 
be given to supporting agricultural growth through the programs for 
irrigation and chemical fertilization. Large-scale mechanization to 
solve the problem of increasing agricultural production has been re-
jected as economically unsound because of chronic overpopulation. 
More investment is required in the raw materials and fuels industries 
to insure adequate quantities and variety of special steels and sup-
plies of electric power to the machine-building industry. Any slow-
down in the expansion of the industry that might be caused by bottle-
necks in raw materials, however, would be temporary. The Peking 
regime is deeply committed to base future economic development in-
creasingly on the foundation of its own machine-building industry, 
and this foundation, generally speaking, is still weak. Large in-
vestments must be made to correct present deficiencies in heavy ma-
chinery, precision machine tools, and instruments. 
Machinery and equipment constituted between 4o and 60 percent of 
all imports into Communist China under the First Five Year Plan 
(1953-57). In 1957, China imported nearly $580 million worth of 
capital equipment, almost one-half of which was supplied by the USSR. 
The contribution of the USSR to imports of machinery by Communist 
China has decreased somewhat in recent years, whereas that of the 
Free World has increased. Communist China can now supply about 60 per-
cent of its requirements for machinery and will attempt to attain self-
sufficiency of from 70 to 80 percent during the Second Five Year Plan, 
in bpite of a limited capacity for producing complete sets of equip-
ment. Imports of machinery will be restricted to the maximum extent 
consistent with rapid growth. So far, Chinese Communist exports of 
selected items of machinery have been insignificant and apparently 
politically inspired. A slight increase in exports of machinery by 
1962 is anticipated. 
Communist China continues to depend on foreign sources for special-
ized equipment, heavy and precision machine tools, measuring instru-
ments, and some other types of .equipment. Although steps have been 
taken to reduce the role of advisers and technicians from the Soviet 
Bloc, their influence will probably remain strong in electronics, 
synthetic fibers, metal-forming machinery, and heavy machinery. The 
dependence of Communist China on the USSR during the formative stages 
of its industrial development will have long-run effects because of 
the need for replacement of equipment and for compatibility of design 
and because of the genera' technical orientation toward the USSR, 
particularly on the part of recently trained Chinese engineers. At 
the same time, these engineers will be expected to adjust their tech-
nical standards and specifications to Chinese capacity for production 
and to take account of the pressing need to utilize abundant manpower.

I. Investment  
A. Priorities  
1. Basic Aims 
The general aims of the First Five Year Plan (1953-57) 
of Communist China were very similar to those of the USSR: increased 
national power, rapid growth, economic independence, and the elimina-
tion of capitalistic elements in society. Priority was given to the 
development of heavy industry, whereas relatively little attention 
was given to the investment needs of light industry and agriculture. 
These sectors were looked on primarily as sources of capital accumu-
lation for the further expansion of heavy industry. 
Some of these aims had the following direct implications 
for the development of the machine-building industry: the supplying 
of military hardware to enhance the military power of the state, the 
attainment of self-sufficiency at a rapid rate, and the transforma-
tion to socialized agriculture through large-scale mechanization. 
In the USSR, however, investment priorities had not been firmly fixed 
but were altered rather flexibly as disproportions in growth developed. 
The necessity for such shifts reflected in part internal contradic-
tions in the basic aims. For example, the emphasis on military power 
and self-sufficiency was not entirely consistent with the goal of 
maximum growth. 
Although the USSR employed a variety of means to achieve 
its objectives, the Chinese Communists clearly assumed that the means 
and the technology employed by the USSR were directly applicable to - 
their program for industrializing the backward and overpopulated areas 
of China. Moreover, after 1950 the Soviet approach to economic develop-
ment was inculcated through intensive indoctrination of Chinese 
cadres. 1/* The Peking regime was particularly anxious for indus-
trialization to bring about a change in. the class structure of Chinese 
society.. Industrialization was thought necessary to achieve two 
aims: the enlargement and collectivization of farms and the trans-
fer of rural population to cities, where the people could be more 
easily managed. E/ 
2. Leading Role for the Machine-Building Industry 
Communist theory assigns great importance to the active 
development of machine building at the initial stages of economic 
development. According to Stalin, "The core of industrialization,

its foundation, lies in the development of heavy industry ... or, in 
the final analysis, in the development of industry which creates the 
means of production -- in the development of its own machine build-
ing." 3/ This attitude was echoed by the Chinese Communists, who 
asserted that the industrialization of China could not be effected 
without an independent and integrated machine-building industry. 
3. Specific Tasks  
To achieve its basic mission, certain broad tasks were 
assigned to the machine-building industry of Communist China. These 
tasks included the following: 
a. To supply equipment for industrial projects. Al-
though the USSR was to supply 50 to 70 percent of the equipment for 
the construction projects that were to receive Soviet aid, which were 
the core of the plan, the remainder of the equipment was to be pro-
duced domestically. Other projects were to depend more on domestic 
sources of equipment. 4/ 
b. To increase military strength. In order to 
establish a modern army, navy, and air force, industries for pro-
ducing armored vehicles, aircraft, and ships needed to be developed. 
Previously, Chinese arsenals could produce only small arms and muni-
tions and not planes or armored vehicles. The First Five Year Plan 
called for the establishment of automobile plants and shipyards as 
well as aircraft plants. 
c. To provide a material basis for the collecti-
vization of agriculture. It was planned that by the end of 1957 
there would be more than 3 million cooperative farms under unified 
management. The cooperative farms could not be consolidated, it 
was believed, without the benefit of tractors and modern agricultural 
machinery. 5/ It was reported that in 10 years the production of 
Tractor Manufacturing Plant No. 1 at Lo-yang, which is designed to 
produce 15,000 tractors -- of 54 horsepower (hp) -- annually, could 
mechanize one-third of the farmland of Communist China. 
To carry out these tasks the plan called for the con-
struction of new plants to produce machinery and equipment for metal-
lurgy, power, mining, transportation, and agriculture. There was 
also to be some investment in the development of facilities to pro-
duce equipment for the petroleum-refining and chemical industries.* 
* For the principal projects that were to be undertaken by the machine-
building industry to support growth in various industries and sectors, 
as outlined in the plan, see Table 6, Appendix B, p. 88, below.

B. Capital Investment* 
1. Estimated Investment in the Machine-Building Industry 
a. Period of Restoration (1950-52)  
During the period of restoration the total industrial 
investment in capital construction in Communist China amounted to 
about 2.6 billion yuan,** of which about 14 percent was allocated to 
the metal-processing sector. Most of this amount was spent for re-
equipping old plants, and very few new projects were undertaken. 
During 1950-52, complete plants constituted a minor portion of the 
total imports of machinery and equipment from the USSR.*** 
b. First Five Year Plan (1953-57)  
Investment in the machine-building industry under 
the First Five Year Plan is estimated at 7.2 billion yuan, which 
was 4 percent more than the 6.93 billion yuan originally planned. 
Investment in machine building drew 26 percent of the total invest-
ment in industrial capital construction, the largest share of any 
branch of industry. 
Investment in the nonmilitary sectors of the machine-
building industry rose steadily through 1956 but declined by 30 to 
35 percent in 1957 compared with 1956. (See Figure 1.****) This 
cutback was due to the fact that in 1957 the machine-building indus-
try was unable to operate at capacity because of serious shortages of 
raw materials.t Consequently, it was decided to give more emphasis in 
1957 to investment in the coal, power, and metallurgical industries. 7/ 
2. Allocation of Investment, by Ministrytt 
Of the 7.2 billion yuan invested in the machine-building 
industry under the First Five Year Plan, about 3.4 billion yuan, or 
47 percent, were allocated to the metal-processing sector and 3.8 bil-
lion yuan, or 53 percent, were allocated to production of military 
goods. These categories correspond roughly to the First Ministry of

Machine Building, including electrical equipment, and the Second and 
Third Ministries of Machine Building as these ministries were con-
stituted in 1957. 
Lack of specific data does not permit separate estimates 
for the Second and Third Ministries of Machine Building. Throughout 
the First Five Year Plan, however, the Second Ministry was responsible 
for production of weapons and ammunition and probably received the 
major portion of investment in the military sector. Some of the 
plants affiliated with the Second Ministry, although engaged in pro-
ducing equipment closely connected with military production, did 
actually produce for civilian use such goods as telecommunications 
equipment and light bulbs. Moreover, production of civilian as well 
as military aircraft came under the Second Ministry.* 
Of the total investment by the First Ministry of Machine 
Building and the Ministry of the Power Equipmnt Industry in facili-
ties for production during 1953-56, 91 percent was allocated to above-
norm projects** and 77 percent to newly constructed enterprises.*** 
Relatively little investment in existing facilities was undertaken 
after 1953. 
3. Allocation of Investment, by Type of Product  
The largest allocations of Chinese Communist investment 
in the metal-processing sector during 1953-56 went to communications 
and transportation equipment, electric power equipment, machine tools, 
and measuring and cutting tools.**** Construction or reconstruction 
of 19 machine tool plants, 32 electrical equipment plants, 11 loco-
motive and rolling stock plants, and 12 automotive transport equipment 
plants was undertaken or completed during the period January 1950 - 
January 1958. Most of these plants were actually constructed during 
1953-57. 
Moderate amounts were allocated for investment in trac-
tors, agricultural machinery, power-producing equipment (excluding 
electrical equipment), and other branches. 
See Appendix A. 
** The term above-norm project as used in the machine-building 
industry of Communist China refers to a project requiring an invest-
ment ranging from more than 5 million yuan, such as machine tool 
plants, to more than 10 million yuan, such as shipbuilding, tractor, 
and locomotive plants.

Compared with the ambitious programs for construction 
carried out in those branches of the machine-building industry pro-
ducing machine tools, electrical equipment, and transportation equip-
ment, the branches producing heavy machinery (metallurgical, mining, 
and oil-drilling equipment) and chemical equipment received a rela-
tively small share of the funds for investment. Under the First Five 
Year Plan, however, some investment was allocated to heavy machinery 
and chemical equipment plants that would come into operation in a later 
period. Among these plants are the T'ai-yuan Heavy Machinery Plant, 
the Fu-la-erh-chi Heavy Machinery Plant, and the Lan-chou Petroleum 
and Chemical Machinery and Equipment Plant. It is probable that in-
vestment in the heavy machinery branch was accelerated in 1957, when 
the equipping of some of these plants began, and that the amount of 
investment that is allocated to the heavy machinery and chemical 
equipment branches will be substantial until these plants are fully 
equipped, probably by the end of 1960. 
During 1952-56 a total of 66.55 million yuan was in-
vested in textile machinery plants under the Ministry of the Textile 
Industry. !CI 
4. Allocation of Investment to Equipment and Construction* 
In general, the Chinese Communist practice is to expend 
approximately 40 percent of the capital investment in a machine-
building plant for machinery and equipment and approximately 60 per-
cent for plant construction. 12/ This distribution of investment to 
equipment and construction corresponds generally to Soviet practice. 
In the USSR, approximately 60 percent of the total capital investment 
is expended for construction, 30 percent for machinery and equipment, 
and 10 percent for instruments, supplies, and other minor items. There 
are, of course, certain variations in these proportions, depending on 
the type of project and when it was constructed.** Statistics for 
the allocation of investment to equipment and construction for a com-
parable group of US industries are not available. Nevertheless, the 
allocation of investment to equipment and construction for certain 
manufacturing industries in the US is roughly similar to the Chinese 
and Soviet allocations. *

struction of new enterprises in the US was as follows 12/:

C. Growth of Fixed Assets  
Of the 7.2 billion yuan invested in capital construction in 
the machine-building industry of Communist China, additions to fixed 
assets absorbed about 84 percent, or slightly more than 6.0 billion 
yuan in 1952-57.* Because of greater investment the growth of fixed 
assets in production by the military goods sector is estimated to 
have exceeded the growth of fixed assets in production by the metal-
processing sector, but precise figures are not available. 
At the end of 1958 the fixed assets of the metal-processing 
sector amounted to 6.5 billion yuan, of which about 20 percent were 
nonproductive fixed assets.** About 42 percent of the fixed assets 
of the metal-processing sector belonged in 1957 to nonelectrical 
enterprises of the First Ministry of Machine Building. 
Corresponding to the increase in the value of fixed assets 
was a considerable increase in the amount of installed production 
equipment. During 1952-56 the number of metal-cutting machine tools 
in the metal-processing sector increased from 80,000 to 157,000. 151 
In addition, there were rather impressive gains in newly added capac-
ity for production in operation, particularly during 1956-57, as can 
be seen from Table 1.*** 
* See Table 10, Appendix B, p. 93, below. Investment in capital 
construction becomes an addition to fixed assets when the plant in 
which the investment is made goes into operation. In any one year, 
therefore, many investments in capital construction are made that do 
not become additions to fixed assets until a later year. In an in-
dustry that is expanding as rapidly as the machine-building industry 
of Communist China, there is a tendency for investment, in capital con-
struction in a relatively short period to be greatly in excess of 
additions to fixed assets. 
** The term productive investment as defined by the Chinese Com-
munists and as used in this report refers to investment allocated to 
the construction of plant buildings and machinery and equipment for 
the purpose of production; to railroads, highways, seaports and 
wharves, and other means of transport; and to warehouses for commercial 
and financial enterprises. The term nonproductive investment (or 
investment in consumer construction) refers to investment allocated 
to construction for such material and cultural needs of the popula-
tion as housing, schools, hospitals, cinemas and theaters, nurseries, 
clubs, dining halls, and public office buildings. 211-/

D. Loans for Industrial Projects  
Soviet assistance to industrial construction projects has 
been one of the most significant factors in the rapid industrializa-
tion of Communist China since 1949.* This assistance has taken the 
form of two economic credits totaling 1.72 billion rubles, against 
which the Chinese Communists have drawn to help pay for imports from 
the USSR. These imports include equipment for the construction of 
the 166 major projects that the USSR promised to help China construct. 
The equipment, which the USSR agreed to deliver during 1949-62, is 
valued at 8.1 billion rubles, including all the technical assistance 
involved. 12/ 
Assistance from the European Satellites for construction pro-
jects in Communist China has not been given in the form of loans but 
has been financed out of current trade. Each of the Satellites has 
established a special ministry within its administrative structure 
that handles trade involving complete installations or projects. 
This trade has been quite distinct from incidental trade in machinery, 
which in some cases has been quite extensive. As of early 1958 the 
Satellites had furnished China with about 27 complete installations.** 
The estimated cost of these complete installations is about US $1 bil-
lion, of which about 4o percent represents plant equipment. 
E. Problems of Investment 
1. Misallocation of Investment 
. 
As previously noted, the Chinese Communists apparently 
assumed that the Soviet experience in development would suit their 
conditions. This assumption proved to be wrong in many cases, and, 
as a result of having followed Soviet precedents closely, much of the 
development of the Chinese machine-building industry was misdirected. 
One of the most notable mistakes that resulted from the indiscriminate 
application of Soviet experience was the costly failure of the pro-
gram for the large-scale mechanization of Chinese agriculture. Of the 
Chinese investment in new machinery plants, the Peking regime spent 
at least 6 percent to build plants for producing tractors and heavy 
implements until, when the plants were nearly completed, it was dis-
covered that such tractors and implements were almost entirely unsuit-
able to Chinese conditions. The tractors were very expensive to build, 
consumed large quantities of scarce steel materials, and required an 
advanced productive technique. Moreover, this machinery would strain 
the limited Chinese facilities for production of oil and would displace

farm workers who could not be absorbed in other sectors of the econ-
omy. 221/ Agricultural machines were produced in large numbers in 
1956, but many of them, such as double-wheel, double-share ploughs, 
lay idle because they were not suited to Chinese conditions. 
Moreover, Chinese Communist investments in the machine-
building industry were too widely diffused. This diffusion is ex-
plained at least in part by the fact that the regime followed Soviet 
experience too closely in pursuing the aim of self-sufficiency. 
Chinese leaders became imbued with the intense Soviet zeal for eco-
nomic independence from the West and regarded dependence on imports 
of capital goods from capitalist countries as a fundamental struc-
tural weakness in their economy that had to be eradicated as soon as 
possible. Particularly under the impetus of the Korean conflict, the 
Chinese were impressed by the need for rapid improvement in the in-
dustrial support for national defense and emphasized a broad approach 
to the development of the machine-building industry. As a result, 
they dispersed their investments in an attempt to create simultaneously 
a number of new branches of machine building instead of concentrating 
on certain branches the development of which would have contributed 
most to a balanced economic growth. Such action led to further 
autarky in the industrial growth of the Sino-Soviet Bloc. In this 
respect, Chinese mistakes in planning tended to follow the pattern 
of a number of the European Satellites during the early 1950's. The 
law of comparative advantage and specialization in intra-Bloc trade 
was sacrificed for the political objective of self-sufficiency. 
2. Excessive Cost of Investment 
In the First Five Year Plan (1953-57) Chinese Communist 
leaders enunciated strong aspirations to reach the most advanced 
level of technology in a short time with the help of the USSR. Soviet 
technology was extensively but rigidly and indiscriminately applied in 
the reconstruction and development of the machine-building industry. 
By 1957 the unfortunate results of this policy had become strikingly 
apparent. Much industrial investment was wasted in excessive non-
productive investment. Moreover, rigid adherence to Soviet design 
specifications and the overemphasis on modernization demanded very 
heavy investments and a technical level which was extremely difficult. 
for the Chinese machine-building industry to attain. This policy 
caused underutilization of existing capacity and helped to create an 
excessive demand for foreign equipment.* 
The tendency of Soviet industrial plans to require a high 
proportion of nonproductive investment is believed to be a source of

considerable dissatisfaction on the part of the Chinese Communists. 
The Chinese commented with a trace of bitterness that nonproductive 
investment took up 24 percent of total investment under the First 
Five Year Plan. 22/ The rate of nonproductive investment declined 
from 22.4 percent in 1956 to 20 percent in 1957. E.9./ The Chinese 
have admitted that in numerous cases they tried to copy the most 
modern industrial and municipal designs of the USSR, which called 
for housing and other facilities on a scale that was lavish by 
Chinese standards. 21/ This fact is well illustrated in the con-
struction of some of the largest machine-building plants at ChTang-
chtun, Lo-yang, Tiai-yuan, Fu-la-erh-chi, and other centers. A 
vice minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building complained 
that investments by certain enterprises of the industry were too broad 
in nature, often including roads, bridges, antiflood work, water sup-
ply, schools, and even banks, post offices, department stores, and co-
operatives. 22/ Thus the Chinese apparently borrowed from the USSR 
the highly integrated and detailed plans for "industrial cities," 
which provided for every facility from industrial plants to schools, 
hospitals, and bus stations to be established at a new location. 21/ 
Excessive nonproductive investment has a retarding ef-
fect on economic growth, for when too many factors of production are 
channeled into nonproductive work, the absolute growth of production 
is reduced. Moreover, imbalances in raw materials are aggravated as 
large proportions of scarce resources flow into nonproductive assign-
ments. These effects combineto raise the cost of investment per unit 
of increased capacity for production and thus to reduce the produc-
tivity of industrial investment. The result is to hinder the improve-
ment of living standards by delaying the realization of higher employ-
ment and possibly per capita national income. An awareness of such 
effects of nonproductive ii-Westment is believed to have resulted in 
several corrective measures that were written into the proposals for 
the Second Five Year Plan: (1) greater use of medium-scale and small-
scale plants that can be located at established centers of population 
and (2) rigorous scrutiny of plans for construction borrowed from the 
USSR and the European Satellites to eliminate nonessential items.* 
The Chinese Communists, it is interesting to note, have had some 
sobering experiences with the high cost of investment in new indus-
trial areas such as Sian and Lan-chou. The rapid influx of popula-
tion into these areas has involved considerable outlays for urban 
public utilities, residential housing, and other nonproductive facili-
ties. EY In an effort to economize on investment and eliminate as 
much nonproductive investment as possible, the Chinese may have recon-
sidered some of their plans for locating industries away from the stra-
tegically vulnerable coastal regions.**

3. Failure to Seek Quick Returns on Investments  
When Soviet technical assistance and aid for Chinese Com-
munist industrialization was announced in September 1953, an important 
role for existing plants was clearly intended. 22/ According to the 
official plan issued in 1955, 70 percent of the increase in the total 
value of industrial production between 1952 and 1957 was to be derived 
from existing enterprises. 2g Of the new plants under the First 
Ministry of Machine Building that were scheduled to be constructed 
under the First Five Year Plan (1953-57), only 24 percent were to 
start operation by the end of 1957, and 38 percent were expected to 
start operation in the early years of the Second Five Year Plan 
(1958-62). 
Under the First Five Year Plan, 85 percent of the invest-
ment in machine tool plants was scheduled to be devoted to the con-
struction of new facilities and 15 percent to the reconstruction of 
old facilities. Reconstructed plants, however, were to account for 
52 percent of the total production of machine tools. 27/ 
The task assigned was formidable, and the existing plants 
were not markedly improved and remained a weak link in the production 
force during the plan period. For example, Automobile Plant No. 1 
at Ch'ang-ch'un, although a wholly integrated plant for major com-
ponents, is dependent on 42 outside plants that make one-third of 
the parts which go into the vehicles produced, and 40 of these 42 
plants are outmoded. This fact indicates that the problem of raising 
the technical standards and expanding old plants must be ,faced if the 
old plants are to work in cooperation with newly constructed plants 
that operate at high technical levels. The improvement of the old 
plants means further exploitation of their potentials by increasing 
the utilization factor of their equipment. The Shanghai Boiler Plant 
was remodeled between 1954 and 1956 to increase its capacity for pro-
duction considerably, but it has been stated that a further investment 
of 10 million yuan could raise its capacity for production by 150 per-
cent. Investment of 3.8 million yuan in remodeling the Tungyung 
Machinery Plant in Canton reportedly would increase its capacity for 
production by 83 percent. 28/ 
It was admitted that, in spite of the early resolve to 
exploit possibilities for investments yielding quick returns, this 
goal had not been sufficiently emphasized during 1953-57. There was 
considerable latent capacity in existing industrial enterprises, par-
ticularly those in coastal areas. 22/ An investigation of 22 state 
and public-private machine-building enterprises in Shanghai (mostly 
electrical equipment plants) concluded that, with an investment of 
only slightly more than 42 million yuan, the total annual production

S-E-C-R-E-T 
by the rebuilt plants could be raised to 220 million yuan. 32/ Mao 
Tse-tung himself, in his famous speech on "contradictions," stated in 
effect that even by 1957 full use had not been made of the industrial 
capacity that had existed before 1949. 31/ 
These experiences indicate that the Chinese Communists 
lost an outstanding opportunity to get the maximum effect from funds 
accumulated at great sacrifice from the populace. Small investments 
in reevipping of existing plants could have yielded relatively large 
gains in production. For instance, reconstructed machine tool plants 
required 30 percent less investment per ton of products than did new 
plants. 12J This course of action, however, was not without its draw-
backs. Conceivably, if the Peking regime had concentrated on fast-
yielding investments in machine buildingl it might have hastened or 
aggravated short-run economic imbalances due to lagging growth in the 
industries producing raw materials. This effect could have been some-
what mitigated, however, because a smaller construction program would 
have been needed to achieve the same.levels of output. In deciding to 
build spectacular modern plants in the interior to "catch up with the 
West" in the shortest possible time, Chinese Communist leaders un-
doubtedly were influenced by the desire for prestige as well as the 
desire not to increase reliance on vulnerable coastal areas. More-
over, the failure to exploit latent capacity in the smaller plants 
was partly political. The regime was reluctant to build up these 
enterprises, particularly in the coastal cities, until transforma-
tion to socialization had been accomplished by the end of 1956. la/ 
II. Production  
A. Machine-Building Industry in 1949 
The machine-building industry that the Chinese Communists 
inherited in 1949 was disorganized and in disrepair. Most of the ma-
chinery had been dismantled by the USSR, and without large-scale re-
construction the industry could not support the ambitious goals for 
industrialization of Chinese Communist leaders. 
1. China Proper  
In 1949 the machine-building industry of China proper was 
virtually nonexistent, most of the firms consisting only of small re-
pair shops. Although some development of the machine industry had 
taken place in the interior under the impetus of wartime conditions, 
the industries of China proper had largely stagnated during 1930-49. 
Capital stock in the relatively developed coastal cities had been 
largely depleted before World War II. Further deterioration took 
place during the war and the economic chaos that followed.

2. Manchuria 
Most of the development of the machine-building industry 
in China before 1949 had been concentrated in Manchuria. During the 
1930's the development of the machine-building industry in Manchuria 
lagged because of restrictive Japanese policies, but the advent of 
World War II altered the development of the 'industry. After 1942, 
most of the machine building plants in Japan were forced to switch 
to armaments, and it became difficult to supply Manchurian needs for 
machinery. Consequently, the expansion of such production in Man-
churia was accelerated, and development proceeded according to a 
clearly defined outline. In spite of this development, Manchurian 
machine building remained weak. The industry was limited to the 
assembly and installation of communications equipment and motor 
vehicles and was unable to produce large machines, precision ma-
chines, and many types of spare parts. 12/ According to the Pauley 
Reparations Commission Report, Soviet removals of machinery and 
equipment from Manchuria reduced by 80 percent the capacity for pro-
duction by metalworking shops (excluding the railroad repair shops). ,316/ 
B. Plants 
1. Number  
During the period of the Chinese Communist First Five 
Year Plan (1953-57), it was stated that the construction of more than 
80 principal machinery and equipment plants would be undertaken dur-
ing 1953-61. Ei These plants were to serve as the foundation for 
building a modern, independent machine-building industry for Com-
munist China. 
It was reported that 33 major machine-building plants were 
put into operation during the first 4 years of the First Five Year 
Plan. 2/ Later, it was claimed that by the end of 1957 more than 
39 above-norm machine-building projects had been completed. 12/ In 
general, an analysis of available plant data supports this reported 
information.* ? 
* There are numerous difficulties in determining the exact number of 
plants completed. For example, the Chinese Communists often speak of 
"above -norm machine-building plants" or "major machine-building plants" 
without giving precise definition of meaning. Consequently, although 
an analysis of information on plants shows that 47 machine-building 
plants were completed by 1957, it is possible that only 39 of these 
are considered by the Chinese to be "above-norm" projects. Moreover, 
it is not known whether or not a plant is considered completed after 
first phase construction is finished and partial operation commences, 
with the second phase of construction set for a later date., A third 
difficulty derives from the fact that construction dates for all the 
plants are not available.

The USSR and the European Satellites have assumed an im-
portant role in the construction of industrial plants in Communist 
China. As shown in Table 2,* the USSR committed itself to assist 
China in the construction of 166 major industrial projects.** The 
importance of these projects can be seen in the fact that the plants 
built with Soviet assistance are scheduled to account for nearly 
60 percent of planned production in 1962. 41/ Although Table 2 shows 
that only 28 of the 89 machine-building projects started by the end 
of 1957 had received aid from the Soviet Bloc, these projects were the 
outstanding machine-building projects undertaken during the First Five 
Year Plan. Among them were such projects as the Ch'ang-ch'ain Automobile 
Plant No. 1, the T'ai-yuan and Fu-la-erh-chi Heavy Machinery Plants, 
the Lo-yang Tractor Plant No. 1, and the Ch'eng-chou (Chleng-hsien) Grind-
ing Machine Plant, which represent the largest, most advanced, and most 
modern plants in their respective sectors of the machine-building industry. 
2. Description 
To transform the weak and backward machine-building in-
dustry, the Chinese Communists established large installations with 
the most modern machinery and techniques. It was impossible for Com-
munist China, with its low technological level and scarcity of mechan-
ical skills, to construct modern machine-building plants without the 
massive foreign assistance that the USSR provided. In spite of the 
abundance of labor in China, few labor-intensive investments were 
undertaken in this industry. Instead, the large-scale, modern plants 
undertaken by the Peking regime were based on advanced labor-saving 
technology. Undoubtedly the decision to invest in this fashion was 
based in part on noneconomic motives: the desire to achieve self-
sufficiency, greater military power, and international prestige, all 
within the shortest possible time. 
This pattern of investment is reflected in the general 
characteristics prevalent in Chinese Communist plants constructed 
with Soviet assistance -- that is, high building costs, large in-
vestments in nonproductive aspects of the plants, -large size, com-
plex and specialized equipment, and highly mechanized production 
techniques. For example, the Fu-la-erh-chi Heavy Machinery Plant, 
* Table 2 follows on p. 19. 
** For 3 years following April 1956 the number of Soviet aid projects 
was reported as 211. Of this number, only 205 were considered by the 
Chinese Communists to be industrial construction projects. The re-
maining six involved the construction of research institutes and the 
renovation or expansion of previously constructed projects. In April 
1959 it was reported that the number of projects had been reduced 
from 211 to 166 as a result of the merging of some of these projects 
during their construction. )_?2/

matic. 'IV Reportedly its 16 shops will be equipped with remote con-
trol instruments and other automatic devices as well as highly effi-
cient machinery to permit production of such products as steel rolling 
and smelting equipment, blooming machines, open hearth furnaces with 
capacities of 500 tons each, and blast furnaces with capacities of 
1,500 cubic meters each. 1.+?./ The recently completed Ch'eng-tu Measur-
ing Instrument Plant is also of modern design and is equipped with 
the most up-to-date equipment. LT/ The workshops are equipped with 
pushbutton and semiautomatic tools and automatic controls for temper-
ature, humidity, and dust. 1.4j,j These highly mechanized methods, which 
are characteristic of the machine-building plants built with Soviet 
aid, are clearly illustrated in photographs of the interiors of these 
plants. The accompanying photographs of various shops of Automobile 
Plant No. 1 at Ch'ang-ch'un show automatic transfer lines in pro-
duction of engines and the extensive mechanization of materials-
handling operations, as shown in Figures 2 through 5.* 
A large portion of the equipment for these new, modern 
plants was imported from the USSR. According to the Chinese Com-
munist First Five Year Plan the USSR was to supply 50 to 70 percent 
of the equipment for the projects constructed with Soviet aid, and 
the remainder was to be domestically produced. Other projects were 
to depend more on domestic sources of equipment./22/ Because these 
large plants using modern production techniques required modern and 
complex machinery that the Chinese Communists could not produce them-
selves, the Chinese depended primarily on the USSR for equipment to 
outfit these plants. 
Another characteristic of many of the new machine-building 
plants in Communist China is specialized production. For example, 
several of them were designed to make only one type of machine.** OJ 
As a result of emphasis on large-scale projects, there 
has been a substantial increase in capital investment per worker in 
the metal-processing sector of the Chinese Communist machine-building 
industry, as shown in Table 3.***

China was reoriented toward the Soviet Bloc. Not only'because of 
necessity but undoubtedly also because of ideological compatibility, 
the Chinese wholeheartedly welcomed Soviet assistance in their de-
velopment program. Under these circumstances, Soviet influence spread 
rapidly throughout the Chinese economic system. The Chinese enthusi-
astically studied Soviet experience as a model for their own develop-
ment, diligently and, as it later became apparent, often uncritically 
applying it to their own planning.*

1. Period of Restoration (1950-52)  
Technical plans and materials as well as the services of 
competent advisers were apparently invaluable to the Chinese Com-
munists, in restoring levels of production after 1949. The first 3

period," were characterized by a stabilization of the economy, an

extension and consolidation of political controls, and the expansion 
of production with relatively little fixed capital investment. That 
the economy, which had been depressed and fragmented by a decade of 
war and civil war, responded favorably was caused primarily by the 
restoration of political stability, better distribution of raw ma-
terials, and other similar factors. Insofar as economic recovery de-
pended on technical assistance, however, Soviet technicians and ad-
visers made an important contribution. 2/ Most of the Soviet ma-
chinery imported during this period apparently was allocated to exist-
ing machine-building facilities, and imports of complete plants were 
a comparatively minor factor until 1953.* A considerable amount of 
Soviet aid was expended, however, in preliminary survey and design of 
new projects the actual construction of which began under the First 
Five Year Plan (1953-57). There were no known machine-building pro-
jects undertaken with aid from the European Satellites during the 
period of restoration. 
2. First Five Year Plan (1953-57)  
The first of several Sino-Soviet agreements on scientific 
and technical cooperation was announced on 11 October 1954. By its 
terms the USSR agreed to furnish to Communist China the following 
items: (a) plans and blueprints for industrial construction, includ-
ing metallurgical and machine-building plants, power stations, and 
other projects; (b) blueprints for machinery and equipment; (c) data 
on techniques and methods for producing many types of industrial 
goods; and (d) scientific, technical, reference, and training ma-
terials. Pursuant to such agreements the Chinese received designs 
and technical data for a large number of engineering projects, in-
cluding Automobile Plant No. 1 at Ch'ang-ch'un and locomotive and 
railroad passenger car works as well as blueprints for machine tools 
of many kinds, mining machinery, and other products. ** 53/ 
Soviet advisers assisted the Chinese Communists in the 
actual formulation of plans as well as the execution of plans. The 
Chinese Communists had modeled their economic administration on Soviet 
prototypes, a move which facilitated liaison with planning groups in 
Soviet ministries.2)1/ Soviet advisers were believed to have been 
assigned to all levels in the Chinese Communist economic ministries, 
administrative organs, and industrial organizations. 
Soviet technical aid covered the whole process of con-
struction from the selection of plant sites, collection of basic 
data required for purposes of design, formulation of the task of

designing, making designs, supply of equipment, and direction of 
building and safe operations to production of new products, train-
ing of talents capable of mastering new technology, and supply of 
technical data required for making new products. 22/ Soviet advisers 
at construction sites and at ministerial planning levels thus had ex-
tensive technical authority until the actual turning out of products, 
when complete responsibility devolved on the Chinese Communist tech-
nicians and managers. 6 
The influence of technical advisers from the European 
Satellites at the higher levels of planning and administration has 
been less pervasive than that of Soviet advisers. The influence of 
the Satellites was felt moie directly in plant layout, product de-
sign, and production techniques in connection with specific projects 
for which these countries had supplied equipment. In this sense, 
certain fields of machine building reflect substantial Satellite tech-
nical influence -- for example, Czechoslovak influence in diesel en-
gines and steam turbines; East German influence in telecommunications 
equipment, electrotechnical apparatus, synthetic fibers, and abrasive 
products; and Hungarian influence in electronics. Polish influence 
has been slight, being significant only in machinery for refining 
sugar beets. 
Engineering projects carried out with assistance from the 
Soviet Bloc provided opportunities for Chinese Communist engineers 
and technicians to gain experience under the supervision of Soviet 
personnel in the design, construction, and operation of plants. More-
over, during 1953-57, some 7,000 Chinese engineers, administrators, 
and skilled workers were sent to the USSR to acquire experience in 
plants and other industrial institutes. 2y/ For Automobile Plant 
  at Ch'ang-chTun, 500 Chinese were trained at the ZIL (Zavod 
imeni Likhachev) Motor Vehicle Plant in Moscow and other Soviet 
automobile plants. On their return to Communist China, these trainees 
set up training programs based on the knowledge they had acquired in 
the USSR. 2/ 
In addition, Soviet influence became very prominent in 
formal technical education. Soviet professors of engineering occupy 
a number of important positions in the new engineering institutes of 
Communist China. In the rapid expansion of engineering curricula 
the technology of the manufacture of machinery and tools has been 
strongly emphasized. It is not unusual for a Soviet professor to be 
concurrently an adviser to an industrial ministry or a major plant. L2/ 
Most of the gains in efficiency and productivity in 
various Chinese Communist plants have been attributed in Press re-
ports to the suggestions of Soviet technicians or of Chinese who have

received training from Soviet technicians. It was reported that a 
group of workers at the Mukden (Shen-yang) Machine Tool Plant 
more than quadrupled their working efficiency by adopting an advanced 
Soviet method of high-speed metal cutting demonstrated by a Soviet 
lathe turner. .62/ Soviet high-speed metal-cutting methods, as well 
as Soviet techniques for metal drilling, metal casting, and metal 
rolling are said to have been adopted extensively with good results 
in the Chinese engineering industries. _61/ Such examples involve 
extremely specialized techniques, however, and are of little conse-
quence in any over-all measure of increased productivity. In addi-
tion, there are some technical problems in high-speed cutting that 
make the attainment of greater productivity somewhat questionable. 
Probably the real gains in productivity were accomplished primqrily 
through the application of general industrial engineering technique 
with little additional investment in equipment. The Chinese Com-
munists could and probably did learn most from Soviet technicians in 
such fields as plant layout, preventive maintenance and repair, 
methods and motion study, and simplification of design. Thus the 
greatest benefits derived by the Chinese Communists from such tech-
nical assistance were a considerable improvement in the technical 
level and some increase in productivity, as well as the opportunity 
to imitate on a massive scale the machinery imported from the Bloc. 
D. Location* 
1. Development of Industries in the Interior  
Before 1949 the machine-building industry, such as it was, 
and most of the other industries of China were concentrated in a few 
coastal cities such as Tientsin and Shanghai and in Northeast China, 
where supplies of raw materials, a trained labor force, and trans-
portation had been developed, largely by foreigners. The Chinese 
Communists inveighed against this pattern of location as irrational 
and the result of "imperialist encroachment and Kuomintang domination." 
Their First Five Year Plan (1953-57) set forth a program designed to 
bring about a satisfactory location of industry in three 5-year 
plans. The planned location of new industries was to be based on 
certain general principles, including the development of industrial 
productive capacity in all regions of the country, the location of 
industry near sources of. fuels and raw materials, dispersion to 
meet defense requirements, and the gradual improvement of economic 
standards of backward areas. To implement these principles the First 
Five Year Plan called for the utilization and expansion of existing 
industrial bases, especially in Northeast China (Region I),** to

support national construction and accumulate capital; the construc-
tion of new industrial bases in North China (Region III), Northwest 
China (Region VIII), and Central China (Region V) centering around 
the two new Aron and steel combines to be established in Pao-t'ou 
and Wu-han; and the carrying out of preparatory work for the con-
struction of a new industrial base in Southwest China (Region VII). LV 
The First Five Year Plan envisioned the shifting of the 
center of the machine-building industry toward the interior of Com-
munist China by construction of new enterprises. It called on the 
First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of the Power Equip-
ment Industry to engage in construction of new large-scale enter-
prises, of which 24 percent were to be located in maritime areas and 
76 percent in the interior.* Of the projects in machine building 
carried out with Soviet aid, 16 percent were to be built in maritime 
areas and 84 percent in the interior. The Peking regime aimed to in-
crease the share of production by metal-processing enterprises lo-
cated in the interior from 20 percent in 1952 to 62 percent in about 
1960-61, following the completion of new enterprises on which con-
struction was scheduled to start during 1953-57. 
Although the Chinese Communists undertook considerable new 
construction of machine-building plants in the interior, the geograph-
ical location of production was not altered appreciably by the end of 
1957. The limited progress between 1952 and 1955 is indicated by per-
centages in terms of value in the following tabulation:

Further details of the location of total production and of production 
of machinery in 1955 are available on such items as boilers, machine 
tools, and electrical equipment* Although new bases for machine 
building have been established at inland points such as Ch'ang-ch'un, 
Harbin, Ch'i-ch'i-ha-erh, Lo-yang, Sian, and Lan-chou, a substantial 
portion of total production still is concentrated in Shanghai and 
Mukden. However, the construction of many such important inland 
machine-building plants as those in T'ai-yuan, Fu-la-erh-chi, Wu-han, 
Lan-chou, Lo-yang, Ch'eng-tu, and Sian, which was undertaken during 
1953-57, will be completed under the Second Five Year Plan (1958-62). 
The development of inland industrial bases has certain 
disadvantages, both economic and military. Although, in some in-
stances, there may be compelling economic reasons for the choice of 
more costly sites in the interior, these sites require the investment 
of large amounts in such nonproductive construction as housing, trans-
portation, and welfare facilities. In fact, statements emanating from 
the Eighth Chinese Communist Party Congress in 1956 complained that 
inadequate attention was given "to the full, rational utilization of 
coastal industry." LV Current plans pay more attention to older in-
dustrial areas as centers for machine building.** Moreover, the de-
velopment of machine-building plants away from vulnerable coastal 
areas does not represent an unqualified gain in terms of security 
from air attack. There are some factors which partly offset the ad-
vantages of defense in depth. A number of machine-building plants, 
particularly some of the newest and largest, are located far from 
their sources of raw materials and are, therefore, vulnerable to dis-
ruption and congestion in surface transportation. In addition, elec-
tric power grid systems are not well developed in the remoter regions, 
and so plants tend to depend on a single source of power. 
2. Economic Regions*** 
a. Northeast China (Region I)  
Pursuant to the principle of expanding existing in-
dustrial bases the Chinese Communists undertook the construction of 
new plants and reconstruction and expansion of older plants in North-
east China. About 30 percent of all machine-building plants started 
or completed during 1950-57 were constructed in this region, which ac-
counts for 50 percent of the Chinese capacity to produce machinery. .6_/

regions, see Table 12, Appendix B, p. 95, below.

S-E-C-R-E-T 
Within Northeast China the heaviest concentration of 
machine building is in MUkden. Mining machinery, metallurgical equip-
ment, construction equipment, electrical equipment, machine tools, and 
other types of general industrial equipment all are being produced 
here. The importance of Mukden is due largely to its initial develdp-
ment under the Japanese in an area where abundant supplies of raw ma-
terials had promoted the development of the steel and aluminum indus-
tries and to a relatively adequate transportation system. 
Under the First Five Year Plan (1953-57), however, 
the center of gravity of machine building in Northeast China started 
to move northward as the result of a conscious effort to shift indus-
try inland and avoid overconcentration in the south. 4?_/ A large 
motor vehicle plant and a railroad equipment plant were established 
at Ch'ang-ch'un in Kirin Province. Farther north, at Harbin in 
Heilungkiang Province, is located the new Harbin Measuring and Cut-
ting Tools Plant and the huge Harbin electrical equipment complex. 
Heilungkiang Province is also the site of the new Fu-la-erh-chi Heavy 
Machinery Plant. 
b. North China (Region III)  
North China, which has the second largest number of 
machine-building plants, is also rich in mineral resources. Most of 
the machine-building plants are located in Peking and Tientsin, the 
two major cities of the region. Radio equipment, electronic tubes, 
machine tools, and agricultural equipment are produced in Peking. 
Tientsin is the site of a tractor plant and of plants producing air 
compressors, diesel engines, mining machinery, textile machinery, and 
machine tools. Present plans call for even greater development of 
Peking and Tientsin. By 1962, Tientsin is to become the site of a 
heavy industrial complex concentrating on production of high-grade, 
precision, and heavy industrial products ?2/ but will continue to 
stress production of -inteimal combustion engines, machine tools, 
and electrical instruments. 2/ 
One of the largest machine-building centers in the 
interior of Communist China is being developed at T'ai-yuan. Here 
is located the new large T'ai-yuan Heavy Machinery Plant, which is 
scheduled for completion in 1960 and will be one of four major plants 
in China producing metallurgical equipment. A reconstructed mining 
machinery plant is also located in T'ai-yuan. 
Tsinan is an important center for production of diesel 
engines and machine tools. La-yang, a new city, is now the foremost 
producer of tractors, mining machinery, and antifriction bearings in 
Communist China. Ch'eng-chou (Ch'eng-hsien) is the site of a textile 
machinery plant and a new grinding machinery plant.

c. East China (Region IV)  
Before 1956 the Peking regime looked on this region 
mainly in terms of its capacity for supporting industrial develop-
ment in the interior and had little inclination to aggravate what 
the regime considered to be the irrational overconcentration of in-
dustry in this vulnerable area. Because of its past associations 
with foreigners and capitalist elements, Shanghai was long regarded 
with suspicion, and the full development of the potential of exist-
ing enterprises was neglected until state control had been effected. 
Recently, however, new industrial areas have been established on the 
outskirts of Shanghai, and current plans call for the development of 
this city as a leading center for production of heavy machinery and 
precision tools. 22/ A heavy machinery plant was started in August 
1958. 
Shanghai accounts for a large proportion of the major 
commodities produced in Communist China, including one-quarter of the 
total value of production of the machine-building industry in 1957. 
During 1950-57, Shanghai produced 28,000 machine tools, or 22 percent 
of total production during this period. In 195758, Shanghai ac-
counted for the following percentages of total production: 30 to 
50 percent of diesel and gasoline engines, 10 to 30 percent of elec-
tric motors, and 10 to 20 percent of machine tools. 71/ Four plants 
in Shanghai making power equipment, steam turbines, boilers, and 
switchboards account for about one-half of the power generating 
equipment produced in China. 12/ This proportion will diminish con-
siderably because of the increasing prominence of the heavy electrical 
equipment complex in Harbin. 
50X1 
50X1 
the 50X1 
machine-building industry is still dependent to a considerable extent 
on this highly vulnerable target area. 
At Nanking, another important machine-building center 
in East China, radio equipment, trucks, and several varieties of ma-
chine tools are produced. Ho-fei, in Anhwei Province, is slated to 
become a new machine-building center. 
construction of four large machine-building plants, which will produce 
tractors, motor vehicles, machine tools, and ball bearings, was to be 
undertaken in Ho-fei.

d. Central China (Region V)  
The First Five Year Plan called for the construction 
of two new industrial bases in Central China. A new iron and steel 
combine second only to that at An-shan will be established at Wu-han. 
Here is located Communist China's new Wu-han Heavy Machine Tool Plant, 
which is in partial operation. A motor vehicle plant, possibly to 
have a capacity larger than that of the Chlang-ch'un Automobile Plant 
is scheduled for location at Wu-han. The second new industrial 50X1 
zone in this region is in Hunan Province and is centered about the 
machine tool and electrical equipment industries of Ch'ang-sha and 
Hsiang-t'an. 
e. Southwest China (Region VII)  
Because Southwest China was lacking in adequate 
transportation facilities and supplies of iron and coal, it did not 
receive much ,emphasis in the industrialization program of the First 
Five Year Plan. 152 Whatever machine building took place in this 
region under the First Five Year Plan was confined primarily to 
Ch'eng-tu and Chungking. The largest measuring and cutting tools 
plant in Communist China was constructed at Ch'eng-tu in Szechwan 
Province, as were two radio equipment plants and a ball bearing 
plant. In Chungking, the center of a small munitions industry dur-
ing World War II, a reconstructed machine tool plant was put into 
operation in 1953 with Soviet assistance. Recent plans call for the 
development of Chungking into a modern industrial city with iron and 
steel, machine-building, and electrical machinery enterprises. In-
vestments in capital construction in Chungking in 1958 are to be 
double those of 1957. II/ -Machine tools are also being produced at 
K'un-ming in Yunnan Province. 
f. Northwest China (Region VIII)  
Machine building in Northwest China, the largest of 
the economic regions, was rather limited under the First Five Year 
Plan. As in Southwest China, attention during this period was de-
voted primarily to the development of transportation facilities and 
to prospecting for mineral resources. Machine-building construction 
has been largely confined to the cities of Lan-chou and Sian. The 
development of machine building in Lan-chou, which is the capital of 
Kansu Province and the railroad hub of Northwest China, is closely 
related to the importance of the region in production of petroleum. 
A new petroleum-drilling equipment plant and an oil-refining and 
chemical industry equipment plant, the first of its kind in China, 
are being constructed in Lan-chou.

Sian, another rising industrial center in Northwest 
China, is slated to become an important base for production of elec-
trical equipment. Recently completed in Sian is the new Sian Electric 
Capacitor Plant, the first modern power capacitor plant in Communist 
China. :EY A new high-voltage switch plant will soon be put into 
operation in Sian, which will also become a center for production of 
instruments. A plant which will produce apparatus and meters to con-
trol and measure temperature and various types of thermo-tecWcal 
apparatus and meters for the artificial and synthetic fiber and the 
chemical fertilizer industries is being built in Sian with East 
German aid. 12/ Various types of geological surveying instruments 
are being produced at the new Sian Geophysical Instruments Repair and 
Manufacturing Plant. 
g. South China (Region VI)  
Until 1958, production in South China was limited 
almost entirely to consumer goods, the handicraft industry account-
ing for a major share of total production. What little machine build-
ing took place was confined largely to Canton in Kwangtung Province. 
Sugar-refining equipment, necessary for the sugar refineries in this 
area, was produced in Canton, along with agricultural equipment. Now 
more attention is being given to production of heavy machinery in this 
region, the completion of a heavy machinery plant in Shao-kuan 
(ChTu-chiang) being scheduled for 1960. 
h. Other Regions  
There was virtually no development of the machine-
building industry in the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region (Region II), 
the Sinkiang Uighur Autonomous Region (Region IX), and Tibet (Region X) 
under the First Five Year Plan. There are no major machine-building 
plants in Tibet, and only a few agricultural equipment plants in the 
Inner Mongolian and the Sinkiang Uighur Autonomous Regions. 
E. Value of Production 
1. Total Industry 
Communist China made impressive progress in total indus-
trial production under the First Five Year Plan (1953-57), the gross. 
value of such production (excluding the handicraft industry) increas-
ing about 133 percent. In 1957 the gross value of total industrial 
production reached 62.8 billion yuan,* an increase of 9.25 billion 
yuan above the goal of 53.5 billion yuan set by the First Five Year 
* See Table 13, Appendix B, p. 96, below.

Plan. The average annual rate of growth in total industrial produc-
tion under the plan was 18.4 percent, or 3.7 percent higher than the 
target of 14.7 percent. Although the average annual rate of growth 
of total industrial production was high, it was uneven, increasing 
sharply in 1956, the year of the high tide of industrialization, and 
declining to about 7 percent in 1957, a year of consolidation and 
restoration of balance. 
2. Machine-Building Industry 
Under the First Five Year Plan, there was a large in-
crease in gross value of production by the metal-processing sector, 
including machinery and equipment manufacturing. The value of pro-
duction by the metal-processing sector in 1957 reached 10 billion 
yuan and accounted for about 3 or 4 percent of the gross national 
product on a basis of value added. Machinery and equipment manu-
facturing, the most Important component of the metal-processing sec-
tor, attained a value of production slightly less than 6 billion 
yuan, representing more than 5 percent of the gross national product. 
From 1952 through 1957 the gross value of production of machinery 
and equipment manufacturing .increased approximately 326 percent. This 
gain exceeds the planned increase of 250 percent for the 5-year 
period. .?2/ The share of the metal-processing sector in total indus-
trial production increased from 11 percent in 1952 to about 16 percent 
in 1956-57, and the share of machinery and equipment manufacturing 
increased from 5 percent in 1952 to almost 10 percent in 1956-57.. 
The average annual rate of growth in machinery and equip-
ment manufacturing under the Five Year Plan was approximately 34 per-
cent. This rate of growth was uneven, increasing to about 90 percent 
in 1956 but declining to about 4 percent in 1957. Such unevenness 
was due to the fact that the ambitious surge forward in industry in 
1956 necessitated some consolidation in 1957 to smooth out imbalances. 
F. Volume and Types of Production 
1. General 
Considerable increases in the volume of production were 
made in several branches of the machine-building industry of Com-
munist China under the First Five Year Plan (1953-57).* Most note-
worthy were the increases in production of machine tools, agricul-
tural equipment, textile machinery, locomotives and rolling stock, 
and electrical equipment. Production of some types of heavy equip-
ment, such as metallurgical equipment, mining equipment, and oilfield

and exploratory equipment, was limited under the First Five Year Plan, 
but capacity to produce will be increased considerably under the 
Second Five Year Plan. In spite of the advances made in production 
by the machine-building industry Sunder the First Five Year Plan, Com-
munist China still lags far behind the advanced industrial nations 
in production of most types of machinery.* Moreover, production of 
most types of machinery in Communist China at the end of the First 
Five Year Plan was considerably lower than that in the USSR at the 
end of the Soviet First Five Year Plan in 1932, although this dif-
ference was due primarily to the fact that Communist China started 
its First Five Year Plan with a much smaller production base than did 
the USSR.** 
The projects of the machine-building industry of Communist 
China actually constructed under the First Five Year Plan were de-
signed not only to augment capacity for producti.on but also to pro-
vide a greater diversity of products. Under the plan both trial 
production and actual production of a considerable number of new 
types of products were undertaken. It should be noted, however, 
that the increase in the number of products manufactured was due 
in large measure to the completion of projects undertaken with aid 
from the Soviet Bloc and, moreover, that the designs for many of 
the new products. were supplied by the Bloc. Approximately 90 per-
cent of the 3,000 new products that the Chinese Communists claim 
have been produced by the machine-building industry since 1953 are 
based on designs provided by the USSR. .?.1./ As production expanded, 
the technical capabilities of Chinese machinery increased.*** 
2. Machine Tools  
The increase in production of machine tools during 1953-57 
was largely due to expansion and reequipping of existing facilities. 
Of the 19 major machine tool plants established by the end of 1957, 
only 3 have been identified as new plants. Other factors contribut-
ing to higher production were Improvements in the productivity of 
labor and Soviet technical assistance. Before 1953, Communist China 
produced only a few types of general-purpose machine tools, most of 
whidh were obsolete. In 1954 and 1955, production in terms of units 
was cut back, and plants shifted to production of heavier and more 
modern types.****

diversification of production by the end of 1957, when the industry 
was producing a few automatic and precision machine tools. These 
new types include single-spindle automatic lathes, transfer machines, 
precision surface-grinding machines, automatic centerless internal 
grinding machines, multitool semiautomatic lathes, and universal 
tool grinders.L.92/ Semiautomatic gear shapers, ball bearing grind-
ing machines, Single-purpose machine tools for production of loco-
motives and for the metallurgical industry; multispindle lathes; 
double-column vertical lathes; and double-housing planers were suc-
cessfully trial produced but had not entered serial production by 
the end of 1958. 
The simultaneous export and shortage of machine tools 
indicates an insufficient range of types and slowness of the indus-
try to expand product mix. !.41_31 Thus the overabundance of machine 
tools experienced by the Chinese Communists in 1957 did not consti-
tute an oversupply of all machine tools but only of the limited 
variety that they produced.* 
The machine-building industry registered few gains in 
heavy machinery. The heaviest machine tool produced in Communist 
China in 1956 weighed about 100 tons. LI" Production of heavy i.-
chine tools tools can increase considerably, however, because of the com-
pletion of the Wu-han Heavy Machine Tool Plant in 1958. Closely 
related to this shortcoming is the lag of the industry in produc-
tion of metalforming machinery. Production of 2,500-ton presses was 
only at the trial stages in 1958. Because metalforming machinery is 
an essential requirement for metalworking processes, it is believed 
that the Chinese Communists will place greater emphasis on this cate-
gory under the Second Five Year P1an'(1958-62). Most of the ma-
chine tools produced in Communist China in 1953-58 were copies of 
Soviet or European Satellite models. Toward the end of the First 
Five Year Plan, however, Chinese engineers were attempting some de-
gree of independent designing. L32/ 
? 
3. Electrical Equipment  
Production of various types of electrical equipment in-
creased considerably under the First Five Year Plan. From 1952 to 
1955, such gains depended for the most part on the greater utiliza-
tion of existing plant facilities. By contrast, additions of 
new capacity were responsible for the rapid advances in production 
after 1955. This new capacity, including both new construction and 
renovation, permitted the goals of the First Five Year Plan for 
turbines, generators, motors, and transformers to be met a year ahead

of schedule. Large investments in Capacity for production of heavy 
turbogeneratbrs were completed in Harbin in 1956 and 1958. The 
construction and renovation that were completed in 1956 at the Harbin 
Power Equipment Plant and the Shanghai Electrical Machinery Plant 
brought the combined annual capacity of these two plants alone to 
240,000 kilowatts (kw) of generators, or double the total capacity 
in 1955. L32/ Marked increases in production of switchgear and wire 
and cable in 1956 were due primarily to the completion of the Mukden 
Low Voltage Switchgear Plant and the Mukden Electric Cable Plant. 
Since 1952, there has been an impressive rise in the 
rated capacity of the most important categories of electrical equip-
ment, as shown in Table 4.* Production is planned for both steam 
and hydraulic turbogenerators with capacities, of up to 100,000 kw 
each in the recently expanded H.rbin Power Equipment Plant. High-
tension transformers with a maximum load of 40,o00 kilovolt-amperes 
(kva) were being produced in 1957. .?.:131 
On completion of expansion about the end of 1955 the 
Mukden Transformer Plant is expected to produce 123,500-kva trans-
formers. fi52 Communist China produces a fairly wide range of elec-
tric motors, including some as large as 1,900 kw for heavy steel 
rolling mills and special types that operate under water and in 
combustible and humid atmospheres. 22/ Numerous types of electric 
instruments now are produced in Communist China. These instruments 
include fuel gauges, water temperature and oil pressure gauges, 
speedometers, and ammeters used by the Chiang-ch'un Automobile Plant 
1 A limited variety of circuit breakers and switchgear was 50X1 
turned out in 1953-57. Nearly all the new models of electrical 
equipment introduced duringthis'period were copied from the Soviet 
or the Satellite models. 
In spite of considerable development in the electrical 
equipment industry, Communist China supplies a relatively low per-
centage of its own requirements.** Moreover, the program for con-
struction of power stations was greatly accelerated in 1958 com-
pared with the rate which prevailed under the First Five Year Plan 
(1953-57). 22/ It is expected that production of heavy electrical 
equipment will lag behind these increasing demands for power genera-
tion under the Second Five Year Plan (1958-62). Plans call for 
domestically produced electrical equipment to fulfill about one-
quarter of the requirements for new hydroelectric capacity and about 
one-half of the requirements for new thermal electric capacity during 
this period. Although the outlook for the supply for power

generating equipment with high capacity improved considerably as the 
result of the expansion of the Harbin Power Equipment Plant in 1958, 
it would require 3 to 5 years to build additional plants to manufac-
ture high-temperature and high-pressure generators of 25,000 kw and 
thermal electric powerplants of more than 500,000 tg 700,000 kw. 96/ 
I. Other Power-Producing Equipment  
Moderate improvements have been made in increasing vol-
ume and variety of production of nonelectrical power-producing equip-
ment, which includes basically diesel engines and boilers. In 1953, 
ComMunist China began to produce 40-hp, high-speed, small-scale 
diesel engines. By the end of 1955, 25 types of diesel engines 
ranging in size from 8 to 400 hp were being produced. There was 
also successful trial production of 165-hp, .a1-71 type, high-speed 
diesel engines for both marine and land use. 22/ Although success-
ful trial production of a 600-hp marine diesel engine, the largest 
diesel engine made in-Communist China, was reported in 1956L serial 
production of this type of engine has not been confirmed. 21Y In 1958, 
trial production of the first 450-hp diesel engine produced in Com-
munist China was completed. It is now planned that both 1,200-hp 
and 2,000-hp diesel engines will be produced by 1961. 22/ 
Most of the diesel engines produced in Communist China 
were patterned after Soviet or European Satellite models. For 
exanple, the designs for the 600-hp marine diesel engine were based 
on Czechoslovak and other data. 100/ The 90-hp diesel engine pro-
duced at the Tsinan Diesel Engine Plant is a copy of the Czechoslovak 
Skoda model 4S160. 101/ In spite of the use of foreign technical 
designs, the performance of Chinese engines has not always been up 
to standard. Moreover, the Chinese have encountered serious problems 
with regard to adequate fuel'supplies.* 
New types of boilers also were produced under the First 
Five Year Plan. Late in 1956 the major producing plant at Harbin 
ssuccessfully produced a boiler with a steam-raising capacity of 
35 tons per hour. 102/ A year later, this plant completed a medium-
pressure boiler with a capacity of 130 tons per hour. 
5. Agricultural Machinery 
The Peking regime placed considerable emphasis on in-
creasing production of agricultural machinery to supply the material 
basis for the implementation of collectivization. Increases in pro-
duction during 1952-56 were based on a fairly sizable program of

reconstruction and expansion.. In addition to the major agricultural 
equipment plants, numerous handicraft cooperatives and small work-
shops made an important contribution. Production by individual plants 
was small but loomed large in the aggregate, especially in the pro-
duction of traditional types of such hand Implements as spades, 
rakes, scythes, picks, and hoes. Included in the total number of 
units produced during 1950-57 were 2,023,000 two-wheel, one-bottom 
and two-bottom plows; 1,950,000 walking plows; 1,790,000 waterwheels; 
85,000 discs; 43,000 rollers; 64,000 drills; 457,000 cultivators; 
19,000 horse-drawn harvesters; 454,000 rice threshers; 3,200,000 hand 
sprayers; more than 530,000 hp of irrigation pumps; and other items. 
Drawing heavily on Soviet experience, the Chinese Com-
munists pressed the development of equipment for use with tractors 
before 1958. Such tractor-drawn machines included five-bottom and 
three-bottom plows, cotton seeders, 24-row and 48-row seed drills, 
cultivators, grain combines, disc harrows, three-bar mowers, and 
fertilizer spreaders. Besides being heavily dependent on a high 
level of mechanization that did not materialize during 1953-57, a 
number of these Soviet types of machines proved to be entirely un-
suitable to Chinese soil and topographical conditions.- This factor, 
combined with overproduction in 1956 and inadequate attention to the 
popularization of the new equipment, led to severe cutbacks in pro-
duction in 1957. 
In its effort to supply machinery suitable to the agri-
cultural conditions in all areas, the Peking regime continues to de-
velop new varieties of products. 104/ These products include paddy-
rice harvesters, cotton-planting machines, fertilizer-spreading 
carts, and new models of combine grain harvesters. 105/ The "leap 
forward" campaign of 1958 stressed the stimulation of initiative to 
turn out simple agricultural equipment suitable for local needs. 
Current plans call for a shift in emphasis from mechanized farming 
to production of drainage and irrigation equipment, along with the 
rapid expansion of production of chemical fertilizers. With some 
rearrangements of facilities, production of pumps can be increased 
considerably. The main problem is the motive power to be used for 
the pumps. Electrical equipment plants can turn out numerous light 
electric motors for irrigation, but this approach requires vast im-
provement in rural electrification. Because of limitations in fuel 
supply, diesel engines cannot be used extensively. Production of 
coal-gas and other engines using local fuels, now being rushed, prob-
ably will have significant effects in a relatively short time.

6. Tractors  
Extensive investments in new facilities for production 
of tractors were made under the First Five Year Plan. 
ties comprise the large, new Lo-yang Tractor Plant completed 50X1 
in 1959, and the expansion, begun in 1957, of the Tientsin Tractor 
Plant. The Lo-yang plant, although still unfinished, with less than 
4o percent of its equipment installed, turned out its first proto-
type 54-hp diesel crawler tractor in July 1958.* 107/ The Tientsin 
plant produced the first Chinese Communist tractor, the T-240, pat-
terned after the Soviet "Belarus," in April 1958. 108/ 
No tractors were produced until 1958, when 957 units 
were produced. Plans for 1959 call for production of 3,000 trac-
tors. 109/ The Tientsin plant was scheduled to produce 150 tractors 
in 1958 and may have a maximum capacity of 13,000 units per year. 110/ 
Originally designed to produce only the 54-hp crawler tractor at the 
rate of 15,000 units annually, the Lo-yang plant now is said to have 
the capacity for producing annually 30,000 units of various types, 
including smaller multipurpose types. 111/ During the hectic "leap 
forward" campaign of 1958, it was reported that tractors were being 
produced at numerous smaller plants throughout China. This claim is 
highly suspect. Only a few of these tractors are believed to be 
genuine Chinese products, the others probably being superficially 
altered foreign tractors or tractors hastily assembled from parts of 
inoperative machines. 
These facili-
7. Automotive Transport Equipment  
Production of trucks began in 1956 with  the completion 
of the gigantic Ch'ang-ch'un Automobile Plant  which is still 50X1 
the only important producer in Communist China. This plant produces 
the 4-ton, 6-cylinder, 90-hp, "Liberation" model** patterned after 
the Soviet ZIL-150. During the first 2 years of operation of the 
plant, only a stake-body type of truck was produced, but during 1958 
several new versions were introduced. These versions included 4-ton 
cross-country trucks, model SA-40 dump trucks, and trucks equipp'ed 
with gas-generator units as substitutes for gasoline engines. In 
addition, "Liberation" chassis have been fitted with bus bodies to 
produce buses of roughly the same configuration and capacity as US 
school buses.

The production capacity of the Ch'ang-ch'un plant was 
originally rated at 30,000 trucks annually on a two-shift basis, ac-
cording to Soviet planning norms. In April 1958, as the "leap 
forward" campaign gathered momentum, capacity was determined to be 
70,000 units. 112/ Finally, it was reported in November 1958 that 
capacity for annual production could be raised_ to the fantastically 
high level of 150,000 vehicles in 1959 with an additional investment 
of 40 million yuan. 113/ Apart from this investment, which appears 
to be extremely small, the foundation of the claim of 150,000 trucks 
per year is not known. Although the maximum capabilities of the 
plant are believed to have been considerably underestimated by Soviet 
engineers, 114/ its known machinery park, particularly the 3,500-ton 
press imported from the USSR, suggests an annual capacity of not 
more than 60,000 vehicles. 
The Ch'ang-ch'un plant has experienced continued diffi-
culty in procuring adequate supplies of materials. During 1957 and 
most of 1958, there were critical shortages of cold-rolled steel 
and steel alloys. 115/ In early 1957 the plant was operating only 
in the morning on less than one shift a day. 116/ At that time, 
46 percent of the steel required for production of trucks could not 
be produced domestically. 117/ The Chinese Communists, therefore, 
attempted to remedy the situation by importing cold-rolled steel 
from the West and by experimenting with substitute materials which 
could be produced domestically. Because only a few of the approxi-
mately 200 types of metal needed to produce a truck were available 
in Communist China, the regime has depended on the USSR to supply 
most of the remainder. It is believed that Soviet deliveries have 
been irregular and at high prices. 118/ That the goal of producing 
7,000 trucks in 1957 was fulfilled may indicate that the regime in-
curred further financial loss to increase imports of the necessary 
materials rather than suffer the "loss of face" resulting from failure 
to meet the goal for this important item. By the end of 1958 the 
shortages of rolled steel and alloys were still restricting the rate 
of production at the Ch'ang-ch'un plant, but the situation probably 
was less critical than in the early months of 1957. 119/ Neverthe-
less, the plant remains completely dependent on foreign sources for 
at least a few essential materials.* 
Production of other types of motor vehicles is not of 
great significance. About 500 three-wheel trucks with a capacity 
of 1 to 1.5 tons each were produced in Shanghai in 1958. Shanghai 
also turns out a number of jeeps similar to those produced in the US.

A few trial models of passenger automobiles were produced in 1958. 
A trial model of the "East Wind" six-seater passenger automobile, 
which bears a striking resemblance to the Soviet "Volga" model, was 
assembled at the Chlang-ch'un plant. The sudden appearance in 1958 
of a passenger automobile industry, which as of 1957 was not scheduled 
to produce its first automobile until about 1962, is regarded with 
suspicion. It is believed that these automobiles were produced 
mainly for purposes of prestige, with little prospect for serial 
production j.n the near future. Designs for a second large motor 
vehicle plant, to be located in Wu-han, were completed in 1958, but 
construction has not yet been undertaken. 
Chinese Communist capabilities for producing motor 
? vehicles are reasonably satisfactory. There is capacity available 
at the main truck plant for large increases in production, so that 
by 1962 Communist China should be able to fill a large share of its 
requirements.* 
8. Railroad Transport Equipment  
There were sizable increases in production of locomotives 
and rolling stock under the First Five Year Plan of Communist China.** 
These increases resulted from the reconstruction and expansion of 
existing facilities and from increased efficiency. Since 1950 the 
number of plants engaged in production of railroad equipment has 
varied from year to year, depending on the needs of the economy. 
The main producing plants, which were under the jurisdiction of the 
First Ministry of Machine Building, accounted for all the locomotives 
and about 70 percent of the freight cars produced during 1949-57. 
The remaining freight cars were produced by various repair plants 
subordinate to the Ministry of Railroads. 
Cumulative production of mainline steam locomotives and 
freight cars in 1953-57 fell slightly below the planned levels of 
571 locomotives and 35,000 cars. Existing locomotive plants are being 
expanded, however, and a new one under construction at Ta-t'ung has a 
capacity of 400 units, which is more than twice the total national pro-
duction in 1956. Reconstruction and expansion will increase the ca-
pacity of the Dairen Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant to 270 units. 
Thus by 1960 these two plants alone will have a minimum capacity for 
annual production of 670 units, more than enough to meet estimated 
requirements for mainline steam locomotives through 1962. Two plants 
producing freight Ars are being expanded and production is expected 
to increase substantially thereafter. A new plant that can produce

500 railroad passenger cars per year is under construction at Ch'ang-
ch'un. The Chinese Communists consider passenger traffic of minor 
importance, however, and it is believed that they do not intend to 
produce passenger cars on a significant scale in relation to produc-
tion of freight cars. 
Communist China produces a considerable variety of main-
line railroad equipment. In 1956 the following types were being pro-
duced: Mikado No. 1 freight steam locomotives, soft-seat and hard-
seat passenger and sleeping cars, mail cars, 50-ton gondolas, boxcars, 
hopper cars, oil-tank cars, acid-tank cars, and refrigerator cars. 
During 1956, production of 1-5-1 freight steam locomotives and 
Pacific-6 passenger steam locomotives was undertaken. 
The Chinese produced their first mainline diesel loco-
motive in 1958. Plans call for production of 200 diesel locomotives, 
as well as 2,000 steam locomotives, during the period 1958-62. No 
data is given for the planned production of electric locomotives. 
Although such locomotives could be used profitably in Northwest and 
Southwest China, they probably will be produced only to a limited 
extent during 1958-62. During this period, Communist China will 
produce most of its steam locomotives, while importing some diesel 
and electric locomotives from the Soviet Bloc and the West. Imports 
of passenger cars, special-purpose freiglit cars, particularly re-
frigerator cars, and narrow-gauge equipment probably will continue 
but will become less significant as domestic production increases. 
9. Metallurgical Equipment  
Production of metallurgical equipment under the First 
Five Year Plan of Communist China was very small and the range of 
products limited. Some progress was made in producing equipment 
for ore crushing and ore dressing, iron and steel smelting, and 
coking. 121/ The first blast furnaces with capacities of 1,000 
cubic meters each and open hearth furnaces with capacities of 185 
tons each were turned out by the end of 1957. 122/ Although Com-
munist China was able to meet about 40 percent of its requirements 
for smelting equipment, rolling mill equipment remained a critical 
deficiency.* By the end of the Second Five Year Plan (1958-62), 
when heavy machinery plants at T'ai-yuan and Fu-la-er-chi are to be 
completed, the prospects for supplies of rolling mill equipment are 
expected to be improved considerably. For the immediate future, 
Communist China cannot produce oxygen-making equipment or the neces-
sary power equipment for the oxygen-smelting process of converter 
furnaces.

10. Mining Machinery 
Starting with production of small, simple mining machinery 
in 1952, the Chinese Communists have gradually progressed to the pro-
duction of more complicated types. Various types of machinery pro-
duced under the First Five Year Plan include a Soviet model of a 
coal-loading machine, mechanical conveyors, coal-washing equipment, 
and drilling machines. 123/ Trial production of such heavy mining 
machinery as "Donbass" coal combines, rock loaders, and electric 
coal loaders reportedly took place during 1952-55, but it is doubt-
ful that serial production was undertaken by the end of 1957. 124/ 
Neither the volume of production nor the range of prod-
ucts was adequate for the extensive mining operations of Communist 
China. In October 1956, Chen Yu, Minister of the Coal Industry, com-
plained that the country had neither sufficient large electric 
shovels and electric locomotives for open-cut-coal mines nor other 
types of equipment needed for coal shafts. 125/ Although trial pro-
duction of the first Chinese electric mine locomotive took place in 
1958, Communist China must rely on imports of this commodity for 
some time. Very significant improvement in the volume and variety 
of production of heavy mining machinery is expected by the end of 
the Second Five Year Plan as a result of the completion of the Lo-yang 
Mining Machinery Plant in 1958. 
New hydraulic mining techniques, which are now being 
promoted, may require new types of machinery. The T'ang-shan Coal 
Science Institute is designing special water pumps and studying needs 
for new machinery for water removal. 
11. Oilfield and Exploratory Equipment  
Under the First Five Year Plan, Communist China de-
pended heavily on the USSR and Rumania for oil-drilling equip-
ment.* Although several plants in Shanghai were organized to pro-
duce drills, roller bits, sets of joints, and gate valves for oil 
pipelines and an oil-drilling machine capable of boring 1,200 meters, 
the level of production was not significant.** 126/ Since the com-
pletion of the Sian Geophysical Instruments Repair and Manufacturing 
Plant in 1956 the supply of geological surveying equipment for the 
petroleum industry probably has been fairly adequate. A hew petro-
leum machinery plant in Lan-chou, which was to be completed in 1959, 
will enhance the presently limited capacity of China for.producing 
drilling and refining equipment*** to support the present extensive

exploration for oil. Because of Chinese inexperience, however, several 
years must elapse before the new capacity is fully exploited. It is 
estimated, therefore, that a significant increase in production will 
not be realized before 1961. 
12. Textile Machinery 
The development of the textile machinery industry to the 
point of making Communist China virtually self-sufficient in such 
equipment represents a notable achievement in machine building. Al-
though there were a number of plants in operation before 1949, the 
machine-building industry succeeded in turning out many new types of 
machinery, the more significant advances occurring since 1953. 127/ 
Substantial gains in production were obtained by consolidating small 
machine shops into state-owned or state-managed plants.* Moreover, 
the effort to increase production was greatly facilitated by the 
availability of a labor force familiar with the repair and produc-
tion of textile machinery. Production was uneven during 1952-57, 
having increased sharply in 1954, when the new Ching-wei Textile 
Machinery Plant, the largest and most modern in China, went into 
operation, and declined about 38 percent in 1955 because of a poor 
cotton crop. A similar decline occurred in 1957, probably because 
of overproduction in 1956 that satisfied a portion of the needs for 
new construction in 1957. 
Although Communist China has achieved self-sufficiency 
in most cotton textile machinery and has exported complete sets of 
this machinery to underdeveloped countries, it continues to import 
other types of textile machinery. 128/ For example, during 1957-58, 
Communist China ordered dyeing and finishing machines and wool tex-
tile equipment from the UK. 129/ Present, plans call for the attain-
ment of self-sufficiency in all types of textile machinery in 1960-61. 130/ 
Substantial progress has been made in producing automatic silk looms, 
but there has been little development of machinery for production of 
fabrics from artificial fibers. 131/ 
G. Labor Force and Productivity  
By the end of 1957, there were 1,760,000 workers and employees 
in the metal-processing sector of the machine-building industry of 
Communist China. This number is roughly 27 percent of the labor force 
employed in machine building and metalworking in the USSR. 132/ 
Under the First Five Year Plan (1953-57), more than 900,000 new 
* The development and production of textile machinery is under the 
jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Textile Industry rather than the 
First Ministry of Machine Building.

workers were employed in the metal-processing sector, a doubling of 
the worker force,* and the relative importance of metal processing 
as an employer of industrial labor increased significantly. Never-
theless, nonagricultural occupations, including machine building, 
absorbed only a small part of the total increase in population dur-
ing 1953-57.** 133/ 
Under the impetus of general economic recovery and acceler-
ated investment, productivity per worker nearly doubled between 1952 
and 1956.*** However, because of short-run cutbacks in production 
and underutilization of capacity resulting primarily from shortages 
of raw materials, productivity declined in 1957. (See Figure 1.****) 
H. Problems of Production  
1. Underutilization of Capacity -- SyMptoms and Causes  
By the end of 1957, grave disproportions had developed 
in the economic growth of Communist China. These disproportions were 
particularly accentuated after the upsurge of production in 1956. 
The extremely rapid development of machine building in relation to 
other industries and sectors created imbalances in the demand for 
products and the supply of raw materials that intensified the prob-
lem of underutilization in 1957 in such industrial sectors as those 
producing trucks, locomotives, freight cars, small and medium diesel 
engines, machine tools, deep-drilling machines, agricultural machin-
ery, textile machinery, steam boilers, electric motors, and trans-
formers. The First Ministry of Machine Buildingt planned production 
valued at 2.31 billion yuan in 1957, but production valued at 3 bil-
lion yuan could have been attained, according to official statements, 
if plants had been able to operate at full capacity. Thus about 
23 percent of the capacity for production of these sectors of the 
machine-building industry was not utilized in 1957. 134/ Accentua-
tion of the problem of latent capacity is illustrated in the rate 
of utilization of metal-cutting machine tools in enterprises of the 
First Ministry of Machine Building, as shown in the following tabu-
lation 135/:

Factors which contributed to these difficulties are discussed in the

2. Shortages of Raw Materials  
One of the most serious manifestations of disproportions 
in the industrial growth of Communist China was the widespread short-
age of raw materials. In 1955, about 66 percent of total machine 
stoppage time was attributable to "no work," meaning lack of raw ma-
terials for the most part. The comparable figure for 1956 was 61 
percent. 136/ An even higher rate of stoppage because of shortages of 
materials in 1957 is probable. In addition, shortages of electric 
power appeared in a number of important industrial areas. Such 
shortages of materials and power were caused by errors in planning 
connected with the speed-up in the program for construction in 1956. 
The planners apparently failed to recognize the full impact on re-
sources that would come about as construction was accelerated and as 
140 new plants and mines began operation in 1956. The target for 
capital construction had been set too high in 1956, calling for ex-
cessive investment expenditures of 1.5 billion to 2.0 billion yuan, 
which required additional supplies of 375,000 to 500,000 tons of 
steel. In addition, about 150,000 tons of steel were wasted in 1956 
in the overproduction of farm implements that were not suited to 
Chinese agriculture. 137/ 
The basic reason for these shortages of raw materials was 
the fact that the new machine-building plants which emerged toward 
the end of the period 1953-57 caused a shift in the pattern as well 
as an increase in the volume of demand. The inadequate development 
of facilities for mining and dressing ore acted as a brake on fur-
ther expansion of production in the iron and steel industries. Al-
though significant advances had been made in production of rolled 
steel, the iron and steel industry was unable to supply the increas-
ing variety of steel required by the advancing technological level 
of Chinese Communist industry. 138/ For example, there were particu-
larly acute shortages of boiler steel plates, cold-rolled steel 
plates, large steel products, and alloy steel products. 139/

S-E-C-R-E-T 
Thus the shortage of raw materials was not of a tempo-
rary nature. Moreover, trade adjustments could not cope with the 
problem adequately, although they could have been better managed. 
Under the First Five Year Plan (1953-57), it was possible in many 
instances to satisfy demand for steel by supplementing domestic 
production with imports. During 1953-55 the supply and demand for 
steel generally was balanced through large imports of both steel 
materials and machine equipment; and although supplies of some goods 
(for example, medium plate) did not satisfy demand in these years 
and there were slight surpluses of certain goods (for example, small-
scale steel materials), both state reserves and stockpiles increased 
each year. In 1956, however, shortages of raw materials became ex-
tremely critical because of the particularly rapid increase in machine 
building and in investment in capital construction. The result was 
a greater increase in the demand for steel than in production of 
steel, while at the same time imports of steel dropped and exports 
increased. 140/ 
The machine-building industry of Communist China accounted 
for approximately 25 percent of the total demand for steel in 1953-55 
and approximately 30 percent in 1956-57. This percentage is very low 
compared with that of industrially advanced countries and is perhaps 
typical for an underdeveloped country beginning the process of indus-
tria3ization. In the USSR the machine-building industry for many 
years has accounted for about 40 percent of the total demand for 
steel. In the US this percentage was between 35 and 37 percent an-
nually from 1947 to 1954, and in Japan it was about 39 percent from 
1936 to 1940. The main reason for the lower percentage in China is 
that under the First Five Year Plan a great deal of. machinery was 
imported, while at the same time large basic construction resulted in 
relatively large allocations of steel for building and installation 
and a correspondingly low allocation of steel for processing in the 
machine-building industry. 141/ As more industrial projects for the 
'machine-building industry were brought to completion in 1956-57 the 
demand for steel for actual processing increased rapidly. 
The abrupt changes in the balance between the machine-
building industry as a consumer of raw materials and those segments 
of the economy producing raw materials and power are reflected in 
the comparative rates of growth for the machine-building, steel, 
and electric power industries. Indexes of production by these in-
dustries in 1952-57 are shown in Table 5.*

a. Data are based on value of production, as shown in Table 13, 
Appendix B, p. 96, below. 
b. Data are based on volume of production 
As shown in Table 5, the growth of the machine-building 
industry of Communist China was in fairly even balance with that of. 
'crude steel and finished steel through 1955, which coincided with a 
fairly even distribution of steel products between transportation, 
construction, and machine building. The disproportionate advance of 
machine building in 1956 disturbed this balance and caused widespread 
shifts in the allocation of steel products. As a consequence, in-
vestment in the machine-building industry was cut back in 1957. It 
was also planned to cut back production somewhat, but this plan did 
not materialize. The rapid expansion of machine building, howevery 
was brought practically to a standstill, thus affording time for the 
iron and steel industries to catch up partly, so that by the end of 
1957 a better balance was restored. The disproportionate increase 
in production by the machine-building industry in 1957 was greater 
when compared with that of crude steel and less when compared with 
that of finished steel.*. 
The index of production by the electric power industry 
of Communist China shows a consistent lag behind that for the major 
* Because finished steel includes some recirculated scrap, it is 
believed that the comparison between machine building and crude steel 
is more meaningful. Moreover, there is firm evidence from official 
sources that figures for finished steel involve some double-counting 
of billets and therefore show an unduly favorable comparison with 
machine building. 143/ The extent of the distortion is not known.

consuming industries. It was reported that in 1956 a total of 23 
industrial districts were not receiving adequate power, the more 
important districts being Peking-Tientsin-T'ang-shan, Tsinan, Sian, 
Cheng-Chou, Ch'eng-tu, Chungking, and Canton. 144/ For strategic 
reasons the Chinese decided to build up industries in the interior 
and, according to a Communist economic journal, it was expected that 
one-half of the country would be faced with a shortage of power by 
the end of 1957. 145/ At the end of 1958 the shortage of power in 
industrially important Northeast China was severe. The iron and 
steel industry and the machine-building industry, followed by the 
chemical industry, were given priority in the consumption of elec-
tricity. Nevertheless, in spite of strict rationing, these same 
industries suffered reductions in production. 146/  
 many of the older 
and most important industrial areas, where shortages of power have 
been acute and Where there is the greatest capacity for adjusting 
power load through grid systems. The shortages, however, have not 
been quite uniform throughout China. In some inland areas, for 
example, the expansion of electric-generating capacity has actually 
kept ahead of industrial requirements, and there is concern that a 
shift in economic policy toward greater dependence on existing indus-
trial bases will result in underutilization of this capacity. Never-
theless, shortages of power in the major industrial areas remain one 
of the most serious hindrances to economic growth.

The estimates of 5.33 tons and 1.4 tons in this tabulation imply an 
annual requirement for the machine-building industry as a whole of 
1,615,000 tons of ferrous metals, including 424,000 tons of finished 
steel products.* Statistics for the latter part of the First Five 
Year Plan indicate that the machine-building industry required 1.5 
tons of rolled steel per 10,000 yuan of finished machinery products, 
or about 450,000 to 900,000 tons annually. 149/ 
The critical shortage of raw materials has had signifi-
cant repercussions in plans for the machine-building industry and 
is believed to have caused the reduction of investments in certain 
less essential machine-building plants in early 1957. For example, 
investments in the construction of the Tientsin Tractor Plant and 
the Peking Lathe Plant were suspended, and those in the Lo-yang 
Tractor Plant and Wu-han Heavy Machine Tool Plant were re-
duced. 150/ During 1953-56, more investment had been allocated to 
machine building than to the steel industry. In view of the scar-
city of iron and steel and the existence of considerable latent 
capacity in the machine-building industry, it was decided that in 
the plans for 1957 the allocation of investment should favor pro-
duction of steel at the expense of machine building. 151/ 
Shortages of raw materials persisted in 1957 in spite of 
these corrective measures. In August 1957, it was announced that 
investments in capital construction in the machine-building industry 
would be reduced in 1958 compared with 1957 and that the vigorous 
development of industries producing raw materials, fuel, and electric 
power would be stressed.** 
3. Limitations in Capacity to Absorb Domestically 
Produced Machinery  
Underutilization of productive capacity in the machine-
building industry of Communist China also was caused by the inability 
of the economy to absorb the maximum production of some machinery 
products. Plants producing lines such as small- and medium-size diesel 
engines, some types of metal-cutting machine tools, deep-drilling ma-
chines, agricultural machinery, textile machinery, steam boilers, and 
electric motors and transformers either did not operate at capacity 
or, as a consequence of overproduction, were forced to curtail pro-
duction. 1.52/ Factors which contributed to this development are 
discussed below. 
* For the value data for the machine-building industry on which 
this estimate was based, see Table 13, Appendix B, p. 96, below.

Plan in IV, B, 1, p. 65, below.

a. Limitations in Product Mix  
The capacity of the machine-building industry to 
produce ordinary low-grade equipment is comparatively large and, in 
some instances, actually exceeds national requirements. At the same 
time, Chinese plants are weak in the techniques and facilities neces-
sary for production of the large, complicated machinery required for 
the program of capital construction. As a result, the economy was 
unable to utilize fully the existing capabilities of the industry, 
while the industry could not meet the requirements of the industriali-
zation program, thus necessitating heavy imports to supply the short-
age. For the most part, the development of new products was slow 
under the First Five Year Plan (1953-57). 
b. Low Priority for A.griculture and Light Industry 
In the formulation of the First Five Year Plan, 
Chinese Communist planners paid lip service to the interdependence 
of heavy industry, light industry, and agriculture. Relatively lit-
tle investment, however, actually was allocated to these sectors . 
during the plan period. Consequently, the Peking regime made only 
limited concessions to the needs of agriculture and light industry 
for machinery and equipment. Notwithstanding the fact that the 
economy was nearly totally planned and therefore had complete con-
trol of supply and demand, the policy of slighting investment in 
agriculture and light industry may have been somewhat self-defeating. 
In view of the economic Importance of these sectors, their potential 
as outlets for machinery is considerable. There might have been 
less of a problem of overproduction in certain low-grade lines of 
products if agriculture and light industry had been allocated more 
investment to absorb machinery under the First Five Year Plan. In 
1957 the Peking regime became genuinely concerned about the lag in 
agricultural growth. In a general reaffirmation of the importance 
of agriculture, the regime rediscovered (1) its heavy dependence on 
this slowly growing sector, both as a source of capital for invest-
ment and as a market for the products of heavy industry, and (2) the 
necessity of accelerating the development of agriculture in order to 
avoid retarding the program for industrialization. 153/ These points 
were stressed by Mao Tse-tung in his famous speech on "contradic-
tions." 154/ 
In some cases, declines in the demand for machin6ry 
reflected not a reduction in the absolute level of production in con-
suming industries but rather a cessation or decline in the rate of 
growth of these industries. For example, periodic failures of crops 
necessitated a reduction in the rate of increase in production of 
textiles. The decline in production of textiles, in turn, reduced

the demand for textile machinery for purposes of expansion. In 1953, 
1955, and 1957, production of cotton-spinning machinery actually 
fell below the level of the previous years, and in 1955 and 1957 the 
same was true for production of cotton looms.* Diesel engines are 
a somewhat analogous case. Because of the shortage of diesel fuel 
and the high cost of imported fuel, diesel engines cannot be widely 
used. 155/ 
The Peking regime has shown a marked tendency to 
export capital equipment that cannot be absorbed readily by the 
economy. That Communist China, a country poor in capital, should 
export machinery produced at a high cost and sell it probably at a 
loss is a measure of the fundamental dislocations and failures of 
planning within its economy. 
c. Excessive Use of Foreign Equipment  
The considerable underutilization of capacity in 
the machine-building industry of Communist China during 1957 was 
attributed in part to discrimination in favor of foreign equipment, 
which resulted in an insufficiency of orders for domestic plants. 156/ 
Since early 1957 the Chinese Communists have expressed increasing 
dissatisfaction with the results of heavy dependence on Soviet advice 
and rigid adherence to Soviet designs. This policy caused excessive 
demand for imported equipment, which placed an additional strain on 
the Chinese balance of payments. Toward the end of the First Five 
Year Plan, reliance on imported capital goods actually conflicted 
with the development of markets for domestic machinery. 157/ 
A number of factors contributed to the excessive de-
mand for Soviet capital equipment. The very fact that the Chinese 
Communists sought a rapid advance to the highest technical levels 
meant that the productive possibilities of the existing plants, most 
of which were at a very low technical level, were neglected. 158/ 
Moreover, the Chinese Communists themselves admit that they "over-
stressed specialization and regularization," 159/ indicating that 
the failure to make full use of domestic machinery was attributable 
in part to rigidity in the application of Soviet industrial specifi-
cations, which called for highly specialized techniques and standard-
ized equipment. In addition, the presence of Soviet advisers through-
out the planning hierarchy naturally encouraged the use of Soviet ma-
chines and techniques. Another factor tending to increase the use of 
Soviet capital equipment is the fact that Chinese planners borrowed 
such Soviet planning aids as productivity norms for machinery. Be-
cause these indexes were based on Soviet equipment, the Chinese

probably desired that Soviet equipment be used for the sake of 
standardization. 160/ Finally, there was a strong preference on 
the part of some Chinese planners for foreign, particularly Soviet, 
equipment and a lack of faith in the quality of the domestic substi-
tute. 161/ 
4. Limited Capability for Independent Designing 
The effects of limitations in the product mix were aggra-
vated because of the inability of the machine-building industry of 
,Communist China to respond to changing needs for new types of equip-
ment. It is also possible that Chinese Communist planners overesti-
mated the capacity of agriculture and light industry to absorb the 
types of machinery and thus could have selected too large a scale of 
production. Much inflexibility, however, was built into facilities 
for production as the result of too much stress on specialization, 
adherence to Soviet designs, and reliance on Soviet specialized 
equipment. A number of machine-building plants were designed to 
produce only one product or a limited range of products. It was 
found, however, that a considerable variety of such items as agri-
cultural machinery and machine tools were needed to satisfy the 
diverse needs of such a large area as mainland China and that the 
limits of the market for any one type soon were reached. A major 
problem in production arose because the Chinese went directly into 
large-scale production of certain items before they had improved 
their capabilities for independent designing. Otherwise, their pro-
duction system would have had greater flexibility, which would have 
permitted, as a matter of course, shifts from model to model or even 
to production of other items as temporary imbalances occurred. 
Before 1949, both the level of production and the tech-
nology of the machine-building industry were low. As the result of 
extensive aid from the Soviet Bloc, however, Chinese technical capa-
bilities have gradually improved. One of the goals of Communist 
China was to manufacture machinery suitable to the land and people. 
Insofar as possible, this goal was to have been accomplished by using 
materials produced by the Chinese in machinery designed by themselves. 
In practice, however, the Chinese produced or designed important ma-
chinery and equipment by adopting the specifications established by 
the Soviet Bloc or requested these countries to do the designing. Not 
only was time wasted but also very often the equipment was unsuited 
for conditions in China.

The machine-building industry of Communist China is not 
in a satisfactory position with respect to designing its own ma-
chinery and adapting foreign machinery to Chinese conditions. Tech-
nical designing has begun to emerge from a period of imitation, but 
the process is a slow one. The present limited capability for in-
dependent designing constitutes a serious handicap in undertaking pro-
duction of heavy and precision machinery. Furthermore, the transi-
tion is made more difficult because confidence in the previous guide 
to technical progress, the example df economic development in the 
USSR, has been shaken by the difficulties experienced in applying 
Soviet techniques to the peculiar conditions in China. 
5. Shortage of Skilled Labor  
When the Peking regime launched the program of industrial-
ization, it was immediately apparent that one of the most serious 
obstacles would be the shortage of skilled workers and technicians. 
Plans for large-scale economic construction demanded technical skills 
that were extremely scarce. The rapid influx of new workers into 
the machine-building industry during 1953-57 presented a very serious 
training problem.* The Chinese Communist stress on advanced tech-
nology required highly skilled workers -- although in relatively small 
numbers -- and training was facilitated by wholesale imitation of 
Soviet technology. 
To overcome the general shortage of skilled and technical 
manpower, the Chinese Communists used foreign technical assistance, 
a system of strict allocation of available technicians, intensive 
on-the-job training, and a greatly expanded educational program. 164/ 
The First Five Year Plan (1953-57) called for an admittedly inade-
quate_but relatively ambitious increase of 174,000 in the number of 
specialists and skilled workers in machine building. 165/ In spite 
of these measures, however, the level of technical experience was 
still low at the end of 1957. This problem is one of the main fac-
tors restricting the expansion of production of heavy-duty and pre-
cision machinery. 166/ Moreover, the inexperience of the labor

force -- along with poor management and excessive pressure onplant 
personnel to reach and exceed the high goals for production -- has 
contributed to the faulty Maintenance of equipment observed in many 
machine-building plants. 167/ 
6. Low Quality 
Although the Chinese Communists achieved noteworthy 
increases in the volume of production of machinery and equipment 
under the First Five Year Plan, the quality of production often 
was below standard. This is not to say that all the machinery and 
equipment produced in Communist China during this period was of 
poor quality, but the need to improve quality was so great that it 
was often stated by the Chinese themselves to be one of the most 
serious problems in the machine industry. 
The inferior quality of machinery and equipment may be 
attributed to the following factors: 
a. Lack of emphasis on quality. Much emphasis was 
given to the fulfillment of quotas for volume and value of production 
and to production of new types of machinery and equipment, but very 
little emphasis was given to the quality of products. 
b. Lack of standards for quality. In many instances, 
there was a failure to specify accurately and clearly the standards 
and technical requirements for the products. 
c. Insufficient research. Many plants allowed 
full-scale manufacture of products without adequate research and 
development, with the result that products failed to meet standard 
specifications. 
d. Poor inspection. Although there are inspection 
sections in the plants, there has been a serious shortage of quali-
fied inspectors. 168/ 
e. Poor quality of raw materials. In some cases 
the raw materials used were of poor quality and resulted in inferior 
finished products. 169/ 
The Chinese Communists have become increasingly aware of 
the need for improving the quality of the machinery and equipment that 
they produced. Numerous statements have been made by Chinese leaders 
on the importance of improving quality. ? In 1957 it was reported that 
the idle time of workers resulting from the shortage of raw materials 
would be spent on improvements in quality. 170/. Moreover, it is

reasonable to assume that the experience gained in machine building 
under the First Five Year Plan will aid in improving quality in 
future production. On the other hand, serious shortages of raw ma-
terials and the use of inferior substitute materials probably will 
continue to be a major problem in any attempt to improve the quality 
of machinery and equipment. 
III. Evaluation of the Machine-Building Industry (1953-57)  
A. Progress Toward Chosen Objectives  
In terms of the objectives to which Chinese Communist leaders 
dedicated themselves,* the progress of the machine-building indus-
try under the First Five Year Plan was gratifying. Through heavy 
investments in large, modern plants the Chinese Communists had greatly 
enhanced their prestige and military power, had accelerated economic 
growth, had markedly improved their economic independence, and had 
provided a stronger material base for the consolidation of political 
Controls over Chinese society. Although the Chinese mainland still 
was predominantly agrarian, the advance toward an industrialized 
society in the short span of 5 years was unprecedented. Thus the 
decision to give priority to the development of heavy industry ap-
peared to be amply vindicated. Even though this investment policy 
has been largely responsible for the lag in agricultural growth, it 
remains a firmly fixed principle of the regime. Recently, however, 
adjustments have been made to increase support to agriculture by 
heavy industry.** 
B. Detrimental Effects of the Pattern of Development  
Notwithstanding the positive results of Chinese Communist 
decisions on investment, the manner in Which the development program 
was carried out had certain detrimental effects on the economy as a 
whole. These effects are particularly noteworthy because they re-
veal important reasons for the drastic shifts in economic policy 
under the Second Five Year Plan.*** 
Instead of allocating adequate resources for investment in 
quick-yielding projects, the Chinese concentrated almost entirely 
on slow-yielding investments in large-scale heavy industrial 
plants.**** In addition, uncoordinated planning of the timing of 
the completion of investment projects in subsidiary and related in-
dustries often made it Impossible to make full use of completed

facilities. Such uncoordinated planning has taken place in the machine-
building industry of Communist China, where, fOr example, Ch'ang-ch'un 
Automobile Plant No. 1, which cost 600 million yuan to build, operates 
at a fraction of its rated capacity because of insufficient supplies 
of critical materials. 
Another effect of slow-yielding investments is the slower 
increase in industrial employment. By emphasizing modern, large-
scale, capital-intensive plants, Chinese Communist industrial plan-
ners used the bulk of their scarce capital in investments that 
made relatively little use of the enormous supply of manpower in 
production, as distinguished from construction. The machine-
building industry became increasingly capital-intensive under the 
First Five Year Plan (1953-57). Most of the new plants were hielly 
mechanized.* There is evidence that greater employment could have 
been obtained by the investment of the same amount of capital in 
small-size and medium-size plants. 171/ 
In addition, as a consequence of the inability of the machine-
building and other industries to absorb the increase in manpower, 
the Chinese Communist economy experienced a slower rise in national 
income. An article in a Chinese magazine contained the following 
illuminating statement: 
According to statistical data, the per capita 
equipment of the workmen in our country in terms 
of fixed assets is assessed at 5n average of7 
4,000 to 5,000 yuan; in the case of modernized, 
big industry, it is around 10,000 yuan, while in 
medium and small industrial undertakings where 
light machines are used, each workman is equipped 
to the extent of 2,000 to 3,000 yuan. The aver-
age value produced by each workman annually is 
14,000 to 15,000 yuan in modernized, big industry, 
or 7,000 to 8,000 yuan in medium and small indus-
try. However, as in big industry the capital of 
10,000 yuan is just enough to equip one workman 
and in medium and small industry the same amount 
can equip three to five workmen, every 10,000 yuan 
of fixed assets in modernized big industry nets 
14,000 to 15,000 yuan in terms of values produced 
annually, whereas the same amount of fixed assets 
in medium and small industry nets 20,000 to 30,000 
yuan annually in terms of values produced, small

industry faring a little better than medium in-
dustry. Under the present conditions in our 
country, apart from building a few technically 
advanced large enterprises, we must therefore 
launch more small enterprises that require small 
investment and produce quick results in order 
to bring about an effective increase of the na-
tional income. 172/ 
This quotation strongly suggests that the increase in na-
tional income could have been greater if the newly created plants 
had been less capital-intensive. Although the state would have. 
realized a lesser improvement in labor productivity per industrial 
worker than with larger concentrations of capital, larger over-all 
gains in production and in productivity would have resulted from 
the larger number of workers employed in industry. This fact fol-
lows from the markedly higher productivity of workers in industry 
compared with those of agriculture. 173/ A Chinese writer for a 
Soviet economic journal in 1957 made the statement: "In such a 
country as China the most important factors for increasing social 
accumulation are maximal absorption of labor resources into pro-
duction and the regime of the economy." 174/ Plans for the de-
velopment of the machine-building industry announced since 1957 have 
emphasized increased inputs of labor.* 
In summary, the patterns of investment in the machine-building 
industry under the First Five Year Plan, by following closely the 
Soviet model and by adopting Soviet technology wholesale, hindered 
full use of economic resources, particularly labor. As a result, na-
tional income and accumulation of capital for further investment 
were lowered to the extent that it would have been feasible to in-
vest in a less concentrated fashion in development of the industry. 
Given the overriding goals of rapidly establishing a large, heavy 
industrial base and assimilating advanced technology, substantial 
reliance on large-Lale modern enterprises was indispensable. Never-
theless, in retrospect it appears that this policy was pursued to 
excess., and it is clear that by the end of 1957 the Chinese Communists 
saw the need for some modifications. 
C. Applicability of Soviet Technology 
, As production technology in the machine-building industry of 
an underdeveloped country advances and the product mix expands, in-
creased Importance is placed on the casting, fabrication, and ma-
chining of large work pieces that will satisfactorily meet the design

specifications. As the technological progress continues, higher 
standards of precision are attained; parts of both very small and 
large dimensions are finished to increasingly close tolerances, and 
the use of more specialized metals and alloys is mastered. 
Although historically the initial emphasis in technical im-
provements has been on increasing the. variety and complexity of 
products, technology in machine building is concerned also with 
development of more efficient methods of production. This search 
for efficiency has been, essentially oriented toward saving labor, 
particularly in areas where wages are high, but other important 
cost factors, such as the reduction of inputs of materials, have 
figured prominently. 
In Communist China, which has started the process of wide-
spread industrialization at a relatively late period, technological 
advancement is occurring in a number of areas simultaneously -- for 
example, in production of models of greater capacity, in produc-
tion of products requiring much greater precision, and in the in-
troduction of more efficient techniques and processes of production. 
Chinese Communist experience suggests that Soviet technology is not 
always appropriate for an economy with surplus labor. Sweeping 
generalizations in this'field tend to be somewhat hazardous because 
various levels of technology are found in the Soviet economy, and 
technology that is advanced by Soviet standards may be more appro-
priate under Chinese conditions in one industry than in another. 
The existence of technological alternatives between labor and capi-
tal, however, now is recognized by Chinese planners. 
In attempting to make greater use of their labor resources, 
the Chinese Communists can control both the range of products and 
the processes of production. In some cases, advanced technology 
may be linked so intimately with a more efficient and sometimes 
unique process of production that the choice of means to achieve 
this process may be very limited, and neither the required quantity. 
nor the quality can be Obtained by cruder methods of production.* 
Therefore, rolling mills, for example, must be imported or produced 
when Chinese goals call for expanding production of iron and steel. 
In addition, Communist China has decided to produce at an early 
stage of its industrial development most of the common types of ma-
chinery and equipment such as machine tools, trucks, tractors, and 
* The difficulties experienced by the Chinese Communists with the 
extremely low quality and usability of pig iron produced by crude 
"native-style" blast furnaces are instructive in this respect. The 
regime now speaks of "small, modern furnaces," indicating that their 
range of technological choices lies mainly in scale.

electrical machinery. China retains the option, however, of empha-
sizing the fairly simple type and sizes that can be produced with 
minimum amounts of capital equipment and the lower skill levels 
that are characteristic of its labor force. Such a policy economizes 
on equipment, labor skills, and, probably more important, on scarce 
designing and engineering talent. Moreover, the Chinese Communists 
face important choices as to complexity and specialization in machine 
building. Much of the equipment that they need does not require great 
precision in production and can be produced in batches. Other types 
of equipment require too much precision or are so specialized that 
only small quantities are required. In either case it probably would 
be worthwhile for China to import such types rather than to expend 
a disproportionate effort in attempting domestic production. 
At the same time, Communist China can economize on the use 
of complicated capital equipment in all of the industrial processes 
associated with machine building. The most obvious area for saving 
is in the use of labor instead of equipment for the intraplant trans-
fer of all raw and semifinished materials except very heavy items. 
Increased employment of labor could also be achieved by redesigning 
the product to permit the greater use of labor in performing more of 
the simple industrial operations, by using less machinery in produc-
tion, and at the same time, using general-purpose machinery to reduce 
the requirements for complicated specialized and automatic machinery 
and auxiliary equipment, which often has a high rate of obsolescence. 
The recognition of these alternatives by Chinese planners 
is indicated in the following statement: 
The most advanced equipment, it is true, 
has the advantage of high efficiency, better 
quality of products, low cost and less manpower 
employed, but such equipment calls for a highly 
developed machine-building industry and more 
investments and takes more construction time. 
The present conditions of our country are such 
that our capital is limited, abundant manpower 
remains to be utilized, and the technical level 
of the machine-building industry is too low to 
make such advanced equipment. To adopt too much 
of the most advanced and automation equipment 
will, on the one hand, call for Imports of more 
equipment and, on the other, prevent the produc-
tion capacity of our machine-building industry 
from being exploited and its technical level from 
being rapidly elevated. 175/

S-E-C-R-E-T 
The problem of technological alternatives is closely linked 
with the problems of scale and obsolescence. The use of simpler 
techniques permits considerable freedom to vary the scale of produc-
tion. In market economies a reduced scale of production may be the 
only one which is economically feasible, as shown by the following 
statement: 
Modern technology ... tends to be designed 
for large-scale production units, whereas the 
narrower market in poor countries dictates 
small-scale operations; this may require that 
the large-scale production process be broken 
down into amaJler scale and simpler procedures 
which involve a reduction in the degree of 
mechanization. 176/ 
Similar choices of scale of production may also be necessary for 
underdeveloped countries, even though they operate under a planned 
economy. The inability or unwillingness of Communist China to 
spread investments broadly in agriculture and light industry has 
had effects similar to market restrictions, which confront certain 
branches of the machine-building industry with difficult problems 
of selecting the optimum scale of production. The same principle 
does not necessarily apply to all consumer goods merely because per 
capita purchasing power is low. Countries with a large population 
may be able to sustain mass production of certain consumer neces-
sities, in spite of widespread poverty, by tapping the large aggregate 
purchasing power of small individual consumers who are attracted by 
goods of suitable quality at low prices. 
Moreover, large-scale production and a high degree of mech-
anization are associated with a high rate of obsolescence. It is 
interesting to contrast the Chinese Communist experience with Soviet 
technology in this respect with the plan for Chinese industrializa-
tion after World War II that was drawn up by the former US Foreign 
Economic Administration. Taking account of the problems of scale 
and obsolescence, the US plan proposed that -- although in the US, 
where all factors favor large-scale production, the average invest-
ment required per man employed was $10,500 (in wartime prices) --
the average investment in China should be only $6,000 per man em-
ployed. In scale of operation, China and the US were compared to 
the Studebaker and Ford corporations, respectively.

The Studebaker organization is tremendous by 
non-American or even by non-Detroit standards. 
But, alongside the Ford organization, it is small. 
The Ford Company has a production volume large 
enough to make the cost of new equipment nominal; 
it puts a premium on the value of specialized, 
single-purpose machines and accelerates the rate 
of obsolescence of entire batteries of mutually 
supplementary machines. Studebaker, on the other 
hand, with less than 25 percent of Ford's produc-
tion, needs much less automatic and specialized 
tooling than Ford ... . Each organization uses 
the type of equipment that is most efficient for 
its purpose and that involves the most satisfac-
tory rate of obsolescence. 177/ 
Accordingly, the US plan emphasized those types and sizes of equip-
ment the obsolescence of which could be controlled most easily until 
China could acquire the facilities for replacements and the maintenance 
of which was simple enough to offset the lack of repair facilities and 
skilled labor. 
D. Implications of Chinese Experience for Communist Economic  
Theory 
From the point of view of the Chinese Communists, rapid eco-
nomic development, although the main consideration, was not the only 
one. It may be tempting to judge Chinese performance by Western 
standards, but such procedures are to a large extent invalid, because 
Western concepts are often irrelevant to the totally planned economy. 
Western judgments of performance require reference to economically 
rational criteria.for the selection of the most efficient or produc-
tive of alternative choices for investment. In the Communist economy, 
however, the scope for the application of strictly economic criteria 
is very limited because overriding state Objectives, which are decided 
essentially by a political process, invariably predetermine the broad 
outlines of development. Whereas Western theory stresses immediate 
productivity of investments without regard for the type of investment, 
Communist economic criteria are allowed, for example, to suggest no 
more than the most productive means to fulfill set plans for expand-
ing production. Nevertheless, there is usually some room for the 
application of economic criteria, for economic policymakers of the 
higher echelon cannot make all the decisions pertaining to choices 
for investment in a complex economy. ,A planning bureaucracy must 
step in at some point to develop specific and detailed plans for im-
plementing the directives of higher authority. In this sense, then,

S-E-C-R-E-T 
it may be asked whether or not investment choices in the machine-
building industry were made wisely under Soviet guidance. 
By both Western and Communist standards, Communist China 
undertook prematurely too many new projects that could become pro-
ductive only after several years, whereas a number of investments 
in the reconstruction of existing facilities, which could have 
yielded relatively quick returns in higher productivity, were over-
looked. Moreover, criteria that took account of the abundance of 
labor in China would have dictated more labor-intensive projects 
and fewer capital-intensive projects. Although no orthodox Chinese 
Communist would permit such considerations to place light industry 
above heavy industry, it is very significant that there is con-
siderable latitude for the application of labor-intensive techniques 
in heavy industry, as the present plans for small and medium-size 
plants now show. 
The necessity of foregoing a Wholesale advance to the highest 
level of technology may make it exceedingly difficult for the Chinese 
Communists to adhere to certain aspects of orthodox Soviet economic 
theory. According to Marxist theory, all value is created by labor, 
and capital does not create value, as such, but merely represents 
past or "stored up" labor. As a corollary to this principle, the 
,relative effectiveness of investment projects is measured in terms 
of improvements in labor productivity or, more precisely, in savings 
of inputs of labor value. 178/ Thus, in theory at least, there is 
an inherent bias toward a high degree of mechanization in the Soviet 
economic system.* 179/ Emphasis on mechanization suits conditions 
in the USSR reasonably well, inasmuch as industrial labor tends to 
be relatively scarce. In China, however, where labor is super-
abundant and capital is relatively scarce, the drive to achieve sav-
ings in labor value, in the Marxist sense, need not be pressed for 
the sole purpose of conserving manpower. Therefore, theory in the 
Chinese- context should provide criteria for economizing the use of

practice should not necessarily be construed from their present de-
ficiencies in mechanization and automation. They readily admit that 
they lag behind the US in many fields of automation, that their am-
bitious plans for introducing new equipment have not been fulfilled, 
and that there are certain heavy restraints in the economy which 
militate against the rapid elevation of the technical level of indus-
try. In relation to the former state of development of Soviet in-
dustry, however, considerable progress toward automation has been 
made. Moreover, current Soviet .policy places great emphasis on mech-
anization and automation, which was one of the main topics of the . 
Plenum of June 1959.

capital. The attempt to grapple with the economic facts of life 
within the framework of orthodox Marxist theory has forced the 
Chinese into such tortuous paths of reasoning as the following: 
In suggesting that in certain fields we do 
not need to try to attain a high level of mech-
anization and should not merely consider the 
improvement in labor productivity, we do not 
mean to say that we do not need to raise labor 
productivity. What we mean is that, in making 
arrangements for construction projects, we can-
not merely consider the improvement of labor 
productivity, although the existing and the newly-
established enterprises should retrench personnel 
and make efforts to increase labor productivity. 180/ 
There is also evidence that the Chinese have started a campaign to 
convince Soviet economists that a more labor-intensive approach 
geared to Chinese conditions and based on smaller-scale undertakings 
is not in conflict with Lenin's theories that large-scale industry 
must form the material-technical basis of socialism. 181/ 
IV. Development Under the Second Five Year Plan (1958-62)  
? A. Foreign Economic Assistance and Its Implications  
At the end of the First Five Year Plan (1953-57) the founda-
tion of the Chinese Communist machine-building industry was, gener-
ally speaking, still weak. In spite of the construction projects 
that had been undertaken, some important sectors of the industry were 
not developed. Among these sectors were those producing heavy-duty, 
forge-press equipment; steel-rolling equipment; nitric fertilizer 
equipment; cement equipment; diesel and electric locomotives; equip-
ment for making artificial and synthetic fibers; precision lathes 
and measuring instruments; scientific instruments; and instruments 
for automatic control. In order to correct these deficiencies, as 
presently intended, substantial investments are required, particu-
larly in heavy and precision machinery and chemical-engineering 
equipment, during the remaining period of the Second Five Year Plan. 
Although medium and small machines were overproduced in 1957, the 
plants turning out this equipment cannot easily be diverted to pro-
duction of heavy and precision machinery, because of restrictions 
in equipment and technical force. The lack of heavy machinery capac-
ity will be considerably alleviated when projects begun under the 
First Five Year Plan are completed by 1961. The scientific instru-
ments and chemical-engineering equipment industries, however, were

S-E-C-R-E-T 
relatively neglected up to 1958 and must be greatly expanded under 
the Second Five Year Plan. 
According to the terms of the Sino-Soviet agreements on eco-
nomic assistance in August 1958 and February 1959, the USSR agreed 
to build for Communist Cliina 125 industrial enterprises in addition 
to the remainder of the projects prescribed by earlier agreements. 
Projects specified under the agreements, which include facilities 
for production of chemicals, coals, metals, machinery, radiotech-
nical equipment, building materials, electric power, and other com-
modities,. are to be undertaken in 1959-67 at a reported cost of 5 bil-
lion rubles (equivalent to $1,250,000,000 at the official rate of 
exchange, which overvalues the ruble). Essentially, the present 
agreement represents another in a series of long-term Soviet commit-
ments to supply, on a compensated basis, machinery and equipment for 
specific industrial projects in China, the deliveries of such ecuip-
ment being scheduled under trade agreements annually negotiated. 
The average annual level of Soviet "assistance" under the new agree-
ment is generally considered to be somewhat lower than that provided 
under previous agreements. One reason for this decline is that the 
Chinese Communists will increase their participation by providing 
"the major part of the accessory equipment" for the enterprises 
stipulated in the agreement. It should be noted, however, that 
Chinese economic dependence on the USSR is not determined merely 
by the level of "assistance" in a given period but also by the more 
or less cumulative effects of steady Soviet technical influence, 
which will predominate through 1967. The heavy reliance of China on 
Soviet technology during the formative stages of the machine-building 
industry will have long-run effects because of the need for replace-
ment of equipment and for-compatibility of design and because of the 
general technical orientation toward the USSR. Although steps have 
been taken to reduce the role of advisers and technicians from the 
Soviet Bloc and to increase the capabilities of Chinese engineers 
for independent designing, the influence of the Bloc will probably 
remain strong for an indefinite period in electronics, synthetic fibers, 
metal-forming machinery, and heavy machinery. 
Data on the participation of the European Satellites in Chi-
nese Communist industrial development under the Second Five Year Plan 
are incomplete._ The cost of complete sets of equipment for industrial 
plants of all types that Poland will deliver to China between 1956 
and 1962 amounts to 221 million rubles ($55.2 million). In connec-
tion with the protocol on scientific and technical cooperation, signed 
in 1957, Czechoslovakia agreed to turn over to Communist China tech-
nical documents on production of various machines and appliances and 
information on construction of hydroelectric stations; East Germany, 
data on production of optical apparatus, machinery and equipment for

chines4 ships, and transformers; Hungary, data on production of 
radiotechnical apparatus, cable, motor vehicles, and tractors; Ru-
mania, data on production of petroleum equipment and other items. 182/ 
The new Sino-Soviet assistance agreement is further evidence 
that Communist China is playing a more significant role in its own 
industrialization. At the same time, buoyant assertions of reduced 
Chinese dependence on the USSR underscore the fact that the Peking 
regime is now deeply committed to base future economic development 
on the foundation of its own machine-building industry. In view of 
the grave imbalances which developed in the Chinese economy and the 
enormously wasteful misallocation of resources under the First Five 
Year Plan, Chinese economic planning can be characterized as somewhat 
primitive and inept. Now that the Chinese Communists have assumed 
greater responsibility for equipping their own industrial projects, 
the effect of miscalculations on planning could be magnified. Disloca-
tions would be the more difficult to overcome because the Chinese 
industrial base is smnli and additional capacity would often have to 
be created in order to produce items for which demand had not been 
foreseen. As a result, the progress of industrial construction pro-
jects could be delayed under the Second Five Year Plan. 
B. Restoration of Balanced Growth 
Notwithstanding continued Soviet economic assistance, al-
though at a reduced rate, the Chinese Communists have formulated 
general outlines for the Second Five Year Plan (1958-62) which rep-
resent a considerable departure from Soviet experience. The appear-
ance of grave imbalances and dislocations toward the end of the First 
Five Year Plan (1953-57). posed a serious challenge to economic policy-
makers in Peking. With considerable dissatisfaction the planners 
realized that the doctrinaire pattern of concentrating almost exclu-
sively on the development of large-scale heavy industry put excessive 
demands on Chinese technology and capacity to import, at the same 
time neglecting agriculture and full use of Chinese manpower. Fol-
lowing this reappraisal the regime responded vigorously to the chal-
lenge with new ideas and programs. 
1. New Attitude Toward Balanced Growth  
Discussions of the Second Five Year Plan in 1956-57 re-
flected a more realistic attitude that recognized the need for inter-
sectoral balance in economic development. The Peking regime had be-
come concerned with the accelerated rate of population increase, which 
placed a population obviously too large on land that was too small 
and poorly cultivated. Food and clothing were, therefore, the two

S-E-C-R-E-T 
chronic worries of the government. In addition, the dependence of 
heavy industry on agriculture for investment funds and markets was 
recognized. Thus the lag in agricultural growth was seen as a drag 
on the entire economy, and drastic corrective measures were deemed 
necessary. 
Although greater attention will be given to the needs of 
agriculture in the allocation of investment under the Second Five 
Year Plan, agriculture will not displace heavy industry as the pri-
mary aim in economic development. Rather, there will be some shifts 
in priorities within industry to support agricultural growth. The 
revised "general line for socialist construction," adopted at the 
Chinese Communist Party Congress in May 1958, called for the "simul-
taneous development of industry and agriculture, while giving priority 
to heavy industry." Accordingly, components of the machine-building 
industry associated with production of chemical fertilizer equipment 
and irrigation equipment are to be expanded at an accelerated rate.* 
Moreover, the new plan sought to restore a balance'be-
tween industries producing raw materials and those consuming raw ma-
terials. Within heavy industry the greatest stress will be given to 
the fuel, power, metallurgical, and chemical industries. Whereas 
the ratio of investment in industries producing raw materials to in-
vestment in the metal-processing industries during 1953-57 was 2.5 
to 1, it was to be raised to 4.6 to 1 beginning in 1958. 183/ This 
change implies high priority within the machine-building industry for 
metallurgical equipment and power-generating equipment, which is 
actually in effect in the program for capital construction in 1959. 
Chinese Communist planners assumed that machine building 
would require an increasing proportion of steel, whereas the propor-
tion of steel used in construction and installation would decrease 
correspondingly. They estimated that under the Second Five Year Plan 
the quantity of steel used by the machine-building industry would 
account for about one-third of the total demand for steel. 184/ On 
the basis of this heavy demand a number of Chinese economists con-
cluded that, compared with the First Five Year Plan, the steel indus-
try should be allocated relatively more investment than the machine-
building industry under the Second Five Year Plan. 
This allocation of investment appears to be sound. It 
is expected that industries producing raw materials should experience 
more rapid growth than machine building for a considerable time. At 
present the industries producing raw materials must supply both the 
reconstructed machine-building facilities and the new plants that

have been constructed. In addition, they must meet the needs of the 
over-all program of capital construction. A number of large machine-
building projects begun under the First Five Year Plan will initiate 
production during 1958-60. As new capacity comes into production and 
the demands for capital construction continue, the industries produc-
ing raw materials may be even more hard pressed to meet their commit-
ments,- especially if the Chinese also desire to reduce such imports. 
2. Changed Approach to SelfaSufficiency  
In the light of their tremendous economic problems the 
Chinese Communists have profoundly altered their approach to economic 
independence and self-sufficiency. Whereas previously they had cast 
Communist China in the same role as the USSR before 1936, they found 
in 1957 that 
The international environment in which 
we now find ourselves is different from 
that in which the Soviet Union found itself 
when building socialism. Ours is not an 
isolated and sole socialist country. The 
Soviet Union. and, in particular, the Peo-
ples' Democracies of East Europe generally 
speaking have a great capacity of machine-
building industry and hope to supply our 
country with more machines From the 
standpoint of international cooperation 
between socialist countries, it would 
appear that our country may produce fewer 
machines for the time being and solve our 
problem through international cooperation 
and concentrate more construction capital on 
projects which are more essential. 186/ 
This new attitude may be, in part, a reflection of certain changes 
in the position of the Soviet Bloc on self-sufficiency since the 
death of Stalin. Communist economic thought has become somewhat less 
doctrinaire on the requirement that every member must develop heavy 
industry and now differentiates between the more and less advanced 
Communist economies, maintaining that the former should supply ma-
chinery and equipment to the latter, who in turn would generally 
supply agricultural and mineral products to other members of the 
Bloc. A greater measure of discrimination in pursuing self-
sufficiency clearly implies a change in Chinese trade relations with 
other countries of the Bloc. Extensive relaxation of autarkic ten-
dencies which prevailed through 1957 would be required. Perhaps with 
the purpose of reassuring the European Satellites of this intention,

a Chinese 'contributor to a Soviet economic journal stated: "The 
creation in gommunist Ching of an integrated industrial system 
will not lead to a weakening of its ties with other countries of the 
socialist camp ... . Division of labor and specialization of prod-
ucts within these countries, in correspondence with their economic 
possibilities and natural resources, will receive further develop-
ment." 187/ A logical consequence of a program for specialization 
would be greater Chinese participation in CEMA (Council for Mutual 
Economic Assistance -- Sovet Ekonomicheskoy Vzaimopomoshchi). 
The Chinese Communists are not likely, however, to pur-
sue the principle of international specialization to its logical 
ultimate conclusion. An article in a Soviet economic journal indi-
cated that, if the socialist countries cooperated on the basis of an 
international socialist division of labor, it would be possible to 
determine the effectiveness of investments not only on a national 
scale but also in respect to all countries of the Sino-Soviet Bloc 
and thus to increase the rational use of all productive resources. 
It noted that this plan would involve a comparative analysis of the 
productivity of labor and costs of production for each commodity. 1Z/ 
From only a hasty glance at the cost structure in Communist China 
compared with those in the Soviet Bloc, it is expected that the 
Chinese would have a comparative advantage in labor-intensive lines 
of production. It seems certain, however, that the Chinese would 
not allow themselves to specialize permanently in labor-intensive 
products, neglecting to give priority to the development of heavy 
industry in general and of the machine-building industry in particu-
lar. In fact, the Chinese Communists look upon international tech-
nical and economic cooperation as a way to overcome their weaknesses 
in producing heavy machinery, precision machine tools, and instru-
ments, in spite of the fact that they do not have a comparative ad-
vantage in these industries. 189/ 
3. Program for Small- and Medium-Size Plants  
The new emphasis on the construction of smaller units is 
one of the key policies in the drive for quicker returns on invest-
ment and represents a very significant departure from the typical 
Soviet techniques heretofore employed in Communist China. More re-
liance is to be placed on local investment, manual labor, and tra-
ditional methods of production in contrast with the large-scale, 
highly mechanized, and specialized plants built with Soviet assist-
ance and controlled by the central government. In his report on 
5 May 1958, Liu Shao-chi described the advantages of smaller plants 
in the following general terms:

S-E-C-R-E-T 
It is necessary for the central, pro-
vincial, municipal, and autonomous region 
authorities to build a certain number of 
big enterprises. Big enterprises which 
have a big output and a high technical 
level can solve key problems having a 
decisive bearing on the national economy. 
They form the backbone of the force that 
pushes forward the industrial development 
of the country. But small- and medium-
size enterprises have the advantage over 
big enterprises in that they require less 
investment and can more easily absorb funds 
from scattered sources; they require less 
time to build and produce quicker results; 
they can be designed and equipped locally; 
they can make do with various types of 
equipment which are readily available in 
the localities. They can be set up over a 
wide area so as to facilitate industrializa-
tion of the country as a whole and promote 
the training of technical personnel through-
out the country and a balanced development of 
the economies of the various regions. They 
can reduce transport costs and make flexible 
use of available resources, making it easier 
to bring about a satisfactory relation be-
tween supply, production, and sales. It is 
easier for them to make flexible use of the 
labor power available in the countryside and 
of casual labor, depending on the amount of 
work to be done, and thus help reduce the 
differences between city and countryside, 
between workers and peasants. 190/ 
What part small- and medium-size plants are to play in 
the development of the machine-building industry has not been clearly 
defined. It would not seem possible to rely principally on smaller 
plants for production of heavy machinery, which is to be greatly ex-
panded under the Second Five Year Plan. Rather, the new heavy ma-
chinery plants at Ttai-yuan, Wu-han, and Fu-la-erh-chi will bear the 
primary responsibility in this field. The smaller plants may serve 
to support the larger units and fill the remaining gaps. Production 
at the large, new enterprises has tended to be highly specialized, 
so that there might be opportunities for smaller plants to produce 
accessory equipment and thus to broaden the range of products.

S-E-C-R-E-T 
Moreover, smaller plants can serve to supply parts and subassemblies 
and Other items to large plants. 
It is feasible, nevertheless, to assign important tasks 
in production of lighter machinery to the small- and medium-size 
plants. The First Ministry of Machine Building reportedly has de-
veloped about 120 standardized designs for such machinery and elec-
trical equipment plants. The designs are mainly for plants that are 
to serve special districts, hsiens, and hsiangs, with a few to be 
managed at the provincial level. The plants include general machinery 
plants, agricultural machinery plants, power-producing machinery 
plants, chemical fertilizer equipment plants, antifriction bearing 
plants, electrical equipment plants, electric wire plants, and light-
bulb plants. Investments range from less than 50,000 yuan to more 
than 1.5 million yuan. 
Provincial or special district plants are designed to 
support heavy industry, consumer industries, and agricultural pro-
duction (especially with respect to chemical fertilizer equipment 
and irrigation equipment). The small plants below the hsien level 
are designed to meet the needs of rural villages and will emphasize 
repair of tractors and agricultural machinery. 191/ Small, local 
plants should prove much better suited than larger plants, both from 
an administrative and a technical point of view, in coping with a 
limited demand for a wide range of products.* 
4. Decentralization  
During 1958, there was considerable discussion of decen-
tralization in the machine-building industry as a means of coordinat-
ing production between larger and smaller plants. According to Chao 
Erh-lu, Minister of the First Ministry of Machine Building, a number 
of "economic coordination areas," each embracing a population of up 
to 100 million, will be established. Plants under the direct control 
of the ministry will be transferred "step by step and trade by trade" 
to regional authorities. The devolution of authority would appear 
to cover control of production arrangements and raw materials. The 
ministry would retain responsibility for general planning, technical 
guidance, and supervision. Within the areas, plants would be com-
bined and production integrated so as to insure self-sufficiency 
in ordinary machinery requirements, whereas interarea coordination 
would be achieved in production of commodities that are heavy and 
large and require complicated techniques. Thus a considerable 
measure of regional specialization would be preserved, especially 
where the additional purpose of reducing costs of transportation

could be served. For example, heavy machine-building enterprises 
would be established in the vicinity of large metallurgical combines, 
mining equipment bases near large coal mines, marine equipment bases 
along the coast, and precision tool and instrument plants in areas 
where the technical standard is traditionally high and skilled per-
sonnel are relatively concentrated. 192/ 
There is little solid evidence that decentralization is 
actually being implemented in the machine-building industry, except 
to a limited extent in electrical equipment. Central government 
plants have given some assistance to local machinery enterprises, 
but it appears that the ministries retain control over the large and 
technically advanced plants that account for the most significant 
production of machinery. 
It is possible that the trend toward decentralization, 
at least insofar as many existing plants are concerned, will not be 
pressed, because of the overriding need for coordination in produc-
tion of complete sets of equipment. 193/ For example, production of 
thermal turbogenerator sets with a capacity of more than 12,000 kw 
involves coordination among more than 80 large- and medium-size ma-
chinery plants in various parts of Communist China. 12)1/ 
5. Emphasis on Better Adaptation of Foreign Experience  
Under the Second Five Year. Plan, the criteria for indus-
trial design are to be fundamentally changed. Native engineers will 
be expected to adjust their technical standards and specifications 
to Chinese productive capacity and to take account of the pressing 
need to utilize abundant manpower. 
Chinese engineers are said to be capable of designing 
machine tool plants, steam turbine and boiler plants, diesel engine 
plants, plants producing tractor and automobile parts, plants pro-
ducing metallurgical and mining equipment, plants for locomotives 
and rolling stock, and shipyards for building both inland and ocean-
going vessels. 195/ According to the terms of a Sino-Soviet technical 
assistance agreement signed in November 1958, most of the 1+7 indus-
trial projects to be constructed or expanded were to be surveyed and 
designed by the Chinese, the main equipment being supplied by the 
USSR. The USSR agreed to provide many up-to-date designs, blueprints 
of new products, and other technical data. 196/ This agreement prob-
ably is significant as an indication of the extent of Chinese partici-
pation in the designing of large projects. It is believed that, until 
their capabilities for really original designing have greatly improved, 
Chinese engineers will play their most important role in modifying 
Soviet design so as to eliminate nonessential housing, amenities,

materials handling, and other operations where labor can be used in-
tensively. Soviet concepts of city planning in connection with in-
dustrial projects probably will be discarded in most cases. Since 
early 1958, all blueprints for above-norm projects must be scruti-
nized and approved at the ministerial level. 197/ 
In response to the need for modification of Soviet de-
signs, Chinese Communist designers of the Ministry of Light Indus-
try prepared a number of prototype designs for small plants, such 
as paper-mBlcing plants, breweries, and sugar refineries. These de-
signs are said to be based on the principle of "using more manual 
labor, fewer steam boilers, and less electricity and improving 
quality." Little investment is required, and construction can be 
completed in a short time. 198/ 
In addition to paring "nonproductive" facilities from 
investment schedules, the new technological policy of Communist 
China calls for less emphasis on automation and highly complex ma-
chinery where appropriate. In connection with new development pro-
jects, executives of the Communist Party have urged greater atten-
tion to the possibilities of absorbing more workers into the in-
dustrial sector of the economy. Sectors selected for labor-intensive 
development include mining, construction of buildings, water conser-
vancy, communications and transportation, forestry, and handicrafts 
in addition to agriculture. 199/ 
This trend will affept the type of machinery that the 
machine-building industry will be requited to produce to support 
development in such fields as mining machinery, construction equip-
ment, transport equipment, and agricultural machinery. In such 
instances, simple and light machinery and equipment can be turned 
out by local industries and agricultural cooperatives to meet local 
needs. In many applications, full mechanization is not feasible 
under Chinese conditions. This fact is recognized by the Chinese 
Communists, who are pressing forward a technological revolution of 
a character which may be extremely effective in a labor-surplus 
economy, although it would seem unimpressive to most Westerners. 
This program is based on the principle of combining mechanization 
with semimechanization, improvement of tools, and manual methods, 
and its goal is not to replace labor, as in advanced industrial 
countries, but to magnify its effectiveness. Thus the efficiency 
and productivity of labor are to be increased through the use of 
better hand tools, the replacement of carrying poles by push carts 
drawn by men, and similar measures. 
There do exist considerable opportunities for the ap- ? 
plication of this approach to production of machines. Machines

are indispensable in building tools and other machines. Conceivably 
a policy of intensification of labor inputs would not only improve 
industrial employment but also might alleviate problems of production 
caused by shortages of some of the more complex and .specialized ma-
chine tools. The crux of the matter seems to be in simplifying the 
production processes so as to be able to use the simpler machinery 
made in Communist China. For example, if a certain' machine tool 
could handle five operations but was in short supply, the same job 
could be done by five operators using simple lathes. Unskilled 
labor can be used to replace some materials handling operations. 
The program for development of mall- and medium-size plants would 
seem to offer some of the best opportunities for setting up such 
production processes.* 
6. Slowdown in Regional Dispersion 
Considerable development of the machine-building industry 
in the interior of Communist China will take place under the 
Second Five Year Plan. This development is made possible largely 
by the accelerated construction of the new iron and steel bases at 
Wu-han and Pao-t'ou. The new industrial center of Pao-t'ou in Inner 
Mongolia will receive five times as much capital construction invest-
ment under the Second Five Year Plan as under the First. .200/ 
From recently established criteria, it is possible to in-
fer that the Chinese Communists have decided, however reluctantly, 
not to press too rapidly plans to locate new plants in remote and 
less vulnerable areas. In the past, too much investment had to be 
funneled into dormitory and municipal construction, and new railroad 
links had to be created to support undertakings in underdeveloped 
areas. The new policy is to utilize small- and medium-size towns 
to the fullest extent as bases for new plants. 221/ Such use will 
maximize the return on investment and reduce costs of production. 
Shanghai and Tientsin, two vulnerable coastal cities, are to be de-
veloped as centers for producing heavy machinery. 
7. Policy on Consumption of Fuel  
The machine-building industry is making strenuous efforts 
to develop engines and motors suited to supplies of fuel and power in 
Communist China. Plans. outlined by the National Technological Com-
mission call for the development of tractors consuming solid fuels. 
Because of the shortage of petroleum, no large requirements for liquid 
fuels are to be considered for agricultural machinery. Instead of 
diesel engines for the countryside, therefore, plans call for produc-
tion of coal-gas and steam engines that can be adjusted to the

various characteristics of coal in different regions and to the em-
ployment of such local fuels as millet, stalks, and hay. After the 
coal is steamed at low temperature and liquid fuel and chemical ma-
terial are extracted, the semicoked charcoal is to be used in agri-
cultural machinery. 202/ A number of the trial models of new trac-
tors that have appeared are fitted with coal-gas engines. Moreover, 
some "Liberation" trucks in 1958 were scheduled to have coal-gas 
engines. 203/ Although a few diesel, steam, and electrically driven 
engines will continue to be used in mechanized irrigation, the 
greatest emphasis will be placed on equipment powered by coal-gas 
engines, which have proved more efficient and cheaper to produce 
and operate than steam engines for this purpose. 204/ The use of 
electrically driven water pumps would be highly desirable, but 
opportunities are limited because of the slow pace of rural elec-
trification. Motor vehicles and tractors using coal gas operate 
at reduced efficiency and considerably lower power, but this sacri-
fice is deemed expedient in view of the paramount necessity of re-
ducing the demand for petroleum. Although promising discoveries 
of oil were announced in 1958, plentiful supplies of petroleum prod-
ucts still appear a long way off. Moreover, it seems likely that 
the Chinese Communists will not hasten to expand oil imports from 
the USSR but instead will continue to restrict requirements to the 
most essential uses. 
8. Substitutes for Scarce Materials 
As a means of alleviating shortages of certain raw ma-
terials, machine--building enterprises have undertaken the extensive 
substitution of more plentiful materials. In production of motor 
vehicles, substantial savings in the consumption of nickel have re-
sulted from the use of chromium-manganese-titanium steel instead of 
nickel-chromium steel and chromium casting iron instead of nickel-
chromium casting iron. Manganese steel or quality carbon steel has 
been substituted for structural chromium steel, straight carbon 
steel for quality steel, hot-rolled sheet for cold-rolled sheet, 
and aluminum for copper. 205/ Plants producing electrical equip-
ment have experimented successfully with aluminum alloys as substi-
tutes for copper in electric motors. 206/ Designs have been modi-
fied to eliminate unnecessary metal, and plants producing equipment 
of inferior design are to emulate the most economical producers. 207/ 
Proposals made by workers on the "leap forward" campaign within 
the First Ministry of Machine Building requested, perhaps somewhat 
overoptimistically, that the ministry "within 3 years, raise its 
metallurgical materials utilization rate 8 percent and substitute 
other steel materials for nickel-chromium steel in 90 to 95 percent 
of the cases. The copper consumption rate should also be lowered 
30 to 40 percent within 3 years. Use of powder metallurgy and

plastics to substitute for metal parts such as ordinary bearings and 
cutting tools, etc., should be expanded." 208/ An effort is being 
made to increase production and to popularize the use of oil-
impregnated bearings as substitutes for ball and roller bearings in 
order to solve the shortage of bearings during the "leap forward" 
campaign. The oil-impregnated bearings can be applied in machinery 
having high sIeed, low load, and low thrust. Such bearings thus 
are suitable for light electrical equipment and textile machinery, 
but not for heavy machinery, transport equipment, and the like. In 
the development of agricultural machinery the use of wood is being 
emphasized. 209/ 
There is evidence to suggest that many substitute ma-
terials are of inferior quality. Although industrial personnel 
are exhorted to conserve materials in a number of ways, the reiterated 
warnings to preserve quality indicate that there is little leeway in 
substitution before reaching the point at which quality suffers. 210/ 
Deterioration of quality is believed to be a factor that will assume 
increasing importance as Communist China strives to increase the pro-
portion of machinery produced for export.* 
9. Fuller Use of Production Capacity  
According to the draft plan announced by Po I-pol "pro-
duction in the machine-building industry in 1958 is planned in a way 
that will make fuller use of the capacity of the various machine-
building departments ... ." 211/ As previously pointed out, there 
is considerable latent capacity in machinery plants, particularly in 
the coastal cities.** Now, however, both Shanghai and Tientsin are 
taking advantage of their industrial experience and comparatively 
advanced technical force to shift over to production of relatively 
high-grade, precision and specialized heavy machinery. 212/ In addi-
tion, a major improvement in utilization is to be accomplished by 
the diversion of some capacity for military production to meet urgent 
civilian requirements. Plants producing military items are reported 
to be capable of making wrist watches, bicycles, sewing machines, 
cameras, oil compressors, motor vehicles, measuring and cutting in-
struments, automobile parts, tractors, water pumps, diesel engines, 
agricultural machinery, well-drilling equipment, and other commodi-
ties. 213/ 
This shift came about in connection with the smalgama-
tion in February 1958 of the First Ministry of Machine Building, the 
Ministry of the Power Equipment Industry, and the Second Ministry

of Machine Building. The First Ministry is reported to control 
directly 110 large state plants producing machinery for civilian 
use. The Ministry of the Power Equipment Industry is believed to 
have controlled directly some 20 state plants producing equipment for 
power stations and transmission grids, as well as powerplants for 
ships and some other purposes. The Second Ministry of Machine Build-
ing is believed to have controlled about 100 state plants engaged in 
production of munitions and other military items.* The aim of the 
amalgamation of these three Ministries appears to be closer integra-
tioh of civilian and military production. 214/ It is probable that 
the Chinese Communists expect to realize great gains from fuller use 
of the capacity of existing plants, at least during the early years 
of the Second Five Year Plan (1958-62). The greatest underutilized 
capacity, however, exists in coastal cities, where many plants have 
obsolete equipment and cannot produce high-grade, precision machinery 
until their facilities have been modernized. 
10. Diversification of Production  
During 1958, there was much criticism of the excessive 
specialization prevalent in many new plants established with aid 
from the Soviet Bloc. In conjunction with the emphasis on local 
industry and decentralization, more stress was placed on converting 
highly specialized plants into multipurpose plants to serve local 
needs for machinery, especially for metallurgical equipment. In 
October 1958, when Vice Chairman Chu Te was inspecting petroleum, 
chemical engineering, and machinery plants in Lan-chou, he declared 
that "there should be an integral industrial system at various 
places and that, from now on, factories along a special line should 
develop into multiple-purpose plant." 215/ He pointed out that 
smaller units should not attempt to satisfy national requirements 
for one type of product but that the largest units, such as the 
Tiai-yuan Heavy Machinery Plant, should undertake production of a 
wider variety of items. 216/ 
C. Impact of Policy Shifts on the Machine-Building Industry 
Because of the drastic changes in over-all policies concern-
ing its development, the machine-building industry of Communist 
China must undergo major adjustments in production, especially with 
regard to support for agricultural development. The industry ap-
pears to have been assigned two primary economic missions: (1) pro-
duction of equipment for the projects undertaken with Soviet aid 
and other major undertakings and (2) direct and indirect support for 
agricultural development. The assumption of greater responsibility

for equipping the large construction units will require great ef-
forts on the part of the machine-building industry, for produc-
tion of heavy machinery is weak, most of the existing plants are de-
signed to make single machines, and the capability for supplying 
complete sets of equipment is at present very low. 217/ As has been 
pointed out already, great stress is being placed on completion of 
construction of heavy machinery plants under the Second Five Year 
Plan. 
Since the reappraisal of the agricultural situation in Com-
munist China in 1957, there has been a marked shift in the require-
ments imposed on the machine-building industry for agricultural ma-
chinery. It was found that large-scale mechanization of farming 
operations was not feasible for most farmland in China and actually 
was detrimental to full employment. In addition, reclamation of 
wasteland was economically sound only to a limited extent. Primary 
reliance is not to be placed on tractors, butr tractors will perform 
subsidiary functions in reclaiming wasteland and in relieving tem-
porary manpower shortages during peak periods. The greatest improve-
ments in agricultural production that were at the same time consist-
ent with the maximization of farm income lay in increasing the aver-
age yields per acre of land already under cultivation. The extension 
of irrigation and the use of chemical fertilizers held the greatest 
promise of increasing the productivity of the available manpower. 
Rapid increase in industrial support to agriculture along these lines 
would require the machine-building industry to accelerate production 
of equipment for the chemical industries and to expand production 
of irrigation equipment -- for example, motors of various types, 
pumps, and valves. Local machine works and communes could handle 
production of light tools and implements, fertilizer appliances, in-
secticide machines, and simple transportation equipment. 218/ 
Notwithstanding earlier doubts about mechanization, the 
Peking regime announced, in October 1959, a grandiose plan for 
modernizing agriculture in Communist China. Eventual mechaniza-
tion of agriculture has been a leading long-term goal since July 1955, 
when Mao Tse-tung called for the complete technical transformation 
of agriculture in four or five 5-year plans. The new program, how-
ever, declared to be "the new content under new circumstances" of 
the old Party policy and outlined by economic planner Vice Premier 
Po I-po, is more specific and has shortened the timetable. The 
stated intent of the program is that by 1969 land suitable for ma-
chine cultivation will "in the main" be worked by mechanical in-
stead of animal traction, that motorized pumps will replace manual 
waterwheels in irrigation, that motor vehicles will lift most of 
the age-old burden of rural transportation from the backs of men and 
animals, that the use of chemical fertilizers will become predominant, 
and that electric power will be in 'common use. . The program is to be

carried out gradually, with the first 4 years devoted to laying an 
initial foundation. The immediate goal of mechanization is at 
least a doubling of production of grain, whereas the ultimate objec-
tive is to release millions of farm laborers for work in industry. 219/ 
If this program were to be vigorously implemented, it would 
require a major shift in investment resources from building up heavy 
industry for maximum production of military equipment and self-
reproductive machinery to a more selective buildup of those heavy 
industries that directly support the technological transformation 
of agriculture.* At present, however, the machinery possessed by 
agricultural activities is still insignificant in comparison with 
the goal of complete mechanization. For example, existing machines 
can only accomplish about 10 percent of the required amount of mechan-
ical irrigation. In addition, agriculture is expected to have about 
250,000 kw of electrical capacity in rural areas by the end of 1959. 
The consumption of chemical fertilizers increased from 592,000 tons 
in 1953. to 2,708,000 tons in 1958. ,220/ 
Obviously it is too early to attempt to evaluate how seriously 
the Peking regime is determined to allocate to agriculture a greater 
share of the developmental resources. Earlier plans for mechaniza-
tion were given prominence in public discussion for a time but later 
were allowed to slide quietly into oblivion. Some doubt can be 
raised as to whether or not the Communists will follow through with 
the present program, for they have vacillated in the past over the 
timing, speed, and even the practical value of mechanizing farm tasks. 
Furthermore, heavy industry still is accorded overriding priority 
in plans for economic growth. Moreover, although the Communists 
have hailed the communes as having unique potentialities for modern-
izing agriculture and have designated them as the principal agencies 
for implementing the present program, the Communists said the same 
things about earlier forms of collectivization. To emphasize that 
mechanization will be approached gradually, these communes have been 
instructed to exploit fully their potential for improving simple 
tools and to develop locally managed small- and medium-size plants 
for producing simple implements and low-grade chemical fertilizers. 
The communes are cautioned not to slacken their practical efforts 
at mechanization by merely waiting for tractors and other modern 
machinery, for some years will be required to fulfill the machin-
ery needs of the communes. 221/ Nevertheless, renewed stress on 
mechanization is indicated in the establishment in August 1959 of a

specialized Ministry, the Ministry of the Agricultural Machine-Building 
Industry, to accelerate industrial support for agricultural modern-
ization.* 
To support the vitally important chemical fertilizer program, 
it will be necessary to enlarge the capacity for making heavy-duty 
compressors, high-pressure reactors, turbocompressors, oxygen-making 
equipment, pumps, and other chemical engineering equipment. 222/ It 
is intended that nearly all machines and installations for the manu-
facture of chemical fertilizer will be made in Communist China, with 
only a very small number of automatically controlled tools and imple-
ments to be imported. Shanghai is to undertake the production of 
large amounts of machinery and equipment for local chemical ferti-
lizer works with a production capacity of 2,000 to 25,000 tons 
each. 223/ In 1958 the Harbin Boiler Plant trial-produced a high-
pressure ammonia converter used to make synthetic ammonia, an essen-
tial raw material for nitrogenous. fertilizer. 224/ 
Production of chemical fertilizer equipment is a formidable 
engineering task for the relatively inexperienced machine-building 
industry of Communist China. The principal machines and equipment 
have never been produced before in China and require a relatively 
high level of technique, especially for the high-pressure reflex 
cylinders and high-pressure air compressors. For example, the large 
air compressors on order weigh 290 tons each, the largest single 
ca8ting'weighing more than 20 tons. Driven by huge 4,000-kw motors, 
the rotors of the compressors must be delicately balanced to attain 
high precision in revolution. Moreover, certain difficult problems 
in raw materials must be worked out in production of such complicated 
equipment. 225/ Because much of the chemical equipment requires large 
forgings and castings, substantial advances in production are depend-
ent on the completion of heavy machinery plants now under Construc-
tion. 226/ Inadequate capacity in heavy machinery may prove to be a 
crucial bottleneck. 
Production of equipment for mechanized drainage and irriga-
tion was reportedly increased sharply in 1958. Although official 
statistics tend to blur the distinction between agricultural power 
machinery (nearly all of Which is for irrigation) and all power ma-
chinery, it appears that about 60 to 70 percent of total power ma-
chinery is allocated for agricultural purposes. 227/ The total pro-
duction of agricultural power machinery in 1958 was 1.2 million hp, 
compared with production of probably less than 500,000 hp in 1957. 
Some of the larger plants making diesel engines are involved in this

task, but most of the irrigation equipment is being produced by small-
and medium-scale machine shops run by local governments. 228/ Al-
though numerous press accounts in 1958 indicated that this item would 
get high priority in the allocation of resources and transportation, 
the evidence so far suggests great improvement, but not a "crash" 
program. 229/ 
V. Foreign Economic Relations  
A. Foreign Trade  
1. Value 
About 60 percent of all Chinese Communist imports during 
1953-56 reportedly consisted of machinery and equipment. 230/ This 
proportion declined in 1957 to about 40 percent.* In 1957, Communist 
China imported about $578 million worth of machinery and equipment, 
almost one-half of which came from the USSR.** The total value of 
such imports from the USSR reached a peak in 1956 but declined some-
what in 1957,*** whereas imports of machinery from East Germany and 
Czechoslovakia, the two most important Satellite sources, continued 
to increase. Imports of machinery from the Free World were rela-
tively insignificant through 1955, but the volume of trade has in-
creased markedly since then. Since 1955 the Free World has outranked 
Poland, Hungary, Rumania, and Bulgaria and by the end of 1957 was 
nearly as important as Czechoslovakia, the second most important 
Satellite. 
There has been a striking increase in the proportion of 
machinery and equipment in Chinese imports from the USSR and the 
Free World.**** This increase reflects the efforts of the Peking 
regime to accelerate industrialization under the First Five Year 
Plan (1953-57), following the period of economic recovery (1950-52). 
Quantitative data on Chinese Communist exports of ma-
chinery and equipment are somewhat scanty. Such exports to countries 
of the Soviet Bloc are probably negligible. Exports to the Free 
World consisted of sewing machines, radios, batteries, bulbs, tex-
tile machinery, transport equipment, general industrial machinery, 
and other items. Exports of machine tools were insignificant in 
1957, amounting to only $130,000, but were greatly expanded to about 
$788.000 in 1958. Such exports, however, were limited primarily to

Hong Kong and Thailand, and considerable difficulty had been ex-
perienced in selling Chinese Communist machine tools to other mAr-
kets. 232/ A sizable quantity of textile machinery has also been 
exported under grants and credits to Burma and Indonesia. 
2. Composition 
Complete sets of equipment for new plants have been by 
far the most important item in Chinese Communist imports of machinery 
and equipment from the Soviet Bloc. Trade in complete plants was not 
significant during 1950-52 but expanded rapidly under the First Five 
Year Plan. In 1957, complete plants accounted for more than three-
quarters of Chinese imports of machinery and equipment from the USSR* 
and for 4o to 60 percent of such imports from East Germany and 
Czechoslovakia. 
Of the machines imported that were not included in the 
category of complete plants, the most important were petroleum equip-
ment, metal-cutting machine tools, mining machinery, transportation 
equipment, construction equipment, electrical and communications 
equipment, agricultural machinery, and precision instruments. During 
1953-56, Communist China reportedly imported 21,723 metal-cutting ma-
chine tools, more than 1,400 mining drills, 1,562 freight cars, more 
than 40,000 trucks, and 15,973 tractors.** 
In 1957, imports of Soviet tractors and agricultural ma-
chinery by Communist China decreased precipitously. The number of 
trucks imported in 1957 was only one-tenth that of 1956. This de-
crease reflected the opening of the Chinese truck plant at ChTang-Ch'un. 
To some extent, increased Chinese self-sufficiency was responsible 
for the reduction in imports of machinery in 1957, but shifts in 
policy on agricultural mechanization and a reduced volume of capital 
construction were also contributing factors. 234/ Imports of chemical 
equipment, associated with the expanded program for chemical fertilizers, 
increased in 1957 but did not reach the level achieved in 1955. 
3. Increase of Exports of Machinery 
In spite of numerous offers to export machinery, the 
seriousness of Chinese Communist intentions to export a significant 
proportion of its production has not been established conclusively. 
Chinese activity at trade fairs appears to be directed more toward 
* See Table 23, Appendix B, p. 111, below.

agricultural tractor park, it is believed that a large share of the 
tractors imported were for nonagricultural uses. 233/

displaying machinery and equipment to show the native population the 
industrial development achieved under Communism in China than toward 
finding a market for these products. 235/ Nevertheless, exports of 
machinery, although still small, are increasing rapidly, and the 
Peking regime does appear to be genuinely desirous of increasing 
such exports. Achievement of this goal would have the advantage of 
relieving the strain on Chinese agriculture as a source of goods for 
export. 
B. Self-Sufficiency 
. 1. Achievements and Prospects  
One of the long-term goals of Communist China is the 
attainment of a high degree of economic self-sufficiency. Although 
heavily dependent on the Soviet Bloc for technical assistance and 
capital goods under the First Five Year Plan, China achieved consider-
able success in this endeavor. By the end of 1957, domestic produc-
tion satisfied 60 percent of Chinese requirements for machinery and 
equipment, including 42 percent of the complete sets of equipment re-
quired for the 166 projects receiving Soviet aid.* 236/ 
The draft plan for 1958 called on the machine-building 
industry to provide about 6o percent of all equipment needed for the 
projects receiving Soviet aid. 237/ Communist China seeks to supply 
70 to 80 percent of its requirements for machinery under the Second 
Five Year Plan (1958-62). 238/ Goals for self-sufficiency in certain 
individual commodities to be attained during the period 1958-67 are 
indicated in Table 24.** Although by 1962 the Chinese Communists 
might well achieve production of 70 to 80 percent of their require-
ments for all types of machinery, it is doubtful that some of the 
specific goals will be reached, particularly for items not developed 
under the First Five Year'Plan (1953-57). 
2. Restrictions on Imports of Foreign Capital Equipment 
There are strong indications that Communist China intends 
to pursue a vigorous program of restricting imports of capital equip-
ment. The Chinese Communists know the advantages of importing cer-
tain specialized materials or intricate equipment instead of produc-
ing them under unfavorable conditions. China, however, will avoid 
imports that do not prove technically superior and economically ad-
vantageous. 239/ The Chinese Communists intend to curtail the variety 
of imports of machinery and equipment, 240/ and under this program

goods, see Table 24, Appendix B, p. 112, below.

imports of simple machine tools, transport equipment, light electrical 
equipment, some types of Metallurgical equipment, and machinery for 
light industry probably will be reduced. Nevertheless, it is expected 
that machinery and equipment will continue to constitute a high pro-
portion of total imports. 
As to the relative costs of domestic machinery versus 
imported machinery, several Chinese Communist statements Imply that 
the cost of imported machinery is sometimes two to three times 
greater than that of domestic equipment of the same specifications. 241/ 
Such statements are believed to be misleading because nearly all of 
the imported machinery was of higher quality and complexity than 
Chinese machinery, which, for the most part, consisted of single ma-
chines rather than complete sets. Po 1-po probably had in mind the 
more meaningful objective of replacing imports of heavier and more 
complex machinery when he stated that "any machinery that can be 
made in China should not be imported or imports should be reduced, 
even if quality is lower and the price higher than the imported ma-
chinery." 242/ The cost of production of the Chinese "Liberation" 
truck in 1958 reportedly was 60 percent higher than that of a com-
parable imported vehicle. 243/ It would be normal for the Chinese 
to experience such increased costs during the early years of produc-
tion, although real costs might not be reflected accurately in higher 
prices, because of the hidden subsidies and below-equilibrium prices 
to be found in an arbitrary price system. Nevertheless, expenditures 
on imported machinery have been high, and it is likely that the Peking 
regime could realize large savings in the long run from domestic pro-
duction of some items. However, one of the most significant indica-
tions of Chinese ability to curtail imports of capital goods is the 
ability to produce complete sets of equipment, and in this the Chinese 
Communists are expected to experience considerable difficulty.

APPENDIX A 
DEFINITION OF THE MACHINE-BUILDING INDUSTRY OF COMMUNIST CHINA 
In Chinese Communist statements the concept of machine building is 
somewhat ambiguous and confusing. Most commonly the term is used ge-
nerically and refers to that group of industries engaged in metal'pro-
cessing, including production of machinery and equipment. At times, 
however, the phrase refers specifically to machinery and equipment, 
especially in doctrinal discussions describing the strategic role of 
the machine-building industry in the rapid development of the economy. 
As used in this report, the term machine building is broadly de-
fined to cover all types of metal processing. This definition includes 
production of military goods, which is believed to have been under the 
jurisdiction of the former Second Ministry of Machine Building. In 
Communist China, as in the USSR, there is very little acknowledgement 
of the responsibility of the machine-building industry for production 
of military goods. 
As defined in outline form the machine-building industry may be 
said to include the following: 
1. Metal-processing sector 
a. Machinery and equipment manufacturing 
b. Fabrication of other metal products 
c. Repair 
2. Military goods sector 
a. Weapons and ammunition 
b. Military and civil aircraft 
c. Other military transportation equipment . 
d. Most military and civil electronics equipment 
This classification follows Soviet usage very closely.* 
For purposes of this report, consideration of shipbuilding, pro-
duction of aircraft, and various types of military production is 
limited to investment.

7-7517-71  have been accepted in most cases as the basis of estimates. Estimates for 1958 are preliminary. 
b. Estimated combined production of steam and hydraulic turbines in 1958 was 600,000 kilowatts. 
c. Alternating current only. 
d. Tonnages are given in metric tons throughout this table. 
e. Including diesel, gasolihe, gas generator, and steam engines. 
f. Diesel engines only. 
g. Of the 27,600 horsepower, 17,995 horsepower were diesel engines and 7,458 horsepower were steam engines. 
h. In terms of weight, production in 1952, 1953, and 1954 was 16,298 tons, 24,039 tons, and 23,530 tons, respectively. The disparity between unit production and 
production in terms of weight was caused by shifts to heavier models. 
i. In 1941, the year of highest production before 1949. 
j. Excluding so-called native-style machine tools not produced in regular plants. In spite of this qualification, production in 1958 may not be quite comparable 
to that of other years, because of the inclusion of categories not previously reported. 
k. Including jeeps. 
1. New types only.

c. The 15-horsepower unit is a statistical measure used in the Sino-Soviet Bloc to convert tractors of various types and 
horsepower into comparable units for purposes of planning and accounting. It is calculated by dividing the "rated" draw-
bar horsepower of the tractor by 15. Thus the Soviet DT-54 tractor with a drawbar horsepower of 36 equals two and two-
fifths 15-horsepower units. Drawbar horsepower may be defined as the horsepower equivalent of the pull exerted on the 
drawbar which is affixed to the rear of the tractor, This rating differs from ratings in terms of engine horsepower 
(more specifically brake horsepower) which measure the power delivered by the engine -- generally, the more powerful the 
engine, the greater the drawbar pull, regardless of the type of traator. However, two engines of the same brake horse-
power, one installed in a wheeled tractor and the other in a crawler type, would usually exert different drawbar pulls 
because of the different efficiencies of the two modes of traction. The wheeled tractor makes less efficient use of the 
power of the engine but is indispensable in cultivating row crops. Thus the ability of diverse types of tractors to pull 
drawn implements may be most significantly compared by means of ratings in drawbar horsepower.

APPENDIX C 
MINISTERIAL ORGANIZATION OF THE MACHINE-BUILDING INDUSTRY  
OF COMMUNIST CHINA  
Orginally, machine building in Communist China was controlled by 
the Ministry of Heavy Industry, which was established in 1950. In 
1952 the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Second Ministry 
of Machine Building were created out of the Ministry of Heavy In-
dustry, leaving the latter responsible for metallurgy, chemicals, 
and building materials until its abolition in 1956. (See Figure 6.*) 
The First Ministry of Machine Building was given responsibility for 
production of machine tools, locomotives and rolling stock, auto-
mobiles, electrical equipment, mining machinery, general industrial 
machinery and equipment, and auicultural tools and equipment, as 
well as shipbuilding. Production of arms and munitions was placed 
under the Second Ministry of Machine Building. 
In April 1955 the Third Ministry of Machine Building was estab-
lished as a step to centralize control over the smaller plants that 
did not come under the direct control of the First and Second Minis-
tries of Machine Building. The Third Ministry of Machine Building 
was responsible for the direction of machine and electrical engi-
neering industries of local-state, joint state-private, cooperative, 
and private enterprises. 
In 1956, there occurred a general trend toward ministerial 
specialization. The Third Ministry of Machine Building was abol-
ished in May 1956, a move which coincided with the virtual comple-
tion of socialization of priv6,te and joint state-private enterprises. 
In November 1956, however, a high-ranking Communist was appointed 
Minister of a new Third Ministry of Machine Building, apparently 
with a new responsibility. 279/ The Ministry of Power Equipment 
was established in 1956, apparently to supervise production of elec-
trical and medical equipment. 280/ Thus this ministry probably ab-
sorbed part of the functions of the old First and Third Ministries. 
A basic reorganization of the machine-building industry oc-
curred in February 1958. The Chinese State Council announced 
on 11 February 1958 that the former Second Ministry of Machine 
Building and the Ministry of Power Equipment had been merged with 
the First Ministry of Machine Building and that the Third Min-
istry of Machine Building had been renamed the Second Ministry 
of Machine Building. The incorporation of the Ministry of Power

Equipment into the First Ministry was not unusual, because, as pre-
viously noted, the First Ministry of Machine Building controlled - 
production of this equipment until 1956. More significant was the 
merger of the former Second Ministry of Machine Building, which was 
charged with production of military items, with the First Ministry 
of Machine Building. In November 1957, it was announced that in-
dustrial enterprises engaged in defense production would produce 
50 types of products for civilian use in 1957. Moreover, the head 
of the new First Ministry of Machine Building is General Chao 
Erh-lu, a man with ordnance experience and Minister of the former 
Second Ministry of Machine Building since its establishment in 
1952. His current appointment as head of the new First Ministry 
of Machine Building probably will insure the proper considerations 
of defense and civilian interests within the enlarged responsibility 
of the new ministry. 
In August 1959 a Ministry of Agricultural Machinery was estab-
lished with the purpose of accelerating the mechanization of ? 
Chinese agriculture. 281/ The newly completed Lo-yang Tractor Plant, 
which had been subordinated to the Sixth Industrial Control Bureau 
of the First Ministry, was immediately transferred to the new min-
istry. 282/ Actually, production of tractors, agricultural imple-
ments, and generating equipment used in agriculture, previously the 
responsibility of three bureaus, had been concentrated in the Sixth 
Bureau since February 1958. .2.L./

APPENDIX D 
METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATING TOTAL INVESTMENT IN CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION  
FOR MACHINE BUILDING UNDER TEE FIRST FIVE YEAR PLAN (1953-57) 
OF COMMUNIST CHINA  
According to the announcement on fulfillment of the First Five Year 
Plan (1953-57) of Communist China, total state investment in capital con-
struction amounted to 49.3 billion yuan, of which 56 percent, or 27 bil-
lion yuan, went to industry. 284 During this period the machine-building 
industry reportediy received 26 percent of all industrial investment in 
capital construction. 285/ Therefore, investment in capital construction 
in the machine-building industry would have amounted to 7.18 billion yuan.* 
Reported data for investment in actual machine building -- that is, 
for machinery and equipment manufacturing or for the metal-processing 
sector -- fall far short of the figure of 7.18 billion yuan. The metal-
processing sector accounted for 3.41 billion yuan, or 47.5 percent of 
the total of 7.18 billion yuan. Moreover, it appears to be fairly clear 
that the plants comprising the metal-processing sector were subordinate 
to the First Ministry of Machine Building and the Ministry of Power Equip-
ment Industry until the end of 1957. 287/ The remaining investment (3.77 
billion yuan, or 52.5 percent of the total of 7.18 billion yuan) is 
assumed to have been allocated to industries engaged in military pro-
duction under the former Second Ministry of Machine Building. 
This conclusion is reinforced by an analysis of information on 
plants. It seems impossible that investment both for military pro-
duction and for civilian machine building could be included in the 
figure of 3.41 billion yuan given for the metal-processing sector or 
the 2.58 billion yuan given for machinery and equipment manufacturing.** 
Construction costs for only five major plants amounted to 1.6 billion 
yuan.xxx In that event, only 1.8 billion yuan would be left for all 
other construction, both civilian and military, a situation that 
seems quite unlikely in comparison with the scope of the construction 
program. 
* It should be noted that the percentage figure for machine build-
ing coincides with the planned distribution of investment to machine 
building (6.93 billion yuan out of a total of 26.7 billion) under the 
First Five Year Plan. 2.?..Y 
** See Table 7, Appendix B, p. 90, above. 
xxx The five plants are the Lo-yang Tractor Plant the Tientsin 50X1 
Tractor Plant, the Ch'ang-ch'un Automobile Plant the Fu-la-erh- 50X1 
chi Heavy Machinery Plant, and the T'ai-yuan Heavy Machinery Plant. 
Part of this construction extended beyond 1957, the terminal year of 
the First Five Year Plan.
