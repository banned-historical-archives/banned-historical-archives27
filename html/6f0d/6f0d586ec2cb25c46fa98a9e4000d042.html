 MEMORANDUM FOR:   Director of Central Intelligence
 SUBJECT:          Comments on General Sam Griffiths'
 Introduction to Mao Tse Tung's
 Yu Chi Chan.
 1.  This memorandum requests action on the part of the
 Director of Central Intelligence, in the form of signing the attached
 personal letter to General Samuel V. Griffithi-,  General Griffith;.
 has forwarded to you a draft of his Introduction to his original
 translation of Mao Tse Tung's Yu Chi Chan.
 25X1
 2.  In the estimate of th                          General Griffith44'
 introduction is a. tangible contribution to the interpretation of Mao Tse
 Tung's classic.  So long as General Griffith's' effort is viewed in the
 above light, it can scarely be faulted.
 3.  If the General's interpretation is regarded as a global
 reference point for GW, it becomes misleading and subject to valid
 difference of opinion.  For example, there is no reference to nationalism
 as a factor, and to full outside provocation.  Again using the global
 spectrum, it is felt that the insistence on political indoctrination will
 not hold up.  (The Meos would tend to refute this - their political
 sophistication, if any, is minimal; they are fighting to maintain their
 home land.    This applies also to the Spanish guerrilla effort in the
 Napoleonic wars, which he cites).  Exception is also taken to the
 concept that once Phase One is completed (political indoctrination of
 th
 e masses), the process is not reversible.
 4.  In sum, if viewed as General Griffiths may have intended it
 to. be, i. e. , interpretation of Mao's work, Limited to China, the effort is
 a solid contribution.

 Dear Mr. Dulles,
 I must apologize for having taken so long to get this to you.
 Praeger, who will publish this "Introduction" together with MW
 original translation of Mao's Yu Chi Chan as "Mao Tse-tung on Guer-
 rilla War" on 13 October put me on a "crash" schedule.
 We are enjoying it very much here, and I am proceding all out
 on revision of ny,Oxford doctoral thesis, which will be published
 in the spring by the Clarendon Press.  This is a new and I hope
 definitive translation of Sun Tzu's classic "Art of War", with a
 six chapter "Introduction" by me.
 I will see that you get an author's complimentary copy of each
 o  Vese earth-shaking tomes.

 At the other and of this spectrum a tired man wearing a greasy felt

 between sandalled feet, a Browning automatic rifle.  Hooked to his belt,
 two dirty canvas sacks, one holding three homemade bombs, the other
 four magazines loaded with.30 calibre ammunition.  Draped around his
 neck, a sausage-like cloth tube with three days' supply of rice.  The

 the stock of the Browning three times, pauses, slaps it again twice, and

 "ties.
 It is probable that gu
 nationalist and revolutionary
 ties revolved that the tempo of "wars of liberation" should be stepped
 up.  Exactly a month later (6 January 1.961) the Soviet Premier, an unim-
 peachable authority on "national liberation wars", propounded an inter-
 esting series of questions to which he provided equally interesting on-
 awers:
 no attention to this warning.
 In December 1960 delegates of eighty-one Con zunist and Workers pa
 in nature, will flare up in one or more of half a dozen countries during
 the next few years.  Those outbreaks nay not initially be inspired, or-
 ganized or led t  local, communists - indeed, it in probable that they
 will not be.  But they will receive the moral support and vocal encour-
 agement of international Communism, and where circumstances permit,
 expert advice and material assistance as well.
 As early as November 1949 we had this assurance from China's Number
 Two Communist, Uu Shao-r hai, when, speaking before the Australasian
 Trade Unions Conference in Peking, he prophesied that there would be
 other Asian revolutions which would follow the Chinese pattern.  We paid

 Implicit to the farther assurance that any popular movement infiltrated
 and captured by the communists will develop an anti moteern character
 definitely tinged, in our own hemisphere at least, with a distinctive
 anti-American coloration.
 This should not surprises us if we remember that several hundred
 millions less fortunate than we have Arrived, perhaps reluctantly, at
 Vie conclusion that the western peoples are dedicated to the per-
 petuation of the political, social and economic statt tus guo.  In the
 not too distant past vokny of these millions looked hopefully to America,
 Britain or !rAnce for help toward the realization of their justifiable
 sepirat-tons.  But today many of them: feel that these aims can be achieved
 only by a desporste revolutionary struggle which we will probably oppose.
 This is not an hypothesis, it is fact.
 A potential revolutionary situation exists in any country where
 the government consistently fails in its obligation to insure at least
 a minimally decent standard of life for the great majority of its citi-
 zens.  If there also exists even the nucleus of a revolutionary party
 able to supply doctrine and organization there remains but one missing

 In many countries there are but two n .es, the rich and the mis--

 r;erchsnts, bankers, doctors, lawyers, ongineers - lacks forceful lender-
 ship, is fragmented by unceaoing factional quarrels and is politically
 ineffective. Its program, which usually posits a socialized society
 and some form of ? ihoral p +rliaamentary democracy, is anathen  to the
 exclusive and tightly snit possessing minority.  It is also rejected
 by the frustrated intellectual. youth who move irrevocably toward violent
 revolution. To the illiterate and destitute, it represents a package

 People who live at subsistence lev,i want first things to be put
 first. They are not particularly interested in freedom of religion,
 freedom of the press, free enterprise as we understand it, or the secret
 ballot.  Their needs are more basics land, tools, fertilisers, something
 better than rags for their children, a house instead of a shack, freedom
 from police oppression, medical attention, primary schools.  Those who
 have known only poverty have begun to wonder why they should continue
 to wait passively.  They see - and not always through red-tinted glasses -
 examples of peoples who have changed the structure of their societies
 and they ask, *Wtaat have we to lose?"  When a great many people begin to
 ask themselves this question, a revolutionary guerrilla situation is in-
 cipient.
 A revolutionary war is never confined within the bounds of military
 action.  Because its purpose is to destroy an existing society and its
 institutions and to replace them with a completely new state structure,
 any revolutionary war is a unity of which the constituent parts, of va-
 riable importance, are military, political, economic, social and psycho-
 logical.                          For this reason it is endowed with a dynamic quality and a
 dimension in depth which orthodox wars, of whatever scale, lack.  This
 is particularly true of revolutionary guerrilla war, which is not suscept-
 ible to the type of superficial military treatment frequently advocated
 by antediluvian doctrinaires.
 It is often said that guerrilla warfare is primitive.  This general-

 isation is dangerously misleading and true only in the technological
 sense.  If one considers the picturo as a whole a paradox is immediately
 apparent and the primitive form is seen to be in fact more sophisticated
 than nuclear war or atomic war or war as it was waged by conventional
 armies, navies and air forces.  Guerrilla war is not dependent for suc-
 cess on the efficient operation of complex mechanical devices, highly
 organized logistical systems, or the accuracy of electronic computers.
 It can be conducted in any terrain, in any climate, in any weather; in
 swamps, in mountains, in farmed fields,.4           Its basic element is
 man, and man is more complex than any of his machines.  He is endowed
 with intelligence, emotions and will.  Guerrilla warfare is therefore
 suffused with, and reflects, man's admirable qualities as well as his
 less pleasant ones.  While it is not always humane, it is bi ean, which
 is more than can be said for the strategy of extinction.
 In the United States we go to considerable trouble to keep soldiers
 out of politics, and even more to keep politics out of soldiers.  Guer-
 rillas do exactly the opposite.  They go to great lengths to make sure
 that their men are politically educated and thoroughly aware of the issues
 at stake.  A trained and disciplined guerrilla is much more than a patri-
 otic peasant, workman or student armed with an antiquated fowling-piece
 and a home-made bomb.  His indoctrination begins even before he is tqugbt
 to shoot accurately and it is unceasing.  The and product is an intensely
 loyal and politically alert fighting man.
 Guerrilla leaders spend a great deal more time in organization,

 their most irportsrt job Is to udn over the people.   We must patiently
 explain," aayv Mao Tse-tung.  "Explain", "persuade", "discuss", "con-
 vince* - these words recur with monotonous regularity in many of the
 early Giinese essays on guerrilla war.  icao has aptly compared guerrillas
 to fish, and the people to the water in which they swim.  If the politi-
 cal temperature in right the fish, however few in number, will thrive
 and proliferate.  It is therefore the principal concern of all guerrilla
 leaders to get the water to the right ter,:perature and to keep it there.
 Over ten yaars ago I concluded an analysis of guerrilla warfare
 with the suggestion that the problem urgently demanded further "Serious
 study of all historical experience".  Although a wealth of material
 existed then, and much more has since been developed, no such study
 has yet been undertaken in this country, so far as I am aware.  In Indo-
 China and Cuba Ho Chi- uinh and Ernesto (Cho) Guevara were more assiduous.
 One rather interesting result of their successful activities has been
 the common identification of guerrilla warfare with communism.  But
 guerrilla warfare was not invented by the communists.  For centuries
 there have been guerrilla fighters.
 One of the most accomplished of them all was our own Revolutionary hero,

 Profile of a Revolutionist
 ioal power acmes out of the barrel of a gun.
 Mao Tee-tut, 1938
 Mao Tse-tung, the man who was to don the mantle of Lenin, was barn
 1 China in 1893.  His father? an industrious
 former, had managed to acquire several acres, and with this land the
 status of a "middle" peasant.  He was a strict disciplinarian, and Mao's
 youth was not a happy one.  The boy was in constant conflict with his
 father, but found an ally in his mother, whose "indirect tactics" (as
 he once described her methods of coping with her husband) appealed to
 him.  But the father gave his rebellious son educational opportunities
 which only a tiny minority of Chinese were then able to enjoy.  Mao's
 primary and secondary schooling use thorough.  His literary taste was
 catholic; while a pupil at the provincial normal school he read omnivorously.
 This indiscriminate diet included Chinese philosophy, poetry, history and
 romances as well as translations of many western historians, novelists and
 biographers.  However, history a
 cal sciences particularly ap-
 pealed to him; In them, he sought, but without success, the key to the
 future of China.
 His studies had led him to reject both democratic liberalism and par-
 liamentary socialism as unsuited to his country.  Time, he reali$ed,
 was running out for China.  History would not accord her the privilege of
 gradual political, social and economic change; of a relatively painless
 and orderly evolution.  To survive in the power jungle, China had to change,

 to change radically, to change fast.  But how?
 Shortly after graduating from Normal wool in 1917, Mae stpted
 a position an assistant in the Peking University library.  Here he an-
 sociated himself with the Marxist study groups set up by Li Tao-chap
 and Chaen Tu-hsiu; here he discovered Lenin, read his essays, pored
 over Trotsky's explosive speeches, and began to study Marx and Bagels.
 By 1920, 3 aao was a convinced coirsuunist and a man who had discovered
 his missions  to create a new China according to the doctrine of Marx
 and Lenin.  When the C.C.P. was organized in Shanghai in 1921, Mac joined
 The China Mao decided to change was not a notion in the accepted
 sense of the word.  Culturally.. China was of course homogeneous; polit-
 ically and economically China was chaos.  The peasants, four hundred
 million of them. lived from day to day at subsistence level.  Tens of
 millions of peasant families owned no land at all.  Other millions cul-
 tiva-ted tiny holdings from which they scraped out enough food to sus-
 tain life.
 The peasant was fair game for everyone.  Pillaged by tam collectors,,
 by landlords and usurers, at the mercy of rapacious soldiery and
 bandits, afflicted by blights, droughts, floods and epidemics, his single
 stark problem we simply to survive.  The tough ones did.  The others
 ly starved, died of disease, and in the fierce winters of North
 China and Manchuria, froze to death.
 It is difficult for an American today to conceive tens of thousands
 of small comities in which no public services existed, in which there

 were no doctors, no schools, no running water, no electricity, no paved
 streets and no sewage disposal.  The inhabitants of these communities
 were with few exceptions illiterate; they lived in constant fear of
 army press gongs and of provincial officials who called them out
 ant, in his own expressive idiom, "ate bitterness" from the time he could
 walk until he was laid to rest in the burial plot beneath the cypress
 trees.  This was feudal China.  Dormant within this society were the
 ingredients which were soon to blow it to pieces.
 An external factor had for almost a century contributed to Vie chaos
 of China:  the unrelenting pressure and greed of foreign powers.  French,
 British, Germans and Russians vied with one another in exacting from a
 succession of corrupt and feeble governments commercial,, juridical and
 and winter alike to work on military roads and dikes.  The Chinese pen

 Shortly after Chiang gaaai Shek took command of the National Ra9er-
 lutionary Army in 1926, Mao went to Haan to stir up the peasants.  The
 campaign he waged for land reform in his native province can almost be
 described as a one-man show.  The fundamental requisite in China was
 them, as it had long been, to solve the land question.  Reduced to ele-
 mentary terms, the problem was how to get rid of the gentry land-owners
 who fastened themselves to the peasants like so many leaches and whose
 financial concessions which had do faoto turned ?hini

 exactions kept the people constantly impoverished,  In the circumstances
 there wce only one way to accomplish this necessary reform: expropria-
 tion and redistribution of the land.  Naturally, the Nationalists, eager
 to retain the support of the gentry (historically the stabilizing element
 in Chinese society) considered such a radical solution social dynamite.
 But in Mao's vie4here could be no meaningful revolution unless and until
 the power of this very class had been completely eliminated,
 While Mao was making himself extremely unpopular with the landed
 gentry in Hunan the revolutionary armies of the Kuo Min Tang were march-
 ing north from Canton to Wuhan on the Yangtze, where a Nationalist gov-
 rnment was established in December 1926.  These armies incorporated a
 number of communist elements.  Nast by the time the vanguard divisions
 of Chianges army reached the outskirts of Shanghai in March 1927, the
 honeymoon was almost over.  In April, Chiangas secret police captured
 and executed the radical labor leaders in Shanghai and began to purge
 the army of its communist elements.  In the meantime the left-wing govern-
 merit in Wuhan had broken up.  The communists walked out; the Soviet advis-
 ors pocked their bags and started for home.
 While the Generalissimo was thus engaged, the communists were hav-
 ing their own troubles, and these were serious.  The movement was liter-
 ally on the verge of extinction.                       Those who managed to escape Chiang's
 secret police had fled to the south and assembled at Ching Kong Shan,
 a rugged area in the Fukien-Kiengai borderlands. One of the first to
 reach this haven was the agrarian agitator from Hunan.  As various groups

 that the doctrine of Kremlin infallibility is so frequently challenged
 by Peking.
 In October, 1930 the Generalissimo, in the misguided belief that
 he could crush the communists with no difficulty, announced with great
 fanfare a "Bandit Suppression Campaign".  This was launched in December.
 How weak the Nationalists really were was now to become apparent.  The
 campaign was a complete flop.  Government troops ran away or surrendered
 to the coemtuniste by platoons, by companies, by bsttslions.  Three more
 "Suppression" campaigns, all failures, followed this fiasco.  Finally,
 in 1933, the Generalissimo reluctantly decided to adopt the plans of his
 German advisors and to comanoit well-equipped, veil-trained and loyal
 "Central" divisions to a coordinated and methodical compression of the
 corns antat-controlled area.  As the Nationalists inched southward, sup-
 ported by artillery and aviation, they evacuated peasants from every
 village and town and constructed hundreds of mutually supporting wired--

 ants they had laboriously converted, found themselves for the first

 Strategy, Tactics and Logistics in Revolutionary War
 '"ire first law of war is to preserve ourselves and
 destroy the eneW.0
 Mao Tee-tong, 1937
 Mao has never claimed that guerrilla action alone is decisive in
 a Struggle for political control of the state, but only that it is a
 possible, natural and necessary development in an agrarian-based revo-
 lutionary war.
 MAO conceived this type of war as passing through a series of
 merging phases, the first of which is devoted to organization, consoli-
 dation and preservation of regional. base areas situated in isolated
 and difficult terrain.  Here volunteers are trained anc indoctrinated,
 and from here agitators and propagandists set forth, individually or in
 small groups of two or three, to *persuade" and "convince" the inhabi-
 tants of the surrounding countryside and to enlist their support.  In
 effect, there Is thus woven about each bass a protective belt of sym-
 pathisers willing to supply food, recruits and information. The pattern
 of the proeek#,:its conspiratorial, clandestine, methodical and progres-
 sive.  Military operaaic+tas 'wfl ba'`epordic.
 In the next phase-direct action assumes an ever increasing import-
 ance.  Acts of sabotage and terrorism multiply; collaborationists and
 "reactionary elements" are liquidated.  Attacks are aede on 4ulnerable
 military and police outposts; weak columns are ambushed.  The primary'

 purpose of these operations is to procure arms, ai unition and other
 the
 s     radios.  As
 particularly mc'di c +l suppl.ie  a
 essential material,
 growing guerrilla force becoies better equipped and its capabilities
 improve, political agents proceed with indoctrination of the inhabitants
 of )eriphereai districts soon to be absorbed into the expanding "liber-
 ated" area.
 One of the primary objectives during the first phases is to par--
 susde as many people as possible to commit themselves to the movement,,
 so that it gradually acquires the quality of amass".  Local "home guards"
 or militia are formed.  The militia is not primarily designed to be a
 mobile fighting force; it is a "back-up" for the better trained and
 equipped guerrillas.  The home guards farm an indoctrinated and partially
 trained reserve.  They function as vigilantes.  They collect information,
 force merchants to make "voluntary" contributions, kidnap particularly
 obnoxious local landlords and liquidate informers and collaborators.
 Their function is to protect the revolution.
 Following Phase I (organization, consolidation and preservation)
 and Phase II (progressive expansion) comes Phase III: decision, or des-
 truction of the enevy.  It is during this period that a significant per-
 centage, of the active guerrilla force completes its transformation into
 an orthodox establishment capable of engaging the enevy in conventional
 battle.    This phase may be protracted by "negotiations".  Such negotiations
 are not originated by revolutionists for the purpose of arriving at amicable
 arrangements with the opposition.  Revolutions rarely compromise. compro-
 mises are made only to further the strategic design.  Negotiation, then,

 is undertaken for the dual purpose of gaining time to buttress a position
 (military, political, social, economic) and to veer down, frustrate and
 harass the opponent.  Few, if any, essential concessions are to be expected
 from the revolutionary side, whose Aim is only to create conditions which
 will preserve the unity of the strategic line and guarantee the develop-
 ment of a "victorious situation".

 Intelligence is the decisive factor in planning guerrilla operations.
 " dhere is the enemy?  In what strength?  What does he propose to do?  What
 is the state of his equipment, his supply; his morals?  Are his loaders
 intelligent, bold and imaginative or stupid and impetuous?  Are his troops
 tough, efficient and well disciplined, or poorly trained end soft?"   Guer-
 rillas expect the mer!bers of their intelligence service to provide the
 answers to these and dozens more detailed questions.
 Guerrilla intelligence nets are tightly organized and pervasive.    In
 a guerrilla Area every person without exception must be considered an
 agent.  Old men and women, boys driving ox carts, girls tending goats,
 fans laborers, store-keepers, school teachers, priests, boatmen, scaven-
 gers.                         The local cadres "put the heat" on evefyone without regard to age
 or sex to produce all conceivable information.  And produco It they do.
 As a corollary, guerrillas deny all irfcriptation of themselves to
 their onemy who is enveloped In an impenetrable fog.  Total inability

 China and of the French in both Indo-China and Algeria.  This in a char-
 acteristic feature of all guerrilla w errs.  The enemy stands as on a light-
 ed stage; from the darkness around hire thousands of unseen eyes study
 intently his every ;move, his every gesture.  "hen ;;e strikes out he hits
 the air; his antagonists eve in ub tantial, as intangible as fleeting

 Because of superior infor:aration guorrillen alweys engage under con-
 dit-1on  of their own choosing; because of sujerior knowledge of terrain
 they are able to use it to their advantage and the enemy's discomforture.
 Guerril-les fight only when the chances of victory are weighted henvily
 in their favor; if the tt le of battle unexpectedly flows against them
 they withdraw.  They rely on i^Aginative leadership, distraction, surprise
 and mobility to create a victorious situation before battle is joined.

 cious and of short duration.  Many are harrasaing in nature; others de-

 their effort is alloys to Peer the situation as fluid as possible; to
 strike %hore any? when the enemy least expects them.  Only in this way
 can they retain the initiative and so be assured of freedom of action.

 leadership, or to distract his attention from an area in which a more
 decisive blow is imminent, "running, away" is thug paradoxically offensive.
 Guerrilla operations conducted over a wide region are necessarily
 decentralized.  Each regional corder must be familiar with local con-
 ditions end is expected to take advantage of local opportunities.  The
 same applies to commands in subordinate districts.  This decentralization
 is to some extent forced upon guerrillas because they ordinarily lack a
 well-developed system of technical communications.  But at the same time
 decentralization for normal operations has many advantages, particularly
 if local leaders are ingenious and bold.
 The enemy's rear is the guerrillas' front; they themselves have no
 rear.  Their logistical problems are solved in a direct and elementary
 fashions the enemy in the principal source of weapons, equipment and
 aam unition.

 It is interesting to examine Mao's strategical and tactical theories
 in the light of his principle of "unity of opposites".  This seems to be
 an adaptation to military action of the ancient Chinese philosophical
 concept of f-. am.  Briefly, the XLn and the YAM are elemental and
 pervasive.  Of opposite polarities, they repres  t meal                       d,,-k
 and ~~~ eat and cold                     recession Their reciprocal
 interaction is endless.  In terms of the dialectic, they may be likened
 to the thesis and antithesis from which the synthesis is derived.
 An important postulate of the =-Tan         theory is that concealed within
 strength there is weakness and within weakness, strength.  It is a weak-
 ness of guerrillas that they operate in small groups which can be wiped
 out in a matter of minutes.  But simply because they do operate in small
 groups they can move rapidly and secretly into the vulnerable rear of
 the enemy.
 In conventional tactics, dispersion of forces invites destruction;
 in guerrilla war this very tactic is desirable both to confuse the enemy
 and to preserve the illusion that the guerrillas are ubiquitous.
 It is often a disadvantage not to have heavy infantry weapons avail-
 able, but the very fact of having to transport them has until recently
 tied conventional columns to roads and well-used tracks.  The guerrilla
 travels light and travels fast.  He turns the hazards of terrain to his
 advantage and makes tropical rains, heavy snow, intense heat and freezing
 cold his ally.  Long night marches are difficult and dangerous, but the
 darkness shields his approach to an unsuspecting enemy.

 In every apparent disadvantage there is some advantage to be found.
 The converse is equally true, in each apparent advantage lie the seeds
 of disadvantage.  The f is not wholly =, nor the  ant wholly IM.

 of distraction on the one hand and concentration on the other; to fix
 the enemy's attention and to strike where and when he least anticipates
 the blow.
 Guerrillas are   stern of the arts of si ulntion and dissimulation;
 they create pretenses and simultaneously disguise or conceal their true
 semblance.  Their tactical concepts, dynamic and flexible, are not out
 to any prarticular pattern.  But Mao's first law, of wear, to preserve
 one's self and destroy the enemy, is always gover    .

 "Historical experience is written
 in blood and iron."
 Mao Tse-tung, 1937
 The fundamental difference between patriotic partisan resistance
 and revolutionary guerrilla Love +eents is that the first usually looks
 the ideological content which always distinguishes the second.
 A resistance is characterized by the quality of spontaneity; it
 begins and then is organized.  A revolutionary guerrilla movement is
 organized and then begins.
 A resistance is rarely liquidated, and terminates when the invader
 is ejected; a revolutionary movement terminates only when 't has succeeded
 in displacing the incumbent government or is liquidated.
 Historical experience suggests that there is very little hope of
 destroying a revolutionary guerrilla movement after     a   ura   iv +e   he
 first       and  hags a  aired the     ehtet o - s%lpp - .rt ref t gignificant
 nagmennt of the  pulatia n.  The size of this "significant segment" will
 vary; a decisive figure might range from fifteen to twenty-five percent.
 In addition to an appealing program and popular support, such fac-
 tors an terrain, communications, the quality of the opposing leadership,

 Here determinants 1, 2, 8 and 9 definitely favored the guerrillas,
 who also (unlike Castro) had an available sanctuary.  Two others, 3 and
 6, might have been considered in balance.  Although the Viet Minh had
 demonstrated superior tactical. ability in guerrilla situations, an'ez-
 perienced observer might have been justified in weighing "military ef-
 ficieneya equally; the French were learning.

 squirted from a flame-thrower-like gun, that
 seeps into foxholes and bunkers.  Seconds later,
 fed by oxygen from the air, it blows up with
 terrific force.
 Apparently we are to assume that guerr..h:las will conveniently ar:sconce
 themselves in rea?ily identifiable "foxholes and bunkers" awaiting the
 arrival of half a dozen admirals armed with "flame-thrower-like goner"

 they will.  Constant efforts should be made to reprove: communication,

 The position of active third parties in a revolutionary guerrilla
 war and the timing, nature and scope of the assistance given to one
 side or the other has become of great importance.  Basically, this is
 a political matter; responsibility for a decision to intervene would
