					[TextJ    	Tokyo,   	Jul  27,   	JPS--AKAHATA  reported  on  July  27  Chat  precaution  is
					rising  within  the  Japaneae  Government  that  the  economic  relatione  between
					Japan  and  the  U.S.  will  be  atrained  again.
					One  of  the  reasons  for  this  ie  that  the  receaeion  has  begun  in  the  U.S.
					It  ia  cerCain  now  that  the  U.S~  will  go  into  a  period  of  etagflation,   	in-
					flation  and  receseion  going  at  the  same  time.    	In  thie  eituation,   	Che
					Foreign  Mini~try  sources  eay,   	"there  is  a  poaeibility  that  the  strong  dis-
					satiafaction  againat  the   	(Carter  adminisCration's)  domestic  economic  policy
					in  the  industrial  and  political  ciralea  in  the  U.S.  will  be  changed  into  a
					temper  that  will  blow  up  against  abroad,   	especially  Japan."
					As  the  presidential  election  will  be  held  next  year,   	the  Carter  adminiatra-
					tion  may  also  conclude  that  taking  tough  attitude  toward  Japan  will  be
					beneficial  to  his  campaign.
					Under  this  circumstance,   	eome  Foreign  Ministry  officiale  eay,   	"Japan  must
					ask  the  U.S.   	to  carry  out  an  effective  policy  to  cope  with  the  problems  of
					energy  and  inflation,"  although  they  are  doubtful  of  the  effect  of  the
					energy  saving  policy  released  rec~:itly  by  the  Carter  administrat{.on.
					AnoCher  government  eource,   	on  the  other  hand,   	eaid  that  it  is  important
					for  Japan  to  carry  out  what  ahould  be  done  in  the  light  of  the  international
					diviaion  of  labor,   	demanding  that  an  ad~ustment  with  the  U.S.  be  made
					promptly,  which  requires  sacrifices  of  the  people.

			   	Co  VladivosCok  Is  Confirmed"]
			   	[Text)    	It  was  confirmed  on  18  June  that  the  Soviet  aircraft  carrier  "Minsk,"
			   	reportedly  assigned  to  the  Soviet  Union's  Pacific  fleet,  had  passed  Chrough
			   	the  Strait  of  Malacca  and  it  is  now  a  reliable  fact  that  it  will  stay  a  stone's
			   	throw  away  from  Japan  at  Vladivostok.    	In  Che  present  day  when  tensions  be-
			   	Cween  Japan  and  the  USSR  are  increasing,  what  meaning  does  the  "Minsk"  hold
     	~		    	for  the  safety  of  Japa:1?    	Let  us  assay  calmly  the  new  aims  of  Soviet  straCegy
			   	in  Asia.
			   	There  is  a  fable  called  "The  Boy  Who  Cried  Wolf."    	This  series  of  uprosrs
			   	over  the  "riinsk"  is  not  unlike  that  fable.    	At  first  in  th~  middle  of  the
			   	China-Vietnam  dispute  this  March  we  heard,  "The   	'Minsk'   	has  appeared  in  the
			   	Mediterraneanl"    	The  uproar  continued  when  it  was  sighted  off  the  coasts  of
			   	Angola,  Mozambique  and  Mauritius:    	"It's  the   	'Minek'!",   	"Heading  for  the
			   	Pacific!",   	and  "Poses  a  Terrible  Threat!".
			   	Then  on  18  June,   	it  was  finally  confirmed  that  it  had  passed  through  the
			    	Strait  of  Malacca.    	In  due  course,   	it  is  certain  to  be  assigs~ed  to  the  Soviet
			    	Pacific  Fleet  which  is  based  at  Vladivostok,  a  mere  stone's  throw  away  from
			    	the  Japanese  archipelago.
			    	However,   	the  reaction  of  the  Defense  Agency  and  of  military  experts  towards
			    	this  has  been  surprisingly  cool.
			    	"Of  course,  while  it  concerns  only  a  limited  area,   	it  broadens  thei`r  command
			    	of   	tae  air  and  sea  and  alters  their  power  relationship  with  the  U.S.   	7th  Fleet.
			    	Speaking  frankly,  if  the  area  around  Japan  is  unsettled,   	it  will  after  all  dis-
			    	turb  us,  but  it  is  more  or  less  a  political  presence  one  finds  in  peaceCime,
			    	in  other  words,  s  kind  of  gunboat  diplomacy,  and  it's  not  being  taken  as  such
			    	a  serious  threat."    	(A  member  of  the  Defense  Agency  high  command.)						~

			     	said  to  be  the  moat  powerful  in  the  world~   	the   	~Minsk'   	poses  no  problem  at  a11."
			     	(~iideo  Sekino,  milieary  commenCator)
			     	We11  tihen,   	is  the  "Minsk"  which  has  caused  this  much  commorion  simply  norhing
			     	more  than  a  sheep  in  wolf's  clothing?    	The  answer  is  "No."    	On  this  poinr,  Mr
			     	Mineo,  quoting  ~:~viet  Navy  commander  Gorshkov,   	"Naval  power  will  be  used  gs
			     	a  political  eoo1,"  expli~ins:														  	'
			     	"PuCCing  aside  the  pure  military  strength  of  the  "Minsk,"  the  passage  of  the
			     	"Minsk"  through  the  Strait  of  Malacca  signifies  thae  Gorshkov-style  world
			     	strategy  has  finally  begun  in  the  Pacific.    	We  can  perhaps  say  thaC  the  battle
			     	lin~s  have  been  drawn  up  with  the  American  navy,  which  until  now  has  en~oyed
			     	an  overwhelming  strength  in  the  Western'Pacific.   	It  is  said  that  the  waves  in		 	'
			     	these  rough  ~eas  can  be  felt  all  the  way  from  Malacca  to  the  Philippines."
			     	In  a  greater  sense,  beneath  that  sheep's  skin,   	the  "Minsk"  has  another,   	un-
			     	adorned,   	face,  more  powerful  than  that  of  the  wo1f,   	that  of  the  ferocious			 	,
			     	polar  bear  "world  straCegy."														  	~
			     	How  is  the  area  around  Japan  drawn  in  the  Soviet  blueprints  based  upon  this
			     	strategy?    	Before  [we  answ~r  this  question],   	let  us  briefly  look  at  the  true
			     	nature  of  the  "Minsk."															     	~
			     	The  USSR  did  not  have  a  real  aircraft  carrier  until  1967.    	The  .firsc  was  the
			     	helicopter  carrier  "Moskva,"  with  a  capacity  of  18  anti-submarine  helicopters.
			     	The  "Kiev"  was  the  next  development,  and  was  commissioned  at  the  Nikolayev
			     	naval  station  on  the  north  coast  of  the  Black  Sea  in  1976.    	The  "Minsk"  is

			     	Howevcr,   	and  here   	ChaC  sheep-like  facet  emerges,   	for  a  fighC~r  plane,   	the  YaK
			     	36  verCical  takeoFf  ~ngine  is  large,  a  burden  on  its  performance,   	ies   	top  speed
			     	[being]  mach  0.85,  and  its  range  ~75  mi~.es.    	It  3s  no  match  for  Che  F4J/N
			     	cnrried  by  U.S.  aircraft  carriers.with  a  speed  of  mach  2.2  and  ~  run~e  of  5Q0
			     	miles.    	Moreover,   	there  is  a  report  from  a  WesCern  source  thaC  during  tgkeofti
			     	and  landing  ~ests  aboard  the  "Kiev"  coith  rhe  YaK  36,   	the  heat  from  tlic  3rt
			     	exhausts  melCed  the  flighC  deck,  which   	(they  then]   	repaired  wirh  a  spECial
			     	rosin.
			     	And  yet  on  top  of  Chis,   	the  fl3ght  deck  is   	eoo  shore  for  non-VSTOL  attack
			     	planes,   	and  it  lacks  any  complex  equipment  such  as  launching  caCapults  or
			     	arresCing  wires  for  landings.    	In  addiCion,  because  patrol  planes  cannot  be
			     	carried,   	its  early  warning  capability  is  poor.    	And  since  it  musC  reduce  its
			     	speed  Co  the  level  of  10  knots  in  order  for  the  V/STOL  to  take  off  or  1and,
			     	its  mobility  as  an  aircraft  carrier  is  assessed  as  considerably  limited.
			     	Based  on  these  facts,  Mr  Sekino  says  that  in  case  the  U.S.   	and  SovieC  fleets
			     	should  clash  at  sea,   	"The  U.S.  Navy,  making  the  most  of  its  range,  would  spot
			     	the  Soviet's  movements  without  delay.    	First,   	the  electronic  warfare  plane
		-		    	EA-6B  wauld  gather  informaCion;  on  the  Soviet  surface-Co-air  missile,   	(SAM)
			     	effective  range  and  cause  ~amming.    	Soon  aftier,   	attack  planes  and  fighter-
			     	bombers  would  arrive  and  suppress  the  SAMs  and  electronic  countermeasure
			     	system  (ECM)  with  anti-radar  missiles  and  the  like;   	F4  or  F14  fighter  planes		   	~
			     	would  rout  the  YaK  36's.    	It  is  certain  that  it  would  end  in  a  lopsided  vic-
			     	Cory  for  the  United  StaCes,  no  matter  which  [factor]   	is  considered,  attack
			     	range,   	attack  strength,   	or  electronic  warfare  power."
			     	In  short,   	this  means  that  ~he  "Minsk"  is  not  an  attack-type,  wolf-type  aircraft
			     	carrier  like  the  "Midway,"  "Constellation,"  and  others.
			     	It  is  said  that  unlike  American  and  the  other  Western  countries,  who  when  they
			     	dev~elop  arms,   	first  take  into  consideration  possible  multiple  uses,   	the  USSR		    	`
			     	ordinarily  develops  arms  that  satisfy  single  purposes,  one  by  one.    	For  ex~
			     	ample,   	compared  to  the  F4  which  is  used  by  the  Navy  and  Air  Force  for  ground
			     	support  and  air  control,   	the  MiG  25   	[was  built]   	exclusively  to  int.ercept  the
			     	planned  American  B-1  supersonic  bomber.
			     	For  what  operational  purpose  then  was  the  "Minsk"  built?    	Mr  Sekino  and  Mr
	 	~		   	Mineo  conclude,  "for  antisubmarine  and/or  for  landing  operations."    	One  of				i
			     	the  bases  for  this   	[conclusion]   	lies  in  the  helicopters  she  carries.    	In  the		   	i
			     	Far  East  region,   	the  USSR  attaches  such  importance  to  helicopters  as  a  means
			     	of  transport  that  a  helicopter  force  is  deployed  which  can  transport  16			     	~
			     	battalions  simultaneously.    	"In  a  landing  operation,   	the  "Minsk"  would  first
			     	approach  a  landing  spot  and  the  YaK  36's  would  make  a  ground  attack.    	After
			     	launching  repeated  attracks,   	they  would  effect  an  air-ground  landing,  with
			     	landing  craft  from  the  sea  and  helicopters  from  the  air.    	If  one  might  say  so,
			     	there  is  a  strong  sense  of  [resemblance  to]   	the  American  navy  landing  oper-
			     	ation:,  assault  craft."

			   	was  serialized  in  this  magazine',   	is  unequivocal:
			   	"The   	'Minsk'   	is  purely  and  simply  an  aircraft  carrier  for  landing  operations.
			   	Its  antisubmarine  helicopters  are  for  the  purpose  of  escorting  the  couvoys  at

			   	can  be  used  effectively  only  wiChin  the  air  spaCe  controlled  by  land-based

			   	of  air  forces  in  the   	[Siberian]  ~Iaritime  Provinces  and  in  the  Kuril  Islands,
			    	the  bringing  of  the   	'Minsk'   	inCo  Che  Far  East  can  be  for  no  other  purpose  than
			    	for  conducting  a  landing  operaCion  on  Hokkaido."
			   	What  in  fact  is  the  purpose  behind  posring  the  "Minsk"  Co  the  Soviet  Pacific
			   	Fleet?    	Of  course,   	the  Soviet  authoriCies  remained  silent,   	indifferent  to  the
			    	anxious  Western  countries  as  well  as  Japan,   	and  the  RED  STAR  newspaper  of  the

			    	port,  something  suddenly  begins  to  smell  fishy.
			    	In  1969,   	the  United  States  leased  Diego  Garcia  lsland  in  the  Indian  Ocean
			    	from  England  and  began  to  build  a  straeegic  outpost.    	In  opposition,   	the
			    	Soviet  Union  directed  its  Baltic  and  Black  Sea  fleets  toward  the  Indian  Ocean
			    	and  began  to  move  its  pieces  to  the  are  nf  the  Red  Sea,   	the  Arab  c~untries,
			    	and  Sri  Lanka.    	This  strategy,   	including  an  increase  in  the  number  of  buoys

			    	On  this,  Mr  Mineo  observes,   	"At  last,   	starting  this  year,   	they  have  advanced
			    	east  of  Malacca,  with  the  aim  of  wresting  strategic  control  of  the  seas   	in  the

			   	nnd  has  been  conCriving  to  break  American  control  of.  the  seas.    	We  can  say
			   	rh~t  the   	'Minsk'   	is  an  ~xtension  oF  this  sch~me.    	The  Americ~nq  have  already

			   	rhe  Yhilippines  ~nd  Taiwan,  but  Soviet  strategy-center~d  on  Che  "Minsk,"  h~s
			   	also  broken  through  here,   	in  an  atrempt  to  secure  free  ocean  passage   	to  Che
			   	I'acific  Ocean.
			   	Accordingly,   	the  good  natural  harbors  of  Cam  Ranh  Bay  and  Da  Nang,   	Vietnam's		 	~
			   	miliCary  ~SorCs,   	assume  Sreat  importance.    	If  the  Soviee  Union  were  Co  woo  VieC-
			   	nam  and  succeed  in  turning  Cam  Ranh  Bay  into  a  base  for  the  "Minsk,"   	ehat  would
			   	be   	the  exace  cotinterpart  of  the  "Midway"  Yokosuka  relationship.
			   	For  one  thing,  Mr  Mineo  says  that  with  Cam  Ranh  Bay  and  Da  Nang  as  bases,   	the
			   	5oveit  itnion's  immediate  goal  would  be  to  atCack  the  Bashi  Channel  interdiction
			   	line,  weakened  by  the  withdrawal  of  the  U.S.   	2nd  Army  D~,vision  from  Ta3.wan.
			   	[These  bases]  would  provide  mulCiple  bases  for  the  purpose  of  attacking  Che
			   	peak  of  the  triangle,   	the  Bashi  Channel.
			   	For  another  Ching,   	it  means  that  by  Curning  Vietnam  into  a  Soviet  milttary
			   	base,   	the  Soviet  fleet  could  travel  the  seas  freely,   	from  the  Black  Sea,
			   	through  the  Indian  Ocean,   	as  far  as  Alaska,  wiCh  no  need  to  take  alon~  an  oil
			   	tanker.    	To  go  even  further,   	if  at  Che  same  time,  bases  in  Vietnam  are  built
			   	for  the  50  reportedly  newest  and  most  powerful  Tu  26  "Backfire"  fighter-bombers
			   	(Cop  speed  mach  2.5,   	range  5500  miles)   	that  have  been  stationed  in  the  b'ar
			   	East  since  last  year,   	[Che  area]  almost  up  to  Guam  will  truly  lie  entirely
			   	within  their  radius  of  attack.
			   	Vietnam  once  permitted  a  Soviet  navy  curiser  to  enter  one  of  her  porCs  near
			   	the  end  of  the  China-Vietnam  clash.    	What  attitude  will  she  assume  towards
			   	the  "Minsk"?    	As  long  as  the  situation  does  not  change,   	there  is  the  convinc-
     	~		    	ing  viewpoint  that  she  wi11  permit  no  more  than  refuelling  or  at  most  repairs,
			   	and  that  a  complete  military  base  is  highly  unlikely.
			   	However,   	even  though  the  West  is  only  speculatin~  now,  when  the  Soviet  Union
			   	does  accomplish  its  strategic  intent,   	there  is  no  doubt  that  the  world's
			   	military  map  will  change  totally.    	Mr  Sekino  and  Mr  Mineo  forecast  first  a
     	_		    	Soviet  attack  on  China.
			   	"In  peacetime,   	they  may  use  [naval  power]  as  a  political  or  diplomatic  inter-

			   	�In  the  aense  o�  shooting  fish  in  a  bgrrel,   	Che  Sea  of  Japan  is  in  the  same

			    	by  the  American  forces,  wi11  be  called  "the  Sov~.et  Sea."  Mr  Sekino,   	consider-
			    	ing  the  facC  that  the  Soviet  Union  already  has  3000  fighter-bombera  stationed
			    	in  the  F'ar  East,  analyzes   	[the  situation]  very  severely  thus:	    	,
			    	"xhe  Soviet  Pacific  Fleet  is  no  problem  if  one   	[is  speaking]  only  of  a  clash
			    	between'fleets,  but  it  becomes  a  completely  different  story  if  it  has  air  sup-
			    	port  from  ground  bases,  because  the  U.S.~aircraft  carriers'   	early  warning
			    	planes,  antisubmarine  paCrol  planes,   	etc.,  which  could  be  termed  Cheir  life-
			    	line,  are  tempting  bait  for  Soviet  fighters.    	Even  should  a  second  Korean  war
			    	should  break  out,   	it  is  unthinkable  that  the  U.S.   	7th  Fleet  would  plunge  into
			     	the  Sea  of  Japan  knowing  it  would  become~fish  in  a  barrel."
			    	What  is  even  more  shocking  is  Keitaro  Hasegawa's  opinion  that  "the   	'Minsk'
			    	fs  to  be  used  to  land  un  Hokkaido."    	Undergirding  this  view  is  the  recent
			    	sudden  increase  in  Croops  stationed  on  the  islands  of  Kunashini  and  Etorofu.
			    	The  Defense  Agency  has  3ust  confirmed  that  starting  this  month,   	130mm  cannons,
			     	76mm  howitzers,   	23mm  multi-barrel  self-propelled  anti-sircraft  guns,   	and  such
			    	were  brought  in  on  three  occasions.
			    	The  ob~ective  situation  is  that  already,   	equipment  amounting  to  almost  a
			    	whole  regiment  of  Soviet  motorized  rifle  units  ahs  been  brought  in.    	Further,
			     	two  divisions  of  marines,   	that  may  be  called  a  landing  spearhead,  have  been
			     	posted  on  the  farther-out  Sakhalin,  and  still  more,   	there  is  the  fully  equip-
			     	ped  6th  Airborne  Division  in  Khabarovsk.    	Of  course,   	this  viewpoint  is  based
			     	on  the  premise  that  "the  American  forces,  includi,ng  the  U.S.   	7th  Fleet,  will
			     	not  take  a  hand,"  and  is  such  a  rather  frightening  prospect  likely?    	However,
			     	"It  is  very  possible  that  if  by  some  chance  something  happened  in  Europe,  part
			     	of  the  J.S.   	7th  Fleet  would  head  there,  or  else  its  strength  would  be  cut
			     	as  it  moved  to  the  south  to   	[provide]   	a  standby  supply  line  to  Europe  viu
			     	Hawaii,  Australia,  and  Lombok.    	If  that  should  happen,  the  area  around  Japan
			     	would  be  left  with  a  great  gap   	[in  her  defenses].    	(Mr  Mineo)

			    	LAriyoshJ   	Of  course,   	for  Mr.  Ushiba,   	there  is  no  difficulty  coming  to  an
			    	understanding  with  foreigners.    	Rather,   	on  the  contrary,  you  are  sure  to  throw
			    	90  percent  of  your  energy  into  persuading  the  Japanese  of  the  foreignera'
			    	thinking.   	(laughter)
			    	~shib]   	Well,  well,   	it  seems  you  understand  me.
		_		    	LAriyosh]   	In  my  experience,   	for  example,  when  I  attend  at  ahipping  alliance
		~		    	conference,   	it  is  like  fighting  with  real  awords  because  I  am  representing
		-		    	the  company  and  am  to  obtain  navigation  rights.    	At  those  times,   	it  is  en-
		~		    	tirely  futile  if  I  don't  proceed  with  full  authority.    	It  is  a  miserable  thing
			    	to  attend  such  a  conference  without  the  authority  to  yield  much  now  and  ob-
			    	tain  the  future  in  its  stead,  or,  to  yield  the  left  and  take  with  the  right.
			    	One  can't  do  anything  if  one  ie  depending  on  instructiona  by  telegram  for
			    	everything  from  the  home  office.    	But  in  Japan,  full  authority  is  usually  not
			    	given  to  the  person  out  in  the  field.

					LUshib~    	In  my  case,   	I  generally  disregard  direcC3ves.    	In  the  past,   	rel~tively

					LAriyosh~   	Wt;at  kinds  of  difficulties  do  you  undergo  with  Che  problems  of
	 	-		     	the  partner  country  in  the  negotiaCions?
					LUshib~   	There  is  the  feeling  that  recently,   	no  matter  where,   	each  minisCry
					is  lined  up  side  by  side.    	The  U.S.   	is  so;   	in  the  past,   	if  one  was  talking
					only  with  the  State  Department,   	afCerwards  it   	(the  State  DepartmenC)  generally
					controlled   	(others).    	When  you  go  to  Congress,   	there  are  the  congressional
					leaders.    	And  if  you  speak  with  then,   	generaLly  is  was  settled.    	Nowadays,
					all  are  lined  up  side  by  side.    	The  other  party  in  the  negotiations  is  not
					the  government,  but  sometimes  Che  White  House,   	sometimes  the  Congress.     	Even
					in  Japan,   	there  are  complaints  when  something  is  not  readily  passed  even
					though  the  prime  minisCer  says  fine.    	And  nowadays,   	such  countries  as   	the
					U.S.   	are  ~ust  so.
					~~riyoshJ   	That  is  something  the  Japanese  cannot  understand.    	In  the  U.S.
					~ongress,   	each  congressman  acts  as  his  own  spokesman  on  many  things.    	Such
					as,   	oranges  and  cherries.		Each  for  himself  speaks  with  a  loud  voice.
					~shiba 7   	Each  congressman  proposes  bills  for  passage.    	So  there  are  many
					bills  that  are  shelved.    	Even  though  there  are  many  bills  on  import  limita-
					tions  proposed,  most  are  shelved.    	Lut,   	in  Japan,   	it  is  reported  simply   	that
					the  U.S.   	government  proposed  the  bill.    	Even  a  person  who  thinks  he  knows  a
					great  deal  about  the  U.S.   	errs  in  that  area.
					L~Criyosh ~   	That  is  one  thing  the  ordinary  Japanese  does  not  understand.
					~shibaJ   	I  think  one  more  great  difference  is  that  there  is  neither  a  com-
					munist  party  nor  a  socialist  party  in  the  U.S.    	Therefore,   	there  are  almost
					no  party  disputes  that  move  Congress.    	And,   	the  3cope  of  movement  is  con-
					servative---it  is  conservative  from  left  to  right.    	Consequently,   	there   	is
					always  the  coloring  of  protective  trade  within  that  conservative  coloring.
					Different  from  the  past,   	this  is  an  era  where  there  is  much  interest  in  what
					comes  in  from  a  foreign  country.    	And  then,   	there  is  difficulty  by  reason
			     	of  the  fact  that  exports  have  become  an  exceedingly  grave  concern  for  the  U.S.
			     	LArlyosh~   	My  feeling  about  Japanese  foreign  relations  is  that  Japan's
			     	negotiators  with  foreign  countries  change  too  much.    	For  example,   	the  Japanese

			     	are  the  same,   	is  often  apt  not  to  be  natural  abroad.    	Americans  say  that  Japan

			  	very  forCunate  for  today's  West  Germany.    	Japan  was  as  closed  as  possible  to
			  	foreign  investment.    	That  is  the  biggest  cause  for  Japan's  b~d  reputation.

			    	lText/    	Last  year  during  the  procea~  of  negotiating  the  Sino-Japanese
			    	peace  and   	friendship  Creaty  fears  of  Soviet  reealiaCion  were  voiced  in
			    	some  quareers.    	Fnr  instance,   	the  vi~w  wgs  expreased  that  the  Soviet  Union
			    	might  withdraw  its  ambassador  from  Japan  or  tighCen  up  in  Che  fishing
			    	negotiationa.    	Ae  the  most  extreme  there  was  even  apeculation  that  the
			    	Soviet  Union  might  occupy  Hokkaido.
																								    	r
			    	In  fact,   	these  feara  were  groundlesa.    	Indeed,   	the  Soviet  Union  has  recently
			    	displayed  new  interest  in  improving  Soviet-Japaneae  relations.    	The  direct
			    	expression  of  thie  was  the  opening  of  the  Soviet-Japanese  administrative
			    	level  conference  on  14  and  15  May.    	The  administrative  level  conference
			    	was  a  plan  put  forward  by  Japan  at  the  timi.  of  F'oreign  Minister  Sonoda's
			    	visit  to  the  Soviet  Union  in  January  of  laF~t  year.    	In  the  past  the  acheduled
			    	yearly  Soviet-Japanese  foreign  tniniatera  cnnference  was  often  apt  to  be
			    	postponed,  and  even  when  held  it  resulCed  in  nothing  but  fruitless  confronta-
			    	tion  over  the  northern  territory  issue.    	The  plan  was  aimed  at  trying  a
			    	different  approach  through  a  frank  exchange  of  opinion  and  deepening  of
			    	mutual  underatanding  at  the  administrative  level.
			    	For  a  time  the  Soviets  ahowed  no  reaction  to  this.    	However,  on  9  May  they
			    	suddenly  indicated  their  acceptance.    	Thua  it  came  about  that  Foreign
			    	Ministry  Vice  Minister  Firyubin  and  other  officials  came  to  Japan,  and
			    	administrative  level  talks  were  held  with  Foreign  Ministry  Councilor  Takashima
			    	and  Japaneae  officials.    	Of  cour~e  there  was  no  progress  on  the  northern
			    	territory  issue.    	However,   	at  the  talks,  in  responae  to  the  Japanese  state-
			    	ment  that  "our  fundamental  policy  with  respec~  to  the  Soviet  Union  is  that
			    	we  wish  to  develop  friendly  relations  with  the  nation  which  is  our  most
			    	important  neighbor,"  the  Soviets  responded,  "We  are  in  agreement  with
			    	Japan's  basic  attitude  concerning  Japanese-Soviet  relations,  and  there  is
			    	a  possibility  of  relations  between  the  two  countries  developing  to  a  new
			    	stage."    	There  was  also  ready  agreement  to  "meet  next  in  Moscow."
			    	Prior  to  this,  the  necessity  of  developing  friendly  relations  toward  the
			    	Soviet  Union  was  mentioned  in  the  U.S.-Japanese  ~oint  statement  of  2  May

						abeolute].y  no  negative  i.mpact  upon  the  Soviet  attitude  CoWard  Japan,  of

						treaty  and  the  no:malization  of  U.S.-China  relations  with  followed  it  as
						the  conclusion  of  a  quaei-military  anti-Soviet  alliance,  and  has  increased
						ite  vigilance  and  tightened  up  its  guard.    	The  concrete  expreesion  of  this
						ie  the  poeting  of  an  eatire  brigade  of  ground  forces,  several  thoueand  men,
						to  Kunashiri  and  Etorofu~  and  the  conetruction  of  baees  there.
						Defenae  Agency  officials  are  eaying  that  "it  can  be  cencludtd  that  Chis  ie
						not  an  offenaive  operation  but  ie  for  the  defense  of  the  islands"   	(for
						instance,   	the  briefing  given  by  Defense  Agency  Chief  Yamashita  at  the  LDP
						gathering  on  9  February).    	If  thia  ia  true,  it  ia  not  proper  to  call  it  a
						"retaliation  mesaure."    	However,   	iC  is  certain  that  it  ia  a  concrete  Soviet
						"countermeasure"  to  the  Sino-Japanese  treaty.    	An  additional,  more  fundamental
						countermeasure  Which  muat  be  pointed  out  is  that  the  Soviet  Union  has  taken
						thie  opportunity  to  dieplay  the  reaction  of  re~ecting  even  more  deciaively
					 	the  Japaneee  demand  for  return  of  the  northern  territories.
						For  inataace,   	according  to  New  Liberal  Club  repreaentative  Kono  who  visited
						M~oecow  at  the  end  of  November  last  year  aad  talked  with  Prime  Miniater  Kosygin
					 	and  other  Soviet  leaders,  Chairman  of  the  Council  of  the  Union  of  the  Supreme

					war?    	I  will  try  to  present  a  survey  in  the  fnlYowing  paragrephe.
					The  Soviet-Japaneae  ~o~.nC  d~cl~rat~.on  w~~  cottcluded  und~r  th~  Hatoygma
					CabineC  in  OcCober  1956  and  became  effective  in  December.    	Concering  Che
					t~rriCori~l  ig~u~,   	~t  provided  rhat  "the  Soviet  Union  will  transfer  Hgbomai
					gnd  Shikoran  eo  Japan.    	However,   	these  islanda  wi11  actually  be  transferred
					following  conclueion  o�  a  SovieC-Japar,eae  peace  Creaty."
					Originally  Che  peace  rreaCy  wae  eupposed  to  have  been  concluded  at  thia
					time.    	However,   	ehe  Japaneae  said,  "not  only  Habomai  and  Shikotan~    	If
					ynu  don't  al~o  r~turn  Kuniehiri  ~nd  Etorufu..,"  d~manding  ehe  return  of  all
					four  islands  at  once,   	and  no  agreement  was  reached.    	Thus,  as  provided  in
					the  ~oint  declaration  diplomatic  relations  were  re-established  and  the
					state  of  war  was  ended,  while  concluaion  of  the  peace  treaty  including  the
					territorial  isaue  was  left  to  further  negoCiations.
					In  June  of  1957  there  was  a  starement  by  ~  generously  minded  Khruschev
					that,  "if  Comorrow  the  Americans  returned  Okinawa  to  Japan,   	I  would  probably
					take  to  our  government  a  proposal  that  Habomai  and  Shikotan  ehould  be
					tranaferred  Co  Japan  prior  to  conclusion  of  the  peace  treaty,"    	Then  party
					first  secretary,  he  uttered  thia  statement  in  an  interview  with  ASAHI  SHII~UN
					Editorial  Bureau  Chief  Hirooku.
					However,  with  the  conclusion  of  the  new  Japan-United  States  Security  Treaty
					with  the  United  States  Government  by  the  Kishi  Cabinet  in  Januarq  1960,   	the
					Soviet  Government  sent  a  memorandum  to  the  Japanese  Government  giving  as
					"conditions  for  the  transfer  of  Habomai  and  Shikotan,"  besides  the  "conclu-
					aion  of  a  Soviet-Japanese  peace  treaty"  as  agreed  in  the  ~oint  declaration,
					the  newly  added  atatement  that  "all  foreign  troopa  be  withdrawn  from  Japanese
					territory."    	Trying  to  alter  Che  conditione  for  carrying  out  the  agreement
					they  had  undertaken  in  the  ~uint  declaration  with  a  single  notification  was
					altogether  like  the  Soviet  Union's  heavy  handed  methods.
					However,   	in  January  of  1972  during  the  time  of  the  Sato  Cabinet  when
					Foreign  Minister  Gromyko  came  to  Japan  for  the  regularly  scheduled  Soviet-
					Japan  foreign  minister's  conference,   	the  Soviet  Union  agreed  for  the  first
					time  to  the  opening  of  negotiations  for  the  ccnc?uding  of  a  peace  treaty.
					This  was  interpreted  as  a  switch  to  a  softer  policy  toward  Japan  by  th~e
					Soviets  in  Che  face  of  President  Nixon's  viait  to  China  in  February.
					In  July  of  the  same  year  the  Tanaka  Cabinet  was  formed,   	replacing  the  Sato
					Cabinet,  and  in  September  Prime  Minister  Tanaka  and  Foreign  Minister  Ohira
					visited  China,  and  the  Sino-Japanese  joi.nt  atatement  concerning  the  normali-
					zation  of  relations  was  issued.    	However,  in  October  For~ign  Minister  Ohira
					visited  the  Soviet  Union  and  he  and  Foreign  Miniater  Gromyka  carried  out
					the  firat  round  of  negotiatione  for  conclusion  of  a  peace  treaty.

			    	~ollowing  Chis,  un~er  Che  Miki  Cabinet,  which  took  over  in  December  1974  after
			    	the  Tanaka  Cab~.net  resigned,  Foreign  Minister  Miyazawa  Cwice  carried  out

			    	January  1976.    	I�  the  Tanaka-Brezhnev  tglks  are  included,   	there  have  been

			    	in  no  inatance  was  any  concrete  progreas  whatsoever  toward  resolution  of  the
			    	Cerritorial  ieaue  to  be  aeen.
			    	During  this  t3me  the  Japanese  demands  for  the  northern  territories  were  placed
			    	in  an  awkward  situation  in  connection  with  terriCorial  fishing  waters.    	That
			    	is,   	in  December  1976  the  Soviet  Union  estgblished  a  200-mile  limit  for  iCa
			    	territorial  fishing  waters,  and  in  February  1977  released  the  gist  of  the
			    	actual  linea  drawn.    	This  was  based  on  the  premiae  that  the  four  northern
			    	islands  were  Soviet  territory  and   	the  aurrounding  water.s  were  included  in
			     	the  waCera  to  which  thia  applied.
			     	In  our  country,   	the  Fukuda  Cabinet  was  formed  in  February  1976  replacing
			     	the  Miki  CabineC,  and  was  placed  in  the  predicament  of  dealing  with  this
			    	difficult  problem  immediately  after  it  was  launched.
			    	Ultimately,  at  the  end  of  negotiations  for  the  Soviet-Japanese  proviaional
			     	fishing  agreement,  which  lasted  3  full  months,   	from  February  to  May  1977,   	an
			     	understanding  was  reached  by  inaerting  into  the  agreement  a"shining"  reserve
			     	clause  stating  that,   	"no  provision  whatsoever  of  this  agreement  may  be  viewed
			     	as  impairing  the  standpoint  or  opinion  of  either  government  with  respect  to
			     	the  several  problems  concerning  their  mutual  relations."    	The  Japaneae  had
			     	narrowly  escaped  a  defeat.
			     	Following  this,   	in  January  of  last  year  Fornign  Minister  Sonoda  visited
			     	the  Soviet  Union  and  talked  with  Foreign  Miaiater  Gromyko.    	Mr  Gromyko
			     	stated  that,  "the  Soviet  Union  also  wiahea  to  conclude  a  peace  treaty,  but
			     	it  cannot  recognize  the  Japaneae  territorial  demand  for  the  return  of  all

			    	with  reapect  to  territory,   	the  government  has  noC  changed  its  attitude  of

			    	Looking  back  on  the  history  of  negotiations  for  return  of  Che  northern
			    	territories  to  the  present  time  I  cannot  refrain  from  having  strong  doubCs
			    	concerning  the  ultimate  propriety  of  the  negotiating  stance  of  the  "demand
			    	for  the  return  of  all  four  islands  at  once"  adopted  by  the  Japanese.
			    	Mr  Munenori  Akagi  expressed  the  eame  thoughts  in  Chis  magazine  two  issues
			    	prior  to  this  one   	(Munenori  Akagi,   	"A  Way  of  Associating  With  the  Soviets").
			    	As  I  will  explain  later,   	the  reasons  for  my  doubts  are  not  necessarily  the
			    	same,   	but  in  any  case  there  seems  to  be  a  considerable  tendency  in  Japan
			    	to  look  askance  at  the  present  government  negotiating  line.
			    	The  government  has  come  to  assert  that  "the   	'Kurile  Islands'   	renounced  by
			    	Japan  in  the  San  Francisco  Peace  Treaty  do  not  include  Kunashiri  and  Etorofu"
			    	as  Che  basis  �or  its  demand  for  the  return  of  all  four  islands  at  once.
			    	While  it  is  clear  that  Habomai  and  Shikotan,  which  are  a  part  of  Hokkaido,
			    	are  not  included  in  the  "Kurile  Islands"  renounced  in  the  treaty,  the
			    	government  has  said  that  "the  situation  is  the  same  wiCh  Kunashiri  and  Etorofu,"
			    	and  based  upon  this  interpretation  has  demanded  the  return  of  all  four
			    	islands  at  once.
			    	However,   	in  reality,   	Che  administration  of  Yoshida's  Liberal  Party  at  that
			    	time  accepted  the  treaty  on  the  basis  of  the  interpretation  that  "Kunashiri
			    	and  Etorofu,  which  ar~~  the  Southern  Kuriles,  are  included  in  the   	'Kurile
			    	Islands'  which  have  been  renounced,"  and  the  Diet  at  that  time  accepted
			    	ratification  of  the  treaty  with  this  knowledge.    	Therefore  it  must  be  said
			    	that  the  government  interpretation  that  "Kunashiri  and  Etorofu  have  not  been
			    	renounced"  is  contrary  to  the  facts.

			     	The  San  Francisco  Peace  Treaty  was  concluded  in  SepCember  1951  at  the  San
			     	Fr~ncigco  Peace  Conference  and  became  ef�ece~.ve  28  April  1952  glong  with
			     	Che  U.5.-Japan  Se~:uriCy  Treaty.    	However,  aC  Clie  Peace  Cnnfer~nce  the  Japanese
			     	plenipoeentiary  Prim~  Minister  Yoshida  spoke  as  follows  concerning  the  northern
			     	territories  isaue  in  his  speech  accepting  the  treaty.    	"We  cannot  yield   	Co
			     	Che  esaertion  of  the  5oviet  Union's  plenipotentiary  thae  Japan  seized  the
			     	Cerritory  of  the  Kurile  Island  Chain  and  Southern  Sakhalin  by  aggression.
			     	AC  the  Cime  of  the  opening  of  Japan  the  Imperial  Russian  Governmenr  entered
			     	no  ob~e~riort  whatsoever  to  the  fact  ehat  the  tw~  islands  of  the  Souehern
			     	Kuriles,   	Etotofu  and  Ku~nashiri,  were  Japanese  territory.    	However,  aC  the
			     	time  tne  islands  of  the  Northern  Kuriles  north  of  Urup  were  territory  inhabited
			     	by  both  Russians  and  Japanese...Moreover,  Habomai  and  Shikotan,   	part  of
			     	Hokkaido,  which  belongs  to  Japan  proper,   	have  been  occupied  by  the  forces
			     	of  the  Soviet  Union  becauae  at   	the  time  of  the  end  of  Che  war  there  happened
			     	to  be  Japanese  military  barracka  on  these  islands."
			     	This  speech  by  Yoshida  clearly  sCates  ehe  facC  thae  Habomai  and  Shikotan
			     	were  not  included  in  the  "kurile  Islands"  which  had  been  determined  as
			     	renounced  according  to  the  peace  treaty.    	However,   	this  was  noe  stated  wiCh
			     	respect  Co  Kunashiri  and  ECorofu.    	With  the  renunciation  of  the  "Kurile
			     	Islands,"  Kunashiri  and  Etorofu,  which  are  the  "Southern  Kuriles,"  would
			     	also  be  renounced.    	ThaC  we  had  been  placed  in  such  a  desperate  situation				-
     	~				that  we  had  to  renounce  even  these  Cwo  islands,  which  were  an  integral  part
			     	of  our  nation's  terriCory,  was  the  greatest  of  misfortunes,  but  that  is  Che
			     	interpretation  of  the  purporC  of  the  Yoshida  speech  of  that  time.
			     	Why  did  the  Japanese  adopt  the  interpretation  that  "Kunashiri  and  Etorofu
			     	are  renounced"?    	~t  was  because  the  faCher  of  Chis  treaty,  John  Foster
			     	Dulles,   	then  SCate  Department  advisor  to  the  Truman  administration  (later
			     	secretary  of  state  under  Eisenhower),  adopted  this  interpretation.    	Even
			     	at  that   	time  when  the  U.S.-Soviet  cold  war  was  erupting  in  bursts  of  flame,
			     	it  would  not  do  for  the  Americans  to  reduce  the  secret  Yalta  agreements  which
			     	had  "given  the  ~ntire  Kurile  Island  chain  to  the  Soviet  Union  as  one  of  its
			     	compensations  for  the  sought-for  Soviet  participation  in  the  war  against
			     	Japan"  to  a  mere  scrap  of  paper.
			     	As  a  matter  of  fact,   	in  his  introductory  remarks  to  the  debate  on  the
			     	substance  of  the  treaty  at  the  peace  conference,  Dulles,  who  was  explaining
			     	the  treaty  proposals  as  representative  of  the  United  States,  said  in  his
			     	address,   	"There  is  some  question  whether  the  Habomai  Islands  are  included
			     	in  the  geographical  term  Kurile  Island  Chain  in  the  second  clause  (which
			     	conCains  the  provisi.on  concerning  renunciation  of  the  Kurile  Island  Chain).
			     	It  is  the  view  of  the  American  Government  that  Habomai  is  not  included."
			     	This  can  be  interpreted  as  practically  meaning  that  "Habomai  (and  Shikotan)
			     	are  not  included  in  the  Kuriles  renounced  under  the  Treaty,  but  Kunashiri
			     	and  Etorofu  are  included."
			     	The  Soviet  plenipotentiary  who  attended  and  spoke  at  this  conference  was

			     	Tlius  the  Diet  of  that  day  agreed  to  raCification  of  the  treaty  with  approval
					of  an  overwhelming  ma~ority   	(the  Left  Socialist  Party,   	the  Labor-Farmer  Party,
					and  the  Communist  Party  were  opposed)  with  knowledge  of  the  interpretation

					the   	'Northern  Kuriles'   	in  the  'Kurile  Island  Chain'  which  had  been  determined
					as  renounced  according  to  the  treaty.
					Successful  American  Aim
					The  changeover  of  the  Japanese,  who  had  at  one  point  given  up  Kunashiri
					and  ECorofu,   	to  demanding  their  return  along  with  Habomai  and  Shikotan  came
					after  the  opening  of  negotiations  between  Japan  and  the  Soviet  Union  for
					resumption  of  diplomatic  relations  by  the  Hatomama  Cabinet  in  June  1955.
					The  events  surrounding  this  are  related  in  detail  in  Shuichi  Matsumoto's
					book,  "Rainbow  Over  Moscow"   	(Asahi  Shimbunsha  1966).    	Matsumoto  had  been
					vice  foreign  minister  during  the  war,  and  even  though  only  just  elected  to
					the  House  of  Representatives  for.  the  first  time,  became  plenipotentiary
					from  the  first  in  the  Soviet-Japanese  negotiations,   	serving  in  the  front
		_			 	lines  at  the  negotiations  from  the  beginning  to  his  signing  of  the  ~oint
					declaration  resuming  diplomatic  relations  along  with  Prime  Minister  Hatoyama
					in  Moscow  the  following  year  in  October  1956.
					According  to  this  book,  Japan  at  first  went  into  the  negotiations  with  the
				 	following  intent.     	While  we  would  continue  to  insist  that  Habomai,   	Shikotan,
				 	the  Kurile  Island  Chain,  and  Southern  Sakhalin  were  historically  Japanese

				  	rhe   	four  islandg,   	including  Kunashiri  and  ECorofu,   	are  returned  at  once,
				  	was  strong.    	The  American  Government  gave  powerful  support  to  Chis  hard
	  	-				line  insiatence  from  the  sidelines.    	Thus  the  HaCoyama  Cabinet  gave  up

				  	~oint  declaration,  and  the  peace  treaty  negotiations,   	includ~ng  the  territorial
				  	issue,  were  made  matters  for  continuing  negotiations.

				  	in  the  Diet  of  the  new  interpretation  that  Kunashiri  and  Etorofu  are  not
				  	included  in  the  renounced  "Kurile  Island"  by  Foreign  Ministry  officials,
				  	was  in  the  House  of  RepresenCatives  CommitCee  for  Foreign  Affairs  on
				  	11  February  1956.    	This  was  immediately  after  the  Soviet  Union  had  presented
				  	its  proposal  to  "transfer  3ust  Habomai  and  Shikotan"  in  the  form  of  a  text
				  	given  to  the  Japanese.
				  	Foreign  Ministry  ofFicials  aC   	Che  time  supposed  that  this  alteration  of
				  	interpretation  had  naturally  been  carried  out  with  the  support  of  the
				  	American  Government,   	but  afterwards  in  the  final  stages  of  the  negotiations
				  	in  response  to  a  request  by  the  Japanese  for  the  opinion  of  the  American
	  	-		     	Government  concerning  the  Kunashiri-Etorofu  issue,   	the  Americans  gave  the
				  	following  reply  in  September  of  that  year.
				  	"The  United  StaCes,  as  a  result  of  careful  study  of  historical  circumstances,
				  	has  arrived  at  Che  conclusion  that  Kunashiri  and  Etorofu,  along  with  the
				  	Habomai  Islands  which  are  part  of  the  Hokkaido,  have  been  an  integral  part
				  	of  Japaneae  territory  and  should  be  recognized  as  coming  under  the  legitimate
				  	sovereignty  of  Japan.    	If  the  Soviet  Union  agrees  to  this  iC  will  be  a  positive
				  	contribuCion  to  the  relaxation  of  tensions  in  the  Far  East."
				  	In  short,   	it  adopted  the  new  interpretation  that  "Kunashiri  and  Etorofu
				  	should  be  returned  to  Japan"  and  gave  a  stamp  of  approval  "supporting"  the
	  	-		     	Japanese  demand  for  the  return  of  all  four  islands  aC  once.    	At  the  time,
				  	Dulles,   	the  father  of  the  peace  treaty  with  Japan,  was  secretary  of  state
				  	in  the  Eisenhower  administration.    	If  he  had  thought  that  "Kunashiri  and
				  	Etorofu  should  be  returned  to  Japan"  he  should  have  made  iC  clear  in  the
				  	peace  treaty  or  at  the  peace  conference.   	Instead,  while  taking  the  position
				  	at  that  time  that  "Kunashiri  and  Etorofu  are  included  in  the  'Kurile  Islands'

			     	recognition  of  the  fact  ehat  "~his  country  hae  renour,.ced  Kunashiri  and
			     	Etorofu."    	Thia  belief  is  based  on  the  following  two  reasons.
    	-			 	The   	fireC  reason  is  that  it  i~  to  be  imagined  that  the  demand  for  the  rerurn
			     	nf  the  islands  at  once  based  upon  an  inCerpretation  which  i~  contrary  to
			     	Che  facCs  3.s  unlikely  to  have  any  more  power  tio  persuade  the  other  party  in
			     	the  fueure  than  it  has  had  in  Che  past.    	Then  gs  long  ns  the  Japanese
			     	stubbornly  cling  tio  ehis  demand  formula,   	to  hope  for  ehe  reeurn  of  the
			     	islands  must  be  imagined  to  be  like  waiting  for  the  rivers  eo  run  upstream,
			     	noC  only  in  the  case  of  Kunashiri  and  Etorofu,  buC  also  for  Habomai  and
     	'				ShikoCan.
			     	The  second  reason  is  that  the  present  political  posture  o�  the  government
			     	in  putCing  out  propaganda  for  domestic  consumption  cl~iming  as  "an  inter-
			     	preCntion  faithful  to  the  facts"  an  interpretaCion  which  is  contrary  to
			     	the  facCs  must  be  supposed  Co  involve  great  problems  from  the  standpoinC
			     	of  democratic  politics.
			     	There  is  a  pamphlet  titled  "Our  Northern  Territory"  put  out  as  material  for
				,     	the  government's  domestic  public  relations  campaign  concerning  the  northern
			     	territory  by  the  CulCural  Information  Buresu  of  the  Foreign  MinisCry.    	It
			     	makes  free  use  of  every  soxC  of  maCerial  to  stress  the  legitimacy  of  Che
			     	demand  for  return  of  the  four  islands  at  once,  but   	the  reply  of  Treaty
			     	Bureau  Chief  Nishimura  in  the  Peace  and  Security  Special  DieC  Session  and
			     	the  Dulles  speech  at  the  San  Franciaco  Peace  Conference   	(both  previously
			     	mentioned)   	are  not  presented,    	The  formal  interpretation  of  a  treaty  ought
			     	to  be  that  of  the  time  of  the  conclusion  of  the  treaty,  but  this  argument  is
			     	formed  out  of  materials  lacking  t~e  most  essential  parts.    	This  seems  to  be
			     	not  telling  the  truth  to  the  people.
			     	Of  the  various  political  parties,   	the  Socialist  and  the  Communist  Parties
			     	have  from  the  first  pointed  out  that  "the  government  interpretation  of  the
			     	Kunashiri  and  Etorofii  issue  is  contrary  to  the  facts."    	But  the  ma~ority
			     	of  the  people  probably  think  that  the  government  explanation,   	rather  than
			     	the  Socialist-Communist  assertions,  is  correct.    	If  this  is  true,   	they  have
			     	been  misled  by  the  government.
			     	This  is  a  lamentable  political  condition  for  a  democratic  nation.    	The
			     	polieical  stance  of  the  government  of  a  democratic  nation  must  be  to  rely
			     	on  the  formation  of  public  opinion  based  upon  accurate  information  and
			     	telling  the  truth  to  the  people,  who  are  the  sovereign  rulers.    	Of  course,
			     	telling  the  people  of  the  true  circumstances  surrounding  events  at  the  time
			    	of  the  conclusion  of  the  San  Francisco  Treaty  has  no  connection  whatsoever
			     	to  the  leaking  of  national  secrets.    	For  the  policy  officials  of  the  various
			     	related  countries,   	including  our  negotiating  partner,   	the  Soviet  Union,
			     	these  are  self-evident  historical  facts.

				  	Etorofu,"  what  new  negotiating  line  sb,ould  be  adopted  instead?    	I  don't
				  	believe  it  would  be  a  wise  solution  "to  give  up  on  Kunashiri  and  ECorofu
				  	and,  drowning  in  our  tears,   	conclude  a  treaty  on  Che  basis  of  Habomai  and
				   	Shikotan."    	With  this,   	23  years  of  Japanese  efforC  si.nce  the  time  of  the
				   	Soviet-Japanese  3oint  declaration  would  come  to  nothing.    	Even  if  renounced,
				   	since  Kunashiri  and  Etorofu  were  wiChout  doubt  originally  purely  and  simply
				   	an  integral  part  of  our  national  terriCory,   	to  close  the~  curtain  in  such  a
				   	fashion  "in  tearful  full  retreat"  by  the  Japanese  would  leave  a  stiffness
				   	difficult  to  relax  in  the  future  course  of  Soviet-Japanese  relations.
				   	If  this  is  the  case,   	might  not  the  two  stage  demancl  argument  for  "first
				   	Habomai  and  Shikotan,   	and  followinR  this  not  only  Kunashiri  and  Etorofu,

				   	Parties  be  a  line  which  could  be  adopted  by  a  conservative  party  government?
				   	Even  though  they  are   	the  same  two  stage  demand   	theory,   	the  plans  advocated
				   	by  the  Socialist  and   	the  Communist  Parties  are  not  the  same.    	The  Socialist
				   	Party  plan  is  to  "first  conclude  a  peace  treaty  on  the  basis  of  the  reCurn
				   	of  Habomai  and  Shikotan,   	leaving  the  remaining  Kurile  Islands  for  continuing
				   	negotiations.    	Then,   	with  the  dissolving  of  the  U.S.-Japan  Sec~irity  Treaty
				   	in  the  future,  bring  about  the  return  of  all  of  the  Kuriles."    	The  Communist
				   	Party  plan  is  "first,   	to  ask  for  the  return  of  Habomai  and  Shikotan  right
				   	away,   	even  before  the  conclusion  of  a  peace  treaty.    	Then,  based  upon

				   	dissolving  the  U.S.-Japan  Security  Treaty,  bring  about  the  return  of  all
				   	the  Kuriles."
				   	The  Soviet  and  Japanese  Communist  Parties  on  14  April  made  public  the   	text

			   	la~~nched  in  an  atmoephere  of  "peaceful  revoluCion"  based  upon  the  ~upport  of
			   	the  ma~ority  of  the  people,   	that  in  iCself  might   	hav~   	persuasive  power
			   	intez~nationally.
			   	However,   	this  cannot  be  sought  by  a  conservative  party  government.    	If  a
			   	government  which  heretofore  had  not  dema:~ded  Che  return  of  the  Northern
			   	Kuriles  suddenly  sought  them,   	even  in  a  two-eCage  formula,   	it  would  be  taken
    	-		     	as  "madness"  in  the  international  communiCy,  and  would  only  uselessly  invite

			   	As  a  breakChrough  policy  for  the  northern  territory  issue  to  replace  the
			   	demand  for  Che  return  of  all  four  islands  at  once,   	I  believe  that  the  so-
			   	called  "Hirasawa  Proposal"  might  be  one  which  the  government  should  seriously
			   	consider  adopting.    	This  proposal  was  advocated  by  the  late  foreign  affairs
			   	expert  Kazushige  Hirasawa  in  an  article  titled,  "Japan's  New  Foreign  Policy,"
			   	which  he  contributed  to  the  October  1975  issue  of  the  authoritative  inter-
			   	national  affairs  quarterly,    	FOREIGN  AFFAIRS"publiahed  in  the  United  States.
			   	The  portion  related  to  Che  northern  territoriee  and  relations  with  the  Soviet
			   	Union  is  as  follows.
			   	"I  believe  that  Japan  should  freeze  the  issue  of  Kunashiri  and  Etorofu  until
			   	the  end  of  this  century  and  conclude  a  treaty  of  peace  and  friendship  with
			   	the  Soviet  Union.    	This  proposal  is  conditional  upon  the  opening  of  Che
			   	fishing  grounds  surrounding  both  islands  to  Japanese  fishermen.    	In  the
			   	next  25  years  if  the  atmosphere  steadily  improves  and  a  relationship  of
			   	mutual  trust  is  built  up,  in  the  first  part  of  the  21st  century  Japan  and
			   	the  Soviet  Union  can  probably  sit  down  together  at  discussions  for  the  purpose
			   	of  friendly  and  constructive  handling  of  the  territorial  issue.    	If  this
			   	does  not  happen,   	the  prospects  for  cooperation  in  relation  to  the  even  more

			    	proper  line.
			    	Deng  Xiaoping  SaCement  Merits  Att~ntion
																							    	.
			    	As  previously  mentioned,   	the  Japaneee  Government  has  taken  the  sCance  that
			    	"There  may  be  simultaneous  diacussion  of  boCh  the  Japanese  peace  treaty  draft
     	�		     	and  the  Soviet  neighborly  cooperaCion  treaty  draft  and  consolidation  of  both
			    	treaties."    	As  an  acCual  negotiating  formula  the  Japanese  probably  ought
			    	to  aim  first   	for  this  type  of  discuesion.    	Then  they  ehould  plan  for  con-
			    	version  from  the  four  island  at  once  formula  to  the  Hirasawa  formula  during
			    	these  discuasions.
			    	The  contents  of  the  draft  treaty  of  neighborly  cooperation  presented  by  the
			    	Soviets  has  many  points  in  common  with  the  treaty  concluded  last  year  in
			    	November  with  Ethiopia  and  with  the  treaties  the  Soviets  have  already
			    	concluded  with  India  and  Iraq.    	That  is,   	it  is  based  upon  a  pattern  of
			    	treaties  with  non-aligned  nations.    	This  is  something  which  our  country
			    	cannot  swallow  in  its  preaent  form.    	However,  the  Soviets  have  concluded
			    	arrangements  of  friendly  cooperation  with  BriCain,  �'rance,  Canada,  Denmark,
			    	and  other  Western  nations.    	Thus  it  will  be  best  if  our  country  aims  at
			    	conversion  to  this  Western  pattern.
			    	As  the  fierce  criticism  at  the  time  of  the  publication  of  the  Hirasawa
			    	proposal  will  teatify,   	the  negative  reaction  domeatically  to  the  "argument
     	~		     	for  the  tabling  of  Kunashiri  and  Etorofu"  is  strong.    	However,   	the  thing
			    	which  comes  to  mind  in  this  connection  is  the  statement  concerning  the
			    	Senkaku  Island  issue  made  by  Chinese  Vice  Premier  Deng  Xiaoping  at  a  news
			    	conference  in  Tokyo  on  25  October  last  year.    	Mr  Deng  spoke  as  follows.
			    	"It  does  not  bother  us  if  this  issue  is  shelved  for  the  present.    	It  does
