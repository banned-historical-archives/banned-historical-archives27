WASHINGTON POST 
11 JUN 1976 - 
Charles B. Seib 
CIA. Taint on the ress 
A  
There's no point in beating ?a- dead 
bOrse. But want to take just one more. 
swing at the one that daily becomes 
more aromatic. out behind .CIA head-
quarters. T-.? ? ? ? ? ? 
? talking about the CIA's involve-
Meat _with_ the :,Pre_s_a=thil......CSMAtrY'_ 
and. the worlds. The superspies persist 
In their refusal to provide details of 
this relationship, past or present. And 
the press, for all its investigative zeal, 
just. can't, Seem to get interested in 
doing anything about it. 
Two 'developments prompt me to re-
turn to this unpopular subject. The first' 
is the recent Soviet charge that three, 
leading' American. correspondents in. 
Moscow work for the CIA. The second 
is correspondence between CIA direc-
tor George Bush and several journalis-
tic organkations... ? 
To set the stage, the CIA's stated posi-
tion on its use of the media is that, as of 
last Feb. 11, it has sworn off "paid. or 
contractual relationships with any full-
time *or part-time correspondent ac-
credited by . any US. news service, 
newspaper, periodical, raciiO or televi 
sion network or station." .-- ? 
'The agency insists that its past rela-
tionships with journalists involved no 
Impropriety or any intention to influ-
ence or harm the American press. It 
also says it has no intention of reveal-
ing, now or later, the names of journal-
ists who have worked for it. 
What does. all this mean in concrete 
terms? Just what does CIA mean by 
"accredited," for example? The Senate 
Intelligence Committee recently re-
ported that until early this year the CIA 
had undercover "relationships" with 
about 50 American journalists, and that 
more than half these ties were continu-
ing despite the Feb. 11 statement. The 
Senate report also said that staff inves-
tigators found that two employees of - 
"general circulation U.S. news organi-
zations" were still functioning as paid 
.undercover CIA contacts. . . 
And that brings us to the Russian 
charges. Literaturnaya Gaieta, the pub-
lication of the Union of Soviet Writers, 
asserted late last month that , Christo-
pher t' Wren of The New YOric Fthies 
George.::Krimsky of the 'Associated' ? 
Press and Alfred Friendly. Jr. of News-
week were associated with the CIA. ? 
There Is no reason to believe the 
charges. No hard` evidence was pro-
duced, and there have been strong de 
nials from the men, highly regarded 
journalists,inii.their publications. 
-. But .1e:it not reasonable to believe 
that the CIA's unwillingness, to cue its 
ties to American journalism feeds the 
suspicions that lead to such ?Charges? 
Does not that same unwillingness make 
it more difficult to refute the charges? 
A number of journalists and journal-
istic organizations have called for the 
publication of the names of news peo-
ple who have been in the pay of the 
CIA, and. of news organitationa that 
have knowingly provided CIA cover. . 
That, it isarguedOs the only way the 
American press can be cleansed of the, 
taint of spy work. ALso,,to be pragmatic,: 
Such 'publication would be quite,effec-
tive in discouraging future CIA-press: 
relationehies. But, as it noted in Ira 
11 policy 'statement, the 
In-
tention of doing that. Which brings us 
to the Bush letters. 
On May 3, the National News Council, 
a press-monitoring body, wrote to Bush 
expressing deep concern about reports 
of CIA-press?,ties _end asking_ for more 
information on the ties and the portent 
they hold for a free press in a free so-
ciety. The council noted that it was not 
asking for publication of names of indi-? 
vidnals employed by CIA. - 
In reply, Bush said that he had hoped 
the Feb. 11 statement 'would relieve. 
the minds of those in the field of .jour-
nalism." He said that "it has reassured 
Many with whem I have spoken pri-
vately." , . , 
On May 14, directors of the Fund for. 
Investigative Journalism, which under--, 
writes journalistic projects, wrote- a 
much stronger,, letter than the News' 
Council's. It sai4 the clandestine use of 
American news people by the CIA is 
"destructive of the fundamental weirs-
ises of a free press and corrosive of the 
First Amendment." 
Thefiind's board urged that the CIA 
gobeyond its earlier statement and an-
nounce tentination of the use of all-
BALTIMORE SUN 
11 June 1976 
Journalists, ' including freelancers: 
stringers and part-time reporters- and 
editors, whether or not accredited: 
That brought a reply in which. Bush 
said he had "talked privately to a nuin-
ber of -members of 'the Fourth Estate. 
Although' not all "of 'them are totally' 
haPpy.with the situation as it is, I have 
met -,with considerable quiet. -under-
standing. One top figure in the national 
media told me privately that he 
thought that after issuance of my state-
ment, no more could properly be de-, 
manded of us." ? 
Bush went on to say that "in a per-
fect world,'we might be able to run the 
intelligence business in response to the 
criticisms of each and every point of. 
view, but I'm afraid that perfect world, 
Is not yet here." 
.Bush is right aboid the imperfection 
of the world. But questions Inuit be 
raised about his claims. ,of support for 
his position within the news business,. 
;Who are those members of the Fourth 
Estate who have privately given Bush, 
the "quiet understanding," whatever 
that is? Who is the top figure in the na-
tional'media who said he was satisfied_ 
with the CIA position? 
What we are faced with now is not 
only the knowledge that the CIA has 
been and continues to be the employer 
of an undisclosed number of unnamed 
American journalists, but that its stone-
walling has the support, or at least the 
acquiescence, of a number of media 
people?at the top level, we must as-
sume. But they, too, are unnamed. 
Could there be a Catch-22 here by 
which some of those who, have shown 
"quiet understanding" also have or 
have had an involvement, direct- or in-
direct, with the agency? ? 
- We don't know. What we do know is 
that the taint of CIA involvement con-
tinues to pollute the American press as 
a whole. We also know that because of 
the taint, charges such as those leveled 
by the Soviet magazine are bound to 
find a more accepting audience. 
Senate panel wants delay 
in CIA's destro yin 
Washington (AP)?The new 
Senate intelligence committee 
has unanimously recommended 
a six-month moratorium on 
Central Intelligence Agency 
plans to destroy files of impro-
per and illegal activitieS. 
The decision was reached by 
the panel in a closed-door ses-
sion Wednesday and publicly 
disclosed yesterday by its 
chairman, Senator Daniel K. In-
ouye (D., Hawaii) in a letter to 
Senate leaders. 
"It is the further recommen-
dation of the committee that 
- 
the CIA and other intelligence 
agencies should submit an in-
ventory of the records to be de-
stroyed" to the panel, Mr. In-
ouye said in a letter to the Sen-
ate majority leader, 'Mike 
Mansfield (D., Mont.), 'and mi-
nority leader, Hugh Scott (FL, 
Pa.). 
Senator Mansfield and Sena-
tor Scott earlier in the week 
had left it to the new panel to 
decide whether the CIA should 
be allowed to -destroy its files 
on its past misdeeds. 
g of files 
The controversy was 
prompted when the CIA direc-
tor, George Bush, wrote to Mr. 
Mansfield and Mr. Scott to tell 
them he planned to destroy the 
files now that congressional in-
vestigations into allegations of 
improper conduct had been 
completed. 
These same Senate leaders 
had been the ones who had 
asked the CIA to save the files 
Iwhile Congress was investigat-
ing the alleged misdeeds.

NEW YORK TIMES 
7 JUN 1976 
tilwelet to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, June 6?Following IS 
the text of the conclusions of the final: 
report of the Senate Intelligence Com- , 
mittze on the activities of the Central" 
Intelligence Agency. In, the text, D.C.I. 
Is the Director of Central Intelligence, 
D.D.I. is the Directorate for Intelligence, 
D.D.O. is the Directorate/or Operations, 
.and N.S.C. is the, National- Security., 
Council. ' 
- The C.LA,-, was conceived and estab-
lished to provide high-quality- intelli-
genceto senior policymakers. Since 1947, 
,the agency?its structure, its Wade with-
in the Government and its function?has 
undergone- dramatic -"change and expan- ? 
sion: Sharing .characteristics common to 
most large, complex' organizations, the 
C.I.A. has-responded to rather than arie-
ticipated the forces of change; it has 
accumulated functions rather than rede-
fining them; its internal patterns were , 
established early and have solidified; 
success has come to those who have 
made visible contributions in high-pri-
ority areas. These general character-
istics have affected the specifics of the 
agencys development. - 
The notion that the C.I.A. could serve 
as a coordinating body for departmental-
intelligence activities and that the D.C.I. 
could orchestrate the process did not 
take into account tlth inherent institu-
tional obstacles posed by the depart-
ments. From the outset no department . 
was willing to condede a centralized 
intelligence function to the C.I.A. Each 
insisted on the maintenance of its inde-
pendent capabilities to support its policy 
role: With budgetary and manaaement 
authority vested in the departments,?the 
agency was left powerless in the execu- . 
tion of interdepartmental coordination. 
Even in the area of coordinated national 
intelligence estimates the departments 
did not readily provide the agency with 
the data required. 
It was not until John McCone's term-
as D.C.I. that the agency aggressively, 
sought to assert its position as a coor-
dinating body. That effort demonstrated 
the complex-factors that determined the-
relative success of corrununity ,manage-
ment. One of the principal influences. 
was the support accorded the D.C.I. by 
the President and the cooperation of the 
Secretary of Defense. In a situation 
where the D.C.I. commanded no re-
source or outright authority, the posi-
tion of these two individuals was crucial. 
While Kennedy and McNamara provided 
McCone with consistent backing in a 
variety of areas, Nixon and Laird failed 
to provide Helms with enough support. 
to give him the necessary bureaucratic:. 
leverage. 
It is clear that the D.C.I.'s own prior-
ities, 'derived from their backgrounds 
and interests, influenced the relative 
success of the agency's role in interde-
partmental coordination. Given the limi-
tations on the D.C.I's authority, only by 
making community activities a first or-
der concern and by pursuing the prob-
lems assertively could a D.C.I. begin to 
make a difference in effecting better 
management. During Allen Dulles' term 
interagency coordination went neglected, 
and the results were expansion of corn. 
peting capabilities among the depart-
ments. For McCone, community intelli-
gence activities were clearly a priority, 
and his 'definition of the D.C.I.'s role 
contributed to whatever advances were 
made:Helms' fundamental: i?tetesinclinations lay: within the' agency; -.and

tion and the lack or ;real authority for;

funetion. As presently defined,. the 
D.C.t.'S job is burdensome in: the. ex; 
treme. He is to serve the rotes of Chief' 
intelligence adviser to the President', 
Manager of community. Intelligence ac-
tivities; and senior executive in the C.I.A.!, 
History has demonstrated. that the Job-
of theD.C.I: as community manager and-
as head of the C.I.A. are competing, not; 
complementary roles. In- tenni Of bothi 
the demands imposed by each function:1! 
anclthe expertise requited to fulfill the; 
responsibilities, the two roles differ:con.7?:: 
siderably, In the future separating the 
functions with precise definitions ? of au-, 
thority and responsibilities niay Prove 
plausible alternative. 
Although the agency was established 
primarily for the purpose of providing' 
intelligence analysis to- senior policy-
makers, within three years clandestine 
operations became and continued to be 
the, agency's pre-eminent activity:, The 
single most important factor in the 
transformation was policymakers' per-
ception Of the Soviet Union as a world-
wide threat to United' States security.' 
The agency's large-scale clandestine ac-
tivities have mirrored American foreign, 
policy priorities. With political. "opera-
? tions in Europe in the 1950's,'-paramill.-
tary -operations: in Korea,Third. World 
activities,Cuba, Southeast' Asia, and 
currently narcotics control,-: the C.I.A.'s 
major programs paralleled:: the' inter-. 
national concerns of the United States. 
For nearly two decades 'American pol-
icymakers considered- covert action vital 
in the struggle against international 
Communism. The generality of the defi-
nition or "threat perception" motivated 
the continual development and justifica-
tion of covert activities from the senior" 
policymaking level to the field stations. 
Apart from the overall anti-Communist 
motivation, successsive Presidential ad-
ministrations regarded covert actions as 
a quick and convbnient means of ad-
vancing their particular objectives. 
_ _ 
- Internal incentives contributed- to the 
expansion in covert action. Within the 
agency D.D.O. careerists have tradition-
ally been rewarded more quickly for the 
visible accomplishments of covert-tion than fpr the long term development 
of- agents required for clandestine col-
lection.. Clandestine activities will: re--
main an element of United States -for-. 
eign policy, and policymakers will di-
rectly affect the level of operations. The 
prominence of the Clanciestine Service 
within .the agency may moderate as 
money for and high-level executive in 
terest in covert actions diminish.' How-
ever, D.D.Q. incentives which emPhasize . 
operations over collection and which-' 
create an internal_ demand for projects 
will continue to foster covert action 
unless an internal conversion process 
forces a Change. s 
In the past the orientation of D.C.I.s 
such as Dulles and Helms also contrib-
uted to the agency's emphasis on clart-
destine activities. It is no coincidence 
that of those D.C.I.s who have been 
Agency careerists, all have come from 
the Clandestine Service_ Except. for 
James Schlesinger's brief appointment,.

policy and:. whether the results have

uated ;without wide access to records 
on covert operations, access the corn, 
mittee did not have. 
Organizational- arrangements within 
the agency and the .decision-making 
structure outside the agency have per--
mitted the extremes in C.I.A. activity. 
The ethos of secrecy which pervaded 
the D.D.O. had the effect of setting the 
directorate apart within the agency and 
allowed the Clandestine Service a 
measure of autonomy not accor&o.i 
other directories. More importantly, the 
compartmentation principle allowed 
units of the D.D.O. freedom in deft:e 
operations. In many cases tie.4 burden of 
responsibility fell on individua. 
ments?a situation in which :lapses and 
, deviations are inevitable. Previous ex-
cesses Of drag testing, assassination 
planning ? and domestic activities were. 
, supported by an internal structure that 
permitted individuals to conduct opera-
tions .without,the consistent necessity' 
or expectation of justifying or revealing 
their activities.. -. 
, . ? 
'Blurred-Accountability' - 
7.1/tim'ately, much of the responsibility 
for the scale of covert action and for 
whatever abuses occurred must fall to-
senior policymakers. The decision-mak-
ing arrangements at the .N.S.C. level 
created an environment of blurred ac-
countability which allowed considera-
tion of actions without the constraints-
of individual responsibility. Historically 
the ambiguity and imprecision derived 
from the initial expectation that covert 
operations would be limited and there-
fore could be managed by a small, in-
formal group. Such was the intention 
in 1948. By 1951 with the impetus of 
the Korean war, covert action had be-
come a fixed element in the U.S. foreign 
policy ,repertoire. The frequency of 
covert action forced the development of 
more formalized decision-matting ar-
rangements. Yet structural changes did 
not alter ambiguous procedures. In the 
late 1950's" the relationship -between 
Secretary of State John Foster Dulles' 
and Allen Dulles allowed informal 
agreements and personal understandings 
to prevail over explicit and precise de-
cisions. In addition, as the scale of 
covert action expanded, policymakers-
found it useful to maintain the am-
biguity of the ,decision-making process 
to insure secrecy and to allow "IpIaus-
ible deniability' of covert operations. 
No one in the executive?least of all: 
the President-7-was required to formally 
sign off on a decision to implement a. 
covert action program. The D.C.I. was 
'responsible for the execution of a proj-
ect but not for taking the decision to 
implement It., Within the N.S.C. a group 
of individuals---held joint responsibility-
for defining policy objectives, but they-
did not attempt to establish 'criteria

WASHINGTON, 
authoritative hitor:, 
Central Intelligence Agency re-4 
leased today holds that the 
agency has failed over the last 
three decades to fulfill several 
of its essential missions. - 
The study;sprePared with the'

With.. Respect to Intelligence 
Activitiee; fiirther concludes ' 
that the aeency, over the years; 
became a bureaucracy that ran 
amok because of conflicting: 
interests. ' 
?? It says that, the agency, :de-
spite its successes, especially in. 
scientific and technical" fields:. 
was "distorted" -very early by 
rboth its' directors and their . 
[superiors, and ?Moved ? away. 
[from its prime task of prowl& 
s ing high quality, intelligence 
analysis forrn the American 
litical leadership. 
' 
Others Share 'Blame ; 
For example, the history' 
notes 'that the agency' had: novi 
estimate of Communist intertt'.. 
tions- in Korea before the North,.! 
Korean attack om South Kaik. 
in 1950.` It also notes that eco-
nomic -'intelligence- -and inter-
national naiveties traffic Intel-
ligence were given Priority only. 
in the last decade-and that at-
tention _ to underdeveloped 
countries did not begin until 
the 1960's. - ? . 
Th d history, Which has heed 
thoroughly read and declassi-
fied line for line by agency 
officials, also says the agency 
failed to become a truly "Cen-
tral", intelligence 'service :Co-' 
ordinating all espionage re-
sources of the United States. 
The study blames a succes-
sion Of. Presidents, Congress, 
the armed services and the 
agency itself for the shortcom-

four factors internatibnal

NS DAY LONDON TIMES 
27 May 1976 -18 May- 3.97 
CIA: No Newsmen Need Apply 
Your editorial "A Case of Subversion From With-
in" ? May 5) has come to my attention. In it you said 
my statement of last February II "seemed to promise 
that journalists would no longer be hired." 
My statement said: "Effective immediately,: CIA 
will not enter -into any paid or contractual relation-
ship with any full-time or part-time news correspon-
dent accredited by any U.S. new service, newspaper, 
periodical, radio or television network or station. As 
soon as feasible, the agency will bring existing rela-
tionships with individuals in these groups into con-
formity with this new policy." - This policy is being carried out. _ 
You may base the views in your editorial on state-
ments in. the Senate Select Committee report. .The 
committee was working frcrn brie f- and necessarily 
highly sanitized case summaries. We do not necessari-
? ly agree with their conclusions. 
Although the body of your editorial says nothing 
? about subversion, the caption over it does. I can as-
sure you it has never been the intent, nor is it the in-
tent now, nor will it be the intent in the future, for the 
CIA to attempt to "subvert" the American press. 
George Bush, Director 
Central Intelligence Agency - 
?Vashington, D.C. E. 
_ 
Penkovsky Papers--
;From Dr Robert Conquest 
-
Sir, Owing to travel, I have only to-
day seen The Times Diary in your 
issue of April 29, which alleges that 
the Penkovsky Papers have now 
been proved a fabrication, and 
attacks me for. maintaining, .the. 
opposite. ? 
I It is true that students of- Soviet 
;affairs have on -occasion endorsed. 
or partially endorsed, fakes (as with 
Deutscher and Cam in the cases of 
"Budu Mdivani " and the "Litvinov 
Diaries." respectively): and had your 
Diarist's' assertion been true, I would 
naturally have admitted my error. 
But it is not. 
? All that even the-egregious Senate 
Committee's report on Intelligence 
Activities and the Rights of Ameri-
cans, which your. Diarist quotes, in 
fact says. is that the book was. pre-
pared and written by CIA "agency 
assets", but on. the basis of the-
"actual case materials". But this 
is no more than a hostile way- of 
saying that the materials came 
through the CIA (who were, rather 
naturally, Colon el P en ko vs ky's 
American contacts), and that there-
after they were translated and 
edited by someone in the CIA's con-
fidence... There is nothing new here, 
let alone any proof of "palpable 
forgery". And that such editing 
took place has never-been disputed: 
it is indeed stated in the book itself. 
This is obviously not an entirely 
satisfactory situation, but it leaves 
the question- of authenticity as one 
of . Judgment of the actual. text. 
Criticism of it, as against mere anti. 
CIA abuse, has been based solely, on 
criticis' misunderstandings of. trivia. 
and on amateur telepsychology 
(" Colonel. Penkovsky would not 
have . . ."). Until the CIA releases 
the- original- "case Material", as I 
hope it will, one can only .say that 
the arguments for general authen-
ticity (and the negative arguments 
against "forgery ") remain incom-
parably stronger than- their con-
traries. At the very least, the in-
expert intuitions of Mr Brogan can- - 
not be taken very seriously, any 
more than your Diarist's' attempt to 
squeeze implications- out: of the re-
-port of the Church Committee. That 
Committee has itself been attacked 
in the United States even by liberal 
columnists as largely a politically 
motivated farce. To find Times con-
tributors who go a good deal further 
is a little disturbing. 
Yours faithfully,

This caused an outcry itt 
Washington. Carver, was 
then a senior CIA-
helping shape Vietnam-
; policy; and the . failure to 
, tell readers of Ibis Connec-
tion brought congressional: 
and Press complaints.

apparently was intended to

But- despite the' distlaimer,, 
article appeared-

In February, CIA Director George Bush issued a state-
ment saying: "Effective immediately, the CIA will not enter 
into any paid or contractual relationship with. any full-time 
or part-time news correspondent accredited by any U.S. 
news service, newspaper, periodical, radio or television net-
work or station." E&P (Feb. 21, page 6) applauded the 
statement as did many publications. 
Mr. Bush repeated that statement last week in response 
to a question before the annual meeting of the American 
Society of Newspaper Editors in Washington. 
Now the report of the Senate Select Committee on Intelli-
gence Activities discloses that "of the approximately 50 U.S. 
journalists or personnel of U.S. media organizations who 
were employed by the CIA or maintained some other covert 
relationship with it at the time of the announcement, fewer 
than one-half will be terminated under the new CIA guide-
lines." 
The committee says the key word is "accredited" and the 
agency interprets it as applying to those who are "formally 
authorized by contract or issuance of press credentials to 
represent themselves as correspondents" leaving all others 
(executives and free lancers) as not included. 
This is CIA doubletalk. 
The damage to the integrity of all responsible news people 
continues with this sham. 
Mr. Bush should immediately clarify the CIA position by 
saying "all news people" are included in the prohibition, not 
just some.

But the CIA smear has a beautiful

the journalist's integrity, it also explains

it saves time. And it saves the hacks of

or Beirut, where guerrillas, terrorists, 
zealots, and assorted cranes run around 
armed to the sideburns. . 
A correspondent falsely labelee'. as a 
CIA agent by an irresponsible Soviet 
newspaper will face an extra measure 
of danger in covering the news, espe-
, daily in trouble spots of the Third

mad Marxist, taking a Communist libel 
at face value, will murder him in the

That is why those who compromised 
the press must be named, and why they 
must be purged from its ranks. It may 
happen that in this process some great 
reputations will be ruined. It may bap-
pen that careers will be wrecked, that

Senate Group Finds CIA Now 
Active Only in Books Abroad 
The book publishing program of the 
Central Intelligence Agency, once con-
sidered an important weapon of long-
range propaganda, reached a high wa-
termark in the year 1967 and has subse-
quently been sharply scaled down and 
limited almost entirely to books pub-
lished abroad, according to the recently 
released report of the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence. 
With the exception of one reference 
to Praeger and several other pre-1967 
book publishing ventures, the report 
contains no names of individual au-
thors, titles or publishers. A spokes-
man for the Intelligence Committee 
would not go beyond the contents of 
the report in commenting on relations 
between the CIA and the world of pub-
lishing. Press officer Spencer David 
told PW the Committee had an agree-
ment with the CIA not to disclose 
sources of information or methods or 
the names of individuals and organiza-
tions involved without their consent. 
"The civil rights of individuals and or-
ganizations used by the CIA without 
their knowledge have already been ab-
rogated," he said, "so we don't want 
to turn around and do the same thing." 
"The publicity which in 1967 sur-
rounded several CIA-sponsored organi-
zations and threatened to expose oth-
ers," the report noted, "caused the 
CIA to act quickly to limit use of U.S. 
publishers . . . Thus since 1967 the 
CIA's publishing activities have almost 
entirely been confined to books and oth-
er materials published abroad. During 
the past few years, some 250 books 
have been published abroad, most of 
them in foreign languages." 
The CIA denied to the Committee 
the number of titles and names of au-
thors of the propaganda books pub-
lished since 1967. Brief descriptions 
provided by the Agency indicated the 
breadth of subject matter, however, in-
cluding the following topics enumer-
ated in the Committee report: (1) com-
mercial ventures and commercial law 
in South Vietnam; (2) Indochina repre-
sentation at the U.N.; (3) a memoir of 
the Korean War; (4) the prospects for 
European union; (5) Chile under Al-
lende. 
During the pre-1967 period, the CIA 
had developed a complex pattern of

IMIMM???????0?41, 
By Charles Bartlett 
EXCERPT : 
Congress still wants to hear about 
CIA secret operations but the in-
? telligence agency hasn't learned how 
to live with the ? leaks that result. 
Only a few hours after CIA Director 
George Bush told the House Interna-
tional Relations Committee that the . 
relationships in which it could get 
books published or distributed abroad 
without revealing any U.S. influence 
by covertly subsidizing foreign publica-
tions or booksellers; by initiating or 
subsidizing indigenous national or inter-
national organizations for book publish-
ing or distributing purposes; and by 
stimulating the writing of politically sig-
nificant books by unknown foreign au-
thors?either by directly subsidizing 
the author, if covert contact were fea-
sible, or indirectly, through literary 
agents or publishers. 
Prior to 1967, the CIA had produced. 
subsidized or sponsored well over 1000 
books, the Senate Committee said. Ap-
proximately 25% of these were in Eng-
lish. "Many of them were published by 
cultural organizations which the CIA 
backed, and more often than not the au-
thor was unaware of CIA subsidi-
zation," the Committee report states. 
"Some books, however, involved di-
rect collaboration between the CIA and 
the writer." Some books were pub-
lished without any knowledge on the 
part of the publisher that the writer had 
been subsidized by the CIA. But there 
were cases where publishing houses 
contracted with the CIA to publish 
books, the Committee said. 
In 1967 alone, the CIA published or 
subsidized well over 200 books, rang-
ing from books on wildlife and safaris 
to translations of Machiavelli's "The 
Prince" into Swahili and works of T. S. 
Eliot into Russian, to a parody of the fa-
mous little red book of quotations from 
Mao entitled "Quotations from Chair-
man Liu." 
According to the Committee, the 
CIA has recently been particularly sen-
sitive to the charge that CIA covert 
relationships with the American media 
jeopardize the credibility of the Ameri-
can press and risk the possibility of 
propagandizing the U.S. public. 
Former director William Colby ex-
pressed this concern in testimony be-
fore the House Select Committee on In-
telligence when he said: "We have tak-
en particular caution to ensure that our 
operations are focused abroad and not 
at the United States in order to influ-
ence the opinion of the American 
people about things from a CIA point of 
view." The new director, George 
administration plans no covert steps 
to affect the Italian elections, the 
news was leaked on Capitol Hill. 
Some hope the Senate's creation 
of an oversight committee will per-
suade Congress to repeal the Hughes-
Ryan amendment, which obliges the 
CIA director to report all covert ac-
tivities to at least six committees. 
Over the past 16 Months, virtually 
none of the information conveyed to 
Congress under the amendment has 
been kept secret. 
Bush. has made similar assurances. 
The Senate Committee, headed by 
Senator Frank Church (D.. Idaho) 
went a step further, however, by noting 
that there is domestic fallout even from 
covert propaganda abroad, including 
books intended primarily for an Eng-
lish-speaking foreign audience. "For 
example. CIA records for 1967 state 
that certain books about China subsidi-
zed or even produced by the Agency 
circulated principally in the U.S. as a 
prelude to later distribution abroad." 
Several of these books on China were 
widely reviewed in the United States, 
often in juxtaposition to the sympa-
thetic view of the emerging China as 
presented by Edgar Snow. At least 
once, a book review for an Agency 
book which appeared in the New York 
Times, was written by a CIA writer 
under contract. 
E. Howard Hunt. who had been in 
charge of contacts with U.S. publishers 
in the late 1960s, acknowledged in testi-
mony before this Committee that CIA 
books circulated in the U.S. and sug-
gested that such fallout may not have 
been unintentional. 
''Question: But, with anything that 
was published in English. the United 
States citizenry would become a likely 
audience for publication? 
"Mr. Hunt: A likely audience, defi-
nitely. 
"Question: Did you take some sort 
of steps to make sure that things that 
were published in English were kept 
away from American readers? 
"Mr. Hunt: It was impossible be-
cause Praeger was a commercial U.S. 
publisher. The books had to be seen, 
had to be reviewed, had to be bought 
here, had to be read." 
[Frederick A. Praeger, who in October 
1963 left the firm which he had estab-
lished in 1950, told PW in 1967 that "on-
ly 15 or 16 books" were published 
which had any CIA connection?fewer 
than 1% of the books which the compa-
ny had published since its estab-
lishment?and that most had been pub-
lished in the late I 950s. He declined to 
identify the titles but described them as 
dealing with Communist parties or 
movements abroad. He said that some 
had been suggested by the CIA and 
some by himself and that in this regard 
the publisher's role was "no different 
from our relationships with other gov-
ernment agencies." He insisted that 
"the CIA at no time had any editorial 
control whatsoever."]

A Communist member, of parlia-

that the San Francisco-based Asia

Minister Osamu Inaba acknowledged 
that more than 50 judges and prose-

Writing a book on the CIA's Cuban operations for Dou-
breday. His article on the CL4's-man in Havana, the 
Cuban agent codeLnamed AM LASH, appeared in Out- ; 
look on May 2. In this article, lie-examines the CIA's' 
other major attempt to plot the assassination of Fidel 
Castro, which failed for what may have been 
similar-reasons. 
vir ANY ODD TRIBUTES have been offered to the 
_VI American character, but few can rival that of Sen... 
Walter Mondale upon reviewing the total failure of the 
CIA's persistent efforts to kill Fidel Castro.. "Thank 
God," he said, "we're just not very good at that sort of 
thing." 
Most thoughtful observers seemed to draw the same 
reassuring conclusion. Even the American Mafia dons 
who had been recruited by the Agency to carry out Cas-
tro's-execution were seen as too incompetent to be really 
evil. The portrait drawn by the Senate Intelligence Com-
mittee casts them more in the light of characters out of 
Gang That Couldn't. Shoot Straight," bumbling' 
after; Castro but apparently never getting around to 
making attempt on his life. - 
Such interpretations of these deadly undertakings are 
no doubt comforting, but they are unlikely to be more 
than exercises in wishful thinking. To begin with, Sen. 
Robert _Morgan (D-N.C.) tells us "the theory that pre-
vailed in the [Senate Intelligence] Conunittee was that 
the Mafia never tried to kill Castro, that we-were being 
used." 
? The committee did not pursue this, but an indepentV 
ent examination of the available record of one of the 
key Mafia figures involved in the plot makes us consider 
the troubling possibility that at least some of the CIA's 
Mafia associates were working with Castro. 
Such a combination would hardly have seemed likely 
in 1960 when the CIA set out to recruit the Mafia. Almost 
all the major underworld families had invested heavily 
_ 
in Cuba and Castro was fast moving to seize their hold-
ings. He had even put some of their members in jail. The 
' Mafia's willingness to do the CIA's dirty work would not 
then have required explanation. 
Sam Giancana and John Roselli are the two mobsters 
generally identified with the Mafia-CIA plot. But a third,. 
Santo Trafficante Jr., was perhaps the most important of 
the three, for it was his men, botli in Miami and Havana, 
who were supposed to carry out the murder. _ 
Trafficante is generally identified as the don of south-
ern Florida, but he is also one of the chiefs in the Mafia's 
loose national confederation. Once the Agency decided 
to turn to the mat), it was inevitable that Trafficante's as-
sistance would be sought. Alone among the principal 
dons, he had lived in Cuba. He had built a large organiza-
tion there and still had a number of associates in Cas-
tro's Havana. ? Moreover, his professional experience 
made him ideally suited for assassination work. 
He had learned the business from his father, Santo 
_ 
Trafficante Sr., who came from Sicily in 1904 to Tampa, 
where he built and ran his crime family for the next 50 --- muc 
one 
14 
years. In. 1954i Yeai aftei siii*IVinifillio,41ni attempt 
on his life, Santo Jr; succeeded his father:. ? ' - 
Iii the first few years Of his Tule, Tampa was plagued 
with gangland murders. He was -himself a leading sus-
pect in the 1957 barbershop execution-- of-Albert Anasta-
sia, the old chief of Murder Incorporated, Accompanied 
by a Cuban associate, Trafficante had been in Anasta-, 
sia's New York hotel suite the night before the killing. 
. _ 
.According to reports of the Senate Permanent Investiga-
tions Committee, Anastasia had been. atienipting to, 
move in-on Trafficante's Cuban gambling operations 
The following month, Trafficante was arrested-at thgc 
Mafia national convention at Apalachin,. N.Y. Ten years. 
latet his eminence was again confirmed by his appear-
ance at the La Stella Restaurant in New York with Car-
los Marcello, Carlo Gambino and several other. of the 
country's leading dons. 
He was, in short, one of the major crime bosses in the 
United States and, significantly, the don most deeply af-
fected- by- Castro's revolution: Not only were his gam: 
bling casinos seized but he had been jailed in Cuba. One: 
would assume that such a man might have contemplated: 
taking on Castro independently. At that time, in 1960, 
Castro's grip on Cuba was by no means. secure: Once 
Trafficante accepted his CIA commission, Castro's days 
should have been numbered. 
A Question of Loyalties-
THE INITIAL PLOT called for poisoning Castro in 
his favorite Havana restaurant, where one of Traf-
ficante's men worked. The CIA's Technical Services 
Divi-
sion supplied deadly botulinum toxin which Robert Ma-
heu, who was coordinating the mob's efforts for the CIA, 
passed to a?xile associated with Trafficante at the Fon-
tainebleu Hotel in Miami Beach. From there Traffi-
cante's courier was to deliver the poison pills to the man 
in the Havana restaurant. , 
All of this took place in March and April of 1961, just 
before. the 13,1y otPigs. Accounts vary as to Why the plan 
failed. One version--is that-the authorization to adminis. ? 
ter the-poi:son never came through;- another, that Castro 
stopped going to the restaurant. 
The most intriguing theory was proposed by the CIA's 
'deputy inspector general, Scott Breckenridge, to a Sen-
'ate staff member. Breckenridge, who had been responsi-
ble for investigating the CIA-Mafia plot, maintained that 
Trafficante-had been providing Castro with details of 
the plot all along. 
But why would Santo Trafficante, of all people, -do 
this? One 'possible. explanation is proposed in a July 21, 
1961, report on Trafficante by the Federal Bureau of. 
Narcotics: "There are unconfirmed rumors in the Cuban 
refugee population in Miami that, when Fidel Castro ran 
the American racketeers out of Cuba and seized the casi-
nos, he kept Santo Trafficante Jr. in jail to make it ap 
pear that he had a personal dislike for Trafficante; when 
in-fact Trafficante is an agent of Castro. Trafficante is al-
legedly Castro's ?outlet for illegal contraband in the 
-country." _ 
, 
The report goes: on to summarize contradictory re-
ports on Trafficante's relationship with Castro but, be-
cause of its date, the allegations quoted are of great in-
terest.- Back in 1961,- the Mafia's anti-Castro credentials 
were impeccable.: The informants relied on by the nar-
cotics agents may have been wrong in their conclusions, 
but it is hard to think of a possible self-serving. motive 
for fabricating such a story.

- Here another Bureau of Narcotics report' one

on the drug trade.. 
But Trafficante was in an even better position thatv 
the feds to know about raids on his profits. Had he cho-
.sen to, he could have solved' the problem overnight by 
shifting the payoff numbers from the Havana lottery to 
the weekly dog races in Miami, as he finally did in the 
late 1960s. If, then, these reports are to be belived, Traffi-
cante's Bolita may have served as one of the paymasters 
to the Cuban intelligence network in the United States. 
Divided Loyalties 
rir o THOSE ONLY loosely familiar with. Cuba in the 
1950s, and the Mafia's intricate role there, it must 
seem absurd to suggest that the underworld could col-
laborate with Castro's intelligence. But the Mafia is not a 
monolith and not all of its branches had been Castro's 
enemies. The Mafia had placed most of its bets on the 
dictator Fulgencio Batista, but it had also served as the 
gun runners for the revolutionaries. Castro; as well as 
mosVother important Cuban revolutionary leaders, had 
previously dealt with and relied on one or another un-
derworld family for arms to carry on the fight. 
, As the owners and managers of the luxury hotels and 
'gambling casinos in old Havana, the Mafia had played a 
pervasive role in Cuban life. Soon after Castro's victory 
its leaders were no longer welcome in Cuba as its opera-
tions were progressively closed down; but it still had 
friends and former business associates high in Castro's 
government. The complexity of the Mafia-Castro rela-
tionship is exemplified by the ambiguities that surround 
the Imprisonment and release of Trafficante himself in 
1959.. 
It was a time when thousands of enemies of the revo-
lution (and Trafficante clearly seemed to fall into this 
category) were being summarily taken out and shot. The 
Bureau of Narcotics report suggests the possibility that 
he had agreed to work with Castro and that the jailing 
Was designed to provide cover. But officially, he got out 
of Cuba thanks to the services of his, resourceful lawyer, - 
Rafael Garcia Bango. Bango is himself another good ex-
ample of that _era's ambiguities ? not least because his 
brOther Jorge was and is one of Castro's closest friends 
and advisers. (He is Castro's regular handball partner 
and is the minister of sports, a prestigious post in Cuba.) 
? ? 
After getting Traficante out of Cuba, Bango stayed on 
for the turbulent first seven years of the revolutionary 
government. Then, in 1966, he left for Miami, where he 
came to the attention of a federal anti-crime strike force ? 
which had Trafficante under surveillance. According to 
one strike force official, the two men had whit 
amounted to a "father-son relationship." Eight months 
later Bango was arrested and jailed in Spain for passing 
counterfeit American money. 
Significantly, Bango is now back in Cuba. That an im-
portant mob attorney, whatever his family connections, 
should find life palatable in the new Cuba is at least cu-
rious. But there seem to be nothing but contradictions in 
the lifestyles of Trafficante and his friends. 
15 
Mysterious Grafitti 
.1p OR THE NEXT PART of Trafficante's history we 
must turn to Jose Aleman,, an exile in Miami who-
became involved with Trafficante in 1962 through his--! 
cousin, Garcia Bango. Aleman had 'been a rich young 
revolutionary in Havana, one of the leaders of the al-
most successful 1957 attack on Batista's presidential' pal-
ace. His then considerable wealth had -enabled him, to-. 
maintain a base in Florida where he owned the Trade-
winds Motel and much other Miami real estate, includ- , 
Ing the Miami Stadivm. The Tradewinds figured promi-, 
nently in the revolution, for by 1957 most of the leading, 
revolutionaries in Havana had fled' into exile, including 
many of Castro's followers, and most ended up by stay-
ing there at Aleman's expense.-? 
_ ? ? 
After the revolution, Aleman returned to Cuba and' 
stayed' a year before he was forced into exile again.?
this time as a pounter-revolutionary. On arriving in the 
United States, he was met by George Davis of the FBI 
with a subpoena to appear as a witness against a Mafioso 
named Norman Rothman at a trial in Chicago. 
Aleman had had frequent dealings with the Mafia 
when he was buying guns for the revolution. He had met 
Rothman in 1958 when the latter was trying to save his 
Cuban investments by ingratiating himself with the anti-
Batista forces. Rothman offered to flood Cuba with fake 
currency in order to bankrupt the economy and bring 
down the government. In return he wanted to be able to 
maintain his gambling operations. Aleman had rejected 
his offer. He tried to avoid testifying, but the FBI re-
minded him that, if he did not cooperate, he might be 
subject to prosecution for illegal gun running. 
Aleman's relationship with the FBI had initially been 
-hostile. The. Tradewinds "was an armed barracks," ex-
plained George Davis, who was assigned to monitor the 
exile activities, and the FBI had tried to close it down. 
But by late 1958 the Bureau had cause to change its 
mind. Aleman had visited the State Department. to warn 
that Fidel Castro was a Communist, and he persuaded 
one of the Communist revolutionaries staying at the Tra-
dewinds to brief the FBI on the nature of the party in 
Cuba. 
All of this stood Aleman in good stead with the Miami 
FBI office, particularly after Castro revealed his politi-
cal affiliations. And after his testimon in the Rothman 
trial, Aleman's relationship with the Bureau grew very 
close. The FBI men came to rely on him, not only as a 
useful source of information, but as a guide to under-
standing the customs and thinking of the exiles. "Jose's 
a real nice fellow," the now retired Davis remarked. 
"He's a reliable individual."' 
After his appearance at Rothman's trial, Aleman con-
tinued to meet regularly with his contacts at the FBI to. 
report on exiles he suspected of being Castro agents. He 
also told them of an extraordinary series of meetings 
with Trafficante. 
Traffieante's Indiscretion ? 
WHEN ALEMAN'S FATHER died, his stepmother 
inherited most of the fortune and the inheritance 
taxes were so high that Jose Jr. (who had already lost his 
land holdings in Cuba to the revolution) was forced to 
sell the Miami Stadium and the Tradewinds Motel. By 
.1962 he was in debt, with his only asset the three-story 
Scott Bryan Motel, on Collins Avenue and 33d St., in Mi-
ami Beach. 
Some time in September of 1962 an old revolutionary 
colleague who rented an apartment at the motel told 
Aleman that Trafficante wanted to see him. The col-
league explained that Trafficante felt indebted to Ale-
man's cousin, Garcia Bango, and wanted to express his 
gratitude by helping Aleman out of his financial diffichl-. 
ties. He was prepared to arrange a sizeable loan from the 
Teamsters Union. Aleman's friend assured him that the 
loan was perfectly legal and that it had already been 
cleared by Jimmy Hoff a himself. 
Aleman was understandably, wary ? particularly

Approved For Release 2001/08/08 : CIA-RDP77-00432R000100400002-1 
since' he had so recently testified againit a Mafia leader.' 
But mire enough, the Tampa godfather did visit Aleman, 
at the Seen Bryan and offered him the loan $1.5 mil-
lion to replace the ramshackle motel with a 12-story'. 
glass-wonder, complete with a penthouse apartment for 
Aleman. 
Aleman says that Trafficante spent most of the even-
ing philosophizing. "He spoke almost poetically about 
democracy and-civil liberties." But then he turned to the 
Kennedys: they were -not honest, they took graft and. 
they did not keep a bargain. He complained about their 
attacks on his friends, saying, "Have you seen how his 
brother is hitting-Hoffa, a man who is a workers; who is 
not a millionaire, a friend of the blue collars? He doesn't, 
know that this kind of encounter is very delicate. Mark 
my words, this man Kennedy is in trouble, and he will 
set what is coming to him." Aleman says that he argued 
that KennedS, would get reelected, and Trafficante 
re-
plied, "No, Jose, he is going to be hit.", ' , 
Alenian says that he reported this conversation to his 
FBI contacts, who expressed interest only in Traffi-
canted' business proposals. Aleman assumed that they 
dismissed the Kennedy warnings as gangland braggado-
cio. 
For the next year, Trafficante used the Scott Bryan as 
his business headquarters, renting an apartment when; 
ever he came to town. Aleman met with him frequently, 
to discuss the Teamsters loan and Trafficante soon be-
gan to lead Aleman into other kinds of conversations 
.and to introduce-him to other Mafia figures like Angelo 
Bruno of Philadelphia. Aleman, like his FBI -contacts, 
could not -quite figure out what Trafficante was doing. 
But he played along, hoping the loan would come 
through. Also the FBI considered his information valua-
ble and he Was pleased to be of service. 
Starting in late 1962 and continuing through the sum-
mer of 1963, Aleman says that three Cubans he had 
known in Havana and at the Tradewinds, who had gone 
to work for Castro after the revolution, appeared in Mi-
.ami and then left for Texas. He suspected them of being 
Cuban agents and he told this to the FBI. "I advised the 
FBI in long conversations that I thought something was 
going to happen: .. I was telling them to be careful." By. 
this time Alemari?ays he -was meeting quite frequently 
with his FBI contacts.-They listened to-what he said but 
rarely seemed interested in his speculations. . 
About the endof October, 1963, the same exile who 
had introduced Aleman to Trafficante asked Aleman to 
sign a petition bitterly critical of President Kennedy. 
Aleman was no great admirer of the Kennedys. He 
signed the petition but immediately had second 
thoughts, especially when it was reproduced in several 
Cuban newspapers in Miami. 
On the day of the Kennedy assassination, Aleman ar-
rived home to find' that the FBI had telephoned. "I was 
worried that, because of the petition, they might suspect 
me." But what they were interested in was Trafficante's 
previous statement that Kennedy was going to be "hit." 
"Two agents [Aleman is quite certain one of them was 
Paul Scranton] came out to see me: They wanted to 
know more and more. I finally had to tell them he didn't 
say he was going to do it. He just said Kennedy was . 
going to get hit." The agents stayed until they had ex-
plored every possible angle and then _told. Almeman to. 
keep the conversation confidential. 
The only source for all of this is Aleman, who 'claims 
that he personally repeated everything to various offi-
cials of the FBI; especially George Davis and Paul Scran-
ton in 1962 and 1963. Both agents acknowledge their fre-
quent contacts with Aleman but both declined to com-
ment on Aleman's conversations- with Traffieante. 
Scranton explained he would have to have clearance: "I 
wouldn't want to do anything to embarrass the Bureau." 
The Enemy of My Enemy 
IN' SEEKING to destroy both the Castro regime and 
the Mafia empire, the Kennedys had aroused two des-
peratl'enemies, each, With a tradition of violence ant; 
covert action. No proof that either was connected witir 
the assassination of President Kennedy has ever been 
produced._ But their traditions and their predicament at, 
the Moment whin Kennedy was cut, down make eitheel 
eligible suspects: And when the two-front war that the; 
Kennedys were waging is viewed through the experi-
ence of Santo Trafficante, it becomes at least interesting; 
to speculate on the possibility:of these two powers oper-., 
, 
ating in concert. ' 
The possibility becomes even more intriguing if one,' 
chooses to take seriously a memorandum to the director: 
Of the CIA recently declassified from the Warren Com-
mission files. It reports the conversation of a gritish, 
journalist, John Wilson (also known as Wilson-Hudson) at 
the American Embassy' in London just four days after 
Kennedy was killed. Wilson said that in jail in Cuba After 
the revolution in 1959 he had met an American ,"gangs--
ter-gambler named .Santos who could not return to the 
U.S.A. because there were several indictments outstand-
ing against him. Santos opted therefore to remain. in pri-
son for a period of time paying Castroin dollars for his 
rather luxurious and definitely non-prisonlike accom-
modations... While Santos was in prison," Wilson says, 
"Santos was visited by an American gangster type 
named Ruby." 
It is tempting to make much of such a document but 
? more needs to be known about the English . journalist, 
about the memo and about Jack Ruby's travels before 
any conclusions can be made. Probably the only witness 
who could help answer the questions raised here are the 
CIA's old Mafia associates. The Church committee Only 
managed to interview- one of them, John Roselli. Sam 
Giancana, due to give his testimony, was executed the 
day before. Santo Trafficante was never called as a wit-
ness. The committee 'staff claimed he could not be 
found. 
None of the extraordinary possibilities that have sur-
-faced here offer a documentable refutation of the sole - 
assassin theory. As in all such explorations touching on 
the Kennedy assassiAation, the trail goes cold as it ap-
proaches Dallas. But that does not mean that there was 
not a conspiracy. There is simply no assurance that con-
spiracies, when they exist, must inevitably come to light.. 
Many secrets prove not all that hard to keep. 
Just consider the numbers of people who knew about 
the CIA's secret war against Cuba in the early 1960s ? 
about the Agency's mammoth station in Miami with its 
400 case officers, its 2,000 Cuban agents, its navy and 
small air force, its arsenals, safe houses, and its paramili-
tary operations against Cuba. Certainly thousands of 
people had a rather general knowledge of that massive 
campaign. And yet it was not until last year that the 
American public even learned that President Kennedy 
had gone on to wage a covert Cuban war after the Bay of 
,Pigs. Similarly, nine years ago, Drew Pearson and Jack 
-Anderson reported the CIA's assassination plotting with 
the Mafia. But no one paid any attention. ? 
It is a well known psychological phenomenon that you 
can't see what your imagination is not prepared to ac-
cept. In a recent interview, Sen. Howard Baker (R-Tenn.) 
reflected on his experience over the past few years in 
exploring Watergate and the world of U.S. intelligence: 
"The great fear that I have is that I'll wake up 10 years ? 
from now, and it will all suddenly fall into place, and I'll 
realize what a damn fool I was."

WASHINGTON STAR 
28 MAY 1976 
By Tad SZUIC 
Reprinted by permission from The New Republic 
IC) 1976 by The New Republic, Inc. 
The FBI and the CIA engaged in a 
cover-up of highly relevant informa-
tion when the Warren Commission 
was investigating President John F. 
Kennedy's assassination in 1963 and 
1964. 
President Lyndon Johnson and 
Atty. Gen, Robert F. Kennedy be-
came party to the effort which con-
sisted of withholding key facts from 
the Warren Commission. 
The cover-up continues even now, 
12 years later: The FBI still refuses 
to turn over to congressional investi-
gators some of its most sensitive files 
on the circumstances of the killing in 
Dallas. 
A delay of six months is expected 
before the new Senate Intelligence 
Oversight Committee decides wheth-
er to reopen the investigation into the 
assassination of President John F. 
Kennedy, Chairman Daniel K. 
Inouye, D-Hawaii, said yesterday. 
Inouye, who spoke with reporters 
after the committee's first meeting 
yesterday, said the committee will 
concentrate first on drafting new 
charters for the CIA and other intel-
ligence agencies. 
Results of an investigation of the 
Kennedy assassination by the Senate 
Select Intelligence Committee, which 
spent 15 months studying the case, 
are expected to be made public with-
in the next two weeks. Senators who 
have seen the report are predicting it 
will raise more questions than an-
swers. 
The 172-page report, drafted by a 
subcommittee, will focus on the per-
formance of the CIA and FBI before 
and after the Nov. 22, 1963, slaying 
and will go into the possible motives 
of Lee Harvey Oswald. 
The report is expected to detail 
both allegedly deliberate and acci-
dental failures by the CIA and FBI to 
provide the Warren Commission with 
information. 
The Warren Commission was 
never told that Robert Kennedy se-
cretly formed ? before his brother , 
was killed ? a special intergovern-
mental committee which included 
FBI and CIA representatives to look 
into the ,possibility that Cuban 
Premier Fidel Castro might organize 
attempts on the lives of high U.S. 
government officials. 
THAT THIS committee existed has 
been kept secret although informa-
tion about it reposes in FBI files. 
The top-secret ' committee was: 
created by Robert Kennedy presum-
ably out of concern that Castro might 
retaliate against CIA attempts on his'.7 
life, carried out directly by the agen-
cy's operatives and with help from; 
the Mafia. 
That anti-Castro assassination.; 
plots were afoot in the early 1960s 
was unknown at the time (they were 
disclosed last year by the Senate Se-
lect Committee on Intelligence Ac-
tivities) and the Warren Commission', 
was not told of them. Only Allen W..: 
Dulles, who had been CIA director;;- 
_ _  
had knowledge of the anti-
Castro plots. 
In its ignorance the com-
mission couldn't search 
more ? intensively into the 
possible motives of Lee 
Harvey Oswald in killing 
the President. The commis-
sion concluded that Oswald 
?was the lone assassin in 
Dallas, but it acknowledged 
its inability to come up with 
the motive. 
IT DOES NOT follow, of 
course, that the Warren 
Commission would surely 
have traced Oswald's mo-
tives had it known of the 
anti-Castro conspiracies 
and of the establishment of 
Robert Kennedy's secret 
group sometime before 
Dallas. There is no proof 
that Castro was behind Os-
wald. 
But the cover-up made it 
impossible for the commis-
sion to seriously pursue a 
line of inquiry in this area 
even though there had been 
much discussion of the sig-
nificance of Oswald's links 
with the Fair Play for Cuba 
Committee (a pro-Castro 
group in the United States) 
and his aborted effort to go 
to Cuba two months before 
he killed John Kennedy. 
Robert Kennedy, the CIA 
and the FBI decided to keep 
from the Warren Commis-
sion the fact that the special 
group had been set up. To 
justify its existence, it 
would have been necessary 
to expose the CIA's own 
conspiracies against Cas-
tro. ;These were among the 
most closely held secrets of 
the Kennedy-Johnson peri-
od. 
THAT THE CIA failed to 
inform the Warren Com-
mission of anti-Castro plots 
? even though the agency 
was under presidential 
orders to provide maximum 
assistance to the commis-
17 
sion ? was confirmed in a 
memo on April 20, 1975, 
written by CIA Insp. Gen. 
Donald F. Chamberlain to 
CIA Deputy Director E.H. 
Knoche. It said: 
"As far as we can tell 
from all of the materials a* 
our, d4osition, no one dis 
cussed with the Warren 
'Commission any alleged 
plan to assassinate Castro. 
There is also no evidence 
that anyone known to our 
records made a decision not 
to tell the Warren Commi-
siute iip. ing about this 
topic or any other matter." 
Chamberlain added that 
"we have no evidence in 
our material indicating 
Castro's knowledge or the 
possession of documenta-
tion of alleged assassina-
tion plots directed against 
him." 
Two days later, on April 
22, 1975, Raymond G. 
Rocca, then deputy chief of 
the CIA's counterintelli-
gence staff, informed 
Knoche that "our records 
show at every point a 
marked intent to make as 
much available to the 
(Warren Commission) as 
was consistent with the se-
curity of the ongoing opera-
tions." 
ROCCA ALSO reported 
. that his files do not show 
whether the Warren Com-
mission was informed of a 
1962 report from the CIA's 
station in Guatemala ac-
cording to which a state-
ment was made at a Guate-
malan Communist party 
meeting that "we need not 
preoccupy ourselves over 
the politics of President 
Kennedy because we know, 
according to prognostica-
tion, that he will die within 
the present year." 
Although, as Rocca put 
it, the counterintelligence 
staff was the CIA's! 
"working-level point of I 
contact with the Warrenj 
Commission," plans to, 
assassinate Castro were not: 
"known to us in CIA staff." .1 
In all likelihood Johnson,1 
who knew of the anti-Castro' 
plotting, also knew that 
Robert Kennedy had set up 
his special committee. But

November 1963. 
Robert Kennedy's testi-
mony before the Warren 
Commission likewise omit-
ted mention of his own fears 
that assassinations might 
breed assassinations. 
BUT IT IS part of the 
public record that Johnson 
subsequently commented, 
without elaborating, that 
President Kennedy- might 
have been killed in retalia-
tion for his administration's 
anti-Castro policies. At the I 
time, this' remark was 
taken to mean possible re-
taliation for the 1961 Bay of 
Pigs invasion and subse-
quent CIA operations 
against Cuba. 
All these facts, secret at 
the time, may have influ-
enced the Kennedy family 
in its decision to oppose any 
reopening of the assassina-
tion probe. Again, a new 
investigation might have 
led to public disclosures of 
the CIA plotting,, and tar-
nishing the memory of John 
and Robert Kennedy. 
Robert Kennedy's inter-
est in aggressive operations 
against Cuba was reported 
in a document written by 
John McCone, then CIA 
director, on Oct. 4, 1962, de-
scribing a top-level strate-
gy meeting chaired by the 
attorney general. McCone 
wrote that "the attorney 
general reported on discus-
sions with the President on 
Cuba; dissatisfied with lack 
of action in the sabotage 
field, went on to stress that 
nothing was moving for-
ward, commented that one 
effort attempted had 
failed. . . ." 
ANOTHER ELEMENT 
of the cover-up was that in 
at least 50 instances the CIA 
had, according to an inter-
nal FBI memo, ignored 
materials supplied by the 
bureau on Oswald's foreign 
connections. 
The responsibility for fol-
lowing up such FBI- leads 
was in the hands of an ad 
hoc group built around the 
CIA's so-called "D Staff," a 
clandestine operations cen-
ter then headed by William 
Harvey, a senior agency 
official. The CIA's coun-
terintelligence office, di-
rected by James Angleton, 
reported directly to Har-
vey's "D staff," and it too 
was involved in investigat-
ing certain aspects of the 
Kennedy assassination. 
Sources contend that the 
CIA actually destroyed 
some of the materials pro-
vided by the FBI. Angleton, 
according to those sources, 
may have suspected Soviet 
"plants" in the FBI materi-
al. The Warren Commission 
never knew about any of it. 
As has been reported 
earlier, the FBI destroyed 
at least one letter Oswald 
sent to the Dallas police de-
partment shortly before the 
assassination. Oswald de-
manded that the FBI stop 
"harrassing" his Russsian-
porn wife Marina and 
threatened to blow up the 
Dallas police headquarters 
if the FBI failed to desist. 
THIS BECAME known 
only last year, and the FBI 
never offered a conclusive 
explanation for destroying 
the note. 
Likewise, the FBI inex-
plicably failed to place Os-
wald on its "dangerous 
list" although it did so with 
other members of the Fair 
Play Committee. 
A CIA memorandum to 
the Rockefeller Commis-
sion, which last year inves-
tigated CIA abuses, said 
that the agency still feels, 
as it did in 1964, that the 
Warren Comrnission should 
have given more credence 
in its final report to the 
possibility of foreign links 
in the conspiracy against 
Kennedy. The memo said 
that there were promising 
leads that were not followed 
up. 
This statement contra-
dicts the FBI memorandum 
now in the possession of the 
Senate Select Committee 
that the CIA refused to pur-
sue leads obtained by the 
bureau. However acute 
rivalry between the CIA 
and the FBI already existed 
at the time ? they actual:y 
stopped cooperating alto-
gether in 1970 ? and their 
estrangement could ac-
count for the contradic-
tions. 
THE COVER-UP is 
lamong the reasons the Sen-
ate Select Committee voted 
on May 13 to recommend a 
congressional inquiry into 
the role of the intelligence 
agencies in the Warren 
Commission investigation 
and into Oswald's moitives. 
The Senate committee 
first learned of the cover-
up a few months ago. This 
is the new evidence the 
panel claims it has obtained 
about Oswald's motives. 
Sen. Richard Schweiker of 
Pennsylvania and Sen. 
Gary Hart of Colorado, who 
constitute a special sub-
committee on the Kennedy 
assassination, have written 
a separate report on the 
subject. - 
Neither Schweiker nor 
Hart has publicly revealed 
thus far the nature of the 
new evidence. There is said 
to be great pressure to 
sanitize this report while the 
full secret information 
would be turned over to the 
Senate's new permanent 
oversight committee on 
intelligence or whatever 
other panel might under-
take the recommendation 
investigation of the Kenne-
dy death. 
The Subcommittee re-
port. to be issued in mid-
June, will first be inspected 
by the FBI and the CIA, to 
remove what they consider 
"embarrassing informa-
tion." 
ALTHOUGH senators are 
far from certain that the 
proposed inquiry would 
actually provide a conclu-
sive answer about Oswald's 
motives the trail has be-
come cold in the opinion of 
many senators ? the FBI 
and CIA could find them-
selves under charges of ob-
struction of justice for hav-
ing withheld significant 
material from the Warren 
Commission. 
Among the questions 
likely to be raised in a new 
investigation is why Dulles 
concealed from the Warren 
Commission, on which he 
served, the plotting against 
Castro by the CIA. CIA's 
own records, released in 
mid-May, show that the 
agency had already begun 
to plan Castro's assassina-
tion in March 1960, when 
Dulles was CIA director, 
and planning had by then 
begun for the Bay of Pigs. 
Excerpts from tran-
scripts of the Warren Corn-
mission's executive ses-
sions (published in The New 
Republic on Sept. 27. 1975) 
show that Dulles informed 
his colleagues that there 
were certain CIA secrets 
that he would keep from 
everybody except the presi-
dent. Dulles was addressing 
the still unclarified question 
of whether Oswald, as 
maintained by some assas-
sination buffs, had been an. 
undercover FBI informer_ 
A SIMILAR question 
could be raised with John 
McCone who was CIA 
director during the Warren 
Commission investigations 
and who should be called to 
testify in any new Senate 
inquiry. McCone was famil-
iar , with the anti-Cas-, 
plots and probably 
abeut Robert Kenneti, ?-; 
cret committee. 
All the indicatioe . are 
that the existence this 
committee was known to 
18 
very few people: Robert 
Kennedy himself. probably 
Dulles and McCone. FBI 
Director J. Edgar Hoover, 
and a few selected associ-
ates. 
Several aides of Robert 
Kennedy. including a for-
mer assistant director of 
the FBI, said in interviews 
last week that they had not 
known of the Committee. 
Theysaid, however, that it 
was possible that the group 
could have' been acting in 
secrecy out of the White 
House or attorney general's 
office before and after the 
Kennedy assassination. 
The Senate Intelligence 
Committee teamed of the 
cover-up in the course of its 
long investigation of the 
intelligence community_ 
After references were made 
by witnesses to the Robert 
Kennedy committee in 
testimony touching on for-
eign assassination plots by 
the CIA. the Church Com-
mittee .asked the FBI and 
the CIA for their relevant 
files. - 
, IT IS UNDERSTOOD 
that the CIA made some 
material available; the FBI 
refused to do so for many 
months. Only recently did 
the bureau agree to allow 
Senate committee members 
to read parts of its secret 
files, but the senators have 
to do it at FBI headquar-
ters. 
It was in this manner that 
senators learned of the 
scope of the cover-up by the 
intelligence agencies. 
They've, now requested 
additional materials from 
the FBI. Some senators are 
said to believe that further 
vital information on the 
Kennedy assassination 
investigation may turn up 
in the FBI files. 
It remains unclear why, 
after 12 years, the FBI is 
still reluctant to let sena-
tors see all its files on the 
assassinations. There are 
no indications that the bu-
reau has been under any 
pressure from the White 
House ? President Ford 
was a member of the War-
ren Commission ? to with-
hold material from the Sen-
ate. In fact, Ford himself' 
now may be unaware of the 
contents of the FBI files. 
That raises again a funda-
mental question: Is the 
White House in full control 
of the intelligence agen-
cies?

SATURDAY REVIEW' 
29 MAY 1976 
CIA Reform: How Much Is Enough? 
by George C. McGhee 
'The recent report of the Senate Select 
Committee on Intelligence Activities 
provides an excellent basis for congres-
sional action to reform the CIA. The 
President's own recent reorganization of 
the agency, however, ignores key issues 
that must be dealt with by Congress. 
The very word intelligence is prejudi-
cial in its own favor. Everyone agrees 
that a government should base its activi-
ties on the best available intelligence. The 
Central Intelligence Agency, which, as 
its name implies, has been the focal point 
for such activities within our govern-
ment, has been brought into serious 
question. Yet it has important responsi-
bilities which are vital to national secu-
rity and must be continued. How do we 
separate the good in the CIA from the 
bad? How can we clarify, in the public 
mind, the difference? How can we build 
a new intelligence structure which can 
perform the essential functions with pub-
lic confidence? In my view, the Presi-
dent's executive order has not answered 
these questions. 
The present agency was spawned by 
the Second World War. It was created 
at war's end as a "grab bag" not just for 
the intelligence activities of the Office 
of Strategic Services but for a varied 
group of other covert activities. Pro-
tected by wartime security, these opera-
tions had not been under normal moral, 
legal, or resource limitations. In retro-
spect, it was, I believe, a mistake to have 
included such diverse operations under 
one umbrella. It was particularly mis-
leading to call it an intelligence agency. 
Obviously, much of what it did went far 
beyond any ordinary definition of that 
term. Moreover, it provided continuity 
for wartime methods and objectives. War 
was succeeded by "cold war," with little 
change in outlook. 
It should be understood, of course, 
that the CIA does not have a monopoly 
on intelligence. The Pentagon has its 
Defense Intelligence Agency. The De-
partment of State, comprising some 
7,500 people in Washington and 16,000 
abroad, is in itself an enormous intelli-
gence-gathering organization, not limited 
to its Bureau of Intelligence and Re-
search. There is no obvious cutoff point 
between what should and what should 
not be done by the CIA. The agency 
has engaged in many activities, such as 
support for the National Student Asso-
ciation, because it could get the funds 
from Congress and State couldn't. 
Nevertheless, as we continue to de-
velop our overall intelligence capability, 
I believe we should also perpetuate an 
independent intelligence agency as a 
normal arm of government. There is, of 
course, the supporting theory that intelli-
gence estimates by such an agency will 
be more objective in assessing the suc-
cess or failure of policy. There is also 
- the need for expertise and continuity in 
particular specialties which can perhaps 
best be provided by an 'independent 
agency. A case in point is the analysis 
of aerial photographs from satellites. 
It must be emphasized, however, that 
most CIA intelligence githering is,, like 
satellite photography, quite open? and-
aboveboard. Only the results need be 
kept secret. Many data are obtained from 
passive radio intercepts made by the mili-
tary National Security Agency. Provided 
one has a place to put one's aerial, inter-
cepts are an accepted tool. Often, how-
ever, in the search for intelligence, the 
line of legality must be breached. Covert 
means must be employed. Calculated 
risks must be taken. Spies are used. 
Someone is paid off. Forced entry is 
made. We must also protect ourselves?
through counterespionage?from similar 
activities by other governments. In a dan-
gerous world this is an accepted "gray" 
area in which all nations must compete, 
including, under appropriate restraints, 
our own intelligence agency. 
BEYOND THIS, however, as everyone 
knows, the CIA has been engaged in a 
wide range of covert activities which do 
not constitute intelligence collection at 
all; indeed, they are separated by a deep 
chasm. What I speak of, of course, is the 
whole array of covert operational activi-
ties, or "dirty tricks." This includes all 
secret attempts to manipulate the rest of 
the world in our favor. This is what was 
on trial before the Church committee and 
world opinion. It is these activities which 
have, by association, blemished CIA's 
legitimate intelligence function. The 
principal rationale, moreover, for putting 
them under the same roof, i.e., that the 
same agents do both, is not believed to be 
overriding. Results could be more objec-
tively analyzed by an intelligence succes-
sor to the CIA if the two arms were 
separated, yet closely coordinated. 
I was amazed when I came back into 
the State Department in 1961, after an 
absence of seven years, to learn the extent 
to which the CIA had become involved 
in covert activities all around the world. 
The Bay of Pigs operation, which lay ripe 
for plucking on the drawing board, was 
only one of many. I considered most too 
risky for the possible meager gains in-
volved. We were operating in many 
countries. Some were close allies whose 
friendship we were risking. We were still 
supporting democratic parties in Western 
Europe long after the countries involved 
had recovered economically. Most of our 
operations were relatively unimportant 
to our national security. 
When a government agency goes op-
erational covertly, there is, of course, a 
variety of choices. You start by subsidiz-
ing foreign magazines and newspapers to 
influence popular opinion, then pro-
gress to support for political parties and 
discreet bribes to officials. In the past 
little attention has been paid to such ac-
19 
tivities; however, this is only the start. 
With know-how and funds available, you 
attempt to control elections, bring about 
the fall of governments, or even assassi-
nate political leaders. On the macroscale 
this leads to what is, in effect, uncle.: 
clared-war. It was an open secret that in 
Laos the CIA for years ran a war in-
volving large-scale air and ground forces. 
The CIA was deeply involved in Vietnam 
-before our military took over. 
Where do such activities start and end? 
What is their proper role? How can they 
be controlled? I believe that responsi-
bility for covert operational activities 
must be separated from the intelligence 
function. These operations must also be 
reduced greatly in scope. They must con-
stitute the exceptional rather than the 
usual instrument of policy. Any decision 
to employ them must take into account 
the long-range impact on United States 
and world opinion. People all around the 
world are now convinced that the CIA 
is manipulating their governments and 
people. Americans abroad are suspect as 
being under "cover" for CIA?our em-
bassies, our companies, our professors, 
and our tourists. We are paying a high 
price for marginal gains. 
Authority for covert operations must 
stem from our highest authority?the 
President?even if he may not always be 
forced to admit it. Those directing the 
operations must also be responsible to 
the Congress, preferably through one 
joint committee of the two houses. Every 
effort must be made to maintain secrecy. 
Guidelines must be set. Most Americans 
would insist, as a minimum, on a total 
taboo on assassination?and on unde-
clared war, that is, one not first approved 
by Congress. The joint committee itself 
could decide what should be approved 
by Congress as a whole. The agency 
devoted exclusively to intelligence 
should be an open operation, staffed by 
professionals. It should need little 
"cover." Covert operations beyond in-
telligence should be conducted by some 
new, anonymous agency reporting di-
rectly to the President. Any undeclared 
wars tacitly approved by Congress should 
be run by a branch of the military, upon 
whose expertise it would draw. 
Most important, however, we must 
understand that today's world cannot be 
manipulated by us in such an obvious 
way. A prominent CIA official once 
bragged to me that their operations had 
saved 13 countries from communism. He 
did not mention countries where we are 
considered the enemy as a result of abor-
tive CIA operations. We win dubiously in 
Chile, but we lose in Cambodia. We give 
Soviet arms to the Kurds and use the re-
sulting appearance of Soviet intervention 
to justify furnishing arms to Iran. We 
give arms to Holden Roberto in Angola, 
and when the Soviet-backed Popular 
Front appears stronger, we feel com-
pelled to raise the ante. What is cause 
and what is effect? How do you win such-
a game?

nalist berate America for sabotaging our 
CIA just when it could have won the 
struggle against communism in Portugal. 
Does anyone really think a few million 
dollars can control the destiny of 10 mil-
lion people? 
If we are to produce-the open and wise 
policies that will-earn for us the place in 
the world we deserve, we must first rid 
ourselves of the delusion that we can win 
by the cheap and easy way of covert 
manipulation. At the same time, we must 
regroup and reform our varied intelli-
gence activities?building what is appro-
priate into an independent and a re-
spected arm of our government. When 
we venture into the murky area beyond, 
we should do so under new auspices, 
strict guidelines, and complete responsi-
bility?not just to the President but, 
through the Congress, to the American 
people. For it is they who will have to 
pay the price of any failures, as they have 
done in Vietnam. 0

Kennedy assassination questions 
? More than 12 years after the assassination of 
President. John F. Kennedy there are still very 
serious questions that need to be answered if 
that tragic event is to be laid to rest. 
It is not only that small group of writers and 
investigators convinced that a conspiraey was 
behind the Dallas shooting who doubt that- Lee 
Harvey Oswald acted alone. Polls show that 60 
percent of 'Americans do not accept the find-
ings of the Warren Commission. David Belin, 
senior staff member of both the Warren Com-
mission and later the Rockefeller Commission 
which last year probed CIA operations, has 
called on Congress to reopen the inquiry. 
- Evidence has emerged showing that the 
FBI had information on Oswald, yet his 
name was not on a Secret Service list of per-
sons considered a threat-to the President. It 
has been shown that the CIA failed to tell the 
Warren Commission about its plots to kill Cu-
ban Premier Fidel Castro, and that the FBI de-
stroyed?a threatening note delivered by Oswald 
to FBI offices just before the. assassination.

ONE MORE CHORUS, now, with a 
little more pizazz and guts from you 
citizen voices on the back row. 
Newly named CIA Director George 
Bush is taking hold, as you expected, 
and he said something in Lawrence, 
Kan. the other day that really puts this 
whole intelligence ruckus down to the 
earth level where we concerned folks 
can read the message. 
In muted answer to 1,000 plus critical 
pages from the ravenous Senate Intelli-
gence Committee staff that accuses the 
FBI and of everything but 
effectiveness, Bush said simply, but 
tellingly: 
-WE NEED. a covert (hidden, se-
cret) capability. I believe we can oper-
ate in as clean a fashion as we can. But 
there are some grubby things in this spy 
business . 
Certainly and Congress knows it 
? there are some "grubby" things in 
intelligence operations. That's what it is 
all about or we wouldn't have a CIA and 
an FBI. You don't hand your card to the 
enemy, domestic or foreign, and say 
"Pardon me, old man, but. 
An agent knows when he acts that it 
is your nation, your society, your life ? 
or his. 
And the sooner we get off the 
whelped backs of CIA and FBI now 
trying to cleanse their houses of decades 
old questionable past practices the bet-
ter chance far this society, this nation. 
The opposition points have been 
made ? and some were well made ? ? 
but hOw the hunters had better start 
listening to very cold warnings from 
men like. Bush and get realistic about 
The possibility, of a link between the. Ken-
nedy shooting. and U.S. plots to kill the Cuban 
leader is just too strong to ignore. The Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence has reported 
that on the dayMr. Kennedy was assassinated, 
the CIA was outfitting an operative to kill Mr. 
Castro. 
Now members of that Senate committee 
have called. for a new, investigation to go 
beyond. the "who" to the "why," and this 
seems entirely called for, given the new infor-
mation that has been revealed as well as grow-
ing public doubts about the original findings. It 
may not be necessary to entirely reopen the 
whole matter, but these latest questions should 
be answered. 
President. Ford, who was a member of the 
Warren Commission, some months ago agreed 
that such a limited reinvestigation is neces-
sary. With the Senate about to consider a new 
intelligence oversight committee that could un-
dertake such an investigation, now is a g000 
time for Mr. Ford to reaffirm his support. 
chorus ? with guts 
this endless donnybrook they have 
initiated. 
Mr. Bush, a totally reliable man 
pushing to re-route objectives of the 
CIA into unassailable legitimacy, now 
warns that in the next decade interna-
tional terrorist threats against the 
United States could be more dangerous 
than conventional military or political 
threats. He told his Lawrence audience 
that there is increasing danger, with 
proliferation of nuclear weapons and 
materials, that terrorist fanatics will 
acquire nuclear capabilities. 
TO COMBAT this prospect of horror, 
there must be support ? not endless 
carping. 
Relentless pursuit ? demonstrably 
past constructive remedial processes ? 
could decimate the entire intelligence 
apparatus. It has been said here over 
and over again, but the congressional 
wolves have made their good and bad 
points and should now move to other 
areas that need repair far more than 
the FBI and CIA. 
In fact, if the current bushwhacking 
continues the public might well demand 
to know precisely what is behind all this 
persistent clamor to "get" the FBI and 
CIA. 
To repeat, valid points have been 
made and certain practices should be 
abolished as totally out of American 
character ? notably foreign assassina-
tion plots and the misuse of the FBI by 
every American president back to 
Franklin D. Roosevelt ? but we must 
not lose our perspective about overall 
intelligence in the headline frenzy of the 
moment. 
20 
Sen. Frank Church., D-Idaho, who 
first chaired the Senate Intelligence 
Committee and then conveniently slip-
ped into the Democrat presidentiai 
preferential race after getting rave 
notices from networks and big press, is 
making few ripples out among the 
people. If we properly read the public in 
the hinterlands, they are weary of 
Washington's daily blast and not suppor-
tive of continued attacks based upon 
very old information. 
NOW WE read of the "chilling" 
.Senate committee report that "docu-
ments" a 40-year pattern of "official 
lawlessness"! 
In 400 pages prepared by eager 
young staff workers, we are told that 
Presidents since 1932 have been sleazy 
operators who used the FBI to track 
down political enemies. 
Most of this' adds up to a desire on 
the part of some members of Congress 
to take over intelligence operations by 
imposing strict controls from a single 
oversight committee. 
This could be the blunder of the 
century if these same Congressional 
members handle other "secret" matters 
by leaking information all over Wash-
ington ? and the world. 
The Senate liberals ha v e been 
temporarily choked off by a more 
sensible Rules Committee amendment 
that would require any oversight com-
mittee to share jurisdiction with other 
committees now involved in intelligence 
oversight. 
If all worked together ? and kept 
their months shut ? intelligence could 
be steered in the proper direction.

Summer 1976 
REORGANIZING 
THE CIA: 
WHO AND HOW 
/n FOREIGN POLICY 22, Peter Szan-
ton and Graham Allison wrote that the 
time had come to -seize the opportunity" 
and restructure the American intelligence 
community. In the exchange that follows, 
William E. Colby and Walter F. Mondale 
comment on their proposals and Szanton 
and Allison reply.?The Editors. 
William E. Colby: 
Indeed we have an opportunity to rethink 
and restructure American intelligence. A year 
of intensive investigation by a presidential 
and two congressional committees, world-
wide concern over sensational accounts of 
CIA deeds and misdeeds, and a series of Con-
stitutional confrontations between the ex-
ecutive and legislative branches cannot dis-
appear into our history books without 
changes in American intelligence. 
The first and easiest action would be to 
tinker with the organizational structure of 
intelligence. When in doubt, or under pres-
sure, reorganize; this is an old bureaucratic 
ploy. It is also a tempting panacea for infi-
nite problems. With due respect for the ideas 
suggested by Peter Szanton and Graham 
Allison, but without agreement with many 
of them, I believe this opportunity should 
be seized in more important fields. 
The fundamental lesson of the year of 
investigation is that American intelligence is 
? a part of and must operate under the Amer-
ican constitutional system. This perhaps ob-
vious fact for Americans is a stunning nov-
elty in the long history of intelligence. It is 
as startling an idea to many developed de-
mocracies as it is incongruous to totalitarians. 
It does not reverse any early American 
dcarine to the contrary. but it does over-
turn longstanding and comfortable practices 
which grew up before the question was 
squarely faced. 
Three conclusions stem from this new 
status of intelligence. First, the place of in-
telligence in the governmental structure must 
be established and understood in open stat-
utes and directives. The National Security 
Act of 1947 made a start in this direction, 
and the CIA Act of 1949 provided statutory 
authority for many of the essential attributes 
of our intelligence service. Both contain 
several vague and encompassing clauses, 
however. The resulting ambiguities led to 
actions which in retrospect fall below to-
day's standards. 
President Ford's executive order of Feb-
ruary 18 makes a major stride in the direc-
tion of providing 3 public charter for Amer-
ican intelligence, describing its structure and 
functions and clearly delimiting areas of au-
thorized, and unauthorized, activity. Sub-
stantial parts of this order, however, should 
be enacted into law, our constitutional pro-
cess of establishing and recording our na-
tional consensus on matters of public import. 
George Washington once said that upon 
"secrecy, success depends in most enterprises" 
of intelligence. The past year has shown al-
most a total lack of consensus and even un-
derstanding of the role and limits of secrecy 
in American intelligence. What were leaks 
rose at times to flood stage proportions. 
Strong voices are heard advocating almost 
every variation on the spectrum from a mod-
ern version of "open intelligence openly ar-
rivea at" to the contention that an Official 
Secrets Act should protect an intelligence 
structure totally hidden in the recesses of the 
executive branch. President Ford has recom-
mended legislation which will impose the es-
sential discipline on intelligence personnel to 
keep the secrets they learn but leave untram-
meled the First Amendment's guarantee of a 
free press. 
We have laws and sanctions to protect 
many secrets necessary to the preservation 
and operation of our free society.. The se-
cret ballot box, the confidence between at-
torney and client, advance crop figures which 
might upset the market, all are protected by 
criminal sanctions against individuals who 
might disclose them. Intelligence secrets. 
however. are in effect only protected against 
the foreign spy. But their disclosure to our 
free society makes them available to the for-
eigner as well, and can cut our nation off 
from sources and information which are es-
sential to its safety in a world which has not 
yet been made safe for democracy. Better 
protection of our sources through law would 
apply to the intelligence profession the same 
discipline that journalism has. found essen-
tial to its functioning. 
The second conclusion from the new sta-
tus of intelligence under the Constitution is 
that it must be responsible and accountable. 
This burden must rest not only on those in 
intelligence: it lies with equal weight on all 
three branches of our constitutional struc-
ture. President Ford has moved to strengthen 
executive control and responsibility for intel-
ligence. The stronger position of the director 
of central intelligence, the interagency com-
mittee structure for the review of the policies 
and programs of national intelligence, and 
independent review and supervision by the 
private citizens of The President's Foreign 
Intelligence Advisory Board. all will increase

the control and accountability of intelligence 
to the president himself and to the senior 
members of the executive branch. 
Congress has an equal duty to arrange it-
self to exercise its constitutional role with 
respect to intelligence. It must assume its full 
responsibilities in all senses of the word. It 
must organize and carry out full and cur-
rent reviews of the intelligence community, 
assuring that it not only remains within the 
guidelines set for it, but also that it is effi-
ciently and comprehensively accomplishing 
the tasks assigned. Congress' other respon-
sibility, however, is to do this without de-
stroying the ability of intelligence to carry 
out its duties. Thus the secrets of intelligence 
must be protected on Capitol Hill as well as 
at the CIA's Langley headquarters. The min-
imum number of people, congressmen as well 
as staff, who truly "need to know" should 
be informed and should be subject to sanc-
tions for improper disclosure. A single com-
mittee, in each House if necessary, should 
represent their colleagues in this function, 
ending the present requirement to brief at 
least six committees. 
The third conclusion which derives from 
intelligence's advent to constitutional status 
is that it must serve the constitutional pro-
cess. Traditionally and in other lands the 
servant only of the executive, it must now 
demonstrate its value to the Congress and 
to the public. It must earn the large invest-
ment needed by modern intelligence, the 
risks and inevitable occasional failures and 
embarrassments incurred, and respect for its 
professional discipline and secrecy. This must 
be accomplished by sharing the fruits of the 
enterprise with all participants in the Amer-
ican decision-making process. 
Perhaps this is the most challenging task 
ahead for intelligence. It must develop the 
distinctions between protecting the secrecy 
of its sources and techniques and making 
available the substance of its information 
and conclusions. It must face public criti-
cism and political challenge of its assess-
ments. It must maintain the independence 
and objectivity of its judgments apart from 
the policies and programs they may sup-
port or question. Internationally, we must 
insist that an intelligence judgment is a step 
toward policy, not a reflection of it, wheth-
er relating to ally or adversary. In a political 
debate where knowledge can be power, in-
telligence judgments must be supplied im-
partially to all factions, to help the best so-
lution to emerge, rather than a favored one. 
This will require many changes in intel-
ligence habits and concepts. The photo-
graphs must be published, the background-
ers attributed, the publications edited to 
protect the sources but circulate the sub-
stance of their reports. 
With these changes, intelligence can be 
distributed regularly to all members of Con-
gress. not held under such high classifica-
22 
tions that it cannot be circulated and made 
conveniently available. The estimates will 
be debated and the sage unanimity of the 
intelligence cloister challenged by those close 
to the struggle and fearful of irrational and 
foolhardy, but real, surprises. Out of the 
process, however, will come a better under-
standing of the role and value of modern in-
telligence, as well as better intelligence itself. 
"Seizing the opportunity" to implement 
these conclusions will mark a major turning 
point in the discipline and profession of in-
telligence. In its wake may come some of 
the structural changes suggested by Szanton 
and Allison and by others joining in the 
close examination of intelligence sparked by 
I975's investigations. Some of their and 
others ideas will not be adopted. and ad-
ditional ones will arise for consideration. 
But the coming of age of intelligence as a 
full participant and contributor to the con-
stitutional process will start a continual re-
view and renewal of intelligence to meet the 
challenges of the future. Among more sub-
stantial substantive benefits to the nation 
and to American intelligence, this will make 
unnecessary another sensational and shat-
tering updating of American intelligence. 
Walter F. Mondale: 
Like most Americans. I have strongly sup-
ported the necessity of our government's 
conducting intelligence activities. But after 
witnc.'ssing hundreds of hours of testimony 
befc.re the Senate Select Committee on In-
teliigence. I am also convinced that basic 
reform is necessary. 
The committee heard respected former of-
ficials of our nation talk about institutional-
izing an assassination capability in the CIA 
as though it were just another option. We 
studied how the United States has used brib-
ery, corruption, and violence in almost ev-
ery quarter of the globe, and saw how es-
pionage is aimed at our friends as well as at 
our foes. The committee reviewed how our 
academic institutions, press, and religious 
institutions have been exploited for clan-
destine purposes, despite the special place 
these institutions must have in our dem-
ocratic society. 
It is clear to me that we have paid an ex-
tremely high price for any resulting secret 
success. American covert intervention often 
undermined the very democratic institutions 
we sought to promote. Because of our clan-
destine activities, the United States is re-
grettably regarded less and less as an example 
of democracy to be admired and emulated. 
Almost anything bad that happens in this 
world is attributed to the CIA?including 
the murder of King Faisal. And at home, 
the confidence of Americans in their gov-
ernment is weakened when our leaders use

covert intelligence operations to mislead the 
public and short-circuit our democratic pro-
cess. I have come to believe that there must 
be some fundamental changes in America's 
intelligence activities or they will fundamen-
tally change America. 
The proposals of Pete i Szanton and Gra-
ham Allison in the spring issue of FOR-
EIGN POLICY go in the right direction. 
They improve upon similar recommenda-
tions I made last fall. I recognize the costs 
in such a reorganization. and George A. 
Carver. Jr.. in his comment on the Szanton-
Allison article, also in the spring issue, has 
pointed to certain aspects of them. But in-
sofar as substantive problems can be met by 
structural change in the executive branch. I 
believe that the gains would outweigh the 
costs. 
The problem, however, is deeper. 
As the committee took testimony day af-
ter day on assassination plots, my first im-
pression was that we were grappling with 
some of the darker forces of human nature: 
the undertaking of acts which would be un - 
thinkable if not done in secret: the enthtt ? 
siasm with which we emulated our enemy; 
how patriotism and loyalty could be per-
verted to the point of dishonoring the na-
tion: the spectacle of men of great respect 
offering explanations and excuses at the mar-
gin of credibility. 
My initial conclusion was that the an-
swer lay in better accountability?vigorous 
congressional oversight plus a system in 
which officials cannot hide responsibility for 
their actions. To this end, I have supported 
a new Senate oversight committee with the 
power to authorize all national intelligence 
budgets. 
But the problem, I am afraid, lies deeper 
still. It is not just a problem of means, it i? 
a question of ends. 
When America saw itself as primarily re-
sponsible for countering the Soviets and 
Communists throughout the world, our in-
telligence services responded. Since Vietnam,. 
I believe America's view of its responsibil-
ities has changed. However, there has been 
no redefinition of our rote in the world, nor 
of the policies to be served by our intelli-
gence activities. 
As a start, I would suggest the following: 
> Avoiding nuclear war is most important. 
It requires the best possible intelligence. The 
continuing suspicion and antagonism be-
tween the United States and the Soviet 
Union and the levels of nuclear weapons on 
each side, place a premium on the most ac-
curate assessment of Soviet military capa-
bilities and political intentions. Agreements 
to control nuclear and conventional arms 
need a strong intelligence base to ensure both 
sound agreements and compliance. To this 
end, I believe the Soviet Union and its allies 
must remain our Number One intelligence 
priority. 
> Containing Soviet adventurism is the re-
sponsibility of all free countries. Each na-
tion must look to its own resources first. If 
U.S. help is needed, covert action could 
prove vital. But, in general, I see little rea-
son why U.S. aid should go through covert 
intelligence channels. Except in extraordi-
nary circumstances, nations wishing Amer-
ican support should be prepared to admit it. 
The American people and the Congress must 
not be left in the dark about new commit-
ments. 
> Support for democracy. America remains 
the greatest friend of liberty in the world, 
if no longer the sole defender of every regime 
that calls itself anti-Communist. But help-
ing the shattered democratic parties of West-
ern Europe survive in the late 1940s is one 
thing, and seeking to overthrow a democrat-
ically elected government in Chile in the 
1970s is quite anothr. Moreover, despite 
possible short-term success, covert action can 
be the enemy of democracy. it often amounts 
to corruption and nothing is more destruc-
tive of a democratic political system than 
corruption, in particular from a foreign 
source. If American aid to democracy is es-
sential to offset Soviet subversion, we should 
find a way to do this openly. Perhaps our 
political parties can assume some of this re-
sponsibility, much as European Social Dem-
ocratic parties have in Portugal. 
> Meeting the problems of hunger and dep-
rivation and building a more equitable 
world economic system are urgent tasks un-
suited to clandestine activity. A foreign pol-
icy which relies heavily on covert interven-
tion and espionage will be self-defeating in 
this area, for it will cast doubt on the le-
gitimacy of our cooperation and assistance. 
> Clandestine activities may prove essential 
to protect and advance our national interests 
in certain critical situations, such as thwart-
ing terrorism, controlling narcotics, and 
bringing truth to nations blinded by censor-
ship. But it has been naive for us to think 
that we could change a country's history 
with a couple of lies, a few guns. or a packet 
of dollars. We have ignored the strength of 
nationalism and people's determination to 
shape their own destiny. The Marshall Plan 
and NATO. along with the underlying vital-
ity of the countries themselves, saved Europe 
from the Communists, not the CIA. The Al-
liance for Progress contained Castro in the 
early 1960s. not Operation MONGOOSE. In 
most cases. I believe- America can be more 
effective if we are direct about what we 
want. Diplomacy- and economic cooperation, 
backed by adequate military strength?these 
are the tools that America uses best to se-
cure its interests. 
I find myself in the unhappy position of 
not being able to take the stand that U.S. 
23 covert action should be banned. 'With the

world as it is. I am afraid we may some-
times need it. But it is clear we have under-
taken too much clandestine activity in the 
past. We need to control it through the 
kind of structural changes proposed by Szan-
ton and Allison and make it accountable 
through strong congressional oversight. But 
beyond this. I believe we need a new state-
ment of the role of clandestine activities in 
U.S. foreign policy. I hope that the next 
president of the United States speaks to the 
American people and the world as follows: 
It will be the policy of the United 
States to conduct its relations with other 
countries on a straightforward basis. We 
will deal with other governments in con-
fidence but not in stealth. \We will be 
plain and direct about our own interests 
and concerns and about what we expect 
from others. We reject a policy of covert 
intervention into the internal affairs of 
other nations. 
America will continue those intelli-
gence activities essential to its security and 
that of its friends and allies. We will do 
what we can to check Soviet adventurism 
and to promote democracy on an open 
basis, but these are first the responsibility 
of the countries concerned. Covert action 
will be reserved for extraordinary circum-
stances in which the security of jeopardy. 
The 
na-
tion or of its allies is in serious eopardy. 
The era of covert day-to-day manipu-
lation of media, people, and events by the 
United States has ended. American intel-
ligence activities will be restructured ac-
cordingly. 
Peter Szanton 
Graham Allison: 
Surely, William E. Colby is right in as-
serting that the fundamental lesson of the 
past year is that American intelligence must 
operate within our constitutional system. 
And equally clearly, Walter F. Mondale is 
right in arguing that the deepest problem of 
American intelligence is one of ends, not 
means: a problem to be solved not by tinker-
ing with the intelligence community but by 
rethinking and restating our values and ob-
jectives in the external world. 
But two aspects of these attractive and 
WASHINGTON POST 
21 MAY 1975 . 
large-minded concepts are troubling. One 
is that Colby, after a professional lifetime 
in the executive branch, asks Congress to 
rectify the constitutional balance, while 
Mondale, a leading figure in the Congress, 
looks principally to executive leadership for 
improvement. It is hard not to conclude that 
the country would be far better off ha'd 
Colby spent the last eight years in the Con-
gress while Mondale occupied the White 
House. The second is that while focusing on 
constitutional and high policy issues is help-
ful in clarifying the transcending problems, 
it also tends to foreclose attention to lesser 
but still quite important questions. 
This is the nation's first opportunity in 
a quarter-century to rethink what it wants 
? from intelligence and how to get it. Absent 
further scandals or disasters, it .will likely 
be the last such opportunity of this century. 
Once the constitutional balance has been 
struck, and once we have, stopped asking our 
intelligence agencies to perform unjustified 
or repugnant or useless acts abroad, there 
will still remain the problem of how to im-
prove the performance of these agencies at 
what has always been their major task: pro-
viding the U.S. government with early and 
authoritative understanding of developments 
abroad. In recent years, the community's 
analyses and assessments have proven high-
ly variable in quality and far from satisfy-
ing. Their too frequent misuse and nonuse 
by policy-makers is a closely related problem. 
The already receding opportunity for reform 
should be used to insure not only that the 
community operates within constitutional 
boundaries and in the service of a support-
able policy, but that it performs its hardest. 
least glamorous, and most important task 
to higher standards, and that the results are 
heard. Neither alertness in the Congress nor 
policy leadership in the 'White House, essen-
tial as both are, will solve those latter prob-
lems. Their solution will require far strong-
er incentives within the community to treat 
the work of analysis and assessment as par-
amount, and to enlarge the skills and pre-
serve the neutrality necessary for such work.. 
They will also require arrangements which 
more reliably confront decision-makers with 
the results. In short, organizational reform_

mon tanker truck into a modern Trojan, 
horse to infiltrate America's bi-
centennial celebration and Canada's 
Olympic games. Confidential law en-
forcement reports show many terror-
ists have now fixed on.these two events 
'at their next battleground. 
-.- The 'terrorists have transformed the 
tanker truck into a rolling headquar-
ters. On the outside, the truck looks 
perfectly normal. It even has spigots 
that can drip oil. But instead of petro-
)eum products, the tank holds a terror-
ist office, dormitory and arsenal. It can 
accommodate 15 to 20 raiders from the 
hellish side of politics. American agents 
know about this mobile terrorist com-
mand post, but they haven't caught up 
with it yet. . 
Modern terrorists come from all sides 
Of -the political spectrum, but they 
share the concept that their cause will 
profit from disruption, disorder and 
bloodshed Some are highly trained 
commandos, skilled in the nightmarish 
uses of our modern technology. The 
government reports warn ominously 
that terrorists might even use "nuclear 
materials" as radioactive poisons or to 
build bombs. 
The United States and Canada are 
working together to prevent the terror-
ists from spoiling the bicentennial and 
Olympic spectacles. Both the FBI and 
Royal Canadian Mounted Police are re-
doubling their efforts to stop the ter-
rorists before they strike. The Customs 
Services of both countries are watching 
for smuggled weapons. The State De-
partment has appointed a_"s2o_rdinato_r_ 
for combatting terrorism." An informal 
White House task force and the Cana-
' dian Ministry of External Affairs are 
also working on the counter-terrorist 
campaign. 
The classified working papers of the 
two governments read like grim text-
books on insurgency warfare. The offi-
cial documents show how the terrorists 
plan to follow classic' guerrilla warfare 
strategems, mixing with the local popu-
lace between hit-and-tun attacks. The 
terrorists also employ smuggling tech-
niques from the worldsii)fiRtestiationaL

crime and espionage to move their 
weapons across borders. 
The official reports discuss a variety 
of disguise-and.diversionary tactics 
that the terrorists are known to use. 
They convert the ordinary into a cam-
ouflaged 'weapon. For example, cam-
'era-laden tourists are a. standard sight 
at such events as bicentennial pageants, 
and Olympic games. But the official re-
ports warn some "tourists" may be dis-
guised terrorists,- and' their cameras 
may be deadly Weapons. - 
Lawmen have discovered, for exam-
'pie, that the new Polaroid cameras 
with large film padcs can conceal small 
pistols whose grips have been removed. 
The ordinary Kodak film box, one intel-
ligence report says, may be used by ter-
rorists to hide tiny lethal devices 
known as "Dutch mini-grenades." 
Government agents have also 
learned_ that terrorists may conceal 
small machineguns in attache cases. 
Trigger extensions protrude from the 
ease. What appears to be an ordinary 
briefcase _cap be held "under, the arm_

' to one document. 
Intelligence reports suggest that the 
terrorists are most likely to strike in Ju-
ly, the month that the bicentennial cel-
ebrations reach their climax and the 
Olympic games open. Enormous num-
bers of tourists are expected at these 
events. 
U.S. and Canadian customs officials 
have pinpointed, some of the terrorist 
organizations that are expected to 
cause trouble. The Japanese Red Army, 
as a prime example, is described in the 
confidential reports as a group of now 
more than 30 anarchists. Yet they suc-
ceeded in shocking the world by mas-
sacring 28 people at the Tel Aviv air-
port in 1972, hijacking a Japan Air 
Lines plane in 1973, bombing Shell Oil 
tanks in Singapore in 1974 and seizing 
the U.S. ethbassy in Kuala Lumpur in 
1975 
There is also the Fuerzas Armadas de 
Liberation Nacional Puertorriquena, 
which ostensibly seeks Puerto Rican in-
dependence from the United States.

this terrorist group blatantly claims 
credit for 10 U.S. bombings in October 
1975. The official reports warn this 
group may work with the Puerto Rican 
Socialist Party, controlled by Fidel Cas-
tto, to disrupt the bicentennial. . 
An anti-Castro terrorist group, .the 
Frente de Liberacion Nacional. de Cu-
ba, may "cause problems" at the Olym-
pics because of Cuba's participation in 
the games. This. group, according to the 
documents, "is known to possess a large 
amount of C-4explosives, which it may 
use against pro-Castro and Soviet tar-
gets." 
Perhaps the strangest group of ter-
rorists, identified as a bicentennial and 
Olympic threat, is the "Rastafarian 
Movement." The intelligence data say 
the group is also known as "the Niya-
bingi Order, the Miyamen, the Beards-
men, the LoCksmen, the Rude Boys and 
the Dreads." , 
The Rastafarians, one of the oldest of 
-- the terrorist groups, is an all-black cult 
? originating in Jamaica in 1930. They be-
-. lieve "that the past Emperor of Ethio-
pia, Haile Selassie, was the living God 
. . . and that the ways of the white 
man are evil." 
The documents say that the Rasta-
farians advocate the liberal use of mari-
juana and have been associated increas-
ingly with violent rebellion and terror-
ism. In New York City alone, they have 
an estimated 3,000 members of varying 
levels of activity. 
Law enforcement agencies on both 
sides of the border are beefing up,their 
anti-terrorist campaign. But the key to 
defeating the terrorists lies with the 
populace. Terrorists need confusion, 
chaos and a submissive populace to op-, 
erate successfully in any country. They 
describe themselves as the "fish" who 
will hide this summer in the sea of tour-
ists. 
If the people of the United States and 
Canada deny the terrorists the strate-
gic hospitality they need, the fanatics 
among us will have more trouble and 
less success.

Soviet Milibry Spending Up 5 or 
By Henry S. Bradsher 
Washington Star Staff Writer 
Soviet military spending has been 
rising for the past three years at an 
annual rate of 5 or 6 percent, the CIA 
says in a new study that predicts con-
tinued but perhaps slower long-term 
growth. 
In what- it called "a major revision 
of past estimates," the agency raised 
its calculations of military spending 
6%, CIA  Esti ates-
_ - 
from 6-or 8 percent of the Soviet -iwo-thirds larger than the Soviet . 
gross national product to between 11GNP. 
and 13 percent since 1970. In the corn- ' A 17-page CIA study, which was 
ing fiscal year the United States circulated on Capitol Hill yesterday, 
plans to spend on defense slightly said about 90 percent of the increase 
under 6 percent of a GNP roughly - ?

In its- estimates came from "changes 
in- our understanding of ruble prices 
and costs," and the rest from- broad-
er information on. Soviet armed 
forces. The estimate of Soviet mili-
tary spending last year-was approxi-
mately doubled, the study said. _ 
TRE REVISION "does not affect 
:OUP appraisal of the size or capabil-
ities of Soviet military forces," the 
Study pointed out. Nor does it change 
, earlier estimates that Soviet military 
spending in 1975 was about 40 percent' 
more than American, when calculat-
ed in dollars, 
But it does show Kremlin leaders 
more Willing to-give their armed 
, forces priority over consumers than 
previously realized,, the CIA said. It 
did not attempt to. judge foreign poli-
cy attitudes which lay behind-this.. 
The study emphasized the tenta-
tive nature of the-conclusions drawn - 
from "a major reassessment . . . 
undertaken in the face of an unusual-
ly large body of new information." 
The estimates have "a margin of 
uncertainty, which for some items 
could be substantial." 
This uncertainty seemed certain to .! 
provide the basis of continuing dis-
pute among various intelligence 
analysts and on Capitol Hill over the ? 
size and significance of the Soviet 
military effort. 
THE NEW information has been " 
available for a year. Pentagon 
analysts, who have long contended 
that the CIA was pegging the Soviet 
mijitary effort-too low, have argued 
for the agency to admit it has been 
wrong for years. But now the way the 
data is used could provide the basis 
for further argument._ . a

Former Defense Secretary. James,

said that on the basis, of the new

when Schlesinger was fired by Presi-

figure at 15 to 20 percent. 
Commenting on the new CIA study,

Atomic Fuel 
In Taiwan 
-Not Inspected 
By Don Oberdorfer 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
International Atomic En-
ergy Agency inspectors 
checking Taiwan's research 
reactor early this year failed, 
to inspect- 10 fuel rods con-
taining a total of one-half ki-
logram of plutonium, ac-
cording to-a report that has 
caused concern among gov-
ernments acquainted with 
the case. 
U.S. experts said this 
amount of plutonium would 
not be enough to make an 
explosive device, though it - 
would be enough to provide 
some laboratory experience 
in handling sensitive materi-
als that, in larger amounts, 
could be used for bomb-mak-
ing. 
American officials famil-
iar with the incident said 
the Nationalist Chinese in 
charge of the reactor report-
edly told the IAEA inspec-
tors that the fuel rods had 
been taken to another loca-
nd 1972. But new weapons, especial-

in some nuclear operations, 
the governments hearing 
the report were surprised?
and concerned?that the in-
spectors evidently did not 
insist on going to the other 
site to inspect the fuel rods. 
David Fischer, assistant 
? director for external rela-
tions of the Vienna-based in-
ternational inspection 
agency, said the January in-
spectors' report from Tai-
wan showed "no significant 
amount of material unac-
counted for" and "no reason 
to suppose any kind of irreg-
ularity." 
Fischer said it is his un-
derstanding that inspectors 
would not normally see ev-
ery fuel element during 
their semi-annual inspec-
tions. Such a physical inven-
tory of all materials is re-
quired less frequently, he 
said. 
The Taiwan Research Re-
actor, which was supplied by 
Canada, is similar to a Cana-
dian-supplied reactor uti- ?

clear explosive device. The 
Indians secretly built a re-

over the five years of 4 to S. percent. 
Procurement of those missiles 
probably has peaked and the annual 
rate of growth will taper off until the 
next generation, the study added. 
Pentagon officials have reported that

In recent weeks there has been evi-

since the death last month of the!

Andrei A. Grechko, and his replace-. 
ment with a military production ex-
pert rather than another soldier... 
U.S. officials said they are 
confident Taiwan possesses 
no such reprocessing opera-
tion. They said that the 
United States is concerned 
about the case of the unin-
spected fuel rods primarily 
because it seems to demon-
strate inadequate procedures 
and a lack of zeal on the 
part of the international in-
spectors. 
Nuclear material and fa-
cilities supplied by the 
United States and most 
other advanced countries 
are sold on condition that 
they be used only for au-
thorized purposes and that 
they be subject to periodic 
on-site inspection by teams 
of the Vienna-based interna-
tional agency. 
' The IAEA has been 
sharply criticized in some 
quarters for having only 60 
Inspectors to police more 
than 300 nuclear facilities 
around the world. Congress 
has added $5 million for 
IAEA to a pending military 
assistance bill in 'an effort to 
improve the inspections. 
Nationalist Chinese Pre-
mier Chiang Ching-kuo said 
last September that "we ad-
mit we have the ability and 
the facilities to manufacture 
nuclear weapons, but - we 
will never manufacture 
them." 
Taiwan has formally 
agreed not to make an at-
omic bomb by ratifying the 
nonproliferation treaty. 
Taiwan is in the early 
stages of a multibillion-dol-
lar nuclear power program 
that seeks to generate 
nearly half of the island's 
power needs through nu-
- clear power plants by 1985: 
The United States is selling 
Taiwan the nuclear fuel and 
most of the reactors and 
other necessary equipment. 
American experts pointed 
out the extensive Taiwan 
nuclear power investment is 
in a sense a hostage against 
weapons production. This is 
because the United States 
has the ability to shut, off 
the required flow of ura-
nium fuel if there is evi-
dence that Taiwan is cheat-
ing -on its international com-
mitments. 
The United States did not 
stop shipments of ? essential 
nuclear fuel to India after 
that country's atomic explo-
sion. The Nuclear Regula-
tory Commission is holding 
hearings to determine 
whether the fuel shipments

Opium Poppy Fields Said Destroyed

destroyed by an intensified

The announcement was 
made jointly here by Attor-

and Mexican Attorney Gen-
eral Pedro Ojeda-Paullada. 
They said that the eradica-
tion campaign can be ex-
pected,to reduce the availa-
bility of Mexican heroin in 
the United States by late 
this year. 
Their statements were 
made in an atmosphere of 
cordiality. But , they came 
against a liackground of re-
ports that efforts to stem 
the cross-border drug traffic 
may be endangered by crow-
ing rancor between narcot-
ics agencies of the two coun-
tries. 
Washington Post 'ibecial

Officials at DEA said that 
no one can estimate with '7

amount of hei-oin coming 
into the country annually. , 
Their belief that from 85 to

NEW YORK TIMES 
2 7 MAY 1976 
By BERNARD GWERTZMAN 
Special to The New York Times 
WASHINGTON, May 26?The? 
State Department has apparent-
ly given the A.F.L.-C.I.O. the 
right to veto all applications by 
Soviet and other Communist 
trade union leaders to enter this 
country. 
This practice, reportedly of 
long standing, was acknowl-
edged today by the State De-
partment after a Soviet news-
paper complained that the 
United States was not living 
up to the Helsinki agree-
ment's call for wider East-West 
exchanges. 
? The paper charged that four 
Soviet trade unionists were 
barred from accepting an invi-
tation from San Francisco Bay 
unionists to visit this month?
in reciprocity for trips by the 
Americans to the Soviet Union 
in 1973 and 1974. 
In confirming that the visa 
applications had been denied, 
the department conceded in 
effect that A.F.L.-C.I.O. national: 
leaders were given an unofficial 
veto authority. 
It has long been assumed 
in Washington that George 
Meany, president of the A.F.L.- 
The phOtOs showed mod-
ern mortars, Browning auto-
matic rifles, -grenade launch-
ers, light , machine guns, 
rockets an bandoliers of 
ammunition. 
Next .to the arsenal were , 
large quantities of either 
and drums of other chemi-? 
cals, beaters, basins, buckets 
and other equipment used 
to convert raw opium into 
refined heroin. 
The raid, which' was car, 
ried out ..with the assistance. 
of the U.'.-donated ? helicop, - 
lers, netted 30 pounds of,: 
heroin -and 288 pounds of 
raw opium, said Kyaw MM. 
Government officials said 
233 rebels,were manning the, 
camp. Two soldiers: and nine 
insurgents were reported 
killed. 
U.S. sources like to stress 
that the' United States pro-
s-ides no assistance or advice 
to the Burmese: "The heli-
copters represent our only 
form of aid to this govern-
ment," one - source said. 
"They maintain and fly 
them themselves." 
The helicopters, based at 
Meiktila, 90 miles south of 
Mandalay, have also been 
used heavily against opium 
poppy farmers,. members of 
minority groups who are not 
directly active in the insur-
gencies. So far this year, ac-
cording to 'US. sourCeS, hell: 
copter-borne troops have de-
stroyed 17.000 acres -of. the 
70.000 acres used to grow 
poppies in i3urina. ' 
By contrast, the United 
Stites hopes to help the gov-
ernment of Mexico wipe out 
,just ,10,000 acres of poppy 
fields in all of .1976. Mexico 
is the major source of illicit 
.- drugs entering the United 
States. 
Burma's policy, unlike 
that of neighboring Thai-
land, is to destroy the poppy 
tields first and, -iyurry' about, 
providing farmers with a 
substitute crop later. The 
system is quick, but it in 
:creases minority groups' ha-
tred of the central govern-
ment. 
The United Nations is ex-
pected to begin a 46 million 
crop substitution program in 
" Burma soon. A smaller but 
similar program in Thailand 
has so far produced limited 
results. 
The U.S. interest, accord-
ing to an American source 
in Rangoon, is limited to 
helping the Burmese gov-
ernment stem the flow of 
heroin out of Burma, 
through Thailand, and into 
the United States, where it 
comprises between 10 and 20 
Per cent of annual consump-
tion. 
According to an informed 
source in Mandalay, a pleas-
ant, sleepy city of half a mil-
lion on the Irrawaddy River, 
the local addiction problem 
is "serious and growing ? 
quickly." No figures are 
'available, the 'source said,. 
I but a drug treatment center. 
has been established at a 
local hospital. 
In the capital, Rangoon', 
with its population of 2 Mil-
lion, official figures show 
thit, as of last year there 
were 994 registered addicts, 
with 12,134 in all of Burma. 
Total population is 31 mil- ? 
Hon. 
An article in the Rangoon 
Working People's' Daily said 
an official survey revealed 
that of those registered for 
treatment, "the majority of ' 
the addicts are the children : 
of affluent people such as ! 
merchants and traders."' 
. "This is nonsense, ex-
claimed U Ba Gyaw, head of , 
-the government's news and 
periodical corporation.. "We ? 
have no real problem. There 
may be a few' youngsters 
who .Smoke marijuana or 
use heroin- once or twice, 
, just for a kick, but addiction 
is small-scale indeed." 
But a Rangoon attorney 
said that ? based on his dis-
cussions with government 
doctors and the number of 
drug-related eases he has 
handled, "I wouldn't be sur-
prised if the addiction fig-
ures were 18 to 20, times 
higher than the official sta-
tistics." 
Although U.S. -officials 
profess to be "reasonably 
optimistic" about Burma's 
chances of reducing its drug 
output, the, odds' on elimi-
nating the traffic are virtu-
ally nil. As one U.S. source 
put it, "As long as a kilo of 
heroin can be bought. for 
$325 in northeastern Burma 
and sold on the streets of 
New York for a quarter of a 
million, there's no way 
they're going to dry it up." 
C.I.O., and his fiercely anti-
Communist executive council 
had influence in denying Com-
munist entry visas, but this 
was the first time the State 
Department had publicly ac-
knowledged this practice, which 
apparently goes back at least 
to the 1950's when the cultural-
exchange program began. 
Visa Rejection Confirmed 
Frederick Z. 'Brown, the de-
partment spokesman, confirmed 
that the four visa applications 
had been rejected. 
"In handling the visa applica-
tions, we gave due weight to 
the view of the mainstream of 
organized labor in the United 
States," Mr. Brown said. "The, 
national A.F.L.-C.I.O. is firmly 
opposed to labor exchanges 
with Communist labor officials 
on the grounds that such ex-
changes would equate our free 
trade unions with Government-
controlled trade unions." 
Later, in answer to further 
questions, the department said 
that it had never given permis-
sion to any Soviet or other 
Communist trade union official 
to visit this country in that 
capacity, although some such 
officials many have come as 
tourists or in other guises.

'SALT 'Violations': . 
For . more than a year conservative critics of the 
Strategic arms limitations talks (SALT II) with .MOscow 
have sought to discourage agreement by charging that 
the Soviets had been violating the 1972 SALT I treaty 
in order to gain military advantage over the United 
States. These charges have -been rejected not Only by 
President Ford and Secretary of .State Kissinger, but by ' 
former Defense Secretary James SChlesinger.-
The disclosure,that Moscow. now, has achnowledged, a 
'violation does not alter, that picture. The violation, which 
....occurred in March, was a technical one. Moscow had

ti;Intal to The New York Times 
UNITED NATIONS, N.Y., May 
29?Daniel P. Moynihan, for-
mer United States represntative 
at the United Nations, says he 
was aware his term here last 
fall that vote on critical Gener-
al Assembly resolutions were 
bought and sold by diplomats. 
? There were not many cases, 
perhaps only a half-dozen in-
stances, but in one a vote went 
for as little as $600," Mr. Moy-
nihan said in a telephone inter-
view. 
; It -should not be too surpris-
ing that such sales go on he 
said, considering the high cost 
of living in New York for dele-
gations from poorer countries, 
and especially for delegates be-
low the rank of ambassador, 
who cannot get?by on their sa-
laries. "There was a lot of loose 
money around and an influx of 
small, impoverished countries 
to UN. membersip at about the 
same time," he said. 
Mr. Moynihan declined to 
identify those involved by 
name or by country. 
Other Inducements Cited 
According to delegates, there 
are few cases of money's ac-
tually changing hands. There 
was no suggestion that votes 
had been bought by any major 
, power such as the United 
States or the Soviet Union. 
"When the larger countries go 
after support, there are other 
wan of doing it such as an 
offer of a loan or profitable 
trade agreement," one diplomat 
remarked. 
Another delegate said 'there 
were more subtle, ways of ob-
taining supporting votes than 
bribery. One of the most com-
mon is to invite the leader of 
a small country for a state visit 
during which a friendship pact 
is approved and an offer of 
techqical assistance may be 
thrown in. 
Mr. Moynihan said he did not s 
find it shocking that countries P 
. . 
Ihavi that 21 tons of heaVy 
water supplied by ,the 
United States was used by 
India -in- nuclear reactors 
supplied by Canada to pro-
duce plutonium,' "which is 
atom bomb material," Ribi-
coff said. 
"The' United States has 
never publicly aciniowl= 
edged exporting heavy 
water to India," he said. 
"Instead, U.S. officials said 
only that Canada supplied 
the research reactor used by 
India to produce the pluto-
nium for its explosion." 
engage in bargaining and saw 
not much difference in whether 
votes went for cash or wheat. 
"All countries sell their votes 
in one way or the other," he 
commented. "I don't find it sur-
prising or shocking what coun-
tries do to maximize their in-
terests." 
The former United States de-
legate made a similar statement 
about bribery in an interview 
!with CBS News when he was 
asked whether votes were 
bought at the United Nations. 
' a number of other delegates 
I said they were certain that 
vateshad been sold-for thou-
sands of dollars on some criti-
cal' issues. . 
Two diplomats from widely' 
different regions and political 
groupings, who asked not to be. 
identified, gave ;Millar accounts 
of one attempted transaction: 
A delegate from one of the 
poorest 'countries was said to 
have been approached and 
handed an envelope by a North 
Korean representative with an 
urgent request that he pay 
careful- attention to its con-
tents. This occurred at a time 
when both North Korea and 
South Korea, which are not 
members but have observer sta-
tus, were pressing General As-
sembly members to vote for ri-
val resolutions on the situation 
in Korea. 
When he opened the enve-
lope, the delegatefound that iti 
contained not only propagand 
material but also $3,000 in $100! 
bills. The diplomat involved' 
could not be reached for com-
ment, but the two others ac-
quainted with the affair said 
they were certain that the mo-
ney had been returned. , 
A North Korean spokesman 
at the United- Nations, when 
asked about the report, said the 
accounts were absolutely 
untrue. 
CBS News 'said in a broadcast' 
Friday night that diplomats at' 
the United Nations had offered 
$1,000, an an Argentine diplo-
mat and an envelope full of mo-
ney to an Arab diplomat, but 
that the money had been re-
fused in both cases. A spokes-
man for the North Korean ob-
erver termed the reports corn-
letely false.

DAILY TELEGRAPH, London 
aLy_ .,F7 6  
How smack of soft Government and 
tactics- make a mockery of scifeguar 
Foreign eyes 
in Britain" 
RUSSIAN plans to build a 
huge new embassy com-
plex in the leafy " IVAllion-
aire's Row," Kensington?
London's' biggest property 
development since the war 
?seem likely to bring sub-
stantial increases in the 
small army cf 'men from 
Moscow already based here. 
It takes a minimum of eigh-
teen trained men to Mount a 
full scale watch on a suspec-
ted- spy and it is with that 
and other figures in mind that 
the men responsible for Bri-
tain's security are looking at 
the project. 
Strict control on the numbers 
of Russian diplomats has been 
maintained since Lord Home's 
expulsion of 105 of them in 1971. 
Nevertheless many Conserv-
ative M.P.'s fear that with the 
Russian plans for expansion and 
present efforts to push trade 
between the countries. Whitehall' 
may have' to consider easing 
restrictions on the envoys and 
commercial officers. 
This concern is growing 
after the Foreign Office decision 
not to expel two bungling Hun-
garian spies who were caught 
photographing the atomic wea-
pons ? establishment at Burgh-
field, Berkshire, two weeks ago 
This lenient approach is not 
uncommon now when dealing 
with Russian and, Czech diplo-
mats involved in spying opera-
tions. 
Russia now has 354 men 
posted to Britain compared with 
550 before the 1971 expulsions. 
There are 87 diplomats and offi-
cials at the Embassy; 56 in the 
Soviet Trade.' Delegation; 102 
with quasi-official agencies; 71 
factory inspectors; 15 officials of 
international organisations and 
23 journalists. In addition there 
are some 500 diplomats and offi-
dais representing Communist 
satellite countries whose secu-
rity agencies are directly con-
trolled by the K.G.B. 
After Lord Home dealt so 
forthrightly with the 105, who 
were not mere names picked out 
of the hat but were proven 
spies, the Russians in their con-
stant efforts to rebuild their 
organisation turned to their 
Eastern European satellites and 
the Cubans to cany out missions 
for the voraciously inquisitive 
K.G.B. and its supporting mili-
tary and political intelligence 
organisations. .

improvised Russian spy  
ds 
By NORMAN KIRKHAM, 
Military attaches have always 
been regarded as legalised spies 
and Lt. Col. Lajos Hajma and 
Captain Andras Toth of the 
Hungarian embassy were merely 
carrying out a mission which 
British military attach?might 
well attempt to carry out in 
Hungary. 
Russian representatives cannot 
travel more than 35 miles from 
the centre of London?a piece of 
tit-for-tat because of the restric-
tions imposed on Britain's 82 
diplomats and officials serving 
in Moscow. But these restraints 
do not apply to the Iron Curtain 
diplomats or the Cubans whose 
D.G.I. espionage setup is con-
trolled from the Kremlin. 
_ TOM DAVIES 
and the Close-Up team 
It is because of this Commun-
ist evasion, of the restrictions 
which are strictly applied to , 
Western .,diplomats in Russia_ 
that Lord lipmc told us: "It is 
a false calculation that if you 
catch- spies on the job you will 
Impress' the Russians and their 
satellites by dealing with them 
leniently. These men should 
have been sent packing at once. 
"I-have no doubt that detente - 
or not, the Russians and East I 
Europeans will go on with intel-
ligence operations here. We must 
not relax our guard. The leopard 
does not change its spots." 
But it is the cost and com-
plexity of maintaining that 
guard which is making life so 
difficult for our spy catchers. In 
Moscow the British Embassy uses 
Russian chauffeurs and handy-
men, but they bring their own 
doormen and chauffeurs to Bri-
tain and it has long been a rule 
of counter-espionage that the 
most important man in a Soviet 
Embassy is usually not the Am-
bassador but is the K.G.B. chief 
who could be anything from 
First Secretary to one of those 
lowly chauffeurs. 
There are other types of spy 
as well. Espionage these days 
is not confined to military affairs; 
industrial espionage and agents 
of influence are just as 
important. 
Mr. Cranley Onslow, Tory 
M.P. for Woking, is particularly 
concerned abobt the activities of 
the 71 Russian industrial inspec-
tors who have privileged access 
to many sensitive aspects of 
British goods, systems and 
are sent over when a deal is 
concluded to supply Russia with 
British goods, systesm and 
machine tools. Their ostensible 
function is to train in the use 
of equipment and to keep quality 
controls on goods. They some-
times live in industrial towns 
with daily access to the factories 
over periods of some months. 
Britain exported 010 million 
worth of machinery, transport 
equipment, textiles and other 
goods in 1975 and there are firm 
promises that trade between Bri-
tain and Russia will move for-
ward dramatically in the next 
? few years. This means that 
inevitably there will be yet more 
factory inspectors coming to live 
and work here.. 
They are already in position in 
every aspect of British industry. 
They are at Vickers, which 
makes tanks and warships, they. 
are at the Swan Hunter ship-
building firm, they are at the 
John Brawn Engineering works, 
they are at precision machine 
tool companies, computer labora-
tories and chemical works. 
The companies involved are 
obviously aware of the dangers 
involved in their presence and 
take care to keep them away 
from secret areas, but as anyone 
who has worked in a large con-
cern knows, it is only too easy 
for an inquiring mind to collect 
details of military, and industrial 
processes. 
Another equally important 
aspect of the modern spies' work 
is to act ,as an 'agent of influence 
a man ,Nho can drop into the pub 
for a pint and then not only 
report back what his workmates' 
attitudes are but can attempt 
both 'political and cultural sub-
version. It is this aspect of an 
agent's work which the West 
finds so- difficult to Carry out in 
Moscow because of the barriers 
interposed between Western 
representatives and the Russian 
people. . 
An analysis of the Institute 
for the Study of Conflict points 
out that Soviet intelligence acti-
vities are continually increasing. 
This fact emerged :from an exam-
ination of the growth of official, 
Soviet representation in Western 
Europe. It has doubled since the 
early Sixties to well over 2.000 
throughout Europe and that does 
not include the satellites. 
Professor Leonard Shapiro, 
Chairman of the Institute's COun-
cil told us: "We have estimated 
that around half of those accre-
dited as diplomats to N.A.TO. 
countries are usually engaged in 
intelligence operations of one 
kind or another. 
"Russia's policy of detente 
has, in fact increased, for the 
Kremlin, the importance of sub-
version in the West. Apart 
from industrial and military spy-
ing, the aim is to spread propa-
ganda and sow disinformation. 
They are out to create a favour-
able climate of opinion." 
Apart from the problem cre-
ated by the sheer number and 
industry of the Russian agents 
legally operating in this country, 
our counter-espionage teams 
have the problem of the divided 
opinion which exists in the 
? F-dreign Office about' what to do 
with spies when they are caught. 
There were many senior men 
in the F.0'. who were horrified 
when Lord Home brought off his 
mass expulsion and for a long 
time before that they had 
carried out a softly-softly policy. 
This policy was in accord with 
' Sir Harold Wilson's own policy 
of pursuing detente with Russia 
during his early years in office 
before detente became 
fashionable. 
This was a situation which 
infuriated our hard-worked spy-
catchers who more than once 
caught Russian spies red-handed 
and were forced to let them go 
in the interests of higher policy. 
They were especially furious 
when we gave back the Krogers, 
the expert man and wife spy 
team, in exchange for Gerald 
Brook who had got himself 
jailed for acting as an agent 
of an anti-communist emigre 
organisation. 
The Russians brutally mis-
treated Brook to force us to 
give up the Krogers. We did so. 
It may have been the correct 
decision on humanitarian 
grounds. But it did no good to 
our counter-espionage agents 
who saw two of their prize 
catches being given back. 
It was the softly-softly pro-
tagonists who won again over 
the question of expelling the 
Hungarians?and were promptly 
rewarded by a diplomatic clout 
round the ear from the Hun-
garian government. 
There are in fact a number of 
intriguing aspects of this affair. 
The first is: what were they 
doing there in-the first place? 
For the Russians have an excel-
lent spy-satellite system and 
undoubtedly have fine quality 
pictures of every brick of the 
Burghfield establishment taken 
from their Cosmos satellites. 
I Is it then the people who 
work in the factory who interest 
the Hungarians and' not the 
bricks and mortar or the shape 
of the chimneys? 
Or is there a John Le 
Carre twist and did the Russians 
? send the Hungarians there 
: knowing that they would be 
Picked up?our own reporter 
was quickly questioned by a 
friendly but firm policeman last 
week?in order to hurt Anglo-
Hungarian relations which have 
been steadily improving in 
recent months? 
And if the British authorities 
really wanted to keep the affair 
quiet precisely not to disturb 
this new relationship how did 
the story get out? Was it a 
proud local man anxious to 
claim credit? Was it a dis-
gruntled spy-catcher trying to 
make sure that the Hungarians 
didn't get away with it? 
There are many juicy permu-
tations to delight Le Carre 
fans, but the reality is deadly 
serious: Britain is under con-
tinual attack by an army of 
Soviet agents, an army which, 
because of detente, is likely to 
grow rather than decrease, an 
army with a new headquarters 
planned ? surely with a con-
scious irony ? for Millionaires' 
Row.

By George W. Ball 
HAUNTING EUROPE today is a specter of .commun-
ism less ectoplasmic and more substantial than the 
one conjuredup in the Communist Manifesto of 1848. On 
June 20 and 21 the Italian people may cast such a large 
vote . for. the Communist:Tarty as to Provide it. with. a. 
dominant 
:dominant place In in Italian coalition government; two. 
years from now a left-of-Center: majority with a Com-
munist component- could force a cOnstitutionaL crisis in ; 
F? rance;: 
-Though the prospect 'disturbs the-chancellories of Eu-
rope, it upsets Washington even more, creating nervous 
palpitations in the White House and deepening Henry 
Iiissinger's Spenglerian gloom. If Communists were to , 
participate in Western governments, "there would," he 
told a meeting of. our ambassadors, "be a shocking 
change in the established.patterns of American policy." 
It would, he implied, mean the effective end of NATO 
and ? according to a. State Department spokesman ? 
require the United States to "reassess" its policies to-
ward Europe. 
In contrast to most Americans (and particularly to the 
secretary of state and his staff), many Europeans are in-
tellectually reconciled to the prospect of Communists in 
the Italian government. Their more relaxed view of the 
prospect reflects the fact that the Communist Party has 
been a familiar feature of the Italian political' scene for 
many years. 
What hai.made its entry into government an immi-
nent possibility is the coincidence of a number of fac-
tors. Most important, no doubt, are the economic reces-
? sion and inflation, aggravated by the quadrupling of oil 
p- rices which has borne heavily on a country with almost 
no indigenous energy. In addition ? for America is by 
no means without blame ? our efforts to milk the thea-
trical potential: of detex!e:. have helped give Western 
ommunista respectability and, led the Christian Demo-
crats to-be less fearful of a dialogue with the Commun-
ists. If the Presidentond. the secretary of state can hob-

Screens of thoworld, What is- wrong with Italy sharing 
governmental power with the Communist leader, Enrico 
Berlinguer, and his colleagues, who are, after all, good 
Italians and ? at least in Berlinguer's case ? of distin-
guished family? 
Such a conclusion would find little. support if, regard-
less of the Communists, the Italian political structure 
were not already near collapse from decay and corrup-
tion. To many Italians the Communists appear not as 
-conspirators seeking to seize control of the government, 
- but rather as the-only plausible alternative to the Chris-
tian Democrat. and 'a few small:parties that no longer 
seem capable of running the country. "If we?had.nOt al-

the 1950s and 1960s, the booming hid;

farms of the Italiaii boot. Torn fronithe?

;young, migrants beeame easy prey to a 
Communist Party that filled a vacuum. 
-Much.as ward bosses Assisted the green-
horns during the great waves of Ameri-
can immigration, the Communist Party 
provided a substitute for family and 
church, paternalistically helping work- ' 
ers find jobs and housing, organizing, 
festivals and arranging leisure activi-
ties and, at the same time, conducting 
an incessant indoctrination. As a result, 
in the last regional elections, the Com-
munists won 33.4 per cent of the vote, 
only 2 per cent less than the Christian" 
Democrats. 
Meanwhile, the' Church led the Chris-. 
tian Democrats into bitter and divisive 
controversies. Incited by the Vatican_ to.

dieval divorce laws in 1974; the Chris-

other disaster over a similar issue, that 
of abortion. 
-With \ the Church discredited as its 
central defining element, the Christian 
Democratic Party has largely lost its 
identity. In addition, through. years of 
indulgence in shabby politics, the party 
has spawned an overgrown bureauc-
racy quite incapable of collecting di?
rect taxes, administering anti-inflation 
measures or imposing industrial discip-
line on an anarchic labor force that is 
completely out of hand. The enfeebled 
Christian ,Democrats have had to rely 
on tacit Communist approval to stay in 
power, although the Communists them- . 
selves have been barred' from formal 
participation in government ever since 
1947. ? 
The "Historic Compromise"' 
THE COMMUNISTS have their own 
thoughts about participation in 
government. Even if a Communist-So-
cialist coalition had become mathemati-
eally feasible, the Communists would 
have resisted coalition with only a 
small' majority. Atavistically sensitive 
to Mussolini's destruction of the grow-
ing Communist Party in 1926 and the 
'recent experience of the Allende gov-
ernment. in Chile, Berlinguer and his 
colleagues fear that, without the ac-
quiescence of a large segment of the 
electorate, their assumption of author-
ity might trigger a right-wing reaction. 
To assure adequate support, and a 
sharing of the risks, Berlinguer has pro--

posed an all-embracing coalition gov-
ernment to *include not only Commun-
ists but Christian Democrats and Social-
ists, an initiative he has called the "his-
toric compromise." The concept is not 
new; it has been prevalent in Commun-
ist circles under different labels Mike 
the days of Palmiro Togliatti, the par-
ty's first post-war leader. But Berlin- * 
guer's personality has helped give the' 
proposal credibility. 
The scion of a Sardinian land-owning 
family, he is almost the antithesis of the 7 
archetypal Communist thug. Present-
ing himself as a patriotic Italian, he has 
professed 'acceptance of Italian partici-
pation bath in NATO and the Common 
Market for the time being. He has from 
time to time spread the message that la-
bor should work hard and has made 
the ultimate pledge to democratic prin-
ciples by announcing support for "al-
ternation," which means that, if voted 
out of office. the Communists would 
rr....n.it to the v.'11.1 ,-r.f parliament and 
the electorate and retire from power. 
Moreover, he has tried to. make clear 
that he would never, play the sedulous 
ape to the I.:carn out would conduct 
an Italian government in the interests 
of the Italian people. 
Though he has rejected Moscow's 
claim as world communism's 'leading 
center" and has repeatedly 'announced 
the independence of the Italian Com-
munist Party, pressures on him to pup-
port broad Soviet policies are obviously* 
great. Berlinguer himself has said that 
"there is no no-man's land in the great 
arena of the class struggle," and he has' 
added that, if it were not for "our un-
breakable ties of, solidarity with Soviet, 
Aussie, the other Socialist states and 
the whole revolutionary working class 
of the world . . . we should lose our 
Identity as a Communist Party." 
He and his colleagues have left little 
doubt that they would support the So-
viet proposal to trade off the liquida-
tion of the Warsaw Pact for the liquida-. 
tion of NATO. They would almost cer-
tainly oppose the continuing outlays 
necessary to maintain adequate NATO 
defenses and would make increasingly 
difficult the maintenance of American 
military bases and installations in Italy. 
(13,000 of our own fighting forces with 
45,000 civilians are now stationed 
there.) One need notunderline the re-
sultant impairment of effectiveness of 
the 6th Fleet in the Eastern Mediterra-
nean, where American interests are vi-
tally touched by the Arab-Israeli con-
flict and the troubles between Greece 
and Turkey. 
A further, but rather desperate, as-
sumption from which many Italians 
draw comfort is that, even if the Com-
munist Party should achieve a role in 
government, it would tffl be only a mi-
nority within a larger amalgam and, 
hence, could be kept in its place. But to 
argue, as some do, that Communist par-
ticipation holds no peril because Italian 
Communist voters are not "real Corn-
mutilate" quite misses the point. For the 
party's representatives in the,. goverf-
ment would not be a gross-section of 
the Communist electorate but discip-
lined professionals, rigidly committed 
to a party line and party, tactics. While 
the Communists might cultivate the ap-
pearance of responsible behavior for a 
period of time, the apparatchiks could 
well use that period in an effort to fur-
ther the spread of Communist control. 
But what of the widely held argu-. 
ment that the Communista are- needed 
to restore Italy's flagging economy? 
For a period they might, to be sure, try 
to arrange a respite from industrial. 
strife, since Berlinguer has himself sug-
gested the need "to combat attitudes 
that negate the human and social need 
to work" and to restore "the competi-
tivity" of Italian industry. This is be-
guiling stuff for some Italian industrial-
ists whose predecessors admired a man. 
who could make the trains run on time. 
Long-Term Goals 
v ET, EVEN though the Conunun-
A ists might make a show of reliabil-
ity for a brief period, that does not 
mean either that they could effectively 
control Italian workers over the long 
pull or that they would, be prepared to 
go very far down' that road. Italian la-
bor today is the most militant in Eu-
rope and within its ranks are strong 
extremist elements: 'Thus, if Commun-
ist leaders within the Italian govern-
ment acted to salvage the rapidly disin; 
tegrating Italian economy, it could well 
mean that, as the American journalist 
Claire Sterling has pointed out, Moscow 
itself might undertake to finance and 
ineite a more radical Communist fac-
tion, since it dares not, risk a Western 
Communist party moving towards 
"bourgeois collaborationism" for fear 
of 'creating' deep disquiet among the 
uneasy Communist regimes in* Eastern 
'Europe. . 
Still, even without the fear of their 
own left wing or of mischief from Mos-
cow, Berlinguer and his company 
would not play a role of moderation 
very long. They are by no means mere 
"agrarian reformers" and the party has 
made its long-term objectives clear. It is 
committed, according to the party 
weekly Rinaacita, to bring about a radi-
cal liquidation of the Christian Demo-
cratic power structure, impose "pene-
trating controls on the use of profits 
and investments" and employ a "new 
use of representative democracy" to 
bring about a "profound social trans-
formation" leading to a "new social hi-
erarchy" and the "hegemony_ of the 
working class." If retrograde groups. 
prove too "recalcitrant," Berlinguer 
has made clear that "we Communists 
will never be afraid to resort to the 
scalpel when needed." 
Thus, in spite -of all the fine talk of 
"the many roads to socialism" and of 
"humanist Marxism" ? which rejects 
the domination of the Party in favor of 
32 
"social self-aianagement" or "pluralist 
socialism" and would tolerate free de-
bate and 'free access to information ? 
there is no reason to think that the Ital-
ian COmmunist Party, once in power, 
would adopt such heresies. Berlinguer's 
professions of liberalism are clearly a 
tactic by. which power is to be gained; 
once it is achieved, they would be 
promptly jettisoned.' 
One has only to read the party's liter-
ature carefully to note that every 
_ 
avowal of democratic purity has been 
regularly countered. by a reassuring 
message to the faithful that interprets 
or qualifies what has been said' to bring 
it into accord with Leninist orthodoxy. 
All such statements must, therefore, be 
understood for what they are intended 
to achieve. They are tactical moves to 
advance a relentlessly pursued' objec-
tive; the dictatorship of the Italian state 
' by the party which, as in the Soviet Un-
ion and other Communist countries, is 
a totalitarian structure organized on. 
the principle of "democratic central-
ism." There is no room for dissent in 
party procedures, no tolerance of oppo-
sition -voices. Once the hierarchy has 
made a decision, further debate is 
ruled out and anyone who tries to or-
ganize a dissident faction risks expul-
sion. 
Nonetheless, public opinion is unpre-
dictable, whether in America or Italy, 
and it would be a mistake to take it for 
granted that the forthcoming elections 
will necessarily show an increase in the 
Communist vote or that Communist 
participation in government is inevita-
ble. Though some Italians may vote 
Communist in the conviction that the 
Communists are the wave of the future, 
some of my Italian friends who voted 
Communist in last June's regional elec-
tions will, so they tell me, "hold their 
noses and vote for the Christian Demo-
crats" when control of their country is 
at stake. 
It is, of course, possible that, if the 
Communists do pile up the largest vote, 
the Christian Democratic Party might 
split, with the party's left wing agree-
ing to join the Communists and most of 
the Socialists and Social Democrats in a 
watered-down version of the "historic 
compromise." If, on the other hand, the 
Communist vote should be less than ex-
pected, Berlinguer might prefer to stay 
out of the government, continuing to 
exercise a veto by private treaty with 
the Christian Democrats. 
In a situation with so many varia-
bles, American policy should be subtle, 
flexible and realistic. Instead, our ap-
proach to the problem so far has been 
distressingly haphazard. To be sure, the 
secretary of state has announced that 
we would regard the entry of Commun-
ists into the Italian government as "un-
acceptable," but that sounds as though* 
America were Queen Victoria rebuking 
the lower classes. To reject as "unac-
ceptable" an event we can only margin-

Talliaffect is -a kind of diploniacy of the 
absurd we have tended to practice all 
-too'frequently in recent months. 
Nor was Kissinger any, better advised 
? when he said ominously; "If Commun-
ists should 'enter European govern-
ments, the political 'solidarity of the 
.West, and thus NATO, would he Inevit-
ably weakened, if not underinined . . . 
And in this Country, the commitment 
, of the American- people to maintaiathe 
? balance of power in Europe'. . . would 
lack. the ? moral base on which it has 
stood for .30 years." , Earlier, in his. 
. speech to American, ambassadors, he-
had slated that "it is Inconceivable that . 
' the ..United States could maintain 
, ground forces In Europe if there is.mcv: ; 
jor Communist participation in West- ? 
. 'ern governments." .(-- - , ? 
Preiumably, Kissinger hoped that, by 
pointing to America's anxieties, he 
,would deter some Italians wha_might 
otherwise vote for the Communists, but ? 
on balance the effect of these messages 
was probably adverse. Some Europeans - 
have interpreted the secretary's state-
ments as further evidence of the unre-
liability of American, security commit- ? 
ments. Others resented them as an ef-
fort to meddle in European internal af-
fairs. 
To_Communist, leaders, Kissinger's 
Concern about the ?diiiiiiegration 
? NATO and the. _dimMished American 
role-in Europe could only be taken as a 
- spur to action, since the removal of the 
United States from Europe has long 
been a central" objective of .Kremlin 
strategy. Thus, by assuring the Com-
munists that their entry into European' 
? governments would do the trick, we 
showed them the way to their heart's 
desire. ? 
? However, though warnings based on 
threats to Europe's Security probably 
did. more harm than- good, the Italian 
people should still be put on notice that 
Communist entry into government 
would jeopardize their- economic well-
being. To be effective, such a warning 
should come -from Italy's European 
neighbors rather than , the United 
States, though it should be part of a co-
ordinated strategy. Unfortunately, the 
habit of coordination has largely atro-
phied during recent years of American 
unilateralism. And in this case ? ap-
parently with no transtAtlantic consult- . 
ation ? the secretary of state has by. 
his solemn finger-shaking elicited an 
angryriposte from German Chancellor 
Helmut Schmidt. Thus, instead of a Con-
certed strategy, as a'result of our go-it- ' 
alone policy we have produced bicker-
ing among Italy's friends that could t 
only encourage the Communists. . 
Today the member nations of the Eu-
ropean- EcOnomic Community are in a t 
position to send theirsiellow member, a 
Italy, a clear, forceful message. Al? c 
though the member states of the Corn- ? t 
munity cannot tell the Italian people 
how to cast their votes, they can, and C 
should, make clear what would happen s 
if the inclusion of Communists in the r 
government were to lead to anti-deni 
cratk political measures or to some-
. 
thing approaching' a centralized, regi-
mented economy. 
? After all, the treaty of Rome -explic 
itly states that the Community is dedi-
cated' to strengthening the ."safeguards 
? of ,.peace. and liberty" aiid-,the whole 
??:fiinction of. the Common Market as-
sumes the free _movement Of the fac-
tors of production. -, . -` 
. Action to head off a Communist take-
over should not, however, be confined 
tO 'threats of economic sanctions. 
Within the structure. of the Community
a complex network of relationships 
transcends national line& ? -relations 
among, members. of. different profes-
- slow; relations among political parties 
. and politicians, relations among scien-
tists, farmers and industralists. Now is 
the time for the Community to use its 
Influence and resources to help rebuild 
an effective counterforce to the Italian 
'Communists. 
Certainly, the Community'. has much 
to offer ? such as a more liberal treat-
ment of Italy's agricultural produCts, 
.development funds for the underdevel-
oped south and credits through the _ 
Community's newly developed special 
lending 'authority. But, most of , all, 
there must be an urgent dialogue be-
tween the center parties of the Com-
munity nations and the Christian Dem-
ocrats to provide advice and encour-
agement and help heal the parochial di-
visions that prevent common action.. ? 
The French and German govern-
ments showed their effectiveness 
within a European framework by bols-
tering Mario Soares and the Portuguese 
Socialists; now,, by Concerted action 
within the framework of the EEC, they 
might well slow the drift in Italy, par- ' 
ticulany if the effort took the form of 
affirmative help as well as negative 
threat ? 
This is dearly a case where America 
Should do everything possible to de-
velop a concerted strategy with its 
Western allies; while contenting itself, 
for once, with a silent supporting role. 
Clearly, the EEC has the capability of' 
reducing the level of economic activity` 
In Italy seriously by a whole range of 
devices ? from imposing restrictions 
on agricultural imports to stopping the 
flow of' regional assistance funds. As 
the ultimate sanction, the other mem-
bers could expel Italy from the Corn-
munity. 
The extent, if any, to which measures 
of this kind should be taken presents 
serious- philosophical and moral ques-
ions. Few would argue that the mere 
inclusion of Communists in the Italian 
oy_or_nment_ should, by itself, 
he occasion for economic actions 
gainst Italy, but the EEC member 
ountries should ,make it known that 
hey are holding a watching brief. If it 
hould once become clear that the 
ommunists were systematically de-
troying democratic institutions and 
egimenting the Italian economy in vio-

whether the EEC countries should pen-

destruction of democracy by the tradi-
tional nietliodslof communism ? sub-
version, intimidation and conspiracy. 
, The secretary of state made a tactical 
blunder ,when, without, consultation 
with our Principal allies.who are much 
closer to 'the situation than ,We, he an-
nounced that the entry of Communists 
into a European' :government &mid 
? jeopardize the Whole structure of At-
lantic"security arrangement. Hei also 
ignored both logic and experience 
when he contended that such an event 
? in one country will "be likely to pro-
duce a sequence of events in which 
,other Etiropean countries will also be 
-tempted to move in the same direc-
tion." 
No Dominoes 
HAT,.IN FACT, would happen-if 
? the Communists should join -an 
Italian coalition government? Even the 
- prospect of that event has already trig-
gered a mass capital flight; its actual oc-
'.curience would mean the exodus not 
only of Capital but of many of Italy's 
leading financial and industrial figures. 
Investment would dry up; multina-
tional 'companies Would try to extricate 
themselves from their Italian commit-
ments, even at the cost of closing plants 
and increasing unemployment. The 
Italian government would be forced to 
impose tight defensive controls. If the 
EEC were to? take no action under the , 
"mutual - help" provisions of the Rome 
Treaty,- and if the EEC nations, to-
gether with the United States, failed to 
support a rescue operation through the 
International Mbnetary Fund, Italy 
could quickly find herself in a severe 
financial panic, with mounting infla-
tion, labor strife and increased unem-
ployment. Faced with a financial panic, 
the Communists in government would 
almost certainly opt for repressive mea7 
sures, that would unequivocally disClose 
their antidemocratic instincts. 
Far from inducing other European 
states to follow Italy's lead, the result-
ing uproar might rather be expected to 
induce a sense of fear and revulsion. If 
. it were clear that Italy was on the way' 
to isolating itself from the rest of Eu-
rope, communism for other European 
countries could rapidly lose its appeal. 
Certainly, one might expect such a 
reaction in France, where the situation 
sharply differs from that of Italy. In 
France the economy is basically 
healthy; the government, while experi-
encing troubles, is still strongly in com-
mand, and the Communists are a mi-
nority of only one-fifth kept in check 
by a rapidly growing Socialist Party 
that commands 27 per cent of the vote 
and is strongly led by Francois Mitter-

nouncing his devotion to "pluralism," 
to "alternation" and to all the civil 
rights of a free society, he is. more a 
- comic figure than .a persuasive convert 
to democratic principles. 
Nor are events phased favorably for 
the French Commimists, since they will 
probably have no chance to join a 
French government 'prior to the parlia-
mentary elections of 1978. By then, 
with any luck, the French economy will

PARIS?The North Atlantic alliance,. 
whose ministers 'nave just l'i-isheci 
meeting in Oslo, is not only in a con-
dition of political anxiety but its milltary forces increasingly reflect the 
failure of any sensible arms standardi-
zation to evolve. As a result, the im-
pressive economic-industrial base and 
qualitative technological -advantages 
of ,the coalition over the Soviet-
dominated Warsaw Pact have to a 
d extent faded 
away. 
Becauae ;of nationalistic rivalries 
among the Western `allies, comp.etitiort

industries to seek. export markets 
causes needless overlain. And a fail-
ure by NATO itself. to ,agree on basic 
requirements for such things as air-
craft missions, antitanIZ and anti-
aircraft defense, needs, leaves the 
alliance with a costly hodgepOdge of 
far too many types of equipment. 
The political Will needed 'to harmo 
nize this situation is latking: Yet 
almost every partner agrees that hunk 
dreds of millions" of dollars could be. 
saved with proper .rationalization of 
the Atlantic arms industries and that 
more and better equipment could thus 
. be made available for less money., 
A comprehensive draft study of this 
situation has been prepared for the 
Atlantic Institute by Dr. :Gardiner 
Tucker, former Assistant Secretary 
:General of- NATO. In the .study's pre-
liminary version, Dr: Tucker deplores 
"extreme duplication of effort with 
different countries performing similar 
research, carrying out parallel devel-
opments of, essentially equivalent 
weapon systems." 
The resulting waste -of. resources, 
he says,. has allowed the Soviet bloc 
to close the qualitative, gap' in many 
weapons and. pull ahead of the West 
in others. Moreover, 'proliferatiOn has 
seriously degraded the capability of 
our forces to operate together or to - 
supply one another." ? 
As examples of this he cites: (1) 
31 different types of antitank weapons 
well contrived the pretense of an invi-
tation by some dissident group ? the 
'possibility of a dominant Kremlin influ-
ence in Yugoslav- affairs is a haunting 
nightmare for the West. Given the geo-
graphic factor, Yugoslavia's continued 
independence of the Kremlin is of par-
ticular concern to all Italians ? Com-' 
munist and non-Communist alike. 
It is well that Kissinger has taken 
note of -this possibility and warned the 
Soviets that America would regard any 
interference in Yugoslavia with great 
concern. But here again a strong case 
could be made for a concerted warning 
to be given through NATO itself. For, 
though technically' outside the NATO 
defense area, a Yugoslavia independent 
of the Kremlin is a significant factor in 
the European power balance. It is one 
the West dare not neglect.

?MESE POLlTiCS 
AND A\11-4,RIC4:\ POLICY: 
A NEW LOOK 
AT THE TRIANGLE 
by Roger Glenn Brown 
The triangular relationship between the 
United States, the Soviet Union, and China 
remains at the very heart of the foreign pot--
icy calculations of each country. But at least 
in the case of China, according to the fol-
lowing article, that relationship also plays a 
critical role in the internal power struggle. 
The author, a senior analyst at the CIA 
who is presenting his own views and not an 
official position of his organization, traces 
the complex interrelationship between do-
mestic politics and foreign policy in the 
formative period between 1968 and 1972 
when the contours of the Sino-Soviet-U.S. 
triangle began to emerge. His analysis focus-
es on two major turning points which are 
still only dimly understood: the 1969 bor-
der crisis with the Soviet Union, and the fall 
of Defense Minister Lin Piao and most of 
China's top military leaders in 1971. He 
uses the insight gained to offer perspective 
on the unexpected eclipse of Teng Hsiao-
ping earlier this year and to forecast in gen-
eral terms the direction China's foreign pol-
icy will now take. 
The author's conclusions carry major im-
plications for American foreign policy. They 
suggest that our present relationship with 
Peking may not be stable enough to survive 
the intensified power struggle which is like-
ly to follow Mao's death. Time becomes 
more important, and hard chokes on the 
status of Taiwan and relations with the So-
viet Union become more urgent. Even if 
this presidential election year sees no move-
ment in Sino-U.S. relations, 1977 is almost 
certain to become a year of decision. ?The 
Editors. 
On March 2. 1969 an unusual incident 
occurred on the frozen Ussuri river near the 
desolate island which the Chinese call Chen-
pao and the Soviets call Damansky. On nu-
merous occasions since the early 1960s. there 
had been periodic nonshooting skirmishes 
in this and other areas along the disputed 
40 
Sino-Soviet border. On March 2, 1969, for 
the first time, Chinese soldiers opened fire 
on a Soviet patrol, killing 7 soldiers and 
wounding 23. On March 15, the Soviets 
retaliated with a full-scale military engage-
ment in the same area during which hun-
dreds of troops on both sides were killed 
and injured. Following these conventional 
military exchanges, Soviet spokesmen hint-
ed in a number of forums that a nuclear at-
tack on China might become necessary. By 
August 1969, the situation had deteriorated 
so badly that some Western observers were 
convinced that war was inevitable in the 
near term. In short, the events of 1969 
marked the most serious crisis in the entire 
history of Sino-Soviet relations. 
The Role of Internal Politics 
The 1969 crisis has always been difficult 
to explain. On the face of it, the Chinese at-
tack at Chen-pao seemed irrational. Why 
should Peking risk even local hostilities with 
the Soviets to assert an historical claim to a 
useless island? And if Peking's goal was to 
demonstrate that China could not be pushed 
around, then why was an area chosen where 
Soviet troops were heavily concentrated and, 
as the March 15 clash showed, quite capa-
ble of humiliating the Chinese in pitched 
local battles? Most critically, why would 
China's leaders want to plunge into a foreign 
policy crisis when they were in fact prepar-
ing for a major domestic political event: 
the Ninth Parry Congress which opened in 
early April?' 
Perhaps no completely satisfying explana-
tion of the origins of the crisis will ever 
emerge, but a good case can be made that the 
initial Chinese attack on the Soviets was the 
outcome of intense political infighting with-
in China. bcith over who would set Chinese 
policy and whether Peking should execute a 
major departure in its foi ergo policy by lin-
pi-ovin; relations with the United States. 
l'or sorrh: years prior to the crisis, radical 
elements in the Chinese Communist party 
had been dominant in China, and foreign 
policy had been characterized by a xenopho-
bia which had left Peking isolated interna-
tionally. During 1968. however, a number 
of events, including the opening of the 
Paris peace talks on Vietnam, the Soviet: in-
vasion of Czechoslovakia and the election 
of a new American president. gave more 
pragmatic Chinese leaders a chance to argue

prolonged stagnation in Sino-
U.S. relations could well contrib-
ute to undermining the political 
power of those individuals and 
groups within China which are fa-
vorably disposed toward. Washing-
ton. . ? ." 
In the fall of 1965, Premier Chou, En-I4 
convinced Chairman Mao Tse-tung to move 
in this direction, but this decision was ap-
parently reversed in February 1969 because 
of intense opposition from Chines mili-
tary establishment and radical leaders like 
Chiang Ching and Yao Wen-yuan who had 
gained prominence during the Cultural Rev-
olution.' 
The radicals opposed the opening for 
ideological reasons: Defense Minister Lin 
Piao and the military opposed it because it 
would have been a triumph for Lin's princi-
pal rival. Chou. and because they wanted to 
leave the door open for improved relations 
with Moscow. In retrospect, it appears that 
Mao and Chou were reversed on an initia-
tive in which they had invested considerable 
prestige, and, given the advances made by 
Lin just two months later at the Ninth 
Party Congress at the expense of pragma-
tists and radicals, one can make a case that 
both Mao and Chou were in a precarious 
political position in early 1969. 
Under these circumstances, a clash with 
the Soviets would serve the interests of Mao 
and Chou in a number of areas. Most impor-
tant, it would be a strong reassertion of 
Mao's personal authority following the Feb-
ruary setback on U.S. policy and the trend 
toward greater power for Lin and the mili-
tary. Second, it would be a setback for those 
within China, like Lin and his supporters, 
who were arguing that Sino-Soviet relations 
should be improved. Third, the resultant 
increase in Sino-Soviet tension would pro-
vide dramatic justification for a future open-
ing to the United States. In short, it would 
serve both the foreign policy and domestic 
political purposes of these key Chinese deci-
sion-makers. 
This line of explanation, however, raises 
some very difficult questions. If Lin and his 
supporters on the politburo had been strong 
enough to reverse Mao and Chou on the 
question of the first steps toward the open-
ing to the United States, why would they 
not have had enough clout to prevent mili-
tary action which was not in their best in-

tio:1- (unpublished Ph.D. dissertation. Harvard Uni-
versi(y, 1975). . 
41 
terests? Moreover, since Lin was in charge 
of the defense bureaucracy, how could a de-
cision requiring a military action be taken 
without his approval? 
While it is possible that Mao and Chou 
confronted Lin directly on this decision and 
simply ordered him to take steps to imple-
ment it, it seems more likely, given the inter-
nal political situation, that they pursued 
their goals by circumventing the normal 
chain of command and directly ordered Chen 
Hsi-lien, commander of the Shenyang mili-
tary region, to attack. the Soviets. Because 
Chen.'s own personal ambitions were well 
served by an increase in tension on the Sino-
Soviet border, it is likely that he would have 
obeyed an order from Mao, even at the risk 
of involving himself directly in the internal 
power struggle in Peking." In retrospect, it 
appears that the attack was not carefully 
planned by China's central defense establish-
ment, but, instead, was arranged on short 
notice and executed without the knowledge 
of higher military authorities in Peking. 
CC. . . Washington should consider 
recognizing Peking before the aged 
chairman leaves the scene in the 
hope that this might influence . . . 
the succession struggle. . 
This interpretation of the March 2 clash, 
in short, has Mao and Chou acting hastily 
for highly political reasons rather than mak-
ing a rational and detached determination of 
what China's national interests required. 
That they were prepared to risk the death of 
hundreds of Chinese soldiers. and even war 
with the Soviet Union, is thus a measure not 
only of bow high they calculated the stakes 
in the internal power struggle. but also of 
how badly they wanted to discredit those 
within China who opposed the opening to 
the United States. Certainly the message that 
Mao could count on the loyalty of China's 
second most powerful military regional com-
mander would not be lost on Lin in the 
continuing power struggle. 
While there were ups and downs in Chi-
nese propaganda throughout the remainder 
of 1969. tension in Sino-Soviet relations re-
mained high. Nationwide demonstrations 
began the day after the clash, and by March 
7 over 200 million Chinese had participat-
ed in mass rallies denouncing Soviet revision-
ism and vowing vigilance along the border. 
The intended impact on the domestic rivals 
of Mao and Chou was unmistakable. Anti-
Soviet sentiment was strong among the Chi-

premier in 1975, and is a key figure in the succession

nese people and an) one favoring lessened 
tension with Moscow was treading on very 
unpopular gro,.incl. Nloreover. the Chinese 
continued. aggressive border patrolling until 
August when the Soviets responded by drop-
ping veiled hints about a possible nuclear 
strike. The crisis atmosphere reinforced the 
position of the Chinese pragmatists who 
were receptive to the overtures for improved 
Sino-U.S. relations which were coming out 
of Washington. 
In what was almost certainly a compro-
mise between the pragmatists and their op-
ponents, the Chinese agreed in October to 
open negotiations on the border dispute with 
Moscow, and then in January 1970 an-
nounced they would be willing to resched-
ule the aborted February 1969 Warsaw talks 
with the United States. While it quickly be-
came apparent that they were not taking the 
Sino-Soviet border talks seriously, the Chi-
nese tried to keep up momentum in relations 
with the United States by meeting in War-. 
saw in February 1970 and then scheduling 
another session of the bilateral talks for 
May 1970. Thus, the policy of an opening 
to the United States wcis well served by the 
March 2 crisis: though, as discussed below, 
Lin's drive to expand his power and influ-
ence in party affairs was not derailed but 
only slowed. In this context, the Sino-So-
viet clash of March 1969 was a prelude to 
the decisive confrontation between the prag-
matists and the military which came to a 
crisis two years later. 
Watershed: The Fall of Lin Piao 
By almost all surface criteria, Lin won a 
stunning victory at the Ninth Parry Con-
gress, primarily at the expense of Chou. 
Chou's power base was in the governmental 
bureaucracies, and of the six men drawn 
from this sector on the politburo in 1968, 
all but two, Chou and Li I-Isien-nien, lost 
their positions at the Congress. Eleven mili-
tary men were added to the politburo, a 
majority of whom were apparently Lin sup-
porters. Lin's close ally Chen Po-ta was 
added to the crucial Standing Committee of 
:he pc,litburo, and, more importantly, the 
C:ongrcss formally adopted a nels- constitu-
tion designating Lin as Mao's suc.cessor. Lin, 
it appeared, was well on his v:ay to supreme 
power within China. Anc! yet, just over 
two years later, China's most powerful. de-
G.nse minister had fallen from office follow-
ing an intense and ultimately violent strug-
gle within the Chinese leadership." 
Lin's fall was far more than the purging 
of a single individual. It was preceded by an 
elaborate conspiracy against Mao that in-
volved a large number of individuals and 
was followed by a purge of virtually all of 
China's ranking central military leaders. In 
42 
retrospect, the Lin Piao affair represented a 
crisis stage in the struggle for power between 
the pragmatists and elements of the military 
that had been under way since the Winding 
down of the Cultural Revolution in 1968. 
In relative terms, the radicals played only a 
marginal role. 
Many previous explanations of the Lin 
Piao crisis have played down the role of 
foreign policy issues.4 In contrast, I believe 
that these issues and, more specifically, their 
effect on resource allocation and the bamce 
of power between the pragmatists and the 
military, are central to explaining the events 
that preceded Lin's abortive 1971 coup. 
In brief. Lin appears to have consisz.-.;:ttly 
opposed any steps toward rapproclae:nent 
with the United States throughout 1969 
and 1970. He apparently seized on the U.S. 
invasion of Cambodia in the spring of 1970 
to persuade Mao both to cancel the sched-
uled Sino-U.S. talks in Warsaw and to make 
a series of reconciliatory gestures toward 
Moscow. 
This shift in China's foreign policy was 
reversed following the Second Plenum of the 
Ninth Party Congress in August 1970, 
when the balance of internal political forces 
began to tilt against Lin. New and authori-
tative anti-Soviet pronouncements were 
made and an ideological justification for im-
proved relations with the United States was 
endorsed publicly by high foreign ministry 
officials!' By December 1970, Mao felt 
strong enough to extend the historic invita-
tion to President Nixon. 
By early 1971, Lin and his military sup-
porters were faced not only with rapid prog-
ress in Sino-U.S. relations, but also with an-
other major foreign policy change: improv-
ing relations with Japan, a nation that vir-
tually all Chinese military men looked upon 
as an historic enemy and as a potentially 
very powerful future enemy. This issue, 
also, was hotly debated by the Chinese 
leadership. 
Policy Issues and Power 
At a critical point in any policy debate 
between leaders at the pinnacle of power, 
differences over issues become so intense that 
it is not the policy itself which is para-
mount, but rather the authority, power, and 
influence of the leader advocating the policy. 
And at this juncture, the debate over policy 
is transformed into a struggle for who will 
hold the ultimate power to decide the issue. 
Debates over foreign policy issues occur fre-
By far the best analysis of the changing balance of 
Forces within China at this time may be found in Doak 
Barnet's outstanding study, Uncertain Passage (Wash-
ington, D.C.: The Brookings Institution, 1974).

quently in China; but if one opposes a 
whole series of decisions, one becomes a 
prime candidate for being stripped of all 
;ower and purged from the party and gov-
ernment. 
In this context. the key question is not 
whether Lin opposed the openings to the 
United States and to Japan, but tchti he 
judged these issues important enough to risk 
strong and repeated opposition to policy 
that clearly had the approval of Mao him-
self. 
Part of the answer to this question lies in 
the rivalry between Lin. and Chou. Very 
early in the protracted debate over policy 
toward the United States and the Soviet 
Union. Lin put his prestige on the line and 
argued that the United States would remain 
deeply involved militarily in Asia and would 
therefore remain a principal enemy of China. 
Chou made a different estimate which even-
tually proved correct. Lin also probably ar-
gued that in the proper circumstances MOS-
cow would be willing to make a significant 
move to decrease Sino-Soviet tension and 
that this option should be explored. Chou 
countered that Moscow would offer only 
unsatisfactory gestures: and in this, also, 
events proved him right. So in policy de-
bate after policy debate, a certain dynamic 
propelled both Lin and Chou to attack each 
other, in order to discredit the policy-maker 
as well as the policy. 
The roots of Lin's intransigent position. 
however. probably lie even deeper: He and 
his supporters realized that the power they 
had attained, as well as the even more ex-
alted status they were seeking. were jeopar-
dized by the implications of the policies ad-
vocated by their rivals, the pragmatists. The 
increased sense of security that would grow 
out of improved relations with Japan and 
with a nuclear power like the United States, 
Lin and his supporters reasoned, would 
lead to pressures for smaller military expen-
ditures, especially in the areas they believed 
to be critical?nuclear weapons, missiles, 
and aircraft. Their influence and authority 
would also decline. Thus, rather than see 
their power drained away by the pragma-
tists' program. Lin and his supporters first 
A major doctrinal departure was apparent in a No-
vember speech by Chou's close associate Chic.? Kuan-
hua, now China's foreign minister. Chiao reformulat-
ed and expanded the concept of peaceful coexistence by 
stating that it applied to relations between "all coun-
tries whether they had the same or different social sys-
tems." This contrasted sharply with the precious au-
thoritative statement on the subject made by Lin at 
the Ninth Party Congress. Lin at that time had made 
an important distinction between the principles to be 
applied to capitalist and socialist countries, stating that 
the former should be dealt with on the basis of peace-
ful coexistence while relations with the latter should 
follow the principle of "proletarian internationalism." 
Chiao's statement marked a clear and unambiguous 
shift away from an ideologically based foreign policy 
to one emphasizing state-to-state relations, and there-
by constituted a major victory for the pragmatists. 
43 
opposed this program at every possible junc-
ture. and, when this failed, attempted to 
seize power. This attempted coup lead to 
Lin's death when the plane in which he was 
escaping to the Soviet Union crashed. 
The Politics of Resource Allocation 
Discussion of the parameters of China's 
Fourth Five Year Plan (1971-1975) began 
in late 1970 and continued after Lin's 
death in late 1971. Allocation of China's 
scarce. resources was a subject of much de-
bate?a debate which inevitably became en-
tangled with the foreign policy issues. 
Like many policy debates within China, 
this one found its way into the media, 
though in slightly disguised form. Through-
out the summer of 1971. numerous articles 
in People's Daily as well as some Radio 
Peking broadcasts focused attention on the 
problem of whether "electronics- or -steel 
and iron- development should be given pri-
ority. An article that appeared in People's 
Daily in June argued that one group of -po-
litical swindlers- within China (i.e.. Lin 
and his group) saw "atomic technology and 
jet engine technology" (i.e., electronics) as 
the key to enhancing China's power and 
status in world affairs. A Radio Peking 
broadcast on August 20 was even more 
pointed. It charged that the same group of 
"swindlers- believed that advanced weap-
ons were the "key to victory," and that. once 
China possessed them, "all imperialists will 
be finished and overthrown." Significantly, 
these views were sharply contrasted with 
those of Mao, who was quoted as condemn-
ing any strategy premised on the concept 
that "weapons decide everything." 
Recent intelligence studies on expendi-
tures for procurement of new military equip-
ment bear out this interpretation! Indeed, 
the rise and fall of the influence of Lin's 
military coalition is starkly reflected in the 
statistics presented in these studies. During 
the period when Lin and the miliary were 
n an ascendant position?roughly from 
1968 until the end of 197 I --rn Rita ry 
spending on procurement in all fields in-
creased dramatically, with a growing pro-
portion going to aircraft and missiles com-
bined. Following Lin's fall from power in 
1971, while amounts expended for procure-
ment of land arms and naval forces declined 
only slightly. expenditures on new aircraft 
and missiles fell dramatically. In overall 
terms, the reallocation of resources is shown 
by the fact that since 1971 military pro-
curement has decreased in relation to total 
industrial production (see chart below). 
The findings of these studies have been declassified 
and are available in U.S., Congress, Joint Economic 
Committee, Subcommittee on Priorities and Economy 
in Government, Allocation of Resources in the Soviet 
_ Union and Chi na--1975. Hearings, June 18 and

ment Printing Office, 1975), pp. 4445.

I do not mean to imply that foreign pol-
icy issues were more important than the 
more general issue of civilian versus military 
rule in Lin's fall from power. But foreign 
policy issues were an integral part of the 
struggle between the pragmatists and Lin's 
military coalition. Mao and Chou were un-
doubtedly engaged in a broadly-based cam-
paign to prevent Lin and the military from 
expanding their power further, and to do so 
they not only confronted this issue specifi-
cally, but .also used the thrust of their for-
eign policy program to focus the debate on 
the concrete issue of resource allocation. 
Thus the debate over resource allocation and 
foreign policy was the immediate catalyst for 
Lin's- fall because it brought the question of 
the continued predominance of the military 7 
in Chinese politics and society to a head. 
Just as Mao and Chou used a foreign pol-
icy crisis to further their domestic goals in 
1969, so in 1971 they used their diplomatic 
program for the same purpose. In the unset-
tled period following Lin's abortive coup. 
Mao and Chou systematically exaggerated 
the threat of war with the Soviet Union to 
create a crisis atmosphere conducive to party 
unity during the purge they conducted of 
pro-Lin military figures, a tactic similar to 
the one they used in the 1969 Sino-Soviet 
border clashes. 
All of this leads to the view that there is 
not as wide a division in China as there is in 
the United States between the worlds of the 
foreign and domestic policy-maker; indeed, 
it is reasonable to conclude that the small 
number of men at the apex of China's po-
litical structure do not make any significant 
distinctions between the spheres of domestic 
and foreign policy. 
Implementing the Pragmatists' Program 
In the aftermath of Lin's fall from pow-
er, China's pragmatists, under the skillful 
leadership of Chou, implemented a wide 
range of policies designed to enhance China's 
power and status in world affairs. On the 
diplomatic level, Chou moved to exchange 
representatives with the United States fol-
lowing Nixon's 1972 visit to Peking and to 
fully normalize diplomatic relations with 
key nations such as Japan and West Ger-
many. Ideology in foreign affairs was de-
emphasized, and China's main preoccupation 
was the orderly expansion of state-to-state 
relations. During the Cultural Revolution. 
China had diplomatic relations with only a 
handful of states; within two years of Lin's 
fall. China had normalized relations with 
virtually every nation in the world. 
In the economic sphere. Chinese planners 
projected savings from the cutback in mil-
itary spending foll.,.-04-ing Lin.'s fall, antic-
ipated earnings from the export of oil, and 
made a case for major technology imports 7 
from the West to contribute to the modern-
ization of China's economy.7 
This drive began in early 1973 and by 
the end of 1974 the Chinese had signed

Europe for over S2 billion in turnkey manu-

which (allowing for inflation) comes clos.e 
to the total of all Soviet plant technology 
transferred to China in the 1950s. Across 
the board, China's trade with Japan and 
the West has expanded dramatically in the 
1970s. 
This expansion of economic tics with the

extremely controversial issue in China, pe-
riodically attacked by radical critics of the

economy is geared more and more to reliance 
on the non-Communist world, moves to-
ward expanded economic ties with the Sovi-
et Union become more. difficult, decreasing 
the chances of a Sino-Soviet reconciliation. 
The Rise and Fall of Teng Ilsiao-ping 
While these policies were being implement-
ed, Chou's health began to fail and Teng 
Hsiao-ping, an able, flexible, and pragmatic 
administrator who had been purged during 
the Cultural Revolution, was groomed to 
succeed Chou as premier. At the National 
People's Congress (NPc) in January 1975. 
Teng was elevated to the Standing Com-
mittee of the politburo, named a vice chair-
man of the party and the highest ranking 
vice premier in the government, and given 
the key post of chief of staff of the People's 
Liberation Army. The NPC also appeared 
to place a capstone of legitimacy on the 
pragmatists' program, both in the domestic 
and the foreign policy areas. With man-
agerial skill and enthusiasm, Teng threw his 
strength into implementing and expanding 
this program. As did Lin, following his 
triumph at the Ninth Party Congress. Teng 
appeared to be on his way to a position of 
power in China second only to Mao. 
And yet when Chou died of cancer in mid-
January 1976, Teng dropped abruptly and 
unexpectedly from public view, and in Feb-
ruary Hua Kuo-feng, a relatively junior 
member of the Chinese hierarchy, was named 
acting premier. Following two months of 
intense infighting which included massive 
public demonstrations, Teng was stripped 
of all his party and government posts and 
Hua was named premier as well as vice chair-
man of the party. 
Many of the circumstances preceding 
Teng's unexpected fall are similar to those 
which preceded Lin's all in 1971: Just as 
in 1971, planning for China's Five Year 
Plan (1976-1980) was underway in 1975, 
and an intense debate over expenditures for 
advanced military technology broke into the 
media. this time complicated by the issue of 
whet her China should import large ottan-
i ies of Wesiern military technology." Just 
a: in 1971. when policy toward the United 
States and the Soviet Union was in ques-
tion. the debate over resource allocation be-
came intertwined with the discussions over 
foreign and defense. policy which must have 
preceded President Ford's visit in Novem-
ber. the surprise.- release in December of a 
Soviet helicopter crew previously charged 
with espionage against China, and the invi-
tation to former President Nixon to make 
a return visit to China_ 
A full explanation of Teng's unexpected 
45 
eclipse will have to await further evidence. 
What appears clear at this juncture is that 
like Lin. Teng attained a position which, if 
he had succeeded Chou as planned, would 
have made him Mao's designated heir appar-
ent, an extremely dangerous slot in view of 
the fact that everyone who has previously at-
tained it has been purged. Like Lin. Teng 
had been rapidly expanding his power base 
by placing his supporters?most of them re-
habilitated after having been disgraced dur-
ing the Cultural Revolution?in key party 
and provincial posts. 
In short. Teng may 'well have provoked 
a coalescence of forces against him precisely 
because he was so rapidly expanding his 
power and influence. Whatever differences 
there may have been over issues, these may 
have been reinforced by the power struggle. 
seemingly a permanent fixture of the Chi-
nese political system. Once a leader appears 
to be gaining too much power, his oppo-
nents gain the powerful support of Mao and 
move against him.. In 1971. that leader was 
Lin Piao: in 1976. it was Teng Hsiao-ping. 
, Hua Kuo-feng 
Hua Kuo-feng is a relatively unknown 
quantity in Chinese politics. He appears to 
be a compromise candidate, acceptable to 
pragmatists and radicals as well as to key 
military leaders, who enjoys the trust of 
Mao himself. After rising in the ranks of 
the party in Hunan?Mao's own native 
province?Hua was called to Peking in late 
1971, and may well have gained the con-
fidence of top officials by playing a role in 
the investigation and purge of pro-Lin ele-
ments in the military establishment. 'While 
his position between 1971 and 1973 is not 
known, he became the eleventh ranking 
member of the politburo at the Tenth Party 
Congress in 1973, and was named sixth 
ranking vice premier at the NPC in 1975. 
, He is in his mid-fifties and far younger than 
any of China's other senior leaders, a factor 
which may have been influential in his at-
taining his present position. 
Since January 1975, Hua has also held 
the key government post of minister of 
public security, an especially important fact 
since this has placed him at the center of 
successful efforts throughout 1975 to main-
tain public order by preventing various po-
litical campaigns from getting out of hand. 
Hua presumably either still runs the security 
ministry personally, or has named one of 
his close deputies as acting chief of police 
'This question is obviousty of major concern to the 
United Sr:, For a discussion of whether the United 
States should export military technology to China, see

and security operations. Given this back-
ground and responsibility, it is highly un-
likely that Hua was chosen to preside over 
a return to the disorder of the Cultural Rev-
olution, though he may well preside over 
the purge of those who have become too 
closely aligned with Teng. 
Hua's pronouncements to date on foreign 
policy issues suggest that, at least for the 
immediate future, he plans no major depar-
tures. In his banquet remarks during Nix-
on's visit in February, Hua stated unequiv-
ocally that the Soviet Union was the main 
threat to world peace, and that Peking want-
ed to see the implementation of the Shang-
hai Communiqu?nd further improvement 
in Sino-U.S. relations. In his remarks at 
the close of the Nixon visit. Hua was care-
ful to toast Ford, an apparent effort to 
reverse the negative reaction in Washington 
to the timing of the Nixon visit. Hua's 
views on the key question of continued im-
portation of 'Western technology are not 
clear. and any statements or actions he may 
take in this regard will be a key indicator 
of the future course of Chinese policy. 
Implications for U.S. Policy 
While predictions on Chinese politics and 
policy are extremely risky, the evidence avail-
able to date indicates that the pragmatist's 
foreign policy program will not be seriously 
impaired by recent events. The United States 
can expect to deal with leaders like Hua 
who are basically favorably disposed toward 
maintaining and expanding ties with Wash-
ington and the \Vest. At the same time, it 
is reasonable to presume that Hua's admin-
istration, lacking the prestige of the Chou-
Teng administration, will be more vulner-
able to pressures from its domestic oppo-
nents. These pressures are likely to inten-
sify further when Mao passes from the scene, 
an event certain to usher in yet another?
and even more intense--seruggle for pow-
er in China. 
With these observations in mind, it is 
possible to offer some comments on the im-
plications of U.S. action?or inaction?
with regard to China. Since a premise of 
U.S. policy since 1969 has been that rela-
tions between Peking and Moscow are like-
ly to remain hostile, these comments must 
begin with a discussion of the level of Sino-
Soviet tension. 
Overall, tension in Sino-Soviet relations 
between 1970 and late 1975 remained rel-
atively low compared to the crisis atmos-
phere following the border clashes in 1969. 
This reflected the extension of the prag-
matists' control, the fact that the domestic 
situation was fairly stable, and the greater 
recognition China received from the inter-
national community. Since the jockeying for 
power that preceded and followed Chou's 
death in Janua-ry, hOwever, anti-Soviet prop-
aganda has intensified, and at some point 
during the protracted and delicate succes-
sion process now under way, it is not in-
conceivable that a group that would judge 
its interests served by a provocation such 
as the 1969 border clash could become pre-
dominant in China?perhaps led by Hua 
himself. 'Whether or not such a situation 
evolves depends, in part, on events outside 
China, particularly on the actions of the 
Soviet Union and the United States. 
U.S. moves to establish full diplomat-
ic relations with China would probably 
strengthen the pragmatists' position and 
Peking's commitment to expanding ties with 
non-Communist countries. Paradoxically, 
such developments would probably also 
lessen the tendency toward periodic crises 
with the Soviet Union. Not only would 
there be less need for China's leaders to play 
up the Soviet threat in order to deflect at-
tacks from domestic critics, but?with in-
creased self-confidence in the international 
arena?these leaders would probably be 
more willing to enter into serious negotia-
tions with the Soviets over the border issue. 
If Moscow were careful to take Chinese sen-
sitivities into consideration by making a sub-
stantial conciliatory gesture (such as a siz-
able drawdown of its forces in the border 
area), some form of mutually acceptable 
border arrangement could conceivably be 
worked out. 
A Sino-Soviet border agreement should 
, not, in the long run, he counter to U.S. in-
terests. In fact, it would be of some benefit. 
The primary effect would be to decrease sub-
stantially the chances of some future border 
incident?a development which is obvious-
ly in Washington's interests. In any case, 
China's own interests are at odds with those 
of the Soviet Union throughout Asia, and 
a border agreement would not end the Sino-
; Soviet struggle for influence and power there 
I or in the rest of the world. 
I Furthermore, even-if there were some im-
provement in Sino-Soviet relations, the 
United States would still have leverage for 
maintaining competition between the two 
:wers. The Chinese. pragmatists, having 
iieen strengthened by normalization of re-
: Izions with the United States, would prob-
.11,1y pursue even further their search for pow-
,: and prestige through conventional di-
plomacy and economic development_ Indeed. 
given the right circumstances, a pragmatic 
C:hinese government might in the future be 
amenable to expanding substantially its cul-
rural, economic, and perhaps even military 
i ties with non-Communist countries in gen-
eral and with the United States in partic-
ular. The recently completed purchase of

manufacturing technology from Great Brit-
ain is a clear indication of .Pekines strong 
interest in purchasing Western military tech-
nology. Should the Sino-U.S. relationship 
advance along these lines, there is little doubt 
that there would be serious Soviet concern 
and that this would express itself in in-
creased Sino-Soviet tension, thus inhibiting 
any moves toward Sino-Soviet reconcilia-
tion. 
At the same time, expanded ties with the 
United States would directly or indirectly 
provide greater resources for meeting the 
military coalition's goal of strengthening 
China's military capabilities. An ameliora-
tion of internal antagonisms on this issue 
would be likely to increase support for the 
pragmatists among at least some el,-:nents 
of the military, a development w1-.1-a in 
turn would contribute to the strength and 
stability of a Chinese leadership with vested 
interests in maintaining good relations with 
the United States. 
Alternatively. prolonged stagnation in. 
Sino-U.S. relations could well contribute to 
undermining the political power of those in-
dividuals and groups within. China which 
are favorably disposed toward Washington, 
and lead to an increase in rhe relative pow-
er of either pro-Soviet elements in the mil-
itary, the radicals, or some coalition of both 
groups If this happens. China might well 
revert to a self-imposed isolationism similar 
to that of the Cultural Revolution or seek 
a general accommodation with Moscow. 
While these developments are unlikely as 
long as Mao lives, once he dies they could 
emerge as the consequence of a post-Mao 
power struggle. 
Since these eventualities are clearly not in 
the best interests of the United States, I be-
lieve that Washington should consider rec-
ognizing Peking before the aged chairman 
leaves the scene in the hope that this might 
influence the present configuration of po-
litical power within China and thereby the 
succession struggle certain to intensify fol-
lowing Mao's death. 
Obviously, in formulating U.S. policy 
toward China, a number of complicated 
problems other than the internal political 
balance in Peking must be taken into con-
sideration. With respect to the difficult issue 
of Taiwan, the United States could follow 
the "Japanese model," formally recognizing 
Peking while maintaining a close economic 
relationship with Taiwan. The Soviets have 
almost certainly resigned themselves to U.S. 
recognition of Peking at some point, and 
their opposition is likely to amount to little 
more than pro forma objections and a mi-
nor propaganda blitz. Indeed, some policy-
makers within Moscow might even welcome 
Sino-U.S. diplomatic tics, especially if they 
believed this would reduce the chances of Chi-
nese adventures like the 1969 border clash. 
Finally, recognition of Peking would be 
applauded by Japan as well as the major 
powers of Western Europe, all of which have 
- long since established formal diplomatic ties 
with China. In short, the negative reper-
cussions of breaking diplomatic ties with 
Taiwan could be mitigated and in any case 
would be more than offset by positive re-
sponses from our most important allies in 
Asia and Europe. 
Writing in 1970, the noted French schol-
ar Michel Tatu argued that "there will have 
to be a Washington-Peking dialogue, even 
at the risk of ... offending the Soviet Union. 
When this takes place the triangular setup 
_ will have become fully operative, and the

r:ssition of the three powers.

nent as,lvcrsaric and seeking none. the Amer-

hring about the world equilibrium which is

Tatu's observations and the gradual im-
provement in Sino-U.S. relations since 1972 
suggest that at some point the very logic 
of the triangular relationship will lead to a 
U.S. decision to follow through on the 
Shanghai Communique and formally rec-
ognize Peking as the sole government of 
China. The only serious question is wheth-
er or not the United States will continue to 
(ielay this decision until the balance of in-
ternal forces within China alters and Peking 
embarks on a policy of isolationism or ac-
commodation with the Soviets, which in ef-
fect would undermine the logical underpin-
nings of the entire triangular equation.

WASHINGTON POST 
3 I v?N?r  
Saigon's 
Secrets 
Seized 
Thieu and U.S. 
Didn't Destroy 
ClaSified Files. 
'By Don Oberdorfer . 
Washington Post Staff Writer 
North Vietnamese in-
vading Saigon took over 
virtually complete files, of 
the South Vietnamese 
arm ed forces, national 
police and sth.et intelli-
gence agency, including 
highly classified data 
which had been furnished, 
by the United States, 'ac-
cording to the last chief 
CIA analyst of Commu-
nist strategy at the U.S. 
Embassy there. 
Frank W. Snepp, who left 
Saigon on the final day of 
U.S. evacuation last year 
and resigned from the CIA 
this January, said the secret 
files of former Smith Viet-
namese President Nguyen 
Van Thieu were also left' be-
hind. 
Calling these unintended 
legacies "a tragedy," Snepp 
said they may reveal to 
Communist authorities a 
great deal about U.S. intelli-
gence operations and permit 
them- to identify well-placed 
U.S. agents behind Commu-
nist lines as well as "anyone 
who helped us in the slight-
est degree." 
, Snepp's statements in an 
interview confirmed por-
tions of an extraordinary 
book-length memoir, re-
cently published and broad-
cast in Vietnam, by the 
North Vietnamese Army 
Chief of Staff, Gen. Van 
Tien Dung. Dung was Com-
munist field commander for 
the final campaign of the 
war: 
At South Vietnamese po-
lice headquarters and mili-
tary general staff headquar-
ter g "we found that top-se-
cret files and documents of 
the puppet commanders 
were intact," Dung wrote. 
"A modern enemy computer 
containing the records of 
each officer and enlisted 
man of the puppet armed 
forces of more than a mil-
lion was still operating." 
? "Giai Phone', a recent 
book on the fall of Saigon 
by Tiziano Terzani, an Ital-
ian journalist who remained 
in the capital after the take-
over, reported that double 
agents' inside''South Viet:1 
nam's Central Intelligence; 
Organization - were able to 
save "all the dossiers that ? 
hid been compiled over the' 
years by the secret police in 
collaboration with the , 
American CIA." 
Snepp, who is writing ai 
? book of his own on the col-
lapse of South Vietnam, 'at-
tributed the failure to de-
stroy vital documents and , 
other records to mistaken 
belief by senior ' U.S. Em-
bassy officials in "smoke 
screens" and "ambiguous,' 
signals" which suggested 
that a negotiated settlement 
was possible This "wishful' 
thinking," shared in Wash; 
ington, put off the destruc-
tion of files and evacuation 
of- key intelligence agents 
, 
untili was oo late, Snepp. 
said. ? 
Snepp said the CIA's chief 
in Saigon, Thomas Polgar, 
as well as Ambassador Gra-
ham Martin were deceived 
by hints of a negotiated deal ? 
in April 1975 and we-e err: 
couraged in their belief by, 
high officials in Washington." 
At the same time, however, 
"consistent intelligence 
from the ground was- that 
there would be no negoti-
ated settlement, and this 
was from the most reliable 
sources," Snepp said. . 
The North Vietnamese', 
general's ? account 'of deci-
sion-making in the Commu-
nist command gives no indi-
cation that a negotiated deal 
was considered during the 
final Saigon drive, and ev-
ery, indication to the con-
trafy. Dung relates that the 
order for quick 'liberation cf 
Saigon came from the North 
Vietnamese Politburo in the 
third week of March, 1975. 
He reoorts successive orders 
after that for the Saig.on at-
tack with no sign of letup. 
Dung refers contemptu-
ously to "perfidious diplo-
matic maneuvers to check ? 
our troops' ' advance, and 
avoid total defeat." He 
attacks the "U.S, CIA clique 
in' Saigon" for condticting 
what he claims were -"many 
. . 
plots." CIA  station 
chief Polgar, who is of Hun-
garian: extraction, was a key, , 
figure in Saigon contacts 
about a negotiated deal with 
Hungarian and Polish dele-
gates of the Intefnational 
Control Commission. 
Secretary of State Henry 
A. Kissinger evidently 
placed credence in the possi-
bility of a negotiated deal to 
forestall the attack on Sai-
gon.- Kissinger has said pub-
licly that North Vietnam 
"changed their signals" and 
"appeared to shift suddenly . 
to a military option" on 
Aoril 27, three days before 
the fall of the capital. But 
the Dung account?and the 
intelligence reports cited by 
Snepp?indicate there was 
no possibility ok negotiations 
and thus ?there _WEIS no shift 
in signals. 
Snepp said several, key 
points in the recent detailed 
memoir by the North ' 
namese general have con?
vinced him that the Commu-
nist side ha-d a spy with . ac-
cess to the most important 
information of the South Vi-
etnamese government. At the 
same time, he added, the 
United States had accurate 
Intelligence within days 
about Communist strategic 
decisions cited in Dung's ac-
count. 
The crucial difference, 
Snepp- suggested, was that,' 
the, _ Communists believed 
the intelligence they were I 
getting, but the ? United 
States chose to ignore 'its ac. 
? curate intelligence data in a 
concentration on "smoke 
screens" and "wishftll think-
ing" about negotiations. 
According to Snepp, the 
account by Dung gives these 
indications of Communist 
intelligence powers: 
' ? Dung reports receiving 
a "flash cable" at his field 
\command postS March_ 13 
from Defense Minister Vo 
Nguyen Giap in Hanoi say-
ing ,that the Politburo and 
high command believed 
South Vietnam might aban-
don the Central Highlands 
in a "strategic retreat." 
Dung . was instructed to 
quickly encircle Phubon, a 
key area in a retreat path. 
' According to Snepp, 
Thieu had been seriously 
considering such a retreat 
in great secrecy for only a 
few days before that, and se-
cretly informed his cabinet 
and the JOint General Staff 
-March 13 that he had de-
cided to exe,cute the with-
drawal Plan. The South Viet-
namese general in charge 
of the withdrawal was in-
formed March 14. The pull-
ont began March 15. 
The United States knew 
nothing of Thieu's order un-
-til March 15, Snepp said. By 
then, Dung's troop's were al-
ready moving to- cut off the-' 
retreat at Phubon. The 
quick North Vietnamese ma-
neuver led to the" destruc-
tion of nearly the entire 
force being withdrawn from 
the highlands?the equaiva- , 
lent of two division. This 
was to -,be Thieu's strategic 
reserve. "That loss spelled 
the end of South Vietnam," - 
Snepp said. 
? Dung quotes "our intelli-
gence reports' on a tnajor 
assessment session held by 
Thieu on the fourth floor of 
the presidential palace in 
Saigon Dec. 9-10, 1974. This 
assessment, which predicted 
only moderately big Com-
munist attacks during 1975, 
was quoted by Dung in his . 
memoir. Snepp said the quo-
tation was a remarkably ac-
curate summary of a U.S. 
CTA estimate?which he him-
self drafted?supplied ,:for 
? Thieu's.use in the year-end 
assessment. 
-After learning of the Sai-. 
gon assessment, the Hanoi 
Politburo amended its plan 
for a two-year- campalIgn to 
liberate the South. While 
still- pl..ning for a 1;975-76 . 
campaign, the Politburo 
added a guideline for libera-
tion in 1975 "if opportunities 
presented themselves," ac-
cording to Dung. 7 
This was done in Hanoi on 
Jan. 9, 1975. According to . 
Snepp, the United States ob-
tained an accurate 
gence report within 10 days 
of. this decision. 
? Dung quotes a secret re-
port, sent by Ambassador 
Martin to Washington on 
April 19, 1975, "on the true 
situation" in the South. Ac-
curately summarized by 
Dung, this repOrt was 
drafted by Snepp for Martin-
to use in persuading Thieu 
to resign the presidency and 
thus -make way for the ru-
mored "negotiations." 
According to Snepp, Mar-
tin took a copy of the report 
to Thieu at the presidential 
palace on April 20, while Ca- ? 
bling another copy to Wash-
ington. The report was a de-
cisive factor in Thieu's de-
cision to resign, which he 
announced Apri 21.. 
Snepp said he helped pre- ; 
pare?but does not Stand by I 
?another classified U.S. re-
port which was quoted in 
the North Vietnamese gen-
eral's account of the final 
days of the war. This esti-
mate, cited as evidence that 
Thieu was "forced to fight a 
poor man's war," said that 
South Vietnamese firepowe 
had decreased by nearly 60 
per cent due to bomb and 
ammunition shortages, and 
that South Vietnamese mo-
bility was cut in half, by 
shortages of aircraft, vehi-
cles and fuel. 
Snepp said these esti-
mates were prepared by 
U.S. officials in Saigon early 
in 1975 in an effort to sel 
Congress on the need to ap-
propriate additional aid to 
South Vietnam. Snepp said 
'the phfase, "a poor man's 
war," was originated by the 
United States for this pur-
p6se. 
The former CIA official 
said these estimates were

pulled out of the air for U.S. 
political reasons. He said he 
did not know whether or not 
North Vietnam believed 
these numbers when its 
spies obtained them in Sai-
gon..
