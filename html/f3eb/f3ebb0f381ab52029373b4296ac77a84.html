 SLOGAN 'STRUGGLE FOR DEMOCRACY, FREEDOM' CALLED INCORRECT
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 10 Mar 81 pp 1-2
 [Article by He Jin [0149 0284]:                                                              "On the So-Called 'Strive for Democracy and
 Strive for Freedom"']
 [Text]   It is necessary to improve and develop the socialist
 democratic system.  To this end, the broad masses of people
 under the CCP leadership are required to uphold the four basic
 principles, give full play to their creative spirit as masters
 of their own country, and work together to build a socialist
 democracy that meets the needs of our nation.   This absolutely
 does not mean a "struggle for democracy and freedom" waged by
 someone against someone else.  If we view ourselves as masters
 of our own country rather than as third observers and if we
 resolutely uphold party leadership and treasure the current
 political situation of stability and unity, we will neither
 approve nor appreciate the slogan:   "Struggle for democracy
 and for freedom," which reflects the erroneous tendency of a
 small number of people attempting to abandon and weaken party
 leadership.   This is something that deserves our attention.
 Amid the clarion call for upholding the four basic principles, developing socialist
 democracy, strengthening the socialist legal system, and bringing about greater
 political stability, occasionally we have heard another slogan entitled "strive
 for democracy and strive for freedom."  This slogan has become popular with a
 small number of people.   But some youths without political experience have been
 bewildered by this slogan. Since a slogan represents an idea that can affect
 people's action, we cannot ignore it.   Some necessary ideological work must be
 carried out to advise them of this matter.
 How To Treat Freedom and Democracy
 This is an old topic of discussion dating back over a century to the days of the
 famous polemics between Marx and Bakunin and between Lenin and Kautsky.   But today
 it has asserted itself in a new way.   Experience tells people that every declara-
 tion, program and slogan must be assessed in terms of their substance rather than
 in terms of their beautiful language.  Historically, the bourgeoisie always called
 their democracy something for all people and interpreted their freedom in absolute

 terms.  The proletariat, however, always evaluate historical facts as they existed
 and want to tell people the truth that democracy is for classes rather than for
 all people, and that freedom is relative rather than absolute.   This shows that
 the slogans "democracy" and "freedom" used by the bourgeoisie differ in content
 and nature from the same slogans used by the proletariat.
 It was these slogans, "democracy" and "freedom," that were used by the bourgeoisie
 to overthrow the feudal system, establish democratic countries and cause capital
 to dominate in these countries.  It was through this historical process that the
 bourgeoisie won democracy and freedom.  But "under the capitalist system, as a
 matter of rule, the laboring masses cannot truly enjoy democracy." (Lenin:   "The
 Third International and Its Historical Status")    The freedom won by the bour-
 geoisie was a freedom of capital or freedom for capital to exploit labor.   The
 laborers can only enjoy freedom to sell their labor "until their labor power is
 exhausted."   (Marx:   "Das Kapital" Vol 1, p 159) Has this historical fact, which
 was proven true long ago by Marxism-Leninism, changed today?  Some individuals
 have observed that today this situation has undergone radical changes as a result
 of the rapid development of capitalist  material civilization and of the bourgeoisie
 implementing a policy of winning the members of the proletariat over to their
 side.   Actually, this only touches the surface of the matter. The hypothetical
 nature of bourgeois democracy and freedom is underscored by the capitalist system
 of private ownership.   "As long as private ownership of land and the means of pro-
 duction continues to exist, the terms 'freedom' and 'equality' in the bourgeois
 system and democracy will exist in form only.   As a matter of fact, they are only
 tools in the implementation of a slave-hiring system imposed on workers (who are
 nominally free and equal), and tools for the capitalist dictatorship and for capital
 to exploit labor."   (Lenin:   Preface to the publication "On the Use of Freedom and
 Equality To Deceive People.")  This situation essentially remains unchanged.
 In the struggle for their own liberation, the proletariat have also used the slo-
 gans "democracy" and "freedom."                 Yet even when the proletariat had to go along
 with the bourgeoisie for a while in order to meet the requirements for struggle
 during the historical period of the democratic revolution, they never intended to
 mix their own slogans with the "democracy" and "freedom" slogans used by the
 bourgeoisie.  The proletariat believe that "democracy" and "freedom" in a class
 society have a class nature; as a form of state and part of the superstructure,
 democracy must coexist with the socioeconomic base; democracy cannot exist in
 isolation, in a vacuum.   For this reason, during the revolutionary struggle the
 proletariat have never used democracy and freedom as a general, common slogan but
 as a slogan bearing a specific historical mission to fuilfill a specific objective
 under a specific historical condition.
 During the democratic revolution, the Chinese proletariat and people enjoyed no
 democratic rights at all, because they were suppressed at the bottom of the three
 big mountains--feudalism, imperialism and bureaucrat-capitalism.   During this
 period, the struggle for democracy and freedom meant capturing political power,
 smashing the old state organs by means of violent revolution, nullifying the
 feudal and capitalist systems of exploitation, and winning democratic rights for
 the people.   Today we have established a socialist power in our country.   Now the
 "struggle for democracy and struggle for freedom" slogan is in the air again.   What
 form of democracy and freedom are the people struggling for?  After singling out

 certain phenomena in capitalist countries and comparing them with their counter-
 parts in our country, some individuals said:                                                                                 Our socialist country is trailing
 behind capitalist countries in developing democracy and therefore it must undergo
 a full-scale process of developing bourgeois democracy.  Is this opinion correct?
 Obviously, it is extremely wrong.
 In contrast to the most "democratic" capitalist countries, our socialist system
 is essentially the most extensive people's democracy.  Of course, we still have a
 gap to be filled and reforms to be carried out in the direction of developing
 socialist democracy.   Essentially, our socialist democracy is based on the socialist
 system of public ownership.   This factor determines that our laboring people are
 masters of their own society and underscores the extensive nature of our socialist
 democracy.  As a result of the implementation of the socialist system of public
 ownership, exploitation has been eliminated; people like Huang Shiren [7806 0013
 00881 and Mu Renzhi [4476 0088 2535] have disappeared from the countryside, along
 with such characters as Yang Bailao [2799 4101 0525] and Xi Erh [0823 9756]; be-
 cause millionaires no longer exist in the cities, human tragedies such as those
 that occurred in "Santiaoshi" in Tianyin have not been repeated elsewhere.   The
 laboring people have won basic rights free from exploitation while enjoying the
 right to be masters of their country. Despite the constant improvements in the
 bourgeois democratic system over the past 2 centuries, in the final analysis, it
 remains a dictatorship imposed by a small number of bourgeois elements.  Under
 such a dictatorship, laborers are nothing more than a tool for creating surplus
 value for capitalists..  Although the bourgeoisie have a variety of systems,
 including elections, parliamentary and multiparty systems, they are at best nothing
 more than devices in the hands of the capitalist authority.  The capitalist system
 of private ownership rules out the possibility that bourgeois democracy can become
 a perfect democracy for the majority of the people.  When the power structure is
 dominated by capital and when human value is measured by money, so-called democracy,
 freedom and human rights are in the end nothing more than a scrap of paper in the
 eyes of the proletariat.   If anyone forgets this point, he disqualifies himself
 as a student of the most elementary sociology and history.   Those who envy bourgeois
 democracy have expressed the hope that it will be permitted to grow fully in our
 country.  Does this thinking sound correct?  Do we still have to roll back the
 clock and allow the bourgeoisie to enjoy full-scale democracy and place the pro-
 letariat and the laboring people in danger of being exploited and oppressed again
 as they suffered in the past?
 What Should Be Relied Upon To Perfect and Develop  Socialist Democracy?
 Without people's democracy, there would be no socialism. Undoubtedly, how to
 strengthen socialist democracy remains an important question that needs to be
 answered on a continuing basis.   Today our socialist democratic system is still
 not perfect and needs to be improved because it is full of loopholes.   We must
 get rid of the heavy burdens left behind by the old system, improve and develop
 socialist democracy, and learn to correctly apply the democratic power to manage
 our country.   But this is a process that takes time to complete.  Because political
 forces of different persuasions place different demands on democracy, socialist
 democracy will certainly collide with various erroneous trends of thought.   Be-
 cause of this, in the course of its development, our socialist democracy has
 suffering setbacks.   Tendencies of overconcentration of power and anarchism have

 appeared in our country.  It is particularly noteworthy that when the Lin Biao
 and Jiang Qing counterrevolutionary cliques were in the heyday of their power,
 our socialist democracy suffered serious setbacks.  Today our democratic system
 remains ineffective in preventing the growth of bureaucracy, patriarchal work--
 style, special privileges and other bad  workstyles among the state organs and
 cadres in our country from the position of overseers.   Nor can it play an effec-
 tive role in protecting the broad masses of laboring people and in dealing blows
 to enemy elements.  These are problems that deserve our attention and conscien-
 tious efforts to seek solution.
 But today we face the challenge of how to play a leading role in perfecting and
 developing the socialist democratic system rather than how to "struggle for
 democracy and freedom."
 First, we must realize that in our country the political power and the means of
 production are in the control of the laboring people, and the principle that all
 power must be vested in the laboring people has been firmly established; our con-
 stitution guarantees democratic rights for the people.   Today, the problem that
 needs to be solved is how the people's democratic rights can be effectively pro-
 tected, how the people can correctly exercise their democratic power and how can
 they make it function normally in society.
 In order to solve this problem, the broad masses of people under the leadership of
 the CCP must uphold the four basic principles and display the creative spirit of
 masters of their own country in the common endeavor to build a socialist democracy
 that meets the needs of our nation.  It is absolutely not a "struggle for democracy
 and freedom" waged by someone against someone else.   We will neither endorse nor
 appreciate this slogan "struggle for democracy and freedom" if we join the laboring
 people in protecting and defending party leadership, in preserving the political
 situation of stability and unity, and if we regard ourselves as masters of our own
 country rather than outsiders or third observers.
 Some people say that the "struggle for democracy and freedom" is necessary, be-
 cause "a bureaucratic class" exists in our country.   We must oppose bureaucracy
 as we consistently opposed it in the past.   We must criticize, educate, and carry
 out the necessary struggle against those leaders strongly affected by the bureau-
 cratic workstyle.   But the allegation that "a bureaucratic class exists in our
 country" is inconsistent with the facts and is too sensational.   The bureaucratic
 style must be analyzed from the proletarian point of view.  The bureaucracy that
 has appeared in our socialist society is extremely different in nature from the
 bureaucratic system that exists in society under the rule of the exploiting classes,
 because it does not originate from the socialist political and economic systems.
 It dates back several thousand years.   It appeared in feudal society and continues
 to grow in capitalist countries.   Therefore, it cannot be completely eliminated
 from our socialist country in short order.   It must be pointed out that bureaucracy
 and feudalism under the socialist system differ in nature from the bureaucratic
 system in capitalist countries, and therefore should be overcome with different
 methods.   Bureaucracy essentially cannot be separated from the system of private
 ownership.   In societies of private ownership, bureaucracy is bound to grow in the
 superstructure, and therefore the problem of bureaucracy cannot be overcome by
 implementing new regulations under the system of private ownership.   Under the

 socialist system, bureaucracy is associated with the forces of old habits, old
 ideas and old workstyles.   Basically, the socialist system of public ownership
 cannot coexist with bureaucracy.  As long as we uphold the four basic principles,
 the "bureaucratic class" is unlikely to emerge.  Under socialism, bureaucracy
 can be gradually eliminated and overcome through constant efforts to improve and
 perfect our systems and through criticism and self-criticism.  This shows that
 under the capitalist system opposition to the bureaucratic rule refers to the
 necessity of overthrowing a political power in order to win democratic rights or
 political ruling power for the people and the necessity of changing the capitalist
 system completely, while under the socialist system opposition to bureaucracy
 refers to the necessity of eliminating the old ideas and influence, improving the
 leadership method, carrying forward socialist democracy, building up political
 power, and reforming and developing the socialist leadership system in a specific
 way.   Since these two issues differ in nature, how can they be integrated into a
 single subject?  True, bureaucracy, patriarchal workstyle, special privileges
 for cadres, and other bad lifestyles still exist in our country, and violation of
 the people's democratic rights by some units in specific debates over certain
 issues is still possible.   Despite this, experience shows that they are essen-
 tially not tolerable in the socialist system.  In the final analysis, they repre-
 sent only a partial picture of our society.   It is certain that our socialist
 system can play a decisive role in overcoming such ugly phenomena and in guiding
 our country to move in the direction of a broad-based democracy.   Should we tear
 down a building in order to eradicate rats? It is certainly unnecessary.   How-
 ever, "struggle for democracy and freedom" is a slogan that does not inspire the
 people to think out problems in this way. This slogan has also inspired the people
 to ignore the basic differences between socialism and capitalism, and to advocate
 the adoption of an erroneous measure against the party and state.   For this
 reason, we must rule out the possibility that the problems in developing socialist
 democracy and in overcoming bureaucracy can be correctly solved under this slogan,
 which may cause the situation to change from bad to worse.
 An Erroneous Tendency To Get Rid of Party Leadership
 The "struggle for democracy and freedom" reflects an erroneous tendency of a
 small number of people attempting to get rid of party leadership.   This is
 something that deserves our attention.
 The CCP represents the interests of the Chinese proletariat and is a leading
 body serving the cause of the Chinese revolution.   Socialist modernization and
 socialist democratization cannot proceed without communist party leadership.
 Without party leadership, the four modernizations program might deviate from the
 socialist course; any democracy divorced from party leadership cannot possibly
 become a socialist democracy.   True, the road that has been traversed by our
 party is not a straight one. It has scored successes and made mistakes.   Such mis-
 takes have resulted mainly from the implementation of the "leftist" guiding thought,
 which has caused our party's prestige to drop.   But we must adopt a materialist
 attitude in this connection so that we can sum up experiences and lessons, elimin-
 ate the "leftist" ideological influence, and strengthen and improve party leader-
 ship.           We should not adopt a negative attitude toward everything.  We should not
 take a gloomy view of the achievements we have scored during the past 31 years
 since the founding of the PRC, or a skeptical attitude toward the ability of our

 party to lead.  Moreover, we should never allow people to use the slogan of
 democracy and freedom as a device to weaken, abandon, abolish or oppose party
 leadership. Since the Third Plenum, our party has summed up both the positive
 and negative aspects of our experiences and lessons since the founding of the
 PRC and has adopted a policy of "carrying forward socialist democracy and streng-
 thening the socialist system," thus pointing out the correct path for the
 institutionalization and legalization of socialist democracy, for building a
 socialist legal system on the basis of socialist democracy and for using the
 socialist legal system to protect socialist democracy.   This policy is entirely
 correct.   Through the implementation of this policy, our party and state have
 taken the initiative to reform the leadership system and have proposed a series
 of measures to change the system of substituting the party for the government,
 for abolishing the cadre life-tenure system, for appointing basic level leaders
 through election, for extending the direct election of deputies to the people's
 congresses to the county level, for expanding the power of self-determination
 delegated to enterprises and production teams, for restoring and improving the
 trade union congresses, and for expanding and upholding the autonomous power of
 minority nationalities.
 This means that the democratic life in our country has been gradually restored
 and improved.  Those who pay close attention to the objective facts will see that
 as long as we uphold party leadership and continue to enforce this policy, we can
 certainly improve our democratic system step by step and enhance the healthy
 development of political democracy as a strong guarantee for the realization of
 socialist modernization in our country.   In contrast, if we were to abandon party
 leadership, if we were to permit other individuals and groups to lead us, and if
 we were to allow them to "fight for democracy and freedom" in this way, what out-
 come could we expect of such "a struggle"?  In that case, could the current hard-
 won political situation of stability and unity continue to prevail?  Could the
 democratic rights of the broad masses of people be preserved?  In that case, in
 what direction would our society be led?  We must guard against those elements
 who desire to see the world plunge into chaos and who deliberately attempt to take
 advantage of this erroneous slogan. Democracy and freedom have been viewed by some
 individuals as a promise of unrestricted and unrestrained movement. Do they want
 to "struggle" for such unrestricted democracy and freedom?  Unrestricted and
 absolute democracy does not exist in the world.   Democracy is a political system
 which always serves the economic base.  Democratization of political life is
 designed to enhance socialist modernization.   Today if we were to dissociate our-
 selves from the historical mission of socialist modernization, the existence of
 democracy would become meaningless, democracy itself would lose its purpose,
 conflict with the basic interests of the laboring people and become a force
 obstructing social progress.   "Absolute freedom" for certain individuals means
 encroachment on the freedom of others.  For this reason, the "absolute freedom"
 publicized by the bourgeoisie "serves only bilateral or multilateral interests."
 Since the socialist cause is a collective undertaking of the people in our country,
 it must embody democracy, centralism, freedom and discipline.   Unrestricted freedom
 means anarchism and extreme individualism, which tend to undermine the political
 situation of.stability and unity and dim the prospect for the smooth development
 of socialism.

 To realize socialist modernization, we must uphold the four basic principles
 under the party leadership as a prerequisite for improving the socialist demo-
 cratic system, and develop a political situation characterized by centralism and
 democracy, discipline and freedom, unity of wills, happiness and liveliness.  No
 one can disregard party leadership and the four basic principles in the "struggle
 for democracy and freedom."  To do so would make it extremely difficult to carry
 out the further readjustment of the economy and to bring about greater political
 stability.

 ARTICLE AFFIRMS SOCIALISM IS 'ONLY CORRECT PATH'
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 10 Mar 81 p 3
 [Article by Lu Zhiyin [6424 4249 7299]:   "Where Are the Differences?"]
 [Text]   In recent days, we have frequently been perplexed by a number of seemingly
 shallow questions.   For example:
 Comparatively, which era is closer to the ideal socialist society:   the era before
 liberation or the era after liberation?
 Again comparatively,  in which era would the people feel it to be more difficult
 to realize the ideal socialist society:   the era before or the era after libera-
 tion?
 It is certain that no 7- or 8-year-old pupil would turn in a blank paper in
 response to such questions.   But what perplexes people is that these questions
 have become very complicated since they are linked with the reality of the day.
 Why were millions upon millions of revolutionary forerunners of the democratic
 revolution period willing to shed their blood, lay down their lives, advance wave
 upon wave, and fight heroically in quest of beautiful socialist?   (Although there
 were those who lagged behind, scums and hoodlums among them, countless indomitable
 heroes performed deeds that moved people to songs and tears!)  At that time,
 socialism--not to mention communism--seemed a goal beyond reach.   But in the minds
 and eyes of the people, it was not too far off.  That is why they were willing,
 without the slightest hesitation, to sacrifice their lives!
 Today as we are on the march toward the four modernizations, working out daily
 routine schedules for building and realizing socialism, why do some people, es-
 pecially those who claim to know the full truth of human life through exploration--
 excuse me for pointing them out frankly--suddenly become dismayed and heave a
 loud sigh of grief to signal that the future is hopeless?   (Of course, there are
 also forward-looking and talented people who constitute the cream of our nation.)
 Is it true that life under socialism today is more difficult than when the three
 big mountains weighed down on the backs of the Chinese people?  Through a long
 period of lingering at the crossroads and hard struggle, the Chinese people,
 suffering from internal strife and external aggression, have come to understand

 that the socialist road is the only correct path they can choose because all other
 roads lead to blind alleys; the CCP leadership is the only correct leadership be-
 cause experimentation by all other political parties and groups failed.   Rather
 than losing their confidence and venting a sigh of grief, the revolutionary people
 cleansed their wounds and continued to move forward again after suffering from
 the mass counterrevolutionary massacre of "12 April" 1927.
 True, during the 10 years of catastrophe, under the camouflage of the most
 "revolutionary" slogans, Lin Biao and the "gang of four" peddled the most reaction-
 ary trash of feudal fascism, thus completely distorting the good name of socialism.
 But in cleaning up dirt today, we cannot throw away socialism simply because it
 was once tarnished by Lin Biao and the "gang of four."
 The ultimate realization of the socialist ideal is a long and difficult process.
 As a result of experimentation by nearly 1 billion people in our vast country
 and through their continuing probing, socialism is moving forward step by step
 toward perfection.   But some people feel that today socialism remains far from
 perfect and therefore is not a cause for which they must fight.   This state of
 mind is a matter of concern to us.
 There are also some people who feel that life today is more difficult than yester-
 day, and seemingly represents a retreat to the society of the 1920's or the 1930's.
 To them,  I want to say that the crux of the problem that affects our stand lies in
 an answer to the following question:   Should we look coldly from the sidelines
 at everything and point fingers of blame at this and that or should we valiantly
 join the ranks of people struggling tirelessly to change the features of our
 country?
 "The establishment of our socialist system has opened the road leading to the ideal
 society of the future, but to translate this ideal into reality needs hard work."
 This remark made by Comrade Mao Zedong in the 1950's can help us analyze these
 questions.   If we as masters of our own country do everything on a solid basis,
 socialism can become an object that can be reached in the not too distant future and
 without too much difficulty.   Otherwise, if we look at everything coldly from the
 sidelines and if we hesitate to move forward, we must remember this popular saying:
 Tasty cookies will never fall into our mouths automatically.

 Companies of a Certain Guangxi Border Defense Division Builds Enemy Forces  Study
 Room; Training and War Preparations Make New Progress;   Combat Capabilities
 Clearly Increased"]
 [Text]  Delegates to the on-site conference that was recently convened by the
 Guangzhou Military Command visited the enemy forces study room built by frontline
 companies of a certain Guangxi border defense division.  The room aroused deep
 interest.   The delegates made queries on five topics including 38 cadres and
 soldiers in two companies, the pattern of activities of the enemy being faced,
 characteristic tactics, the table of organization and equipment and distinguishing
 characteristics of the terrain for friend and foe, and opportunities to shout
 propaganda on the battlefield.  Replies to all queries were very good in a 100
 percent success rate, and an 87.7 percent excellence rate.   The delegates said,
 "If all the forces knew the enemy and knew themselves this well, they could fight
 a hundred battles without danger."
 This border defense division's frontline company enemy forces study room was built
 from the lessons of experience gained in self-defense counterattack combat against
 Vietnam, and with the needs in mind of guarding the border and countering enemy
 attacks.   The study room contains a large quantity of data about the enemy obtained
 and compiled by cadres and soldiers through various channels such as observation
 and investigation.   There are maps showing enemy deployments that have been plotted
 with the help of professional units at the divisional and regimental level, maps
 of defense fortifications, and sand tables used for study of the enemy situation.
 Cadres and soldiers frequently analyze the enemy situation here and discuss tactics,
 for new advances in the training and war preparations of companies in the frontline
 of border defense.   Combat capabilities have shown clear improvement, outstandingly
 fulfilling the combat mission of defending the border and resisting the enemy.
 Acting in coordination with the militia, since June last year they have smashed
 eight enemy harrassing attacks, infiltrations, and reconnaissance actions, force-
 fully striking the enemy.

 NEW APPLICATIONS OF TRADITIONAL MILITARY TACTICS URGED
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 16 Feb 81 p 1
 [Article by Special Commentator:   "Need To Develop Traditional Military Tactics.
 Talk Number 6 on the Triumph of Weakness Over Strength"]
 [Text]  During the long period of revolutionary struggle, our military forces
 have developed a set of traditional military tactics whereby the weakly armed
 can overwhelm a superior enemy.   This is a crystallization of blood and fire.
 Under current historical conditions, these tactics  doubtlessly complement the
 inferior equipment of our forces, and constitute a powerful weapon whereby our
 forces can triumph over strength from a position of weakness, which history will
 forever record as its contribution. Right up  until the present day its basic
 principle is still applicable and has lost none of its brilliance.
 However, the strengths of military forces change and the rules of war change too.
 Any military expert possessed of foresight and sagacity will not confine his
 thinking to the smoke of already expended gunpowder, and even if he looks back at
 the wars of yesterday, it will be for the purpose of exploring ways to deal with
 tomorrow's wars.   He will aim toward developing and giving form to his tactical
 vision.   Let us look at some generally acknowledged classical views:
 "The guiding laws of all warfare develop out of the development of history, and
 develop out of the development of warfare; nothing is immutable."--Mao Zedong.
 "The methods produced by certain situations (meaning warfare--the author) become
 easily outmoded because situations change unconsciously, but the methods themselves
 do not change.   Theories must, through clear and rational criticism, guard against
 use of such outmoded methods."--German military theoretician, von Clausewitz.
 In conventional warfare, "one must get rid of habitually used methods, and make a
 thorough study anew.   ...if one continues to hold fast to conventions,  this can be
 very dangerous."--French tactician, Andeli Luofeer [phonetic]
 The above citations have been made for no purpose other than to explain a prin-
 ciple:   As warfare develops, so must conventional tactics develop. This is a major
 condition in which inferiority can triumph over superiority.

 Take for example, "Concentrate superior manpower to annihilate the enemy one by
 one," which is a traditional combat principle of our forces.   The fighting in
 which our forces engaged on many fronts north and south for several decades was
 also done in accordance with this principle. The nub of the 10 great military
 principles that Comrade Mao Zedong summarized followed this same principle.   In
 future wars against aggression, this principal is likewise applicable.   However,
 we must clearly realize that modern warfare is far different from the warfare of
 the past, and unless this combat principle is developed and unless new ways of
 doing things are adopted on the bases of changes that have already occurred in
 both the enemy and ourselves instead of mechanical application of a principle,
 victory in battle can by no means be assured.   In the concentration of military
 forces, for example, the present is greatly different from the past.   In alsitua-
 tion in which the enemy possesses tanks, armored vehicles, and modern weapons and
 equipment, superiority means more than a simple comparison of troop strength; it
 also means a comparison of firepower.   In the employment of firepower, one must
 also give attention to enemy atomic weapon attacks, and achieve dispersal of
 weapons but a concentration of firepower.   In the deployment of troops,  in depth
 echelon dispositions have to be made in order to bolster both the tenacity and
 flexibility of defensive  positions, and to buttress assault strength in an attack.
 All of this may be said to be a development of the original content of "concentrate
 superior military forces to wipe out the enemy one by one."
 Other examples are close combat and night combat, which are strengths our forces
 possess for avoiding the enemy in the traditional combat tactics of using in-
 feriority to overwhelm superiority.   In future warfare, they will continue to be
 major techniques whereby we overwhelm the enemy to win victory, and they must be
 carried on.   The problem is that the situation has greatly changed.   Unless we keep
 development in mind and not become bogged down in the close combat of the past in
 which it was "don't shoot at less than 50 meters," or the night combat rule of
 "lift your feet high and put them down gently," to match the enemy's highly
 modernized weapons, great grief is bound to ensue for us.   Currently the mobility
 of major combat protagonists is very great, so for close combat we must study the
 problem of how to approach the enemy.   They have already heavily equipped   their
 military units with night-sighting and illumination devices.   In our night fightin
 it is necessary, first of all,  to have a set of methods for dealing with the
 enemy's night-sighting devices.   Furthermore, our night fighting will henceforth
 positively not be the small group raids of the past, but rather fairly large
 tactical movements.   Consequently, the problems of coordination of all branches
 of service for night fighting, and organizational command for continuous fighting
 both day and night require our conscientious exploration.
 Mobile warfare is a traditional form of combat that has been with our forces for
 several decades.   In the past we engaged in mobile warfare by advancing with great
 strides and by retreating with great strides to constantly change the military
 situation,  to wear down the superior equipped enemy, and bring about numerous
 combat successes in which inferior strength triumphed over superior strength.   In
 future wars, faced with adversaries whose air and land firepower and mobile capa-
 bilities greatly exceed our own, we must look squarely in the face the reality of
 "not being able to take great strides," and while deciding on the combat principle
 of mostly positional warfare, we must study some mobile combat methods that rely
 on positions or not being far from positions.   This is an improvement and develop-
 ment of the traditional mobile warfare of the past.

 We have still numerous other traditional tactics, some as large as principles for
 combat and others as small as precise methods for a particular form of warfare, but
 none can be applied mechanically in disregard of specific conditions or applied
 without consideration of changing circumstances.   They can only be flexibly employed
 with attention given to their development.   In the words of the famous general Qi
 Jiguang [2058 4949 0342], who resisted the Japanese, "Study intentions rather than
 cover tracks."
 Since the very first time our forces took up arms and began to fight, combat has
 been essentially the use of inferior strength against superior strength.   This is
 to say that the enemy's superiority and our inferiority in arms and equipment has
 been a fact that has continued down to the present, and will continue for a con-
 siderable period of time.   Moreover, on the warfare track, the disparity between
 enemy superiority and our own inferiority has not narrowed as history has pro-
 gressed.   For reasons known to all, we have fallen behind in several respects during
 the past several years, and the disparity between superiority and inferiority in
 arms and equipment has, to a certain extent, not narrowed but rather increased
 over the past.   This only increases the urgency of our study of the problem of van-
 quishing superior strength with inferior strength.  We do not deny that for a period
 of time others will own advanced arms and equipment that we do not own, but ad-
 vanced tactical methods will never be a fixed asset owned by anyone.   We are entire-
 ly capable of figuring out a series of comparatively advanced tactics to counter
 the already widened disparity in arms and equipment suited to the wars of the
 future.
 In speaking of exploring tactics suited to wars of the future, we positively are
 not living in a dream world or conjuring out of thin air, but rather are contin-
 uing and developing traditional tactics.   A look at continuation and development
 shows that if continuation is insufficient under present conditions, then develop-
 ment is even more insufficient.   Because continuation requires rather less exer-
 tion, it contains an element of the ready made, while development, by contrast,
 requires expenditure of great effort and energy, and even taking certain "risks."
 Granted that the reasons for this state of affairs are numerous, but one very
 major one, it is feared, is still the effects of the "two whatevers."  This effect
 permeates every field without regard for military forbidden zones.   Following the
 Third Plenary Session of the 11th Party Central Committee, even though we led dis-
 cussion of the criteria for truth into the field of military training, this was
 only a first step after all, and further probing is required.   Long habituation to
 .the fetters of power, and the pernicuous influence of more than 10 years of Lin
 Biao and the "gang of four" has caused some of our comrades to form a kind of
 "congealing force" characterized by complacency and conservatism, which we should
 by no means underestimate.   "Use the security of the past," to make traditional
 tactics into an immutable article is precisely a manifestation of this "congealing
 force."   In the development of our traditional tactics, what we face first is
 precisely the obstacles of this state of mind.   Unless the old navigation chan-
 nels are dredged,  the warships will be unable to brave the winds and waves.   Un-
 less the effects of the "two whatevers" are eradicated, there can be no smooth
 development of traditional tactics either.
 Tactics, in more ordinary terms, means ways of coping with enemies.   Study of the
 enemy is a fundamental requirement in our reform of tactics.   Therefore, we must

 make every effort to understand better and plomb more deeply our main combat
 adversaries. We must understand not only their arms and equipment, their table
 of organization, their general tactical principles and combat methods, but to
 become even more familiar with their tactical programs and strategic thinking.
 It is not enough simply to understand their past combat history, but necessary as
 well to understand the various military exercises that embody their new strategic
 thinking, deriving therefrom some of the things they are in process of developing.
 It is not enough only to understand the general pattern with which they might
 launch a war; it is also necessary to study the methods and patterns of action
 they would take at different times, in different places, and in launching aggres-
 sion against different countries.  Only in this way can the reform of our tactics
 conform fairly well with reality and seek truth from facts fairly well.  But one
 fault merits attention, and that is that in the content of study, there is much
 that is dead and little that is alive; much that is distant and little that is
 close; much that is general, and little that is specific.  Naturally, dead data,
 the history of distant wars, and general principles and patterns must be under-
 stood and known well.   This is not difficult.   But the living, close, and specific
 things precisely reflect the new circumstances of our major combat adversaries,
 and approach the characteristics of modern warfare.   These are precisely the
 things to which we must give concentrated study in our reform of tactics of using
 inferior strength to overcome superior strength.
 When we speak of the need to reform military training, we are speaking in overall
 terms.  Reform of tactics holds a decisive position in the reform of military
 training.  It is the starting point for the reform of training.  With the reform
 of tactics, some of the content, methods, and even requirements of military train-
 ing will change commensurately in varying degrees, thereby giving impetus to
 innovation in military training.  Thus, it may be said that if reform of tactics
 is taken in hand one has the important end of things in hand, and the game of
 training reform will easily come alive.

 PARTY CHARACTER, DISCIPLINE STRESSED
 Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in Chinese 16 Feb 81, p 1
 [Article by Lu Chengyi [0712 2110 5030] and Feng Langfeng [7458 2597 14961:
 "Stress Party Character, Stress Discipline, Stress the Overall Situation, and
 Stress Zeal; Fine Atmosphere Emerges From Political Discipline Indoctrination
 of Party Cadres in a Certain Division"]
 [Text]  A fine atmosphere of stress party character, stress discipline, stress
 the overall situation, and stress zeal has appeared among party cadres in a cer-
 tain division of the Beijing Command.  This is a heartening outcome of their
 conduct of indoctrination in political discipline.
 After the CCP Committee of this division examined the ideology of party members
 and cadres in two regiments and divisional units, in mid-December last year,
 political indoctrination time and party day were combined, and one indoctrination
 was given to party members and cadres.  First of all, party members and cadres
 were organized for diligent study of "On Various Codes For Political Life in the
 Party," and regulations contained in the party constitution pertaining to organ-
 izing principles, as well as guidance materials written by the division's political
 department.   Leading comrades in the division also personally lectured, illuminating
 how communist party members must be models in their observation of party disci-
 pline.   As a result of study, party cadres further defined four points.  The first
 is that communist party members should stress party character; in speech and in
 actions, they must take the party's position. Second is that communist party
 members should stress discipline and unswervingly carry out the organizational
 discipline of "individual subservience to the organization, minority subservience
 to the majority, lower echelon subservience to higher echelons, and party sub-
 servience to the Central Committee."  Third is that communist party members should
 stress the overall situation with individual benefit being subservient to benefit
 to the party.   Fourth is that communist party members should stress zeal, strug-
 gling to realize the party's line.
 After the party cadres' understanding was heightened, all echelons of CCP com-
 mittees aroused everybody to launched criticism and self-criticism integrated
 with practice.   Some comrades had not vigorously examined the party's viewpoints,
 had not made strict political demands on themselves, and had classed themselves
 with ordinary members of the masses.   Some comrades had been weak in their exam-
 ination of political discipline, had discussed in an offhand manner the party's
 line, programs, policies and resolutions, or had even begun from the angle of
 individual advantage, grumbling at slight dissatisfactions and not showing

 understanding of the party's and the country's difficulties.   Still other com-
 rades had been negligent in the examination of their own principles, and when
 encountering words or actions inimical to the welfare of the party, had adopted
 an attitude of "seeking good relations with all and sundry at the expense of
 principle."  Some had listened to and passed on hearsay, and had divulged party
 secrets.  When comrades contrasted their actions with party character and party
 discipline, they realized that the aforestated phenomena were not permitted by
 party discipline, and that they hurt party programs and had to be resolutely
 overcome.
 While this was taking place, division and regimental CCP committees publicized 39
 party cadres including the director of the political department of a certain
 regiment, Zhang Xiaozhong [1728 1321 1813], who had unswervingly carried out the
 instructions of higher echelons and the decisions of the CCP Committee, and deputy
 chief of staff of the division, Wang Zhanwen [3769 0594 2429], who had thrown
 himself wholeheartedly into party work.  They also sternly criticized comrades
 who had violated party discipline, greatly uplifting a healthy atmosphere.
 As a result of indoctrination in political discipline, party cadres throughout
 the division rather well defined the limits between right and wrong.   Whenever
 party members hold dissenting views on party decisions, they may raise them in
 party meetings, but they may not discuss them in an offhand manner to commit the
 error of liberalism.   Party members may have individual views of their own, and
 they have the right to state such views to CCP committees at higher echelons all
 the way up to the Central Committee, but they must strictly observe party disci-
 pline, and carry out the party's decisions.   Party members may be concerned about
 their legitimate personal material welfare, but they positively shall not indulge
 in individualism. All echelons of the party organization and party cadres formu-
 lated, in conformity with requirements of political discipline, measures for
 strengthening party character and for the maintenance of political unanimity with
 the Central Committee.  During the month of January, more than 320 party cadres
 wrote letters home extolling the party's program of readjustment and current poli-
 cies.   Thirty-two cadres who had earlier requested assignment transfers took the
 initiative in seeking out leaders to express willingness to submit to arrangements
 made by organizations.  Filled with political enthusiasm, everyone strives to do
 a good job.

 School Leadership Cadres Themselves Act To Write Investigation Reports; Situa-

 Training"]
 [Text]  The air force headquarters has received a stream of 84 investigative
 reports written by military and political members of aviation schools and ground
 schools.   These investigative reports provided numerous good experiences and
 numerous active suggestions on how to further increase the training ability and
 training quality of air force schools, on how to do a good job of ideological and
 political work, and on the building of a corps of teachers, on cadre work, on
 flying safety, aircraft maintenance work, and administration and management.
 During the past year, some air force school leadership cadres have probed
 realities and gone down to the grassroots, energetically encouraging the practice
 of conducting investigations and studies.  Wang Zhongqi [3769 6988 3823],
 director of a certain flying school has gone down to three flying regiments, and
 six flying squadrons and theoretical training offices where he has used the
 methods of going along on flights to make inspections, symposiums to gain under-
 standing, inspection of lesson plans, and inspection through attendance at
 classes.   He conducted investigations of 176 flying instructors and cadres, and of
 54 instructors in flying theory, one by one and item after item, and wrote,
 "Investigative Report on Enhanced Building of an Instructor Corps."  The director
 of a certain flying school, Lei Yutian [7191 7183 3944] wrote, "Investigation of
 the Training Capacity of the Third Regiment of My School," and "Investigation of
 Reform of Machine Maintenance at My School."  These provided positive ideas and
 suggestions for command methods to improve training organizations, to increase
 aircraft utilization rates, to tap potential for various kinds of safeguarding
 work, and for further improvements in the system of mechanical maintenance.   The
 investigative report written by Teng Yuanxing [7506 0337 5281], director of a
 certain flying school, titled, "On How to Improve Quality of Fighter Aircraft
 Special Technical Training," and the investigative report written by Liu Shuzhi
 [0491 2885 1807], director of a certain flying school, titled, "In Carrying Out
 the 'Thousand Point System," Quality Is the Key"  provided concrete methods for
 improving quality of student training.  The political commissar of a certain air

 gated real problems existing in the work of schools, and wrote investigative
 reports detailing situations, providing analyses, and containing means for solu-
 tion, which provided very good impetus to educational training in the schools.

 [Article by Yu Kuan [1937 1401 2556 2651]:   "When Training Funds Are Cut, How
 Can Troops Be Trained Well?                Airmen of a Certain Division Find A Way Through
 Scientific Arrangements and Strict Organization"]
 [Text]   When training funds and material equipment are reduced, how can troops
 be trained well?  The way it was done by airmen in a certain air force division
 was as follows.  They sought a means in the scientific training of troops, organ-
 izing every flying day and making fullest use of every flying hour.
 This division organized pilots for diligent study of theory, and launched tech-
 nical study, while at the same time employing ground training devices and various
 substitute instruments to give simulation training, increased training time and
 frequency, gave repeated training on difficult points, emphasized frequent train-
 ing, and solved some problems before taking to the air to lay a fine foundation
 for proficient flying in the air.   The course in night flying at a certain regiment
 was fairly tough for new airmen.   But because the number of times each pilot was
 trained in training devices on the ground was increased for proficient mastery of
 the essentials of various data and actions, which overcome technical difficulties,
 quality of flying in the air could be fully assured.   In the past, excessive fly-
 ing during training was fairly common, but no one in the regiment has done exces-
 sive flying since the beginning of training this year, yet tested achievements are
 exc el lent.
 'Phis division has also given attention to improving organizational planning for
 training, and has made rational arrangements in training courses, which have in-
 creased the utilization rate of every flying day.   Formerly the regiment devoted
 45 minutes to each of three courses in medium altitude special flight techniques,
 low altitude special flight techniques, and flights through clouds.   Now they have
 combined the three courses into a single flight requiring only 45 minutes in total.
 Because actions required for all are related and easily mastered, achievements are
 rather good.   For courses of fair difficulty that have not been fully mastered,
 they first organize comrades with good technique for make pilot flights to blaze
 the way, after which they begin general training in order to avoid detours.  A
 certain regiment flew attacks at water level, and close formation flying through
 clouds during January.  As originally planned, the entire regiment was to have
 done this same training at the same time.   But they analyzed pilot technical

 skills and the difficulty of the courses, deciding that simultaneous conduct of
 the courses offered no real promise of success, and quality could not be assured.
 So they changed the plan.   They first set up four-man test flights by four people
 to gain experience after which the whole regiment participated, and training was
 smoothly completed within the alloted time.

 "Building Oases in the Desert; Developing Pastoral Area Production;
 A Certain
 Division Helps Herdsmen of Various Nationalities in Area Where It Is
 Stationed
 to Find Water, Build Forests, Exterminate Rats, and Protect Cattle"]
 [Text]  A certain division in the Lanzhou Command is helping herdsmen in the area
 where it is stationed to build oases in the desert and to develop pastoral area
 production.
 In the area where this division is stationed sand dunes roll in all directions,
 and the Gobi extends as far as the eye can see.  The Mongolian, Manchu, Hui, and
 Han masses who live here are mostly engaged in cattle herding.  To build oases
 in the desert, ample water resources are required.  During recent years, the
 division has invested, all in all, more than 90,000 man days of labor to help
 find water and sink wells, build catchments, and construct ditches.   They have
 now helped the local herdsmen build six large reservoirs, have sunk 13 pump-
 driven wells, and have constructed as much as 10,000 meters of aquaducts, so
 that the seven livestock industry brigades around the area where the troops are
 stationed have sufficient water for the development of forestry and for irrigating
 the grasslands.
 Encroachment of sand poses a great threat to grasslands.   This division actively
 organized its troops to plan trees and create forests.   Both inside and outside
 the barracks they built nurseries. Altogether, they helped communes and brigades
 afforest more than 1500 mu, planting more than 1 million trees, and around all
 the grasslands of livestock brigades near the places where the division is
 stationed, a start has been made in construction of a green shelter forest belt.
 Diseases and insect pests are also natural enemies of the grasslands, and in the
 spring and autumn seasons, rat infestations are more severe.  Annually the forces
 organized large numbers of people to help the herdsmen of all nationalities to
 spread poison to exterminate the rats.   The unit's veterinary medicine office
 also frequently sent out prevention and control teams to make a circuit of herd
 teams to give treatments.   Last year, Zongbielie Commune sustained a fairly
 serious natural disaster, and signs of illness occurred in some herds.   After
 receiving the news, the unit sent out medical personnel to help them protect the
 grasslands and to prevent and control illnesses, with the result that this commune
 was able to win high livestock output in a disaster year, and the rate of live-
 stock on hand increased 19 percent over the bumper year of 1979.  The quantity of
 livestock, sheep wool and cashmere sold to the state also substantially increased.

 NUMBER THREE TECHNICAL SCHOOL--At a time of great constriction of capital con-
 struction funds, the Third Technical School of the Capital Construction Engineers
 persevered in hard work and thrift to build a school to assure fulfillment of the
 mission of enrollment of students and teaching.  Personnel throughout the school
 showed the spirit of the Chinese People's Anti-Japanese Military and Political
 College to conduct daily work and teaching activities in the activities building,
 and in the simply constructed one-story buildings.   In order to assure that stu-
 dents would begin their second semester on time, in June last year school leaders
 and everybody else braved the intense heat of summer together to level the site,
 dig footings, and erect a 15 beam activities building to satisfy the needs of 200
 teachers and students for places to eat, sleep, and conduct teaching activities.
 They also organized the instructors to unload lumber, sand, and other construction
 materials by themselves, and after obtaining the agreement of the design institute,
 they organized instructors to draw and revise some of the blueprints, thereby
 saving expenses of more than 28,000 yuan.   [Text]  [Beijing JIEFANGJUN BAO in
