 VIETNAM
 There is still no break in the Paris talks, with the
 North Vietnamese maintaining their position on the
 bombing issue in very hard-line terms.   Street fight-
 ing in Saigon suburbs has subsided, but the Commu-
 nists continue their pressure on the capital through
 a series of intense rocket bombardments.   President
 Thieu has replaced General Loan, a key supporter of
 Vice President Ky, as chief of the national police.
 MAOISTS RENEW DEMANDS FOR "REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE"
 The violent fighting that continues to plague some
 areas of China seems to be fueled by current propa-
 ganda exhortations to "arouse the masses" against
 enemies of the state.
 NEW INDONESIAN CABINET WILL FOCUS ON ECONOMIC RECOVERY
 President Suharto's new cabinet, installed on 10

 NEW EAST GERMAN CHALLENGE OVER WEST BERLIN
 With the introduction of new controls on West German
 travelers and goods transiting East Germany,  the U1-
 bricht regime has taken its most serious step against
 Berlin since the building of the Wall in 1961.
 DISORDER GROWING IN FRANCE
 Although over 9 million of the 10 million striking
 workers have returned to their jobs and the general
 strike has thus virtually ended, the danger of seri-
 ous disorders has increased during the past week.
 CZECHOSLOVAK-SOVIET RELATIONS REMAIN UNEASY
 The fragile "understanding" between Moscow and Prague
 was jarred this week when the Soviet Foreign Ministry
 for the first time formally protested an article that
 had appeared in a Czechoslovak newspaper.
 ECONOMIC REFORM LAGS IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 The Dubcek regime has had to weather the initial
 phase of the political storm before it could begin
 to focus on the problems of economic reform.
 NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE FOR NEW ITALIAN GOVERNMENT
 Negotiations for renewal of the coalition between the
 Christian Democrats and the Unified Socialist Party
 seem likely to be prolonged, and Italy may be without
 decisive government at a time of increased internal
 strains caused by the crisis in France.
 TITO ENDS RIOTS, PROMISES REFORMS IN YUGOSLAVIA
 Tito's promise on 9 June to satisfy student demands
 for jobs and social reform probably will cause fur-
 ther party dissension and temporarily slow up his
 economic reforms.
 NEW TRIBAL UNREST THREATENS EASTERN INDIA
 Hill tribe pressure is forcing the government to con-
 sider establishment of a largely autonomous hill state
 in eastern India.   The government, faced with the
 still festering Naga and Mizo rebellions, can ill
 afford further disruption in the region.

 The French Territory of Afars and Issas,  the former

 UN INCREASES SANCTIONS AGAINST RHODESIA

 CHILEAN COMMUNISTS CONTINUE POLITICAL MANEUVERING

 The North Vietnamese are continuing to take a hard official line on
 the bombing issue at the Paris talks and elsewhere. There are a number of
 indications that they plan to intensify propaganda efforts in support of
 their position, with a particular view toward influencing American public
 opinion.
 The ground war in South Vietnam slackened noticeably during the
 week, but rocket attacks on Saigon increased. Skirmishing around Khe
 Sanh continued amid indications that the Communists intend to raise the
 stakes in that area by augmenting their forces. In the western highlands,
 Special Forces camps remain likely targets for possibly major enemy
 attacks.
 In Saigon, Vice President Ky has responded to the latest blow to his
 power position-General Loan's removal as national police chief--by an-
 nouncing his resignation as director of the People's Self-Defense Force.
 Seemingly persuaded that President Thieu will bypass him on all matters
 of importance anyway, Ky appears resigned to staying in the background
 at least until some issue presents itself on which he might be able to rally
 the senior generals against Thieu.
 In China, the Cultural Revolution has received new impetus from a
 set of "instructions" by Mao Tse-tung published jointly by People's Daily
 and the Liberation Army Journal on 2 June. Subsequent exhortations to
 army officers and veteran party bureaucrats, who now dominate provincial
 governments, to protect the "masses" and respect their "revolutionary
 zeal" are adding further fuel to the violent fighting that continues to
 plague some parts of the country.
 Indonesian President Suharto has put together a new cabinet which,
 while giving a nod to the political parties' persistent calls for greater
 representation, preserves army control over key security ministries and has
 more of the technical expertise vital for getting on with the government's
 first order of business-economic rehabilitation and development.
 The Sato government in Japan, which faces upper house elections
 early next month and is aware of recently emerging, widespread popular
 concern with the US military presence, has abandoned its usual silence on
 the delicate issue of US bases. Official statements last week cautiously
 criticized some aspects of US operations but did not question basic
 US-Japanese security relationships, which Sato himself has reaffirmed in a
 campaign speech.

 VIETNAM
 No break in the Paris talks
 developed during the week as North
 Vietnamese spokesmen continue to
 portray their position in very
 hard-line terms.   Newly arrived
 politburo member Le Duc Tho told
 CBS'  Charles Collingwood that no
 progress in the talks could be
 expected until the US dropped the
 reciprocity issue and agreed to
 an unconditional cessation of the
 bombing.
 On the propaganda front,
 Hanoi is reported to be undertak-
 ing a number of steps to strengthen
 support for its negotiators in
 Paris.   Among them is a plan to
 have such Communist-dominated
 groups as the World Peace Council
 organize speaking tours of the
 US.   Hanoi is also trying to ar-
 range rallies in Paris and other
 .capitals.
 Meanwhile, Vietnamese Com-
 munist propagandists are becom-
 ing more active in defending the
 right of all Vietnamese to fight
 anywhere in their country against
 the allies.   US charges of Hanoi's
 troop involvement in the South
 have pushed them into a more
 openly defensive stance on this
 issue.
 The Communists may also be
 attempting to pressure the
 northern populace for even greater
 sacrifices in support of the war
 in the South.   A Liberation Front
 statement of 11 June affirmed that
 the South Vietnamese people, while
 relying mainly on their own
 strength, also "have the right
 to receive assistance in all as-
 pects from their kith and kin
 northern compatriots."  The state-
 ment claimed, in addition, that
 the "South Vietnamese people to
 date have reserved the right to
 appeal for and receive assist-
 ance in all aspects from their
 friends in the world, including
 assistance in weapons and volun-
 teers.
 Political Developments in Saigon
 President Thieu, in a major
 move against Vice President Ky
 and his followers, replaced the
 still-hospitalized General Loan
 as chief of the National Police
 Force on 9 June.  Although Loan
 has long been an obvious target
 in Thieu's systematic campaign
 to cut Ky down to size, most ob-
 servers in Saigon had not expected
 Loan's ouster to come this soon.
 Thieu's action may have been
 spurred in part by the urgings

 of General Khiem, the new interior
 minister, but its main inspiration
 was probably a determination by
 the ever-cautious President that
 Ky was not as strong as Thieu,
 had previously supposed.   Ky's
 failure overtly to oppose Thieu's
 maneuvers in connection with
 the establishment of the new
 Huong government may have helped
 the President to reach this con-
 clusion.
 Ky thus far seems to have
 accepted quietly this latest blow
 to his political fortunes.   On
 12 June, he resigned as director
 of the people's self-defense
 force
 Ky will probably
 bide his time, looking for a
 clear-cut issue--possibly the peace
 issue--on which he can rally the
 senior generals against Thieu.
 Ky has been careful to avoid
 direct comment on the Paris talks,
 but he has on a number of occa-
 sions emphasized his opposition
 to any compromise with the Com-
 munists.
 Colonel Tran Van Hai,  com-
 mander of the Vietnamese Rangers,
 has been named to succeed Loan.
 Hai is described as an able,
 apolitical officer
 The mayor of
 Saigon, wounded in the accidental
 attack on the police command head-
 quarters last week, has also been
 replaced.   In addition, a new
 commander has been installed for
 the Capital Military District, a
 position previously held by Gen-
 eral Le Nguyen Khang along with
 his command of III Corps.   Khang
 has offered Thieu his resignation
 as III Corps commander, but Thieu
 has not yet acted on it.
 Saigon civilian politi-
 cians are beginning to talk more
 openly about possible negotia-
 tions with the National Libera-
 tion Front.   Former deputy prime
 minister Tran Van Tuyen, in a
 letter to a Saigon paper, has
 declared that the Front, although
 an instrument of the North Viet-
 namese Communist Party, posses-
 ses an army, controls part of
 the country, and must be acknowl-
 edged as a political reality.   He
 reiterated proposals, which he and
 others first put forward some
 months ago, calling for a mili-
 tary conference between Saigon
 and the Front to arrange a truce,
 to be followed by an interna-
 tional political conference to
 settle the war within a broader
 framework of peace in Southeast
 Asia.
 Tuyen's statements follow
 similar remarks made in the US
 by newly appointed Minister of
 State Phan Quang Dan, who said he
 favors talks with the Front aimed
 toward a cease-fire, if not toward

 an eventual coalition.   His com-
 ments have caused considerable
 consternation in Saigon and could
 cost him his job when he returns
 unless he revises them to fit
 the harder government line.
 These issues previously were
 taboo and their open discussion
 caused some persons to be arrested.
 One impetus toward a more candid
 public consideration of talks with
 the Front is almost certainly the
 widespread concern over the pos-
 sible direction of bilateral talks
 between Washington and Hanoi and
 the conviction that the South
 Vietnamese themselves must be
 primarily responsible for deter-
 mining their own future.  Another
 stimulus may be the trend toward
 a greater civilian voice in the
 government, which many local
 politicians have long considered
 to be the prerequisite for ending
 the war through negotiations.
 The War in South Vietnam
 House-to-house fighting in
 Cholon and Gia Dinh has subsided,
 but the Communists continue to
 subject the Saigon area to a
 heavy rocket bombardment. The
 rain of rockets, some of which
 are falling perilously close
 to key installations in the
 main government and business
 part of Saigon, is beginning
 to excite demands by South
 Vietnamese politicians for re-
 taliation against Hanoi.
 Minor skirmishes with
 enemy troops continue to be
 reported on the outskirts of
 Saigon.   These engagements
 largely involve Viet Cong
 local and main force units
 charged with keeping up pres-
 sure by mortar and rocket
 fire and successive ground
 probes.   These troops are be-
 ing supported by an outer ring
 of units from the three major
 Communist divisions in the
 area, the 5th, 7th, and 9th.
 Their apparent mission is to
 conduct harassing attacks
 against outlying allied bases
 to screen the flow of munitions,

 From the time this latest

 on the night of 4-5 May until
 10 June,  civilian casualties
 resulting from the shellings
 and the street fighting have
 been placed at 433 killed
 and 3,660 wounded.   In addi-
 tion, the government's refu-
 gee burden has been increased
 by over 160,000.   The enemy
 paid a heavy price,  losing an
 estimated 10,000 killed in the
 Saigon area during the month
 of May.

 MAOISTS RENEW DEMANDS FOR "REVOLUTIONARY STRUGGLE"
 The violent fighting that
 continues to plague some areas of
 China seems to be fueled by cur-
 rent propaganda exhortations to
 "arouse the masses" against ene-
 mies of the state.   This propa-
 ganda line stems from a set of
 "instructions" by Mao Tse-tung
 published jointly by''Peop'le's
 Daily and the' Liberati-oF -Army
 Journal on 2 June.
 Recent broadcasts from Peking
 and several provinces insist that

 NEW INDONESIAN CABINET WILL FOCUS ON ECONOMIC RECOVERY
 President Suharto's new cabi-
 net, installed on 10 June, has
 been charged with developing and
 executing a five-year economic
 plan and preparing for general
 elections in 1971.
 In constructing the cabinet,
 Suharto has balanced the demands
 of his various critics against
 his own desire for expertise and
 has produced a government that
 is more competent than its prede-
 cessor.   Suharto reduced the num-
 ber of military members, slightly
 increased party representation,
 and put most technical posts in
 capable nonparty hands.
 The new government, which
 has thus far drawn little criti-
 cism, is composed of six military
 officers and 17 civilians.   Eight
 of the civilians are party repre-
 sentatives, but four of them hold
 nonportfolio posts that appear
 to carry little influence.   The
 army retains the key security
 posts of defense and internal af-
 fairs.
 An able member of Suharto's
 staff of economic advisers has
 been given the finance portfolio.
 Newly appointed Trade Minister
 Sumitro, a political exile dur-
 ing much of the Sukarno era, is
 also a trained  economist.  Adam
 Malik remains as foreign minister.
 toward economic recovery is es-
 sential for political stability
 and that further improvement must
 be achieved by 1971 when elected
 government is to be reinstituted.
 They hope to initiate a five-year
 development plan next year empha-
 sizing increased agricultural
 production and a rehabilitated
 and expanded infrastructure.
 Work on the five-year plan
 apparently has already begun under
 the direction of Widjojo, the
 head of the National Planning
 Board.   Suharto's appointees to
 the financial and economic min-
 istries and related bureaus have
 been working well together for
 some time and the development
 plan should go forward relatively
 unhampered by interdepartmental
 feuding.
 It now appears that Indo-
 nesia will not receive all of the
 $325 million in economic assist-
 ance from non-Communist donors
 which it had requested for 1968.
 Western Europe and Japan have
 been less generous than origi-
 nally hoped.   Suharto and Widjojo,
 who earlier had reacted with near
 panic when they realized all re-
 quested aid would not be forth-
 coming, now appear to be adjust-
 ing their plans and to be set-
 ting their economic sights on
 1969--the year to move from sta-
 bilization to rehabilitation.

 The seeds of a new Berlin crisis were sown during the week by East
 Germany. The East German parliament passed a series of laws designed to
 underscore Pankow's sovereignty and to solidify West Berlin's status as a
 third political entity. These actions were undoubtedly coordinated in
 advance with Moscow. Passport and visa requirements for West Germans
 desiring to enter East Germany also are intended to emphasize that the
 Federal Republic is a foreign state rather than part of a divided nation.
 These measures will be viewed in Bonn as a further challenge to West
 Germany's claim to represent all Germans. They could affect the Allied
 position in Berlin, which would be weakened in proportion to the degree
 of authority over access assumed by the East Germans.
 President Tito has temporarily defused the student revolt in Yugo-
 slavia, but party factionalism and economic priorities may interfere with
 his attempts to meet "justified" student demands.
 In Belgium, the four-month-old government crisis appears to have
 been resolved following agreement earlier this week between the Social
 Christian and Socialist parties on a program for a new coalition govern-
 ment. It is likely to be headed by Gaston Eyskens, a former prime
 minister and veteran Social Christian leader. The outlook for the new
 coalition is not bright, however, because of the persistent tensions arising
 from the unresolved linguistic dispute.
 The UN General Assembly overwhelmingly approved on 12 June a
 resolution endorsing the nonproliferation treaty and requesting that it be
 open for signature and ratification at the earliest possible date. The US
 and USSR hope to call a meeting of the Security Council in the next few
 days to consider security assurances for nonnuclear countries.

 NIET
 NEW EAST GERMAN CHALLENGE OVER WEST BERLIN
 With the introduction of new
 controls on West German travel-
 ers and goods transiting East
 Germany, the Ulbricht regime has
 taken its most serious step
 since the building of the Wall
 in 1961.
 The imposition of passport
 and visa controls for West Ger-
 mans and West Berliners is de-
 signed further to underscore East
 German sovereignty and at the
 same time to enhance the claim
 that West Berlin is a third po-
 litical entity.
 The new regulations require
 West Germans and West Berliners
 to procure East German visas to
 transit or visit East Germany.
 After 15 July,. West Germans will
 also be required to produce pass-
 ports for such travel.   These
 documents may not include any
 reference to Bonn's claim to  rep-
 resent  all Germans.   The East
 Germans began issuing visas on
 12 June.
 West German Chancellor
 Kiesinger told Allied ambassadors
 on 12 June that the situation is
 serious and that "not just pro-
 tests but countermeasures are
 needed."   At the same time he
 said that it is necessary to pro-
 ceed with caution and realism.
 The chancellor also noted that
 his government had not yet de-
 cided what countermoves could be
 taken by West Germany and the
 Allies.
 In light of recent upheavals
 in Eastern Europe--especially in
 Czechoslovakia--where important
 Soviet interests are at stake,  the
 Soviets have been more inclined
 to back Pankow's assertion of
 sovereignty at Bonn's expense than
 they might otherwise have been.
 Soviet diplomats, in endorsing
 East Germany's previous moves to
 increase its control over West
 German travel, have sought to
 dampen any suggestion of tension,
 instead linking the moves to al-
 leged West German "provocations"
 and emphasizing that Allied ac-
 cess to Berlin will not be af-
 fected.
 Soviet commentary has soft-
 pedaled  the latest and boldest
 East German action, characterizing
 the passport and visa requirement
 as a "routine" measure "fully in
 line with the norms of interna-
 tional law and practice."  Pravda
 on 13 June defended the controls
 as a justified and inevitable re-
 sponse to the pending West German
 emergency legislation.
 The East Germans may have
 been encouraged when the West
 failed to make a strong response
 to earlier bans against travel in
 East Germany by members of the
 right-wing National Democratic Party
 and senior Bonn officials.  The
 extent to which they implement the
 new regulations may be related to
 the intensity of Western reaction.

 DISORDER GROWING IN FRANCE
 Over  9 million of the 10 mil-
 lion striking workers have re-
 turned to their jobs, and the gen-
 eral strike has thus virtually
 ended.    The danger of serious dis-
 orders, however, has increased
 during the past week.   The deaths
 of two workers and a student in
 clashes with police attempting to
 clear strike-bound plants have
 raised tension anew after a period
 of relative calm.
 In the wake of violent dem-
 onstrations protesting police
 "brutality," the government on
 12 June banned all public protests
 until after the parliamentary
 elections and ordered the disso-
 lution of seven extreme leftist
 groups under a 1936 law prohibit-
 ing the formation of combat groups
 and private militia.   These re-
 pressive government moves could
 make the situation even more ex-
 plosive.
 Instead of trying to concil-
 iate the rebellious students and
 workers, the government is con-
 centrating on winning the June
 elections by following a tactic
 of deliberately polarizing po-
 litical forces.   This increases
 the possibility of violent con-
 frontations between the right and
 left, and will make even more dif-
 ficult the solution of basic so-
 cial and economic problems.   De
 Gaulle's strong emphasis on the
 dangers of the "totalitarian en-
 terprise" of Communism together
 with the government's mobilization
 of "civic action" committees and
 the Committee for the Defense of
 the Republic--a group of World War
 II resistance veterans--have given
 new impetus to right-wing forces.
 the government's agreement to
 submit a bill to reimburse those
 whose property in Algeria was na-
 tionalized are intended to rally
 extreme rightists to the regime.
 The French Communist Party
 (PCF) is giving the Gaullists am-
 munition for their anti-Communist
 campaign by reiterating the call
 for a "popular front" government.
 The Gaullists contend that the
 PCF's goal has been to install
 itself in power and that it has
 used the crisis to push toward
 that end.   The party, however,
 initially was largely preoccupied
 with limited economic and politi-
 cal aims.                                                                    Only when the crisis
 mushroomed and De Gaulle appeared
 unable to control it did the PCF
 escalate its demands and thus open
 itself to charges of aiming at
 revolution.
 25X1
 25X1
 Now that De Gaulle again ap-
 pears to be in command, the Commu-
 nists are being more circumspect.
 At this  juncture, the PCF appar-
 ently does not expect the left to
 win a majority in the elections
 but it hopes to capture the lead-
 ership of the left by obtaining an
 impressive margin on the first bal-
 lot.                                           125X1

 CZECHOSLOVAK-SOVIET RELATIONS REMAIN UNEASY
 The fragile "understanding"
 between Moscow and Prague was
 jarred this week when the Soviet
 Foreign Ministry for the first
 time formally protested an ar-
 ticle that had appeared in a
 Czechoslovak newspaper.
 Moscow's note objected to
 the reprinting of a New York
 Times article which alleged that
 Soviet military officials were
 involved in General Sejna's es-
 cape from Czechoslovakia.   The
 note accused the newspaper of re-
 printing the article with the
 "one aim" of disturbing friendly
 relations between the USSR and
 Czechoslovakia.  Virtually de-
 manding the reimposition of cen-
 sorship controls, the note ex-
 pressed the "conviction" that
 the "appropriate Czechoslovak
 organs will take the necessary
 measures" to prevent the appear-
 ance of similar reports.
 The Soviet decision to re-
 vive the issue of press freedom
 at the intergovernmental level
 indicates Moscow's continuing dis-
 satisfaction with the Dubcek re-
 gime's determination to use only
 informal controls on the press.
 The Soviet note was delivered al-
 most simultaneously with the ar-
 rival in Moscow of a Czechoslovak
 economic delegation led by Deputy
 SECRET
 Premier Strougal to continue nego-
 tiations on a large Soviet loan.
 The fact that the delegation left
 two days later without a Soviet
 commitment for immediate aid tends
 to confirm reports that Moscow is
 using the prospect of economic as-
 sistance to force a retreat on the
 issue of press freedom as well as
 to exert influence on the course of
 other reforms.
 As yet, the Soviet press has
 made no move to resume the war of
 words that ended during Kosygin's
 stay in Czechoslovakia.   Soviet re-
 porting of developments in Czecho-
 slovakia continues to be biased, but
 without direct criticism.
 The Soviets continue to exert
 other psychological pressures, how-
 ever.   Preparations may now be com-
 plete for a Warsaw Pact command-
 staff exercise in Czechoslovakia.
 The exercise was announced three
 weeks ago. The Czechoslovak Defense
 Ministry has issued numerous press
 statements intended to allay do-
 mestic fears that the USSR will use
 the exercise to cover military in-
 tervention.   These statements stress
 that only a "minimum" number of So-
 viet troops will take part and that
 they will leave Czechoslovakia on
 conclusion of the exercise, which
 is to last several days.

 ECONOMIC REFORM LAGS IN CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 The Dubcek regime has had to
 weather the initial phase of the
 political storm before it could
 begin to focus on the problems of
 economic reform.
 Dubcek cannot yet afford to
 identify himself with an economic
 program that may risk alienation
 of any of his supporters, however.
 The Czech political situation has
 not yet been stabilized, and the
 economic future is so uncertain
 that he would be foolish to tie
 his hands with a detailed program.
 Central to Czechoslovak eco-
 nomic plans is  the question of
 the availability of foreign cred-
 its.   Czechoslovakia continues to
 seek credits primarily for the
 purchase of Western technology
 and for short-term assistance in
 maintaining the consumers' stand-
 ard of living.  Amid constant re-
 ports of credit feelers in the
 West, Czechoslovak Deputy Premier
 Lubomir Strougal went to Moscow
 10 June for a continuation of
 talks on long-term Soviet-Czecho-
 slovak economic cooperation.   A
 major topic of discussion prob-
 ably will be a sizable foreign
 currency credit that Prague is
 seeking from Moscow.
 Meanwhile, the impatient re-
 formers led by Deputy Premier Ota
 Sik continue to complain about
 the slow progress in spelling out
 a new economic policy.   They cite
 the failure to phase out ineffi-
 cient firms and to do away with
 central control of the economy.
 The comprehensive study of the
 economy promised by Dubcek's ac-
 tion program has yet to be pub-
 lished, nor has a progress report
 been made.
 Nevertheless, two major deci-
 sions have been made recently,
 neither of which had been included
 in the original economic reform
 of the Novotny regime.  The first
 involves the establishment of
 workers' councils, which are to
 manage certain enterprises.   The
 second downgrades the role of the
 industrial trusts, which had been
 deemed central to administrative
 efficiency and the success of the
 original economic reform.  Now,
 however, enterprises and firms
 will not be obligated to associate
 with the trusts.
 Other limited measures toward
 economic reform also have been
 taken this year.   These include
 the continued closing down of un-
 economic mining operations, the
 introduction of new management
 principles in agriculture, and the
 recent cutback  in 1980 goals for
 the production of electric power,
 steel, and coal.   In a related de-
 velopment, labor unions are slated
 to have "real" power to represent
 workers'  interests:   they will
 elect candidates for political of-
 fices and will promote legislation
 beneficial to workers.

 NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE FOR NEW ITALIAN GOVERNMENT
 Negotiations for renewal of
 the coalition between the Chris-
 tian Democrats, Italy's largest
 party, and the Unified Socialist
 Party  (PSU), which has been the
 junior partner in recent years,
 seem likely to be prolonged.
 Italy may thus be without deci-
 sive government for some months
 at a time of increased internal
 strains caused by the crisis in
 neighboring France.
 The PSU decided to withdraw
 from the government after suffer-
 ing losses in the parliamentary
 elections of 19-20 May.   Both
 the Christian Democrats, the co-
 alition leaders, and the Commu-
 nists, the chief opposition
 party, gained seats.   Although
 the PSU right wing did better
 than the left wing in the elec-
 tion., the left wing has acquired
 leverage as a result of threats
 by some of its leaders to force
 a party split.   These leaders
 insist they will leave the PSU
 unless it gets convincing com-
 mitments from the Christian Demo-
 crats for action on long-promised
 reforms involving the universi-
 ties, taxation, and administra-
 tive red tape before joining any
 new coalition.
 Christian Democratic Secre-
 tary General Mariano Rumor on
 11 June failed in what Socialist
 sources described as his final
 attempt to persuade the PSU to
 join a new coalition.   A minority
 government now may be formed
 with Rumor or another leading
 Christian Democrat as premier to
 govern at least until the PSU
 congress next October.   Such a
 government would need PSU par-
 liamentary support because the
 Christian Democrats would find
 the alternatives of extreme
 rightist or extreme leftist sup-
 port politically infeasible.
 The formation of even a minority
 government may take some time
 because the Socialists are likely
 to seek the maximum possible
 Christian Democratic commitment
 to reform before promising their
 support.
 Meanwhile, widespread stu-
 dent agitation, which began last
 November and has been fostered
 by the recent unrest in France,
 is continuing.   It is still pri-
 marily directed toward reform of
 the archaic education system,
 although it has had some politi-
 cal overtones.
 The students in Italy, how-
 ever, unlike those in France, are
 not likely to find effective al-
 lies in economic interest groups.
 Italy's orthodox Communists, more-
 over, are generally unwilling to
 endorse student agitators.   Never-
 theless, the unrest in the univer-
 sities could spread to social and
 political groups if effective re-
 forms are delayed by protracted
 Christian Democrat - Socialist
 negotiations.

 TITO ENDS RIOTS, PROMISES REFORMS IN YUGOSLAVIA
 Tito's promise on 9 June to
 satisfy student demands for jobs
 and social reform probably will
 cause further party dissension.
 In order to deliver on his promise,
 Tito will somehow have to reconcile
 the competing interests of older,
 ill-educated party members and the
 students who want their jobs.   A
 review of existing investment prior-
 ities will be necessary and, if stu-
 dent demands for jobs are to be met
 quickly, a temporary slowdown in
 the economic reform may result.
 The riots of 2 and 3 June
 broke out following student accusa-
 tions of police brutality during a
 minor fracas in Belgrade.   By the
 time the riots stopped, some 60
 persons had been injured, some
 $120,000 in property damage had
 occurred, and the students had oc-
 cupied numerous university premises.
 Regime efforts to regain control
 through party organizations and
 fronts were successfully countered
 by the students, who set up ad hoc
 student action committees and vowed
 to sit in until their demands were
 met.   The regime managed, however,
 to prevent the students from making
 common cause with workers harboring
 economic grievances.
 The student demands originally
 were relatively narrow and included
 greater participation in adminis-
 tering the university, more finan-
 cial aid to education, and improved
 employment prospects after gradua-
 tion.   The protests soon took a
 political turn, however,  and widened
 to embrace social inequality,  the
 income gap between workers and
 administrators, the lack of democ-
 racy,   and the incompetence of
 many officials.   The rebels also
 called for the dismissal of those
 responsible for permitting alleged
 police brutality.
 Tito's speech on 9 June
 acknowledged the legitimacy of
 most of the students' grievances
 and promised that a party program
 dealing with them as well as cur-
 rent economic problems would soon be
 forthcoming.   Despite his concilia-
 tory approach, however, Tito was
 firm in stating that no opposition
 to the new program would be toler-
 ated.   His implication that he and
 other leaders should quit if they
 could not solve Yugoslavia's prob-
 lems probably was meant more as a
 warning to others in the party
 hierarchy than as a personal threat
 to resign.  Tito also warned the
 students to beware of efforts to
 infiltrate their movement by Ran-
 kovic conservatives, Djilas lib-
 erals, and followers of Mao Tse-
 tung.
 The crisis further dramatized
 the divisions within the already
 badly fractured Yugoslav Communist
 Party.   Conservative hard liners,
 particularly in the Serbian party
 and police apparatus, adopted a
 tougher stance toward the students
 than did the rest of the regime.
 Tito undoubtedly will intensify ef-
 forts to remove some of these hard
 liners from the middle and lower
 levels of the party,  and the secu-
 rity chiefs in Belgrade and Serbia
 may be sacrificed to placate the
 students.   Widespread changes in
 the party and government leader-
 ships probably will await the 9th
 party congress in December, how-

 As fighting continues in the Nigerian civil war, domestic pressures are
 mounting on the UK to halt arms shipments to Lagos. Arms shipments
 have already been suspended by the Netherlands. The British Government
 is resisting these pressures while trying to persuade federal and Biafran
 representatives now in London to reopen peace talks. Lagos, however, has
 reacted to the possibility of a decreasing availability of arms by stepping
 up air and sea shipments in an effort to create a large stockpile of
 munitions and equipment.
 Tanzania and Zambia were the only UN members besides Albania and
 Cuba to vote against the nuclear nonproliferation treaty this week. Their
 position was undoubtedly affected by Communist China's agreement to
 construct the Tan-Zam railroad. Tanzania's vote will also ensure a red-
 carpet reception next week when President Nyerere visits Peking again in
 search of additional military and economic aid.
 Israeli and Jordanian forces continue to exchange shots across the
 Jordan River almost daily. Jordanian officials are fearful of an Israeli
 strike against the East Bank and have charged that the Israelis are massing
 troops along the cease-fire line. There is no evidence to support this
 charge, but if Jordanian fire kills more Israeli civilians a retaliatory strike
 could be mounted with little or no warning.
 Saudi King Faysal has agreed to finance a $36-million Jordanian arms
 purchase from Britain.
 The Indian Government, unable to put down the Naga and Mizo
 tribal insurgency in eastern India, is now being forced to come to terms
 with demands for local autonomy by the hill tribes of Assam. Concessions
 in Assam could, however, encourage further tribal and linguistic frac-
 tionalization.
 In Turkey, some 30,000 students this week launched a strike to
 demand reforms in the educational system, taking over several university
 buildings in the process.

 NEW TRIBAL UNREST THREATENS EASTERN INDIA
 After two years of equivoca-
 tion, the Indian Government is
 giving urgent attention to the
 possibility of establishing a
 largely autonomous hill state
 within the State of Assam.   Fur-
 ther delay in reaching a decision
 could result in new disorders in
 the already embattled eastern re-
 gion.
 Pressure for the hill state
 comes from the moderate-led All
 Parties Hill Leaders Conference,
 representing tribes in the Garo
 and Khasi-Jaintia districts.   The
 tribes resent domination by the
 Hindu population of the Assam
 Valley, which largely controls
 the state government.
 Unhappy with the government's
 continued vacillation, the con-
 ference recently withdrew its
 nine members from the Assam state
 assembly.   It has also threatened
 to launch a nonviolent action cam-
 paign, which could get out of con-
 trol.  More extreme elements, who
 may be responsible for recent
 bombings of Assam government build-
 ings in Shillong, threaten to take
 over the present conference lead-
 ership if prompt steps toward
 autonomy are not forthcoming.
 The government can ill af-
 ford disorder in the hill dis-
 tricts.   The Naga and Mizo re-
 bellions, in the mountains and
 valleys to the south and east
 of the Assam Valley, already tie
 down some 70,000 Indian troops
 and paramilitary personnel.  Des-
 pite an occasional hopeful sign,
 such as recent evidence of divi-
 sion in the Naga underground,
 there are no prospects for an
 abatement of these rebellions.
 There is thus far no evi-
 dence of Chinese help to other
 tribes, although the Chinese do
 give propaganda support to both
 the Naga and Mizo "struggles for
 independence" and to tribal op-
 position to Indian domination
 in the Assam Valley.   Several
 members of the Indian Communist
 Party (Left) have been arrested
 in the Jorhat area for working
 with Nagas in sabotage activity.
 The Mizos may get some arms as-
 sistance and training in East Pak-
 istan, and they depend on the Chit-
 tagong Hill Tracts for a sanctuary.
 The government must weigh
 the need to forestall new dis-
 ruption in the eastern region
 against the effects of further
 fractionalizing India's states.
 Within Assam, the government's
 willingness to consider autonomy
 for the hill tribes has encour-
 aged similar aspirations by tri-
 bal groups in the plains.   In-
 creased unrest among the plains
 tribes was manifested recently      25X1
 when a mob of 4,000 Boro tribes-
 men attacked a police post in the
 Kokrajhar subdivision.

 GREEK "REVOLUTION" PLODS FORWARD
 A long-rumored cabinet shift
 may be the next step in the slow
 pace of political movement in
 Athens.
 The junta government appears
 capable of moving swiftly to
 counter any threat to its rule,
 and had no trouble spotting and
 apprehending two groups of left-
 ist and centrist plotters.   Former
 premiers Papandreou and Kanello-
 poulos and other political figures
 remain under close guard.   Arch-
 opponent Andreas Papandreou's
 campaign to arouse opposition to
 the regime abroad has had no ob-
 servable effect on the domestic
 scene.
 Some 53 persons were released
 from detention in late May,  for
 good conduct and as a gesture of
 leniency, but over 2,000 accused
 Communists still remain in island
 prisons.
 The government has taken some
 steps in an obvious effort to
 curry favor with various special
 groups.   A large number of agri-
 cultural debts have been canceled,
 apparently gaining the government
 some support among the rural pop-
 ulation--perhaps to the detriment
 of future budgets.   In addition,
 there has been a relaxation of the
 controls on the domestic press, a
 move that has had a mixed recep-
 tion.   Some editors and publishers
 seem to prefer imposed guidelines
 on what they may print rather than
 risking punishment for articles
 subsequently deemed uncomplimen-
 tary to the regime.   Moreover,
 articles of the 1952 constitution
 dealing with the right of assembly
 and association have been reinsti-
 tuted, a move designed to win over
 both domestic and international
 labor circles.
 The junta may have reaped a
 windfall from the civil disorders
 afflicting France,  the US,  and
 other countries.   Some Greeks
 appear to be taking comfort and
 even pride from the conclusion
 that military rule has spared
 them similar disorders.
 The regime is still frus-
 trated and dissatisfied with its
 failure to win full restoration
 of US military aid, but it seems
 able to view its domestic situa-
 tion with equanimity as it pro-
 ceeds stolidly toward the achieve-
 ment of its design for a new
 Greece.

 SOMALIS REFOCUS THEIR ATTENTION ON DJIBOUTI
 After more than a year of
 preoccupation with other political
 problems,  the Somali Government
 seems to be shifting its attention
 again to the French Territory of
 the Afars and Issas  (FTAI), the
 former French Somaliland.   Somalia
 is constitutionally committed to
 bringing the large Somali popula-
 tion of the FTAI--the Issas--into
 a "greater Somalia."   Somali Prime
 Minister Egal's government has
 nevertheless largely ignored the
 territory since the referendum of
 March 1967 in which the majority
 Afars "voted" to keep the FTAI
 under French control.
 The political crisis in
 France, however, has apparently
 raised fears in Mogadiscio that
 should the French grip on the
 FTAI weaken,  the dominant Afars--
 possibly with Ethiopian backing--
 might take the opportunity to
 seize political control to the
 detriment of the territory's
 Somali inhabitants.   Senior gov-
 ernment leaders met in Mogadiscio
 in late May to consider the impli-
 cations of recent reports of pos-
 sible "repercussions" of the
 French crisis in the FTAI.
 The long-standing tensions
 between Ethiopia and Somalia over
 the FTAI had largely subsided as
 a result of Egal's efforts to reach
 a detente with Ethiopia and Kenya.
 Although relations with Ethiopia
 have improved somewhat, the future
 status of the FTAI and its Somali
 population, should the French de-
 cide to depart, remains one of the
 most potentially damaging stum-
 bling blocks in Egal's policy.
 Unlike his predecessor, Egal
 has avoided entangling himself
 with promises to the Somalis of the
 FTAI.   He has preferred the French
 presence there until relations
 with Ethiopia reached a firm foot-
 ing on which some accommodation
 between the two governments might
 be worked out.   He has been
 Although the Somalis'  fears
 seem wholly unjustified by events,
 they have been reinforced by a
 report that Emperor Haile Selassie
 during his brief refueling stop
 in Djibouti early in May, met with
 the pro-French Afar leader of
 the FTAI Government, Ali Aref
 Bourhan.   Although there is no
 confirmation that such a meeting
 took place,  the fact that Haile
 Selassie stopped in Djibouti ap-
 parently was enough to alarm the
 Somalis and increase their sus-
 picions of Ethiopian intentions.

 criticized in Somalia for ignoring
 the FTAI in his detente efforts.
 To counter this criticism, he may
 have hoped to gain some concessions
 from President de Gaulle in May,
 but his trip was postponed because
 of conditions in Paris.
 Egal may have to take on the
 FTAI problem sooner than he would
 like.   Elections to the Chamber of
 Deputies in Djibouti are scheduled
 for November 1968.   The Ethiopians
 are likely to work behind the
 scenes to ensure an Afar victory
 as they did during last year's
 referendum.   This in turn will
 probably produce an appeal from
 the Somali population for assist-
 ance from Mogadiscio.  Egal's re-
 sponse will be carefully watched
 by his opponents, who will be look-
 ing for ammunition to use against
 him in the Somali parliamentary
 elections set for March 1969.
 UN INCREASES SANCTIONS AGAINST RHODESIA
 On May 29 the UN Security Coun-
 cil unanimously passed a resolution
 calling for expanded economic sanc-
 tions against Rhodesia.   The move,
 prompted by increasing African pres-
 sures for actions to bring down the
 Smith regime,  follows more than two
 and one-half years of selective
 sanctions that have so far failed
 to force Salisbury to relinquish
 its independence.
 The resolution's key measure
 enjoins UN member states,  and calls
 upon nonmember states, to end all
 trade with Rhodesia except for mi-
 nor items such as medical supplies
 and educational materials.   The
 resolution also prohibits UN members
 from providing investment capital
 to Rhodesia.   Rhodesian passports
 will no longer be recognized,  and
 states are urged to end all con-
 sular relations with Salisbury.
 The UN action is unlikely to
 have a significant impact on Rho-
 desia's economy and will almost
 certainly fail to bring down the
 Smith regime.   Earlier sanctions
 have slowed economic growth but
 have not caused any major disrup-
 tions.   Previous embargoes had
 already targeted most of Rhodesia's
 potential exports;  the blanket
 sanctions now imposed will there-
 fore not have much additional ef-
 fect.
 Theoretically, the new meas-
 ure's greatest impact will be on
 Rhodesian imports, which until now
 have been only partially covered
 by sanctions.   Rhodesia should be
 able to purchase most of its needs,
 however, because suppliers will
 probably continue to sell suffi-
 cient quantities of goods, either
 covertly or in open defiance of
 the Security Council.
 The Zambian Government can-
 not participate fully in the sanc-
 tions effort without inviting eco-
 nomic disaster.   Without Rhodesian
 coal,  Zambian copper production
 would have to be cut back drasti-
 cally.   Rhodesia can also retali-
 ate by denying Zambia electric
 power or transport for its imports
 and exports, services on which the
 Zambian economy is dependent.   Al-
 though the UN resolution calls upon 25X1
 member states to assist Zambia,
 there is little they can do to sup-
 ply even minimal needs.

 Increasing student unrest and continuing political maneuvering related
 to recent national elections preoccupied the governments of several Latin
 American countries last week.
 Widespread student strikes and demonstrations are again under way in
 Brazil. Police and students clashed in Rio de Janeiro on 11 June, resulting
 in a few minor injuries, and further incidents are likely. In Uruguay,
 Communist-led labor groups joined with students in protesting alleged
 "police brutality" in connection with a police-student confrontation on 6
 June. More serious disorders are possible, and President Pacheco has
 imposed a limited state of siege.
 Argentine students are also disturbing public order. As is the case
 elsewhere in Latin America, the Argentine students are mainly protesting
 what they consider to be antiquated facilities and insufficient provision for
 student participation in school and university government. These com-
 plaints are being used for their own ends by Communists and other leftist
 extremists. In Chile, for instance, such elements have recently strengthened
 their bid for influence within the university reform movement by gaining
 control over a newly formed association of teaching and administrative
 personnel.
 Political restlessness remains high in the aftermath of recent presiden-
 tial and legislative elections in both Panama and Ecuador. Ballot counting
 to determine the composition of Panama's 42-member unicameral legisla-
 ture is slowly going forward amidst an atmosphere of confusion and
 behind-the-scenes attempts to rig the count. In Ecuador, a delay in
 officially confirming the outcome of the presidential race has led the
 apparent victor, Jose Maria Velasco, to warn that "civil war" will result if
 he is denied the presidency.
 In Guatemala, dissension within the Communist Rebel Armed Forces
 (FAR) over commander Yon Sosa's decision to await the completion of
 current training and resupply activities before resuming guerrilla warfare
 operations may provoke their resumption at an early date.
 Guerrillas in western Venezuela ambushed an army convoy on 8
 June, inflicting heavy casualties. News of the encounter, which was the
 first major one in over a month, may be especially embarrassing to the
 Leoni government, which has widely publicized its successes in recent
 operations against such insurgents.                                         25X1
