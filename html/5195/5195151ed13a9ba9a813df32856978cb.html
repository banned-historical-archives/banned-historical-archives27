 EDITOR'S NOTE
 On January 25, 1956 Mao Tse-tung, Chairman of
 the People's Republic of China, called a meeting of
 the Supreme State Conference to discuss the Draft
 National Programme for Agricultural Development
 (1956-1967) which had been submitted by the Polit-
 ical Bureau of the Central Committee of the Com-
 munist Party of China.
 In his address at the meeting Chairman Mao said
 that the country was at that moment witnessing the
 flood tide of the great socialist revolution.  With the
 founding of the People's Republic of China, the
 Chinese revolution had passed from the stage of
 bourgeois-democratic revolution to that of socialist
 revolution.  In other words, it had started the period
 of transition from capitalism to socialism.    The work
 of the first three of the past six years had been con-
 centrated mainly on restoring the national economy
 and carrying out various social reforms - first and
 foremost land reform - left incomplete in the first
 stage of the revolution.  Since last summer socialist
 transformation, that is, socialist revolution, had devel-
 oped on a vast scale with far-reaching results.  This
 socialist revolution, he said, could be completed in the
 main and on a national scale in about three more years.
 The object of socialist revolution, said Chairman
 Mao, was to set free the productive forces of society.
 It was quite certain that the change-over from indi-
 vidual to socialist, collective ownership in agriculture
 and handicrafts, and from capitalist to socialist owner-
 ship in private industry and commerce would lead to
 an ever greater release of productive forces; this laid

 the social basis for an enormous expansion of industrial
 and agricultural output.
 Our method of carrying out the socialist revolu-
 tion, continued Chairman Mao, was a peaceful one.
 In the past many people, both inside and outside the
 Communist Party, doubted if that was possible.  But
 since the great upsurge of the co-operative movement
 in the countryside last summer, and the swelling tide
 of socialist transformation in the towns and cities in
 the past few months, there was no longer much room
 for doubt.
 Conditions in China were such that it was not
 only possible, by using peaceful methods, methods of
 persuasion and education, to turn individual into so-
 cialist, collective ownership, but also to change capi-
 talist into socialist ownership.  The speed of socialist
 transformation in the past few months had been far
 more rapid than anyone expected.  There were people
 who had worried that it would not be easy to get
 through the "difficult pass" to socialism.  It now
 looked, said Chairman Mao, as if this "difficult pass"
 would not be so difficult to get through after all.
 A fundamental change had taken place in the
 political situation in China, he went on.  Up to last
 summer there had been many difficulties in agricul-
 ture, but things were quite different now.  Many
 things that had seemed impracticable were now quite
 feasible.  It was possible to fulfil ahead of time and
 overfulfil the country's First Five-Year Plan. Now
 this National Programme for Agricultural Develop-
 ment for 1956-1967, based on the realities of the great
 upsurge in socialist transformation and socialist con-
 struction, was intended to outline the prospects for
 agricultural production and rural work and set a clear-
 cut goal before China's peasants and all who work in
 agriculture.  A spurt must be made in other kinds

 of work besides agriculture to keep in step with the
 situation arising from this upsurge of socialist rev-
 olution.
 In conclusion, Chairman Mao said that the nation
 must have a far-reaching, comprehensive plan of work
 for the next few decades to wipe out its economic,
 scientific and cultural backwardness and get abreast
 of the most advanced nations in the world.  To reach
 this great goal the decisive thing was trained per-
 sonnel-to have plenty of capable scientists and tech-
 nicians.  At the same time they had to go on
 strengthening and extending the people's democratic
 united front, by uniting all forces that could be united.
 The Chinese people would ally themselves with people
 anywhere in the world to work for the preservation
 of world peace.
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung was followed by Liao
 Lu-yen, Deputy Head of the Department of Rural
 Work of the Chinese Communist Party's Central Com-
 mittee, who made a speech explaining the Draft Na-
 tional  Programme  for  Agricultural  Development
 (1956-1967).
 Then representatives of science, education, indus-
 try and commerce and of the various democratic parties
 made speeches, all expressing their warm support of
 the Draft National Programme for Agricultural Devel-
 opment.  Included in this pamphlet are the full text
 of the Draft National Programme for Agricultural
 Development (1956-1967) and the explanations on the
 programme given by Liao Lu-yen.

 THE DRAFT NATIONAL PROGRAMME FOR
 AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT
 1956-1967
 (Submitted by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee
 of the Communist Party of China on January 23, 1956)
 The great tide of agricultural co-operation that
 has swept China is bringing forth an immense, nation-
 wide growth of agricultural production, and this in
 turn is stimulating the development of the whole
 national economy and all branches of science, culture,
 education and public health.
 To give the leading Party and government bodies
 at all levels and the people of China, particularly the
 peasants,  a  long-term  programme  of  agricultural
 development,  the  Political Bureau of the   Central
 Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, after
 consulting comrades holding responsible positions on
 Party committees in the provinces, municipalities and
 autonomous regions, has drawn up a draft national
 programme outlining the scale of agricultural develop-
 ment during the period 1956-1967 (the last year of
 the third Five-Year Plan).  On a certain number of
 related questions this draft programme also touches
 upon work in the urban areas.  It sets a number of
 important targets for agricultural production. Others
 will be specified in each of the five-year plans and in
 the annual plans.
 This draft is now distributed so that it can be
 studied by the Party committees of all provinces
 (municipalities or autonomous regions), administra-
 tive regions (autonomous thou), counties (autonomous
 counties), districts and hsiang (nationality hsiang),

 as well as by all departments concerned, all of whom
 are asked to submit their views on it.  At the same
 time workers, peasants, scientists and people from all
 walks of life who love their country should also be
 widely consulted.  These views should be collected
 before April 1, 1956, so that the programme can be
 submitted for discussion and adoption by the seventh
 plenary session (enlarged) of the seventh Central
 Committee of the Communist Party of China which
 will be held some time after that date. It will then be
 presented to the state bodies and the people of the
 whole country, first and foremost the peasants, as a
 recommendation.
 Except in some remote areas where democratic so-
 cial reforms have not yet been introduced, every lead-
 ing Party and government body of provinces (munici-
 palities, autonomous regions), administrative regions
 (autonomous chou), counties (autonomous counties),
 districts and hsiang (nationality hsiang) should draw
 up specific plans, based on the present draft national
 programme and taking into account conditions peculiar
 to each locality.  These plans should specify the suc-
 cessive stages of development of every aspect of their
 local work. At the same time all state departments
 concerned with economic affairs, with science, culture,
 education, public health, civic affairs or the judiciary
 should also review and revise their plans of work in
 accordance with the present national programme.
 (1)  Seeing that in 1955 more than 60 per cent
 of all peasant households were in agricultural pro-
 ducers' co-operatives, all provinces, municipalities and
 autonomous regions should, in the main, complete
 agricultural co-operation in its elementary form and
 set themselves the goal of getting about 85 per cent
 of all peasant households into agricultural producers'
 co-operatives in 1956.

 (2)  Areas  where  co-operation  is  on  better
 foundations and where a number of co-operatives of
 advanced form are already functioning should, in the
 main, complete the change-over to co-operation of
 advanced form by 1957. Each district of the remain-
 ing areas should, in 1956, set up and run one or more
 large co-operatives of advanced form (each with a
 hundred or more peasant households) to serve as ex-
 amples; and by 1958 they too should practically com-
 plete co-operation of advanced form.
 In -going forward to the advanced form of co-
 operation certain conditions must be observed: the
 change must be of the free will and choice of the
 members;  the  co-operative  must  have  people  ca-
 pable of giving proper leadership ; and it must be
 possible for over 90 per cent of the members to earn
 more after the change.  When all such conditions in
 the elementary form of co-operatives are ripe, they
 should at different times, group by group, go over to
 the advanced form of co-operation,  otherwise the
 growth of their productive forces will be hampered.
 (3)  Every agricultural producers' co-operative
 must make suitable arrangements to see that those of
 its members who lack manpower, are widows or
 widowers, who have no close relations to depend on,
 or who are disabled ex-service men, are given pro-
 ductive work and a livelihood, so that they have
 enough food, clothing and fuel, can bring up their
 children properly, and see that the dead are decently
 buried, so that they are assured of help during their
 lifetime and decent burial thereafter.
 (4)  During 1956 attempts should be made to
 settle the question of admitting to the co-operatives
 former landlords and rich peasants who have given
 up exploitation and who have asked to join.  This can
 be done on the following lines:  (a)  Those who have

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 behaved well and worked well may be allowed to join
 co-operatives as members and change their status to
 that of peasants.   (b)  Those who have conducted
 themselves neither well nor badly, but have behaved
 fairly well, may be allowed to join as candidate mem-
 bers, with their status for the time being unchanged.
 (c)  Those who have behaved badly the Hsiang Peo-
 ple's Council should allow them to work in the co-
 operatives under supervision; those who have commit-
 ted sabotage should be brought to trial as the law
 directs.  (d)  Whether they acquire the status of co-
 operative member or not, former landlords or rich
 peasants shall not, for a specified time after joining
 a co-operative, be allowed to hold any important post
 in it.  (e)  Co-operatives must work on the principle
 of equal pay for equal work, and pay former land-
 lords or rich peasants in the co-operative the proper
 rate for the work they put in.  (f)  Sons and daugh-
 ters of landlords or rich peasants who were under
 eighteen at the time of the land reform, or who were
 still at school, or who had taken part in work before
 the land reform and had been under the thumb of
 other members of the family, should not be treated
 as landlords or rich peasants, but should be allowed
 to join the co-operatives as members, be reckoned as
 of peasant status, and given work suited to their
 abilities.
 (5)  Counter-revolutionaries in the rural areas
 should be dealt with as follows :  (a) Those who have
 committed sabotage or had committed other serious
 crimes in the past, and against whom there is great
 public feeling, should be put under arrest and dealt
 with in accordance with law.  (b)  Those who com-
 mitted crimes which were commonplace in the past,
 but have not committed sabotage since liberation, and
 against whom public feeling is not great, should be

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 allowed by the Hsiang People's Council to work in the
 co-operative under supervision, to be reformed by
 work.  (c)  Those who have committed minor crimes
 and since made amends, those who have served their
 sentence, been released and behaved well, and those
 who committed crimes but did deserving work in the
 campaign to suppress counter-revolutionaries, may be
 allowed to join the co-operative-some as members, no
 longer regarded as counter-revolutionaries but as
 peasants, and others for the time being as candidate
 members, not classified as peasants-depending on
 what they have done to make amends and what merit
 they have earned.  In no case, however, whether they
 are admitted as members or not, must they be allow-
 ed to take on important posts in the co-operative for
 a specified time after joining.  (d)  Such counter-
 revolutionaries as have been allowed to work in the
 co-operatives under supervision should be paid for their
 work by the co-operative on the principle of equal pay
 for equal work.  (e)  Other members of the families
 of counter-revolutionaries should be allowed to join
 co-operatives, and enjoy the same treatment as any-
 one else without being discriminated against, provided
 they took no part in crimes committed by the counter-
 revolutionaries.
 (6)  In the twelve years starting with 1956, in
 areas north of the Yellow River, the Tsinling Moun-
 tains, the River Pailung, and the Yellow River in
 Chinghai Province, the average annual yield of grain
 should be raised from the 1955 figure of over 150
 catties to the mou to 400 catties.l South of the Yel-
 low River and north of the Huai the yield should be
 raised from the 1955 figure of 208 catties to 500 cat-
 ties.  South of the Huai, the Tsinling Mountains and

 the River Pailung it should rise from the 1955 figure
 of 400 catties to 800 catties per mou.
 In the same twelve years the average annual
 yield of ginned cotton should be raised from the 1955
 figure of 35 catties to the mou (the average for the
 whole of China) to 60, 80 or 100 catties depending on
 local conditions.
 Everywhere vigorous steps should be taken to see
 that output targets set in state plans for grain, cot-
 ton, soya, peanuts, rape, sesame, hemp, cured tobacco,
 silk, tea, sugar-cane, sugar-beet, fruit, tea-oil and
 tung-oil trees, are reached.  Besides this, all areas
 must take more energetic measures to develop all other
 marketable industrial crops.  In large mountainous
 areas vigorous efforts should be made to grow all pos-
 sible marketable industrial crops, provided that they
 not only produce enough food to make themselves self-
 sufficient, but also to build up a surplus against times
 of natural calamities.  In those parts of South China
 where conditions permit, vigorous efforts should be
 made to develop tropical crops.
 Agricultural producers' co-operatives should en-
 courage their members to grow vegetables on their
 own private plots by way of improving their standard
 of living.  Peasants who live on the outskirts of cities
 or near industrial or mining districts should go in for
 market gardening in a planned way so that the supply
 of vegetables to these places can be ensured.
 More medicinal herbs should be grown.  Those
 which grow wild should be protected and, wherever
 possible, gradually brought under cultivation.
 (7)  All agricultural producers' co-operatives, be-
 sides producing enough food for their own consump-
 tion and to meet the requirements of the state, should,
 within 12 years starting from 1956, store enough

 or two years, according to local conditions. All prov-
 inces (municipalities or autonomous regions), adminis-
 trative regions (autonomous chou), counties (autono-
 mous counties), districts, hsiang (nationality hsiang)
 and all agricultural producers' co-operatives, should
 draw up detailed plans to meet this requirement.
 During the same period, the state too should store
 sufficient reserve grain for one to two years for use in
 any emergency.
 (8)  Live-stock breeding should be encouraged.
 Cattle, horses, donkeys, mules, camels, pigs, sheep and
 all kinds of poultry should be protected and bred. Spe-
 cial care should be taken to protect the females and
 young and improve breeds.  State live-stock farms
 should be extended.
 The prevention and cure of. animal diseases is an
 important part of live-stock breeding.  As far as pos-
 sible, all areas should, within a period varying from
 7 to 12 years, practically eliminate the most serious
 animal diseases such as rinderpest, hog cholera, New-
 castle disease, pork measles (cysticercosis), contagious
 pleuro-pneumonia of cattle, foot and mouth disease,
 lamb dysentery, sheep mange, and glanders.  For this
 purpose, within seven years  starting from 1956,
 veterinary stations should be set up in all counties in
 agricultural areas and all districts in pasture areas.
 Veterinary work should be improved and extended.
 The co-operatives should have personnel with basic
 training in the prevention and cure of animal diseases.
 Care should be taken to protect pastures, improve
 and grow grass for cattle fodder and encourage silage.
 Agricultural producers' co-operatives and live-stock
 breeding co-operatives should see that they have their
 own supplies of fodder and grass.
 (9)  There are two main ways of increasing the

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 yield of crops : taking steps to increase production, and
 imparting better techniques.
 (A)  The chief steps to increase production are:
 (a) water conservancy projects and water and soil
 conservation; (b) use of improved farm tools, and
 gradual introduction of mechanized farming;  (c)
 efforts to discover every possible source of manure and
 improve methods of fertilizing; (d) extension of the
 use of the best and most suitable strains; (e) soil
 improvement ; (f) extension of multiple cropping areas ;
 (g) planting more high-yielding crops; (h) improv-
 ing farming methods;  (i) wiping out insect pests
 and plant diseases; and (j) opening up virgin and
 idle land and extending cultivated areas.
 (B)  The chief steps to impart better techniques
 include the following: (a) provinces, municipalities
 and autonomous regions should collect data on the
 experience of the best co-operatives in their own areas
 in increasing yields, compile and publish at least one
 book a year, so as to spread this knowledge as widely
 and rapidly as possible; (b) agricultural exhibitions;
 (c) conferences of model peasants called at regular
 intervals by provinces (municipalities or autonomous
 regions), administrative regions (autonomous thou),
 counties  (autonomous  counties),  districts,  hsiang
 (nationality hsiang), with awards and citations to
 peasants who distinguish themselves in increasing
 production; (d) visits and emulation campaigns, the
 exchange of experience; and (e) imparting technical
 knowledge and encouraging peasants and cadres to
 take an active part in learning better techniques.
 (10)  Water conservancy projects and water
 and soil conservation.  All small-scale water conserv-
 ancy projects (for example, the digging of wells and
 ponds and the building of irrigation canals and dams),
 the harnessing of small rivers and water and soil
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 conservation work should be carried out by local
 governments and agricultural producers' co-operatives
 systematically and on a large scale.  This work and
 the large-scale water conservancy projects and the
 harnessing of the larger rivers undertaken by the
 state should virtually eliminate all ordinary floods and
 droughts in 7 to 12 years, starting from 1956.  The
 engineering industry, commercial undertakings and
 supply and marketing co-operatives should see that
 pumps, water-wheels, steam engines and other de-
 vices for raising water are made available.
 Local governments and agricultural producers'
 co-operatives, basing their work on the unified plan
 for developing the economy of the mountainous areas,
 should wherever possible carry out the water and soil
 conservation work required by agricultural produc-
 tion, live-stock breeding and forestry, so that within
 12 years striking results are achieved and soil erosion
 is, in the main, stopped.
 Within twelve years starting from 1956 small
 hydro-electric power stations should be built where
 water power is available, each of them to serve one or
 several hsiang.  This, alongside the great water con-
 servancy and power projects undertaken by the state,
 will gradually bring electrification to the countryside.
 (11)  Promote new types of farm tools. Starting
 from 1956, within three to five years 6 million more
 ploughs with two wheels and two shares should be
 in use, together with a considerable number of sowers,
 cultivators, sprayers, dusters, harvesters, shellers and
 silage cutters. Good repair services should be main-
 tained.                                    Agriculture will be gradually mechanized as
 the industrial development of the country forges
 ahead.
 (12)  Within twelve years, starting from 1956,
 local governments and agricultural producers' co-

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 operatives in most areas should have made them-
 selves responsible for providing more than 90 per cent
 of all manure and other fertilizers needed-and in
 some places the whole of it.  To work towards this
 position, peasants everywhere should be encouraged
 to do everything they possibly can to increase the
 amount of fertilizer, paying special attention to pig-
 breeding (and in some cases sheep-breeding),  and
 providing adequate green manure crops.  Local gov-
 ernments should take active steps to develop the
 manufacture of phosphate and potassium fertilizers,
 extend the use of bacterial fertilizer (including soya
 bean and peanut root nodule bacteria), and collect and
 utilize to the fullest extent urban waste and manure
 from other miscellaneous sources.  At the same time
 the state will vigorously promote the chemical fertilizer
 industry.
 (13)  Energetic steps must be taken to breed
 and extend the use of improved strains suitable to
 local conditions and encourage work to improve seed.
 Within two or three years starting from 1956 picked
 seed should be in pretty general use for cotton grow-
 ing, and within seven to twelve years the same should
 be true of such important crops as rice, wheat, maize,
 soya, millet, kaoliang, potatoes, rape, sesame, sugar-
 cane, tobacco and hemp.  All agricultural producers'
 co-operatives should set aside land specially for grow-
 ing seed as such.  State farms should make them-
 selves centres for increasing the amount of picked
 seed.
 (14)  Agricultural producers' co-operatives should
 take energetic steps to improve the soil and do every-
 thing they can to turn poor into fertile land.
 (15)  Extend the area of multiple crops.  In
 twelve years starting with 1956 the average multiple
 crop index set for various areas will be raised to the

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 following levels: (a) areas south of Wuling Moun-
 tains, 230 per cent; (b) areas north of Wuling Moun-
 tains and south of the Yangtse River, 200 per cent ;
 (c) areas north of the Yangtse River and south of
 the Yellow River, Tsinling Mountains and River Pai-
 lung, 160 per cent; (d) areas north of the Yellovi
 River, Tsinling Mountains and River Pailung and south
 of the Great Wall, 120 per cent; and (e) in areas north
 of the Great Wall, multiple crop areas should also be
 expanded as much as possible.
 (16)  More high-yield crops should be grown.
 First, the area under rice should be extended, and all
 available water resources used to grow more.  In the
 twelve years starting 1956 the area under rice should
 be increased by 310 million mou, maize by 150 million
 mou and potatoes by 100 million mou.
 (17)  Methods of cultivation should be improved.
 Deep ploughing, careful cultivation, proper rotation
 of crops, intercropping and close planting, sowing in
 good time, thinning out and protecting young plants
 and improving field work-these things must be done
 to bring about good yields and good harvests.
 (18)  In seven or twelve years starting 1956,
 wherever possible, virtually wipe out insect pests and
 plant diseases that do most harm to crops. These in-
 clude locusts, armyworms, rice borers, maize borers,
 aphides, red spiders, pink boll-worms, wheat smut,
 wheat nematode and black rot on sweet potato. Local
 plans should include any other serious insect pests
 and plant diseases that can be wiped out.  Greater
 attention should be paid to plant protection   and
 quarantine measures to achieve this end.
 (19)  The state should reclaim waste land in a
 planned way and extend the area under cultivation.
 Wherever conditions permit, agricultural producers'
 co-operatives should be encouraged to organize branch

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 co-operatives to carry out such reclamation. The work
 should be linked with the general plan of water and
 soil conservation so as to prevent any danger of water
 loss and soil erosion.
 (20)  Expansion of state farms.  The area culti-
 vated by state farms should be increased in the twelve
 years starting 1956 from the 1955 figure of 13,360,000
 mou to 140 million mou.  Vigorous work must be put
 in to improve the running of state farms, to raise
 their output, practise the strictest economy and cut
 down cost of production, so that state farms are the
 models of farming technique and management which
 they are expected to be.
 (21)  In the twelve years starting 1956 we must
 clothe every possible bit of denuded waste land and
 mountains with greenery.  Wherever possible trees
 should be planted in a systematic way near houses,
 villages, along roads and rivers, as well as on waste
 land and mountains.  To achieve that end, agricul-
 tural producers' co-operatives should set up decent-
 sized nurseries of their own to grow saplings, in addi-
 tion to the nurseries started by the state.
 We should plant and tend not only forests (in-
 cluding bamboo groves) for timber, but also other
 trees of economic value such as mulberry and oak (for
 feeding silkworms), and tea-trees, trees for varnish
 and fruit, and oil-yielding groves.
 Afforestation plans should include the creation
 of wind-breaks, sand-breaks and shelter belts to pro-
 tect farmland, the head-waters of rivers, sea coasts
 and cities.
 Local agricultural producers' co-operatives should
 plant and look after trees along railways, roads and
 rivers, and the income derived from this source should
 accrue to the co-operatives. Afforestation work along
 railways and roads should tally with specifications
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 made by the government departments concerned with
 railways and communications.
 Firm steps should be taken to prevent insect
 pests and plant diseases in forests, and to improve
 measures to protect forests and combat forest fires.
 (22)  Energetic steps should be taken to raise
 the output of marine products and develop fresh-water
 fisheries. In the case of sea fishing, more safety
 measures should be adopted and more deep-sea fishing
 done. In the case of fresh-water fish farming more
 should be done to breed good stock and prevent fish
 diseases.
 (23)  If agriculture, forestry, live-stock breed-
 ing, subsidiary rural production, and fisheries are to
 develop to the full, if the national wealth and the in-
 come of the peasants are to grow, co-operatives must
 make fuller use of manpower and raise labour pro-
 ductivity.                                         In the seven years beginning with 1956,
 every able-bodied man in the countryside ought to be
 able to put in at least 250 working days a year.
 Serious efforts should be made to draw women into
 the work of agricultural and subsidiary production.
 Within seven years, every able-bodied woman in the
 countryside should, besides the time she spends on
 household work, be able to give at least 120 working
 days a year to productive work.  In addition, all those
 in the countryside who can contribute only "half man-
 power" or who are fitted only for light work should
 be encouraged to do well at whatever work they are
 fit for and suited to.  At the same time energetic
 efforts should be made to improve technical skills, to
 improve labour organization and management, and so
 steadily raise the labour productivity of all members
 of co-operatives.
 (24)  Agricultural producers' co-operatives should
 work on the maxim "industry and thrift" in all they
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 do. Industry means giving full encouragement to mem-
 bers to work conscientiously, to branch out into new
 fields of production, to develop a many-sided economy
 and to exercise minute care over everything.  Thrift
 means being strictly economical, lowering the cost
 of production and opposing extravagance and waste.
 In all capital construction plans co-operatives should
 make the fullest use of their own manpower and the
 material and capital at their disposal.
 (25)  Improve housing conditions.  As produc-
 tion by the co-operatives grows and the income of
 their members increases, agricultural producers' co-
 operatives should encourage and assist members to
 repair or build houses for their families and thus im-
 prove their housing conditions.  This should be done
 in a prepared, planned way, at different times and
 group by group, taking needs and possibilities into
 account, and on a voluntary and economical basis, for
 it will help them with their work, their political and
 cultural activity, and improve their health conditions.
 (26)  In seven or twelve years from 1956 deter-
 mined efforts should be made to virtually wipe out
 wherever possible all diseases from which the peo-
 ple suffer most seriously, such as schistosomiasis,
 filariasis, hookworm, kala-azar, encephalitis, bubonic
 plague,  malaria,  smallpox  and venereal  diseases.
 Energetic steps should be taken to prevent and cure
 other diseases such as measles, dysentery, typhoid
 fever, diphtheria, trachoma, pulmonary tuberculosis,
 leprosy, goitre and Kaschin-Beck's disease.
 To this end every effort should be made to train
 medical workers and gradually set up health and
 medical services in counties and districts, and clinics
 in villages.
 (27)  Wipe out the "four evils." In five, seven
 or twelve years beginning 1956 we should practically

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 wipe out the "four evils"-rats, sparrows, flies and
 mosquitoes-wherever possible.
 (28)  We should improve our research in agri-
 cultural science, provide better technical guidance for
 agriculture and train in a planned way large numbers
 of people to handle the technical side of agriculture.
 A systematic effort is needed to start, improve and
 extend bodies undertaking research in agricultural
 science and those providing technical guidance. These
 bodies include colleges of agricultural science, re-
 gional and other specialized institutes of agricultural
 science, provincial agricultural experimental stations,
 model county breeding farms, and district agricul-
 tural instruction centres.  In this way agricultural
 research and technical guidance will be of better ser-
 vice to developing agriculture.  In the twelve years
 from  1956 agricultural departments at all levels
 should, to meet the needs of co-operative economy,
 between them be responsible for training five to six
 million experts of primary and intermediate grades
 for technical work in agriculture, forestry, water con-
 servancy, live-stock breeding, veterinary work, farm
 management and accounting for agricultural pro-
 ducers' co-operatives.
 (29)  In five or seven years from 1956, depend-
 ent on the situation locally, we must virtually wipe
 out illiteracy.  The minimum standard of literacy
 must be 1,500 characters.  In every hsiang we should
 have spare-time schools to raise the educational
 standard of our cadres and the peasants.  In the
 next seven or twelve years, again depending on the
 local situation, we should extend to all rural areas
 compulsory elementary education.  Primary schools
 in the countryside should mostly be run by agricul-
 tural producers' co-operatives.  In seven or twelve
 years, too, we should establish in the rural areas a

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 wide network of film projection teams, clubs, in-
 stitutes, libraries, amateur dramatic groups and other
 bodies for education and recreation.  In the next seven
 to twelve years, every hsiang should have a sports
 field and sport should be a common sight in the
 countryside.
 (30)  Starting from 1956 we shall, in the next
 seven to twelve years, depending on local circumstances,
 extend the radio diffusion network to all rural areas.
 All hsiang and all large producers' co-operatives in
 agriculture, forestry, fishery, live-stock breeding, salt
 producing and handicrafts are called on to install ei-
 ther rediffusion loudspeakers or wireless sets proper.
 (31)  In seven to twelve years from 1956, vary-
 ing with local circumstances, all hsiang and large co-
 operatives should have a telephone service. Radio tele-
 phone-telegraph equipment should be installed wherever
 it is needed.  Inside seven years all villages are to be
 provided with a decent post and telegraphic service
 and a proper distribution of newspapers and periodicals.
 (32)  In a matter of five, seven or twelve years,
 starting from 1956, depending on differing local condi-
 tions, the whole countryside must be provided with
 networks of roads.  All roads between one province
 (municipality or autonomous region) and another, be-
 tween administrative regions (autonomous chou), coun-
 ties (autonomous counties), districts and hsiang (na-
 tionality hsiang), must be built to specifications laid
 down by government departments concerned with
 communications.  All roads must be constantly and
 carefully kept up.
 In places served by water-ways, navigable chan-
 nels should be dredged and kept in good order under
 whatever conditions are possible to improve com-
 munications.
 (33)  In seven to twelve years from 1956, de-
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 pending on local circumstances, a network of hydro-
 graphical and meteorological stations and posts should
 be in the main completed so as to improve the work
 of providing agriculture with reliable weather and
 meteorological forecasts.  All areas should pay atten-
 tion to such forecasts so that they can ward off such
 calamities as flood, drought, gale and frost.
 (34)  In the main, co-operation among handi-
 craftsmen and salt producers, the fishing and water-
 side population, should be complete in 1957.  Plans
 should be drawn up to extend co-operation in live-
 stock farming in the light of local conditions.
 (35)  Commercial bodies and supply and market-
 ing co-operatives in rural areas should complete the
 reorganization of their buying and selling machinery
 in 1957, improve planning for the circulation of goods
 and ensure that all rural areas are given good service
 in the supply of goods and the purchase of agricul-
 tural produce.
 (36)  In 1957 there must be a rural credit co-
 operative in practically every hsiang to provide credit
 and encourage saving.
 (37)  Protection of women and children.  The
 principle of equal pay for equal work must be rigidly
 adhered to wherever women do productive work. Dur-
 ing busy times of the year on the farms agricultural
 producers' co-operatives should run creches. When
 work is given out the health and physique of women
 members must be taken into consideration.
 Organizations concerned with health should train
 midwives for the rural areas, do all they can to see
 that modern methods of delivering babies are used,
 provide post-natal care and take steps to cut down
 the incidence of maternal diseases and the infant
 mortality rate.
 As co-operation in agriculture goes from strength

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 to strength and as production rises and the peasants
 begin to live better, suitable regulations and restric-
 tions should be made in regard to the employment of
 children in auxiliary work, with consideration to their
 age and strength.
 (38)  Young people in the country should be
 given every encouragement to show initiative in their
 work, to study and acquire scientific knowledge and
 skill.  The young people in the rural areas should be-
 come the spearhead, the shock force in productive,
 scientific and cultural work in the countryside.
 (39)  Starting from 1956, in the next five to
 seven years steps should be taken in the light of local
 conditions to wipe out unemployment in the cities and
 provide work for all urban unemployed.  The un-
 employed can find work not only in the cities but also
 on the outskirts of towns and cities, in the country-
 side proper, in areas where land reclamation is going
 on or in mountainous regions, in agriculture, forestry,
 live-stock breeding, subsidiary occupations, fishing, or
 in the fields of science, culture, education and health
 in the rural areas.
 (40)  Workers in the cities and peasants in the
 co-operatives must give each other every support.
 The workers must turn out more and better indus-
 trial goods which the peasants need, and the peasants
 must grow more and better grain and industrial raw
 materials which industry and town-dwellers need.
 Besides this, workers in the cities and peasants in
 the co-operatives should arrange get-togethers, visit
 one another, and write to each other.  They should
 keep in constant touch, give each other encourage-
 ment and swap experience so as to promote the
 development of industry and agriculture and help
 consolidate the alliance between the workers and the
 peasantry led by the working class.

 SOME EXPLANATIONS ON THE DRAFT
 NATIONAL  PROGRAMME  FOR  AGRI-
 CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT (1956-1967)
 Chairman, Comrades and Friends:
 The Draft National Programme for Agricultural
 Development in 1956-1967 put forward by the Polit-
 ical Bureau of the Central Committee of the Com-
 munist Party of China elaborates and carries forward
 the earlier "seventeen-point" programme.  On various
 occasions in November 1955, Chairman Mao Tse-tung
 exchanged views on the development of our agricul-
 ture with the secretaries of 14 provincial Party com-
 mittees and the secretary of the Party Committee of
 the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Region. The "seven-
 teen points" were decided on as a result of these con-
 sultations.  In January 1956, after further consulta-
 tions with responsible comrades from various provinces,
 municipalities and autonomous regions, Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung expanded these 17 points into 40 to make the
 first draft of this programme. In the past few days,
 the Central Committee of the Party has invited 1,375
 people gathered in Peking, including scientists working
 in industry, agriculture, medicine, public health and
 the social sciences, leading members of the democratic
 parties and people's organizations, and workers in the
 fields of education and culture, to group discussions of
 this draft.  Some good points raised in these discus-
 sions were adopted and the necessary revisions made in
 the draft.   Other useful points also emerged (luring the
 discussions. They will not be ignored; they will be
 taken up and dealt with later on in our practical work,
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 but they were not considered suitable for inclusion in
 the programme.
 The revised version of this draft programme,
 adopted by the Political Bureau of the Central Com-
 mittee of the Communist Party of China on January
 23, is now being submitted to the Supreme State
 Conference for discussion.  As I am working in the
 Ministry of Agriculture and am also in the Depart-
 ment of Rural Work of the Central Committee of the
 Party, the Central Committee of the Party has dele-
 gated me to explain some points in this draft.
 The following are a few points that I would like
 to make.
 First, the Draft National Programme for Agri-
 cultural Development in 1956-1967 is put forward at
 a time when the agricultural co-operative movement is
 on the upsurge throughout the country.
 The situation in our country has changed radi-
 cally as a result of Chairman Mao Tse-tung's report,
 "The Question of Agricultural Co-operation," delivered
 last July, and the decisions adopted on the basis of
 this report in the following October by the sixth ple-
 nary session (enlarged) of the seventh Central Com-
 mittee of the Communist Party of China.  Let us re-
 call how things were in the first half of 1955.  At
 that time, as a result of the influence of rightist con-
 servative ideas, particularly in agricultural co-opera-
 tion, the socialist transformation of agriculture had
 been brought to a standstill; in some cases the trend
 was even reversed; the spirit of progress was being
 suppressed in the countryside, the spirit of reaction
 was in the ascendant; the socialist initiative shown
 by the peasants was checked and capitalist ideas began
 to gain ground; the planned purchase and supply of
 grain, a socialist measure of paramount importance,
 came up against opposition from the forces of capital-
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 ism both in town and countryside. At that time, not
 a few people were worried because the growth of agri-
 culture lagged behind the needs of industry; some even
 became sceptical of the policy of socialist industrializa-
 tion of our country.  At that time, although we never
 lost faith, although we were quite convinced that the
 disequilibrium between industrial and agricultural
 development would certainly be corrected, we had not
 yet mastered the most effective way to deal with this
 problem; we were not able to rid these people of their
 worries.
 But now things are different.  Since the Central
 Committee of the Party and Chairman Mao Tse-tung
 grasped the key to the situation, that is, agricul-
 tural co-operation, and correctly tackled this prob-
 lem, the second half of 1955 saw a radical change
 in the situation.  There was an unprecedented up-
 surge of socialist initiative among the overwhelming
 majority of the peasants; a few well-off peasants, rich
 peasants and former landlords were the only excep-
 tions.  The tide of socialist revolution rose through-
 out the countryside.                                    In a few brief months in the
 second half of 1955, the number of peasant house-
 holds which joined agricultural producers' co-opera-
 tives increased from 16,900,000 to 70 million-that is,
 from 14 per cent to over 60 per cent of all peasant
 households.  In some provinces and rural areas under
 municipal authorities, practically all peasant house-
 holds have taken up co-operative farming in its ele-
 mentary form.  At the present time, more and more
 peasant households are joining co-operatives, and the
 percentage is still rising.  It is estimated that before
 the spring ploughing this year, except for certain
 provinces and autonomous regions, all provinces and
 municipalities will have completed ahead of time the
 task set in Point One of the Draft National Pro-

 gramme for Agricultural Development. In other words,
 the plan for agricultural co-operation in its elementary
 form will be completed ahead of time.
 In areas where agricultural co-operation has a
 fairly sound foundation, the growth of co-operatives
 from the elementary to the advanced form (collec-
 tive farms-Ed.), the transition from a semi-socialist
 to a socialist stage, has taken on the character of a
 mass movement.  In other areas, actual steps are
 being taken to set up collective farms. Liaoning Prov-
 ince now has 4,655 collective farms with more than
 1,600,000 peasant households in them; this is 60 per
 cent of all peasant households in that province.  In
 the Sinsiang Special Administrative Region in Honan
 Province, the switch to collective farms has been vir-
 tually completed.  And there are a great number of
 whole counties, districts and hsiang where co-operative
 farming has reached this higher stage.  It is estimated
 that before the spring ploughing this year, one-third of
 the total number of peasant households in the country
 will be in collective farms.  If all agricultural pro-
 ducers' co-operatives raise their output this year, it is
 very likely that the task set in Point Two of the Draft
 National Programme for Agricultural Development will
 be realized ahead of time, that is, the drive for advanced
 co-operative farming will be completed in the main
 by 1957 or 1958, depending on local conditions.
 In the past six months, the number of agricultural
 producers' co-operatives has been growing, and grow-
 ing rapidly.  Are they well founded?  Judging from
 the facts, most of them are.  With this swift flowing
 tide of socialist revolution, there is no longer any
 question of cadres urging the masses to join co-ops;
 quite the contrary: plans for promotion of co-opera-
 tive farming made by leading bodies at every level
 have been outstripped again and again by the eager-

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Mess of the masses to join co-ops.  The bulk of co-op
 members are in fact already turning their eyes to
 socialism ; they are concentrating their efforts on in-
 creasing both agricultural output and subsidiary pro-
 duction.  There is a great deal less thinking about
 narrow personal gains and losses.   At the same time,
 now that the co-operatives have gained experience
 and the Model Draft Regulations for the Agricultural
 Producers' Co-operative have been published, all the
 many concrete problems which crop up and concern
 the economic interests of co-operative members are
 being handled more carefully and in a more reason-
 able way.  Generally speaking, relations between poor
 and middle peasants in the co-operatives are now
 normal and healthy.  The essential thing-and the
 most important of all-is that all the agricultural
 producers' co-operatives have made or are making
 plans to increase production, while the peasants are
 showing the greatest keenness in their work.  In 1955,
 there was a record harvest; grain output was more
 than 20 per cent higher than in the peak pre-libera-
 tion year ; cotton output was 70 per cent higher.
 Ploughing and planting in the autumn and winter of
 1955 have been done more satisfactorily than in any
 previous year.  In many places, autumn and winter
 drought has been mastered and the plan for sowing
 winter wheat fulfilled and overfulfilled.  The peasants
 are now busy with their winter tasks and preparing
 for the spring ploughing.  Many jobs which in the
 past were left undone until the spring are now done
 early in the winter.
 I myself am a native of Nanking.        I was down
 there at the beginning of this month, and saw groups
 of peasants on its outskirts busy at work: even in
 cold weather like this, some were ploughing the land,
 some were working on water conservancy projects,

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 some were stocking up manure.  This is something
 that one rarely saw in the past.  And now it is happen-
 ing not only in the south but in the north as well,
 according to what comrades from other places tell
 me.  This is something new, but it has become a com-
 monplace throughout the country.  During the past
 few years, we kept on telling the peasants that the
 saying:  "The plan for the year must be made in
 the spring" was not true.  We said: "The plan for
 the year must be made in the winter," that is, in the
 winter of the previous year. Not very many listened
 to us.  But today this new slogan has actually been
 put into practice by the agricultural producers' co-
 operatives and the peasant masses.   There is a drain
 on supplies of bean-cake, chemical fertilizers, water-
 wheels, double-wheeled and double-shared ploughs and
 other new farm tools.  This well illustrates how keen
 the peasants are at work and what initiative they are
 putting into increasing production.
 True enough, in the past six months, agricultural
 producers' co-operatives have been set up in great
 numbers, very swiftly, and they are working well.
 This nation-wide upsurge in agricultural co-operation
 is resulting in an upsurge of agricultural production
 throughout the country.  This National Programme
 for Agricultural Development is put forward precisely
 because at this time agricultural co-operation and pro-
 duction is rising to a new height. It is timely and fully
 conforms with the needs of the present situation.
 Secondly, the National Programme for Agri-
 cultural Development (1956-1967) has been drawn up
 mainly for the peasants and we must rely mainly on
 the strength of the peasants for its realization. This
 programme shows the peasants in detail how to carry
 out the socialist transformation of agriculture and
 what is the aim of this long-term struggle for the
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 development of agriculture.  It also gives a picture
 of the prosperous and happy future of the Chinese
 countryside.
 The peasants who have gone in for co-operation-
 the peasants who are working hard to build their own
 happy socialist life-urgently need a well defined goal
 for their long-term struggle.  Without this it is dif-
 ficult for the agricultural producers' co-operatives to
 work out comprehensive plans.
 The peasants not only need a goal for their long-
 term struggle to develop production: they have also
 put forward a list of demands concerning their ma-
 terial and cultural life.  After raising output, increas-
 ing their incomes and being able to eat and dress well,
 they want to repair their old houses and build new
 ones, to improve their living conditions, learn to read
 and write, to raise their general cultural level; wipe
 out disease and improve sanitary conditions, so as to
 "have healthy people and abundant wealth."  Such a
 list of things making for improvements in the ma-
 terial and cultural life of the peasants in line with
 the rising level of their production is just as it should
 be. We should try to realize these hopes sooner.
 As Stalin pointed out, the basic economic law of
 socialist development is to continuously develop pro-
 duction so as to satisfy the growing needs of the peo-
 ple as the level of their material and cultural life rises.
 The National Programme for Agricultural Develop-
 ment put forward by the Central Committee of the
 Chinese Communist Party, the core of which is the
 development of agricultural co-operation and produc-
 tion, outlines plans to satisfy the peasants' demands
 for a better material and cultural life.  For this rea-
 son, publication of the draft will exert a powerful
 influence on the peasants; it will call on and mobilize
 them for action; it will give fresh impetus to the

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 upsurge of agricultural co-operation and production.
 When the "17 points" drawn up in November 1955 by
 Chairman Mao together with the responsible com-
 rades of various local Party committees were spread
 through the countryside, they played an important
 part in rallying the peasants for action.  Many peas-
 ants in many places exclaimed:  "Now we can see
 what socialism is !" Judging from this we may safely
 predict that the 40 points of this draft will play an
 even greater part in encouraging the 500 million peas-
 ants of China to march bravely forward along the
 road of socialism.
 Realization of this programme depends mainly
 upon the peasants themselves, upon their manpower
 and their material and financial resources. The tasks
 set in this programme include: the promotion of agri-
 cultural co-operation, an increase in agricultural out-
 put and a number of measures to increase production,
 extend afforestation and clothe barren lands with
 greenery, the developing of animal husbandry, fish-
 ing and handicrafts, the wiping out of illiteracy, estab-
 lishment of primary schools, increasing the number
 of broadcasting and receiving sets, the promotion of
 cultural, recreational and athletic activities and of
 health work in the countryside, the improvement of
 housing, and provision of work for the urban unem-
 ployed.  Apart from a few of these things which will
 be done by the state or by the peasants with the
 assistance of the state, all the rest will be done by
 the peasants themselves.
 Are the peasants capable of handling these tasks?
 Of course they are.  They have a huge amount of
 manpower.  And how about their material and finan-
 cial resources? Suffice it to say that the value of the
 grain and cotton they produced in 1955 over and above
 their output in 1954 was double the amount the gov-
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 ernment budgeted in 1955 as expenditure on agri-
 culture, forestry and water conservancy.  Further-
 more, their output is expected to increase every year
 from now on.  That is, their material and financial
 resources will also increase steadily year by year. So
 we can be quite positive in stating that the peasants
 are quite capable of carrying out this programme.
 Of course the state should give the peasants all
 possible financial, economic and technical assistance.
 But it cannot spend too much on these things, espe-
 cially in the next few years.  Too much dependence on
 the state, the habit of looking to it for all kinds of
 investments would place too great a strain on its
 financial resources and would delay or indefinitely post-
 pone the doing of these things. Furthermore, if the
 state spent too much money in this way, it would have
 to reduce its investment in industry, and that would
 mean retarding the progress of our socialist indus-
 trialization.  The postponement or abandonment of
 things which can be done mainly by the peasants
 themselves, or retardation of industrialization of our
 country, would neither serve the interests of our so-
 cialist construction, nor of our people as a whole, nor
 of the peasants.
 As this programme is mainly for the peasants and
 will be carried out mainly by the peasants themselves,
 it should be a convincing document for mobilizing them
 for action.  It should, therefore, be written in a clear
 and concise style easily understood by the peasants.
 During the many discussions some comrades suggested
 additional points for inclusion.  Some concerned work
 which would be carried out entirely by the state, some
 had only a slight bearing on the development of the
 countryside and of agriculture, or no direct connec-
 tion at all, while others concerned only methods of
 work or execution.  We did try to incorporate these
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 suggestions in the programme, but we found that in-
 cluding them would have made it too long, too com-
 plex, too loaded with detail, and this would have
 tended to weaken its power of getting the peasants on
 the move.  That is why they have not been included.
 In these many discussions proposals were also made
 to include the following items in the programme: out-
 put targets for various agricultural crops; targets for
 stock breeding, fishing, forestry and irrigation; tar-
 gets for the number of tractors and the amount of
 chemical fertilizers to be produced and so forth. Such
 targets were actually incorporated in the programme.
 But they were later deleted because it is better to
 set these targets after thorough study as part of the
 various five-year plans and annual plans of the state.
 In this way it is possible to address the programme
 to the broad mass of the peasants specifically, to give
 them a clear idea of the aim of their long-term strug-
 gle, and the various things they should do to realize
 this aim.  This makes it a more effective instrument
 in mobilizing the broad mass of peasants for action.
 This doesn't mean, of course, that realization of
 this programme is an affair for the peasants alone.
 On the contrary, many points in the programme must
 be jointly carried out by town and country.  Many
 government bodies will have to work hard to com-
 plete work set out in the programme and essential
 to its realization.  Every single department concerned
 with agriculture must do its work well.  But this is
 not all.  Machine-building departments, too, must ful-
 fil the state plan, and produce and supply the peas-
 ants with new-type farm implements such as double-
 wheeled and double-shared ploughs, pumps and other
 water raising equipment, and agricultural machinery
 such as tractors.  The chemical industry should fulfil,
 and overfulfil, its task of producing chemical fertilizers.
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Commercial enterprises and supply and marketing co-
 operatives should do a good job in purchasing agri-
 cultural and subsidiary products and supplying the
 peasants with the things they need, whether these are
 capital  or consumer goods.  Communications and
 transport departments should work hard to build up
 local road networks throughout the country, and tele-
 phone and postal services in the countryside.  Scien-
 tific, cultural, educational and health departments
 should all work hard to fulfil the tasks set them in the
 programme. In short, as the programme itself declares
 in its very first sentence:  "The great tide of agri-
 cultural co-operation that has swept China is bring-
 ing forth an immense, nation-wide growth of agri-
 cultural production, and this in turn is stimulating
 the development of the whole national economy and
 all branches of science, culture, education and public
 health."
 Leading Party organs and government bodies at
 all levels in the country "should draw up specific plans,
 based on the present draft National Programme and
 taking into account conditions peculiar to each locality.
 These plans should specify the successive stages of
 development of every aspect of their local work.  At
 the same time all state departments concerned with
 economic affairs, with science, culture, education,
 public health, civic affairs or the judiciary should also
 review and revise their plans of work in accordance
 with the present National Programme."
 Workers and intellectuals must also be mobilized
 to give the peasants whatever assistance is needed in
 carrying out this National Programme for Agricultural
 Development. Many things listed in the programme-
 such as new farm implements, tractors, telephone sets,
 broadcasting and receiving equipment, medicines and
 medical apparatus-are made by the workers.  The
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 peasants have to depend on help from intellectuals
 and scientists to carry out many of the tasks set out
 in the programme-both measures connected with
 increasing production and cultural, educational and
 health work.  Unless the workers and intellectuals
 are mobilized to give this aid this programme can-
 not be realized.
 So, although this programme is mainly for the
 peasants and depends for realization upon their man-
 power, material and financial resources, it is also for
 the whole nation.  Its realization also depends on
 whole-hearted co-operation by the people of the en-
 tire nation, upon mobilization of all the workers, peas-
 ants, intellectuals, and patriotic people in every walk
 of life.
 This draft programme with its 40 points will re-
 main in the form of a draft for the next few months.
 Workers, peasants, intellectuals and patriotic people
 in every sphere of work throughout the land are asked
 to discuss it and give their opinions.
 Thirdly, the tasks put forward in the National
 Programme for Agricultural Development (1956-1967)
 are forward-looking and feasible.  The prerequisites
 and conditions for their fulfilment exist; they can be
 completed ahead of time or overfulfilled.
 The keynote of the programme is to raise agri-
 cultural output swiftly, to produce things in large
 quantities, to develop agriculture, forestry, cattle-
 breeding, subsidiary occupations, fishing and other pro-
 ductive activities on the basis of co-operation. Special
 emphasis is put on raising within twelve years the
 average yield of grain per mou in three different re-
 gions from 150, 208 and 400 catties in 1955 to 400,
 500, 800 catties respectively; on raising the average
 yield of cotton per mou from the national average of
 35 catties of ginned cotton in 1955 to 60, 80 and 100
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 catties  respectively  depending on local  conditions.
 These new standards will give China over two and a
 half times as much grain and three times as much
 cotton in 1967 as in 1955.    If these central targets
 are reached, there is no doubt that, in keeping with
 the development of production, we can bring about
 the improvements in the peasants' material and cul-
 tural life set forth in the National Programme for
 Agricultural Development.
 The responsible comrades in the localities are full
 of confidence and working with great zeal to reach the
 targets set for increased yields.  Some provinces have
 reported that they can reach these targets ahead of
 time.  When the original seventeen points were re-
 layed to the countryside, the broad mass of peasants
 were similarly filled with confidence and enthusiasm
 in fulfilling the targets for increased production.
 What are these prerequisites and conditions
 which ensure these increased yields?  The most im-
 portant is the fact that China has a huge population,
 a vast amount of labour power, a pretty good climate,
 and that there are vast potentialities in using labour
 power and land to increase production. By the time
 co-operative farming, especially socialist co-operative
 farming, is the rule everywhere, a system of collec-
 tive ownership and the principle of "to each accord-
 ing to his work" will replace the system of private
 ownership of means of production.  This will free the
 productive forces. This will foster an astonishing de-
 velopment of the initiative and creativeness of the
 broad mass of peasants in their work ; it will permit
 us to use the available labour force more rationally and
 more effectively, to greatly improve the utilization of
 labour power and labour productivity in general, and
 enable us to make fuller and more reasonable use of
 land, draught animals and farm tools.

 Co-operative farming by pooling the land wipes
 out borders and unnecessary paths between fields and
 so brings more land under cultivation. (Statistics show
 that this can bring 5 per cent more land under cultiva-
 tion, that is to say, add another 80 million mou to the
 country's arable land.)
 Co-operative farming makes it possible to carry
 out water conservancy projects, water and soil con-
 servation, and land and soil improvement on a large
 scale.  Co-operative farming makes it possible to
 transform arid land into irrigated fields, and barren
 and waste land into fertile soil.
 Co-operative farming makes it possible to use to
 the full the abilities of all men and women-those who
 are able-bodied, those who are not fully able-bodied,
 and those who can do light tasks-enabling them all
 to engage in many fields of work to help develop pro-
 duction in agriculture, forestry, cattle-breeding, sub-
 sidiary occupations and fishing.
 Co-operative farming makes it possible to have a
 single management for the farm, to cultivate crops
 best suited to the various types of soil, to put more
 labour power into improving the land, to improve
 methods of cultivation by deep ploughing and careful
 weeding, better techniques of sowing and planting; to
 improve the organization of field work and increase
 yields per mou.
 In short, co-operative farming will develop po-
 tentialities for increasing production as never before,
 make it possible to do things on a bigger scale, and
 have more strings to our bows in doing jobs and to
 get more careful cultivation, all of which will greatly
 increase agricultural output, the wealth of society and
 the income of co-operative members.  The reality of
 all this has been proved in practice by numerous co-
 operatives in various parts of the country.  Today
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 there are already groups of co-operatives, some whole
 hsiang, districts, and even a few counties where the
 average grain and cotton yield per mou has reached
 or even surpassed the targets which the National
 Programme has set for the next twelve years. Since
 these typically high-yield co-operatives, hsiang, dis-
 tricts, and counties have reached, or even surpassed
 these targets, we have every reason to believe that
 other co-operatives and other hsiang, districts and
 counties in the same areas under more or less similar
 conditions can reach the targets too.  Since these
 typically high-yield co-operatives, hsiang, districts
 and counties have reached or surpassed the targets
 under the circumstances of today, we have still more
 reason to believe that with development of indus-
 trialization in the next twelve years, and the gradual
 increase in the number of tractors, water pumps,
 amount of chemical fertilizers, insecticide and farming
 machinery in general, and with more large-scale water
 conservancy projects, it is quite possible for the
 various regions of the country to reach and even sur-
 pass the targets set out in the National Programme.
 The demands for communications, posts and tele-
 communications services, cultural, educational and
 health facilities set out in the National Programme
 are things that have already been realized in many
 agricultural  producers'  co-operatives  and  villages.
 New solutions have also been found for the problem
 of resettling over a million city unemployed-a prob-
 lem many people felt would be difficult to solve in a
 short time.     The Chiahsing Region of Chekiang Prov-
 ince has asked for 100,000 people from Shanghai.
 Kiangsi Province has also asked for half a million
 urban unemployed capable of doing farm work. Need-
 less to say sparsely populated remote regions have an
 even greater need of manpower.  The more than one

 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 million unemployed left over from pre-liberation days
 will all get jobs in a few years as a result of arrange-
 ments made both in the cities and countryside.
 That is why we say the tasks and demands set
 forth in the National Programme for Agricultural
 Development are both forward-looking and feasible.
 They are not conservative, nor adventurist.  It is
 quite possible to meet these targets ahead of time
 or overfulfil them.  This way of doing things has
 its advantages; it stimulates the local government
 initiative.
 Fourthly, by putting forward the National Pro-
 gramme for Agricultural Development (1956-1967)
 immediately after correctly solving the problem of
 agricultural co-operation, the Central Committee of
 the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung firmly grasped the key link-agriculture ;
 this enables our socialist cause to forge ahead still
 more swiftly.
 The essential part of socialist construction is
 socialist industrialization of the country and the core
 of industrialization is development of heavy industry.
 Industry leads agriculture, the city leads the country-
 side and the workers lead the peasants-these are
 unchangeable, fundamental principles of socialism that
 are not to be doubted and cannot be brushed aside.
 But ours is a big country.  It has 600 million
 people.  There are more than 500 million peasants,
 exceeding five-sixths of the population. Chairman Mao
 Tse-tung  in  his  article  On Coalition Government
 pointed out that "the peasants (are) the mainstay of
 the market for China's industry.  It is the peasants
 who are, and alone can be, the largest suppliers of
 foodstuffs and raw materials, and who consume the
 largest amount of manufactured goods." No other
 country in the world has as big a domestic market as
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 Approved For Release 2007/10/19: CIA-RDP83-00418R006200350015-8
 ours.  The purchasing power of this market is still
 very low (though slightly higher than in pre-libera-
 tion days).  But its potential power is enormous.
 Once  the National  Programme  for  Agricultural
 Development is realized, we shall have a domestic
 market with a fantastically great purchasing power.
 Can there be any other way to develop China's in-
 dustry, save by relying on our own domestic market?
 Of course we can manage to export some of our indus-
 trial products, but we must rely chiefly on our own
 domestic market.  At the present time there are about
 80 million people living in cities and industrial and
 mining areas, and each year they need huge quanti-
 ties of grain and other foodstuffs.  Is there any other
 source to which we can turn to satisfy this demand,
 besides our own, our rural areas?  The purchas-
 ing power of our 600 million people is bound to rise
 steadily, and they will present a formidable demand
 for light industrial products. Should we try to get
 raw materials for our light industry mainly from
 foreign countries, instead of relying on the domestic
 supply of raw materials?  Our agriculture also needs
 a huge quantity of means of production.  If we are
 to use tractors on all our farmlands that can be tilled
 by machines, we will need 1,200,000 to 1,500,000
 standard  15  h.p.  tractors.  Between  120,000 and
 150,000 worn-out tractors will have to be replaced by
 new ones every year.  If we make extensive use of
 chemical fertilizers, we will need at least 20 million
 tons of nitrate fertilizer, besides phosphate and po-
 tassium fertilizer.                                     This again means a huge domestic

 velopment of agriculture means an important source

 tremendous development of agriculture, our socialist
 industrialization will run into serious difficulties.
 China is a big country with 600 million people
 and over five-sixths of them are peasants-this is a
 fundamental fact which in our work of building so-
 cialism we ignore at our peril.  Nevertheless, if any-
 one thinks that socialist industrialization is not the
 main thing, and refuses to recognize the leadership of
 the working class, he is making a gross mistake. We
 take serious note of the important role our five hun-
 dred million peasants are playing in the socialist con-
 struction of our country.  We must take serious note
 of the extremely important bearing agriculture has
 on industrial development. By putting forward this
 National Programme for Agricultural Development
 (1956-1967) at this moment, during the great upsurge
 in agricultural co-operation, the Political Bureau of
 the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist
 Party has systematically solved the most difficult and
 complicated problem of our socialist revolution-the
 problem of the peasantry and agriculture.  As a result,
 we shall be able to strengthen still further the worker-
 peasant alliance on a new basis, accelerate the prog-
 ress of socialist industrialization and fulfil the funda-
 mental task of our country during the transition
 period ahead of time.
