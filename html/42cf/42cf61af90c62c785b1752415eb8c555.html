 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 REVOLUTIONARY ACTIVITY IN THE CARIBBEAN
 Dominican Republic - Nicaragua
 The long-brewing campaign
 against Caribbean dictators has
 reached the stage of military ac-
 tion with at least three insur-
 gent landings in the Dominican
 Republic since 14 June and in-
 dications of imminent new rebel
 incursions into Nicaragua. Gen-
 eral mobilization in the Domin-
 ican Republic on 22 June indi-
 cates that the internal threat
 in that country has become a
 source of concern to the regime.
 in Nicaragua, the govern-
 ment is alerted for an imminent
 attack by Cuban-supported reb-
 els who it believes are converg-
 ing on the Honduran-Nicaraguan
 border, and other rebel groups
 in Costa Rica may be preparing
 for a new incursion.  Former
 Costa Rican President  Jose
 Figueres informed the American
 Embassy that the  Nicaraguan
 rebels in Costa Rica have reached
 an agreement with Cuban Prime
 Minister Fidel Castro  under
 which he will supply them with
 weapons.
 Although the initial rebel
 effort in Nicaragua had failed
 by mid-June and that 'in the Domin-
 ican Republic may also appear
 at first to founder, further
 foreign-supported rebel incur-
 sions can be expected.   The
 Cuban-backed rebel groups are
 Communist infiltrated, and any
 postrevolutionary governments
 in either country would be like-
 ly to become influenced by the
 Communists.
 Cuban-Venezuelan Support
 While both the Cuban and
 Venezuelan governments repeat-
 edly deny giving material aid
 to the Dominican and Nicaraguan
 rebels, it is nevertheless clear
 that such aid, particularly
 Cuban, has been considerable.
 Public opinion in both coun-
 tries, as well as in most others
 in the area, strongly  favors
 the rebels.   The Cuban and Ven-"
 ezue'_Lan governments have emphat-
 ically stated they will oppose
 any attempt by the Organization
 of American States (OAS) to as-
 sist the beleaguered governments.
 Counteraction Against Cuba
 High Dominican and Nicara-
 guan officials, who doubt that
 any appeal to the OAS would re-
 sult in effective assistance,
 have seriously considered mili-
 tary action against  hostile
 governments.   The Dominican
 mobilization could mean prep-
 arations for a counterattack
 against Cuba.   Such action,
 which the Dominican foreign min-
 ister said on 20 June would be-
 come "imperative" in the event
 of further rebel  incursions,
 would probably include the mount-
 ing of an invasion of Cuba by
 the Dominican-supported  Cuban
 exiles in the Dominican Repub-
 lic.   It might also involve ac-
 tion by the "anti-Communist
 foreign legion" formed in the
 Dominican Republic early this
 year and could include Dominican
 air attacks on Cuban cities.

 CURREN'T' - INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 25 June 1959
 Having failed in the first
 six weeks of the foreign minis-
 ters' conference to induce the
 'Western powers to consent to a
 change in the status of Berlin
 which would eliminate existing
 Allied rights, the Soviet lead-
 ers agreed to a three-week re-
 cess presumably in the belief
 that increasing public pressure
 in the West for an accommodation
 would erode Western unity and
 that the talks will resume under
 conditions more favorable to
 the USSR.   Moscow probably cal-
 culates that it can extract fur-
 ther Western concessions by pro-
 longing the stalemate on the
 crucial issue of'Allied rights
 while maintaining the threat of
 unilateral Soviet action to sign
 a separate treaty and transfer
 access controls to the East Ger-
 mans.
 Soviet moves in connection
 with the Geneva recess, however,
 suggest that the Kremlin leaders
 intend to avoid any action which
 would strengthen Western unity
 and stiffen Western resistance
 to Soviet inducements during the
 recess.   Moscow's present pos-
 ture  is designed  to assure
 the West that the door to a
 negotiated settlement remains
 open.
 In their statements on 19
 June, Khrushchev and Gromyko
 carefully avoided categorically
 rejecting the West's proposals
 of 16 June which offered certain
 concessions in return for a So-
 viet guarantee of free and un-
 restricted access to West Ber-
 lin.   Khrushchev failed to at-
 tack these proposals in his
 Kremlin speech on 19 June.   He
 also refrained from issuing any
 threats of early unilateral So-
 viet action on Berlin and stressed
 the USSR's desire for a nego-
 tiated settlement of the Berlin
 and German problems and its
 readiness to agree to a time
 limit "acceptable to all" on an
 "interim settlement" for Berlin.
 While regretting that the con-
 ference was not "running smooth-
 ly," he said that, despite their
 differences, the ministers' work
 has already had a "definite pos-
 itive value."
 In the last private meet-
 ing at Geneva before the recess,
 Gromyko apparently made no men-
 tion of the Western proposals.
 Instead, he introduced two modi-
 fications in his proposals on 9
 and ]' .0 June for a one-year in-
 terim Berlin settlement.   He
 stressed that the duration of
 such an arrangement was not a
 "basic problem of principle"
 and suggested that the one-year
 limit; could be extended to 1.8
 months.   If no agreements on
 reunification and the principles
 of a peace treaty were achieved
 by the proposed all-German com-
 mitte* by the end of this period,
 Gromyko stated that the partici-
 pants in the present conference
 "could take up the question of
 West Berlin once again."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 The initial Soviet proposals
 had warned that the USSR would
 sign a separate treaty with East
 Germany if the Western powers
 and West Germany prevented agree-
 ment on a peace treaty with both
 German states within one year.
 These two modifications, how-
 ever, did not alter the basic
 terms of the proposed interim
 agreement which would terminate
 existing Allied rights in Ber-
 lin based on postwar agreements.
 Soviet propaganda is echo-
 ing Khrushchev's optimism on
 the prospects for agreement when
 the talks resume,   Izvestia de-
 clared on 21 June that the "po-
 sitions of the Soviet Union and
 o.f the Western powers at the
 Geneva conference have become
 closer on many questions relat-
 ing to the Berlin problem, and
 now there is a good basis for
 agreement,"  Moscow commenta-
 tors, however, are attributing
 the recess to the insistence of
 the Western ministers despite
 "positive" achievements in the
 talks.
 Summit.Prospects
 Khrushchev expressed con-
 fidence in his speech on 19 June
 that the West, under pressure of
 public opinion, will eventually
 agree to a summit meeting re-
 gardless of the outcome of the
 foreign ministers' talks.   He
 contended that a summit confer-
 ence would "become even more nec-
 essary" if the ministers fail
 to reach agreement and warned
 against any Western attempt to
 bring pressure on the Soviet
 Union by linking a summit meet-
 ing to progress at the ministers'
 level.
 The USSR, Khrushchev said,
 is not prepared "to pay any
 price for the sake of calling a
 summit conference."  Specifical-
 ly, he said "it would be naive
 to think that the Soviet Union,
 at a, conference of ministers or
 of heads of government, would
 agree to put its signature to a
 document that perpetuated the
 occupation regime in West Berlin
 and left Germany without a peace-
 ful settlement for an unlimited
 time,"
 Nuclear Test Cessation Talks
 Soviet tactics at the nu-
 clear-test talks are aimed at
 keeping this issue open during
 the recess in the foreign minis-
 ters' conference.   After re-
 peatedly stressing the need for
 a more rapid pace, the chief
 Soviet delegate claimed that the
 Soviet proposal for a quota of
 annual inspections as well as
 those related to staffing of the
 control posts offer the basis
 for ,agreement`   At the 100th
 meeting on 22 June he urged
 that the West not "complicate
 matters" by raising additional
 issues.   He accused the UK del-
 egation of inconsistency in its
 position,on staffing,.claiming'.
 London had earlier favored 14
 or 15 host-country personnel at
 each post but now was limiting
 this number to 4 or 5.
 Moscow is apparently at-
 tempting to use the concurrent
 experts' talks on detection of
 high-altitude nuclear tests to
 support its position that the
 conclusions of the 1958 Geneva
 Technical Report remain complete-
 ly valid.   Although the chief
 Soviet delegate'to this technical
 working group, in session since
 22 June, has asked numerous
 questions about new Western data
 on high-altitude testing, he has
 repeated several times that no
 really new information has been
 presented thus far?  Moscow prob-
 ably is concerned that any modi-
 fications of the experts' report

 25 June 1959
 at these talks would weaken its
 position in refusing to consider
 recent American data on seismic
 phenomena which are in basic
 conflict with that part of the
 1958 report dealing with under-
 ground detection methods.
 The Soviet delegation to
 the working group has, never-
 theless, endeavored to give the
 impression of willingness to
 discuss the high-altitude-tests
 problem seriously, thereby sup-
 porting Soviet tactics in the
 plenary sessions.
 Moscow probably believes
 that increasing pressure in
 Great Britain for a test-cessa-
 tion agreement, in contrast
 with obvious .:French adamance
 against making this issue a sub-
 ject for summit negotiations,
 can be exploited to weaken West-
 ern unity.   The Soviet leaders
 have probably calculated that
 the recent shift in the British
 Labor party's policy on the nu-
 clear weapons issue may increase
 pressure on the Macmillan gov-
 ernment for a test-cessation
 agreement.
 A new Labor party statement
 of 23 June, supported by the
 powerful Trades Union Congress,
 stipulated that Britain should
 maintain its nuclear deterrent
 but should work toward the crea-
 tion of a nonnuclear "club" of
 all nations except the United
 States and the USSR. While the old
 policy committed the Labor party
 to a one-year unilateral test
 ban, the new statement called
 on the next Labor government to
 suspend tests indefinitely while
 honoring its NATO obligations
 but to seek greater control over
 American bases in Britain.
 Western Reaction
 The differing British,
 French, and German attitudes
 were clearly in evidence as the
 foreign ministers' conference
 recessed.   In answering ques-
 tions in Parliament on 23 June,
 Prime Minister Macmillan remained
 cautiously optimistic over the
 prospects of East-West agreement.
 He asserted that it would be a
 mistake "to underrate the degree
 of success" achieved in clarify-
 ing positions:which in some re-
 spects, he said, are nearer to-
 gether.   Having thus indicated
 that his principal conditions
 for holding a summit meeting
 were already met, he expressed
 his hope that the foreign min-
 isters'talks, when resumed,
 would lead to such a meeting.
 On the same day, however,
 French Foreign Minister Couve
 de Murville told a television
 audience that the East and West
 remained as far apart as ever on
 the over-all German question.
 West German  Chancellor
 Adenauer offered a still sharp-
 er view.   He stated on 19 June
 that the Geneva conference has':
 been a Soviet success in that
 a wedge was driven between the
 Western powers.   The chancellor
 called for a Western summit meet-
 ing, implying that at such a
 meeting Macmillan should be per-
 suaded to change his views on

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Western tactics.   Adenauer's
 strong statement may be partly
 motivated by internal consid-
 erations                       in view of his claim
 that  the tense  international
 situations prevented him~'from
 retiring to  the  German pres-
 idency, and                    partly from his
 fears that  at the next round
 of negotiations  the  British
 may press  for  further conces-
 sions to gain  a summit  con-
 ference.
 Adenauer now may revive
 his plan, previously  raised
 with Macmillan in March, to
 demand a five-year moratorium
 on changes in Berlin's status
 in return for a four-power com-
 mission with German  advisers
 to work  out proposals  for
 German reunification by stages
 and for a peace treaty.   The
 West German delegation  at
 Geneva was considering such a
 plan.

 Initial press comment on
 the conference recess  has
 tended  to follow the govern-
 ment's                                                                        lead in each country;
 with variations  by political
 leaning.   French papers were
 generally pessimistic  over the
 lack of progress.   British pa-
 pers accepted  the adjournment
 without alarm in the belief

 was arrested for openly encour-

 Soviet Ambassador Zaitsev
 has left Baghdad for several
 weeks of "medical treatment" in
 Moscow.    He will probably dis-

 suggestion to Iraqi Communist
 leaders that they modify their
 present tactics.
 In spite of fancy advance

 be no more than the signing of
 an agreement with the British
 for Iraqi withdrawal from the
 sterling area.   The matter has
 been under consideration since
 last fall, and Qasim announced

 decreed the abolition of the

 intended as a device for scruti-

 election date has been shifted
 from 15 to 8 July. The apparent

 'CURREWT'TNTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 25 June 1959
 PROBABLE EAST GERMAN REACTION TO PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION IN BERLIN
 The East German regime,
 despite earlier threatening
 statements, will probably not
 do anything to interfere seri-
 ously with the West German presi-
 dential election in Berlin on 1
 July., nor are the Communists
 likely to attempt to apply un-
 usual pressure on the West dur-
 ing the Geneva conference re-
 cess.
 The East Germans, however,
 may attempt to intimidate dele-
 gates bound for Berlin via sur-
 face transport by such harass-
 ments as prolonged border formal-
 ities or detainment along the
 road for traffic violations.
 "worker" groups and troublemak-
 ers may be used for protest
 demonstrations and disturbances
 in West Berlin.
 During the past fer weeks
 there have been several veiled
 threats in the East German press
 that the "provocation" of hold-
 ing the election in West Berlin
 would be met with a blockade.
 In each case, however, the threats
 were obscure enough that the
 Communists were not publicly
 .committed to follow through.
 For example, propagandist Gerhard.
 Eisler said on 6 June,  "It was
 not at all easy for me to per-
 sualde these Berliners to re-
 main patient, in view of this
 new provocation."
 The Communists are not like-
 ly to take any action which
 would actually prevent delegates
 from reaching or leaving West
 Berlin,  for such action would
 result in unfavorable publicity
 at a time when the German Demo-
 cratic Republic  (GDR) is striv-
 ing to establish itself in West-
 ern eyes as a respectable coun-
 try..
 The GDR's most likely move
 is an intense propaganda cam-
 paign designed to show that hold-
 ing the election in West Berlin
 is illegal and particularly
 provocative at a time when the
 big--four powers are attempting
 to find a solution to major
 problems.   The Communists also
 will'. probably draw comparisons
 between their reasonable posture
 and West Germany's rearmament
 policy.   Such minor gains in

 SIGNIFICANT OIL FIELD DISCOVERED IN YUGOSLAVIA
 Yugoslavia has recently
 completed initial exploration of
 an oil field in Croatia which
 is one of the largest in Europe
 outside the Soviet Union.   The
 field,  located at Struzec in
 Croatia, closely resembles geo-
 logically                       the "great fields of
 California and Venezuela,"
 Exploratory work
 on the field was be-

 The Yugoslavs drilled
 their first well in
 the area in 1952 but
 did not find oil.

 YUGOSLAV CRUDE-OIL REQUIREMENTS
 A separate peace treaty will
 probably not be signed with the
 Soviet Union during this period,
 however, and major steps to
 interfere with access--such as
 turning over the controls to
 the East Germans--are unlikely.
 Some effort to restrict movement
 across the West Berlin borders
 may be made, however.   Such ac-
 tion has already been suggested
 by reports that the number of
 persons permitted to cross the
 borders to work in the Western
 sector will be reduced
 raised by about 166 percent--suf-
 ficient to make Yugoslavia self-
 sufficient.  A preliminary
 estimate, which may be conserva-
 tive, places the field's re-
 serves at approximately 22,-
 000,000 metric tons.
 This discovery has important
 implications for the Yugoslav
 economy and deprives the Kremlin
 of a. potentially powerful weap-
 on in its dispute with Belgrade.
 Yugoslavia used 1,000,000 metric
 strike oil, however,       1946
 and 19 other wells
 have since been drilled.   1950
 When in production,        1954

 POLAND CONTINUES TO SHOW INDEPENDENCE IN INTERNAL AFFAIRS
 Although Poland apparently
 still has Moscow's consent to
 carry out its independent in-
 ternal program in return for
 full support of Soviet foreign
 policy objectives, open criti-
 cism of each other's cultural
 policies has recently been voiced
 by regime representatives. Fur-
 thermore, Gomulka has recently
 reiterated the unique Polish at-
 titude toward collectivization.
 Despite these divergencies, how-
 ever, Khrushchev is apparently
 satisfied with the stability
 achieved in Poland and probably
 does not wart to introduce
 changes at this time which might
 upset it.
 Polls  publications continue
 to respond strongly to Soviet
 criticism of developments in
 Poland. A Polish literary
 magazine criticized the third
 and last volume of the Soviet
 publication History of Poland
 for its treatment of__fhe pre-
 war history of the Polish Com-
 munist party and for its "im-
 poverished picture of society
 and the  nation  and even of the
 working class."
 During the third USSR Writers'
 Union congress, in May, the chief
 Polish delegate reportedly gave
 a speech strongly defending
 freedom of expression for writers.
 Moreover, the Polish exhibit at
 the bloc-wide art exhibit in
 Moscow in March drew heavy
 critical fire from Soviet com-
 mentators for its abstractions.
 The USSR Writers'. Union paper
 criticized Polish abstract art
 as "exagge~xated, subjective...
 rejecting ideology ...and funda-
 mentally  foreign to our social
 outlook." Soviet criticism has
 had no visible effect on Polish
 artists, and the Polish regime
 will probably not demand con-

 where Poland continues to sup-
 port the private farmer.   In
 his speech to the second plenum
 of the Polish Communist party
 on 22 June, Gomulka did not
 advocate any major policy changes
 in agriculture.   He shelved
 collectivization as a "distant"
 though "inevitable" project.
 He did, however, call for a
 more rapid development of the
 agricultural sector in 1959-
 1965 than was envisioned at
 the third party congress in
 March.
 By heavy investments,
 mechanization, greatly expanded
 building, and credit plans, as
 well as by greater party activ-

 agricultural "circles,"  the
 regime hopes to increase.pro-

 for establishing some lower
 form of agricultural collectives.
 Expansion of the agricul-
 tural circles--a loose form of
 cooperative--in the form envisioned
 at the plenum will make the
 farmer more dependent on the
 regime.   However, the announce-

 seamen's strike, which began on
 8 June with the support of the
 Christian  Democrat. - and Demo
 cratic Socialist - oriented
 labor organizations as well as
 of the CGIL.   Shipowners have
 rejected demands for a 30-per-
 cent increase in wages and
 fringe benefits.  The minister
 of merchant marine has in ef-
 fect sided with the shipowners
 by announcing he will not ne-
 gotiate with the seamen until
 they return to work.
 The bank clerks' walkout
 is more than a week old, a na-
 tionwide railroad strike  is
 threatened, and a 48-hour
 strike  by  some  one  million
 steelworkers and metalworkers
 is scheduled for 26 June. A
 previous strike by all the
 metalworkers' unions on 4 and
 5 May in protest against man-
 agement's refusal to discuss
 wage raises in negotiations for
 a new national contract was
 heavily supported in northern
 Italy.
 The aggressive leadership
 and greater strength of the
 CGIL have enabled it to seize
 the initiative in strike ac-
 tion.  The less well-organized
 free unions have been compelled
 to follow suit, particularly
 since the government's depend-
 ence on the rightist parties
 in parliament has largely dashed
 labor's hopes for successful
 mediation.
 A spread of strike action
 to other sectors of the econ-
 omy and prolonged deadlocks in
 negotiations would further
 threaten Christian  Democrat
 party unity.   On 18 June, ex-
 Premier Scelba told the press
 that he and 52 other parlia-

 Christian Democrats to support

 DIEFENBAKER'S POLITICAL STANDING IN CANADA
 For the first time since
 he assumed office two years ago,
 public opinion polls  show  a
 marked decline in the popularity
 of Canada's Prime Minister Die-
 fenbaker,  Although this is
 probably due mainly to the eco-
 nomic recession from which
 Canada is only now recovering,
 his government is also under
 fire, even from his Conserva-
 tive party, for its handling of
 Canada's defense program. Criti-
 cism centers on what is consid-.
 ered an inept defense of the
 decision to abandon the CF-105
 interceptor program and substi-
 tute instead the US Bomarc mis-
 sile.         The Liberal opposition
 has apparently benefited from
 its intensive needling of the
 government on this issue, for
 it showed unexpectedly large
 gains in the 11 June provincial
 elections in Ontario, a Conserv-
 ative  stronghold.
 Diefenbaker is extremely
 sensitive to any indications
 that he is losing personal pres-
 tige.  In an effort to regain
 public support, the prime min-
 ister is believed planning a
 major cabinet reshuffle when
 the parliamentary session ends,
 probably late next month.  The
 able young minister of trans-
 port, George Hees, will prob-
 ably be advanced to the impor-
 tant Trade and Commerce Minis-
 try, and as many as six other
 members may be dropped from the
 cabinet.

 INDONESIAN ECONOMIC DETERIORATION
 Indonesia's    problem  of
 racing inflation has been aggra-
 vated by the country?s three-
 week political paralysis result-
 ing from the Constituent Assem-
 bly's rejection of the 1945 con-
 stitution on 2  June and                the
 army's subsequent ban on politi-
 cal activity.  The free-market
 rate for the rupiah  has declined
 by one third in the past two
 weeks, and an increasing number
 of shopkeepers prefer to barter
 products rather than to receive
 rupiahs.   The prices of essential
 commodities continue  to rise
 while wages remain relatively
 constant.
 Nine government  trading
 firms have a monopoly on imports,
 but have no capital and depend
 on credit from banks and the
 government.   Most of these firms
 are directed by army officers
 whose commercial inexperience
 slows and tangles the arrival of
 essential imports.   As the re-
 sult of the shortage of raw ma-
 terials, factories are working
 at less  than  50  percent  of
 capacity.
 The chief pinch from the
 deteriorating situation is felt
 by  city   dwellers--laborers,
 white-collar workers, and the
 armed forces-=all groups which
 are important Communist targets.
 The economic crisis has not yet
 affected the majority of the pop-
 ulation,  which is engaged in
 subsistence agriculture and is
 relatively uninvolved in the
 monetary economy.
 Swift and decisive action
 is needed if  permanent  and
 far-reaching economic  and po-
 litical  damage Is to be avoided.
 All  political  elements  are
 awaiting  President  Sukarno's
 return to Djakarta  on 29 June
 from  his  two months'   trip in
 the hope  he will break the im-
 passe.
 The Indonesian Army is ap-
 parently preparing plans for
 Sukarno's consideration on his
 return.   Army representatives
 have consulted Sukarno during
 his tour,   and Army Chief  of
 Staff   General  Nasution  has
 called a  meeting  of  regional
 commanders  stating that he
 "deems it necessary  to   take
 concrete action  toward finan-
 cial, economic, and Political
 stability."
 DALAI LAMA'S PRESS CONFERENCE
 The Dalai Lama's press con-
 ference on 20 June, ?particularly
 his forthright condemnation of
 Peiping and his proposals re-
 garding  the  future of Tibet,
 -could increase friction between
 him and New Delhi.   Apparently
 aware of this possibility, the
 Dalai Lama has stated that he
 does not intend to stay indefi-
 nitely  in  India                   or  "embar-
 rass  the Indian                  Government."
 He  apparently  will wait out
 official Indian reaction for
 about two'weeks and then request
 a meeting with Prime  Minister

 Some of the Dalai Lama's
 answers to questions by press

 New Delhi.   For example, his
 statement that he considers him-
 self head of a "government-in-

 conduct Tibet's affairs from
 within India.   Any such impres-
 sion would be heightened by his
 suggestion for the creation of a
 "greater Tibet" which would enjoy
 both'.internal and external free-
 dom and be guaranteed the return
 of the neighboring Chinese ter-

 Peiping has thus far chosen
 to ignore the Dalai Lama's state-

 attack it after appraising its
 impact in nonbloc capitals.   The
 Chinese delayed but eventually
 responded to the Dalai Lama's

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Agitation against the Com-
 munist government in India's
 Kerala State continues unabated.
 Political and communal opposi-
 tion groups bent on ousting the
 Communists are staging demonstra-
 tions almost daily, and more
 than 6,000 persons have been
 arrested to date.  However,
 there have been no serious clashes
 between the agitators and Com-
 munist-directed police since
 the incidents shortly after the
 campaign opened on 12 June--in
 which 12 persons were killed
 and many injured.   In addition
 to student groups and labor
 unions, the Moslem League and
 two small socialist parties now
 have endorsed the "direct action"
 campaign led by the Congress and
 Praja Socialist parties.
 Despite the opposition
 leaders' determination to press
 the fight to the end, their cam-
 paign may be weakened by inde-
 cisiveness in the top ranks of
 the Congress party's national
 leadership.  Prime Minister
 Nehru, who earlier this month
 reluctantly approved the agita-
 tion on condition that it re-
 main nonviolent, is increasing-
 ly concerned by press criticism
 that the Congress party in Kerala
 is trying to force an elected
 government out of office through
 unconstitutional means.   In ad-
 dition to possible damage to
 his party's position nationally,
 Nehru probably fears that his
 sanction of undemocratic tactics
 in Kerala will make it difficult
 IN KERALA
 for New Delhi to counter use
 of similar methods by Communist.
 and.right-wing communal groups
 in such other key- states as,
 West Bengal, Andhra, Bombay,
 and Madras.
 Nehru visited Kerala from
 22 to 24 June to assess the
 situation personally.   His con-
 versations with Communist and
 opposition leaders in the state
 may lead to an attempted com-
 promise between the warring
 groups.   Such a compromise would
 bolster the Communist govern-
 ment's position in Kerala tem-
 porarily and renew its deter-
 mination to stand firm.
 Demonstrations against the
 Communist government--perhaps
 accompanied by more violence--
 are likely to continue.   The
 possibility remains therefore
 that New Delhi may eventually
 feel compelled to step in and
 impose direct rule in th   tate.
 The Pakistani military re-
 gime, in dealing with its many
 major problems, is maintaining
 an atmosphere of progress large-
 ly by making  announcements of
 forthcoming programs.   Some
 tangible progress, however, is
 being made in land reform, refu-
 gee resettlement, and dismissal
 of corrupt government officials.

 SECRET
 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 25 June 1959
 In mid-June, the military
 regime made its first public
 commitment on the timing of the
 initial step toward a return to
 constitutional government by
 announcing that elections would
 be held this fall for representa-
 tive councils at the local level.
 The first elections, for councils
 in six districts, are scheduled
 for 7 October,  the anniversary
 of last year's coup.
 At the same time, plans were
 announced for moving the national
 capital from Karachi to northern
 West Pakistan, where, the climate
 is better.   The relocation,prob-
 ably some years off, would facil-
 itate government contacts with
 army headquarters at Rawalpindi.
 The government, controlled pre-
 dominantly by Punjabis and
 Pathans, apparently expects
 Pakistanis living outside the
 Punjab and Pathan areas to dis-
 approve of the shift.   It has
 announced plans for a secondary
 national capital in East Pakistan,
 apparently'in the hope of lessen-
 ing Bengali resentment of the
 Punjabis.
 In addition, the regime
 probably restored its reputation
 for removing corrupt elements
 from government posts when in
 mid-June it dismissed 20 offi-
 cials, forced the retirement of
 75, and demoted 13 for corrup-
 tion,  inefficiency, or miscon-
 duct, all in East Pakistan.
 The people in East Pakistan had
 become disillusioned by what
 they considered premature army
 withdrawal from the daily ad-
 ministration at the local level.
 They felt that the corrupt civil-
 service officials Who ran the
 government before the coup were
 still doing so.
 The National Bureau of Re-,
 construction, which has the
 avowed purpose of educating the
 people on the responsibilities
 of citizens, has acquired a
 staff and will probably become
 more active in the informational
 field.   One of its first acts
 has been the seizure of the pro-
 Communist Pakistan Times.
 Some progress is also being
 made on politically important
 economic problems.   Housing is
 being built on the outskirts of
 Karachi for refugees from India
 and Kashmir who have been a
 center of discontent since 1947.
 An estimated 70,000 refugees
 will be resettled by the end of
 summer.   The minister for ref-
 ugee rehabilitation has secured
 a new credit from West Germany
 for $28,000,000, part of which
 will be used for the resettle-
 ment programs
 The land-reform program
 apparently remains on schedule.
 Hearings are being held on the
 acquisition by the government
 of about 2,500,000 acres of
 land from some 3,000 landlords.
 About 1,250,000 acres are ex-
 pected to be cultivable and are
 scheduled for distribution to
 100,000 tenant farmers by Octbber
 1959.
 All of these programs ex-
 cept: refugee resettlement are
 likely to provoke opposition
 from specific interest groups.
 The regime, therefore, will
 probably press hard to produce
 early  benefits  from  its
 plans in order  to secure ad-
 ditional  popular support.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 DE GAULLE'S FRANCE
 De Gaulle seems confident
 he has successfully established
 a broad pattern for a renaissance
 in France's political, economic,
 and social structure, and he now
 is intent on instilling in both
 countrymen and allies his sense
 of France's "mission."  The Fifth
 Republic is less authoritarian
 than anticipated a year ago, na-
 tional unity has coalesced un-
 der his leadership, and France's
 international prestige is widen-
 ing.  Nevertheless, De Gaulle
 has still to solve the problems
 of Algeria and of political sta-
 bility after his departure, and
 his insistence on big-power in-
 ternational status is threaten-
 ing the Western alli-
 ance,
 Having achieved
 his initial long-range
 objective of overhaul-
 ing France's political
 institutions, De Gaulle
 now is concentrating
 on developing a spirit
 of national harmony
 based in part on an
 appreciation of French
 history and in part on
 a profound social ev-
 olution he hopes to
 achieve.  He is en-
 couraged in this hope
 by the rapidity with
 which financial sta-
 bility has been re-
 gained, and by the outlook for
 further economic expansion.
 In the series of tours he
 is making to all parts of France,
 he seems to be trying to revive
 in his countrymen his ideal im-
 age of France as the flower of
 centuries of Western civiliza-
 tion.          He combines praise and
 admonition in stressing re-
 peatedly that "France cannot be
 herself without being great."
 With surprising vigor he has
 developed a warm personal ap-
 proach in his appeal for na-
 tional unity, which he cites as
 a basic necessity for a solu-
 tion to France's most urgent
 problems.
 De Gaulle's Political Role
 De Gaulle's desire to be
 supreme arbiter of a democratic
 but politically stable France
 explains both his strategy and
 tactics in the past year.   He
 has maneuvered carefully from
 the beginning to avoid becom-
 ing a "prisoner" of the con-
 servative-military alliance
 which precipitated his return
 to power.  He included in his
 provisional government Social-
 ists, Popular Republicans, and
 Radicals identified with the
 old "party system," and refused
 to outlaw the French Communist
 party.
 The new consti-
 tution is a compro-
 mise between the
 authoritarian pres-
 idential regime De
 Gaulle once advo-
 cated and the Fourth
 Republic system in
 which the National
 Assembly was supreme.
 He had hopes that its
 provisions for pres-
 idential arbitration
 between the govern-
 ment and parliament
 would be facilitated
 by the election of an
 assembly fairly evenly
 balanced between left
 and right.  However,
 by maintaining personal control
 of key problems, he has made the
 best of the situation resulting
 from the election in November of
 an overwhelmingly rightist-
 oriented assembly.
 He warned the new deputies,
 under threat of dissolving the
 assembly, against attempting to
 undermine the reforms decreed
 by his provisional government
 and encouraged a "leftist Gaul-
 list" group which suspects the
 long--range aims of the dominant
 bloc of Independents and members
 of the Union for the New Repub-
 lic.

 Economic Resurgence
 In the bold economic re-
 form program instituted largely
 on the advice of Finance Minis-
 ter Pinay, De Gaulle has shown
 willingness to rely on profes-
 sional guidance in areas where
 he lacks technical competence.
 The currency reform, trade lib-
 eralization, and austerity pro-
 grams now in effect are basi-
 cally the financial stabiliza-
 tion measures long recommended
 by the International Monetary
 Fund for sound economic growth.
 Their success to date owes much
 to the fundamental progress in
 reconstruction and plant modern-
 ization begun under the Fourth
 Republic, but  De  Gaulle's au-
 thority was essential to  in-
 duce vested interests to accept
 an  end to subsidies, protected
 markets, and uneconomic public
 services.
 Despite curtailment of so-
 cial benefits and the reduced
 purchasing power which the aus-
 terity program imposed on the
 working class, labor   showed
 great  self-restraint in  de-
 ferring claims for long overdue
 wage increases.   The govern-
 ment's increasingly optimistic
 statements on  the  improving
 foreign  exchange  situation,
 however, and the definite signs
 of economic recovery from the
 slight 1958 recession have en-
 couraged labor demands.                     Some
 wage adjustments may have to be
 made in the nationalized indus-
 tries this year rather than in
 1960, as the government  had
 hoped.   Working-class discon-
 tent may also be alleviated by
 plans to improve educational
 opportunities for children of
 low-income families, and by
 greatly expanded housing  con-
 struction.
 De Gaulle and Algeria
 De Gaulle probably never
 envisaged an early solution to
 the Algerian problem.   He has
 concentrated primarily on calm-
 ing the atmosphere of the 13
 May 1958 coup, and avoided
 specific commitments.   Accept-
 ing the need for army support
 to carry out any policy in Al-
 geria, he agrees with the army
 that genuine political, eco-
 nomic, and  social  equality
 should be granted to the Moslems
 and that the privileged position
 of the European settlers is in-
 compatible with this goal.   The
 army  now  seems ready to obey
 De Gaulle  in  any  showdown
 with  the settlers,  who are
 indignant over the  failure
 to adopt  a policy  of com-
 plete integration of Algeria
 with France.
 De Gaulle has left open a
 decision on the ultimate rela-
 tionship between Algeria and
 the metropole, on the grounds
 that the eventual political
 solution can come only from the
 Algerians themselves through
 universal suffrage.   In the
 meantime, he is pressing the
 economic organization  of Al-
 geria which  will permit France
 "to forge   indissoluble bonds"
 with the  area.  He insists that
 only a thorough social  and eco-
 nomic evolution                                                              will save Al-
 geria for France.   "If                                                             this
 evolution fails, even pacifica-
 tion is completed, Algeria will
 be quickly lost to us.  Papa's
 Algeria is dead."
 Recent French military
 successes have  encouraged the
 view in  Paris that the victory
 demanded  by the  army is in
 sight.   The French  Government
 seemm34ncreasingly,inclined to
 view the outcome of the war, now
 in its fifth. year, as depending
 on tl}e active support of France's
 allies for French policy. While
 De Gaulle waits for'.the rebels
 to accept a"peace of. the brave,"
 however, his time may be running
 out on the clock of internation-
 al opinion.

 The difficulties for the
 Western Alliance anticipated
 when De Gaulle came to power
 wants a tripartite US-UK-French
 arrangement to plan Western global
 political and military strategy.
 He wants a veto power for France
 have been gradually emerging in
 on its allies' use of

 The nuclear-weapons question
 will deteriorate if its national
 is becoming
 an increasingly sharp
 sovereignty is in any way im-
 paired.   He argues, moreover,
 that NATO no longer corresponds
 geographically to strategic real-
 ities, and that the defense of
 Europe cannot be separated from
 that of Africa and the Middle
 East.
 One aspect of his thinking
 in this regard may be a desire
 to see France as the keystone
 of a Eurafrican community large
 and strong enough'  to stand up
 to the United States or the USSR.
 As its president, De Gaulle has
 so far successfully pre-empted
 the decision-making functions for
 the French Community.   He presum-
 ably hopes its institutions and
 working patterns will be well
 established by the time African
 representatives push their claims
 for a more important role.
 While De Gaulle has taken
 the position that France would
 honor existing commitments to the
 six-nation European community,
 the Debre government has not
 hesitated to hamper the Coal-
 Steel Community High Authority,
 and the tendency has been to en-
 courage bilateral rapprochements
 with France's larger Continental
 neighbors.   The French-German re-
 lationship is the most noteworthy
 example, but stronger Italian and
 Spanish ties seem to be envisaged
 also.   If the reunification of
 Germany were likely, De Gaulle
 might revise his views on French-
 German cooperation.   His public
 recognition of the Oder-Neisse
 line against Bonn's wishes appears
 designed to conciliate Poland,
 where he spent some time after
 World World I and toward which
 the French have traditionally
 been friendly.

 mined to test a nuclear weapon,
 probably by early 1960, regard-

 De Gaulle and the Bloc
 Despite his current firm
 position on Berlin, De Gaulle
 views East-West relations in a
 long-range perspective which pro-
 vides for France an "independent
 role" between East and West. He
 remarked cryptically last summer
 that "France is in the Western
 world, to which we belong with-
 out having to confine ourselves
 to it."  He regards Communism as
 a transient phenomenon, and re-
 cently advanced the idea that as
 time passes the Soviet Union will
 become increasingly "European-
 ized" as it becomes subject to
 pressure from Communist China.
 In the meantime he believes that
 the West must be very firm in op-
 posing Soviet threats--as on Ber-
 lin--but always ready to talk.
 He is undoubtedly sincere
 in his recent proposal for a joint
 East-West undertaking to assist
 underdeveloped areas of the world,
 but he also appears to regard it
 as a clever propaganda device to
 embarrass the USSR.   In spite of
 American opposition to such a pro-
 posal, he will probably continue
 insisting on its inclusion in any
 summit agenda as another means of
 demonstrating French independence.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 politically impossible for New
 Delhi to rely heavily on im-
 ports from Pakistan and, since
 Karachi planned to construct
 mills to process its own cotton
 and jute,  India had to increase
 rapidly the output of food-
 grains, jute,  and cotton.
 India made little progress
 for several years, however, ex-
 cept in the case of jute,  large-
 ly because of unfavorable mon-
 soons.   During the years immedi-
 ately following partition, New
 Delhi was forced to devote a ma-
 jor part of its energies to re-
 juvenating  its war-worn trans-
 portation system,   dealing with
 the refugee problem,  and absorb-
 ing the former princely states.
 During the late 1940s and
 early 1950s,per capita produc-
 tion of food grains stood at less
 than 13 ounces--1,300 calories--
 daily.  Production of other foods
 raised this to nearly 1,700 cal-
 ories daily--at least 25 percent
 below what is considered desir-
 able, compelling the government
 to use its foreign exchange re-
 sources for food imports.   The
 unusually poor crop year of 1950-
 51, when famine was averted only
 by a $180,000,000 wheat loan
 from the United States, made gov-
 ernment leaders realize that a
 major attack on agricultural
 problems could no longer be de-
 layed.
 First Five-Year Plan (1951-56)
 The First Five-Year Plan
 (1951-56) placed major emphasis
 on agriculture, which received
 about 34 percent of the govern-
 ment's economic development ex-
 penditures.   Irrigation was
 planned for an additional 8,500,-
 000 acres of land, over a million
 acres were to be reclaimed, ag-
 ricultural research was to be
 expanded, and a start was to be
 made on expanding fertilizer
 production and distributing bet-
 ter seeds.   In addition, the
 Community Development Program
 and the National Extension Serv-
 ice were organized to end the
 iso]Lation of 550,000 villages
 and supply modern agricultural
 knowledge to the peasants.
 New Delhi estimated that
 the program would increase the
 output of food grains 14 percent
 by 1955-56--from an average har-
 vest before the plan of 54,900,-
 000 metric tons to 62,600,000
 metric tons.   Production of other
 crops was also to increase 14
 percent.   While irrigation and
 community development programs
 were not completely fulfilled,
 the agricultural production tar-
 gets were reached largely because
 of the adoption of better farm-
 ing practices.
 Actual production of food
 grains in 1955-56 reached 66,300,-
 000 tons,  and production during
 the two previous years--when
 there were particularly good mon-
 soons--was even higher.   Part
 of the increase recorded during
 this period probably resulted
 from better statistical coverage,
 particularly in the former prince-
 ly states, and actual production
 during the base year may have
 been as high as 57-59,000,000
 tons,   Nevertheless, food-grain
 production increased by the 14
 percent scheduled and may have
 risen even more.
 Production of other crops
 also rose by approximately the
 14 percent scheduled.   Of the
 major crops, only jute fell sub-
 stantially short of its target;
 cotton and oilseeds exceeded
 their goals and sugar cane fell
 somewhat short.
 Second Five-Year Plan (1956-61)
 Encouraged by the results
 of the first plan--which ended
 the stagnation of agriculture
 and enabled New Delhi to reduce
 food-grain imports from 4,800,-
 000 tons in 1951 to 767,000 tons
 in 1955--government leaders decided
 that  while agriculture would
 continue to receive substantial
 funds, the emphasis in the Second
 Five-Year Plan (1956-61) could
 safely be shifted to industrial

 development.   Food-grain pro-
 duction was scheduled to increase
 by 15 percent from 66,300,000
 tons in 1955-56 to 76,200,000
 tons in 1960-61, and production
 of other crops was to increase
 by 22 percent.
 Early in the plan period,
 however, the government became
 increasingly concerned over in-
 flationary dangers and recog-
 nized that the population was
 increasing more rapidly than
 previously estimated.   They
 raised the target for the pro-
 duction of food grains by 1960-
 61 to 81,800,000 tons--23 per-
 cent more than .1955-56--without,
 however, allocating more funds
 to agriculture.
 Production during the first
 year of the plan rose substan-
 tially, but a severe drought
 reduced production to 63,000,000
 tons in 1957-58.  The fact that
 the country was still so depend-
 ent on the monsoon apparently
 surprised many Indians, and
 plans were made to devote more
 attention to agricultural needs
 during the remaining years of
 the second plan.   These efforts
 combined with a better than
 average monsoon during 1958-59
 to raise output to 74,200,000
 tons.   Thus,  India is likely to
 exceed the original goals of
 the second plan and may even
 reach the revised'.target.
 Production of jute and tea
 surpassed the 1960-61 plan goals
 in 1958-59.   Production of oil-
 seeds is ahead of schedule, but
 output of cotton and sugar cane
 --which approached 1960-61 tar-
 get levels in the early years
 of the second plan--declined
 somewhat this year.
 Third Five-Year Plan (1961-66)
 During the past 18 months,
 New Delhi has come to realize
 that the increase of nearly 30
 percent in crop production since
 1950-51 represents. only a be-
 ginning toward meeting the coun-
 try's needs.   New Delhi  now

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 intends to give greater emphasis
 to agriculture during the Third
 Five-Year Plan (1961-66) in or-
 der to more than double its rate
 of growth.   The targets for 1965-
 66 now being discussed by the
 Planning Commission include 111,-
 800,000 metric tons of food
 grains, 1,470,000 tons of cot-
 ton, 1,155, 000 tons of jute, 91,-
 440,000 tons of sugar cane, and
 9,144,000 tons of oilseeds.   In
 addition, New Delhi hopes to
 increase by 50 to 100 percent
 the output of such items as eggs,
 milk, and fish--products needed
 to provide a more balanced diet.
 Outlook
 India's chances of achiev-
 ing such ambitious levels of
 production depend on two major
 factors other than normal weather
 conditions.      The first, and least
 difficult, is the allocation of
 sufficient resources to agricul-
 ture.          A sharp increase in funds
 and personnel devoted to agri-
 cultural research, irrigation,
 land reclamation and water man-
 agement and to the production
 of chemical fertilizers, agri-
 cultural implements, and high-
 quality seeds will be necessary.
 Most of these costs will be rupee
 rather than foreign exchange
 costs, so it is within New Delhi's
 capacity to make the resources
 available.   Since investment in
 agriculture yields a higher re-
 turn than that in any other""ac-
 tivity, such an allocation of
 resources would also tend to
 maximize economic growth.
 The second and more diffi-
 cult task is to organize  the
 effort to aid agriculture in such
 a manner that the resources al-
 located actually help'-the peas-
 ant increase his production.
 Disseminating agricultural knowl-
 edge,  improved seeds, chemical
 fertilizers, and consolidating
 the  numerous scattered plots
 cultivated by most peasants--
 which average about seven acres
 --will require substantial im-

 istration, particularly at the
 local level, in view of the ap-

 involved.
 Even if New Delhi is able
 to make considerable progress in
 carrying out these tasks, there
 will. still remain the problem
 of providing the incentives nec-
 essary to induce the peasants
 to make greater efforts.   At
 present the peasant must pay
 from 25 to 75 percent on money
 he borrows from local moneylend-
 ers for seed, fertilizer, or
 other similar needs.   Then, be-
 cause he has little storage space,
 he must sell his crop to the
 local trader at harvest time--
 when prices are low.                                                              Faced with
 this situation, he often sees
 little reason to increase pro-
 duction when he receives little
 benefit from his efforts.
 New Delhi has already de-
 cided to try to establish agri-
 cultural cooperatives throughout
 the country in the next three
 years to provide credit, seed,
 fertilizer, and agricultural im-
 plements at prices the peasants
 can afford.   In addition, the
 government is considering the
 establishment of agricultural
 price supports to provide as-
 sured prices to farmers who are
 willing to raise production.
 Such a program would also re-
 quire the construction of small
 storage warehouses throughout
 the country within the reach of
 the peasants.
 Despite numerous indications
 that the government will allocate
 the necessary resources to agri-
 culture,  it probably will not be
 able to organize the necessary
 effort to carry out its programs
 on schedule.  The establishment

 duction,                     and it should be
 able to  produce  nearly 100,-
 000,000 tons of               food grains
 by  1965-66.   Such an  increase
 would  represent  a  growth of
 production  about twice as rap-
 id as  that of population, thus
 making  possible  a  slow  but
 steady  improvement  in  the
 diet  of  the Indian  people.
 THE SOVIET CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY
 The Soviet Seven-Year Plan
 (1959-65) for the construction
 industry calls for a volume of
 construction and installation
 work equal to nearly 90 percent
 of that carried out in the USSR
 since 1917.   Greater mechaniza-
 tion--a topic of the current
 party central committee plenum
 --and related increases in
 labor productivity are vital to
 fulfillment of the program.
 While gains in these fields
 have been impressive in the
 last ten years, plans for com-
 missioning facilities in heavy
 industry were consistently
 underfulfilled during the Fifth
 Five-Year Plan (1951-55) and
 in the following years.   Con-
 tinuing shortfalls in meeting
 schedules have  demonstrated
 that planning officials still
 impose tasks on the construc-
 tion industry which exceed its
 recently strengthened capabili-
 ties.   More realistic schedul-
 ing of project completion dates
 and increased efficiency are
 necessary to avoid dispropor-:.
 tions in the economy which
 could jeopardize fulfillment
 of major 1965 production goals
 in other sectors of the economy.
 Investment Patterns
 Capital investment in the
 construction and construction-
 materials industries over the
 next seven years is to amount
 to 110-112 billion rubles--an
 increase of about 80 percent
 above  the investment made dur-
 ing 1,952-58,   The annual plan
 for 1.959 calls for 14.3 billion
 rubles of capital investments
 in the two industries, close to
 the average annual investment
 of 15.9 billion rubles required
 to fulfill the Seven-Year Plan..
 The pattern seems to have been
 one of high percentage increases
 prior to the Seven-Year Plan,
 with the rates of increase fall-
 ing off in the early years of
 the plan, and a nearly constant
 volume of investment in the
 later.. years?  A similar pat-
 tern of investment growth ap-
 parently is scheduled for the
 cement industry.
 In contrast to the nation-
 al pattern of investment growth
 in the construction and con-
 struction materials. industries,
 regional patterns evidently are
 subject to a substantially dif-
 ferent time sequence.   Capital
 investments for these indus-
 tries in the Karaganda Economic
 Region reportedly are "incor-
 rectly distributed" under the
 Seve:ri-Year Plan, with only 30
 percent of the total allocated
 for the first three years.
 Moreover, Gosplan RSFSR reduced
 the investment allocation for
 development of the construction
 industry in Krasnoyarsk Kray by
 30 percent in 1959 compared with
 1958, despite the complaint that
 such investments should be ac-
 celerated in the first years of
 the plan in order to provide
 the base for fulfillment of the

 Such complaints indicate
 that sufficient provision is
 not being made for the neces-
 sary early development of the
 construction base in at least
 some of the eastern regions of
 the USSR.  Relatively heavy in-

 Productivity -_Mechanization
 During the Seven-Year Plan,
 labor productivity in the con-
 struction industry is to be in-
 creased by 60-65 percent--16-17
 percent by greater use of pre-
 cast concrete compo-
 nents, 21-23 percent
 by improved technol-
 ogy, and organization
 of construction, and
 23-25 percent by in-
 creased  mechaniza.;-
 tion of construction.
 Heavy restrictions on
 use  of structural
 steel generally limit
 the choice to con-
 crete poured in place
 or precast concrete
 components.  The lat-
 ter saves on labor,
 and by 1965 use of pre-
 cast components is to
 be expanded to about
 200 cubic meters per
 million rubles of con-
 struction work, com-
 pared with about 113
 cubic meters in 1957.
 Technology and
 organization can be
 improved by reducing
 idle time of workers
 and by organizing most
 of them into teams of
 carpenters, concrete
 workers, bricklayers,
 and plasterers.   Im-
 provement of the wage
 structure in favor of
 construction workers
 in recent years should continue
 to ease the problem of labor
 turnover in construction and
 thereby provide some gains in
 productivity.
 Major attention is to be
 centered  on  the  drive  to in-
 crease mechanization.   Net an-
 nual additions to construction
 equipment from 1951 to 1957
 averaged nearly 2,700 excavators,
 3,000  bulldozers, and 4,300
 mobile cranes.  During the Seven-
 Year Plan net annual additions
 are to average about 3,700 ex-
 cavators, more than 5,000 bull-
 dozers, and about 3,000 mobile
 cranes.  The most glaring defi-
 ciencies in basic equipment--
 the absence of self-powered
 scrapers and graders and a short-
 age of small excavators--are to

 be  eased  during       the  plan
 period.
 The USSR has succeeded in
 recent years in substantially
 raising the level of mechaniza-
 tion in many construction oper-
 ations, although the planned
 levels have generally been un-
 derfulfilled. One of the most
 troublesome problems has been
 the low level of mechanization
 of loading and unloading work,
 21 percent of which was still
 performed entirely by hand in
 1957.  The Seven-Year Plan would
 reduce such hand work to 8-10
 percent ia.1965.   Levels of
 complete mechanization in other
 operations are to be raised
 considerably.   In addition,
 idle time of equipment is to be
 reduced, and utilization of con-
 struction equipment is to be
 raised by 25-30 percent.
 The plan for raising labor
 productivity is considerably
 more stringent when viewed in
 conjunction with the planned re-
 duction in the workday and work-
 week.                                                      Labor productivity in
 term,  of hourly output must in-
 crease 80-85 percent in order
 to raise productivity in terms
 of annual output by the planned
 60-65 percent.
 The regime plans to achieve
 construction goals with approx-
 imately the same number of
 total workers and employees in
 construction in 1965 as in 1958.
 The number of workers directly
 engaged in construction work is
 to be increased by 10-12 per-
 cent, however, compared with a
 55-percent increase during the
 1951-?57 period.
 Successes and Shortcomings
 Reflecting the consider-
 able success in raising the
 levels of mechanization and
 labor productivity in recent
 years, the construction industry
 as a whole became a profitable
 operation in 1955.   Actual
 construction  costs  have  been

 planned costs in recent years,
 although only slightly so for
 housing construction.  The ag-
 gregate volumes of construc-
 tion work planned for both 1957
 and 1958 were overfulfilled.
 Despite these favorable
 indications of increased capa-
 bilities on the part of the
 construction industry,  itself,
 however, construction schedul-
 ing remains a substantial prob-
 lem.   Plans for commissioning
 additional facilities have been
 underfulfilled year after year.
 Underfulfillment occurred in
 several important heavy indus-
 tries in 1958.  The 1958 plan
 for new capacity in the cement
 industry was under-
 fulfilled by 40 per-
 cent, the coal in-
 dustry by 29 percent,
 the chemical indus-
 try by 67 percent,
 and thermal electric
 power industry by 23
 percent.   In the fer-
 rous metallurgical
 industry, pig iron ca-
 pacity was overful-
 filled; crude and
 finished steel were
 underfulfilled. The
 plan for new capac-
 ity  in  iron  ore
 mining was underful-
 filled by about 9
 percent, but this
 was a substantial
 improvement over the
 30-percent shortfall
 from the more ambi-
 tious plan of the
 previous year.
 by the resources made available
 has resulted in the practice
 of dispersing investments among
 too many projects and in pro-
 longed periods of construction.
 More efficient organization of
 construction activity cannot
 by itself solve this problem.
 ]Housing Program Impact
 A sizable part of the short-
 falls in meeting 1958 schedules
 for new heavy-industry capacity
 must have resulted from the pres-
 sure put on construction re-
 sources by the substantial over-
 fulfillment of the housing con-
 struction program that year.
 Khrushchev's commitment to bet-
 ter housing is causing mounting

 (1959-65)
 pressure on available construc-
 tion resources--pressure which
 will continue at least through
 1960 if present plans are main-
 tained.  Because of the lack of
 realism in the planned cost re-
 ductions in housing construc-
 tion,  if housing plans are to
 be fulfilled, the volume of con-
 struction in state housing as
 a percent of the total volume
 of state construction work in
 the USSR will. have to be 32
 percent in 1957, 35 percent in
 1958,   38  percent  in  1959,
 The basic cause of short-
 falls in meeting construction
 schedules in past years is that
 Soviet planning authorities
 have consistently underestimated
 the volume of capital investment
 and of construction resources
 required, and have given the
 construction industry too low
 a priority among the various
 competitors for resources.   The

 25 July 1959
 and as much as 42 percent in
 1960.
 The present housing pro-
 gram is a keystone in the ef-
 fort to improve the lot of the
 consumer.  The original Sixth
 Five-Year Plan (1956-1960) for
 state-built housing was subse-
 quently reaffirmed in a special
 housing decree in July 1957,
 which also placed increased
 emphasis on private housing.
 This reaffirmation and exten-
 sion took place despite the
 fact that the Sixth Five-Year
 Plan had to be dropped at
 about this time.   Under the
 new Seven-Year Plan, housing
 construction apparently is to
 level off at the higher plateau
 to be reached in 1960.   Urban
 housing will increase by an
 average of 8 percent per year.
 Even at such a high rate, how-
 ever, the housing space per
 capita will still be far below
 the standards of advanced West-
 ern countries in 1965.
 Recent Measures
 The party has issued sever-
 al decrees recently to ease the
 pressure on capital resources.
 In October 1958 a decree was is-
 sued to accomplish a drastic
 cutback in construction of ad-
 ministrative buildings, thea-
 ters, clubs, and the like. There
 had been some diversion of in-
 vestments from heavy industrial
 construction and housing into
 less essential local needs; this
 decree was expected to give the
 central government greater con-
 trol over the use of investment
 funds.
 A more recent decree abol-
 ished the Agricultural Bank,
 the Bank for Financing Communal
 and Housing Construction, and
 the communal banks, and merged
 their functions with the State
 Bank and the Industrial Bank
 (the latter now being called
 "Stroybank"--the All-Union Bank
 for Financing Capital Invest-
 ments).  A third decree was
 aimed, at placing greater empha-
 sis on increasing output by
 means of intensifying the use
 of existing capacity and by ex--
 panding existing enterprises
 and less emphasis on more cost-
 ly new construction.
 Some temporary easing of
 the pressure on construction re-
 sources was achieved in 1958 by
 concentrating investments on
 the most important projects and
 those nearing completion.  Be-
 cause of such measures, the
 volume of unfinished construc-
 tion (i.e., the volume of work
 performed on projects not yet
 in operation) grew by only 3
 billion rubles in 1958, compared
 with increases of about 10 bil--
 lion rubles in 1956 and 1957.
 Soviet planning authorities
 have decried the growing volume
 of unfinished construction but
 have consistently overestimated
 the extent to which the volume
 of such construction could fea-
 sibly be cut back and to which
 this would ease the pressure on
 construction resources.  The.
 past few years have shown that
 construction schedules for heavy
 industry and housing are more
 likely to be met by allocating
 a greater volume of construction
 resources to these ends than
 by cutting back the volume of
 unfinished construction.
 In general, the success of
 the Seven-Year Plan for construc-
 tion still depends--particularly
 in 1959 and 1960--on the estab-
 lishment  of  a  better  rela-
 tionship between plans for the
 volume of construction work,
 schedules for completion of con-
 struction projects, and the re-
 sources which are to be made
 available to the construction
 industry.                       Pre-
