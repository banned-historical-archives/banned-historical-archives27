 Weakness in China's supply of energy has already forced Beijing to make
 major changes in .the country's. long-term political and economic policies.
 China's need for new technology, both to explore and develop new energy
 resources and to improve the efficiency of energy use, is one of the most
 important motivations for Beijing to strengthen commercial links with the
 Western world, particularly the United States

 Perspective
 US Involvement in China's Energy Sector
 President Reagan's visit to Beijing comes at a time when the energy sector is
 developing into one of the best. venues for mutual cooperation between China
 and the United States.
 China has good reasons for wanting to increase the flow of Western technology
 and capital into its energy sector. We anticipate, and this is reflected in many
 Chinese policy statements, that, even with this new technology, pressures on
 China's energy supplies will increase through the rest of the 1980s:
 Offshore oil production may not be available soon enough to offset an
 expected decline in production from the country's large but mature onshore
 oilfields.
 Coal production, because it is being counted on to substitute for oil wherever
 possible, will be hard pressed to provide the energy needed to fuel economic
 growth.
 e Electricity shortages, caused by insufficient investment in recent years and
 surging demand, may become the most critical short-term constraint to    25X1
 Beijing must resolve these and other potentially divisive problems if satisfac-
 tory economic growth is to be attained. Since 1978, China has made
 exceptional progress in improving the efficiency with which its economy uses
 energy. This has allowed fairly rapid economic growth and a large increase in
 energy exports despite slow and erratic increases in the production of energy.
 Unlike most countries, China has done this without sharp increases in energy
 pricesF___~                                                     25X1
 Two important decisions now being debated are whether to reduce or even
 eventually eliminate petroleum exports-20 percent of the country's foreign
 exchange earnings-and how to build the political consensus that is needed to
 increase domestic energy prices sharply.                        25X1

 The government's ability to channel energy supplies toward industry should
 allow the economy to increase at a modest 4- or 5-percent rate through the
 1980s-slower than in the past but faster than that initially planned by
 Beijing. We doubt, however, that the much faster growth presently expected
 by Beijing for the 1990s can be achieved without putting undue strain on the
 energy sector.
 The Chinese appear anxious to promote still closer linkages with US energy
 firms and will continue to pressure the US Government for maximum latitude
 in technology transfer issues. Many Chinese leaders, however, still hope only to
 borrow this technology from the West in order to learn it quickly and regain
 energy self-reliance in the decade ahead. This is particularly true within
 China's very large and politically powerful energy industries
 The depth of cooperation with the West-and China's long-term ability to
 meet its energy requirements-is critically dependent on large oil discoveries
 being made in China's offshore regions. Should the Western firms that are
 scheduled to drill dozens of wells this year not find the oil deposits they expect,
 China may have to decide between importing oil in the 1990s-at great
 expense to the country's international financial position-or returning to the
 more self-reliant and isolationist policies of the past.

 Oil /Market Trends     Despite tension in the Middle East, sluggish oil consumption has kept oil prices
 soft in recent weeks. Spot prices for most Middle East crudes are $0.10 to
 $0.50 per barrel below official prices, while North Sea and Light African
 crudes are at or near official prices. Oil sales in the United States rose during 25X1
 the first quarter, reflecting increased industrial activity and colder-than-
 normal weather. In contrast, February oil sales in Italy and France dropped by
 about 3 percent and 7 percent, respectively, following sharp gains registered in
 January. Data from the International Energy Agency indicate inventories fell
 by only about 1 million b/d during the first quarter-considerably less than oil
 companies had anticipated. If companies attempt to pare high inventories, oil
 prices could face renewed downward pressure during the coming months.    25X1

 Ir  and Japan                              Iran is prepared to offer Japanese traders favorable ZDA-I
 incentive, Tehran may be willing to increase imports from Japan at the
 expense of West Germany and other countries, which are not buying as much 25X1
 oil as Tehran expected. Iran's overtures may win over the Japanese, who have
 been holding out for price concessions and, to a lesser extent, for opportunities
 to increase exports to Iran.F                                          25X1
 Japan should not experience serious problems arranging for the delivery of
 Iranian oil, barring an.Iragi attack on Khark Island or Iraqi airstrikes on
 shipping in the Persian Gulf. Press reports indicate Tehran has deposited $100
 million into a London bank to insure all tankers loading oil at Khark Island.
 Iranian insurance coverage and an oversupply in the world oil tanker market
 will encourage shippers to continue loading oil at Khark Island. The press
 reports that the Japanese are chartering foreign flag vessels to transport
 Iranian oil, however, because the Japanese Seamen's Union has refused to load
 tankers stopping at Khark Island, following recent Iraqi attacks on shipping.

 OPEC countries also are offering nonpetroleum products in barter agreements.
 Ecuador is swapping foodstuffs for industrial and consumer goods. Indonesia
 reportedly has exported nonoil products worth $765 million in the past two
 years through barter deals. Venezuela is trading finished aluminum for
 Jamaican bauxite. The role of barter is likely to expand until the global
 economy improves.
 United Kingdom Steps   In a move to accelerate the pace of onshore oil and gas exploration, the UK
 Up Onshore Petroleum   Department of Energy has announced a new onshore licensing system that is
 Exploration            parallel to the licensing procedure for offshore areas. London apparently wants
 to explore options that could help offset projected declines in British North Sea
 oil production. The government will begin.to offer onshore areas in regular
 licensing rounds, possibly beginning this June, rather than on an ad hoc basis.
 Moreover, the government will authorize six-year exploration licenses and five-
 year appraisal permits. Although the United Kingdom currently produces only
 5,000 b/d of oil onshore, prospects of increasing production from areas such as
 Wytch Farm-where production is projected to reach 40,000 b/d by 1987-
 and lower drilling costs have renewed industry interest in onshore areas.
 Canadian Petroleum     At the request of Canada's National Energy Board, the Canadian Petroleum
 ation Updates    Association (CPA}-an independent industry group including most of the
 As,Xi
 Fo ecast               major oil companies operating in Canada-has updated its forecast of
 indigenous oil and natural gas supplies through 1995. The CPA estimates that,
 under present economic and operating conditions, Canada's oil production
 capacity will decline from about 1.5 million b/d in 1984 to 1.2 million b/d in
 1995. Conventional crude oil production is expected to decline rapidly over this
 period, and, by the mid-1990s, oil sands projects and production from future
 tertiary recovery projects probably will account for about one-half of total oil
 production. CPA's projection excludes any oil from Canada's "frontier" areas
 because of technical, jurisdictional, and fiscal constraints. In addition, the
 association forecasts Canadian natural gas supplies to be ample to meet
 projected domestic requirements and existing export commitments.

 greater than the same period last year. Manufactured and semimanufactured

 soybeans and other agricultural products, will soon permit the easing of import
 restraints on raw materials and capital goods and spur an industrial recovery
 in the second half of 1984.
 Peruvian IMF Program
 Threatened
 We believe Brasilia may use its improved export performance to attempt to ex-
 act more generous terms from foreign bankers. in debt talks and thus help
 sustain a recovery. Because of the $2.4 billion first-quarter trade surplus, the
 government's economic team is more confident that Brazil will achieve the $9
 billion trade surplus target under its IMF program and substantially increase
 its precariously low foreign exchange reserves

 Mounting political and social pressures -prompted Peruvian President Belaunde
 to dismiss Finance Minister Rodriguez Pastor last month and to ease the
 government's strict austerity measures. A continuation of'restrictive govern-

 percent decline in GDP and 125-percent inflation-produced a nationwide
 general strike and a strong public outcry against the IMF in March. In
 response to rising popular opposition to austerity policies, President Belaunde
 last week appropriated an additional $120 million in public funds to be used
 with foreign development financing for public-sector infrastructure projects.

 The remaining $100 million scheduled for

 meet its IMF policy targets because the recent budget appropriations probably
 will cause the deficit to exceed the IMF ceiling.                               25X1

 The Commission has invoked GATT Article XXVIII, which provides for

 the Community may offer to eliminate the variable levy it now charges on corn
 imported for the manufacture of starch. If the United States and the
 Community do not reach a compensation agreement within 90 days of GATT
 notification and the Community presses ahead and imposes new duties, the
 United States will be free to retaliate. Should the EC succeed in raising tariffs
 on feed grain substitutes, the move could encourage the Community to lift zero

 domestically manufactured passenger vehicles. Hawke's move will trim quotas
 and reduce tariffs by two-thirds, down to the average rate of protection for
 manufacturing. We believe Hawke will face considerable opposition to the new
 policy from the auto industry, organized labor, and even some members of his
 Cabinet. He probably will be forced to settle for smaller reductions as he
 advances the legislation in the months ahead

 The Greek business community is in an uproar over a proposed trade law that
 would regulate prices and profit margins based on a complex formula involving
 interest rates, tax indexes, inflation, and the general state of the economy. The        25X1
 law also introduces new distribution and marketing regulations, and establish-

 been careful to avoid directly criticizing Prime Minister Papandreou or
 National Economy Minister Arsenis, apparently because they still hope to
 influence policy:
 Greek private investment has been declining since 1980, and, as the economy
 deteriorates, a growing number of private firms are experiencing serious
 financial difficulties. With unemployment currently about 8 percent and
 rising, the government has responded by taking over several "ailing enter-
 prises" to prevent bankruptcies and save jobs. The interventionist policies of
 Papandreou, however, have many businessmen convinced that Athens intends
 to nationalize nearly all private industry, and the proposed trade bill reinforces
 this perception. Without a reverse. in policies, private investment will remain
 depressed and economic growth stagnant.

 Chilean Economic
 Moves
 Although Chile's new economic team is publicly calling for only cautious
 reflation to avoid a confrontation with international lenders, more expansionist
 economic measures are likely to be taken. The Economy Minister has promised
 publicly to reduce unemployment without jeopardizing IMF targets by helping
 construction and agriculture and providing domestic firms with debt relief.
 the Finance
 Minister-a political' ally of Interior Minister Jarpa, who favors a quicker
 recovery-has privately stated that inflation could be allowed to double to
 reduce unemployment.
 The reactivation measures publicly announced thus far will decrease unem-
 ployment gradually but are unlikely to produce the public perception of a
 strong recovery that is necessary to reduce political discontent. More aggres-
 sive economic policies, however, could upset negotiations for a $780 million
 loan from foreign bankers. Nonetheless, in view of President Pinochet's
 strategy to undercut support for the protest movement, we believe the new
 economic team is likely to opt for a more rapid recovery and will seek
 increased official borrowing to support its efforts

 Soviet Foreign Trade   Recently published Soviet data indicate that the USSR's foreign trade surplus
 S rplus.Increases      increased last year. Moscow reduced its assistance to the East European
 nations by cutting its trade surplus with them. Nonetheless, the Soviets' trade
 surplus with Communist countries as a group increased slightly.
 A decline in imports from the developed Western countries allowed Moscow to
 increase its trade surplus with non-Communist countries, despite the slow
 growth of Soviet exports. Soviet purchases of grain and other agricultural
 products fell as a result of improved harvests in 1982 and 1983. Most of the re-
 duction was in imports from the United States. The USSR was able to
 increase export earnings from non-Communist countries for the second year in-
 a row, despite a drop in world oil prices. The Soviets raised oil exports to the
 West by 150,000 barrels a day to about 1.7 million barrels, primarily by
 reexporting oil they obtained from OPEC nations. Arms sales are second only
 to oil as a hard currency earner but may have declined for the year because of
 a drop in sales during the last quarter.

 Summit Issues:
 Big Six Interest Rates
 This is the first of several articles that in the
 coming weeks will examine economic issues affect-
 ing the countries participating in the London Sum-

 We believe that the present high level of real
 interest rates is (holding back the economic recovery
 in Western Europe and retarding economic growth
 in Japan and Canada. Both nominal and real
 interest rates in the Big Six countries presently are
 higher than the, rates that existed at the start of the
 1976 recovery. While nominal rates in the Big Six
 are now up an average of about one-half a percent-
 age point, real rates are about 4 percentage points
 higher on average than they were in 1976. The high
 level of real interest rates is related, in part, to large
 government budget deficits. If Big Six governments
 attempt to reduce budget deficits, real interest
 rates might fall but in the short run these countries
 probably would suffer lower output and employ-
 Interest Rate Trends
 Nominal interest rates in the Big Six have been
 declining for more than two years, although the
 trend in West Germany and Canada appears to
 have flattened out over the past few quarters.
 Despite the general downward movement, nominal
 interest rates remain high by historical standards-
 at least 1 percentage point higher than the 1965-83
 average
 Real interest rates-the more important determi-
 nant of investment-are also higher than usual in
 the Big Six. In all of the major countries these rates
 are several percentage points higher than the aver-
 age since 1965. (They are even higher relative to the
 rates that existed at the start of the 1976 cyclical
 upturn in Western Europe.
 ? West German real interest rates are presently
 about 3 percentage points higher than when the
 economy began to recover from the 1974/75
 recession. Although the real rate is much less
 than it was two years ago, it is still high relative
 to the average rate over the 1965-83 period.
 ? French real interest rates were above 5 percent in
 early 1983, but by the fourth quarter had
 dropped down to 4 percent. This rate is well
 above the - 1.3 percent recorded in the first
 quarter of 1976-the beginning of France's mid-
 1970s recovery. The current rate is about twice
 the average rate experienced in the 1965-83
 period.
 ? The British real interest rate was nearly 6 percent
 in early 1983 but has since dropped to 4.4
 percent. This is still more than 4 points higher
 than at the beginning of the UK recovery in the
 third, quarter of 1976. The UK rate is down
 substantially from the 7.1-percent peak (fourth-
 quarter 1981), but it is roughly 2 to 3 percentage
 points higher than the 1965-83 average.
 ? Italian real interest rates are currently 4.5 per-
 cent, far higher than the 1965-83 average and 5.5
 percentage points higher than the rate existing in
 the beginning quarter of the 1976 recovery.
 ? Japanese real interest rates at present are the
 highest among the Big Six, but the 4-percentage-
 point spread between the current rate and the
 1976 rate is the second lowest in the group. The
 present rate is far above the 1965-83 average.

 Measuring Real Interest Rates
 The real interest rate on a loan is usually defined
 as the nominal interest rate minus the expected
 rate of inflation over the period of the loan.
 Unfortunately, price expectations are not measured
 directly and must be inferred from other data-
 usually the actual inflation rate experienced in the
 recent past. There is no general agreement on how
 to do this, however, and the results can vary.
 depending on the procedure used and on the price
 ? Measure 3: Expected changes in the inflation rate
 are assumed to be reflected in the difference be-
 tween the nominal levels of short- and long-term
 interest rates. Theory suggests that other factors-
 such as a risk premium-also affect the difference
 between these two rates, but these other factors are
 assumed to equal a constant 1-percentage-point
 differential. The real interest rate is calculated by
 subtracting the current inflation rate, expected
 changes in the inflation rate, and a constant 1
 percentage point from the nominal long-term inter-
 For this study we assumed that the.GDP deflator
 is the best index of inflation. We then considered
 three different measures of price expectations and
 thus developed three different measures of real
 interest rates:
 ? Measure 1: The expected inflation rate is as-
 sumed to equal the actual inflation rate over the
 last year. This is the easiest measure to use, but
 its concept of price expectations is naive. It
 currently tends to give higher estimates of the
 real rate than the other measures.
 Although we believe Measure 3 best identifies the
 perceived level of real interest rates-and have used
 it throughout our analysis-we found that all three
 measures led to similar conclusions:
 ? Real interest rates are now considerably higher
 than at the beginning of the 1976 recovery.
 ? Real interest rates are much higher than the aver-
 age rate during the 1965-83 period.
 ? Measure 2: The expected inflation rate is as-
 sumed to equal the average inflation rate over
 the last four years.
 ? Canadian real interest rates of almost 6 percent
 are down sharply from their peak but remain far
 above either the near-zero rate of 1976 or the
 long-run average.

 Egypt's Military: Impact of
 Economic Difficulties
 Egypt's tight foreign financial situation has led to a
 guns-versus-butter debate within the Cabinet, and
 President Mubarak already has requested bilateral
 debt relief on military loans from the United
 States. Foreign payments difficulties and a debt
 crisis could threaten Egypt's longer term military
 modernization program and restrict benefits for
 armed forces personnel. Should Egypt ultimately
 be forced to take austerity measures-perhaps un-
 der IMF auspices and as part of a debt reschedul-
 ing exercise-the government would risk urban
 unrest that might test the military's loyalty to
 Mubarak. Cairo is trying to avoid these difficulties
 by deferring hard decisions, but its options are
 becoming increasingly limited.
 The Military's Role
 The Egyptian military remains the most important
 political force in Egypt. Its direct, involvement in
 decisionmaking, however, has declined since the
 late 1960s, when military officers constituted over
 half the Cabinet. Now the officer corps exerts
 influence mainly as a powerful silent partner whose
 opinion limits the extent to which any President can
 redirect Egyptian policy. Mubarak-an Air Force
 officer before becoming Sadat's Vice President-
 seems inclined to follow the policies that have the
 broadest support within the military: a nonradical
 approach to domestic problems, a generally pro-
 Western albeit still nonaligned foreign policy, and
 adherence to the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.
 Peace with Israel and an emphasis on economic
 development have altered the status and objectives
 of the armed forces. We believe the military's
 present goals include:
 ? Replacing worn-out and obsolete Soviet equip-
 ment with new Western weapons.
 I
 Importance of the Military
 ? The military is the ultimate guarantor ofpoliti-
 cal order and the source of most of the country's
 top leadership. The military also backs up the
 police and Ministry of lnteriorforces in the event
 of serious domestic unrest.
 ? By Middle Eastern standards, the Egyptian offi-
 cer corps is a stable and professional force. Its
 middle-class composition contributes to this sta-
 bility by imparting a degree of uniformity to its
 social, economic, and political goals.          25X1
 ? The military is the most disciplined institution in
 E   t and has a strong sense of corporate identi-
 ty.                                                                                                               25X1
 ? Restructuring the armed forces into smaller,
 more mobile units.
 Restoring the prestige enjoyed by the armed
 forces following the 1973 war. Many Egyptians
 now question the need for a large army in the
 absence of a direct military threat from Israel.
 ? Regaining economic and social status for military
 personnel. Under Sadat's "Open Door" economic
 policies, goods available for top military officers
 and only a few others in society-good housing,
 cars, and television sets-are now more widely
 available.

 subsidies. Nonetheless, the government's budgetary

 the military appears to have considerable freedom
 to set its own spending levels.
 a select group of Cabinet mem-
 bers each year "examines" the military budget; by
 implication, these ministers have little power to
 influence military spending directly.
 Foreign Military Purchases. The Egyptian armed
 forces have depended on foreign credits or grants to
 finance major arms purchases. In the 1960s and
 early 1970s, the USSR provided about $4 billion in
 low-interest loans for weapons purchases. As rela-
 tions with the Soviets deteriorated, Egypt began to
 receive assistance from oil-rich Arab states to fund
 procurement of weapons from Western countries.
 Starting in 1979, the United States provided long-
 term credits or grants under the FMS program.
 Most purchases from other Western countries,
 particularly France, appear to be financed by
 medium-term credits.
 Defense Industries and Sales. Military factories
 produce small arms, ammunition, spare parts, vehi-
 cles, and other equipment for the Egyptian armed
 forces and for export. The factories receive operat-
 ing subsidies from the government. Cairo is pursu-
 ing coproduction arrangements with foreign firms
 to produce fighter aircraft and tanks, but the lack
 of funding is a major problem.
 Egypt exports both armaments produced in its
 factories and rehabilitated Soviet equipment from

 billion, and perhaps considerably more, in arma-
 ments since early 1981, primarily to Iraq. These
 sales are funded by Saudi and other Arab aid to
 Baghdad. Egyptian officials refuse to discuss the
 financing of sales, although a senior Central Bank
 official implied to a US Embassy officer last year
 that the Central Bank does not receive the pro-          25X1

 share of these earnings for non-US weapons pur-
 chases and retains most of the rest, turning funds
 over to the Central Bank only when there is
 insufficient foreign exchange to service the military    25X1
 Civilian Projects. Since the mid-1970s, the Egyp-
 tian military has become involved in a wide range
 of economic endeavors in an effort to increase its
 self-sufficiency and to justify its continued large
 size during peacetime. In 1979 the Ministry of
 Defense created the National Service Projects Or-
 ganization (NASPO) to organize, administer, and
 implement these civilian projects. Official Egyptian
 reports and press accounts claim, for example, that
 NASPO has done significant work on sewer lines
 and the telephone system. The military reportedly
 now supplies 65 percent of its own food, prints
 school textbooks, treats civilians at.military hospi-
 tals, operates a pharmaceutical factory, and is
 building apartments for military personnel. Presi-
 dent Mubarak's frequent visits to projects have
 assured wide publicity.
 Although military conscripts and noncareer officers
 appreciate the opportunities to gain skills and earn.
 pay bonuses, senior officers believe that military
 participation in agriculture and construction less-

 morale of professional soldiers, and diverts atten-
 tion from the primary mission of defense. These
 activities probably will retain popular support, how-
 ever, as long as they remain free of corruption, are
 perceived as benefiting the public, and continue to
 be viewed as more efficient than the public sector.

 The government has tried to use enhanced perqui-
 sites to maintain military morale in the face of
 reduced peacetime promotion prospects, the scarci-
 ty of housing, the failure of pay to keep pace with
 inflation, and the decline in the economic status of
 the military relative to other Egyptians. These
 perquisites include:
 ? New apartments for officers on favorable finan-
 cial terms.
 ? A subsidized vehicle purchase program offering
 officers new Mazdas or Fiats with no downpay-
 ment, no import taxes, and 1-percent interest on
 loans.
 ? Half fare on commercial transportation, and a
 proposed shuttle bus system to provide military
 personnel free transportation throughout Cairo.
 Despite these benefits, we believe most officers and
 enlisted men consider themselves undercompensat-
 ed in comparison with their civilian colleagues.
 According to US Embassy reporting, the armed
 forces have had difficulty recruiting and retaining
 highly, skilled personnel because much more money
 can be made in the private sector or abroad. Many
 servicemen have great difficulty supporting their
 families on military pay alone.
 80 percent of
 Army officers with the rank of major or above
 pursue some form of outside commercial activity.
 Many enlisted men hold second jobs despite formal
 prohibitions against this practice, and absenteeism

 Economic Prospects
 Egypt's foreign finances are tight. Official nongold
 reserves of about $800 million would cover. barely
 one month of imports, but Cairo so far has been
 able to avoid debt rescheduling and recourse to the
 IMF. The government has limited imports, adjust-
 ed exchange rates to attract more worker remit-
 tances, and increased both oil production and the
 volume of oil exports to offset the impact of lower
 prices. Moreover, Egypt has benefited from lower
 import prices, particularly for food, and from US
 economic and military aid. We project Egypt's
 current account deficit in 1984 will be about $2.5

 billion-close to the level of the past two years.
 With limited foreign exchange reserves and a debt
 service ratio already exceeding 30 percent of for-
 eign earnings, Cairo will have difficulty putting off
 an economic adjustment program much longer.
 Imports, particularly of food, will continue to rise,
 while slower growth is expected in earnings from
 remittances, the Suez Canal, and tourism. An
 adjustment program would entail reductions in
 government spending and probable hikes in prices
 of subsidized energy and food. The Mubarak gov-
 ernment fears-with good reason-that these steps
 would produce negative political repercussions; ,
 memories remain fresh of the 1977 riots in Cairo
 sparked by bread price hikes.
 An end to the Iran-Iraq war probably would hurt
 Cairo's immediate economic interests. Cairo could
 lose profitable arms sales to Iraq. Moreover, peace
 between Iran and Iraq would enable these countries
 to boost oil exports, further depressing world oil
 prices. Conversely, Egypt would benefit from
 sharply higher oil prices should the fighting s read
 and reduce oil exports from the Persian Gulf.
 Military assistance from the United States has
 enabled Egypt to modernize its armed forces with-
 out placing an immediate foreign payments burden
 on the economy. In addition, the amount and
 quality of US military equipment provided are seen
 by Egyptians as a measure of the regime's wisdom
 in shifting from reliance on the Soviets to the West.
 Since US FY 1979, the United States has provided
 nearly $4.6 billion in FMS credits and slightly
 more than $1 billion in grants for military pur-
 chases. For US FY 1985, the administration has
 proposed a military aid program of $1.175 billion,
 all of it in grants.
 The US assistance program has supplied a wide
 range of sophisticated weapons. US equipment

 and deliveries of US weapons extend through the
 end of the decade and will require continued high
 levels of US FMS financing or funds from some
 other source.
 The FMS loans, however, are generating a new set
 of problems. Since March 1983, Egypt has repeat-
 edly been in arrears on its interest payments,
 although never by more than 60 days. Although
 there is a 10-year grace period on principal repay-
 ment on these 30-year loans, interest due has risen
 to about $380 million in Egypt's current fiscal year.
 Although this only accounts for one-tenth of the
 total debt servicing burden, the FMS payments
 have become the focus of Egyptian debt relief
 efforts and a major issue in US-Egyptian relations.
 During Mubarak's Washington visit in February,
 he requested a moratorium on FMS payments or
 rescheduling at lower interest rates. Although he
 did not repeat earlier threats to stop FMS pay-
 ments in July, he argued that Egypt cannot afford
 to repay these loans and still pursue an ambitious
 economic development program.

 Similar requests for military debt relief have been
 made of China I which reportedly has resched-
 uled-and France-which has not. In addition,
 Egypt has not been servicing its roughly $4.0 billion

 ally declared a moratorium in September 1977.
 Some paymentsI on obligations to Islamic countries
 have been frozen since formal ties were severed

 Domestic Implications
 We believe economic problems will make it increas-
 ingly difficult for Cairo to simultaneously modern-
 ize the military; maintain benefits for military
 personnel, pursue an ambitious economic develop-
 ment plan, and retain generous consumer subsidies.
 There is already an intense debate on military
 versus economic priorities within the Cabinet be-
 tween Prime Minister Muhi al-Din and Defense
 Minister Abu Ghazala. Mubarak's sympathies
 probably lie with the military, but we believe he
 will expect the military to accept spending cutbacks
 more readily than urban consumers. Mubarak
 tends to rely on! Muhi al-Din on economic issues,
 and the Prime Minister's. opposition to rapid and
 extensive economic reforms reinforces the natural
 caution of Mubarak, who has no chief economic

 involved. Moreover, civilian economic austerity

 Nigeria: Running Short of Time

 Creditors remain reluctant to implement any re-

 renewed negotiations with the Fund for a $2.4
 billion Extended Fund Facility, but Lagos's unwill-
 ingness to devalue remains the major stumbling-

 members to win Ian increase in its official oil
 production quota, it continues to exceed its 1.3

 We believe the "IMF question" has become a

 is little support for an IMF agreement within
 Nigeria, and the government has pledged itself not

 sovereignty or independence. Although the govern-

 To boost exports, the Buhari government is seeking
 an official increase in its OPEC oil production
 quota of as much as 500,000 b/d. Production is
 already averaging about 1.6 million b/d-300,000
 b/d above Nigeria's current OPEC ceiling. Lagos
 is lobbying for Saudi and Libyan support for a
 higher quota, even though a decision cannot be
 made officially until the next OPEC ministerial
 meeting in July. In the meantime, OPEC members
 have been turning a blind eye to Nigeria's overpro-
 duction. Although Lagos has announced it will cut
 production back during the second quarter to keep
 within its quota, we believe the Buhari government
 may be trying to convince the Saudis to come
 through with the loan or to give more forceful
 support for Nigeria's production quota increase.
 Even if Lagos is granted an increase in its OPEC
 production quota and is able to sustain increased
 output, an IMF agreement and debt reschedulings
 still will be essential to begin turning the economy
 around. In addition to $5-8 billion in short-term
 arrears, debt service on Nigeria's medium- and
 long-term obligations will exceed $4 billion this
 year. Barring debt relief and extreme import cuts,
 Nigeria's financial gap could top $8 billion in 1984.
 On the other hand, should Lagos reach agreement
 with the IMF and accomplish both reschedulings,
 the financial gap would be reduced to under $1
 billion, an amount we believe might be covered by
 additional borrowings abroad.
 Although senior officers now appear to better
 understand the gravity of Nigeria's international
 financial difficulties and the limited options open to
 them, we believe they are more concerned with

 US Embassy reports that food is available in most

 total stock. Egg and chicken production are down

 Crop losses will hurt the country's processing in-
 dustries. For example, about 80 percent of cotton
 for the textile industry-Nigeria's largest private
 employer-will have to be imported this year. Most
 import-dependent industries are operating at 25 to
 30 percent of capacity, and many companies have
 had to lay off between one-fourth and one-half of
 their workers. More businesses will have to close
 this year due to the lack of import credits.
 Government Moves
 The Buhari government's indecisiveness in the face
 of worsening economic conditions is rapidly tar-
 nishing its image at home as well as abroad. Efforts
 to force market prices down and ensure a steady
 supply of food have had only marginal and tem o
 rary effects, while alienating powerful traders.7
 Some stopgap go ernment actions taken to cut
 costs and stretch limited foreign exchange earnings
 have only made domestic problems worse. Buhari
 has ordered that deficit spending cease at both
 federal and state levels, forcing governments to lay
 off more civil servants and contractors. Many state
 employees have faced delays of several months in
 salary payments. Local grumbling has increased as
 state military governors have been forced to reduce
 tolerance for harsh austerity measures.
 Buhari also has stated his intention to limit imports
 to about $4.6 billion this year-half of last year's
 already drastically reduced level. We doubt Nige-
 ria will be able to hold anywhere close to this
 figure. According to the US Embassy, about $2.3
 billion is needed just to pay for food and agricultur-
 al raw materials to keep people adequately fed and
 industries running. Nigeria needs another $9-10    25X1
 billion to import industrial raw materials to reo en
 factories and to provide. greater employment.
 Buhari recognizes that worsening domestic eco-
 nomic conditions-especially growing unemploy-
 ment, consumer goods shortages, and rising
 prices-could spark domestic unrest and encourage
 coup plotting. Lacking ready solutions, the govern-
 ment has tried to shift attention from economic
 concerns to the financial misdeeds of some 475
 former civilian officials now under arrest. Even this
 tactic has backfired, according to the US Embassy,
 'by raising questions about the financial dealings of
 current leaders-including Buhari-when they
 served in the previous military government. The
 Nigerian press has contributed to a growing xeno-
 phobia by sensationalist reporting of supposedly
 illegal economic activities by foreign companies
 operating in Nigeria. More recently, the govern-
 ment also has raised the specter of an invasion
 financed by exiled followers of former President
 Shagari.

 Although the exact level of support for the regime

 unity displayed to date is likely to fray as the
 government becomes desperate in its search for
 economic solutions. Intensifying criticism of the

 China: Energy and Economic Growth
 To address the problem of energy shortages that
 have increasingly become an obstacle to China's
 economic growth, Beijing is seeking to double by
 the year 2000 both energy output and the efficiency
 of energy use, hoping to quadruple GNP by that
 date without the need for importing energy. Beij-
 ing's strategy evolved in the late 1970s when it
 became apparent that Soviet-style growth driven by
 heavy industry-without the Soviet Union's huge
 energy resources-could prove disastrous.
 Since 1978 Beijing has dealt with its energy prob-
 lems on three fronts:  ,
 It has attacked the country's wasteful energy
 consumption habits by restructuring industry,
 closing inefficient plants, and placing quotas on
 energy use. Political considerations and a lack of
 flexibility in its price system have prevented
 China from raising energy prices sharply, the
 single most effective measure taken by other
 countries to curb energy consumption. Neverthe-
 less, the program has been successful; energy
 consumption increased by only 2 percent per year
 between 1978 and 1982, while industrial growth
 averaged slightly more than 7 percent annually.
 Higher priority, at least in theory, is now being
 given to energy exploration and development, but
 Beijing apparently has not been satisfied with
 results. There have been few indications that the
 long-term deeline.in proven oil reserves has been
 stemmed, and capital-intensive hydroelectric and
 nuclear projects have been slow to move out of
 the planning phase.
 Of the most interest to the United States and
 other foreign countries, Beijing has opened im-
 portant segments of its once highly protected
 energy industries to Western and Japanese in-
 vestment. In a remarkable turnaround, the Petro-
 leum, Coal, and Electric Power Ministries, once
 bastions of Mao Zedong's ideology of self-reli-
 ance, have become leading proponents of Western
 investment in China. Projects already under way
 will, in our opinion, foster long-term commercial
 links between China and the non-Communist
 world. Although China's goals imply 7-percent
 annual growth rates for the economy, we. believe 25X1
 a 4- to-5 percent annual growth rate is more
 likely.
 China's Energy Supply
 China produced about 700 million metric tons of
 coal equivalent commercial energy in 1983, up 5
 percent from 1982. Energy output in the past five
 years, however, has increased at an average annual
 rate of only 2 percent, in marked contrast to the 6-
 percent annual growth registered in the preceding
 two decades. The steady erosion of coal's share of
 energy supply that occurred during 1950-78, how-
 ever, has been reversed. Coal's share of energy
 output rose from 70 percent in 1978 to 71 percent
 in 1983. Petroleum, with output flat for the past six
 years, now provides 22 percent of national energy
 supply, down about 2 percentage points since 1978.
 Hydropower has gained steadily to provide about 5
 percent of the country's energy, while natural gas
 has declined to only about 2 percent. Although
 China ranks third in world energy output, Chinese
 per capita energy production ranks in the bottom
 one-third worldwide.
 China's Sixth Five-Year Plan (1981-85) and less
 definite but widely quoted long-range plans indi-
 cate that energy output will continue to grow slowly
 through the end of the century. Our energy projec-
 tions,
 fall slightly short of Beijing's general
 guidelines for doubling the availability of energy by

 percent a year through the rest of the.century.
 Achievement of these energy production targets
 will require a sharp boost in investment. Energy
 investment now accounts for about 45 percent of
 industrial investment, and Beijing's efforts to con-
 trol its overall investment outlays have adversely
 affected the energy sector. Beijing reduced state
 investment in energy development from 11.4 billion
 yuan-roughly $6 billion-in 1978 to only 9.0
 billion yuan in 1981 and 10.2 billion yuan in 1982.
 Data for 1983, however, indicate a sharp rebound.
 Energy investment probably reached close to 13.6
 billion yuan for the year, up about 35 percent from
 1982. The largest increases went to the electric
 power industry.

 Demand for Energy
 China has slowed the rate of increase in energy
 consumption in the last five years, despite fairly
 rapid economic growth. Energy consumption in-
 creased at an annual rate of 2.0 percent from 1978
 through 1982 while national income increased at a
 6.2-percent rate. This energy elasticity of national
 income of 0.32 is in sharp contrast to an elasticity
 of 1.47 for the Chinese economy from 1965 to
 1978.
 Most observers, inside China and in the West,
 doubt this low elasticity can be maintained. Much

 was the result of economic restructuring caused by
 rapid growth in energy-efficient light industry and
 agriculture and very slow growth in energy-inten-
 sive heavy industry. Beijing officially attributes
 two-thirds of the energy savings to these structural
 changes and only one-third to conservation.
 Our study of Chinese energy demand-based on
 analysis of the key energy-consuming industries-
 suggests that th1e Chinese economy will have an
 overall energy elasticity of between 0.65 and 0.70
 for the remainder of the 1980s and the 1990s-that
 is to say that energy consumption will increase
 between 65 andl 70 percent as fast as national
 income. This is smaller than what is expected for
 most major countries and much smaller than Chi-
 na's historical record. We are optimistic, however,
 only because we believe the Chinese Government
 will continue to exert great control over the use of
 energy-particularly oil and electricity.
 We expect the use of oil to increase only 45 percent
 as fast as national income in the 1980s but then rise
 to a rate of 80 percent as fast in the 1990s as
 opportunities for switching to coal are reduced.
 This still will allow substantial growth in the

 balances that will force Beijing to make tough
 decisions in allocating energy supplies. These pro-
 jections suggest there will be little room for energy
 exports-currently more than 20 percent of Chi-

 Bank, however, we do not believe China will have
 to import oil unless the offshore exploration pro-
 gram brings on line substantially less than the 50
 million tons of annual capacity (1 million b/d)
 expected by major oil companies. In the near term,
 a shortage of electric power appears to be the most
 likely constraint on economic growth.
 Economic growth faster than 5 percent would, we
 believe, quickly cause serious energy shortages
 unless China was prepared to import substantial
 volumes of energy. If our estimates of coal, oil, and
 electric power demand prove accurate, the 7-per-
 cent annual rate of economic growth envisioned by
 Beijing would require major adjustments:
 ? The elimination of oil exports even to the point of
 repurchasing-in effect importing-the offshore
 oil that the Western oil companies expect to take
 out as their profit share.
 ? Resolving a 100-million-ton shortfall in annual
 coal supplies by 1990.
 ? Coping with a further 15- to 20-percent shortfall
 in electricity supplies.
 By the same token, long-term annual economic
 growth of only 3 or 4 percent would probably not
 run into an energy constraint. Energy exports could
 be kept at current levels and perhaps even in-
 creased.

 we agree with Chinese estimates that electricity

 faster, than national income.

 investment in large, state-owned, mining

 not reflect market realities. To preserve price
 stability, Beijing has held energy prices relatively
 constant since the 1950s despite clear changes in

 ? China's ability to increase oil exports during
 1978-82 is remarkable, given the slow growth in
 oil output. Crude oil and petroleum products now
 contribute over 20 percent of export earnings and
 are a major factor behind the country's strong
 financial position. Our analysis suggests, howev-
 er-and this judgment is increasingly reflected in
 Chinese energy journals-that China may have
 to phase out oil exports by 1990. This would allow
 domestic consumption to rise by the 2-percent
 annual rate that we calculate will be necessary
 for a 5-percent rate of economic growth.
 ? An issue that we believe will come to the fore-

 the grave shortage of rural energy supplies.
 Implications for the United States
 China's need for new technology, both to explore
 and develop new energy resources and to improve
 efficiency, is one of the most important motivations
 for Beijing to strengthen commercial links with the
 Western world China, we believe, sees the United
 States as the best source for much of this technol-
 ogy and makes! access to it a pivotal consideration
 in its official dealings with the United States. This
 technology cant form a relatively stable underpin-
 ning for China's opening to the United States.
 Beijing did not, for instance, allow the mid-1983
 political and economic controversies with the Unit-
 ed States to hamper the offshore oil contract
 negotiations occurring during the same period.
 There are a number of areas in which energy
 technology is already forging important commer-
 cial links between the two countries:
 ? Offshore oil, where a dozen US firms are taking
 the lead in exploring China's promising South
 China Sea continental shelf. If successful, this
 exploration will lead to long-term-up to 35
 years-commitments by the firms to work in
 China.
 ? Onshore oil, where China. is purchasing US tech-
 nology to maintain output at mature fields.
 ? Technology for the generation and transmission
 of electric power, where US firms are becoming
 involved in upgrading China's obsolete
 equipment.
 The coal industry is also creating a demand for
 US production equipment.
 development
 Two areas of potential cooperation-contingent
 upon solving difficult investment and political
 problems-are hydroelectric and nuclear power
 In most of these areas China believes the United
 States holds the most desirable technology. US
 firms, however, usually meet fierce competition
 from West European and Japanese firms. China,
 moreover, has proven adept at playing competitors
 against each other. This competition will probably
 become more intense, particularly over the financ-
 ing of energy projects, an area in which the United
 States appears at considerable disadvantage.
 Despite prospects for an advantageous commercial
 relationship for the United States, China's energy
 issue could create problems as well. A willingness
 to experiment. with more capitalistic, decentralized
 economic policies and a general openness to foreign
 trade and investment are key features of the gov-
 ernment's modernization strategy.
