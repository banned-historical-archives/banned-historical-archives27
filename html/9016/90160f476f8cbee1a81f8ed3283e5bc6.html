 VIETNAM WEEKLY  REVIEW
 INTRODUCTION
 Vietnamese communist attention to the 50th session of the Paris talks on
 15 January is again confined to accounts of the session which gloss over
 most of the substance of the allied speeches and focus on the PRG and
 DRV --I.elegates' continuing attacks on the Vietnamization policy and
 allied "crimes,"  Having ignored Ambassador Habib's 8 January renewal
 of the proposal for restricted sessions, VNA's report of his 15 January
 remarks says cryptically that he "repeated" the "old proposal" for
 restricted sessions as well as discussing the prisoner-of-war problem.
 There is no comment pegged to the current Paris sessions,* but a two-
 installment Liberation Radio commentary, broadcast on 17 and 18 January,
 assesses the communists' diplomatic struggle, which it says will not
 replace the "military and political struggles."  Routinely claiming that
 President Nixon has continued "Johnson's aggressive line," the commentary
 says that during 50 Paris sessions the United States' argument has been
 that it has assisted its ally in "struggling against North Vietnam
 aggressors."  The first anniversary of the Nixon Administration also
 provides the peg for Hanoi and Front commentators to charge "a lack of
 good will" toward the Paris talks.
 A spate of current comment stresses the need to step up the political
 struggle in coordination with the military struggle in order to combat
 pacification and the Vietnamiza.ion policy.  A QUAN DOI NHAN DAN article,
 broadcast by Hanoi radio on the 19th, discusses how military action can
 aid the people to rise up and build revolutionary administrations and
 how these "liberated" areas then provide a rear base for the military
 forces.  An editorial in the Front organ GIAI PRONG (Liberation), broad-
 cast by Liberation Radio on 15 January, says it is necessary to "urgently
 step up the guerrilla war into a new high tide with a mass character
 and in close cooperation with political and proselyting activities."
 Stepping up the "political offensive and proselyting work" during Tet is
 dealt with in a 4 January circular put out by the PRG Information and
 Culture Ministry and the NFLSV, broadcast by Liberation Radio on the
 15th.  On the same day, the radio broadcasts a commentary linked to
 the 5 January PRG announcement of a Tet cease-fire which urges people to
 use the time to persuade people to "leave the enemy for the national
 ranks."
 The last monitored comment to discuss a specific Paris session in
 substance was a Liberation Radio commentary on 29 November 1969.

 21 JANUARY 1970
 Attention to current military activity_ remainc confined to scattered
 battle reports with stress on the northern provinces.     At the same
 time, there is continued attention to alleged communist military
 victories during 1969.
 Moscow continues to criticize the U.S. VIetnamization program and to
 denigrate the sincerity of the U.S. intention to withdraw troops.
 On the 19th Moscow radio broadcasts Christmas messages from U.S.
 prisoners in the DRV.  The messages had been previously broadcast by
 Hanoi, and Moscow explains that Hanoi had loaned it the recordings.
 Attention to the situation in the North includes a DRV Foreign Minis-try
 spokesman's protest which charges the United States with using B-52's
 against the demilitarized zone.  On 20 January, VNA reports the
 release of a DRV War Crimes Commission statement of the 17th which
 rounds up alleged crimes against the Vietnamese people since President
 Nixon's inauguration.
 A flurry of propaganda anticipating the celebration of the Vietnam
 Workers Party's 40th anniversary on 3 February includes a Secretariat
 circular, released on the 18th, which sets out rules for commemorating
 the anniversary; party slogans hailing the anniversary are also
 released on the 18th.  A 13 January QUAN DOI NHAN DAN editorial, while
 lauding party achievements in the past 40 years, goes to unusual lengths
 to stress the importance of determination and a "staunch spirit" among
 party members in the army and seems to reflect concern over their
 attitude.
 DRV Government meetings are reported by VNA, which mentions a 14 January
 National Assembly Standing Committee meeting under Chairman `rruong
 Chinh and a "recent" Council of Ministers meeting held "to discuss and
 adopt the draft state budget for 1970."
 The 20th anniversary of CPR recognition of the DRV is marked by a
 NHAN DAN editorial, summarized by VNA on the 1 th, and a 20 January
 reception held by the Chinese ambassador in Hanoi, reported by NCNA.
 Nguyen Duy Trinh and the ambassador spoke at the reception.

 PARIS SESSION ON 15 JANUARY:  "CRIMES," VIETNAMIZATION
 ALLIED       VNA says that at the 15 January Paris session the U.S. and
 SPEECHES      GVN delegates "took turns in boasting about goodwill" and
 charged the DRV and PRG with blocking prr-gress in the talks.
 As for GVN Ambassador Phong's presentation, VNA says simply that he
 "rehashed threadbare allegations."  While the VNA account of the 49t:1
 session ^n the 8th had totally ignored Ambassador Habib's proposal for
 restricte,_ sessions, the VNA account of the U.S. delegate's statement
 on the 15th says Habib "repeated the old proposal for restricted
 sessions and the prisoners-of-war problem which had been laid bare and
 rejected" by the DRV and PRG delegations.
 PRG, DRV ON       Deputy PRG delegation head Dinh Ba Thi, again
 U.S. "CRIMES"     substituting for the reportedly still ailing Mme. Nguyen
 Thi Binh, devoted a considerable portion of his state-
 ment to denouncing alleged U.S. crimes in the South since President Nixon's
 inauguration.  Thi claimed that "innumerable crimes"* were committed in
 the implementation of Vietnamization, particularly during the course of
 the Phoenix campaign and the accelerated pacification campaign.
 The VNA accountF  )mite much of Thi's detailing of specific crimes.  It
 also omits Thi's  Lef reference to President Nixon's contention that
 a precipitate U.S  withdrawal would result in a "massacre" by the
 communists.  But VIA reports Ha Van Lau's remark to this effect and his
 comment that the President Is using this contention as "a pretext" to
 oppose a "correct political solution to the war."  VNA omits Ha Van Lau's
 specific acknowledgment of allied charges of PLAF slaughters in Hue
 during the 1968 met offensive, noting only that he said the United States
 is trying to misicad public opinion by claiming that the "PLAF had
 committed mass slaughters."
 VIETNAMIZATION     In noting that Lau again denounced the Vietnamization
 plan, VNA reports his remarks that the President's
 three criteria for troop withdrawal--which are not spelled out this
 time--can "never be met" and that Vietnamization is aimed at "indefinitely"
 prolonging U.S. military occupation of South Vietnam by hundreds of
 Thi's current documentation of U.S. 'crimes" seems to be based on some
 of the statistics in the DRV War Crimes Commission statement which VNA
 on 20 January says was issued on the 17th, two days after Thi's statement.
 There is no propaganda acknowledgment that in Paris, also on the 15th,
 the communists released the names of the alleged victims of the 1968
 Son My "massacre" which were recently transmitted by Front and DRV media.

 -4-
 thousands of troops.  VNA does not report any of Lau's remarks on the
 President's three troop withdrawal announcements--at Midway in June,
 on 16 September, and on 15 December.  VNA does report that Lau
 characterized as a "deceitful trick" President Nixon's "rash challenge"
 at his 19 June press conference when he said he hoped to beat former
 Secretary Clifford's proposed timetable to withdraw 100,000 combat
 forces by the end of"1969.
 The VNA account notes Dinh Ba Thi's assertions that the United States
 is pressuring the Saigon government to "pressgang frantically" in
 acquiring more troops to replace American forces.  But the account
 does not include Thi's comment that the U.S. side seems to view the
 rise in South Vietnamese casualties as compared with American losses
 as a sign of "progress" in Vietnamization.  Thi also made the routine
 charge that the United States is making the GVN become "more fascist"
 in ruthlessly repressing and terrorizing advocates of peace and those
 unwilling to surrender to the Americans.  In this regard, VNA notes
 his reference to President Thieu's 9 January reported statements on
 Vietnamization.  Thi claimed that Thieu "begged" the United States not
 to abandon South Vietnam and to remain there for many more years.
 SELF-DETERMINATION     In its account of Lau's remarks on the political
 issues involved in settlement, VNA notes his
 general denunciation of the United States for "pretending" to respect
 the South Vietnamese people's right to self-determination and to
 agree to the holding of general elections there.  Lau ignored the fact
 that President Thieu's 11 July proposal provided for organization of
 elections by a mixed commission which would include Front representatives.
 Instead he said that "in reality" it was the Liberation Front which had
 "first" put forward the proposal for "organizing" general elections,
 as manifested in the Front's December 1960 founding program, developed
 in its 1967 political program, and further advanced in the NFLSV 10-point
 solution tabled at Paris on 8 May 1969.  VNA does not carry this
 passage?  But it does report Lau's comment that the "important question"
 which bears a "decisive character" is who will organize the elections;
 Lau said it was with this concern in mind that NFLSV-PRG has advocated
 the establishment of a provisional coalition government to organize them.
 VNA reports the concluding remarks made by Thi and Lau calling on the
 United States to end its "aggressive war" and settle the South Vietnam
 problem on the basis of the NFLSV 10-point solution.  Dinh Ba Thi's
 repetition of the proposal that the United Stat(:s agree to withdraw in
 six months is noted by VNA, as is his remark that if the United States
 accepts the principle of troop withdrawal and the formation of a
 provisional coalition government, as stipulated in the Front's 10-point
 solution, then "all concrete problems will be discussed and settled
 satisfactorily."

 CM45 ' ON DIPLOMATIC STRUGGLE, NIXON'S FIRST YEAR
 FRONT RADIO     The two-installment commentary broadcast by Liberation
 COMMENTARY      Radio on 17 and 18 January assesses the communists'
 diplomatic effort and U.S. policy and negotiating
 strategy.  The commentator says flatly that "we do not expect to replace
 the military and political struggle with the diplomatic struggle"Wand
 that there.-are "no illusions" about U.S.'goodwill for peace, but that .
 nonetheless the diplomatic struggle constitutes a "resolute offensive"
 against the enemy.  While there is no explicit definition of "diplomatic
 struggle," the implication is that it involves influencing American
 and world opinion and heightening the role and prestige of the PRG
 as well as engaging in talks.
 The commentator denounces the U.S. "contention" that North Vietnam is
 invading the South and its "illogical" demand for mutual troop withdrawal
 and recognition of the Saigon "puppet administration" as a constitutional
 and legal authority.  He sees ?T.S. policy as evolving from the argumenta-
 tion in Kissinger's January 1969 FOREIGN AFFAIRS article,* but he says
 that using withdrawal as a "trump card" in negotiations will not work.
 The commentator routinely ridicules the U.S. policy of upholding the GVN
 as a legal and constitutional authority and of attempting to force the
 Front to negotiate with it.  Somewhat illogically, he goes on to say
 that the United States has been "compelled to recognize" the PRG and
 NFLSV and sit in on the negotiations with the PRG despite past American
 persistence in denying the Front's role.  He presses routinely for the
 NFLSV 10-point solution, particularly the "very correct proposal" for
 establishment of a provisional coalition government that would hold free
 general elections.  He contrasts this with the Saigon administration's
 "shrewd maneuver" whereby it would organize the elections "under the
 supervision of some advisory committee."

 political struggles and in declaring that there is "no illusion regarding
 peace and peace talks."

 example, that he called it a "two-party conference" and appointed as
 chief negotiator Ambassador Lodge, "a hawk closely related to the
 Thieu-Ky puppet administration." The paper repeats standard denunciations
 of U.S. statements and positions, including the President's 14 May
 speech and the Vietnamization policy.  The LPA commentary, also on the
 20th, presents a similar assessment of the Administration and says that
 1970 "does not augur well" for the President.  It predicts that unless
 he changes his policy, "defeat will visit him both at Capitol Hill and
 at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue."
 VICE PRESIDENT AGNEW'S ASIAN YOUR
 HANOI      Continuing propaganda on Vice President Agnew's Asian tour
 includes a NHAN DAN commentary by Le Binh on the 17th, broad-
 cast by Hanoi that day,  It lists the countries visited and the demonstra-
 tions which allegedly followed him throughout the trip.  The vituperative
 attack on Agnew calls him a "very vulgar politician,"  "well-known
 reactionary," and former Maryland governor who advocated repression of
 Negroes and took advantage of his position "to make a shady fortune."
 It says President Nixon chose him as Vice President to win reactionary
 Southern votes and recalls Agnew's attacks on the press and antiwar move-
 ment.  The commentary concludes, however, that the trip's "failure" has
 not been caused by Agnew's personality but by President Nixon's war
 policy.  VNA's 17 January summary of the commentary deletes the personal
 attack on Agnew.
 As in earlier propaganda, Le Binh recounts how Agnew was sent to explain
 the new Asian policy and V'ietnamization.  It says again that he "sneaked"
 in and out of Saigon because of fear and claims he expressed concern
 over the influence of the antiwar movement on U.S. troops in Vietnam.
 MOSCOW     Moscow comment on the conclusion of Vice President Agnew's
 tour, including a Kudryavtsev IZVESTIYA article on 18 January,
 asserts that Agnew failed in his effort to "explain" the Guam doctrine
 and to stop national liberation and reestablish U.S. domination in Asia.
 TASS' 20 January report on the Vice President's return to Washington
 notes that he said in his airport speech that the United States enjoys
 love and respect in Asia.  TASS comments that this love and respect
 comes from "reactionary regimes" and that the anti-American demonstrations
 the Vice President encountered during his trip show the true sentiments
 of the Asian people.

 MOSCOW ON VIETNAMIZATION, TROOP WITHDRAWAL
 Recent statements by U.S. officials are used as pegs in Moscow's
 continuing criticism of the U.S. Vietnamization program.  TASS complains
 on the 15th that Secretary Rogers, in a TV interview the preceding
 day, did not give a timetable for troop withdrawal.  Quoting Rogers
 as referring to the U.S. intention to "reduce" the number of American
 troops,  TASS observes that "U.S. political commentators" are saying
 more and more often that Washington does not intend to pull out all
 its troops.  TASS says U.S. intentions were confirmed by President
 Thieu's statement that it will take "many years" to withdraw all U.S.
 troops.  Noting that Rogers said he did not know if President Nixon
 planned to appoint a new head of the U.S. delegation in Paris, TASS
 comments that this shows a U.S. intention to play down the talks.
 Comment on Rogers' 3.8 January TV interview says that although he
 claimed that the war had been significantly deescalated.in the past
 year, his remarks on troop withdrawal show that the United States
 plans to continue the war and seek a military solution.  TASS on the
 19th says his comments on the retention of some combat troops in
 South Vietnam to protect support troops means that the Secretary
 "actually confirmed" Thieu's recent statement that American troops would
 remain for "many years."  The domestic service observes in this
 connection that although land forces will be "slightly reduced,-"
 Air Force and artillery firepower will be "significantly increased";
 and it cites Secretary Laird as having said that the amount of bombs
 and shells will greatly compensate for the withdrawal of "several
 tens of thousands of troops."
 Commenting, on White House spokesman Ziegler's statement following
 Secretary Rogers' comments of the 18th, Moscow says the United States
 has made it understood that it does not intend even to partially
 withdraw troops.  The domestic service and Radio Peace and Progress
 on the 18th attribute to Ziegler the statement that the troop
 withdrawal may be "slowed down or completely halted" and that the
 Vietnamization program is not connected with a complete troop
 withdrawal.
 A Moscow broadcast in English to the United Kingdom on the 16th,
 discussing Secretary Laird's 15 January statement in Los Angeles on
 defense budget cuts, claims that he ss -  nat 50 percent of U.S. troops
 would remain in South Vietnam and that they would be "mostly" combat
 troops.  In fact Laird said that after the United States withdraws
 a "substantial" number of troops, half of the remaining men would be
 combat troops; this remark is reported accurately in a 17 January
 TASS report of Laird's remarks in Santa Monica on the 16th.

 MOSCOW BROADCASTS OF U. S. POW MESSAGES
 In English to North America on 19 January, Radio Moscow broadcasts
 Christmas messages from 15 U.S. pilots held prisoner in the DRV.
 Moscow says that the U.S. State Department has "long been conducting
 a stubborn propaganda campaign" accusing the DRV of "mistreating"
 American prisoners and that these messages show that the U.S.
 authorities are "not telling the truth."  The messages are virtually
 the same as those previously carried by Hanoi radio and by the "Voice
 of Vietnam" (Hanoi radio) broadcast over Havana radio, although
 Moscow has omitted portions of some of the statements.  Moscow's
 initial announcement on the 16th that the messages would be broadcast
 said that the tapes were recorded by Hanoi radio and loaned to Radio
 Moscow.*  The broadcast thus far has been repeated a number of times
 through the 20th.  There is no available Moscow acknowledgment of the
 State Department's 19 January protest.
 On 21 January Radio Peace and Progress broadcast in English to Asia
 a version of a message urging GIs in South Vietnam to support the
 peace movement back home, from a Marine private named Sweeney who is
 quoted as saying he is "now serving with the people of South Vietnam
 in their fight against the aggressive war."  Another version of the
 message was included in the 19 January Radio Moscow broadcast, and a
 statement attributed to him was carried in a Moscow broadcast in
 English to North America on 17 January which identified him as an
 American "prisoner of war."  In that statement, however, Sweeney was
 represented as saying that he "crossed over to the side of the
 Vietnamese people" on 22 February.  Several similar statements
 attributed to Sweeney were publicized b5 LPA and Liberation Radio
 during December, and reports of his alleged defection were carried
 by LPA and Hanoi Radio last March and April.
 *  A service message from VNA's Moscow office to its headquarters in
 Hanoi said that Hanoi and Liberation Radio broadcasts had been unintel-
 ligible in several localities of the USSR, and that even with "the
 embassy's special equipment" reception of Hanoi radio had been poor.
 It went on to say that the Moscow radio broadcasts of the "air pirates'"
 tape recordings "on our humanitarian policy" had created "very big
 repercussions in the United States and in the world" and that a' number
 of radio stations have asked Radio Moscow for the recordings.

 HANOI COMMENT ON PRISONER-OF-WAR ISSUE
 Hanoi propaganda continues to score the Nixon Administration for using
 "deceptions and odious maneuvers to mislead public opinion" on the
 question of American airmen captured in the DRV.  On 16 January, VNA
 carries a NHAN DAN article which echoes this notion and reiterates DRV
 policy on captured U.S. airmen.  It repeats the DRV position on a
 settlement, claiming that the NFLSV solution "has clearly provided
 for negotiations on the question of armymen captured during the war."
 The article censures the Administration for "obstinately refusing" to
 accept the solution as a basis for settling the Vietnam problem and
 takes the occasion to repeat the claim that the United States is
 downgrading the Paris talks by refusing to send an official chief
 delegate to Paris.  It again charges the United States with full
 responsibility for the delay in settlement of the prisoner-of-war
 issue as well as of the Vietnam problem as a whole.
 VNA reports on 16 January that the president of the GDR Red Cross,
 Dr. Werner Ludwig, in a press statement on 13 January "refuted the
 false report spread by the Western press to the effect that the 21st
 conference of the International Red Cross held in Istanbul* had
 rejected" the DRV stand concerning, the prisoner-of-war question.
 Ludwig's statement had claimed that the question of U.S. airmen
 captured in the DRV "has never been included in the agenda of the
 conference, and there har! been no resolution of the conference on this
 question."  ADN's domest~c service noted the press statement on
 13 January.
 HANOI ON U,S, "ACTS OF WAR" AGAINST THE DRV
 FOREIGN MINISTRY         The DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman issued a
 SPOKESMAN'S PROTEST      protest on 19 January, according to a Hanoi
 radio broadcast of the same day, which scores
 the alleged U.S. use of B-52 bo;.nibers against the demilitarized zone
 (DMZ).  The statement claims that "following bombing and strafing
 by U.S. aircraft on 13 and 14 January" (no protect was issued for
 these charges), the United States on the 17th sent B-52's to bomb
 The 21st conference of the International Red Cross was held in
 Ista%bul 6-13 September last year.  On that occasion the DRV Red
 Cross Society issued a memorandum which it forwarded to the conference.
 Foy a discussion of the memorandum and the POW issue, see the TRENDS
 of 17 September 1969, pages 8-10.  The conference unanimously passed
 a resolution calling for the humane treatment of prisoners of war;
 although it was directed at the DRV, it did not single out prisoners of
 war in the Vietnam context.

 Huong Lap village and launched artillery attacks from positions south
 of the DMZ against Vinh Son village, both of which are located in
 the northern part of the DMZ.      Claiming that the alleged bombings and
 straftngs cGuoed damage in human lives and property, the protest says
 routinely that the DRV Government "strongly denounces and severely
 condemns thkvse acts of war" and demands that the United States
 immediately atop a11 violations of DRV sovereignty and security.
 The last DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's protest was broadcast on
 4 December, charging the United States with shelling Vinh Son
 village "from positions south of the demilitarized zone."  The most
 recent protest against alleged B-52 bombings appeared on 28 October.
 WAR CRIMES     On 20 January, VNA reports that the DRV War Crimes
 STATEMENT      Commission ioeued a statement on the 17th on "crimes"
 committed by .he United States since President Nixon's
 inauguration.  In addition to discussing alleged crimes against South
 Vietnam, the statement claims that 11,980 reconnaissance sorties were
 made to carry out 7,970 reconnaissance missions over the DRV.  It
 asserts the.t, tactical aircraft launched a total of 657 attacks from the
 15th to the 19th parallels, and it makes the unusual claim that in
 December 1969 U.S. aircraft "even went beyond the 20th parallel to
 attack Son Tien village, Quang Hoa district (west of Thanh Hoa)."
 Although the statemcnt claims that B-52's were used against Quang Binh
 Province and Vinh Linh area, no total number for the alleged "raids"
 is cited.  Nor are statistics cited to support the charge of use
 of artillery from ships and from south of the demilitarized zone against
 the DMZ.
 The VNA account of the 15 January Paris session reports some of Lau's
 specific charges against the President for stepping up tr: war in 1969.
 Lau cites no sources for his statistics, which vary from those in
 the war crimes statement.  He claims that in 1969 there were 11,810
 violations of DRV airspace by reconnaissance planes, 600 attacks by
 tactical aircraft, 40 raids by B-521s, and nearly 300 attacks by U.S.
 ships or by artillery from south of the demilitarized zone.  VNA also
 notes his routine assertions that maximum pressure has been applied
 by the United States on the South Vietnam battlefield and that
 TJ.S.-ARVN sweep operations in 1969 were double those of 1968.

 COMMENT ON COORDINATED POLITICAL, MILITARY STRUGGLE
 QUAN DOI NHAN DAN     Hanoi on 19 January broadcasts an article from
 the army paper QUAN DOI NIIAN DAN which discusses
 the rolat;lonship between political and military struggle, calling it
 a "very important and urgent requirement" for victory.  The article
 says the 'victories over the past year have boon directed at the "two
 core forces":  the military forces and "political bondage apparat'ba."
 It claims that these military victories have proved that people's
 uprisings can be supported by annihilating the allies and that,
 conversely, accelerating uprisings can create the necessary conditions
 to annihilate the allies.  The article stressed that military action
 can help the people to rise up and build revolutionary administrations
 and that those "liberated" areas then provide a rear base for the
 military forces.
 LIBERATION FRONT      Liberation Radio on the 15th carries an editorial
 from GIAI PHONG (Liberation) which outlines
 requirements for "effecting a new guerrilla high tide."  The paper
 says it is necessary to "urgently" step up the guerrilla war and, in
 close cooperation with "political and proselyting activities," create
 a spring offensive and simultaneous uprising movements.  It is also
 necessary, the editorial says, to "realize the mass nature of the
 movement," to step up propaganda and educational activities, and to
 mobilize the masses.  It adds that regional forces must be built into
 very skillful political task forces and troop proselyting forces.
 On the 17th, Liberation Radio broadcasts what it calls a station
 editorial to mark the "10th anniversary of spontaneous uprisings in
 the delta on 17 January 1960."  It says that violence cannot be viewed
 simply as armed struggle and that the assessment of the balance of
 forces cannot be based only upon military forces of both sides.  To
 do so, it adds, could make it impossible to appreciate the revolution's
 strength,  The editorial says that in the spontaneous uprisings the
 people relied mainly on "political violence" and coordinated with the
 armed forces, and it asserts that the joining of armed struggle with
 political struggle is the basic form of revolutionary violence "in the
 general uprising movement dust as in the present general offensive."
 Liberation Radio on the 15th broadcasts the 4 January circular on
 "stepping up the political offensive and the proselyting work" during
 Tet  which was issued by the PRG Information and Culture Ministry
 and the NFLSV.  The circular says that in order to follow Ho, who no
 longer can send a Tet greeting, the people must accelerate political
 motivation and troop proselyting.

 PREPARATIONS FOR VIETNAM WORKERS PARTY LOTH ANNIVERSARY
 DRV media report widespread, low-level emulation and propaganda activities
 to mark the IOt?h anniversary of the Vietnam Workers Party (VWP) on
 3 February.  On 18 January Hanoi releases a VWP Secretariat circular and
 party slogans on the occasion.  Also in connection with the anniversary,
 VNA on 20 January carries a summary of a book entitled "40 Years of
 Activity of the Party" which it says was "recently" compiled by the
 Department of Party History and Research under the Central Committee.
 NIIAN DAY, according to VNA, has published the book "part by part."  in
 addition, VNA from 14 to 17 January carries old documents related to the
 anniversary.  These include an excerpt from "The Revolutionary Rosfl,"
 a series of lectures by Ho Chi Minh, published in 1926 in Canton; Ho's
 article entitled "Lenin and the Colonial Peoples," published in PRAVDA
 on 27 January 1924; an appeal to the Vietnamese people by Ho on
 18 February 1930; an appeal by Ho in June 1941; and a speech by Ho made
 at the ceremony on 5 January 1960 celebrating the 30th anniversary of
 the party.
 Press comment on the VWP anniversary comes in a 13 January QUAN DOI NHAN
 DAN editorial which stresses the critical position of party leadership
 in the army.
 SECRETARIAT        Hanoi radio in its domestic service on 18 January broad-
 CIRCULAR                                casts the VWP Central Committee Secretariat's circular
 which notes that, in compliance with the Politburo
 resolution of April 1969 on the four major anniversaries in 1970,* the
 Secretariat is issuing guidelines for commemorating the party anniversary.
 In celebrating the party anniversary, the circular calls for the taking
 of "practical, specific measures" to comply with Ho's testament, which
 it says is a "long-term task for the entire party, army, and people."
 It points out the necessity of "propagandizing and disseminating  the
 Politburo's and Council of Minister's resolution on the 1970 state plan
 to step up production and it warns of the necessity to continue the "anti-
 U.S. national salvation resistance" until final victory, explaining that
 +-  The four major anniversaries to be celebrated in 1970 are the 40th
 anniversary of the party, the 100th anniversary of Lenin's birthday,
 the 80th anniversary of Ho's birthday, and the 25th anniversary of the
 DRV's founding.  The Politburo resolution on the four major anniversaries
 was not released until 8 July 1969, when it was broadcast by Hanoi radio.

 the combat and combat-serving tasks and military duties must be fulfilled
 in order to contribute toward aiding the front.  (Although the resolution
 was mentioned previously, in a 26 December NIIAN DAN editorial, its text
 is not known to have appeared in DRV propaganda.)
 The circular notes in addition that attention must be paid to teaching
 the party's revolutionary tradition by reading "The Party's ItO Years of
 Activities" which was published in NHAN DAN; that an emulation movement
 to "develop production, serve combat, and prepare to fight" must be
 launched; and that the task of improving the quality of party members
 and admitting members into the party must be prepared and organized.*
 (Hanoi radio notes that a Politburo resolution addressed to this subject
 will be sent later.)  The circular further stetes that a "political and
 theoretical activities drive" to study statements by leading comrades
 must be organized.  (The radio again says that a particular circular on
 this from the party's Propaganda and Training Department will be issued.)
 In organizing the celebrations of the anniversary, the circular says
 that each locality and base will be responsible and commemoration
 statements should include "a summary of the struggle process of the
 party and the local party committee, the present duty of the entire
 party and the local party committee, and the immediate tasks facing the
 locality or unit."
 ANNIVERSARY        VNA on 18 January releases 31 slogans which it says
 SLOGANS            are published by all Hanoi papers to celebrate the
 party anniversary.  Slogans are not usually issued on
 the party anniversary, but the present slogans generally follow the
 pattern of those issued each year in the past for May Day and to jointly
 mark the 19 Au6ast anniversary of the August Revolution and 2 September
 DRV National Day.**  In honor of the party anniversary, the slogan list
 *   The Politburo resolution on the four major anniversaries released on
 8 July had noted the necessity of preparing a "brief summary of the
 40-year history of the party which will be used as a reading document
 for party members and the masses."  The resolution had also said chat one
 of the plans for preparations for the anniversaries was "to organize and
 recruit a new class of party members."
 **  In 1.968 Hanoi reduced the number of slogans issued for May Day and in
 August, from 36 slogans in August 1967 to 24 in May 1968 and 23 in August
 1968.  (See the 21 August 1968 FBIS TRENDS for a discussion of changes
 in 1968 slogans.)  In 1969 the list of May Day slogans was somewhat
 longer than the previous year--29 slogans.  Only eight slogans were
 issued last August, however, possibly because of Ho's illness.

 contains a greeting on the occasion and an additional appeal to the
 party, army, and people to "unite closely around the party's Central
 Conunittec" and act upon Ho's testament to dnfeat the United States
 and build socialism.  The traditional coroluding slogan--"long live
 President Hoy'--ia changed to:  "eternal (?atitude to the great
 President Ho Chi Minh."
 For the first time since August 1967, the slogans specifically refer
 to the Soviet Union and China in offering thanks for "precious support
 and assistance," there are separate slogans for the Soviet Union, for
 China, and for "the parties, governments, and peoples of brotherly
 socialist countries."  Inexplicably, VNA'a account of the slogans on
 the party anniversary does not include the usual declaration "long
 live the socialist countries' solidarity based on Marxism-Leninism
 and international proletarianism.'
 Also for the first time since August 1967, there is a slogan addressed
 to national minorities in the DRV, calling for solidarity and efforts
 to develop their economy and culture.  And, for the first time in the
 same period, there is a slogan calling upon Chinese residents in the
 DRV to strengthen "Vietnam-China solidarity and contribute to the
 struggle against U.S. aggression, for national salvation, and socialist
 construction."
 Another change is the addition to the slogan or,, agriculture of a call
 for cooperative farmers to "correctly apply the regulations on
 cooperatives . . . ."  The cooperative regulations were released last
 August and the importance of their implementation has been repeatedly
 underlined in propaganda since then.
 Separate May 3969 slogans hailing the NFLSV and the South Vietnam
 Alliance are not repeated.  The PRG--formed in June 1969, but not mentioned
 in the brief August 1969 DRV slogans--is saluted along with the NFLSV in
 the current slogan welcoming southern "victories" under their leadership.
 A slogan first used in may 1969, calling for the development of North
 Vietnamese forces and efforts to "fulfill the duties of the great rear
 toward the great frontline," is not repeated in the current party
 slogans and did noc appear in the abbreviated slogans last August.
 However, there is a slogan, like one last August, which declares:  "Let
 us .    . persevere: in and step up the war of resistance to U.S.
 aggression, for 'ational salvation, till total victory, liberate the
 South, defend the North, and proceed to the peaceful reunification of
 the country."
 Slogans used in May 1969 and earlier, addressed to the communications
 and transportation service, are not repeated.

 that followed the September meeting between Premiers Kosygin and
 Chou En-lai.  A TABS report on 17 January, carried'in the central
 press the next day, adds CPR economic developments to the range of
 polemical targets.  In Soviet broadcasts, comment presenting Moscow's
 side of the conflict has been given worldwide dissemination; programs
 beamed to CPR border areas have begun taking note of conditions in
 minority areas, with a Uighur refugee's talk in his native language
 deploring the plight of his people in Sinkiang; and ominous warnings
 have been conveyed to the Chinese regarding the devastating power of
 the Soviet nuclear arsenal.  There has also been a revived reference--
 thus far the sole one--to "Mao and his group," a crucial formula
 implying a faction without legitimate authority and thus justifying
 interventionist tactics.
 The 9 January TASS attack on the Chinese war preparations campaign and
 the subsequent polemical surge indicate a shift ~n Moscow's approach
 toward a tougher l'.ne during the current, second stage in the Sino-Soviet
 talks.  Though the TASS report attributed Chinese militarization to
 domestic needs, a menacing tone has arisen in subsequent comment drawing
 Implications in the foreign sphere.  A LITERARY GAZETTE article on
 14 January-which contair9 the reference to "Mao and his group"--warns
 the Chinese that their war preparations intensify international tension,
 are "cl;sarly provocative," and "in essence signify preparations for
 aggression."  Similarly, an article in the weekly NEW TIMES (No. 3) states
 that the Chinese measures "might have been regarded as China's internal
 affairs" had the militarization of all activities in the CPR "not been
 accompanied by frenzied rrtlitary preparations and the expansion of arms."
 Most notably, an article in the military paper RED STAR on 21 January--
 available in a TASS summary--introduces an element that would be likely
 to figure in a Soviet rationale for sterner measures against the Chinese.
 In addition to discussing the internal reasons for the Chinese campaign,
 according to TASS, the article "also emphasizes the external, strategic
 aspect of the large-scale war preparations" in China.  Referring to
 Peking's "expansionist, adventuristic course" vis-a-vis n?ighboring
 countries, the article observes that it "ie clear that the Maoists
 today can hardly reckon on success of any big armed gamble."  But the
 article then adds:  "However, it should be born;_ in mind that the
 Maoists have long been gradually gathering strength."  This marks the
 first time since the Kosygin-Chou meeting that Moscow has evoked the

 specter of a growing Chinese military potential menacing other countries.
 It also represents the most forthright expression of hawkish sentiments
 to come out of Moscow during this period.
 While Moscow has been conducting a wide-ranging polemical campaign,
 Peking has muted the major propaganda buns which had thundered defiance
 at the Soviets at the turn of the year.  Thus Peking's end-of-the-decade
 pronouncements may have been intended as an exercise in the "irreconcilable"
 ideological struggle which the Chinese had promised in their announcement
 last October of the agreement to hold talks with the Soviets.  As for the
 negotiations front, the report in the Hong Kong paper TA KUNG PAO on
 9 January, serving as a channel for leaking Peking's views on the talks,
 was restrained in tone and reflected a continuing interest in defusing
 current tensions.
 MOSCOW ON        The rising level of Soviet polemics has included various--
 PEKING TALKS                             and more frequent--references to the Peking talks, though
 these are still confined to foreign broadcasts.  A Radio
 Peace and Progress broadcast in Mandarin on 15 January expresses regret at
 the CPR war preparedness campaign and dissemination of anti-Soviet
 "fabrications" in the CPR at the time when the delegations of the two
 governments are holding negotiations in Peking.  Similar sentiments are
 expressed on the 16th in a widely broadcast Radio Moscow commentary which
 stresses the need for the Chinese tide to "show its goodwill and sincerity"
 and to "take a positive and realistic approach" at the Peking talks in
 order to "resolve the difficulty concerning relations between our two
 countries."
 In a rare reference to the border issue,  the 16 January commentary
 emphasizes that the Soviet Union "is concentrating its efforts on
 settling the border problem with China" and, recalling that the Soviet
 Union proposed Sino-Soviet talks on border issues as early as 1964,
 observes that "negotiations are the only reasonable method to end the
 abnormal state of relations" between the two countries.  References to
 the border issue have been rare in Soviet propaganda since the Peking
 talks began.
 BROADCASTS       Abandoning the indirect and allegorical polemics in
 TO CHINA         which Moscow had been presenting its case to Chinese
 audiences, broadcasts beamed to the CPR are now
 criticizing Peking directly.  Attention has been directed to the
 sensitive matter of party reorganization, with a broadcast in Mandarin
 on the 17th, for example, Ceploring the dominant role being given the
 military in rebuilding the CCP.  A Peace and Progress commentary on the
 18th complains that a pro-Soviet label is being pinned on elements which
 the Peking leaders fear will regain their past role in the party.

 Broadcaots in :ninority languages have again t gun to teke note of
 conditions in border areas, as in a Radio Peace mid Progress commentary
 in Mongolian on the 17th describing the militarization campaign in
 Inner Mongolia, Sinkiang, and Tibet.  And on the 16th the Tashkent
 station broadcasting in Uighur carried a talk by a Uighur refugee
 concerning Maoist repression in Sinkiang.  Material o:i.' this sort has
 been featured in harsh Soviet propaganda campaigns in the past.
 While much of the Soviet comment beamed to China seeks to counteract
 the portrayal of an imminent Soviet invasion, insisting that the USSR
 has never had any intention of attacking the CPR, a 13 January broadcast
 in Radio Moscow's regular program for the PLA calls attention to the
 massive destruction which a nuclear attack on China could inflict.
 Though China is not mentioncd directly, the broadcast takes clear aim
 at the Maoist strategy of people's war--it actually quotes a Maoist
 maxim on guerrilla warfare--and warns pointedly that an enemy could
 launch devastating nuclear striker without sending troops to invade
 the country.  This argument in effect undercuts the sort of military
 preparations currently being undertaken by the Chinese in the face of
 a putative Soviet invasion.
 In recent years Radio Moscow's program for the PLA has sought to play
 upon discontent within the Chinese professional military over Maoist
 military doctrine.  Attention has characteristically been directed to
 the outmoded weapons systems of the PLA, to the perversion of its mission
 in the course of the cultural revolution, and to its impotence in the
 arena of great powers.  As shown in the 33 January broadcast, this message
 can have particularly ominous overtones in the context of acutely strained
 Sino-Soviet relations.
 Last March, following the border clashes that month, the Soviets were
 explicitly frank in conveying warnings to the Chinese.  Though limiting
 these threats to broadcasts to China over Radio Peace and Progress, the
 Soviets coupled chilling descriptions of their nuclear capability with
 denigrating accounts of what the Chinese could throw into a major contest
 of arms.  The Soviet threi.ts evoked widespread Western comment, prompting
 Moscow to issue a rebuttal--carried only in an English-language 'broadcast
 to Britain on 21 March--denouncing the British for purveying "the
 provocatory false rumor of possible Soviet nuclear action against China."
 SING-SOVIET-      In offering a variety of explanations for the Chinese
 U.S. TRIANGLE     war preparedness campaign, some Radio Peace and Progress
 broadcasts in Mandarin suggest that the fanning of anti-
 Soviet sentiment and war psychosis is designed to distract attention from
 the recently revived U.S.-Chinese discussions in Warsaw.  Radio Peace and
 Progress continues to inform Chinese listeners about developments in U.S.-
 Chinese relations, observing, for example, that the fact of the two sides'

 meeting in each other's embassies "demonotxatesthe highly secretive
 nature of the talks."  Such propaganda comes against the background
 of the pervasive Soviet line thf.t the CPR's war preparations and
 anti-Soviet activities give aid and comfort to "imperialism."
 Earlier in the month LIFE ABROAD (No. 2)--a-week4, publication containing
 foreign press comment which Moscow characteristically uses to raise
 issues which it is reticent to address directly--concluded a selection
 of articles dealing with U.S.-Chinese relations with a comment by
 Kravchenko which put the onus for reviving the U.S.-Chinese Warsaw
 talks squarely on Washington.  Kravchenko suggested that the change in
 Washington's China policy would have been welcomed if it had been
 intended to improve the international atmosphere, but that since the
 current overtures were made "in patently anti-Soviet tones" amid
 "fantasies about an illusory 'Moscow threat' to the CPR," they simply
 reflected "the insidious at*~empts of warlike circles in the United
 States to complicate the relations between the USSR and the CPR."

 FRG-GDR  RELATIONS
 ULBRICHT REPEATS FAMILIAR TREATY DEMANDS, CRITICIZES BRANDT
 In a lengthy prepared statement read at a press conference on 19 January,
 GDR State Council Chairman Ulbricht leaves the door open for talks with
 West Germany on a treaty on the establishment of relations between the
 two German states.  But he shows little signs of flexibility, repeating
 such long-standing demands on Bonn as the demand for "unreserved recognition
 of the status quo in Europe, particularly the recognition of the GDR as a
 state under international law."  He also calls for recognition of the borders
 between the GDR and the FRG as state borders and for Bonn's renunciation of
 the claim to sole representation of thy" German people.
 Ulbricht says that West German Chancellor Brandt in his 114 January speech,
 while he acknowledged the existence of two German states and indicated
 he no longer wanted to talk about reunification, "did not dare to define
 his attitude" toward the GDR's draft treaty, forwarded to FRG authorities
 on 18 December.  And Ulbricht is critical of Brandt's proposal for negotia='
 tions with the GDR on a non-use-of-force agreement.  Noting that the GDR
 draft treaty contains such a proposal, he says that if Bonn really wants
 to renounce the use of force against the GDR, "then it first of all has to
 prove the sincerity of its intention by recognizing the GDR as a sovereign
 German state and by establishing equal relations with her."
 Ulbricht "welcomes" the fact that talks have begun between the FRG and the
 USSR on renunciation of force and says that "we for the time being are
 waiting for the outcome of the talks between the Soviet Union and the FRG
 before we . . . conclude a treaty with the FRG."  He adds that the problems
 of a non-ued-of-force agreement belong to the "basic problems which should
 be discussed during the negotiation which we are still ready to hold."
 Observing that "it is known" that Bonn has drawn up a draft treaty, Ulbricht
 advises Brandt to consult with workers in West Germany about their attitude
 toward the GDR's draft treaty before sending the West German document to
 the GDR.  In answer to a question at the press conference regarding a
 possible referendum in West Germany on the draft treaty, he says "we iave
 no objection" to it although this is a matter for the West Germans them-
 selves to decide.

 Ulbricht also takes Brandt to task for his reservations about a European
 security conference, observing that while no European state has linked
 its participation in a conference to "some kind of preconditirn," Brandt
 alone has made the FRG participation "dependent upon the ourcome of
 talks between the two German states."  (Brandt stated on 14 January
 that FRG participation "would be of little use unless some positive
 beginning in the inter-German sphere has materialized.")  "Brandt knows
 as well as we do," Ulbricht says, that the negotiations between the two
 German states will require a long period of time and that the early
 convening of a European security conference could be significant for the
 mitigation of tension between the FRG and the GDR.
 TASS REPORT     A fairly extensive TASS account of Ulbricht's statement
 on the 19th includes the asserti''n that a renunciation-
 of-force agreement demands recognition of the GDR but pointedly omits
 the reference to the FRG-USSR talks on renunciation of force.  The TASS
 report on the question-and-answer session of the press conference also
 ignores the reply to a question by IZVESTIYA correspondent Stepanov in
 which Ulbricht referred to the talks between Moscow and Bonn.  These
 omissions are consistent with the USSR's virtual silence on the talks
 which opened in Moscow in early December.

 MIDDLE EAST
 MOSCOW PLAYS UP ISSUE OF WESTERN ARMS TO ISRAEL
 While Moscow's recent critical attention to the U.S. proposals for a Middle
 East settlement diminishes somewhat, routine comment continues to attack
 the proposals for failing in particular to call for "unconditional" Israeli
 withdrawal.  Moscow currently focuses on the issue of Western arms to
 Israel in support of charges that the United States shows "hypocrisy" in
 seeking to project a balanced U.S. attitude toward a Middle East settle-
 ment when in fact Washington backs Israeli "aggression" and thwarts a
 political settlement.  In this connection, the propaganda cites reports of
 shipments of surplus U.S. arms to Israel via the Belgian port of Zeebrugge,
 modernization and conversion of British Centurion tanks for delivery to
 Israel, and statements by U.S. "Zionist organizations" and American
 Congressmen, particularly by Senator Javits during his current Middle East
 visit, urging the Administration to consider additional military and
 economic aid.
 RED STAR observes on 16 January that the main "and for certain types of
 military equipment the only source of supply for Israel remains the
 United States."  The paper insists that even the policy of "permanent
 military pressure" will not bring the desired results for Tel Aviv,
 since "despite the objective difficulties" the "anti-imperialist Arab
 front" is being strengthened, as are the "defense capacity" of the Arab
 armies and the activity of the "Palestinian partisans."  RED STAR adds
 that the Palestinian movement "will play an ever increasing role in the
 balance of power" in the Middle East conflict.  In the last such remarks
 on a Palestinian fedayeen role, Belyayev in the 26 November LIFE ABROAD
 and a Koryavin domestic service commentary on 19 December had said that
 Tel Aviv would increasingly have to take into account the "Palestinian
 partisans,  which Belyayev called a "new political factor" and Koryavin
 described as a "mighty force."

 Moscow tells its domestic audience that these
 "plInpricks" have been militarily unsuccessful, while lecturing Arab
 listeners on array morale and fighting spirit and advising them to study
 Soviet experience in these matters.
 A Ryzhikov domestic service commentary on the 16th dismisses as a "lot of
 fuss" reports by Western correspondents and news agencies about Israeli
 "attempts" to bomb "regions deep within the UAR."  Ryzhikov says the
 uproar concerns "Israeli raids on Egyptian troop  positions in the
 region of al-Khankah, 15 kilometers northeast of Cairo, and at-Tall

 al-Kabir, 65 kilometers northeast of the UAR capital."  He quotes "in
 full" the UAR military communique in connection with "the last attempt"
 to penetrate Egypt, on 13 January, to show that "from a purely military
 point of view these raids were not successful."  But the Israeli
 general staff, according to Ryzhikov, "is hardly guided by military
 motives when it sends its pilots into areas dangerously close to Cairo";
 rather,  by "these pinpricks" Israel tries to achieve the "political
 aim" of upsetting the UAR's progressive regime.  He cites AFP as
 reporting from Tel Aviv that "local observers" consider the very
 appearance of Israeli aircraft close to Cairo as sure to bring
 "important political and psychological consequences."
 Soviet concern is conveyed in a Moscow broadcast in Arabic on the 19th
 which discourses on the meaning of the "morale factor in war," observing
 that Soviet experience in "bringing up soldiers morally and politically
 is the center of much attention by military experts" both of the socialist
 countries and of other "friendly countries, including the Arab countries."
 The broadcast explains that "to strengthen the fighting spirit of the
 armies and subsequently raise their morale is of primary importance to
 the Arab countries confronting the imperialist and Zionist aggressors,"
 and it concludes pointedly that Soviet experience in this-regard ! could
 be of importance to the Arab countries."
 An Arabic-language commentary on the 20th, on the visit of a Soviet
 parliamentary delegation to the UAR, speaks of the "special importance"
 of Soviet assistance to the UAR, which is "bearing the main burden" of
 the struggle against Israeli "aggression."  It defensively rejects
 "imperialist and Israeli prpaganda" warnings of the "danger of Soviet
 infiltration," contrasting the "noble" aims of Soviet assistance to the
 Arabs with the ulterior motives of Israel's imperialist "protectors."
 Such intrigues by enemies of Soviet-Arab friendship, it declares, "have
 received and will continue to receive a suitable reply, whether from the
 Arab peoples or from the Soviets."

 NIGERIA
 MOSCOW IMPLICATES U.S. DIRECTLY IN CULPABILITY FOR WAR
 Continuing to contrast benevolent Soviet support for the winning aide
 with "hypocritical" Western aid offers to victims of a war allegedly
 fanned by the West, Moscow tends increasingly to name the United States
 in denigrating the role of the Western powers.  A 17 January RED STAR
 article reviewed by TASS, charging that "the imperialist powers were
 responsible for the conflict," soya "the secessionists' main helper is
 the U.3. CIA" and quotes unspecified Lagos sources as claiming that "the
 CIA financed and recruited American fliers for an 'air bridge' to Africa."
 A broadcast to Africa over Moscow's purportedly unofficial Radio Peace
 and Progress on the 16th goes a step further in por,,rt,ying the United
 States as a supplier of arms to Biafra and an "enemy" of Nigeria.
 Although the United States nosed as a supporter of the Federal Government,
 the broadcast says, "the Americans had secretly stored stockpiles of arms
 in Ghana which were transported to Biafra."  The Americans also, it adds,
 "supplied the separatists with arms airlifted from Portugal and South
 Africa."  Referring to reports of Western offers of aid to Nigeria, the
 broadcast says that now "the Nigerians can clearly see that the hand
 proffereu to them with so-called aid is covered with the blood of
 millions of people lost in the fratricidal war that had been incited
 by the imperialists."
 There are also slaps at the British, with a TABS London-datelined
 dispatch on the 15th saying that "so-called humanitarian" concern on
 the part of British capitalists is in fact concern for their own
 profits from oil and cacao interests in Nigeria.
 Moscow commentaries only occasionally suggested specific U.S. and
 British complicity in past propaganda on the war, normally referring
 in general terms to the "Westerrx imperialists."  This circumspection
 carried over into initial Soviet comment on the Federal Government's
 victory.  Although some of the comment is now more explicit, the most
 frequent propaganda line is still a generalized allegation that "the
 imperialists" are trying to exploit the sufferings of the Ibos for their
 own--chiefly economic--advantage.

 USSR AND SPAIN
 SPANISH CP DEFENSIVE ON REPORT OF MADRID-MOSCOW CONTACT
 A Spanish CP Executive Committee statement dealing with a variety of
 subjects, broadcast over the party's clandestine Radio Espana
 Independiento on 18 January, contains the first direct comment by
 the party on Western press reports of a lato-December Moscow airport
 meeting between the Spanish Foreign Min:Lator and senior Soviet officials.
 in a defensive vein, the statement expresses "surprise" over the reports
 and observes that they "have not been confirmed by Soviet sources."  It
 asserts that oven if the reports should prove accurate, the meeting and
 Ito implications would not affect the party's struggle against the Franco
 regime.
 Observing that socialist states "do not interfere at all" in party affairs,
 the statement denounces as "a slander if not an illusion" a Spanish
 journalist's contention that a rapprochement between Spain and "a socialist
 country" might "influence the pace and determination" of the party's
 struggle.  The statement reiterates the party's position on the "untime-
 liness" of establishing "any type of political relations" with a regime
 imposed "with the support of Hitler and Mussolini--a regime, that is,
 moreover, nearing its end."  In a 5 January interview over the same radio,
 party Secretary General Santiago Carrillo had used similar language in
 expressing adamant opposition to relations between Spain and the socialist
 countries.*
 The 18 January statement cells upon Poland, which has consular relations
 with Spain, to refuse to sell the Franco regime coal that would be used
 to offset a shortage resulting from the strike of Asturian miners.
 Declaring that socialist countries' "solidarity" with the Spanish people
 "has been a constant fact" to date, the party explains that it has there-
 fore asked the PZPR to deny Spanish news reports concerning the proposed
 coal shipment.  No disclaimer has yet been heard from Polish media.

 CZECHOSLOVAKIA
 PRAGUE DECRIES "TROTSKIYITE" PLAT. HINTS WESTERN COMPLICITY
 Prague media have reacted to efforts by Western news media to "belittle"
 an alleged T'rotnkiyite conspiracy unearthed by the Czechoslovak regime
 on 12 January, insisting that the arrests made in the case were
 necessary to remove a serious threat posed by a subversive group bent on
 "overthrowing c-.e socialist regimes in Czechoslovakia end other
 socialist countries, primarily the Soviet Union."  Moscow has not
 mentioned the case, which represents the Husak regime's first open
 attack on any group other than the "rightwing opportunist, counter-
 revolutionary" elements blamed for the 1968 events.
 The alleged plot was first divulged on the 12th to a brief Czech Republic
 Interior Ministry announcement on the uncovering of "an antistate
 organization which used conspiratorial method3 and sought to hamper the
 consolidation process and evoke political crises," in "the spirit of
 Trotskiyist ideas."  A Prague radio commentary on the 15th notes Western
 commentators' characterizations of "this new political force" as "a
 mixture of the ideas of Trotskiy, Count Kropotkin, Mao Tse-tung, and
 other leftwing extremists, interbred with all sorts of anarchosyndicalist,
 Albanian-Chinese, Duts chkeite, Cohn-Benditist, and other so-called
 contributions to Marxism."  The commentator goes on to suggest that the
 plot goes deeper and to hint at external financing by "people about
 whom a great deal is known by the FBI and CIA gentlemen in the United
 States."  He adds darkly that "someone" is clearly "exploiting the
 ignorance and lack of experience of a section of the youth."  Elaborating
 the motives behind the alleged plot, he suggests that a Trotskiyite
 "Revolutionary Socialist Party of Czechoslovakia" was envisaged as
 "a quick substitute for the disastrous intellectual sterility" of
 the liberal Dubcek-Smrkovsky regime.
 An article by Hecko in RUDE PRAVO on 17 January is similarly vague
 in its hints at Western (:omplieity.  Under the title "In the Service
 of a Foreign Power," Hec;ko says nothing more concrete than that "many
 facts prove unequivocally" the subversive organization's "connections
 with various Trotskiyite organizations in the West."  It emphasizes that
 members of the organization in Czechoslovakia sasr "an example for
 themselves in certain extremist groups in the West--in anarchy, disorder,
 riots, and chaos proclaimed by them."

 EUROPEAN SECURITY
 MEETING OF EUROPEAN CP'S IN MOSCO,h GETS SCANT PUBLICITY
 A terse communiquo on an unheralded riveting of 28 European communist
 partieo--including the Yugoslav--on 111-15 January, released by TASS
 on the 15th, says the participants "exchanged views on problems of
 collective Security and peace on the European continent," In addition
 to exchanging information on piano for observing the Lenin centenary.
 It adds that the meeting passed in "a spirit of comradely cooperation,"
 but provides no details of the discussion and says nothing about any
 agreement.
 A few brief, passing references to the meeting appear In the context of
 Soviet comment pushing the Idea of a European security conference--
 remarks to the effect that the large gathering of European parties to
 discuss European security in Moscow shows the widespread concern about
 the subject.  Sofia comments briefly to the same effect.  The absence
 of any advance publicity for the meeting and the dearth of comment on
 it after its close suggest that Moscow neither expected nor succeeded
 in achieving much in the way of concrete results, intending rather to
 solicit support for the Soviet approach to European security and to
 gauge the nature and extent of dissent it may expect from the independent-
 minded parties.
 YUGOSLAV     An account of an address delivered at the Moscow meeting by
 POSITION     Yugoslav Presidium member Belovski;  released by TANYUG on
 17 January, is the only available report so far on the
 :,ubstance -.f any of the participants' statements.  Lobbying for the
 Yugoslav position on the anachronistic nature of power blocs, Belovski's
 remarks--and Belgrade's publicity for them--presage less than smooth
 sailing for efforts to achieve united European communist backing for
 Moscow's view of European security.
 Where Moscow propaganda traditionally speaks of liquidation of the
 rival European blocs as a distant, ultimate goal obtainable only when
 NATO ceases to be "aggressive," Belovski's speech elaborates the Yugoslav
 position--essentially shared by Romania--that the future for Europe "does
 not lie in preserving bloc divisions, either in their coexistence or in
 future pacts between existing blocs."  Declaring that Europe is undergoing
 much wider space for an active role in soc;.al and international relations
 than the existing structures allow,"  Calling for a Europe of "independent
 and equal" states,  Belovski goes on to urge support for UN principles
 and by implication attacks the Brezhnev doctrine of limited sovereignty:
 Relations among all European states, he says, should be based "on
 foundations of sovereignty, independence, equality, and noninterference
 in the internal affairs of others for whatever reasons --economic, political,
 military, or ideological."

 Belovoki also regiotors Yugoslav support for "a congress of European
 peoples," which was apparently a subject of discussion at the Moscow
 meeting.  In a 24 April 1967 speech at the Karlovy Vary conference
 of European communist parties, Brezhnev had noted that "some public
 circles in Europe" had railed for the convening of a "congress of the
 peoples of Europe on tho broadest possible basis" to deal with European
 security problems.  Such a congress, he added, "might give new impetus
 to the development of a mass movement" for peace and European security.
 The idea was followed up in the main 6ocumont issued by the June 1969
 international communist party conference in Moscow, which suggested that
 "a broad congress of European rsoples" be held to prepare for and
 "faci,litate" the European security conference proposed by the Warsaw
 Pact states in March.
 Stressing in his speech at the 28-party meeting that such a congress
 should not be a gathering of "ideological fellow-minds" like previous
 European conclaves, Belovski urges that it "bring together responsible
 representatives of communist and workers parties, social democratic,
 socialist, various influential bourgeois, democratic, and Christian
 parties, movements, and groupings"--an assemblage that-could afford
 fertile ground for pressing Yugoslavia's anti-bloc approach.
