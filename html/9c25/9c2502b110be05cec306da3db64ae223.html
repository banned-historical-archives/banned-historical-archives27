 Sec. of Defense Robert S. McNamara, in
 announcing the new ABM network, made the -
 point that neither the United States nor
 Russia  possesses  "first-strike  capability."
 That is, neither nation has the ability to
 attack the other with nuclear weapons with-
 out  suffering -- lethal  retaliation.  Nor,  in
 McNamara's  assessment,  is  either     nation
 likely ever to gain such an advantage.
 McNamara    says  both   Russia and the
 United States are at the point where an
 escalation of defenses or weaponry by either
 nation would result in matching escalation
 by the other. In McNamara's opinion such an
 effort, which would result in the same bal-
 ance of deterrence that now exists, would be
 futile-although the United States is willing
 to spend any amout of money and effort to
 protect itself.             - The unknown danger to the United States
 and the world is Red China. Isolated, sus-
 picious, torn by Internal dissensions, possib-
 ly irresponsible, Red China and its future
 actions cannot be charted. Its animosities
 cannot be assessed. Its potential for destruc-
 tion has been computed. McNamara said a
 limited ABM defense against the Red Chinese
 nuclear  weapons  armory  would  have  a
 "higher  degree  of  reliability against a
 Chinese attack than the much more massive
 and complicated system some have recom-
 mended against a possible Soviet attack."
 The proposed ABM network is thus a nec-
 essary effort to safeguard the future.
 The tragedy of such a necessity is that a
 major power can guard itself and others
 against nuclear attack with the most sophis-
 ticated of weapons and defense measures.
 However,  that  same  sophistication  is  no
 deterrent to the Communist guerrilla who, as
 Mao Tse-tung has said, operates as a "fish
 swimming in the sea of the enemy."
 The battle to neutralize the danger of nu-
 clear attack can be won. The battle for men's
 minds, and world security, is not won. Until
 it is, the need for nuclear weapons and deter-
 rents will remain.
 FEDERAL BAR ASSOCIATION SUP-
 PORTS DIRECT ELECTION OF THE
 PRESIDENT
 Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I am pleased
 to invite the Senate's attention - to the
 action taken by a distinguished organiza-
 tion on the question of electoral reform.
 At its convention held - recently in San
 Francisco, the Federal Bar Association
 adopted an eight-point resolution favor-
 ing an amendment to the Constitution
 which would provide for the election of
 the President and Vice President by a
 direct, nationwide, popular vote, It is
 gratifying to note that the stand taken
 by the Federal Bar Association conforms
 closely with the features of Senate Joint

 S 14360                   CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -- SENATE            c1
 Resolution 2, the constitutional amend-
 ment which I* introduced on January 11,
 for myself and 18 other sponsors.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the Federal Bar Association
 resolution, adopted at the convention in
 San Francisco, be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the reso-
 lution was ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 Resolved that the Federal Bar Association
 hereby places itself on record as favoring an
 Amendment  to  the  Constitution  of  the
 United States which will:
 1. Provide for the election of the President
 and Vice President by direct nationwide pop-
 ular vote;
 2. Require a candidate to obtain at least
 40 per cent of the popular vote in order to
 be elected President or Vice President;
 3. Provide for a national run-off election
 between the two top candidates in the event
 no candidate receives at .least 40 per cent
 of the popular vote;
 4. Require the President and Vice Presi-
 dent to be voted for jointly;
 5. Empower  Congress  to  determine  the
 day's upon which the original election and
 the run-off election are to be held, which days
 shall  be  uniform  throughout  the United
 States;
 6. Provide that the places and manner of
 holding the Presidential election and the in-
 elusion of the names of candidates on the
 ballot shall be prescribed in each state by
 the legislature thereof, with the proviso that
 Congress may at anytime by law make or
 alter such regulations;
 7. Require that the voters for President
 and Vice President in each state shall have
 the qualifications requisite for persons vot-
 ing for members of Congress, with the pro-
 viso that each state may adopt a less re-
 strictive residence requirement for voting for
 President and Vice President provided that
 Congress may adopt uniform age and resi-
 dence requirements; and
 3. Contain appropriate provisions in case
 of the death of a candidate.
 NATIONAL 4-H WEEK
 Mr. MONDALE. Mr. President, tomor-
 row marks the conclusion of this year's
 observance of National 4-H Week. Near-
 ly 3 million members of 4-H in every
 State and territory, residing in both ur-
 ban and rural environs, are now under-
 taking diverse new projects for the com-
 ing year.
 As a former member of 4-H, I know
 firsthand the incalculable contributions
 being made by this program emphasiz-
 ing head, heart, hands, and health. It
 would, I think, be very difficult to over-
 state the tremendous contribution 4-H
 Club activities have made over the last
 five decades to rural America.
 I think it is also appropriate to note,
 particularly during National 4-H Week,
 the increasing contribution which these
 programs are making to urban young-
 sters. The House Appropriations Com-
 mittee, in its report on the fiscal year
 1968 agricultural appropriations bill, ob-
 served this fact and urged that addi-
 tional funds and effort be expended for
 providing additional  opportunities to
 underprivileged youngsters in our great
 cities to participate in 4-H type youth
 development projects. That report stated
 that-
 The wholesome effect of 4-11 club activi-
 ties has been so beneficial to rural youth
 that additional efforts to bring 4-H programs
 to young people in the congested and de-
 prived urban areas of the United States
 would make an invaluable contribution to
 the moral, spiritual, and economic strength
 of this Nation.
 I most heartily concur in the commit-
 tee's recommendation.
 I have, in fact, introduced legislation
 in the Senate which is designed to bring
 these beneficial programs to the young
 people of one of our greatest cities-
 Washington, D.C. At the present time,
 the District of Columbia is the lone city
 statutorily  denied  the  opportunity to
 participate in the activities of the Ex-
 tension Service of the Agriculture De-
 partment, a principle source of support
 and leadership for 4-H. My proposal,
 S. 2105, would eliminate this barrier to
 the development of 4-H Clubs and re-
 lated youth-development activities in
 the District of Columbia. I am pleased
 to report that the bill has received wide
 support, as well as favorable attention,
 by Senator JORDAN'S  Subcommittee on
 Agricultural Research and General Leg-
 islation. I am most hopeful that S. 2105
 will be reported and approved by the
 Senate at an early date.
 Mr. President, 4-H contributed greatly
 to me as an individual. Its contribution
 to the Nation as a whole is known by
 every Member of the Senate. I am hon-
 ored to have this opportunity to express
 my personal appreciation to those mil-
 lions of youngsters and adults whose co-
 operative efforts over the years have
 made, and continue to make, 4-H one of
 America's  most  worthwhile  organiza-
 tions.

 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT
 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent-and this has been
 cleared all around-that there be a time

 controlled by the proponent of the
 amendment and the floor manager of the
 bill [Mr. MAGNUSON], and 1 hour on the
 bill,,to be equally divided and controlled
 by the majority leader and minority
 leader or whoever is designated by them.
 Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, re-
 serving an objection, I wonder if there is
 going to be an opportunity for me, under
 that time limitation, to make a speech of
 'about 5 or 6 minutes.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. There will be plenty
 of time.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection to the unanimous-consent re-
 quest? Without objection, it is so ordered.
 ORDER OF BUSINESS
 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, this
 time will not start until after the dis-
 tinguished manager of the bill, the Sen-
 ator from Washington [Mr. MAGNUSON],
 makes his opening remarks.
 I ask unanimous consent at this tint""
 that the distinguished Senator from
 Colorado [Mr. DOMINICK] may have 10
 minutes.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, the understanding is agreed
 to.
 CRASH-LOCATOR BEACONS
 Mr. DOMINICK. Mr. President, an ar-
 ticle in the Washington Post of 3 days
 ago was undoubtedly noted by many of
 my distinguished colleagues with a great
 deal of remorse. I refer to the report of
 the diary written by 16-year-old Carla
 Corbus and her mother, whose remains
 were found almost 6 months after their
 plane went down in the mountains of
 California. I only hope the top echelon
 of the Federal Aviation Administration,
 who have consistently refused to require
 installation of crash-locator beacons in
 private aircraft, will take note of this
 tragic incident.                -
 At this point, Mr. President, I would
 like to recapitulate on some of the points
 I have brought out in previous state-
 ments urging requirement of crash-loca-
 tor beacons. On August 7, in this Cham-
 ber, I pointed out the number of fatalities
 resulting from general -aviation acci-
 dents, noting that 53 percent of these
 fatalities have resulted from crashes oc-
 curring more than 5 miles from an air-
 port-only 20 percent of the total gen-
 eral aviation accidents.
 The costs incurred in searching for
 lost aircraft have been tremendous-
 $59,224,142 for search and rescue mis-
 sions flown by the Air Force alone in fis-
 cal 1966. I am sure no one will argue.the
 justification of using taxpayers' funds
 for these missions, but I do question the
 refusal of the FAA to take such an urg-
 ently needed step to reduce the hazards
 and the expense of conducting searches
 for missing aircraft. And, as so tragically
 illustrated by the report of 3 days ago,
 crash-locator beacons would most as-
 suredly save lives.
 Just 2 months ago, a plane crash in the -
 Colorado mountains was the object of
 a weeklong  search  by  the  Civil  Air
 Patrol and private citizens. I reported
 in detail to the Senate on this incident
 in a statement August 18. In this case,
 there may not have been survivors of the
 crash-a question which will never be
 answered. Nevertheless, a full week was
 spent by ground and air units before
 the wreckage was finally found, and with
