 MOSCOW TEST-BAN TALKS
 Khrushchev's decision to
 attend the 15 July opening of
 the talks on a nuclear test
 ban reflects the importance
 the USSR attaches to these ne-
 gotiations.                              His decision was
 publicized on the eve of the
 talks after Moscow had made a
 series of gestures designed to
 create a favorable atmosphere
 for the Harriman-Hailsham mis-
 sion.   Since the talks began,
 Moscow has maintained strict
 secrecy on the details of the
 discussions.   The Soviet press,
 however, has front-paged the
 brief daily communiques noting
 the "favorable atmosphere" at
 the conference table.
 Prior to the opening of
 the talks the Soviet press car-
 ried a spate of articles pegged
 to the negotiations.   The tone
 of this press commentary was
 generally optimistic, although
 the authors issued the usual
 warnings about "certain circles,"
 particularly in West Germany
 and the Pentagon, which seek to
 obstruct agreement.
 In his 8 July talk with
 Belgian Foreign Minister Spaak,
 Khrushchev conveyed the impres-
 sion to the former NATO secre-
 tary general that Moscow is not
 making agreement on a partial
 test ban contingent on the
 simultaneous signing of a NATO -
 Warsaw Pact nonaggression treaty.
 Spaak told the NATO Council
 on 12 July that while the Soviet
 leader mentioned a nonaggres-
 sion treaty, "it did not seem
 to be of particular importance"
 to him.   Spaak stated that al-
 though Khrushchev favored the
 The Communist World
 "idea," he was not as enthusias-
 tic as Spaak had expected he
 would be.
 Spaak further noted that
 the subject of disarmament was
 the "most positive part" of the
 conversation.   According to
 Spaak, Khrushchev appeared to
 think it would be possible to
 conclude a partial test-ban
 agreement which excluded under-
 ground testing.
 The impressions Spaak re-
 ceived appear to be supported
 by an article in the 13 July
 Moscow News, the Soviet English-
 anguage weekly.   According to
 Ambassador Kohler, the article--
 by E. Fyodorov, a former mem-
 ber of the Soviet delegation
 to the US-UK-USSR talks on a
 test ban in Geneva--makes
 "clearer than any statement
 heretofore" that Moscow has
 dropped its previous insistence
 that a moratorium on under-
 ground testing accompany a
 partial test-ban accord and
 that Soviet leaders do not in-
 tend to insist on the simulta-
 neous signing of a nonaggres-
 sion pact and a partial test-
 ban agreement.
 The US ambassador noted
 that Fyodorov focused on the
 test-ban issue and treated the
 nonaggression issue "casually"
 as another proposal which would
 "really make it possible to
 lessen international tension."
 Fyodorov argued that Khru-
 shchev's 2 July proposal would
 ban "all tests which can be
 detected without the slightest
 doubt."

 SECRET         W
 Despite the increasingly
 virulent and direct insults and
 accusations from each party in
 public, the secret Sino-Soviet
 talks continue.  During the
 two weeks since the talks started
 a distinct pattern has emerged:
 four days of meetings a week
 are spaced out by three days
 in which  the delegations work
 individually.  The Chinese
 delegation has gone to the Chi-
 nese Embassy on each of these
 days of recess, apparently to
 report to, and receive instruc-
 tions from, Peiping.
 Since a complete deadlock
 has clearly developed in the
 talks, their continuation indi-
 cates the importance each side
 attaches to not being the party
 responsible for shattering this
 last thin appearance of "unity."
 Each side continues, however, to
 make it appear that the other is
 bent on disrupting the unity.
 The Soviet central committee
 letter of 14 July pointedly noted
 that the "CCP representatives at
 the meeting continue to aggravate
 the situation."  The 13 July
 People's Daily: editorial, Pei-
 ping s first and to date only
 comment on the talks, accused
 the Soviets of closing out the
 negotiations before they even
 started by "categorically re-
 jecting" the views offered in
 the 14 June Chinese letter and
 stated "with heavy heart" that
 the talks have not been con-
 ducted calmly with a view to
 easing relations.
 The Soviet party, while
 still unwilling to take the
 first step in formalizing the
 open rupture in their relations,
 apparently has decided to try
 to provoke the Chinese into
 this action.   Its 14 July letter
 was the harshest possible con-
 demnation short of a formal
 break in relations.  Directly
 accusing the Chinese leaders of
 virtually every major sin in
 the Communist moral code, the
 letter frankly deserted Marxist
 argumentation in favor of a
 strongly emotional appeal built
 upon distortions of Chinese
 positions.
 The Chinese appear willing
 to face the consequences of a
 break if the Soviets cause it,
 but they seem to feel that a
 continuation of the present
 situation is in their favor.
 Their reiteration in the 13 July
 editorial that further bilateral
 talks could be held if one session
 failed to resolve differences
 suggests that they may be attempt-
 ing in the talks to get the So-
 viet party to agree to hold.
 talks at some future but unspeci-
 fied date, perhaps in Peiping.

 The editorial went so far as to
 assert that if differences can-
 not be resolved this year, "they
 can wait until next year."
 The Soviet party may be
 preparing further actions de-
 signed to demonstrate Chinese
 isolation and to,pre-empt a
 probable Chinese demand for an
 international Communist meeting
 similar to those held in 1957
 and 1960.  The USSR clearly
 does not want another meeting
 that would give the Chinese a
 platform for polemical attacks,
 but ; a.t might sponsor one ' of

 The Communist World
 HANOI SHIFTS TOWARD PEIPING IN SINO-SOVIET DISPUTE
 Propelled by a combination
 of external and internal pres-
 sures, North Vietnam is apparently
 discarding its pose of neutrality
 in the Sino-Soviet conflict and
 moving more openly to Peiping's
 side.   The July issue of its
 party journal contains what is
 for Hanoi a very strong attack
 on Khrushchev's policies.   It
 was studded with Chinese formula-
 tions and has been followed by a
 comthentary in Hanoi's party news-
 paper endorsing Chinese Communist
 and North Korean condemnations of
 the recent pro-Soviet World
 Women's Congress in Moscow.
 The North Vietnamese have
 also joined North Korea in openly
 attacking the validity of Mos-
 cow-ordered economic specializa-
 tion within the bloc.   In a re-
 cently translated 18 May speech,
 militant party first secretary
 Le Duan asserted Hanoi's inten-
 tion to develop an all-round
 economy based on heavy industry
 and go it alone, if necessary,
 in achieving this goal. Duan
 flatly rejected a suggestion
 apparently made by the USSR
 that North Vietnam should "trans-
 form its economy into a rural
 area of the socialist camp" along
 the lines of Moscow's "Asian
 Socialist Republics."  Others of
 Duan's remarks suggest that Hanoi
 has reached the point where it
 is willing to countenance what-
 ever Soviet economic pressure
 might result from North Vietnam-
 ese support of Chinese positions.
 have probably been the strongest
 factor in forcing Hanoi off the
 fence.   It clearly fears that
 any Soviet-US political agree-
 ments (as, for example, a nuclear
 test ban) would seriously under-
 cut external Communist support
 of the Viet Cong insurrection
 in South Vietnam--the success
 of which is a prime national ob-
 jective for Hanoi.   With South
 Vietnam doubtless in mind, the
 party journal denounced Commu-
 nistsso cowed by the fear of nu-
 clear war that they will not go
 all-out in conflicts where the
 US chooses to use only conven-
 tional weapons.
 Hanoi's shift toward the
 Chinese probably also reflects
 a growth in the influence of the
 extremist wing of North Vietnam-
 ese party leaders.  Possibly en-
 couraged by Chinese pressure,
 the pro-Peiping views of this
 faction have become increasingly
 open during the last few months,
 while the wing of the party that
 is inclined to favor Soviet views
 has largely fallen silent.
 The North Vietnamese have
 traditionally demonstrated a
 strong concern over the potentially
 dire effects of a bloc split on
 world communism, and such fears
 doubtless continue to play a
 major role in  their thinking.
 They have always shown a pench-
 ant                                                            for  temperate language, and
 it is likely that the tones of
 their propaganda on the dispute
 will remain less harsh than North
 Moscow's recent moves to-
 ward apparent closer cooperation
 and partial detente with the US
 Korea's blatantl    ro-Chinese
 comments.

 China's early grain harvest
 may be even smaller than the
 poor early crop brought in last
 year. However, the early har-
 vest normally accounts for only
 a fourth of total grain produc-
 tion, and the final level of
 the 1963 harvest will depend on
 weather conditions during the
 remainder of the growing season.
 Peiping's earlier optimism prob-
 ably has been dimmed by the bad
 weather over the past two months,
 but it is not likely to make any
 such admission as long as the
 Sino-Soviet talks in Moscow
 continue.
 Since last fall Communist
 China has suffered periods of
 severe cold over large areas,
 prolonged drought in the south,
 and unseasonal heavy rains in
 the east and central regions.
 Prospects for the early rice
 crop, which accounts for about
 half the early grain harvest, are
 worse than last year.   Drought
 conditions reduced both acreage
 and yield in most of Kwangtung,
 Fukien, Yunnan, Kweichow, and
 southern Hunan.   June rains in
 Fukien were probably too late to
 benefit the early rice crop.
 Along the Yangtze River in
 central China, floods in April
 and May impeded transplanting,
 and there were frequent reports
 of seed rot and insect damage.
 Conditions appear more favorable
 in the important rice-producing
 areas of the Szechwan Basin.
 The winter wheat crop now
 being harvested is not likely
 to be much larger than last
 year's, although moisture con-
 ditions have been more favorable.
 The acreage involved is probably
 abnormally low again this year,
 and damage from unseasonal cold
 reportedly extended as far south
 as northern Anhwei.  Heavy rain-
 fall caused severe damage to the
 wheat in north, central, and
 east China and in large areas
 of Honan. The regime expects
 only a "fair" crop in Shantung
 but a relatively good one in
 Szechwan.-

 SECRET               The Communist World
 The Chinese leaders apparently
 are attempting to apply even stiffer
 controls than those under which
 writers must now suffer.   Concerned
 that the more temperate approach to
 society's problems instituted after
 the collapse of the "great leap for-
 ward" in 1960 has reduced militancy
 and revolutionary elan in the coun-
 try, the regime for several months
 has been telling writers that they
 should be propagating its ideologi-
 cal viewpoints more fervently.
 This was the central theme of
 a national cultural conference this
 spring, at which Chou En-lai and
 other speakers demanded of the writ-
 ers that they so infuse their work
 with ideological content that it
 will play a militant role in the
 "class struggle" under way both at
 home and abroad.
 World Communist ideological
 problems were a major topic at the
 conference.   The "degeneration" that
 Peiping finds in "world socialist"
 literature was held up itm ridicule and
 severely condemned.   Chinese writers
 were told not only to keep bourgeois
 and revisionist "nonsense" out of
 their work but to step up their at-
 tacks on "modern revisionism," the
 Chinese term for Soviet ideological
 and cultural viewpoints.
 The conference also demonstrated
 the regime's acute sensitivity to
 China's disastrous economic situa-
 tion.   In describing the domestic
 scene, writers are to soft-pedal the
 regime's material accomplishments
 and not to stress, for example, how
 well everybody eats under the com-
 mune system.   Instead they are to
 emphasize the social evils that
 existed in pre-Communist society,
 the current dangers of capitalist
 and bourgeois influences in so-
 ciety, and the bright future ahead.
 Chinese writers have not only
 the content of their work prescribed
 for them, but the style as well.
 Thus they have been enjoined to em-
 ulate the "lively, fresh, and vig-
 orous" writing of Mao Tse-tung
 rather than strive for high liter-
 ary quality or original style. Ex-
 amples of bad and good styles of
 poetry were recently cited by Tao
 Chu, a dynamic and colorful re-
 gional boss.  Tao criticized people
 who found beauty in the lines, "As
 the music fades, the player van-
 ishes, leaving only a few green
 peaks  in the river."  He asked the
 writers to compare these "sterile
 lines",rwith Mao's style:  ' "The
 tall peaks tower above, the red
 flag flutters in the wind."
 The new restrictive policies
 are rapidly being imposed.   Pei-
 ping's daily for intellectuals an-
 nounced on 9 June that it was sus-
 pending publication of its regular
 literary feature page because of
 its ideological shortcomings.
 In justification of its further
 tightening of literary discipline,
 the regime has accused some writers of
 insufficient loyalty to Peiping's
 brand of socialism.   This may re-
 flect the existence of underground
 and unpublished writings, since no
 literature remotely critical of the
 regime has appeared in print since
 the  short-lived Hundred Flowers move-
 ment of 1957. For most Chinese  writ-
 ers, already  docile and well-disci-
 plined propagandists, the new guide-
 lines, while useful for laying bare
 the latest zigzag in propaganda pol-
 icy,  will serve chiefly to throttle

 The USSR's "sympathetic"
 response to an Indonesian re-
 quest to adjust annual debt pay-
 ments appears to have taken the
 form of a 50-percent reduction
 rather than the complete mora-
 torium requested.  At the same
 time, however, the USSR agreed
 to permit Djakarta to import,
 on credit, Soviet goods normally
 paid for on receipt.   Transac-
 tions under this plan will be
 financed from the $40 million
 remaining unobligated under the
 $250-million line of credit made
 available in 1960.
 Heretofore,  Indonesia has
 accrued some funds to meet its
 debt obligation to Moscow by
 limiting its imports from and
 expanding its exports to the
 USSR.  Now, under the new credit
 arrangement, Indonesia probably
 can meet /its repayment obliga-
 tion out of current exports to
 the USSR without a drain on its
 cash reserves.   It may also try
 to postpone a financial.crisis
 by relying on the USSR for some
 goods it now buys from other
 suppliers for cash.
 It is not yet clear that
 Indonesia's other Communist cred-
 itors will follow the Soviet
 lead.
 The total
 Indonesian debt to the bloc now
 stands at about $950 million,
 Indonesia now owes the USSR
 about $725 million and other bloc
 countries and China about $230
 million.   The schedule under
 the original credit terms called
 for payments of about $75 mil-
 lion a year in 1963 and 1964,
 the Soviet  share amounting to
 just over half the payments in
 each year.
 In responding to Indonesia's
 request, Moscow apparently had
 to balance its desire for repay-
 ment according to schedule--
 in order to avoid complaints
 from other aid recipients--
 against its recognition that
 the large quantities of arms
 urged on Indonesia had been far
 beyond Djakarta's capacity to
 pay.
 For its part,  Indonesia,
 which had blindly accepted
 accelerated deliveries of arms
 during the West Irian crisis,
 has since attempted to restrict
 Soviet military deliveries. The
 emphasis now is placed on train-
 ing in the use of military equip-
 ment already in Indonesia and on
 spare parts to maintain such
 equipment.

 KIM GAINS IN SOUTH KOREAN POWER STRUGGLE
 In reshuffling major posts
 in the South Korean regime,
 junta leader Pak Chong-hui has
 concentrated power in the group
 behind former security chief
 Kim Chong-pil, and paved the way
 for Kim's return from semi-exile
 abroad.
 The most significant change
 announced on 12 July was the
 appointment of Kim Hyong-uk, one
 of Kim Chong-pills strongest
 supporters, as director of the
 South Korean Central Intelligence
 Agency.
 The shifting of
 another Kim Chong-pil stalwart,
 Chang Kyong-sun, to the chairman-
 ship of the steering committee
 of the Supreme Council for
 National Reconstruction places
 two hard-headed, ambitious
 men with an anti-American bias
 in key positions.
 Kim's followers, who advo-
 cate authoritarian and repressive
 measures to keep the junta in
 power, have exerted increasing
 pressure for his return.  The
 way is now clear for Pak to bring
 back his former right-hand man
 at any opportune time.
 Pak and Kim share a belief
 in the need for strong measures
 but Pak has been restrained by
 concern over possible adverse
 American reaction.
 Civilian opponents of mili-
 tary rule are likely to inter-
 pret the rising influence of
 Kim Chong-pills faction as proof
 that the regime intends to rig
 the elections, if they are held
 at all.  This may stimulate
 moves toward opposition unity.
 Three civilian parties announced
 on 1.5 July that they were merging
 to oppose Pak's presidential
 candidacy.   They might seek the
 support of military elements
 hostile to Kim Chong-pil.

 BUDDHISTS TO MOUNT PRESSURE IN SOUTH VIETNAM
 A decision by Buddhist
 leaders to step up pressure on
 the government may have the
 result of intensifying efforts
 by various groups within the
 government to overthrow Presi-
 dent Diem.   In announcing this
 decision, the Buddhists charged
 that the government had failed
 to honor its 16 June agreement
 to end religious discrimination.
 They asserted that intimidation
 of monks in the provinces was
 continuing and that the terms
 of the agreement were not being
 extended equally to all Buddhist
 sects.
 Public demonstrations re-
 sumed on 16 July with a gather-
 ing of monks before the American
 ambassador's residence in Saigon.
 The demonstrators  appealed for
 "free world and US" intervention
 and claimed that American weap-
 ons were being used to suppress
 Buddhism.   Buddhist plans al-
 legedly include further hunger
 strikes and self-sacrifices by
 burning or disembowelment.
 A number of monks and nuns,
 including the mother of a rank-
 ing South Vietnamese scientist
 and ambassador, are said to
 have volunteered for suicide.
 Diem apparently feels,
 with some justification, that
 continuing Buddhist agitation
 is aimed at forcing a change of
 government.   There are signs
 that he may react forcefully,
 ordering police to curb demon-
 strations, to interfere with
 suicide attempts, or to make
 arrests if suicides or disorders
 occur.   Ambassador Nolting has
 reported that Diem seems tired,
 resentful of what he regards
 as misrepresentations and cal-
 umnies                                                                     against his regime,
 and torn by conflicting pres-
 sures and advice on handling
 the Buddhist issue.

 DEVELOPMENTS IN LAOS
 Political and military
 sparring continues between the
 Communist and anti-Communist
 factions.   Discussions in
 Vientiane between representa-
 tives of the two groups remain
 snagged on security arrange-
 ments for projected talks at
 the Plaine des Jarres airfield
 between Premier Souvanna and
 Pathet Lao leader Souphannou-
 vong.               While some compromise
 agreement on this aspect may
 be worked out, the intransi-
 gent attitude shown by the
 Pathet Lao in these advance
 talks provides little room for
 optimism over chances for a
 wider negotiated settlement.
 In demanding withdrawal of
 rightist troops from the en-
 virons of the Plaine des
 Jarres airfield as a prereq-
 uisite               for- talks there, the
 Pathet Lao are aiming at one
 of their foremost objectives:
 the cutting off of rightist
 military and supply support for
 Souvanna's beleaguered neutral-
 ist forces..
 Military action for the
 past several weeks has been
 light, consisting primarily of
 sporadic artillery duels in
 the Plaine des Jarres area.
 There are signs, however, of
 continuing preparations by the
 Communist forces for increased
 offensive action.  There has
 been persistent convoy activity
 along the main roads feeding
 into Laos from North Vietnam.
 North Vietnam's shift toward
 Peiping in the ideological dis-
 pute with Moscow could portend
 a more aggressive role in Laos--
 and, via the eastern corridor
 area of Laos, in South Vietnam
 as well.
 The rightist
 and neutralist
 factions, meanwhile, are attempt-
 ing to strengthen
 their
 defenses.
 While backstopping
 the
 neutral-
 ists in the Plaine
 des
 Jarres
 remains a priority task, General
 Phoumi seems alert to the danger
 of overcommitting his forces
 in that area to the detriment
 of defense of southern Laos where
 a build-up of Pathet Lao and
 North Vietnamese forces continues.
 The key towns of Attopeu and
 Saravane.particularl  are under
 Communist threat.
 Another important effort
 under way is the rehabilitation
 of Souvanna's neutralist mili-
 tary establishment, which has
 been seriously weakened by long-
 standing supply problems and
 inefficient organization.
 Souvanna, in consultation with
 General Phoumi, recently estab-
 lished a special staff in
 Vientiane to coordinate all
 aid to the neutralist forces.
 Kong Le's expected departure
 abroad for medical treatment may
 facilitate reform measures con-
 templated by this new staff under
 the leadership of General Amkha,
 a professional officer of long
 experience.   Kong Le, although
 a symbol of neutralist resist-
 ance to Communist pressure, has
 shown serious limitations as
 a senior commander.

 Iraq:   The Baathist regime

 its policy of reprisal against

 Six Christians with Com-

 COMMON MARKET DEVELOPMENTS
 The agreement to open formal
 contacts with Britain reached by
 the Common Market Council at its
 10-11 July meeting has raised cau-
 tious hopes that progress may be
 resuming within the community.
 There is no expectation. that the
 agreement will lead to early talks
 on Britain's actual membership,
 but it does remove a source of
 friction which had become a reason
 --as well as an excuse--for delay-
 ing decisions on other issues.
 Both the French and the "other
 five" appear to have given ground
 in reaching the compromise to con-
 sult with the British,in quarterly
 seven-nation meetings of the (West-
 ern                  European  Union (WEU) .   These
 meetings will be outside the com-
 munity's institutional framework
 and far less frequent than the
 !'five" had wanted.   However, it is
 apparently the understood purpose
 of these meetings "to prevent a
 widening of the gap between the UK
 and the EEC."  The "European eco-
 nomic situation" will be a perma-
 nent agenda item, and when it comes
 up for discussion the EEC Commis-
 sion will participate.
 How much practical effect
 these arrangements will have will
 depend--as the US mission has ob-
 served--on how much both sides put
 into them.   Neither Macmillan nor
 any possible Conservative successor
 appears in position to undertake
 a major European initiative during
 the term of the present Parliament,
 and Britain's Labor Party leader-
 ship remains generally cool toward
 the EEC. Among the Common Market
 countries, even Britain's most
 ardent friends appear to anticipate
 no more than a holding operation.
 The compromise on Britain is
 primarily significant therefore as
 additional evidence that, despite
 its serious problems, the com-
 munity may be recovering some of
 the momentum it lost when the UK-
 EEC accession talks collapsed in
 January.   On 1 July the member
 countries effected without diffi-
 culty another of the periodic tar-
 iff adjustments which have brought
 the EEC approximately two thirds
 of the way toward  a full customs
 union--well ahead of the treaty
 schedule.  Moreover, the proposals
 recently advanced by the EEC Com-
 mission for coordinating national
 monetary, fiscal, and budgetary
 policies are of considerable im-
 portance and prospects are favor-
 able for their early approval.
 While the agricultural problem con-
 tinues to be vexing, the EEC Com-
 mission is at least showing signs
 of attempting to find a "community
 solution"--as the EEC treaty in-
 tended it to do.
 These limited gains, however,
 have not yet made the EEC an easy
 entity to deal with--as the effort
 to organize the Kennedy Round of
 tariff negotiations continues to
 demonstrate.   In recognition of
 the EEC's difficulties over farm
 policy, the talks on how to or-
 ganize the bargaining on freer
 trade in agricultural products have
 been postponed until fall.   A de-
 fault is also in prospect with re-
 gard to agreement on the tariff
 negotiating plan for trade in the
 industrial sector for which the
 GATT ministerial meeting last May
 fixed a 1 August deadline.   The
 EEC has seemed to feel under no
 great pressure to keep to this sched-
 ule,  and while comparatively more
 forthcoming in recent weeks, its
 views on such substantive issues     25X1
 as the old tariff disparities ques-
 tion still sharply diverge from those
 of the US.

 Western Hemisphere
 Dissatisfaction among cer-
 tain military leaders with
 Dominican President Juan Bosch
 seems to be increasing, and he,
 also may be heading for a colli-
 sion with his most dangerous
 potential political opponent.
 Bosch's current diffi-
 culties began on 9 July, when
 leaders of his Dominican Re-
 volutionary Party (PRD) in the
 Senate initiated., with biparti-
 san support, a bill which
 would remove Bosch's most feared
 opponent, Antonio Imbert, and
 Luis Amiama Tio--the only sur-
 vivors of the group that assas-
 sinated Trujillo--from the po-
 lice general start.   The bill
 would also severely reduce the
 powers of police chief Belisario
 Peguero, an Imbert crony.  Bosch
 has hitherto avoided a direct
 attempt to curb Imbert's in-
 fluence on the police, but PRD
 congressional leaders, apparently
 encouraged by aggressive party
 president Angel Miolan, decided
 to force the issue.
 The bill could provoke a
 reaction against Bosch by Imbert
 and his friends.   Bosch himself
 seems to fear this since he is
 lukewarm toward the bill, which
 would give effect to the provi-
 sion of the new constitution
 which makes him commander-in-
 chief of the police.  He is
 probably also piqued at Con-
 gress' invasion of his decision-
 making domain.  He probably
 distrusts the intentions of
 Miolan and his followers.
 Miolan, a would-be successor to
 Bosch, would like to establish
 the PRD permanently as the
 dominant political force in
 the country.
 The tension generated by
 the police bill has been
 heightened by coup rumors re-
 sulting from a private meeting
 of Bosch with leaders of the
 armed forces at their request
 on 13 July.
 The public
 clamor arising from the inci-
 dent compelled General Victor
 Elby Vinas Roman, minister of
 the armed forces, to call a
 press conference to deny ru-
 mors of military plotting.
 US Embassy officials at
 Santo Domingo consider these
 rumors highly exaggerated,
 but the situation is uneasy.
 In addition to the potential
 threat to Bosch from an angry
 Imbert, and from extreme anti-
 Communists in the armed forces,
 restlessness among certain mili-
 tary leaders has increased as
 a result of recent congressional
 discussion of moves to end
 widespread corruption in the
 armed forces.
 Prolongation or an increase
 in these stresses might push
 Bosch, who is inclined to over-
 react to pressure, to take some
 precipitate action.  He might
 even consider resigning if faced
 with an ultimatum by the armed
 forces.

 Although Premier Jagan and

 agreement, the British Government
 would have to settle outstanding
 issues on its own authority.

 Sandys also said he intended
 to reconvene a conference on the
 colony's future constitution and
 independence date not later than
 October.   Burnham told the consul
 general a few days ago he expected
 that the talks would achieve
 nothing beyond convincing London
 of the necessity of imposing a
 referendum on proportional repre-
 sentation.   Jagan's refusal to
 concede opposition demands for
 proportional representation was
 the central reason for the break-
 up of the previous conference
 last November.  Governor Grey

 is.

 MILITARY TAKEOVER IN ECUADOR
 A military junta took over
 the government of Ecuador in a
 near-bloodless coup on 11 July,
 sending President Arosemena and
 Vice President Varea into exile.
 Within a few days, the
 junta was in complete control of
 the country.   It has outlawed
 the Communist Party and rounded
 up about 150 Communists and
 leftist extremists.  Appointment
 of a mixed military-civilian
 cabinet is nearly complete and
 the junta has issued a call for
 a constituent assembly to approve
 a new and "more liberal" con-
 stitution.  The junta has pub-
 licly declared its intention to
 return the nation to an elected
 civilian government in less
 than two years.
 Reactions to the new junta
 range from enthusiastic approval
 by parties of the right and
 center to guarded acceptance by
 the parties of the democratic
 left.  Communists and leftist
 extremists stated their opposi-
 tion immediately after the coup,
 but their efforts to organize
 demonstrations and a general
 strike have been thwarted.
 According to press reports,
 Pedro Saad, secretary general
 of the Communist Party (PCE),
 and other high ranking PCE
 officials were arrested on 15
 July.  An "activist" faction is
 now in control of the PCE, al-
 though the leaders are in hid-
 ing, and it may attempt terror-
 ist acts and possibly guerrilla-
 type action.  The armed forces
 can contain and eventually de-
 stroy any guerrilla units the
 extremists are presently capable
 of putting into action, but con-
 trol of urban terrorism will
 be a continuing problem.
 The members of the new
 junta disclaim any desire for
 personal political aggrandize-
 ment.  According to the US am-
 bassador, however, several of
 the known members of the new
 government are opportunists,
 and may in time fall out with
 their less venal colleagues.
 With the exception of'
 Venezuela and Costa Rica, most
 Latin American nations seem to
 be ready to recognize the new
 government.

 ARGENTINE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE ILLIA
 Dr. Arturo Umberto Illia is
 the leading candidate for elec-
 tion by the presidential electors
 .on 31 July.  Illia (pronounced
 Eel-yee-ah)   is highly respected
 for  ibis political integrity both
 by his own People's Radical Civic
 Union (UCRP) and by opposition
 party leaders.
 Until the campaign for the
 7 July general elections, Illia
 had little national standing,
 having concentrated his political
 activities for the past 35 years
 in central Cordoba Province.
 He came into national prominence
 in the 18 March 1962 elections,
 when he was the only UCRP candi-
 date to win a gubernatorial post.
 Illia, a practicing physi-
 cian, was born in 1900 in
 Pergamino, Province of Buenos
 Aires
 jt11ia has been in local
 politics since 1936.   In 1948
 he was elected a national deputy,
 serving until 1952.   He was
 acting as a member of the UCRP
 national committee when on 10
 March 1963 a national assembly
 of party leaders elected him
 UCRP presidential candidate.
 Illia adheres closely to
 the traditional nationalistic
 Radical party platform with,
 some modifications.   He has
 long been an advocate of the
 decentralization of political
 power and responsibility.   Up-
 holding the UCRP platform, Illia
 advocates  annulling the petroleum
 contracts--many with US companies--
 which ex-President Frondizi
 negotiated to help develop oil
 resources.
 Illia admires the US, and
 has stated publicly on at least
 one occasion that he considers
 the US "truly democratic."  He
 felt that US policy was wrong
 in forcing Cuba out of the OAS
 --believing Castro wanted to
 escape the bonds of inter-
 American treaties--but believes
 the October 1962 crisis was a
 victory for the free world.   He
 believes that Communism must be
 fought with ideas and deeds,
 and has stated publicly that
 as president he would permit
 the Argentine Communist Party
 to operate legally.
 Illia has consistently
 worked for reunification of the
 UCRP and the Intransigent Rad-
 ical Civic Union (UCRI), which
 split in 1957 over the issue of
 Frondizi.'s leadership.   UCRI
 leaders have already made over-
 tures for cooperation looking
 to unification of the two parties.
