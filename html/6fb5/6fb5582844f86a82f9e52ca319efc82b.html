 [Text]  Dear Mr Shiranami Toten:  We have long admired your fame from afar,.
 but have not had the occasion to meet you.  Hearing about you far away, one
 cannot but be inspired.
 You were most kind to Mr Huang.   During his lifetime, you rendered him
 moral support.  Now that he is dead, you mourn him-with tears.  For his
 coming funeral, you have travelled 10,000 li to attend the burial.  Your
 friendship reaches to the sun and the moon; your sincerity moves the gods.
 What you do is rare in the world and unheralded at all times.   We are stu-
 dents of Hunan.                       We have studied poetry and the classics, and we hold am-
 bitions in our heart.  We wish to meet you and hear your instructions.  We
 hope you will grant us the opportunity.

 [Text]  The national strength is weak; the martial arts are not flourish-
 ing.  The physical quality of the nation becomes ever more debilitated.
 This is a distressing situation.  As those advocating physical. education do
 not reach the source, their effort has produced no result over a long period
 of time.  Not only has there been no improvement, but the weakness worsens.
 Hitting the mark and reaching far are external matters, the results.  Full-
 ness in physical strength is internal, the cause.  When the body is not
 firm, one is afraid of arms.  How can one hit the mark?  And how can one
 reach far?  Firmness comes from tempering; tempering comes from awareness.
 It isn't that today's physical education advocates do not think of all kinds
 of means, yet they produce no result.  It is because the external force
 cannot stimulate the mind.  They do not know the true meaning of physical
 education.  When it comes to the value of physical education, its effect,
 or where to start, they are in a fog.  No wonder they produce no result.
 To make physical education effective, we must promote subjective awareness.
 Once there is awareness, the particulars of physical education will become
 clear without need of explanation, and the effect of hitting the mark and
 reaching far will appear without seeking.   I deeply feel the importance of
 physical education, but regret the improper approach of the advocates.  I
 know that there are many who feel like I do.  Setting aside my diffidence,
 I would like to present my views for discussion.  What I say is not all
 practical, and maybe much is mere empty words and ideals.   I do not wish
 to deceive you.   Should you favor me with your thoughts and instructions,
 I shall be humbly grateful.
 I.   Explanation of Physical Education
 Ever since the beginning of mankind, be they wise or obtuse, there has
 been no one who does not protect his own life.  Therefore, the ferns of the
 western hills were eaten when hungry; the plums on top of the well were
 swallowed.  Using,timber for shelter and pelts for clothes--it was in-
 stinctive, without knowing the reasons.  But it was not refined.  The sages
 appeared.   Then, there were rites, and there was order in daily living.
 In his private life, Confucius was serene and at peace.  He ate no spoilt

 meat. When he went shooting in the garden, spectators lined up like a wall.
 The structure of the human body is no different from the animals, and yet
 the animals do not live as long as man.  It is because the animals do not
 have order in their lives.  Man regulates his life, becoming ever more so
 with time.  Therefore, there is physcial education.  Physical education
 is the way to foster life.  Different people follow different ways.  Chuang-
 tzu learned from the cook; Confucius pursued archery and charioteering.  In
 today's civilized nations, Germany is the most advanced.  The popularity of
 fencing spreads in the entire country.  Japan has its samurai and recently,
 influenced by China, judo.  They are most impressive.  However, when we study
 their contents, they are all based on physiology, the structure of the human.
 body, the movement of the vessels and energy, the parts which develop the
 earliest, and the parts which are deficient.  Their physical education fol-
 lows such order, checking the excessive and remedying the deficient.  In
 conclusion, it is for the balanced development of the body.   Therefore,
 physical education is the way of mankind to foster life, enabling the body
 to develop in a balanced manner and according to order.
 II.  The Position of Physical Education
 Physical education supplements ethical and academic education.  Yet, vir-
 tue and wisdom both rely on the body.  Without the body, there can be neither
 virtue nor wisdom.  But there are few who are aware of it.  Some stress
 wisdom; others say virtue is the most important.  Knowledge is truly valu-
 able.  That is where man is different from animals.  Yet what is the vessel
 of knowledge?  Virtue is truly valuable.  It is order and equity among men.
 Yet what is the lodge of virtue?  The body is the vessel of knowledge and
 the lodge of virtue.  Like a cart, it carries knowledge; like a house, it
 shelters virtue.  The body is the cart to carry knowledge and the house to
 shelter virtue.  Children, upon reaching the proper age, enter elementary
 schoool.  During elementary school, the development of the body should be
 specially stressed, while the improvement of knowledge and the building of
 virtue are secondary.  Fostering and caring are major matters, while teaching
 and training are supplementary.  Today, many people are ignorant of this
 principle.  Therefore, there have been children who became sick or died as
 a result of studying.  In middle school and above, the three kinds of educa-
 tion should be equally stressed.  Today, most people incline to stress the
 academic.   In middle school years, the body is not fully developed, yet to-
 day there are less people who build it and more who destroy it.  Will it
 not suspend development?  Under the education system of China today, the
 subjects are so numerous that even adults with a strong body cannot handle
 them, let alone the young and, the weak.  It seems that the educators pur-
 posely set up such a tedius and heavy curriculum to harass the students
 in order to trample their body and sabotage their life.  Those refusing
 to accept it are punished; those with superior ability are assigned addi-
 tional books, induced by sweet words and tempted by large rewards.  Alas,
 the students seem to hate their own life and wish to destroy and sacrifice
 it!    How muddled can they be?  Man's only worry is not to have a body; there
 is no other worry.  Once the body is sound, everything else follows.  There

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 is nothing better than physical education to improve the body.  Physical
 education should be of primary importance.  Once the body is strong, one can
 advance vigorously and effectively in the academic and the ethical aspects.
 Physical education should be considered an important part of our study.
 There must be the primary and the secondary, and the beginning and the end.
 Such is the way.
 III.   The Defects.of Physical Education in the Past and What Should Be Done
 The three kinds of education should be equally stressed.  Yet scholars of
 the old days stressed the moral and the academic while ignoring the phys-
 ical.  The results were slight body and bowed head, and fragile white hands;.
 short of breath when climbing a mountain and cramped legs when crossing a
 water. Yen-tzu and Chia-sheng were short-lived; Wang Po and Lu Chao-ling
 either died young or became crippled.  They were all superior in virtue
 and wisdom.  Yet one day when the body no longer existed,. their virtue and
 wisdom perished also. That the North was powerful was because there were
 many able-bodied men.  The patriots and warriors mostly came from Liang-
 chou.  In the beginning of the Ch'ing Dynasty, Yen Hsi-chai and Li Kang-
 chu were scholars and warriors simultaneously.  Yen Hsi-chai travelled 1,000
 li to learn the skill of fencing and beat the warriors in a match.  There-
 fore he said that one must master both knowledge and martial arts.                 Ku
 Yen-nan was a Southerner, but he preferred to live in the North and liked
 horses more than boats.  These ancients are worthy of our emulation.
 With the establishment of schools, the ways of other nations have been
 adopted, and there has been some change in the customs.  Yet the educators,
 as a result of what they learned before, cannot free themselves from the old
 ways.  They seek external display only, ignoring the fundamental while pur-
 suing the details.                  Therefore, I feel that today's physical education has
 the form but not the substance.  There exist the physical education course
 and the physical education teacher, but few benefits and there is more harm
 than good.  The teacher gives the orders, and the students force themselves
 to obey.  The body follows but the mind refuses, and there is immeasurable
 mental agony.  Mental agony brings physical agony. At the end of a physical
 education session, everyone is exhausted in body and spirit.  When the food
 and drink are not clean, inorganic matter and germs enter the body and cause
 disease.  Improper lighting damages the eyesight.  Improper heights of the
 tables and chairs damage the body.   Such instances are too many to be
 enumerated.
 Then what should our students do?  The school equipment and the teachers'
 teaching are external objective matters, while we still have our internal
 subjective matters.  The mind determines all, and the body follows the
 order of the mind.   The good or the bad all depends on ourselves.  We get
 what we want.   This applies to physical education.   If we do not arouse
 ourselves, even if the external objective matters are perfect, we will not
 benefit from them.   Therefore, we must begin with our own initiative in
 physical education.

 IV.  The Effect of Physical Education
 As man is an animal, he acts.  As he is a rational animal, he always acts
 with a reason.  Why is man's action valuable?  Why is man's rational action
 valuable?  In a narrow sense, action is to make a living.  In a broad sense,
 it is to defend the nation.  Neither constitutes the principal significance.
 Action is to foster our life and please our mind.  Chu-tzu advocated respect;
 Lu-tzu urged tranquillity.  Tranquillity is inaction.  Neither is respect;
 it is also inaction.  Lao-tzu said that inaction was great; Shih-shih sought
 quietude.  Mediation was followed by the disciples of Chu and Lu.  Recently
 someone by the name of Yin-shih-tzu promoted mediation, bragging about its
 ingenuity and scorning action for being self-destructive.  That may be one
 way, but I cannot subscribe to it.  According to my opinion, action is the
 only thing in the world.
 The action of man, when regulated, is physical education.  As stated be-
 fore, the effect of physical education is the strengthening of tendons and
 bones.  I once heard that man's structure and blood vessels were determined
 at a given age and could not be changed.  Usually after age 25 there was no
 further change.  Now I know it is not so.  Man's body changes every day.
 Metabolism goes on continuously in the tissues.  Eyesight and hearing can be
 improved.  Even those 60 or 70 years old can change their physical structure.
 I also heard that it was difficult for the weak to become strong.  Now I have
 also found out that it is not so.  For those who are born strong, if they
 abuse themselves, indulging in addictions and relying on their natural
 strength, they will become weak.  As for the weak, as they are aware of
 the imperfections of their body and fearful of dying young, they are care-
 ful with themselves.  In the negative aspect, they strictly abstain from
 addictions, afraid to do damage.  In the positive aspect, they diligently
 temper themselves, remedying their deficiencies, and they become strong after
 a prolonged effort.  Therefore, those who are born strong have no need to
 congratulate themselves, and those born weak have no need to feel sorry for
 themselves.  I was born weak, but maybe Heaven wants to induce me to become
 strong.  Famous athletes in the West, such as America's Roosevelt, German's
 (Sun-t'ang), and Japan's Kano, all attained the greatest of strength from
 the weakest of bodies.  I also heard that the mental and the physical could
 not be both perfect, and that those using their mind were often deficient in.
 body, and vice versa.   Such theory is also fallacious.   It only applies to
 those who have no determination; it does not cover everyone.  Confucious
 died at age 72, and one has never heard of him suffering from ill health.
 Buddha travelled incessantly to spread the doctrines, and he also died
 at an old age.  Jesus unfortunately met with an unjust death.  Mohammad,
 with the Koran in his left hand and a sword in his right, conquered the
 world.  They were all sages of ancient times and the greatest thinkers.
 Today's Mr Wu Chih-yung is in his 70's, and he thinks he will live to 100.
 He also is a man using his mind.  WangHsiang-ch'i died when he was in his
 70's.   He was healthy and alert up until then. How can all such instances
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 be explained by the above fallacy?  In sum, physical education strengthens
 the tendons and bones; when the tendons and bones are strengthened, the
 quality of the body will change.   The weak will become strong, and the body
 and the mind will both become perfect.  It is not destiny, but man's effort.
 Not just strengthening the tendons and bones, but physical education will
 also increase knowledge.  There is a recent saying:  Civilize the spirit;
 barbarize the body.  It is an apt statement.  To civilize the spirit, the
 body must first be barbarized.    Once the body is barbarized, civilized
 spirit follows.  Knowledge is to understand the things in the world and ren-
 der judgment.  This requires physical effort.               Direct observation depends
 on the ears and eyes; thinking depends on the brain.  The ears and eyes and
 the brain are parts of the body.  Only when the body is sound will knowledge
 become perfect.  Therefore, one can say that knowledge is acquired indirectly
 through physical education.  There are hundreds of fields of. study today.
 Whether to study in school or by oneself, those who can handle the task are
 strong in body, and those who cannot are weak.  The realms of. the strong
 and the weak are different.
 Not just increasing knowledge, but physical education will also harmonize
 the emotions.  Emotions are very powerful in man.  The ancients controlled
 them with reason.  Thus, it was said that the master was always alert.  It
 was also said that reason controlled the mind.  Nevertheless, reason comes
 from the mind, and the mind exists in the body. The weak are often enslaved
 by their emotions and cannot extricate themselves.  The crippled are often
 unbalanced in their emotions and cannot be saved by their reason.  Only when
 the body is sound will the emotions be harmonized.  It is an immutable
 principle.  Take the following instance:  When we encounter an unpleasant-
 ness and become excited, our mind is disturbed and we cannot control our-
 selves, but.if we engage in vigorous exercises, we can immediately cleanse
 ourselves of the old concept and clarify our mind.  An instant effect is
 produced.
 Not just harmonizing the emotions, but physical education will strengthen
 our determination.  This is where the major effect of physical education lies.
 The essential point of physical education is courage, and the goal of cour-
 age, such as bravery, fearlessnes, intrepidity, and perseverance, belongs
 to the realm of determination.  Take the following instance:   Cold water
 baths will train one to be brave and fearless, as well as intrepid.  In any
 kind of exercise, one must persist steadily, leading toward perseverance.
 Long-distance running, for example, is most apparent in perseverance.  The
 strength to extract the mountain and the bearing to conquer the world were
 nothing but bravery.  The determination not to return home before killing
 Lou-lan was nothing but fearlessness.   Converting the family into the coun-
 try was nothing but intrepidity.  Passing by the door of his home three times
 without entering after an absence of 8 years was nothing but perseverance.
 All these qualities can be attributed to constant physical education.  De-
 termination is the harbinger of one's career.

 Those slight of limb are flighty in behavior; those slack of muscle are
 soft and slow in mind.  Thus the body influences the mind.  Physical educa-
 tion strengthens the tendons and bones, thereby increasing knowledge, there-
 by harmonizing the emotions, and thereby reinforcing determination,  The
 tendons and bones are our body, while knowledge, emotions, and determination
 constitute our mind.  When the body and the mind are both sound, there is
 excellence.  Therefore, physical education is the only thing to foster our
 body and please our mind.
 Exercise is the most important part of physical education.  Most of today's
 scholars dislike exercise.  There are four reasons:  One is the lack of
 awareness.  For something to materialize in one's action, there must first
 be an inclination toward it.  But even more than inclination, one must first
 have the intelligence to gain a detailed understanding of it. Understanding
 is awareness.  Most people do not know the relationship between exercise
 and themselves. Or, they may have a rough idea, but have no detailed knowl-
 edge.  Therefore, their intelligence is not activated, and their senses not
 stimulated. That some people can study science diligently is because of its.
 close relationship with themselves.  If they do not study it today, they
 will not have the means to make a living in the future.  But when it comes
 to exercise, they do not have such awareness.  This is partly because they
 do not ponder profoundly, and partly because the teachers do not know how
 to enlighten them.  Another reason is that old habits are difficult to
 change.  In China, we Shave always stressed the academic.  "Good men do not
 serve as soldiers."  Though we know that exercise is proper and that the
 nations have become strong due to exercise, the force of the old concepts
 remains strong.  Exercise, which is a new concept, is only half accepted.
 Therefore, it is not surprising. that many people do not like exercise.  The
 third reason is the lack of promotion.  This point can be further subdivided
 into two factors.  First, the so-called educators today mostly do not under-
 stand physical education.  Hearing about it but not knowing what it is, they
 also engage in physical education.  Therefore, they have neither the sin-
 cerity nor the method.  As a result, they only discourage students from
 studying it.  When a profligate talks about independence, or a drunk dis-
 cusses abstinence, naturally no one will believe them.   Second, the phys-
 ical education teachers are mostly uneducated.  Their language is so coarse
 that the listeners have to cover their ears.  They only know one skill, and
 not necessarily expert at it.  Day in and day out, they perform the me-
 chanical movements.  Anything in form only, without substance, cannot exist.
 Such is today's physical education.  The fourth reason is that the students
 think of exercise as something shameful.  I personally feel that this is
 the major.reason for disliking. exercise. As society prefers a well-dressed
 man with gentlemanly manners, it makes people feel ashamed to expose their
 arms and legs and wave them around.  Therefore, there  are those who know
 the importance of exercise and wish to exercise, but cannot do so.  Others
 can exercise in a group but not by themselves.  Still others will exercise

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 in private but not in public.  In a word, it is due to bashfulness.  The
 foregoing are the four reasons for aversion to exercise.  The first and
 fourth are subjective, and it is up to the individual.  The second and third
 are objective, and it is up to others.  A gentleman relies on himself. He
 must disregard what is up to others.
 VI.   Fewer Methods of Exercise Preferred
 Being weak, I wanted  to study the means to improve my health.  The ancients
 discussed the subject extensively.  Now the schools. have gymnasiums and
 books.  After much studying, I was not benefited.  The reason is that prac-
 tice, rather than words, is important.  If one can practice, learning a lit-
 tle bit is enough.  Tseng Wen-cheng was greatly benefited by washing his
 feet before retiring and walking 1,000 steps after a meal.  One old man was
 very healthy even at 80 years of age.  When asked, he said:  "I do not eat
 my fill."  Today, there are hundreds of exercises.  A bird needs only one
 branch in the forest to build a nest; a field mouse needs only a stomachful
 out of a-river.  We have only this one body, only so many bones and vessels.
 All the 100 methods of exercise are only for the purpose of blood circula-
 tion.  One method will serve the purpose. Thus, 99 out of the 100 methods
 can be discarded.  The eyes can see clearly if they do not see two things
 at a time, and the ears can hear clearly if they do not hear two things at
 a time.  To temper the tendons and bones with 100 methods only serve to
 disturb them, and the desired result may not follow.  What is suitable for
 different purposes is not the same as tempering one's own body.  There are
 the swinging bridge for the sailor, pole carrying for the pole-vaulter,
 games for the elementary school, and military maneuvering for the middle
 school and above.  They are for different purposes.  Exercising the tendons
 and bones will help blood circulation.  It is for tempering one's own body.
 There should be more methods when there are different purposes, but less for
 tempering one's own body.  Today's scholars often do not realize it, result-
 ing in two defects.  Those who like to exercise think the more the better.-
 To do 100 things with one body, one may not benefit at all.              In regard to
 those who do not like to exercise, when they see others possessing so many
 skills, they feel so inadequate that they may give up altogether.  More is
 not necessarily good, and less not necessarily bad.  Even the bending and
 stretching of one arm or one leg, if done regularly, it will produce a bene-
 fit.  Only when this is understood will there be improvement in physical
 education.
 VII. Important Points in Exercising
 Constancy is required in all undertakings, and this applies to exercise.
 Of two men exercising, one of them does it sporadically, while the other
 perseveres diligently.  The results will be different.  First, constancy
 in exercising will produce an interest.  The static cannot move by itself.
 There must be something to make it move.  To move is due to interest.  All'
 sciences produce interests in many aspects, and this applies to exercise
 also.   It is restful to be quiet but tiring to move.  Man usually prefers
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 leisure to effort.  If there is nothing to make him move, then his status
 and preference cannot be changed.  Interest comes from daily exercise.  It
 is best to exercise upon rising and before retiring.  It is preferable to be
 naked. Or, wear very thin clothes, because too many clothes are clumsy.
 Doing it daily will produce the concept of exercise, continuous and uninter-
 rupted.  Today's exercise is a continuation of yesterday's and the forerunner
 of tomorrow's.  It does not have to be long.  Some 30 minutes will be enough.
 By so doing, a sort of interest will naturally follow.  Secondly, constancy
 in exercising will bring happiness.  After exercising over a long period, the
 result will become apparent, and one will feel a respect for oneself.  One
 will become efficient in studying andln.building one's ethics.  One will feel
 an unlimited happiness.  All these come from constancy.  Happiness must be
 distinguished from interest.  Interest is the beginning of exercising, and
 happiness its end.  Interest comes from doing while happiness comes from the
 result.  The two are different.
 Constancy without attention will not produce results.  Like viewing flowers
 while riding a fast horse, even if one views the flowers every day, it is
 equivalent to not viewing.   Thus, full attention is required when exer-
 cising.                         One must brush aside all idle thoughts and irrelevant worries,
 and concentrate on the circulation of blood, tensing and relaxing of the
 muscles, bending of the joints, and breathing.  The movements must follow a
 rhythm, bending and stretching, advancing and retreating, all done consci-
 entiously.  According to Chu-tzu, one must concentrate on eating when eating,
 and on putting on clothes when dressing.  The same principle applies to
 exercising.
 A gentleman is civilized and docile, but this does not apply to exercising.
 One must be barbarous and solid.  Only then will one build up one's strength
 and the tendons and bones.  The method of exercising should be solid.  Being
 solid will make it substantial and easy to practice.  It is most important,
 especially for those who are beginners.
 The three important points in exercising are constancy, concentration, and
 being barbarous and solid.  There are many other points of attention, but
 these are the important ones.
 VIII.  What I Have Gained Through Exercise
 I dabbled in all kinds of exercises, but it was all external tempering, with-
 out something which could be considered my own.  Thus, I extracted the good
 points of the various exercises and created a new one.  I have greatly bene-
 fited from it.  It consists of six sections:  Arms, legs, body, head, hit-
 ting, and harmonizing.  The sections are further divided into 27 steps.  It
 is called the six-section exercise, which is described below.  I hope my
 readers will correct me.

 1.   Arm exercise, sitting position
 (1) Form fists; stretch and retract in a forward movement, left and
 right alternating, three times.  Left and right alternating means when the
 left is in motion the right rests, and vice versa.
 (2) Form fists; bend elbows; make semi-circular motions by moving for-
 ward, sideways, and backward, left and right alternating, three times.
 (3) Form fists; stretch and retract in a downward motion, left and right
 together, three times.  Left and right together means both sides moving to-
 gether, not alternating.
 (4) Palms up; stretch forward, left and right alternating, three times.
 (5) Palms down; stretch forward, left and right alternating, three times.
 ?(6) Stretch fingers; bend elbows; thrust forward, left and right al-
 ternating, three times.

 (1) Hands form fists hanging downward.  Legs remain at original position;
 bend forward and stretch sideways, left and right alternating, three times.
 (2) Hands form fists level in front.  Legs stretch sideways; then bend
 forward.  Position may change when stretching; use toes when tending; touch
 heels with buttocks; left and right alternating, three times.
 (3) Hands form fists hanging downward.  Legs advance and  lift, left and
 right alternating, three times.

 [Text]  Please hear a few words from me.
 What is your biggest disadvantage?  Do you know?  It is as described in
 the popular saying:  You'can say it but you cannot write it; what is written
 you cannot understand; given the figures, you cannot compute them.  We are
 all human beings, but are you not similar to wood and stone?  Therefore,
 you must seek some knowledge, and learn to read and write a little and do
 some arithmetic.  Only then will it be advantageous.  But then, you are
 working people.  You have to work, and you have no one to teach you.  How
 can you do it?  There is an excellent way.  Our First Normal School has
 started an evening school, specially for you workers.  Monday through Fri-
 day, there will be 2 hours every evening.  We teach letter writing and
 accounting, which are needed  by you constantly.  We will issue you the
 lecture notes, free of charge.  Evening school will not interfere with your
 work.  Those who wish to attend please enroll promptly at the registry of-
 fice of the normal school within a week.  Please think why we are doing this?
 It is only because we think of your difficulties and hope you will be able
 to write and calculate.  So, why not enroll as soon as possible and come to
 the lectures?  Some people are worried about the situation and afraid of
 violating the curfew.  We can guarantee you on this point.  When you attend
 school, we will issue you a lecture card.  When stopped by. the soldiers or
 police, all you have to do is to say that you are a student of the evening
 school of the normal school.  Should you run into any difficulty, I will serve
 as your guarantor.  Please set your mind at ease on this point.  Please come

 INAUGURAL STATEMENT OF 'HSIANG-CHIANG P'ING-LUN'
 14 July 1919
 [Text]  With the rising roar of the "world revolution" and the. striking
 progress of the "emancipation of mankind" movement, we must change our old
 concepts of the issues which we have never doubted before, the methods which
 we have never adopted before, and the words which we have always been afraid
 to utter.  We doubt what we have never before doubted.  We adopt what we
 have never before adopted.  We are no longer afraid.  Such trend cannot be
 blocked by any force, and it cannot but influence people, regardless of who
 they are.
 What is the biggest issue in the world?  The issue of food is the biggest.
 What force. is the strongest?  The force of mass unity is the strongest.  What
 should not be feared?  Fear neither Heaven, nor ghosts, nor the dead, nor the
 bureaucrats, nor the warlords, nor the capitalists.
 With the Renaissance and the emancipation of thinking, "how man should live"
 became a big issue.  When this issue was studied, the conclusion that "this
 is the way to live" and "that is not the way to live" was reached.  With
 the scholars taking the lead and the majority of the people echoing them, many
 reforms were accomplished, or almost accomplished.
 In religion, the Reformation resulted in freedom of religion.   In literature,
 the literature of the aristocrats, the classic literature, and the dead liter-
 ature became the literature of the people, modern literature, and living
 literature.   In politics, tyranny became parliamentarism, and restricted
 election became unrestricted.   In society, the dark society under the tyran-
 ny of the minority class became a bright society of the free development of
 all people.   In education, there was the principle of popular education.  In
 economics, there was the principle of to each according to his labor.   In
 thinking, there was experimentalism.  Internationally, there was the inter-
 national alliance.
 In a word, all the reforms are the results of "freedom from might."  The
 fundamental ideology of the many forces opposing might is "popular-ism"

 (democracy, also known as democratic theory, people-ism, or plebeian-ism).
 The might of religion, of literature, of politics, of society, of education,
 of economics, and of thinking, and international might have not any room for
 existence. They must all be overthrown by the loud appeal of popular-ism.
 As for the means of overthrowing them, there are two theories:   One is
 violent and the other moderate.  We must make our choice between the two.
 (1) We recognize that all those exercising might are human beings, and our
 fellow creatures.  Abusing power is their unconscious error and their mis-
 fortune, resulting from contamination and harm by the old society and old
 thinking.  (2) The result of overthrowing might by force is still might.  Not
 only is it contradictory, but also ineffective.  The European war between
 the "Allies" and the "Central Powers" and China's civil war between the North
 and the South'were all instances of such.
 Therefore, according to our view, we advocate thorough study in the academic
 aspect, untrammeled by legends and superstitions, and we must spread the
 truth.  In regard to the human element, we advocate mass unity, continuing
 our "counseling movement" toward those in power, and practicing "revolution
 by appeals"--appeal for bread, appeal for freedom, and appeal for equality,
 or, "bloodless revolution."  It will not lead to any major chaos or the in-
 effective "revolution by bombs" and "bloody revolution."
 International might pressing in on us is Japan.  The various movements, such
 as student strikes, market strikes, work strikes, and boycotting are the
 effective means to handle the mighty Japan directly or indirectly.
 Hsiang-chiang is a river in the east of the Eastern hemisphere on the globe.
 Its water is clear and its flow long.  The people living on its shores and
 in its vicinity are ignorant and uninformed.  They know little of the affairs
 of the world.  They do not have an organized society.  Everyone for himself
 and scattered, they only have the narrowest self and the shortest time.
 They have never dreamed of the common life or the long-range concept.  In
 politics, they have not reached a thorough solution.  They only know private
 struggles.  Engulfed by the tidal waves of the external world, they have also
 undertaken some education, but without much effect.  The bureaucratic educat-
 ors, inflexible and stereotyped, consider the school a jail and the students
 prisoners.  They have not developed their industry.  The few useful talents
 among them acquired learning and art by studying abroad or in outside areas,
 but there is no room for them to make use of their talents.  The confining
 Tung-t'ing Lake blocks them gently.  Entrenched in tribal thinking, the
 practice the principle of Hunan's rice for Hunan's people.  Those in educa-
 tion and industry cannot tolerate those differing from them.  Their mind is
 impoverished and decadent and needs improvement, yet there is no one to
 undertake the task.  They have many young men in school, full of potential,
 yet there is no one to enlighten them with new knowledge and new art by an
 effective means.' Alas!  Hsiang-chiang, Hsiang-chiang!  Like a pillar you
 exist on this Earth!

 The opportunity has arrived!  The great tide of the world surges forward!
 The locks of Tung-t'ing Lake are moving, and opening!   The powerful new
 trend is roaring along the shores of Hsiang-chiang!   Those following it
 will live; those resisting it will die.  How to receive it?  How to spread
 it?  How to study it?  How to promulgate it?  These constitute. the most
 intimate and most important great issues of all the people of Hunan as well
 as "Hsiang-chiang" upon its birth.

 GREAT UNION OF THE PEOPLE
 21, 28 July, 4 August 1919
 [Text] (I)
 The state is at its worse; the misery of man is at its extreme; society is
 at its darkest.  The means of remedy, of reform?  While education, industry,
 effort, progress, destruction, and construction are all correct, the funda-
 mental means is the great union of the people.
 When we look back at history, no movement was not the result of the union
 of certain people.  The bigger movements required bigger unions; the biggest
 movements required the biggest unions.   Such union was most apparent at the
 time of reform or resistance.  Always, the reform or resistance of religion,
 of the arts, of politics, and of society resulted from bigger unions.  The
 outcome of victory or defeat depended on the strength or weakness of the
 union and on whether the principle of the union was new or old, true or false.
 The measure of uniting was always the same.
 Most of the ancient unions were those of the powerful, of the aristocrats,
 and of the capitalists.  The many kinds of "alliance" agreements in diplomacy,
 for instance, were the union of international powers.  China's "Pei-yang
 Faction" and "Southwest Faction," and Japan's "Satsuma clan and Choshu clan,"
 for instance, were the unions of domestic power holders; the political par-
 ties and parliaments of the various nations were the unions of aristocrats
 and capitalists.   (While the upper house, being the house of the elders, was
 the den where the aristocrats converged, the lower house, with its voting
 rights-restricted by property, was mostly monopolized by the capitalists).
 As for the trusts (iron and steel trust, petroleum trust...) and corpora-
 tions (the Japan Steamship Corporation, Manchurian Iron Corporation...),
 they were purely unions of capitalists.  By the present time, the unions of
 the powerful, the aristocrats, and the capitalist have reached the limit;
 therefore, the state is at its worst, the misery of man is at its extreme,
 and society is at its darkest, resulting in reform, in resistance, and in
 the great union of the people.

 Since the victory of the "political reform" in France as a result of the
 great union of the people against that of the royalists, the various na-
 tions followed suit and produced many "political reforms."  Since  the vic-
 tory of the "social reform" in Russia last year as a result of the great
 union of the people against that of the aristocrats and capitalists, the
 various nations, such as Hungary, Austria, Czechoslovakia,.and Germany, fol-
 lowed suit and produced many social reforms.  Though the victory is not yet
 complete, that it will inevitably become complete and spread worldwide. can
 be imagined.  Why is the great union of the people so powerful?  Because
 the people of a nation are always greater in number than the aristocrats,
 capitalists, and other power holders.  Since the number of aristocrats,
 capitalists, and other power holders is small, what they rely on to defend
 their own special interests and exploit the public interest of the people
 are knowledge, money, and force.  Education in the old days was the special
 privilege of the aristocrats and capitalists, which the ordinary people had
 no opportunity to enjoy.  Since. knowledge was monopolized, the intelligent
 and uninformed classes were created.  Money is the medium-of living, and
 everyone should be able to.get it.  Yet the knowledgeable aristocrats and
 capitalists, by such means as "capital concentration," gradually directed
 it into the hands of the landowners and plant bosses.  While they made land,
 machinery, and houses their own and called them "fixed property," they ga-
 thered money, the so-called movable property, into their.treasury (banks).
 The millions of common people working for them were given francs and pennies.
 Since those who work had no money, the rich and poor classes were created.
 With knowledge and money, the aristocrats and capitalists set up camps to
 train soldiers and plants to make guns.   Under the excuse of "foreign ag-
 gression," tens of divisions and hundreds of battalions were recruited.
 Imitating conscription, they invented the "selective service system."  Thus,
 the vigorous sons of the people became soldiers.  When a problem was encount-
 ered, they brought out the machine guns to attack their incapable and weak old
 men.  When the Southern army was defeated in Hunan, didn't they kill many
 of their old men?  The aristocrats and capitalists utilized such ingenious
 methods, and the ordinary people were afraid to express themselves:.  Thus
 were created the strong and weak classes..
 Luckily the ordinary people surreptitiously studied some of their "secret"
 textbooks, and gradually acquired knowledge.  Envying the comfort of the
 capitalists, the ordinary people eyed the farmland and plants where money
 came from.  As for the soldiers in the camps, they were their sons, brothers,
 or husbands.  When the soldiers aimed the machine guns at them, they shouted
 in a loud voice.   Such shouts turned the bullets into mud.  Unconsciously.,
 they returned home together hand in hand, changing together into staunch
 warriors against the aristocrats and capitalists.  We only have to look at
 the hundreds of thousands of troops of Russia which suddenly substituted the
 red flag for the vulture flag to understand the profound reason therein.
 The ordinary people saw through the three methods of the aristocrats and
 capitalists and realized that they practice them.by means of union.  They

 also saw that they were few and we were many, and so they resorted to the
 great union. In regard to the actions after  union, one faction was very
 violent, "used their own medicine,".and waged a death struggle against them.
 The leader of this faction was a man born in Germany named Marx.  The other
 faction was more moderate, did not seek instant results, but began ty working
 toward the awareness of the ordinary people. Everyone must possess the virtues
 of mutual aid and voluntary work.  As long as they would repent and were able
 -to work, and would help, rather than hurt, others, it was not necessary to
 kill the aristocrats and capitalists.  The intent of those of this faction
 was more extensive and profound.   They wished to unite the entire earth in-
 to one nation  and all mankind into one family.  With harmony and friend-
 ship--not Japan's friendship, together they would strive for prosperity in
 the world.   The leader of this faction was a man born in Russian by the name
 of Kropotkin.
 We must know that anything in the world is easy to do to start with.  What
 is not easy is due to. the influence of history--habit.  If we can shout in
 unison, we will break down the influence of history.  We must unite even more
 extensively and, when we encounter. what we feel is wrong, we must form our
 ranks and loudly. shout at the opposing side.  We have already. had the ex-
 perience:  Lu Jung-t'ing's [7120 2837 1694] shells would never hit the vil-
 lains like Ts'ao Ju-lin [2580 3067 7207].  But when we rose up and shouted,
 the villians stood up and trembled; they fled for their lives.  We must know
 that our brothers of other nations constantly. resort to this means to seek
 their interest.  We must emulate them.  We must form our great union!
 (II)   Small Unions as the Foundation
 In a previous issue of this newspaper, the possibility and necessity of the
 "great union of the people" were covered.   Today, the means of the great
 union will be discussed.   It is the "small unions of the people."
 What we want is a sort of great union, in order to resist those holding power
 and injuring others and attain our own interest.  Then, we must.have all kinds
 of small unions to serve as its foundation.  Man has the instinctive talent
 for union.   It is the talent to form groups, the talent to organize society.
 "Group" and "society" are what I refer to as "union."  There are large groups
 and small groups, large societies and small societies, and large unions and
 small unions, the same thing in different names.  That we must have a
 group, a society, and a union is because we want to seek our common interest.
 Due to the differences in our circumstances and occupations, the sphere of
 our common interest also varies.  As there.are large and small common in-
 terests, the means to attain common interest (union) also differs in size.
 Gentlemen!  We are peasants.  We must form a union of those of our kind in
 order to seek the various interests of the peasants.  The interests of the
 peasants must be sought by the peasants themselves. As those not engaged

 in farming do not have the same interests, they will not help us.  Farming
 gentlemen!  How do the landlords treat us?  Are the rents heavy or light?
 Is our housing adequate?  Are our stomachs full?  Is the farmland too little?
 Are there people in the village  without farms?  We must constantly seek the
 answers to these questions.  We must form a union with those of our own kind,
 and concretely.and openly seek the answers.
 Gentlemen!  We are workers.  We must form a union with those of our own kind
 in order to seek the interests of the workers.  The various problems con-
 nected with our labor, such as the amount of wages, the hours, whether there
 is equal distribution of profit, whether there is improvement  in recreation...,
 all require answers.  We must form a union with those of our own kind, and
 concretely and openly seek the answers,
 Gentlemen!  We are students.  We have a hard time.  Those teaching us treat
 us as enemies, trample us as slaves, and confine us as-prisoners.  The win-
 dows of our classrooms are  so small that the light cannot reach the black-
 board, making us nearsighted. The tables are unsuitable, and we suffer
 from "spinal curvature" after sitting over them too long.  The teachers only
 want us to read more books.   We read many books, but we cannot understand
 them, merely wasting the effort  of memorizing.  Our eyes are blurred, our
 brains confused, our blood deficient, and our complexion pale.  We suffer
 from anemia and neurasthenia.  Why are we so stiff?  So dull?  So wasted?
 They are all because the teachers force us to stay still and keep quiet.  We
 are stiff like corpses.  Physical pain is still secondary.  Gentlemen!
 Please take a look at our laboratories!   They are so cramped and so poorly
 equipped--a few pieces of broken instruments.  It is impossible for us to
 do any experiment.  Our Chinese language teachers are so cantankerous.
 Quoting the classics endlessly, they do not understand the meaning.  Una-
 ware that it is not the 20th century, they continue to force us to perform
 the "ancient rites" and follow the "ancient laws" and stuff the classical
 dead literature into our mind.  Our library is empty; our recreation field
 dirty.  The nation is perishing, yet they still post announcements pro-
 hibiting us from being patriotic.  Take the save-the-nation movement this
 time:  We received must of their generosity!  Alas! Who are destroying our
 body and spirit and making us miserable?  If we do not unite now and pursue
 our "self-education," when will we do it?  Sunk into an ocean of misery,
 we must save ourselves.   The "self-education" invented by Rousseau is most
 .appropriate.  We must lineup our comrades wherever possible and study by
 ourselves.  We must not rely on the vicious teachers.     Whenever anything
 happens, such as the outrageous conduct of Japan's and our domestic power
 holders, we will form ranks and shout at them loudly.
 Ladies!  We are women.  We have sunk even deeper into the ocean of misery!
 Since we are also human beings, why are we not permitted to take part in
 politics?  Since we are also human being, why are we not permitted to have
 social contact?    We gather in holes and cannot step out of the front door.
 The shameless men and the hoodlums consider us as playthings, force us into

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 long-term prostitution, and destroy the freedom to love!  "Chastity" is
 limited to women!  There are many shrines for chaste women, but where are
 the temples for chaste men?  Some of us gather in women's schools, but those
 teaching us are the shameless men and hoodlums.   All day long they discuss
 'virtuous wife and good mother."  It is for no other purpose than to teach us
 to specialize in long-term prostitution.  They are afraid that we will not
 accept control.  What misery!   God of Freedom, where are you?  Please rescue
 us!  We have awakened!  The women must unite and sweep aside all the evil
 ghosts violating us and destroying our physical and spiritual freedom!
 Gentlemen!  We are elementary school teachers.  All day long we teach class
 and are very busy.  All day long we inhale chalk dust, and there is nowhere
 for us to relax.  Elementary school teachers in such a big city must number
 in the hundreds, in the thousands, yet there is no recreation facility for
 our use.  When we teach, we must constantly improve our learning, yet there
 is no research organ established for us.  The inflexible classroom hours
 are many, and there is no spare time, energy, or spirit to study.  Thus, we
 become phonographs, performing and reciting what our teachers taught us
 in the old days.  Our stomach is empty.  The monthly wage of 8  or 10 yuan
 is even discounted.   Some principals follow the method of "reducing military
 ration" and pocket the money allocated by the government.  Without money, we
 become-married widowers, living tens or hundreds of li away from our spouses.
 We are told that teaching elementary school is a lifetime career.  Does it
 mean that we should spend our entire life as widowers or widows?  According
 to the theory of education, the teachers and their families should live in
 the school in order to serve as models to the students, but it is impossible
 now.  As we have no money, we cannot buy books, nor travel and observe.  No
 need to say more!  Elementary school teachers are only slaves!  If we do not
 wish to be slaves, the only way is for us to unite with our own kind and form
 an elementary school teachers' union.
 Gentlemen!  We are policemen.  We also wish to unite with our own kind and
 form a union beneficial to our body and mind.  The Japanese say that the most
 miserable are beggars, elementary school teachers, and policemen.  We feel
 more or less the same.
 Gentlemen!  We are cart pullers.   Our perspiration falls like rain.  The
 cart owners charge so much for rent, while the fare we get is so little!
 How can we live?   Is there also a method of union for us?
 The above are the wails of the peasants, workers, students, women, elementary
 school teachers, and cart pullers.  Unable to endure the misery any longer,
 they wish to form all kinds of small unions in their own interests.
 Among the small unions discussed above, the union of workers is a very large
 and general term.  To put it in greater details, the following are of the
 lowest level in the workers' unions:  Unions of railway workers, of mining

 workers, of telegraph employees, of telephone employees, of shipbuilding
 workers, of steamship workers, of metal workers, of textile workers, of
 streetcar operators, of cart pullers, of building workers....  The workers of
 Western nations all have small unions according to the occupations and pro-
 fessions.                     Such unions as the transport workers' union and the streetcar
 workers' union are found everywhere.  Many small unions become a large union,
 and many large unions become the largest union.  Thus, "associations" and
 "alliances" come into being.  When it is for the common interest of a small
 number of people, a small union is formed.  Due to the common points of in-
 terests among the small unions, a large union can be established.  Studying,
 for-instance, is the obligation of us students, and we form an academic union.
 The pursuit of liberation and freedom is something which concerns everyone.
 Thus, we must rally all kinds of people to form a large union.
 Therefore, we must begin with the small unions when we want a large union.
 We must emulate our fellow beings of other nations, and form many small
 unions.
 (III)  The Situation of China's "Great Union of the People"
 In the two previous installments we have discussed:  (1) the possibility and
 necessity of a great union of the people and (2) the fact that the great
 union of the people is founded on the small unions.  Now, in regard to
 China's great union of the people, do we have the awareness?  Do we have the
 motivation?  Do we have the ability?  Can we succeed?
 (1) In regard to China's great union of the people, do we have the aware-
 ness?  The revolution of 1911 appeared to be a union of the people, but it
 was actually not so.  The 1911 revolution was instigated by students studying
 abroad, encouraged by the Ko-lao Society and fought by the soldiers of the
 new army and patrol camps.   It had nothing to do with the majority of the
 people.   Though we supported their principle, we did not take any active,
 part. Nor did they need us.  But we gained an awareness.  We found out
 that the sacred emperor could be overthrown and that the treacherous demo-
 cracy could be established.  If we had anything to say or anything to do,
 we could say or do it at any time.  After 1911, we again overthrew Emperor
 Hung-hsien in 1916.  Though it was undertaken by a minority, we realized
 that the arrogant Emperor Hung-hsien could also be overthrown.   In recent
 years, there were the civil war betwen the North and the South and the World
 War, and things changed even more.  The outcome of the civil war was that
 we acquired more ironclad evidence to show that the bureaucrats, military
 men, and politicians injured, poisoned, and exploited us.   The outcome of
 the World War was that the people of the nations, due to the  hardships in
 their living, suddenly undertook many actions.   Russia overthrew the arist-
 ocrats and expelled the rich.   The workers and peasants jointly formed a
 provisional government.  The Red Flag Army fought everywhere and swept
 aside many enemies.  The alliance changed its form as a result, and the
 whole world was shaken.  Hungary rose, and a brand-new worker-peasant
 government appeared in Budapest.  The Germans, Austrians, and Czechoslovakians

 responded and waged a death struggle against their domestic enemies.  The
 angry tide surged West and then shifted to the East.  After the many general
 strikes in England, France, Italy, and America, large scale uprisings broke
 out in India and Korea.  Then, there was the 4 May Movement in China be-
 tween the Great Wall and Po-hai.  Shifting the standards and banners toward
 the south, the movement crossed the Yellow River to the Yangtze, from Huang-
 p' u to Hankow, all the way to Tung-t'ing Lake and the Min River, the tide
 rising ever higher.  Heaven and Earth rose out of hibernation; the treacher-
 ous and the evil fled.  Alas!  We understood!  We awakened!  The world is
 ours; the nation is ours; society is ours.  If we do not say it, who will?
 If we do not do it, who will? We must actively proceed with the urgent
 great union of the people!
 (2) Is there the motivation for China's great union of the people?  In re-
 gard to this question, I will directly answer yes.  If you do not believe
 me, let me explain.  The origin of China's union of the people must be traced
 back to the establishment of the Provincial Bureau at the end of the Ch'ing
 Dynasty and the formation of the revolutionary party--the Revolutionary Al-
 liance.  With the Provincial Bureau, there was the joint petition of the
 provincial bureaus in the provinces for an early parliament.  With the revol-
 utionary party, there was the appeal to those in China and abroad to launch
 an uprising and expel the Manchus.  The 1911 revolution was a joint venture
 by the Provincial Bureau and the revolutionary party.  Subsequently, the
 revolutionary party became the Kuomintang, and the Provincial Bureau the
 Progressive Party.  It was the beginning of political parties in China.
 Thereafter, the republic was founded.  The central government convened the
 parliament, and the provinces also held provincial assemblies.  At this time,
 the provinces formed three kinds of organizations:  Provincial education,
 commercial, and agricultural associations.  (Several provinces had labor
 associations; others included the workers in the agricultural associations,
 such as Hunan).  Meanwhile, the counties also established county education,
 commercial, and agricultural associations.  (Some counties did not do so).
 These constituted firm and effective unions.   Other types of organizations
 were also formed according to the conditions and situations, such as, alumni
 associations of the schools, fellow-provincials' associations for those away
 from home, general and branch associations of students returning from abroad,
 "Shanghai Daily News" Guild, World Chinese Students' Association, Peking and
 Shanghai European and American Returning Students' Associations, and Peking
 Chinese-French Education Association.
 All kinds of academic societies (such as Ch'iang Society, Kuang Society,
 Shang-chih Society, China Vocational Education Association, China Science
 Association, Asian Civilization Association...), all kinds of occupational
 or professional associations (the various occupations and professions in
 industry and commerce, such as banking association, rice association...;
 research associations in the schools, such as the Painting Research and
 Philosophy Research Associations in Peking...dozens of them), and all kinds
 of clubs were the products of political liberation and ideological

 enlightenment not permissible or possible in the period of government by one
 man.  The above mentioned associations were all very simple--the "small
 unions" discussed in the previous installment.   Recently, due to political
 unrest and foreign pressure, our awareness has been raised and the motiva-
 tion for large unions has appeared, such as the National United Association
 of Education Associations, the National United Association of Commercial
 Associations, the United Association of Canton's 72 Guilds, the United
 Association of Shanghai's 53 Organizations, the United Association of
 "Shang-hsueh Kung-pao," the National United Association in the:Field of News-
 papers, the National Hope-for-Peace Association, the National United Peace
 Association, the Peking China-France Association, the People's Diplomacy
 Association, the Hunan Reconstruction Association (in Shanghai), the Shantung
 Association (in Shanghai), the united students' associations of Peking,
 Shanghai, the provinces, and the cities, the united associations of all
 fields, the National United Students' Association....  Though many "gentle-
 men" and "politicians" who are not of the people are inevitably found in the
 various associations, societies, units, united associations, etc. (such as
 the national parliament, provincial assemblies, provincial education associa-
 tions, provincial agricultural associations, National Hope-for-Peace Associa-,
 tion, and National United Peace Association, which are completely gentlemen's
 or politicians' associations), the occupational or professional associations,
 academic societies, research associations, etc. are purely organizations of
 ordinary people or scholars.  The united students' associations and the united
 associations  of the various fields created recently are a sort of great
 unions of the people organized purely to deal with foreign and domestic
 power holders.   I feel that here is the motivation for China's national great
 union.
 (3) Do we have the ability to undertake China's "great union of the people?"
 Can we succeed?  When it comes to ability, there are doubts.  The Chinese
 people only concentrate on maximum, yet futureless private-profit.  Those
 in commerce fail to form corporations; those working fail to establish labor
 parties; those studying only follow the old method of making carts behind
 closed doors and fail to do joint research.  The Chinese people cannot under-
 take large scale organized enterprises.  That politics is not properly hand-
 led needs no mentioning.   The little achievement in postal and salt admin-
 istration  must be credited to the foreigners.   So long after the seas
 were opened for trade, we still do not have even a small ship which can travel
 to Europe.   "Chao-shang Chu" and "Han-Yeh-P'ing," the only ones in the coun-
 try, operated at a loss every year.   When they could not stand the loss,
 they recruited foreign capital.  Railways managed by foreigners are super-
 ior in cleanliness, equipment, and personnel.  Any railway managed by the
 Department of Communications becomes messed up.  All travelers on the Peking-
 Hankow, Tientsin-P'u-k'ou, and Wuch'ang-Ch'angsha lines have to cover their
 nose and grit their teeth!  As for the rest, the schools, self-government,
 or even a family, an individual, is not properly handled.  "Jackals of the
 same lair," that's what they are!   It is not easy to discuss the great union
 of the people!   It is not easy to compete against the deeply entrenched
 power holders!

 Even so, it does not mean that we basically do not have the ability.  That
 we do not have the ability has its reasons.  It is because "we have not
 practiced."
 For thousands of years, the millions of Chinese people lived the life of
 slavery, and only the "emperor" was not a slave.  (Some people said that the
 "emperor" was the slave of "Heaven.")  When the emperor was in charge, we
 were not allowed to practice our ability.  Politics, academic learning, and
 society all prohibited us from thinking, organizing, or practicing.
 Today it is different.  All aspects have been liberated--the liberation of
 thinking, of politics, of economics, of men and women, and of education.  We
 all wish to see the blue sky from the depth of hell.  The people of China
 have great abilities!  The stronger the pressure, the greater the reaction.
 After a long suppression, the eruption will be quick.  I would like to make
 a wild statement:  The reform of the nation of China in the future will be
 more thorough than any other nation; the Chinese society will be brighter
 than any other; the great unity of the nation of China will be achieved ahead
 of any area and any nation.  Gentlemen!  Gentlemen!  We must exert ourselves!
 We must strive forward!  Our golden world, our brilliant world, is ahead of
 us!

 BUSINESS REPORT OF WEN-HUA BOOKSTORE (No 2)
 March 1921
 [Text]
 Last year we issued a business report concerning the "initiation" and the
 condition of the "temporary business period."  Now, "Business Report No 2"
 deals with the condition of the "first half-year" from last September, when
 this bookstore was inaugurated, to the end of March this year.  The book-
 store was opened at the beginning  of last September; therefore, it has been
 7 months by the end of March this year, which is 1 month over the "reporting
 every 6 months" provided in the Organization Outline.  This is for the con-
 venience of accounting.  Hereafter, "reporting every 6 months" in the Organ-
 ization Outline will be observed.
 In regard to the purpose of this report, first, we want to report to our mem-
 bers how those members directly connected with the bookstore and those manag-
 ing the business market the publications, so that our members will know the
 actual situation of the bookstore.  Only by so doing will we fulfill our
 responsibilities.  Second, the Chinese people always follow the policy of
 secrecy in doing business.  Besides the inner circle, no one knows what
 they are doing.   Such secret policy is actually a sin.  When one is open
 and aboveboard, why shouldn't the situation be made public?  Wen-hua Book-
 store is an organization publicly owned by society; it is not for private
 gain.  To avoid the sin of secrecy, we oppose secrecy and adopt complete
 openness, reporting all conditions of the bookstore to the public besides
 just the members.   Third, in regard to the missions of our bookstore, we
 stated in our "Objective" that "...we wish to introduce all kinds of new
 Chinese and foreign publications by the fastest and simplest method to serve
 as the study material of the young people and all the people of Hunan."
 In the "Organization Outline," we also stated that "...all kinds of useful
 new publications will spread in the entire province and everyone will have
 the opportunity to read them."  Such a great mission cannot be accomplished

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 by our few dozen members alone.  To attain the goal of "everyone having the
 opportunity to read" the publications, we give serious attention to setting
 up branches in the counties.  With one branch in each of the 74 counties,
 and 10 members per branch, we must have 750 members.  Therefore, the only
 way is to publish the business conditions, so that all those of like mind
 near and far will understand the benefits of the store, set up branches in
 all areas, and help us spread our intent by word or deed.  The goal of
 "spreading in the entire province" may then be reached.  Fourth, what our
 bookstore' has are books and newspapers, but what it lacks is capital.  Why?
 Because books and newspapers come from outside, and we can have all we want,
 but capital comes from the members, and not all members are rich.  In addi-
 tion, our members are not involved in just the bookstore alone so there is
 not that much money available to serve as capital.  Furthermore, this book-
 store follows the principle of "public assets," with no withdrawal or in-
 terest, so our poor members cannot produce much money.                   Nevertheless, the
 undertaking of Wen-hua Bookstore is definitely something worthy of attention.
 Let us enumerate the.benefits: (1) Simple operation and (2) no waste of capital.
 As we all know, the urgent task today is to spread culture, and just the few
 schools alone are not enough to do so.'  Therefore, to expand the business of
 the bookstore and set up branches in the counties, we hope that our comrades
 who are able, will help us with larger funds. (We plan to raise .3,000 yuan
 of public capital within 2 years).  We don't know who are willing to help
 us.  Naturally, we cannot ask everyone.  Only by making public our business
 condition will those sympathetic to us step forward voluntarily and render
 aid.   Fifth, we have, up'till now, been selling books only, without doing
 any publishing.  Now we plan to organize an "editing and translating depart-
 ment" and a "printing press," coordinated with the bookstore's "distribution."
 Then., our bookstore will have its independent publications.  As the business
 will be further expanded, we will have to enlist more comrades and raise more
 funds (3,000 yuan for the editing and translating department and 5,000 yuan
 for the printing press).  Therefore, we have to make public the business con-
 dition of the bookstore in order to win the sympathy and attention of every-
 one.  The final point concerns the handling of business by our staff members.
 This is the sixth point.  To make the business prosperous, the accounts must
 be clear.  In regard to our accounts, we have daily, monthly, and half-
 yearly reckonings.   In daily reckoning, the business figures of the day are
 totaled every evening.  In monthly reckoning, the business figures of the
 entire month are totaled on the first of the following month.  The results
 of the previous 6 months are settled in the half-yearly reckoning.  The
 "business condition" in the report is the result of the "first half-yearly
 reckoning."  By so doing, the procedure is followed and the concept clear,
 and it will be easy to correct the errors and formulate new plans.
 What was covered in report No 1 will not be repeated.   Since our meeting on
 1 August last year at Ch'u-i Elementary School, our signing of the lease of

 a part of the Hsiang-ya Medical School buildings on Ch'ao-tsung Street on
 20 August, the start of business on 9 September, and the first council meet-
 ing on 22 October, the events of the bookstore worthy of recording are brief-
 ly as'follows:
 1.  Special council meeting, 29 December:  The meeting was attended by Ho
 Shou-ch'ien, Wang Chi-fan, Chou Tun-yuan, Kuo T'ao-seng, P'eng Yin-po,
 Hsiung Chin-ting, Chao Yun-wen, Liu Yu-chieh, and Mao Jun-chin, and the
 problems of "finding another location" and "raising additional funds" were
 discussed.  The problem of location was discussed first.  As the current
 location was stuck in a corner of Ts'ao-ch'ao-men and the space inadequate,
 for the purpose of developing business, it was decided that the bookstore
 must be moved to a more centralized location with more space.  However,
 caution was required, and we wanted to move once and for all only.  Before
 finding an appropriate spot and making definite arrangements, we would re-
 main where we were.  As the day before the meeting Ch'-uan-shan Academy prom-
 ised to loan a part of its buildings to the bookstore, everyone felt it would
 be a good move.  However, there must be a clear contract, in accordance with
 the goal of "safe progress."  It was finally decided that the bookstore would
 negotiate further with Ch'uan-shan.  The next problem was funds.  The first
 council meeting decided that 1,000 yuan should be raised this'year, and we
 were still 530 yuan short.  Everyone felt that it was not practical to raise
 money piecemeal.  X X X volunteered to raise the 530 yuan by himself.  The
 meeting was adjourned.
 2.  Contracts with the Commercial. Press and other bookstores:   These hap-
 pened after January this year.   Prior to. that, we had contracted to market
 publications with out-of-town bookstores such as Chung-hua, Ya-tung, T'ai-
 tung, New Youth Press, Peking University Publication Department, and the
 Academic Lecture Association.   By January this year, we entered an agree-
 ment with the Shanghai Commercial Press through Yang Tuan-liu to distribute
 its publications. at 10, 20, and 30 percent discounts.  In February, we
 succeeded in our negotiations to market for the Shanghai Evans Publishing
 House, but it handles mostly Western language books and very few Chinese
 books..  Hunan did not need much Western language books; therefore, we could
 not sell much.  In March, Hsin-chih Bookstore was formed in Peking, which
 was a new bookstore with roughly the same policy as Wen-hua Bookstore.  It
 discussed distribution with us, and we promised to do so.  Hua-yang Books
 and Newspaper Circulation Office asked us to market its remaining stock of
 books in Szechwan, and the Asia Civilization Association in Peking entrusted
 us with its "Current Affairs Monthly," a new publication since its reorgani-
 zation, and we promised both of them.  In addition, many new magazine pub-
 lishers negotiated with us to serve as their distributors during this period.
 3.  Marketing of publications:  We sold over 160 kinds of books, over 40
 kinds of magazines, and 3 newspapers. Since the start of business last
 year to the end of March this year, besides the 1-month winter vacation,
 business was good.  The demand always exceeded the supply.  On the one hand,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 as our store was short of capital and could not buy in large quantities from
 outside areas, the small quantities were exhausted upon their arrival.  On
 the other hand, it was the sudden upsurge of demand for new publications by
 society, resulting from the positive stimulation of the new thinking and
 the negative stimulation of the old thinking.  A sudden rise of interest
 made the public buy all they could.  It was an encouraging situation.   While
 most of the customers belonged to the academic world, many pamphlets of the
 "labor field" were sold to the laborers.  Age-wise, naturally most of the
 customers were young people, and the middle-aged adults came next.
 4.  Forming branches:  As we want the new books to be accessible to the peo-
 ple in all the counties, we must set up branches in all the 75 counties.
 We will not handle the task ourselves, but will help the comrades in the
 counties to set up the branches.   Those unfamiliar with the conditions of
 our bookstore may feel that it will be difficult to do so, but actually it
 is easy.  One only needs sufficient capital for the first and second batches
 of books, as little as 50 yuan or as much as 100 yuan.  Proceeds from selling
 the first and second batches will be sufficient for the third, and so on.
 Next, if the business in the counties is good, there is no problem.  If
 not, it is not important either.  The branches are always established in
 public places and require no independent front; therefore, the overhead is
 not much.  In out-of-the-way counties and towns, an annual sale of tens of
 yuan, or even down to a few yuan, will not matter.  Third, our bookstore
 will only charge the cost to the branches.  All preferential prices and
 discounts are credited to the branches.  Therefore, if the branches cannot
 make a profit due to lack of business, they will not suffer a loss either.
 Fourth, as a supplementary operation, the branches will not require many
 personnel.  Fifth, the unsold stock may be returned to us.  There will be no
 waste resulting from unsaleability.  With these five advantages, we maintain
 the opening a branch is "easy."  By the end of March this year, we already
 formed seven branches, i.e., P'ing-chiang, Liu-hsi, Wu-kang, Pao-ch'ing,
 Heng-yang, Ning-hsiang, and Shu-p'u.,  Besides the branch stores, there are
 seven "sales departments."  What are the differences between the branch
 stores and the sales departments?  First, a branch store will receive the
 entire discount, whatever the main store gets, while the sales department
 receives less, only 5 percent.  Next, the branches are located in other
 counties, while the sales departments are located in the schools in the
 city or operated by individuals.  (Preferential prices are given to in-
 dividuals selling pamphlets to ordinary people and those in the field of
 labor)....

 INAUGURAL STATEMENT OF TSU-HSIU UNIVERSITY, HUNAN
 August 1921
 [Text]  The Hunanese have recently inaugurated Self-Study University whose
 approach is to assume the form of the seminary of old, but adopt a study
 program of modern school.  It expects all students to study by themselves
 and do research together.  In China today when "university mania" seems to
 be the order of the day, this is probably the most practical educational
 institution.  It has recently issued a statement setting forth its inaugural
 purposes:
 Man cannot but study.  To study requires a place and an organization.  Form-
 erly, the place for study was the seminary.  When the school is introduced
 upon the abolition of the seminary, people vie to criticize the latter and
 praise the former.  In fact, both have merits and demerits.  The demerits
 of the seminary lie in the emptiness of its program on how to write "eight-
 legged" literature for acquiring positions in government.  As such litera-
 ture is a mere passtime, how can it be called real learning?  From this
 point of view, we can say the seminary is empty.  But it also has its merits.
 If we want to find such merits, we must first know the demerits of school.
 The school indeed has many virtues, but it also has many weaknesses.  Its
 first weakness is lack of affection between instructors and students.  The
 instructor aims at salary and the student aims at a diploma. After they
 have made their deal, they return to where they come from.  What they call
 "teaching" and "learning" are but commercial transactions.  Its second
 weakness is to waste the student's precious time by using stereotyped
 pedagogical and administrative methods.  Man's intelligence, talent and
 comprehension vary, but the school, neglecting these differences, tries to
 cram the same material into the student's mind.  To respect human dignity,
 nobody should be "administered" by others.  Yet the school, taking advan-
 tage of the residual power of the totalitarian emperor, looks down upon
 the personality of the student and openly "administers" the student.  Since
 there is the stereotyped professor, the. student loses his integral human
 nature; since there is the mechanical "administration," the student loses
 his integral personality.  This is the biggest defect of the school which
 should not be neglected by educators.  Its third weakness is heavy curricula

 with a great variety of courses.  The student has to attend classes all day
 long and knows nothing else.  He often becomes puzzled and can hardly use
 his mind to initiate his own research.  To sum up, although it cannot be
 said that all schools have these defects, that.they cannot be corrected,
 and that there is no room for future improvement, this picture is generally
 true.  It cannot be whitewashed if one wants to.  The root cause lies in
 the passiveness of the student.  His character has been eroded, his wisdom
 obliterated, and he. is to sink or swim cowardly with the rest of the world.
 Even the talented will not take the initiative.  Now look at the seminary.
 Although it has defects in form, it has none of the aforementioned weaknesses.
 In the first place, there is profound affection between instructors and
 students; secondly, there is no "administration" by professors but free re-
 search for exchange. of ideas; thirdly, the curricula are concise and research
 thorough and there is plenty of time for acquiring research findings.  From
 the viewpoint of "research form," the seminary far excels the school.  But
 the modern school has one strong point, that is, it either has a "research
 program" based on science or uses scientific methods to study philosophy or
 literature.  The seminary lags behind the school in this regard.  The reason
 the Self-Study University becomes a new institution lies in that it assumes
 the form of the seminary of old but adopts the program of the modern school
 and that it is a special organization that suits the human nature and facil-
 itates research.
 The above shows that both the seminary and school have merits and demerits.
 The Self-Study University will retain the virtues and reject the weaknesses.
 Now let us talk about the exclusive merits of the Self-Study University
 which happen to be the demerits of the seminary and school:  popularism and
 anti-popularism.  Both literary academy and government university have strict
 requirements.  Those who are unable to meet these requirements are, of course,
 rejected.  Even those who can normally meet these requirements but fail to
 do so in a particular case, that is, those who have the talent but fail to
 pass the entrance examination are turned down and thus barred from pursuing
 their advanced studies.  It is a great pity that, at the moment, many prom-
 ising young people are deprived of the opportunity to attend school.  This
 is the first point I wish to make.  Both the seminary and government spon-
 sored university treat learning as such a secret that only a few people
 with special privileges can attend school; the majority of common people
 could not share the opportunity.  Thus learning became the monopoly of a
 few "academic lords" and was kept at a farther and farther distance from
 the common people.   It was finally turned into a weird instrument for the
 intelligentsia to control the common people.  The above is the second point
 I wish to make.  Poor people cannot enter the seminary.  Only rich people
 can enter the university.  To get a diploma from a government sponsored
 university requires somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 yuan.  For poor people
 to enter a government sponsored university is as difficult as it is "for
 a wildcat to eat swan's meat."  The above is the third point.  The Self-
 Study University will correct these defects.  First, except for resident
 students upon whom certain limitations have to be imposed concerning
 housing arrangements, others who are interested in learning may be admitted.

 Second, it regards learning as something analogous to tea or meals which
 can be taken whenever people feel thirsty or hungry.  The secrecy of learn-
 ing is thus torn down.  Learning is now made available to all and everybody
 can have his share.  Third, although in the present era when "money is life,"
 the Self-Study University cannot yet provide everybody of the proletariat
 with an opportunity to pursue advanced studies, it is moving toward the goal
 that "learning does not necessarily require a great deal. of money."  Students
 of the Self-Study University may study in school, at home, in various shops
 groups or agencies.  It is more convenient than government sponsored uni-
 vesities and therefore less expensive.
 As I have already mentioned, the Self-Study University is a sort of popular
 university, then what is its program?  First, the main approach of the stu-
 dents of the Self-Study University is "to study and think by oneself."  The
 "library" at the university is designed for this purpose.   Second, the. stu-
 dents at the university, aside from studying and thinking by themselves,
 "discuss and do research together."  The organization of various research
 societies is designed for this purpose.  Third, the Self-Study University
 does not require instructors to cram everything into the student's'mind as
 if forcing food down the student's throat.  However, it needs those who
 can help guide the students in doing their research.  Fourth, the Self-
 Study University is based on course study.                         The students may take one or
 more courses.  The time and scope of each course vary with the wish and
 level of the student.  Fifth, students at the Self-Study University should
 not only study but also be ambitious.  They are encouraged to cultivate a
 good personality, discard bad habits and prepare to reform the society.
 Finally, we will talk about the necessity of establishing the Self-Study
 University in Hunan.  Gentlemen'  Isn't it that as of today there has been
 no institution of higher learning in Hunan?  It is well known that there
 is no possibility for the establishment of a provincial university in the
 near future.  Even if there is, it will be a 'government sponsored university.
 Then how to demonstrate or disseminate the spiritual urge and cultural im-
 pulse of the 30 million Hunanese who live along the valleys of the Hsiang,
 Yuan Tzu, and Li rivers?  Although the Hunanese are as active as the rising
 sun and very promising, what will become of them if their spiritual desires
 and cultural impulse cannot be satisfied?  At this point, we feel the
 Hunanese have a big mission to accomplish.  What is the mission?  It is to
 form, develop and mold their individual as well as their group character and
 personality.  This has been the very raison d'etre for the inception. of the
 Self-Study University.  Although it is, in fact, not possible to link the
 university to every Hunanese, it should, in spirit, become a public insti-
 tution of learning for the whole Hunanese society.  Although it is difficult
 to ensure good results, we are sure that with our unswerving efforts we
 will some day attain our goals as time rolls by.
 The university now has two divisions:  letters and laws.  Courses of letters
 include:   Chinese literature, Western literature, English, logic, psychology,

 etc.  Courses of laws include:   laws, politics and economics, etc.  The
 above are listed in the organic framework of the university.  It is released

 INAUGURAL STATEMENT OF 'HSIN-SHIH-TAI'
 10 April 1923
 [Text]  This journal, founded by colleagues of the Hunan Self-Study Uni-
 versity, can be taken as an organ to publish findings of their research.
 This journal is different from other school journals which accept all sorts
 of articles as if they were "groceries of words."  This journal has certain
 principles and purposes.  We all have an independent and enterprising spirit
 and unswerving determination.  In view of the bad social system and inade-
 quate educational institution, we pool our efforts to organize and establish
 this "fugitive state of learning," to try to acquire practical knowledge,
 and to prepare to carry out social reforms.  At the initial stage of Self-
 Study University, the value of our ideals has to be tested and the results
 are not yet known.  However, we believe our goals are correct.  Based on
 this spirit and determination, there is ample chance for success.  This
 journal can be a yardstick for experimentation.
 The inception of this journal is of great significance.  It is expected
 that this journal will make a thorough study and present concrete sugges-
 tions to those issues such as how to reform the government, how to clean
 up political practices, how to topple imperialism, how to overthrow the
 warlords, how to renovate educational institutions and how to revolutionize
 and renovate arts, literature and other branches of learning.  It is our
 sincere and earnest hope that this journal will urge those who. have the
 same ideals to study and implement these social reforms.

 PEKING COUP D'ETAT AND MERCHANTS
 11 July 1923
 [Text]  This coup d'etat suddenly aroused the political interest of the
 merchants who used to be apathetic to politics.  What happy news:  The
 General Federation of Business Circles of All Streets in Shanghai issued
 a declaration on 14 June urging the convocation of a national assembly to
 solve national issues.  The General Chamber of Commerce, in accordance
 with a resolution adopted by a plenary session, made a declaration on
 23 June which read in.part:
 "It is hereby solemnly declared that from the fourteenth of this month,
 our nationals will refuse to recognize that the internal and external
 activities of Tsao K'un [2580 6924], Kao Ling-wei [7559 0407 5588] and
 others who seized government power illegally represent the nation.  Aside
 from sending telegrams to military and civil leaders in all provinces,
 urging them to maintain law and order under their jurisdiction to maintain
 the status quo, it is hereby requested that all matters pertaining to re-
 habilitation and reconstruction be solved in consultation with the people
 of the whole nation."
 Meanwhile, the General Chamber of Commerce resolved not to recognize the
 National Assembly which "cannot represent the people."  It created a Rule-
 by-People Committee as an organization to actively solve national issues.
 This move by the General Federation of Business Circles of All Streets in
 Shanghai and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce constitutes the first
 step of merchants to participate in political activities and a manifesta-
 tion of the potential of merchants as can be explained in a Chinese saying:
 "their shout, after 3 years of silence, surprises all."
 The current political issue in China is none other than the single question
 of national revolution:   to topple, by our own efforts, the warlords and
 foreign imperialists which colluded with warlords.  This is the historical
 mission of the Chinese nationals which should be borne by the whole people:
 Merchants, workers, peasants, students and faculty and staff should all
 come forward and share part of the revolutionary work.  Due to historical

 inevitability and current circumstances, the role of merchants in national
 revolution is more urgent and important than that of others.  As we know,
 semi-colonial China is under the dual political pressure of warlords and
 foreign imperialists who colluded with each other to suppress the people
 of the whole nation.  Under such dual pressure, the whole nation has suf-
 fered a great deal.  It is, however, the merchants who are most sensitive
 to such pressure and suffer the most.  It is well known that "likin" and
 tariffs are two vital items to merchants.  Their urgent requests are to
 abolish the likin and increase the tariff both of which are closely related
 to their interests. But they are difficult to accomplish because abolition
 of likin impairs the interests. of warlords and increase of tariffs impairs
 the interests of foreign imperialists.  If likin is abolished, warlords
 will wither while merchants will prosper.  At that time, merchants can
 overthrow warlords merely by "issuing a call."  This is tantamount to lift-
 ing a stone just to hit one's own feet.  Clever warlords will not do this.
 If tariffs on foreign goods are increased, or the tariff agreement is abol-
 ished so as to let China work out protective tariffs at will, the shackles
 on Chinese merchants will be removed.  Then the development of domestic in-
 dustry and commerce will be accelerated in no time and foreign goods will
 loose their footholds in China.  Cunning foreign imperialists will not do
 this.  Therefore, abolition of likin and increase of tariffs are matters
 of a life-and-death nature to foreign imperialists and  omestic warlords.
 This cannot be done by a funny directive by Li Yuan-hung [7812 0337 3163]
 at his inauguration.  Take another example.  The textile merchants in
 Shanghai recently requested the government to issue textile bonds which
 were undermined by Tsao, Jui [2580 6904] and Chin Yun-peng [7246 7189 7720].
 Their request for a government ban on exporting cotton was frustrated by
 the foreign minister corps.  This further proves that foreign imperialists
 and warlords cannot coexist with merchants.  These frustrations were per-
 sonally experienced by such influential merchants as Mu Ou-chai [4476 5665
 7872] and others who attended the plenary meeting of Shanghai General Chamber
 of Commerce on the 23rd of last month.
 Merchants always "love peace."  They do not realize that political reforms
 need revolution and that these reforms cannot be accomplished by a few
 telegrams concerning "disarmament, constitution and financing."  Nor do
 they realize that the real strength of revolution can be mustered only by
 personal participation, organizing the whole nation and launching a mass
 movement.  They even had the thought that political reforms did not need
 a political party and considered the revolutionary efforts made by the
 Kuomintang were unnecessary.  If we compare the current situation with
 their childish and timid mentality in the past, couldn't we help laughing?
 In the past, some merchants who had blind faith in the United States held
 that the United States was a good friend of China; but they did not realize
 that it was the first-rate executioner.  Let us examine a few examples to
 show why those who had blind faith in the United States are wrong:  The
 United States secretly  helped Tsao Kun, who are opposed by both merchants
 and the whole nation, to seize political power; it did its utmost to foil

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-01460R000100010001-6
 the cotton export ban requested by merchants.  From the activities taken
 by Shanghai merchants in the coup we may find that their attitude has
 changed. They have made great progress; abandoning a peaceful approach
 adopting revolutionary methods and having the courage to participate in
 national affairs.  As for their hatred for the U.S, scheme to make inroads
 in China, the notorious label of "Chinese merchants are xenophiles" can at
 least be partly erased by the following telegram sent by the Shanghai
 General Chamber of Commerce and Bankers Federation to the American Chamber
 of Commerce and the Association of Overseas Americans accusing the latter
 of "taking advantage of our struggle for rule-by-people movement to intimate
 that the best policy is for China to be placed under international control,
 fraudulously asserting that they have obtained the consent of the Chinese
 Chamber of Commerce and banking circles in making such a proposal to the
 government."
 The merchants in Shanghai have stood up and taken action.  We hope that
 merchants elsewhere will also stand up and take action.in unison.  It is
 urgent as fire burning near eyebrows which does not allow us to lie idly
 on the bed.  Now it is high time to unite the whole nation to carry out
 revolution and not to allow merchants to have factions.  It must be made
 clear that foreign imperialists and warlords are the common enemies of
 merchants as well as the whole nation, and that the results of a success-
 ful revolution will be our common benefits.  It is most necessary to unite
 and struggle against common enemies and for common benefits.  We hope the
 merchants in Tientsin and Peking will not be taken in by Tsao Jui and other
 "bureaucratic capitalists," and the merchants in Hankow will not capitulate
 to Wu Pei-fu.  They will rise and join the merchants in Shanghai to take
 joint revolutionary action.  The more the merchants unite, the stronger
 they will be; the greater their role in leading the nation, the more chances
 for the revolution to succeed.
 Finally, we must warn the merchants:  First, revolution is not an easy task.
 It proves more difficult in China which has been under the dual pressure of
 foreign imperialists and warlords.  The only way for the revolution to suc-
 ceed is to call upon merchants, workers, peasants, students, faculty and
 staff and all oppressed people to establish a united front.  Meanwhile, we
 must implement the declaration of General Chamber of Commerce to solve
 national issues "in conjunction with the whole nation" and not to fall into
 the rut of Federation of Teachers and Merchants which rejected the partici-
 pation of workers.   Second, now that merchants have taken the first step
 toward revolution, they must take the second step immediately.  They must
 insist on convening a national assembly for solving national issues.  They
 must move forward in unison until their goal is attained.  They should not
 stop whenever there is an obstacle or move along the erroneous road of col-
 luding with foreign imperialists and warlords.  We must have the conviction
 that national revolution is the only way to save ourselves as well as our
 nation.  Many instances in history can be our reference or guide.  Our situa-
 tion urges us to carry out the historical mission.  We should not relax

 create a new nation!  We should never forget this is the historical mission
 of the Chinese nation!

 15 August 1923
 [Text]  "...Since the outbreak of the West Hunan issue, Chao's position
 has become precarious and cannot but use the Sheng Hsien (Provincial Con-
 stitution) as a shield to protect himself.  Several days ago, he ordered
 his cohorts Fang Ko-kang [2455 0344 0474] and Li Chi-min [2621 3444 3046]
 and others to use cash bribery to buy over civic organizations or to launch
 a mass campaign... attempting to support Chao by means of Provincial Consti-
 tution....  A parade has been scheduled at 8 am on the fifth....  Most of
 their letters were sent to workers organizations.  They assumed that as
 workers are simple-minded, more than 1,000 would come.  But up to 10 am,
 not a single workers body showed up.  Highly disturbed, they sent out people
 all over: to Chinese Workers Union, Care and Relief Association, Buddhist
 Speakers Group, etc., which were dominated by the bandits.  Each person was
 given half a yuan and a snack.  More than 100 were hired.   The parade started
 at noon.  Before the parade was begun, between 120 and 130 monks and beggars
 held a meeting in front of the slide showing.room of the Association of Edu-
 cation.
 (1) The meeting was chaired by Monk Che-pei [3589 1014] who explained the
 purpose of the meeting in part:   'Provincial Constitution shall better be
 called Sheng-Hsien-Ching [4164 4009 4842] just as the Buddhists have the
 Buddhist Bible....'  All the monks and beggars attending the meeting wildly
 waved their hands.

 front--one bearing the words "The Association to Protect the Provincial
 Constitution" and the other,  'Provincial Citizens Petition Rally.'

 pretending to be representatives of citizens of the province;

 We have been opposing the Confederation of Provincial Self-Government be-
 cause it is not as what the name suggests but a confederation  of  military
 governors who desire to control their separate domains in that name.  We
 have been opposing the phoney Provincial Constitution manipulated by war-
 lords and dirty politicians because it cannot protect the people but serve
 as a pretext for power struggles among warlords and dirty politicians.
 Hunan serves as a good example.  Chao Heng-t'i [6392 1854 1912] now un-
 ashamedly launched a "crusade to protect Provincial Constitution."  But
 for the last two years--since the establishment of Provincial Constitution--
 he coldbloodedly murdered the workers (Huang Lung [7806 1690] and others),
 clamped down on newspapers (TA-KUNG-PAO, CHIH-CHIH HSIN-PAO, HSIN-HSIANG-
 PAO), deprived the people of freedom of correspondence (postal and telegram
 censorship has never ceased for a single day), deprived the people of free-
 dom of assembly and association (shut down Ricksha Pullers Union, Rice
 Millers Union, Association To Back Up the Nation's Foreign Policy, and re-
 peatedly banned students and workers meetings), protected the planting and
 peddling of opium by his troops, bought votes through bribery (sent subor-
 dinates to stuff voting boxes with false ballots in the general ballot on
 Provincial Constitution and used cash bribery to create the new Provincial
 Assembly and a provincial governor), extorted contributions from the mer-
 chants (president of the Changsha General Chamber of Commerce was forced
 to flee), collected land rentals from the peasants in advance (some up to
 1928), upset the legal budget proportion by reducing the educational portion
 and increasing the military portion), and colluded with Wu Pei-fu and Hsiao
 Yao-nan [5618 5609 0589].  All these show that Chao, who used Provincial
 Constitution as a mask, is in fact a public enemy of the people.  The real
 purpose for. him to hold rallies and conduct campaigns this time stems from
 his fight for the opium tax (the so-called special tax) with Tsai Chu-yu
 [5591 6880 3731].  The Hunanese cannot but feel ashamed to allow such a
 diabolical criminal as Chao Heng-t'i to harp on "protecting Constitution"
 under false pretext.

 29 August 1923
 [Text]  We are now forced to sign an agreement on the Wei-hai-wei negotia-
 tions.                     The whole nation, except the people in Shantung, has not raised any
 protest. What is the reason?  Is it that the nation is too preoccupied in
 the campaign for retroceding Port Arthur and Dairen and forgets the drive
 for returning Wei-hai-wei?  Or that the nation knows to hate only Japan but
 not England, only that Japanese imperialists are making inroads in China
 but not that the inroads made by British imperialists are far more severe
 than those made by Japanese imperialists.
 Two officials responsible for the Wei-hai-wei negotiations:   one is Liang
 Ju-hao [3009 1172 3185], and the other Ch'en Shao-t'ang [7115 4801 0781].
 According to the announcement made by Ch'en Shao-t'ang at the Shantung
 Residents Society in Peking, Mr Liang committed the following crimes:
 "Commissioner Liang, who is a zenophile, made a suggestion to the British
 to retain Liu-kung-tao [0491 0361 1497].  The return of Wei-hai-wei is
 vital from the military point of view.  Mr Liang is willing to sell out
 national interests, transforming unconditional retrocession into continued
 lease and again into permanent lease.  This obviously stems from an exchange
 for his personal interests....  Mr Liang is resentful of my frustrating his
 scheme.  He has, at the outset, asked somebody to buy my acquiescence with
 promises of profits, stating that all my personal expenses can be reim-
 bursed through him and that I may share the spoils upon conclusion of the
 negotiations. After having repeatedly rejected the offer, I insisted that
 the negotiations be made public.  Noting that I cannot be moved by promises
 of profits, he resorted to coercion.  When our arguments came to an impasse,
 he would often pound the desk and shout:   "It is I who have full power to
 conduct negotiations."  Then he would order his guards to see me to the
 door.  I was greatly enraged and wanted to kill myself for national inter-
 ests.                    One day, I picked up an inkstand and tried to hit my forehead with
 it.  Upon seeing this, an Englishman was greatly astonished and persuaded
 me not to do so.  Mr Liang was not moved at all...."
 The draft agreement concluded by Liang Ju-hao and the British consists of
 two parts and 23 articles.  On 23 August the National Assembly in Tsinan
 pointed out its salient terms that impair national interests as follows:

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 (1) Substitute leasing for ceding--The draft agreement allows England to
 continue the lease for 10 years.  It may extend the lease at the end of 10
 years.  In addition, the lease adds to the new lease the city of Wei-hai-wei
 which hasnever been leased to England and is now designated as a special area.
 (2) Impairs territorial land and territorial waters--The draft agreement
 stipulates:  (a) The local authority of China should grant original British
 lease holders licenses of "permanent lease"; (b) no handling fees should
 be charged in accordance with the common practice by foreigners who hold
 permanent leases; and (c) China should not use the official land reserved
 for England; China should recognize the land leased by England.  This re-
 veals how much territorial rights has been yielded.  The draft agreement
 further stipulates:   (a) China may use the anchorage in the Liu-kung-tao
 waters only when the British navy is not using it; (b) the British navy
 may send marines to Liu-kung-tao and practice drills and marksmanship; and
 (c) The British navy may practice drills in the outer harbor of the anchor-
 age of Liu-kung-tao.                     According to the provisions, England is to occupy Liu-
 kung-tao and the adjacent waters and its marine and naval detachments may
 enter and leave our territorial land and waters at will.
 (3) Gives away national sovereignty--The draft agreement stipulates that
 the area between Liu-kung-tao and Wei-hai-wei be designated as a specail
 area.   It should belong to neither Shantung authority nor the Central Govern-
 ment.                        Our government may nominally appoint administrative officials, but
 the police is directed by the British, finance controlled by the Customs
 Inspectorate (British) and the city affairs is jointly conducted by a Sino-
 British Committee composed of Chinese and Englishmen.  The administrative
 officials appointed by the Chinese Government are but titular ones and
 their chief responsibilities are to repay the debts to the Englishmen and
 raise funds for public expenses.  Wei-hai-wei has thus become Hong Kong II.
 Our national sovereignty has completely been undermined.
 Compatriots having blind faith in the Washington. Conference:  What did the
 Washington Conference do for us?  Compatriots believing England is better
 than Japan:   In what way is England better than Japan?  The return of Wei-
 hai-wei means only to turn it into Hong Kong II.  England wants to renew
 the lease of its settlements in Hankow and Tientsin upon the expiration of
 their present leases; its request of connecting the Canton-Kowloon Railroad
 and the Canton-Hankow Railroad is to put the upper reaches of the Yangtze
 River and southwest provinces under the economic aggression of Hong Kong.
 The tariff agreement is limited to discussing.the likin issue only (26
 August London dispatch).  They have recently removed their masks to suggest
 joint administration of the railroads.  Compatriots having blind faith in
 the Washington Conference and believing England is better than Japan:  What
 did the Washington Conference do for us?  In what way is England better
 than Japan?  The nation should rise immediately to oppose the pirate-like
 British who have exposed their aggressive intention:
 The nation should rise immediately to oppose traitor Liang Ju-hao!

 [Text]  We often say:  The Chinese government is the  bookkeeper of foreign-
 ers.                   Some people may doubt it.  Do we often say:  Foreigners (especially
 the British and Americans) try to squeeze more Chinese blood in the name of
 "goodwill"?  Some people may also doubt it.  Since the lifting of the cotton
 export ban due to objection by foreigners, some people have begun to believe
 there is some truth in it.  Now that foreigners are pressing the government
 to abolish the cigarette tax in Chekiang and other provinces, they have be-
 gun to believe there is more and more truth in it.  According to a 29 August
 dispatch from Peking in the SHEN PAO [3947 1032] which read:  "The Cabinet
 has, as a result of the protest by British and American ministers, resolved
 to order all provinces to stop collecting the cigarette tax."  What is the
 cigarette tax?  Please read the 30 June telegram sent by the General Chamber
 of Commerce in Hangchow to the Peking government:
 "It is a common practice for governments to levy taxes on luxury items.  In
 recent years, cigarettes have had a field day.  For Chekiang Province alone,
 the annual sales volume exceeds 10 million yuan.  The consumption volume is
 shocking and the poisonous effects are as detrimental as opium.  The auth-
 orities have therefore established bureaus to collect the cigarette tax,
 trying to use revenues from this wasteful item for repairing roads.  It is
 learned that foreigners, under the pretexts of treaty rights, have made
 repeated protests with the government against this tax.  It should be pointed
 out that this special tax, imposed exclusively on the smokers, has nothing
 to do with the cigarette merchants.  This is the tax paid exclusively by
 people in Chekiang, foreigners should not interfere with it.  Moreover, it
 is purely a domestic matter, and foreigners should not interfere.  The
 government is urged to present all possible justifications and allow no
 pretexts so as to protect our sovereign rights."
 It is thus clear that the British and Americans, taking advantage of tariff
 agreements, are trying to force China not to levy taxes freely on imported
 luxury items.  They disregard whether it is "the tax purely paid by people
 in Chekiang" or it is "purely domestic matter."  They insist that no
 tax should be imposed on imported goods.

 Of the cigarettes produced by British and American companies, a small por-
 tion is imported from England, the United States and Japan, the greater
 portion is manufactured in factories in inland China  in such cities as
 Shanghai and Hankow, using Chinese tobacco leaves and Chinese labor.  After
 paying a nominal tax in accordance with the terms of the "agreements," the
 merchants send the cigarettes in bulk to various provinces, not allowing
 China to levy taxes "freely."  The annual cigarette sales volume in Chekiang
 Province alone exceeds 10 million yuan.  Based on this figure, the total
 annual cigarette sales volume in the whole nation should at least exceed
 200 million yuan.  It is really "shocking."  Let the 400 million compatriots
 think it over:  What is the real purpose behind the "goodwill" of foreigners?
 The "Cabinet meeting" of the Chinese government is really quick in yielding.
 Even the fart of foreigners can be taken as "fragrance."  The Cabinet meeting
 lifts the cotton export ban because foreigners want cotton; it orders "all
 provinces to stop collecting the cigarette tax" because foreigners want to
 import cigarettes.  Let the 400 million compatriots again think it over:
 Isn't it correct to say that the Chinese government is the bookkeeper of
 foreigners?

 KUOMINTANG CENTRAL COMMITTEE REFUTES KUOMINTANG  MEMBERS FOR CONVENING
 ILLEGAL MEETING IN PEKING
 27 November 1923
 [Text]  Telegram to Kuomintang Headquarters of All Levels
 Members of Kuomintang Headquarters of All Levels:  Upon receiving the
 16 November telegram from Lin Sen [2651 2773] and other members of the
 Central Executive Committee in Peking urging the convocation of the Fourth
 CEC Plenary Session at the Western Hills, the Central Executive Committee
 strongly refuted the move.  From a legal point of view, since the Third
 Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee resolved that the
 National Congress and the CEC Plenary Session be convened in Canton, nobody
 should violate the resolution.  From a practical viewpoint, if the CEC
 Plenary Session, which is intended to be  a public meeting, should be held
 in Peking, it would be under the pressure of imperialists externally and
 obstruction of reactionaries through the warlords internally.  This was the
 reason for the participants in the Third CEC Plenary Session, held in
 Peking in April, to stop the meeting mid-way and move southward and continue
 to meet in Canton.  Whenever we plan for the future, this bitter experience
 should be remembered.  How could the Fourth CEC Plenary Session fall into
 the same rut and let warlords and reactionaries attain their scheme of under-
 mining the revolution?                    Moreover, the Second National Congress was originally
 scheduled for' 15 August in Canton, it was repeatedly postponed because of
 strikes in Kwangtung and Hong Kong, transportation difficulties, campaigns
 against reactionaries in Canton and incessant civil wars.  Now all
 Kwangtung Province has been unified and Canton is as safe as a rock.  Even
 if there is still some transportation difficulties, the meeting can be held.
 The Central Executive Committee has therefore resolved to call its Fourth
 Plenary Session on 11 December and the Second National Congress on New
 Year's Day of the Fifteenth Year.  It has sent telegrams to Comrade Lin
 Sen and others, urging them to respect the resolution, take consideration
 of the circumstances, come to Canton to attend the meeting immediately, not
 to insist on their deviationist views and stir up trouble.  Aside from
 sending telegrams to Comrade Hu Han-min [5170 3352 3046] who is now in
 Moscow and Comrades Li Lieh-chun [2621 3525 6874], Po Wen-wei [2672 2429

 PROPAGANDA OUTLINE FOR KUOMINTANG'S WAR AGAINST FENG-T'IEN
 [Text]  In view of the fact that the'war against Feng-t'ien is a momentous
 matter, that it forms a part of the national revolutionary movement against
 British and Japanese imperialism, and that party units of all levels in all
 areas should direct all the comrades to propagandize extensively so that
 the people of the entire nation will understand the reason and the goal of
 the war, the Propaganda Department of the Chinese Kuomintang Central Execu-
 tive Committee has formulated a propaganda outline, analyzing the various
 aspects of the war, presenting an outline of propaganda, and listing nine
 slogans.  This outline was submitted by Department Chief Mao Tse-tung, and
 passed at the meeting of the Central Committee on 27 November.
 (A) Analysis of the War Against Feng-t'ien
 (1) In regard to imperialism:  The war between Chih-li and Feng-t'ien last
 year was an attempt of British and American imperialism to support the
 Chih-li faction to unite China and oust Japanese imperialism.  It was ig-
 nited by the Kiangsu-Chekiang war, because American imperialism wished to
 monopolize Kiangsu's wireless telegram loan and expel Japan's loan.  There-
 fore, at that time, America and the pro-America faction did their utmost
 to help Ch'i Hsieh-yuan [7871 3610 0337] while Japan and the pro-Japan
 faction supported Lu Yung-hsiang [4151 3057 4382].  The war against Feng-
 t'ien this time is along the same line.  Japanese imperialism stands behind
 the Feng-t'ien faction while American imperialism backs the Chih-li faction.
 As for British imperialism, seeing the incompetence of the Chih-li faction
 in the Feng-t'ien-Chih-li war last year, when the nationwide  anti-British
 30 May Movement broke out, British imperialism compromised with Japan and
 induced Chang Tso-lin [1728 0155 7207], by means of generous rewards, to
 suppress the anti-British movement in Shanghai.  It was subsequently rumored
 that Britain supplied large sums of money to Feng-t'ien to expand the Feng-
 t'ien Arsenal in order to enable the Feng-t'ien faction to unite China.
 Feeling that Shanghai's military reinforcement handled by Yang Yu-t'ing

 [2799 1342 7200] and the customs conference held in Peking were favorable
 to Chang of Feng-t'ien, the Chih-li faction started trouble on an early
 date.  Whether the cunning British imperialism is on the side of Feng-t'ien,
 or Chih-li in the war this time cannot be clarified completely at this time.
 Probably Japan, for the purpose of resisting America, would rather associate
 with Britain and jointly make use of Chang Tso-lin.  However, if Britain
 should detect any unfavorable situation on the part of Chang Tso-lin and
 the possibility of victory on the part of its old servant Wu P'ei-fu [0702
 0160 1318], it may, for the purpose of consolidating its power sphere along
 the Yangtze valley, abandon its new love for its old flame.  It is something
 which will not be surprising.  One can see that British imperialism will
 back the side which appears to be more certain of victory.
 (2) In regard to the warlords:  In the confrontation between Chih-li and
 Feng-t'ien, the Chih-li faction controls Hunan, Hupeh, Kiangsi, Anhwei,
 Kiangsu, Chekiang, and Fukien, a total of seven provinces.   Szechwan's
 Yuan Tsu-ming [5913 4371 6900] and Kweichow, which is under his control,
 nominally also belong to the Chih-li faction.  However, there are specific]
 factions inside these several provinces, and Wu P'ei-fu and Sun Ch'uan-fang
 [1327 0278 5364] will inevitably split.  In the critical period of the war
 against Feng-t'ien, Sun and Wu had to unite and fight.  Now that the war is
 at a standstill a fissure has appeared.  A split will be inevitable once
 Chang of Feng-t'ien is defeated.  In the Feng-t'ien faction, there have
 always been the old and the young factions.  Since defeating the Chih-li
 faction last year, their hidden internal struggles have been ever aggravat-
 ing due to the distribution of rights and privileges.                       Their treasury is
 exhausted, and the Feng-t'ien paper currency has dropped to below 50 percent.
 The seizure of Hopeh, Shantung, Kiangsu, and Anhwei was for the purpose of
 solving the financial problem.  With the loss of Kiangsu and Anhwei, the
 threat of the Kuomintang army, and the precarious situation of the Peking-
 Hankow line in Shantung and Hopeh, their financial sources inside Shan-hai-
 kuan have withered.  When several hundred, thousand hungry  troops are
 stationed inside and outside Shan-hai-kuan, the situation requires early
 war, not perseverance.  Between the Feng-t'ien and Chih-li warlord factions,
 regardless of which side wins, it.will be unfavorable to China, because each
 has a vicious imperialism backing it.  However, in the nation-wide anti-
 Feng-t'ien movement, since the Chih-li faction is against the Feng-t'ien
 faction, it has to be counted as one of us in order to resist the powerful
 enemy together.  Once Feng-t'ien collapses, it can then be wiped out with
 the strength of the nation.  This is a necessity in the war strategy.
 (3) In regard to political factions:   In the war against Feng-t'ien, the
 noteworthy political factions are the An-fu, Study, Joint Control, and New
 Diplomacy Factions, and the comprador class in Shanghai and Nan-t'ung.
 The military power of the An-fu Faction can be considered as nil at this
 time.  In regard to its political power, it has long split into the pro-
 Chih-li and pro-Feng-t'ien factions.                             As the pro-Chih-li faction is out of
 power and the pro-Feng-t'ien faction is in power in Peking, the Peking

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 government has become something completely representing Chang Tso-lin.
 The Study Faction always followed Ts'ao [2580] and Wu [0702] when they
 were in power.  Though Ts'ao and Wu have failed, it still remains behind
 Wu P'ei-fu.  With the triumph of the Chih-li faction, the Study Faction's
 Chiang Fang-chen [5592 2455 7201] and its members are swarming in Hankow
 to acquire benefits.  The Joint Control Faction consists of many small
 political factions, including the I-yu Society of the Political Studies
 Faction and the politicians of the so-called Kuomintang Comrades' Club such
 as Chang Ping-lin [4545 3521 7792].  Currently, all its members are gathered
 under the banner of Wu P'ei-fu and making plans for action.  The Ku Wei-
 chun [7357 4850 6874] faction, which is the so-called New Diplomacy Faction,
 has always served as the traitorous agent between the Chih-li faction and
 British and American imperialism.  Currently, it is associated with the
 Study Faction and the comprador class of Shanghai and Nan-t'ung, gathering
 together under the banner of the Chih-li faction and vigorously pursuing its
 traitorous activities.  Last year, in the war against Chih-li, the comprador
 class in Shanghai and Nan-t'ung, under the direction of American imperialism,
 stood alongside the Chih-li faction.  With the resumption of power by the
 Chih-li faction, it has immediately followed the intent of its master
 (American imperialism) to serve as a resounding echo of the Chih-li faction
 and its effective support.  Of the political factions discussed above, be-
 sides the An-fu Faction which represents the interests of Japanese imperial-
 ism and the bureaucrats and belongs to the Feng-t'ien faction, all the rest,
 including the Joint Control Faction of the Study Faction representing the
 interests of the bureaucrats and the landlord class, the New Diplomacy
 Faction representing the interests of Britain and America, especially
 America, and the comprador class of Shanghai and Nan-t'ung, stand on the
 side of the Chih-li faction.
 (4) In regard to the National Army:  The National Army has no connections
 with British, American, and Japanese imperialism; therefore, it is sympa-
 thetic to the anti-imperialist movement.  This is its most outstanding
 characteristic.  Currently, due to the necessity of strategy, it has not
 split with Chang Tso-lin.  Actually, it may even adopt a temporary compro-
 mise.  But it is a temporary matter.                   If our party wishes to make a long-
 range substantial progress in the national revolution after the war against.
 Feng-t'ien, the victory of the National Army in the North is one of the
 important keys.
 (4) In regard to the National Government:  The foundation of our party in
 Kwangtung is very stable.  Hsiung K'o-wu's [3574 0344 2976] troops along
 the Pei River have long been liquidated, and Ch'en Chiung-ming's [7115 3518
 2494] troops along the Tung River have been.wiped out.  Forces have. been
 sent after the small contingents sneaking into the Fukien border, eliminat-
 ing them.  Teng Pen-yin's [6772 2609 3009] men in Nan-lu will soon be
 eradicated.  The unification of the entire area can be considered completed.
 The attempt of British imperialism to destroy our party's revolutionary
 force by associating with Ch'en Chiung-ming has failed altogether.  In regard

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 to the strikes in Canton and Hong Kong, the businessmen and government of
 Hong Kong know that there is no way to resist and are now doing their best
 to negotiate.  A successful solution will soon be reached.  The current
 tasks of our party in Kwangtung are the training and reenforqement of the
 revolutionary army, the renovation and rectification of civil administra-
 tion, finance, judicature, and education, and the expansion of the mass
 movements of workers, peasants, merchants, and students.  In a word, we
 must actively gather our strength within the shortest possible time, immed-
 iately send our troops North when the situation in the North and the South
 develops to a certain stage, and lead the people of the entire nation for
 the thorough solution of the affairs of the nation.  In the name of the
 Central Executive Committee, our party has published a declaration on the
 current situation and pointed out the goal of war against Feng-t'ien.  We
 have also, in the name of the National Government Committee, sent telegrams
 to the top generals of the Chih-li and Feng-t'ien factions, urging them to
 overthrow Feng-t'ien's Chang and organize a government and formulate policies
 compatible with the will of the people, in order to test their reaction to
 our party's principle of defending the interests of the people.
 (6) In regard to the people:   In the understanding of the people, the anti-
 Feng-t'ien movement this time is a movement against the warlords of the
 Feng-t'ien faction who support British and Japanese imperialism and sup-
 press the patriotic movement.  Therefore, the main force of the movement
 against Feng-t'ien should be the revolutionary people of the entire nation.
 By initiating the movement, the Chih-li faction only serves as the front-
 runner, not the main forcp.  Currently, the wrath of the people against
 the Feng-t'ien warlords is unprecedented.  Their concept that resisting
 Feng-t'ien is resisting British and Japanese imperialism and victory over
 Feng-t'ien is victory over Britain and Japan is the same as that of the
 people of Kwangtung that punishing Ch'en Chiung-ming was attacking British
 imperialism and victory of the eastern expedition was the victory of the
 strikes.  Therefore, the war against Feng-t'ien, in the understanding of
 the people, is different  from the wars between Hopeh and Anhwei and be-
 tween Feng-t'ien and Hopeh.
 (B) Our Propaganda and Preparation
 The responsible comrades of party units of all levels in all areas must,
 with organization and.planning, seek all kinds of opportunities to explain
 to the comrades and propagandize to the people the following points:
 (1) They must explain the conspiracies of the imperialists in this war.
 (2) They must explain the grave dangers to the people in case of victory
 of the Feng-t'ien warlords who serve as the running dogs of British and
 Japanese imperialism.
 (3) The people may temporarily utilize the resistance of the Chih-li fac-
 tion.against the Feng-t'ien faction, but they must not permit it to take

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 the place of the Feng-t'ien faction, because if so, the people will like-
 wise be in grave danger.  The people should not forget the lesson when the
 Chih-li faction was in power.  Special attention must be given to the propa-
 ganda of this point in areas in the Yangtze provinces where Wu P'ei-fu and
 Sun Ch'uan-fang are popular with the merchant class.
 (4) All types of counter-revolutionary factions, such as the An-fu, Study,
 Joint Control, and New Diplomacy Factions, and the comprador class are
 absolutely incompatible with the people's interest.  Their secrets must be
 exposed and they must all be ousted.
 (5) Among the anti-Feng-t'ien forces, the difference between the Feng Yu-
 hsiang [7458 3768 4382] faction and the Wu P'ei-fu and Sun Ch'uan-fang
 faction is that Feng has no connection with imperialism and he supports
 the national revolution, while Wu and Sun are under the orders of imperial-
 ism and resist the national revolution.  The distinction between friend and
 foe, as far as the people are concerned, depends on whether there is a re-
 lationship with imperialism.  Regardless of who and when, the moment such
 a relationship arises, the people will not consider him as a friend.
 (6) The true leader of the people is the Chinese Nationalist Party; the
 true government of the people is the National Government in Canton; the
 true army of the people is the National Revolutionary Army in Kwangtung.
 The Nationalist Party, the National Government, and the National Revolu-
 tionary Army are the vanguard against imperialism, the defenders of the
 people's interest, and the comforters of the people in their suffering
 (illustrated by Kwangtung's resistance to British imperialism and its
 unification and active construction this time).
 (7) All the oppressed people of China are the ones to decide on all the
 problems of China.   In the war against Feng-t'ien this time, the people
 should serve as the commander in chief.  The people must organize and take
 charge of the great movement against Feng-t'ien.
 (8) The four principles in the Nationalist Party's declaration on the cur-
 rent situation are:  1.  A united nation-wide national government must be
 formed.  2.  The national government must, as soon as possible, call a
 preparatory meeting for a national congress.   3.  The national government
 must, as soon as possible, call a preparatory meeting for a national con-
 gress and find the fundamental solution for the unequal treaties.  4.  The
 national government must defend the freedom of the people to speak, form
 associations, and hold meetings.  These four principles are the only way
 to conclude the war.  If they are not followed, then the situation of joint
 control by imperialism and the warlords will remain even after the end of
 the war, and the people will still face the same danger as before.
 (9) To implement the principles of the Nationalist Party, a national con-
 gress truly representing the people must be prepared as soon as possible.

 Among the many kinds of people's organizations, a renewed and general
 propaganda of "the necessity of the national congress in solving national
 affairs" should be promoted as a continuation of last year's propaganda.
 When necessary, the party units of the provinces and special municipalities
 should, within their jurisdictions, order a general mobilization and vigor-
 ously propagandize the national congress, in order to arouse the attention
 of the people.

 REASONS FOR PUBLISHING 'CHENG-CHIH CHOU-PAO'
 [Text] Why do we publish "CHENG-CHIN CHOU-PAO" ["Political Weekly"]?
 It is for the revolution.  Why do we want a revolution?  It is to liberate
 the nation of China, to realize control by the people, and to gain economic
 happiness for the people.
 For the revolution, we have offended all enemies--imperialism throughout
 the world, large and small warlords throughout the nation, the comprador
 class, local tyrants, and evil gentry of all areas, and all the reactionary
 political factions such as the An-fu, Study, Joint Control, and Nationalist
 [Kuo-chia Chu-i] Factions.  These enemies, with the development of our revo-
 lutionary force, are reenforcing their oppression and mobilizing all their
 strength for the purpose of destroying us.  They have foreign and domestic
 navies, armies and police, large international progaganda machines (Reuter,
 etc.), national newspapers, and schools.  Though there are frequent con-
 flicts among them due to differences in interest, none of them has a good
 intent toward us.
 After wiping out Yang [2799]. and Liu [0491] and eliminating Cheng [6774] and
 Mo [5459], our work in Kwangtung has reached a new era.  Canton city has
 realized peace which was unseen in the past 14 years; the people have truly
 gained the freedom to hold meetings, form associations, speak, and strike;
 there has been no coercive conscription for the eastern expeditionary
 forces; gambling has been abolished in Canton's market; military affairs and
 political administration of the entire province have been unified; financial
 administration is gradually centralized; a part of the harsh taxes harassing
 the people has been abolished, and measures for eliminating the rest have
 been decided on; policies of reform have been formulated for the civil
 affairs, judicial, education, and communication organs; the counter-revolu-
 tionary remnants of Pei River, Tung River, and Nan-lu are gradually elimin-
 ated; strikes and large-scale blockade of Hong Kong are continued to support
 the patriotic workers' movement.  We do not hide our shortcomings.  We do
 not claim that Kwangtung has been reformed--Kwangtung's reform is just be-
 ginning.  There are still many bandits disrupting law and order; there are

 still many local tyrants, evil gentry, and corrupt officials preying on
 the people; many behind-the-scene evil practices in the civil affairs,
 finance, judicial, education, and communication organs have not been
 eliminated.  We do not-say that all the defects, no?,longer exist.  We say
 that we already have a revolutionary force; we already have an opportunity
 to eliminate the bandits; we already can begin the overhauling of civil
 affairs, finance, judicial, education, and communications organs.  In sum,
 we already have a foundation for revolution.  In everything we do, we follow
 Mr Sun Yat-sen's strategy, open and clear to the eyes of the public.  Mean-
 while, Hong Kong's British imperialism, the counter-revolutionary remnants
 such as Ch'en Chiung-ming [7115 3518 2494] and Teng Pen-yin [6772 2609 3009],
 and the numerous local tyrants, evil gentry, and corrupt officials cannot
 but tremble.  Angry and indignant, they go to the extreme to curse, slander,
 and injure us.  The counter-revolutionary propaganda organs in Peking,
 Tientsin, Shanghai, and Hankow are in an uproar, and they stop at nothing
 to curse, slander, and injure us with their evil mouth and poison tongue.
 The people of the entire nation, especially those in the North and along
 the Yangtze, are confused by them and completely isolated from the true
 situation in Kwangtung.  Suspicions arise even among the comrades.. Even
 the unsuspicious elements have no factual basis to argue the case.   Such
 terms as "internal"squabble" and "communism" are spread everywhere, as if
 Kwangtung had become hell itself.
 We can no longer let it go.  We must begin to counter-attack.  "Propagan-
 dize counter-attack to the counter-revolutionaries in order to break down
 the counter-revolutionary propaganda."  This is the mission of "Cheng-chih
 Chou-pao."
 We do not need. much argument in our counter-attack of the enemies; we only
 need to report truthfully the facts of our revolutionary work.  When the
 enemies say "Kwangtung has turned communist," we say "Please look at the
 facts."  When they say "Kwangtung is squabbling internally," we say "Please
 look at the facts."  When they say "The Canton government associates with
 Russia, yields power, and disgraces the nation," we say "Please look at
 the facts."  When they say "The people under the Canton government live
 in misery," we say "Please look at the facts."
 In the structure of "Cheng-chih Chou-pao," 90 percent are factual reports,
 and only 10 percent are arguments against the propaganda of the counter-
 revolutionaries.
 Accept the truthful report of our revolutionary work;  Arise, revolutionary
 people of the entire nation:

 THE  'THREE-THREE-THREE-ONE SYSTEM'
 5 December 1925
 [Text]   "What is communism?  Confiscation of property; no private savings
 permitted; the rich and poor are both poor.  A good term is coined.  It is
 called emphasis on agriculture.  Three-three-three-one, actually it makes
 no sense.  Thirty percent to the landlord, 30 percent confiscated, 30
 percent to oneself, and 10 percent for the association."  This is the "anti-
 communist" announcement in four-word rhymes posted by Yang K'un-ju [2799
 0981 1172] inside and outside Hui-chou.  A friend of a rather clear mind
 newly arrived from Peking asked me:  "Is there actually such a thing as
 the 'three-three-three-one system'?"  I was surprised.  Before answering
 him, I thought:   "Do you suspect that the Kuomintang is practicing the
 'three-three-three-one system'?"  With an ironic expression, I answered:
 "There is, but not like what Yang K'un-ju described."  He said:   "Isn't
 the 'Hong Kong Morning News' a Kuomintang paper?  It also published it."
 Only then did I learn that the "Hong Kong Morning News" also had such odd
 ideas.  Before the revolt of Yang and Liu, the paper did have connections
 with the Kuomintang..  After the revolt of Yang and Liu and the strikes in
 Canton and Hong Kong, it was bought by Liu Chen-huan [0491 7201 1403] to
 serve as an organ of Hong Kong's foreign excellencies and the so-called
 Commander in Chief Ch'en [7115].  By taking advantage of the severance of
 communication between Canton and Hong Kong, many "facts" have emerged in
 the pages of the paper on the isolated island of Hong Kong.  "Three-three-
 three-one" was but one of the many "facts," yet it was delivered all the
 way to Peking to feast the eyes of my Peking friend.   I, therefore, thought
 that, in regard to the things in the world today, whether animate (such as
 man) or inanimate (such as a newspaper), we must not be too rigid in our
 view, because, as "revolution" and "counter-revolution" had parted company,
 the animate and inanimate things could belong to one side today and the
 other side tomorrow.  When the "Hong Kong Morning News" was with the
 Kuomintang, it served as the organ paper of the Kuomintang.  When bought
 by Hong Kong's foreign excellency Mr Liu Chen-huan and the so-called Com-
 mander in Chief Ch'en, it could only become their organ paper.  Precisely
 like Feng Tzu-yu [7458 5261 3945] and Ma Su [7456 4790], when they were
 with the Kuomintang, they were Kuomintang party members.  Once bought by

 Tuan Ch'i-jui [3008 4388 3843], though they still claimed to be members
 of the Kuomintang and labeled themselves with the "Kuomintang Club," they
 were Tuan Ch'i-jui's men.  I hold no special grudge against the "Hong Kong
 Morning News" or Messrs Feng and Ma; I only borrow this instance to warn
 my friends inside and outside the country against being tricked when observ-
 ing people and things.  As for Yang K'un-ju's announcement, his composition
 is fine, except for the phrase "it makes no sense," which spoiled his pen.
 Isn't it that one pellet of mouse dropping spoils the whole pot of soup?
 But, then it was the fault of the secretary.

 YANG K'UN-JU'S NOTICE AND LIU CHIH-LU'S CABLE
 [Text]  We have already studied Yang K'un-ju's [2799 9081 1172] announce-
 ment, but there is Liu Chih-lu's [0491 1807 7120] telegram to "Executive
 Tuan [3008], Ministers and Vice-Ministers of the Ministries, Commissioner
 Chang [1728] of Feng-t'ien, Governor Chao [6392] of Hunan, Commissioner
 Hsiao [5618] of Wu-ch'ang, Superintendent Fang [2455] of Kiangsi, Superin-
 tendent Chou [0719] of Fukien, and Messrs Ts'en Hsi-lin [1478 6007 2651],
 Wu Tzu-yu [0702 1311 3768], K'ang Nan-hai [1660 0589 3189], and Liang Jen-
 kung [2733 0117 0361]" which is slightly different.  In his "seventh count
 of the indictment," he states:  "In the society. of China, agriculture has
 always been emphasized.  The interests of the landowner and the tenant
 are always balanced.  The spirit of mutual help makes them naturally com-
 patible.  Now, the inducement of the land division theory has undermined
 the mutual benefit."  This statement conflicts with Yang K'un-ju's announce-
 ment.  According to Yang K'un-ju, "30 percent to the landlord, 30 percent
 confiscated, 30 percent to oneself, and 10 percent for the association."
 So everyone gets something, and it can be called "mutual benefit."  Yet
 Liu Chih-lu says that it is "land division," indicating that the Canton
 government tells the peasants to seize the land from the landlords and
 divide it up, and the landlords will have no rent to collect thereafter.
 Therefore, "mutual benefit'is undermined."  One says that the landlord
 still retains 30 percent, while the other says that he will have nothing
 left.  I wonder whom my friends in Peking and other areas believe.

 IF THERE IS COMMON ASPIRATION FOR COMBATING COMMUNISM, THEN MY ENEMY'S
 ENEMY IS MY GOOD FRIEND
 [Text]  After enumeration the eight counts against the National Government,
 Liu Chih-lu [0491 1807 7120] and others, in their telegram, add an "Alas:"
 paragraph and continue by stating:  "In sum, when sending troops to quell
 rebellions, punish the criminal, and save the people, if there is common
 aspiration for combating communism, then my enemy's enemy is my good friend.
 An army is strong when its cause is just.  No combat is required to determine
 the-outcome.  Those with Heaven on their side will prosper, and the right
 and wrong are not hard to distinguish."  The titled addresses of Liu's
 telegram, such as Executive Tuan [3008], the Ministers and Vice-Ministers
 of the Ministries, Commissioners, Superintendents, and Governors Chang
 [1728], Hsiao [5618], Chao [6392], Fang [2455], and Chou [0719], and Messrs
 Ts'en [1478], Wu [0702], K'ang [1660], and Liang [2733], are naturally com-
 rades with common aspirations to combat communism, but what about Governor
 (Chin) of Hong Kong and Prime Minister Baldwin in London?  Are they not also
 comrades with common aspirations to combat communism?  Yet their titles are
 not listed.  Furthermore, Governor Chin helped with such large amounts of
 money and weapons and protected the commanding headquarters set up by Com-
 mander in Chief Ch'en [7115] in Hong Kong.  His aspirations to combat com-
 munism are clear like the sun and the stars, and yet he was left out!  One
 truly cannot understand the intent!  The sentences at the end of the tele-
 gram, "an army is strong when its cause is just," etc., are even more con-
 fusing.  He is actually writing a eulogy to the National Government!

 ACCLAMATIONS WILL COME FROM ALL NATIONS
 [Text]  A Ch'ao-Mei gentry, student, and merchant joint association sent a
 telegram supporting Liu Chih-lu [0491 1807 7120], stating:  "The evil com-
 munist party brought calamity to eastern Kwangtung.  Nearby, it can sink
 China into a hopeless situation; far away, it can engulf the world and
 destroy all mankind.  Mr Liu relies on righteousness and steps forward,
 ahead of the world.   Wherever his banners point, the people will welcome
 him with broth and food.  Bringing down the rotten and destroying the
 withered, he will soon establish great merits.  (The reporter finds the
 word "soon" defective.)  Communization will be eradicated, and the founda-
 tion of the nation will be stabilized.  Not only his. achievement will rank
 with the Yunnan Uprising and the Ma-ch'ang Harangue of the Troops, but man-
 kind in the whole world will be safeguarded and the calamity of the entire
 globe will be averted.  He will be remembered a thousand years; acclamations
 will come from all nations."  Everywhere, "the whole world" and "the entire
 globe" are not forgotten.  How far-reaching is the sight!   If Liu Chih-lu
 truly eradicates "communization," "acclamations" for sure will come.  But
 whether they will come from all nations is unknown, but at least from the
 following four:  Britain, America, France, and Japan.

 'LONG LIVE THE GREAT UNION OF ANTICOMMUNIST CHINESE NATIONAL ARMY'
 [Text]  This is a slogan in the anticommunist literature distributed by
 Ch'en Chiung-ming [7115 3518 2494] in Tung-chiang.  It is truly sonorous,
 but it's a pity that it is rather difficult for the "anticommunist Chinese

 Feng-t'ien's Commissioner Chang [1728] and by Hankow's Mr Wu Tzu-yu [0702

 COMMUNIST REGULATIONS AND SHAM COMMUNISM
 [Text]   The counterrevolutionaries generally call the national revolution a
 communist revolution, the Kuomintang the communist party, the National Govern-
 ment a communist government, and the National Revolutionary Army a communist
 army.   They do so for no other purpose than to fabricate a few simple terms
 and spread them in accordance with the intent of imperialism in order to
 split the united front created through the cooperation of the various classes
 in the national revolution.  But such fabrication has to be rather abstract.
 It must not be too concrete, because they may expose themselves and lose
 their credibility.  However, for the purpose of a lucky win by one single
 throw, Ch'en Chiung-ming [7115 3518 2494], this time in Tung-chiang, ex-
 hausted all means.                    He actually fabricated the so-called "Communist By-law"
 to frighten the people.  One of their handbills, entitled "Urging the Peo-
 ple of Kwangtung To Help the Kwangtung Army Punish the Red Party," states:
 "Alas!  Do our fathers and brothers know about the Communist By-law drafted
 by Chiang Chung-cheng [Chiang Kai-shek]?  I fear that the common people,
 being ignorant, may think that sharing property means sharing the property
 of the rich and has nothing to do with the poor in general.   They may even
 think that it will greatly benefit the poor.  Actually, it is completely
 false.  I inquired into the said by-law and now generalize as follows:   The
 so-called three-three-three-one system deals with. farmland.  The so-called
 four-four-two system deals with houses.  Plants and stores with rather sub-
 stantial capital  are completely confiscated."  Nevertheless, a recent issue
 of the Hong Kong KUNG-SHANG.JIH-PAO   reported:   "The Canton merchant rep-
 resentatives came to Hong Kong, and the Hong Kong merchant representatives
 received them in the. Chinese Merchants' Club and asked them to hold a second
 general meeting to discuss the solution of strikes and resumption of com-
 munication..  Chinese businessmen and merchants and Canton merchant repre-
 sentatives all sat together at a long table.  Canton merchant representative
 Chien Ch'in-shih [4675 3830 4258] rose and made a statement, saying that
 the Canton government was actually not practicing communism."  If someone
 should ask Ch'en Chiung-ming [7115 3518 2494] about Chien Shih-ch'in's
 [4675 4258 3830.] [sic] statement, I imagine he will say:  "Chien Shih-ch'in
 told a lie.  When others took away his property to share, he still insisted
 that it was not taken away."

 You must not obliterate everything just because others say that the old com-
 rades are non-revolutionary.  Had our comrades not persevered after every
 setback, there would not have been the republic.  Had the campaigns to fight
 Yuan [5913], defend the law, punish the bandits, and attack the North not
 been victorious, there would not have been today's history.  Even in the
 burning of the commercial groups, the masterpiece work of the communists, we
 still had to rely on Yang [2799] and Liu [0491].  To hit Yang and Liu, we
 still had to rely on Hsu [6079] and Liang [27332.  Even the restraining of
 Hsu and Liang today, it is still the old comrades."  Excellent!  Mr Tsou!
 Please go ahead and revolutionize!  Actually no one has the skill to obliter-
 ate the revolutionary old comrades!  You must know that "the republic" and
 "history" alone do not count.  We must prosecute the revolution now;  we
 must prosecute,the revolution in the future.  As for old comrades Yang and
 Liu, or old comrades Hsu and Liang, I think it is better not to give so many
 examples.

 [Text]  In the past 6 months, some people have been advocating a theory:
 The left is not good, nor is the right.  Another group has proposed an inter-
 mediate opinion:  They reject the left as well as the right and indicate that
 they, themselves, take the middle position.  Such things are not often seen
 in Kwangtung, but quite widespread in Kiangsu and Chekiang.  The reason is
 that, in Kwangtung, the left is Canton and the right is Hong Kong.  Stand-
 ing under the banner of Canton, he inevitably opposes Hong Kong, and vice
 versa.  Ch'en Chiung-ming [7115 3518 2494] leads the counterrevolutionary
 military, politicians, comprador class, local tyrants, and evil gentry  and
 stands under the banner of Hong Kong, while the Kuomintang leftwing leads
 the workers, peasants,. soldiers, students, merchants, and all types of rev-
 olutionary masses and stands under the banner of  Canton.   Therefore, they
 mutually attack each other with artillery.   There can be no intermediate
 in the midst of such mutual attack.  If there is such an intermediate ele-
 ment, he can only cover himself up and hide under the banner of one side,
 speaking quietly and treading lightly.  If there is someone standing be-
 tween Canton and Hong Kong, he will have to declare that "Hong Kong is no
 good and Canton is also no good."  Then, Hong Kong will train its artillery
 on him, and so will Canton.  Currently, there has not yet been any incident
 of mutual attack with artillery  in in the Kiangsu-Chekiang area, and there-
 fore, the theory of "both sides no good" flourishes.  On 30 May this year,
 the artillery of side A rumbled in the Nanking area, but luckily side B
 had no artillery.  Just fists alone could not become "mutual attack," and
 no chaos resulted.   (Strikes did not amount to much). The theory of "both
 sides no good", can still be openly spread, "retaining righteousness between
 the two and saving freedom between heaven and earth." However, if we set
 up a hypothetical situation, if the masses on Nanking Road had generals as
 well as fists, and were led by Wang Ching-wei [3076 4737 5898] and Chiang
 Kil-shek, then, when the police station was levelled by artillery, they
 could immediately occupy the Bureau of Works, capture all the turbaned
 policement, blockade Wu-sung Harbor, mount artillery in Nan-pei-t'ang
 and Shih-tzu-lin (similar to Hu-men), and hoist the banner against imperial-
 ism over the artillery positions.  By then, Shanghai would unfortunately
 be in a "chaos," similar to Canton.   A garrison headquarters would be set

 up and those like Mr Wang Mao-kung [3769 2021 0501] would be asked to serve
 as the commander who would then ride around in an armored car every day on
 the streets.  The "Shih-shih Hsin-pao" and its like would be allowedto pub-
 lish again (perhaps also the "Hsing-shih Chou-pao").  Only the majority would
 be permitted to enjoy the freedom of speech, and the freedom of the minor-
 ity would have to be deprived, exactly the opposite of before.  By then, the
 intermediate elements, as in Canton, would not be able to spread their theory
 openly.  What should they do?  Naturally, there would still be Peking.  But
 they could not rely on Peking for long.  It would be contingent on the sta-
 bility of Executive Tuan.[2008].  As long as he remained in power, there
 would be no problem.  Not only could the Kuomintang Comrades' Club hoist
 its sign high, but even the Fourth General Central Committee could hold its
 meeting there.  It would be even more liberal than in Changchiakou.  While
 we say this, I am still somewhat confused.  How come Changchiakou does not
 permit the Fourth Central Committee to hold a meeting?  Isn't it also under
 the jurisdiction of the Tuan government?  If the Executive Tuan is not there--
 Wait a minute!.                    Even when Executive Tuan is there, there can be unforeseen
 incidents.  Did we not hear that two persons were kidnapped and put into
 an automobile, taken into the city and beaten up, and forced to write state-
 ments of repentance?  Alas!  Such disturbances could happen even under the
 rule of Executive Tuan!  The affairs of the world are truly difficult to  .
 determine!  Even more distressing:  According to the telegram of the Peking
 Executive Department, a revolutionary movement occurred on 28 November and
 the urban residents laid siege to the Executive Residence, demanding the
 ouster of Tuan Ch'i-jui [3008 4388 3843].  It also said that the National
 Congress decided on three items, and the first was to organize a national
 government.   (Most unfortunate!  Naturally it will be similar to Canton!).
 Then, according to Reuter, "there was a demonstration in Peking on the 28th.
 The students carried the banner of Canton, the workers displayed red flags,
 but no national flag was seen.   The demonstrators scattered handbills, de-
 manding to overthrow Tuan Ch'i-jui, punish Chu Shen [2612 3234], execute
 the traitors, dissolve the customs conference, arm the people, carry out
 mass revolution, organize a true national congress, etc."  The "Shin-shih
 Hsin-pao" headlined the telegram "Frightening Demonstration!"  What's to be
 done?  A "frightening demonstration" happened here!  If, in the future, a
 "national government" is actually organized and the "Canton banner" is
 hoisted high over the roof of that government, will it not result in a
 "chaos" similar to Canton?  Not just this alone, but the "chaos" may spread
 to the entire country, imitated everywhere.  The majority may rise to gain
 their "freedom" and arbitrarily deprive the minority of their freedom.
 Gentlemen who stand in the middle!  What should you do?  To the left?  Or
 to the right?

 they go."  Thus, communization is caring for  the people.  Communization--
 wish it would spread throughout China!

 [Text] Among Chen Chiung-ming's [7115 3518 2494] anti-communist literature,
 there is the article:  "Respectfully Advise Young Students."  The last few
 sentences of this article read;  "Communist Party policy also calls for
 exterminating the intellectual class.  You young students are, after all,
 grouped in the intellectual class.  Upon triumph of the Communist Party,...
 [one word  indistinct] intends to kill the intellectual young students one
 by one."  In order to see whether Chen Chiung-ming's words are right or
 wrong, it would be necessary, first of all, to analyze the position of the
 Chinese intellectual class.  We feel that those individuals with intellig-
 ence should not be classified as a social class.  We should recognize them
 only as knowledgeable persons.  The reason for this is that they do not have
 a common interest which would assure their unity as a class.  Among them,
 some have become secretaries or staffers to Chang Tso-lin [1728 0155 7207],
 Wu Pei-fu [0702 0160 1318], Chen Chiung-ming and their like; and others
 have performed as attorneys or clerks for Chang...[word indistinct] [1728],
 Mu Ou-chu [4476 5665 0443], Chen...[word indistinct] -po [7115 .... 0130].
 They say peasants should not demand rent reduction and workers should not
 strike.  At the same time, however, some intellectuals have joined the ranks
 of the worker-peasant class.
 Accordingly, we can see that each knowledgeable person is merely an intel-
 lectual. As an inevitable consequence of modern industrial development,
 these intellectuals have long lost the dignity and assurance of their so-
 called occupational freedom, and have been downgraded temporarily from
 intermediate class to proletariat.  As such, they must devote themselves
 wholeheartedly to the worker-peasant movement.  If they should forget their
 own position in the current society and choose to reverse themselves to
 serve warlords, compradores, and local despots, then, these knowledgeable
 youths may be regarded as dead.  By whose hands do they perish?  They are
 wasted directly by warlords,  compradores, and local despots; and. indirectly
 they are poisoned by imperialism.

 PEKING RIGHTIST CONFERENCE,AND IMPERIALISM
 [Text] Imperialists abhor the Canton Central Executive Committee of the
 leftist Kuomintang which has assumed general command over the nationwide
 anti-imperialist movement to strike terror among all imperialists.  The
 Peking rightist conference adopted a resolution to cease the functions of
 the Canton Central Executive Committee.  Imperialists abhor the Kuomintang
 Political Committee which can exercise power to direct the Kwangtung and
 Hong Kong strikes and to eradicate such useful tools to them as Yang Hsi-
 min [2799 1585 7063], Liu Chen-huan [0491 7201 1403], Liang Hung-kai [2733

 Hsiung Ko-wu [3574 0344 2976].  The Peking rightist conference resolved to
 dismiss the Political Committee.   Imperialists abhor Kuomintang leftist
 leader Wang Ching-wei [3076 4737 5898] who leads the national revolution
 in an all-out campaign against imperialism; and the Peking rightist con-
 ference resolved to expel Wang Ching-wei from Party membership.   Imperialists
 abhor Soviet Russian assistance to the Kuomintang and Nationalist Govern-
 ment employment of Russian advisers. to enhance their power to attack imperial-
 ism; and the Peking rightist conference resolved to dischange Russian adviser
 Borodin.   Imperialists abhor Kuomintang acceptance of Communist Party mem-
 bers to acquire a major force opposing imperialism; and the Peking right-
 ist conference resolved to expel Li Ta-chao [2621 1129 6856], Tan Ping-shan
 [6223 1627 1472], and others from Party membership.  Observing all this,
 we can see what the Peking rightist conference has done for imperialism.

 [Text]  As described before, the Peking rightist conference has performed
 various tasks to meet the requirements of imperialism.  It is, however, the
 final method used by imperialism against the Chinese anti-imperialist move-
 ment.                     Imperialist tools Yang Hsi-min [2799 1585 7036] and Liu Chen-huan
 [0419 7201 1403] were ineffective in their attempt to overthrow the Canton
 government on behalf of the current Peking rightist conference.   Imperial-
 ist tools Liang Hung-kai [2733 7703 2261], Cheng Jun-chi [6774 3387 3823],
 Wei Pang-ping [7614 6721 1726], Mo Hsiung [5459 7160], Chu Cho-wen [2612
 0587 2429], and others were also ineffective in carrying out the goal of
 the current Peking rightist conference after the assassination of Liao
 Chung-kai [1675 0112 19561.  Imperialist tool Hsiung Ko-wu [3574 0344 2976]
 also failed in his attempt to capture Canton from Pei-chiang on behalf of
 the current Peking rightist conference.  Imperialist tool Tuan Chi-jui
 [3008 4388 3842] likewise did not succeed in his attempt to attack Canton
 by warships from Hu-meng.   Imperialist tools Chen Chiung-ming [7115 3518
 2494] and Teng Pen-yin  [6772 2609 3009] also failed in their attempt to
 fight into Canton from the east and the south, on behalf of the current
 Peking rightist conference.  All these imperialist tools were ineffectual in
 what they did.   The Kuomintang rightists, aroused in indignation, thus
 called the Peking conference.  From "Attack by guns," they clanged to the
 "Resolutions" method.
 What is the effect of this method?  It is difficult to say.  The various
 resolutions of the rightist conference, to be sure, are only childish
 resolutions.  This method of "opposition within the next" is truly a pro-
 gression from "opposition outside the next."  After it has exhausted all
 tools, imperialism has found this last tool to gain a small consolation
 in their failure.
 Although a few among the rightists may talk about opposing imperialism,
 although they may serve imperialism without sincerity, and although they

 may deny that they have become imperialist tooks, nevertheless, they are
 in fact effectively helping imperialism.  In reality, they have become im-
 perialist tools, because their work meets the requirements of imperialism.

 THE MOST THE RIGHTISTS CAN DO
 [Text]  The 3 December editorial of the rightist Shanghai MIN-KUO JIH-PAO
 stated:  "There are only warlords who fear the revolutionary party, but not
 a revolutionary party which fears warlords."  With this as the rationale, the
 editorial opposed the following passage in the telegram sent by Wang Ching-
 wei [3076 4737 5895] and others:  "A plenary session of the Central Committee
 is open by nature.  Should it meet in Peking, there would be pressure from
 warlords from without, and reactionaries from within using warlords to cre-
 ate problems."  MIN-KUO JIH-PAO thus alleged that it would be a show of
 courage and of disregard of warlords for the plenary session of the Central
 Committee to meet in Peking.
 What is the mistake of MIN-KUO JIH-PAO?  The mistake lies in ignorance of
 the fact that there is a difference between the overt and covert activities
 of a revolutionary party.  Operating under the enemy influence, a truly
 revolutionary party would maintain complete secrecy with regard to its
 party organizations and meetings, but would openly advocate its proposals
 and conduct propaganda.  Under the enemy influence, it is necessary to ob-
 tain prior enemy understanding in order to make public the party organiza-
 tions and meetings.   In other words, there would be at least a few points
 benefiting the enemy before the enemy would grant consent or even possibly
 protection.  However, what would the party be then?  It would become a
 friend of the enemy, instead of a revolutionary party aimed against the
 enemy.   Tuan Chi-jui 13008 4388 2976] permitted the rightists to hold their
 conference in Peking.  Would he also allow Wang Ching-wei, Tan Yen-kai
 [6223 1693 0418], and others to publicly go to Peking to attend the con-
 ference?
 The newspaper also claimed that Premier Sun visited Peking last year with-
 out fearing Tuan Chi-jui.   It ignored the two reasons which made it pos-
 sible for Premier Sun to visit Peking last year:  One, Tuan Chi-jui was
 then new in power, and had neither consolidated his regime nor adopted
 the policy to oppress the Kuomintang.   Two, control of the police in Peking
 was then in the hands of Feng Yu-hsiang [7458 3768 4382], who was sympathetic

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 to the Kuomintang.  Without these two reasons, it would have been impossible
 for Mr Sun to openly go to Peking.   If Mr Sun lived today, Tuan Chi-jui
 certainly would not tolerate his open revolutionary activities in Peking.
 He must maintain secrecy, or go elsewhere.
 In Peking and other areas throughout the coutitry where warlords are in con-
 trol, there are Kuomintang organizations, and party headquarters have organ-
 izations everywhere.  Party members and comrade cadres have meetings at all
 times, as they also bravely engage in efforts striving to eliminate the
 enemy influence.  All this, however, is secret.   In these organizations and
 activities, only the leftists are waging incessant struggle, while the
 rightist party members invariably are seized by fear and dare not to move.
 The strong point of rightists is that they can talk, and recite such slogans
 as "Down with imperialism" and "Down with warlords" without referring to
 party resolutions.  Once they learn about realistic methods and actions,
 they immediately lose heart.  The rightists have only their mouth, but not
 hands or feet.  They have courage to hold a conference in front of Tuan
 Chi-jui, but would not dare to attend a conference in Canton, because they
 fear the revolutionary air of Canton.  They have decided to hold their so-
 called Second National Congress in March next year in either Shanghai or
 Peking.  My observation is that even if they can call the meeting (regardless
 of the number of those attending), they may not dare to hold it in Peking,
 since the court of Tuan is unstable.  They probably would meet in Shanghai.
 In the old next of imperialism, they would openly hold the Kuomintang Nation-
 al Conference in front of foreign lords of various foreign consulates and
 police forces, and thus show off their "courage."  The most the rightists
 can do is to openly hold conferences in front of warlords and imperialists.
 The leftists can never match that!

 owned by Yeh Chu-tsang [5509 2806 3318] and others.  After the first nation-
 al congress, the Party assumed management, invested several tens of thous-
 ands yuan in expansion, and subsequently subsidized monthly 2,500 to 3,000
 yuan.  However, it has never been a true party newspaper, and has contained
 much absurd statements and reportage.  Following the Hsi-shan Conference,
 it became a mouthpiece of the reactionaries.
 (2)   Canton MIN-KUO JIH-PAO. This was sponsored by the Canton Municipal
 Party Headquarters and came under the administration of the Central Prop-
 aganda Department in October 1926.  The circulation increased from over
 1,000 to over 11,000.
 (3) Canton KUO-MIN HSIN-WEN.  This was a mouthpiece of reactionaries.  Af-

 provincial party-headquarters.  It now circulates over 7,500 copies
 daily.
 (4) HSIANG-CHIANG CHEN-PAO.  Under party management at one time, it later
 defected to the enemy party.  It has now ceased publication.

 and "Chien-kuo-fang-lueh":  collections of speeches by other comrades such
 as Mr Wang; and about five books compiled by the Central Propaganda Depart-
 ment) with the total circulation of 393,959 copies.   The dissemination
 concentrated, however, in Kwangtung.
 (2) Local--Information and statistics unavailable.
 (VI)  Handbills
 '(1) Central--The Central Propaganda Department has issued 83 varieties of
 handbills, but distribution has been limited to Kwangtung.
 (2) Local--Information and statistics unavailable.
 (VII)   Posters
 (1) Central.  In Canton, the Central Propaganda Department has' cooperated
 with the.Canton Public Security Bureau in producing two types of posters:
 one nailed to electric wire poles, and the other written on walls.  Content
 of the these posters has been derived from the Declaration of the First
 National Congress and the speeches of late Mr Sun.
 (2) Armies.  The First, Second, Third, and Fourth Army of the National
 Revolutionary Army, the Navy, the Huangpu Military Academy, and the mili-
 tary officers schools of the Second and Third Army have all issued posters
 through their political departments in considerable quantity with great
 effect.
 (3) Various mass organizations.  In Kwangtung, the peasant and worker organ-
 izations have issued a considerable number of posters.
 Pictorial Propaganda
 (1) Importance of Pictorial Propaganda
 More than 90 percent of Chinese are illiterate.  Only a small portion of
 the masses in the country are accessible through the written propaganda of
 this Party.  Pictorial propaganda is therefore of particular importance.
 (II)   Past Accomplishments
 (1) Central.  Started only in April last year,  with little done and lim-
 ited to Kwangtung, in the following three categories:
 (A) Provide four cartoons weekly to Canton MIN-KUO JIH-PAO (with omissions
 sometimes).
 (B) Propaganda pictures once a week (sometimes once every 2 or 3 weeks)

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 (C) Small photographs of Mr Sun Chung-shan and Mr Liao Chung-kai.
 (2) Armies.  Political departments of various armies have issued consider-
 able pictorial propaganda materials, especially under combat conditions.
 Wherever the troops are on the march, they post many pictorial propaganda
 materials, which have considerable influence among the masses.
 (3) Various mass organizations.  The Kwangtung peasant and worker organi-
 zations have promoted considerable pictorial propaganda to mobilize the
 worker-peasant masses.  Some pictorial propaganda work has also been done
 in Peking and Shanghai.
 Oral Propaganda
 (1) Oral propaganda has an important position in our propaganda effort,
 in terms of quantity and effect.
 (2) At meetings of peasants, workers, soldiers, and students, we have
 regularly promoted oral propaganda by delivering speeches of all descrip-
 tions.
 (3) As extemporaneous oral propaganda, we have delivered speeches at var-
 ious demonstration for political change.  The Central Party headquarters
 has organized propaganda teams on several occasions. During and after the
 30 May movement, large-scale organized propaganda campaigns were promoted
 in various provinces and large cities.
 (4) At meetings of party members, responsible comrades have delivered poli-
 tical and party reports to educate comrades within the party.  At the
 Premier Sun weekly memorial meeting, the Party Central headquarters regular-
 ly promotes oral propaganda.
 Propaganda on 14 Important Events During the Last Two Years
 (1) Reorganization of this Party.  We promulgated the declaration of poli-
 tical program to proclaim opposition to imperialism and its adjuncts, re-
 sulting in:
 (A) Enabling the masses to understand this Party and the goal of this Party,
 and to change their former attitude of skepticism of this Party.  This is
 extremely effective in propaganda outside the Party.
 (B) Unifying objectives and methods within the Party, and gradually clean-
 ing out those who harbor personal or minority goals and methods.                      This also
 has considerable effect in terms of education within the Party.
 (2) Repossession of Canton Customs House.  This anti-imperialist propa-
 ganda made clear the break between imperialism and this Party.  It was ef-
 fective in terms of propaganda.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 (3) The anti-imperialist strike in Shan-mien.
 (4) Commercial Organization Incident.  We helped the masses to recognize
 crimes committed by the compradore class.  In this incident, this party's
 propaganda effort was inadequate, while the counterrevolutionaries were
 very enthusiastic in their attack against this party.
 (5) Sino-Russian Agreement.  Our compatriots have learned the difference be-
 tween imperialist countries and anti-imperialist countries, among nations.
 Anti-imperialist alliances rose in Peking and other areas.  The slogan
 "Oppose imperialism" has begun to be accepted by the masses.  To this end,
 our Party has issued a statement.
 (6) Anti-Hopeh Campaign.  The masses have lost faith in this power warlord.
 Mr Sun promulgated the Declaration of the Northern Expedition.
 (7) Premier Traveled North.  The Statement on Travel North pointed out two
 slogans:  "Hold National Conference" and "Abrogate Unequal Treaties."
 (8) Movement to Promote National Conference.  Opposition to Tuan Chi-jui
 resulted in the masses losing faith in Tuan's fence-mending conference.  At
 the same time, the masses have further realized the political proposals of
 this party.  During this campaign, the two slogans:  "Hold National Con-
 ference" and "Abrogate Unequal Treaties" have gained greater acceptance
 among the masses.
 (9) Campaign for memorial of the Premier.  It helped the masses to under-
 stand Mr Sun, this Party, and the goal of this party.   This extensive
 memorial campaign spread far and wide, extending to remote and secluded
 areas.  The two slogans of "Hold National Conference" and "Abrogate Unequal
 Treaties" have thus penetrated further among the masses.  At this time,
 this party  issued the statement severing contact with Tuan Chi-jui.
 (10) 30 May Movement.  An unprecedented anti-imperialist movement in which
 specific meanings were mentioned for abrogating the unequal treaties, such
 as repossess concessions, customs house, and judiciary; and evacuation of
 foreign navies and armies stationed in China.  Through this, the masses
 recognized what are the unequal treaties.  This movement failed under ex-
 treme pressure exerted by the Liaoning warlords.  There was, however, one
 accomplishment:  the Shanghai workers have risen.  In terms of propaganda,.
 the movement was very effective for the rural masses have universally come
 to know that this party has issued a declaration to support the people in
 resisting imperialism.
 (11) Liao Case.  The masses realized the brutality of imperialists and
 their lackeys.  Through memorial services, and written and pictorial ma-
 terials, this party has promoted considerable propaganda.

 (12) Anti-Liao-ning Campaign.  We helped the masses to learn the relation-
 ship between imperialism and their tool, the Chinese warlords; and to
 recognize the. rapid collapse of Chinese warlords.  In the course of this
 campaign, the masses felt a closeness to the success of the revolution.  In
 the movement opposing Tuan in various areas, slogans were introduced to
 initiate direct clash against the local warlords, such as the Peking masses'
 slogan of "Expel Tuan Chi-jui," Wuhan masses' slogan "Expel Pei-fu," and
 Changsha masses' slogan "Down with Chao Heng-ti [6392 1854 1912]."  The
 masses have changed their former peaceful attitude into a tense revolutionary
 atmosphere.
 (13) Anti-religious Movement.  During the last 2 years, anti-Christian
 organizations and propaganda have spread throughout the country to enable
 the masses to'be aware of the imperialist religious aggression.
 (14) Political education in peace time and political propaganda in war time
 among troops.  The political education promoted by this party in Huangpu Mili-
 tary Academy and National Revolutionary Army has created a military force
 against imperialism.  The propagara for military-civilian unity as launched
 in various campaigns in Kwangtung has assured that the troops love and pro-
 tect the people, and that the people support the troops.  This has been a
 great success of this party.
 Enemy Propaganda
 Part of our propaganda, by necessity, must aim at the enemy's propaganda.
 Now we should take a look at the antirevolutionary propaganda waged by the
 enemy during the last 2 years.
 (1) Imperialism.  During the last 2 years, since this party has particularly
 heightened the anti-imperialist propaganda, the imperialist propaganda to
 calumniate this party has also been especially fierce.  The imperialists
 raised the two slogans of "Oppose communism" and "Red imperialism" to call
 on their tools in China, bureaucrats, warlords, compradores, and local despots
 to attack this party.  Foreign newspapers and foreign news agencies in Hong
 Kong,   Shanghai, Tientsin, Shenyang, and Hankou have created rumors to
 caluminate and sow dissension, and have tried their utmost wherever they can.
 (2) Warlords of all factions.  Warlords of all sizes and factions in the
 country invariably support and expand the two slogans issued by imperialists
 (Oppose communism, Red imperialism).
 (3) Compradore Class.  Besides their anti-revolutionary propaganda, this
 group has shown greater effort than any other counterrevolutionary faction.
 The Hong Kong KUNG-SHANG JIH-PAO and Shanghai HSIN-WEN-PAO are representative.
 (4) Research Faction.  They uphold the interest of bureaucrats and large
 landlords, and also engage in counterrevolutionary propaganda.  SHIH-SHIH,
 HSIW-WEN and CHEN-PAO are representative.

 (5) An-fu Faction.  They represent Japanese imperialism and likewise engage
 in counterrevolutionary propaganda.  HSIN-SHENG-PAO is representative.
 (6) LIEN-CHIH-PAI.  They support'the interest of bureaucrats and landlords,
 and.also promote counterevolutionary propaganda.  CHUNG-HUA HSIN-PAO is
 representative.
 (7) Nationalist Faction.  They have acquired some trappings of Western na-
 tionalism to support the interest of small landlords and the Chinese indus-
 trial and commercial bourgeoisie, and are very enthusiastic in "opposing
 communism" and "opposing Soviet Russia."  HSIN-SHIH WEEKLY is representative.
 (8) Right-wing Kuomintang.  After the HSI-SHAN Conference, the right wing
 of this party has also acquired the slogans "oppose communism" and "oppose
 Soviet Russia," and has competed against the above other counterrevolution-
 ary factions in their hostile attitude toward this party.  Shanghai MIN-KUO
 JIH-PAO is their representative.
 In the mutual antagonism between revolutionary propaganda and counter-
 revolutionary propaganda during the last 2 years, the revolutionary prop-
 aganda has adopted an offensive.  This offensive was particularly illus-
 trative during the 30 May Movement.  The counterrevolutionary propaganda has
 consistently been defensive.  When they could not cope with the offensive,
 they resorted to the slogans "Oppose communism" and "Red imperialism" as
 protective covers.   This phenomenon of antagonistic offensive and defensive
 came as a result of the Chinese revolutionary force daily enhancement of
 unity and progress, while the  counterrevolutionary force became increas-
 ingly more shaky and leaned toward collapse.
 The following defects have been discovered in the propaganda work during the
 last 2 years:
 (1) Party newspapers are faulty.
 (2) Propaganda on various important events lacks promptness in guidance and
 falls short of full coverage.
 (3) The command system is imperfect.  There is a lack of coordination,be-
 tween the upper and lower level party headquarters, leading to an each-
 for-himself situation.  Consequently, many responsible persons of the propa-
 ganda department have abandoned their duties.
 (4) Inspection and correction were completely ignored.
 (5) Sufficient collection of propaganda materials and supply of them to lower
 level party headquarters have not been done.

 (6) There was little evidence of planned education within the party.
 (7) More stress was on urban masses than on general masses, more on written
 propaganda than on pictorial propaganda.
 The above are all major defects in the propaganda work of this party.  Each
 should be corrected in the future.

 ANALYSIS OF THE VARIOUS STRATA OF CHINESE PEASANTRY AND THEIR ATTITUDE TOWARD
 REVOLUTION
 January 1926
 [Text]  Wherever you go in rural areas, as you carefully observe, you will
 see the following eight different categories of persons:
 Big landlords
 Small landlords
 Owner peasants
 Semi-owner peasants
 Semi-hired peasants
 Poor peasants
 Hired peasants and rural handicraft workers
 Vagabonds
 These eight categories of persons are divided into eight classes.  Their
 financial positions and living.conditions vary, and affect their psychology
 and their differing views regarding revolution.
 A large number of large landlords in China come from decendents of former
 Ching Dynasty bureaucrats and current bureaucrats and. warlords, while a
 small number of them are rich urban merchants who purchased land.  Very
 few big landlords built up their fortune through farming.  They base their
 interest on severe exploitation of owner-peasants, semi-owner peasants,
 semi-hired peasants, poor peasants, and hired peasants.   There are five
 methods of exploitation.   First is heavy rent, varying between 50 to 80 per-
 cent.   This is a very common and ruthless exploitation of the semi-owner
 peasants, semi-hired peasants, and poor peasants.   The second is usury,
 with the monthly interest rate at 3 to 7 percent, and the annual interest
 at 36 to. 84 percent.   This exploitation also applies to semi-owner peasants,
 semi-hired peasants, and poor peasants.  This is sometimes an even more
 ruthless exploitation than heavy rent, and often results in complete bank-
 ruptcy within a few years due to accumulation of debts and compounding of
 interest.   The third is heavy contributions, using pressure to force the
 owner-peasants and semi-owner peasants to offer contributions to the

 expenses of local defense regiments according to acreage owned.  Such local
 defense regiments are landlord class armies needed for suppressing peasant
 uprisings to maintain the landlord class exploiting system.  The fourth is
 exploitation of hired peasants, that is, exploiting their surplus labor. In
 China, however, there is not much capitalist agriculture yet.  Big landlords
 usually do not manage land themselves.  For this reason, more small land-
 lords than big landlords employ this form of exploitation.  The fifth form
 of exploitation is that used by warlords in collusion with corrupt bureau-
 crats to levy heavy land taxes and demand high interest from peasants who
 are unable to pay on time.  It is impossible to describe the miseries of
 peasants suffering from these five types of exploitation.  The Chinese big
 landlords are, therefore, the deadly enemies of Chinese peasants, the true
 rules in the countryside, the solid foundation of imperialists and warlords,
 only stronghold of feudal patriarch society, and the ultimate reason for
 emergence of all counterrevolutionary forces.  Estimated on the basis of
 collecting yield from over 500 mou, the number of big landlords (including
 their families) account for about one-tenth of 1 percent among peasants.
 Among the 320,000,000 peasants in the country (estimated at 80 percent of
 the population), they total about 320,000.
 The small landlords are much more numerous than the big landlords, totalling
 more than 2 million in the country.  Most of them come from their own farms,
 that is, they rose from owner-peasants.  Some of them are urban merchants
 who bought land, and others are degenerate decendents of bureaucrats and
 current petty-bureaucrats.  They employ heavy rent, usury, and exploitation
 of surplus labor as methods of exploitation.  They suffer from oppression
 by warlords and big landlords, and are therefore rebellious.  They also,
 however, fear "communism," and thus adopt a contradictory attitude toward
 modern revolution.  In our country, high intellectuals such as teachers and
 students in colleges and higher schools, as well as students studying in
 Japan and the West, are mostly from small landlord families.  They advocate
 the so-called nationalism.  The reason is that small landlords are the medium-
 properties class in China with an ambition to attain the,position of big
 bourgeoisie and to establish a nation ruled by one class.  Beset by foreign
 capital and oppression by warlords, they need revolution.  They are, how-
 ever, also skeptical about revolution since in the modern Chinese revolution-
 ary movement, there is within the country wholehearted participation of the
 national proletariat and, internationally, vigorous support by the inter-
 national proletariat.  There is a true Tai Chi-t'ao's [2071 1323 7118]
 disciple (by his own description) who states in PEKING CHEN-PAO:   "Raise
 your left hand to strike down imperialists and your right hand against the
 communist party."  This is a vivid illustration of the contradictory and
 frightened attitude of this class.  They oppose interpretation of people's
 livelihood principle by class struggle and object to Kuomintang association
 with Russia and acceptance of communists.   These constitute the right wing
 of the Chinese medium-properties class.  They are inclined to lean toward
 a counterrevolutionary position.  There is, however, also a left wing in
 the medium-properties class which at the proper moment can be led toward

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 revolution.   For instance, at the height of the peasant association movement,
 the leftists among small landlords can be guided to help peasant associations.
 By nature, they compromise easily, since they are related by blood to the
 right wing of small landlords, and are strangers to peasant associations.
 We cannot expect them to come forward bravely to the revolutionary road
 and to devote themselves faithfully to the revolutionary cause as other
 classes do, except for the small number of them who are molded differently
 by history and circumstances.
 The owner-peasants belong to petty-bourgeoisie and subdivide into three
 categories.   In the first category, there are owner-peasants who have sur-
 plus cash and provisions.  Besides providing for themselves, there is a
 surplus every year in their income from labor performed, usable as prelimin-
 ary accumulation of capital.  These persons harbor a strong concept of
 "prosperity."  While they do not vainly hope for great prosperity, they
 always attempt to climb up to the position of small landowner.  They usually.
 envy those small property owners who enjoy respectability, and devoutly wor-
 ship Marshal Chao-kung.  They are timid,   afraid of bureaucracy, and also
 somewhat fear revolution.  Since their financial position approximates that of
 the small landlords of the intermediate properties class, they subscribe
 to such propaganda as "Beware of radical party" and "Beware of communism,"
 as propagated by those "elderly," "honorable," and "respected" small land-
 lords in the countryside.                 These words of advice for caution, to be sure,
 originate from the "seniors" and the "lords" among the landlords.  These
 persons with surplus cash and provisions constitute the right wing of petty-
 bourgeoisie.   Before they learn the truth about modern revolution, they adopt
 a skeptical attitude.  They are, however, a minority among owner-peasants,
 amounting to perhaps less than 10 percent of the total.   In China, the num-
 ber of owner-peasants, some say, exceed the total of hired peasants and
 farm laborers.  Excluding the semi-owner peasants, however, they certainly
 account for only a minority among peasants, totalling about 100 to 120 mil-
 lion.  The well-to-do                 portion among owner-peasants account for about 10
 percent, or a total of 12 million.
 The second category of owner-peasants are barely self-sufficient..   Their
 annual income and expenditures are balanced without surplus or deficit.
 While these owner-peasants are quite different from those of the first cate-
 gory, they likewise long for prosperity.  Marshal Chao Kung, however, has .
 never granted them wealth.  In the wake of oppression and exploitation per-
 petrated by imperialists, warlords, and landlords in recent years, they
 feel that the world is not what it used to be.   They realize that by con-
 tinuing the same amount of labor as they did before, they would not be able
 to maintain their livelihood.  They must increase their time at work, that
 is, start earlier and stop later every day, and pay greater attention to
 production before they can maintain. their livelihood.  They curse others,
 denouncing foreigners as "devils," warlords as "money grabbers," and local
 despots as "the filthy rich."  They are skeptical whether the movement
 against imperialists and warlords will ever succeed (their rationale:

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 foreigners and the military are more powerful), and thus would not dare to
 participate.  They adopt a neutral attitude, but would never oppose revo-
 lution.  This portion of owner-peasants are numerous, accounting for about
 one-half of all owner-peasants, or nearly 60,000,000 persons.
 The third category of owner-peasants are those who-show a deficit year after
 year.  Many of these owner-peasants were formerly the so-called solid, honest
 persons who gradually turn more reserved and deficient.  At the year-end
 accounting, they are alarmed at every occasion and would declare:  "Well,
 another deficit."  Since they lived well, before their gradual decline and
 accrument of debts, they begin to realize "the future is uncertain and frigh-
 tening."  They are miserable in spirit, for they tend to contrast the pres-
 ent and the past. These persons are rather important to the revolution and
 can contribute to its progress.  They number about 40 percent of owner-
 peasants, or 48,000,000 persons.   A sizeable mass, they constitute the left-
 wing of petty-bourgeoisie.
 In time of peace, the afore-described three categories of owner-peasants
 hold different attitudes toward modern Chinese revolution.  Once at war,
 that is, at. the high tide of revolution when the dawn of victory is visible,
 not only the left wing owner-peasants in the third category would immediately
 join the revolution, but the neutral owner-peasants of the second category
 would also participate in revolution.  Pressured by hired peasants and the
 leftwing owner-peasants, even the rightist owner-peasants in the first
 category would also go along with revolution.  Accordingly, the petty-
 bourgeois owner-peasants can all turn to favor revolution.
 The semi-owner peasants, semi-hired peasants, and farm laborers number about
 150,000,000 to 170,000,000 among Chinese peasantry.  Separately, semi-owner
 peasants account for about 50,000,000, while semi-hired peasants and farm
 laborers each account for 60,000,000.  They constitute the huge masses in
 the countryside.  Most of the so-called peasant problems concern them.  While
 all three categories of peasants are among the semi-proletariat, their
 financial conditions differ.   The semi-owner peasants live a more miserable
 life than the owner-peasants, since the former must rent farmland from others
 or engage in small business to make up the difference in their deficit of
 provisions.   They must incur debt and borrow grain at high interest rates
 during the season between spring and summer, while the owner-peasants would
 not have to depend on others.  The semi-owner peasants nevertheless are bet-
 ter off than the semi-hired peasants who own no land and must work on others'
 farmland to receive only half of the harvest.  While the semi-owner peasants
 also receive only half or less on the farmland which they rent from others,
 they can receive the entire harvest from the land which they own.  Accord-
 ingly, the semi-owner peasants are more revolutionary than the owner-peasants,
 but less so than the semi-hired peasants.
 The semi-hired peasants and farm laborers are both hired peasants in the
 countryside, and suffer from landlord exploitation, although their financial

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 positions differ.   The semi-hired peasants do not own land, but they have
 adequate farm tools and some liquid capital.  Peasants in this group can
 receive one half of their annual productive labor.   They make up for the
 deficit by growing miscellaneous grains, catching fish and shrimp, and keep-
 ing chickens and pigs to eke out their livelihood.               In their assiduous
 struggle for livelihood, they take comfort in the thought of working hard
 for life.  Their livelihood is more miserable than that of semi-owner peas-
 ants, but better than farm laborers.   On the other hand, they are more
 revolutionary than the semi-owner peasants, but less so than farm laborers.
 The farm laborers constitute the agricultural proletariat.  There are the
 long-term laborers, monthly laborers, and sundry laborers.  These farm
 laborers not only own no land and farm implements, but also not the slight-
 est liquid capital.  They live from hand to mouth every day.  They exceed
 other workers in their long hours of work, meager wages, poor treatment,
 and uncertainty of employment.  These persons suffer the most in the coun-
 tryside.  In promoting the peasant movement, we must pay particular atten-
 tion to them.  In the countryside, handicraft workers hold a higher posi-
 tion than the farm laborers, since the former have their own tools and also
 perform a free occupation.  With burden of families, and wages incompatible
 with cost of living, the handicraft workers share the oppression of poverty
 and the fear of unemployment with farm laborers, and lead a life similar to
 that of farm laborers.
 The vagabond proletariat consist of peasants who lost their land and handi-
 craft workers who lost the opportunity to work because of exploitation and
 oppression perpetrated by imperialists, warlords, and landlords, and flood,.
 drought, and other natural disasters.  Among them are soldiers, bandits,
 thieves, beggars, and prostitutes.  The five are designated and regarded
 by society differently, although they are alike as human beings.  In their
 different methods of seeking the same end of livelihood, the soldiers engage
 in "fighting," the bandits in "robbing," the thieves in "stealing," the
 beggars in "pleading," and prostitutes in "charming."  They are the most
 unstable among mankind.  In all areas, they have their won secret organiza-
 tions, such as San-ho-hui 10005 5071 2585] in Hunan, Hupeh, Kueichou, and
 Szechwan; Ta-tao-hui [1129 0430 2585] in Anhwei, Honan, and Shantung; Tsai-
 li-hui [0961 3810 2585] in Hopeh and the northeast provinces; and the Blue
 Gang in Shanghai, as mutual-aid organizations in their political and finan-
 cial struggles.   The settlement of these persons constitute one of the great-
 est and most difficult problems in China.  As poverty and unemployment are
 two problems in China, a settlement of the unemployment problem would amount
 to putting to rest one-half of the problems in China.  The number of Chinese
 vagabond proletariat is alarming, totalling more than 20,000,000.  These per-
 sons are capable of brave struggle.  Under proper guidance, they can become
 a revolutionary force.
 In organizing peasants, we mean to organize owner-peasants, semi-owner peas-
 ants, semi-hired peasants, farm laborers, and handicraft workers into one

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 organization.  In principle, we employ the method of strife against land-
 lords to demand financial and political concessions.  In special circum-
 stances, such as we encounter in Haifeng and Kwangning where the most re-
 actionary and vicious local despots are tramping upon the people, we must
 completely strike them down.  Regarding the vagabond proletariat, we should
 persuade them to help the peasant associations and to join the great revolu-
 tionary movement to seek settlement of the unemployment problem.  We should
 not force them to join the enemy side to become part of the counterrevolu-
 tionary force.

 ANALYSIS OF THE CLASSES IN CHINESE SOCIETY
 1 February 1926
 [Text]  Who are our enemies?  Who are out friends?  One cannot be a revolu-
 tionist if one cannot distinguish between enemies and friends.  It is, how-
 ever, by no means easy to distinguish between enemies and friends.  That
 the Chinese revolution has been going on for 30 years with scant results is
 not due to errors in its goal, but is entirely due to errors in strategy.
 The so-called errors in strategy were that we could not rally our real friends
 to attack our real enemies.  The reason why we could not do this was that we
 did not distinguish who were our enemies and who were our friends. A revolu-
 tionary party is a guide of the masses.  In the army, there can be no vic-
 tory in fighting if its guide leads them astray.   In a revolutionary  move-
 ment, it will be impossible to avoid failure if the revolutionary party
 takes the wrong road.  We are all revolutionaries who lead the way for the
 masses, and are the guides for the masses.  Nonetheless, we cannot but ask
 ourselves:  "Do we have this ability?  Won't we lead the masses onto the
 road of defeat?  Are we sure to succeed?  In order to ensure that we will
 "not lead to the wrong road" and "be sure to succeed," we cannot but devote
 ourselves to an important strategy.   In order to decide on this strategy,
 it is necessary to first. distinguish between those who are our enemies and
 those who are our friends.
 The Manifesto of the First National Congress of the Kuomintang served as
 the declaration of this strategy and the distinction between enemies and
 friends.   But this manifesto is rather simplistic.   If we want to understand
 this important strategy and to distinguish between real enemies and friends,
 we must make a general analysis on the economic status, class characters,
 and number of people of the various classes in Chinese society, and their
 attitudes towards the revolution.
 There are bound to be three classes of people in any country--the upper,
 middle and lower classes.  A detailed analysis will show five classes--the
 big bourgeoisie, the middle bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie, the semi-
 proletariat and the proletariat.   In the case of the rural areas, the:big

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 landlords constitute the big bourgeoisie, the small landlords are the middle
 bourgeoisie, the self-farming peasants are the petty bourgeoisie;  the
 tenant peasants are the semi-proletariat, and the hired peasants are the
 proletariat.  In the case of the cities, the big bourgeoisie are the big
 bankers, the big businessmen and the big industrialists.  The money-shop
 owners, the middle merchants and the small factory owners are the middle
 bourgeoisie, while the small merchants and handicrafts operators are the
 petty bourgeoisie.  The shopkeepers, peddlers and handicraftsmen are the
 semi-proletariat, and factory workers and the so-called coolie  are the
 proletariat.  These five categories of people fall into.different economic
 strata, and are fraught with varying class character.  Consequently, they
 cherish diverse attitudes toward the contemporary revolution, such as being
 counterrevolutionary, semi-counterrevolutionary, neutral toward revolution,
 taking part  in revolution, or serving as the main force of revolution.
 The attitude of the various classes in China toward the national revolution
 resembles almost completely the attitude of the various classes in the capit-
 alist countries of Western Europe toward their social revolution.    This
 may seem strange, but it really is not.  The reason is that the contemporary
 revolution [and the social revolution in Europe] is one and the same, fought
 with a similar goal and tactic.  The goal is to overthrow international capi-
 talist imperialism, and the tactic is to unite the oppressed peoples and
 oppressed classes to fight together.  This is the greatest characteristic
 which makes the contemporary revolution different from all revolutions in
 history.
 Let us take a look at the various classes in Chinese society.
 First, there is the big bourgeoisie.  In economically backward and semi-
 colonial China, the big bourgeoisie was the vassal of the international
 capitalists.  The prerequisites of its existence and development depended on
 imperialism.  For example, [they included] compradores--such as bankers
 (Lu Tsung-yu and Ch'en Lien-por), merchants,  (T'ang Shao-i and Robert Ho-
 tung), industrialists (Chang Ch'ien and Sheng En-hsi), big landlords,
 (Chang Tso-lin and Ch'en Kung-shou), bureaucrats (Sun Pao-ch'i and Yen
 Hui-ch'ing), and warlords (Chang Tso-lin and Ts'ao K':un).
 Reactionary  intellectuals--they are the appendages of the four categories
 of people mentioned above.  The higher ranking staff of compradore types of
 banks, industries and business, plutocrats, high government officials, poli-
 ticians, some returned students from Japan and the West, professors and
 students of universities and colleges, and lawyers are also in this class.
 This class is entirely incompatible with the goals of the national revolu-
 tion.  Standing consistently on the side of imperialism, they are ex-
 tremely counterrevolutionary.  They number fewer than 1 million, which is
 .25 percent of our population of 400 million people, and they are the
 deadly enemies of the national revolutionary movement.

 Second, there is the middle bourgeoisie.  This is the Chinese-owned bank-
 ing, and industrial and commercial class. In economically backward China,
 the development of banks, and industry and business is still limited to the
 middle bourgeoisie.  The so-called banks refer to small banks and money
 shops, while industry refers to factories on a small scale, and commerce refers
 to     merchants handling native goods.  All big banks and industry and
 business had some ties with capital, and they can only be classified under
 the comprador class.)
 The small landlords class.  Many of the higher intelligentsia--such as the
 staff of the Chinese-owned banks, the industrial and business establishments,
 most of the returned students from Japan and the West, some college pro- .
 fessors and students, and small lawyers belonged to this class.  It was the
 ambition of this class to strive for the status of the big bourgeoisie, but
 it was hampered by the impact of foreign capital and the oppression of the
 warlords.  Consequently, this class has adopted a contradictory attitude toward
 the national revolution.  That is, whenever they feel the agonies of the blow
 of foreign capital and the oppression of the warlords, they wanted to engage
 in revolution and supported the anti-imperialist and anti-warlord revolu-
 tionary movement.  However, because of the vigorous participation in the
 present revolutionary movement by the proletariat at home and the active
 support of the international proletariat abroad, they sensed a threat to
 the existence and development of the big bourgeoisie status to which they
 aspire.  Thus, they have become suspicious of the revolution.  This class
 is the so-called national bourgeoisie whose political platform is national-
 ism--to realize a state ruled by a single class, the national bourgeoisie.
 The "true disciple" (as he professed himself) of this is Tai Chi-t'ao who
 wrote in CHEN PAO, Peking:   "Raise your left hand to overthrow imperialism
 and your right hand to overthrow the Communists!"  This describes vividly
 the contradiction and ambivalence of this class.   They are opposed to using
 the theory of class struggle to interpret the Principle of'the People's
 Livelihood; they are opposed to the Kuomintang's alliance with Russia and
 the admission of communists into that party.  Nonetheless, the attempt of
 this class to realize a state ruled by the national bourgeoisie has proved
 to be completely infeasible.   This is because the current world situation
 is one in which the two great forces of revolution and counterrevolution are
 locked in a final struggle.  Hoisted by these two great forces are two
 large banners:  one being the red banner of revolution which is held high
 by the Third International, calling on the oppressed nations and classes
 to stand under it on one side; the other being the white banner of counter-
 revolution, which is held high by the League of Nations, calling on the coun-
 terrevolutionaries of the world to stand under it on the other side.   It is
 therefore essential for the intermediate classes, such as the so-called
 Second International in the West, and the so-called Nationalists in China,
 to be separated quickly, either to turn left to join the revolutionists,
 or to turn right to join the counterrevolutionaries.  There could be no
 room for their "independence."  Consequently, the ideology of an "independ-
 ent" revolution on the part of China's middle bourgeoisie with its own class
 interests as the main basis is merely an illusion.  Although they are still

 only semi-counterrevolutionary, and although they have not yet  become our
 frontal enemies, nevertheless, as they begin to feel more the threat of the
 workers and peasant class, and as they are compelled more and more to make
 concessions to the interests of the workers and peasants class (such as
 the rent reduction movement in rural villages and labor strikes in the
 cities), they or a portion of them (the right wing of the middle bourgeoisie)
 are bound to stand on the side of imperialism, thereby becoming counter-
 revolutionary and our enemies completely.  It has transpired that between
 compradores and noncompradores, there are some who cannot be distinguished
 readily.  Take commerce for example, it is true that among many merchants,
 there is a very clear distinction between merchants of foreign goods and
 merchants of native products.  Nonetheless, in some shops, they offer both
 native and foreign goods side by side.  Take the intellectual class for
 example, there' are many returned students from Japan among the children
 of small landlords.  It is true that apart from their semi-native flavor,
 they have also acquired some semi-foreign flavor.  Even among the children
 of small landlords  who study in universities and colleges in China, be-
 cause they have been taught by returned students that are semi-native and
 semi-foreign, they could not but become semi-native and semi-foreign them-
 selves.  These people cannot be characterized as purely national bourgeoisie,
 but may be called "semi-national bourgeoisie."  This is the right wing of
 middle bourgeoisie, and when the struggle of national revolution is intensi-
 fied, they are bound to hasten to join the ranks of imperialist warlords,
 thereby becoming good companions of the compradores.  The left wing of mid-
 dle bourgeoisie, namely, those who are totally unaffiliated with imperialism,
 might be rather revolutionary at times (such as during the high tide of some
 boycott of foreign goods).  Nonetheless, it is not easy to shatter their
 vain concept of "peace," and they are constantly frightened by the so-called
 "Bolshevization."  They tend to be compromising toward revolution and can-
 not last long.  Thus, there are also many dangerous elements in China's
 middle bourgeoisie, whether they belong to the right wing or the left wing.
 With the exception of a small minority who have special historical background
 and environment, we cannot expect them to bravely embark on the revolutionary
 road, and undertake the revolutionary enterprise loyally along with the
 other classes. The number of people in the middle bourgeoisie is at most one
 in every 100 (1 percent) in China, and so there are about 4 million of them.
 Third, The Petty Bourgeoisie
 To this category belong the owner peasants, small merchants, handicrafts
 operators, small intellectuals--minor officials, clerks, middle school students
 and teachers, small lawyers, etc.  Both numerically and in its class charac-
 ters, this class deserves great attention.  The owner peasants of the petty
 bourgeois alone number some 100 to 120 million; the number of small merchants,
 handicrafts operators and intellectuals ranges from 20 to 30 million.  The
 combined total is about 130 million. Although these people share the same
 bourgeois economic status, there are, in fact, three different sections.
 The first section comprises those people who have surplus money and rice,
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 that is, after supporting themselves with the income from their own phys-
 ical or mental labor, they can still have some surpluses each year which
 can be used to create the so-called preliminary accumulation of capital.
 This kind of people are strongly inclined to "get rich."  Although they have
 no illusions tb.:amass huge fortunes, they nevertheless want to climb to the
 status of middle bourgeoisie.  They.envy those who have gathered a small
 fortune and . who seem to get so much respect, and consequently, they worship
 Marshal Chao [the legendary god of wealth] diligently.  They are rather
 timorous, being afraid of officials and also of revolution to some extent.
 Because of the fact that their economic status approaches that of the mid-
 dle bourgeoisie, they are therefore rather susceptible to the latter's
 propaganda; and tend to be skeptical toward revolution.  However, this
 section is a minority among the petty bourgeoisie, being less than 10 per-
 cent of them, or about 15 million, forming the right wing of the petty
 bourgeoisie.  The second section of the petty bourgeoisie is barely self-
 sufficient, as their annual income is about equal to their expenditure.
 They differ largely from the first section of people.  They also would like
 to be rich, but Marshal Chao won't let them.  Under the oppression and ex-
 ploitation of imperialism, warlords, and big and middle bourgeoisie in
 recent years, they have begun to realize that the present world is no
 longer like the world of the past.  They realize that if they should ex-
 pend the same labor as they did before, it would not be possible to main-
 tain their livelihood.  It is now necessary to increase labor time by rising
 early and paying double attenton to their chores in order to survive.  They
 become abusive:  they dub foreigners "foreign devils," scold the warlords
 as "robber commanders," and denounce local despots and evil gentry for their
 "ill-begotten wealth." In regard to the anti-imperialist and anti-warlord
 movements, their only doubt is that they might not succeed, because "for-
 eigners and commanders seemed to be so formidable" to them.  Thus, they
 take a neutral stand, not daring to participate in it resolutely, though
 they are absolutely: by no means anti-revolutionary.  The number of this
 section is very large, almost one-half of the petty bourgeoisie, or 75
 million.  The third section consists of those who incur deficits every year.
 Many of these people used to belong to families of moderate means, but
 they have declined gradually, becoming barely able to break even at first,
 and suffering from losses later.  At the time of settlement of accounts
 each year,. they are shocked, sighing:   "We have lost money again!"  Be-
 cause they have had better times before, they would "shudder at the future
 prospects" as their fortunes declined and as they contracted more and more
 debts.  Because of this comparison between now and before, these people
 are important in the revolutionary movement and have the strength to push
 the revolution. forward.   Their number is about 40 percent of the petty
 bourgeoisie or 60 million.  They are sizable among the petty bourgeoisie
 and form its left wing.    The above-mentioned three sections of the petty
 bourgeoisie may differ  in their attitudes toward the revolution at normal
 time.  But in wartime, that is, when the revolutionary tide is high and
 when victory seems to be in sight, then not only the left wing but also
 the middle section of petty bourgeoisie would join the revolution.  The

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 right wingers, under the impact of the proletariat and the left wing of the
 petty bourgeoisie, could not but also join it.  Judging our experiences from
 the 30 May Movement and the peasant movement in the last 2 years, this
 assessment seems to be correct.
 Fourth, The Semi-Proletariat
 The so-called semi-proletariat mentioned here consists of:   (1) the semi-
 owner peasants, (2) tenant peasants, (3) poor peasants, (4) handicrafts-
 men, (5) shop assistants, and (6) peddlers.  Among the peasants of China,
 the number of semi-owner peasants is about 50 million, while tenant peasants
 and poor peasants number some 60 million each, making a total of 170 mil-
 lion.  The so-called peasant problem is largely their problem.  Although
 these three kinds of peasants belong to the semi-proletariat together,
 their economic conditions may be further classified as upper, middle and
 poor. In the case of semi-owner peasants, their lives are worse than the
 owner peasants because they are short of one half of the food they need for
 sustenance.  To make up the deficit, they have to rent land from others, or
 to work for others, or engage in petty trade. In late spring and early
 summer when the harvest is not yet ready, they often have to borrow money
 at usurious interest rates or buy grain at exorbitant prices.  Their situa-
 tion is naturally worse than that of the owner peasants who are self-suffi-
 cient, but better than that of the tenant peasants.  This is because of the
 fact that the tenant peasants do not  own land, and so they can take in only
 half of the harvest each year.  The semi-owner peasants, though they can
 garner only half of the harvest from their rented land, or even less than
 half of it, they can, nonetheless, reap the entire harvest of the land they
 own.  Thus, the revolutionary character of semi-owner peasants is better
 than that of the owner peasants, but not as great as that of the tenant
 peasants.  Both the tenant peasants and the poor peasants are tenants ex-
 ploited by landlords, though there is some difference in their economic
 status.  Although tenant peasants do not have land, they have sufficient.
 farm implements and some current capital.  Such peasants can earn half of
 their own fruits of labor, and the shortages can be made up by planting
 cereal crops, fishing, chicken farming and pig-raising, thereby enabling
 them to eke out a living.  They may suffer from hardships, but their live-
 lihood is harder than that of the semi-owner peasants but better off than
 that of the poor peasants.  Nonetheless, their revolutionary character is
 superior to that of semi-owner peasants, but not as good as that of the
 poor peasants.   In the case of poor peasants, they lack not only sufficient
 farm implements, but also current'capital.  Moreover, they are short of
 fertilizers, and when there is lean harvest, they earn almost nothing after
 delivering their rents.  During a famine, they have often to beg their
 friends and relatives to borrow a few sheng or bushels of grain to tide
 them over for a few days.  They become burdened with heavy debts.  They
 are the most distressed among the peasants, and so are more receptive
 to revolutionary propaganda.  The handicraftsmen are called semi-proletariat
 because they own their own tools and are also self-employed.  Their economic

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 status resembles that of tenant peasants in agriculture.  But because of
 their heavy family burdens and because of the gap between wages and living
 costs, they are often plagued by poverty and by the dread of unemployment,
 resembling largely what happens to tenant peasants.   The shop assistants are
 employees of middle and small. merchants earning meagre wages to eke out a
 living.  However, despite the steady increases  of commodity prices every
 year, their pay is adjusted only once in several years.  They will tell you
 their sad story if you should get into a casual conversation with them.
 Thus their status is about the same as that of handicraftsmen, and they are
 receptive to revolutionary propaganda.  In the case of peddlers, whether
 they carry their wares on their shoulders or set up stalls in the streets,
 they all have very little capital and earn meagre profit which is hardly
 sufficient to live on.  Their status is about the same as that of the poor
 peasants, and like the latter, they also need a revolution that will change
 the status quo.  The number of handicraftsmen is about 6 percent of the
 entire population, or 26 million; there are about 5 million shop assistants
 and 1 million peddlers. Combining these people with the semi-owner peasants,
 semi-tenant peasants and tenant peasants, the total number of people in the
 semi-proletariat is about 200 million, being one-half of the entire Chinese
 population.
 Fifth, The Proletariat
 The categories and the number of proletariat are as follows:  industrial
 proletariat, about 2 million; urban coolie labor, about 3 million, and
 agricultural proletariat, about 20 million.   Their combined number is about
 45 million.
 Because of China's backward economy,. the number of industrial workers (the
 industrial proletariat) is rather, small.  Most of the 2 million industrial
 workers, are found in these five kinds of industries, namely:  railroads,
 mining, maritime transportation, textiles and shipbuilding.  Most of
 these industries are operated with foreign capital.   Thus, although the
 industrial proletariat is not numerous, it has become the main force of the
 national revolutionary movement.  We will realize the important position
 of the industrial proletariat in national revolution if we take a look at
 the strength that has been demonstrated by the strikes in the last 4 years,
 such as the seamen's strikes, the railway strike, the strikes of the
 Kailuan and Chiao-tso coal mines, as well as the general strikes in Shang-
 hai and Hong Kong since the 30 May Incident.   The first reason why they have
 become so important is their concentration, and no other people could com-
 pare to their "organized concentration."  The second reason is that, with
 their low economic status, they would be left only with empty hands after
 losing their means of production. They have no hope of making a fortune.
 Meanwhile, they have been subjected to the ruthless treatment of imperial-
 ism, warlords and compradores, and consequently, they have become most adept
 at struggling.   The strength of the urban coolies also merits attention.
 They consist mostly of dock workers and rickshamen.   Street cleaners and
 nightsoil movers also belong to this category.  They possess almost nothing
 except their hands.   Though their economic position is somewhat similar
 to that of industrial workers, they are not so concentrated organizationally,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 nor are they so important as a productive force.  Since there is as yet no
 modern capitalist agriculture in China, the so-called agricultural proletar-
 iat refers to such hired peasants as hired laborer by the year, monthly
 hired laborer,'and day laborer.  They have neither farm tools nor funds,
 and so they can only sell their labor to eke out a living.  Compared to
 other workers, they have to work longer hours, and their wages are the
 lowest, and there is no security of employment.  They are the most handi-
 capped people in the villages, and occupy a position in the peasant move-
 ment that is as important as the poor peasants.
 The lumpen  proletariat consists of peasants deprived of land and handi-
 craftsmen deprived of their opportunity to work.  They number some 20 mil-
 lion or more, and constitute the root causes of banditry and war.  The largest
 segment of lumpen proletariat consists of bandits, followed by soldiers,
 then beggars, robbers and thieves, and prostitutes.  They are most unstable
 in human existence.  They have their secret organizatons in China, such as
 the Triad Society in Fukien and Kwangtung, the Society of Brothers in Hunan,
 Hupei, Kweichow and Szechwan, the Big Sword Society in Anhwei, Honan and
 Shantung, the Rational Life Society in Chih-li and the three northeastern
 provinces, and the Green and Red Gangs in Shanghai and elsewhere.  These
 secret organizations all serve as their organs of mutual aid in political
 and economic struggles.  The most difficult problem is how to handle these
 people.  The two problems of China are:  poverty and unemployment. Thus,.if
 .the problem of unemployment is solved, it would be tantamount to solving
 one-half of China's problems.  These people are capable of waging valiant
 struggle, and when they are guided properly, the can become a revolutionary
 force.  The above are arranged in the following table:

 We can now answer the question as to who are our enemies and who are our
 friends.  All those who connive with imperialism--warlords and bureaucrats,
 compradores, big landlords, reactionary intellectuals--the so-called big
 bourgeoisie of China, are our enemies, and our real enemies.  All petty
 bourgeoisie, semi-proletariat and proletariat are our true friends.  As for
 the wavering middle bourgeoisie, its right wing should be regarded as our
 enemy--if not now, it is not too far away.  Its left wing may be regarded
 as our friend--but not true friend, and we must be vigilant toward them.
 Don't let them jeopardize our front!  How many true friends do we have?
 About 395 million.  How many real enemies do we have?  About 1 million.  How
 many intermediate people who can either be friends or enemies?  There are
 about 4 million.  Let us count these 4 million as our enemies so that they
 could have an organization of 5 million people.  It would still be impossible
 for them even to withstand the splitting of 39.5 million people!
 Let the 395 million people of China unite together!

 NATIONAL REVOLUTION AND PEASANT MOVEMENT--FOREWORD TO 'NUNG-MIN WEN-T'I
 TS'UNG-K'AN'
 1 September 1926
 [Text] The peasant problem is the central problem of national revolution.
 Unless the peasants rise up to join and support the national revolution, the
 revolution will.-not succeed.  Unless the peasant movement is launched quick-
 ly, the peasant problem will not be solved.  Unless the peasant problem is
 solved to some extent in the existing revolutionary movement, the peasants
 will not support this revolution.  There are still many people who do not
 understand these reasons now, even within the revolutionary party.  They
 do not understand that in an economically backward semi-colony, the foremost
 target of revolution is the rural patrimonial feudal class (landlord class).
 In an economically backward semi-colony, both for imperialism without and
 the ruling class within, peasants are the main target of their oppression
 and exploitation.  In order to realize their oppression and exploitation,
 they must rely on the firm support of the feudal landlords.  They have no
 means to practice their oppression otherwise.  Thus, the rural feudal class
 in an economically backward semi-colony is the only solid foundation for
 the domestic ruling class and external imperialism.  Without first shaking
 this foundation, it would be impossible to shake the superstructure of this
 foundation.  The warlords of China are chieftains of these rural feudal
 classes.  It is penny wise pound foolish for one to say that warlords should
 be overthrown, but not the rural feudal classes.  A plain example is the
 situation in Kwangtung:  wherever the native bullies, bad gentry and corrupt
 bureaucrats are less active, it must be a county in which the peasant move-
 ment has been launched and there is mass participation of peasants in the
 Peasants Association.  In other words, a country where Ch'en Ch'iung-ming's
 influences have. been curtailed must be a county where the peasants have
 risen.  It may be said that a year ago, Ch'en Ch'iung-ming--not the revolu-
 tionary government--controlled Kwangtung.  In the past year and up to now,
 Kwangtung has been controlled equally by the Revolutionary Government and
 Ch'en Ch'iung-ming, although Ch'en was not physically in Kwangtung himself.
 From now on, the peasants must gradully stand up in the various counties
 in Kwangtung before it will truly show that Ch'en Ch'iung-ming's
 influences are steadily diminishing there.

 In Hai-feng, Ch'en Ch'iung-ming's native county, local bullies, bad gentry
 and corrupt bureaucrats once proliferated.  But after a Peasants Association
 of 50,000 familes and 250,000 people was formed, it has become better ad-
 ministered than any other county in Kwangtung.  The magistrate there dared not
 to do evil; tax officials dared not take bribes; the entire country was free
 from bandits; and there were no local bullies and bad gentry tyrannizing
 over the people.
 Thus, it will be seen that the situation of Chinese revolution is like this:
 it is either a base of imperialism and warlords in which local bullies, bad
 gentry, and corrupt bureaucrats suppress the peasants, or a base of the
 revolutionary forces in which the, peasants rise up to suppress the local
 bullies, bad gentry and corrupt bureaucrats.  The Chinese revolution  can
 be carried out only in this form and no other.  It is incumbent on all parts
 of China to achieve what has been done in Hai-feng before it may be con-
 sigiered revolutionary victory, and it would be nothing, otherwise.  It is
 incumbent on all parts of China to achieve what has been done in Hai-feng
 before the bases of imperialism and the warlords may be said to have been
 really shaken.  Otherwise, it cannot be considered so.  Consequently, it
 will be seen that in the so-called national revolutionary movement, a major
 part of it is the peasant movement.  Thus, it will be seen that those who
 do not emphasize or even abhor the peasant movement are actually sympathetic
 toward local bullies, bad gentry and corrupt bureaucrats.  In fact, they
 do not want to overthrow the warlords, or to oppose imperialism.
 There are people who deem that the rampancy of compradores in the cities
 is entirely similar to the rampancy of landlords in rural areas, and so they
 should be mentioned together.  This is correct in regard to their being ram-
 pant, but incorrect to say that they are completely similar.  There are only
 a few places in China along the sea and the rivers where the compradore
 class is concentrated, such as Hong Kong, Canton, Shanghai, Hankow, Tientsin
 and Dairen, unlike the domains of landlords which spread into various prov-
 inces and countries throughout China.  Politically, all warlords in China,
 big and small, are chieftains chosen by landlord class (not including band-
 rupt small landlords).   These feudal landlord chieftains--feudal warlords
 make use of the urban compradore class to connive with imperialism.  Both
 in name and in fact, it is the warlords who occupy the principal position,
 while  the compradore class is subordinate.  Financially,  the warlord
 government spends several hundred million dollars annually, of which 90
 percent is directly squeezed from the peasants dominated by the landlord
 class.   The loans made with special conditions to the Peking government by
 the compradore class, such as the Bankers' Association, etc., are compara-
 tively few.  This is why I feel that the urban workers, students and middle
 and small merchants should rise up to attack the compradores fiercely and
 to cope with imperialism directly.  The progressive working class is, above
 all, the leader of all revolutionary classes.  However, if there are no
 peasants to overthrow the special privileges of patrimonial and feudal land-
 lords in the villages, then the influences of warlords and imperialism can-
 not be basically destroyed.

 Based on this reason, apart from organizing the workers and  students, we
 must mobilize a large number of comrades to be resolved to undertake the
 gigantic work of organizing peasants.   They must make an immediate resolution
 to start studying peasant problems.  It is also necessary to apply for orders
 from the party in order to proceed to some familiar or unfamiliar villages.
 This involves enduring the scorching heat of summer and the severe cold
 and snow of winter to hold hands with peasants, to inquire what are their
 hardships and what they want.  Based on their agonies and needs, we must
 guide them to organize, to struggle against local bullies and bad gentry,
 to cooperate with urban workers, students, and middle and small merchants
 in forming a united front, and to participate in the anti-imperialist and
 anti-warlord national revolutionary movement.  We estimate that among the
 300 million peasant masses in China, if 10 percent should join  Peasant
 Associations, it will be possible to recruit some 30 million or more organ-
 ized peasants.  Especially in such provinces as Hunan, Kwangtung and Kiangsi
 in the south, Chihli, Shantung and Honan in the north, and Hupeh and Anhwei
 in central China, which are particularly important politically, mass efforts
 should be made in organizing.  With the rising of the peasants from these
 important provinces, it will be easy for peasants from the remaining prov-
 inces to follow suit.   It is only by then that the foundations of imperialism
 and the warlords will be shaken and a bona fide victory will be achieved by
 national revolution.
 As we mention the studying of peasant problem, we begin to realize the in-
 sufficiency of data.  Naturally, such data will become more abundant as the
 peasant movement is being developed.  At present, besides Kwangtung, the
 peasant movement is just beginning in other provinces, and so data are
 extremely scant.  This time we have just collected this much which is printed
 as a set of books for the references of comrades engaged in the peasant move-
 ment.  The portion concerning investigations on rural conditions in the
 various provinces has been written by some 300 students of the 6th class of
 the Peasant Movement Institute.  These reports have been discussed at the
 Peasant Problem Study Meetings organized by students in their respective
 provinces, and have been printed after a considerable period of reviewing
 and screening.  They have not done any detailed investigations on peasant
 conditions before, and so what they have told is rather sketchy.  However,
 because we did not even have such sketchy material, it seems precious to
 have this bit.  It behooves us to accept this sketchy outline with the hope
 that within a short period of time, it will be possible to obtain detailed
 and concrete investigation report on the entire country from the practical
 work and studying in various parts of China.  In regard to the data concern-
 ing the problem of agricultural production, only five categories (22d-26th)
 have been collected in this book.  There is no lack of materials on this
 problem, but because of the pressure for time in publishing it, there is
 not time to canvass them, but a separate publication will be issued later.
 The peasant problem originally embraces the problems on two aspects, namely:
 the problem of man-made oppression by imperialism, warlords and landlords,
 etc.; and the problem of nature's oppression such as the natural disasters

 of flood and drought, insect pestilences, inferior techniques and produc-
 tion decreases, etc.  Although the former is an urgent problem on which the
 attention of our comrades should be focused, the latter problem is also
 rather serious, and we must pay great attention to it.  In order to resolve
 the latter problem, it is necessary to have a nationwide revolutionary regime
 as well as scientific methods which, though not immediately feasible, will
 come soon.  We must make preparations in advance.   In this book there are eight
 kinds of materials'concerning Kwangtung.  This is the best part of the book.
 It tells us the methods of conducting the peasant movement.  Those who do
 not understand how to launch such movement should read this part carefully.
 It also enables us to understand the character of China's peasant movement
 in that it is a movement of class struggle in which political and economic
 struggles are merged together.  What is demonstrated most uniquely is in
 political struggle which is somewhat different from the character of labor
 movement in the cities.  What the urban working class is striving for is the
 completion freedom of assembly politically.  They are not yet interested in
 destroying the political status of the bourgeoisie.  On the other hand, the
 rural peasants have, from the very outset, to cope with the political power
 that has for millenniums been used by local bullies, bad gentry and big land-
 lords to oppress and squeeze them (this landlord regime is the real basis of
 warlord regime).   Thus, unless this oppressive regime is overthrown, it
 will be impossible for the peasants to have their own status.  This is the
 most significant characteristic of China's current peasant movement.  Judging
 from the experiences of peasant movement in the last 5 years, and after read-
 ing "The Resolution of the Peasant Conference of Kwangtung," "Report on
 Hai-feng's Peasant Movement," and "The Story of Resistance of Peasants of
 Kwang-ning and P'u-ning against Landlords," we cannot but have such a feel-
 ing.  This publication also includes some foreign data (15th to 18th),
 though not too many.  There is a wealth of materials from foreign countries,
 especially on Russia's peasant movement and agrarian economy, but nobody has
 yet translated them carefully.  In this book, the article on Russian peasants
 and revolution is comparatively more detailed..  We can also compare it with
 the conditions in China.

 THE AGONY AND RESISTANCE MOVEMENT OF PEASANTS IN KIANGSU AND CHEKIANG
 25 November 1926
 [Text] Kiangsu and Chekiang are two provinces in China where industry and
 commerce are highly developed.   Consequently, people pay more attention to
 the workers and merchants there, while the peasants seem to occupy lower
 position.  Moreover, it has been generally assumed that because these two
 provinces are peaceful and rich in resources, their peasants are better
 off.  In fact, this kind of interpretation is rather superficial, and it
 betrays a complete lack of understanding regarding the actual conditions
 of rural villages in Kiangsu and Chekiang.  If we should try to investigate
 the actual conditions, we will realize that they are completely contrary to
 our conjectures.  The concrete facts in each county as mentioned below con-
 stitute only a small portion of the data that we have obtained recently.
 Nonetheless, this is enough to prove that the peasants in Kiangsu and
 Chekiang are not so peaceful, prosperous and free from agonies as the gen-
 eral public has imagined.
 Ch'ung-ming:  an island at the mouth of the Yangtze River, its entire terri-
 tory constitutes the country of Ch'ung-ming.  The island was created by
 Yangtze River's alluvial deposits of mud and sand.  On. the fringes of the
 island new sand bars are formed each year, which in turn serve as sandy
 fields farmed by tenant peasants.  Take Shang-sha for instance.  The land-
 lords there are extremely ruthless in exploiting tenant peasants.  They
 usually demand 50 yuan as security money for each 1,000 steps [pu 2975] of
 land.  Because this kind of land consists entirely of newly formed sandy
 fields, the peasants have to convert it into ripe farmland for their land-
 lords.  By then, the landlords would have.ownership over the land, while
 the peasants have the right to cultivate it.  However, they must secure the
 labor, fertilizer, farm implements, and seeds that are needed for planting
 each year.  After the autumn harvest, each 1,000 steps of'farmland will
 have to deliver 500 catties or even more of grain for rent.  When the land-
 lord comes to visit his tenant, he must be invited to a good meal and wine.
 Otherwise, the rent might be increased.  The steelyard used by landlords to
 weigh grain delivered by tenants as rent generally takes 20 ounces for a catty.
 If the peasant displays any kind of resistance, he is immediately sent to the
 county government for punishment.  If the peasant owes 5 yuan in rent this

 year, he has to pay back 10 or 20 yuan next year.  As a result, many peas-
 ants become bankrupt each year.  The peasants here staged a riot in the 11th
 year of the Republic.  There were no Reds or Bolsheviks to incite them, but
 they marched together to attack the police station, cut off the ear of a land-
 lord by the name of T'ao, and went to demonstrate at the magistrate's office,
 demanding reduction of rents.  Later, because of the lack of solidarity,
 their leader was arrested and the riot failed.  This year, Kiangsu has been
 hit by drought, and the harvest has declined.  At Shang-sha, the harvest
 per 1,000 steps of land was only some 300 or 400 catties, yet the landlords
 insisted that their tenants deliver 500 catties of grain for rent as before.
 The landlords even used the "Resolution of the Tenant Maintenance Committee"
 to deceive the peasants (the committee was organized by landlords in 1922 to
 persecute the peasants).  Consequently, the hatred of peasants toward their
 landlords has intensified, and riots will soon erupt.                  -
 Chiang-yin:  From Wu-hsi one can take the steamer to a place called Ku-shan-
 chen which is located between the three counties of Chiang-yin, Ch'ang-shu
 and Wu-hsi.  Big landlords abound in these three counties, and they are ruth-
 less in oppressing tenant peasants.  Last autumn, Chou Shui-p'ing, a native
 of Ku-shan who is a returned student from Japan (Chou was a graduate of the
 Provincial Normal School at Wu-hsi), returned to his own village.  He did
 not like what he saw, and so he persuaded the tenant peasants to set up an
 organization called "Tenants Cooperative Society for Self-salvation."
 Chou traveled to different villages to talk about the agonies of tenant
 peasants, and sometimes he became so emotional that tears fell from his eyes.
 He recruited many followers from among Ku-shan's peasants.  In the bordering
 counties of Chiang-yin, Ch'ang-shu and Wu-hsi, peasants were incited by him
 to rise against the evil gentry and big landlords.  They unanimously demanded
 that the rents be reduced.  Nevertheless, before the peasants had coalesced
 themselves completely, the evil gentry and big landlords had joined forces.
 In Chiang-yin, Ch'ang-shu and Wu-hsi, they took action simultaneously, making
 their accusation by letters and by telegrams to [General] Sun Ch'uan-fang.
 How could Sun Ch'uan-fang not listen to the charges of these evil gentry and
 landlords?  Thus, in November last year, the Tenants Cooperative Society
 for Self-salvation was dissolved and Chou Shui-p'ing was arrested.  Chou was
 executed in January this year, and so the rent reduction movement has been
 suppressed.  When Chou Shui-p'ing's coffin was brought back to Ku-shan for
 burial, the peasants went to his spiritual shrine in droves to kneel down
 to pay their respects.  They said:   "Since Mr Chou died for us, we must
 avenge him!"  Due to a severe drought this year, the rice harvest is poor.
 The peasants are again calling for rent reduction.  This proves that they
 are not scared by death.  They realize that it is only through solidarity
 and struggle that they will make the greedy landlords ease their  exploita-
 tion.   In the eastern villages of Chiang-yin, there is a place called Sha-
 chou where peasant resistance against landlords has occurred.  The most
 sinister example here is that the peasants are required to deliver to land-
 lords the rent in advance.  This is what the people of Kiangau call de-
 livering at the time of Yin while planting at the time of Mou.  This is

 also one of the most awful things in the peasant economy.  The peasants
 there are now demanding that they pay the rent only after the crop has been
 hauled in, and are still struggling.
 Tan-yang:  Described here will be two incidents which occurred in Lu-ch'eng-
 chen, Tan-yang (Lu-ch'eng-chen is located in the eastern countryside of Tan-
 yang near the Shanghai-Nanking Railway).  One incident involved peasant
 resistance against a pawnshop which tried to cheat them, and this happened
 this summer.  The pawnshop at Lu'ch'eng-chen was looted one day by the
 remnant soldiers under Ma Pu-jen that had become bandits at Mao-shan, west
 of Tan-yang.  They did not loot too much from the pawnshop.  But in re-
 porting the case, the proprietor of the pawnshop lied, alleging that all
 the pawned items, including clothes and valuables, had been looted.  In the
 meantime, he moved these things secretely to some hiding place.  When the
 peasants of nearby villages who had pawned their belongings there heard about
 this trick, they went out to intercept him, recovering some of the original
 articles, but they could not get what had been concealed by the pawnshop.
 The peasants who had pawned their things joined together  to set up a
 "Pawners' Union" in order to ask the pawnshop for settlement.  As a result,
 the pawnshop repaid some of the losses, that is, each pawner getting the
 amount equivalent to the pawn price, reaching 900 dollars of compensation in
 full settlement.  This episode proves.that if the peasants are united, they
 will have victory.  But if they had no solidarity, then they would have been
 cheated by the pawnshop, losing all their pawned articles.  The other in-
 cident is resistance against the evil gentry and rich peasants who forced
 the tenant and poor peasants to pay money for pumping water.  This has hap-
 pened in this year's summer and fall, but it has not yet been settled.  In
 the villages of most countries in Kiangsu, a kind of machine-pumping has
 been generally-adopted.   This is called a "water-pump machine" which re-
 places the old hand and foot waterwheels to pump water.  The peasants of
 several villages near Lu-ch'eng-chen have realized that it would be desirable
 to use machinery to pump water.  However, the evil gentry and rich peasants
 there took advantage of this situation to organize a "Machine Pumping Company"
 in order to make some quick profit.  They raised 1,400 yuan as capital, bought
 a set of machinery which was installed in the river, and issued a notice in
 the name of the company that the peasants who wish to pump water pay an an-
 nual fee per-mou of land.  Those who do not pay would not get water.  But
 the peasants have also made their own calculations.   They found out that
 the money paid for each mou of land each year in these villages would be
 enough to buy a machine.  If they should raise money to buy one, they would
 have to pay one time only, but they could use it every year.  And if they
 use the company's machine, then they must pay so much each year.  Conse-
 quently, they expressed their vehement opposition to the company of evil
 gentry and rich peasants.  In the meantime, several primary school teachers
 volunteered to help the peasants in setting up an organization called
 "Peasants Promotion Association,"  Under the association's sponsorship,
 a "Machine Pumping Cooperative" was formed, collecting money from its mem-
 ber peasants according to their acreage, raising 1,400 yuan to buy a

 pumping machine.  The offshoot is there are now two pumping machines in the
 river, one owned by the company and the other by the cooperative.  But no-
 body would care to use the former which is now completely idle.  Enraged,
 the bad gentry made many false charges and pleaded with Sun Ch'uan-fang.
 As a result, soldiers were sent into the countryside in search of Bolsheviks,
 arresting four persons, and placing three others on their wanted list.  It
 was further announced that those who refused to use the company's machine
 would be dealt  with severely.  When the soldiers arrived, all able-bodied
 men in the village hid in the tall rice stalks, leaving only the old, the
 women and children to confront them.  In order to avoid arrest, the accused
 peasants had to offer bribes to the soldiers amounting to 1,000 yuan or more.
 This does not include what the latter had looted during the searches.  The
 case has not yet been closed.  It is gratifying that Sun Ch'uan-fang is now
 in some predicament, so the bad gentry of Lu-ch'eng-chen might have to let
 it go.
 Wu-hsi:  At Hus-hang-chen, about 15 li from the city of Wu-hsi, a minor
 incident occurred recently.  Jung Te-sheng, a prominent tycoon and big land-
 lord here, attempted to build a road through the village.  Houses and farm-
 land was condemned at low prices.  This would directly hurt the peasant econ-
 omy, so the peasants formed a peasants' club to oppose Jung Te-sheng.  Jung
 capitulated, offering 200 yuan for each mou of land, and 10 cents each for
 the newly planted mulberry trees, and promised to stop tearing down the
 houses in the village.
 Ch'ing-p'u:   In Ch'ing-p'u county along the Shanghai-Hangchow Railway, an
 incident occurred last month when peasants there opposed the sale of waste-
 land at inflated prices.  When peasants bought wasteland before, they used*
 to pay 3 yuan per mou.  However, some bad gentry colluded with magistrate
 Lin Cheng-i to form a company which obtained wasteland at 3 yuan per mou,
 selling it to peasants at 12 yuan.  The peasants joined together to set up
 a reclamation union to oppose it, but they have been intimidated by the
 gentry as well as the bureaucrats.  The dispute is still unsettled.
 T'ai-hsing:  At Wang-chia-chuang in the eastern countryside, peasants
 demanded rent reduction because of this year's drought.  A violent struggle
 against the landlords ensued.  The landlords not only refused to reduce
 rents, but tried to apply pressures on the peasants.  One of the peasants
 became so exacerbated that he attempted to kill a notorious landlord.  The
 latter reported it to the magistrate, and 30 peasants were arrested and
 imprisoned.
 T'ai-hsien: The peasants of Sen-sen-chuang, T.'ai-hsien, started a movement
 to demand rent reduction, as there was a drought in summer.   Several leaders
 were arrested by the government under the pressure of landlords.
 Hsu-chou:  Among the peasants of Kiangsu, those in Hsu-hai north of the
 Yangtze suffer the worst agonies.  The Red Spear Society and the Lien-
 chuang Society proliferate, and rural struggles are more numerous than

 elsewhere.  The terrain of the eastern and northern parts of Tung-shan
 county being low, rice crops were submerged under water last year.  It is
 fortunate that the second wheat crop has been planted, and so peasants may
 hope to tide over the famine.  The lingering rains this fall have resulted
 in flooding the rice fields, and the wheat crop has deteriorated.  It is
 still uncertain as to when the second wheat crop can be planted.  Consequent-
 ly, there is general dismay.  In the meantime, apart from natural disasters,
 the peasants have been plagued by the oppressions and exploitations of greedy
 warlords and bureaucrats.  Many peasants have degenerated and drifted to
 become bandits.  This is-why Hsuchow and its vicinities have become known as
 a bandit-infested area.
 Tz'u-ch'i:  Tz'u-ch'i is in Chekiang, west of Ningpo.  Recently, a big riot
 occurred in the Shan-pei region where the peasants were sturdy and armed
 feuds have been recurrent. Moreover, coupled with the unreasonable oppressions
 of the bureaucrats and police, and the intensified exploitations of evil
 gentry and landlords, the peasants have become more and more enraged and
 hateful.  It transpired that weather conditions have been bad this year.
 Both cotton and rice harvests were poor, but the landlords refused to reduce
 any rent.  This has led to the eruption of a peasant riot stemming from
 famine.  As the riot began, it was joined immediately by the vagrant prole-
 tariat.                       On the morning of 13 September, some 2,000 people gathered at the
 police office to report famine and they clashed with the police, setting
 the premises on fire, and seizing policemen's rifles.  The crowd then turned
 to the homes of the gentry and landlords to "eat up the big families."  They
 continued their rampage by destroying the antiques and furniture, windows
 and cabinets, and whatever they found in the latter's homes.  They did
 this every day and refused to desist.  Then, the villaege gentry escaped
 to the city to make accusations.  Soldiers and policemen were sent into the
 countryside to arrest the delinquent peasants, but the ringleaders had
 mostly fled.  "Crime" and "violation of law" have become a commonplace slogan,
 and the peasants lost their courage.  The riot was suppressed.  The failure
 of this riot has been caused-.by the lack of organization and guidance among
 the masses.  Thus, it became a primitive riot which ended in a debacle.

 DECLARATION OF THE FIRST HUNAN PEASANT CONGRESS
 (Text)  Under the political and economic oppression of imperialism and
 feudalism, the life of the peasants grows worse day by day.  Many are "with-
 out a tile over their heads or an inch of ground under their feet," truly
 homeless and jobless.
 Ever since the power of imperialism invaded the orient destroying our "closed
 door policy," and bursting open our agricultural economy, our Chinese peasants
 have become the slaves of foreign capitalists.  We labor every day to produce
 much grain, cotton, hemp, silk and tea and they merely produce a little cash
 and buy it up; they use machines to manufacture all kinds of newfangled goods,
 ship them over here, and sell them for God knows how much cash.   Stuff like
 foreign oil, foreign cloth, foreign nails, foreign ceramics and foreign iron--
 a limitless number of foreign goods have all flooded our cities and are
 gradually forcing their way into our villages.  There is no one to buy our
 native goods produced without machines and we can't even make a little cash
 by farming while the foreign goods makers get richer every day.
 The way in which the imperialists exploit us is to dominate our Customs and
 ship in goods freely for sale at low prices, taking our silver and destroying
 our handicrafts industry; it is to dominate our mines, our railroads, our
 waterways, to start factories and banks, using our cheap resources to make
 goods for themselves, and taking our coal and iron to control transportation.
 The imperialists and the warlords have, moreover, colluded to exploit the
 peasants indirectly by imposing local taxes and the salt tax and directly
 through acreage tax and surtaxes.   In addition, the imperialists have made
 many loans to the warlords who in turn exploit the peasants even more
 severely in order to repay them.   The warlords also use unemployed peasants
 as mercenary soldiers with weapons supplied by the imperialists to create
 a force with which to oppress the peasants.
 The imperialists exercise their money and military power and collude with
 the warlords and cbmpradors and after having done this for a while in China
 the product of the peasants labor finds its way by twist and turn into
 their pockets.

 The exploitation of the peasants by internal warlords and local bullies and
 rotten gentry is a kind of feudal exploitive system.  They do not exploit
 hired labor as does the capitalist but take away a large portion of the
 peasants' produce--this is the rent and tax system.  So the landlords exploit
 the peasants directly and indirectly (e.g., through the tenant peasant
 system), and so the warlords exploit them directly (e.g., with respect to
 owner-peasants) or indirectly (e.g., with respect to tenant peasants).
 Every year they rake off about 60 to 65 percent of the peasants harvest.
 They conspire together and coordinate with the imperialists and compradors
 to squeeze the peasants' blood and sweat and to jointly suppress the
 peasants' resistance.  When a drought comes and the peasants are driven
 to the end of their forbearance, they naturally rise up violently, often
 threatening the overthrow of feudalism and imperialism.
 The Taiping Rebellion was an explosion of south China peasants.   The Boxer
 Rebellion was an explosion of north China peasants.  Both, however, were
 repressed by the reactionary forces of imperialism and feudalism.
 But the revolutionary movement latent in peasant villages has not been
 dissipated by the suppression of the imperialists and feudal classes.   Such
 organizations as the San Ho Hui, the San Tien Hui, the Ta Tao Hui, the
 Ko Lao Hui which pervade the southern provinces and the Nien Tzu, the
 Pai Lang and the Hung Ch'iang Hui in the north have been spontaneously
 created to struggle with the imperialists and the feudal classes.  For this
 reason, cases of missionaries being killed and starving peasants rioting
 are frequent (the most notable in recent years being the burning of the
 Governor of Hunan's office in the 1908-1911 period, and the Lin-ch'eng
 railway car hijacking case, both of which were done by these people).
 These revolutionary organizations have no broad united front and do not
 understand political strategy and so can never do anything of great
 significance.
 The organized, planned revolution by the workers of the world has given us
 a fine example.   Mr Sun Yat-sen and the Kuomintang which he leads got in
 touch with these naturally occurring revolutionary groups in the villages
 some 20 years ago and guided them to the path of the true political party
 to lead our peasant revolution.  In politics they "build democracy" and in
 economics they established "equal land rights" as the standards for the
 liberation of the peasants; they always provided we peasants with an
 appropriate policy with which to fight imperialism and the feudal classes
 and attain our goals.
 Many years ago in Heng-shan and Yueh-pei the peasants of Hunan began to
 develop organizational shoots.  Year before last during the first half of
 the year some of the peasants of Hsiang-t'an again rose up but they were
 massacred by the warlord Chao and could not develop successfully.  In
 February of last year in Chu-thou Mr Wang Hsien-tsung became a martyr to
 the peasants cause.   The violence of the warlords and local bullies reached

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 a peak and the peasants were in a high state of emotion.   The saying goes
 "when things reach their worst, there must be.a turn for the better."  At
 this time a fierce campaign to drive out Chao Heng-t'i was born and in this
 the peasants constituted a major force.   At the time when Wu and Yeh made
 their counterattack, the peasants acted as spies, transport and guides for
 the Northern Expedition Army and disrupted the enemy's rear.   They even took
 up lances and birdguns and became guerrillas or joined in battles, such as
 at places like Li-ling, Chu-chou, P'ing-chiang and Hua-jung.   No less than
 10 battles have had peasant participation and many peasants have been killed.
 See how brave and willing to sacrifice themselves have been the Hunan peasants
 who have participated in the battles of the Northern Expedition!
 When the Northern Expedition Army moved into Hupeh and Kiangsi and on to the
 Chekiang-Honan front, the peasants in Hunan devoted all their efforts towards
 consolidating the rear, overthrowing corrupt officials and throwing out the
 local bullies and rotten gentry.  This movement was extremely broad.  The
 local bullies, rotten gentry and corrupt officials almost everywhere were
 utterly shocked.  No more do they dare to exercise the power and high-
 handedness to which they have been accustomed and treat the peasants as dirt
 as they did.  Since we peasants do not understand gentility or manners, we
 stand up straight, beat up every corrupt official, local bully and rotten
 gentry we hear about, not fearing that they may get together some remnants
 of their power for a counterattack and may kill peasants on a large scale
 such as at Chia-ho, Lin-hsiang, Yu-hsien, I-yang, An-hua and I-chang.
 As these tragedies occur, we know that they are but the dying outbursts of
 a departing storm and we have nothing to fear.  This bit of revolutionary
 work, we would dare compare with the taking of the city of Wu-ch'ang.   This
 is true because the power of the local bullies and rotten gentry of the
 villages is the true foundation of the warlords, and the destruction of this
 power would be difficult to accomplish without a rising by the peasants.
 The primary task of the present revolutionary government should, we feel,
 be to continue to dig up the political foundations of the warlords and
 develop the organization of the masses; we peasants will brave death to
 support the government as it works toward this goal.
 But, the aim of the national revolution is to liberate all of the oppressed
 masses, not just to liberate the peasants.  How can we restrict our concern
 to the liberation of the peasants?  We cannot.   But the liberation of the
 peasants is a pivotal point.   If the liberation of the peasants is realized,
 the interest of all classes is served.   At present, one of the main reasons
 why industry and commerce are not developed is that 300 million peasants have
 no purchasing power; and the reason why agriculture is not developed is that
 the peasants have no productive power.   If the peasants are liberated and
 they can lessen the economic exploitation of the landlords they will improve
 agriculture and, as a result of their purchases of fertilizer, tools and
 cloth, industry and commerce will simultaneously develop.  In the French
 Revolution of years ago the peasants obtained a measure of liberation and
 the wealth of France was greatly increased; in recent years the peasants of

 Russia have completely done away with exploitation by landlords and their pro-
 ductive power increases year after year.  These are both clear proofs of this.
 If industry and commerce profit by the liberation of the peasants, how much
 more so will education, culture and all kinds of construction.
 However, the present financial difficulties of the government, the stagnant
 money market, the extraordinary terrorism in society and many rumors, are all
 blamed on the peasants and believed to be the result of the peasant revolution.
 How they have wronged us!  The fears of today do have causes.  One is that
 due to wartime blockades, rice cannot be shipped down the Yangtzu River and
 salt cannot be brought in to Hunan.  With this is lost all of the vast income
 from taxes on rice and salt sales.   Another is that finances have not been
 unified in western Hunan, and the Kweichow Army and other newly formed units
 have been syphoning off tax revenue so that one-third of the financial re-
 sources of all. Hunan are lost.  Another is manipulation by reactionaries,
 for example, the attack on the Lai-yang Tax Bureau.  Although this was
 partially the result of corruption in the tax bureau which merited the
 attack, it was also the result of reactionaries taking the opportunity to
 create hatred among the party, government and mass organizations.  The re-
 actionaries have done many similar things, and for these reasons they have
 been able to create disorder in society.  How can the disorder be attributed
 to the peasants?
 Although the attacks by the peasants on the local bullies and rotten gentry
 in the villages have used illegal methods, these are methods which must be
 adopted in the course of revolutionary struggle.  At a time when the East
 wind will overcome the West wind or be overcome by it, how can we not be
 severe?  If we are afraid of conflict or adopt an attitude of doubt or
 negativism, we cannot be considered revolutionaries.   The old policies which
 did away with conflict are not suitable; we have only the new policy estab-
 lished by us all, that of bringing about democratic government by the
 peasants in the villages and thoroughly destroying the feudal policy of
 the local bullies and rotten gentry.
 This Congress, representing Hunan's 27 million peasants, after careful
 consideration, has decided upon a policy of revolutionary struggle from
 now on to achieve liberation.
 Peasants to Hunan!   Unite under the banner of the Provincial Peasants
 Association and resolutely fight according to the policy of this Congress!

 (B)   Peasant Participation in the Northern Expedition
 (1)   Supply:   In those places through which the Northern Expedition Army
 passed, the peasants were able to supply drink or small amount of food or
 were able to assist with such things as cooking.
 (2)   Guides, Reconnaissance:  This kind of work was done along the Chu-chou
 P'ing-hsiang Rail Line, and in Liu-yang, P'in-chiang, Ch'ang-sha, Hsiang-t'an,
 Ning-hsiang, Heng-shan, Nan-hsien and Hua-jung.
 (3)   Transport:   In addition to those peasants voluntarily hired by the
 army, there were also organized peasants doing transportation work for the
 army.

 (4)      Disrupting the enemy's rear:  This took place in Hsiang-t'an, Ping-chiang,
 Nan-hsien, Liu-yang and along the Chu-chou-P'ing-hsiang Rail Line.
 (5)   Participation in Combat:  Exact statistics are not yet available on the
 number of killed and wounded or the number of rifles captured.  The figures
 are approximately as follows:
 A.   Chu-chou:  The second time Tang [Sheng-chih]'s army entered Ch'ang-sha,
 the peasants and shopkeepers turned over more than 100 rifles plus some machine-
 guns and cannon.
 B.   Li-ling:  When the Northern Expedition Army entered Ch'ang-sha, the
 peasants captured more than 200 rifles as well as some machine guns and
 cannon, and in November when troops retreating from the Kiangsi front entered
 Li-ling, the peasants turned over many rifles.
 C.   P'ing-chiang:  When the Northern Expedition Army entered P'ing-hsiang in
 July, the peasants lost 25 men in combat and captured hundreds of rifles as
 well as machine guns.  In November, when the Second Division mutinied, the
 peasants captured some of the rebel soldiers and 250 rifles.  The government
 is now trying to get those rifles back, but the peasants refuse to comply,
 and the issue is still unsettled.
 D.  Liu-yang:  The peasants rescued a regiment of the Northern Expedition
 Army which had been surrounded and, in driving the enemy back, sustained
 casualties but captured some rifles.
 E.  Hua-jung:  When Tsai Chien's Army entered Hua-jung_ the first time, the
 peasants and the troops stationed there drove them back.  The second time
 Ts'ai Chien's Army entered Hua'jung, 3,000 peasants fought and repulsed it.
 F.  Yuan-chiang:  When Ts'ai Chien's Army was attacked at Hua-jung the first
 time, peasants from Yuan-chiang participated.
 G.  Hsiang-t'an:  The peasants acted as decoys and helped the Northern
 Expedition Army to cross the river and attack the enemy.
 H.  Ning-hsiang:  Rescued a regiment of the Northern Expedition Army which
 had been surrounded, and attacked the enemy and captured rifles.
 I.  Chu-chou-P'ing-hsiang Rail Line:   Clashed with enemy troops and tore
 up tracks.
 J.  Ch'ang-sha:   Surrounded fleeing officers, and assisted the government
 in capturing enemy soldiers and mutineers.
 (6) Why the Peasants Fought
 A.  The effects of propaganda by party members.  The peasants all knew that
 the Northern Expedition Army supported the interests of the workers and
 peasants, and that only by helping the Northern Expedition Army to win could
 they be helped.

 B.   Hatred for northern soldiers and mercenaries. When they compared the
 armies of the two sides, the hatred of the peasants was even more deep.
 C.   Under command of the Peasant Associations.   (A very small number were
 volunteers.)
 D.   The peasants were willing to fight during September and October in
 order to get rifles; by that time the peasants developed a need to arm
 themselves.
 (7)  The Effects of the Peasants' Participation in the War
 A.   Advances in the political sense of the peasants.
 B.   Advances in the self-confidence of the peasants.
 C.   The government was able to realize the strength of the peasants, thus
 favoring leftism.
 (C)  Current Trends Among the Peasants
 (1)  The peasants now feel that they should be rewarded for their contribu-
 tion to the war.   Even in those counties which were not involved in the
 fighting, the peasants feel that the propaganda promises of the party should
 be fulfilled.
 (2)  Economic demand:   This kind of demand has spread throughout all of the
 counties that have peasant movements.   The following demands are most
 pervasive:
 1.   Rent reduction--There is yet no demand for total rent exemption (land
 ownership granted to the peasants).
 2.   Interest rate reduction--The peasants are satisfied by a reduction from
 8 to 9 percent to 4 to 5 percent.
 3.   A way to solve the problem of short grain supplies in lean months--
 Resulting in a movement to refuse selling grain to government at low prices.
 4.   Tax reduction--A small number of localities demand total tax exemption.
 5.   Reduce security money and stop repossessing land without cause--As yet
 there are no clear ideas.
 These demands may be said to be minimal and are all expressed by them of
 their own accord.   In some areas all of these demands are made, but in some
 areas only one or two.   The demands of those peasants in the area of Hunan
 bordering on Kwangtung and Kwangsi are higher than those of the peasants
 of central Hunan.

 (3)   Political Demands:
 1.  Reform the militia--They still watch the personnel of the Militia Bureaus
 very closely.
 2.  Oppose the militia--In many places the militia has lost its function and
 there are many instances of militia headquarters being destroyed.
 3.  Wish for good government--The political and economic demands of the
 peasants are all still quite naive.  Not only the peasants are uninterested
 in such slogans as popular election of county magistrates, but the political
 demands of the villages are also negative.  As far as the rumors spread by
 reactionaries such as "confiscation of land" and "organization of a worker-
 peasant government" are concerned, the peasants are least interested.
 (4)  Arms Demands:  The demand of the peasants for arms grows more and more
 urgent.  They all want to take rifles from the hands of defeated and mutinous
 soldiers.  Among the peasants of P ing-chiang there is a vigorous movement
 to keep the rifles (see previous passages on the peasants' participation
 in fighting).
 (D)  Struggles Which Have Already Been Started by the Peasants
 (1)  The rent reduction movement:
 1.  The rent reduction movement in Heng-yang:  The amount of rent paid by the
 tenant to the landlord in Heng-yang is supposed to be one-half of the har-
 vest, but in actuality, the tenant cannot get as much as half.   From 1916,
 due to floods and increases in education expenses, rents have gradually
 increased throughtout the county and, although the amount of the increase
 has not been uniform, there is no one who has not had his rent increased.
 In. this way, the amount received by the tenant is less than the amount
 formerly received which even then was not 50 percent.  After T'ang's Army
 left Hunan, the peasants in Heng-yang who joined the peasant associations
 had an urgent demand for rent reduction.  At this time they started the
 slogan of rent reversion throughout the whole county, or reverting to the
 rent levels of 5 years ago (that is, before 1916).  The result was that
 the whole county reverted to the rent level of 1916.   The peasants joining
 the peasant association during this movement numbered about 7.0,000.   At the
 same time, reactionary elements were united during this movement which was
 participated in by all peasants whether they had or had not joined the
 peasant association.
 2.   Rent reduction elsewhere:   In addition to Heng-yang, there have been
 scattered rent reduction campaigns elsewhere, and individual tenants have
 reduced rent paid to individual landlords.   Since changes in tenants or
 changes in land ownership almost everywhere result in increases in rent,
 when the. increase is too much, tenants are requesting reductions.  Many of
 these cases are handled for the peasants by the peasant associations.
 Although this is not a struggle, it increases the confidence of the
 peasants in the peasant associations.

 3.   Although rent reduction campaigns are a pressing need of the peasants
 everywhere, no struggle has occurred because the time of rent collection
 is past.  The opinion of most peasants is that the question of rent reduc-
 tion next year will be a major struggle.
 (2)  Interest reduction:
 1.   A general interest reduction has been successful throughout An-hua County.
 This has been from 7 or 8 percent per month to 4 or 5 percent.  The peasants
 are satisfied with this.
 2.   A campaign among some of the peasants in Yueh-yang has not yet had any
 results, but probably will be victorious.
 3.   A demand by peasants in Hsiang-yin and Niu-chou for cancellation of
 unpaid interest has failed.
 4.   Various counties have interest reduction campaigns and none of these met
 with any major obstacles.
 (3)  Reduction in security money:
 1.   A campaign throughout Liu-yang County to reduce security money to 2 yuan
 for every picul of grain to be paid as rent has been successful.  Whether
 there will be problems with this in the future is difficult to tell.
 2.   In the lake region around Yueh-yang, landlords wanted to increase
 security money to 7 yuan per picul of grain to be paid as rent and the
 peasants rose up in opposition.  The landlords have combined the militia
 of three counties to deal with this and there will be a big clash.
 3.   Various other counties have security money reduction campaigns on
 smaller scale.
 (4)  Tax reduction campaigns:
 1.   Yu-hsien, Li'ling and I-chang all have tax reduction campaigns.
 2.   An-hsiang has eliminated the acreage tax throughout the county but
 has increased the land surtax.
 3.   In Yueh-yang, some of the peasant campaigns which have been demanding
 the abolition of the acreage tax have come into conflict with the militia
 and nothing has been resolved.
 (5)  Land reclamation campaigns:  The peasants of An-hua demand that no
 rent be collected from coarse grain sown during the winter months.   Some
 have succeeded and others are still in dispute.

 (6) The question of restrictions on normal grain sales:
 1.  The cause:  Hunan has had droughts for many years in succession.  When
 the dry months come, the villages are short of grain or the price of grain
 skyrockets, and this has caused the peasants to carry out a movement to
 restrict grain sales.
 2.  This movement is carried out in 7 or 8 out of 10 places where there is
 .a peasant organization, in the following manners:
 A.  A decision on the price of grain is made by the peasant-association or
 the peasant assembly to forbid selling grain at a higher price.
 B.  Two or three grain prices are set and certain kinds of people are made
 to pay. certain prices.
 C.  Restrictions are placed on the amount of grain or rice to be transported
 outside.
 D.  Grain and rice are totally prohibited from being transported outside.
 E.  No price is set for grain until a drought occurs.
 F.  Several tenths of the rental grain are withheld.
 3.  The conflicts caused by this struggle:
 A.  Boycotts:  If landlords do not sell grain they are forced to sell, or
 even fined or beaten.
 B.  Secret sales:   If secret sales are discovered, the grain is confiscated
 or the owner fined.
 C.  Conflicts arise out of disputes on grain prices.
 4.  Effects:  The landlords and businessmen dislike these campaigns intensely
 while the landowning peasants and tenant farmers don't want them either,
 and since the government is urging the remission of land-tax and the landlords
 are complaining that they can't sell their grain, the government is quite
 dissatisfied also.
 5.  The policy of the provincial peasants association is that only a portion
 of rental grain will be permitted to be withheld as a reserve for sales
 at reasonable prices during drought seasons and that unlimited boycotts
 are not allowed.   This campaign has, however, already been accepted by the
 masses and it will be hard to change for a while.

 (7)  Conflicts with the militia:
 1.   The Chief of the Militia Bureau in Ning-hsiang (and the branch Bureaus'
 in the townships) are all elected by the township assemblies and, in those
 places where there is a peasant association, the peasants pay close attention
 to the persons elected.
 2.   Yueh-yang:
 A.   The Militia Bureau prohibited the peasants from meeting and there was a
 clash.   After petition by the peasants, the Militia Bureau was disbanded.
 B.   The peasants clashed with the Militia Bureau over acreage tax, and this
 issue has not yet been settled.
 C.   In two clashes with the militia, more than 10 peasants were shot to death.
 3.   The Chiaho militia has shot'some peasants to death.
 4.   In,Kuei-yang, reactionary elements conspired with the militia to send
 troops into the city to disband the peasant association..
 5.   In Tzu-hsing, the militia forced a reorganization of the peasants
 association.
 6.   In a fight between the peasants of Hsiang.t'an and the militia, one
 peasant was-shot to death.
 7.   In Niu-chou (Yueh-yang) the militia prohibited the peasants from organiz-
 ing an association.
 8.   There have been many conflicts in various places between peasants and
 the militia and, in most cases, the militia has won.
 (8)  Conflicts with the local bullies and rotten gentry:
 It may be said that conflicts between the peasants and local bullies and
 rotten gentry are occurring everywhere all the time.   The attacks of the
 local bullies and rotten gentry upon the peasants are worsening every day.
 The peasants have retorted with assault and battery, prosecution, parade,
 fine and expulsion.   Of course most of these are resulted from attacks
 by them upon the peasants and this has aroused the hatred of the masses.
 (E)   The State of Local Government
 (1)   In some townships, the peasants association has taken over the govern-
 ment.
 (2)   Township assemblies exist in many counties and act as the highest
 legislative organization of the township.   In a few counties, the Chief of
 the Militia Bureau and the county magistrate are elected by'the township
 assemblies.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 (3)   In a few localities the peasant association, the teachers union, the
 Chamber of Commerce, and the workers unions have united and taken over the
 government of the township.
 (4)   In .many localities, township government is in the hands of the
 Kuomintang Party Headquarters and they sympathize with or support the
 peasant movement.
 (5)   In most localities, the government is still controlled by the local
 bullies and rotten gentry in order to oppress the peasants.  In places where
 there are peasant associations, clashes occur frequently.
 (F)   Peasant Self-Defense Organizations
 (1)   Each county in Hunan has organized neighborhood defense units as ad-
 vocated by Tang Sheng-Chih.   Although the leadership of these organizations
 is in the hands of the gentry and the landlords, the members and lower level
 officers are all peasants.   In places where there is a peasants association,
 these units become organizations of the peasants without trouble.   The units
 do not have rifles, but do have lances (a dagger attached to a long pole),
 birdguns and swords.  Most have regular drills, for which participants are
 paid (500 wen each).  The counties in the central Hunan area around
 P'ing-chiang, Liu-yang and Ch'ang-sha have this kind of organization but it
 is not widespread, and there is no drill pay.   In the recent fighting and
 in resisting bandits, they have been of great use.   There are no statistics
 on their organization and membership.
 (2)  With the exception of the neighborhood defense units, the peasants of
 Hunan have no other self-defense organization.  Although there was once a
 Peasant Self-Defense Army, and Self-Defense Regiments, these have been
 discontinued because their operating expenses could not be met.
 (3)  In such places as P'ing-chiang, An-hua, Li-ling and Hsiang-t'an,
 the peasants have captured a few rifles (P'ing-chiang has 250, and there
 are problems yet to be solved) which can be brought out for use by the
 peasants in their own defense.
 (G)  Measures Adopted by the Local Bullies and Rotten Gentry to Undermine
 the Peasant Movement
 The local bullies and rotten gentry are gradually united with all other
 reactionary forces.   They attack the peasants in the following ways:
 (1)  They secretly organize such groups as the Protect the Rich League,
 the Protect Property League and the White League.   They publicly organize
 the League of District Magistrates and the Township League.
 (2)  They clamor that the peasant association is going to institute
 conscription and tolls and, that when Wu P'ei-fu comes he will cut their
 heads off, in order to frighten the peasants and keep them from joining
 the association.

 (3)  They clamor that the peasant association is communist and will institute
 a so-called 3-3-1 system.
 (4)  They organize fake peasant associations and publish proclamations advo-
 cating a so-called 3-3-1 system.
 (5)  They infiltrate the peasant associations in order to usurp their leader-
 ship.  Failing to do so, they make trouble.
 (6) By means of bribery, sedition, promotion of homeland viewpoint,
 religious thinking and superstition, they incite the peasants to oppose the
 peasant association.
 (7)  They infiltrate the Kuomintang to oppress the peasants and manipulate
 the peasant associations.
 (8)  They clamor that the Northern Expedition Army has failed.
 (9)
 They collude with Chao and Sun of the Kuomintang right wing.
 (10)  Masquerading rioting peasants they destroyed the Tax Bureau in order
 to cause people to lose their sympathy for the peasants movement.
 (11)  They use the militia to directly oppress and kill the peasants, and
 disband peasant associations.  They have done such sabotage in a somewhat
 coordinated way.

 VOLUME 2
 LATEST DIRECTIVE OF NATIONAL PEASANT ASSOCIATION
 13 June 1927
 [Text] Because of the overly fast development of the peasant movement in the
 past, it has not been perfect organizationally.   Coupled with the fierce
 counterattack of the local despots and evil gentry, this caused the rural
 struggle to become more and more severe. Unorganized actions have occurred
 whenever the superior organs failed to point out all possibilities.  This
 association has instructed the peasant associations at all levels to make
 rectifications, so that the peasants in all places could, under the direction
 of the Peasant Association, continue to struggle against the reactionary
 feudal forces of all local despots and evil gentry with organization and
 planning, to fulfill the responsibility of overthrowing the economic base
 of the imperialist exploitation in the countryside and the political base
 of the warlords' domination in the revolution.  It has also been pointed out
 that the present struggle goal should be to establish rural self-government
 by the peasants everywhere.  According to reports from all quarters, the
 attack by local despots and evil gentry in the three provinces of Hunan,
 Kiangsi and Hupeh has been most vicious, as more than 10,000 party members,
 peasants and workers have been killed.  A sinister plot to incite revolution-
 ary soldiers against the peasants is being pushed.  They have often fabri-
 cated facts by calling a deer a horse, and exaggerated things in the hope
 of provoking the soldiers to clash with mass organizations, thereby alienat-
 ing the army and the people, splitting the united front and sabotaging the
 Three Great Policies, in order to overthrow the party and the country.   They
 would have no regret even though this would aggravate the agonies of the
 people and bring about national destruction.   In the meantime, the corrupt
 bureaucrats have connived with the local despots and evil gentry in
 smearing the peasants, hoping to alienate the government from the people.
 For instance,.the Peasant Association of Huang-kang has never tried to
 destroy tobacco crops, but the corrupt bureaucrats made a false report to
 the Central Government which disbanded the association.  This is a case in
 point.  Now, the Military Affairs Committee of the National Government has
 learned of the vicious plan of imperialism, warlords, corrupt bureaucrats,
 local despots and evil gentry, compradores and all the reactionary forces to
 unleash a concerted attack on the National Government just as our armies

 are launching the northern expedition against the Fengt'ien armed forces.
 It has therefore issued a directive to all armed comrades that they should
 not listen to false accusations and exaggerated propaganda.   In order not
 to fall into a trap of the reactionaries, they should limit their actions
 to making investigations only.  Nonetheless, the slaughtering of peasants
 by local despots and evil gentry in conjunction with bandits and stragglers
 in the various cities have become more and more serious recently.  Numerous
 instances have occurred in which conspiracies were hatched by corrupt
 bureaucrats to undermine relations between the government and the people.
 The various organs have received several cases of false accusations against
 peasants everyday.  Under these circumstances, the peasant associations
 at all levels should request that the National Government (1) issue a
 directive to protect workers' organizations, workers' pickets, and the
 peasants self-defense army, and punish the reactionaries that slaughtered
 workers and peasants and sabotaged the rear, in order that such revolutionary
 organs as the trade union, peasant association and CP may have complete
 freedom to rally the revolutionary forces and to launch an anti-Chiang
 expedition; (2) liquidate the local despots and evil gentry in the various
 counties in Hupeh who connived with enemy soldiers and bandits to slaughter
 peasants and workers, and severely punish Chiang Kai-shek's agents and all
 reactionaries who spread divisive rumors in order to consolidate Wuhan;
 (3) issue a directive to punish Hsu K'o-hsiang [6079 0344 4382], Ch'ou Ao
 [0092 7663], P'eng Kuo-chun [1756 0948 6874] and Hsiao,Yu-k'un.[5618 5038 2492]
 and dissolve such reactionary organs as the Party Salvation Committee and
 Party Purification Committee, restore the Hunan Provincial Government,
 Provincial Party Committee, Provincial Trade Union and Provincial Peasant
 Association as well as all revolutionary organizations that have been des-
 troyed, accept the petition of the Hunan Petition Group, and instruct
 Tang Sheng-chih [0781 3932 2535], chairman of Hunan provincial government,
 to take immediate action to suppress the reactionaries in Hunan; and
 (4) issue a directive to stop all actions in Kiangsi to oust the CP and
 worker and peasant leaders, as well as to severely punish the reactionaries
 who slaughtered the masses.  It is incumbent on the Peasant Association itself
 to redouble its efforts to rally the peasants, tighten up the organization,
 and carry out armed self-defense in order to resist the armed attacks of
 local despots and evil gentry as well as to suppress the provocations by
 all reactionary and feudal forces.  This is necessary because if the
 local despots and evil gentry are not suppressed, it will be impossible to
 establish rural self-government and democratic power, nor the realization
 of economic construction, while the foundation of the National Government
 will never be consolidated.
 This directive is issued by the standing members of the Provisional Executive
 Committee of the National Peasant Association of China:  T'an Yen-k'ai
 [6223 1693 7065], T'an P'ing-shan [6223 1627 1472], Teng Yen-ta [6772 3348

 [Text] (3)  A certain comrade who has arrived in Hunan said that the Comintern
 has issued a new directive suggesting that the worker-peasant-soldier soviet
 be implemented immediately in China.  We have been very heartened by this
 news. Although objectively speaking, China has reached the 1917 era, we
 deemed before that it was still in 1905, which was a great mistake.   The
 soviet of workers, peasants and soldiers is completely in keeping with the
 objective conditions.  We should have the resolve to set up a worker, peasant
 and soldier soviet regime in the four provinces of Kwangtung, Hunan,Hupeh
 and Kiangsi.  With the establishment of such a regime, we must, henceforth,
 rapidly achieve nationwide victory.  We hope that the Central Committee will
 unhesitatingly accept this Comintern directive and implement it immediately
 in Hunan.
 In view of the fact that this new directive of the Comintern is bound to
 affect our attitude toward the Kuomintang, as soon as we set up the soviet
 regime of workers, peasants and soldiers, we can no longer carry the
 Kuomintang flag.  We should hoist high the flag of the Chinese Communist
 Party vis-a-vis the Kuomintang flag that has been hoisted by such warlords
 as Chiang Kai-shek, Tang Sheng-chih, Yen Hsi-shan and Feng Yu-hsiang.  The
 Kuomintang flag has been the flag of warlords for some time now and so only
 the. communist flag is the flag of the people.  When we were in Hupeh, we did
 not understand this too well.  But after being in Hunan for a few days, we
 have seen how the people regard the provincial party headquarters under
 Tang Sheng-chih, thus realizing that we really cannot fly the Kuomintang
 flag any longer or we are bound to be defeated.  Previously, we have failed
 to seek actively the Kuomintang's leadership power, but allowed Wang Ching-wei,
 Chiang Kai-shek, Tang Sheng-chih, etc., to seize it.  Now, we should return
 this flag to them, because it has become a black flag completely.  On our
 part, we must resolutely fly the red flag.  As for the petty bourgeoisie,
 we must keep them under the leadership of the red flag, and objectively,
 they must be placed entirely under the leadership of the red flag.

 Hsiang-t'an (from where five peasants have come to the provincial capital),
 I realize that it is the consensus of peasants that their agrarian problem
 must be resolved completely.  Yesterday, I talked with several peasant com-
 rades from the countryside to consult their views.  As a result, I have
 drafted the following outlines:
 (a)  Confiscate all land, including [that belonging to] small landlords
 and owner-peasants, and nationalize it.  Land would then be redistributed
 to all country people who wish to obtain land equitably on these two
 standards by the peasants association; in  accordance with "working ability"
 and "consumption" (that is, in keeping with the actual amount of consumption
 by each family).
 (b)  In redistributing land, the district peasants association should order
 the township peasants. association to compile a census register, to be handed
 over to the district association for redistribution of land accordingly.
 (c)  In redistributing land, the district, rather than township, should be
 used as the unit; in a township where there is greater population than land,
 it can be transferred to a township where there are fewer people but more
 land.  It is only thus that redistribution will be equitable.  Temporarily,
 it won't be possible for people to move from one district to another.
 (d)  After the land has been confiscated, measures must be provided to
 settle the families of landlords (whether they are big landlords or not) in
 order to pacify the people.  There should be four classes: class 1, 4 percent
 collection; class 2, 3 percent collection; class 3, 2 percent collection,
 and class 4, 1 percent collection.
 This draft proposal has been discussed at the provincial committee meeting
 yesterday.  We must canvass the views of more peasants before we will ask
 you to make the final decision.  The draft is submitted to you for references
 of discussion.  (abridged) 20 August

 LETTER FROM HUNAN PROVINCIAL COMMITTEE
 30 August 1927
 [Text] Brother X X:
 Your letter of Character Hsiang No 5 has been.received.  Concerning the two
 points of error mentioned therein, what you have said is not in keeping with
 either fact or theory.  We wish, therefore, to reply to you as follows:
 (1)  From the standpoint of the revolutionary significance as a whole, to
 capture Changsha and to stage the Autumn Harvest uprising are both for the
 purpose of promoting agrarian revolution.  The Changsha uprising and the
 Autumn Harvest uprising are the same thing.  Whereas the Changsha uprising
 serves as the starting point of the Autumn Harvest uprising, the Autumn
 Harvest uprising is to unleash an agrarian. revolution in order to seize
 political power.   In our plan to capture Changsha, the main fighters are
 workers and peasants.  The purpose of transferring the two X and X regiments
 to attack Changsha is to supplement the insufficiency in strength of the
 workers and peasants.  They are not the main force, but are deployed to
 serve as a cover for the development of the uprising, and so they are not
 the only important element of the uprising.  Your committee has deemed that
 this is a military adventure here, ordering that the plan for the Changsha
 uprising be canceled.  This shows your ignorance about the conditions here,
 and it is a contradictory policy in which no attention is paid to military
 affairs, but in the meantime, it calls for an armed uprising on the part
 of the masses.
 (2)  You have said that we have been paying attention here only to our work
 in Changsha, and neglected the other places.  This is not true.  It is true
 that we have been amiss in reporting to you the situation in other places
 where considerable preparations have been made (please see the plan on the
 uprising in central Hunan).   In regard to the problem of our work in
 southern Hunan, we must also explain that making Changsha the starting point
 of the uprising does not mean that we have given up southern Hunan.  The
 reason why we have not made Heng-yang the second starting point is because
 our strength is only sufficient to stage uprisings in central Hunan.  If
 there should be uprisings in the various counties, our strength will be
 so diffused that it will be impossible to implement the plan of uprising

 in central Hunan.  That is why we decided against making Heng-yang the second
 starting point.  Nonetheless, where plans for uprising have been made and
 preparations are underway in the various counties in southern Hunan, we have
 already issued orders to them to carry out the uprisings effectively.  As
 soon as the Changsha uprising begins, it will be unleashed simultaneously
 in the other counties.  30 August

 REPORT OF THE CHING-KANG MOUNTAINS FRONT COMMITTEE TO CENTRAL AUTHORITY
 25 November 1928
 [Text]  To the Central Committee in care of the Hunan Provincial Committee:
 (1) Concerning the Letter From Central Committee
 The 4 June letter from the Central Committee, after passing through the
 Kiangsi Provincial Committee and the Chi-an County Committee, only arrived
 at the Ching-kang Mountains on 2 December.   Very well written, this letter
 has rectified many of our mistakes and resolved many controversial problems
 here.  Upon its receipt, this letter was forwarded to the army committee as
 well as to local committees at all levels.   On 6 November, the units heading
 toward Sui-ch'uan were concentrated at Ching-kang Mountains, and some 30
 persons including members of the Special Committee and the army's and local
 active elements (such as Chu Teh, Chen I, Ho Ting-yin [0149 2185 7336],
 Ho Ch'ang-kung [0149 7022], Yuan Wen-ts'ai [5913 2429 2088], Wang Tso
 [3769 0146], T'an Chen-lin [6223 7201 2651], Teng Kan-yuan [6772 1626 0337],

 Tso-nung [3769 0146 6593], Hsiao Fang-hsia [5618 5502 0704], Liu Hui-ch'ing
 [0491 6540 7230], Hsieh Ch'un-piao [6200 2504 2871], Liu Ti [6491 2420],
 Hsiung Shou-ch'i [3574 4388], Yang K'ai-wing [2769 7030 2494], Ts'ao Shuo
 [2580 7007], Teng Chiu-t'ing [6772 0036 6599], Mao Tse-tung, Sung Ch'iao-
 sheng [1345 0829 3932], P'eng Fu [1756 4375], and Yuan Te-sheng [5913 1795
 3932] representing the Hunan Provincial Committee) attended a meeting held
 by the Special Committee to discuss the letter from the Central Committee.
 The consensus was that with the exception of one or two specific points
 (such as the guerrilla area being too broad and the abolition of the party
 representative system), all principles and policies are practicable and
 should be carried out accordingly.  The highest organ of the party is also
 the front committee.  According to the letter, when the front committee is
 in Kiangsi, it is under the direction of the Kiangsi Provincial Committee,
 and when it is moved into Hunan, it should be then under the director of
 the Hunan Provincial Committee.  What is regrettable is that among the four
 attached documents in the Central Committee letter, we have translated only

 the two documents on "Confiscation of Land To Set Up Soviets" and "The
 February Resolution of the Comintern" while the two on "Military Works"
 and "Organizational Problems" cannot be translated,   The last two items
 are urgently needed.  Please tell us about the method of translation or
 send us another copy.
 (2)  Border Regimes and the August Defeat
 China is the only country in the world today where one or more small areas
 under a Red Regime have emerged in the midst of a white regime encircling
 them.  When we analyze the cause of this phenomenon it will be seen that
 it is due to the continuous conflicts and wars among China's compradores
 and powerful gentry.  As long as the conflicts and wars between these
 two classes continue, the existence and development of the armed entrench-
 ment by workers and peasants will also continue.  Where there are continued
 conflicts and wars between compradores and the powerful gentry, the existence
 and development of a soviet regime must have the following prerequisites:
 (1)  excellent masses, (2) a sound party, (3) a large, strong Red army,
 (4) terrain favorable to waging war, and (5) economic power for self-sustenance.
 Moreover, the strategy adopted by the border areas vis-a-vis the surrounding
 ruling classes should vary, depending on whether the political power of the
 ruling class is stable or in a state of disruption.  For instance, when there
 was disruption in the ruling class, such as during the war between
 Li Tsung-jen and Tang Sheng-chih in Hunan and Hupeh, and the war in
 Kwangtung between Chang Fa-k'uei and Li Chi-shen, we could be more venture-
 some in our military strategy, and the area of our military occupation could
 be expanded.  Nonetheless, attention must be paid to setting up a firm
 bastion in the central areas to serve as an impregnable bulwark when the
 White terror descends on us.  Where the ruling class is (comparatively)
 stable, such as in the southern provinces since April of this year, we should
 follow a strategy of gradual advance.  Militarily, what is most undesirable
 is to divide the forces for adventurous advances; in mass work (such as
 distribution of land, establishment of soviets, organization of party and
 local militia), what is most undesirable is the diffusion of manpower,
 instead of paying attention to lay a sound foundation for the central areas.
 The defeat of the small soviets in China has been due either to the lack
 of objective prerequisites or to subjective errors in tactics.   The reason
 why there have been errors in subjective tactics is because of the failure
 to differentiate the two different stages of the ruling class--when their
 regime is stable, and when their regime is in disruption.  When the political
 power of the ruling class is stable, some advocate that the armed forces be
 divided to make adventurous advances; they even advocate that the Red Guards
 alone be deployed to defend extensive soviet regime areas, as though ignorant
 of the fact that the enemy, apart from utilizing the house-to-house levies,
 is also capable of using regular forces for concentrated operations.   In mass
 work, no attention was paid to laying a firm foundation in the central areas,
 and, disregarding the potentials of our capacity,.they attempted unrestricted
 expansion.   If anyone advocated a policy of gradual military advance, and
 the concentration of manpower in the mass work in order to set up a solid

 foundation in the central areas, to achieve an invincible position, it would
 be dubbed "conservatism."  This is the basic reason for the August defeat in
 the border areas and the failure of the Red Army in Hunan.
 The border area work started in October last year.  At the beginning, there
 was no party organization whatsoever in the various counties, and the local
 militia consisted only of some 60 old rifles possessed by Wang Tso and
 Yuan Wen-ts'ai each in the vicinity of the Ching-kang Mountains.  The rifles
 of the peasant Self-defense Corps of the four counties of Yung-hsin, Lien -hua,
 Ch'a-ling and Ling-hsien have already been surrendered to the powerful
 gentry, with the result that the revolutionary ardor of the masses has been
 suppressed.   By February of this year, county committees had been set up in
 Ning-kang, Yung-hsin, Ch'a-ling and Sui-ch'uan; a special district committee
 was created in Ling-hsien.   Party organization has also been under way in
 Lien-hua, which has developed relations with the Wan-an committee.   Except
 for Ling-hsien, all the counties had a few local armed forces.   In Ning-kang,
 Ch'a-ling, Sui-ch'uan and Yung-hsin, especially in the two counties of
 Sui-ch'uan and Yung-hsin, considerable work has been done in unleashing the
 masses in guerrilla uprisings to kill the landlords, with much success.
 During this stage, the agrarian revolution has not yet been intensified,
 and the names used for the organs of political power were "Workers,peasants
 and soldiers' representatives' committee" and the "people's committee."
 They were known simply as the Government of the Workers, Peasants and Soldiers,
 without the title of soviet.  Soldiers' committees were organized in the army, and
 salary system, abolished.  When guerrillas were on active duty, action committees
 were organized to direct them.   These simple measures have been adopted
 partly by improvization, and partly on the basis of the announcement (such as
 the people's committees) of the 11 December uprising in Kwangtung which was
 reported in the newspapers.   This is because we have lost contact with the
 provincial committee since November, thus becoming completely uninformed
 about all party policies.   It was only in April this year that the resolution
 of the enlarged conference of the Central Committee in November which was
 so significant in China's revolutionary history was brought from Hunan to
 the border areas by Comrade Chu Teh and others.   It was also then that the
 impact of the resolution has reached the party organization in the border
 area.  The leading organ then was the Front Committee (of which.Mao Tse-tung
 was secretary) appointed by the Hunan Provincial Committee during the Autumn
 Harvest Uprising.  Early in March, the Front Committee was abolished at the
 suggestion of the Hunan Special Committee and reorganized as the Divisional
 Committee (with Ho Ting-ying as secretary).   It thus became a party organ
 for the army only and had no jurisdiction over the local party and was
 fraught with shortcomings.  Meanwhile, at the suggestions of the Southern
 Hunan Special Committee, Mao Tse-tung's units were transferred to Hunan,
 and for more than a month the border area was abandoned.  At the end of
 March came the defeat in Hunan.   The units of Chu Teh and Mao Tse-tung, as
 well as the peasant troops in southern Hunan, retreated to Ning-kang in
 April, thereby reoccupying the border area.

 After April, occupation of the Hunan-Kiangsi border area was effected at a
 time when the ruling power in the southern provinces was enjoying comparative
 stability. They were able to send out any time some 8 to 9 regiments and
 sometimes as many as 18 regiments from Hunan and Kiangsi for their suppres-
 sion campaign.  Yet, with fewer than four regiments of our own troops, we
 engaged the enemy for 4 months, while the occupied areas expanded, the
 agrarian revolution was intensified, the soviet organization was promoted,
 and the Red Army and Red Guards grew in number and strength steadily.   The
 reason for this is that the policy of the party in the border area (both
 local party and army party) was correct.   At that time, the policies of the
 Border Special Committee (with Mao Tse-tung as secretary) and the Army
 Committee (with Ch'en I as secretary) were:  To struggle resolutely against
 the enemy in order to establish political power in the middle section of
 Lo-hsiao Mountains and to oppose any defeatist flightism; to intensify
 agrarian revolution in the occupied areas; the army's party organization
 should help develop the local party, and the regular army should help
 develop the local militia forces; to be on the defense in Hunan where the
 ruling power is stronger, and to be on the offense in Kiangsi where the
 ruling power is weaker; devote great effort to develop Yung-hsin in order
 to create a regime of the masses, and to prepare for a protracted struggle;
 to concentrate the Red Army with a view to attacking the enemy confronting
 them at the proper time, and to oppose dispersion of armed forces in order
 to avert the danger of being destroyed individually; to adopt the tactic of
 expanding the areas under the regime by wave-like advances, and to oppose
 the policy of adventurist advance.   Thanks to the correctness of these
 tactics, coupled with the topography of the border area which was most favor-
 able to our struggle, as well as the fact that the attacking troops from Hunan
 and Kiangsi were badly coordinated, we were able to win military victories
 during the 4 months from April to July and insure the expansion of the masses'
 regime.   Although the enemy outnumbered us by several times, he failed to
 destroy the regime which was expanding steadily.   The impact of the regime
 was increasingly felt in the two provinces of Hunan and Kiangsi.   The
 August defeat was due solely to our ignorance of the fact that it was a time
 when the ruling class was relatively stable.  We adopted the kind of policy
 that was geared to a ruling class facing disruption.   Thus, in dividing our
 armed forces to make adventurous advance in southern Hunan, we incurred
 defeats in the border area and in southern Hunan as well.   Tu Hsiu-ching
 [2629 0208 4842], representative of the Hunan Provincial Committee, and
 Yang K'ai-ming, secretary of the Special Committee appointed by the
 Hunan Provincial Committee, carried out perfunctorily the orders of the Hunan
 Provincial Committee, taking advantage of the absence of such persons as
 Mao Tse-tung and Wan Hsi-hsien [5502 0341 2009] who were then in Yung-hsin
 and had objected to the orders strongly, without canvassing the situation
 then and disregarding the resolutions of the joint conference of the Army
 Committee, Special Committee and Yung-hsin County Committee which differed
 from the views of the Hunan Provincial Committee.   They also endorsed the
 action of the 29th regiment (I-chang peasants) to abandon the struggle to
 return home.   The result was to bring about defeat both in the border area
 and in southern Hunan, thus making a tremendous mistake.

 In the middle of July, the Eighth Army mounted an attack on the Kiangsi
 border, but it was unsuccessful.  As the bulk of the Red Army launched an
 offensive against Ling-hsien and Ch'a-ling, and was changing its plans to
 turn to southern Hunan, five, regiments commanded by Wang Chun [3769 0971]
 and Chin Han-ting [6855 3351 7844] in Kiangsi, and six regiments under
 Hu Wen-t'ou [5170 2429 2435], of the 6th Army, 11 regiments in all, laid
 siege to Yung-hsin.  We had only one regiment (commanded by Mao Tse-tung)
 in Yung-hsin which, shielded by the broad Red masses and resorting to
 guerrilla tactics on all sides, succeeded in pinning down these 11 enemy
 regiments within 30 li of the city for 25 days.   Finally, the enemy probed
 our weakness and captured Yung-hsin by a fierce assault, and its loss was
 followed by Lien-hua and Ning-kang.   At that time, some internal bickering
 flared up in the 6th Army, which withdrew suddenly and engaged Wang Chun's
 units at Chang-shu.   Only five Kiangsi regiments were left, and, panicked,
 they withdrew into the city of Yung-hsin.   Thus, if our main force had
 not gone to southern Hunan, it would undoubtedly, with the help of the
 masses, have routed this enemy force, and extended the regimes areas to in-
 clude Chi-an, An-fu and P'ing-hsiang, and linked it up with P'ing-chiang
 and Liu-yang.   But as the main force was away and the one remaining regiment
 was too exhausted and worn out, we decided to keep .part of it to defend the
 Ching-kang Mountains, together with the two units under Yuan Wen-ts'ai and
 Wang Tso, while ordering Mao Tse-tung to lead one battalion to Kuei-tung to
 meet the main force and escort it back.   By that time, the main force,
 which had started toward southern Hunan, was retreating to Kuei-tung,
 and the forces joined at Kuei-tung on 23 August.
 The 8th Army under Wu Shang [0742 1424] had invaded Ning-kang and again
 advanced into Yung-hsin.   Our enemy from Hunan was anxious to fight but
 could not (as our army missed his troops when we attacked from a side road).
 Fearing harassment by our masses, his army then retreated to Ch'a-ling by
 way of Lien-hua.   Just one day later, 11 regiments of our Kiangsi enemy
 moved into Yung-hsin.   At that time, the main force of the Red Army (led by
 Chu Teh) was attacking Ch'a-ling and Ling-hsien from Ning-kang.  Upon reach-
 ing Ling-hsien, the soldiers of the 29th Regiment, seized by deep homesick-
 ness, demanded to go back to Hunan and refused to take orders.  Another
 segment of our army was opposed to going back to southern Hunan, because
 they wanted to go to southern Kiangsi, and were also unwilling to turn to
 attack the enemy in Yung-hsin.   Their agitation was aided by Tu Hsiu-ching,
 and even the Army Committee was helpless in averting this unfavorable
 turn of events.   Consequently, the main force set out from Mien-tu in
 Ling-hsien on 17 July, moving toward Ch'en-chou via Tzu-hsing.   On 24 July
 a battle was fought against Pan Shih-sheng's [5400 4258 3932] units at
 o       Ch'en-chou.  Initial success was followed by defeat.  It was dusk when we
 withdrew and we took the wrong road.  The 29th Regiment hurried toward
 I-chang; a part of it was annihilated by Hu Feng-chang's [5170 7685 4545]
 men at Lo-ch'ang, while another part was scattered and lost in I-chang
 and Ch'en-chou.   Only some 100 rifles were recovered and assembled that
 night, though fortunately the loss sustained by the main force was small.

 Kuei-tung was occupied on 18 August.  On 23 August Mao Tse-tung and others
 arrived from the Ching-kang Mountains, and it was decided to return to
 Ning-kang.   That afternoon, two regiments of Wu Shang's troops in Ling-hsien
 launched a sharp attack on Kuei-tung and a hard fight lasted until the
 morning of.the ensuing day.  Our losses were heavy (though the enemy lost even
 more heavily).  We had to retreat into Kiangsi.  When our army was moving
 into southern Hunan from Mien-tu, the original Army Committee was abolished,
 and the Front Committee appointed by the Hunan Provincial Committee was
 organized, with Ch'en I as its secretary.  After the defeat at and retreat
 from Kuei-tung, the Front Committee was abolished, and the Action Committee
 was organized to.command it, with Mao' Tse-tung as its secretary.  On
 8 September we arrived at the Ching-kang Mountains via Chung-i, Shang-yu and
 Sui-ch'uan.
 The causes for the failure of our assault on Ch'en-chou were six-fold:
 (1)   Some officers and men were homesick, thus losing their fighting morale,
 and some of them were unwilling to go to southern Hunan, thus running counter
 to mass psychology;  (2) it was a hot summer and the soldiers were exhausted;
 (3) after marching several hundred li from Ling-hsien, we lost contact with
 the border area and became isolated; (4) the worker and peasant masses of
 Hunan have not been mobilized and so it became a simple military venture;
 (5) we were ignorant about the enemy situation; (6) preparations were inade-
 quate, and our officers and soldiers did not understand the significance of
 the war.
 After the rout, one infantry company and one artillery battery under battalion
 commander Yuan Ch'ung-ch'uan [5913 1504 0350] rebelled.   Although these two
 units were eventually recovered, the regimental commander, Wang Erh-cho
 [3769 3643 3820], was killed, which was of course a serious loss.
 On 30 August four regiments of Wu Shang's Hunan troops and Wang Chun's
 Kiangsi troops mounted a fierce attack on the Ching-kang Mountains, taking
 advantage of the fact that our forces had not yet arrived after their
 defeat at Kuei-tung.  We had less than a battalion, but relying on the
 natural barriers of Huang-yang-chieh (the path of the Ching-kang Mountains
 from Ning-kang), we fought bitterly for a.whole night, repulsing the enemy
 and killing many of them.  This campaign has enabled us to preserve our
 last bastion, and to frighten the enemy badly.   This was one of the famous
 battles in the border area.
 When the Front Committee was in Hunan, it organized two county committees
 in Kuei-tung and Ju-ch'eng which, together with the original county commit-
 tees in Tzu-hsing and Ch'en-chou, were placed under the direction of a
 Special Committee, with Tu Hsiu-ching as its secretary and located
 Yu-ch'i Shih-erh-tung in Tzu-hsing.   A Red Guard corps was formed for
 Tzu-hsing, Kuei-tung and Ju-ch'eng which received 80 rifles.   Ch'en-chou
 had a Red Guard corps located at Yao-ling, possessing some 40 or 50 rifles.
 The conditions in Lai-yang and Yung-hsing were unclear.   The 30th and
 33d regiments of the Peasant Army which returned to southern Hunan in May
 had long been dispersed, and most of their arms, some 300 to 400 rifles,
 had been surrendered to the enemy.  The broad masses that had been mobilized

 by the Red Army during the spring also were totally suppressed by the enemy.
 When the Red Army was passing through Tzu-hsing, Ju-ch'eng and Kuei-tung,
 some of the local masses were mobilized to set up soviets.  The sand fields
 in Kuei-tung were distributed, though their present status is unknown.
 Because of the barriers of communication, no letters have arrived from
 the newly organized Southern Hunan Special Committee.
 (3)  Status of Border Independent Regime From September to Present
 Since April of this year, the independent regime's areas have been extended
 steadily.   Following the battle at Lung-yuan-k'ou (on the border between
 Yung-hsin and Ning-kang) on 23 June and the routing of the enemy in Kiangsi
 for the fourth time, the border areas have reached their zenith [of develop-
 ment] comprising all three counties of Ning-kang, Yung-hsin and Lien-hua,
 small portions of Chi-an and An-fu, the northern part of Sui-ch'uan, and
 the southeastern part of Ling-hsien.  Most of the land has already been
 distributed, and the remainder is being distributed.  District and township
 soviets have been set up universally. There are county soviets in Ning-kang,
 Yung-hsin, Lien-hua and Sui-ch'uan, and a Border Area soviet has also been
 established.  In the villages, worker and peasant insurrection corps armed
 with spears have been organized,  At the district and county levels, Red
 Guards have been organized, armed with rifles.   In July, the enemy from
 Kiangsi attacked, and in August enemies from Kiangsi and Hunan joined forces
 to attack Huang-yang-chieh, with the result that all the county cities
 and plains have been occupied by the enemy.  The Peace Preservation Corps
 (armed with rifles) and the levies (armed with spears) acted as their
 vanguards.   They ran amok, spreading the White terror into both towns and
 the countryside.  Most of the party and government organs have disintegrated
 while the rich peasants and opportunists in the party have become undependable.
 As a result of the battle at Huang_yang-chieh on 30 August, the enemy realized
 that it was impossible to destroy the natural barriers of the Ching-kang
 Mountains.   The enemy from Hunan began to retreat to Ling-hsien, while the
 enemy from Kiangsi began to entrench itself in the county towns, and in the
 towns and villages on the plains.  Nevertheless, they could not do anything
 to us in our strongholds such as the western and northern districts of
 Ning-kang, the Pei-hsiang Tien-lung district of Yung-hsin, as well its
 Hsiao-hsi-chiang and Nan-nien-shan districts, the Shang-hsi district of
 Lien-hua, the Ching-kang Mountains district of Sui-ch'uan, and the
 Ch'ing-shih-kang Ta-yuan of Ling-hsien.   During July and August, scores of
 battles were fought by one regiment of the Red Army and by the Red Guards
 corps in various counties.   Although we were defeated, we lost no more
 than 30 rifles.   Finally, we withdrew deep into the mountains.  The enemy
 deployed its entire force to attack.   They combined the armed forces of
 Kiangsi and Hunan to attack our bastion in the Ching-kang Mountains, but
 they withdrew dismally.   On 30 August we won a.victory over the suppression
 armies at Huang-yang-chieh; on 8 September our southern expeditionary force
 returned to the Ching-kang Mountains, thus opening up a new situation after.
 September.

 As our army was marching to the Ching-kang Mountains through Ch'ung-i,
 Shang-yu and Sui-ch'uan, the Independent 7th Division of western Kiangsi
 under Liu Shih-i [6491 1102 3015], taking advantage of our defeat, sent
 five battalions to pursue us to Sui-ch'uan.  On 13 September we deployed
 four battalions to attack Liu's units, routed them at the city of Sui-ch'uan,
 captured 250 rifles, a battalion commander and a company leader, 34 platoon
 leaders and some 200 soldiers.   The remnants withdrew to Kan-chou.   The
 Action Committee which directed the army (with Mao Tse-tung as secretary)
 and the Sui-ch'uan county committee collaborated in guiding the masses of
 Sui-ch'uan and in canvassing supplies for the army.   Guerrilla action was
 conducted in the countryside, divided into four routes, each directed by
 an action committee.  When the eastern route committee reached Wan-an,
 it made contact with the Wan-an County Committee.   On 24 September
 Li Wen-pin's [2621 2429 2619] Kiangsi regiment came from T'ai-ho, while
 the Independent 7th Division came from Kan-chou to attack the city of
 Sui-ch'uan.   As our force was not concentrated, we could only deploy two
 battalions for the battle.  We were defeated, but morale remained intact.
 Our main force returned to the Ching-kang Mountains on 26 September.  On
 1 October we engaged the 27th regiment of Chou Hun-yuan's [0719 3268 0037]
 brigade under Hsiung Shih-hui [3574 1709 6540] in a battle at Ning-kang,
 capturing one battalion commander, one company leader, two platoon leaders,
 100 soldiers and 110 rifles.  Remnants of the enemy units retreated to
 Yung-hsin and the entire county of Ning-kang was recovered.  While we
 were attacking Ning-kang, the regiment under Li Wen-pin's command rein-
 forced the enemy forces via T'ai-ho and Yung-hsin from Sui-ch'uan,
 leaving only the Independent 7th Division (which was the weakest)  in
 Sui-ch'uan.  There was thus considerable hope for us to mobilize the masses
 in Sui-ch'uan, and moreover, we were faced with the urgent problem of
 seeding the army.  We, therefore, reoccupied Sui-ch'uan on 13 October, as
 the Independent 7th Division took flight without a fight.  The Action
 Committee of Sui-ch'uan (with Chu Teh as secretary) collaborated with the
 County Committee there to carry out guerrilla tactics in five routes,
 distributing land, setting up soviets, developing party organization, and
 collecting funds.  At that time, the 3d Division of the Eighth Army under
 Yen Chung-hsing [7051 0112 5887], with 126 rifles, had defected to our
 army and been reorganized as a special service battalion commanded by
 Pi Chan-yuan.   On 2 November Sui-ch'uan was again attacked by two regiments
 of the 21st Brigade of Kiangsi troops commanded by Li Wen-pin as well as
 the Independent 7th Division.  With a view to avoiding any hard battle,
 we evacuated Sui-ch'uan, trying to make a blitz attack on Ning-kang and
 Yung-hsin where the enemy forces were weaker, in order to break one side
 of the siege.   On 9 November we routed the 27th Regiment of Chou's brigade
 at the city of Ning=kang and Lung-yuan-k'ou, capturing 160 rifles, killing
 one battalion commander and scores of soldiers.  We captured two deputy
 battalion commanders, a company commander and a platoon leader, and more
 than 100 soldiers.  Next day, we advanced to Yung-hsin to attack the
 28th Regiment and the remnants of the 27th Regiment of Chou's brigade
 until  3 o'clock  in the afternoon.  We defeated the enemy and our vanguards
 occupied the city of Yung-hsin.  However, unexpectedly, the enemy 35th
 Brigade arrived from Hung-t'ien-ho as reinforcement.  We had to withdraw

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 to Ning-kang in the face of this adverse situation.  Although there were heavy
 casualties to the enemy, we also suffered scores of dead and wounded.   This
 was the biggest battle since our return to the border area.   Red Guards
 and insurrection corps fought in both battles, though they did not do too
 much. The status now in the border area is:   Chou Hun-yuan's 14th brigade
 and Liu Shih-i's 15th brigade are now stationed in the Kiangsi border, both
 of which have been defeated and are being reorganized; the 21st brigade
 under Li Wen-pin and the 35th brigade are crack troops; the 8th Army under
 Wu Shang is entrenched in the three counties of Cha-ling, Ling-hsien and
 Kuei-tung on the Hunan border.   The area of Red power extends from Sui-ch'uan
 and the southern foot of Ching-kang Mountains in the south to the borders
 of Lien-hua in the north, including the entire county of Ning-kang, parts of
 Sui-ch'uan, Ling-hsien and Yung-hsin, and forming a narrow strip from north
 to south.   The Shang-hsi District in Lien-hua, Tien-lung District in Yung-
 hsin, and the Wan-nien shan area are not contiguous, though they have also
 been occupied by Red power.   The enemy is attempting to surround this
 unbroken bastion by both military attack and economic blockade in order to
 wipe out this "Communist bandit lair."  A hard struggle is bound to be waged
 with the passage of time, and they will never give us any respite.
 (4)   Current Problems
 A.   Military Question
 (1)   The Military Stage:   Since the struggle in the border area has become
 exclusively military, both the party and the masses must be militarized.
 How to deal with the enemy and how to fight have thus become important items
 on the daily agenda of the army and local party organs at all levels.   The
 so-called independent regime must be armed; that is, where there is no armed
 force, or an inadequately armed one, or though armed, the tactics are wrong,
 then it will be, instead, captured by the White armed forces immediately
 (White army, peace preservation corps and levies).   This kind of struggle
 is bound to become more violent every day, and so the problems will also
 become more complex and aggravated.
 (2)   The Sources of the Red Army:  They may be divided into the following
 six categories:   (a) units formerly under Yeh T'ing and Ho Lung at Swatow;
 (b) the Guards Regiment at Wuchang; (c) peasant armies of Liu-yang and
 P'ing-chiang;  (d) peasant armies of southern Hunan and the workers of
 Shui-k'ou-shan;  (e) soldiers captured from the units under Hsu K'o-hsiang
 [6070 0344 4382], Tang Sheng-chih, Pai Chung-hsi, Chu P'ei-teh,
 Wu Shang and Hsiung Shih-hui; and (f) worker and peasant elements from the
 various border counties.   The first four types are the main force.  However,
 after more than a year of fighting, the old units of Yeh and Ho the Guards
 Regiment, and the peasant troops of Liu-yang and P'ing-chian have lost
 two-thirds of their strength, leaving only one-third intact.   Even the
 Red Army of southern Hunan has.also suffered terrific losses after 8 months
 of fighting.   Thus, the first four categories, because of their excellent
 quality, have remained the basic strength of the 4th Red Army, but are
 outnumbered by the last two categories.   Of the last two categories,
 -   Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 captured soldiers form the majority.  Without this replenishment: it would
 have been impossible to fill up the 4th Army.  Moreover, its quality has also
 suffered considerably.  The increase in men has not kept up with the increase
 in rifles. Rifles are not easily lost, but soldiers are wounded, killed,
 fall sick or desert (during a defeat).  Among peasants in the border area,
 very few were willing to enlist.  With the distribution of land, most of
 them have gone out to plant the fields.  At present, the number of worker
 and peasant elements is extremely small in the 4th Army in the border area.
 Thus, the problem is still rather serious.  The Hunan Provincial Committee
 has promised to send us workers from An-yuan and we hope this will be done
 soon.
 (3)  Composition:  One portion consists of worker and peasant elements while
 the other is formed largely of the vagabond proletariat (the Hunan Provincial
 Committee has alleged that they are all vagabond proletariat, but this is
 not true).  This vagabond proletariat portion must be replaced by worker
 and peasant elements., though it is difficult to find them.  The vagabond
 proletariat elements seem to be excellent in combat and, as the.war goes on
 every day casualties have been heavy.  Thus, the vagabond proletariat are
 indispensable, but it is not easy to find replacements from among them.
 Under these circumstances, we must intensify political training in order to
 improve their quality.
 (4)   Character:  The majority has been converted from mercenary forces but
 the mercenary system is abolished as soon as they join the Red Army.  There
 has never been any pay, but there there is rice money and petty cash for
 miscellaneous expenses.   In regard to land distribution among the Red Army
 officers and men, with the exception of those soldiers in various counties
 in the border areas whose families.are given land as a rule, it is rather
 difficult for officers and men from remote places to obtain land.  This is
 because, first, there is very little land in the occupied area which is
 mountainous.  Moreover, peasants have complained that the land distributed
 to them is insufficient, and so there is no surplus land.  Secondly, because
 of the constant changes in the fortunes of war, the occupied area is very
 unstable.   The land distributed by Red power yesterday could be easily
 taken away by White power today, in which case one must pay rent to the
 landlord.   Thus, it is not only the officers and men in the Red Army who are
 wary toward the concept of land distribution; even among the peasants, many
 are aware of the uncertainties of the situation.   This is due to the fact
 that the White power is too strong, and the struggle between White and Red
 has been too recurrent and too severe.  Nonetheless, that the Red Army
 officers and men should receive land is an irrevocable principle, though
 the methods of implementation remain to be discussed.
 (5)  Political Training:  The Red Army soldiers have learned class conscious-
 ness and such essentials as distribution of land, the establishment of soviets,
 the arming of workers and peasants, etc.   They realize that they are fighting
 for themselves and the workers and peasants.   Because of this, they have not
 complained even though they have had to endure hardships in the midst of this
 bitter struggle.   There is a soldiers' committee at the company, battalion
 and regimental levels whose duties are to supervise the officers, represent

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 the interests of soldiers, participate in army administration, undertake
 political training internally (in the army) and launch mass movements.ex-
 ternally.                         With a sound soldiers' committee, it may not be necessary to have
 a political department.  The working personnel can be incorporated into the
 soldiers' committee, which is better than maintaining a political department
 separately.  Before April this year, there was a political department in all
 army units here, but it has been abolished because the results have not been
 too satisfactory.  With the political. department, there was a feeling on the
 part of the officers, soldiers and masses that political work could be done
 by a few people of that department, and so they deemed that the duty of the
 remaining people was limited to fighting.  But after its abolition, everybody
 realized that they not only have to fight, but also must undertake political
 work (political training and'mass movement).  This has resulted in breaking
 the simple military-minded tradition.  Based on past experience, it has been
 held that the party representative system should not be abolished.  Party
 representatives at the army and divisional levels, however, could be abolished
 (there being no divisional level here, while the regiment is directly under
 the army).  Party representatives cannot be abolished at the regiment,
 battalion and company level, particularly at the company level at this time.
 This is because the party branch is built upon the company.  The party
 representative of a company has the duty of supervising the soldiers' commit-
 tee to carry out political training and to direct mass movements, and he is
 also the branch secretary in the party.   As it has been borne out by facts,
 where the company's party representative is better, that company will also
 be better.   Among the lower echelon cadres, it often happens that because of
 the heavy casualties, some of the enemy soldiers captured only yesterday
 would be promoted to serve as platoon or even company leaders today.  Among
 those enemy soldiers that were captured in February and March this year, some
 have become battalion commanders.   It seems rather absurd to think that
 just because ours is now called the Red Army, there is no need to have party
 representatives.  When Chu Teh's units were in southern Hunan, the system
 of party representatives was abolished.   Later, he felt that it was not too
 good, and so when he came to the border area, the system was restored.  If
 the name is changed to "director," this would be confused with the directors
 of the Kuomintang, whom most of the captured soldiers detest.  Moreover,
 any change of name will not change the nature of the system.  Hence, it has
 been decided that there should be no change.  There have been too many
 casualties among party representatives.  It is hoped that apart from conduct-
 ing training classes, the Central Committee and the two provincial committees
 will send us at least 30 persons who could serve as party representatives.
 (6)  Military Training:   It usually takes other people from 6 months to
 1 year to train their soldiers before they can fight:   our soldiers might have
 entered the army yesterday, and required to fight today with no time for
 training at all.  Consequently, among some middle and lower echelon cadres
 and many soldiers, the military technique is rather poor.   Their only
 advantage in combat is courage, and this is very dangerous.   Since it is
 impossible to have long periods of rest and training, the only thing is to
 try to avoid fighting in order to gain the necessary time for training.  We
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 have established a training corps of 150 members and we intend to continue
 this practice.  We hope that the Central Committee and the two provincial
 committees will send us at least 30 more officers at the company and platoon
 level, to the border areas as soon as possible.
 (7)   The Problem of Supplies;  The Hunan Provincial Committee has asked us
 to pay attention to the material life of the soldiers to make it at least
 a little better than the average worker and peasant.  At present, however,
 army life is just contrary to that, and we feel that no one else lives so
 badly as the Red Army soldiers.   Because of the shortage of silver dollars,
 we have found it difficult to continue to give each person 5 fen for their
 food (rice is supplied locally) each day.   The soldiers' adage that "down
 with the capitalists, as we can eat pumpkin every day" is an indication of
 their distress,.  They can endure hardships; no others can endure hardships
 better than the 4th Army.  They need only money for food--all other expenses
 have been curtailed, and even this requires some 10,000 silver dollars a
 month.   They can get this money only by making the local despots pay.   But
 first, wherever they have been, there are no more local despots from whom
 to collect it; second, as the siege of the enemy is so tight, unless one
 side of it has collapsed, it would be impossible to venture out too far to
 strike at the local despots; and third, the enemy threat being so serious,
 it is impossible for one or two battalions of soldiers to go out to look
 for funds, and if you want to get more, you have to have more soldiers.  This
 is no simple problem.  Now, although we have the cotton for winter clothing
 for the 5,000 soldiers of the entire army (regular Red Army), we are still
 short of cloth, and do not know when this can be solved.  It is already so
 cold now, but. many soldiers are still wearing two layers of thin clothing.
 Fortunately, they are used to hardships, and they are equally poor regard-
 less of who they are.                From the.army commander down to the cook, each person
 gets 2 fen uniformly for their food.  When the expense money is 20 fen each,
 they would all get the same amount, and when it is 40 fen, they would all
 get 40 fen each.   Because they all understand this is "suffering hardships
 for the proletariat," they do not complain.  Although this is so, the economic
 problem remains rather serious.
 (8)  The Problem of Wounded and Sick Soldiers:  After each engagement, there
 are some wounded soldiers.  Because of the lack of nutrition, the cold, and
 other causes, there are many sick.  The Red Army's hospitals are built in
 the Ching-kang Mountains.  They treat patients with both Chinese and Western
 medicine, but both drugs and doctors are in short supply and the problem
 is grave.  In September there were more than 200 wounded and sick soldiers,
 and this number has increased since the recent battle at Yung-hsin.   There
 are now more than 800 patients in the hospitals, including some nursing
 staff.  Morale will be affected if the wounded are not given proper care.
 But to do this requires adequate equipment and supplies which are unsatis-
 factory and difficult to obtain.   The Hunan Provincial Committee has promised
 to send some medicines, but no delivery has been made so far.  We hope that
 the Central Committee and the two provincial committees will loan us a few
 doctors [trained in] Western medicine and some iodine.

 (9)   Democracy in the Army;  Although the material life of the Red Army is
 poor and although there have been incessant engagements, it has managed to
 maintain its morale.   Apart from the role played by the party, this is due
 largely to the thorough implementation of democracy.   The officers do not
 abuse their soldiers; officers and men receive equal treatment:   they eat
 the same food and dress alike.   The soldiers enjoy freedom of speech and
 assembly.  All formalities and protocol have been abolished and economic
 management is open; the representatives of the soldiers can look into the
 budget and accounts.  They also manage their own mess, and though each person
 gets about only 5 fen for their mess, they could still put aside 60 or 70
 coppers a day for personal expenses.   These measures have proved to be most
 satisfying to the soldiers.  This is especially true for the newly captured
 soldiers who realize how different their new army life is from their old
 army life,'so much so that they seem to be two different worlds.   Although
 they may feel that the material life of the Red Army is not as good as
 that of the White, their spirit is liberated and they get along well.   Al-
 though they are the same soldiers, they did not fight so bravely for the
 enemy as they do now for the Red Army, and this is due to the influence of
 democracy.   The Red Army is like a melting pot in which captured soldiers
 can be melted as soon as they. come over.  This is a fact.  In China, there
 is great need for democracy not only among the worker and peasant masses,
 but also for the army, and even more urgently.  To practice democracy
 thoroughly in the army constitutes an important policy to destroy China's
 feudalistic mercenary armies.  This is because the life of soldiers in
 China's feudal mercenary army is simply intolerable.
 (10)   Party Organization in the Army:  There are now four levels in the party
 organization of the army:   the company branch, battalion committee, regi-
 mental committee and army committee.   The party branch is established in
 each company; and a small group is established in each squad.  An important
 reason why the 4th Army has remained intact after so many battles is due to
 the fact that "the party branch is organized on the company basis."  Two
 years ago, our party organization in the Kuomintang army failed to grasp
 the soldiers, and even in Yeh T'ing's units, there was only a party branch
 in each regiment, which was most absurd.  Now, the ratio between party
 members and nonpartisans in the army is one to three, which means there
 is a party member in every four persons.  Recently, we decided to develop
 more party members among the combat soldiers so that the number of party
 members and nonpartisans will attain a fifty-fifty ratio.   There is now a
 shortage of good secretaries in the company branches.   Therefore, we are
 asking the Central Committee to send more active elements who find it
 difficult to stay in their respective localities to come here to serve as
 company party representatives.   Among the working staff who came from
 southern Hunan, almost all of them are doing party work in the army (and
 they do political work simultaneously).   In August we lost some of them in
 southern Hunan, and so it is even more difficult now to spare them.   Since
 the Army committee (Army party committee) was elected by the first army

 14-15 November.   This conference was held after receipt of a letter from the
 Central Committee.  Thus, decisions have been adopted on political, military,
 organization and propaganda affairs, and it was a better conference than all
 previous ones. The conference elected an army committee of 23 members, with
 Chu Teh as secretary (designated by the Central Committee).   It is the highest
 party organ in the army and is under the jurisdiction of the Front Committee.
 Externally, this is the military council of the border area soviet, commanding
 the Red Army and local militia forces.   The party organization in the army
 has been set up with considerable success, and some party members are very
 determined in their revolutionary outlook, though the majority of them to not
 have a good education.  We must pay more attention to this later.
 (11)   Local Armed Forces:  The local forces consist of the Red Guards and the
 worker and peasant insurrection corps.   The insurrection corps is armed with
 spears and shotguns.   It is based on the village as the unit, each village
 having one detachment, whose strength is based on the size of the village.
 Its duty is to suppress counterrevolutionaries and to protect the village
 regime.  When the enemy comes, the insurrection corps will help the Red Army
 or the Red Guards in combat duties.   A secret organization used to launch
 uprisings, the insurrection corps was founded in Yung-hsin.  Later, it seized
 the political power of the entire county, thus becoming an open, organization.
 This system has since been extended in the border areas, and retains its
 original name.   The arms of the Red Guards corps consist of five-, nine-
 and single-shot rifles, with five-shot ones in the majority.   The numbers of
 rifles in the various counties are as follows:   140 in Ning-kang, 220 in
 Yung-hsin, 43 in Lien-hua, 50 in Ch'a-ling, 90 in Ling-hsien, 130 in
 Sui-ch'uan and 10 in Wan-an, for a total of 683.  Most of these have been
 supplied by the Red Army, while a small portion has been captured from the
 enemy.  Most of the Red Guards units have been fighting constantly with the
 peace preservation corps and the levies of the big gentry in the-various
 counties and as a result their ability to handle weapons and their fighting
 capability have increased steadily.   Before the Ma-jih.(21 May) incident,
 the number of rifles held by the peasant self-defense corps in the various
 border counties was as follows:  300 in Yu-hsien, 300 in Ch'a-ling,
 60 in Ling-hsien, 50 in Sui-ch'uan, 80, in Yung-hsin, 60 in Lien-hua,
 60 in Ning-kang (Yuan Wen-ts'ai's units) and 60 in the Ching-kang Mountains
 (Wang Tso's units), totaling 970.   After that incident, with the exception
 of the Yuan and Wang units, which remained intact, only 6 rifles were left
 in Sui-ch'uan, 1 in Lien-hua, all the remaining rifles having been seized
 by the big landlords.   As a result of the opportunist line, they were unable
 to hold on to their rifles.  Now, the Red Guards units in the various
 counties are still short of rifles, and the big landlords possess far more
 rifles than the Red Guards.  This is why the Red Army must continue to supply
 rifles to the various counties, and where it will not impair the Red Army,
 everything must be done to help arm the local militia forces so that, they
 can be strengthened steadily.  The Red Army conference has stipulated that
 the four-company system be adopted, with 75 rifles in each company (when
 this number is added to the rifles of the special services company,
 machine--gun company, mortar company and the battalion and regimental
 headquarters, each regiment should have 1,075 rifles).  Moreover, weapons

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 captured from the enemy should have been distributed as much as possible to
 the local militia forces of workers and peasants.  The officers of the Red
 Guards corps should be trained at the training corps maintained by the Red
 Army.  Hereafter, the number of officers commanding Red Guards who have been
 sent by the Red Army must be curbed gradually.  In the meantime, Chu P'ie-teh
 has also been massively arming the peace preservation corps and the levies,
 and the number and combat strength of the armed forces equipped by 'the big
 gentry in the border counties are also formidable.  Thus, expansion of the
 Red local militia forces in the border area cannot be delayed any further.
 (12)   The Strategy of Red Army and Red Guards:. In addition to recognizing
 guiding principles (that where the enemy is small in number, it should be
 eliminated immediately by superior force, and where the enemy is numerous
 and strong, mass war strategy should be adopted instead of fighting a hard
 battle), the Red Army should concentrate its strength while the Red Guards
 should disperse its strength.  Now, the bourgeois regime is comparatively
 stable, the enemy is in a position to deploy an enormous number of troops
 against the Red Army.   Thus, it would be most inimical for the Red Army
 to disperse its strength.  In our experience, we have almost always suffered
 defeat when our strength was spread thin.   But we have invariably won when
 we have concentrated our forces to attack enemy forces that were smaller
 than ours, equal to ours, or slightly larger than ours.  The area of
 guerrilla warfare as prescribed by the directives of the Central Committee
 covers thousands of li in length and breadth.  This is too extensive and was
 due probably to the over-estimation of our military strength.   (Since the
 number of rifles in the 4th Red Army is known to the Hunan Provincial
 Committee, we have asked Comrade Yuan Teh-sheng to make a report orally,
 and so it is not listed here.)   In regard to the strategy of the Red Guards
 corps, it would be better to disperse their strength.  This method is being
 adopted by Red Guards in the various counties.
 (13)  Military Organization:  We are still following the old Kuomintang method
 of organization.  We are unable to decode the Central Committee's "Resolution
 on Military Work."  Also we cannot surmise what was the military system of
 the T'ai-p'ing regime.  Please send these documents again so that we may
 discuss them.
 (14)  Propaganda Aimed at the Enemy:  The most effective propaganda is to
 release captured soldiers and to give medical treatment to wounded enemy
 soldiers.  When enemy soldiers and enemy battalion company and platoon
 commanders are captured, they are, after some propaganda work on our part,
 C    divided into those who want to stay and those who wish to go.  We should
 allow those who want to leave to get their wish and give them the necessary
 traveling expenses.   This kind of propaganda will shatter the enemy
 allegation that "Communist bandits kill anyone in sight."  As a result of
 this policy, the "Ten-day Bulletin of the 9th Division" issued by Yang
 Chi'ih-sheng said that our method is "sinister."  The officers and men of
 the Red Army are most enthusiastic in welcoming and comforting captured
 enemy soldiers.   At each "rally to bid farewell to new brothers," the
 captured soldiers responded with warm gratitude in their speeches.  Medical

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 treatment for the wounded enemy soldiers also has a great effect.  Some clever
 enemy (such as Li Wen-pin) have imitated our method by not killing our cap-
 tured soldiers and by treating our wounded soldiers.  However, after our
 men have been captured by the enemy, they often bring their rifles back with
 them at the next engagement.  Such incidents have occurred twice.  Very few
 Red Army soldiers have been captured by the enemy in the border area.  This
 is because the Red Army has rarely lost any battle there.  Additionally, we
 have also done much in written propaganda, such as slogan-writing.  Whenever
 we reach a new place, we cover the walls with our slogans. We are, however,
 short of persons who have drawing skills and so we hope the Central Committee
 and the two provincial committees will send us some.
 (15)  Military Strongholds:  The first stronghold is the Ching-kang Mountains
 located at the juncture of the four counties of Ning-kang, Lin-hsien,
 Sui-ch'uan and Yung-hsin.  Its northern foot is Mao-p'ing, in Ning-kang,
 and its southern foot is Huang-pa in Sui-ch'uan, a distance of 90 li between
 them.   Its eastern foot is Na-shan in Yung-hsin and its western foot is
 Shui-k'ou in Ling-hsien, 180 li apart.   It has an area of 550 square li,
 extending from Na-shan and Lung-yuan-k'ou (in Yung-hsin) to Hsin-ch'eng,
 Mao-p'ing and Ta-lung (in Ning-kang), to Shih-tu, Shui-k'ou and-Hsia-ts'en
 (in Ling-hsien), and then to Ying-pan-yu, Tai-chia-pu, Ta-feng, Tui-tzu-ch'ien,
 Huang-ao, Wu-tu-chiang, and Ch'e-ao (in Sui-ch'uan).   In the mountains are
 located such places as Ta-ching, Hsiao-ching, Shang-ching, Chung-ching,
 Hsia-ching, Tzu-p'ing, Hsia-chuang, Hsing-chou, Ta'ao-p'ing, Pai-ni-hu and
 Lo-fu where paddy fields and villages are scattered.   These places have
 been historically the lairs for bandits and stragglers.  The population is
 less than 2,000, and the grain crop is under 10,000 piculs and so all the
 grain for the army must be supplied from Ning-kang, Yung-hsin and Sui-ch'uan
 counties.   All strategic passes in the mountains are defended by heavy
 fortifications.   Located in the mountains are the Red Army hospitals, clothing
 shops, arsenal and the rear offices of the various regiments.   Foodstuffs
 are now being hauled to the mountain bastions from Ning-kang, and if we can
 get sufficient supplies (grain and cash, the most important being cash),
 it will be impregnable.  There is a defense committee in charge of local
 defense, with Wang Tso as its director.   The second stronghold is Chiu-lung,
 located at the juncture of the four counties of Ning-kang, Yung-hsin,
 Lien-hua and Ch'a-ling.  This base is not as important as the Ching-kang
 Mountains, but is fortified and serves as the rearmost base for the local
 militia forces of the four counties.   Surrounded by White regimes on all
 sides, a military bastion with strong natural barriers is indispensable for
 the existence of the Red regime.   Because of the fact that it is surrounded
 by the enemy, it is necessary to defend every side, and so natural barriers
 are important in reinforcing the inadequacy of human resources.  However,
 when the bourgeois political power is stable, protracted Red occupation
 will be difficult.
 (B)   Agrarian Problem
 (1)   Agrarian Status in Border Area:  Generally speaking, over 60 percent
 of the land is controlled by landlords, and less than 40 percent is in the
 hands of peasants.   Individually speaking, land ownership is most concen-
 trated in Sui-ch'uan in the Kiangsi border, where 80 percent is owned by
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 landlords, Yung-hsin comes next, with 70 percent owned by landlords.  In
 Wan-an, Ning-kang and Lien-hua there are more rich peasants.  With the
 exception of Wan-an where no direct investigation has been made, although
 we say that there are many  rich  peasants in Ning-kang and Lien-hua, land-
 lords still own more land there--the ratio being 60 : 40.  In Ch'a-ling
 and Ling-hsien on the Hunan border, conditions are similar, as some 70 per-
 cent of land is owned by landlords.
 (2)   The Problem of the Intermediate Class:  Under these circumstances, it
 would seem that confiscation of all lands and redistribution of them would
 be supported by the majority.  However, there are roughly three classes
 in rural areas, namely, the big gentry consisting of big and medium-sized
 landlords, the intermediate class of small landlords and rich peasants, and
 the poor peasants.   In the intermediate class, the rich peasants often align
 themselves with the interests of the small landlords.  Although the land
 owned by the rich. peasants is a small percentage of the total, if combined
 with the land.owned by the small landlords, the amount is sizeable.   This
 situation seems to be prevalent throughout the country.   The policy in the
 border areas has been to confiscate all the land and then to distribute it
 thoroughly.  Thus, both the big gentry and the intermediate class have been
 attacked in the areas of Red power.  Although this is the policy, it has been
 hampered by the intermediate class during its implementation.   In the early
 days of the revolution, the intermediate class capitulated to the poor
 peasants superficially, but in reality conspired to use their former social
 status and their clannishness to spread rumors intimidating the poor peasants,
 thus delaying the distribution of land.  When they were-pressured to such an
 extent that no further delay was possible, they either concealed the actual
 extent of their land, or kept'the rich land for themselves and reported the
 poor land to the authorities.   During that period, because of the protracted
 persecution and the uncertainty of revolutionary victory, the poor peasants
 were deceived by the intermediate class and did not dare to take positive
 action.   It is only when the revolution has become resurgent and seized
 political power in one or several counties, when the reactionary army has
 been defeated repeatedly, and when the prowess of the Red Army has been
 demonstrated effectively that positive action has been taken in rural villages
 against the intermediate class.   For instance, the southern section of
 Yung-hsin has the largest intermediate class.   It has also been most stubborn
 in delaying redistribution of land and in concealing landholdings.   But
 it was only after the Red Army won a huge victory at Lung-yuan-k'ou on
 23 June, and the district executed several people who tried to postpone
 land redistribution, that land was actually redistributed.  Nonetheless,
 in almost any county, the feudal system of family organization is prevalent;
 usually one single family dominates one village or even several villages.
 The result is that it could take ?a long time before class splitting in
 the village is realized and the clan sentiment overcome.   In rural villages
 dominated by family organizations, it is not the big gentry but the inter-
 mediate class that creates the biggest problem.
 (3)  Defection of the Intermediate Class Under the White Terror:  As the
 intermediate class had been under attack during the revolutionary upsurge,
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 it immediately defected as soon as the White terror came.   The small land-
 lords and rich peasants of Ning.kang and Yung-hsin led the reactionary
 troops in burning down the houses of the revolutionary peasants there.
 Pursuant to the directions of the reactionaries, they proved to be most
 courageous in burning houses and arresting people.  When the Red Army
 again reached Ning-kang (in September), several thousand peasants of
 Hsin-ch'eng, Ku-ch'eng and Lung-shih, persuaded by the propaganda of the
 reactionaries that "the Communists would kill them," followed the reaction-
 aries to Yung-hsin.   It was only after we proselytized to them that "peasants
 who had defected would be killed" and that we "welcome peasants who had
 defected back to reap grain" that many peasants slowly returned.
 (4)  When the revolution is at a low ebb in the nation, the most difficult
 problem in the occupied areas is that the intermediate class cannot firmly
 be held.   The main reason for the betrayal by this class is that it has been
 dealt heavy blows by the revolution.  However, if the poor peasants are
 undaunted during the revolutionary upsurge, the intermediate class might be
 scared and not dare to run amok.  When the war between Li Tsung-jen and
 Tang Sheng-chih spread to Hunan, the small landlords in Ch'a-ling
 tried to make peace with the peasants, some of them even sent pork to
 peasants as a New Years gift (At that time, the Red Army evacuated Ch'a-ling
 to go to Sui-ch'uan). .After the conclusion of the Li-T'ang [action], such
 incidents have also disappeared.  Now that the counterrevolution has reached
 its high tide in the whole country, the intermediate class that has been
 under attack has become completely subservient to the big gentry in the White
 areas, and the poor peasants have become an isolated force.   This is a rather
 serious problem.
 (5)   The pressure of daily life as an influence on the intermediate class to
 defect:   Red occupation and White resistance have created two enemy states.
 Because of the enemy's stringent blockade and because of. our mishandling
 of the petty bourgeoisie, trade has been completely stopped between the
 two areas.   The shortage and the high prices of salt, cloth and medicine
 as well as other daily necessities, and the difficulty of exporting such
 items as timber, tea and oil have affected the people in general.  It has
 also curbed their income.  Although the poor peasants can endure hardship
 the intermediate class cannot and will go over to the gentry when conditions
 become intolerable.   This economic problem is most serious.   Thus, unless
 the splits and wars between the big gentry and the warlords of China
 continues, and unless the national situation moves forward, the small inde-
 pendent Red regimes will be gravely threatened economically, and the protracted
 existence of the regimes will become a problem.   This is because such economic
 pressure is not only intolerable to the middle class, but also unendurable
 to the worker and peasant classes as well as to the Red Army.   Both
 Yung-hsin and Ning-kang have no salt to eat, and the supply of cloth and
 medicine, not to mention other things, has been completely disrupted.   Salt
 is now sold, but at an exorbitant price, and there are still no cloth and
 medicine.   In Ning-kang and the western part of Yung-hsin as well as the
 northern part of Sui-ch'uan (which are still occupied areas at present), it
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 is still impossible to export timber, tea and oil which form their staple
 products. There is an acute shortage of money, and if captured local despots
 refuse to deliver money, there is no money to spend.  That is why the problem
 is very grave.
 (6)   The Standard for Land Redistribution:  The township serves as the unit
 for redistribution.  Where it is mountainous and there is very little farm-
 land, such as the Hsiao-chiang District in Yung-hsin, three or four townships
 form a single unit for redistribution, though such cases are very rare.   In
 regard to human standards, then land is redistributed equally among all
 persons regardless of age and sex.  Now, however, in keeping with the new
 measures prescribed by the Central Committee, the labor force is used as the
 standard; those who can work receive twice as much as land as those who cannot.
 (7)   The Question of Concessions to the Owner-peasants:  This problem has
 not yet been discussed in depth.   The rich owner-peasants have suggested that
 the standard of redistribution be based on productivity, that is, those who
 have more labor and capital (farm implements, etc.) should be given more land.
 The rich peasants feel that neither equal distribution nor distribution
 according to the labor force are to their advantage.   They indicate that they
 are willing to work harder which, coupled with their capital, would enable
 them to raise more crops.   If they are given land on an equal basis, it would
 be tantamount to ignoring (and negating) their special efforts as well as
 their surplus capital, and so they are unwilling.   The measures prescribed
 by the Central Committee have been carried out here accordingly, but the
 problem must be discussed further, and a report will be made as soon as
 conclusions are drawn.   On the other hand, we request the Central Committee
 and the two provincial committees to inform us as soon as possible the measures
 adopted by Soviet Russia to treat its kulaks (rich peasants), and especially
 what measures had been adopted by the Soviet Government within the White
 regime during the time of its democratic revolution.  As to the question of
 not confiscating the land of rich-peasants, where the land has been completely
 confiscated in the occupied border areas, it of course will not arise again.
 However, as the area is expanded, the policy of nonconfiscation will be
 applied during initial stages in order to enable the rich-peasants to strike
 against the big gentry and to help the poor peasants.
 (8)  Land Tax:   In Ning-kang, the tax is 20 percent, which is about 5 percent
 higher than that prescribed by the Central Committee.   Since collection is
 now under way, it cannot be changed, but could be reduced next year.   In
 Sui-ch'uan, Ling-hsien and Yung-hsin, the terrain is mountainous and the
 peasants are so poor that it is inadvisable to collect tax from them.   The
 funds for the government and the Red Guards must be obtained from the local
 despots in the White areas.  The rice for the sustenance of the Red Army can
 be obtained for the time being from the land tax in Ning-kang, while cash
 has also been obtained from squeezing the local despots.  As a result of
 guerrilla operations in Sui-ch'uan in October, some 10,000 yuan have been
 collected which may last for some time, and we will try to look to some other
 means after this money is gone.

 (C)   The Question of Soviets
 (1)   Soviets of County, District and Township Levels:   Soviets on all levels
 have been organized in the border area, but more in name than in reality.
 Among the worker and peasant masses, and even among party members, the
 meaning of "soviet" is not widely understood.   In many places, they do not
 have the so-called workers, peasants and soldiers representatives conference.
 The executive committee of the soviet at the district and township levels,
 and even at the county level, is usually elected at a mass rally.  It can
 neither discuss problems, nor give political training, though it can be
 easily manipulated by intellectuals and opportunists.  This is due to the
 fact that they do not understand what constitutes a soviet, that the repre-
 sentatives of workers, peasants and soldiers form the highest permanent
 organ of political power, while the executive committee is merely an adminis-
 trative organ during the recess of the representatives' conference.   This is
 the biggest mistake of many localities in the border areas regarding the
 organ of political power.   In some places there are representatives con-
 ferences, though they also merely regard the conference as an ad hoc elected
 organ vis-a-vis the executive committee.   After the election, the power is
 controlled by the executive committee, and the conference will not even be
 mentioned.  This does not mean that there are no bona fide soviet organiza-
 tions, though the number is extremely small.  This is due to the woeful lack
 of propaganda and education on this new political system of soviets.  The
 evil habits of dictatorship and dogmatism during the feudal era have become
 steeped in the minds of the masses and even party members.   They still cannot
 eradicate these habits.  They are prone to follow the easy course, and dislike
 the complex democratic system.   In order that democratic centralism may be
 applied to mass organizations, its efficacy must be demonstrated in the
 revolutionary struggle.  This will enable the masses to understand that this
 kind of organizational method is most conducive to mobilizing the strength
 of the masses, and most beneficial to struggle.   Only after they have
 gained this understanding will it be universally and truly established.  We
 are now enacting detailed organic laws for soviets at all levels (based on
 the outlines of the Central Committee) in order to correct some of the
 previous mistakes.   The soldiers soviet (soldiers' representatives conference
 on all levels) in the Red Army is also being established regularly.  This
 would also rectify the mistake of having only soldiers' committees but no
 regular soldiers' conferences.
 (2)   The Executive Committee on All Levels:  The masses now generally under-
 stand the "soviet government of workers, peasants and soldiers" at all
 levels, to be the "ai government," so dubbed by the masses of Ning-kang
 ("ai" meaning "us" in the local dialect, and so this means "our government"),
 or the "su government" dubbed elsewhere, both referring to the committee.
 This is because they have not understood the powers of the representatives
 conference, thinking the committee is the only authority.   This kind of
 executive committee does not have the backing of a sound representatives
 conference and is apt to deviate from the views of the masses when decisions
 are made.   This is often  manifested by its wavering and compromise in the
 149

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 redistribution of land, its recklessness and corruption in economic affairs,
 its fear of the White Terror, and its lack of resoluteness in the struggle.
 Very few plenary meetings are held, and there are also very few standing
 committee meetings-on the district and township government level.  Matters
 are decided by the chairman, secretary, treasurer or Red Guards commander
 (or insurrectionary leader).   As a result, the practice of democratic
 centralism even among government members has not become uniform.
 (3)   The government committee is dominated by the bourgeoisie.   During the
 early stage, especially in government committees on the township level,
 small landlords, rich peasants and intellectuals vied with each other in
 seeking power.   They pretended to be enthusiastic, wearing red ribbons, and
 wormed their way by deceit into the government committee to play dominant
 roles, while poor peasant members were relegated to secondary roles.   It
 was only after they were unmasked during the course of struggles and the
 peasants rose up that it became possible to get rid of them.  Although this
 state of affairs has not been universal, it has occurred in many places.
 (4)   The Relation Between the Party and Organs of Political Power:  Although
 there is no such thing as the party issuing orders to the government organs,
 this does not mean that the government is independent.   The party still
 enjoys very great prestige among its members and the masses, while the
 prestige of the government is much less.   This is because the party, for the
 sake of convenience, has often handled matters directly, paying no regard
 to the government.   This kind of mistake has been recurrent in many places.
 In some government organs there are no party or corps organizations; in other
 places, they have not been used efficiently.   Hereafter, the party must be
 the master behind the scene; the party's policies and measures, with the
 exception of propaganda, must be carried out through mass organizations.
 We must avoid the Kuomintang's mistake of interfering with the government
 directly.
 (5)  The Supreme Soviet:  The shingle of the "Worker-Peasant-Soldier Soviet
 of the Hunan-Kiangsi Border Area" was hung out in May.  Nonetheless, it
 has been established hurriedly and is rather imperfect.   It is now decided
 to reorganize the border soviet government and its committee as the supreme
 organ of political power in the border areas.
 (C)  The Status of the Party in the Border Areas
 (1)  History of Struggle Against Opportunism:  About the time of the Ma-jih
 (21 May) incident, all party organizations in the counties in the border
 areas may be said to have been opportunistic.  For this reason, they did
 not wage a resolute struggle when the counterrevolution set in.  When the
 Red Army (the 1st Regiment of the 1st Division of the 1st Army of the Worker
 and Peasant Revolutionary Army) arrived in the border counties in October
 last year, there remained only a few party members in hiding, and the
 party organizations had been totally destroyed. The period from November
 to April this year was one of rebuilding the party and the period since May
 one of great expansion.  In the past year, the phenomenon of opportunism
 within the party has been found everywhere.   Some of the party members,
 lacking the will to fight, laid in ambush (by hiding themselves deep in
 the mountains when the enemy came); others were more active, but they

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 became idealisticadventurists as a result of their bourgeois mentality,  This
 situation diminished after an extended period of training and struggle with-
 in the party.  In the meantime, even in the Red Army, this kind of petty-
 bourgeois restiveness has also lasted a considerable length of time.  When
 the enemy came, they would put up a fight, or they would take flight. This
 kind of ambivalence was often found in the same person and on the same issue.
 This has been gradually rectified only after prolonged inner-party struggle
 and through lessons learned from actual events (for instance, from losses
 incurred in reckless battle and defeats suffered during flight).
 (2)   Localism:  The economy of the border area is not only an agrarian
 economy, it has remained in the age of the hand pestle (the wooden hand
 pestle is used in the mountains, while in the plains there are many stone
 mills).   The social organizational unit is the clan, consisting of-people
 with the same name.  The party organization in the villages consists usually
 of one clan of the same surname living close together, forming one branch.
 So the branch meeting is tantamount to a family meeting.  Under this cir-
 cumstance, it is of course very difficult to have a "fighting Bolshevik
 Party."   To say that the Communist Party does not have any national or
 provincial demarcations is, of course, also incomprehensible to them.
 They do not even understand that there are no county, district or township
 differences.   There is localism to a serious extent among the various counties,
 and is strong even in the different districts and townships in the same
 county.   Reasoning is only partially successful in overcoming localism and
 it takes White oppression--which is not localized--to gradually convince
 the people to abandon their localism for common interests and struggle
 (for instance, such as joint suppression by two provincial forces).
 Localism is declining considerably as a result of a series of objective lessons.
 (3)   The Question of Native Inhabitants and Outsiders:  There is another
 unique thing in the border area, namely, the rift between the native resi-
 dents and the outsiders who have settled down there.   There is a great rift
 between the native population and the immigrants from Kwangtung and Fukien
 who arrived several centuries ago.   Historically, there has been a deep
 enmity between them which has become almost a "national" struggle.   These
 outsiders comprise a few million people, from the Kwangtung border, to the
 borders of Hunan and Kiangsi, and even to southern Hupeh.   The outsiders,
 who live in the mountains, have been traditionally oppressed by the native
 residents on the plains and have never had any political power.   The outsiders
 have welcomed the national revolution in the last 2 years, thinking it was
 the prelude of better fortune for them.   But the revolution became a counter-
 revolution, and the outsiders have been repressed by the native population
 as before.  Within the border area, such as Ning-kang, Sui-ch'uan,
 Ling-hsien and Ch-a-ling, the problem of natives and outsiders is very
 serious, especially in Ning-kang.   Last year and the year before, the in-
 digenous revolutionaries and the outside settlers of Ning-kang joined forces
 under the leadership of the Communist Party to overthrow the rule of the
 native gentry, thereby seizing political control throughout the county.
 In June of last year, Chu P'ei-teh's government launched a counterrevolution,

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 and in September the local gentry led Chu's troops in an attack on Ning-kang
 which continues to the present,   In theory, this kind of rift should not
 extend to the exploited workers and peasants, much less to the party, but in
 point of fact, because this has been a historical relic, there is still a big
 gap between the.native inhabitants and the outside settlers.   For instance,
 following the border defeat in August, the native gentry led troops back
 to Ning-kang, announcing that the outside settlers would massacre the
 indigenous residents.   As a result, the native peasants began to change their
 allegiance by wearing white ribbons and acting as guides to the troops to
 search the mountains and burn down houses.  When the Red Army routed the
 White troops in October and November, the native peasants fled with the
 latter, while the outsider peasants confiscated their cattle and belongings.
 When this situation is reflected in the party, it often leads to meaningless
 controversy.   To deal with this situation, we must tell the masses that
 "peasants who have defected will not be killed" and that "they will be given
 land when they-return," thereby inducing them to desert the local gentry and
 to return home without fear (many of them have already returned).   In the
 meantime, the county soviet ordered the settler-peasants to return the con-
 fiscated cattle and belongings to their original owners, and posted notices
 that the native, peasants will be protected.  Efforts have also been made
 within the party to eliminate the causes of friction as well as to intensify
 education so that there will be greater unity.
 (4)   Defection of Opportunists:  During. the revolutionary upsurge in June,
 many opportunists wormed their way into the party, with the result that the
 number of party members in the border area grew to more than 10,000.
 Responsible persons in the party branches and in the district committees
 consisted largely of new members, so good inner-party education was im-
 possible.   As soon as the White terror arrived, the opportunists defected.
 They frequently helped the reactionaries to arrest our comrades.   Thus,
 most of the party organizations in the White area have collapsed.
 (5)   Party Purge and Establishment of Secret Organizations:  After September,
 a stringent purge has been enforced in the party, imposing strict limita-
 tions on the composition of membership.   In Yung-hsin and Ning-kang, all
 party organizations were dissolved and a new registration was implemented.
 Registration in Yung-hsin has already been completed, while registration
 in Ning-kang will be completed soon.   Though the number of party members
 has been diminished greatly, combat strength has been bolstered.  Whereas
 the party organization was open to the public before, thus losing any
 secrecy, since September, all organizational work has been undertaken
 secretly.   In the meantime, the party has been able to extend its influence
 into the White area, so that it can play an effective role there.  However,
 there is as yet no foundation in the towns.   This is due, first, to the
 fact that the enemy is stronger in the towns, and second, we have done too
 much damage to bourgeois interests in the towns, where business is slack
 and the handicraft industry disrupted.   As a result, we have no foothold
 in the towns.  We are now rectifying our former errors and are trying to
 set up our organizations in the towns, though the results are still small.

 (6)   The Guidance Organs on All Levels:  The branch executive has been renamed
 the branch committee; above the branch is the district committee? and above
 the district is the county committee.   Because of certain unique conditions,
 a special district committee is formed between the district committee and
 county committee, such as the Pei-hsiang special district committee and the
 southeastern special district committee in Yung-hsin.   There are five border
 area county committees, namely:  Ning-kang, Yung-hsin, Lien-hua, Sui-ch'uan
 and Ling-hsien.   There used to be a county. committee in Ch'a-ling, but
 because it was difficult for our work to expand there, a number of the organs
 set up last winter and this spring have been destroyed by the White forces.
 During the past half year, party work has been done only in the mountainous
 regions near Ning-kang and Yung-hsin, and so the county organization has been
 changed to a special district committee.   To carry out our work in Yu-hsien
 and An-yuan, it is necessary to pass through Ch'a-ling.  We tried to send
 some people there, but it was abortive.   In January the Wan-an county
 committee held a joint meeting with the Front Committee in Sui-ch'uan but
 since then, it has been cut off by White forces for more than 6 months.  We
 did not resume contact with Wan-an until September, when the Red Army con-
 ducted guerrilla operations there.  According to a letter from the Wan-an
 county committee, there used to be nine district committees in Wan-an, but
 their 120 rifles have all been lost.  We still have our organization in the
 Police guards there, and our comrades have some rifles,   One battalion of
 the guerrilla units of the Red Army has reached the vicinity of Wan-an city,
 but our men there failed to come out to contact us.  Nonetheless, some
 80 revolutionary peasants followed us to the Ching-kang Mountains, and were
 organized as the Wan-an Red Guards, with 10 rifles.  An-fu has no party
 organization.   The Chi-an county committee has only contacted us twice,
 though it is a neighboring county of Yung-hsin.   They have not given us any
 help at all, which is rather strange.   In the Sha-t'ien district in Kuei-tung,
 land was redistributed in March and again in August. There, a party organi-
 zation was set up under the jurisdiction of the Southern Hunan special
 committee with its center at Shih-erh-tung in Lung-ch'i.   Above the various
 county committees is the Hunan-Kiangsi border area special committee.   On
 20 May the first border area congress was held at Mao-p'ing in Ning-kang.
 It elected 23 members of the first committee, with Mao Tse-tung as secretary.
 In July, the Hunan provincial committee sent Yang K'ai-ming over as acting
 secretary.  Yang became ill in September, and was replaced by T'an Chen-lin.
 When the main force of the Red Army went to southern Hunan in August and
 the border area came under heavy pressure from the White forces, an emergency
 conference was held in Yung-hsin.  When the Red Army returned to Ning-kang
 in October, the second congress was convened at Mao-p'ing.   Beginning on
 4 October, the congress met for 3 days.   It adopted resolutions on political
 problems, the tasks of the party in the border area, and propaganda, organi-
 zation and agrarian problems.   It elected 19 members of the second special
 committee (namely:  T'an Chen-lin, Chu Teh, Ch'en I, Lung Ch'ao-ch'ing,
 Chu Ch'ang-k'ai, Liu Tien-ch'ien, Yen P'an-chu; T'an Szu-ts'ung, T'an Ping,
 Li Chueh-fei, Sung I-yueh, Yuan Wen-ts'ai, Wang Tso-nung, Ch'en Cheng-jen,
 Mao Tse-tung, Wan Hsieh-hsien, Wang Tso, Yang K'ai-ming and Ho Ting-ying).
 Five of them were elected to the standing committee, with T'an Chen-lin
 (a worker) as secretary, and Chen Cheng-jen (an intellectual) as deputy
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 secretary.   On 14 November, the 6th plenary conference of the Red Army was
 held, electing an army committee of 23 members, with a standing committee of
 five members, with Chu Teh as secretary.  The special committee and the army
 committee are under the jurisdiction of the Front Committee.  On 6 November
 the Front Committee was organized which, pursuant to the directive of the
 Central Committee, comprised of five members, namely:  Mao Tse-tung, Chu Teh,
 the secretary of the local party committee (T'an Chen-lin), a worker comrade
 (Sung Ch'iao-sheng) and a peasant comrade (Mao Vo-wen), with Mao Tse-tung
 as secretary.   For the time being, the Front Committee has set up a secre-
 tariat, a propaganda section, an organization section, a trade union movement
 committee and a military affairs committee (which has been elected by the
 above-mentioned Red Army conference).   The Front Committee is placed in charge
 of the local party' organizations in the various counties.  Because the Front
 Committee sometimes must move with the army, it is still necessary to keep
 the Special Committee.
 The problem of proletarian ideological leadership in the party is extremely
 important.   The party organizations in the various border area counties,
 which can be said to be a party of peasants, will go astray unless they
 accept the leadership of the urban proletariat.   Besides rectifying the
 previous errors and paying close attention to the trade union movement in the
 various counties and towns, it is also necessary to increase workers' repre-
 sentation in the soviets.   It is extremely important for the workers, poor
 peasants and soldiers. of the party to participate in the local party organiza-
 tions and in the guidance organs of the party in the army.  We have concen-
 trated on this point for the past year, with the result that the number of
 workers and peasants has been increased in local party organs at all levels.
 Although in the Red Army, participation of soldiers in organs on all levels
 has been satisfactory such participation must be further increased, and
 attention must be paid to the quality of the participants so that they will
 be able to undertake "practical leadership," gradually eliminating bourgeois
 ideology completely.
 (D)  The Question of Revolutionary Character
 (1)  We completely subscribe to the Communist International's resolution on
 China:   China is still at the stage of bourgeois-democratic revolution.  The
 thorough completion of democratic revolution in China includes, externally,
 the overthrow of the imperialist special privileges in order to achieve
 national liberation and unification, and, internally, the elimination of
 the influences of'compradores in the cities, the eradication of feudal
 relations in the countryside, completion of the agrarian revolution, and the
 toppling of the warlord system which has served as another kind of political
 organization for the big gentry.   It is only by such a democratic revolution
 that it will be possible to lay a true foundation of a workers' regime and
 then advance to socialist revolution.   Based on our experiences of fighting
 in various places during the past year, we are keenly aware that the revolu-
 tionary tide has steadily declined.                         Although Red political power has been
 established in a few small areas, there are as yet no democratic rights in
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 the nation as a whole.   The workers, peasants and even the bourgeois demo
 crats have no right of speech or assembly, and the worst. crime is to join
 the Communist Party.   The Red Army has met with apathy everywhere it has
 gone; it is only after propaganda work has been done that the masses come
 out slowly.  The Red Army has to fight hard battles, there being few or no
 instances of enemy defection or mutiny.   This is also true with the 6th
 Army, which recruited the most "hooligans" following the Ma-jih (21 May)
 incident.   This is merely fighting for the sake of fighting, and this method
 will not be conducive to victory.  This is so because there a nationwide
 revolutionary upsurge is completely lacking.  Under the ruthless feudal
 rule of the big gentry, the broad strength of the oppressed classes has not
 yet been mobilized, and consequently we have had to fight desultorily.  We
 are keenly aware of our isolation and hope that it will end soon.  In order
 for the revolution to reach its upsurge throughout the country, it will be
 necessary to launch and consummate political and economic democratic revolu-
 tion which includes the bourgeoisie.  Thus, the resolution of the Comintern
 is most correct.
 (2)   Policy Toward Petty Bourgeoisie:  Up to February this year the work in
 the border area was done fairly well.   In March, Chou Lu, a representative
 of the Southern Hunan special committee, arrived at the border.   He said
 that we did not do enough killing and burning, and had failed to carry out
 the policy of "converting the petty bourgeoisie into the proletariat, and
 then forcing them into the revolution," as a result of which the policy has
 been changed.   After the entire Red Army reached the border area in April,
 although there was still not much killing and burning, rigorous measures
 were carried out to confiscate the property of urban middle merchants and
 to squeeze the rural small landlords.   The slogan of the Southern Hunan
 special committee of "All factories to the workers," has also been proselytized
 vigorously.   This policy of striking excessively at the petty bourgeoisie
 has resulted in driving the majority of them to the side of the big
 gentry.   They put on white ribbons to oppose us. Recently, this policy has
 been changed gradually, and conditions have improved somewhat.   Salutary
 effects have been achieved in Sui-ch'uan particularly where the small mer-
 chants in the county and townships no longer tried to avoid us, and some
 even said good things about the Red Army.   Some 20,000 people are drawn to.
 the market fairs in K'o-lin and Shang-feng (the fair is held every 3 days
 at noon) which is unprecedented.   This proves that our policy has changed.
 Previously, taxes were levied on all kinds of agricultural produce in
 transit, and heavy taxes were imposed by the pacification corps in Sui-ch'uan.
 From Huang-ao to Ts'ao-lin, a distance of only 70 li, there were five toll
 stations.  We abolished such exploitation by the feudal gentry and our
 action has been endorsed by the peasants and small merchants.
 (3)  Since the Central Committee has asked us to promulgate a policy platform
 that includes the interests of the petty bourgeoisie, we suggest that the
 Central Committee enact a democratic revolutionary program which encompasses
 the interests of the workers, agrarian revolution and national liberation,
 as well as a list of slogans for guidance in the border area.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 (4)  A unique characteristic of the Chinese revolution is that it is based
 on agriculture as its principal economy and uses armed forces to promote
 insurrections.  We suggest that the Central Committee exert great effort to
 develop the military movement.  This movement should be launched primarily
 in the enemy forces, with the development of the Red Army being secondary.
 (E)  The Question of the Area of the Independent Regime
 The area from the Kwangtung border to the Hunan-Kiangsi border, and even to
 southern Hupeh all belongs to the Lo-hsiao mountain range geographically.
 After traversing the entire Lo-hsiao mountain range, we have found out that,
 comparatively speaking, the mid-section of the range which centers on
 Ning-kang is most suitable for our occupation.  The terrain in the northern
 section is not as good as the middle section, which can be used for both
 offensive and defensive purposes.  Moreover, it is too close to some of the
 big political centers.  Unless plans are under way for the rapid seizure
 of Changsha or Wuhan, it would be rather dangerous to station large forces
 in such places as Liu-yang, Li-ling, P'ing-hsiang and Tung-ku.  Although
 the terrain in the southern section is better than that of the northern, its
 mass foundation is not as good as the middle section, and its political
 impact on Kiangsi and Hunan is smaller.  On the other hand, any action in
 the middle section can have a tremendous impact on the lower river valleys
 of Hunan and Kiangsi.
 A stocktaking of the advantages of the middle section reveals:   (a) there
 is a mass foundation that has been built up for more than a year; (b) the
 foundation of the party is strong; (c) local armed forces with rich fighting
 experiences which has reached its present scope after more than a year of
 building up; this force, supplemented by the 4th Red Army, cannot be
 annihilated by any enemy; (d) an ideal military bastion in the Ching-kang
 Mountains, and each county with its own armed bastions elsewhere; (e) it can
 influence Hunan. and Kiangsi, and the lower river valleys of these two
 provinces which, compared to southern Hunan and southern Kiangsi which can
 influence only one province or the upper river valley and the remote areas
 at that, is very different in political significance.   The setback of the
 middle section is that because it has been occupied for a long time, it is
 confronted with enormous enemy forces of suppression, and its economic
 problems, especially the problem of cash, are very serious.
 The policy of the southern Hunan special committee toward us here was changed
 three times during a few weeks in June and July.   First, a message was
 delivered by Yuan Teh-sheng which endorsed a plan to set up a government in
 the middle section.   Then, Tu Hsiu-ching and Yang K'ai-ming came with the
 message that the Red Army should without any hesitation move toward southern
 Hunan, leaving only 200 rifles behind to protect the border area in conjunc-
 tion with the Red Guards corps.  The letter also said that this policy is
 "absolutely" correct.   After only 10 days, Yuan Teh-sheng returned with the
 message that the Red Army march for eastern Hunan which was also described
 as an "absolutely correct" policy.   The letter, besides scolding us at some
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 length, also wanted us to go "without any hesitation."  This rigid directive
 has placed us in a great predicament, because if we should disobey it, it
 would be disobedience on our part,   and if we should observe it, it would
 mean certain defeat.  When the second message came, a joint meeting of the
 special committee, army committee and the county committee of Yung-hsin was
 held.   The consensus was that it would be dangerous to go to southern Hunan,
 and we decided not to obey the views of the provincial committee.  A few
 days later, Tu Hsiu-ching and Yang K'ai-ming insisted that the view of the
 provincial committee should be carried out.   The 29th Regiment which was
 composed mostly of recruits from southern Hunan, used the directive of the
 provincial committee as its excuse to pull the Red Army along to mount an
 attack on Ch'en-chou.   This resulted in a disastrous defeat to the Red Army
 and the border area.   About one-half of the Red Army was lost, while countless
 houses were destroyed and many people were slaughtered in the border area.
 Other counties fell into enemy hands successively, and they have not been
 recovered even now.   In regard, to eastern Hunan, before there is disruption
 in the political power of the big gentry in the three provinces of Hunan,
 Hupeh and Kiangsi, it is also inadvisable to send the main force of the Red
 Army there.   Had it not been for the march toward southern Hunan in July, it
 would have been possible to avert the border defeat in August, and, taking
 advantage of the fighting in Chang-shu between Ch'eng Ch'ien's [4453 3383]
 6th Army and Wang Chun's [3769 6874] forces, to smash the enemy at Yung-hsin,
 thus engulfing Chi-an and An-fu and enabling the vanguards to reach
 P'ing-hsiang to link up with the 5th Army in the northern section.   Even
 so, our general headquarters should still have been in Ning-kang, and only
 guerrilla, units should have been sent to eastern Hunan.   Since fighting
 among the big gentry had not yet erupted,. and there were large enemy forces
 in P'ing-hsiang, Ch'a-ling and Yu-hsien on the Hunan border, when-our main
 force turned northward, it would have been overwhelmed by the enemy.   The
 Central Committee has deemed that it would be perilous to march either
 toward eastern Hunan or southern Hunan.  Although we have as yet had no
 experience in eastern Hunan, our experience in southern Hunan has borne out
 that once a wrong move is made, the entire game is lost.   Contact was lost
 between the border area, southern Hunan and the 5th Army stationed in
 P'ing-chiang and Liu-yang, whole losses were also suffered at An-yuan.   This
 painful experience should be borne in mind at all times.
 At present, the big gentry has not yet been broken up.   There are now 10 or
 more enemy regiments surrounding the border area. If we can continue to
 find some cash resources (the problem of food and clothing is not too
 serious), then, with what foundations we have already built up in the
 border area, it.will be possible for us to cope with the existing enemy
 forces or even more.  For the sake of the border area, if the Red Army should
 depart, then the kind of trampling that happened in August may recur
 immediately.   Although they might not be able to completely annihilate our
 Red Guards units, the foundation of the party and the masses will be
 seriously damaged.  Although it might be possible to preserve some mountain
 strongholds in the manner of bandits, in the plains we would have to go
 underground as in August and September.   But if the Red Army should determine
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 to stay, it will be possible, with its existing foundations, to gradually
 expand to the surrounding areas, and the future will be bright.   For the sake
 of the Red Army, in order to bring about this expansion, a protracted struggle
 must be waged in the environs of the Ching-kang Mountains (namely:  the four
 counties of Ning-kang, Yung-hsin, Ling-hsien and Sui-ch'uan) where we have
 a mass base.   In this situation, we can take advantage of the conflict'of
 interest between the enemies in Hunan and Kiangsi which render it impossible
 for them to concentrate their forces against us.  We must also adopt some
 profitable strategy so that when we go out to fight we must be able to win,
 and with victory there will be captives which can be used to enlarge the Red
 Army gradually.   Thus, with the preparations made by the masses from April
 to July, if the Red Army had not gone to southern Hunan, it would have
 greatly expanded itself in August.   Although the mistake had been made, now
 that the Red Army has returned to the border area where the terrain is
 favorable and the people are friendly, the prospects are still good.   It is,
 therefore, necessary for the Red Army to be resolved to struggle and to have
 the stamina and patience in fighting before it can augment its arms and
 train good soldiers.   There is no other easy way than this.
 The red flag has been hoisted in the border area for more than 1 year.  Al-
 though this has aroused the hatred of the big gentry in the three provinces
 of Hunan, Hupeh and Kiangsi, and even throughout the nation, nonetheless,
 this has also aroused the hopes of the workers, peasants and soldiers in
 the neighboring provinces.   Consequently, "bandit suppression" in the border
 area has been regarded by the warlords as an important event.  As has been
 said by Lu T'i-p'ing [7627 3321 16271, "one year of bandit suppression has
 cost a million dollars," and by Wang Chun, "though they claim to be
 20,000 soldiers, they have only 5,000 rifles."  Such laudatory propaganda
 like this has gradually attracted the attention of enemy soldiers and the
 enemy's lower-echelon officers, and more and more will defect to our ranks.
 This provides another source for the expansion of the Red Army.  Moreover,
 the fact that the red flag has flown over the border area consistently shows
 not only the strength of the Communist Party, but also proves the bankruptcy
 of the ruling class, and it is fraught with political significance nationally,
 Thus, we deem that unless we have reached a dead end economically so that we
 will not be able to maintain ourselves unless we go to southern Kiangsi, we
 must not take such a course.  Maybe we will go to southern Kiangsi when it
 comes to the end of.the ropes, but this will be for economic reasons, not
 political reasons.   Politically, we have always deemed that the policy of
 establishing and expanding political power in the middle section of Lo-hsiao
 mountain range both most necessary and entirely correct.
 (F)   Communications and Others
 (1)   Establishing of communication organs is extremely important.  We have
 handed over to comrades Yuan and Hsiao 200 yuan (4 ounces of gold) and asked
 them to assume full responsibility in setting up the organ.  We will continue
 to be responsible for the funds.   The location should be at P'ing-hsiang.
 A communications organ should also be set up at Chi-an,'which will be handled
 by the Kiangsi provincial committee.

 (2)  When this letter was about finished, we received a letter from the
 Central Committee,  The letter from Hunan contains circular No 47 (on the
 problem of secret organization), though we are still without the resolution
 on military work.  Besides, there is the letter from Comrade Yung-hsien
 dated 15 August which said the letter and the circular from the Central
 Committee had not been received, and the three poems also cannot be found.
 (3)   We have been able to get newspapers and so we are much happier than
 before when we did not see a newspaper for 2 or 3 months.  We still hope
 that you will keep us posted on political conditions and analyses.
 (4)   In regard to Tu Hsiu-ching's error, the representatives' conference of
 the southern expeditionary forces which reached Sha-t'ien in Kuei-tung in
 August has decided to request the provincial committee to punish him
 because Tu represented that committee.
 (5)   The Front Committee has completely endorsed Mao Tse-tung's letter to
 the provincial committee as well as his long letter to the Central Committee
 which will be forwarded thereto by Comrade Yuan.
 (6)   Comrade Yuan Teh-sheng has just returned to the provincial committee
 because he has had to wait for the discussion of and reply to the letter
 of the Central Committee.
 (7)   Hereafter, when you give any direction to us, please refer to our reports
 instead of basing unilaterally on the reports of inspectors.     The report
 made by Inspector Tu Hsiu-ching to the provincial committee in June contains
 views that are entirely wrong (such as, if the Red Guards have 200 more

 conservative, etc.).  The provincial committee has made decisions on the basis
 of such reports, thus causing our defeat.  Moreover, when you give any direc-
 tions on military movements in the future, they must not be too rigid.
 The Central Committee's letter asked us to make our own choice in accordance
 with the environment, which is more flexible and so very proper.   During
 last winter and this spring, the Hunan provincial committee and the southern
 Hunan special committee listened to the rumors of Su Hsien-chun, a regimental
 commander who was dismissed from the party and later made secret charges which
 resulted in Kuo Liang's arrest, and Ho Chieh, a chief of staff who later was
 responsible for arson and murders in Chen-chou.   This is even more dangerous,
 and please don't listen to irresponsible rumors and allegations.

 NOTICE OF THE FOURTH ARMY HEADQUARTERS OF THE RED ARMY
 January 1929
 [Text]   The principle of the Red Army is to prosecute the revolution for the
 people's rights.   The fame and prestige of the army in western Kiangsi spreads
 far.   The plan this time is to advance in separate groups.   The officers and
 soldiers must obey orders.   Fair buying and fair selling, let the facts be
 the proof.   Indiscriminate burning and killing are strictly prohibited.
 Oppression is excessive in all areas in the nation.   The workers and peasants
 are extremely miserable.   Local tyrants and evil gentry lord it over the towns
 and villages.   Everyone is angry over the high interests and rents.   The
 soldiers of the White army suffer hunger and cold.   The petty bourgeois are
 overburdened by taxes and levies.  Foreign commodities crowd out domestic
 merchandise.   There is no one who does not hate imperialism.   The Kuomintang,
 a bandit party, is completely reactionary.  What they say is not what they
 think, and they cannot be very tough.   Sleeping in the same bed, Chiang [5592],
 Kuei [2710], Feng [7458] and Yen [7051] dream different dreams.   The conflicts
 have arisen and the warlords are encountering bad luck.   Like rice which
 satisfies hunger and medicine which cures illness, the principles of the
 communist party are extremely just.   The peasants will take over and cultivate
 the land of the landowners.  No debt will be repaid nor rent delivered.   The
 wages will be increased and the bosses will be responsible.  Work will be
 limited to 8 hours.   The treatment of the soldiers will be improved.   They
 will have a share in land division.   We will accept enemy officers and
 soldiers, and ask no questions of their prior behavior.   The progressive
 method of taxation is the most suitable, and all harsh taxes and levies will
 be swept clean.   The urban merchants save their dimes and nickels.  As long
 as they follow our principles, we will not inquire into their past activities.
 We must be strict toward the foreigners.   Industrial plants and banks will                    D
 be confiscated.   We will not recognize foreign capital and foreign debts.
 We will not allow foreign soldiers and foreign ships on our soil.  Knocking
 down the foreign powers, everyone is happy.   Ousting the warlords, we must be
 thorough in eliminating all evil.   The whole country will rejoice when China
 is united.   The Manchurians, Mongolians, Mohammedans, and Tibetans will have
 their own laws.   The rascals of the National Government must be eradicated
 and their chaotic politics cleansed.   The workers and peasants of.the entire
 nation must arouse themselves, and the day of seizing political power is

 HSING-KUO COUNTY LAND LAW
 [Text]   1. All public land and land belonging to the landlord class are
 confiscated and made into the property of the Hsing-kuo Worker-Peasant-
 Soldier Delegates' Conference Government,, to be allocated to peasants who
 own little or no land, for their cultivation and use.
 2.   After confiscation of all public land and land belonging to the land
 owner class and allocation by the Worker-Peasant-Soldier Government, no land
 may be bought or sold.
 3.   The criteria for land allocation are:
 a.   Use the population as the criterion and equally divide the land among
 the male and female, old and young. b.   Use the labor force as the criterion
 and allocate twice as much to those who can labor than those who cannot.
 Of the above two criteria, the first should be followed, and the second is
 only for areas under special conditions.   The reasons for adopting the first
 criterion are:
 a.   Before the facilities for caring for the old and the young are completed,
 if the land allocation to them is too little, they will not be able to
 maintain a living.
 b.   It is simpler and more convenient to use the population as the criterion
 to divide the land.
 c.   Very few households are without old and young members.  Meanwhile, though
 the old and the young do not have the ability to farm, the government may,
 after land allocation, assign them certain public service tasks, such as
 communication work.
 4.   The criteria for this area of land allocation are:
 a.   Use the township as the unit in land allocation.   b. Combine several
 townships as the unit in land allocation (such as the Hsiao-chiang area in

 Yung-hsin. c. Use the district as the unit in land allocation,  Of the above
 three criteria, the first should be followed, and the second and third may
 be used under special conditions.,
 5.   The methods of dividing hills and woods are;
 a.   The division of tea hills and firewood hills follows the method of land
 division--equal division with the township. as the unit.
 b.   Bamboo hills belong to the soviet, but the peasants may have the use of
 the bamboo with its permission.  For less than 50 stalks, permission of the
 township soviet is required; for less than 100 stalks, that of the district
 soviet is required; and for over 100 stalks, that of the country soviet is
 required.
 c.   All bamboo is marketed by the county soviet, and the proceeds are handled
 by the superior soviet.
 6.   The levy of land taxes is as follows:
 a.   Land taxes are divided into three categories according to the production
 situation:   (1) 15 percent;  (2) 10 percent;  (3) 5. percent.  Of the three
 categories above, the first one should be followed.  The second and third
 may be applied under special conditions with the approval of the supreme
 soviet.
 b.   In case of natural disaster or other special conditions, application for
 land tax exemption may be submitted to the superior soviet for its approval.
 c.   Land taxes are collected by the county soviet and transmitted to the
 superior soviet.
 7.   Rural handicraft workers may, if they so desire, receive a half share of
 the allocation to the peasants.
 8.   The officers and soldiers of the Red Army and Red Guards, and the person-
 nel of the government and other public organs will receive land allocations
 in the same amount as the peasants, and the soviet will hire people to culti-
 vate the land for them.
 Note:  This version of the land law was promulgated when the Red Army arrived
 at Hsing-kuo in southern Kiangsi from the Ching-kang Mountains in the 4th
 month after the formulation of the previous land law.   One important revision
 in the contents was to change "the confiscation of all land" to "the confis-
 cation of public land and land belonging to the landlord class."  It was a
 fundamental change.   There was no other change.   Changes were mot made until
 1930.   Both land laws are kept to show the development of our understanding
 of the land struggle.

 RESOLUTION OF THE NINTH CCP CONGRESS OF THE RED FOURTH ARMY
 West Fukien Ku-t'ien Conference, December 1929
 [Text]   I. Rectification of Incorrect Tendencies Toward Non-Proletarian
 Ideas in the Party
 The many kinds of non-proletarian ideas in the party in the Fourth Army exert
 an extremely powerful influence and constitute a great obstacle to the imple-
 mentation of the party's correct line.   If not thoroughly rectified, the
 Fourth Army will definitely not be able to shoulder the tasks assigned it by
 China's extensive revolutionary struggle.   The source of such incorrect ideas
 naturally lies in the fact that the foundation of the party organization is
 largely built on peasants and other petty bourgeois elements; yet the failure
 of the party's leading organs to wage a concerted and determined struggle
 against such incorrect ideas and to educate the party members along the cor-
 rect line is also an important cause for their existence and growth.   This
 Congress, in accordance with the spirit of the September letter of the "Central
 Committee", now points out the sources and manifestations of the incorrect
 tendencies of the many non-proletarian ideas in the party in the Fourth Army
 and the methods of rectification and calls on the comrades to eliminate
 them thoroughly.
 A.   The Purely Military Viewpoint
 1.   The origin of the purely military viewpoint:
 a.   A low political level.   Those with this viewpoint fail to understand
 political leadership and the fundamental difference between the missions
 of the Red Army and the White army.
 'b.   The mercenary concept.   This is especially so in the numerous prisoners
 of war captured in the.various campaigns who joined the Red Army and brought
 with them a strong mercenary concept, thus laying a foundation for the purely
 military viewpoint in the lower level.
 c.   From the two above factors arises the third, over-confidence in mili-
 tary strength and lack of confidence in the strength of the masses.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 d.   The party's lack of active attention and discussion of military work
 is also a factor for the purely military viewpoint of some of the comrades,
 2.  The purely military viewpoint is unusually widespread among a number of
 comrades in the Red Army.   Its manifestations;
 a.   They regard military affairs and political work as opposed to each
 other, and fail to recognize military work as only one of the tools to
 accomplish the political tasks.   Some even declare:   "When'military work
 is well done, political work is naturally done well;  when military work
 is not well done, political work cannot be well done either."    This is to
 go one step farther and regard military work as leading political work.
 b.  They regard the task of the Red Army as similar to that of the White
 army--merely fighting.   They fail to recognize the fact that the Red Army
 is an armed force for carrying out the political tasks of the class.   In
 its work, especially in China today, the Red Army definitely does not exist
 merely for the sake of fighting.   Besides fighting, it must also shoulder
 such important tasks as agitating, organizing, arming and helping the
 masses, and building political power.   The Red Army does not fight merely
 for the purpose of fighting.   It fights in order to agitate, organize,
 arm and help the masses and build political power.  Apart from such objectives,
 fighting loses its meaning and the Red Army the reason for its existence.
 c.  Therefore, organizationally, they subordinate the political work organ
 to the military work organ and propose the slogan that "the army headquarters
 deals with the public."  If this idea continues to develop, it may lead to
 estrangement from the masses, to usurpation of political power by the army,
 and to a departure from the class position--similar to the path followed by
 the Kuomintang army.
 d.   Meanwhile, they overlook the importance of the propaganda team in
 propaganda work and ignore the soldiers' council and the worker-peasant
 masses in mass organization work.   As a result, both propaganda and organiza-
 tion work are abandoned.
 e.   They are conceited when a battle is won and dejected when one is lost.
 f.   They subscribe to departmentalism of the Fourth Army, approaching
 everything in the interest of the Fourth Army without understanding that to
 arm the local masses is one of the Red Army's important tasks.  This is an
 enlarged form of cliquism.
 g.   Limited by the immediate environment in the Fourth Army, a small num-
 ber of comrades think that no other revolutionary force exists, resulting
 in the extremely deep-rooted idea of conserving. its strength by avoiding
 action.  This is a remnant of opportunism.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 h.   Disregarding the subjective and objective conditions, they suffer
 from revolutionary impetuosity,'are unwilling to perform detailed and care-
 ful mass work, and only want to do big things, filling their mind with
 illusions. This is a remnant of adventurism.
 .a.   The political level of the party must be raised by means of education,
 and the theoretical source of the military viewpoint eradicated.   The remnants
 of opportunism and adventurism must be eliminated, and the departmentalism of
 the Fourth Army broken down.
 b.   The political training of the officers and soldiers must be intensified,
 especially the education of the captive elements during the period of their
 induction.  Meanwhile, local political power organs must select, as many as
 possible, worker and peasant elements with struggle experiences to join the
 Red Army, in order to weaken and eliminate the source of the simple military
 viewpoint organizationally.
 c.   Local party units must be activated to criticize the party in the Red
 Army and mass political power organizations (soviets) encouraged to criticize
 the Red Army, in order to influence the party and the officers and soldiers
 of the Red Army.
 d.   The party must actively pay attention to military work and hold dis-
 cussions on it.   All tasks, after discussion and decision by the party,
 must be implemented through the mass line.
 e.   Rules and regulations must be formu]ated, clearly defining the tasks
 of the Red Army, the relations between the military work and political work
 organs, the relations between the Red Army and the masses, and the powers
 and functions of the soldiers' council and its relationship with the
 military and political organs.
 B.   Ultra-Democratization
 1.   After the party in the Red Army accepted the directives of the Party
 Central, ultra-democratization has definitely diminished considerably.   That
 party resolutions are, better implemented, and that such slogans as "demo-
 cratic centralism from the bottom to the top" and "discussion at the lower
 level first before decision by the higher level," for instance, are no
 longer heard are facts.  Nevertheless, such diminution is only superficial,
 and ultra-democratization definitely has not been fundamentally eliminated
 from the mind of the party members in general.   In other words, the poison
 roots of ultra-democratization still lie deep in the minds of many comrades.
 The reluctance in carrying out resolutions is one of the instances.
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 a. The roots of ultra-democratization must be eradicated.   First of all,
 it should be pointed out that its danger lies in the tendency to damage and
 even completely destroy the party organization, to undermine and even com-
 pletely wipe out the party's fighting power, and to incapacitate the party
 from shouldering its fighting tasks, thereby causing the failure of the
 revolution and prolonging the counterrevolutionary life of the ruling class.
 Next, it should be pointed out that the source of ultra-democratization lies
 in the nature of the petty bourgeoisie (small farm production and urban
 small capital)--its individualistic aversion to discipline.   Such nature,
 having found its way into the party, manifests itself politically and
 organizationally as the idea of ultra-democratization.   Such idea is
 basically incompatible with the fighting tasks of the proletariat.   ob-
 jectively, it is actually one of the counterrevolutionary ideas.   If not
 vigorously rectified, and if permitted to develop, those with such idea
 will inevitably follow the counterrevolutionary path.
 b.   Organizationally, the democratic way of life under centralized guidance
 must. be strictly enforced.   The line for this is:
 (1)   The party's leading organ must provide a correct line of guidance
 and find solutions when problems arise, in order to establish itself as a
 leading center.
 (2)   The higher level organ must understand the conditions of the lower
 level organs and the life of the masses, in order to secure the social
 source of correct guidance. .
 (3)   The party organizations of all levels must not make decisions without
 due deliberation.  Once a decision is reached, it must be firmly implemented.
 (4)   All decisions of any importance made by the party's higher level
 organs must be promptly transmitted to the lower level organs and the member-
 ship masses.   The method for doing so is to call activists meetings, party
 branch meetings, or even party membership mass meetings in the columns
 (when circumstances permit) and to assign men to make reports at such
 meetings.
 (5)  The lower level organs of the party and the membership masses must
 discuss in detail the directives from the higher level in order to under-
 stand their significance thoroughly and decide on the methods of implementa-
 tion.
 C.   The Non-Organizational Viewpoint
 The non-organizational viewpoint in the party in the Fourth Army is mani-
 fested in many aspects.   The most apparent are the following three categories:
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 1.   The minority refusing to obey the majority:
 If a proposal is rejected, the individual concerned becomes extremely dis-
 satisfied and is insincere in implementing the party's resolution.   This is
 one of the instances.
 The methods of rectification:
 a.   At a meeting, all the people should be made to voice their opinions
 fully.   They must understand that the right and wrong sides over a contro-
 versial issue must be clearly established without compromise or equivoca-
 tion.                Anything that cannot be settled at one meeting can be discussed at
 another (provided no work is affected) in order to reach a clear-cut conclu-
 sion.
 b.   Party discipline requires, among other things, that the minority obey
 the majority.   The minority, after their proposal has been rejected at a
 meeting and before the holding of the next meeting, must support the decision
 of the majority.   Besides bringing it up again at the next meeting, they must
 not show any opposition in their action.
 2.  Non-organizational criticisms:
 a.      Inner-party criticism is a weapon to re-enforce the party organization
 and increase the party's fighting power.  Yet many in.the Red Army do not
 understand this significance and erroneously use inner-party criticism for
 personal attacks.   As a result, it damages not only the individuals but the
 party organization.   This is a manifestation of petty bourgeois individualism.
 The method of rectification is to make the party members understand that the
 significance of criticism is to re-enforce the party's fighting power in
 order to attain victory of the class struggle and that it must never be
 used as a tool for personal attacks.
 b.   Many party members make their criticisms not inside the party but
 outside it.   This is because of the failure to implant the political signi-
 ficance of the party organization into the concept of the party members in
 general; therefore, they do not understand the importance of the party
 organization (meetings, etc.), finding no difference between criticizing
 inside or outside the. organization.   This may also result in leading the
 party to destruction.   The method of rectification is to implant the
 political significance of the party organization into the concept of the
 party members in general.   Only thus will all the irresponsible non-organi-
 zational criticisms giving the masses an unfavorable influence be wiped out.
 3.   Elitism of some party members:
 On ground of being busy, some party members are actually unwilling to associate
 with the masses and fear their criticisms; therefore, they do not attend the,
 party branch mass meetings and cell meetings.  When they do attend, they
 do not make work reports.   In everything, they differentiate themselves from

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 the general party members.  As a result, they are severed from the masses,
 from the party.   On this point, the  responsible persons of the party branch
 have not only failed to rectify the situation, but seemed to fear such elite
 party members.
 The creation of this situation is due to the following reasons:
 First, the Red Army has always made a serious error:  The party organ seldom
 pays attention to the discussion of military affairs; therefore, it has not
 urged the responsible comrades of the military affairs organ to make reports
 on military plans (such as training, management and combat plans) at party
 conferences.   As a result, party discussions are separated from military
 affairs, and the responsible military affairs comrades forget that they must
 accept party guidance and make reports to the party.   In consequence, the
 military affairs work of the Red Army becomes a special part not understood
 by the party organ and the general party members.   Thus, it not only greatly
 hampers the task of the militarization of the party members, bur also severs
 the party from military affairs, endangering the party's leadership of the
 army.  Next, due to the serious error of the party in its tasks discussed
 above, some of the responsible military affairs comrades have become an elite
 group in the party.  Meanwhile, the responsible comrades in charge of other
 work have also become elite individuals who are unwilling to attend meetings
 or to express themselves at meetings.  This is one reason for the party
 branch of the Red Army to become so abnormal and unsound.
 The methods of rectification are:   First, the meetings of all levels of the
 party.(from the party branch to the Front Committee) must include the plans
 and reports of military affairs work in their daily agenda for discussion
 and decision.  Next, regardless of their functions, party members must attend
 party branch mass meetings and cell meetings and make work reports.   They
 must not be absent without cause.
 D.   Absolute Equalitarianism
 1.   At one time, absolute equalitarianism in the Red Army developed to a
 very serious extent.   After many struggles, it has certainly diminished
 considerably, but some dregs still remain, such as objecting to different
 allowances to the wounded soldiers according to the extent of the injury
 but insisting on equal amounts, denying the necessity for officers to ride
 horses in performing their duties but regarding riding as an inequality,
 demanding absolutely equal distribution of supplies and objecting to larger
 allotments to special cases, demanding equal assignment for all persons in
 carrying rice, regardless of age or physical condition, demanding equal
 space in billeting and even condemning the headquarters for occupying
 larger quarters, demanding equal assignnent of duties and refusing any
 extra work, and even abandoning both wounded men when there is only one
 stretcher rather than carrying only one of them.   All such instances indi-
 cate that absolute equalitarianism among the Red Army officers and soldiers
 has not been fundamentally eradicated from the mind of the masses.  Whatever
 that has been eradicated is merely partial or superficial..

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 2.   Similar to ultra-democratization in politics, absolute equalitarianism
 is a product of the handicraft and small peasant economy, except that one is
 manifested in. the political aspect and the other in the material aspect.
 3.   The method of rectification is as follows;   It must be pointed out
 theoretically that not only is absolute equalitarianism merely an illusion
 of the peasants and petty bourgeois in the days before the disappearance
 of capitalism but, even in the period of the socialist economy, material
 distribution must be adjusted to the needs of the individuals and the tasks.
 There definitely cannot be absolute. equality.   The maximum equality in
 material distribution in the Red Army should. be attained, such as equal pay
 and equal rations for the officers and men, because it is the need of the
 struggle in the current environment.   But absolute equality beyond reason
 must be opposed, because it is not the need of the struggle.   On the contrary,
 it will hamper the struggle.
 E.   The Idealist Concept
 1.   The idealist concept is extremely serious among party members in the
 Red Army, and it constitutes an extremely great obstacle to political analysis,
 work guidance, and the party organization.   The inevitable accompanying result
 of idealist analysis of politics and idealist guidance of work is either
 opportunism or adventurism.   As for the idealist critical spirit inside the
 party, random talk not based on evidence, or mutual suspicion, it often leads
 to controversies in the party not involving principles and without significance
 and to disruption of the party organization.
 In regard to the issue of inner-party criticisms, besides the idealist criti-
 cal spirit, we should also mention the non-political critical spirit.   The
 major function of criticism is to point out political errors.   Pointing out
 organizational errors comes next.   As for defects in personal life and minor
 technical mistakes, if they are not closely connected with political or
 organizational errors, it is not necessary to be so censorious as to place
 the comrades concerned in a quandary.  Moreover, once technical criticisms
 develop, the attention of the party may become entirely diverted to common-
 place technical trivialities, and everyone may become cautious and timorous,
 thereby forgetting the party's political tasks.   This is the greatest
 danger.   Similar to the unscientific idealist critical spirit, the inner-
 party technical and non-political critical spirit in the Red Army will in-
 evitably produce (and has already produced) the worst result.
 2.   The only method of rectification is to raise the political and scientific
 levels of the party members in their thinking and inner-party life.   To
 attain this goal, it is necessary to:   a. Educate the party members to
 political analysis and class strength assessment with the Marxist
 order to replace the idealist method of analysis and assessment.
 the party members pay attention to survey and study of the social
 as a basis to determine the struggle strategy and work method, so
 comrades know that, apart from practical survey, they will fall into the
 make
 method, in

 of fantasy and adventurism.   c. Eliminate the idealist and technical spirit
 in inner-party criticism, basing all statements on evidence and giving atten-
 tion to the political significance when discussing work.
 1.   The individualist tendency in the party in the Red Army manifests itself
 as follows:
 a.   Vindictiveness:  After being criticized inside the party by a soldier
 comrade, the individualist will seek a chance to retaliate outside the
 party--beating or scolding is one way of retaliation.   There are many such
 instances.   Sometimes, retaliation is sought inside the party:  You attack
 me at this meeting, so I shall retaliate by finding fault with you at the
 next. There are also many instances of such.   Such vindictiveness proceeds
 solely from the personal viewpoint.   The individualist is ignorant of class
 interest or party life as a whole.  He only knows himself.  His target is
 not the enemy class but other individuals in his'own ranks.  It is a corro-
 sive which can weaken the organization and its fighting power.
 b.   Cliquism:  On the surface, it is an expanded individualism, but under-
 neath, it is still the narrow individualism.   It also produces a strong
 corrosive and centrifugal effect.  In the Red Army, cliquism has all along
 been rampant; although it has now become less serious as a.  result of criticism,
 its remnants still exist and further struggle is needed.
 c.   The mercenary concept:  A person with a mercenary concept fails to
 recognize that the party and the Red Army are the tools to implement the
 class tasks, and that he, himself, is a member thereof.  He fails to realize
 that he, himself, plays a main role in the struggle, but feels that the
 struggle has nothing to do with himself, and that he is responsible only to
 the superior officers of the Red Army or the party organ, not to the revolu-
 tion.  Such mercenary concept of revolution is rather widespread in the Red
 Army. It is the reason why there are not many unconditional, enthusiastic,
 and positive activists.   If the mercenary concept is not eliminated, the
 number of positive activists will not increase, and the heavy burden of
 revolution will always rest on the shoulders of a few, much to the detriment
 of the struggle.
 d. Hedonism:   In the Red Army, there are also quite a few whose indi-
 vidualism finds expression in hedonism.   They constantly hope that the
 troops will march to the big cities.   They want to go there not to work but
 to enjoy themselves.   What they dislike most is, to work in the Red areas
 where life is hard.   The result of hedonism is thinking of personal interest
 only, without consideration of the entire revolution or group action.
 e.   Passive slowdown:  With the least bit of dissatisfaction, an individual
 with this tendency becomes passive and slows down in his work.   Though the
 basic reason is individualism, because he has not accurately recognized his

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 own class tasks, there are also objective reasons such as improper handling
 of incidents, work assignments,   or enforcement of discipline in the party
 and the army.
 f.   The desire to leave the army:  The number of people who ask for
 transfer from the ranks to local work is on the rise.   This is not entirely
 due to subjective individualism, but also to (1) the material hardships in
 the Red Army;  (2) exhaustion after a long struggle; and (3) objective environ-,
 mental reasons of improper handling of incidents, work assignments or
 enforcement of discipline.
 2.  The origin of individualism is the influence of the small peasant and
 bourgeois ideologies in the party.   The method of rectification is mainly
 through education, rectifying individualism in thinking.  Next, the handling
 of incidents, work assignments and enforcement of discipline must be proper.
 In addition, measures must be taken to improve the material life of the Red
 Army, utilizing all opportunities for rest and rehabilitation, in order to
 better the objective conditions.
 G.   The Idea of Roving Insurgents
 1.   The origin of the idea of roving insurgents in the Red Army is as follows:
 a. Homeless proletarians constitute the majority of the Red Army.   This is
 the immediate cause.   b. The remote cause is the existence of large groups
 of vagrants throughout the country, especially the southern provinces.  With
 these two causes, the political thinking and action with the idea of roving
 insurgents are created in the Red Army.  However, in today's China under
 imperialist control, especially with the import of advanced weapons (grenades,
 steel cannon, machine guns, etc.), advanced communication methods (military
 telephones and radios), and advanced transport means (motor vehicles, steam-
 ships, railways), the large-scale roving insurgent actions in the style of
 Huang Ch'ao, Li Ch'uang or Hung Hsiu-ch'uan are no longer feasible; therefore,
 the idea of roving insurgents naturally cannot become the final and effective
 idea of the Red Army in its actions.  Nevertheless, its influence, as mani-
 fested in the various aspects, is still very strong, such as;   a. being
 unwilling to help the masses build political power by strenuous work for the
 purpose of expanding political influence, but thinking only of accomplishing
 the purpose by the mobile guerrilla method;  b. in the organizational line
 of expanding the Red Army, following not the line of expanding the local
 Red Guard, the local units of the Red Army, or even the non-local units of
 the Red Army, but the line of "recruiting soldiers and buying horses" and
 "recruiting captives and accepting rebels";  c. being impatient to wage a
 hard struggle together with the masses, but only hoping to go to the big
 cities to eat and drink.  All such manifestations of the idea of roving
 insurgents seriously hamper the Red Army in performing the momentous tasks
 assigned it by the revolution.   Thus, the elimination of this idea is indeed
 one of the important goals of the inner-party ideological struggle in the
 Red Army.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 a.   Change the incorrect ideas in the party coming from the vagrant elements
 through education in order to eliminate the idea of roving insurgents.
 b.   Intensify the anti-vagabondism education of the current basic troops
 of the Red Army and future captives.
 c.   Recruit active elements among the workers and peasants with struggle
 experiences to join the current ranks of the Red Army in order to change its
 components.
 d.   Raise new troops from the struggling worker-peasant masses.
 1.  The party in the Red Army has exerted a great effort in the struggle
 against adventurism but not yet-to the full extent.  Therefore, remnants of
 adventurism still exist in the Red Army even though much of the adventurist
 idea and action has been overcome.  Adventurism comes from a combination of
 the lumpen proletarian ideology and the petty bourgeois ideology.   Its
 manifestations are:   a. Blind action without regard of the subjective and
 objective conditions.   b. Inadequate and irresolute implementation of urban
 policies.   c. Slack military discipline, especially when suffering a defeat.
 d. Setting fire to houses without consideration of the mass foundation,. which
 is a misconduct to varying extents in all the units.   e. The practice of
 executing deserters and of corporal punishment which are partially due to
 adventurism.
 2.   The methods of rectification:   a. Eliminate adventurism theoretically.
 .b. Rectify adventurist actions by systems and policies.
 II.   Organization of the Party
 The issue of the party organization in the Red Army has reached a very.
 critical stage, especially the inferior quality of the party members and the
 slack organization, which affect the leadership of the Red Army and the
 implementation of policies.   The Congress has made a careful analysis of the
 issue and come to a decision.   The comrades must follow the spirit of the
 Congress and strive to reform the party organization, in order to enable it
 to truly shoulder the party's political tasks.   Only then can we consider
 it successful.
 A.   The Party's Organizational Line
 1.   The combat soldiers are the main objectives in the development line of
 party members.  Meanwhile, the noncombatants, such as porters and orderlies,
 must not be neglected.
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 2.   A party branch must be organized in every company and a cell in every
 squad.   This is one of the important principles of party organization in the
 army.   In units where the number of party members is too small and a cell
 cannot actually be organized, the platoon may be used temporarily as the
 unit to organize a cell and its members must be assigned systematically
 to the squads.. But it must be understood that this is only a transitional
 measure.
 3.   The current organization method of cells in the Red Army, i.e., the
 method of mixing the cadre and general elements and the intellectual and
 laboring elements is correct, but those with different occupations and
 different abilities must also be systematically and successfully mixed when
 organizing.   Hereafter, more attention must be given to this point.  As for
 simply organizing the cadres into cells, it is undesirable.
 B.   The Slack Organization of the Party
 1.   The current situation of the party organization in the Fourth Army:
 a.   Enrollment is too easy.  Many without the proper qualifications are
 also dragged into the party, especially officers, who do not have to satisfy
 any requirement to join the party.   Therefore, the quality of the party has
 become very inferior.
 b.   The party units of the various levels solve the problems in their work
 but forget the task of educating the comrades.   There are very few training
 meetings, such as activists mass meetings, joint meetings of secretaries and
 propaganda sections, joint meetings of committees, party branch mass meetings,
 column or detachment party members' mass meetings.
 c.   Discipline in general is lax.   This is especially true in regard to
 individuals in charge of important work and who are irreplaceable.   Their
 mistakes are often overlooked, and discipline is not enforced.  When one
 person is treated this way, others have to be treated the same way.  Thus,
 discipline in general .is slackened.
 d.   All the officers are party members.  As a result, all those working
 in military affairs and political organs pay little attention to their
 social occupational work, feeling that social occupational work is party
 work and failing to distinguish the two.   The military affairs work con-
 ferences and the political work conferences of the various levels are almost
 never held.   They think that, whatever it is, once it is decided by the party,
 that is the end of it.   That the party member produces a nucleus effect in
 social occupation is never discussed.
 e.   The higher and lower levels do not have a close relationship.   The
 higher level seldom comments or makes instructions on the reports of the
 lower level, and it seldom sends men to attend the meetings of the latter.
 While this is due to the lack of soundness. of the organization of the higher
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 level, the lack of positivity in its work attitude is also one of the reasons
 for the absence or inadequacy of its guidance of the lower level.  This is
 especially true in regard to directing practical work, such as the lack of
 detailed instructions to units embarking on guerrilla work,  In some units,
 even rough guidance is almost nonexistent.
 f.   Many party branch mass meetings and cell meetings are not held on time.
 a.   The old foundation must be thoroughly overhauled. Those with erroneous
 political concepts, smoking opium, making illegal profits, or gambling,
 and refusing to reform after many warnings, be they cadres or not, must all
 be expelled from the party.
 b.   The requirements for new party members hereafter:
 (1)  No mistake in political concept (including class awareness),
 (2)  Honesty.
 (3)  Possessing the spirit of sacrifice, and able to work positively.
 (4)  No desire for illegal profits.
 (5)  Abstinence from opium and.gambling.
 Only those meeting all five requirements will be introduced into the party.
 The introducer must verify in advance whether the introduced truly satis-
 fies the requirements, and the necessary procedure of introduction must be
 followed.    After joining the party, the new member must be informed in
 detail the party branch life (including secret work) and the important
 points to be observed by party members.   The introducer must shoulder
 certain responsibilities toward the introduced.   The party branch committee
 must assign someone to interview the membership applicant and ascertain his
 qualifications.
 c.  In addition to solving problems and directing practical work, the
 party units of the various levels also have the tremendous task of educating
 the comrades.   They must systematically hold all kinds of training con-
 ferences and other modes of training, such as training classes and discus-
 sion meetings.
 . d. Discipline must be strictly enforced, and the practice of merely
 paying lip service to discipline stopped.
 e. The natures of the party members' social occupation and their party
 work must be distinguished.   Each and every party member must undertake a
 social occupation, and perform the work assigned him by the party in his
 social occupation (except those responsible for important functions or
 specialized tasks in the party who are professional revolutionaries).
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 f.   The work attitude of the party units of all levels must become more
 positive than ever before.  The lower level must make detailed reports to the
 higher level, and the latter must discuss and reply to such reports in detail
 and, whenever possible, assign men to attend the meetings of the lower level.
 It must not borrow the excuses of shortage of personnel, inadequate work
 capacity, and insufficient time to cover up its own lack of enthusiasm and
 negligence in work.
 g.   The party branch committee and the party units above it must systema-
 tically decide on the material for discussion at the party branch mass
 meetings and cell meetings every month, determine the meeting schedules, and
 strictly enforce the holding of meetings.
 C.   How to Make the Meetings Interesting
 1.   The reasons for the party members' lack of interest in attending meetings:
 a.  They do not understand the significance of meetings.   The important
 significance of the party branch meeting is primarily to solve problems.
 All struggle and internal problems must be solved by concentrated discussion
 at the meetings.   If a party member does not attend, or if he does not
 actively express his opinions when attending, it will indicate his failure
 to understand the political significance of the meeting and his lack of
 interest in struggle.  Anyone with a positive feeling toward struggle will
 attend the meetings enthusiastically and express himself eagerly.   The next
 significance is to educate the comrades.  Meetings not only solve problems
 but, in the process of solving problems, the circumstances of the problems
 must be investigated and the instructions. of the higher level studied, thus
 activating the mind and talent of the comrades.   As the meetings become
 political and practical, the mind of the comrades also become political
 and practical.   Then, the party's fighting power is increased.   This is the
 educational significance of meetings.   The failure of the party members
 of the'Red Army to understand such significance constitutes the first reason
 for their nonattendance or lack of interest.
 b.   When resolutions are not implemented or inquiries to the higher level
 are not answered for a prolonged period, the party members lose interest
 in the discussions.
 c.   The responsible persons fail to make proper preparations in advance,
 to formulate an agenda, to clarify the contents and circumstances of the
 problems, or to form some opinions ahead of time on the solution of the
 problems.
 d.   The chairman often interrupts at will a party member.  When a state-
 ment is slightly off the subject under discussion, the chairman will
 immediately stop him, and the party member becomes discouraged and keeps
 quiet.  If there is any mistake in the statement, the chairman will also
 ridicule him in addition to stopping him.

 e. The feudal style order of meeting is inflexible and sterotyped, and
 attending a meeting is similar to sitting in jail.
 2.   The methods of rectification:
 First, the meetings must become political and practical.   Second, the comrades
 must constantly be reminded of the important significance of meetings,
 especially in regard to new members and members who are not positive in their
 work.   Third, resolutions must not be passed lightly.   Once a resolution is
 passed, it must be firmly implemented.   Fourth, the higher level must be
 prompt in answering the questions of the lower level.   It must not delay too
 long, causing the lower level to lose its fervor.   Fifth, the responsible
 -persons must prepare the agenda in advance.   They must make the agenda
 concrete, clarify in advance the contents and circumstances of the problems,
 and give some prior thought to the solutions.   Sixth, the chairman must handle
 the meeting skillfully and channel the current of discussion toward the topic
 on hand.  However, should there be any development of important significance
 beyond the topic, he must not only refrain from interrupting the speaker
 and discouraging him, but must carefully seize upon the development, intro-
 duce it to everyone, and form a new topic of discussion.   Only then will
 the meeting become interesting, the problems truly solved and the educational
 significance of the meeting truly realized.   Seventh, the feudal order of
 meeting must be abolished.   The meeting of communist party members must
 reflect the positive, lively and joyful spirit of the proletariat and
 incorporate it into the order of the meeting.
 D.   Youth Organization in the Party in the Red Army and Its Work
 1.   The interests of the youths and adults in the troops cannot be separated,
 and the league has no special work objectives.   Moreover, only when the party
 cell is built with the squad as the unit will it benefit the struggle.
 Therefore, there is no necessity to establish league tells in the party
 branch.
 2.   As the youths among the party members possess different feelings from
 the adults, besides general party training, they must receive a special
 youth education.  Furthermore, in view of the fact that fighting for the
 young worker-peasant masses is one of the party's important tasks, there
 must be a special organization to handle it.   Therefore, young party members
 in the party under 20 years of age (except those under special conditions,
 such as being in charge of the party's important work) must be assigned to
 form a youth work conference.   In regard to such conferences, besides regu-
 lar and systematic meetings with the battalion as the unit, the detachments
 and columns must also deliberate on the time and call meetings.
 3.   For.the purposes of planning the education of youth party members,
 devising means to fight for the young worker-peasant masses, and directing
 the youth work conference, five-member youth work committees must be formed
 in the Front Committee and column committee, and youth commissars appointed
 in the detachment committee and party branch committee, under the guidance
 of party units of the various levels.

 E.   Relationship Between the Political Commissar and Inner-Party Work
 Party secretaries of battalion and detachment levels must not, in principle,
 also serve as political commissars.   However, in units with personnel
 shortage, they may temporarily serve in both capacities,   In regard to poli-
 tical commissars who do not also serve as party secretaries, the higher
 level party unit must study the situation and, under suitable circumstances,
 assign them as special. emissaries of the party with the duty of directing
 the party work of their levels.
 F.   The Highest Party Organization of Directly Subordinate Units
 The directly subordinate units of the army and the columns must organize
 directly subordinate unit committees as the highest party organizations,
 consisting of five to seven members.
 G.   The Question of Establishing Party and Youth League Organizations in
 Soldiers' Associations
 No party or youth league organizations should be established in soldiers'
 associations at the battalion level, and the work of these associations
 should be guided by the party branch committees concerned; but party and
 youth league organizations should be established in soldiers'. associations
 at the column level, and the work of these organizations should be guided
 by the party committees of the columns concerned.
 III.   Inner-Party Education
 A.   Significance
 Education must be considered the most urgent issue in the party in the Red
 Army.   For the purpose of improving and expanding the Red Army and enabling
 it to shoulder the struggle tasks, we must start from inner-party education.
 If the political level in the party is not raised, if the many biases are
 not eliminated, we definitely cannot improve and expand the Red Army,
 nor enable it to shoulder the momentous struggle tasks.   Therefore, carrying
 out planned-inner-party education and correcting the unplanned and laissez-
 faire situation of the past constitute one of the important tasks of the
 party.   The Congress has decided to educate the party members with the
 following materials and methods.   The leading organs of the party must hold
 more detailed discussions to implement the task.
 1.   Political analyses.
 2.   Discussion of documents from higher level leading organs.
 3.   Organization knowledge.
 4.   Rectification of eight erroneous ideas in the party in the Red Army.
 5.   Discussion of anti-opportunism and the opposition faction against
 Trotskyism.

 Propaganda Work of the Red Army
 A.
 Significance of the Propaganda Work of the Red Army
 The goal of the propaganda work of the Red Army is to expand our political
 influence and fight for the broad masses.   Only when this goal is realized
 will the general goal of the Red Army, such as organizing the masses,
 arming the masses, building political power, eliminating the reactionary
 forces, and promoting the revolutionary high tide, be realized.   Therefore,
 propaganda work is the foremost task of the Red Army.   Overlooking it is
 abandoning the main task of the Red Army and equivalent to helping the
 ruling class undermine its power.

 B.   Current Situation of the Propaganda Work of the Red Army
 1.   Defects of the propaganda contents:
 a.   No concrete political outline has been published.. (The political out-
 lines published before, such as the four-word announcements, were not concrete.)
 b.   Propaganda and encouragement of the daily struggles of the masses
 are overlooked.
 c.   Winning of the urban poor is overlooked.
 d.   Propaganda to the women masses is overlooked.
 e.   Propaganda to the youth masses is inadequate.
 f.   Propaganda to the lumpen proletariat is inadequate,
 g.   Propaganda against the armed organizations of the landowner class
 (Civil League, Ching-wei League, etc.) is very little.
 h. There is no proper choice of time and place in propaganda.
 2.   Defects of the propaganda technique:
 a. The propaganda team is-not sound.
 (1)   The number of'propagandists has been reduced from five per battalion
 to three, or even down to one.or two, or none.
 (2)   The quality of the propagandists is too inferior.   They include
 captives, cooks, grooms, opium smokers, suspected deserters who are disarmed,
 those who failed as clerks, and cripples unwanted by other work units.
 Today's propaganda team has actually become a receiving station and is
 completely incapable of performing its duties.
 (3)   Almost all the officers and soldiers reject the propaganda team
 (partly because of the inferior quality of the propagandists and their lack
 of achievement, resulting in the dissatisfaction of others).   "Loafers"
 and "fake medicine peddlars" are the nicknames given them.
 (4)   The propaganda teams do not have adequate funds.
 (5)   The training of the propagandists is not systematic, nor the super-
 vision of their work adequate.   Therefore,. the work of the propaganda team
 is very sketchy, and no one pays any attention whether it does anything or not.
 b.   The handbills, announcements and declarations are outmoded and stale,
 and distribution and mailing are not properly handled.

 c.   There are very few wall bulletins; the brief political reports are too
 simple in content and too few; and the characters are too small and too hard
 to read.
 d.   There is practically no revolutionary songs.
 e.   Only a few pictorials have been published.,
 f.   There is no costumed propaganda.
 g.,  Clubs with the double significance of recreation for the soldiers and
 association with the worker-peasant masses have not been organized.
 h.   Verbal propaganda is too little and too inferior.
 i..   The discipline of the Red Army is a practical propaganda to the masses.
 Now discipline is more lax than before; therefore, it produces an unfavorable
 impression on the masses.
 j.   Putting up the gate boards, bundling rice straw, sweeping the floor,
 friendliness in conversation, fair buying and selling, returning intact.
 borrowed things, and reimbursing for losses all constitute a kind of the
 Red Army's propaganda work, but now they are not fully performed.
 k.   Mass meetings are seldom held, and not successful when held.
 1.   The method of propagandizing to the White soldiers is not good.
 C.   The Lines of Rectification
 1.   Propaganda contents:
 a.   A concrete political program should be published, and be called the
 "Red Army Political Program."
 'b.   Propaganda must be compatible with the struggle sentiments of the
 masses.  Besides the general riot slogans, there must also be slogans on
 daily life, in conjunction with the riot slogans, in areas where the struggle
 sentiments of the masses are still low, in order to activate the daily
 struggles.
 c.   The urban poor (middle and small merchants and students). constitutes
 a considerable strength in the civil rights revolution.   Overlooking this
 strength is equivalent to presenting it to the big business bourgeoisie.
 Hereafter, in regard to the urban middle and small merchant and student
 masses, intensive propaganda work must be performed in order to win them over.
 d.   Women constitute half of the population.  The economic position of the
 laboring women and the extreme oppression suffered by them not only indicate'
 that they are in urgent need of revolution but also that they will constitute

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 a determining force of the revolution.
 Hereafter, there must be effective
 slogans and extensive propaganda toward them,
 e.   The toiling youth masses constitute over 30 percent of the population,
 and they are also the bravest and firmest in struggle.   Therefore, propaganda
 to win the youth masses is an important task in the entire propaganda program.
 f.   In regard to China's broad lumpen masses, if they take the side of the
 revolutionary class, they will. become an instrument of the revolution; if they
 take the side of the reactionary class, they will become an instrument of the
 counterrevolution.   Therefore, winning them over from under the influence of
 the reactionary class is one of the party's propaganda tasks.  When performing
 propaganda work, attention must be given to the life and nature of the dif-
 ferent groups of vagrants and appropriate propaganda measures adopted.
 g.   The destruction of the armed organizations of the landlord class and
 the winning over of their masses constitute one of the conditions for the
 victory of the rural land revolution..  Hereafter, special attention must be
 given to the propaganda work on the membership masses of the civil defense
 and pacification units.
 h.   The propaganda and agitation slogans must be adapted to the particular
 areas, and different slogans must also be created according to the different
 times (such as fall harvest, year-end, the Chiang [5592]-Kuei [2710] war
 period and the Wang [3076]-Chiang [5592] war period).
 2. Propaganda technique:
 a.   The propaganda team:
 (1)   Significance:  The Red Army propaganda team is an important tool
 of its propaganda work.   If the propaganda team is not well organized, a
 large part of the Red Army's propaganda task is wasted.   Therefore, the reform
 and training of the propaganda team is one of the tasks at present requiring
 the party's re-enforced endeavor.   The first step is to correct, from the
 theoretical aspect, the contempt felt by the officers and soldiers for
 propaganda work and propaganda teams.   Such odd nicknames as "loafers" and
 "fake medicine peddlers" must be deleted hereafter.
 (2)   Organization:
 (a)   Take each detachment as a unit; the detachments directly sub-
 ordinate to the army and column command will eacn form a unit.   Each unit
 will organize a propaganda team composed of a commander and a deputy
 commander, 16 propagandists, 1 porter (carrying propaganda materials), and
 2 orderlies.    The propagandists of each company are divided into a number of
 subunits (the number of subunits to be decided according to the number of
 battalions or other troop units and organs), and each subunit has a leader
 and three propagandists.

 (b)   The detachment propaganda team is under the command of. the detach-
 ment political commissar.  When the battalions proceed separately to perform
 guerrilla work, each battalion must have attached to it a propaganda subunit
 under the command of the battalion political commissar.  The propaganda teams
 of the columns are under the command of the propaganda section of the column
 political department.  The army propaganda team is under the direction of the
 propaganda section of the army political department.
 (c)  The funds of the propaganda teams are disbursed by the political
 department; they must be adequate.
 (d)  In regard to improving the quality of the propagandists, besides
 requesting the local governments to select progressive elements to join the
 Red Army propaganda team, the superior elements among the soldiers in the
 various units must be selected (excluding,the squad leaders wherever
 possible) to serve as propagandists.   The political department. must regularly
 formulate training plans for the propaganda team, specify the training
 material, method, time and instructors, and actively improve the quality of
 the propagandists.
 b.   In regard to the propaganda documents, such as handbills, announcements
 and declarations, the existing ones should be reviewed, and new ones drafted
 promptly.
 The suitable and effective distribution of propaganda material is an important
 item in the technique of the propaganda team.   The political work organs must
 give attention to such means as sending propaganda by mail, enclosing propaganda
 material among other matters through the mail, or printing propaganda and
 agitation slogans on postal matters, and they must do so successfully.
 c.  Wall bulletins are one of the important means of mass propaganda.   The
 army and the columns must each run a wall bulletin, to be handled by the
 propaganda section of the political department and named "Current Affairs
 Brief Report."  The contents are:   (1)   International and domestic political
 news; (2) the mass struggle situation of guerrilla areas; (3) the work condi-
 tion of the Red Army.   There must be at least one issue a week, written on
 large pieces of paper, not mimeographed, in as many copies as possible.
 Attention must be given to the following:   (1) The production must be prompt;.
 (2) the contents must be rich; and (3) the calligraphy should be fairly large
 and clear.
 d.   The various political departments must collect and compile revolution-
 ary songs expressing the sentiments of the masses, and the editing and com-
 piling committee of the army political department has the responsibility
 of supervision and inspection.
 e.   The art unit of the propaganda section of the army political depart-
 ment must be reenforced.   It must publish lithographed or mimeographed
 pictorials.   To reenforce the military art unit, all those with talent in
 painting and drawing in the army must be gathered together.

 f.   Costumed propaganda is one of the most concrete and effective means of
 propaganda.  All the propaganda teams of the detachments and directly sub-
 ordinate units must organize costumed propaganda subunits, responsible for
 creating and directing costumed propaganda to the masses.
 g.   Take each battalion as a unit, clubs must be organized in the soldiers'
 associations.
 h.   Verbal and written propaganda subunits must be organized in the pro-
 paganda teams, for the purpose of studying and directing verbal and written
 propaganda techniques.
 i.   The three disciplinary rules must be strictly enforced.
 j.   The political departments and the propaganda teams must, with organi-
 zation and planning, call all types of mass meetings.   They must decide in
 advance the order of meeting, the speakers, the topics and the time.
 k.   Propaganda aimed at the soldiers and lower level officers of the White
 army is extremely important.  Attention must be given to the following
 methods hereafter:
 (1)   The text of the propaganda must be short and concise, so that it
 can be read at a glance.   It must be skillful and clever, so that it will
 leave an impression.
 (2)   Besides systematically displaying many.slogans appropriate to the
 particular units along the road traveled by the enemy, handbills must be
 stored with the party units and mass organizations along the road, so that
 they can be ingeniously distributed when the enemy soldiers pass through.
 (3)   The names of the enemy officers and soldiers and the identity of
 their unit must be ascertained from the captives and through mail inspection,
 so that propaganda material or letters can be sent to them.
 (4)   Preferential treatment of captives is an effective method of pro-
 pagandizing to the enemy force.   Preferential treatment includes the following
 methods:     The first is to refrain from searching them for money and things.
 In the past, the conduct of the Red Army soldiers of searching captives for
 money and things must be firmly stopped. The second is to welcome captives
 with great warmth, so that they will feel a spiritual happiness.   Insulting
 them by word or deed must be opposed.   The third is equal material treatment
 of the captives, same as the old soldiers.   Fourth, after propaganda, those
 who do not wish to remain will be issued travel expenses and released for
 them to return home, so that they will spread the influence of the Red Army
 in the White army.   Forcing the unwilling ones to remain just to satisfy
 the desire for more soldiers must be opposed.   Except under special conditions,
 the above are suitable for all captured officers and soldiers alike.

 (5) Giving medical attention to the.enemy wounded is also an effective
 method of propaganda.  The medical treatment and monetary allowances to wounded
 enemy soldiers must be exactly the same as wounded Red Army soldiers.   All
 possible opportunities must be utilized to return wounded enemy soldiers who
 have received medical attention and monetary allowances, to the enemy army.
 This principle applies to wounded enemy officers.
 V.  Political Training of Soldiers

 1.  Political classes;
 a.   Political classes are divided into regular, special and cadre
 classes.        Regular classes are further divided into two types:  When a detach-
 ment is, together, classes are held with each detachment as a unit.   For
 instructors, the detachment political commissar serves as the instructor
 in charge, and battalion political commissars are responsible for the various
 subjects separately.   Besides combat soldiers who are required to attend,
 messengers, orderlies, porters, grooms and cooks must all attend.   The goal
 of the regular class is basic political knowledge for soldiers in general.
 b.  With each detachment as a unit, the special class, through selec-
 tion and examination, consists of 50 soldiers from the battalions who can

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 read some and have some political knowledge.   The detachment political commis-
 sar serves as the instructor in charge, and the battalion political commissars
 are responsible for the various subjects separately.   The goal of the special
 class is to create personnel with political knowledge one level higher than
 the regular class, in preparation for promotion to lower level cadres in
 the future.
 c.   The column is the unit for the cadre class, and the directly sub-
 ordinate unit of the army forms another unit, organized with battalion
 commanders and deputy commanders, company commanders and deputy commanders,
 military aides of the various levels, and other designated personnel.   The
 goal is to raise the political level of the current lower level cadres, so
 that they can lead the masses, in preparation for promotion to middle level
 cadres in the future.   The political commissar, political department chairman,
 and commander of the column and others with suitable qualifications serve
 as the instructors.
 d.   The political. training committee must be organized with each detach-
 ment as a unit, to include the political committee members of the detachment
 and qualified military officers.   The detachment political commisssar serves
 as chairman.   The function of the committee is to discuss the various problems
 on the political training of the soldiers in the detachment.
 e.   The political training of the directly subordinate units of the army
 and columns is handled by the political training committee organized by the
 political propaganda sections of the army and columns.

 youth literacy texts (using the Commercial Press elementary school texts,
 People's 1,000-word Vocabulary text and Lung-yen Cultural Press texts as
 references).
 B.   Each column must organize a youth soldiers' school, divided into three
 or four classes, one class for each detachment and one for each directly
 subordinate unit, with a maximum of 25 students per class.   The chairman of
 the political department serves as the principal and the propaganda section
 chief as the dean.   Each class has an instructor in charge.   One semester
 consists of 90 hours.
 C.   Stationeries are paid by public funds and distributed to the students.
 VII.   Abolition of Corporal Punishment
 A.   The Effect of Corporal Punishment in the Red Army
 In the units where corporal punishment is more severe, there are more' dis-
 satisfied soldiers and deserters.   There were the following most apparent
 instances:  A certain officer of the 8th detachment of the 3d column liked
 to punish by flogging.   As a result, not only almost all the messengers and
 cooks, but even the supply sergeant and aides, fled.   During. one period,
 a battalion commander who liked to flog people was assigned to the 25th bat-
 talion of-the 9th detachment.   The masses nicknamed him "Ironsmith."  In
 consequence, the soldiers felt hopeless and utterly dissatisfied.  They only
 became liberated when the commander was transferred.   The result of flogging
 in the 3d battalion of the special service detachment was the desertion of
 4 cooks, 1 special service chief and 2 squad leaders who had struggled for
 a long time.   One of them, Hsiao Wen-ch'eng [5618 2429 2052], left a letter,
 explaining that he was not counterrevolutionary, but deserted because he
 could not stand the oppression.  When the 4th column was first organized, the
 officers transferred from the 1st, 2d and 3d columns beat the soldiers
 savagely.   As a result, the soldiers deserted one after another.   Finally,
 this group of officers themselves could not stand their ground, and they
 had to leave the 4th column.   The 2d column has more deserters than any
 other column.,  Though there are many reasons, the habit of flogging inten-
 sively practiced by its lower level officers is one of the most important
 ones.   There were three suicide incidents in the 2d column (1 platoon
 leader and 2 soldiers).   This is the biggest stigma of the Red Army, and the
 significance is extremely serious.   It cannot but be considered an outcome
 of flogging practiced intensively in the 2d column.   Currently, the outcry
 of the common soldiers in the Red Army is:   "Officers do not beat the
 soldiers; they merely flog them to near death!"   Such expression of the
 indignation and wrath; of the masses truly deserves our serious attention.

 B.   The Origin of Corporal Punishment and the Reason for Its Abolition
 To maintain its exploitation, the feudal class had to resort to the most cruel
 punishment as a tool, in order to suppress the resistance and revolt of the
 exploited. This was the reason that corporal punishment was created in the
 feudal era.  When economic development progressed to the capitalist system,
 it became necessary to introduce liberalism in order to encourage the
 individuality of the worker-peasant masses, enhance their labor and fighting
 capacities, and create the conditions for the development of capitalism.
 Therefore, the bourgeois nations generally have abolished corporal punish-
 ment, and the monstrosity of flogging has disappeared in the troops.  When
 the economic development reached the stage of socialism, with the aggravation
 of the class struggle, the worker-peasant class, for the purpose of over-
 throwing the power of the ruling class and eliminating the exploitation based
 on such power, must activate the strength of the broad masses of its own
 class before it can win the victory of the struggle.   The soviet political
 power is the political power of the most progressive class, and no remnant
 of the feudal system may exist under it..  Therefore, in Soviet Russia,
 corporal punishment is not only no longer in existence in its Red Army, but
 the use of corporal punishment is strictly prohibited in its laws in general.
 The Red 4th Army was created in a China where the feudal system had not been
 completely eliminated, and its.main components mostly came from the troops
 of the feudal warlords.   The thinking and habits of the feudal system remain
 strong in the officers and soldiers in general, and therefore, the habit of
 flogging and the saying of "no fear without flogging" are the same.as in the
 troops of the feudal warlords.   Though the slogan that the officers must not
 beat the soldiers and the provision that the soldiers have the right to
 express their grievances have long been proposed, they are not effective at
 all, resulting in the alienation between the officers and soldiers, the low
 morale of the officers as well as the soldiers, the growing number of
 deserters, the atmosphere of dissatisfaction in the troops, and even inci-
 dents of suicide.   This situation is completely contrary to the fighting tasks
 of the Red Army.   If it is not promptly rectified, the danger is beyond
 description.
 C.   Methods of Rectification
 1.   Firmly abolish corporal punishment.
 2.   Launch a movement to abolish corporal punishment.   This campaign must aim
 at both the officers and the soldiers, and spread the meaning that "only the
 abolition of corporal punishment will benefit the struggle" generally in the
 officer and soldier masses.   Only then will the officers realize that the
 abolition of corporal punishment not only will not make it impossible for
 them to command the troops, but will benefit management and training.   On the
 part of the soldiers, not only will they not become more intractable, but,
 because of the abolition of corporal punishment, they will enhance their
 fighting morale.  With the disappearance of the alienation between the
 officers and soldiers, they will consciously accept control, training and
 general discipline.

 3.   After corporal punishment is abolished, certain temporary undesirable
 phenomena may appear due to historical reasons.   But the situation will only
 serve to intensify our responsibilities.  We must vigorously promote the
 spirit of persuasion and the conscious observance of discipline to overcome
 the most evil feudal system contrary to the struggle tasks.  We must never
 use the undesirable phenomena as an excuse to defend the practice of flogging.
 All those opposing the abolition of corporal punishment under the excuse of
 the temporary undesirable phenomena, or slacking off on the movement to
 abolish corporal punishment, are objectively blocking the development of
 the revolutionary struggle and thereby helping the ruling class.
 4.   The legal procedure to abolish corporal punishment in the Red Army is:
 a.   The penal regulations of the Red Army must be revised.  b.   The supreme
 military and political organs' conference must jointly issue a general order
 abolishing corporal punishment and promulgate the new penal regulations of the
 Red Army.  c.  After the general order is issued, the military and political
 organs must call a meeting of officers to explain in detail the reasons for
 abolishing corporal punishment, so that they will support the momentous
 reform embodied in the general order and implement it diligently in the
 troops.   d.  Meanwhile, the soldiers' council must call a meeting of soldier
 delegates, explaining that, besides supporting the reform, they must hereafter
 consciously observe discipline and make stringent mass disciplinary sanctions,
 in order to obtain the desired result of abolishing corporal punishment.
 VIII.   Preferential Treatment of Wounded Soldiers
 A.   The Misery of the Wounded and the Sick and Its Influence
 1.   The health organs of the various units are unsound.  Medical officers,
 drugs and stretcher facilities are inadequate, and the personnel are insuf-
 ficient and not well organized.   Therefore, many wounded and sick soldiers
 sometimes cannot even obtain basic care let alone full treatment.
 2.   The military and political organs of the army do not give sufficient
 attention to the wounded and the sick. For instance:   a.   In regard to the
 soundness of the health organs, the authorities have not only failed to
 make maximum effort, but actually paid no attention to it.   The issue of
 health is rarely discussed at the various meetings..   b.   The officers are not
 doing all they can to comfort the wounded and the sick.     Such practice as
 bringing tea to the patients, covering them at night, and visiting them are
 almost.nonexistent in the Red Army.   The officers take the attitude of
 indifference, or they even find the patients annoying.   c. When marching,
 the officers, and even the soldiers, show no sympathy toward the wounded
 dropping out of rank, refusing to help them, cursing them or driving them
 on ruthlessly.
 3.   The seriously wounded and sick do not have adequate supplies and
 allowances.  Wounded soldiers do not have a change of clothes 7 or 8 days
 after being wounded.   Sick officers receive recuperation allowances, but not
 the sick soldiers.

 4.   The defects of Chiao-yang Hospital are:   a.   Being disorganized.
 b.   Shortage of medical officers and drugs.   C.   Medical officers selling
 private medicine.   d.   Lack of cleanliness.  e.   Inadequate cold weather.
 clothing and bedding.    f.   Shortage of medical attendants.   g.   Inferior
 food.   h. Cramped quarters.   i.   Bad relationship with the local people.
 As a result, the wounded and the sick regard the hospital as a jail and are
 unwilling to remain in the rear.
 The ill treatment of wounded and sick soldiers has produced the following
 effect:   a. The soldiers become dissatisfied with the Red Army.       "While
 the Red Army is good, one must not become wounded or sick."  Such opinion
 is widespread among all soldiers and the lower level officers.  b.   The
 dissatisfaction of the soldiers and the officers further aggravates the
 alienation between the officers and soldiers.   c.   The soldiers and lower
 level officers are afraid of being wounded.   Therefore, the combat power
 of the Red Army is reduced.   d.   There are many deserters.   e. The worker-
 peasant masses are less eager to join the Red Army.
 B.   Methods of Rectification
 1.   The military and political organs must not remain indifferent to the
 issue of health.   It must be fully discussed at the various meetings.
 2.   The organization of the health units must be improved.    Qualified person-
 nel must be assigned to work in such units, instead of packing all those not
 needed elsewhere into the medical teams.   Moreover, the personnel must be
 increased, so that the patients will have adequate attention.   The shortages
 of physicians and drugs must be remedied. wherever possible.   In regard to
 physicians, they must be urged to be more careful in diagnosing,'instead
 of being so indifferent.
 3.   Officers, especially company officers in contact with the soldiers, must
 visit the patients from time to time, bring them tea, and cover them up at
 night.   If the patients are cold, the officers must find the means to help
 them, such as borrowing from others, or putting more clothes on them. Such
 means of caring for the patients must be made into a system, followed by
 everyone, because it is the best way to win the masses.
 4.   In regard to the wounded dropping out of rank when marching:   a. No one
 is permitted to revile or ridicule them.   b. When. the wounded or sick are
 required to yield the way, they must be asked politely, instead of being
 pushed aside'roughly.   c. Regardless of which unit or organ, whenever a
 soldier drops out of rank due to injury or illness, be he a combatant or
 noncombatant, someone must be immediately assigned to look after him.   If
 the injury or illness is serious, all means must be exhausted to have him
 carried.   d. When marching, the rear guard must patiently help the wounded
 and the sick who are out of rank, and carry their weapons for them when
 necessary.

 5.   Allowances for incidental expenses must be issued to the patients.   Those
 seriously wounded or ill must receive more than those not seriously wounded
 or ill.   In regard to those extremely sick or wounded, appropriate recuperation
 allowances must be issued without distinction of officer or soldier.
 6.   In regard to the clothing and bedding of the patients, while the army must
 do its best to provide them, donations must be solicited among the officers
 and soldiers of all the units.   It will not only increase the incidental
 allowances of the patients, but also serve as a good means to stimulate the
 spirit of mutual help in times of need.
 7.   The many defects of the Chiao-yang Rear Hospital must be rectified
 systematically.   In addition, a campaign for donations (clothing, bedding,
 cash, grain) must be launched among the worker-peasant masses in western
 Fukien, in order to bring closer the relationship between the worker-peasant
 masses and the Red Army.
 IX.  The Relationship Between the Military and the Political Commands of the
 Red Army
 A.   Before the high level local political organ is organized, the political
 and military organs of the Red Army, under the leadership of the Front
 Committee, perform their work in a parallel manner.
 B.   The Relationship Between the Red Army and the Masses
 1.   In all matters affecting the entire army, such as the promulgation of
 political programs, the military and political commands will promulgate
 them jointly.
 2.   Before the local political organ is organized, the direction and super-
 vision of mass work, such as propagandizing to the masses, organizing the
 masses, building political power, down to confiscation, trial, punishment,
 soliciting donations, raising funds, and relief, are the functions of the
 political department.
 3.   In all areas where an administrative organ has not yet been set up, the
 Red Army political department serves in its place, until the time when it is.
 In all areas where it has been set up, the principle that the local administra-
 tive organ handles all matters independently in order to gain the confidence
 of the masses must be followed.   Only when the local administrative organ
 is not yet soundly established, in matters concerning the Red Army and the
 local area, the method of joint handling by the local administrative organ
 and the Red Army political department may be resorted to.
 4.   Helping the local militia stabilize and develop  is the responsibility
 of the political department; helping it in peacetime military training and
 wartime combat direction  is the responsibility of Headquarters.   Nevertheless,
 whenever possible, it should be done through the local administrative organ,
 and direct handling should be avoided as much as possible.

 C.   In regard to the personnel and administration of the Red Army, the military
 and political commands each has its independent line.   In matters concerning
 both, such as mutual transfers of personnel, mutual transmission of informa-
 tion, etc., they are handled through official communications.
 D.   In regard to etiquette and discipline, the military and political commands
 follow the principle of class subordination.   There must be no disrespect or
 insubordination on ground of different commands.
 E.   In regard to supplies, health, marching,. combat and encampment, the poli-
 tical command must accept the direction of the military command.   In regard
 to political training and mass work, the reverse is true.   But such direction
 can only be issued to the subordinate organs (general affairs section or the
 adjutant section) of the other command.
 F.   The direction of matters relating to Red Army fund raising and the
 decision and disbursement of political work allocations are to be made by
 the political department, and the military affairs organs may not interfere.
 (Funds are drawn directly from the quartermaster's office by the political
 department.)   Allocations to the party units are made by the political depart-
 ment.
 G.   All orders of the military affairs organ, except those which have to be
 cosigned by the political commissar, require no endorsement by the political
 department director.   All orders of the political organs are singly handled
 by the political department without having to be endorsed by the political
 commissar.
 Editor's note:   This document is one of the earliest and most important re-
 cords written by Comrade Mao Tse-tung on the army and party building of the
 Chinese Communist Party.   Its standpoint and basic content are completely
 applicable today.   The many kinds of non-proletarian biases, i.e., manifesta-
 tions of warlordist and petty bourgeois biases, pointed in the first part
 of the resolution are the fundamental problems of the 8th Route Army and New
 4th Army today as well as the Red Army at that time. Our troops exist for
 the people; therefore, the three great missions of the Red Army at that time
 were "fighting," "raising funds," and "doing mass work."  This document is
 extremely forceful on the mass work viewpoint of the Red Army.   Today's
 8th Route Army and New 4th Army still have three great missions, except
 that "fund raising" has been developed to "production."  The decisions on
 abolishing corporal punishment (not beating people) and the propaganda and
 education work of the troops in this document deserve our serious attention
 today. In general, as our troops are founded on peasants and other petty
 bourgeois elements and situated in an environment of prolonged dispersed
 rural guerrilla warfare and in the midst of mercenaries and counterrevolu-
 tionary enemies, such counterrevolutionary enemies, traitors and secret
 service agents, old army officers, war prisoners, lumpen proletarians, old
 peasants, petty bourgeois intellectuals, and the various dogmatist and

 sectarianist factors corrode us from the inside as well as the outside.   There-
 fore, to make our troops truly into the troops completely belonging to the
 people under the leadership of the proletarian ideology, we must wage a con-
 stant anti-bias struggle.   Currently, ours are the best troops in the nation
 supported by the people.  There has been a ,great improvement since 1929.
 However, in recent years, certain defects still remain in the relations between
 the army and the party and government, between the. troops and the people,
 between the officers and the soldiers, between the lower and higher levels,
 between military affairs and political work cadres, and among military units.
 The main ones among the defects are the warlordist biases of severance from
 the masses and require the intensive examination and rectification by our
 military affairs and political work cadres in the rectification movement and
 the support-government-and-love-people movement.  Meanwhile, this document
 starts from the masses and gives considerations to the civilian and soldier
 masses everywhere.   Therefore, it furnishes us with an effective weapon
 on this point.   In the political education of our troops, this document was
 not publicized for many years, and, when it was publicized, it was not used
 to launch self-criticism, thereby re-committing an error long solved by this
 document.   This is one loss.   Now, the Central has decided to make this
 resolution a document for the rectification of the military cadres and a text
 for the education of the entire army.

 LETTER TO COMRADE LIN PIAO
 5 January 1930
 [Text]   Comrade Lin Piao:
 The new year has been here several days, but I have not yet replied to your
 letter.   First, because I have some business which keeps me busy.   Second,
 because after all, what could I write to you about?  What was there that
 was good which I could offer you?  I cudgeled my brains, but could not think
 of anything suitable.  Hence the delay.  Now I have thought of something.
 I do not know whether it is appropriate after all to your situation, but
 this matter of mine is in fact an important question in the present struggle.
 Even if it is not appropriate to your individual situation, it is nevertheless
 an important question.   Hence I bring it up.
 What is the question that I am going to bring up?  It is a question of appraisal
 of the current situation and our actions ensuing from it.   I used to feel in
 the past and still feel that your appraisal of the current situation has been
 relatively pessimistic.  This view of yours was most apparent at the con-
 ference in Jui-chin on the evening of 18 May last year.   I knew that you
 believed that a revolutionary upsurge would come inevitably, but you did not
 believe it possible that it would come soon, so you disapproved of action on
 the plan to seize Kiangsi within a year and favored only guerrilla activities
 in the three border areas between Fukien, Kwangtung and Kiangsi; and as you
 had no profound notion about establishing a Red political power in these three
 areas, you had no profound notion of promoting a nationwide revolutionary up-
 surge through intensification and expansion of this Red political power.  Since
 you believe in the XXX-style policy of mobile guerrilla warfare, you seem to
 think that, since the revolutionary upsurge is still far away, it will be
 labor lost to attempt to build up-our political power by hard work.   Instead,
 you want to extend our political influence by lighter, mobile guerrilla means
 and, when the masses throughout the country have been won over, or won over to
 a certain degree, to launch a nationwide uprising which, with the forces of
 the Red Army thrown in, would become a great, nationwide revolution.  Your
 theory of first winning over the masses and then establishing political power
 on a nationwide scale, including all regions, is in my view not suitable to

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 the Chinese revolution.   According to my observation, this theory of yours
 stems mainly from your failure to understand clearly that China is a semi-
 colony contended for by many imperialist powers.   If you clearly understand
 this, then first, you will understand why in China alone in the world there
 is such an unusual thing as a prolonged strife within the ruling classes,
 why the fight intensifies and expands day by day, and why no unified political
 power has ever come into being.   Second, you will understand how important the
 peasant problem is, and consequently why rural uprisings have developed on
 such a nationwide scale as at present.   Third, you will understand the
 absolute correctness of the slogan of a workers' and peasants' democratic
 political power.   Fourth, you will understand another unusual thing which
 corresponds to and arises out of the first that only in China is there a
 prolonged strife within the ruling classes, and that is the existence and
 development of the Red Army and guerrilla troops, and, together with them, the
 existence and development of small Red areas (soviets) that have grown amid
 the encirclement of the White political power (no such unusual thing is found
 anywhere. except in China).   Fifth, you will also understand that the formation
 and development of the Red Army, the guerrilla units and the soviet areas is
 the highest form of peasant struggle in a semi-colony, a form which peasant
 struggle in a semi-colony will inevitably take.   Sixth, you will understand
 that they. (the Red Army and peasants' soviets) undoubtedly are the most
 important allied forces (which the proletariat must come forward to lead) of
 the struggle of the, proletariat in a semi-colony, and that undoubtedly they
 are an important factor in accelerating the revolutionary upsurge throughout
 the country.   Seventh, you will understand that the policy of purely mobile
 guerrilla activities cannot accomplish the task of accelerating the nation-
 wide revolutionary upsurge, while the kind of policy adopted by Chu [Teh]-
 Mao [Tse-tung], Ho Lung, Li Wen-lin and Fang Chih-min is undoubtedly correct--
 policy such as establishing base areas, building up political power according
 to plan, close cooperation between Red Army guerrillas and the broad peasant
 masses, their organization and training in struggle, deepening of the agrarian
 revolution, expanding armed forces by developing first township uprising forces,
 then district Red Guards, then county Red Guards, then local Red Army units,
 all the way up to the regular Red Army, and expanding political power by
 advancing in a series of waves.   Only thus can we win the confidence of the
 revolutionary masses throughout the country, just as the Soviet Union has
 done throughout the world.   Only thus can we create tremendous difficulties
 for the reactionary ruling classes, shake their very foundations and precipi-
 tate their internal disintegration.   And only thus can we really create a
 Red Army that will be one of our important instruments in the coming great
 revolution.   In short, only thus can we accelerate the revolutionary upsurge.
 I wish to speak once'more now about the reason why you make a relatively
 pessimistic--to my way of thinking--appraisal of the current situation.
 Your appraisal, I think, is exactly the opposite of that made by a group
 in the party who suffer from revolutionary impetuosity.   Comrades who suffer
 from this malady unduly overestimate the subjective forces of the revolution
 and underestimate the objective forces.   Such an appraisal stems largely from
 subjectivism.   In the end, it will undoubtedly lead to the path of adventurism.

 You have not made such a mistake.   But you seem to have a fault in another
 respect, and that is, you underestimate somewhat the subjective forces and
 overestimate somewhat the objective forces.   This is also an inappropriate
 appraisal and will inevitably produce another kind of bad result.  You admit
 the weakness of the subjective forces and the strength of the objective
 forces, but you do not seem to understand the following important features:
 1.   Although the subjective forces of the revolution in China are weak, so
 are all organs (government, armed forces, parties, organizations, etc.) of
 the ruling classes with their foothold on the backward and fragile social
 and economic structure of China.  This explains why revolution cannot break
 out at present in the countries of Western Europe where, although the subjec-
 tive forces of revolution are much stronger than those in China, the forces
 of the ruling classes there are also many times stronger than those in our
 country.   The subjective forces of the revolution in China are weak, but be-
 cause the objective forces are also weak, the revolution will certainly
 move toward an upsurge more quickly in China than in Western Europe.
 2.   Since the defeat of the Great Revolution, the subjective forces of revolu-
 tion have indeed been greatly weakened.   The force that remains is to all
 appearances very small and this naturally makes some comrades (who judge by
 appearances) feel pessimistic.   But it is a quite different thing if we
 look into the essence of the matter.   Here the old Chinese proverb, "A.single
 spark can start a prairie fire," is applicable.   In other words, although
 the force is only a small one at present, it will rapidly develop.   In China,
 as things stand, its development is not merely a possibility but a necessity.
 This was fully proved in the 30 May Movement and the Great Revolutionary
 Movement which followed.   In studying an event, we must examine its essence
 and treat its appearance merely as a guide to the threshold of the essence.
 Once we have crossed the threshold, we must grasp the essence and put aside
 the appearance that serves as the guide.   This alone is the reliable and
 scientific method of analysis which has revolutionary significance.
 3.   Similarly, in estimating the objective forces, we must never look merely
 at their appearance, but must study their essence.   In the early period of our
 independent regime on the Hunan-Kiangsi border, a small number of comrades
 seriously believed in the incorrect appraisal made by the Hunan Provincial
 Party Committee of that time and regarded our class enemy as not worth a rap.
 The two phrases, "extremely.s.haky" and "exceedingly panicky," which have been
 passed on as standing jokes even to this day, were precisely the description
 used at that time (from May to June 1928) by the Hunan Provincial Party
 Committee in sizing up Lu-Ti-p'ing, the ruler of Hunan._  Political adventurism
 necessarily ensued from such an appraisal.   But during the approximately
 4 months from November 1928 to February 1929 (before the war between Chiang
 Kai-shek and the Kwangsi warlords broke out), when the largest third joint
 expedition pressed forward to Ching-kang Mountains, a section of comrades
 raised the question, "How long can the Red flag be kept flying?"  As a
 matter of fact, the, struggle in China between Britain,. the United States
 and Japan had by then become quite open, and the situation was taking shape
 for a fight between Chiang Kai-shek, Feng Yu-hsiang and the Kwangsi warlords.

 In reality it was just the time when the counterrevolutionary tide began to
 ebb and the revolutionary tide to rise again..   But during this very period
 not only was a pessimistic view found in the Red Army and local party
 organizations, but the party center was more or less perplexed by surface
 conditions and became pessimistic in its tone.   The February. letter from the
 Central Committee furnished proof of the pessimism shown by the party in its
 analysis at that time.
 4.   The present objective situation may still easily perplex those comrades
 who observe only the appearance of the existing conditions but not their
 essence.   Those of us working in the Red Army, especially when defeated in
 battle, encircled on all sides or pursued by strong enemy forces, often un-
 wittingly universalize and magnify what after all are only momentary, parti-
 cular and local conditions, as if the whole situation in China and throughout
 the world was dark and gloomy, and the prospect of victory of the revolution
 dim and remote.   They neglect the essence in making such an observation
 because they have not made a scientific analysis of the general situation.
 If it is asked whether the revolutionary upsurge will arise soon in China,
 we can give a definite answer only after studying carefully whether the
 contradictions leading to the revolutionary upsurge are really developing.
 Since contradictions are developing internationally between the imperialist
 countries, between the imperialist countries and their colonies, and between
 imperialism and the proletariat in these countries, the imperialists feel all
 the more urgently the need to contend for China.   As the imperialists' conten-
 tion for China intensifies, both the contradiction between the imperialist
 powers and the whole Chinese nation and the contradiction among the
 imperialists themselves develop simultaneously in China, a daily expanding
 and intensifying strife thus ensues between the various cliques of rulers
 in China and the contradictions between them develop daily.   From these
 contradictions between the various cliques of rulers--the strife between the
 warlords--ensues an increase of taxation; thus the development of the contra-
 diction between the broad masses of taxpayers and the rulers is accelerated
 with every passing day.   From the contradiction between imperialism and
 Chinese capitalism, that is, the failure of the Chinese bourgeoisie to
 obtain concessions from imperialism, ensues an immediate intensification of
 the contradiction between China's bourgeoisie and the Chinese working class:
 the Chinese bourgeoisie must now intensity their exploitation of the working
 class.   From the imperialist commodity aggression, the inroads made by Chinese
 merchant capital, and increase of taxation by the government--all of which
 are contradictory to the interests of the landlord class, ensues the sharpen-
 ing of the contradiction between the landlords and the peasants, that is,
 exploitation by landlords in the form of rent and usury becomes heavier.
 Because of the pressure of foreign goods, the exhaustion of the purchasing
 power of the broad masses of workers and peasants, and increase of taxation
 by the government, dealers in domestic products and independent small
 producers are forced daily further on the road to bankruptcy.   Because of the
 unrestricted expansion of [government] troops without sufficient provisions
 and funds to support them and the steady spread of war, the masses of soldiers
 constantly find themselves suffering from cold, hunger, exhaustion and

 casualties.    Because of the increase of taxation by the government, the
 mounting burden of rent and interest demanded by landlords, and the daily
 extension of the horrors of war, which leads to widespread famine and banditry
 throughout the country, the broad masses of peasants and the urban poor are
 brought to such a pass that they can hardly survive.   Because funds are lack-
 ing for keeping schools open, many students are worried that they may not be
 able to continue their education.   Because of the backwardness of production,
 graduates have little hope of obtaining employment.   Once we understand all
 these contradictions, we shall see how desperately precarious the situation
 is, and how chaotic the state in which China finds herself.  We shall also
 see how inevitably and soon the revolutionary upsurge against the imperialists.,
 the warlords and the landlords will arise.   China is littered all over with
 dry firewood which will soon be kindled and become a conflagration.   The
 proverb, "A single spark can start a prairie fire," appropriately describes
 how the current situation will develop.  We need only look at the nationwide
 development of.workers' strikes, peasant uprisings, soldiers' mutinies, and
 strikes by merchants and students to see that it is no longer merely "sparks"
 but will undoubtedly not take long for these "sparks" to become "a prairie
 fire."
 The gist of what is said above was given in a letter from the Front Committee
 to the Central Committee, dated 5 April 1929.   It reads in part:
 "The letter of the Central Committee (dated 9 February last year) gives too
 pessimistic an appraisal of the objective situation and our subjective forces.
 The [Kuomintang's] three campaigns of 'encirclement' against the Ching-kang
 Mountains marked the height of the counterrevolutionary tide.   But there it
 stopped, and since then the counterrevolutionary tide has gradually receded
 while the revolutionary tide has been gradually rising.    Although our party's
 fighting capacity and organizational strength have been weakened even to the
 extent described by the Central Committee, they will recover rapidly with the
 gradual ebbing of the counterrevolutionary tide and passivity among cadres
 in the party will also soon disappear.   The masses will certainly come over
 to us.   For not only has the [government] policy of massacre been 'driving
 the fish into deep water' but even reformism no longer appeals to the masses.
 It is certain that the illusions of the masses about the Kuomintang will
 quickly evaporate.   In the situation that will arise, no party can compete
 with the Communist Party in winning over the masses.   The political line and
 the organizational line laid down by the Party's 6th National Congress are
 quite correct:   the revolution at the present stage is democratic and not
 socialist; the immediate task of the party is to win over the masses and not
 to stage immediate uprisings.   But the revolution will rapidly develop,
 and in making propaganda and preparations for armed uprisings, a positive
 attitude should be adopted.   In the great chaos of the current situation,
 only by putting forward positive slogans and by taking a positive attitude
 can we lead the masses.   It is also certain that only by adopting such a
 positive attitude can the party recover its fighting capacity.  We think that
 the party made a putschist mistake before, but that in some respects it now
 has a tendency toward abolitionism....   Proletarian leadership is the sole
 key to the victory of the revolution.   The laying of the party's proletarian
 basis and establishment of the party branches in industrial enterprises in

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 key districts are the important organizational tasks of the party at present.
 But at the same time the development of struggles in the countryside, the
 establishment of Red political power in small areas, and creation and expan-
 sion of the Red Army are also main conditions for helping the struggle in the
 cities and accelerating the revolutionary upsurge.   Therefore, it is the
 biggest mistake to abandon the struggle in cities and be immersed in guerrilla
 activities in rural areas.   But in our opinion it is also a mistake for any of
 our party members to fear the development of the power of the peasants lest
 it become stronger than that of the workers and hence detrimental to the
 revolution.   For the revolution in semi-colonial China will fail only if the
 peasant struggle is deprived of the leadership of the workers, and it will
 never suffer just because the peasants, through their struggle, become more
 powerful than the workers."
 The letter also contains the following reply to the question of the Red Army's
 line of action:
 "To preserve the Red Army and arouse the masses, the Central Committee wants
 us to divide up our forces into very small units and disperse them widely
 over the countryside, and that Chu Teh and Mao Tse-tung leave the ranks so
 that the major targets will be hidden from the enemy.   This is an idealistic
 way of thinking.   To divide up our forces into company or battalion-size
 units, each operating on its own; to disperse them widely over the country-
 side; to arouse the masses through guerrilla activities; and to avoid becoming
 the enemy's target--all these we planned and tried on numerous occasions ever
 since the winter of 1927, but they all proved failures.   The reasons are:
 (1)  Most of the soldiers in the main force of the Red Army came from the
 outside and are different from the local Red guardsmen in their origin,
 (2) With small dispersed units, the leadership will become so weak as to be
 unable to cope with adverse circumstances, hence we shall be liable to suffer
 defeat.   (3)   Small units are easy for the enemy to crush separately.   (.4)   The
 more adverse the circumstances, the greater becomes the need for the forces
 tc be concentrated and for the leadership to conduct resolute struggle, for
 only thus.can we achieve internal unity against the enemy.   Only in favorable.
 circumstances can the forces be divided for guerrilla operations, and it is
 only then that the leaders need not stay with the ranks all the time, as they
 must do in adverse circumstances..."
 The defect of this passage is that the reasons given against the division of
 forces are of a negative character, and that is far from adequate.   The posi-
 tive reason for concentrating our forces is this:   only concentration will
 enable us to wipe out comparatively large enemy units and occupy cities.
 Only after wiping out comparatively large enemy units and occupying cities
 can we arouse the masses on a large scale and build up a unified political
 power over a number of adjoining counties.   Only thus can we arouse the
 attention of the people far and near (i.e., "expanding our political influence"),
 and make a material contribution toward accelerating the revolutionary upsurge.
 For instance, both the regime we created on the Hunan-Kiangsi border in the
 year before last and that created in western Fukien last year were the result

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 of our policy of concentrating the troops.   This is the general principle.
 Are there, however, not times when the forces should be divided up?  Yes,
 there are.  The letter to the Central Committee from the Front Committee
 speaks of the Red Army's guerrilla tactics, including the division of forces
 within a short radius:
 "The tactics we have worked out during the last 3 years in the course of the
 struggle are indeed different from any employed in ancient or modern times,
 in China or elsewhere.   With our tactics, the struggles of the masses are  .
 daily expanding and no enemy, however powerful, can cope with us.   Ours are
 guerrilla tactics.   They consist mainly of the following points:   "Disperse
 the forces to arouse the masses and concentrate the forces to deal with the
 enemy."  "The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy halts, we harass; the enemy
 tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue."  "In an independent regime
 with stabilized territory, we adopt the policy of advancing in a series of
 waves.  When pursued by a powerful enemy, we adopt the policy of circling
 around in a whirling motion."  "Arouse the largest number of the masses in the
 shortest possible time and by the best possible method."  These tactics are
 just like casting a net.  We should be able to cast the net wide or draw it
 in at any moment.  We cast it wide to win over the masses and draw it in to
 deal with the enemy.  Such are the tactics we have applied in the past 3 years."
 Here, "to cast the net wide" means to divide up our forces for a short term.
 For example, when we first captured the county town of Yung-hsin on the
 Hunan-Kiangsi border, we divided up the 29th and 31st Regiments within the
 boundaries of Yung-hsin.   Again, when we captured for. the third time the
 county town of Yung-hsin, we divided our forces by dispatching the 28th Regi-
 ment to the border of An-fu, the 29th to Lien-hua and the 31st to the border
 of Chi-an County.   And again, in April. and May last year our troops were
 divided up in the counties of southern Kiangsi, and in July they were divided
 up in the counties of western Fukien.   All these were appropriate examples.
 As to the dispersion of forces over a wide area, this is possible only under
 two conditions:  when circumstances are comparatively favorable and when the
 leading body is comparatively sound.   For the aim of dividing up our forces
 is to render ourselves more capable of winning over the masses, of deepening
 the agrarian revolution and establishing political power, and of expanding
 the Red Army and the local armed forces.   It is better not to divide up the
 forces if it is impossible to attain these aims, or if division of forces
 could only lead to defeat and a weakening of the Red Army, as in August of
 the year before last when our forces were divided up on the Hunan-Kiangsi
 border for an attack on Ch'en-chou.   If the two above-mentioned conditions
 are present, we should undoubtedly divide up the forces, because then
 division will be more advantageous than concentration.   As for the division
 of forces under emergency circumstances to.preserve our strength and avoid
 concentration of target for the enemy, I am opposed to that in principle.
 This is made clear in the letter from the Front Committee to the Central
 Committee quoted above.   In addition, will there be a time when work should
 be done by dividing the forces because economic conditions do not permit
 concentration?  That is possible, but I cannot make a positive conclusion,
 because we have not yet had concrete experience in this respect.

 The February letter from the Central Committee was not written in the right
 spirit, and has exerted a bad influence on a number of comrades in the party
 in the 4th Army.   Even you seemed to have been affected too,  The Central
 Committee also issued at that time a circular stating that war between
 Chiang Kai-shek and the Kwangsi warlords might not break out.   Since then,
 however, its appraisals and directives have in the main been correct.   It has
 already issued another circular to correct the one containing the inadequate
 appraisal (as in fact it was only part of a larger circular).   Although it
 did not make any formal correction as to the letter to the Red Army, its
 subsequent directives were entirely not tainted with such pessimism and its
 views on the Red Army's movements now completely agree with ours.  Yet that
 letter remains a bad influence on a number of comrades.   The Front Committee's
 reply to the letter of the Central Committee was made public within the party
 together with the Central Committee's letter, but it does not seem to have
 had a considerable influence on this section of comrades, because the letter
 from the Central Committee exactly suited their convictions.  Meanwhile, many
 subsequent correct directives from the Central Committee on its appraisal
 of the current situation might not have been heeded by this section of comrades,
 or even if they have heeded them, they are still unable to erase completely
 the former impression given them.   Thus I feel that even now it is still
 necessary to give some explanation on the question.
 The plan to seize Kiangsi within a year was also proposed by the Front Commit-
 tee to the Central Committee in April last year, and a resolution was subse-
 quently passed at Yu-tu.  I record as follows the reason given then in the
 letter to the Central Committee;
 "The troops of Chaing Kai-shek and the Kwangsi warlords are drawing near each
 other in the environs of Chiu-chiang, and big battles will take place presently.
 The Kuomintang rule will consequently disintegrate and the revolutionary
 upsurge will arrive soon.   In preparing our work in these circumstances, we
 feel that, so far as the southern provinces are concerned, the military
 forces of the compradors and landlords in Kwangtung and Hunan are too strong,
 while in Hunan, because of the party's putschist mistake, we have moreover
 lost almost all our mass following outside as well as inside the party.   In
 the three provinces of Fukien, Kiangsi and Chekiang, however, the situation
 is different.  First, the enemy's military strength there is at its feeblest.
 In Chekiang, there are only a small number of provincial guards under
 Chiang Po-ch'eng.  In Fukien, though there are altogether 14 regiments under
 5 commands, Kuo Feng-ming's brigade has already been smashed; the troops
 under the respective command of Ch'en Kuo-hui and Lu Hsing-pang are bandit
 forces of small fighting capacity; the two brigades of marines stationed
 along the coast have never seen action and certainly cannot have great
 fighting capacity; Chang Chen alone is comparatively able to fight; but
 even he, according to an analysis made by the Provincial Committee of Fukien,
 has under his command only two regiments of some fighting capacity.   In
 addition, Fukien is now entirely in a state of confusion and disunity.   In
 Kiangsi there are altogether 16 regiments under two commands--that of
 Chu P'ei-te and that of Hsiung Shih-hui; the military strength there is

 superior to that of either Fukien or Chekiang, but still far inferior to that
 of Hunan.   Secondly, we have committed fewer putschist mistakes in these three
 provinces.  With the exception of Chekiang, where the situation is not quite
 clear to us, the party's organizations and mass following in both Kiangsi
 and Fukien are better than those in Hunan.   Take Kiangsi for instance.   There
 we still retain a fairly adequate basis in Te-an, Hsiu-shui and T'ung-ku in
 northern Kiangsi.   In Ning-kang, Yung-hsin, Lien-hua and Sui-ch'uan in
 western Kiangsi the party and the Red Guards are still powerful.   In southern
 Kiangsi the situation is even more hopeful, as the 2d and 4th Regiments of
 the Red Army tend to grow every day in counties like Chi-an, Yung-hsin and
 Hsing-kuo, and the Red Army under Fang Chih-min is by no means wiped out.   All
 this places us in a position to close in on Nan-chang. We propose to the
 Central Committee that during the period of prolonged warfare between the
 Kuomintang warlords, we contend with both Chiang Kai-shek and the Kwangsi
 clique for Kiangsi and at the same time for the western parts of both Fukien
 and Chekiang.   In these three provinces the Red Army should be expanded and
 an independent regime of the masses created.  We set the time-limit at 1 year
 for accomplishing this plan.  Within this year proletarian bases for struggle
 should be established in such places as Shanghai, Wusih, Ningpo, Hangchow,
 Foochow and Amoy, in order to provide leadership to the peasant struggles in
 the provinces of Chekiang, Kiangsi and Fukien.   The Provincial Committee
 of Kiangsi must be made healthy and strong.   An effort must be made to build
 workers' bases of Nan-chang, Chiu-chiang, Chi-an and the Nan-chang-Chiu-chiang
 Railway."
 The above proposal to seize Kiangsi in 1 year erred in setting the time-limit
 mechanically at 1 year.   The proposal to seize Kiangsi was based, in my
 opinion, on the consideration that the nationwide revolutionary upsurge would
 arise soon, apart from the conditions in the province itself.   For if we had
 not been convinced of this, we could not possibly have arrived at the conclu-
 sion about the seizure of Kiangsi in a year.   The only defect in the proposal
 was setting the time-limit mechanically at 1 year, thereby affecting the
 meaning of the word "soon" in the statement that "a revolutionary upsurge will
 arise soon" and making it smack more or less of mechanicism and impetuosity.
 But you do not believe in the seizure of Kiangsi in a year, because you
 overestimate the objective forces and underestimate the subjective forces.
 Consequently, you do not believe in the arrival of the revolutionary upsurge
 soon, and hence your conclusion.  As to the subjective and objective condi-
 tions in Kiangsi, they will deserve our attention.   Apart from the subjective
 conditions as stated above to which I have no new opinion to add, three things
 concerning the objective conditions can now be clearly pointed out:   First,
 the economy in Kiangsi is chiefly an economy of feudal vestiges, i.e., one
 of exploitation through land rent; the power of the merchant bourgeoisie is
 relatively weak; and the armed forces of the landlords are stronger than
 those in any other southern province.   Second, Kiangsi has no troops of its
 own.   It has always been garrisoned by troops from other provinces.  Sent
 there for the "annihilation of Communists" or "annihilation of bandits,"
 these troops are not very enthusiastic because they are unfamiliar with
 local conditions and do not feel such personal concern as native troops do.

 And third, Kiangsi, unlike Kwangtung which is close to Hong Kong where almost
 all things are under British control, is comparatively free from the influence
 of imperialism.   Once we have grasped these three points, we can explain why
 rural uprisings have been more widespread and the Red Army and guerrilla units
 more numerous in Kiangsi than in any other province.
 I have now said roughly all I want to say to you.   I have perhaps said too
 much, like a chatterbox.   But I think our discussion of the question is good.
 If this question which we are discussing is really correctly settled, the
 influence on the action of the Red Army will be great.   So I have written
 this with great pleasure.
 Lastly there are still two points which need making clear.   First, how to
 interpret the two words "arise soon" in the phrase "a revolutionary upsurge
 will arise soon" is a common question among many comrades.   Marxists are not
 fortune-tellers. Of future developments and changes he should and can only
 point the general direction; he should not and cannot mechanically fix the
 day and the hour.  My statement that the revolutionary upsurge in China will
 arise soon emphatically does not refer to something utterly devoid of
 significance for action, to a tantalizing phantom, which, in the words of some
 people, "may arise."  It is like a ship on the sea whose masthead is already
 seen in the horizon by people standing on the shore.   It is like the morning
 sun which, rising with radiant beams in the east, is already seen from afar
 by people standing on the top of a mountain.   It is like an almost fully
 formed child stirring in its mother's womb.   Second, when I say you want to
 extend our political influence by lighter, mobile guerrilla means, I do not
 mean that you have a purely military viewpoint and the mentality of a roving
 bandit.   Obviously, you have neither, because neither has any idea of winning
 over the masses, while you advocate "winning over the masses without reserva-
 tion."  You not only advocate it, but are actually doing it.  What I do not
 approve is your lack of a profound notion about establishing a [Red] political
 power, as a result of which the task of winning over the masses to accelerate
 the coming of the revolutionary upsurge will certainly not be satisfactorily
 accomplished as you wish.   The principal purpose of my letter is to make clear
 this point,
 Please correct me where I am wrong.

 QUESTION OF RICH PEASANTS AFTER LAND DISTRIBUTION (Situation at Yung-hsin
 and in the Northern Party)
 [Text] Exploitation by the rich peasants of the Red area of Yung-hsin is
 done by (1) hoarding of grain to raise its price and (2) selling of indus-
 trial products.   Hoarding of grain is in turn done by two methods:   one,
 hoarding of their own surplus grain and two, buying of grain from poor
 peasants at very low prices, causing this year's serious spring famine.
 Because they wanted to hoard grain and raise its price, and as the maximum
 price of grain was set by the government, the rich peasants concealed all
 their grain, so that poor people and workers in the town had to subsist on
 thin gruel for a whole week.   Even farm hands and poor peasants in rural
 villages, unable to buy grain, had to fight with starvation.   Later, the
 county soviet led a spring famine struggle, waging a resolute fight against
 the rich peasants without making any concession, in a determined bid to hold
 down grain prices.   The party acted in all districts and villages, leading
 Young Pioneers in throwing open storerooms and uncovering large amounts of
 grain concealed by the rich peasants in wine barrels, double walls, barns
 and under brick-covered yards and beds.   As a result, there was enough grain
 for all and to spare.   And when new grain was harvested, the rich peasants
 all brought their old grain to the town to sell.   In selling industrial goods
 and doing small business the rich peasants make extraordinarily large profit.
 They deal mainly in salt, imported stockings, handkerchiefs, sugar and soap.
 They have money and various old social connections.   They can buy in quantity
 what the poor peasants and farm hands cannot buy.   (The above is reported by
 Wang Huai [3769/2037]; the following is by Ch'en Cheng-jen [7115/2973/0086])
 The situation prevails not only in Yung-hsin, but also in the northern parts,
 where a spring famine struggle was also waged this year.   There the rich
 peasants do business and make money like their counterparts in Yung-hsin.
 There is Chiu Ju-t'ang in Fu-t'ien which is smalltime capitalist.  When
 there is a shortage of salt in the north, it goes to buy salt in Nan-chang.
 When supplies of printing ink and paper run short, it also buys them from
 Nan-chang.   Consequently, it has friendly contacts with the leader of the
 Kuomintang lookout squads as well as old social connections.   Chiu Ju-t'ang

 sells salt and other goods at a very high price,   In June-July it sold salt
 at 1 string and 600 coppers a catty.   It owns two sewing machines and is
 opposed by all tailors and dressmakers of Fu-t'ien,  as it takes away work
 from them. Because it sold goods at too high prices, the Fu-t'ien town soviet,
 acting on demands by the masses, had the proprietor of Chiu Ju-t'ang arrested
 and fined him 1,000 yuan.   After the fine, he continued to do business in
 Fu-t'ien.  After the capture of Chi-an, his business has grown even more.
 During the spring famine in the north, the rich peasants sold their grain in
 White areas.   The spring famine struggle was to stop grain from flowing to
 White areas, permitting such flow only between Red areas.

 INVESTIGATION IN TUNG-T'ANG AND OTHER AREAS
 [Text]   On 30 October 1930, the Red Army Front Committee decided at Lo-fang on
 a policy of luring the enemy deep into our territory.   On 6 November the Red
 Army moved from Hsia-chiang, crossed Kan-chiang and marched toward Yung-feng
 and Nan-ch'eng, while I went from Hsia-chiang to Chi-an to make arrangements
 for a withdrawal.   On 7 November I passed the night at Tung-t'ang, arriving
 at Chi-an the following day.   On the way I made some summary investigations.
 My investigations at Li-chia-fang have enabled me to know clearly the organiza-
 tion and activities of village and township level soviets in the agrarian
 struggle in these places.   Prior to these investigations, my ideas of the
 situation were vague.   These investigations have enabled me to find out the
 serious character of land distribution based on each village as a unit.   Land
 is already distributed in several dozen counties in southwestern Kiangsi.
 The land law promulgated by the superior level government makes the distribu-
 tion based on each township as a unit, and all personnel of superior-level
 organs presume that distribution is made with each township as a unit.   The
 actual situation is quite different.   Distribution is generally made with
 each village as a unit.   Only in a few instances has it been made with each
 township as a unit.   Such distribution based on each village--advantageous
 to the rich peasants but disadvantageous to poor peasants--should be changed.
 1.   Investigations in Tung-t'ang
 Tung-t'ang village of the 15th township, T'ung-shui Ch'u, Chi-shui County.
 The township consists of 1,000 families of 3,000 persons.
 Land is distributed with each village as a unit.
 The population of this village is 290.
 The village government has a chairman and a secretary, both of whom provide
 their own food.
 Land distribution is made at 1 tou 3 sheng per capita, yielding about
 2.5 tan of grain.   (1 tou of land yields 2 tan of grain.)

 The six large villages are Li-chia'-fang, Shang-Chao-tang, Tsang-hsia, Hsu-yuan,
 Chin--pi and Chou-yuan.   The three small ones are Yen-chia-fang, Hsiao-li-chia-
 fang and Yang-p'ing-chou.   The three small villages and Li--chia-.fang are under
 one government, while each of the remaining five large villages has its own
 government.
 The village government of Li-chia-fang is run by four persons:  one chairman,
 one secretary, one officer in charge of land and grain, and one in charge of
 communications and concurrently cooking.   The chairman, secretary and communi-
 cations officer who is concurrently the cook live and work in the government
 building and eat at public expense.   The officer in charge of land and
 grain administration lives in his own home and eats his own meals.  He is
 provided with meals only when he works at the government office.
 The village government's expenses are:   (1)   Regular meals for three plus
 meals for an average of two persons a day.   At 10 cents per person each day,
 it comes to 15 yuan a month.   (2)   Office expenses for lamps, oil, paper
 and pens, 3 yuan.   (3)  Every time Red Guards and Young Pioneers are sent
 out on a mission they are paid expenses for straw sandals, haircut, cigarettes.
 Sometimes they are paid 500'and other times 1 string of coppers (Actual
 expenses are defrayed; overpayment is returned, underpayment is made up for.)
 In the nine attacks on Chi-an, they sometimes went on a mission for a month
 before returning.   These pocket expenses amounted to 3 yuan a month on the
 average in the past. In the past, the village government had also to pay
 for their food.   Later, the township government paid for their food and the
 village government gave them pocket expenses.   These.  three items amounted
 to a total of 21 yuan.
 In the past nine persons worked for the village government.   There were the
 chairman, secretary, finance officer, procurement officer, land officer, grain
 officer, judge, communications officer and the cook.    All nine worked in the
 government office and were provided with board.
 The revolutionary force was in control from early in the 1st month this year to
 the 19th of the third month, and again from the fourth day of the sixth month
 to the fourth day of the ninth month.   In the period from the 20th of the
 third month to the third of the sixth month when the reactionary force was in
 control, the village government was abolished and the responsible persons
 fled to Fu-t'ien.   From the fifth day of the ninth month up to the present,
 only four persons work regularly in the government.   More money was required
 when nine persons worked in the office.
 In the period from the tenth of the first month to the 19th of the third month,
 and again from the fourth of the sixth month to the fifth of the ninth month, the
 township government comprised the chairman, a secretary, buyer, treasurer,
 cultural officer, lang officer, grain officer, judge, communications officer,
 a cook, three women officers, three Young Pioneers (the leader, the deputy
 leader and an instructor and concurrently secretary), and one leader of the
 Children's Corps, a total of 18 [sic] persons.   They were all provided with
 board by the government.   From the sixth of the ninth month up to the present

 the number of officers has been reduced to seven:   the chairman, a secretary,
 an officer in charge of land and grain, a cultural officer, the chairman of
 the Woman's Committee, the leader of the Red Guards who doubles for the cook,
 and another secretary who is the "Confiscations Commissar" and concurrently
 the officer who "goes to the villages to do propaganda on the expansion of
 the Red Army."  These seven persons regularly live and have their meals in
 the government offices.   The four members of the Woman's Committee eat their
 meals at the government office when they have official work to do, otherwise
 they stay at home.   The work of these four women members consists of going
 to the villages to organize working women to serve as Red Guards, comforting
 squads and washing squads, and doing propaganda to get the men to serve in
 the Red Army.
 In the second month this year eight men from this township went to join the
 Red Army.   During the second attack on Chi-an on the 18th of the sixth month,
 two men from each village or a total of 18, went to join the Red Army.
 During the seventh attack on Chi-an in the seventh month, another seven men
 went.   After the ninth attack on Chi-an on the 13th of the eighth month,
 another 46 men went.   These have been placed in the Independent Regiments and
 are receiving training at the command post of the 2d Independent Regiment at
 Ta-t'ang.   Altogether 80 persons from this township have gone to join the
 Red Army.   They all did so after being agitated.  But of the last batch of
 46, 4 or 5 were unwilling to join up and wept.   They went reluctantly.
 This township comprises nine villages:   Li-chia-fang (of the surname of Hu, over
 220 persons), Hsiao-li-chia-fang (surname of Li, 30 persons), Yeh-chia-fang
 (surname of Yeh, 45 persons) and Yang-p'ing-chou (surname of Tung, 24 persons);
 these four villages have a population of 327 (155 male and 172 female).
 Shang-chao-t'ang,(surname of Liu, 200 persons);  Ts'ang-hsia, surname of Yen,
 315 persons (150 male and 165 female); Hsu-yuan, surname of Chou, 300 persons;
 Chin--pi, 190 persons; and Chou-yuan, 372 persons (176 male and 196 female).
 The nine villages have a total population of 1,404.
 The four villages headed by Li-chia-fang have altogether 921.1 mou of fields.
 In Li-chia-fang each person receives 2.7 mou, yielding 7 tan of grain.   In
 Yeh-chia-fang each person receives 3 mou, yielding 6 tan of grain.   In
 Hsiao-li-chia-fang each person receives 2 mou, yielding 5.5 tan of grain.
 In Yang-p'ing-chou each person receives 2.5 mou, yielding 5.5 tan of grain.
 Of the remaining 17.9 mou of Li-chia-fang, 6 mou has been transferred to
 Hsiao-li-chia-fang and another 6 to Yeh-chia-fang.   Only 5.9 mou remains
 "communal property."  After distribution in Yang-p'ing-chou, 2.3 mou remains
 "communal property."  This remainder after distribution is difficult to
 divide up again.   So it is public land of the village government, which rents
 it out at a rate of 60 percent of the yield.   This rent in kind helps to
 defray public expenses.
 Shang-chao-t'ang Village has 820 mou of fields.   Each person receives 2.4 mou,
 yielding 2.5 tan of grain.  After the distribution, 29.2 mou remains "communal
 property."

 Ts'ang-hsia Village has 690.3 mou of fields.   Each person receives a share that
 yields 7.8 tan of grain.
 Hsu-yuan has over 820 mou of fields.  Method of distribution:   Each person who
 stays in the village receives 3.5 mou.  The land is good, each mou yielding
 5 lo (2 lo make 1 tan), so that 3.5 mou yields 17 lo.   Each worker receives
 1.75 mou, or half of what a peasant gets.   Each person who has left to work
 elsewhere receives 1.4 mou.
 Chin-pi Village has 489 mou of fields.  Each person receives 2.7 mou, yielding
 6 lo of grain.   Those who have left to work elsewhere get nothing.
 Chou-yuan Village has 510.5 mou of fields.   Each person receives 2.2 mou and
 gets 6 lo of grain from it.   Those who have left the village get nothing.
 After the Red Army captured Chi-an, four members of the reactionary lookout
 squad--the leader, his deputy, the secretary and a platoon leader--were taken
 prisoner in Chi-an.   They were sent under escort to T'ung-shu-p'ing Ch'u
 Government and executed.  All ordinary members of the squad joined in the
 revolution in this township and no one went to Chi-an.   Three platoon leaders
 and 10 group leaders who stayed at home were not executed.   They were permitted
 to join in the revolution.
 Yen Ch'un-wen, chairman of the township government, owned 8 mou of fields,
 yielding 24 lo of grain at only 3 lo a mou, and supporting a family of four.
 At the first distribution of land in the seventh month, when both those
 at home and those who had left to work elsewhere received a share, Yen's
 family had 1.2 mou taken away from him, so that he now owned only 6.8 mou,
 capable of yielding 20 lo of grain or 5 lo for each member of the family.
 After the capture of Chi-an in the eighth month another distribution was
 made.   This time those who had left and found work elsewhere received
 nothing.   Only those who stayed behind and those who had left but could not
 find work elsewhere were given a share of 2.2 mou.   Since the family already
 had 8 mou, it received 0.8 mou.   The family owed a debt of 500 strings of
 coppers in the past.   A daughter (7 years old) was sold in Chi-an (the buyer
 was from Kanchow, but operated a money-lending shop in Chi-an called Ho Mao)
 for 100 yuan.   This the family paid the creditor, but another 200 strings
 of coppers was still outstanding.  Another daughter (newly born) was given
 away to the Catholic Church in Chi-an, for which the family received nothing.
 IV.   Investigations in Hsi-i-t'ing
 This is one of the villages of the 23d township of Ju'fang Ch'u of Chi--an.
 It is 15 li from Chi-an.
 Ju-fang Ch'u comprises over 30 townships.
 There are nine village governments in this township.
 Hsi-i-t'ing Village has a population of about 600.

 The village government is run by five persons;   the chairman, a secretary,
 grain officer, land officer and a woman officer.   They all provide their own
 meals, as the village government does not provide board.   But when they gather
 together for some business (such as a conference), the village government will
 provide them with meals.
 Public funds of the ancestral temple and other religious pools are combined
 for the use of the village government.
 The village government's expenses consist of payments to Red Guards and Young
 Pioneers who are sent out on missions (as in the attacks on Chi-an and in
 attending conferences) and to soldiers of the Independent Regiments for their
 meals (10 cents a day for each man).   This is the only payment.   No money is
 given for straw sandals, haircuts or cigarettes.
 Nineteen persons work for the township government:   one chairman, two secre-
 taries (one works for the township government and the other for the Red Guards),
 a cultural officer, buyer, grain officer, land officer, Red Guards officer,
 social insurance officer, two women (one chairman of the Women's Committee,
 one in charge of organization), a cook, a communications officer, one leader
 of Red Guards brigade, three leaders of Red Guards teams, one Red Guards
 instructor, and one Young Pioneer leader.   This township government began
 working on the ninth day of the sixth month.   It was unstable, because the
 reactionaries of Chi-an often came to this township to arrest people, and when
 the enemy came the government moved out.   It was only after the capture of
 Chi-an that township work began to develop.   The reactionaries took away
 10 people, two of then were executed.   After the capture of Chi-an, the
 eight prisoners were released, and over 20 reactionaries from this township
 were seized in Chi-an.   Of these, six of the more brutal were executed, a
 number was released after paying a fine, and the remaining were sent under
 escort to T'ung-shup'ing Ch'u Government.   The government is very busy now
 distributing land and grain, opposing debts, and setting up a school.
 Land distribution is being made right now in this township.   Distribution is
 already made in five villages, taking each village as a unit.   But an order
 has come from the superior level, stating that distribution should be made
 on the basis of taking each township as a unit, so that distribution has got
 to be made again.   The opinion of the various villages is that distribution
 should be made on the basis of taking each village as a unit where the land
 owned by the village is extensive and each township as a unit where the land
 owned by the various villages is small.   Of the nine villages of this
 township, eight want the distribution based on village  as a unit, only one
 wants it based on township as a unit.
 The five villages where distribution is already made are Ting-t'ang,
 Pan-chi-k'ang, T'a'shui, Hsin-t'ang and Hsia-shang.   In Ting-t'ang the dis-
 tribution is 2 mou (yieldijig between 4 and 5 lo) per capita.   In Pan-chi-k'ang
 it is 2.5 mou per capita.   In T'ashui and Hsiashang it is also 2 mou per capita,
 but in Hsin-t'ang it is only 0.8 mou per capita.   Hsin-t'ang has little land
 and wants distribution based on the township as a unit.   Though the land of

 Hsin-tang, with a population of about 200 all surnamed Huang, is small, it
 is all good land (with no flooding disasters), some high, some low.
 Chi-an has been captured for more than a month, but distribution of land is
 not yet accomplished in this township..   It will take another 5 or 6 days to
 complete.
 The anti-debts struggle means creditors are required to surrender the pro-
 misory notes they hold, so they may be destroyed.  Of the nine villages, only
 Kuan-t'ien has so far surrendered all promisory notes to the township govern-
 ment, but they are not yet destroyed.
 The chairman of the township government has been dismissed by the Ch'u Govern-
 ment.  Wang Yu-t'ang, the new chairman, has been here only 5 days.
 Liu Ch'uan-sheng, the previous chairman, is a carpenter.  His family of three
 owns 1.8 mou of land.  He was made chairman in the sixth month.
 Ju-heng and Fang-k'uo were formerly two districts, but are now combined into
 one under the name of Ju-heng Ch'u.   The new chairman if this township
 government comes from Ju-heng, but this township formerly belonged to Fang-
 k'uo Ch'u.  Wang Yu-t'ang, a carpenter, owns 5 mou of land which yields
 18 lo of grain for his family of four..   Besides being a carpenter, Wang
 also tills the land.   Over 70 men from this district have joined the Red
 Army.   Of these, over 40 are Young Pioneers, teenagers who are very brave.
 The District Government is situated in T'ung-shup'ing.  Its chairman, Ch'en
 Chun-pin, is a rice miller.

 LAND DISTRIBUTION IN WESTERN KIANGSI
 12-15 November 1930
 [Text] These are delegates' reports made during the expanded conference of
 the western Kiangsi Mobile Commission held on 12 November 1930 and the
 expanded conference of the Provincial Mobile Commission held on 15 November.
 I made brief notes during the conferences, and, although they are very
 sketchy, from them one can see a small part of the land struggle in south-
 western Kiangsi.
 1.   Distribution of Fields
 Chun-hua:  Townships are separated by as much as 10 li.   In one township
 the good and the bad [fields] were grouped for even distribution.   The first
 distribution took place in December of last year (1929).  The second dis-
 tribution took place in March of this year, taking the original tiller as
 the basic unit and taking from those with more to compensate those with less.
 Now the third distribution is taking place, using the fertile [land] to
 compensate for the infertile.   Distribution is beginning, and will take
 over 10 days to complete.
 Ju-yen:   In December of last year (1929), the fields of the bad gentry and
 landlords were distributed, but public fields and the fields of wealthy
 farmers had not yet been distributed.  In March of this year, all [fields]
 were confiscated and distributed in accordance with productive capacity.
 In May, all [fields] were confiscated for the third time and distributed
 according to physical labor.   Yet it was not thoroughly equal in that some
 fertile land was taken from those with more fertile land while some infertile
 land was taken from those having more infertile land.   Equalization has not
 yet been accomplished by division into three classes, A, B and C.   The
 majority used the village as the basic unit.
 Shui-tung:  The township was used as the basic unit for all three distribu-
 tions.   During the first, in January of last year, land was taken from those
 with more to compensate those with less.   During the second, in June, fertile
 land was taken to compensate for the infertile, but it was still incomplete

 and many persons were dissatisfied with it.   The third distribution is now
 in process.   Land committee members of the various townships were concentrated
 at district level and land commissions were organized for mutual assistance
 in distribution, and to carry out the taking of fertile land to compensate
 for the infertile.  When Chi-an was opened, over 1,000. people returned from
 the city and received land in the same manner as others.   On completion of
 this distribution, distribution will have been completed in 13 out of 17
 townships.
 Western District:   Two distributions have been made.  During the second one
 in August of this year, although distribution was made in three classes,
 upper, middle and lower, with the good and the bad [fields] distributed
 equally, it was actually not complete.   The township was the basic unit.
 The township is too big, with the district fields being as much as 6 or 7 li
 away and unwanted by the farmers.
 Recently the District Commission announced that the third distribution would
 be complete, taking fertile land to compensate for infertile land, and burn-
 ing tax records and land titles, with five inspectors dispatched by the
 district to assist in the distribution.
 Ju-fang:   The first [distribution] was in January of this year, with the
 good and the bad [fields] distributed equally.   It was incomplete--public
 fields remained.  In some cases the township was the basic unit and in
 some cases the village was the basic unit.   The second was in May, when the
 masses took the defector leaders' fields and distributed them to the poor
 people (those receiving distributed land for,the first time). In the third
 (the current one), equal distribution was made to the upper, middle and lower
 classes.   Territory newly seized in the three or four townships in the
 Nan-yu-miao area has not been completely distributed.   Distribution is
 complete in Hsi-yi-t'ing, where the township was the basic unit.
 An-fu:  Distribution has not yet been made in places where there have been
 no defectors--distribution was made first in places where there had been
 defections, with 10 days to complete distribution which was to be totally
 equal.  Distribution is half complete in seven districts, two-thirds complete
 in five districts, and has not yet been done in the remaining turncoat places.
 Among the nine districts in the county, the First District is not turncoat
 at all, one-third of the Second District is not turncoat, half of the Third
 District is not turncoat, one-third of the Fourth District is not turncoat,
 three-fifths of the Fifth, Sixth and Seventh Districts is not turncoat, half
 the Eighth District is not turncoat, the Ninth District--the city--is com-
 pletely turncoat, as is the 30-li area around the city.   The reason some
 areas are not turncoat is that they border on the red areas of Yung-hsin,
 Lien-hua and Yuan-chou.  All non-turncoat places are "weak and small minority
 peoples" who have been oppressed by the large villages. Distribution of fields
 has been completed in all such places, taking from those with much to compen-
 sate those with little, but not yet taking the fertile to compensate for the
 infertile land.

 Tung-ku:  The township was the basic unit,  Land was distributed in July of
 last year (1929), taking fertile land to compensate for the infertile, and
 equalizing by division into three classes:  A, B and C.   The second distri-
 bution.has not yet taken place..  Later, because those serving in the Red
 Army had returned their land to the government, such land in the various
 villages was given to the villagers to till.  The masses of the people
 clamored, so the fields were evenly divided in July of last year under the
 slogan "Group for evenness."
 Hsia-chiang:   In the first distribution which took place in January and
 February of this year, the fields of the local tyrants and evil gentry were
 divided.   Public fields were divided during the second distribution held in
 March.  Fields of wealthy farmers were divided in the third distribution
 held in April and May, completing the distribution by taking the fertile
 to compensate for the infertile [fields],   Taking the village as the basic
 unit, there were unwanted fields because there was much land and few people.
 Two distributions have taken place in the newly developed areas.  The first
 distribution was carried out in haphazard fashion 2 weeks ago.  The second
 and current distribution must be completed in 5 days.  The good and the
 bad [fields] are being combined for even distribution.
 Shui-han:  The first was made in March of this year, taking from those with
 much to compensate those with little,  For the second distribution carried
 out during August along the border of the White areas, land was taken from
 those with much to compensate those with little, but the fertile were not
 taken to compensate for the infertile.  In the remainder, fertile [land]
 was taken to compensate for the infertile.   Special distribution of good
 fields, however, was made to responsible members of the party headquarters
 and the farmers were directed to help work such fields.
 Ju-lin:  The first distribution took place in March of this year,   taking from
 those with much to compensate those with little.  In May the entire district
 defected.   In June the guard unite were overthrown, and the second distribu-
 tion of fields took place, with the fertile taken to compensate for the
 infertile in several townships, but in the great majority of townships
 distribution was performed in name only.   This was because the AB group
 was in control there.   The township was the basic unit with the village being
 the basic unit only under special circumstances.
 Yung-hsin:   In the Northwestern Special District, the old, young, and
 crippled who had no tilling capability received an additional half-share.
 It was. also so resolved at the first County Delegates' Plenary Conference,
 in addition, it was resolved to add to those receiving the additional
 half-share those "working personnel" whose dependents did not have a tilling
 capability.  This was carried out in part of the Northwestern Special
 District, but was rejected by the Special Western Route Working Committee,
 because it stemmed from a charitable view, and was derided by some as the
 "Orphan and Widow Line."  In Yung-hsin land distribution was performed
 twice throughout the county, the first after Lung-yuan-k'ou was opened, the
 second was carried out in September after being decided upon by the Western
 Route Working Committee in June.  Distribution has still not been completed

 in one-fifth of the county:   the entire First District (city), half of the
 Fourth District (Nan-hsiang), and the entire Fifth District (Tung-hsiang).
 The farmers of Yung-hsin wished to use production capacity as the standard
 for the distribution of fields, and this was accepted at the County Delegates
 Plenary Conference.
 Chi-shui:   County seat and Feng-shui fields have been distributed;  [fields in]
 Chin-t'an have not.
 "Distribute to people who can be seen."  "Group good with bad."  "Distribution
 was poor at the outset."
 The "Honan Fellows" are a difficult problem.   In the township of Ku-ts'un,
 each person received only 2 tan worth of land [production capacity].
 Wan-an:   The village was the basic unit.   By the second distribution, the
 fertile were taken to compensate for the infertile.
 Fen-yi:   Fields distributed with the village as the basic unit.   Division
 was by [amounts of] grain, not by field.    Over 2,000 houses were burned by
 the counterrevolutionaries, and for more than 20 li there were no old houses.
 2.   The Barren [Fallow] Field Situation
 Tung-ku:  Each person received a minimum of 16 tan of grain (a tan is about
 80 catties); many fields were uncultivated.   A large portion of the hills
 were fallow because it cost too much to harvest peaches; nor were the hills
 dug up.
 Ch'un-hua:  Fields capable of producing 400 or 500 baskets lay fallow
 because (1) the March distribution occurred when farming was busy, the
 farmers had no family property, furniture or equipment, the land distributed
 was poor and distant, and (2) manpower was inadequate because of the elder
 sons serving in the Red Army and working outside (that is to say 2,700 or
 2,800 persons).
 Shui-tung:   Several li were fallow.  This was because Lin-shui at the Red-
 White border was frequently harassed by the reactionaries of Chi-an city.
 Several hundred guards were required daily.   Three lines of guards were
 posted, and were frequently killed by the enemy at night.
 Shui-nan:   Fields [capable] of [producing] several hundred tan of grain lie
 fallow because, when public fields are reserved, the farmers are unwilling
 to rent them for tilling.   "Having received distribution of fields [capable]
 of [producing] several tan of grain, I have enough to eat, and am unwilling
 to till public fields."
 Ju-lin:   Fields of several thousand tan of grain lie fallow, with no one
 to harvest the ripe grain.   This is because the fields belonged to the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 guards of the reactionary landlords and wealthy farmers, and when these people
 fled, the government did not distribute the fields to the farmers, so the
 farmers had no responsibility to till or harvest them (Ju-lin is a district
 near the city of Chi--an).
 An-fu:   Fields of 6,000 tan of grain lie fallow in the Tao-p'u and Chung-wen
 Districts, because reactionary farmers are afraid to return to their homes
 in view of revenge-ism for slaughter.   It was also because the distribution
 of fields was not thorough, having been on the basis of numbers only.   Both
 reasons stemmed from the mischief-making led by the wealthy farmers.   An-fu
 has much land and few people.   Most of the people from Hunan, Yung-hsin and
 Honan work fields in An-fu.   If you will only pay their taxes to the govern-
 ment,  they will give you their fields to work.  Why are there so few people?
 It is because many die because of poor sanitation.
 Hsin-yu:   Fields of several hundred tan of grain lie fallow in three Red
 districts because part of the people left to serve in the Red Army. Some
 [fields] are also fallow near the Red-White border.
 Fen-yi:   Fields of several tans of grain lie fallow.
 Yung-hsin:   Generally speaking, no fields are fallow, with total fields of
 less than 100 tan of grain lying fallow.
 Kung-nan:   Much land lies fallow in all  Red-White border areas.
 3.   The Problem of. Distributing Land to Workers
 The farmers of Yung-hsin opposed the sharing of land equally with the workers,
 but the Yung-hsin Delegates Plenary Conference did not accept this view.
 In one district in Tai-ho the wages of workers were reduced after the distri-
 bution of land to them, but the wages were later restored.
 In Chi-an, workers who worked for less than a half-year received their dis-
 tribution of land accordingly, whereas those who worked for more than half
 the year received a half-share of land.
 4.   The Problem of Distributing Hills
 The Yung-hsin Delegates Plenary Conference resolved that the township would
 be the basic unit in tea-producing hills, with equal distribution made
 according to population.
 The Chi-an Delegates Plenary Conference (October 1930) resolved that bamboo-
 covered and tree-covered hills would not be divided but would be controlled
 by the township soviet and used by the farmers.   Those needing bamboo or
 wood must get the government's permission to cut [bamboo or trees].   Reeds
 and grass may be freely cut and taken from hills.

 Tea-oil hills in Yung-hsin, Hsia-chiang, Yen-fu, Ju-hsing, Tung.ku, T'ai-ho
 and the Western District have all been equally divided.   Ju-fang and
 Ch'un-hua have no hills producing tea and oil..   The hills of. Wan-an have
 not been divided.
 Fen-yi:   On 5 November of this year (1930), the Provincial Mobile Commission
 dispatched Liu Lin-tung to participate in the County Mobile Commission,
 which passed by the County Workers Farmers and Soldiers Plenary Conference.
 The method was:   "Hills worth over 300 yuan will be turned over to the
 soviets.  Hills worth less than 300 yuan will be controlled by the original
 owners."  In May and June of this year (before the 2d Plenary Conference),
 however, because of the receipt of orders from higher authority (the Fourth
 Expanded Conference of the Northern Route Mobile Commission), the township
 had already been taken as the basic unit in equal distribution of hills,
 although no meeting had been held in this county.   This decision was re-
 versed in November, and the farmers were very dissatisfied.
 There are seven types of hills:   (1) lumber [producing],   (2) miscellaneous
 food, (3)  raw material, (4) bamboo and wood (large and small), (5) firewood
 (reed and grass hills and firewood hills), (6) mines and (7) barren hills.

 [Text] On 14 November 1930, the Kiangsi Provincial Committee met in Chi-an.
 After the reports of Comrades Ch'en Yi, Ch'en Cheng-jen, and Ma Ming, I spoke
 as the representative of past committee members, pointing out that the line
 continually followed within the Western and Southern Kiangsi Party after the
 "Second Plenary Conference" of cancelling land reform had been discussed in
 conference, and all acknowledged that a determined struggle must be carried
 out against this incorrect line.   The following are a few important points
 which I recorded during the reports of Comrades Ch'en Yi, Ch'en Cheng-jen
 and Ma King, and only I can understand many of them.
 Ju-lin District:  Wash away loyal comrades, leaving the homogeneous AB group.
 Red areas:  Wealthy farmers control the economy.
 Yung-hsin:  Wealthy farms control the food.   The government's policy of
 suppressing wealthy farmers is correct.
 District Committee secretaries do not visit townships to inspect.
 The views of the Central Committee and higher authority are not transmitted
 to lower levels.
 "Kill all wealthy farmers and landlords."
 "Must divide firmly."
 Use the White Terror in discussing the policy of wealthy farmers cheating
 poor farmers, "White Symbol."
 When the line is not clearly specified, the wealthy farmers will encircle
 and deceive, as was the case in the Fourth District Committee of Yung-hsin
 (Ma Ming is the secretary).

 Distribution of the fields of the Eastern Route has not been completed at all.
 In the Southern Route, distribution has only been completed in the Hsing-kuo
 and Kung counties.
 Tseng is a superior man.
 Eighty percent of the Jui-chin Party is landlords and wealthy farmers; over
 80 excellent party members, over 30 landlords and wealthy farmers including
 the head of the counterrevolutionary guard unit.  No fields have been dis-
 tributed in 2 months.  The grain of the local tyrants remnants has been
 taken away.
 The youth of the masses of the East Route are brave, the Youth Corps is
 cowardly.
 Women have not struggled.
 "Everything must be divided, this is the farmers' consciousness."
 There [are] many wealthy farmers but few poor farmers in the tea hills.
 Failure to divide tea hills is to the benefit of the wealthy farmers.
 Village peoples' schools are also benefits of the wealthy farmers, inasmuch
 as the children of poor farmers have to work, so few of them attend school.
 Wealthy farmers order the masses to fight to protect the interests of the
 wealthy farmers.  The officers of the Hsin-feng Red Guards are all wealthy
 farmers.  "Seize names," "adjust fields," "fight butchers," "fines."
 With the slogan of protecting Red areas, the wealthy farmers of the north-
 western townships of Hsin.feng incite Red troops to desert and return home.
 The wealthy farmers are an obstacle to the expansion of the Red Army.
 The problem of preferential treatment for Red Army dependents.   In Yung-hsin,
 preferential treatment was not afforded to Red Army volunteers, and no
 assistance was provided in tilling their fields.   The dependents of those
 dispatched by the government were treated preferentially.
 Hsin-feng:  Those members of local Red defense units killed or wounded in
 action were treated preferentially.   Those killed or wounded in action in
 the 22d Army were ignored.   The wealthy farmers played tricks.
 Only wealthy farmers opposed freedom of marriage.   Saying "The farmers oppose
 it" is a lack of differentiation.
 At the Second Plenary Conference, eliminate farmers, cancel land reform.
 Li Wen-lin went to the Southern Route on 24 August.  He did not make a
 specialized report on land reform.  There was no specialized discussion.

 At the Southern Route Expanded Conference of 15 July, Ch'en Yi put forth eight
 principles such as immediate distribution of fields and harvesting of grain,
 taking from those with much to compensate those with little, taking the
 fertile to compensate for the infertile, unconditional distribution of
 housing, division of hills and woods, division of ponds, and so on, which
 were promulgated by the Southern Kiangsi Revolutionary Committee.
 The wealthy farmers of Jui-chin and Yu-tu [7184 6757], citing Article 14 of
 the "Western and Southern Kiangsi Land Law"--the original tiller should be
 the owner--spoke loudly of not violating the land law, but their violation
 was counterrevolution, even to the extent of "fighting."  The Revolutionary
 Committee had to issue this official announcement.
 There was some interaction between the two cooks at the Expanded Conference.
 "It's hereditary, so now he wants to be chairman too?"
 Afraid that the communists "won't talk, just chop off heads."
 "Even if you paid your rent in years past, this field can't be worked!"
 Red Army wives and freedom of marriage.
 "Will you serve in the Red Army?  If you serve in the Red Army, I cannot
 marry you."  "If people report that you have been killed in the Red Army,
 must I still observe the festivals for you?"  "Eight yuan for 80 catties of
 meat."  "Yesterday I went to him, today I go to the Chairman.   That's
 freedom."  "Reporting to the West River Combined Conference, Ch'en Chi-chung
 washed away the atmosphere of Ch'en Yi (After 9 days of meetings, Ch'en Yi
 had resolved a detailed land law.   Arriving on the tenth day, Ch'en Chih-chung
 cancelled it.)
 "Confiscation of the land of the landlords and dividing it equally is only
 a temporary measure rather than an objective, nor will it develop a land
 law of proletarian consciousness."
 Hsieh Han-ch'ang transmitted the message in the Northern Route:   "Using labor
 is the standard in the poor farmers' consciousness."
 The body strength of poor farmers does not equal that of wealthy farmers
 (poor farmers have nothing to eat); nor are the sons of poor farmers strong.
 Li Tui-ts'ung said, "At the Second Plenary Conference no one had a grasp
 [of the subject], so the land question could not be discussed."
 In the Western Route the message was transmitted (by Chou Kao-ch'ao):   "To
 divide everything is the poor farmers' consciousness."
 On 28 October an expanded conference was held at Hsin-feng by the Southern
 Route Mobil Commission, at which Kuo transmitted the message:   "Take the
 fertile to compensate for the infertile, make thoroughly equal distribution."
 Yet after a day and a half of meetings, it had not been discussed, and there
 was no resolution.

 The two lines of Southern Kiangsi (as stated by Chen Yi):
 "Yung-hsin is not the wealthy farmers' line.  I oppose," said Ma,
 "I don't agree with entering deeply into land reform," Tuan Liang-pi said
 to Ch'en Cheng-jen.
 "To expand and deepen simultaneously is the total farmer consciousness.
 "To fail to attack Chi.-an, and to attack Kiu-kiang later, will irrevocably
 lose the high tide of the Chinese revolution," so reported the Special
 Committee to the Central Committee.

 HARVEST DISTRIBUTION AND RENT PROBLEMS
 [Text] On 15 November 1930, the Kiangsi Provincial Mobile Committee held an
 expanded conference at Chi-an.   Besides members of the Provincial Committee
 and the Standing Committee, those-attending the conference included the
 chairman of the Yung-hsin, Chi-an, T'ai-ho, Wan-an, Chi-shui, An-fu, Fen-yi
 and Hsia-chiang soviets as well as Comrade Ch'en Yi of the 22d Army.   I
 participated in this conference as the representative of past committee
 members.  The special feature of this conference was the discussion of two
 problems:  harvest distribution and rent.  With regard to harvest distribu-
 tion, I brought up the mass basis of support for harvest distribution.
 With regard to the renting of land, the previously prevalent leftist but
 actually wealthy farmer theory of "Rent should not be collected in soviet
 areas" was overthrown.   In addition, the Chiang Han-po [3068 3352 3134]
 method of distribution according to labor was opposed by pointing out that
 its error lay in helping wealthy farmers while it was contrary to the
 interests of poor farmers.  This conference broke up prematurely because
 reactionary troops had already reached Hsia-chiang, and those responsible
 for the various counties had to return to prepare to deal with the enemy.
 Therefore such questions scheduled for discussion as "Mountain forests,"
 "Ponds," "Housing," "Fallow Fields," "Unemployment," and "Debt" were not
 discussed.  A serious enemy offensive and the Fu-t'ien Incident occurred
 after the conference.  So for this reason the resolutions of the conference
 have still not been promulgated.  What follows is a brief record made by
 me during the day's conference.   I retained it because it contained some
 important material.
 1.  Distribution of Fields in Ch'un.hua With the District as the Basic Unit
 The third distribution of fields in Ch'un-hua District (October 1930) had
 progressed to using the district as the basic unit, taking a census of
 population and production capacity to determine how much land each person
 should receive.   Then distribution was made within the scope of the town-
 ship, "shifting fields where possible and shifting people where fields
 could not be shifted."  Now the more than 30,000 persons in Ch'un-hua
 District have each received an equal amount of land (each person received
 land capable   of producing 11 shih of grain, with each shih equal to
 44 catties).

 2. Deficiencies of Distribution of Fields With the Village as the Basic Unit
 The deficiencies in using the village as the basic unit are:  (1) large
 villages are unwilling to give up fields to small villages; (2) with too
 many basic units, it is not easy for district and township governments to
 press [the program], so many concealed deficiencies developed; and (3) within
 a single village, it was easy for the masses to be hoodwinked through the use
 of surname-ism by landlords and wealthy farmers and not thoroughly divide
 land evenly, nor thoroughly combat local tyrants.   This view is worth noting.
 3.   The Land Struggle Cannot Be Deepened at a Stroke
 In the distribution of land, no matter how many times the land is divided, the
 wealthy farmers always conceal the good land the first time, making it
 impossible to investigate and to classify the land into the three grades:
 upper, middle and lower.  Wealthy farmers and middle farmers always lead the
 first time, while the poor farmers have no authority.   "After some period
 of unrest, the proletariat will arise."  This view is correct.
 4.  Yang Ch'eng-fu's [2799 2052 5346] Plan for "The Socialization of
 Agriculture"
 Yang Ch'eng-fu, chairman of the Chi-art County Government (originally chairman
 and secretary of Ch'un-hua District Committee), was determined to achieve
 common tilling and expenditure of [the proceeds of] the land in three steps:
 the first was to distribute land with the district as the basic unit, the
 second was to organize cooperatives and the third was to share in the tilling
 and expenditure.   This is completely erroneous.
 5.  The Chiang Han-po [3068 3352 3134] Style of Distribution According to Labor
 The deficiency of using labor as the basis for distribution of land is that
 orphans, widows, the elderly, infants, women with small [bound] feet,. and
 all people unable to till the land, would not have enough to eat.   Even poor
 farmers of great laboring capacity are no match for wealthy farmers because
 poor farmers do not have the oxen, farming implements and capital of the
 wealthy farmers.  In addition, wealthy farmers can lease the land of the
 orphaned, widowed, elderly, infants, women with small feet, and others.
 Therefore, using labor as the basis for distribution is of benefit only
 to wealthy farmers.
 The "Chiang Han-po Method" using labor as the basic unit was carried out in
 the "border areas" along An-fu's boundary with Chi-an and Fen-yi as well as
 in Yen-fu Township in Chi-an.  It was also carried out absolutely, regardless
 of age, distribution was made to those with the capacity for labor and not
 to those without it.   Distribution was made to vagrants.   Those with no
 capacity for labor would receive food from the farming of those with the
 capacity for labor.  A member of the Political Committee of the Third Army
 Group who carne to Chi-an said to Wang Huai [3769 2037) that the land

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 distribution method on the border of Hunan, Hupeh and Kiangsi took labor
 as the basic unit, with those with no capacity for labor receiving a half-
 share, and with nothing furnished by the government.
 When labor is used as the basic unit for distribution, the wealthy farmers,
 with much land, need to use their oxen, plows and harrows themselves, so
 the poor farmers cannot even borrow them.   It is only by equal distribution
 that poor farmers will be able to borrow the excess farming implements of
 the wealthy farmers, therefore the poor farmers demand equal distribution.
 6.   Harvest Distribution Problems
 Part of the farmers of Jui-chin and Yu-tu [7184 6757] upheld the slogan
 of the Ting-chou [3060 1558] Conference:   "Unconditional distribution of
 the harvest"; while others upheld the slogan of the Pi-t'ou [7095 7333]
 Conference:  "Do not distribute green young sprouts"; and the pretext was:
 "Do not break the Land Law."
 Land was distributed in the county of the Northern Route in May of this year.
 Compensation was provided for capital and for original tillers at the rate
 of 600 cash per shih of grain [capacity].   In Fu-t'ien the wealthy farmers
 were not compensated for their land while poor farmers received a string of
 cash per tan of grain for their land.
 Land was distributed in Ch'un-hua in March, at which. time no planting had
 been done, plowing had been done only once and fertilizer had been spread
 in a few cases.   After distribution no compensation was paid for capital.
 On the Northern Route, compensation of 600 cash or a string of cash was paid
 for capital'on each shih of grain.  Before May, the county had resolved that
 the price of grain would be 4 strings [of cash] per shih, with compensation
 paid at the rate of one-sixth or one quarter.  Land had not yet been distri-
 buted at the time, and it was a period of famine, so prescribing the price
 of grain at 4 strings was intended to help the poor farmers by equalizing
 the price of grain,  After the harvest, however, the price was still fixed
 at 4 strings per shih. "This is incorrect."
 In Yung-hsin during the fifth month of the old calendar last year, the
 government of the Fifth District of the Northwestern Special Area prescribed
 that land distribution would take place when the early grain crop was about
 to ripen.   Persons entering land would compensate those leaving the land
 1 yuan "big money" for every 2 tan of grain (200 catties, which is a shih
 of land).   Rice is harvested once a year.   In May, when the seedlings have
 just been transplanted, the rice is still not fully grown, so persons leaving
 the land were compensated a string of cash for each shih of land (2 tan of
 grain).   The County Committee had decided that land would be received without
 compensation, but because of restricted communications, the Fifth District
 did not receive the direction of the County Committee, and therefore proceeded
 according to its own decision.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 The wealthy farmers in the eastern townships of Yu-tu and the northwestern
 part of Kung County requested compensation of 2 Yuan "small money" (worth
 4 strings) for each piece of land producing a shih of grain (actually only
 8 tou). The party prohibited this and land was received without compensa-
 tion.
 A legitimate policy should be:  "To receive land without compensation, and
 to divide both land and harvest."  Equal distribution would be made for
 uniform application to family members of landlords,  Assessments should be
 made separately against landlords who have much money.  Vagrants should
 receive equal distribution because they work hard.   The wealthy farmers'
 opposition to vagrants' sharing the harvest is wrong.  Middle farmers,
 not having much land to be distributed, would not be affected.  Although
 the "top layer of poor farmers" which tills much land would be affected,
 there will be other benefits to compensate them.   The broad masses of the
 low level poor farmers, manual laborers and tenant farmers support this
 method 100 percent.  After the distribution of the harvest, those not having
 the strength to cultivate their land would be permitted to follow the rental
 method.
 7.   Consolidating Original Tillers for Equal Distribution
 In the past, using the "village" and "family" as the basic unit and the
 original tiller as the criterion for equal distribution, resulted in benefit
 for the wealthy farmers but not for the poor farmers.   The legitimate way
 should be:   taking the township as the basic unit according to the total
 population of the township divided by the total of the original tillers of
 land in the entire township (total township population is the total of those
 who originally tilled land in the village as well as those who originally
 tilled land in other villages), taking from those with much to compensate
 those with little, taking the fertile to compensate for the infertile,
 shifting land when it can be shifted (villages with more land would give
 part of their land to villages with less land).  When land cannot be shifted,
 move people (when distances are great, there is no way to shift land, so
 people must be moved).  This method is called "Distribution by Consolidating
 Original Tillers."
 8.   The Non-laboring Population and the New Land Rental System
 When people without the capacity for labor rent their land to those with
 laboring capacity to farm, the tenant hands over grain as rent to the owner.
 In Ch'un-hua, Wan-an and Hsin-yu four-tenths was handed over; in Fen-yi
 and Ning-tu five-tenths was handed over; and in Yung-hsin one-third was
 handed over.   The land in Fu-t'ien (a district of Chi-an) was divided into
 three classes--upper, middle and lower.   For the upper class four-tenths
 was handed over, for the middle class three-tenths, and for the lower class
 two-tenths was handed over.   This appears to be comparatively reasonable.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 In Ch'un-hua, An-fu, T'ai-he, Hsin-yu, Fen-yi and Hsia-chiang, those without
 the capacity for labor who wish to rent their land comprise about 20 percent
 of the population.   In Ning-tu they comprise over 20 percent because of the
 number of women with small [bound] feet.   In Yung-hsin they comprise only
 5 percent because the women all have big [unbound] feet, and the renters
 are mostly widowed, orphaned, crippled, aged, very young or engaged in
 revolutionary work.   The above refers only to that portion of the population
 in which the entire family lacks the capacity for labor and must rent its
 land.   There are even more of the population who do not have the capacity for
 labor but who have family members who can farm the land, and thus do not
 have to rent their land.   Generally speaking, 75 percent of the entire popu-
 lation does not have the capacity for labor, that is, only one out of every
 four persons is a young man strong enough to till the land--this is China's
 big problem.  This so-called lack of laboring capacity, however, refers to
 actual tilling of the land.  About half of them have a partial capacity for
 such labor as tending cattle, chopping wood, cooking rice, washing clothes
 and preparing food.   Statistically:
 25    percent--have full capacity for labor
 37.5.percent--have half-capacity or some capacity for labor
 37.5 percent--have no capacity at all for labor.
 The "Renting Land for Grain" in all the above-mentioned areas is the so-called
 "Grain Distribution System" except for Ch'un.-hua's, which is the. "Rental
 System."  The deficiency in the grain distribution system is that those renting
 land [from others] emphasize their own land, and invest effort and fertilizer
 haphazardly in the landowner's land.  When the grain is ripe, it is shared
 according to the amount harvested, equally, or on a four-to-six or other
 ratio.   This system is not beneficial to the owner of the rented land.  With
 the rental system, the rent is fixed without regard to the amount harvested.
 Therefore the tenant is attentive to the expenditure of effort and fertilizer,
 which is of benefit to both production and the owner of the land.
 The deficiencies of the rental system are:
 (1)   Fixed rent is detrimental to the tenant in disaster years.
 (2)   It is also detrimental to the tenant when Red Guard units are called
 out for many farming days and farming is reduced.
 In summary, the grain distribution system is of benefit to the wealthy
 farmers, while the rental system is of benefit to the poor farmers.
 A legitimate policy would be as follows:
 (1)   Should poor farmers, tenant farmers and the unemployed lack oxen,
 farming implements or capital after receiving land, the government should
 distribute surplus oxen, farming implements and other items confiscated

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 from wealthy farmers and landlords to the tenant farmers, poor farmers, the
 unemployed and others for their own farming.  At the same time, the collective
 use of such implements should be rewarded, and some items confiscated from
 wealthy farmers and landlords given to cooperatives.  Yet another method is
 for individuals to borrow oxen and farming implements temporarily from
 wealthy farmers for support, with the government controlling those wealthy
 farmers who wilfully fail to lend their things, so as to help the poor
 farmers, tenant farmers and the unemployed.
 (2)   Those totally unable to till the land should be permitted to rent their
 land to wealthy and middle farmers to till under the following conditions:
 (a)  Abolish the grain distribution system, prescribing a fixed rental,
 with no reduction for disasters.
 (b)  Prescribe the minimum rental (50 percent) to preclude excessive
 exploitation of poor and tenant farmers by wealthy farmers.
 (c)  Do not permit wealthy farmers to use the pretext of farming only
 their own land and not that of others.  Should a wealthy farmer be willing
 to rent land, the township government should take all land which must be
 rented and distribute it among the wealthy and middle farmers of the township,
 forcing them to farm it.
 9.   The Problem of Unemployed Workers From Cities Requesting Land
 Over 200 unemployed masons and carpenters in the city of T'ai-he [3141 07351
 requested that land be distributed to them, but received none.  They were
 from outside counties and the farmers of the city area would not permit land
 to be distributed to them.   The sugar cane workers from outside Nan-men City
 also requested the distribution of land.  This problem also occurred in
 Hsing-kuo [5281 0948].
 This problem deserves careful and deliberate consideration.

 [Text] On 18 November 1930, the Red Army abandoned Chi-an.  On the 19th I
 went with Comrades Ku Pai [0657 2672] and Hsieh Wei-chun [6200 0787 0193]
 from Chi-an to Heng-t'ien [5899 3944], which belongs to Yung-feng [3057 6265],
 to meet with the Main Force of the Red Army.  Passed through Shui-nan
 [3055 0589] to Pai-sha [4101 3097], ate lunch at Mu-k'ou [2606 0656] Village,
 and investigated the composition of the members of the village government
 and the reactionary elements killed in this village.  This investigation
 proved that, in the equal distribution of land, the middle farmers not only
 do not lose but even gain; and that wealthy farmers and small landlords,
 in the intense struggle of the farmers, will go over to the counterrevolu-
 tionary camp.
 Mu-k'ou Village of the 8th Township, Shui-nan District, Chi-shui [0679 3055]
 County
 There are 200 people in the entire village.
 There are 46 able-bodied adults, all of whom have been enrolled in Red Guards
 units.
 The village government is established. in the ancestral hall'.
 There are nine functionaries in the village government:  Chairman, Secretary,
 Committee Member for Land, Committee Member for Social Insurance, Committee
 Member for Red Guards, Committee Member for Food, Committee Member for
 Adjudication, Committee Member for Women, and Committee Member for Youth.
 Chairman Liu Hsing-nan [0491 5281 0589]  (small landlord), two persons to feed, has
 56 shih of land (each shih of land produces 3 baskets of grain and each
 basket of land 10 catties).   Farms over 10 shih and rents 40 shih.   Because
 of his liking for gambling, he has no money to lend.   During this distribu-
 tion of land, most of his land was given up.   Secretary P'eng Chia-fa
 [1756 1367 4099] (middle farmer) eight persons to feed, has land for
 48 shih of grain and rented [from others] over 20 shih more [of land], has
 enough to eat, and has no debts.  By this distribution each person received

 7 shih and 8 tou, totaling 64 shih; thus he received 16 shih in the distribu-
 tion,  proof that middle farmers receive land in the distribution.  Committee
 Member for Land Liu Hsing-wen [0491 5281 2429] (poor farmer), three persons to feed,
 land for 10 shih of grain, and not enough to eat.  He received 14 shah in
 this distribution, and in the past had debts of 60 yuan.  "Committee Member
 for Social Insurance" Wu K'ai-lien [0124 7030 6647] (poor farmer), has four
 persons to feed, 16 shih of grain land, not enough to eat, and rented over
 20 shih from others.  He received 15 shih and 2 tou in this distribution,
 and had debts in the past.   Committee Member for Red Guards P'eng Chia-hsiung
 [1756 1367 0338] (middle farmer), one person to feed in the past, 12 shih
 .of grain land, sold 6 shih to repay high-interest debts, leaving 6 shih which
 gave him enough to eat.  He also worked as a day laborer,  had no wife,
 and could not feed pigs.   Liking to gamble, he had debts of 30 yuan.  After
 the revolution, he "acquired" a wife.   The wife brought with her a 13-year-,
 old son and a 13-year-old daughter-in-law.  Now, with four people to receive
 distribution of land, each person receiving 7 shih and 8 tou, they receive
 a total of 31 shih and 2 tou.   Speaking in terms of the individual, originally
 having only 6 shih and now receiving 7 shih and 8 tou, an increase of 1 shih
 and 8 tou, is another proof of middle farmers receiving land from the distri-
 bution.  Committee Member for Food Hsu Chuan-chang [1776 0278 4545] (poor
 farmer), one person to feed, had only 2 shih of grain land, which was not
 enough and he had to work as a day laborer.   Now he has received through
 the distribution 5 shih and 8 tou, and still does not have a wife.  Chairman
 P'eng [sic] Hsing-nan also serves as Committee Member for Adjudication.
 Committee Member for Women Yang Chiu-ying [2799 0046 5391] (middle farmer),
 five persons to feed, has 50 shih of grain land.  With her husband and her
 father farming, there is enough to eat but no excess, and she has no debts.
 From this distribution, she received 6 shih of grain land--another proof of
 middle farmers receiving land through distribution.   Of the above seven
 functionaries of the village government, one a small landlord, three middle
 farmers and three poor farmers, all middle farmers received land through the
 distribution.
 Revolution began in this village the year before last, and land was distributed
 in January of this year (distribution was from Tung-ku [2639 0942] District--
 this village previously belonged to Tung-ku).  All members of the village
 government feed themselves, and the revolution came along without arousing
 violent opposition.
 A total of seven reactionaries have been killed in this village:  P'eng
 Chia-kuang [1756 1367 0342], P'eng Chia-shan [1756 1367 0810], P'eng Chia-
 chun [1756 1367 0193], P'eng Pei-chun [1756 0971], P'eng Ch'ang-lung [1756
 2490 7127], P'eng Ch'ang-hsi [1756 2490 4406], and Wen Chih-kuei [3306
 1807 6311].   P'eng Chia-kuang (small landlord), three persons to feed, had
 over 30 shih of grain land, was proprietor of a cloth shop in Shui-nan,
 rented his land to others to farm and collected the rent.  Business was
 bad in the shop, which lost money every year.  Handled the collection of
 taxes of the 38th Tu and sought profit in so doing.  Smoked opium, a scholar
 and a very villainous member of the gentry.   P'eng Chia-shan (wealthy

 farmer), younger brother of Chia-kuang, five persons to feed, had over 40 shih
 of grain land, and had money to lend.  Saddened because of the cancellation
 of debts, he joined with Honan bandits, and was captured and killed along
 with his elder brother in July of last year.   P'eng Chia-chun [1756 1367
 0193] (vagrant), three persons to feed, had no land and owed debts to
 others. Joining the revolution, he served as adjutant in the Tung-ku
 guerrillas.   He also served as executive officer and quartermaster.   Later
 he deserted, acquired three guns and became a bandit, preying on local
 tyrants.  He was captured last year and killed.   He liked to play cards.
 P'eng P'ei-chun (wealthy farmer),four persons to feed, had 120 shih of
 land, which he employed two old persons to farm, and also rented one-half
 to others to farm.  He had money to lend,  When the masses divided the land
 and burned [land] titles, he was unwilling and was killed.  P'eng Ch'ang-
 lung (small landlord), four persons to feed, had 60 shih of land, all of
 which was rented to others to farm.   Lent peppermint oil money, lent jute
 money.   A scholar, taught school in Chi-shui County.  Went with the Honan
 bandits, was captured on the front line and killed.   P'eng Chang-hsi
 (small landlord), three persons to feed, P'eng Chang-lung's younger brother,
 60 shih of land, lent peppermint oil and jute money, receiving three baskets
 of grain in return for each yuan lent, killed in March the year before last.
 Wen Chih-kuei (wealthy farmer), seven persons to feed, 30 shih of grain land,
 rented over 100 shih, besides his own labor, he hired an old person and many
 day laborers,  did not lend money, but engaged in small business carrying
 ducks and oil seeds to sell.  He plotted with the Honan bandits to leak
 information of the revolution and was killed.   (The so-called Honan bandits
 were part of the Honanese who had moved to Chi-shui County in Kiangsi,
 some of whom became bandits.)
 The above seven reactionary elements who were killed--three small landlords,
 three wealthy farmers and one vagrant-.?proved that, when land reform deepens,
 many small landlords and wealthy farmers will move in the direction of
 counterrevolution.  Whether every one of these seven persons should have
 been killed, however, is a question.

 LAND LAW PROMULGATED BY CHINESE REVOLUTIONARY MILITARY COMMISSION (1930)
 [Text] Chapter I.   Confiscation and Distribution of Land
 Article 1.   After rising up and overthrowing the regime of the evil gentry
 and landlord class, all private and group-owned--ancestral halls of the evil
 gentry and landlords, temple [religious] institutions and wealthy farmers--
 land and fields, mountains and forests, ponds and houses, must immediately
 be confiscated and turned over to public ownership by the soviet governments
 for distribution to farmers with little or no land and other poor people who
 need it for their use.   In areas where there are only farmers' associations,
 where soviets have not been established, the farmers' associations may also
 carry out the confiscation and distribution.
 Article 2.   After investigation by the soviets, family members of evil gentry
 and landlords and reactionaries will be permitted to live in the villages,
 and those with no other means of making a living may receive distribution
 of an appropriate amount of land.
 Article 3..  Distribution of land will be made according to regulations to
 officers and soldiers serving in the Red Army as well as to those engaged
 in revolutionary work.   The soviets will also assign people to assist their
 family members in farming.
 Article 4.   Those in industry and commerce in villages who can make their
 living will not receive land.   Those who cannot make a living will receive
 an appropriate amount of land limited to that necessary to compensate for
 the deficiency and permit them to make.a living.
 Article 5.   Land must be distributed to tenant farmers and unemployed
 wanderers who wish to have land distributed to them.   Those wanderers who
 receive land, however, must break themselves of opium, gambling and other
 evil addictions, otherwise the soviets will recover their land.
 Article 6.  Those living away from their home villages will not receive land.
 Article 7. The township shall be the basic unit for the distribution of land.
 The farmers of a township will put together for common distribution all land
 tilled by them in their own township as well as in neighboring townships.

 Should there be three or four adjoining townships in which some townships
 have more land and some less, they will be considered a single township
 for distribution.  Those townships with so little land as to be incapable
 of maintaining their livelihood, and which have no other means of production
 to maintain their livelihood, may combine three or four townships into one
 unit for distribution, but the township soviet must request and receive
 authorization from the district soviet.
 Article 8.   To meet the demands of the majority, and to expedite the receipt
 of land by farmers, men, women, old and young should receive equal distribu-
 tion according to village population.   The distribution method based on labor
 as the criterion should not be adopted.
 Article 9.   In principle, city merchants and workers will not receive land.
 When possible, however, appropriate amounts of land will be distributed to
 unemployed workers and poor people from cities who request it.
 Article 10.  To seek speedy destruction of feudal influences and to attack
 wealthy farmers, the distribution of land should be in accordance with the
 principle of taking from those with much to compensate those with little and
 taking the fertile to compensate for the infertile.   Landlords and wealthy
 farmers should not be permitted to conceal land, not reporting it, nor
 to monopolize fertile land.  After the distribution of land, wooden signs
 prescribed by the soviets will be erected in the fields, with the amount of
 production from the field and the present tiller inscribed thereon.
 Article 11.  All deeds covering land of evil gentry and landlords, wealthy
 farmers, and ancestral halls and temples shall be handed over within a
 limited period to township soviets or to township or district farmers'
 associations, and burned publicly.
 Article 12.  After the distribution of land, county soviets or district
 soviets shall issue farming certificates.
 Article 13.  Whenever anyone in a township dies, changes his occupation, or
 departs, the land distributed to him shall revert to the soviet for redis-
 tribution.                             When anyone arrives from outside the township or is born in the
 township, the soviet should find a way to distribute land to that person,
 but subsequent to the harvest.
 Article 14.  When land is distributed after an uprising and it is after plant-
 ing by farmers, the production from the field shall be harvested by the
 farmer receiving the field, and the original tiller may not keep it [the
 production or harvest].
 Article 15.  Vegetable gardens, dams and fallow land (where miscellaneous
 grains can be planted) must be distributed.   Large ponds not suitable for
 distribution shall be operated by the soviet or rented for a fixed price.

 Article 16.   Bamboo [producing] and lumber [producing] hills should be divided
 for calculation purposes into fields according to their production and combined
 with fields for distribution.   Those with the characteristics of industrial
 capital [plant or equipment], employing labor, establishing factories and
 manufacturing, however, may be rented as entities and need not be distributed.
 Article 17.   Pine, fir and other mountain forests will be managed or rented
 by the soviets.  When authorized by the soviet, however, and when the people
 of the township need to use wood for repairing embankments, constructing
 public facilities and houses, and for repairing buildings burned by the
 reactionaries, they may take wood from the forests.
 Article 18.   Hills producing firewood will be managed by the soviet govern-
 ments for public use.
 Article 19.   To meet the requirements of poor farmers, all confiscated land
 should be distributed to them, and it need not be retained by the soviets.
 Under certain conditions, however, that portion of the land which cannot
 be completely distributed may be used to establish model farms or be rented
 temporarily.  At the same time a portion of such buildings should be retained
 for public enterprises.
 Chapter II.   Cancellation of Debts
 Article 20.   All debts owed by workers, farmers and poor people to the evil
 gentry and landlords and rich peasants shall not be repaid, and all bonds

 merchants to the government or to workers, farmers or poor people must be
 repaid in full.
 Article 22.   Old trading accounts owed by workers, farmers and poor people
 to merchants prior to the uprising, irrespective of whether they were
 commercial or high-interest, or whether they were personal accounts, shall
 not be repaid.
 Article 23.   In principle, with respect to accounts incurred. by workers,
 farmers and poor people among themselves, what was borrowed prior to the
 uprising shall not be repaid.   This excludes only no-interest loans made
 with the objective of friendly assistance, and which the borrower is willing
 to repay.
 Article 24.   Wherever workers, farmers and poor people have pawned or mortgaged
 articles or houses to evil gentry and landlords, wealthy farmers or pawn-
 brokers, the items given as security shall be recovered unconditionally.

 Article 25.   Financial associations and grain associations shall all be dis-
 banded.
 Article 26.   Under the soviet regime, high-interest loans are prohibited.
 County soviets will prescribe appropriate interest rates according to the
 monetary situation in the local area.   The rates should not, however, exceed
 that received from ordinary capital under the general economic conditions
 in the area.
 Chapter III.  Land Tax
 Article 27.   To meet requirements for overthrowing the counterrevolutionaries
 (such as to expand the Red Army and Red Guard units, to support governmental
 organizations, etc.), and requirements to further the interests of the
 masses (such as establishing schools and dispensaries; aiding the crippled,
 the aged and infants; repairing roads and embankments, etc.), the soviets
 may levy land taxes on farmers.
 Article 28.   In keeping with the principle of protecting poor farmers and
 joining with middle farmers to attack wealthy farmers, land taxes may be
 levied only after soviets have been established, the masses have realized
 practical benefits, and the higher-level soviet has approved.
 Article 29.   Land taxes will be levied by classes according to the annual
 harvest of grain from the land distributed to the farmers.
 1.   Each person who received distributed land who harvests less than
 5 tan of grain shallbe exempt from land taxes.
 2.   Each person who received distributed land who harvests 6 tan of
 grain will be taxed 1 percent.
 3.   Each person who received distributed land who harvests 7 tan of
 grain will be taxed 1.5 percent.

 grain will be taxed 4 percent.
 6.   Each person who received distributed land who harvests 10 tan of
 grain will be taxed 5.5 percent.
 7.   Each person who received distributed land who harvests 11 tan of
 grain will be taxed   No percentage listed.
 8.   Each person who received distributed land who harvests 12 tan of

 For each additional tan of grain harvested, an additional 1.5 percent in
 land taxes shall be collected,
 Article 30.  Income and expenditures from land taxes must be centralized at
 the high-level soviet government.   Lower-level governments may not collect
 and disburse freely.  Expenditure standards shall be determined by the high-
 level government according to the amount of revenue and the urgency and
 significance of the requirements of the governments at various levels.
 Chapter IV.  Wages
 Article 31.  Wages of handicraft industry workers and tenant farmers in
 farming villages which have been too low in the past should be raised.
 Henceforth, wages shall be determined by the soviets according to two
 standards--the rise or fall of prices of commodities and the abundance or
 paucity of farmers' income.   County or provincial soviets must approve
 wages prescribed by township soviets.

 26 January 1931
 [Text] In September 1930 the Red lst Army returned to Kiangsi following its
 attack on Changsha.  In early October after breaking through Chi-an it entered
 the Yuan River Valley where many peasants came from Hsing-kuo to join the
 ranks of the Red Army.   I took this opportunity to conduct an investigation
 of the 10th (Yung-feng) District in Hsing-kuo County.   I got together and
 held fact-finding meetings with eight persons, namely, Fu Chi-t'ing,
 Li Ch'ang-ying, Wen Feng-chang, Ch'en Chen-shan, Chung Te-wu, Huang Ta-ch'un,
 Ch'en Pei-p'ing and Lei Han-hsiang.   The investigation was undertaken at
 the end of October 1930 with Lo-fang, Hsin-yu County as the meeting place
 where a series of fact-finding meetings were held for a full week.  Yung-feng
 District is situated at the intersection of three adjoining counties.of
 Hsing-kuo, Kan-hsien and Wan-an.   It is divided into four townships, of
 which the old Ling-yuan District is the 1st, Tung-chiang the 2d, Shan-k'eng
 the 3d and Chiang-t'uan the 4th, with Yung-feng-yu of the 2d township as
 the political.and economic center of this district.   The distribution of
 population is as follows:   the lst township has 3,000 people, the 2d 800,
 the 3d 3,000 and the 4th 4,000, so the total population of this district
 is 8,800.   Because this district is bounded by the three counties of
 Hsing-kuo, Kan-hsien and Wan-an, so if the situation in this district is
 well understood, there is not much difference in that of the other two
 counties.   In fact, conditions of struggle for land are not much different
 in the whole region of southern Kiangsi.   Practical policy must be deter-
 mined on the basis of actual conditions.                       Things which you sit around the
 house imagining about or which you read from sketchy written reports are
 definitely not those based on actual conditions.   It is dangerous to base
 decision of policy on reports which were either unrealistic or "believed
 to be true."  In the past many mistakes were made in the Red areas because
 the leadership of the party had not been in keeping with actual conditions.
 It is, therefore, most essential to make detailed scientific investigations
 based on actual conditions.   Generally speaking, this investigation is still
 not penetrating enough even though it is more so compared with those made
 on previous occasions.   First, I have made an investigation of eight families,
 something which I have never attempted before.   The truth is that without

 this kind of investigation it is impossible to have basic ideas about the
 rural areas.   Second, I have tried to find out the manifestations of land
 struggle among various classes of people in Hsun:wu but my investigation
 is not complete.   The shortcomings of this investigation are that I have
 not included in it the situations of the children and women, the situations
 of exchange and comparison of commodity prices, the situations in farm pro-
 duction after the land distribution, and the cultural situations.  All these
 aspects were intended to be investigated had it not been for the enemy
 attack on Lo-fang.   Because the Red Army had decided on the policy of luring
 the enemy deep into our area, we were forced to conclude our fact-finding
 meetings.  The data given below was gathered in this way:   I drew in an
 outline of investigation, then everyone was asked questions followed by a
 discussion; all conclusions were submitted by me; after they were agreed
 to by the eight comrades I put them down in writing.   On some points no
 conclusions were reached, but their answers were described.   Our fact-
 finding meetings had been  lively and interesting.  Two or three meetings
 were held every day with some lasting into the late night  but they did not
 feel tired.   For this we should be deeply grateful to these comrades.   Some
 participants are members of the Communist Party but the majority of them
 are not.
 I.   A Survey of Eight Families
 1,   Fu Chi-t'ing
 A native of the 1st township of the 10th District.  He runs a small butcher
 shop but has no capital.   There are five persons to be fed.   He has a rice
 field of 23 shih (piculs) on which 3 shih must be paid as rent leaving him
 with a balance of 20.shih.   Now each of the five persons eats 7 shih totaling
 35 shih resulting in a shortage of 15 shih which must be made up by the
 business in his butcher shop.  He can make a profit of about 1.30 yuan for
 each pig slaughtered (there are no more large pigs to be killed so he can
 only earn about 0.50 yuan per pig killed).   The five persons are:   father,
 80 years old; wife cooks, raises pigs, makes firewood, washes and mends
 clothes, but tills no field; son, 5 years old; daughter, 1 year old; and him-
 self, 39, tilling field and slaughtering pigs.   In addition to his own, he
 rents another field of 5 shih but has to hire someone to help him till it
 for 1 month every year.   His mother died 5 years ago.  He spent over 100 yuan
 for her burial.   Apart from his brother's contributing share, he has to go
 into debt for 50 small yuan which with compound interest added had already
 come to 150 yuan this year.   Out of the 23 shih of rice field, 17 shih were
 owned by himself,'and 6 shih were "t'ui-chiao-t'inn" belonging to the
 public lands of Chung-wu in Pai-lu (a subdivision of Kan-hsien, 10 li from
 the 1st township of. the 10th District).   For 6 shih of this public field
 he had to pay 6 small yuan per shih totaling 36 yuan as mortgage money.   In
 addition, he must deliver 3 shih as land rent every year (at the rate of
 50 percent).

 In March last year when the revolution failed, he fled into the hills of
 Chun-ts'un helping people repair them.  In September he returned home with
 the arrival of the Red Army in Hsing-kuo when the jackals of the Pacification
 Corps ran away into the hills.   There was no land distribution then.
 In February (March by solar calendar) the Red Army attacked Kan-chou and
 in the same month land was distributed.   Although he did not get any land,
 he was relieved from the payment of his rent of 3 shih and his debt of
 150 yuan.  At the same time he did not get back his mortgage money of 36 yuan.
 From February he served for 3 months as chief of land section in the town
 government assisting in distributing land to the people.   In April he became
 a company commander of the Red Guards equipped with spears but no guns.  He
 served for 3 months.  On 15 June he led his unit in one attack against
 the jackals of the Pacification Corps in Hsing-kuo County.   From June the
 Red Guards were reorganized into a reserve contingent of the Red Army in
 which he became a platoon leader.  A month or so later he was made a company
 commander.   At this time two companies were formed in the 1st township. In
 August he led his unit to attack Ch'i-fang and won a victory.   During the
 march (in October by solar calendar) on Hsin-yu he served as a batallion
 commander.   Because he was unable to leave production and because his meat
 accounts were not collected so that he could pay back to others, he wanted
 to go home and did not wish to serve in the Red Army.
 He had a schooling of 6 years and can barely read newspapers.
 2.  Li Ch'ang-ying
 A native of P'ang-wu-t'ung in the 1st township of the 10th district.
 There were six persons.   He himself, 48,tills fields.  His wife, also 48, has
 aching heart, cooks, washes clothes and feeds pigs.  His son, 20, tills fields
 but is stupid and unable to read.   His daughter-in-law, 20, makes firewood
 daily but cannot till fields.  His daughter, 12, was married off in June
 this year to someone in Wu-wa, 40 li away.   His second son, 3, died in April
 this year.   There are only four persons to be fed.
 He himself is owner of 30 tan (piculs) of rice fields.   From his younger
 brother Li Ch'ang-feng he borrowed another field of 20 tan.   Because
 Li Ch'ang-feng's field was of poor quality and did not yield enough to meet
 his expenses he went to T'ai-ho and Lo..k'ang to farm for others.
 Li Ch'ang-ying's own field of 20 tan could yield only 13 tan of rice because
 water could not be pumped into it but he had to pay 9 tan of rent.
 Li Ch'ang-feng owed a debt of 120 yuan and 9 tan of rice as rent.  He paid
 interest on them for Ch'ang-feng.  As for his own 30-tan field, he could
 only reap 17 tan because it was a hilly land situated on a broken cliff.
 Coupled with Ch'ang-feng's actual yield of 4 tan, his total harvest came
 to 21 tan.   Besides they were all paddy rice (rough rice) which when
 converted into dried rice at a 30 percent discount totaled 15 tan, at
 best 17 tan in a good harvest year.   Six persons need 40 tan of rice a
 year.   Thus there was a shortage of more than one-half which must be made

 up by his sweet potato harvest of 30 tan or so a year.  He fed a pig until
 December when he sold it for money with which he bought oil and salt for
 home use.   No meat can be had in ordinary times.   It is bought and served
 only during festive occasions such as Ch'ing-ming (Tomb-sweeping festival,
 40 cents), Shih-t'ien (Planting crops, 1.5 yuan), Tuan-wu (Dragon boat
 festival, 30 cents), Chi'ih-hsin (Eating new rice, 1 yuan), Ch'ih-yueh-pan
 (the 15th day of the 7th moon, a ghost festival, 20-30 cents), Chung-ch'iu
 (Mid-moon festival, 20-30 cents), Ke-ho (Harvesting festival, 2 yuan),
 and Kuo-nien (New Year festival, 3 yuan).   During Ch'ih-hsin 1 yuan's worth
 of meat has to be served because field hands must be hired to plant sweet
 potatoes.   During Shih-t'ien and Ko-ho helping hands must be hired, tota-;_ng
 20 man-days a year.   Father and son, apart from working in their own field,
 must help younger brother Ch'ang-feng till his 20-tan field.   This would
 cost him every year 80 man-days of hired labor (for each tan of rice a good
 field needs 3 man-days of hired labor while a poor one, 4).   The death of
 his younger brother Ch'ang-feng left his wife a widow.   She adopted his
 (Ch'ang-ying's) second son as her own.  As these 80 man-days of labor cannot
 be paid for, he has to work his own as well as his sister-in-law's fields
 so that there is no time left for him to work for other people.
 He owed a debt of 120 yuan to the public granary for which he must give
 7.50 shih of rice as interest (for each 160 yuan borrowed 1 shih of rice
 must be paid as interest valued at 2.4 yuan).   At the end of each year he
 sold pigs for 20 or more yuan.   Out of this sum he spent 6 or 7 yuan to buy
 oil and salt and the balance was paid to the public granary after conversion
 into rice as interest.   The old and new public granaries of this village each
 have 30 or more shih of rice totaling 70 shih.
 In March this year land was distributed with each of the six persons getting
 7 shih totaling 42 shih.   All of Ch'ang-feng's land was awarded to Ch'ang-ying.
 Ch'ang-feng's old debt on which Ch'ang-ying had paid interest was erased.
 His own debt of 120 yuan to the public granary was also erased.   The 42 shih
 of rice field is infertile and can only reap a harvest of 40 percent
 totaling 25 shih or so.    This coupled with his sweet potato crop is barely
 sufficient to keep the family fed.
 In August this year the authorities of southwest Kiangsi ordered a re-dis-
 tribution of land on the principle of taking out some fertile land to com-
 pensate for the barren.                         In his family a son died and a daughter had been
 married off.   Only four persons are left now and each is given 6 shih 1 t'ung
 (4 t'ung make 1 shih).   Some of his barren lands were given to others while
 he got some fertile ones owned by others.   On this occasion land was divided
 equally and evenly.   In March each person was awarded 7 tan whereas in
 August he was only given 6 shih 1 t'ung.  Why?  The reason is that following
 the victory of the revolution. 12 of the P'eng-wu-t'ung peasants who went to
 T'ai-ho to farm land earlier had come back by this time.   There was then no
 revolution in T'ai-ho.   When they heard about the revolution in Hsing-kuo
 and its land distribution they all came back.  This is why the people were
 given less land in this village than in others on a per capita  basis.

 P'eng-wu-t'ung has only four family surnames of Yi, Li Ch'iu and Cheng,
 numbering 130 or more people.   It has no village government.
 Li Ch'ang-ying did little work in the town government.   His son Li Ch'uan-po
 was in charge of weapons (spears, bird guns, swords, etc.) in the town govern-
 ment.  His son took part in attacks on Hsing-kuo and Liang-k'ou.  He himself
 participated in attacks on Ch'i-fang and Nanchang.  He is willing to serve
 in the Red Army but must ask for 1 month's leave so that he can go home and
 buy a calf to help till his field.   On 27 June his ox died from a fall.  He
 bought it 2 years ago for 23 yuan.   After his ox died he sold it for beef
 and got 10 yuan.   In June he spent 12 yuan to buy another calf.but in July
 it also died from a fall.  He sold it for beef for 8 yuan (which he had not
 yet collected).  He must buy another calf to help him till his field.   This
 is why he must ask for 1 month's home leave before he can come back to serve
 in the Red Army.
 "Thanks to the kindness of the Red Army," an ox for which one had to pay
 70 yuan can now be bought for 20 yuan.   "Thanks to the kindness of the Red
 Army," prices on everything are reasonable now.   In the past edible oil cost
 23 yuan for 1 tan (100 chin), now it.is only 10 yuan per tan.  Rice used to
 cost 4 yuan per shih, now it costs l"yuan per shih (3 coppers can buy 1 sheng
 of rice).   Firewood used to sell for 20 coppers per chin, now it only costs
 8 coppers per chin.  Meat which had been sold for 530 coppers per chin before
 is now sold for 320 coppers per chin.   Only the price of salt and cotton
 cloth has become very high.   Salt was sold for 320 coppers per chin, now
 it is 800 coppers per chin.   White cotton cloth used to sell for 140 coppers
 per ch'ih, now it costs 320 coppers per chi'ih.
 3.  Wen Feng-chang
 A native of the 4th (Hou-ching) township of the 10th district; it has a
 population of over 300 and a township government.
 There are four persons to feed.
 Father, 56, has aching feet and cannot do any work.  Mother, 46, cannot see
 anything or do any work except feeding pigs.  He himself, 22, tills fields.
 In March this year he served as a platoon leader.   In June he became a
 member of the finance committee in the town government.   In October he set
 out to attack Nanchang as acting commander of a company of the Red Army
 reserve detachment.  His wife, 16, makes firewood, cooks, looks after cattle,
 but tills no fields.
 He himself owned 8 shih of "t'ui-chiao-t'ien."  He did not know for how much
 his father had mortgaged it but he must deliver 2.50 shih of dried rice as
 rent per year.   His 8 shih is paddy rice field and because it is a good field
 it can reap 8 shih of dried rice.   Four persons need 28 shih of rice a year,
 thus short of 20 shih.  He leased a 120-shih rice field from his landlord
 who demanded no mortgage money but rent in kind.   As this is all inundated

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 field, it can only reap 90 shih of paddy rice (only one harvest a year) which
 when converted into dried rice at a discount of 20 percent totals 72 shih.
 Out of this he must deliver 55 shih of dried rice as rent in kind (rent is
 75 percent), leaving a balance of 17 shih which is not enough to feed the
 family. Harvest time is from June to July.  After harvesting crops, paying
 rent in kind and paying last year's rent on borrowed new rice, they soon found
 themselves without anything to eat.   In August and September they had to
 borrow new rice again from rich peasants.   For every shih of new rice borrowed
 he had to pay 3 lo (basket).   Every year he must borrow 10 or more shih of
 new rice.  With regard to the 12 shih of new rice he borrowed last year,
 "thanks to the kindness of the Red Army," he does not have to repay them any
 more.   He owed big landlord Liu Hua-fang a debt of 60 yuan, on which an
 interest was charged at 1 shih of rice for each 10 yuan due, that debt he
 does not have to pay back now.   Fortunately he is able to harvest 40 tan
 of sweet potatoes, 3 tan of which equal 1 tan of rice, so the total would
 be equivalent to 13 tan of rice.
 In March this year, four persons were given a total of 32 shih of rice fields.
 After deducting his own 8 shih of "t'ui-chiao-t'ien," he was actually awarded
 24 shih.  The method of distribution was as follows:  out of the 128 shih
 originally tilled by him (120 shih leased from landlord, 8 shih tilled by
 himself), 96 shih were shoveled out to others while he kept the remainder
 of 32 shih.  What had been shoveled out were mostly poor land; what had been
 kept were mostly good land.   In August when land was re-distributed, it was
 found that he had more and better land than he should have, so he had to
 shovel out 2 shih more and kept the balance of 30 shih.   Some of his good
 land was   shoveled out in exchange for poor land from others.   "Land was
 fairly distributed by the town government."
 In the past when he tilled his 120-shih fields, he had to work himself almost
 to death.   During seasons of rice planting, rice harvesting and sweet potato
 planting, he had to hire hands to help:   rice planting required 6 or 7 man-
 days of hired labor, rice harvesting 30 or more man-days of hired hands,
 sweet potato planting another 30 or more (for early and late crops), a total
 of 70 or more man-days of hired hands.   This did not include exchanges of
 labor (that is, you and I help each other with labor) during rice harvest
 and sweet potato planting which came to another 10 or more man-days.  Now
 he only tills 30 shih so he needs no more hired hands or exchanges of labor.
 If he used to work 3 times as hard, he now labors one-third as much.  Because
 he has more time on hand, he manages finances and does some other work in
 t    the town government,  When attacks were launched against Hsing-kuo,
 Liang-k'ou, and now Nanchang, he took part in all of them.
 He had a schooling of 4 years, reads half of the posters, and can keep
 accounts.

 4.   Ch'en Chen-shan
 A native of the 2d (Chih-ko-ssu) township of the 10th district.
 The 2d township has 800 people with the town government established at
 Yung-feng-yu.
 There are seven persons to be fed:   three brothers, three wives and one daughter
 of the eldest brother.   The eldest brother, 29; Ch'en Chen-shan, the
 second of the three, 24; and the youngest brother, 18.   The eldest set up a
 street stall in front of another man's store selling edible oil and salt.
 He borrowed 120 yuan as capital, lost it, and "joined the revolution as an
 expediency."  He did not have to pay his debt but could not operate his
 street stall anymore.   He is now a soldier in the Red 20th Army.
 Ch'en Chen-shan had a schooling of 8 years.   Before 19 he tended cattle at
 home.   At 19 he started to learn to  farm land and worked for 5 years.  He
 became a propagandist in the town government.   During the current march he
 became a company political commissar.   The youngest brother had been a
 bamboo-splinter apprentice for 3 years.  He is now a soldier in the Red
 20th Army.   The eldest brother's wife cooks, makes firewood and plants
 vegetables.   His (Chen-shan's) wife joined her in these chores.   She now
 serves as a unit commander of the Women's Red Guards.  The wife of the
 youngest brother is only 9 years old.   The daughter of the eldest brother
 is 2.
 He owned a rice field of 12 shih.   In addition, he leased another 10 shih to
 be managed by his elder brother (a rent in kind of 5 shih must be paid).
 Embankment work is usually done 1 day out of 3 on the Yung-feng-yu dike.
 On such a day his elder brother. went out there selling oil and salt and
 came home later to till his field.  Apart from his own tilling, his elder
 brother must hire 80 hands to help him every year.
 He owed a debt of 130 yuan on which he must pay 10 shih of rice as interest.
 He had a harvest of 30 shih of rice a year.   After paying interest of 10 shih
 on his debt and rent in kind of 5 shih, he had a balance of 15 shih left.
 Among the seven persons, the youngest brother was away from home working as
 a bamboo-splinter worker for some other people, so there were six persons
 consuming 42 shih a year, thus leaving a shortage of 23 shih.   This deficit
 had to be made up by his elder brother selling oil and salt and by his
 earning from land farming.   During the period of his apprenticeship, his
 youngest brother earned no money.
 In February last year he and his elder brother joined the revolution.   His
 elder brother served as chief of the food and grain section of the peasant
 association while he himself worked as a propagandist.   The wives were all
 in favor of the revolution because they were frequently hard pressed by
 their creditors for debt payment and thus unable to observe the New Year.
 They were delighted when they heard about resisting payment of rents, taxes,
 grains and debts.   This is why they were in favor of their husbands joining
 the ranks of the revolution.   The youngest brother is a simple fellow; he
 would do what others have told him.   He did not join the revolution at this

 time.   In April when the revolution had failed the jackals of the Pacification
 Corps came here.   His elder brother fled to Chung-ts'un where he helped others
 repair hills. He himself went to Kuan-ch'ao in T'ai-ho where he made 70 or
 80 yuan as a farm helper.  In December last year the Red Army re-took
 Hsing-kuo.  He and his brother came home and re-joined the revolution.   During
 the period of failure of the revolution the jackals of the Pacification Corps
 had burned down six rooms of his house.
 In March this year land was distributed.   In addition to his own 20 shih, his
 family was given 29 shih more, thus totaling 49 shih with each person getting
 7 shih.  When the wives witnessed the division of land without having to pay
 rents and debts they were overjoyed.   So his wife cheerfully went to the town
 government to serve as a unit commander of the Women's Red Guards.   In the
 March distribution they got all good land.   In August when land was divided
 again, it was evenly exchanged this time between the good and the bad.   They
 had to give up one-half of the good land and take in one-half of the bad, but
 the total remained 7 shih per person.   The wives were still delighted because
 they themselves were government workers and kept telling others that they
 should even up their land between the good and the bad.   So when it came to
 even up their own land they were also in favor of it.
 All three brothers including himself and his wife have left home to do revolu-
 tionary work.   Only three women stayed home:  his elder sister-in-law and her
 daughter, and his youngest sister-in-law, none of whom were able to till
 fields.   So the two on government sent people to till their fields; those who
 were sent had more labor to spare; they first tilled those of the Ch'en
 family and then their own; and the tilling was well done.   The tillers who
 were sent to till the fields of the Ch'en family eat at the Ch'en's home.
 Because four out of the seven persons eat away from home, each of them saved
 7 shih a year.   This is sold for money to buy oil, salt and cotton cloth.
 5.   Chung Te-wu
 A native of the 3d (Shan-k'eng) township of the 10th district.
 This family has 11 persons.  He himself, 28, had a schooling of 7 years, and
 worked as a bookkeeper in Wang's grocery store in Pai-lu (30 li from Shan-
 k'eng) at an annual salary of 60 yuan.   From apprentice to bookkeeper he had
 worked a total of 13 years.  In March last year he followed the Red Army when
 it entered Pai-lu and stayed home.  His mother, 57, is getting old and looks
 after children.   His elder brother, 31, tills fields.  His sister-in-law, 32,
 cooks, makes firewood, washes clothes, but tills no fields.   He has two
 nephews, one, 9, going to school, and the other, 3.  His wife, 28, cooks,
 makes firewood, and feeds pigs.   He has two sons, one, 7, going to school,
 and the other, 2.  His elder nephew is married to a girl of 9 who looks
 after children.   He also has a niece of 2.   The above totals 11 persons.
 Only his elder brother tills fields while he himself is engaged in business,
 the rest all lacking productive capability.

 He owned 30 shih of rice field and rented another 36 shih totaling 66 shih.
 On his leased field he must pay rent in kind at the rate of 60 percent, that
 is, 21 shih 6 tou (peck) which was converted into money so he could keep
 his rice.  He reaps 40 or more tan of sweet potatoes a year.  The 11 persons
 need 77 shih of rice a year.   Another 20 or more shih were needed to raise
 chickens, feed pigs, make wine, hire labor, entertain guests, etc.  Thus
 he required a total of 120 or more shih a year and was short of over 20 shih
 on balance.   The whole family needed 150 to 160 yuan a year to pay for salt,
 cotton cloth, workers' wages, borrowed rice and entertaining expenses.   Among
 these items salt cost 20 to 30 yuan, cotton cloth 30 or more yuan, borrowed
 rice of 25 to 26 shih at 3 yuan per shih totaling over 70 yuan, and entertain-
 ing for 20 or more yuan.  The source of this 150 to 160 yuan came from:                  his
 salary earned from the store in Pai-lu amounting to 60 yuan plus a bonus
 of 20 yuan, 10 or more yuan from his miscellaneous crops such as beans,
 10 or more yuan from selling surplus pork after feeding themselves, and 10 or
 more yuan from selling pine firewood, thus totaling about 120 yuan a year.
 Every year he owed a debt of 30 to 40 yuan.  His family owed a debt of
 200 or more yuan covering all the previous years.
 In the past he had owned 46 shih of rice fields.  He sold 7 shih 10 years
 ago at 10 yuan per shih.  He sold another 9 shih 2 years ago at 12 yuan per
 shih.  Now he has only 30 shih in all.  Tilling by his elder brother alone
 was not enough so a hired hand of 120 days was needed every year; labor cost
 240 coppers a day so the total amount of wages came to 28 strings of coppers
 a year.
 In February (March by solar calendar) this year following the success of the
 revolution each person was given 5.50 shih of rice field.   The 11 persons
 got a total of 60 shih 1 lo (including 30 shih of his own).   Because land
 in this township had not been evenly divided between the good and the poor,
 another distribution became necessary but so far it has not been carried
 out.   There are more people than land in this township.   Each person given
 5.50 shih has not enough to live on.  In the past his family needed about
 120 shih of rice plus an expenditure of 150 to 160 yuan per year.  As a
 result of the land distribution they were given 60 shih 1 lo.   This was
 6 shih less than what they used to have before the revolution.  However,
 they need not pay the rent in kind of 21 shih (converted into 60 or more
 yuan).   Nor do they have to pay the interest of 40 yuan (at the rate of
 20 percent) on their debt of 200 yuan.   This is the good side. The bad
 side is that with the collapse of Wang's store in Pai-lu he is left without
 a job.   Thus he has lost his income of 80 yuan a year (60 yuan as salary,
 20 yuan as bonus).   By comparison, the situation is about the same as it was
 before the revolution.  However, since the revolution living expenses have
 been greatly reduced.   In making wine some expense of hired labor is still
 necessary but it is reduced to some extent.   Less cotton cloth is needed
 because of sparing use. Although it is still necessary to borrow rice to
 make up the shortage, the price of rice is greatly reduced to 0.70 yuan
 per shih.   Entertaining has correspondingly decreased so that miscellaneous
 expenses which used to require 150 to 160 yuan can now be reduced to about
 one-half, totaling 80 yuan a year (in Hsing-kuo money is counted in terms
 of yuan).

 In March land distribution "was based on existing land ownership, taking from
 those who have more to compensate those who have less."  Each village was used
 as a unit of land distribution.   Because this village has more people than
 land, existing land ownership has not been changed.   In the present re-dis-
 tribution some land was taken from other villages so that everyone could
 get about 7 shih of rice field.   When this is done, there would probably
 be enough rice to go around.
 In May Chung Te-wu worked in the land section of the town government in charge
 of distributing forest land (he was a member of a four-man committee) and
 completed its distribution in the 3d township.   The way it is done is by
 resolution of the town people's congress after which he sets out to various
 villages where mass meetings are held and lands actually distributed.   Those
 who were given more forest land get less on the plains and vice versa.
 There were cases in which some got land on the plains but no forest land,
 but no one got forest land without also getting some land on the plains.
 In May he served as a company commander of the Red Guards reserve detachment.
 In June he became a propagandist of an independent regiment.   During the
 current march to Hsin-yu he again served as a propagandist.  He took part
 in the 7th and 8th attacks on Chi-an.  He is willing to work as a propagandist
 in the Red Army.
 6.  Huang Ta-ch'un
 A native of Ch'a-kan-ts'un (village) of the 1st township of the 10th district.
 This village has 390 or more people.
 There are four persons to be fed.   He himself, 36, makes firecrackers for
 others.  His mother, 54, has been sick for 9 years and cannot do any work.
 His wife, 31, chops and carries firewood on a shoulder pole to market in
 Pai-lu (Ch'a-kan is 10 li from Pai-lu), buys rice with the money she earned,
 cooks, plants vegetables and washes clothes, working extremely hard.  His
 younger brother, 32, is a bamboo-splinter worker.   Since March last year he
 had gone to serve in the 2d Regiment of the Red Army and was not heard from.
 His family owned 5 shih of rice field tilled by himself.   He rented no field
 from other people.
 He makes firecrackers for others as a hired hand earning 0.14 yuan a day.
 If he works every day, he can earn 4 yuan a month.   As a bamboo-splinter
 worker his younger brother makes 0.10 yuan a day, enabling him to smoke
 yellow tobacco and make some clothes, but has no money to save.
 After the revolution he could make no more firecrackers.  His younger brother
 gave up bamboo-splintering to become a soldier.
 In the past he depended on making firecrackers and his wife selling firewood
 for a living.   They worked hard all year around and still had not enough to

 eat.  After land was divided, they had enough to feed themselves.  He owed
 rich peasant Ch'en a debt of 40 yuan for which he had to mortgage his
 5 shih of rice field.   This rich peasant was very bad; he was killed by the
 masses during the revolution.   In March last year Huang Ta-ch'un organized
 a secret peasant association in Ch'a-kan--ts'un village.   It had 50 or 60
 members and he served as its liaison officer.   In November last year he
 became a unit commander of the Red Guards.  In April this year he worked
 as a land clerk; in June he served as a platoon leader of the Red Army
 reserve unit; and in August he was made a company commander of the Red Army
 reserve unit.  He led his unit in the current march to Hsin-yu,
 In March land was distributed.   Each person was only give 6.50 shih which
 was all poor land.   Moreover, because the original tiller had already
 planted seeds in his field, he was entitled to share 60 percent of the
 harvest while the new owner could only get 40 percent.   In July (August
 by solar calendar) land was distributed again with each person getting
 7.50 shih, of which one-half was good land.
 He was a firecracker worker but now is without a job.   His brother used to be
 a bamboo-splinter worker but is now a soldier.  This entitles them to their
 land.   Other workers with jobs also got their land in about the same amount
 as peasants.   The reason for this is that a worker even with a job now has no
 security and is always fearful of losing it so he wants to have a share of
 the land.   Moreover, as a worker cannot till his field and must hire someone
 to till it for him, he wants to get the same amount of land as given to others.
 At first, the peasants only allowed the workers to get one-half share of
 their land, but the workers said that in that case they would raise their
 wages.  Then the peasants said:  "We will let you have your full share of our
 land but you will not raise your wages."
 After the workers have got their land, they do not have oxen so they must borrow
 them from their relatives and friends.   As they do not have plows and hoes,
 they must borrow them too.  They find it hard,
 He had no schooling and can only keep accounts.

 There are 11 persons:   three brothers, three wives, two nephews, one father,
 one mother and one grandmother.   The eldest brother, 38, is a mason.   The
 second elder brother, 31, tills fields.   The youngest, Ch'en Pei-p'ing
 himself, 24., had a schooling of 6 and one-half years, studied at a primary
 school for 1 and one-half years, and taught for 5 years at a countryside
 primary school..   Father is 65.  Mother is 62.   The three wives stay home
 to cook, chop wood, plant vegetables and wash clothes, but till no fields.
 Two nephews are 2 and 3 years old.   Grandmother is 92.

 They owned 32 shih of rice field and leased another 20 shih from others for
 which they had to pay 10 shih as rent in kind.   Two out of the 11 persons
 eat away from home; the elderly and the young eat less.  For this reason
 they should have enough to eat if they had 60 shih a year.  However, their
 harvest only totaled 42 shih, thus leaving them with a shortage of about
 20 shih a year.
 In addition, there were miscellaneous expenses such as that incurred in wine-
 making, artisan labor, and purchase of oil, salt, cotton cloth, sundry
 articles, gifts for marriage, funeral and seasonal festivals, etc., which
 amounted to 120 yuan or so a year.   The eldest brother earned 50 yuan or
 so in wages; his teaching salary came to 50 yuan or so; and an income of
 about 20 yuan accrued from selling coil palm, firewood, bamboo, lumber, etc.,
 from their hill.   Their cow gives birth to a calf every year, which sells
 for 20 yuan or so.   All these added to a total of 140 yuan or so which was
 used to defray miscellaneous expenses and make up their shortage of rice.
 He owed a debt of 80 yuan.
 Last year his mother, his eldest sister-in-law, and two nephews died, leaving
 the three brothers, two wives of the two younger brothers, and the mother-
 in-law of his eldest brother.   There are six persons to be fed. -
 In March land was distributed on the basis of nine persons (at that time there
 were one new-born son, one new-born nephew, and one newly married sister-
 in-law, but they all died in the latter half of this year) with each given
 5.50 shih totaling 50 shih 5 tou.   This included his own 32 shih; he was
 awarded 18 shih 5 tou which was all poor land.   At present, land was being
 distributed again.  Investigations have been completed but actual re-distri-
 bution remains to be carried out.
 With the fall of landlords and rich peasants, no more houses were built.  The
 eldest brother, being jobless, turned to till his field.   Although he could
 still teach at the newly established village people's school, he earned only
 0.1 yuan a day as food money but no salary, the same as all government
 workers.   In March he, Ch'en Pei-p'ing, became a political commissar in the
 standing detachment; in April he served as a propagandist in the town
 government; in May he was chief of cultural section in the town government;
 in June he became secretary of the town government; and in the intercalary
 month of June he returned home to teach school.   In September he became
 political commissar of the 2d Company of the Red Army Reserve in the march
 to Hsin-yu.
 The two elder brothers took part in attacks against Wang-t'ang and Lang-ts'un.

 There are five persons to be fed:   three brothers, one mother and one elder
 sister-in-law.   The eldest brother, 43, spent one-third of his time as a
 hired tiller and two-thirds to till his field.   The second elder brother,
 39, spent two-thirds of his time as a hired tiller and one-third to till
 his field.   Lei Han-hsiang, 25, the youngest of the three, worked as an
 apprentice mason for 2 years, then came home to be a hired tiller.  Mother
 is 70.  His eldest sister-in-law, 34, cooks, makes firewood and plants
 vegetables.
 He owned 7.50 shih of rice field and leased another 44 shih from the public
 hall on which he must pay rent in kind of 60 percent.
 He owed a debt of 120 yuan at an interest rate of 20 percent.  He borrowed
 it from rich peasant Lei Tsu-yung in the same town.
 The two elder brothers worked on odd jobs for others.  When they worked at
 home, the eldest brother took two-thirds of his time while the youngest only
 one-third.  He himself spent almost all of his time to do off jobs for others.
 The eldest brother was the head of the household.
 His own 7.50 shih of rice field could only reap 6 shih in a year of poor har-
 vest.   The 44 shih of public hall field could reap 70 percent of the harvest
 totaling 30 shih.  While harvest is reduced, rent cannot be reduced:  he must
 still deliver 26 shih of rice as rent in kind of 60 percent on the 44 shih
 of the public hall field.   From the latter he had only 4 shih for himself.
 This coupled with his own 6 shih came to a total of 10 shih.   This was far
 from enough to feed the family.   Besides he must pay 24 yuan as interest
 on his debt.   Thus the whole family became extremely impoverished.
 This was the way to sustain their livelihood.   First of all, the two elder
 brothers and especially he himself the youngest of the three were relied
 on to bring home their wages.  He did about 220 days of odd jobs a year,
 his eldest brother  did 30 or 40, and his second elder brother did 170 or
 180, thus totaling 420 to 430 days of odd jobs a year.   These odd jobs
 normally earn 200 coppers a day while reaping crops and picking wood earn
 500 coppers a day so that the wages come to a total of 40 yuan a year.
 Second, planting sweet potatoes can reap 40 or more tan equivalent to
 10 or more shih of rice.   Third, cultivation of late rice crop can yield
 10 or more shih on which no payment of rent is required.   However, this
 makes it impossible to raise coarse crops.   Fourth, raising pigs at the rate
 of two a year can earn over 20 yuan per pig totaling 40 yuan or more.   If
 they eat one-half, they still have a balance of 20 or more yuan.
 According to the calculation given above, the family had an income of 30 or
 more shih of rice and a cash of 60 or more yuan a year.   On the side of the
 outlay, only three persons ate at home (two of the three brothers ate away
 from home, only one man and two women eating at home to make a total of
 three persons).   To this was added 24 yuan or 240 mao as payment of interest,
 thereby leaving a small balance which could be used to buy oil, salt and

 other sundry articles.   They should not feel too hard pressed,  Why, then
 was his family still very impoverished (all year around they simply had
 nothing good to eat, eating daily sweet potato strings mixed with rice, and
 nothing good to wear)?   The first reason was that all three brothers were
 fond of gambling, in which the second brother in particular always had losses.
 The second reason was that the eldest sister-in-law was gluttonous and lazy,
 turned the house upside down, made the three brothers loath to work, and beat
 the pigs to death.  The third reason was that two oxen died in a row, one
 died from drinking nitric acid water and the other died from a fall.  His
 family fortune had turned bad against the times.  For these three reasons,
 his family always remained impoverished.
 In March land was distributed.   Each person was given 6.50 shih totaling
 32.50 shih.   That is, out.of their originally tilled land of 51.50 shih
 (their own 7.50 shih and 44 shih leased from others), 19 shih were taken
 out to be given away to others while they kept the remainder to themselves.
 However, the 19 shih which were given away were mostly hill-side barren land
 reaping only one crop a year while what remained was  all good land
 yielding two crops a year.
 Land was to be distributed again.   Investigations had been completed but
 actual re-distribution remained to be carried out.
 In March when land was divided, 19 ship was taken out to be given away to
 the new owner.   Because this field was then tilled by the new owner, he was
 entitled to the full share of the harvest of 19 shih. In dividing land of
 other families, a part.of the harvest was taken out with the original tiller
 getting 60 percent and the new owner getting 40 percent.   That is to say,
 the new owner had nothing to do with the planting of the current crop and left
 the work of fertilizing and sowing the field to the original tiller.
 Accordingly, at harvest time the new owner would let the original tiller
 take 60 percent'of the harvest while the latter would give 40 percent to the
 new owner.   This is like the original tiller paying the new owner 40 percent
 of the harvest as rent in kind.
 The eldest brother became a soldier in the Red Guards detachment of this town-
 ship.   He took part in the attacks against Chi'i-fang and Wang-tang.   The
 second eldest brother served as a squad leader of the Red Guards detachment.
 He himself at first was a soldier in the Red Guards detachment, later became
 a platoon leader; and in the current march to Hsin-yu he was made a company
 commander.
 II. The Old Land Relationship in This District
 1. Land Distribution
 With regard to land in the 10th district, namely, the area of Yung-feng-yu,
 the old distribution of land was as follows:

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Landlords               40 percent
 Kung-t'ang              10 percent (jointly owned by landlords
 [Public Hall]                           and rich peasants)
 Rich peasants           30 percent
 Middle. peasants        15 percent
 Poor peasants            5 percent
 2.   Composition of Population
 In general, the composition of population in the 10th district of Hsing-kuo
 County is as follows:
 Landlords
 1
 percent
 Rich peasants
 5
 percent
 Middle peasants
 20
 percent
 Poor peasants
 60
 percent
 Hired peasants
 1
 percent
 Handicraft workers
 7
 percent
 Small merchants
 3
 percent
 Vagabonds
 2
 percent
 According to the above description, the real exploiting class (landlords and
 rich peasants) constitutes not more than 6 percent of the population but
 they hold 80 percent of the land.   Out of this amount rich peasants take up
 30 percent and substantial portions of public hall land were under their
 control.    Thus if the lands of rich peasants were not evenly distributed,
 it would be difficult to solve the question of land shortage faced by the
 majority of the people.  Middle peasants comprise 20 percent of the popula-
 tion but they only hold 15 percent of the land.   Because of their insufficient
 holdings, it is necessary for them to share in the equal distribution of land
 which will result in an increase and not a decrease of their holdings.   Those
 who allege that equal distribution would hurt middle peasants are wrong.
 In analyzing the composition of population in this district,.the family, not
 the individual, is used as the unit.   The 1 percent of hired peasants refers
 to pure and simple hired peasants; those who are both poor and hired peasants
 are not included in this category although their number is considerable.
 Small merchants refer to full-time small merchants; those who are part-time
 peasants and part-time merchants are not included in this category.   The
 2 percent of vagabonds refers to the group of people who are totally unemployed
 and make their living as gamblers and bandits; those who are partially un-
 employed are not included in this category.
 Why landlords only constitute 1 percent of the population?  This is because
 the majority of the land-holding landlords of this district live in Pai-lu
 and T'ien-ts'un districts of the neighboring county and in the urban area
 of this county.   If they were. included in this count, the landlord class
 would generally make up 2 or 3 percent of the population.

 3.   Conditions of Exploitation
 Type 1: Exploitation by Rent
 In the 1st (Ling-yuan-li), 2d (Yung--feng-yu), and 4th (Hou-chin) townships,
 land rent is 50 percent.   In the 3d (Shan-k'eng) township, it is 60 percent
 in some areas and 50 percent in a small area.   Because of floods and drought
 in the 1st, 2d and 4th townships, harvests are frequently poor so rent is
 lower.   There is neither flood nor drought in the 3d township so rent is
 higher.
 Why are there floods and drought in the 1st, 2d and 4th townships and not in
 the 3d?  Because land is mostly poor in the former three townships where the
 hills are full of shifting sand and devoid of trees.  When the sands from the
 hills were dashed by clashing water into the river, thereby raising the
 riverbed higher than the farm land year after year, and when the dike bursts
 open, the result is flood by inundation.   On the other hand, drought comes when
 there is no rainfall in a long time.   In the 3d township land is mostly on
 the hills and higher than the river.   Although land acreage is small, there
 is no fear of flood in case of rain and no drought in case of a long dry
 spell.
 There is no way to plant trees on shifting sandy hills.
 In this district there is only one planting of fields in a year.   Less than
 5 percent of the people plant late rice crops.  No rent is collected on
 small late rice crops and miscellaneous crops.
 Type 2:   Exploitation by Usury
 1.  Money usury:  This can be divided into two periods.   Before 1927 interest
 on money was 30 percent (annual interest of 30 yuan on 100 yuan),  However,
 not everyone could get this kind of loan; he had to mortgage his land,
 hill or house to get it,   Since 1927 "the world has changed." There were
 few money lenders,
 Very few pure landlords lived in this district.  Most of them lived in the
 districts of Pai-lu and T'ien-ts'un in Kan-hsien County although their lands
 were held here.   However, many rich peasants lived here.   For this reason,
 there was no instance of poor peasants borrowing money from landlords and.
 80 percent of their loans were obtained from rich peasants and 20 percent
 from public hall lands.  Middle peasants did not need loans and hired
 peasants could not get them.   The only people who needed and could get them
 were the poor peasants because they had the collaterals.    On the other hand,
 those who were in the business of lending money were mainly rich peasants.
 Thus the struggle between the poor and rich peasants in the land revolution
 would doubtless be very intense.   Rich peasants sometimes also borrowed
 money from landlords in amounts of several hundred or 1,000 yuan, at a lower
 rate of interest ranging from 15 to 18 percent.   The money thus raised by
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 the rich peasants were in turn lent to peasants in smaller amounts of less
 than 100 yuan each while they received mortgaged property and squeezed high
 interest.  In this way the rich peasants acted as the middle man in the
 exploitation of poor peasants by the landlords.   By the same token, the
 interests of the rich peasants are inseparable from those of the landlords.
 Most of the public hall lands were controlled by the evil gentry of this
 district.  The majority of this type of local gentry owned some land but
 not enough to support himself.   He is neither rich peasant nor landlord;
 he is evil gentry.   Because he had not enough to eat, he wanted to control
 the public hall lands to exploit the poor in the process.   In the 1st, 2d
 and 4th townships, 60 percent of the public hall lands were in the hands
 of the evil gentry and 40 percent in the hands of the rich peasants.   In
 the 3d township, most of these lands were controlled by the evil gentry
 prior to 1912 because at that time only those who were endowed with official
 rank or academic degree could gain their control.   During the Republican
 era the rich peasants had controlled most of them.  In contrast with the
 situation prevailing in the 1st, 2d and 4th districts, 60 percent of the
 public hall lands in the 3d district were controlled by the rich peasants
 and 40 percent by the local evil gentry.  When poor peasants borrowed
 from the public hall, the loan interest was a little cheaper than that
 charged by rich peasants:   the latter charged 24 percent while the former
 charged 20 percent.  A loan from the public hall required a mortgage as
 collateral just the same.   Collection of debt was even harsher by the public
 hall than by the rich peasant.   If interest on the loan was not paid when
 it became due, the creditor would resort to hauling cattle and pigs and
 reaping crops from the field.   If the debtor failed to pay the loan interest
 when due, he could still talk to the rich peasant by agreeing to pay it next
 year in compound interest or he could sub-lease his mortgaged land to be
 tilled by someone else and collect the rent to pay his interest.   Since the
 rich peasant is aimed at making money, he is able to compromise on the term
 of maturity.
 The harshest form of interest on money is interest by the month.   This kind
 of loan is made to rascals for gambling purposes.   Its term is 1 month;
 forlyuan the debtor pays 2 when due.   But this is not often.
 2.   Rice usury:   Borrowing rice is called "producing rice."  It is borrowed
 from the rich peasant at very high interest; if it is borrowed from the
 public hall or public granary, the interest is lower.  When a rich peasant
 lends rice to a poor peasant, regardless of whether it was lent in November
 or December last year, or in January, February or March this year, when he
 reaps his rice crop in July, he pays the rich peasant a uniform interest
 rate of 50 percent, that is to say, he must pay 3 lo (basket) as interest
 for 1 tan of rice borrowed.   It was less than 1 year from November when it
 was borrowed to next July when it was to be repaid; it was only half a year
 from January or February to July; and it was only 4 months from April to
 July.  Why was such a high rate of interest charged (30 percent higher than
 .interest on money loans)?   This was because in winter and spring the price
 of rice was very high, 100 percent higher than in autumn; if it was
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 1.50 yuan per shih in autumn, it would often be 3 yuan per shih in winter
 and spring.   For this reason, the rich peasant would add interest on the rice
 he lent in order to compensate for the loss resulting from the lower price
 of his rice.   He would rather buy rice than lend it.   Even if he had charged
 an interest rate of 50 percent, it would still be more profitable for him
 to sell his rice in winter and spring.   So it would be a great favor to the
 poor peasant if he could get a rice loan from the rich peasant.   Out of
 100 shih of rice owned by the rich peasant, more than 90 percent would be
 sold and less than 10 percent lent.   In Ch'a-kan (1st township) when poor
 peasant Huang Ta-ch'un wanted to borrow rice from rich peasant Ch'en Feng-ming,
 he was refused.  However, when Huang asked to borrow money from Ch'en in
 order to buy rice from him, Ch'en was willing to loan him the money.
 Eighty percent of the money loans were borrowed by poor peasants from rich
 peasants; only 20 percent of such loans were made by public halls and public
 granaries; and no loans were made directly by landlords.   In the case of
 rice crop loans, poor peasants obtained 90 percent of them from the
 public halls and public granaries, only 10 percent from the rich peasants.
 Thus it can be seen that the rich peasant is an out-and-out exploiter while
 some sense of compassion is shown by public halls and public granaries.
 In the main the public hall is also an exploiter.   In the 1st township, the
 public halls sold 80 percent of their rice and only lent 20 percent.   In
 the 2d 3d and 4th townships, practically all of the rice was sold and
 almost none was for loan.   Only the rice crops owned by the public granaries
 were totally for loan and none for sale.   In this district every township
 has its public granaries.   There are four in the 1st township (population
 3,000) with a total of 800 shih of rice.   The 2d township (population 800) has
 five with 500 shih.   The 3d township (population 3,000) has six with 400 shih.
 These three townships have a total of 20 public granaries with 1,700 shih of
 rice.   Practically every village has a public granary.   The 4th township
 (population 4,000) alone has only one public granary with 100 shih of rice.
 In this district the poor peasants relied completely on the public granaries
 to lend them rice to tide over the lean months; it was hopeless to borrow
 rice from the rich peasants.
 Although public granaries charged a lower interest of 30 percent than that
 charged by rich peasants on rice loans, their requirements of pledges for
 security were quite strict; iron implements (plows and hoes), pewter-ware,
 silver ware, cotton blankets, mosquito nets, clothes, etc., could all be
 used as pledge.   Only in Yang-fang-ts'un village of the 1st township, however,
 pledges were not required on rice crop loans by the public granary.   It
 would do if the borrower could get his neighbor to write a "note of
 subrogation" guaranteeing the payment of principal and interest.   The rice
 crops of the public granaries were collected from contributions by landlords,
 rich peasants and middle peasants.   They collected rice to set up a public
 granary for the purpose of giving relief to the poor people during periods
 of famine and starvation.   This was a deceptive reform policy used to pacify
 the revolt of the people.   Yet those who were ignorant of the truth were
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 prone to sing the praises of their benevolence and virtue.   Except for the
 landlords, rich peasants and middle peasants who cannot and need not borrow
 it, rice in the public granary may be borrowed by all poor peasants, hired
 peasants, workers and vagabonds if they can put up their pledge or get
 someone to write a "note of subrogation."
 If "producing (borrowing) rice" is harsh enough, "picking money on new rice"
 is even harsher yet.   In the months of February, March, April and May when
 the poor peasant had nothing to eat, he wanted to pledge his new rice for
 money from the rich peasant.   During that period the price of rice was
 usually 3 yuan per shih, but the poor peasant only got 1.50 yuan per shih
 for his pledged new rice.  When it was time to deliver the new rice in June
 or July, its price was usually 2 yuan per shih.   Based on the market price
 of rice at this time, this was not such a terribly harsh deal but the crux
 of the question lay in the fact that the poor peasant had already delivered
 his new rice at its lower price and he would just see the rich peasant
 selling it for a much higher price by next spring and summer.   The rich
 peasant bought the new rice at 1.50 yuan per shih and he sold it for 3 yuan
 per shih.  Thus he made a profit of 100 percent which was 50 percent higher
 than what was made out of "producing rice."  Was not this even harsher yet?
 3.   Pig usury:  None in this district.
 4.   Cow usury:  This practice was in existence in all townships but not pre-
 vailing.   The rich peasant lends his cow to the poor peasant who feeds and
 works her in the field; he gives the rich peasant 1.50 tan (3 baskets) of
 rice per year as interest; and if the cow bears a calf, each shares one-half.
 In the 1st, 2d and 4th townships, 3 out of 10 rich peasant families lent
 out their cows in this manner.   In the 3d township, only 1 out of 10 rich
 peasant families lent out their cows.   As the cow may die of disease or from
 a fall, this kind of interest is not earned with safety so the rich peasant
 has not made any effort to deal in it.  He is afraid that the poor peasant
 might not keep the cow well fed, make her thin, or work her too hard or she
 might be stolen by thieves.   So if the poor peasant could borrow a cow from
 the rich peasant, it would be a big favor to him.
 5.   Oil usury:   Some poor peasants were engaged in the cultivation of oil-
 bearing crops.                          Between May and June when they ran out of rice, they had to
 borrow money from the rich peasants to buy rice by pledging to sell new oil.
 During these months the price of oil was 25 yuan per tan but they could only
 get 12 yuan, sometimes. even 10 yuan per tan in the deal.  They must deliver
 the new oil in September without shortage.   In other words, when they borrowed
 12 yuan from the rich peasants in June, they pledged to deliver 1 tan of oil
 in September.   In September the price of oil was always 17 or 18 yuan per
 tan, sometimes even 20 yuan, the lowest being 15 yuan per tan.  Now suppose
 they borrowed 12 yuan in June and the price of oil was 18 yuan in September,
 then the balance of 6 yuan would be counted as interest for 4 months or at
 an interest rate of 50 percent.   Suppose the price of oil in September was

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 20 yuan, then the interest would be 8 yuan or at a rate of 80 percent.   The
 rich peasant collected his oil in September, hoarded it and waited until
 the following April to August when oil was in short supply, then transported
 it down river to Chiang-k'ou and Kan-chou-fu where it could be sold at least
 for 25 or 26 yuan per tan, sometimes even as high as 40 yuan per tan.  Two
 years ago in June peasants of the 1st township went to Pai-lu to buy oil,
 they paid 1 yuan (10 mao) for only  1  chin (catty) 12 Jiang (ounce).   Although
 this was retail price but if it was added up it would take 57 yuan to buy
 1 tan of oil.   In June last year it took 1 yuan (10 mao) to buy 2.5 chin of
 oil which was equivalent to 40 yuan per tan.   Calculating on the basis of this
 example, in June this year if a poor peasant borrowed 12 yuan from the rich
 peasant for which he pledged to sell 1 tan of his new oil, by June of the
 following year he would have lost as much as 28 yuan while the rich peasant
 would have made a profit of more than 200 percent.   This type of usury was
 not only heavy but also quite safe.   From September to December the poor
 peasants would engage in oil extraction.  The rich peasant who was not afraid
 of finding the poor peasant "delinquent" would wait for him to deliver the
 oil to his home.   If he were afraid, he would go to the peasant's home waiting
 for the oil to be extracted in order to take the oil home in person.
 Such is the type of oil usury.   Speaking from the side of the poor peasant,
 it is called"picking money on new oil"; from that of the rich peasant, it
 is called "lending money on new oil."  The rich peasant seldom lent oil
 (not lending money on new oil) but this was done occasionally.   For example,
 in December this year the poor peasant borrowed 1 tan of oil from the rich
 peasant and sold it for 20 yuan.  By next year when the oil price was high,
 he had to return 1 tan of oil or repay it with money at the market price
 but without interest.   This would be tantamount to having the poor peasant
 keep 1 tan of oil for the rich peasant and thus could not be regarded as
 vicious usury.  A poor peasant could borrow this kind of oil only if he was
 favored by the rich peasant and could be relied on to repay it by the follow-
 ing year.   The poor peasant borrowed this kind of oil because his parents
 died, or he was about to get married, or he had other urgent expenses to be
 met.   Then he would ask the rich peasant with whom he was on friendly terms
 to lend him the money.  The rich peasant told him that he had no money but he
 had oil (or rice).   In this way oil or rice was borrowed from the rich
 peasant to meet the urgent need of the poor peasant.   By the following year
 when the oil price was high, if the creditor wanted oil, the debtor would
 have to buy it at the market to make the delivery.   If he wanted money, the
 01     debtor would convert his oil into money at the market to make the payment.
 This type of borrowing oil is called "hauling oil."
 6.   Pawnshop usury:  There are two types of pawnshops:  big pawnshops and
 small ones.   Big pawnshops are not found in this district but in Tien-ts'un
 and Pai-lu.   The rate of interest is 5 percent per month.   If you pawn off
 anything to get 100 coppers, you pay 5 coppers per month as interest; if
 you get 1,000 coppers, you pay 50 coppers per month as interest; if you get
 1 yuan, you pay 5 fen per month as interest.  Money is counted in terms of
 hsiao yang [small yuan]; the period of maturity is 10 months; if a pawn is
 not redeemed when it matures, it is extended for 1 month after which it

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 becomes irredeemable as dead pawn.   If interest is charged at 5 percent per
 month, it is 60 percent a year.   This kind of exploitation is extremely
 harsh. Many poor peasants, hired peasants, workers and vagabonds go to
 pawnshops.   Among these four types of people, 60 out of 100 families enter
 pawnshops.   Pawned articles which were desired included iron implements,
 pewter-ware, silverware, mosquito nets, blankets and clothing.   Many people
 in this township went to pawnshops in Pai-lu; they made up 60 percent of the
 poor masses.   In Pai-lu the pawnshop owners were natives of Hsing-kuo County.
 When pawned articles became irredeemable as dead pawn after 11 months, they
 were carted off by their owners to Hsing-kuo to be sold at public auction.
 If an article was pawned off for 1.50 yuan, it was worth 3 yuan.  However,
 the aim of the pawnshop owners is to make money on interest and not to
 auction off pawned articles.
 Every township in this district has small pawnshops.   They were run by rich
 peasants without a store front and not as a regular business.  Whenever poor
 peasants and workers were really hard up, they carried articles to the homes
 of rich peasants to be pawned off for a little money.   This happened not
 too frequently.   Out of 100 families of poor peasants and workers only
 10 went to small pawnshops.  Why, then, do more people go to big pawnshops
 and less to small ones?  Because small pawnshops were run with a bad reputa-
 tion.   In addition, local people were known to each other only too well.
 When an article was taken in, the poor pawner always wanted to beg for a
 little more money and the rich peasant found it hard to argue too much about
 it. Thus he was rather reluctant to do this sort of business.   Small pawn-
 shops charged the same rate of interest as big ones but the period of maturity
 was much shorter and determined by the rich peasant to be 1, 2, 3 or 4 months
 beyond which a pawned article became irredeemable as dead pawn.
 Of the eight persons who came to the fact-finding meetings at this time, the
 families of Ch'en Pei-Wing, Chung Te-wu, Fu Chi-t'ing and Ch'en Chen-shan
 had not been to pawnshops at all.   The other four families of Wen Feng-chang,
 Lei Han-hsiang, Huang Ta-ch'un and Li Ch'ang-ying had all been to pawnshops.
 Wen Feng-chang had to go there once a year; between April and May he had to
 pawn off something to buy rice.   In April last year, he pawned off one iron
 hoe and two wine kettles at Heng-hsing Pawnshop in Pai-lu and got 2.40 small
 yuan with which he bought 1 shih of rice.   In December they were redeemed
 back by him.   The family of Lei Han-hsiang must pawn every year.   To say
 nothing of the two elder brothers who were pawners, Lei Han-hsiang, the
 youngest of the three, pawned off in January last year his unlined long
 jacket for 1 yuan and two hoes for 6 mao (0.60 yuan); neither was redeemed.
 In June he pawned off one masons knife for 3 mao and one "yang-t'ou-tzu"
 for 5 mao (both were his masonry tools); neither was redeemed.  Up to
 2 years ago Li Ch'ang-ying had never been to a pawnshop.   In February last
 year when the revolution broke out, he went to work in the guerrilla
 battalion.  When the White bandits came, he fled to Pai-lu.   His wife had
 nothing to eat at home, so she pawned off her cotton jacket for which she
 got 1.20 yuan.  When the revolution broke out again, she did not redeem it.
 Before last year Huang Ta-ch'un had never been to a pawnshop.   In May last

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 year when there was no market for firecrackers and nobody wanted to make them,
 he had nothing to eat so he pawned off one cotton blanket for which he got
 1.50 yuan. This cotton blanket was pawned to rich peasant Chung K'uei-tzu
 of this village.   In July this year the revolution broke out throughout
 this county.  When the Red guerrilla detachment arrived in this village from
 Pai-lu, the poor people rose in revolt, arrested Chung K'uei-tzu and had him
 killed in Pai-lu, and returned the blanket to him.  The father of Chung
 K'uei-tzu was a good man willing to give relief to the poor so he was not
 killed by the masses.   Chung K'uei-tzu operated a firecracker store in
 Tang-chiang and learned to be a skillful fighter.   He could fight off a
 score of people.  When he was killed, everybody cheered.  His land was
 distributed and his family fined three times amounting to several hundred y,an.
 7.   Salt usury:   This is very harsh because all the salt in Hsing-kuo came
 from Kwangtung.    Many poor peasants were engaged in salt business as a side-
 line trade.   Out of 100 poor families, 10 took to carrying salt on their
 shoulder-pole for sale as a sideline occupation.   As they had no capital,
 they had to borrow it from rich peasants.   They collected young chickens
 and carried them to Chia-ying-chou (Mei-hsien County, Kwangtung Province)
 for sale:   they went with one pole-load of chickens and came back with one
 pole-load of salt.   For every yuan borrowed, they had to repay with 1 chin
 of salt as interest.   Each trip took no more than 20 days or 1 month; 1 chin
 of salt was worth 1.20 or 1.30 mao.   In other words, 1 yuan of principal
 must be repaid with 1.20 or 1.30 mao as interest.   After 1927 as more and
 more revolutions broke out everyday, interest rate came down to 24 percent
 so no more money could be made out of interest on salt.
 Type 3:   Exploitation by Taxes
 In this district there were no direct taxes levied on peasants except taxes
 and rents on farm lands.
 Each 3 shih of rice field is the equivalent of 1 shih of "seedbed field" on
 which a farm land tax of 4 fen 4 li (0.044 tael of silver) must be paid.
 For tax purposes 1 tael of silver is converted into 3.60 big yuan; 4 fen 4 li
 into 0.1584 big yuan.   This is the amount of the farm land tax on 1 shih of
 "seedbed field."  One shih of "seedbed field" equals 3 shih of the existing
 ordinary field.   Therefore, on 1 shih of ordinary rice field a land tax of
 0.0528 big yuan must be paid.   Last year the price of rice in this district
 was 3 small yuan per shih converted into 6 strings of coppers.   One big
 yuan is converted into 2.80 strings of coppers; 0.0528 big yuan is converted
 into 148 coppers which can buy 2.50 sheng of rice or less.   This is to say
 that at present 1 shih of rice field in Hsing-kuo must pay a land tax of
 2.50 sheng of rice.  However, in this area 1 shih of rice field can only
 reap 7 tou of rice (harvest of 70 percent).   Thus for every 7 tou of rice a
 land tax of 2.50 sheng must be paid or 3.50 percent of the harvest.
 Although there were no other forms of exploitation than taxes on farm lands,
 those who traveled to Kwangtung for the salt trade were subjected to various

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 types of taxes and levies all along the way.  Middle or poor peasants who
 were engaged in the salt trade collected 70 chin of young chickens in this
 village at 0.32 yuan per chin.   They shouldered one pole-load of chicken
 to Chia-ying-chou.   In terms of silver, 1 chin of chicken used to be worth
 3 ch'ien (0.3 tael of silver) sometimes 4 ch'ien.   This year the price had
 gone even higher at 4.8 ch'ien per chin.   Each 7 ch'ien 4 fen of silver is
 converted into 1 big yuan; 4 ch'ien 8 fen is converted into 0.65 big yuan
 or 0.91 small yuan.  After deducting 0.32 yuan as capital, a profit of
 0.59 small yuan could be made per chin.   So 70 chin would yield a profit
 of 41.3 small yuan.  Why is the price of chicken in Chia-ying-chou so high
 this year?  Because of the revolution fewer chickens were brought there
 from various counties in Kiangsi so prices rose sharply.
 Out of the gross profit of 41.3 yuan as mentioned above, various items of
 expenses incurred on the road must be deducted.   The first item was wages.
 During prior years it only took 10 days to Chia-ying-chou from here.   But
 now because the Red sector is separated from the White Sector, it is neces-
 sary to make detours in many places, thus requiring at least 15 days to make
 the trip.  Wage is 0.25 yuan a day so it totals 3.75 yuan for 15 days.  The
 second item included food, yellow tobacco, tea and strawsandals for a minimum
 of 0.45 yuan a day totaling 6.75 yuan for 15 days.  The third item covered
 feed grain for the chickens with 70 chin of them eating 0.30 yuan a day
 totaling 4.50 yuan for 15 days.   The fourth item was likin tax.   From
 Hsing-kuo to Meng-ling no levy was made.  At Meng-ling likin must be paid
 at the rate of 1 big yuan (converted into 1.40 small yuan) per tan.   In the
 past no likin was levied at Meng-ling.   The fifth item included expenses
 for collecting chickens requiring 3 days of wages, food and buying chicken
 baskets totaling 2 yuan.   The above four items of expenses came to 19.4 yuan.
 Deducting 19.4 yuan from the gross profit of 41.3 yuan, the net profit per
 tan of chicken is 21.9 yuan.
 Going with 1 pole-load of chicken and coming back with 1 pole-load of salt.
 This year 1 yuan can buy 18 chin of salt in Chia-ying-chou; in the past it
 could only buy 14 chin; even last year that was so.   Price is counted in
 big yuan.  This year the development of the revolution has slowed down
 the market for salt and thus brought down its price to a reasonable level.
 Carrying 1 pole-load of salt at a cost of 4.50 big yuan (converted into
 6.30 small yuan), the salt trader brought it to Hsing-kuo where there was
 a severe shortage of salt between May and June this year.   Thus the price
 rose sharply, and 1 small yuan could only buy 2.50 chin.   Based on this
 price, 80 chin of salt could be sold for 32 small yuan and after deducting
 the cost of 6.30 yuan a gross profit of 25.70 small yuan could be made.
 However, from the above gross profit of 25.70 yuan must be deducted expenses
 on the road.   First, wages came to 3.75 yuan for 15 days.   Second were food,
 yellow tobacco, drinking tea and straw sandals totaling 6.75 yuan.   Third
 was likin tax.   There were six places:   Chi-t'an, Meng-ling, Pai-fou,
 Tiao-yu-t'an, Hui-ch'ang and Hua-ch'iao.   In Meng'ling alone likin tax
 must be paid.   In the other five places, a ticket inspection was required.
 Formerly payment of likin tax was 0.60 or 0.70 yuan per tan, now it is

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 1 yuan per tan.  Ticket inspection in five places cost 0.20 small yuan each
 totaling 2 big yuan (converted into 2.80 small yuan).  The above three items
 of expenses came to 13.30 yuan.   Deducting this from the gross profit of
 25.70 yuan leaves a net profit of 12.40 yuan.
 One pole-load of chicken on the going trip would make 21.90 yuan, and 1
 pole-load of salt on the return trip would make 12.40 yuan so the total
 profit came to 34.30 yuan.   The period of time was 1 month.   In the past
 the profit in chicken and salt had not been as great as it is now, but it
 was more dependable and did not require making detours.  A roundtrip would
 only take 20 days.   At present, although greater profit can be earned, the
 road is not safe for travelers.   Local posse and elements of the Pacifica-
 tion Corps frequently searched and robbed travelers of their money (only a
 small amount of money from selling chickens was used to buy salt with the
 greater portion being carried on their person).   They did not want salt but
 they often grabbed chickens for food; and the only thing they did not do
 was kill people.  Nevertheless, the number of such traders have not decreased.
 In May and June the price of salt was high at 1 yuan for 2.50 chin.   Now (in
 October) it has become cheaper at 1 yuan for 3 chin 12 Jiang.   This is because
 the breakthrough at Chiang-k'ou and Ta-hu-k'ou has facilitated the transport
 of salt from Kan-ch'ou to this area.   Compared with the pre-revolution
 period the price is still very high.   Before the revolution 1 yuan could buy
 6 chin 4 Jiang of salt.   It was cheaper almost by 100 percent compared with
 the present (in October).   It was cheaper almost by 200 percent compared
 with May and June this year.
 III.   The Classes in the Struggle
 The landlords of the first township all lived in Hsing-kuo City or Pai-lu,
 not in the township itself.   The rents were delivered to Hsing-kuo City or
 Pai-lu.   Four or five landlords resided in Pai-lu, each collecting over
 1,000 tan of rice as rent.   Some operated stores in Pai-lu; others worked
 in Nan-ch'ang or Kan-chou.   One lived in Hsing-kuo City; collected 1,000 tan
 as rent; operated the Heng-ch'un-hao imported goods store in the city and
 a store in Kan-chou.
 The second township had three landlords, each collecting over 300 tan as
 rent, all residing in the township.   Liu Yueh-lin did not farm; collected
 300 tan of rent.  Two members of his family were killed during the revolu-
 tion, the first and third sons of [Liu] Yueh-lung, who were both commanders
 of the pacification force.   The family still had 10 mouths to feed after
 the revolution.  Land was allocated to them, and they obeyed the government.
 Tu Hsi-yu, with over 20 members in his family, farmed 200 ku [6253], of land
 and collected 300 tan as rent.   In his 40's, he joined the revolution in
 the second lunar month last year.  When the Red Army arrived in the second
 month this year, he was the first to surrender voluntarily the deed to his

 land to be burned.  His farm was divided.  He now works in the government
 as a propagandist.  Hsieh Wen-lin, with 30 members in the family, farmed
 500 ku of land; collected 100 tan as rent; is related to Tu Hsi-yu;
 voluntarily burned his deed and divided the land; now serves as chief of
 the finance section in the government.   Of the six brothers in his family,
 five farmed; hired four employees; was the richest in the township, no one
 literate in the family; very honest.   (Hsieh Wen-lin was actually a rich
 peasant.)
 The third township had two landlords.   Tseng Hsi-ch'un's family was divided
 into five households, totaling over 20 members; collected over 1,000 tan of
 rice as rent; did not farm themselves; well-known big landlord; counter-
 revolutionary.  All the men fled, leaving behind five or six women and
 children.   Each was allocated land.  Houses were burned down.  No one was
 killed in his family, but two of those of his clan serving as his henchmen
 were.  Hsieh Yuan-hsiang collected over 400 tan as rent; did not farm; over
 20 members in the family; counterrevolutionary; fled; no one killed.
 In the fourth township, Wang Jun-lan [3769 3387 5695] was a big landlord;
 collected 400 tan as rent; farmed 200 ku of land; owned many oil-bearing
 crop hills, all tended by himself; counterrevolutionary, commander of the
 pacification force; killed many workers and peasants and burned their
 houses; fled.  Liu Chia-hung owned 300 ku of land, farming 100 himself
 and renting out 200; five members in the family; counterrevolutionary;
 organized the pacification force together with Wang Jun-lan and Tseng Mei-hsi.
 Liu Chia-hung and his sons were all killed.  Tseng Mei-hsi collected 100 tan
 as rent and farmed over 100 ku of land himself; a rich peasant; five members
 in the family; assistant commander of pacification force; killed many workers
 and peasants.   The ghost of one of his victims, poor peasant Kao Lao-kou
 "made trouble in his house, and he and his father were both haunted to death."
 Hsieh Ch'uan-chen collected 300 tan as rent; did not farm; five or six members
 in the family.   He was arrested by the third district and delivered to the
 government for detention; not yet killed; his assets were confiscated.
 First township:   12 rich peasants, 7 among them counterrevolutionary.  Heads
 of two families killed; male adults of remaining five families fled.   Family
 assets of those who fled were confiscated, even including the cooking pots
 of some of them.   Assets of the two families with the heads of household
 killed were not confiscated.  Women, old people, and children of all seven
 families remained behind; received land allocations.   Some women remarried.
 Liu Shu-yao, son of Liu Neng-ch'ang and now in his 20's, joined the
 revolution; was sent to Hsin-yu as a squad leader.   The other head of
 household that was killed was Ch'en Feng-ming; his house burned.   Five of the
 12 families not against the revolution; donated money; divided their land;
 joined the Red Guards; performed revolutionary work diligently.  Hsu Ch'ang-han,
 one of them, owned 400 ku of land, mostly farmed by himself, renting out a
 small portion; over 10 members in the family; loaned out much money; was

 or third month last year; served as a director of the Young Pioneers since
 the third month this year; subsequently went to work for the Southwest
 Kiangsi Government (kind of work unknown); returned in the eighth month
 and again served as a director of the Young Pioneers in the district govern-
 ment; was accused as a member of AB League; detained.  Ling Yueh-po owned

 2 months; was permitted to confess and released.  Hsieh Chung-chieh
 owned over 200 ku of land, mostly farmed by himself and a part rented out;
 eight members in the family; was arrested by the township government recently;
 fine is considered; not yet released.   Of the 12. rich peasants, 7 were active
 counterrevolutionaries.   Though the remaining five joined the revolution
 on the surface, two belonged to the AB League which conspired to resist the
 revolution, and one of the remaining three was arrested.

 the second township government and embezzled over 80 yuan; fired from his
 job and fined 150 yuan.   One day, at a mass meeting, he made use of the pen
 and ink belonging to someone else and wrote two reactionary slogans:  "The
 AB League Reorganization Faction is needed to consolidate the soviet poli-
 tical power"; "The AB League Reorganization Faction is needed to capture
 Kan-chou and Chi-an."  Was arrested and interrogated; confessed that he was

 the first, 7 out of the 9 in the second, 6 out of the 9 in the third, and
 the 2 in the fourth were counterrevolutionary.   The four townships had a total
 of 32 rich peasants, and 24 of them were counterrevolutionary.   Though the

 The farms of the rich peasants were very good, just as good as those belonging
 to the landlords and the courts [kung-t'ang 0361 1016].  When they bought land
 from the poor peasants, they always wanted to buy the good farms, and the poor
 peasants had to sell.   If the poor peasants sold the poor farms, it would take
 several mou to make up the price of 1 mou of good land.  When the rich peasants
 loaned money to the poor peasants, they always asked for the good farms as
 security.   Therefore, the good farms gradually were concentrated in the hands
 of the rich peasants.
 When the revolution first started, such as the second or third month this year,
 many of the rich peasants became opportunists and joined the revolution.
 The rich peasants and their henchmen occupied 30 percent of the posts in the
 township and district soviets.   During the anti-rich peasant propaganda week
 in the 4th and 5th months, they were thrown out.   Currently, only two rich
 peasants serve in the district (Hsieh Wen-lin serves as finance section chief
 in the second township; Tsou Li-tung serves as cultural department chief in
 the district government.)
 The middle peasants benefited in the land revolution.   First, not only suffer-
 ing no loss in land, most of them gained in the land division.   The middle
 peasant population of this district constituted 20 percent of the total, while
 their land was only 15 percent.   Therefore, most of them acquired additional
 land.  Though some of them had their land reduced, it was a very small
 minority.
 Second, in the past, it cost around 200 yuan to get a wife, almost equivalent
 to the entire family assets of a middle peasant.   Therefore, it was difficult
 for a middle peasant to marry, and many of them were in debt due to marrying.
 If the wife died, it would be extremely difficult to marry again.   Now, there
 is freedom of marriage, costing not 1 penny.   This is a great advantage.
 Third, in the past, when an aged member died in a middle peasant family, the
 funeral would cost at least 50 yuan, or as much as 100, or more.   In the
 past, very often a middle peasant became indebted or bankrupt due to the
 death of a parent.   Today, superstitious habits have been abolished.   If
 someone dies, it only requires burial, without wasting any money.
 Fourth, in the past, when the family cow died, the middle peasant would
 sell the beef for 8 or 10 yuan.   He must then add 10 yuan or more to buy
 another cow.  Now, though he will only get 8 or 10 yuan for a dead cow,
 he only has to put up 3 or 4 yuan to buy another one.
 Fifth, now that the power of the landlords and rich peasants has been knocked
 down, the rites abolished, and superstition abolished, it is no longer
 necessary to give gifts or burn incense, and some expenses are saved.

 Sixth, besides the above five economic advantages, there is also the political
 advantage, which is the major one.   In the past, under the control of the
 landlords and rich peasants, the middle peasants had no "right to speak,"
 and must abide by the decisions of others.  Now, together with the poor
 peasants and hired help, they have the right to speak.  Approximately 40 per-
 cent of the middle peasants have responsibilities in the township and
 district soviets.   Among the middle peasants, those owing no debt at all
 constituted 10 percent, and those owing a little debt but still able to manage
 the household 30 percent.
 The middle peasants were very brave in the revolution.  Same as the poor
 peasants, they "sallied forth" (assigned to the Self-Defense Army, at times
 they had to sally forth to do battle), performed patrol duty and held
 meetings.
 In regard to the middle peasants of the district, their population constituted
 20 percent of the total, and their land 15 percent.   Though their land was
 of better quality than that of the poor peasants,,it was far inferior to
 that of the rich peasants.   Generally speaking, it was good and bad--half
 and half.
 4.   Poor Peasants
 After the revolution, the poor peasants gained the following advantages:
 (1)   Land was allocated to them.   This is their fundamental interest.
 (2)   Hills were allocated to them.   In the past, the poor peasants rarely
 owned any hills.   Among the poor peasants of the first and second townships,
 30 households had hills, and 70 had none.  As there are many hills in
 Chin-chun Village (Shan-k'eng) in the third township, 70 poor peasants had
 hills, while 30 had none.  The hills there are mostly oil-producing hills.
 Of the 100 poor peasants in the fourth township, half of them had hills
 and half had none.  Among the poor peasants in the townships having hills,
 the area per household was very small.  As the hills in the first and
 second townships are mostly sandy, the landlords only wanted farms, not
 hills.  The rich, middle and poor peasants each owned a part of the hills.
 The distribution in the first township was:   40 percent owned by the rich
 peasants; 40 percent by the middle peasants; 20 percent by the poor peasants.
 The distribution in the second township was:   50 percent owned by the rich
 peasants; 30 percent by the middle peasants; 20 percent by the poor peasants.
 As there are more oil-producing hills in the third township, which are more
 productive, the. landlords wanted them, but it was still the rich peasants
 who owned most of the hills.   The distribution was:   15 percent owned by
 the landlords; 50 percent by the rich peasants; 20 percent by the middle
 peasants; 15 percent by the poor peasants.   It was stated before that
 70 poor peasant households in the third township had hills, but what they
 owned constituted less than 20 percent of the total, each household owning only
 a very small area.   The distribution in the fourth township was: 20 percent own-
 ed by the landlords; 20 percent by the rich peasants; 50 percent by the middle
 peasants;.l0 percent by the poor peasants.   Owning little or no hills

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 was a big difficulty of the poor peasants.  First, they had little or no
 firewood, and had to gather straw from hills belonging to others.  Second,.
 they could not chop firewood to exchange it for oil and salt at the market;
 they could only gather straw in exchange for oil and salt, and it took
 three loads of straw to make up for one load of firewood.  Third, they had
 no lumber to build houses or make tools.   Fourth, owning none or little oil-
 producing hills resulted in having little or no oil for food.  Now that the
 hills have been divided, according to the number of people in the household
 similar to the division of land, every household owns hills.  Though the
 number of hills in the various townships varies and the people in some
 have more while others have less, everyone has a little even in the townships
 which have less hills and the difficulties of the poor peasants are solved.
 Because of the need, the poor peasants firmly advocated the division of
 hills.   For the sake of production, the hills had to be divided. In the
 past, due to the lack of manpower, those households with more hills left
 some of them untended, while the large masses of poor peasants with adequate
 manpower had to remain idle.  Now that the hills have been divided, the poor
 peasants can devote their effort to their own hills, and production will
 greatly increase.
 (3)   At the beginning of the revolution, the grain belonging to the landlords
 and counterrevolutionary rich peasants was divided, and the poor peasants
 had their shares free of charge.   The grain in Pai-lu (where the big land-
 lords concentrated) was evenly divided among the people, and the poor
 peasants did not finish eating it even at harvest time.
 (4)   Debts incurred prior to the revolution did not have to be repaid.
 When the revolution first started in the third month, the higher authorities
 instructed that debts owed to merchants, to collective funds and among the
 poor workers and peasants themselves must be repaid.   In the middle part of
 the 6th month (July by Western calendar), an official communication came
 from Southwest Kiangsi (the Southwest Kiangsi soviet) instructing that all
 debts were cancelled.  Actually, since the third month, no debt was paid,
 which was a fact, but the three kinds of debts described above still had
 to be paid, according to principle (a theory).  After the 6th month, even
 that principle was abolished.   The poor peasants fully supported the move.
 Why did they want to cancel even the three kinds of debts?  First, in
 regard to debts owed to merchants, most of the big merchants had fled.
 (Ten big merchants among the 35 stores in Pai-lu had fled.)  As for the
 small merchants (such as the 25 small stores in Pai-lu), though the workers
 and peasants owed them money for goods, most of them were in debt to the
 big merchants, landlords and rich peasants.   If the poor workers and
 peasants did not repay them, nor did they have to repay the landlords and
 rich peasants.  When the two were compared, it was still advantageous to
 the small merchants, because they owed more to the big merchants, land-
 lords and rich peasants than what the poor workers and peasants owed them.
 Second, in regard to collective fund debts, which were incurred for the
 purpose of marrying or paying debts, the poor workers and peasants asked
 their relatives and friends to set up a fund and borrowed from it.   Such

 relatives and friends were either middle or rich peasants, and cancelling
 the debt did not hurt them.   Though such funds were set up to render friendly
 aid, it was the poor peasants who borrowed from them and, as the poor
 peasants could not pay, it was proper to cancel the debts.   Even if the
 second and third funds were borrowed by the rich peasants, it was also
 reasonable to cancel them, because the rich peasants, after borrowing the
 money, loaned it out to other poor peasants for interest, and now the poor
 peasants did not have to pay them back.   Furthermore, the entire assets
 of the rich peasants were either confiscated or donated, and there was
 nothing left.   Therefore, it was proper to cancel the debt.  As for the
 funds borrowed by the landlords and rich peasants for the purpose of ex-
 ploiting the poor workers and peasants, there was no such incident in this
 district.   Third, in regard to the mutual debts among the poor workers
 and peasants, "as you are poor, and I am also poor, how do I pay you?"
 Thus, the question was answered.   Therefore, it was most proper to cancel
 all debts.
 (5)   They enjoyed inexpensive rice.   In the 1st and 2d months this year,
 the cost of grain was 4.60 yuan per tan.  The revolution started in the
 3d month, and it dropped to 2 yuan per tan.   From the 6th month to now
 (9th month lunar calendar), it was .70 yuan per tan.  By comparing .70
 yuan with 4.60 yuan, it was 6.5 times cheaper.  When the grain was cheap,
 naturally it was unfavorable to the poor peasants who had received land
 allocations and cultivated and harvested, but it was favorable to them
 during the several months after the beginning of the revolution and prior
 to harvesting.
 (6)   Greater freedom to get a wife.   (The peasants of Kiangsi turned the
 term "freedom to marry" into a verb, to distinguish it from the coerced
 and mercenary marriages of the old days; the term is commonly used among
 the peasants in the entire soviet area.)   In the past, one must have money
 to get a wife; therefore, many poor peasants could not get married.  Or,
 even if they did, it was either a child bride or someone very advanced in
 years.   Should the wife die, it was most difficult to remarry.   Now, such
 difficulties no longer exist.
 (7)   It is no longer necessary to spend money when there is a death in the
 family.   All one has to do is to bury the dead.
 (8)   The cost of cows is cheap.   It is easy to buy or replace a cow.   The
 poor peasants are very short of draft animals.  Take 100 poor peasant
 households in the district:   only 15 have 1 cow per household, 40 have 1 cow
 per 2 households, 10 have 1 cow per 3 households, 5 have 1 cow per 4 house-
 holds and 30 have none.   Under this situation, the cheap cost of cows is
 favorable to the poor peasants.
 (9)   Social obligations are abolished and superstition eliminated, and
 the expenses for them are no longer necessary.

 (10)  There is no longer opium smoking or gambling, or theft.   Even if the
 door is not closed at night, nothing is stolen.
 (11)  With the division of land, every household can raise hogs.  Not just
 to sell them for others to eat, but the poor peasants can eat the meat
 themselves.  In the past, very few poor peasants bought meat from the
 butcher shops, but now more of them are buying meat.
 (12)  This is the most important point:   The acquisition of political power.
 The poor peasants are the main force of the rural political power and the
 leading class of the village.   The poor peasants can be divided into five
 strata according to the number of cattle as discussed in item (8) above.
 5.  Hired Help
 Similar to the poor peasants, the hired help also received land allocations,
 because, as the landlords and rich peasants have been overthrown, no one
 will hire permanent help though temporary help is still needed.   Though
 they now have the land allocated to them, they do not have draft animals
 or farm tools, and it is difficult for them to farm the land.   This problem
 is not yet solved.   Instead of allocating the animals and farm tools con-
 fiscated from the landlords and rich peasants to the hired help, the
 district and township governments sold them.
 Fu Chi-t'ing's nephew, Chu Ta-hsi, was hired help.  He has three brothers,
 two parents and a wife (a grown up child bride).  He is the eldest, age
 22, and the boy next to him is 19 years old.   He worked as permanent help.
 for rich peasant Chung, at an annual wage of 39 yuan, small currency.  His
 19-year-old brother was a cowherd, earning an annual wage of 10 yuan.
 Their total income of 49 yuan was enough to buy 16 tan of grain, sufficient
 for 2 and a half persons.   They relied on their mother and his wife to
 gather and sell straw for food, eating two meals in winter time.  He owed
 over 30 yuan; had no house of his own; lived in a mountain shed belonging
 to a landlord and took care of the latter's hills.   His father, now over
 60 years of age, had also worked as hired help.
 The hired help in this district could draw 15 pays per year, reporting for
 work after the 15th day of the 1st month of the year; no customary meals
 of meat on the 1st and 15th days of the 1st month; bedding supplied by
 the boss, but no clothes; paying for their own medicine; no wage deduction
 due to illness of less than 3 days, but wages were deducted beyond 3 days.
 Their wages were paid piecemeal.   They worked from dawn to dark.  Besides
 the time spent on meals and rest, they worked at least 10 hours a day.
 In winter time, they peeled mu-tzu [2606 1311] and potatoes.in the evenings.
 Ninety-nine percent of the hired help had no wives.   They were the most
 miserable class in the rural village.  Not only did all landlords and rich
 peasants have wives, but.some of them had several.  Ninety percent of the
 middle peasants had wives and 10 percent did not.  Seventy percent of the
 poor peasants had wives and 30 percent did not.   Seventy percent of the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 handicraft workers had wives and 30 percent did not.  Ten percent of the
 vagrants had wives and 90 percent did not.   Even the vagrants were better
 off than the hired help, as 99 percent of the latter had no wife.   In the
 7th month (8th month lunar calendar) [sic], the government issued an order
 that the unmarried men and women must get married as soon as possible by
 free choice.   Thus, the number of marriages by the free choice of the parties
 suddenly rose.   In the 2 months since the 7th month, most of the formerly
 unmarried middle and poor peasants have been married, and there are very
 few single men or women.   It is more difficult for the hired help.   The
 women object to the lack of utensils and articles for use in the hired help's
 home and his long absences.  Therefore, it is difficult for the hired help
 to solve the wife problem.   In Yang-fang Village in the first township where
 Fu Chi-t'ing lives, of the four hired help (two sets of brothers belonging
 to two families), only one acquired a wife by free choice.  Actually, another
 one could have acquired a wife also, but the social security section chief
 of the township government refused to register them on ground of their
 illicit relationship in the past.  As a result, the woman married someone
 else, and the man is still single.  In the vicinity of Yung-feng Market in
 the second township, four of the six hired help acquired wives by free
 choice.  In Hou-ching Village in the fourth township where Wen Feng-chang
 resides, the one and only hired help is still single.
 After
 land division, there is no longer any permanent help, and only
 30
 per-
 cent
 of part-time help is left.                      Wages have not gone up, nor have the
 hired
 help asked for a raise.  "There is not even any work, let alone a raise!"
 Now we discuss the issue of draft animals and farm tools after the hired help
 acquired land.   Of the two hired help in Yang-fang Village, the Ch'en family
 has two brothers, both working as hired help.   The elder brother was a
 permanent employee of rich peasant Ch'en, earning 33 yuan a year.   The
 younger brother worked for rich peasant Chung as a permanent employee,
 earning 42 yuan.  Their father, deceased, was a tenant farmer.   Their mother
 took them around begging after their father died.   Grown up, they became
 hired help.  Their mother died.  The older brother is now 29 and the younger
 23.  They have a house and cooking utensils, but no furniture.   The farm
 tools of the past were sold.  After land was allocated to them in the 2d month,
 both brothers returned home.  The younger one acquired a wife by free choice.
 They had no capital.  The younger brother once had over 100 yuan, but he
 lent it to poor peasant Chung.  He could not collect it as all debts were
 cancelled, and the poor peasant debtor had no way to repay him anyway.
 Luckily, their uncle, a middle peasant, loaned them a draft animal and
 tools.   The three of them were allocated a total of 16.2 shih of farmland.
 After receiving land allocation in the 2d month, they immediately farmed
 the land and kept the entire harvest.  Harvesting the first crop, they
 cultivated a second one, which is growing well.  With a cow, one person
 can farm 100 ku of land, yet the two brothers together only cultivate over
 10 ku.   Therefore, they have much spare time, and they do odd jobs for
 others, work as porters, and earn some money.

 The Chung family of Yang-fang Village also consists of two brothers.   Their
 parents were deceased.   They live with their uncle (Chung En-chiang),
 uncle's wife, their two sons, a daughter-in-law, and two granddaughters,
 totaling nine members in the family.   The uncle and his two sons were
 tenant farmers.   They owed money and could not make enough to live on.
 The two brothers worked as hired help.  The older brother, Chung Sheng-p'o,
 in his 40's, worked for rich peasant Chung as a permanent help.   The
 younger brother, Chung Sheng-huai, age 36, worked for middle peasant
 Chung, also as a permanent help.  After land division in the 2d month,
 they farmed their own land.   Formerly they leased a cow from middle peasant
 Chung Lung-t'an, and the cow threw two calves.   After the revolution,
 Chung Lung-t'an wanted to collect one of the calves.   The township govern-
 ment told him:   "We must wait and see how the other townships handle such
 matters.   Only if they permit the original owners to do so will you be able
 to collect a calf.  At present you cannot do so."  Therefore, the cattle
 still remained with Chung En-chiang.  After the two brothers received land
 allocations, draft animals and tools were no problem, because their uncle
 had them.
 Here we will discuss middle peasant Chung Lung-t'an.  He is in his 30's,
 his mother in her 60's, and his wife in her 20's, a total of three mouths
 to feed.  He owned over 10 ku of land and leased 30 or 40 from others.
 After paying the rent, he had more than enough for the family, and he sold
 the surplus.  He leased three cows to three poor peasants, collecting
 1.5 tan of grain per cow per year as rent.  The calves were divided half
 and half.  He had money to loan out.   In the land division in the 2d month,
 his family of three received a total of 24 ku of land (6 tan per person) [sic],
 which was more than what he owned before, but he was not permitted to lease
 land from others.   Therefore, he had no surplus grain to sell.   The cows
 leased out by him and the money loaned out were all cancelled and gone.
 He is very honest.  He does not oppose the revolution, but nor has he
 undertaken any important work.  He now works as a cook in the Red Army
 reserve in his home village.
 The hired help have not gained political power after the revolution.  The
 middle and poor peasants always find them "illiterate, inarticulate,
 unenlightened, ignorant of official affairs," and incapable.  No hired
 help is among the committee members of the district and township governments,
 and only one serves as a team leader of the township Red Guards.
 Handicraft workers in the district included carpenters, masons, tailors,
 iron workers, barbers, bamboo workers, mill workers, coir workers, stone
 workers, painters, tin workers, weavers, silversmiths, dye workers,
 trough workers, lacquer workers, kiln workers, and paper workers, a total
 of 18 categories.   Carpenters, masons, tailors and bamboo workers were
 more numerous; barbers, iron workers and trough workers (fetching-oil)
 next; and the remaining.categories the least in number.  The district did

 not have coppersmiths, cotton ginners, shoemakers or tanners.   The first
 township had one oil trough; the second, two; the third, 11, and the fourth,
 12, each trough attended by one trough worker.
 The wages per man-day of labor in the past were:   carpenter 0.20 yuan,
 mason 0.20 yuan, tailor 0.15 yuan and bamboo worker 0.15 yuan.  The barbers
 in the first, second and fourth townships received 1 peck of grain per year
 per person, in the third township they were paid 0.15 yuan per year per
 person, and all meals were provided free by the boss.   Iron workers were
 paid 0.25 yuan.   In regard to trough workers, they are paid 10 coppers
 for each catty of oil produced in the second township, 3 coppers each
 catty in the third, and 2 catties of oil for each picul (100 catties)
 produced in the fourth.   The situation in the first township, which produced
 less oil, was not clear.   The oil in the third township was the cheapest
 because of the large output.   In regard to mill workers, each mill was
 0.60 yuan, requiring 3 man-days of labor.   Coir workers were paid 0.22 yuan,
 and stone workers 0.45 yuan.   Painters were paid according to the pictures.
 They painted the portraits of rich gentry and landlords and images of gods.
 Tin workers were paid according to the tin utensils.  Weavers were paid
 0.10 yuan for every 10 feet of summer or spring cloth.  (Summer cloth is
 hempen fabric; spring cloth consists of 80 percent hemp and 20 percent
 cotton.)   The district had no cotton textile weaver. Silversmiths were
 paid according to the silver utensils, "suffering a big disadvantage."  The
 situation of the dye workers was unknown.  Lacquer workers were paid by the
 piece, and so were the kiln workers.   Paper workers were paid 0.15 yuan
 (making durable paper from mulberry bark, only in the third township).
 In the past, carpenters, masons, tailors and bamboo workers performed from
 over 100 man-days of work to 200 per year.   After the revolution, the work
 days of the masons and tailors have been greatly reduced, amounting to
 only about several dozen man-days per year.   Carpenters and bamboo workers
 are doing a little less work than before, but not noticeably so.  Barbering
 is more popular than before, because the women have all cut their hair.
 After the revolution, tin workers, painters, lacquer workers, and paper
 workers have all disappeared, because there is no more need for them.
 (Paper workers made fuses for firecrackers used in celebrations.  Now that
 such firecrackers are not used, there is no longer need for paper workers.)
 The "order from above" provided that handicraft workers would receive a
 half-share of land, but the handicraft workers demanded a full share,
 on ground that they were either unemployed or their work was reduced and
 insecure, and that only by getting land would they have security.  The
 peasants said:   "The order from above provides that you get half a share.".
 The-workers said:   "If so, then wages will have to be raised."  The peasants
 did not want the wages to increase, because the poor peasants and hired
 help needed to employ the workers to make farm tools to farm their land.
 The rich and middle peasants already owned farm tools; therefore, they
 had no need to employ the workers.   Only the poor peasants had such need;
 therefore, they opposed higher wages.  The poor peasants said:? "Alright,
 you can have the land, but you must not raise the wages."  The workers
 said that, after receiving their land allocations, if they still performed
 100 man-days of work a year, they would be willing to give 2 tan of grain

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 to the public.   The barbers were not allocated land, because they stayed with
 others all day long and had their meals free.   The workers of Kan-hsien re-
 ceived land and had their wages decreased.   The wage of masons was reduced
 from 0.20 yuan to 0.15, and that of bamboo workers from 0.15 yuan to 0.12.
 Seventy percent of the handicraft workers had wives, and 30 percent did not.
 After the revolution, most of the single men acquired wives by free choice.
 As the handicraft workers have a wide contact, possess a special skill
 and are relatively intelligent and articulate, and many among them are
 literate, they are in a better position than the hired help.
 The handicraft workers have a general labor union in the district, branch
 unions in the townships and branch departments in the villages.   The 20 or
 more workers of various occupations in Ling-yuan in the first township, for
 instance, have organized a branch union.
 Rural handicraft workers always farmed on the side while pursuing their
 major occupation of handicraft.  There were very few of them who did not
 farm at all--less than 10 in 100.
 Eighty percent of the handicraft workers were in debt.
 Merchants in the district operated grocery and variety goods stores, rice
 and fruit stores (further divided into several dozen categories), tea
 shops, restaurants, butcher shops, beancake shops and opium dens.  Those
 who operated small stores exclusively without farming on the side constituted
 3 percent of the population (three families in 100).
 Among, the four townships in the district, there were, in the past, only three
 small merchants with 500 yuan in capital, all located in Yung-feng Market,
 and none in other townships.  The small stores in the district were dis-
 tributed as follows:   five in the first township, 35 in the second (all
 in Yung-feng Market), six in the third and none in the fourth, totaling
 46.   Out of the 46 small stores, four had capital of 500 yuan.  (Three of
 them were in Yung-feng Market:  A medicine store, owned by someone from
 Chang-shu, and two imported goods stores, branches from Hsing-kuo City.
 None of the owners was a landlord in the district.   They all fled when the
 revolution started.   The stores were seized and the goods given to the poor.
 The fourth store was in Shan-k'eng, owned by a landlord of the township.
 The whole family fled, and the store was boarded up.)   One store had a
 capital of 400 yuan.   (Located in Shan-k'eng, it was a variety goods store,
 operated by two partners, Han Li-t'ao, who farmed 20 shih of land, and
 Han Li-tung, who farmed 60 shih.  After the revolution, Han Li-t'ao fled.
 Han Li-tung infiltrated the revolution, served as the land section chief
 in the government, and was accused of belonging to the AB League and
 detained by the district government.)   Three stores had capital of 300 yuan.
 (All were located in Yung-feng Market:   two were variety goods and fabrics
 stores, operated by individuals from Hsing-kuo City. Both were counterrevolu-
 tionary, and both fled.  The stores were converted into tea shops.   One was

 a butcher shop.   The owner also had 60 ku of land.  He joined the revolution;
 continues in business; serves as chairman of the village government; is honest).
 Two stores had capital  of 100 yuan.  (One was in Shan-k'eng, selling variety
 goods and serving also as an inn.  The owner had no land; counterrevolutionary;
 was killed; the store closed.  The other is in Hsi-chiang, selling variety
 goods and also making silverware.  The owner farms several ku of land;
 not counterrevolutionary; store still in business).  Two stores had capital
 of 50 yuan.   (Located in the third township, the one in Chu-k'eng is a
 medicine store.  The owner has 20 ku of land; not counterrevolutionary;
 store still in business.   The other, located in Shang-ching-yao, was also
 a medicine store.  The owner had land; counterrevolutionary; fled; the
 store closed.)   There were 24 stores with capital of 20 yuan.   (Two in
 Wu-niang-miao and two in Chiao-t'ien-chiang, totaling four in the first
 township; 20 in Yung-feng Market in the second township.)   There were
 10 stores with capital of 10 yuan.   (Nine in Yung-feng Market in the second
 township; one in Chi'i-ling-ai in the third township.)  The above specialized
 in small stores, without any sideline.
 There were many people in the villages whose main occupation was farming,
 with commerce as a sideline (deriving 80 percent of their income from
 farming and 20 percent from commerce), constituting about 40 percent of
 all the households (40 households in 100).   The majority of them were poor
 peasants and a minority were middle peasants.  As they did not have suffi-
 cient income for their living, they did some porterage to supplement it,
 such as going to Chiang-k'ou, Han-chou and Hu-k'ou-mien and carrying along
 some oil as capital to bring back salt.  Or, they might carry eggs to sell
 in Chia-ying-chou (Mei-hsien) and bring back salt.
 Merchants in the district with capital of 50 yuan or more numbered 12.  Of
 the 12, 9 were counterrevolutionary and 3 were not.
 Among the 12, only the 4 with capital of 500 yuan hired clerks, 3 of them
 hiring 1 each and the remaining one hiring 2.   The 8 remaining ones did
 not hire any help.
 There were 34 stores with capital of 20 yuan or less.  Those operating them
 are called store owners, but actually poor people; therefore, there is
 no counterrevolutionary among them.  All the stores are still in business
 [except the opium dens].
 The 34 so-called "stores" with capital of 20 yuan and 10 yuan included:
 9 inns (4 in the first township; 5 in the second, all located in Yung-feng
 Market).
 4 opium dens
 2 candy stores
 4 butcher shops
 4 rice shops
 1 woodenware shop
 1 ironware store
 4 variety goods stores (above all in Yung-feng Market)
 5 tea shops (4 in Yung-feng Market; 1 in the third township).

 In the land division this time, except those who were killed or who had fled,
 merchants with capital of 50 yuan or more whose stores were sealed or closed
 were given land.   Only three stores whose owners are not counterrevolutionary
 are still in business.  One is a butcher shop in Yung-feng Market with an
 original capital of 300 yuan.  The owner was assessed a donation of 220 yuan,
 leaving him only 80 yuan.  He has 15 mouths to feed and is not counter-
 revolutionary.  Originally he owned 60 piculs of land.  In the land division,
 the owner, Chi'en Shao-lin received half a share and the 14 members of his
 family each received a full share.   Thus, he has a little more land now than
 before.  His brother Ch'en Shao-ying served as a company commander in the
 Third Army (formerly the Second Regiment); therefore, his family is
 revolutionary. He serves as the chairman of the village government.  The
 second establishment is a medicine store in Chu-k'eng with a capital of
 50 yuan.   The owner received half share of land and the members of his
 family each received 1 share.  The third is a variety goods and silverware
 store in Hsi-chiang with a capital of 100 yuan.   The owner is not counter-
 revolutionary.  The township government assessed him a donation (amount
 unknown).   The owner received half share of land and his family members
 each received one share.   In regard to the 34 small stores belonging to the
 poor, as the business of the four inns in the first township and one candy
 store in the third township has always been bad and the owners have always
 relied mostly on farming for their living, they and their family members
 each received a full share of land.  As for the 29 stores in Yung-feng
 Market, in the past, the owners had no land but operated their small
 business exclusively.   After the revolution, aside from the four opium
 dens which closed down, the candy, butcher, rice, woodenware, ironware,
 variety goods and tea shops, and the inns have not only continued in
 operation, but the business has not dropped.   Even so, they still received
 land allocations, the owners getting half shares and their family members
 full shares.   Those without draft animals or farm tools borrow them from
 relatives.
 In general, that the stores with capital of 50 yuan or more (actually they
 were mostly small stores) suffered severely in the revolution was a result
 of the excessive leftist policy of the area.   The poor operating stores
 with capital of 10 or 20 yuan were greatly benefited.   Besides receiving
 land allocations, they have reduced the expenses for social obligations,
 can acquire a wife easily, do not have to spend money on the dead, and have
 gained political recognition,.  All these benefits are the same as the
 poor peasants.   Such poor people and small peddlers belong to the same
 class as the poor peasants.   Therefore, the benefits gained by them are
 not much different.
 a     8.   Vagrants
 There were the following categories of vagrants in the district.
 (1)   Gamblers:  About 50 or more in the entire district, including about
 10 in the first township, about 20 in the second, all in Yung-feng Market,
 6 in the third and about 20 in the fourth.   In the past, 9 out of 10 gamblers
 smoked opium, but they do not do so anymore.   There is not one counter-
 revolutionary among the 50 or more gamblers in the district.  When they

 heard about knocking down the local tyrants and dividing the land, they were
 very pleased.   In the past, they had no clothes in cold weather and were
 dressed in rags, but now they have good clothes to wear.  In the past, they
 would have fish and meat when they had money but starve when the money ran
 out, but now, though they do not have delicacies, they can eat rice every
 day.   Eight out of 10 of them had no. family.  Now, with the land allocated
 to them, they borrow draft animals and tools from their relatives to farm
 the land.  As gamblers were always generous, it is easy for them to borrow
 things now.   Among the 10 in the first township, one of them originally
 served as a finance committee member in the fourth township government.
 He was an honest gambler, had good credit and performed well as a finance
 committee member after the revolution.  Among the 20 in the second township,
 four of them are working in the township government:  Tien Shang-jen
 serves as propaganda department chief in the district government; had a
 house; no family; joined the revolution the year before last; house
 burned down by the pacification force.  Ch'en Kun-t'ung joined the revolution
 the year before last; served as judge in the district government; subsequently
 became commander of the Third Company in the Reserve Army.  Yang Ta-hu
 joined the revolution the year before last; became chairman of the township
 government in the revolution in the 2d month this year; performed well;
 subsequently joined the district government.   Ch'en-Shao-chi'i joined the
 revolution the year before last; became land section chief of the township
 in the 2d month this year.   Among the six in the third township, Lei Yung-
 huang has a family; used to gamble and sell opium; joined the revolution
 in the second month this year; serves as finance section chief in the
 township government; very loyal and honest.
 (2)   Beggars:  There were four beggars in the first township, five in the
 second, four in the third and four in the fourth, totaling 17.   They were
 people entirely without a future.  Most of them had no family; only 4 out
 of the 17 had families.   The entire families of these four begged.  Now,
 after receiving land, they borrow draft animals and tools from their
 relatives.   None of them has done any government work after the revolution.
 (3)  Water-pipe tobacco sellers:  There were two in the second township and
 one in the fourth, totaling three.  The two in the second township both had
 wives. and sons.   Their wives leased farms from others to farm, but they
 themselves did not pursue any proper occupation.   They sold water-pipe
 tobacco in gambling dens.   The one in the fourth township had no family
 and did not farm.    Now they have all been allocated land.  None of them
 has worked in the government since the revolution.
 (4)   Horoscopists:    There was only one in the fourth township; no family;
 did not farm; specialized in fortune-telling; received land allocation.
 (5)   Kuan-yin [Goddess of Mercy] pickers:  There was one in the first
 township; land was allocated to him.

 (6)   Taoist priests:   three in the first township; all had families; did not
 farm; performed religious work:   two in the second township; neither had
 family; did not farm;   one in the third township; had family; did some
 farming.   All six priests were allocated land.   Tseng Yun-chang was a
 priest; joined the revolution the year before last; no family; no farm;
 became general commander of Hsing-kuo-Kan-hsien-Wan-hsien guerrilla force
 in the 2d month this year; "most resourceful; able; never defeated in
 battle"; now assigned to the 22d Army.
 (7)   Monks:  Two in the fourth township, each occupying a temple; collected
 rent to live on.   Originally from Kao-hsing Market.  After the revolution,
 they returned to Kao-hsing Market where land was allocated.
 (8)   Entertainers:  They gave puppet shows.   One in the third township;
 had family; farmed; now serving with the 20th Army.   Two in the fourth
 township; had families; farmed; now working in the village government.
 All three were allocated land.
 (9)   Fortune-tellers:   One in the first township; single; has brothers;
 joined the revolution last year; has been serving as propaganda section
 chief in the township government since the 2d month this year. Two in the
 second township; one of them blind; both had families.   Their wives farmed
 and they told fortunes.   Land was allocated to them.   Blind man Ch'en Hsin-po
 was "a famous fortune-teller."  For his accuracy in telling the fortune of
 a magistrate, the magistrate gave him 10 yuan."  As he was blind, he
 received a double-share of land--14 ku.   There were four fortune-tellers
 in the third township; all had families.   Three of them farmed and one did
 not.   The families did the farming while they told fortunes.  Now, three
 of them work in the government.   Tseng Ch'ing-lung, one of them, joined
 the revolution in the 2d month last year, "most articulate," has been
 serving as land section chief in the district government and performing well.
 He formerly had several ku of land which he rented to his uncle; unmarried.
 Chi'iu Ta-yang, the second one, joined the revolution in the 2d month
 this year; no farm nor family; now serving as judge in the third township
 government; very honest.   The third one, Ch'iu Po-ch'eng, had several
 shih of land; married; joined the revolution in the 2d month this year;
 now serving as propaganda officer in the township government.   There
 were 17 fortune-tellers altogether.
 The nine categories of vagrants discussed above, totaling 90 persons,
 generally welcomed the revolution.  Not only did none of them resist the
 revolution, but 10 of them have joined the district or township government
 in leadership work and one has become a guerrilla commander.   This is
 noteworthy.
 The vagrants have gained many benefits in the revolution.  Aside from the
 nine categories discussed above, the district has no other vagrants.

 (1)   Unit of division:  All four townships used the village as the unit to
 divide the farmland.   As the townships are large and have many mountains,
 it would have been difficult to take each township as one unit, because the
 great distances would make it impractical to farm.   The peasants preferred
 to get a little less land in their own village rather than going to
 another village.   In villages where the farmland was less and the hills
 more, each person received a little less farmland and a little more hills,
 and vice versa.   The result was "not much difference."
 (2)  Method of division:  The "order from above" was to complete the
 division in 3 days.   Actually, it was completed in the first and third
 townships in 7 days, and the second and fourth in 8 days.   (The time was
 too short.)
 The first township has 15 villages, the second and fourth 7 villages each,
 and the third 8 villages.  At the beginning of the division, the district
 government sent propaganda officers to the villages to hold mass meetings.
 Notice was given half a day in advance to call the people together.   The
 men came, but not the women and children under 10 years of age.   The
 propaganda officers explained to the people the benefits and methods of
 burning the deeds and dividing the land.   One propaganda officer could
 hold mass meetings in two different villages in a day.  At that time, the
 reaction of the people attending the meetings was:   "It certainly sounds
 good, but we don't know whether the regulations are stable or not."  Some
 said:   "The documents (contracts) are burned; the debts are cancelled.
 While land division, thanks to the Red Army, is good, it may not be
 reliable.  Now that the land is divided, most likely we will have to pay
 rent."  At the mass meetings, a village government chairman, a secretary,
 a finance section chief, a land section chief and two executive secretaries,
 an organization section chief, a propaganda section chief, a grain
 section chief, a military affairs section chief, and a communications
 officer were elected.   The Yang-fang village government of the first
 township was elected at the mass meeting in the forenoon of the 25th day
 of the 2d month, lunar calendar.   The propaganda officer left for another
 village.   The masses (60 or 70 out of the total population of over 180 in
 the village attended the meeting) adjourned for lunch.   Returning in the
 afternoon, the village government called a meeting.   Chairman Chung En-ming
 (an independent laborer; no farm; worked as cook; made beancakes to sell;
 made rice candies to sell at shows in other areas) served as chairman of
 the meeting.   The following items were decided on:
 (a)   Ask the wealthy families for donations for use as village government
 expenses.   This matter to be handled by the finance section.
 (b)   No grain may be shipped out of the village.   This matter to be handled
 by the grain section.

 (c)   Concentrate all weapons of the village.   This matter to be handled by
 the military affairs section.
 (d)   Make land surveys and divisions.  This matter to be handled by the
 land section.
 The 4 days between the 26th and the 29th were devoted to land survey.   Land
 section chief Fu Chi-t'ing (a member of the survey committee) led land
 executive secretaries Chung En-sheng and Chung En-jen (both poor peasants)
 and the four unit chiefs (the village was divided into four units, every
 10 households per unit) to check the farmland by households and record
 the locations and sizes of the farms.   The survey was completed in 4 days
 and the total area of farmland ascertained.   Dividing the total by the
 number of population in the village, they obtained the area per person.
 c     Fu Hua-lung owned 230 tan of land, completely farmed by himself; 10 mouths
 to feed; owed over 300 yuan in debts; hired one cowherd; had one large
 buffalo.  His land was inferior; actually could only harvest over 140 tan.
 He needed half of that to feed the 10 members of the family, leaving the
 remaining half as surplus.   After paying interests on the debts and rent
 on the land (a part of which was not very productive) amounting to over
 40 tan, he had around 30 tan left over.  He was, therefore, a middle
 peasant with some surplus.   Chung Hsien-hui farmed his own 70-odd tan of
 land, feeding three.   In the past, he had money to lend, but last year
 he used up his money to build a house.  He hired a regular help for 6 months
 out of the year.   Besides feeding his family, he had a surplus of over
 30 tan every year.  He was also a middle peasant.  He had four brothers,
 not living together.   Besides him, one of them could make a living, but the
 remaining three had a hard time.  Now, Fu Hua-lung and Chung Hsien-hui com-
 plained that the survey was unfair, and that their farms were over-rated.
 The several dozen poor peasants, hired help, and workers all objected to
 their complaint and declared the survey of the land section correct.   The
 three rich peasants at the meeting all obeyed the dispositions and kept
 quiet.  Everyone approved the results of the survey and immediately wanted
 to "shovel out" so much from a certain household to be given to a certain
 other household and to "shovel in" so much by a certain household from a
 certain other household.  Those households which had to surrender land
 decided on the part to be surrendered; therefore, they surrendered the
 inferior portions.  As the struggle was not yet intensive at that time,
 those who obtained inferior land were so pleased to get land at all that
 they did not complain.  The meeting on that day did the work of "taking
 the surplus to supplement the shortage."  After division, the village
 government secretary recorded it in books, without posting.   From the
 25th day of the 2d month to the 1st of the 3d month, the land division
 ?     was completed in 7 days.
 After division, "immediate transfer" or "fall transfer" became a struggle
 between the poor and rich peasants.  At the time of land division in the
 2d month, it was after seeding, before transplanting and in the midst of
 plowing.  Most of the transfers were done immediately.  However, some rich
 peasants wanted to see which way the wind blew and hoped that the pacifi-
 cation force would return and nullify the division.  They told the poor

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 peasants:   "I have already fertilized and plowed.   Let us not transfer this
 year.   Let me harvest before transfer, and I will give you 40 percent of
 the harvest."  Some of the poor peasants accepted the proposal, feeling that
 it was a good deal to get 40 percent without doing anything.   Some of the
 hired help and workers actually could not immediately take over the land to
 farm.   Therefore, about 10 percent in the district followed the "40 percent"
 method and did not take an immediate transfer.
 2.   Division of Hills
 Land was divided between the end of the 2d month and the beginning of the
 3d month.  The hills were not divided until the end of the 5th month.
 In Yang-fang Village, the hills began to be divided on the 27th day of the
 5th month, because the order from above did not arrive until then.  (Note
 how great is the effect of the order from above!)  The township government
 sent propaganda officer Liu Ta-lun (intellectual; eager in work; but was
 discovered, on the 17th day of the 8th month, to be secretary of the AB
 League; killed by the district government; 11 persons of the AB League were
 killed on that day.  Probably a mistake to kill someone like Liu Ta-lun)
 to the village to hold a mass meeting and propagandize the method of
 dividing the hills.  Seven new land executive secretaries were elected and
 hill division was decided on.  On that day, the propaganda officer reported
 on the matter of the poor people's loan office.  It was decided that it would
 be carried out.
 Hill division was even more difficult than land division.  As there were big
 and small hills, more or less firewood, big or small trees, or no tree at
 all, it was difficult to divide.   The land section chief and the seven
 executive secretaries went out together, covered all the hills in the village,
 and decided on the method.   Instead of dividing by area, the hills would be
 divided according to the amount of oil-bearing tea plants therein contained.
 One tan of "t'ao" (1 tan of tea-seed worth 2 strings of coppers, is known
 as 1 tan of "t'ao") was taken as the unit.  Thirty big plants, 60 medium
 ones, or 120 small ones were considered as 1 tan of "t'ao."  The hills of the
 entire village were converted into "t'ao," then evenly divided among the
 population and marked by stakes.  In Yang-fang Village, it took 4 days to
 divide the hills clearly.  The eight men of the land section had the
 authority to do the division, "not according to the opinions of the
 individuals, because the matter would never be settled if everyone had his
 say."
 In Ch'ang-chiao Village in the third township, the village government issued
 2.10 yuan to the five men of the land section (one chief and four executive
 secretaries) for. meals, and it took them over 30 days to complete the
 division.   "One can see how difficult it was!"
 Though the hills were divided, only the branches of the trees could be cut,
 not the trunks.   Government approval was required to cut down trees.

 With the village as the unit and according to the size of the ponds, the
 people were formed into teams to stock the ponds with fingerlings.   Five
 households formed one team for a big pond and three households for a small
 pond.   One team took charge of one pond.   All the households would do the
 stocking at the same time with the same number of fingerlings, and the
 fish, when caught, would be divided evenly.  Water for the ponds in the
 district was no problem; the problem was fish.   Some few mountain ponds had
 a water problem.   Thus, mountain ponds which could support fish were divided
 according to the above method.   For those which could not, they were
 assigned along with the farms, and whoever owned the farm owned the pond.
 The fingerlings stocked before the revolution would not be divided when grown
 and caught, but belonged to the persons stocking them.  When the ponds
 became dry in the winter this year, the original owners would catch the
 fish.   Only then would the new owners stock the ponds.
 4.  Division of Houses
 In principle, houses should be divided.  Many poor peasants with families
 of 10 or more members lived in two or three rooms. Generally speaking,
 the housing of 60 percent of the poor peasants was inadequate; the good
 houses were all occupied by the rich peasants.   The poor peasants all
 clamored for division of houses, but the government said:   "No official
 communication from above."  So, the poor peasants did not dare to go and
 live in the rich peasants' houses.  At the mass meeting in Yang-fang
 Village, the poor peasants demanded division of houses.   The land section
 chief said:   "Those with more rooms should give up a few to those not
 having enough."  But there was no resolution.   The rich peasants refused
 to yield, and the poor peasants did not dare to force the matter.   (One
 can see the importance of "communication from above!"
 The division of houses should be done with each village taken as a unit.
 For adjacent houses, those with more rooms should give some to those
 with less rooms.
 In the district, only the houses of landlords, rich peasants and unscrupulous
 merchants who had been killed or expelled due to their reaction--if such
 houses had not been burned (burning was not right)--were occupied by the
 poor peasants, but there was no formal allocation.   As for those who had
 not been killed or expelled, even if they had extra rooms, such rooms
 were not given to those with less rooms.
 In regard to the houses of counterrevolutionary landlords and rich peasants
 which were burned (burned by the guerrillas), there were 1 in the first
 township, 2 in the second, 5 in the third and 4 in the.fourth, altogether
 12, including the houses of three landlords and nine rich peasants.   In
 regard to houses of revolutionary workers and peasants which were burned

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 (burned by counterrevolutionaries), none in the first township, 7 in the
 second, 8 in the third and 8 in the fourth, altogether 23, including the
 houses of 1 middle peasant, 20 poor peasants, 1 small merchant and 1 vagrant.
 In the land division in the 2d month, public land was reserved in every
 township and every village.  In the first township, over 10 tan of land
 were reserved in Yang-fang Village and over 30 in Ch'an-kan Village.   In
 the second township, 11 tan were reserved in Chih-ko Village.   In
 Ch'ang-chiao Village of the third township, as land was scarce and 16 persons
 had not been allocated land, no public land was reserved.   All other villages
 reserved public land.   In Hou-ching Village in the fourth township, over
 100 tan of land were reserved, the entire parcel suffering from flood.  Why
 was public land reserved?  First, the remainder after division was hard
 to dispose of; thus, it was reserved.   For example, if everyone received
 7 tan, with a remainder of 10-odd tan, if divided, it would not be enough
 to let everyone have 1 t'ung [2729] each; therefore, the remainder was
 reserved as public land.  Second, it helped pay government expenses.   Third,
 it was in anticipation of sons to be born next year.  There would be a
 re-division in the 8th month, because official communication from above
 ordered thorough division, including the public land.
 Actually, it would have been better not to reserve public land.   First, as
 there are deaths as well as births, there is no worry of giving birth to a
 son without a farm.   Second, the government will get its revenue by land
 taxes; it does not have to rely on public farms for its expenses.   Further-
 more, as shown by the examples in the 2d month, all the public land reserva-
 tions are inferior and not very useful.   Therefore, it is better to divide
 all the land so that the peasants can get greater benefit.
 The villages varied.   In Yang-fang Village of the first township, for
 instance, each person received 5-6 tan of land (8 tan in the 2d month, but
 actually only 5-6 tan of grain could be harvested).   In Ch'a-kan Village,
 each person received 8 tan.   In Chih-ko Village in the second township,
 each person received 7 tan.   In Ch'ang-chiao Village in the third township,
 the amounts in the 2d and 8th months were different.   In the 2d month,
 there were four different allocations, 7 tan, 6 1/2 tan, 5 1/2 tan, and
 4 tan 1 t'ung.   The division was initially done on the basis of surnames.
 and people with more land refused to yield their land to people of different
 surnames.  Not until the 8th month was the land divided with each village
 considered as one unit, each person receiving 6 tan.   In Hou-ching of the
 fourth township, each person received 8.5 tan in the 2d month.  When the
 land was re-divided in the 8th month, inferior land which was previously
 counted as 2 tan but produced 1 tan was considered as 1 tan only.  There
 were also people returning from out-of-town.   As a result, each person
 received only 7.5 tan.

 Hsing-kuo produces only one crop a year.   According to the amount of land
 discussed above, there was barely enough .for everyone.   By planting miscel-
 laneous grains and raising pigs, the people could supply themselves with
 oil, salt, cloths and sundry goods.
 The major miscellaneous grain of the district is sweet potato, constituting
 40 percent of the staple food of the people.   The first township produces
 relatively less sweet potato, because of the soil.   It constitutes only
 20 percent of the staples.  The second and third townships are entirely
 different, the percentage of sweet potato consumed by the people as staple
 food amounts to from 50 to 70 percent.  Shredded potatoes mixed in rice
 are eaten all year round.   The people of the fourth township eat an
 average of 40 percent sweet potatoes.
 V.  Land Tax
 Known as "public welfare fund," land tax began to be collected at the
 beginning of the 8th month (lunar calendar):   1 percent on 6 tan of land
 (6 sheng per person), 1.5 percent on 7 tan of land, 2,5 percent on
 8 tan of land (2 tou per person), and 3.5 percent on 9 tan of land (3,15 tou
 per person).  No one in the district has 9 tan of land; therefore, the
 highest rate of public welfare fund is 2.5 percent.
 Yang-fang Village of the first township has a population of over 180, each
 allocated 8 tan of land (according to the figures of land division in the
 2d month).  At 2.5 percent, the total collection was 36.4 tan.  The
 397 population of Ch'a'-kan Village each received 8 tan of land, and the
 total tax collection was 79.4 tan.  No tax was collected on the 5.5 tan of
 land per person in Ch'ang-chiao Village in the third township.  (Tax
 was collected on 6 tan of land or more.)   This year the district will
 probably collect around 1,000 tan in taxes.
 The taxes collected in the 8th month are mostly deposited in the villages.
 A portion was delivered to the township government, but none to the district
 government.  During tax collection in the 8th month, the county government,
 in its official communication, permitted the people to pay in grain or cash
 by converting grain into cash at the conversion rate of 30 wen [2429] for
 1 catty of grain.  As the market price at that time was only 20 wen per catty,
 no one wanted to pay in cash.
 When the public welfare fund was first collected, 10 percent of the people
 objected to it.  When the officials came to their houses, they said:
 "You said before that we were to resist rents and taxes, but now you are
 collecting taxes again!"  When collecting the public welfare fund, the
 order from above was very urgent, allowing 3 days to deliver the grain
 to the township government.  The township government summoned the land
 section chiefs of the villages for a meeting.   The first township was
 divided into nine Red Guards brigades, and one member of each brigade
 (land section chief) attended the meeting.   It was decided that the

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 responsible persons of the villages should hold meetings and collect the
 taxes after the meeting.  No mass meeting was held.   Each brigade was taken
 as a unit for tax collection.   The 8th brigade, for instance, was organized
 by Yang-fang, Ling-yuan and Li-yao villages.   The brigade leader, land
 section chiefs, three team leaders and nine unit leaders proceeded to the
 three villages and collected household by household (each village consti-
 tuting a team).   They measured the grain.at each household, at 90 catties
 per tan, and the particular household delivered the grain to the township
 government.   The brigade collected almost 400 tan of grain in public welfare
 fund.   In Ch'a-kan Village of the 1st township, written notices were sent
 to the households 2 days in advance, requesting them to deliver the public
 welfare fund to the public granary.   On due date, the households carried
 the grain to the granary (formerly known as the public granary), and it
 was received by the responsible person (five men) of the township.   It took
 them less than a day to complete the job, receiving a total of more than
 70 tan of grain.   It was announced in advance that whoever did not deliver
 the grain on time would have to be responsible for the meal expenses of the
 five responsible persons.  To avoid such expenses, everyone delivered his
 grain on time.

 The district government is located in Yung-feng Market.
 Between the 2d and 9th months, there were held over 20 district mass meetings
 and 2 district delegates' meetings (delegates elected at mass meetings of
 the villages).  There were few district mass meetings before the 6th month.
 After the 6th month, as the struggles became intensified, many mass meetings
 were held.  After the 4th month, women and children all attended the mass

 Fu Chi-t'ing:  Poor peasant.
 Of the 10 persons above, there were 6 poor peasants, 2 middle peasants,
 1 rich peasant and 1 scholar from outside,
 Mass meetings in the township were much less frequent than the district--
 less than 10 times.
 Before the 4th month, women and children did not attend meetings, but they
 did after the 4th month.
 Some six or seven township delegates' meetings were held, attended by 30 to
 40 persons per township, with one to two delegates from each village.   Some
 non-delegates from villages near the township government also attended.
 Each meeting lasted 3 to 4 hours.  The delegates expressed themselves quite
 fully.  The chairman was elected pro tempore.,
 3.  Village Government
 There were village governments between the 2d and 5th months, because they
 were needed for land division.   Once the land was divided, it was no longer
 necessary to have a village government.  Furthermore, money would be needed
 to run a government.  Even if no meal was provided, there had to be some
 operation expenses.   After the revolution intensified and the land divided,
 every 10 households were organized into a group, and there was also the
 Red Guards brigade.   Therefore, it was alright not to have a village govern-
 ment.
 4.   Shortcomings of Government Personnel
 (1)   The first is bureaucraticism, putting on airs, and aversion to associat-
 ing with the masses.                    When the people ask for information in the government,
 the officials will say something when they feel like it, but when they don't,
 they will ignore them altogether, or even accuse them of "making trouble.
 (2)   They sell the things belonging to the reactionaries which have been con-
 fiscated instead of giving them to the poor.  People without connections
 in the government cannot buy them; only those with contact and who are
 articulate can buy them.   Furthermore, as the things are for sale, only
 people with some money can buy them, and the hired help and extremely poor
 peasants naturally have no share.
 (3)   They assign women to work in the government, always one or two in the
 township government, and three or four in the district government.   It is
 a good thing for women to work in the government, but the choice is not
 proper.   If a woman is not pretty, even if she is articulate and capable,
 she is not selected.   On the other hand, if she is pretty, even if

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 inarticulate and incapable, she is selected.   It is the same when the
 officials of the township government go to the villages to hold meetings.
 They will talk to the pretty women and ignore the plain ones.
 (4)   This is the major point.   It is the violation of the people's will.
 Government committee members are decided by a few, and elections at the
 delegates' meetings are mere formalities.   In one instance, the chairman
 asked the people to raise their hands if they approved of a certain person.
 Some people did not raise their hands, and the chairman accused them of
 belonging to the AB League.  Another time, the chairman glared at those not
 raising their hands and demanded to know why.   Furthermore, only communist
 party members may work in the government.   The non-members, even if they
 are mass leaders, cannot work in the government.   (I told the people
 attending the meeting that such bad things only happened in the early stage
 of the land revolution, that one of the reasons was that the components
 of government were not very good, and that there would be changes in the
 future, because such bad things were not right.)
 There were nine brigades in the first township, three in the second,
 four in the third and four in the fourth.   The method of organization was
 as follows:  8 to 12 persons constituted a unit, 3 units a team and 3 teams
 a brigade.  Generally, a brigade consisted of 80 to 90 persons in the town-
 ships of this district.   The 8th brigade in the first township, for instance,
 included the 1st team of Yang-fang, the 2d team of Ling-yuan and the 3d
 team of Li-yao, totaling over 90 persons.
 Members of the Red Guards were between the ages of 23 and 50.
 All members of the Red Guards were men.
 At the beginning, it was divided into regular and reserve Red Guards.   Sub-
 sequently, they were combined, without distinction of regular or reserve.
 The tasks of the Red Guards were patrolling day and night in every village.
 A patrol shed was required at the main entrance to every village.   In
 ordinary times, the Children's League and Young Pioneers patrolled in the
 day time.   The regulation called for five persons in one day, two from the
 Girls' League, two from the Boys' League, and one from the Young Pioneers
 doing the checking.   The Young Pioneers must be literate, able to read the
 passes.   A pass was required of everyone, regardless of who, and it was
 required even for traveling from village A to village B.  Night patrol was
 handled by the Red Guards, generally four persons a night, two persons per
 shift, one shift taking the first half of the night and the other shift the
 second half.  When the situation became tense (as when the pacification
 force advanced close to Chun-ts'un on the 7th day of the 7th month), the
 Red Guards patrolled both day and night, and additional personnel were

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 assigned patrol duty.  Though still 4 or 5 in day time, they were increased
 to 10 or more, or even 20 or more, at night.
 Each Red Guards brigade had a commander, who must be the most earnest person
 in the township and had some knowledge of military affairs, and a political
 commissar, who must also be the most earnest person in the township and able
 to read official documents.
 Drills were previously required of the Red Guards.  After organizing the
 Red Army reserve in the 7th month, they were abolished.
 The Red Guards was divided into men's and women's Red Guards.   The 8th brigade
 jointly organized by Yang-fang, Ling-yuan and Li-yao villages in the first
 township, for instance, consisted of men's Red Guards 8th brigade and women's
 Red Guards 8th brigade.   The age limits for women were the same as for men,
 but there were fewer members, because the number of women was smaller than
 men, and the pregnant and nursing women were excluded.   Generally, each con-
 sisted of 40 persons (the third brigade of the second township) to 50 persons
 (the 8th brigade of the first township; the 3d brigade of the third township).
 Sometimes, it could be less than 40 or more than 50.  Women Red Guards
 ordinarily did not perform patrol duty.   In emergencies when the men Red
 Guards sallied forth (going out on combat duty was called "sallying forth"),
 the women would handle the patrolling.   The women Red Guards must also drill,
 once a month, lasting 2 or 3 hours.   The brigade leader and political commis-
 sar were both women.   Drilling was conducted by a member of the men's Red
 Guards.  When the able-bodied men in the Red Guards were organized into the
 Red Army reserve in the 6th month, leaving some 10, 20 or 30 old weak per
 brigade, drilling was abolished.   For the men's Red Guards, there were a
 commander and a political commissar in each township.  They were not
 stationed in the township government, but remained in their own homes.  When
 the occasion arose, they were assigned wherever needed.   They must attend
 the township-wide drills.   The Red Guards of the various townships had held
 township-wide drills twice.
 2.  Young Pioneers
 Wherever there was a Red Guards brigade, there was a Young Pioneer brigade.
 The members included both male and female, age 16 to 23.   There were a
 brigade commander and a political commissar.   Each brigade consisted of three
 teams, and each team three units.   But the number of members was less than
 that of a Red Guards brigade, ranging from 20 (Chi-ko village in the second
 township, 30 (Ch'ang-chiao village of the third township), to 50 to 60 (the 3
 villages in the first township including Yang-fang).   Groups of 20 to 30 were
 called teams; groups of 50 to 60 were called brigades.   Since the 6th month,
 courageous elements were selected and organized into the Red Army reserve
 and the district Special Service Battalion.   The remaining members of the
 pioneers still had to drill, twice a month.   Only the men's Red Guards no
 longer had to drill since its able-bodied elements were organized into the
 Red Army reserve.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 After the pioneers were organized into the Red Army reserve and district
 Special Service Battalion, very few members were left.   Some places did not
 have a Young Pioneer at all (such as the three villages in the first
 township, including Yang-fang; and Chih-ko village of the second township).
 3.   Children's League
 There was no distinction of male or female.  The age limit was 8 to 15.
 Where there were Red Guards and Young Pioneers, there was a laboring
 Children's League.   Each village had a league leader, none in the townships
 but one in the district.
 The work of the Children's League was first, patrolling, next, checking on
 opium smoking and gambling, and last, eliminating superstition and knocking
 down buddha idols.   The Children's League was most ruthless in checking
 on opium smoking and gambling and in knocking down idols,   They gave no
 quarter, "truly handling public affairs in a public way."   They attended
 mass meetings.   Their weapons consisted mainly of wooden guns, with a few
 lances.
 All members of the league were students of the people's school.   The people's
 school was started in the 7th month, five in the first township, three in
 the second, seven in the third and one in the fourth, totaling 16.  The
 district government provided for three such schools in every township and
 paid for the food of three teachers, 0.10 yuan, large currency, per day,
 and 2 yuan, large currency, for expenses per month, totaling 5 yuan, large
 currency, per month.    As the area of the first township was large, it was
 permitted to have five schools.   The third township had many hills, and
 three schools were not enough; therefore, they had four additional ones,
 totaling seven, but the expenses were still limited to 15 yuan, averaging
 2.10 yuan per school.   The number of enrollment ranged from 20 or more to
 120, usually over 40.   The people's school jointly established by Yang-fang,
 Ling-yuan and Li-yao villages of the first tonwship, for instance, had over
 120 children between the ages of 8 and 15.
 The housing was insufficient, and one teacher could not handle all of them;
 therefore, many could not attend school.   Only around 60 of the 120 were in
 school.   Originally, the three villages wanted to have three schools, but
 they had no teachers in the villages, nor did they have the money to pay
 for outside help.   Therefore, they could not have three schools.   The school
 in Chu-chao-an Village in the third township had only 21 students.
 Every village had a people's night school.   Each school had one teacher,
 who was someone in the village who could read a little.  He received no pay,
 pursuing his own occupation at home during day time and teaching at night.
 Fu Chi-t'ing of Yang-fang and Chung Te-wu of Ch'ang-chiao were both night
 school teachers.   The number of students varied.   The school in Yang-fang
 had 40 students.   The students were of all ages, old, adult and young.

 Approved For Release 2008/03/19: CIA-RDP04-0146OR000100010001-6
 Most of the night schools had women students, about one-third.   Some did not
 have women students, such as Ch'a-kan Village of the first township and
 Hou-ching Village of the fourth township.   The Children's League was drilled
 three times a week, under the direction of the people's school, "drilling
 well."
 4.  Picket Units
 The Picket Unit was organized by workers, one company per township, with
 a company commander and a political commissar.   The Picket Unit of the second
 township consisted of 105 men.  Yang-fang, Ling-yuan and Ch'a-shih (Ch'a-kan)
 villages of the first township together had one platoon, consisting of 26 men.
 5.  Red Army Reserve
 The Red Army reserve was organized from the strong and courageous elements in
 the Red Guards and the Young Pioneers, two companies per township, totaling
 eight companies in the district.   Each company consisted of several dozen
 to over 100 men.   The two companies in the first township had over 100 men
 each.   For the Hsin-yu campaign this time, all the eight companies of the
 10th district participated.   After its formation in the 7th month, the
 reserve was responsible for the advances on Ch'i-fang, Lang-ch'uan and Kan-chou,
 and on Hsin-yu this time.  When the reserve was away on a campaign, the Red
 Guards, the Young Pioneers, and the Children's League were responsible for
 village patrolling.   Upon its return, the reserve again joined the patrol.
 The eight companies of the district formed a regiment, with a regiment
 commander and a political commissar.   In ordinary times, there was no
 battalion.   The 1st and 2d companies belonged to the first township, the
 3d and 4th companies to the second township, the 5th and 6th companies to
 the third township, and the 7th and 8th companies to the fourth township.
 For the Hsin-yu campaign this time, three battalions were formed, with the
 1st, 2d and 3d companies as the 1st battalion, the 4th, 5th and 6th companies
 as the 2d battalion, and the 7th and 8th companies as the 3d battalion, led
 by battalion commanders and political commissars.   Each company had four
 porters, eight cooks, one to two messengers, one orderly, one bugler (unable
 to bugle), but no horse.   Each company also had two propaganda officers, with
 the duties of talking and writing slogans.   The battalion headquarters had
 no propaganda officer, aide or messenger.   The regimental headquarters had
 three propaganda officers, one aide and two messengers.  Members of the three
 battalion headquarters lived together with those of the regimental head-
 quarters, sharing their meals.  Weapons were lances and shotguns.
 6.   District Special Service Battalion
 It consisted of three companies, beginning to be organized in the 7th month,
 also selected among the Red Guards and Young Pioneers.   Organized from the
 younger and more courageous elements, it was better than the Red Army
 Reserve.   The members had organization and training, but were not regularly
 concentrated. Ordinarily they remained at home pursuing their own occupation.
 Three large drills were held every month, on the 2d, 12th and 22d days.

 When needed, they were mustered to go out on campaigns.   Currently, the
 1st and 3d companies were out fighting in Lang-ch'uan; the 2d company remained
 at home. Their weapons were mainly shotguns, native rifles, native cannons,
 some lances, but no regular rifle.   The battalion headquarters was at the
 district government.   The battalion had a commander and a political commissar.
 7.   Red Army Independent Regiment
 Hsing-kuo organized a total of three independent regiments, all presented to
 the Red Army.  Also selected among the Red Guards and the Young Pioneers;
 they were the same in excellency as the Special Service Battalion.   They
 were all young people and volunteers.   Each regiment consisted of over
 1,000 men. The regiments, battalions and company all had commanders and
 political commissars.   The regiments underwent concentrated training at
 the county seat, and the members awaited assignment to the Red Army.  They
 were all unarmed.

 DUTIES OF GENERAL POLITICAL DEPARTMENT AND RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE RED
 ARMY POLITICAL DEPARTMENTS AND COMMISSARS
 Order No 6 of the Revolutionary Military Commission, 17 February 1931
 [Text] To organize a revolutionary war, a war to destroy the warlords, is
 currently the central task of the revolution.   To carry out this task, we
 must create an iron Red Army, and win over the broad masses of the people;
 accordingly the strengthening of political education in the Red Army, so
 that commanders and fighters will understand their tasks and resolutely
 carry them out, and at the same time intensified propagandizing and
 organization of the masses, and mobilization of the broad masses within
 the war zone to arise and struggle, have become our most pressing tasks.
 These tasks are performed by the Red Army's political commissars and
 political departments.   To oversee these tasks for Red Army units in all
 areas, a General Political Department is necessary.  At present the Red
 Army units throughout the country have made great progress; but unifying
 and strengthening their political direction have become a pressing need.
 To meet this need, we have set up a General Political Department in this
 Commission under the chairmanship of Mao Tse-tung.  Out of practical
 necessity, this. Commission's General Political Department will also serve
 temporarily as the First Front Army's General Political Department.
 The General Political Department will direct the Red Army's political de-
 partments and guide the political work of the political commissars.   The
 Red Army political departments must give absolute obedience to the
 General Political Department's orders.   Orders relating to political work
 must likewise be accepted and obeyed by the political commissars. Every
 Red Army political department must make reports to the General Political
 Department regularly and through channels.   Political commissars may make
 reports to political commissions at higher levels, but in addition they
 must make reports on political work to the political department at the next
 higher level.   Organizationally, the Red Army political departments and
 political commissars have their own individual organization systems, but in
 their work the lower-level political departments take orders from the
 upper-level political departments, and at the same time they must also
 follow the orders of the political commissars at the same level; the

 lower-level political commissars take orders from the upper-level political
 commissars, but in political work they also follow the orders of the upper-
 level political department.

 NO INVESTIGATION, NO RIGHT TO SPEAK, NO PROPER INVESTIGATION AND NO RIGHT TO
 SPEAK
 Notice of General Political Department on Social Investigation No--2 April 1931
 [Text]   All Red Army Political Departments and Local Governments at All Levels
 We have now drawn up population and land investigation forms.   In the main,
 these call for statistics on the proportions of land and population by class,
 so as to answer more concretely and with ironclad facts many of our current
 questions.
 In the past, investigation of the actual facts was frequently scorned in
 many localities, and work plans were drawn up and used to direct the work
 of lower levels merely on the basis of things thought up out of thin air.
 As a result the plans could not be carried out and leadership went wrong.
 If we can now fill in these forms with correct statistics, arrived at by
 close attention to reality, we will be able to solve many of our problems.
 In particular, there are a number of practical land distribution problems
 in connection with which we hope that Red Army political departments will
 carefully fill in information for all localities and local governing organs
 will fill in information for each township.  We especially hope that every
 responsible person in the Red Army and the government will at all times and
 places perform  these investigations and do these statistics.
 Just what is needed to make the data from these investigations really correct?
 First, it is necessary to have a deep understanding of this work and a clear
 idea of its importance before one can undertake it in earnest.
 Second, it the investigators must investigate a village painstakingly; they
 must seek out the records of population and land surveys made for land
 distribution; they must seek out the members of the land committee that
 carried out the land distribution and people who are well acquainted with
 the situation in the village; they must begin by clearly distinguishing the
 class nature of each family and each field (whether it belongs to a landlord,
 rich peasant, middle peasant or poor peasant...), and then calculate things
 out strictly, filling in the form with the actual numbers.

 Third, the comrades sent out by the higher government levels to direct the
 survey, or the responsible persons of the political departments, must explain
 clearly to the persons assigned the investigation work the content of the two
 forms and the points for attention when investigating.   In particular they
 must explain that:   the standard for a rich peasant is that he depended upon
 exploitation for a sizeable part of his income; those who are engaged in extend-
 ing credit or lending money to others are still classed as middle peasants,
 and those who were hired laborers (before the revolution) and have rented
 some land to cultivate are poor peasants; those none of whose family does
 any farming but who rely upon their independent labor (tailors, carpenters,.
 etc.) to make a living are called independent laborers; those who do some
 farming and some artisan work are classed as poor peasants, middle peasants
 and rich peasants according to their economic status; free tradesmen and
 vagrants are distinguished by the fact that free tradesmen practice some
 specific trade (as doctor, teacher), while vagrants have no fixed occupation
 or mode of life, but all do a good deal of mischief.
 If all of these items are not clearly understood during the investigation, the
 investigators will not know how to do their jobs properly, and will surely
 get the class composition wrong and get wrong values in the statistics.
 When these two forms, for land and population, are filled out in close
 cordination, care should be taken that the individual or group fills them
 out correctly.  They should then be mailed directly to the General Political
 Department of the Central Military Commission.   Our slogan is:
 1.   No investigation, no right to speak;
 2.   No correct investigation, also no right to speak.

 QUESTION OF OPPOSING RICH PEASANTS
 Notice Number 2 of Central Revolutionary Military Commission, 1931
 [Text]    1.   Reasons for Opposing the Rich Peasants
 First, rich peasants are rural semi-landlords and capitalists, and an exploit-
 ing class.                     They support feudal power and want to be capitalists, and are
 entirely in opposition to the interests of the workers, hired farm laborers,
 poor peasants and the mass of middle peasants.   In order to guard the
 interests of the workers, hired farm laborers, poor peasants and middle
 peasants, we must oppose the rich peasants.
 Second, the rich peasants are an exploiting class.   They are constantly in
 close collusion with reactionary power in an attempt to undermine the
 revolution.   To consolidate the soviet governments and protect the victory
 of land reform, we must oppose the middle peasants.
 Third, the rich peasants are taking the capitalist road.  We are taking the
 socialist road.   Therefore, they are completely opposite to us, and in order
 to make the revolution advance to the road of socialism we must intensify
 the struggle to oppose the rich peasants.
 2.   Errors in Opposing the Rich Peasants
 In an examination of opposition to the rich peasants in the past, four major
 errors appear:
 First, opposition to exploitation was not taken as the test, and opposition
 to the rich peasants was treated as a speical form of fund-raising.   Rather
 than exploitation, possession of money was used as the test.  Money tests,
 in which for example people with less than 100 yuan were not beaten, but
 those with more than 100 yuan were beaten, were used by brigades, and in a
 minority of places it got to the point that people with more than 20 cash or
 an old sow got beaten, which terrified the masses and made them think the
 revolution was. to make everybody poor instead of making everybody rich and
 improving their lives.

 Second, there were encroachments on the middle peasants.   The second fault,
 of encroaching on the middle peasants' interests, grew out of the first
 fault. Middle peasants are those who have enough land and enough food and
 are not exploited by anyone, but also do not go out and exploit anyone else.
 Not only should these people not be encroached upon, but we should link up
 closely with them instead and all oppose the rich peasants together.  Since
 the middle peasants will only join a revolution led by the proletariat,
 our revolutionary power can only reach its full force and the revolution
 can only develop rapidly when we unite with them.
 Third, the rich peasants' lands were not thoroughly redistributed.   In many
 places the land distribution was conducted just by taking away excesses and
 making up deficiencies rather than by taking away from rich lands and
 compensating poor lands.  When the rich peasants held such things as good
 lands, woodland, dwellings and ponds, these were not thoroughly distributed.
 As a result the rich peasants were in a favored position economically and
 got hold of political leadership.   The soviets' governments and the revolu-
 tionary groups were captured by the rich peasants, who then used their
 political and economic power to exploit and oppress and impoverish the
 peasant masses.
 3.   The Correct Method of Opposing the Rich Peasants
 a.   Politically
 First, consolidate proletarian leadership.   The soviet governments and Red
 Army and Red Guards units should prevent rich peasants from acting as
 committee members in the soviet governments or representatives to the soviet
 assemblies.  They should elect leaders of the workers, farm laborers and
 poor peasants and the most activist elements of the middle peasants to
 deliberate and take action; they should also organize poor peasants'
 associations and unite the broad masses of poor peasants and the middle
 peasants in a good alliance to oppose the rich peasants.  All those who
 have encroached on the middle peasants' interests or fined them or taken
 money from the poor peasants must make restitution, and the lawless exactions
 of brigands, which have no class nature and are divorced from the masses
 must be opposed.   If these things continue to happen, they will assuredly be
 punished by the authorities.
 Second, put down rich peasant reaction.   The rich peasants are an exploiting
 class, and are sure to use every available means to oppose and subvert the
 revolution.  Accordingly, in the soviet areas, constant and strict attention
 should be paid to preventing rich peasant reaction; as soon as any rich
 peasant counterrevolutionary organization, such as the Ya-pi-t'uan, etc.,
 is found conspiring with the White bandits, plotting reactionary activity,
 trying to subvert the revolution, etc., the government must punish it
 strictly as being counterrevolutionary.   The rich peasants will be allowed
 to live and pursue their livelihood only if they obey all laws of the
 soviets and refrain from counterrevolutionary conspiracies or activities.

 b.  Economically
 First, oppose exploitation by the rich peasants.   At present, opposition to
 the rich peasants is not destruction of the rich peasants, but chiefly a
 resolute opposition in the economic sphere to all their exploitative acti-
 vities, because these activities have increased the hardships of our
 workers and poor peasants.  The rich peasants will be allowed to hire
 laborers, so long as they treat them in accordance with the Laws for
 Protection of Labor.   They may not treat them harshly.   They may also engage
 in business, but will not be allowed to hold back on buying or selling or
 to lend money at high interest.  These more specific methods should be deter-
 mined by the county government and preferably by the county assembly, in
 accordance with local conditions.  A program of this sort is not meant to
 eradicate capitalism but to oppose cruel exploitation by capitalists and
 to stimulate the vigorous development of social economics.   In the cases
 where exaction of money from the rich peasants is unavoidable, this should
 be done only for revolutionary needs.   The rich peasants should bear what
 they can afford.   But at present we are not eradicating the rich peasant
 economy.  As to the rich peasants' lands, they should all be distributed
 evenly.
 Second, an economic policy should be carried out.   The limiting of rich
 peasant exploitation discussed above is still a passive method.   But merely
 passive opposition to poor peasants is not enough; we must also carry out
 an economic policy, in accordance with the social situation, to actively
 oppose the rich peasants.  For instance, the government should lead the
 masses in running loan cooperatives that lend money to the impoverished masses
 at low interest, in running production cooperatives to develop products, and
 in running trade cooperatives so as to lessen the exploitation carried on
 between businessmen and rich peasants.   Such organizations actively oppose
 exploitation by rich peasants.   If we help the broad impoverished masses
 take this step toward liberation, we are preparing social economics to
 develop toward socialism.
 4.   Guard Against Lingering Evils
 Our earlier pointing out of errors in opposing middle peasants, and the
 statement that we are not now eradicating the rich peasants, should not lead
 people to take opposing the rich peasants lightly.   On the contrary, everyone
 should understand the policy of opposing the rich peasants and should oppose
 them even more intensely.   In rectifying policies, we should prevent rich
 peasant elements and their helpers hidden in the revolution from easing up
 on the work of opposing the rich peasants.   Even more important, the rich
 peasants should be prevented from taking the opportunity to oppose the government.
