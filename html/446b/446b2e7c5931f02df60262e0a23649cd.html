ASSESSMENT OF DISSIDENCE LEVELS IN 1965  
IN FIVE PROVINCES OF SOUTHERN CHINA 
Summary 
Though dissidence in southern China -- Szechwan, Kweichow, Yunnan, 
Kwangsi, and Kwangtung -- is not declining, it is increasingly translated 
into apathy and resignation, and significant indigenous resistance is not 
known to exist. 
An examination of selected examples of dissident activity in 1965, 
ranging from overt acts of an operational nature to simple evasion of 
militia responsibilities, shows that the regime is everywhere in full 
control of the country. The disproportionate amount of resources being 
poured into the control effort through consecutive campaigns of the inter-
minable Socialist Education Movement, however, may be an unfavorable 
augury for the regime. 
The coastal regions of Kwangtung, including Hainan Island, and Fukien 
(outside the study area) are the most dissident. Inland, there is little 
evidence of active dissidence either in the minority areas or in the ethnic 
Chinese areas of the other four provinces. Reasonably adequate infor-
mation is available only from Kwangtung, but hypothetical levels of 
dissidence elsewhere are judged not to exceed those of Kwangtung as 
there is little qualitative difference in reports received. 
Popular dissidence has less chance of significant flowering than has 
intraparty dissidence, which can feed on provocative contradictions 
already present in Kwangtung. The logic of the situation points to 
evisntual loosening of the tight control system, as intraparty dissidence 
increases, until some kind of semiovert political action becomes possible. 
Such a process might well begin among the cadres and populace of the 
Kwangtung coast, because the youthful population there is relatively 
sophisticated and has extensive relationships with the Overseas Chinese.

I. The Situation in Southern China  
This study assesses present dissidence levels in five southern prov-
inces of Communist China and attempts to identify manifestations of 
internal political weakness. The five provinces under examination --
Szechwan, Kweichow, Yunnan, Kwangsi, and Kwangtung -- are not an estab-
lished regional grouping, and for this reason, the indefinite appellation 
"southern China" is used. All five provinces, however, have large 
non-Mandarin-speaking or non-Chinese minority population groups and, 
except for Kweichowl. are contiguous to areas that were either dissident 
in the recent past (Tibet) or are under foreign control (Burma, Laos, 
and North Vietnam). The most conspicuous geographical features they 
share are (a) remoteness from seats of central control; (b) poor overland 
communications with the rest of China and with each other; and (c) pro-
vincial economies which could sustain themselves in absence of assistance 
from the rest of China or from the outside. 
During 1965 southern China continued to labor under longstanding 
problem of economic stagnation and popular weariness. Both problems 
were rendered more burdensome by the regime's dogged determination to 
achieve at almost any cost the reconditioning of the people and of the 
cadres to draw them away from individualistic economic and political 
incentives. This reconditioning effort had originated in the decisions 
of the 10th Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee in September 1962. 
It took form in the Socialist Education Movement (SEM) which began to 
unfold in 1963. Since then, no area of southern China has entirely 
escaped a seemingly interminable series of SEM campaigns to screen both 
leadership and populace through rectification of abuses and errors and 
cleansing of motives and records. (Some reports forecast a duration of 
7 years for these plagues.) Large task forces of students and cadres 
have descended on communes and other production units to carry out the 
necessary exhaustive checks. 
During 1965 the SEM thrust remained directed toward revitalization 
of the ongoing "class struggle," which is still the most important 
ideological objective. This was to be accomplished by organization of 
Poor and Lower Middle Peasant Associations (PLMPA); by investigative 
and punitive pressure on hidebound, weakly motivated, or corrupt cadres 
through the Four Clearances campaign (concentrating on the past perform-
ances of people whose backgrounds had survived earlier scrutiny); and by 
a new Three-Anti campaign in the eastern cities to strengthen internal 
security and job performance. 
These campaigns were supported by a variety of economic and social 
measures, some apparently experimental, which were designed to improve 
management practices. Commune accounting practices, agricultural credit 
facilities, and arrangements for marketing consumer goods received much 
attention. There were also efforts to begin to improve the morale of

urban workers assigned to the countryside through a new system of rota-
tional work assignments to rural villages, a system that offered a chance 
of ultimate return to the city. A vast new program to improve rural 
literacy and education through new part-time schools was carried forward. 
Meanwhile, resettlement policies were kept in motion to distribute un-
needed city dwellers, including unemployed youth, to state farms and to 
home-village communes. The prevailing response was sluggish and per-
functory. Though the SEM cut deeply, the people of Chita have tolerated 
it so far because they are habituated to such procedures and also because 
daily necessities were distributed with reasonable fairness and in greater 
quantity than in other years of greater distress. 
As before, militia and People's Liberation Army (PLA) recruitment was 
carried out late in the year but against a backdrop of war drums, which 
was no help to recruitment. In 1965 there was a much heavier emphasis on 
militia recruitment and on improvement of training and military effective-
ness. However attractive the conditions of military service were for 
peasant young folk in many areas, enlistment in 1965 was unattractive to 
city young folk, especially to those of "questionable" family backgrounds 
who would encounter discrimination in the service. That the regime was 
having trouble generally in making enlistment attractive is suggested by 
continuation of the Lei Feng and similar hero-worshipping campaigns. The 
nonmilitary nature of the accidental deaths for these new culture heroes 
is not easily explained. Perhaps even peasant youth, though of pure class 
background, needed both the stimulus of shining example and reassurance 
that death in battle was unlikely. Even the dull could see the possibility 
of surviving military service if, unlike these new heroes, he was careful 
to stay out from under falling poles, to handle grenades with respect, and 
not to plunge into holes while fighting forest fires. If the popular mood 
had been one of ready support for foreign entanglements; surely more 
red-blooded heroes with a good deal more eagerness to slay foreign devils 
would have been found. Instead, propagandists belabored fading myths of 
Communist-won victory in the Pacific War and of American defeat in the 
Korean War. 
Adequate information on movements of people as labor levies is lacking, 
but this only means that they went unreported. There was probably new and 
unsettling urgency in the mobilization of labor for distant construction 
projects, because strategic needs of overriding importance moved to the 
fore. Removal of industry from eastern China to inland cities such as 
Ch'eng-tu continued. In transportation, at long last and more in embar-
rassment than in triumph because of the years of previous delay, the 
Kweichow - Szechwan railroad was finished and work continued on the still 
unfinished Kweichow - Yunnan link, a route requiring much tunneling. 
Economic stringency continued unabated in 1965, and support for North 
Vietnam may have become more of an economic depressant than a stimulant. 
Industrial managers carried on from minor crisis to minor crisis, and their

working forces were subject to transfer and dismissal despite spot short-
ages of labor. The telltale national propaganda emphasis on economy at 
all cost continued, implying that costly diseconomies in the industries 
concerned still continued. 
In sum, 1965 in southern China was not unlike the years that had 
immediately preceded it. The economy was stagnant, the population was 
dispirited, and factory dismissals and population dispersion to the 
countryside were a continuing threat to worker morale. The year was 
conspicuous for the absence of enough jobs even for trained youth, let 
alone untrained. Political campaigns followed one another in steady 
sequence, sifting local leadership down to an awesome depth without 
introducing any new interest through fresh and vivid symbols. Incessant 
propaganda for the continuing urgency of the class struggle hung over 
the south like a pall -- unprogressive, unconvincing, uncompromising, 
and totally unavoidable. 
II. Problems of Assessment 
A. Source Material 
Little information pertaining to active dissidence is available 
from Szechwan, Kweichow, Yunnan, Kwangsi, or even Kwangtung, although the 
combined population of these five provinces is almost equal to that of the 
United States. Kwangtung has more than 38,000,000 people, but only from 
those parts that are in communication with communities of Overseas Chinese 
is intelligence reporting reasonably adequate in volume. For the rest of 
Kwangtung and for Kwangsi and Yunnan, some useful information is available;25X1C 
25X1C but for Szechwan and Kweichow there is almost nothing. 
Direct evidence of dissidence comes from ref ees 
travelers, 
Indirect evidence helping to identify areas of potential difficulty can 
be gleaned from the propaganda output of the regime, because a great many 
good and bad local examples and instructive case studies are publicized 
for the guidance of cadre readers. 
25X1C 
B. Terminology  
In this study "dissidence" is used to mean a state of mind involving 
discontent or disaffection with the ruling regime, and "resistance" is 
used to mean dissidence translated into action. Because the terminology 
of the subject is difficult to control, certain qualifications of these 
definitions need to be stated. Resistance, or action, does not always 
follow from dissidence, and both terms can be so used as to arouse un-
justifiable exceptions by assumed implications. Popular resistance is 
a phenomenon which the regime understands. However, many other aspects 
of dissent -- ordinary stubbornness, intellectual and administrative

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
"resistance," individual soul searching, dissatisfaction, disaffection, 
rationalization, and alienation -- may limit or encourage suppressed 
dissidence without pointing toward overt resistance. The train of in-
fluence from such manifestations is especially hard to follow when neg-
ative reactions are not directed squarely against the regime and its 
agents but instead take an oblique course. 
Allowance must also be made in describing or assessing actions that 
are compulsive. At the popular level, when dissident manifestations are 
compulsive, they may be conspicuous but still weakly directed and lacking 
in purpose, and thus their significance is lowered. If such types of 
protest and reaction are not suppressed and rationalized into apathy and 
resignation or into a conditioned compliance with private reservations, 
spectacular but pointless events may occur. A food riot is a good example. 
The participants are unlikely to proceed toward political goals when 
their first objectives are satisfied by corrective action that is simple 
and immediate. Their "resistance" is of little long-term significance 
except to further discredit local cadres, whose discomfiture and possible 
demoralization may be the only significant consequence. 
Within the CCP and its auxiliaries, dissident impulses even when 
strong are likely to be suppressed under the pressure of personal respon-
sibility and self-concern and transformed into something other than 
resistance. Such suppressed reactions hold in them the distant promise 
of the liberalization that has begun to take place within the USSR. 
Finally, in this study it is recognized that there is a level or 
range of dissidence which is normal and tolerable in every political 
system, even that of Communist China, and that dissidence falling within 
that range does not usually constitute an appreciable control problem. 
In healthy democratic countries, where dissent is respected and channeled 
legitimately into the political process, the dissidence level is very high. 
In totalitarian countries, where it is carefully watched, dissidence 
levels still may range from very low to moderate without endangering the 
stability of the state or of the Party. Even very small displays of overt 
dissidence are vigorously suppressed in Communist China, and for this 
reason actions which would be trifles in Western countries merit exami-
nation when reported from Communist China. Even appreciable amounts of 
dissidence, however, though indicative of genuine trouble may be no 
threat to the state or to Party control of the state. They are generally 
ineffective as long as they are mostly transformed into apathy and res-
ignation at the popular level or into stylized compliance coupled with 
conscientious suppression of reservations at the cadre level. 
C. Analytical Pitfalls  
Considering the magnitude of the field in southern China, the size 
of the intelligence sample covering dissidence is unfinitesimal. Coverage

is best for Kwangtung, and reports from the other provinces are not 
qualitatively dissimilar. They stress events that are similar and, often, 
of equal triviality. It is reasonable, therefore, to conclude that in 
the four provinces other than Kwangtung dissidence levels are probably 
no higher than those in Kwangtung. They are probably no lower than those 
in the noncoastal parts of Kwangtung. Along the coast the people are 
less timid, more sophisticated, and more aware of the world of the Over-
seas Chinese. Comparisons of the extent of dissidence also need to be 
used cautiously. Apathy and resignation at the popular level are probably 
widespread. The inference that ipso facto a great deal of potentially 
active dissidence should exist throughout the five provinces, however, 
is not necessarily true. In fact, the opposite may be true. 
Comparisons between the two main types of dissidence -- intraparty 
and popular -- are hazardous. The more insidious intraparty dissidence 
is less conspicuous than the more tangible popular dissidence. Qualitative 
tests are especially applicable to intraparty situations, whereas assess-
ment of popular dissidence comes down to the weighing of simple magnitudes. 
Further, the two worlds of work and action are accessible from the outside 
in entirely different degrees. The populace is almost entirely out of 
reach in contrast to the cadres and Party members, who are better informed, 
more alert, and more susceptible to outside stimuli. 
The theoretical dissidence potential created by cloth rations that 
are inadequate provides an example. This situation is a standing reproach 
to the regime. It is essentially absurd that the populace should be 
deprived of what it could either make for itself by cottage methods or 
could secure from efficient factories in a properly working consumption 
economy. The responsible cadre who controls cloth rationing operates in 
a system of responsibility which is different from that of the peasant. 
The peasant's desire is for clothing. If he is issued cloth, deprivation 
is eliminated as a cause of dissidence, and there is no objective to 
justify active dissidence. The senior cadre, however, has needs that 
can hardly be met, short of overhaul of the national economy. Working 
under pressure from both sides, he tries to satisfy the people, the Party, 
and himself. When demands from below are importunate and demands from 
above are unreasonable, his own obvious need is for a situation in which 
he can perform both responsibly and effectively. Such a need may lead 
him privately to try to change the system or to conduct himself as though 
the system had indeed been changed. Put another -way, the peasant's prob-
lem, his need for cloth, is material, and his career does not hang on 
the receipt of such cloth. The cadre's problem is organizational, and 
his career in the system hangs on administering the situation he is handed 
so as to avoid trouble for himself. Peasant dissidence has nowhere to 
go, unless a riot can be called an achievement. Cadre dissidence, on the 
other hand, conceivably has a great deal to gain through keeping the issue 
alive in order to achieve far-reaching changes in the distribution system 
without eliminating the cadre.

III. Selected Examples of Dissidence 
The accompanying map, Dissidence in Southern China: Selected Problem  
Areas, 1965, identifies general areas from which reports reflective of 
dissident acts or especially weak cadre performance during 1965 were 
received. The greatest concentration of dissidence is close to the coast, 
where a tough-minded population simmers in virtual silence. Dissidence 
levels in the other two areas appear to be lower. 
A. Overt Acts 
The year 1965 was not as productive of reported overtly dissident 
acts as was 1964. The most spectacular event definitely known to have 
occurred in southern China took place on Hainan on 5 February or shortly 
after. It included the burning of warehouses, destruction of some other 
facilities, and killing of a number of Communist cadres. The exact 
location is uncertain, although the press service report placed it in 
Wen-chang Hsien. As if to corroborate this report, the Chinese Communists 
later announced that, as of June 1965, the PLA was "actively assisting 
the local militia in raising their political consciousness and improving 
their military skills." This was in the Wu-chih Shan of central Hainan, 
a guerrilla-base area of the past and the area in which GRC agents were 
captured in 1963. The announcement implied that the local militia per-
formance was unsatisfactory until this PLA "assistance" brought a rise 
in both enthusiasm and abilities. 
Swatow and its environs experienced some terrorism beginning early in 
the year and an augmentation of repressive activity later in the year. 
Uncorroborated reports speak of two explosions in early April -- one in 
the naval yard -- which were followed by some 300 arrests and also of 
twin explosions in an automotive workshop and in a "chemical factory" on 
11 November. Again, the best confirmatory evidence that such events 
took place was provided by the regime, which in August began to subject 
Swatow to an intensive anti-escape, anti-corruption, anti-rumor, and 
anti-sabotage campaign. Although propagandists often use the word 
"sabotage" metaphorically, a convincing scale of punishments was reported 
for problems of malingering and "destruction" of equipment, ranging from 
5 to 10 years for light offenses to death for serious offenses. Meanwhile, 
transmission of rumors was also on the increase. 
Food riots must have diminished in 1965. The only one which has been 
reported apparently occurred in Jao-p'ing, 50 kilometers northeast of 
Swatow on the Fukien border, during the Chinese New Year period. The 
uncorroborated report states that 3,000 people took part and that it was 
put down by troops. Canton also experienced terrorism during the Chinese 
New Year period. Of several explosions reported, perhaps the most serious 
was one in a textile plant on the day itself, when, reportedly, scores 
were killed or injured. On 19 January an explosion in downtown Canton

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
was accompanied by distribution of anti-regime pamphlets, although 
possession of these pamphlets draws such vicious punishment that it is 
hard to believe many are read. Later, in early May, a large factory 
was "destroyed" by an explosion, which was followed by an explosion in 
a local railroad station. Once again, the authorities gave some support 
to these uncorroborated reports by initiating in September a campaign 
against rumors, escapes, corruption, and discontent, during which ship-
yard workers learned that the Hsi-ts'un Cement Factory had been damaged 
by a worker. The culprit was apprehended in August and sentenced --
rather lightly it seems, if the sabotage was tangible -- to 20 years 
of hard labor. 
Apparently these terroristic events were successful in their purpose. 
Whether they were carried out by indigenous guerrillas or by trespassing 
saboteurs is not known. It is possible that these deeds were successful 
sabotage operations staged from outside and not the work of local in-
habitants. Nevertheless, they helped to reenforce a mood in which the 
Canton population is habituated to hearing of such gestures and also to 
avoiding involvement. Even a senseless railroad station bombing, although 
it provides no gain in prestige for the perpetrator, contributes to 
erosion of the regime's prestige by emphasizing the desirability of 
noninvolvement as an individual goal. 
There are too few reports from the restive Tung Chiang region east 
of Canton to establish any pattern of resistance there. However, several 
unconfirmed reports from Hai-feng and Lu-feng suggest a low state of 
popular and cadre morale. This is consistent with conclusions suggested 
by Four Clearances campaign reports that there was occasional trouble in 
Hai-feng and Lu-feng. Two soldiers were reported killed in April in a 
gunfight with two defecting cadres, while 10 out of 12 fishing boats 
with 120 Shan-wei villagers aboard failed in an attempted escape to Hong 
Kong. 
Reports from elsewhere in Kwangtung are more vague and less credible. 
It cannot be verified, for example, that there were 500 anti-Communist 
guerrillas established in Lo-ting and Hsin-i counties of western Kwangtung 
in spring 1965. A few reports of petty thievery and quasi-banditry 
suggest that a little local roguery has begun to reappear and, speculatively, 
that the militia in some remote areas may be unreliable. 
No overt dissident activities were reported from KWangsi in 1965. 
According to a vague 1964 report, a riot of troops (militia?) in Tung-nan 
Shan (exact location not known) was followed by extra precautions for the 
security of troops stationed there. The possibility is that PLA troops 
encountered resistance in suppressing wayward militia. The only reported 
overtly dissident events in Yunnan are easily attributable to agents from 
outside. Nothing meriting reprisal or swift suppression apparently 
occurred in Yunnan in 1965. The same can be said of Kweichow and of 
Szechwan, outside of its Tibetan areas, as far as is now known.

B. Illegal Activities  
Petty crime continues and may be organized. Travelers continue 
to lose their papers and ration tickets at about the same rate as in 
earlier years. The regularity with which this happens raises the possi-
bility that escapees from labor reform camps, vagrants, disfranchised 
persons, and others on the social fringe are able to secure redocumen-
tation through underworld sources and that there is a well-entrenched 
market in ration coupons. Reports of peddling of documentation have 
been received. 
Corruption exists, especially among cadres, and no doubt the regime 
chooses to call any collusive activity between cadres and populace 
"corruption." Four Clearances campaign disclosures led to large-scale 
prosecutions of cadres and numerous suicides. Tan-suil about 30 kilo-
meters south of Hui-yang and only 40 kilometers from the New Territories, 
was hit hard, as was Mei Hsien. In Hai-feng and Lu-feng some 40 percent 
of the cadres were reportedly purged in late 1964. In the wake of the 
Four Clearances, most punitive assessments on cadres were for sums in 
the hundreds of dollars, which they conceivably can work off in time. 
At the bottom of the scale, very small sums were involved. Bribery at 
the 5-yuan (about $2.00) level to achieve cadre collusion in helping 
inmates escape from a forced-labor mining camp was reported in Hua Hsien. 
Such a sum -- about 2 weekst pay for an inmate -- was hard to secure 
either in money or goods, because inmates were paid only in scrip. 
Two unverified reports of illegal political activity have come from 
Canton. In September 1965 a small "counter-revolutionary" organization 
of students called the Youth-Save-the-Country Party, was uncovered in 
the literature department of Chung-shan University. The ringleader 
received a 15-year sentence, and his associates 5-to-10-year sentences. 
The lightness of these sentences suggests that, if the report is true 
and the ring actually existed, something is still unexplained. Another 
group, the anti-Communist "Dragon Republic of China," reportedly saw its 
founder executed on 27 November 1965 after the organization had accom-
plished "sabotage" in various places. The founder began his organization 
during 1962 while a foreign language student at Sun-Yat-sen University, 
recruiting other youths as fellow "dragons." In late 1965 he himself 
supposedly had participated in a dynamiting of a Canton "shipyard and 
steel mill." Some 85 of his associates had been picked up in southeast 
China and incarcerated for long terms. The significant common denom-
inator in these two reports is the attribution of anti-regime organiza-
tional activity to students and ex-students. Only students, probably, 
would attempt such organization at present. If the accounts are true, 
a social atmosphere of unconcern and noninvolvement must have existed 
at the outset.

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
An example of illegal peasant activity comes from Chung-shan Hsien. 
Here villagers who had been deprived of their private plots of land in 
September 1965 tried later to open up new private plots secretly in 
remote areas, only to have the new plots discovered and confiscated. 
The small private plot, by its periodic elimination and almost predictable 
reappearance, is almost a sort of indicator of the state of local morale. 
In southern China the Communists have handled the right to have a private 
plot as a concession. Ironically, in Shensi in North China an old sec-
retary once stated that "we have never given up the principle of having 
private plots" and that they kept cadre plots besides. 
Provinces other than Kwangtung provide little information of similar 
interest. However, a Kweiyang (Kweichow Province) report stated that, 
as of mid-1963, about 35 percent of Kweiyang's farmers had not joined 
communes, though they gave part of their crops to the communes. They 
were considered backward and were thought to be handling illegal business. 
This is somewhat indicative of the state of socialism in rural areas 
that are off the beaten path. 
Finally, an example of the thoroughness of Four Clearances sifting 
and the apparent pettiness of that campaign comes from a county-owned 
small collective farm in Chung-shan Hsien, perhaps a fairly average 
local situation, in which 13 percent of those investigated were punished. 
Of 83 persons on the farm, 9 were punished under the "Five Investigations" 
of personal backgrounds which ran from April through September. Two of 
the nine cases were serious -- one had an "unclear background" and one 
was a "reactionary thinker." In the FOUT Clearances investigation that 
followed, two cadres were punished and were sent to labor reform camps. 
Then the farm workers were at last ready to get busy on preparations for 
the "Third Five-Year Plan." 
C. Protests and EVasive Activity 
Protest in Kwangtung took the form of evasiveness and of escape 
from the province. Suicides and threats of suicide appeared, not only 
among cadres, but also among family members of youthful conscriptees. 
Suicide, though a terminal form of protest, gets publicity and clearly 
shames the person whose deed caused it. Conscription and militia man-
agement were the main points of friction in inland areas, and around the 
coastal cities youthful discontent over labor assignments to distant 
farms, villages, and construction sites was prevalent. Stubbornness and 
evasiveness in the teeth of the Four Clearances campaign were reported 
from at least two places. In Lu-feng in late 1965 the "class struggle" 
reportedly became "tense and complicated," thus implying that outside 
cadres in their cross-country sweep had not found confessions and denun-
ciations readily forthcoming. In Huai-chi Hsien of western Kwangtung, 
also, there was Four Clearances difficulty with stubborn local cadres. 
The press later revealed that preferential work-point (credits in lieu

of remuneration) distribution to dependents, disabled veterans, and other 
military-related elements of the population had been a problem and that 
the regime had partially relented to permit adjudication of the inequities 
case by case. 
Early in 1965 there was already such apprehension over intensified 
conscription for military and labor needs that mail correspondents in 
the Canton area falsely prophesied another mass exodus to Hong Kong. 
Youthful discontent was especially prevalent in the Tung Chiang area 
between Canton and Hui-yang, where besides the many youth who wished to 
leave China, many thousands (reportedly 600,000!), including cadres; 
were in various stages of disillusionment. This was also reported from 
Hsin-hui Hsien (near Kongmoon), where the authorities were hunting the 
unregistered residents who were nonnatives and were actively conscripting 
youth for labor assignments, thus causing them to seek escape to Hong 
Kong and Macao. 
Evasion of militia responsibility was apparently still easy in Yunnan, 
but getting harder. In May about 800 out of 2,000 Ching-p'o (Kachin) 
inductees deserted in Ying-chiang Hsien. At the end of the year it was 
announced that the Kunming Military Command had organized selected cadres 
and soldiers into 27 teams to circulate in various minority areas to sell 
the "people's war" concept and to establish militia organizations and 
training arrangements. Other press items also put a finger on 'basic 
-
level militia cadres" and identified remaining problems as those of 
"ideological consciousness" and "feudal superstitious activities." Vil-
lagers in one western county had the courage in early 1965 to protest 
certain unjust labor reform sentences and shout down unfounded accusations. 
Press reports from Kwangsi attest to militia sluggishness there; 
also, and report at least one commune party branch, in YU-lin, that got 
busy and reformed itself. Comparable information from Kweichow and 
Szechwan is not sufficient to characterize the local situations there. 
IV. Bases of Dissidence 
A. Popular Dissidence 
1. Minorities 
The dissidence potential among minorities (other than the 
Tibetans, who are not considered here) in southern China is greatly 
outweighed by that of ethnic Chinese. Chinese Muslims are a submerged 
group, and although the Chuang of KWangsi are numerous, they are not 
important as a minority group. The Chinese Communists have an added 
advantage in imposing security measures on the local non-Chinese minor-
ities in that they can often offer genuine improvements in the quality 
of village life. They are skillful in using public health and education

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
measures, control of jobs and advancement, administration of supplemental 
rations, and postponement of unpopular socialization measures to keep 
tribal communities politically divided and to alienate the young. 
No reports were received in 1965 of trouble in the once-dissident 
Yao areas of northern Kwangtung. The Li and Miao on Hainan, with their 
record of support to the Communist-led island resistance during World 
War II, probably are as sensitive to the grievances of their old Communist 
leaders as they are to specific minority problems. There remains, however, 
the possibility of some friction with ethnic Chinese newcomers to the 
island. In Yunnan the Yi and the Ching-pio are probably the most restless 
of the large non-Chinese groups. The Yi tend to resist Communist intru-
sion into their highly inbred, traditional way of life. Perhaps the 
political sequestration of 48,900 Yi in the new Nan-chien Yi Autonomous 
Hsien in November 1965 is indirect evidence that the CCP has taken another 
decisive step in the direction of more effective control over them. The 
Ching-p'o, conscious of their affinities with the Kachins of Burma, 
react against hindrances to free movement. Elsewhere small groups such 
as the Wa, who were once hard to manage, seem to be coming under pac-
ification. The local Tai in the extreme south are not, and never have 
been, troublesome except in regard to their Buddhism, which they are 
permitted to retain. 
2. Youth 
About 30,000,000 young people, men and women in the 15-24 
age range, live in the five provinces. Mao Tse-tung's blanket indictment 
of youth as a problem group "with strong revisionist tendencies" suggests 
that some of their particular subgroups in southern China should be 
examined briefly. 
a. Students and Ex-students 
Students in midcourse have in recent years experienced 
much interruption of studies by labor assignments or by grueling field 
assignments as Four Clearances task forces. Even after graduation, many 
have found that they could not be used in their fields of specialization, 
and they have been sent down to the countryside to work at inferior 
occupations. The 7,000 college graduates in Kwangtung in 1965 were all 
sent to the countryside to work. In recent years, concurrently with 
steady elimination of unneeded city jobs, efforts have been made to weed 
out in advance more of those for whom there will be no job after graduation. 
This, however, does not remove the shock of elimination. The weedouts, 
called "social and intellectual" youth, are those who have failed to pass 
examinations, matriculate for higher schools, or find employment and 
have fast become a growing fringe group of alienated youth in the cities 
where they live or to which they have drifted. 
- 12 -

Approved For Release 2000/05/12 : CIA-RDP79T01018A000900100001-4 
The process of removal of student weedouts from the cities is nec-
essarily slow. To move them out permanently the regime has to ship them 
far away. Before it can do this the authorities must bring them as 
individuals to the point of readiness to enlist for labor and then screen 
them for reliability. Otherwiselmany find a way to return from ordinary 
conscript labor assignments close at hand. Youth have been sent from 
Canton and Swatow as far as Sinkiang and Hainan and from Szechwan to 
state farms in southern Yunnan. On the state farms they have little to 
anticipate except endless menial work. 
In practice, these youth who do not graduate and thereby fail to 
qualify to receive the select professional assignments will in the future 
become part of a subintelligentsia that the regime now flatters in its 
propaganda but actually views only as the means for proletarianizing the 
countryside. This group has provided the youthful defectors who have 
reached the Free World. Their potential for protest in the cities is 
not great, but in the state-farm network it is conceivable that they 
might have a potential for organization. 
b. Youth of Poor Class Backgrounds  
The most unfortunate of China's unemployed and unusable 
youth are those whose "class background" condemns them permanently to 
inferior status. Even those who willingly turn on their own families 
may find that this unnatural deed does not gain them full Party acceptance. 
A relatively large proportion of such youth live in the coastal areas of 
southern China, where past KNT affiliations of family members, as well as 
suspect Overseas Chinese connections, tend to frustrate their careers in 
the eyes of the CCP. Theirs is a formidable plight, and this group has 
readymade objectives to justify possible future dissidence. 
c. Overseas Youth 
The regime has had only qualified success with Overseas 
Chinese youth who have returned to China for education and careers. They 
are often highly disappointed in what they encounter, frequently resist 
work or study assignments, claim special privileges and rights, and "seek 
the main chance" -- even to the point of escape. Southern China has 
received its share of these youth; some have families in southern China. 
Wherever they go they are a leavening element, and as a highly mobile 
group destined to be mostly rootless, they merit close watching. 
d. Peasant Youth 
The origins of country youth who seek industrial employ-
ment have never been studied. Some rural communities probably send few 
youth to the cities, but other villages have for generations seen their 
youth go to the cities. With this avenue now closing to them, rural

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
youth have fewer opportunities, despite their having the same aspirations 
as city youth. The lackluster China Youth League (CYL), now refurbished 
under strong regime pressure, provides the means for youth work, cadre 
training, and selection of Party membership candidates; but the CYL 
recruitment task is an uphill one because of the joylessness of its 
Party mission. For such youth, if they avoid military service, militia 
service has some attractive privileges. The long-term prospect for 
peasant youth is one of increasing exposure to the same influences and 
pressures that motivate city youth, with the likelihood that their so-
phistication will increase to the point that political dissidence may 
finally become possible for them. 
3. Overseas Chinese and Their Connections 
The largest number of Overseas Chinese originated in a 
relatively few counties in the Pearl River Delta and surrounding Swatow 
(and the Fukien ports), while lesser numbers came from much broader 
areas of Kwangsi and Kwangtung, including Hainan. Yunnanese have emi-
grated in sizable numbers only to Burma. 
Through the Overseas Chinese communities, including that of Hong Kong, 
a large proportion of the population of Kwangtung retains a special 
awareness of the outside world and is partially dependent on it as well. 
One village, noted at random) had 70 percent of its population dependent 
on overseas remittances in some degree. This' supplemental source of 
income and information perpetuates tensions between the regime and the 
people, because they are exploitable for foreign exchange and at the same 
time are vulnerable to questioning of their "class status." This popu-
lation of returnees and their relatives is unique in China for having an 
independent basis by which to discount regime propaganda (such as war-
scare talk) and also for having dissidence asets such as a high degree 
of resourcefulness to pursue their own ends. Their situations vary from 
those of managers, cadres, and working peasants to those of political 
undesirables (labeled as landlords, rightists, counter-revolutionaries, 
rich peasants, and common criminals), unnecessary city residents, un-
authorized returnees from country assignments, intended refugees, mate-
rialistic city dwellers, and unregistered elements of the population. 
The people of the coastal regions seem to share a growing sentiment 
of individual detachment from CCP goals while masking it by an increasing 
sophistication in making motions of conformity. In the future this trend 
will provide an increasingly suitable environment for slow nurture of 
forms of political dissidence that may in time secure from the local 
authorities the privilege of partially tolerated existence. 
One important subgroup of the Overseas Chinese includes the 100,000 
returnees from Indonesia, some 70,000 of whom were relocated on state 
farms which were established for them in the southern provinces. Many

of these were poor people who apparently had no ancestral villages to 
receive them. They probably have a dissidence potential, even if they 
have not yet achieved the level of anti-Communist organization which one 
optimistic report suggests. 
B. Intraparty Dissidence  
At the national level there are various indications that morale 
within the CCP is soft in spots. One symptom has been the regime's 
readiness to push the unfinished SEM to almost any length and at almost 
any cost in political fatigue and perpetuation of economic stagnation. 
Another recent symptom has been excessive reliance on Mao as the un-
answerable symbol of consensus, which may conceal impending exhaustion 
of the Party's own ideological ability to persuade. There is also in-
direct evidence that all is not well between the Party and the PLA. 
Against this national backdrop, the southern provincial parties, and 
especially the exposed Kwangtung party, retain their own historical 
problems. 
The Kwangtung Provincial CCP faces a resourceful population with 
shallow loyalties to the regime. It harbors remnants of an older party 
machine whose chief failure was unwillingness to admit that local inter-
ests are always secondary. Its cadres are inclined to come to terms 
with local interests. As a Canton editorial said in 1963: "... many 
rural cadres now tend to sympathize with those under their supervision 
and no longer unquestioningly accept orders from higher authority." 
Its cadres have endured the interminable and merciless SEM campaigns of 
1963-65 with many casualties from their ranks. A secret reregistration 
of Party members as part of a weeding-out process aimed at followers of 
former leaders was reported from Canton in early 1964. There seems to 
have been little Party progress since 1963 except at great cost, and the 
possibility for persistence of significant intraparty dissidence seems 
real. If it were to lead to growth of common cause between remnants of 
the old party and embattled cadres of the new party, the basis of a 
conservative, traditionalist, and ideologically tolerant intraparty 
movement could conceivably materialize. 
The accompanying map entitled Rural Kwangtung: Responsiveness to 
CCP Provincial Committee, April 1963 providesindication of the 
relative strength of the local Kwangtung CCP in 1963 against local 
inertia at the outset of the SEM. It depicts the results of a single 
inquiry into local response to a new project of the provincial Central 
Committee -- the "rural edition" of the Nan-fang Jih-pao. The case 
study was published for the guidance of local cadres, showing where 
cadres had taken prompt action to make the paper generally available 
and where they had been dilatory. It appears to have been a reasonable 
test of relative cadre responsiveness before application of followup 
pressures. Therefore, it may be considered a measure of the degree to

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
which the provincial committee writ was being heeded or ignored in 
early 1963 when the SEM was being launched. 
Results of the survey suggest two types of local situations. In 
some places blue-ribbon cadre forces held firm control on behalf of 
provincial authorities. In others presumably second-string cadre forces 
were either left to their own devices or else conservative party elements 
may have been in the saddle. Spotted within the areas most sluggish to 
respond, some key points performed well, as though the Party had con-
centrated good leadership resources there. Examination of the data 
suggests that they may have been "corrected" or "reestimated" before 
publication, but without necessarily altering the general impression 
presented. 
Part of the background of the unimpressive Party position in 1963 
is found in the Party history. Ironically those areas of eastern Kwangtung 
and Hainan where the potential for intraparty dissidence now seems 
relatively high are places where Chinese Communist activity had its 
beginnings 40 and more years ago. By now the local population may in-
clude many second and third generation Communists, with perhaps even a 
few of the fourth generation to support the greybeards. It was during 
1958 that the older generation of cadres endured a purge similar to that 
which the present generation endured in 1964 and 1965. During 1958 the 
provincial committee achieved a fully national orientation by finally 
turning away from its aging local heroes of the 1920's, 1930's, and 1940's. 
The scars of this overhaul still remain to aggravate present difficulties. 
In May 1958 two old Party chieftains were removed from the Kwangtung 
CCP Central Committee. This signaled the end of an era for so-called 
parochialist local party machines in some places, especially on Hainan 
and in Ho-piu and Shao-kuan Hsiens. It probably extended also to the 
entire eastern Kwangtung triangle between Canton, Shao-kuan, and Swatow. 
Ku Ta-ts'un? formerly the boss of eastern Kwangtung, was removed from 
the central committee though he still lingers on as a powerless deputy 
governor. Feng Pai-chli? the old baron of Hainan, was also dropped from 
the central committee and in 1963 was removed from the province altogether 
and given a vice-governorship in Chekiang. The amount of residual bitter-
ness is not known, but Some low-ranking Hainan cadres were still rebelliously 
disgruntled in 1962. It would be surprising if the old Communists of 
Hainan and the eastern Kwangtung cohorts were reconciled even yet to the 
elimination of their old leaders from positions of influence. 
C. Regional Review 
In southern China the CCP faces a continuing task of improving 
its controls in distant provinces. Each province has its strong key 
points and areas of weaker control, and with security as with dissidence 
the cities lead and the countryside follows. Away from the vulnerable

coastal areas the inland regions divide simply into those areas, more 
intensely cultivated and more densely populated, where ethnic Chinese 
predominate, and the more sparsely populated and less productive areas 
where non-Chinese minority peoples live intermixed with ethnic Chinese 
settlers. In the minority areas, despite greater indulgence of delays 
in "socialization" and "political reconstruction," the authorities are 
steadily extending their effective reach and the PLA is deeply involved 
in tutelage of the population. In the predominantly Chinese areas the 
CCP does not operate differently from elsewhere. 
Canton and Swatow are the centers of mainland Kwangtung dissidence. 
The important delta counties are under very firm control, possibly because 
this was originally an area of KMT strength where the CCP did not wait on 
ceremony to eliminate conservatism. 
Elsewhere in Kwangtung, and especially in the Tung Chiang region and 
on Hainan, there may remain widespread vestiges of a brand of local Com-
munism more conservative than that of the radical top leadership. The 
scope of the present SEM indirectly suggests that the present generation 
of cadres is probably coming quietly to terms with local interests in 
many places. This trend could only have suited the conservative paro-
chialists and sectionalists of the old Kwangtung party. Along the coasts 
and on Hainan, a population with far-ranging overseas connections and a 
background of KNT affiliation is now subject to indefinite prolongation 
of privation, disagreeable urban evacuation and rural resettlement drives, 
and conscription with discriminatory overtones based on class consider-
ations. Economic stagnation and lack of economic incentives nurture poor 
cadre morale and disgruntlement of old cadres and uninfluential Party 
members; and among the populace such conditions encourage personal de-
featism or self-serving private scheming and attempts to escape. 
Away from the coasts the CCP contends with local stubbornness. The 
border counties probably have special problems which make them hard to 
manage, but enough information is not at hand to permit their description. 
Southwest of Canton between the Kwangsi border and the coast, a report 
of "guerrillas" lying low is typical of dissidence reports that are 
impossible to corroborate. Such a report may be discounted as probably 
meaning that a disaffected population exists in many villages and that 
any resistance organization there has identified most but not all of the 
penetration agents within its ranks. 
Kwangsi is related to Kwangtung geographically and historically but 
is far more remote from outside attention. In 1965 no real difficulties 
were reported from Kwangsi. The newly reattached coastal region of the 
Ch'in-chou Special District is a depressed area with very modest resources; 
but it still has an historic claim to dissidence, since one of its central 
counties, Ho-p'u, was identified as a seat of parochialism in 1958. The 
counties along the Kwangtung border and especially around Wu-chou were a

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
focus of attention in 1965, just as in 1960. This region may be somewhat 
soft because it is a gateway. Elsewhere in Kwangsi, the points of con-
cern in 1965 were distributed virtually at random. 
In Yunnan the efficiency of the provincial government at least and 
possibly its entire security posture was called into question by the 
appointment of a Peiping "hatchet man" to the governorship early in 1965. 
Little amplifying information has appeared since, but press comments 
leave no doubt that the provincial militia was in far from satisfactory 
condition during 1965. . 
The geographical distribution of places of security interest in 1960, 
compared to that of 1965, shows a predominant distribution along the 
axis of the east-west highway in 1960 and a province-wide scattering in 
1965. The inference is that in 1960 the consolidation of CCP local con-
trol was most important along the east-west route, whereas in 1965 CCP 
standards of control had been raised to include the entire province. 
Occasional reports of difficulties among YUnnan's minorities over 
intermarriage with Han Chinese or over recent intrusion of migrants from 
other provinces, such as Hunan, into tribal areas are reminders that 
ethnic conflicts remain. Political tools, such as development of Party 
"work" within the framework of new "autonomous" units ? however, seem to 
suffice to control the anti-Chinese sentiments that may develop. 
The Chinese in Yunnan probably harbor more dissidence than do the 
non-Chinese, but this is not known to pose any control problem. Some 
reports suggest that levels of well-being in Yunnan are sometimes higher 
than in other provinces. Frictions probably exist between Overseas Chinese 
and local Chinese youth but are not conspicuously important. 
The most substantial information regarding Kweichow in 1965 was the 
unexplained removal in January or February, of Chou Lin, the Party First 
Secretary and Provincial Governor -- a change that was followed by re-
organization of the provincial committee. Later in the year improvement 
of political controls over agriculture was publicized as a serious pro-
blem in the province. Whatever else it meant, the shakeup in Kweichow 
and the April appointment of Chou Hsing to the Yunnan governorship 
strengthened the influence of northerners in the southwestern province. 
In Szechwan the Chinese population is reported indirectly by East 
European sources to be widely disaffected toward the regime because of 
its exploitive grip on the provincial agricultural surplus. While there 
is no information on present dissidence levels, two current construction 
programs may have some effect. The first is relocation of factories to 
Szechwan from eastern locations, introducing more outsiders as well as 
more industry to the Chieng-tu area. The second encompasses the con-
struction needs for this industry and for railroad construction on the

Yunnan line. Most reporting from Szechwan deals with its Tibetan fringes 
and is similar to reporting of other years -- minor administrative pro-
blems, the woes of travelers, and robbery. 
V. Conclusions and Prospects  
A. The Downward Slide ofResistance Potential  
Dissidence in southern China is not declining but increasingly 
translates into apathy and resignation, with attendant individual eva-
siveness. There is no known indigenous resistance movement now active. 
More information probably will be available later in the year, but as of 
March 1966 the incidence of overt acts of protest seems to be declining, 
despite the fact that preexisting levels of dissidence were apparently 
maintained during 1965. 
There is no effective anti-Communist leadership in any part of the 
study area. Popular apathy and resignation rule out both enthusiastic 
support of regime programs and energetic dissent from regime programs. 
As this mood sinks deeper, overt protest is slight but can take such 
drastic traditional form as suicide. 
Both rural and urban inhabitants have learned to avoid translation 
of economic dissatisfactions into political dissidence and can endure a 
high degree of deprivation so long as distribution is reasonably equitable 
without a break in morale. Minorities are mostly uninvolved in active 
dissidence. Within the study area the coastal regions of Kwangtung, 
including Hainan, have the largest potentially dissident population. 
Along the coast there is a greater awareness of the outside world because 
of the pattern of Overseas Chinese relationships beginning at Hong Kong 
and Macao and extending throughout the world. 
Despite the apparent strength of its control system, the regime is 
devoting an increasingly disproportionate amount of effort to "class 
warfare" and ideological campaigns. If this is a necessity merely to 
maintain existing levels of internal security, it is an unhealthy sign 
Dor the regime. As an attritive factor, however, it is balanced by the 
corresponding dissipation of potentially dissident leadership, especially 
among the youth and disaffected cadres. 
B. Conditions Inhibiting Active Dissidence 
In the last analysis, the ability of the regime to contain dis-
sidence rests on its ability to maintain pressure on the people. This 
awesomely sophisticated ability of the Chinese Communist regime is still 
unchallenged. It inhibits any formulation of dissident objectives by 
disaffected elements.

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
The use of large task forces of students, other youths, and outside 
cadres to carry out the Four Clearances campaign illustrates the ease 
with which the citizenry of Communist China can be manipulated. The 
task force members -- themselves either under training or under an 
ideological cloud of some sort and knowing it is in their own interest 
to do a good job -- have had no reason to make common cause with any 
stubborn local leaders whom they might encounter. The local people, for 
their part, reportedly often have taken out their resentments with gusto 
on the local cadres under Four Clearances encouragement. One side was 
played off against the other without any hint of mutual dismay being 
reported. 
The current economic stagnation also seems to be, on balance, a 
factor inhibiting dissidence. The regime manipulates even slight rewards, 
such as preferential cloth rationing, more effectively than any potential 
dissidents can exploit the lack of a satisfactory cloth ration. Food 
shortages, also, seem to have been accepted as facts of life so long as 
a measure of equity prevails in distribution. The most keenly felt 
irritants are those that involve inequities or discriminatory treatment. 
Insofar as the Four Clearances campaign has attached inequities and 
punished those to blame, it probably has entrenched the regime still 
further with the peasantry. 
It is probable that in the past the percentage of population in 
Kwangtung living under punitive detention has been large. In 1962, 
Hui-yang Hsien had a reported Public Security Bureau prison capacity of 
about 100,000 for a hsien population of possibly 1,500,000. In addition 
to such facilities, which presumably existed in every hsien, some pro-
vincial labor-reform camps such as that at the Lo Chia Tu mines had a 
population of almost 50,000. Without a separate study of labor-reform 
camps and local prisons, it can only be estimated that 5 to 10 percent 
of the provincial population may still be living under some form of 
detention. 
C. Conditions Contributing to Active Dissidence 
Location close to the coast or to a large city is perhaps the 
most important single factor favoring effective dissidence in southern 
China. In such locations the regime must keep dissidence at a lower level 
than in more remote places. For a dissident in such areas, even though 
living under tight restraint, it is an asset to be part of the world of 
the Overseas Chinese. He is conscious of and occasionally shares some 
of the expectations, earnings, experience, and resourcefulness of the 
Overseas Chinese. The proximity of Hong Kong and Macao is also an in-
fluence. Individuals with overseas connections are more likely to be 
capable of formulating practical short-run plans with materialistic 
objectives and of attaining some of them. At the very least, such indi-
vidualistic activity -- which seems to go on now, ramifying along the

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
transportation routes away from the coast and the big cities -- contributes 
to a spreading climate of unconcern for the activity of other people. At 
most, it could become part of a slowly rising tide of "individualism" and 
so increase existing strains throughout the control structure that could 
lead to a loosening of the Chinese Communist system and to the building 
of a base for future tolerance of dissent, student political activity, 
and other currently prohibited practices. 
The effective potential for active dissidence and resistance in inland 
areas (except perhaps in the Tibetan area of Szechwan, not considered here) 
is slight. Levels of dissidence tolerable to the regime may be quite high, 
physical control by the regime is virtually complete, and peasant objectives 
are usually limited. Further, peasant hostility to the regime may rise 
and fall -- depending on fluctuating degrees of deprivation and on changing 
pressures for labor levies, grain deliveries, and other forms of sacrifice 
-- without implying that the peasants would necessarily tolerate anti-
regime activity. This is especially true if the peasants are protected, 
as they now are, from neoptism and brigandage. However, even in remote 
areas any local climate of dissatisfaction and incipient hostility will 
nourish a growing weight of youthful aspiration and career expectations. 
The regime's determination to reduce city populations through permanent 
distribution of surplus individuals throughout the countryside will only 
aggravate this trend. 
In the rural areas there has been no more prolific source of dis-
satisfaction than the preferential allotment of work points to cadres or 
to other favored persons and families. Work points have a variable local 
value, depending on the harvest. They are a sort of phantom currency 
that farmers, workers, and cadres use to build up balances against which 
to draw for necessities. Unlike money or scrip, work points are not a 
private medium of exchange. All arrangements and transactions are 
recorded and hence must be justifiable. People who deserve than, or 
think they deserve them, frequently are awarded modest work-point bonuses. 
Though exceptional arrangements are often reasonable, the system is readily 
abused. It has encouraged indefensible cadre-peasant collaboration to 
bypass onerous regulations and has brought on some of the corruption that 
the Four-Clearances campaign exposed. If the new PLMP associations work 
effectively, the means of righting work-point inequities will be available 
to some of the peasants. As other forms of discrimination in favor of 
selected groups of peasants are being encouraged under the scrutiny of 
the PLMPA's, however, similar inequities are destined to continue. 
Undesirable work assignments are another source of dissatisfaction. 
Even Party members resist unwanted transfers, thus further burdening the 
honest, hard-working administrative cadres whose disaffection would be a 
genuine loss to the regime. The amount of dissatisfaction with, and 
evasion of, mass labor assignments is unclear, but there is reason to 
believe that much effort goes into keeping such dissatisfaction under 
control.

C-0-N-F-I-D-E-N-T-I-A-L 
Finally, conscription for the PLA and for militia service has been 
far from popular and is even less so now under the cloud of popular 
apprehension aroused by recent war propaganda. 
D. Prospects for Future Dissidence  
The possibilities for widespread development of popular resistance 
are remote at present. The populace is tightly controlled in the densely 
populated areas. In the rural and hinterland areas, public security 
divisions and militia forces augment the PLA in physically controlling 
the territory of southern China so that resistance groups have no safe 
sanctuary. The most likely cause of dissidence that could lead to popular 
resistance, under changed circumstances, would be the force of sheer 
hunger or other types of suffering. Effective armed resistance, however, 
would require leadership of the sort that could only come from labor 
reform camps, from the military or civil cadre force, or from the ranks 
of ex-servicemen. 
In the inland areas dissidence is likely to continue to be rationalized 
into resignation and apathy. Along the coasts, where tangible objectives 
for dissidence are easier to formulate, it could erupt into protest, which 
in turn could lead to political action. China's next revolution is likely 
to be a revolution in expectations (following the pattern of the rest of 
the world). Under any conditions that might loosen the security and 
control system, such as an increase in material well-being, sentiments 
typical of a consumer economy could easily start among the more sophis-
ticated populations of Canton, Swatow, and other southern cities and 
spread swiftly to other major cities of China long before it had pene-
trated the countryside. The effect on the cadre force would probably be 
such as to require more tolerance of dissent than the regime presently 
anticipates, with correspondingly drastic consequences for its system of 
thought control. 
Intraparty dissidence, unlike popular dissidence, is likely to grow 
out of the very principles of personal responsibility that the regime 
earnestly inculcates into its cadres. On the national scene intraparty 
resistance to the radicals who have been in command since 1955 could 
conceivably crystallize under impact of unanticipated events. In the 
special situation of southern China and especially Kwangtung, Party 
stalwarts know that the old "parochialist" element spoke for legitimate 
local interests. They see southern influence as weak in the national 
CCP, and they know the limitations on their own career prospects. However, 
they may not yet be conscious of the degree to which the southern regions 
have been slighted through the self-defeating biases of the regime in 
economic planning. They may not yet realize the degree to which the 
southern provinces are seemingly destined to fall still further behind 
the rest of the world in economic construction as time wears on. Needless 
to say, this process of disillusionment has some time yet to run its 
course and some distance to go before political consequences will be 
visible.
