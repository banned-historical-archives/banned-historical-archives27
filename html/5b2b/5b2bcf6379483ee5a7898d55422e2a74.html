 National Intelligence Daily Cable for Thursday, July 1,  1976.
 e NIV Cable is for the purpose o informing
 senior US officials.
 Syria appears to be trying to salvage Libyan Prime
 Minister  allud's mediation mission in Lebanon, and is giving
 the appearance of greater acquiescence in the Arab League's
 desire for a joint security force there. Damascus has stepped
 up its military offensive, however, and its conciliatory ges-
 tures seem to be only a tactical move to head off pressure by
 the Arab League foreign ministers for a dilution of its mili-
 tary role.
 I     I The league ministers, in an emergency session in
 Cairo last night, passed a resolution calling for a cease-fire
 in Beirut to take effect today at 5 a.m. Washington time. They
 also created a special committee, consisting of the league's
 secretary general and the foreign ministers of Bahrain and
 Tunis, to monitor the cease-fire and to draw up a timetable
 for implementing earlier league resolutions on Lebanon.
 During the past several weeks Damascus has played
 along with both Jallud and the League mission in an effort to
 buy time and to forestall further Arab political pressure. Both

 missions have provided a facade behind which Syria has minimized
 its continued involvement in the fighting and consolidated its
 military positions.
 In fact, Syria now appears to be pressing its mili-
 tary a vantage, and acting more openly in conjunction with the
 Christian forces. While the Syrians may temporarily succeed in
 mollifying some of their critics, the other Arabs will not be
 misled for long. Libyan President Qadhafi, for instance, is
 increasingly impatient and may order Jallud to cease his tacit
 cooperation with Damascus.

 In Beirut, heavy fighting continued yesterday along
 the traditional confrontation lines in the central portion of
 the city, the port area, and the vicinity of the airport.  Resi-
 dential areas in west Beirut were again bombarded as the ex-
 change of artillery fire between the eastern and western sec-
 tors gradually escalated. The US embassy reports that shortages
 of food and water are becoming serious in many areas of the
 capital.
 We cannot confirm Palestinian charges yesterday that
 Syrian forces have joined the Christian offensive in Beirut.
 I     I The major West European communist leaders at the
 European communist party conference reasserted their independ-
 ence from Moscow in no-nonsense terms, and implied that Soviet-
 style communism is ineffective and no longer a viable model for
 Western parties.
 I    I  Italy's Berlinguer said the development of Marxism
 a  no    ept pace with world realities. This theme was repeated
 by Spanish party leader Carrillo, who referred to the scientific
 approach to socialism as a "kind of mysticism and predestina-
 tion," which the movement had outgrown.
 .In the course of ritual praise for the Soviet revolu-
 tion o                       917, Berlinguer noted that it had taken place in par-
 ticular historical conditions and was marked by "hardships,
 difficulties, and errors."
 Berlinguer restated his party's intention to follow
 an autonomous line free of foreign interference and "within the
 framework" of Italy's alliances--a reference to the party's ac-
 ceptance of Italian membership in NATO and the EC.
 Berlinguer went on to assert that there could be no
 single leading communist party or state.  He said that the con-
 ference was not a meeting of an international communist body
 because "no such body exists and can never exist," either on a
 European or world level.

 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia. This reference was made to
 illustrate his point that the principle of non-interference in
 other parties'  affairs does not rule out the right to assess
 their theoretical and political stands.
 He also recalled the Italian party's criticism of the
 to    e general concern about the "image of socialism"; he
 claimed it served "common ideals" when the French express views
 on the divergence of a communist country from these ideals.
 This was an obvious effort to Justify the French communist
 criticism earlier this year of Soviet treatment of political
 dissidents.
 French party leader Marchais likewise made reference
 line that had helped to prolong the preparatory efforts for
 the conference. As far as the French were concerned, he said,
 such meetings no longer serve a useful purpose. To emphasize
 the French party's adoption of a more independent stance, Mar-
 chais reminded the audience that his party had recently dis-
 carded the concept of the "dictatorship of the proletariat."
 In his statement, Marchais maintained much the same
 strong Ty criticizing French President Giscard, Marchais came
 down hard on those communist parties in power which--in the
 name of peaceful coexistence--cooperate with Western govern-
 ments to the detriment of the local party.
 After interpreting the "crisis in capitalism" and
 strongly worded speech delivered at the conference, underscored
 his party's independence from Moscow.  He demanded that diver-
 sity be accepted, and gave a thinly veiled warning that failure
 to do so would result in a schism.  Presumably with an eye toward
 his party's efforts to win legalization, Carrillo asserted that
 full democracy is essential for all "socialist states" and ob-
 served that socialism in Western countries would be brought
 about by pluralism.
 Spanish Communist leader Carrillo,  in the most

 their troops from other countries to hasten the dissolution of
 power blocs.  Carrillo may have hoped to lend credence to his
 statement last year in which he said that the Spanish Commu-
 nists would not object to the US military presence in Spain as
 long as Soviet troops occupied Czechoslovakia.

 Among the speeches of the East European party leaders,

 Tito clearly aimed his message at Moscow by hammering
 d n    e necessity of different roads to socialism. He stressed
 that Yugoslavia opposes any form of interference in the inter-

 Ceausescu also called for effective safeguards against inter-
 ference in Romania's internal affairs.  He also advocated the
 simultaneous dissolution of military blocs as a means of elimi-
 nating suspicion. Like Tito, Ceausescu declared that the in-
 evitable differences among parties--read,  among others,  the
 Soviets and Chinese--should be solved in a "principled spirit"
 in private bilateral meetings.

 Polish party chief Gierek took a cautious stance in

 industrial city.
 Not surprisingly, Bulgarian leader Zhivkov gave a
 strong, pro-Soviet speech, declaring that a party's attitude
 toward the USSR and the Soviet party is the "most reliable
 criterion of loyalty" to communism. He condemned anti-Sovietism
 and Maoism, stressing that inevitable differences between par-
 ties should be resolved in a spirit of "proletarian interna-
 tionalism," thereby asserting that the Soviet party is the
 first among equals.

 For the first time in five years, Peking marked the
 anniversary today of the Communist Party with an editorial pub-
 lished in all of China's major publications. The high-level
 treatment contrasted with the generally low-key content of the
 editorial.
 The editorial broke no new ground on the political
 campaign criticizing former vice premier Teng Hsiao-ping,  and
 this suggests that the campaign is at a standstill. There was a
 call to continue the criticism of Teng, and others like him in
 the party, but it was balanced by a statement that most such
 people have corrected their mistakes.

 The editorial concluded on the somewhat defensive
 note that the party is "worthy" of leading the country despite
 the Teng Hsiao-ping affair and the riots in Peking in early
 April. This may reflect the widespread loss of confidence in
 the   art   that  as resulted from the recent political turmoil.
 //The guerrilla war is beginning to erode the

 Prime Minister Ian Smith, and the Rhodesian regular army appar-
 ently has not been seriously affected by morale problems.//
 //Since the attack by insurgents last April on
 mororists on the main highway to South Africa and other inci-

 concerned for the first time about travel in Rhodesia. They
 now generally avoid driving at night on certain major roads
 where guerrilla activity has been reported.//
 A sharp decline in tourism has hurt several industries, par-
 ticularly the Rhodesian airline.//
 //Morale among the reserve forces has reportedly
 declined as reservists are called away from their civilian pur-
 suits more frequently and for longer periods.//

 //French President. Giscard's visit to London last
 week was a step toward establishing the "missing link" in the
 trilateral relationship between Paris, London, and Bonn essen-
 tial to any progress toward European unity.//
 //The most important aspects of the visit were the
 establishment of a personal working relationship between Gis-
 card and Prime Minister Callaghan and the creation of a frame-
 work for periodic high-level bilateral meetings. The two sides
 agreed that the heads of government and the foreign ministers
 will meet annually--and that a number of other ministers will
 meet periodically.//
 //It is unclear whether the visit brought any ad-
 vances on specific Community issues. London believes it made
 some impression on Giscard with arguments that any formula for
 direct elections to the European Parliament must give adequate
 representation to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. An
 agreement on direct elections may be reached at the EC summit
 later this month.//
 //Giscard may have shown some sympathy for British
 insistence on special treatment for the UK in the Community's
 common fishing policy. Some press accounts suggest that Giscard
 may have linked British demands regarding fishing to access by
 other Community members to exports of British North Sea oil.//
 //The visit completes the institutionalization of
 bilateral summit consultations among French, West German, and
 British leaders. The French and British respectively have been
 holding periodic summits with the Germans since the 1960s.
 Chancellor Schmidt saw Callaghan yesterday,  and Giscard goes
 to Hamburg early next week.//
 //Since its inception by de Gaulle and Adenauer,
 t e   aris- onn link has been an important element in postwar
 reconciliation,  facilitating discussions on policies affecting
 the whole of Western Europe and providing a forum for reconcil-
 ing bilateral differences. The British - West German connection
 has not been as close, mainly because of the UK's long exclu-
 sion from the EC and its consequent lesser involvement in Euro-
 pean affairs prior to 1973. Ties between London and Paris had
 been in the doldrums since de Gaulle vetoed the UK's applica-
 tion to join the EC in the 1960s.//

 EC foreign ministers meeting in Luxembourg on Tuesday
 expressed satisfaction with the results of the economic summit
 in Puerto Rico, according to press reports.  They regarded the
 discussion of the general economic situation in the West as par-
 ticularly useful and noted their satisfaction with talks regard-
 ing East-West relations and relations with the developing world.
 A generally favorable evaluation has also emerged from
 press reporting from European capitals. Most commentators say
 the summit provided Western leaders with a good opportunity to
 work out a general strategy for controlling the economic re-
 covery.
 The summit was given heavy play in the Italian press.
 JIne willingness of other participants to express support for
 Italy was noted, as well as the need for Italy to adopt strin-
 gent economic austerity measures within the framework of greater
 political stability.
 West German Chancellor Schmidt's argument that only a
 few developing states would benefit from a common fund for raw
 materials evoked considerable interest in the German press.  Die
 Welt noted that the US and West Germany had arrived at a general
 consensus on this issue, but that a common approach to develop-
 ing countries was left unresolved. Some of the German press has
 been critical of Schmidt's attendance on the grounds that it was
 an electoral maneuver and because the EC was not represented.

 No post-summit press commentary has yet been received
 from the UK or France; nor have we had any reporting on private
 official evaluations and reactions. Comment from Canada has been
 very limited.
 Soviet press coverage has been limited and rather nega-

 setbacks at Nairobi and represents just another effort to save
 Western economies from those dangers inherent in the capitalist
 system. Tass gave a fairly factual presentation of the summit
 results, although it did assert a certain lack of enthusiasm on
 the part of some non-US participants.

 Chilean President Pinochet announced on Tuesday night
 a series of changes in economic: policies intended to win wider
 public support for the junta.
 I             The measures include an 11-percent revaluation of the
 peso. T is revaluation, the first for any South American cur-
 rency in this decade, comes one day after a major devaluation
 in Peru--Chile's traditional Andean rival--and may have been
 deliberately timed for added psychological impact.
 The measures also include tax reductions and expanded
 credit for housing and investment.
 //The new policies signal a major change in the
 military government's priorities, made possible by the dramatic
 improvement in the Chilean balance of payments this year. Pinochet
 may also be reacting to complaints, particularly from the air
 force, that the government's austerity program exacted too much
 sacrifice from the Chilean people.//
 The revaluation will stimulate imports.  It will effec-
 tively reduce prices for imported goods in terms of domestic
 currency and further slow inflation, which has been running at
 an annual rate of 250 percent so far this year--down from 341
 percent in 1975.
 I    I Since it took power in September 1973, the government
 has   eva ued the peso by nearly 50 percent more than the infla-
 tion rate in order to stimulate exports.  In 1975, devaluations--
 coupled with import restrictions--contributed to a 30-percent
 cutback in imports.

 Ugandan President Amin is again making threatening
 gestures toward Kenya.
 In a statement yesterday,  an Ugandan military spokesman
 charged that Kenyan troops crossed into Uganda on Monday,  cap-
 turing several policemen and destroying a police post. The
 spokesman said that Ugandan military forces have been instructed
 to counter any "aggression" from Kenya.

 The Kenyans have denied the charges. //They have
 told US officials privately that dissident tribesmen attacked
 the post.//
 //Amin'-s motives and intentions are obscure, al-
 though he may suspect that Kenya was involved in the recent at-
 tempt on his life. He may want to keep Nairobi on edge and dis-
 suade it from supporting other assassination attempts.//
 //Should Amin approach Siad, he is almost certain
 to be turned down by the Somali. leader. Mogadiscio claims a
 large part of Kenya inhabited by ethnic Somalis, but this area
 is much less important to Somalia// than the French Territory
 of the Afars and Issas, which it hopes to annex when the French
 withdraw.
 //Although a move against Kenya by Amin cannot be
 ruled out, he may be less inclined to take this step without as-
 surances of Somali assistance. The ill-disciplined Ugandan army,
 which has suffered from Amin's maladministration, is poorly pre-
 pared for a foreign adventure.//
 I         I Iran's 15-year-old Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi will make
 an official visit to the USSR early this month. The Shah, who
 went to Moscow in late 1974, uses such visits to demonstrate
 his interest in keeping relations with the Soviets on an even
 keel.

 By sending the Crown Prince this year,  the Shah
 keeps the focus of the visit on protocol, avoids an encounter
 with Soviet leaders,  and retains for himself room to maneuver
 against Soviet policies in the Middle East and South Asia.
 //Iran's long-term distrust of Moscow has been reinforced by
 recent Soviet activities in Africa,  the Persian Gulf, and the
 Indian Ocean.//
 Soviet leaders remain troubled by the growing US-Iranian ties
 and the influx of US arms and advisers into Iran.//
 //In late May, Moscow protested critical speeches
 by Iranian officials and articles in the Iranian press implic-
 itly linking the USSR with terrorism in Iran.
 The
 Shah
 has seldom attacked Moscow directly because
 he recognizes
 the
 need to preserve a workable political rela-
 tionship with
 the
 Soviets as well as the important economic
 links between
 the
 two countries.
 The trip by the Crown Prince is seen by the Shah as a
 further step in broadening the international experience of his
 young heir. The Crown Prince's exposure to world leaders began
 last year when he represented Iran in ceremonies marking the
 reopening of the Suez Canal. He has since been the nominal host
 for visits to Iran by Crown Prince Hasan of Jordan, King Carlos
 of Spain,  and various Persian Gulf sheikhs.
 Diplomats in Moscow are picking up conflicting indi-
 cations of the possibility of a Central Committee plenum this
 Some Soviet sources have said that a plenum will be
 held during the first week of July; others say that one is not
 scheduled for the near future. The rumors follow speculation
 this spring that a plenum would be held last month.

 //The rumors are being fed by Foreign Minister
 Gromyko's recent postponement for "internal reasons" of his of-
 ficial visits to Denmark and Belgium, planned for next week.//
 Other officials reportedly plan to be in Moscow early this
 month, and Western embassies are finding it difficult to sched-
 ule meetings with middle-level officials for the first half of
 this month.
 On the other hand, Premier Kosygin is expected to
 represent the USSR at the annual CEMA heads of government meet-
 ing in East Berlin next week.
 Earlier rumors that leadership changes will be made
 at a plenum continue, but some Soviets deny that a plenum any-
 time soon would take such action.
 Another frequently mentioned topic for plenum discus-
 sion is agriculture.  If a plenum is held,  it also might discuss
 the conference of European communist parties, which ended yes-
 terday and was attended by General Secretary Brezhnev.
 The appointment last Thursday of Aleksey Vatchenko as
 chairman of the presidium of the Ukrainian Supreme Soviet places
 an ally of Ukrainian party chief Shcherbitsky and General Secre-
 tary Brezhnev in this key post. Vatchenko, previously first sec-
 retary in the Dnepropetrovsk region, replaced retiring Ivan
 Grushetsky.
 Vatchenko's promotion gives Shcherbitsky what he pre-
 viously appeared to lack--a loyal supporter in Kiev who is well
 placed to qualify for the top republic post should Shcherbitsky
 transfer to Moscow.
 Because of his close association with Brezhnev,
 Shcherbitsky has long been viewed as a strong contender to suc-
 ceed him or possibly Premier Kosygin, assuming that he could
 get an assignment in Moscow.  It seemed unlikely, however,  that
 he would leave the Ukraine before he had fully secured his
 power base there.
