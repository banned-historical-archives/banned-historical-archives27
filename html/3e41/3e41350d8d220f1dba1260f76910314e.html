 THE MOSCOW TEST-BAN TALKS
 Khrushchev used the occa-
 sion of his 19 July speech at
 a rally for Hungarian leader
 Kadar to state publicly his
 views on the test-ban talks.
 The tone of the speech suggested
 that he expected the tripartite
 talks to reach an early agreement
 on a limited nuclear test ban.
 The Soviet premier seemed to
 treat an agreement virtually as
 an accomplished fact by express-
 ing the hope that it will be
 "useful" in improving the inter-
 national atmosphere.   He also
 claimed that it would demonstrate
 the validity of his policy of
 peaceful coexistence.
 Khrushchev did not indi-
 cate that an agreement banning
 tests in the atmosphere, outer
 space, and under water would to
 conditional on a moratorium
 on underground tests or on a
 NATO - Warsaw Pact nonaggression
 treaty.   He simply stated that
 "we would like to hope" that the
 Moscow talks will produce agree-
 ment on a nonaggression pact and
 hinted at considerable flexi-
 bility on the precise formula
 for such an agreement.   Soviet
 commentators have echoed his
 remark that the main thing about
 a nonaggression pact "is not the
 form but the content."
 Khrushchev's speech re-
 flected his apparent intention
 to use the current talks as a
 point of departure for further
 negotiations on a nonaggression
 pact and other proposals bearing
 on European security.   He re-
 newed previous Soviet proposals
 for reductions in military budg-
 ets                                                            and measures to prevent
 surprise attack.   The only
 variant he suggested would pro-
 vide for stationing Western rep-
 resentatives with Soviet forces
 in East Germany and Soviet rep-
 resentatives with Western forces
 in the Federal Republic.
 Soviet commentators are
 still careful to temper their
 optimistic assessments of the
 prospects for a successful
 conclusion of the talks with
 routine warnings that "in-
 fluential circles" in Washing-
 ton, Bonn, and Paris are work-
 ing against an accord.

 END OF SINO-SOVIET TALKS SIGNALS CONTINUED CONFLICT
 After two weeks of futile
 and probably acrimonious meet-
 ings in Moscow, the Chinese
 Communists have returned home
 clearly determined to carry on
 with the war.  The Russians,
 no less determined, have acted
 quickly to tighten their lines
 in preparation for continued
 conflict.
 heroes' reception accorded the
 returning delegation on 21'
 July.  Mao Tse-tung headed
 the top-level group of govern-
 ment and party leaders which
 turned out at the airport.  The
 welcoming crowd carried banners
 and shouted slogans affirming
 Peiping's position in the quar-
 rel with Moscow.
 The talks ended on 20 July,
 and the curt joint communique-
 issued simultaneously in Moscow
 and Peiping the next day indi-
 cated only that neither side
 is yet ready to accept respon-
 sibility for a formal split in
 the Communist movement.  The
 only agreement recorded was to
 recess the talks until an un-
 specified future date.
 To this end, both sides
 sought to maintain the appear-
 ance of unity despite their
 failure to achieve it.   In a
 minimum courtesy gesture, the
 Soviet party presidium gave a
 farewell dinner for the Chinese
 delegation at which Khrushchev
 made his only publicized con-
 tact with the visitors.  Offi-
 cial Communist accounts of the
 affair declared--in what is
 probably the overstatement of
 the year--that a "friendly at-
 mosphere" prevailed.

 regime was indicated by the
 Even before the Chinese
 had left town the Russians

 CEMA states gathered in Moscow
 on 24 July and the Russians
 probably used the occasion to
 close bloc ranks against the
 Chinese.  These talks may
 well be used to arrange con-
 certed action in the field
 of economic relations with
 Peiping.  Moves to isolate
 the Chinese by downgrading
 the level of diplomatic rep-
 resentation from other Commu-
 nist states may also be dis-
 cussed.  Four of the six am-
 bassadors representing European
 satellite states in Peiping
 were away from their posts
 as of 21 July and their return
 might be delayed indefinitely.
 Moscow's determination to
 stand firm on the issues which
 separate the USSR and Commu-
 nist China has been underscored
 by a number of moves which
 will certainly kindle new rage
 in Peiping.  Among these are
 Khrushchev's decision to visit
 Yugoslavia in August, announced
 on 19 July, and the agreement
 to provide the Yugoslavs with
 technical assistance which was
 publicized the next day. Prog-
 ress on a nuclear test ban
 and indications that Moscow
 is disposed to go ahead with
 negotiations on other Impor-
 tant East-West problems are
 even more obnoxious to the
 Chinese.
 Peiping struck out angrily
 at the test-ban talks on 19
 July in a major editorial
 denouncing US attempts to
 perpetrate a "nuclear fraud"
 designed expressly to prevent
 China from getting atomic
 weapons.  After noting that
 even before the talks began
 the Soviet Union had expressed
 willingness to agree with the
 US, the editorial declared
 the hope, without conviction,
 that the Russians would not
 fall into the American trap.
 Peiping is clearly preparing
 a series of new polemical blasts
 at Moscow.  A statement by a cen-
 tral committee spokesman on 19
 July urged "revolutionary comrades
 throughout the world" to study

 Soviet industrial produc-
 tion continues to expand at
 about the same rate as in recent
 years with problems still ham-
 pering growth.   The mid-year
 plan fulfillment report issued
 by the USSR Central Statistical
 Bureau on 19 July claims an 8.5-
 percent increase in production
 over a year ago--a figure in line
 with the somewhat lower rates
 of growth since 1960.
 Most heavy industrial
 commodities continued their
 trends of the past few years.
 However, crude steel and pig
 iron have been cut back as antic-
 ipated  in the 1963 plan issued
 last December and as already
 evident in the economic report
 for the first quarter of this
 year. The chemical industry
 and industrial support for
 agriculture continue to make
 strong advances.   The over-all
 output in chemicals was up 17
 percent while chemical fertil-
 izer increased 13 percent.
 Tractor production was 17 per-
 cent higher, well ahead of the
 planned rate.  This trend seems
 to fit--at least in  direction--
 with the program outlined by
 Khrushchev last November but
 there are many signs that he is
 still far from satisfied.   In
 April, he castigated Soviet
 planners for dragging their heels
 on reorienting industry in
 favor of chemical production.
 Soon after that the guidelines
 for the 1964-65 plan clearly
 specified top priority for
 chemicals, particularly in sup-
 port of agriculture and the
 consumer goods industry.   A re-
 cent Khrushchev conversation
 with Belgian  Foreign Minister
 Spaak suggests that drastic
 upward revisions of plans for
 the chemical industry are in
 the offing.
 That problems still plague
 the economy and hamper growth
 is most evident from the perform-
 ance in capital investment.
 State-planned investment rose
 only 4 percent compared with al-
 most 10 percent a year ago.
 Organizational and supply diffi-
 culties, shortage of resources
 for the investment projects
 under way, and the severe winter
 probably all contributed to this
 result.   In addition, construc-
 tion was probably slowed by
 Khrushchev's demand in April
 that existing projects be re-
 viewed with the object of clos-
 ing down those of lower priority
 and accelerating others.
 Within the general area of
 investment, the chemical indus-
 try and agriculture continued
 their fairly rapid expansion.
 The 15-percent increase in chem-
 ical investment is only a slight
 improvement over last year's-
 performance, but considering
 the lower rate of increase in
 the total investment program com-
 pared to mid-1962, it is evident
 that the chemical industry's share
 of the total has increased markedly.
 State farm investment--about half
 of total agricultural investment
 and the only share reported on
 at mid-year--rose 12 percent,
 well below the increase last
 year but, one of the largest in-
 creases among those sectors for
 which information is given.
 Once again the Soviet con-
 sumer is faced with a disappoint-
 ing report on his share of the
 economic pie.   Construction of

 state housing--about three
 fourths of all urban housi;ig
 built--actually decreased
 somewhat from a year ago. Re-
 tail trade was below plan, al-
 though the food industry  was
 about on target.  The growth of
 private savings by 6 percent
 attests to the continuing scar-
 city and unacceptably poor
 quality of consumer goods.
 Soviet efforts to establish
 an air-route to Cuba via Africa
 have been temporarily thwarted.
 After making only three weekly
 flights on its newly announced
 Moscow-Conakry-Havana route, the
 USSR was notified by Guinea on
 12 July that such flights were
 to be terminated.   Subsequent
 TU-114 flights to Havana have
 followed the route established
 last January via the North At-
 lantic over international waters.
 Moscow probably will now
 seek an alternate stop-over in
 --notably in Algeria.
 USSR has area y o          land-
 ing rights at Ouargla airfield
 in the northern Sahara in support
 of a route to Cuba and arrange-
 ments allegedly have been made
 with Shell Oil Company for the
 servicing of Soviet TU-114 air-
 craft.
 Last May Soviet technicians
 surveyed three Algerian airfields
 and it probably was determined
 then that Ouargla had adequate
 facilities to accommodate the
 TU-114 once the refueling problem
 was solved.   If the flight from
 As usual, the economic
 report gave no worthwhile clue
 on the direction or extent of
 defense expenditures; there is
 little question, however, that
 the low rate of increase in state-
 planned investment was in part
 caused by the cumulative effect
 of the increasingly heavy mili-
 tary spending of the last few
 years.
 Ouargla is to be direct to
 Havana it will offer Aeroflot
 little in advantage over the
 existing North Atlantic route.
 The distance from Ouargla is
 only a few hundred miles shorter
 than the distance from Murmansk
 to Havana.  Moscow would also
 have to negotiate overflight
 rights with Morocco.
 A more favorable route to
 Cuba via Africa would be through
 Morocco, and the USSR may intend
 to approach Morocco regarding a
 transit point on a route to
 Havana.  The Soviet-Moroccan
 air agreement signed in March
 1962 provided for the eventual
 extension of Aeroflot's service
 from Morocco to Central and
 South America; however, implemen-
 tation of such routes would
 probably require additional
 negotiations between the two
 countries. Moreover, Soviet
 use of Nouasseur air, base near
 Casablanca--apparently the only
 airfield which-can accommodate
 the TU-114--would be barred at
 least through the end of this

 COMPLETION OF FRIENDSHIP PIPELINE POSTPONED
 The target date for com-
 pletion of the much-publicized
 Friendship pipeline which will
 supply Soviet crude oil to
 selected East European countries
 apparently has been pushed
 back from 1963 to mid-1964.
 Construction is about seven
 months behind schedule on the
 995-mile sector of 40-inch
 pipe between Kuybyshev and
 Mozyr.   All other segments of
 the central system--which use
 smaller pipe--at the present
 rates of construction should
 be completed by the end of
 1963.
 With 40-inch pipe in short
 supply in the bloc, priority
 in its allocation has apparently
 been given, at least temporarily,
 to natural gas.  No deviation
 from the scheduled rate of con-
 struction of the 1,185-mile
 Gazli-Ural 40-inch gas pipeline
 scheduled for completion by the
 end of 1963, has been reported.
 The plan for 1962 called
 for completion of 250 miles of
 the Friendship line between
 Kuybyshev and Penza, but this
 sector will probably not be
 completed until at least August
 of this year.   The plan for the
 rest of 1963 envisages the ex-
 tension of the 40-inch pipeline
 beyond Penza, to Michurinsk.
 Rail tank cars have been
 used to supply crude oil to the
 Czechoslovakian portion of the
 Friendship pipeline, which also
 supplies the branch pipeline
 into Hungary.   Both of these
 lines were completed in 1962.
 Until the 40-inch segment can
 be completed, a similar arrange-
 ment will probably be made to
 supply crude oil to the branch
 line into Poland and East Ger-
 many.   This line is expected
 to be put into operation by the
 end of 1963.
 Only one branch pipeline to
 the Baltic Se.a--to the port of
 Ventspils--is now planned; con-
 struction is to begin in 1964 and
 to be completed the following year.
 Frequent mention has been made of
 Klaipeda as a second pipeline ter-
 minus on the Baltic, but shifting
 sands in the harbor have made con-
 tinual dredging necessary to keep
 the port navigable.   Construction
 of a pipeline from Polotsk to
 Kaliningrad, and beyond to the
 Baltic port of Baltysk, has been
 discussed as an alternative.

 Efforts by the Czechoslovak
 regime to stifle agitation for
 liberalization and redressment
 of past Stalinist policies have
 apparently met with little suc-
 cess.  Despite numerous speeches,
 warnings, and visits by top
 party officials to provincial
 party meetings, party leader
 Novotny still seems unable to
 silence critical party intellec-
 tuals and to bring the political
 situation--particularly in Slo-
 vakia--back under his undisputed
 control.
 The harsh regime pronounce-
 ments in June stemmed the flood
 of boldly critical articles in
 the two party dailies--which
 had come dangerously close to
 criticism of Novotny himself.
 However, criticism is again
 creeping into at least the Slo-
 vak party daily,-censured by
 Novotny in June, although it now
 refrains from singling out by
 name those involved in the ex-
 cesses of the "Stalin era."
 On the other hand the week-
 lies of the Czechoslovak Writers'
 Union, the Commission for Social-
 ist Culture and--especially--
 the Slovak Writers' Union have
 never relented in their campaign
 for de-Stalinization.  These
 journals continue to criticize--
 albeit in somewhat veiled terms--
 regime attempts to silence the
 intellectuals.  The Slovak
 Writers' Union weekly, singled
 out for attack by Novotny in
 June,, has not only vigorously
 defended itself but has reaf-
 firmed its commitment to views
 directly opposed to those ex-
 pressed by Novotny on the par-
 ty's past.
 Although much of the pres-
 ent                                                                   dispute centers on the
 fate of the Slovak "nationalists"
 condemned during the "Stalin
 era," the debate has been broad-
 ened to touch on the politi-
 cal--not purely cultural or
 ideological--issues of the na-
 ture of power and leadership
 responsibility in a socialist
 society.   In this context the
 regime is criticized not only
 for trying to stand in the way
 of a cultural "thaw" but for
 trying to resist the tide of
 the times--the "social necessity"
 of liberalization.
 The open opposition to
 Novotny's attempts to permit
 only limited or token de-Stalin-
 ization and the regime's con-
 tinued inability to cope ef-
 fectively with it suggest that
 the intellectuals have found
 important supporters in the
 higher echelons of the Czech-
 oslovak and Slovak parties.

 Nasir's public denunciation
 of Syria's Baathist leadership
 and the abortive coup attempt
 on .18 July have ended all pres-
 ent                       prospects for achieving the
 union of Egypt, Syria and Iraq
 planned last April.
 Nasir's 22 July speech was
 devoted almost entirely to re-
 counting his differences with
 the Syrian Baathists from the
 time of the formation of the 1958
 Syrian-Egyptian union to the pres-
 ent.    His aim was to shift the
 blame for the failure of the
 scheduled union of three coun-
 tries to the Syrian Baathists.
 Iraq was hardly mentioned.
 Nasir obliquely urged "con-
 scientious"Arab nationalists in
 the Baathist ranks to change
 their leadership.   He called for
 the formation of a new pan-Arab
 organization combining all Arab
 pro-unity elements.   Already
 Egyptian propaganda is trying
 to sell this idea in competition
 with the Baath's area-wide appeal
 and organization.
 Nasir made no reference to
 East-West problems or his rela-
 tions with the Communist bloc
 and the free world, an exception-
 al omission and a measure of his
 present obsession with intra-
 Arab affairs.
 Despite his denunciation
 of the Syrian Baathists he re-
 frained from criticism of Iraq
 which, unlike Syria, sent a dele-
 gation to the Egyptian anniver-
 sary celebrations.   Baghdad, in
 turn, continues its line of
 brotherhood with Egypt and
 Nasir as a means of assuring
 that blame for failure of the
 proposed federation falls on
 the Egyptians.
 Although the Baath's first
 reaction to the speech hinted
 that Syria and Iraq might pro-
 ceed with a union of their own,
 within a day both Prime Minister
 Bitar and the Council of the
 Revolutionary Command broadcast
 declarations which implied that
 further efforts would be made
 to reach an accommodation with
 Nasir regarding tripartite union.
 Bitar, at the same time, did not
 entirely brush aside the possi-
 bility of a bilateral Iraqi-
 Syrian union.   He announced that
 a general conference of the
 party's branches from through-
 out the Arab world is planned
 soon in which future strategy
 will be decided.
 The abortive pro-Nasir coup
 in Damascus on 18 July did not
 catch the regime entirely un-
 awares.   Indications are that
 the move was ill-conceived and
 hastily carried out.   Thirty-
 four of its participants have
 been summarily executed, and
 Damascus radio has broadcast a
 list of nearly 60 others on the
 regime's "wanted" list.   Trials
 in absentia are 'scheduled and
 sentences will be summarily
 carried out upon apprehension of
 the "criminals."
 This policy of executions is
 a clear break with the past.   At
 no time since Syrian independence
 in 1945 have unsuccessful con-
 spirators been executed.   Al-
 though some were sentenced to
 death,the sentences always have
 been commuted.
 The reason for the outbreak
 of firing in Damascus again on
 24 July remains unclear.

 ROBERTO'S GROUP GAINS AMONG ANGOLAN REBELS
 Holden Roberto's political-
 ly moderate Union of Angolan
 Peoples (UPA) appears to be
 gaining ascendancy in the long,
 bitter rivalry between Angola's
 rebel groups.
 Roberto's government-in-
 exile, with headquarters in
 Leopoldville, received its first
 major boost on 29 June when
 Congo's Premier Adoula official-
 ly recognized it.   Adoula sub-
 sequently granted Roberto ex-
 clusive Angolan use of radio
 Congo for broadcasts into Angola.
 Adoula's action forced the
 hand of the nine-nation African
 Liberation Committee, set up at
 the late May Addis Ababa summit
 conference, which had hoped to
 form a united Angolan front.
 On 18 July committee rep-
 resentatives  visiting Leopold-
 ville announced that they would
 recommend to the African foreign
 ministers' meeting in Dakar
 early  next  month  that all
 aid to Angolan nationalists be
 channeled to the UPA through the
 Leopoldville government.   They
 were convinced that the UPA had
 the only effective fighting
 force inside Angola and that
 the Congo's key geographic posi-
 tion made it impossible to ig-
 nore Adoula's desires.
 The UPA's principal rival
 the Popular Movement for the
 Liberation of Angola (MPLA),
 will protest this recommenda-
 tion at Dakar and its supporters
 are likely to renew efforts to
 form a common front.   Roberto
 wants to absorb the MPLA's mod-
 est military arm but has con-
 sistently resisted unity with
 its capable, well-educated
 leaders who might pose a danger
 to his own position.
 In the long run, the strength-
 ening of Roberto's organization
 may further decrease chances of
 a negotiated settlement between
 the Portuguese and the Angolan
 nationalists.   While the Portu-
 guese believe the UPA to be
 racially oriented and firmly
 committed to the ouster of all
 white influence, there is a
 feeling current throughout Angola
 that an eventual accommodation
 could be effected between the
 whites and the Portuguese-edu-
 cated leaders of the MPLA, which
 has been more a Portuguese oppo-
 sition party than an Angolan
 independence  art

 With the arrest of 17
 whites, Indians, and Africans
 in Johannesburg on 11 July,'the
 South African police appear to
 have broken up the last large
 subversive organization in the
 country.   The 17 reportedly con-
 stituted most of the top leader-
 ship of "Spear of the Nation,"
 a Communist-influenced sabotage
 group which had eluded the po-
 lice for two years.   In mid-
 July the police also picked up
 the leaders of a small Trotsky-
 ite                roue
 Earlier this year, "Pogo," a
 loosely organized African racist
 movement, had been broken up
 after a year of rapid growth.
 "Spear of the Nation,"
 thanks to the organizational
 know-how of its Communist back-
 ers, had the greatest staying
 power of any of these movements.
 By insisting on tight security,
 the Communists managed to develop
 an extensive network of local
 action groups under relatively
 close central control.    Just
 before the 11 July raid they
 even managed to set up a clan-
 destine radio transmitter in a
 Johannesburg suburb.   The police
 apparently had made no headway
 against "Spear of the Nation"
 until new legislation earlier
 this year gave them more ex-
 tensive powers.
 Along with the 17 leaders,
 a huge quantity of documents
 was picked up in the 11 July
 raid.   'Further police action
 against local cells is there-
 fore likely.
 As most of the Communists
 are now in jail or in exile
 they will have difficulty main-
 taining their influence among
 what subversive bodies sur-
 vive inside South Africa.  If
 the Communists fail to main-
 tain their authority, the rem-
 nants  of:  "Spear of the Na-
 tion"  within the country will
 probably lose much of their
 cohesion and might waste their
 assets as "Pogo"  did, in
 spectacular but fruitless ac-
 tions.  Without the Communists
 to moderate their racism, the
 movement's Africans might also
 turn in the direction of anti-
 white violence.

 COMMON MARKET AND TURKEY REACH AGREEMENT
 After four years of inter-
 mittent negotiation, the EEC
 and Turkey have concluded and
 are expected to sign in September
 an agreement giving Turkey
 limited association with the
 Common Market.  The agreement is
 economically important to
 Turkey and is in keeping with
 Ankara's desire to promote closer
 ties with Western Europe.  The
 accord is also something of a
 foreign policy "success" for
 the EEC, but one which renews
 concern over the dimensions of
 the Common Market's preferential
 trading area, which now includes
 eighteen African states and
 Greece.
 Under the association agree-
 ment, about 37 percent of Turkey's
 exports to the Community--tobacco,,
 dried figs, dried dates, and nuts
 --will receive preferred entry.
 Tariff quotas for each of these
 products have been established
 and may be increased.  Provision
 is also made for a possible
 opening of quotas on other Turk-
 ish  products in the future.                  In
 addition to this guarantee of
 access to the EEC market, the
 Turkish economy will also bene-
 fit from developmental assist-
 ance from the Community which
 could amount to as much as
 $125 million.
 While this economic arrange-
 ment is of most immediate bene-
 fit to Turkey, the gradual estab-
 lishment of a customs union and
 full participation by Turkey in
 the EEC is the eventual goal.
 An association Council--composed
 of EEC and Turkish representatives
 --with decision-making powers
 will be the vehicle for accom-
 plishing this goal.
 The lengthy negotiations
 required to produce the agree-
 ment reflected the extreme dif-
 ficulty the Common Market has
 had in reconciling its willing-
 nessto accommodate Turkey with
 its obligation to abide by
 the most-favored-nation prin-
 ciple.   Since Turkey will-not
 be economically able for many
 years to participate fully in
 the EEC, the Common Market felt
 it had few alternatives to
 entering into such a discrimina-
 tory arrangement.   Besides seek-
 ing to strengthen its ties with
 a NATO ally, the EEC has seen
 fit to conclude such an associa-
 tion in order to combat criticism
 that it is not an outward look-
 ing community.  Despite efforts
 to camouflage the agreement with
 association trappings, it will
 be difficult to justify under
 GATT rules for either free
 trade areas or customs unions.
 Now that the EEC has set
 the precedent for preferential
 trade agreements, it will find
 it difficult to avoid an exten-
 sion of similar privileges to
 other Middle Eastern countries,
 notably Iran and Israel, with
 which the EEC has been negoti-
 ating for some time.   Both of
 these countries have been
 pressing the Common Market for
 preferred access for some of
 their major export items.

 Lisbon is in the process of re-
 inforcing its 5,000-man military
 force in that colony by as many
 as'4,000 troops.   This move under-
 lines Portugal's determination
 to retain control of this small
 West African territory at a time
 when the UN Security Council
 debates Portuguese colonialism
 in Africa.
 the rebels had
 secured considerable control
 over much of the southern sector
 of Portuguese Guinea.   This area
 is adjacent to the Republic of
 Guinea where the principal
 Portuguese Guinean nationalist
 organization is based.
 Defense Minister Gomes de
 Araujo--briefly referring to
 the province in a 17 July inter-
 view--acknowledged that rebel
 groups were operating in about
 15 percent of Portuguese Guinea.
 This statement was the first
 official public admission that
 the situation is deteriorating and
 may have been intended to prepare
 the public for the possibility
 that the province might eventually
 be lost.  A subsequent state-
 ment by the Defense Ministry
 denying that rebels controlled
 any area was probably an attempt
 to counteract adverse publicity

 debate.
 In any event, Lisbon will

 ces of Angola and Mozambique.
 In fact, the reinforcements
 now being sent to Portuguese
 Guinea are being diverted from
 assignments to those areas.
 The US Embassy in Lisbon
 believes that these additional
 forces may permit the Portuguese
 to extend their area of effective
 control and make the loss of the
 province less imminent.   The
 embassy is convinced, however,
 that the rebels cannot be con-
 clusively defeated because the
 terrain facilitates guerrilla
 activities and because the
 insurgents have the advantage
 of sanctuaries in Senegal and
 the Republic of Guinea.
 Lisbon also appears to be
 trying to counteract some of
 the criticism leveled against
 it in the UN.  The regime's
 concern is implicit in its
 decision to appoint an indige-
 nous person to an "important
 government post" in Portuguese
 Guinea soon in order to create
 the impression that it is
 increasing the province's inter-
 nal autonomy.   Such a move,
 hcwever, does not herald a change
 in Lisbon's basic policy of
 refusing any substantive con-
 cession in the direction of
 self-determination as the person
 selected--while termed a "moderate
 nationalist"--is considered by     25X1
 Lisbon to be completely loyal to
 the regime.

 The hiatus in Guatemalan
 political plotting which fol-
 lowed the overthrow of the
 Ydigoras regime last March may
 be over.   Symptomatic of this is
 the recent arrest of several ex-
 treme rightists who are accused
 of trying to line up military
 support for a coup against the
 government of Col. Enrique Peralta.
 It seems likely that there will
 be more manifestations of anti-
 government activity in view of
 indications that the initial
 popular approval accorded Peralta
 is now giving way to increasing
 discontent.
 Most non-Communist politi-
 cians applauded the Peralta-led
 military coup in the belief that
 Ydigoras'  erratic political manip-
 ulations would ensure the re-
 election tnis year of ex-Presi-
 dent Juan Jose Arevalo.   They
 feared that Arevalo's return to
 power would pave the way for
 eventual Communist domination of
 the Guatemalan Government as
 was the case following his 1945-
 1951 term in office.
 The recent change in attitude
 of these leaders is traceable,
 in part,  to their belief that
 they have been ignored by the
 government.   Their disenchantment
 has been heightened by a general
 feeling that the regime's mainte-
 ance of a state of siege and other
 repressive measures is no longer
 warranted.   In addition, rightist
 elements are registering bitter
 resentment against the government's
 economic and fiscal reforms which
 include the introduction, for the
 first time, of an income tax.
 The government has recently
 indicated that it is not alto-
 gether insensitive to the criti-
 cism now being leveled against
 it.   A recent controversial de-
 cree denying certain civil rights
 has been modified.   On 17 July
 Peralta, in a nationwide address,
 specifically denied rumors that
 his regime plans a plebiscite to
 perpetuate itself in power.  He
 was careful, however, to leave
 no doubt that any activity threaten-
 ing the stability of his govern-
 ment would be suppressed.   In an-
 other gesture to refurbish the
 image of his administration,
 Peralta dusted off Guatemala's
 old claim to  British Honduras
 and on 24 July carried out his
 threat to act against Great Britain's
 new plan for independence of the
 colony by breaking relations with
 London.

 The government's dispute
 with Communist-led tin miners
 seems headed for an early show-
 down which could touch off wide-
 spread violence.    The 4-week
 strike at the Catavi tin mine,
 Bolivia's largest, is continuing;
 24-hour strikes are being car-
 ried out at several others,
 and a sympathy walkout by mem-
 bers of the Factory Workers'
 Union is imminent.
 The problem has its roots
 in President Victor Paz Estens-
 soro's determination to turn
 Bolivia's chronically uneconomic
 tin mining operations into a
 paying proposition.   The es-
 sential feature in the plan
 he is pushing to achieve this
 is aimed at ending featherbed-
 ding and.at"reclassifying" many
 miners to other jobs.   This pro-
 posal is anathema to the unions,
 and has been rejected out of
 hand unless the government agrees
 to excessive wage increases to
 accompany the proposed reform
 measure.
 The argument started coming
 to a head on 1 July when Com-
 munist labor leaders at Catavi
 ordered certain specialized
 workers to go on strike in pro-
 test against the government's
 proposals.   The strike was de-
 clared illegal on 8 July and the
 government took steps to close
 the mine.    On 12 July, the
 workers agreed to return to their
 jobs, but only if the government
 paid them for the time they were
 on strike.   President Paz Estens-
 soro refused and the ensuing
 deadlock has caused the situa-
 tion to drift inexorably toward
 a point of no return for either
 side.
 Any violence that may
 result from these maneuvers
 would provide Paz with an excuse
 for sending regular army troops
 into the mining areas to restore
 order, declaring a national state
 of siege, and perhaps attempt-
 ing a roundup of Communist lead-
 ers., Presumably with these pos-
 sibilities in mind, Paz has placed
 the military on alert status
 The prospects are that Paz, who
 can count on the support of the
 military and units of armed peas-
 ants,, would be able to weather
 any conflict he may have with
 the miners.

 ECUADOREAN DEVELOPMENTS
 In the two weeks since the
 overthrow of President Arosemena,
 it has become possible tentatively to identify the locus of
 power within the military junta
 as well as the general direction.
 its policies are likely to take.
 Opinion is widespread that
 the strong man of the four-man
 junta is Colonel Marcos Gandara,
 who usually acts as its spokes-
 man.   Gandara seems to be at
 once the best informed. member
 of the group and the one with
 the clearest ideas as to what
 needs to be done.    He is on
 record as saying that although
 the armed forces have no am-
 bitions to hold the country's
 political reins, the "revolution"
 will fail if they do not ensure
 the effective implementation of
 fundamental reforms.
 The junta issued a state-
 ment on 18 July declaring that
 it seeks to promote the country's
 economic development in a way
 that will benefit the people
 through increased production and
 a more equitable distribution
 of the national wealth.   What
 the junta seems to have in mind
 is an over-all development plan
 which will include reforms in
 land holding, fiscal policies
 and administration.
 The junta envisions the
 convening in October of a con-
 stituent assembly to consider a
 new constitution now being
 drafted by the Supreme Court.
 It hopes to hold general elec-
 tions sometime in 1964, but is
 making no commitment until it
 has a better picture of how its
 program is progressing.
 In the meantime, the
 regime has cracked down hard
 on the Communists.   It has
 acted. to remove Communists
 from government jobs, and on
 18 July outlawed the party it-
 self.   These actions have en-
 couraged non-Communist labor
 leaders to move against Com-
 munists in positions of in-
 fluence.
 Their next
 step might be the establish-
 ment of a new national labor
 organization composed of the
 free trade union movement and
 possibly the Catholic unions.
 In foreign affairs, the
 foreign minister has declared
 that Ecuador will follow a
 policy of solidarity with other
 American nations in the attempt
 to control Castro-Communist
 subversion in the hemisphere.
 He also indicated support for
 the entry  of Canada, Jamaica,
 and Trinidad and Tobago into
 the Organization of American
 States.   The regime, however,
 has been slow in gaining for-
 eign recognition.   So far, it
 has been recognized by only
 four countries and the Vatican.
 Junta Chairman Castro
 Jijon has agreed to instruct
 the navy to stop harassing
 US fishing craft.   Thus some
 sort of a modus vivendi on
 the basis of a twelve-mile
 limit now seems to be in pros-
 pect.

 Dominican Republic:   The
 previously widespread rumors of
 an impending military coup
 have been put to rest for the
 time being by public denials
 from principal military leaders
 and by surprisingly strong
 expressions of support for con-
 stitutional government from all
 political sectors, including
 the extreme left.   However, a
 more serious confrontation over
 President Juan Bosch's policy
 toward domestic Communists may
 be in the offing.   For his part,
 Bosch, in a speech on 16 July,
 put Dominicans on notice that
 he would resign rather than bow
 to what he considered undue
 pressure.   Foreign Minister
 Andres Freites has expressed
 fear that the President might
 already be on the point of
 returning to exile as a self-
 styled political martyr
 Haiti:   Last week's abor-
 tive attack on a military out-
 post by remnants of the late
 Clement Barbot's followers appears
 to have been a last-ditch effort.
 It. probably marks the end, at
 least for the present, of any
 organized internal opposition
 to the regime.   Reports of an
 "invasion" by 50 exiles at
 Arcahaie, about 25 miles north-
 west of Port-au-Prince, were
 not confirmed and are now con-
 sidered doubtful.
 Argentina:   Political ma-
 neuverinmss now centered on the
 electoral college which is sched-
 uled to elect a president and
 vice president on 31 July.  There
 are indications that Dr. Arturo
 Illia and his running mate on
 the People's Radical Civic
 Union ticket (UCRP), Carlos
 Perette, probably have lined
 up enough votes to be nominated.
 Extensive horse-trading is also
 going on among the numerous
 political parties in connection
 with the election of 46 national
 senators by the provincial
 legislatures on 29 July, and
 of 23 governors by provincial
 electoral colleges late next
 month.   In the selection of
 senators, the UCRP, which won
 the recent general elections
 by only a small plurality, is
 expected to fall short of a
 majority.
 Peru:   President-elect
 Belaunde Terry is to be inaugu-
 rated on 28 July after a year
 of military rule.   However,
 his apparent hesitancy in mak-
 ing decisions reportedly is
 becoming a matter of concern
 among Peruvian officials.
 Belaunde has been unusually
 slow in naming his cabinet
 ministers and apparently has
 a penchant for /prolonged con-
 sultations before making up
 his mind on what have been
 described as even "trivial"
 matters. It may be, on the
 other hand,  that he is moving
 with extraordinary caution
 because, as the head of a
 minority government, he will
 want to avoid antagonizing
 either the opposition political
 leaders or the military, which
 still hovers in the background.
