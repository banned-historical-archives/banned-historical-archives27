 CPSU Struggle Against Revisionism
 "The struggle against revisionism is one of.the most-important tasks
 of all Communist and Workers Parties," states I. Negodayev in his book,
 Sovremenn   Revisionism -- Oruzhiye Reaktsii (Contemporary Revisionism
 Is the Weapon of Reaction), Moscow, 1959..  Accordingly, nearly all official
 organs of the CPSU and the Communist Parties of the union republics-
 con-tain, at one time or another,, articles intended to expose "the insidious-
 ness of revisionism."
 Kommunist Ukrainy, chief theoretical organ of the Communist Party
 of the Ukraine, in its issue No 6, June 1960; publishes an article by
 1. Kovalev entitled "The Growth of the Leading Role of the CPSU During
 the Period of the Extensive Building of Communism.."'-. The author states:
 "...The June 1957 Central Committee plenum, following Leninist directions,
 unmasked and ideologically routed the antiparty group of Malenkov, Kagano-
 vich, Molotov, Bulganin, and Shepilov, which, while employing the lowest
 devices of factional, schismatic struggles, attempted to destroy party
 unity, prevent the fulfillment of the 20th Party Congress decress, and
 turn the party and nation away from the Leninist path. Having defeated
 the antiparty group, the party united even more-closely around the Cen-
 tral Committee under the banner of Marxism-Leninism.-  Our party is now
 monolithic and unified as never before. and is capable of solving the
 great problems involved in constructing a Communist society.  The most
 shining affirmation of this. fact is the victories. gained by the Soviet',
 people under party leadership in the first and second year of the Seven-
 Year Plan.
 "The Soviet people, in building Communism, are traveling along new,
 unexplored paths.  Marxist-Leninist theory plays an especially great role
 in such circumstances, for it gives clearness of purpose and certitude
 of victory.  By its creative development of Marxist-Leninist theory, the
 party illuminates the path of practical activity in the struggle for
 Communism.. The statements of contemporary revisionists are shown to be
 pitiable in regard to their view that the building of socialism can be
 accomplished without the leadership of the revolutionary Marxist party.
 The purpose of these statements is to disarm the working class and all
 workers in their struggle against the exploitative system...."
 Kommunist, chief theoretical organ of the CPSU, in its issue No 10,
 July 1960, publishes an article by F. Konstantinov and Kh. Momdzhyan en-
 titled "Dialetics and the Present Day," which attacks the "tendency of
 some political leaders to regard the course of peaceful coexistence and
 the struggle for disarmament as a deviation from the Marxist-Leninist `
 ?
 position in the class struggle."  The authors criticize those "striving
 to sow distrust in the rightness of the decisions of the 20th and 21st
 Party Congresses on the possibility of preventing a new world war under
 present-day conditions,...these tendencies cannot be qualified in any other 11
 way but as a mistaken dogma and left-sectarianism....

 Not all articles, however, deal directly with revisionism per Be.
 Some, like the article "Elaboration of the History of the October Rev-
 olution Following the 20th Congress of the C.PSU" by V. O. Ruslyakova
 (Voprosy Istorii, No 5, May 1960), present a critical examination of
 works on socioeconomic premises of the Proletarian revolution in Russia
 and praise such writers as Volobuyev, Sidorov, and Mantsev for refuting
 the revio#;onist conception of "absolute; backwardness of Russia."'  Rusla-
 kova's  article severely criticizes V. P. Nasyrin for his article showing
 the "revisionist conception of 'peaceful maturation' of socialism.in the
 womb of capitalism," which was published in Voprosy Istorii, No 5, May
 1956.
 lu an ar 4,cle "On Lars Governing the Cultural Revolution, " .also
 appearing in Voprosy Istorii, No 5, May 1960, M. P. Kim vigorously assails
 the revisionist theory of cultural maturity" which rejects the influence
 of "bourges r" cultural attainments.
 Articles "exposing" or attacking revisionism appear not only in of-
 ficial party orgtins; many are published in cultural and literary period-
 icals and newspapers.  Among these is the review of the book, Problemy
 Realizma (The Problems of Realiam) by V. pneprov, Leningrad, 1-960ch
 appears in Literature i Zhizn', 1. June 1960.  The reviewer points out
 that the author argues effectively with.;revisipnist writers in Poland
 and Yugoslavia against bourgeois aesthetics and modernism.
 Literature i Zhizn' of 15 June 196d contains an article by Al.
 Bymshits which discusses various books that have appeared in 1959-1960
 dealing with ideological problems.  The author reports that the book
 Protiv Burzhuaznykh Kontse tp siy i Revizonizma v Zarubezhom ,Liter-
 atusovedenii  Against Bourgeois Conceptions and Revisionism in Foreign
 Literature), a collective work from the institute of World Literature
 imeni Gor'kiy, edited by A. Bement'yev, A. Puzikov, and Ya. El'sberg,
 concerns the struggle against .""modern bourgeois ideology and modern
 revisionism." The article by I. Anisimor, "Against Reactionary
 Theories of Contemporary Literature," criticizes the existentialists
 and "'anmasks the revisionist ideas" of ]. Lukach and A. Le Fevre, and
 shows the "spiritual flimsiness of the formalistic and aristocratic
 art theories" of Ortega y Gasset and others.  Yu. Borev's article on
 Le Fevre draws a "Portrait" of one of the active revisionists and
 discloses the anti-Marxist essence of his writings.  Ya. El'sberg's
 article analyzes the aesthetic platform of existentialism and describes
 some of the works of Lukach, "the partriarch of modern revisionism
 in literature," Vhose.works are intended as a re-examination of Marxism-
 Leninism.  The book Tvorcheskiy Marksizm i Pustotsvety Revizionizma

 (Cretative Marxism and the Sterility of Revisionism), by Z. Gershkovich,
 sharply criticizes the works of Polish, Hungarian, and Yugoslav revi-
 sionists; it deals with works by D'yerdya Lukach, Leshek Kolakovsikiy,
 Henri Le Fevre, and Risto Toshovich, which "serve as masked propaganda
 of bourgeois individualism and decadence," Dymshits says.
 In the new't)oks by Soviet critics and those who are carrying on the
 struggle against "bourgeois aesthetics and the aesthetic deceptions of
 revisionism," whits sees not only an unmasking of the enemy;, but also
 an a7tta .. on h"  Ile says that in the book 0 Bess ornom i Spornozn (On
 Mat Which Can Re Argued and That Which Cannot o by Ya. El'sberg, the
 struggle against existentialism and revisionism is clearly and firmly
 presented.  The book Obraz Kommunista v Sovetskov Literature'(The Image
 of a Cozru'nunist and Soviet Literature), by V. Ozerov, attacks the prop-
 agandists of "heroless" literature and revisionists such as Iosip Vidmar,
 Andzhey Braun,. and others who accuse the Russians of "antihumanism" and
 who in practice "atteupt to I,eazd art along the road,. of petit-bourgeois
 individualism," according to 1  nshits-  The book '+azgoyr Po PPirodu...
 (Conversation of the Occasion)), by A.' Makarov, presents  a  og,c .
 attack against' bourgeois ideology and an unmasking of treacherous
 revisionism."  And in the book Glavnr  Geroy (The Main Hero), V. Pankov
 depicts the people in postwar Soviet literature.  The reviewer maintains
 that the book is politically sharp and directed against everything that
 "hinders the development of Soviet art and socialist realism."  The author,
 Dymshits says, wages war against foreign revisionism and against "the
 penetration of bourgeois influences in the Soviet literary environment."

 Revisionism Among Intellectuals
 Two controversies among the intellectuals in Communist China have
 been taking place since approximately the beginning of 1960.  One con-
 troversy, associated primarily with the name Pa Jen (Wang Jen-shu), has
 involved the rejection of political direction and goals for literature,
 and the other, carried on in terms of a debate on the unity of thought
 and existence, has involved acceptance of the universal applicability of
 the law of the unity of opposites and :he contradiction thesis.
 Enduring Universals Over Politics
 Discussions of Pa Jen and his espousal of a humanitarianism and
 human nature which would replace the political content of proletarian
 literature have multiplied since the republication, along wit).suitable
 articles of criticism, of his article ""On Human Sentiments"' (originally
 written during the bloom-and-contend period) in the 26 January 1960 issue
 of Wen-i Pao.  As subsequent issues of'Wen-i Pao and other. periodicals,
 including Hsin Chien-she, Chum-kuo Lh"in -nien, and some of the organs
 of provincial party committees, took 'up Pa Jens case, criticisms of the
 "revisionism" represented by Pa Jen 'broadened out to include all intel-
 lectuals who still harbored remnants of "Bourgeois viewpoints" which
 caused them to preach standards transcending politics.
 The composite, ease of the rev sionists in this controversy is
 that political direction and aims for proletarian literature have re-
 sulted in the loss of all qualities which could give this literature
 greatness.  The subsitutes that the revisionists offer -- beauty, reality,
 humanitariansim, himan nature -- have in common the characteristic that
 standards for literature should transcend politics.
 Issue No 8 of Wen-i Pao, 26 April 1960 (page 21), carried an
 abstract of the proceedings of the 1    ership meting of the Shanghai
 Branch Association of the China Writers:. Association, which dealt in
 part with revisionism in literary circles.  The periodical said:
 "The conference criticized Chiang Kung-yang, Chien Ku-yang,
 Jen Chun, and similar people for their revisionist viewpoints.  These
 people disparage the accomplishments of;socialist letters, believing
 that it has not, and moreover cannot, produce model personalities.

 These revisionists oppose the serving of proletarian politics by letters.
 They insist that beauty must be above reality, class, and politics and
 that if there is only 'practicality' to serve the needs of the revolution,
 we cannot speak of beauty.  They propagate bourgeois humanitarianism on
 a large-scale and wipe out the basic difference between proletarian and
 bourgeois humanitarianism.  They want socialist letters to manifest bour-
 geois humanitarian ideology.  They deny the decisive function of the
 writers' world viewpoint, on his methods of writing and believe that the
 tiethods of writing of realism and romanticism can transcend periods and
 class, and develop.. independently.  They also make extreme efforts to ex-
 aggerate the accomplishments and advanced function of the bourgeois
 letters of l9th Century Europe.  They oppose criticism and re-evaluation
 of these 19th Century writers using the viewpoint of historical materi-
 alism.                               The conference engaged in deep discussions and criticisms of
 these wrong viewpoints and many comrades pointed out that the core of
 these theories amounts to the liquidation of the class nature of letters
 and the rubbing out of the boundaries between proletarian  and bourgeois
 letters."
 The lead article of the same issue of Wen-i Pao (page 4) was an
 attack by Chien Chun-jui,.deputy director of the Staff Office for Cul-
 ture and Education, on the humanitarians, pacifists, advocates of the
 "writing of reality," and advocates of "creative freedom" in literary
 circles.   In his general attack, Ch'ien.stateds
 "Revisionism is an objective thing which exists as the reflec-
 tion of bourgeois antisocialist ideology within the working class and
 the party.  In a socialist state, before the influence of the political
 ideology of the bourgeoisie is thoroughly eliminated, bourgeois anti-
 socialist ideology generally objectively exists.  Moreover, such ideology
 frequently poses as fragrant flowers of socialism.  The revisionism
 in literature is of this type.  It is a wolf in sheep's clothing, using
 the name of Marxism-Leninism to. practice opportunism and capitalism.
 Revisionism in literature is the manifestation of political revisionism
 in the sphere of letters and arts..  The modern revisionism represented
 by the Yugoslav ruling clique (not excluding the Chinese revisionists)
 has as its real aim the liquidation of the class struggle and of the
 socialist revolution, the weakening and elimination of the proletarian
 dictatorship and of the leadership of the Communist party....rrThe modern
 revisionists, to attain the goals which they cannot tell to other people,
 in the sphere of literature, trumpet bourgeois humanitarianism, Jiuman
 nature, and pacifism to oppose the revolutionary will of the masses.  At
 the same time, they use bourgeois realism to oppose the revolutionary

 realism of the proletariat.  They propose the 'writing of reality,' which
 has the twisting of socialist realism. ,s its goal.  They deny the decisive
 function of the revolutionary world viewpoint on the?creations of liter-
 ature.                 They proclaim the empty  creative freedom' of the bourgeoisie and
 oppose the leadership of.l3tterature by; the party and the state."
 Chien then attacked the revisionists in literature by groups.
 The Yugoslavs, he said, are preaching glass harmony to be achieved through
 humanitarian relationships and feelings.  He charged that Hu.Feng, Feng
 Hsueh-feng, and Pa Jen have all been g? silty of this ' offense .  f?a den, he
 said, had attacked the party and socialism in 1956-1957; he had attacked
 socialist letters as lacking in "ht1 Etn sentiments" and "human.itarianism
 of a basic human nature." and had clamored that humanitarianism should be
 the "foundation" of-literature.  Even now, Ch' ien said, Pa Jen has not
 carried out conscientious self-criticism and reform.
 It is of interest to note that the April 1960 issue of Hsin
 Chien-she (page 17) had carried an article by one of Pa Jen's critics,
 Li Hsi-fang which stated teat "this co*rixpt theory of human nature can
 still form a kind of opposition current to confront socialist letters"
 ;
 and that the 1 July 1960 issue of Chun'-kuo Ch'en  Wien (page 17) carried
 an article by Meng I which said-     .e   eory o  human nature and human-
 itarianism in the ideological system of bourgeois literary studies can
 today still. deceive some of the yout:c and constitute a ieapon of the
 revisionists at home and abroad for attacking Marxism-Leninism.  It is
 especially necessary today for us to thoroughly liquidate them.  In
 today's society, to trumpet abstract and trans class human nature and
 humanitarianism, to deny party and class, to compromise or obliterate
 the class struggles -- these are to plot for the maintenance of the
 interests and ruling position. of the bourgeoisie, and. absolutely cannot
 be tolerated."
 Ch'ien Chu: ,g- ju1's attack on Pa Jen is only one. of many published
 by Chinese Communist periodicals.  One.of.the most informative was the
 article "What Kind of Good Is Pa Jen'   'Reaching Principles Through
 Feelings,'" by Liu Ning, ptolish,ed in  ;sin Chien-she, No 6, 7 June 1960.
 In answer to the question of how Pa Jet is revising the theory of the
 class struggle, Liu said-
 Superf   lly, he [Pa Jena does not deny the class struggle. On the
 contrary, he asserts that the class theorists in literature do not under-
 stand where the 'pivot' of the class struggle advocated by, the proletariat
 resides.  He attacks ':dogma' and 'lack of human sentiments' in today's
 literature, believing that these defect,s are due to a 'mechanical under-,
 stancJ.i.ng of the principle of the theory of class in literature.'  However,
 this is simply the cunning that constitutes a habit of revisionism..   Chair-
 man Mao has ta*.t us that 'revisioni.sts and rightist opport uxnists wear
 the sign of Marxism and also attack d,ognatism, but that what they .attack
 are the most fundamental things of I i ctsni.'

 "Pa Jen is exactly:like this.  He pretends to acknowledge the
 class struggle, but dctuaU $ twists and denies the most basic things of
 the theory of class struggle of Marxism from the three basic aspects of
 reasons, aims, and procedures."  (Page 55-56)
 In reasons for class struggle, Liu said, Pa Jen believes that
 there are "...requirements, loves, and hopes which can be said to arise
 from basic human nature.  Class society suppresses the basic human nature
 of mankind and therefore there is class struggle."  Liu paraphrases Pa
 Jen as saying that class struggle arises because human nature is repressed
 or because the wants, loves, and hopes of people are obstructed.  "To his
 [Pa Jen's] way of speaking, between enemy classes there exists no basic
 confrontation of class interests.  On the contrary, there exists the so-
 called 'basic nature of mankind' which pervades everyone, and class strug-
 gle has its cause in the suppression of this 'basic nature of mankind.'
 We must therefore necessarily arrive at the followirr  conclusion:  Class
 contradictions and struggles are not incapable of' co:"promise. It is
 necessary only to bring out:a little more of the 'basic nature of mankind'
 in the enemy classes, necessary only to futher 'seek similarities' and
 not to obstruct the existence and development of the enemy class, and it
 will be possible to eliminate class struggle."  (page 56)
 A .second  type  of .ravisionisit  in literature attacked
 by    Chinn  Chug-juil in  his article in the 26 April 1960 issue of Wen-
 i Pao were the advocates of the "writing of reality," who, he said, in-
 clude the Hungarian revisionist Lukcas, Hu Feng, Feng,Hsieh-feng, and now,
 Li Ho-lin.   He accused them of believing that there is no need to study
 revolutionary theory or to be familiar with the social livelihood of the
 masses or to go among them, and of denying the relations between politics
 and literature and the decisive function of world viewpoints for writing.
 Lukcas is said to have stated that world viewpoints are "intrusions" which
 hinder the writer from being impartial and faithful in recording reality.
 Ch'ien said that in its present form, as expressed by Li Ho-lin, this
 revisionist trend asserts that the "ideology" in a work depends on whether
 the work reflect.s..Je, and that the success of this reflection is the
 equivalent of the level of the art incorporated in the work; hence the
 formula, ideology is reality is art, or, art is politics.
 The attacks on the humanitarians and writers of reality have
 introduced, as a subsidiary issue, the problem of the standards by which
 literature is to be judged, an issue which has been taken up as a subject
 in its own right in the periodicals.
 The 1 June .1.960 issue of Wen-i Pao (page 10) carried an article
 ent tied "On the Power for Life of Classic Works and the So-Called 'Uni-
 vextal Human Nature..'"  The article stated the line of the revisionists
 by quoting Pa Jen as saying, "The content which, in a product of art,

 in all ages, can stimulate the people of diffei*nt social classes, is the
 characteristics common to all mankind."  In contrast, the author cited
 Mao as denying the existence of somethi:n;abstract and universal which
 can be reflected in literature, and sayi.ag that human feelings and human-
 itarianism must be expressed through the concrete.  Love, the most prev-
 alett of the "universals" common to all mankind mentioned by the revi-
 sionists, said the author, has its significance in classic works of
 literature not in its own right, but because profound social relationships
 are revealed through such "universals."  Similarly, the 11 June 1960
 issue of Wen-i Pao (page 14) stated:  ".Wherever they [the revisionists]
 find manifestations of human nature, in classic works, we find manifes-
 tations of class nature."
 The theme of standards for literary criticism was also discussed
 by the 1 July 1960 issue of Chyng-kuo Ching-nien (page 17).  An article
 entitled "Use the Method of Historicism 'to Critically Inherit Literature"
 criticized adulation of the 19th Century European "realists" on the
 grounds that although these writers did expose and criticize the realities
 of their day, they were unable to escape their class limitations and so
 operated from the positions of individualism, democracy, and reformism.
 Theiarticle advocated that the works of these writers, as the works of
 all, writers of the past, be critically accepted on the basis of assign-
 ing superior and classic status to those works which  can help us to
 understand the society of that time and to increase our knowledge of the
 class struggle."
 A third group of revisionists ixliterature criticized by Ch'ien
 Chun-jui in his article in the 26 April 1960 issue of Wen-i Pao are the
 pacifists.  Chien identified no members of this group except for cred-
 iting Lukcas with having laid the theoretical foundations for this stand.
 The pacifists, he said, do not distinguish between just and unjust wars.
 He accused them of spreading fear of injury, pessimism, and fear psy-
 chology among the people, of not seeking the cause of war "in the nature
 of imperialism," and of not admitting to "the justice of righteous wars."
 They picture the horrors of battlefields to "sap the will of the people,
 the proletariat, and the oppressed clas.ae ," he said, and they oppose
 all, wars as against human nature and humanity.
 A fourth group of revisionists in literature criticized by Chien
 Chun-jui are the advocates of "creative freedom."  This group, which re-
 jects the leadership or supervision of the party over literature and re-
 fuses to serve politics, includes Wu Tsu- uang and Ch'in Yao-yang.  Pa
 Jen is also considered a member of the group, since he "hates the leader-
 ship of the party" and wants a policy of broad tolerance for the arts.

 Contradictions and Law of Unity of Opposition
 The second controversy, although couched innocuously in terms
 of an {isoteric debate over whether there is any unity between thought
 and existence, and if so, which has primacy, has probably been of more
 significance for the immediate political scene because of its direct
 bearing on Mao's contradiction thesis, as well as on the intellectuals'
 acceptance of the philosophical foundations of Marxism.  The importance
 which the Chinese Communists themselves attach to this controversy is
 indicated by the fact that criticisms of the revisionists in this field
 have not only been voluminous in the intellectual periodicals since
 November 1959, but have also appeared twice in Hung-ch'i, with articles
 by Wang Jo-shui, the chief critic of the revisionists, in the 1 April
 and 1 June 1960 issues.
 In the 1 Jume issue, Wang presented the significance of the
 controversy by saying that the question "...is a problem that is not
 only of abstract theory, but one of very great practical significance.
 The materialist dialectical method is the Marxist view of the universe
 and the law of the unity of opposites is the most basic law of the
 materialist dialectical method.  The firm thorough materialist must
 recognize the universal existence of this law, that it is in application
 everywhere, that it is ever-lasting, that there are no exceptions to
 it....  In contrast to the dialectical method, metaphysics [the revi-
 sionists] has as its most basic viewpoint the denial of the-law of the
 unity of opposites, believing that where there is unity, there are no
 contradictions, and where there are contradictions, there is no unity,
 and that opposites cannot be studied into unity or unity into opposites....
 It can be seen then that the recognition or nonrecognition of the law of
 the unity of opposites is a pivotal problem for distinguishing between
 the dislectical method and metaphysics." (page 16)
 The primary revisionist in this controversy, Shih Ch'eng, was
 quoted by Wang as having written:  "A unity of a nature of contradictions
 between thought and existence cannot be acknowledged because the two.
 do not exist together in common in one entity under certain conditions
 and do not rely on each other or change in common under certain con-
 ditions...."  (page 16)
 According to Wang, Shih Ch'eng, in subsequent writings, was
 forced to speak of the application of the dialectical method to the
 relations between thought and existence, but he then claimed that the
 unity between thought and existence and the unity of the dialectical
 method are completely different and that "we cannot confuse the two."
 This Wang said, amounted to a denial of unity between thought and
 existence.

 A second revisionist in this controversy identified by Wang Jo-
 shui is Li Wei-i,.whom Wang accused of using a different formula to arrive
 at Shih Ch'eng's conclusions; Li said, NO must not, because of the most
 general law of the unity of opposites for all things, therefore call the
 particular and different opposites that we are studying, that is, the
 relations between thought and existence, '.Unity.'"  (page 17)
 A third revisionist is Hua Hsu-yu., whom Wang Jo-shui accused of
 even more directness when stating the revisionist position thus:  "We
 absolutely should not take abstract thought and force a dialectical unity
 with it onto actual existence."  (page .17)
 Wang wrote:  "The comrades who oppose the unity of thought and
 existence use the following logic:  'Thought and existence in the final
 analysis are different, are not the same'(Shih Ch'eng).   'Thought and
 existence are not the same thing, attribute or phenomenon., We cannot
 lump the two together and call them the same' (Li Wei-O."
 Wang's own position was that "existence is primary, thought
 secondary,...thought and existence constitute a unity of opposites."
 (page 17)  He further stated:  "We believe that the thorough materi-
 alist must acknowledge the unity of thought and existence, and that
 it is only by firmly recognizing the dialectical unity of thought and
 existence that we can unwaveringly maintain the materialist principle
 that 'existence is first and thought second."'  (page 18)
 The relevance of the controversy-to Mao's contradiction thesis
 is that the revisionist stand can logically be used as grounds for re-
 jecting the existence of internal contradictions and the role of con-
 tradictions as the motive power for the development of society.  The
 lead article, "Contradictions Are the Motive Power for the Development
 of Society," by Wu Chih-pu, in the 7 June. 1960 issue of Hsin Chien-she
 (page 1), presents a description of such rejectors which makes them
 almost indistinguishable from the revisionists in the controversy over
 thought and existence.  Wu said:
 "Some people do not believe that in a socialist society, in
 addition to contradictions between us an:4ithe enemy, there are internal
 contradictions of the people.  They even go so far as to believe that in
 the so-called atomic age, we can eliminate the boundaries between us
 and the enemy, that cats and rats can step together, even that there
 are no contradictions between us and the enemy.  Some people do not
 believe that in a socialist society, there is a mutually contradictory
 aspect as well as a mutually suited aspect to the relations between
 the, productive relationships and the productive forces and between
 the' superstructure and the economic base; that in addition to the

 Approved For Release 2000/09/14: CIA-RDP78-00915R001200120002-3
 mutually suited aspect, there is a mutually contradictory aspect..  They
 even go so far as to believe that in a socialist system, there are no
 contradictions which are not mutually suited and that it is not neces-
 sary to seek development from solving contradictions and from battle;
 that is, that in advancing toward Communism, we do not need to have
 excessive flying leaps or changes of a revolutionary nature.
 "On the problem of the motive power for the development of
 socialist society, some people believe that it is necessary only to
 have technology develop, to have the forces of production develop, and
 to have the level of the rate of production attain a certain degree;
 and that it is not necessary to have any innovations of the social
 system, not necessary to rely on the broad masses in carrying out the
 struggles along the economic, political, and ideological fronts, to
 enter into Communist society.  That is, we do not need to solve the
 contradictions of the social system and between man and man for it to
 be possible for society to develop.  Contradictions are no'.longer the
 motive power that pushes the wheel of society in continuous advance.
 They believe that it is only the solidarity and unity of the socialist
 society, its firmness like granite, that is the motive power for devel-
 opment.  This way of speaking violates the objective laws of social
 development and the teachings of Marxism-Leninism on uninterrupted
 revolution and dialectical meterialism.  This wrong way of speaking can
 cause the broad masses of socialist society to lose their direction and
 the socialist system to stop and not advance.  Therefore, the solving
 of the problem of what is the motive power for the development of
 socialist society is extremely important."
 In contrast to the stand of the revisionists, Wu Chih-pu quoted
 from Mao's contradiction thesis:  "The philosophy of Marxism recognizes
 that the law of the unity of opposites is the basic law of the universe.
 This law,, no matter in the natural world, in society, or in the thoughts
 of men, exists universally.... Contradictions exist universally."
 Party Reaction to Soviet-Chinese Controversy
 A survey of Harian Ra  at from 29 June 1960 to 15 July 1960, when
 the Djakarta war administration banned the paper for an, indefinite period,
 indicates that the PKI (Indonesian Communist Party) may have at least
 partially resolved the conflict between the "hard".or "pro-Chinese" line
 propounded by several party leaders in'late May and early June 1960 and
 the moderate views generally associated with Chairman of the Central

 Committee Aidit, which are more in harmony with the Soviet position.  The
 evidence is rather scanty, however; by the end of June 1960, the PKI,
 like its Chinese comrades, appeared reluctant to publish material dealing
 with contested ideological issues.  The only article observed during the
 period under review which deals directly with the PKI's attitude toward
 the ideological dispute between Peiping and Moscow is an editorial en-
 titled "War and Peace," in the 30 June 196c0 Harian Rak'at.  Its purpose
 is to announce that the PKI has rallied to the compromise line proclaimed
 in the Bucharest Communique.
 This editorial begins by accusing the."imperialists" of wanting
 "war'only, not peace."  The desire of the. peoples of the world for "peace
 only," it says, was clearly expressed in the recent Bucharest Communique,
 which is portrayed as a reaffirmation of the 1957 Moscow Declaration and
 the Peace Manifesto.  The editorial highlights the 1957 Declaration as
 follows:  "It stated that 'at present the forces of peace have developed
 to such an extent that there is a clear possibility for preventing war,'
 but it also warned that 'while imperialism :exists, there will be grounds
 for aggressive war' ...and it made clear that 'all nations must show the
 greatest possible vigilance toward the danger of war which is caused by
 imperialism."'  The editorial notes that the PKI expressed full support
 for the 1957 Declaration at its sixth national congress.  It also asserts
 that subsequent events further proved the validity of the theses expressed
 in both the Declaration and the Bucharest Communique, citing the PERI
 (Revolutionary Republic of Idonesia), Pope, and Karel Doorman affairs,
 as well as "imperialist obstinacy and defeats in South Korea, Turkey,
 and Japan" as evidence of this.  The editorial concludes with the fol-
 lowing formal injunction:  "If we wish to solve the problem of war and
 peace correctly, we must study and practice: the principles in the Decla-
 ration, the Peace Manifesto, and the Commun.que.T"
 On 8 July 1960, Harlan Rak'at publishe 3. the PKI's statement, which
 was a detailed end higbly_d_=    ysis of the failures of the   .seat Indonesian

 Federation of Labor Unions), and during July, according.to the press,
 that organization and its subsidiary unions were engaged in a vigorous
 campaign against the Minister of Labor.  Ilhe discussions in the press
 do not indicate whether or not the party's decision to apply increased
 pressure to the government in these ways and thereby attempt to force
 Communist participation in the cabinet was motivated by recent Chinese
 arguments for a more vigorous pursuit of the revolutionary struggle in
 countries such as Indonesia.  The theoretical implications of the PKI
 statement seem to indicate a continued pursuit of the middle road
 customarily followed by the party in the past.  For example, it contains
 a direct appeal to the national bourgeoisie to ally itself with the PKI

 against "the new bureaucratic bourgeoisie, which is trying to suppress
 both economic and political freedom."  It sharply criticizes Indonesia's
 approval. of the Yugoslav proposal for a little summit meeting of neu-
 tralist nations this attack was developed at length in a 12 July 1960
 Harlan Rakjat article by the PKI central committee foreign department),
 on the grounds that it would "sabotage the struggle against imperialism."
 It also viciously assails Foreign Minister Subandrio's policies toward
 "imperialism" in passage such as the following, but without exceeding the
 limits imposed at Bucharest:
 "The international situation is indeed very favorable for the demo-
 cratic and peace-loving forces.  Never has the American war policy been
 so isolated and become so rapidly bankrupt as it is today.
 "In this present international situation, especially in Asia, and
 in the present domestic situation, all of which is favorable to the
 democratic forces, the Indonesian people must not relax and lessen their
 vigilance in following the foreign policy now being pursued by the
 Indonesian Foreign Minister....
 "The, American imperialists will not stand idly by, but will seek
 opportunities to preserve and continue their aggressive schemes to
 plunge the world into a new war.  National vigilance must be further
 raised, and activities to smash the counterrevolutionaries, to oppose
 American imperialism, and to completely liquidate the survivals of
 colonialism must be intensified."
 In contrast to the large number of NCNA dispatches dealing with
 matters of policy which were carried in Harian Rakjat during most of
 June, only two articles of this type appeared in the  eriod surveyed.
 These were excerpts from a Soong Ch'ing-ling article (originally pub-
 lished in the 26 June 1960 Peking Review), which appeared in Hariem
 Rak at on 29 June, and coverage of a Mao-Tse-tung speech to a. Japanese
 cultural delegation in Shanghai, published in Harlan Rakjat on 6 July.
 Madame Soong's article indicated, if not a modification of the Chinese
 position on "the nature of imperialism," certainly a tendency to tone
 down the violence of its expression.  Similarly, Mao's statement,
 although strongly anti-imperialist, was not in any sense a defense of
 the Chinese line in Marxist-Leninist terms.
 With the decline in the. number of Chinese statements published in
 Harlan Rakjat during this period, the paper's coverage of the Soviet
 position increased sharply.  On 29 June 1960, ther was a brief article
 noting the signing of the Bucharest Communique, the full text of which
 appeared on 30 June.  The 29 June Harlan Rasjat also carried a fairly
 long Tass dispatch on Khrushchev's speech to the public meeting which

 concluded the Rumanian party congress.  This was the first time, in the
 paper's reporting of the recent ideological dispute, that remarks. by
 Khrushchev on Marxist-Leninist theory were observed.  From 4 to 11 July,
 Harian Rakjat published. four long articles, all Tass dispatches, detail-
 ing h'hrushchev's remarks during his Austrian tour.  On 11 July, it fea-
 tured Khrushchev's speech at the reception honoring First Minister
 Djuanda's visit to Moscow.  These articles contained no discussion of
 the issue at the ideological level.  On 15 July it published extensive
 excerpts from the general declaration issued by the Bureau of the World
 Peace Council at the close of its 9-11 July session in Stockholm.
 The following pattern emerges from   survey of Harian RakLat for
 the period 1 May-15 July.   The PKI did its best to ignore tfie Soviet-
 Chinese ideological controversy during May, until on 30 May, with the
 publication of an article by Sudisman, a member of the politburo, it
 initiated a vigorous presentation of the "Chinese line," whickk was
 also defended in articles by Tjoo Tik-tjoen and Ngadiman Hardjosubroto
 and in Achadijat's speech to the WFTU session in Peiping.  This speech
 was published in Harian Rakjat on 10 June 1960 and was the last Indonesian
 exposition of the  h rd"       observed in the press.  During the ensuing
 week, Harian Rakjat published NCNA dispatches reporting on statements by
 Chinese leaders; the last of these to be noted appeared on 16 June.  Dur-
 ing this period, the only presentations of the moderate line which bore
 on the issues in the Sino-Soviet controversy were a brief remark by
 Aidit in his speech on the anniversary of the Bandung conference; a
 two-part article by Politburo Member Sakirman, which appeared inHarian
 Rakjat on 9 and 10 June; and perhaps Aidi,as speech on the i-0th anniver-
 sary of the PKI; coverage of the Soviet line in Tass dispatches was
 almost entirely lacking.  As of mid-June, Harian Ra' s reporting was
 weighted in favor of the Chinese.
 The PKI then appeared again to enter. a period of indecision during
 which its organ generally ignored ideological questions.  The paper failed
 to print any passages dealing with Marxism-Leninism in its report on
 Khrushchev's speech to the Rumanian Party Congress.  However, following
 the congress and the resulting Bucharest Communique, the paper published
 the editorial "War and Peace" on 30 June and there was a sharp upswing
 inTass dispatches detailing Kh.rushchev'sremarks during the first 2
 weeks in July.  Nonetheless, Harlan Rak'a't's failure to reprint any of
 the detailed Soviet responses to the  hinese line, as well as the lack
 of 'any rebuttal by Indonesian party leaders themselves to their four
 comrades who had so clearly taken a Chinese view of the situation,
 would seem to indicate that these were little more than gestures and
 that the PKI remains strongly attracted to the Peiping line.

 Press Maintains Neutral Position on Sino-Soviet Differences
 The position of the regime in North Vietnam on Sino-Soviet differ-
 ences on peaceful coexistence seems again to be one of neutrality.  Dur-
 ing the period 23 June-15 July 1960, little partiality toward either
 Peiping or Moscow is evidenced in the press or in the statements of party
 leaders.  They seem almost to be closing their eyes to the existence of
 such a controversy.
 Four of the articles around which the dispute revolves appeared in
 the press during the period of this survey; however, where the full text
 was not printed, the North Vietnam press omitted the controversial parts
 and avoided. use of the wards. "revisionism" and "revisionist."
 The! articles covered were:  the full text of Khrushchev's speech at
 the Rumanian party congress; the full text of the communique issued by
 the parties attending that congress (this was printed in Nhan Dan on
 28 June and reprinted in the same paper on 9 July); a fu1Ttrans ation
 of the editorial from Jen-min Jih-pao on the Rumanian communique and,
 the 1957 Moscow declaration on revisionism; and excerpts from the
 speech made by Peng Chen, Politburo member of the Chinese Comm mist
 Party, at this congress.
 It could be of some significance that Nhan Dan devoted large sections
 of three issues, 23, 25, and 26 June, to the full text of'Khrushchev's
 speech while only three half columns on 24+ June were given to excerpts
 from Peng Chen's speech.  Also, the parts omitted from the'Vietnamese
 account of the latter were Peng's references to "modern revisionism"
 and to the great exploits and achievements of the Chinese people.
 The North Vietnamese stand of neutrality is well expressed in an
 editorial in the 28 June issue of Nhan Dan, which said:  "The Vietnamese
 Communists all fully agree with the-matters dealt with in.'the joint
 communique of the Bucharest'meeting.  We Vietnamese Communists realize
 that the strengthening of unity and unanimity among all Communist and
 Workers Parties in the socialist bloc and throughout the world is the
 primary task of all Marxist-Leninists in all countries.... We are elated
 at the unceasing consolidation of unity and agreement among our fraternal
 parties, and we are striving to contribute positively to the strengthening
 of this sacred unity and agreement."

 This idea of unity and desire for peace was again stated in-the DRY
 (Democratic Republic of Vietnam) government note to the Soviet government
 upholding the latter's stand on disarmament.  This note, published in the
 11 July issue of than Dan, declared:  "The DRV. government fully approves
 the Soviet decision to suspend its participation in-the conference of the
 ten-nation committee and to submit the disarmament question to the coming
 regular session of the UN General Assembly.   The DRV government emphatic-
 ally condemns the dishonesty of the US and other Western nations, approves
 the Soviet government's willingness to continue the disarmament talks,
 and believes that if future talks are to have good results, the partici-
 pation of a number of countries in addition to those already represented
 is necessary.  The DRV government believes that the attendance of the
 People's Republic of China is most essential."
 The stand of the North Vietnam regime was definitely set forth by
 Premier and Politburo member Pham Van Dong in his report to the first
 session of the Second National Assembly.  A large part of this report,
 which appeared in Nhan Dan on 8 July, was devoted to denunciation of
 the US and praise for the USSR for its "'constant efforts toward'world
 peace."  In his closing statement, Phaui Van Dong said:  "The people and
 government of the DRV have made constant; efforts to strengthen unity and
 agreement with all countries in the socialist bloc, headed by'the mighty
 Soviet Union, and at the same time to increase friendly relations with
 other countries of the world according to the five principles of peaceful
 coexistence in order to contribute to the maintenance and consolidation
 of world peace."
 Beyond this, he voiced support of the Soviet proposal that partici-
 pation in a summit conference should include such large Asian powers as
 China, India, and Indonesia, when he said.:  "The Vietnamese people would
 warmly appreciate the presence of the People's Republic of China at the
 summit conference.  In truth, it is unreasonable to ignore the 650 million
 Chinese people while trying to settle major problems of the world today.
 That is why, despite all attempts by t;helUS imperialists, who are reaction-
 ary and blind, to hide the sun with t ei                  hands, reason will triumph in
 international relations and the great People's Republic of China. Will
 occupy its well deserved position in the:-present international arena."

 Part 3.   EASTERN EUROPE
 Revisionist currents in Eastern Europe were reflected in discussions
 on art and literature, science and technology, and international problems.
 In art and literature, there were indications that Hungarian literary
 journals had not abandoned their earlier favorable treatment of modernist
 tendencies.  This was evident in, among other things, a survey of literary
 tastes of Hungarians, comment on the recent  "science-literature" debate
 in Literaturnaya Gazeta,_and a plea not to dictate to young writers..-  The
 East German theoretical journal characterized the author of an art history
 as being "very close to revisionist art theories"  and admitted that the
 ,revisionist influence of Gyorgy Lukacs was still prevalent  amont the coun-
 try's :literary intelligentsia.
 Discussions on science and technology featured a Hungarian counter-
 attack on the modernist line, in which the belief that natural science
 could :Pill the role of social factors was refuted. A similar line was fol-
 lowed in another antirevisionist attack, scoring "bourgeois and revisionist
 theories which make a fetish of technology."  The East German theoretical
 journa:L gave voice to regime concern that the country's natural scientists
 were harboring positivist views on science, denying in particular the
 applicability of dialectical materialism to modern physics.
 Internationally, the Hungarian theoretical journal, in approving the
 Soviet peaceful coexistence line and pointing to the ever-worsening condi-
 tion of imperialism, attacked such revisionist heresies as the concept of
 a "unified world process" leading to world socialism.  Segments of the
 East German scientific and artistic intelligentsia were denounced for "third-
 way" views on the solution of the German reunification problem. Yugoslavia
 answered a recent Soviet "quasi-ideological" attack on revisionism in the
 Yugoslav-v- economy and foreign policy.
 Reaction to West German SPD Theories; Revisionist Tendencies in Art, Lit-
 erature, Natural Science
 East German publications for some time have been vigorously combating
 various manifestations of the West German SPD (Social Democratic Party)
 "theory of the third way."  In addition, numerous dissident views on the
 popular level, in reaction to the collapse of the summit conference and de-
 teriorating economic situation in East Germany, have recently been reflected
 in the press.
 Excerpts from two articles on the question of German reunification
 which indicate this popular reaction follow.

 "...Among a part of the privateIy practicing medical and free-lance

 and a false evaluation of the character offthe West German state have be-
 come widespread.  These persons represent the viewpoint that both sides
 [East and West] in Germany must give in somewhat.  Other members of the

 Stadt SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany) management (Freie Pxesse,

 ...Among cooperative farmers who are:not party members in the
 Bezirk(Gera], the opinion is expressed in discussions that the question
 of Germany can be solved by taking a more for less middle line, that the
 question cannot be solved without both sidles giving in.  Behind this view
 is hidden (although it is not openly stated) the view expressed by the
 question, 'Who knows how things will eventually turn out?' [i.e., perhaps
 Communism will not win out].  The harmfulness of this view lies in the
 fact that it not only confuses people, butit also affects their work and
 the results. of such work.  It is,clear that those who approach the question
 of Germany in this way will not exert much; effort to  fulfill the plan....

 West Germany...." -- Albert Norden at the. Bezirk Gera SED delegates confer-
 ence (Volkswacht, 21 June 1960)
 In addition, there has been evidence of what could be termed revisionist
 tendencies in the fields of art and literature.  The following excerpts from
 the June 1960 issue of the East German theoretical journal, Einheit, denounce
 a recent book on art history.
 "Wolfgang Huett, in his book on art history, Wir and die Kunst (Art
 and Ourselves), published in 1959, suceeds in imparting much worthwhile
 information ... in an easily understandable fashion.  No one disputes the
 fact that an investigation of problems of artistic form, such as surface
 andline,...,color, and composition, is certainly necessary and is fre-
 quently very neglected in our art scholarship and criticism.  But Huett
 does not take adequate account of the function. ,o? art in society, the
 side of reality on which it should concentrate.  His treatment of formal
 problems [alone].. .results .in the fact that the content of a work of art
 .is excluded in his characterization.  Thisfact encourages those theories
 of bourgeois decadence which are concerned: only with artistic form but
 which eliminate the [concept of] content..,,.
 "As a result of this improper approach, Huett, in the first part of
 his 'book, arrives at all kinds of unsatisfe,ctory absoluce statements, but
 particularly the declaration that viewers should approach a work of art
 with an 'unprejudiced and open mind as much as possible."Such an atti-
 tude is, however, not at all possible..., because a work of art is always

 created under a very definite sociohistorical ideal by an artist with a
 very definite relationship to the world and because the viewer also ap-
 proaches art. . .from the vantage point of his own philosophy and experience
 in life.... No one approaches art with an open mind, because.,..certain

 art.  Huett's assertion bears neo-Kantian traits.  It could result in an
 'open-minded' attitude toward major works of decadent art, which, however,
 would mean approaching them uncritically, and in the end, justifying these
 works....,
 "The author does not attain ...a convincing clarification of the con-
 cepts on content and form in art.... Marxist art scholarship will not be
 able to progress one step forward if these general concepts are not clearly
 defined.  Huett essentially interprets [simply] those concepts which have
 already penetrated old bourgeois-academic scholarship; but the development
 of art changes and new concepts arise.... Thus, socialist painting-has
 long ago enlarged the concept of genre painting with sociopolitical themes...
 which are no longer included in the old concept of genre painting....
 "However, Huett has accomplished a great deal in presenting the first
 portrayal [in East Germany]...of early.'oriental, Egyptian, and classical
 art on the basis of historical materialism....
 "In. his book, Huett conceives of art as simply a reflection of reality,
 as a mere reflection of ideas and thoughts by a class.  But this alone does
 not cancel the old bourgeois... idea of the 'independence' of art history.
 A view which more or less ignores the essence of art as a particular means
 of knowing and ignores the very active function of art.. .cannot completely

 tion the importance of the masses' fight for artistic progress and it de-
 scribes the development of new art too simply....
 "Above all, Huett does not satisfactorily analyze the role of the...
 proletariat in the development of national art.  In a general characteri-
 zation of 19th Century art, he does not mention the working class even
 once.  In particular, the author does not take into account Lenin's teach-
 ing on the existence of two cultures in every bourgeois national culture....
 Huett simply says proletarian art 'grows out' of bourgeois art.  This asser-
 tion, along with his demand for an 'unprejudiced' acceptance of works of
 art, brings the author very close to revisionist art theories.   Huett also
 cannot clearly explain the essence... of socialist realism,...which has de-
 veloped by historical necessity in all countries in which the working class

 Huett does not clearly-show that the principles of socialist realism
 were necessarily and lawfully applied eves during the antifascist demo-
 cratic stage of GDR development:  He does not analyze West German art
 since the war and passes over the great national significance of pro-
 gressive art in the GDR....
 "Thus, Huett.'s book leaves a divided impression.... While it imparts
 much new information, it is oriented inadequately or even falsely toward
 basic questions.  The new edition must be .basically revised.  The defects
 of the work arise, however, not alone from the inadequacy of   the author;
 they are characteristic, to a large extent, of the situation in our art
 scholarship, particularly in theoretical research...."
 The party press (most recently the January 1960 issue of Einheit) has
 strongly indicated that of the revisionist influences of the 195Ta-1957
 period, those of Gyorgy Lukacs among the East German literary intelligentsia
 have been sustained more effectively than most others.  A long-range plan
 for bringing writers, as well as all other artists, into conformity with
 party aims was set forth at the April 1958 Bitterfeld  Conference, and
 the effects of this conference are now becoming more evident in the current
 movement of artists into factories, cooperative farms, mines, etc.  How-
 ever, there has been no indication that this movement has had an effect
 on literary theory at the university level.  In fact, the continued exist-
 ence of revisionist thinking was strongly implied when an Informationsbuero
 West item of 9 June 1960 reported that a conference "to strengthen to
 basis of Marxism Leninism in literary scholarship in the GDR" was scheduled
 for 24 and 2!i June 1960 in Leipzig.  The conference, which was to be pre-
 pared by the literature institute of the Karl-Marx University in Leipzig,
 was to "dispute all reactionary and unscientific theories and methodologies,
 including revisionism"; the agenda was to be based on the teachings of Lenin.
 The only East German published report on this conference noted thus far
 appeared in Leipziger Volkszeitung of 3 July 1960.  It said:
 "The main speaker at the conference,...sponsored by the literature
 institute of Karl.-Marx University... was DrJohn, head of the department
 of aesthetics in the Institute of Philosophy, who spoke on the meaning
 of Lenin's theory of reflection as applied to literary science.  In the
 discussion... young scholars disputed particularly the false ideas, in-
 citement, and unscientific features of the West German so-called 'East
 Research' in the field of literature.  But unfortunately the problems
 of Marxist literature propaganda were not as thoroughly discussed."
 The following are excerpts from Dr John's speech as reported in the
 article:
 "'It is characteristic for many forms 'of artistic reflection abased
 on Lenin's concept] in drama and the epics. in painting and sculpture, that
 an outer similarity [to the subject] exists: to a considerable extent.  On
 Approved For Re                   --     8-00915R001200120002-3

 this fact are based all the well-known attempts to define art as. an imi-
 tation of reality.  Many bourgeois and revisionist art theoreticians try,
 by using their inadequate knowledge of Lenin's theory of reflection, to
 make this fact absolute and to cancel the reflecting nature of such art
 forms as music.. .and architecture, as well as lyric poetry, by pointing
 to the fact that they lack an outer similarity [to reality].  The next
 thing they do is to completely deny [the theory of] reflection in the
 field of art.
 "'The dialectical-materialist thesis that art is a reflection of re-
 ality conceives the essence of art in a deeper and more complete way than
 that definition which often serve  the materialists of the past, namely,
 that art is an imitation of reality....
 ""In this connection, something should be,said on the relationship
 between truth and honesty.  Revisionists try to eliminate the question
 of truth by asserting that this deals with a "scientific-theoretical"
 category, and they further try to eliminate the question of artistic
 partisanship by asserting that this deals with a political motive.  In
 place of both of these, they offer as a kind of substitute, a highly
 abstract. . ."artistic honesty."
 "One must say that from the standpoint of Lenin's reflection theory,
 the question of truth, the question of whether we are dealing with a true
 or distorted reflection of reality, 1:nvt?ob1yC'"basr1c importance for science,
 but also. ..for all forms of `reflection, including art.  Every attempt to
 operate with an abstract concept of honesty is to be energetically refuted;
 an example of such attempts is the assertion that the artist, writer, or
 philosopher is honest who says and writes what he thinks and that such an
 "honest" person. will. dispense with the question of the quality of his
 thoughts and feelings.'"
 A further concern of the regime press, both recently and in the past,
 has centered on the suspicion that East German natural scientists hold
 what has been denounced as positivist views on science; particularly beliefs
 in the inapplicability of dialectical materialism to modern physics, espe-
 cially to quantum mechanics.  Articles in both the April and July,1960
 issues of Einheit were devoted to refuting these views as expressed by
 such Western scientists as Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr. (See Review
 of Communist Theoretical Journals (5).  However, speaking in general
 terms, the Jtily issue of Einheit said that "many scientists feel them-
 selbes drawn to positivism, because they think that it fights more consis-
 tently [than any other philosophy] against senseless speculations which
 make more difficult the progress of science.  They particularly. turn against
 the too narrow idea. patterns of mechanical materialism, the limits. of which
 are becoming more and more clear."

 The application of dialectical materialism to natural science was the
 purpose of a symposium which wag held for scientists and Marxist philoso-
 phers 8-11 October 1959 in Leipzig.  Despite this conference, which sought
 in general to impose greater doctrinal control over scientists, it appears
 from discussions in the press that natural scientists have been able to
 maintain a modicum of independence because of the situation arising from
 a shortage of scientific personnel in East Germany.
 II.  HUN3ARY
 Symptoms of Revisionism Continue
 Despite attacks on "modernism" which described it as a mask for every
 ideological sin from existentialism through narodnikism to Durrenmatt
 cosmoplite third-roadism ( see Communist Revisionism and Dissidence (2),
 the Hungarian literary journals have not abandoned their previous favorable
 treatment of modernist tendencies.
 The July 1960 issue of Na   ilag continued its modernist line and
 published a public opinion survey which supported it in this endeavor.  The
 top five foreign authors desired by Hungarians, in order of their popular-
 ity, were:  Durrenmatt, Sartre, Hemingway, Camus, and Sh:olokhov.  In addi-
 tion, Nagyvilag  undertook to explain Dudintsev's "A New Year:1-6 Tales
 "Dudintsev's story portrays the recovery of consciousness, the awakening
 to their tasks, of the intellectuals, living barrenly and vegetating
 amidst their magnificent scientific possibilities; and in the figure of
 the owl it presents one of'the important motifs of this awakening, one of
 the controlling problems of modern literature and of modern thought: Time."
 The "Time" symbol was again used in a poem in the 8 July 1960 Elet es
 Ir?dalom; "Do not suffocate in Time,". warned Tamas Nador in a poem titled
 "Love    As with Dudintsev's owl, Time isboth a threat and a promise, a
 sign of possible victory, but a taskmaster which demands that the intellec-
 tuals act in the present.  This does not at all subtract from the divine
 nature of Time noted in the "Revisionist; Elan" article in Communist Revi~-.
 sionism and Dissidence (1);  "Fear God and keep his commandments" was the
 preacher's final word in a world of vanity.
 Comment on the "science-literature" debate in the Moscow Literaturnaya
 Gaz,eta appeared in the 15 July 1960 Elet es Irodalom in an article by Pal
 E.-Feher, who noted Marietta Saginyan's proposal that Koziryev's time
 theory be exploited for artistic purposes:

 T     7
 Another interesting comment on the Sq'iiet literary scene appeared in
 an article in the 8 July 1960 Elet es Irodalom, in which the editor of
 Nagyvilla  gave unstinted praise to Tvardovbkiy's "Distance Beyond, Distance,"
 noting that Tvardovskiy had again offered a helping hand to his people in
 "a moment of trial" -- the trial being their attempt to go forward from
 Stalinism.
 In its 22 July 1960 issue, the editor of Elet es 'Irodalom, Miklos
 Szabolcsi,'took up a more direct defense of his own modernist-policies and
 cautioned against dictating to the young writers; "We must not force our
 youth into an outmoded schema or into rigid rules; we want to see from
 them that courage and freshness, that bold exposure of truth which is now
 beginning to develop in Soviet literature and which is now again taking
 to the road in Western progressive literature."
 But the modernist line is not going unchallenged.  The rigid party
 line literary monthly Tiszataj, published in Szeged, devoted considerable
 space in its May 1960 issue to a refutation of ideas linked with the
 term "atomic era":  "The words 'atomic era'...give rise to a belief that
 a special branch of natural science can fill the role of social factors."
 On the! contrary, the journal argues, social factors are primary, and a
 study of science cannot replace a study of dialectical materialism.  In
 the course of this exposition, the Tiszataj authors created for themselves
 a good. bit of confusion as to what constituted superstructure and what
 constituted base.  They promised to publish more on this subject, but they
 did not do so in June or July. (See Eastern Europe Press Surveys (113-115)
 for a more complete treatment of the above articles on the literary debate
 in Hungary.)
 July, however, saw a massive attack on revisionist heresies by the
 party theoretical journal Tarsadalmi Szemle.  In an unsigned article titled
 "Concerning Several Problems of the Struggle Being Waged for Peace and
 Socialism," which gave total approval to the peaceful coexistence line of
 the Soviet Union and pointed to the "ever worsening condition. of imperialism,"
 it attacked such revisionist heresies as:  "the reformist illusion being
 spread about 'organized capitalism'"; "theories-which say that the capi-
 talist state has become a 'suprasocietal' force, that monopoly capitalism,
 of itself, in a spontaneous manner, is transforming itself into socialism";
 and the revisionist contention that there is "some sort of 'unified world
 process' which allegedly leads to world socialism."  Although these are
 Yugoslav or Social Democrat heresies, Tarsadalmi Szemle's attack might be
 considered evidence of some revisionist Hungarian sympathy for them.
 This article also takes up, very gingerly, the problem of the effect
 of technological development on the formation of history.  With an eye to
 both Chinese and revisionist objections the article argues:  "Nor can the
 Marxists, who recognize the ruling role of productive forces in the devel-
 opment of society, underestimate the significance and effect of technology --

 including the military arts.... Nor can anyone say.:.that military arts
 in themselves. are the.effective factor independent of social classes and
 systems.... Marxists should reject those bourgeois and revisionist theories
 which make a fetish of technology and spread the erroneous belief that the
 development of technology makes superfluous social changes, the socialist
 revolution.  However, in the avoiding of war this is not what is involved...."
 The party line must deny that China can have a Communist superstructure
 without an adequate base, and it must also deny that any country can de-
 velop socialism, "spontaneously," as a result of changes in the base and
 without aid from the superstructural Soviet state.  The party line on
 superstructure and base is being strained to its limits, and revisionist
 arguments about the "atomic era" should find fertile ground.  (For full
 text of the Tarsadalmi Szemle article, see Eastern Europe Press Survey (116).
 III.  YUGOSTAV:IA
 Yugoslavs Refute Allegations in Soviet Article
 Yugoslav Communist are quick to answer any attack on Yugoslavia
 particularly  on the basis of revisionism published in the socialist camp.
 The latest such article appears in the party's Belgrade weekly, Kommnist,
 on 9 June, in rebuttal of an anti-Yugoslav  article in the Soviet Kommunist
 of 22'May.  It sums up the Soviet artic:le!as a "well-known mixture of
 quasi-ideological positions which are riot'worth discussing (since our
 'critics'  neither wish nor donduct a principled ideological discussion)
 and political insinuations calculated to compromise.Yugoslavia."  The
 attacks on the economic and social progress of Yugoslavia and on its for-
 eign policy, it says, "are intended to belittle the successes and to con-
 ceal them from the Soviet public and the public of the socialist camp."
 Correcting what they term erroneous'rassertions concerning the Yugoslav
 economy, the editors stress that Yugoslavy "have always rejoiced over suc-
 cesses in other socialist countries."  in their opinion, "the incorrect
 picture din the Soviet article] of the situation in Yugoslavia is apparently
 necessary to show the public of the socialist countries as picturesquely
 as possible the fatal consequences of 'Yugoslav revisionism' and (as the
 entire article clearly shows) the impossibility of building socialism out-
 side the socialist csmp."
 The dditors hold that the criticism of Yugoslav foreign policy has the
 same purpose; that is, to show that "socialism cannot be built outside the
 framework of the socialist camp and that socialism and the socialist camp
 are synonymous."  Much is made of the point that Yugoslavia has offered ac-
 tive support to all the constructive proposals of the Soviet Union concerning

 peace.  The distortion of Yugoslav foreign policy is primarily for domestic
 consumption, say the editors, for "how would it look'if the reader learned
 that Yugoslavia not only supports every constructive proposal of the Soviet
 Union but also has initiated many ideas and proposals which the Soviet gov-
 ernment:.-later adopted?"
 It is stressed that the underlying theme of the discussion of "Yugoslav
 revisionism" in the field of international relations is that "'who is not
 with us on every single point is'against us."  Followed to its logical con-
 clusion, the editors say, this.'would mean that-".everything socialist
 necessarily belongs in one camp and everything else in the other."- In
 this connection, the editors quickly point out that  It is not difficult
 to guess how countries which do not belong-to";any bloc feel about such
 an attitude."                          .
 In answer to the charge that Yugoslav leaders have "leadership" am-
 bitions at the international level, the editors submit, that "this hue and
 cry is not against the danger of some Yugoslav pretensions to ideological
 --monopoly, but rather against the unreadiness of Yugoslav Communists to
 submit to any such monopoly."

 Part 4.  WESTERN EUROPE
 DENMARK
 Danish Dissident Communists Criticize Bucharest Declaration
 Two things are clear concerning the ideological conflicts in the
 Communist world movement, writes K. M., 4 regular ebntributor, under
 the heading of "Peaceful Coexistence and' Oracular Language. Out of
 Bucharest," in the 8 July 1960 issue of SF, official weekly organ of
 Danish dissident Communist Aksel Larsen's Socialist People's Party.
 One is that quite profound differences of opinion on vital issues un-
 questionably exist; the other, that in the current, aggravated inter-
 national situation, the most serious effort is devoted to finding a
 common denominator in the evaluation of the main features of the inter-
 national situation.  Outwardly, he notes,: efforts are made to.avoid an
 ideological debate and to. maintain the semblance of ideologically. uni-
 form, "conflict-less" parties, a closely knit bloc of socialist states
 with a common approach to all the varied problems of the changing world
 and without ideological differences on l:3asic principles -- "a relic of
 the undialectical method of the Stalin er4, a departure from the tra-
 dition Of classic Marxism."
 K. M. charges that the search for a common denominator was the main
 preoccupation of the Communist Party representatives from all socialist
 countries who met in Bucharest in connection with the Congress of the
 Rumanian Workers Party.  They evaded the issues" he says, and their approach
 to the "burning and controversial question" of the feasibility of peace-
 .ful coexistence of countries with different social and political systems
 was based not on an analysis of the immediate situation, but on the
 Declaration of Principles and the Peace Manifesto of the 1957 Conference
 of Communist Parties in Moscow.  These K. M. says, quoting from the
 Bucharest communique, they found "completely valid in the present situation."
 This statement, K. M. points out, is conspicuous for what it leaves
 unsaid, for what it evades; namely, the effect of modern atomic weapons on

 tion process" in the Western World notwithstanding.  "The thesis of the
 possibility of preventing war in our time is preserved, but it is as if
 greater weight is attributed to the danger of an imperialist aggressive
 war because of the continued existence of ;capitalism -- a typical feat of
 balance between, to put it mildly, Nikita thrushchev?t- and Mao Tse-tung's
 slightly differently shaded conceptions of the main feature of our age."

 With reference to peaceful or nonpeaceful transition to socialism,
 K. M. asserts, concrete analysis is again evaded and, in an effort to
 "join the sundered," the "oracular language" of the Bucharest pronouncement
 reaffirms; the possibility of the peaceful road to socialism, but-adds that
 it may also be necessary to envisage victory by nonpeaceful means; "they
 completely neglect even to conjecture where and under what economic, social,
 and political circumstances the probabilities indicate one or the other
 form of transition, whether under a bourgeois democracy in an industrially
 highly developed country with a strong socialist labor movement; under
 colonial, underdeveloped barbarism; or under a fascist, reactionary dic-
 tatorship."
 Does this ambiguous language which gives no clear answer to the
 ideol?gical debate of the times, he asks, mean that realistic clarity
 would expose ideological conflicts which might prove insurmountable?
 II.  FRANCE
 Unified Socialist Party of France Attacked by Communist Official
 An attack on the  lack of unity of the Unified Socialist Party (PSU)'
 on political or philosophical ideology, its anti-Communism, its attitude
 toward the USSR and the People.ls Democracies and toward Communist-Socialist
 unity of action, was contained in an article entitled "Dogmatism and
 Chatter" by Francois Billouc,. member of the Politburo of the French Com-
 munist Party (PCF), in its weekly Paris organ France Nouvelle of 3 August
 1960.  The PSU includes Tribune de Communisme (Tribune of Communism) and
 other dissident Communist and Socialist groups.
 Billoux began with a general attack on the PSU, its official weekly
 Tribune du Socialisme, and France Observateur and L'Express, all of which,
 he wrote, "continue to develop, under various forms, the theses of certain
 militants and tendencies of that party."  He used the phrase "certain ten-
 dencies," he said, because "one of the characteristics of the PSU is that
 it is composed of people with very diverse political and philosophical
 concepts," who refuse to allow the party to be founded on a "unity of
 thought, a common ideology, especially Marxist theory."  He claimed that
 each member of the PSU has his own ideas about socialism, and that many
 members do not believe socialism has anything to do with the "science of
 laws which regulate the development of society."  They term as "dogmatic"
 everything that relates to the basic positions of Marxism-Leninism, he
 sneered, and issued the countercharge that the PSU itself is dogmatic
 because it refuses'to acknowledge the existence of a socialist and an
 imperialist; camp in the world.

 After asserting that the PSU leaders hurt not only themselves but
 also the working class and the democratic movement with.their refusal to
 admit that there is a scientific basis tothe development of society,
 Billoux singled out an article by Jean Verlhac, "The Day of 28 June and
 Its Lessons," in the 9 July 1960 issue of Tribune du Socialisme,  to show
 that the PSU "ritualistically" accuses the PCF of dogmatism, asserting
 that it tries to prove its charge by quoting out of context, by presenting
 "fantastic" interpretations, and by repeating cliches.  Billoux particu-
 larly criticized Verlhac for his contention that the PCF does not consider
 the'Algerian war the main problem facing France today.  The PCF has always
 fought for the right of the Algerian people to self-determination and, for
 an 'end to the war, he wrote, but the Communists believe that it is the
 monopolies, not the Algerian war, which determine France's policy today.
 Billoux further criticized Verlhac for dwelling on the "necessary
 coordination of activities" but refusing to accept the Communist theory
 of Communist-Socialist unity of action.  ''Only those who are not sure of
 their arguments and the correctness of their proposals can be afraid of
 submitting them to a decision of the masses,"  wrote Billoux.  Renunciation
 of a Communist-Socialist united front, hecontended, impedes the advance-
 ment of the Socialist workers.
 In addition to criticizing Verlhac's!position on Communist-Socialist
 unity of action "for the restoration and renovation of democracy," one
 of the PCF's main current propaganda lines, Billoux took him to task for
 his position on peaceful coexistence.  The PSU leaders, like the SFIO
 (French Socialist Party) leaders, he claimed, do not consider the USSR and
 the People's Democracies as socialist countries.  They Judge the policies
 of those countries in the same way that they judge the policies of the
 capitalist countries, he said.  They denylthe existence of a socialist
 camp and a peace camp larger than a socialist camp, as well as the exist-
 ence of an imperialist camp.                 Gilles Martinet's similar position on the
 two. camps was also denounced by Billoux.s whb asserted that one cannot be
 opposed to one camp without serving the other. 'The Communists have chosen
 to fight for peaceful coexistence and competition between the two camps,
 he said "not only through a praiseworthy; desire,"'but also because hence-
 forth "war is avoidable."  He repeated the current Soviet-supported theory
 that war is no longer inevitable, but added, "neither is peace.  An unending
 fight must be carried on by the peoples tp impose it...."
 Billoux also criticized former Prenier Mendes-France, a PSU member,
 particularly because of his record on Algeria, claiming that if the former
 Premier has changed his stand on Algeria ~.t,is because of united action
 on the part of the people.
 Billoux concluded his article by strongly urging joint Communist-
 Socialist action which "remains a major trump for the triumph of a peace
 policy, liberty, and social progress."

 1.  New Italian Revisionist Monthly Attacks PCI and PCF
 The Italian revisionist monthly Corrispondenza Socialista which
 appeared in the first issue of March 1960, replaced the weekly news-
 paper of the same title published by.Eugenio Reale for some 20,000
 Italian ex-Communists.  The new magazine, a self-styled "review of
 political criticism and documentation," is a source of revisionist
 essays which severely. criticize the Italian Communist Party (Pc) and
 the Soviet system.  Two appeared in the March issue:  "The Ninth Con-
 gress of the PCI," by Antonio d'Ambrosio, and "Dogmatism and Revision-
 ism in German Social Democracy," by Paolo Rossi.  The May issue blamed
 the Communist Party of France (PCF) for ignoring salient facts concern-
 ing the Communist dissidents who have joined the new Unified Socialist
 Party of France.
 In his report on the Ninth Congress of the PCI, d'Ambrosio scored
 the party, its directors, its secretary-general  Palmiro Togliatti, and
 the Soviet system in 18 columns analyzing the congress under the fol-
 lowing ten subheadings:   (1) Relaxati"on According to the PCI; (2) Ex-
 pectation of Economic Depression; (3) Atomic War and Rights of Peoples;
 (4+) Communism and the Soviet Army; (5) Ambiguity; (6) Monopolies and
 Middle. Classes; (7) The Peasants; (8) Workers Conditions; (9) Interna-
 tional Policy; and (10) Relaxation.  In essence, d'Ambrosio said that
 the Ninth Congress indulged in much useless talk and did not make the
 least effort to change the basic aspects of the party program, but only
 masked itself  to condition the. Italian executive branch of government
 so that the party might enter the cabinet, drive out the other parties
 one by one, and seize unlimited power; that for this great act of decep-
 tion the PCI would rely on the incautious good faith of other political
 parties and movements with poor memories.  ItaliannCommunists, said
 d'Ambrosio, cannot become democrats unless they revise their program and
 review critically the history of the international Communist movement,
 which is exactly what they do not dare to do and what the present direc-
 tors of the party will never consent to have done by others.
 From the economic, political, and social viewpoints, certain descrip-
 tions of domestic conditions and certain comparisons made by Togliatti and
 other party directors between conditions in Italy and those in the Soviet
 Orbit were variously labeled by author d'Ambrosio as made in bad faith or
 as shortsighted.  The author ridiculed Togliatti for one such comparison,
 relating specifically to wages in Italy and the USSR, by referring to a
 contradictory report on the same subject by Luigi Longo, deputy secretary-
 general of the PCI.

 The Ninth Congress was convinced that Communist power is about to'
 become dominant, and yet the party is afraid to look outside itself; it
 tries to fit the facts of Italian existence to Lenin's old design, and
 therefore there is constant worry in party circles over any attempt to
 inquire, anger at heresy, and hate for revisionism, d'Ambrosio wrote.
 The height of self-deceit is reached in portraying splendid relationships
 between various Communist governments and colonial peoples, he noted.
 Speaking more assertively for revisionisto, he denied the fatal nature
 of economic depression and its inseparability from the capitalist system,
 and stated that the "imperialist nature of Italian capitalism" broadcast
 by ,Italian Communists is a gross exaggeration.  The Ninth Congress attacked
 Italian private monopolies in a manner which proved ignorance of their real
 nature, d'Ambrosio noted, because, in his: opinion, a Soviet-type economy
 is ,the ultimate monopoly, killing private; entrepreneurs who resist social-
 izstion under a Communist regime but promising through the PCI that anyone
 in ,Italy may own and run his own businesswhen the PCI comes to executive
 power, a promise made in bad faith.  This congress failed to clarify the
 PCI's relationship to the USSR; in fact, paid revisionist d'Ambrosio,
 Italian Communist leaders have not yet stopped talking about the "merits"
 of Joseph Stalin.
 The congress held its sessions in chilling boredom except for the
 ovation given to Hungarian delegate Marosan, according to d'Ambrosio, who
 saw in this welcome an a priori approval of the execution of 150 young
 Hungarians for their part in the Revolution of 1956, regardless of the
 horror expressed in the Free World press on the day before the cheers for
 Morosan.
 In the article titled "Dogmatism and' Revisionism in German Social
 Democracy," Rossi castigated the resistance of Communism to every revi-
 sionist movement: and its antipathy to and suspicion of Communists who
 would re-examine Marxism-Leninism in the light of new conditions.  As a
 corollary to this theme of Communist resistance to social democracy in
 West Germany, Rossi charged that the Italian Socialist Party, led by
 Pietro Nenni, has made some weak efforts to separate itself from PCI in-
 fluence, but that it still accepts the dogmatic spirit and theological
 method of the PCI.
 In the May issue of Corrispondenza Socialista, Roberto Macchi berated
 the French Communist Party in connection with Tribune of Communism, dissi-
 dent Communist component of the new Unified Socialist Party (PSU) of France.
 Macchi remarked that the PCF carefully avoided praise of the new Unified
 Socialists, and that the former's reservations were evident between the
 lines of the official PCF daily 1'Humanite.  For example, he said, l'Humanite
 did not mention the presence of the Tito delegation, or the speech by
 Perovtich, a member of the central committee of the Yugoslav League of
 Communists, at the PSU's founding congress.  The newspaper also omitted the
 names of recent Communist Party dissidents who now represent Tribune of

 Communism on the national committee of the PSU, including Jean Poperon,
 who in 1957 wrote for,Cahiers du  Communisme, PCF theoretical Journal.
 Among the founders of Me PSU who are not controlled from the Kremlin
 is Laurent Schwarz, professor at the Sorbonne and chairman of the
 Maurice Audin Committee, Macchi pointed out.
 2.  Revisionist Giolitti Edits Book on Communism in Europe
 Antonio Giolitti, former Italian Communist deputy to Parliament and
 now an Italian Socialist Party (PSI) deputy, has edited II Comunismo in
 Europa (Communism in Europe), a compilation of official documents of the
 in ernational Communist movement, excerpted writings of 14 Communist
 authors, and his own introduction and comment.  The PSI daily Avanti'! of
 Rome reviewed Giolitti's latest politicoliterary effort in its issue of
 27 July 1960 over the signature of Luciano Vasconi.  The reviewer said
 that Giolitti essentially examined the period from 1945 to the present,
 and that the Communist writers represented are Dimitrov, Gomulka, Kardelj,
 Khrushchev, Lenin, Malenkov, Manuilskiy, Nagy, Stalin, Thorez, Tito,
 Togliatti, Trotskiy, and Zhdanov.
 The newspaper review of II Comunismo in Europa quoted from Giolitti's
 introduction, in which he translated the Italian Communist usage of I'du-.
 plicity*"  as meaning "the contradictory coexistence of two policies and
 two outlooks."  According to Giolitti, the contradictions which have
 ,appeared in recent years between various Communist movements, such as the
 Chinese! and Soviet, concerning world relaxation and. a long-lasting peace
 are not the result of different degrees of maturity, but seem to reflect
 a deep and perhaps unresolvable conflict between Communist strategy and
 tactics.  Communist strategy, Giolitti wrote, is directed toward the
 conquest of power by any means, whereas its tactics are aimed at under-
 standing`whatever has appeared valid in the legacy from the old world.
 Reviewer Vasconi reported that in an article published in Rinascita,
 theoretical journal of the Italian Communist Party, party leader Togliatti,
 writing; as "Roderigo," refuted Giolitti's interpretation of Communist
 strategic and tactical contradiction and attempted to correct Giolitti's
 phrase "provisional alignment"iby substituting "transitional alignment."
 Giolitti made an assessment of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the
 review said, measuring its ideological limitation in terms of the
 "bigoted formula" of the "personality cult."  He characterized the
 secret report as "more important than the public one," and thus detoured
 "onto a false road the criticism of Stalinism, obstructing the process
 of revisionism which had just begun."  According to the review, Giolitti
 continued, "That formula was to act as a lightning rod to attract to
 'personality' all the critical charge irhich necessarily struck at the
 system, and thus absorb and neutralize it."  He suggested instead that

 "the more convincing and compelling way" ;was "a criticism of Stalinism
 which would not have hesitated to go back to its deepest and most
 tenacious ideological roots, would have dad the courage to avoid just-
 ification in historic dialectic, and would have filled the fearful gap
 between means and ends, politics and truth:"
 For Giolitti, the review said,Ahe two faces of Communism are not
 clear to itself:  The choice between the Soviet model, and national
 roads to Communism; and, within the party, the fact that war Communism
 and a policy of broad consumption are at odds.
