THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDIA AND THE SINO-SOVIET DISPUTE 
This is a working paper, the second in a series of ESAU 
studies assessing the effects of the Sino-Soviet dispute on 
certain key Communist parties. The paper tries to show how 
the development of a broad Sino-Soviet conflict in recent 
years has fostered pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese factionalism 
which now threatens to split the Indian party. 
The preparation of this paper has been greatly aided by 
the cooperation and assistance of several other analysts, 
especially  of the Asian-African Division of the 
Free World Area of OCI, Allen Whiting of the Special Studies 
Group of the Department of State, and .the analysts of the 
Radio Propaganda Branch of FBIS. The first two chapters of 
the paper also reflect a debt to the work of Kautsky (Moscow 
and the Communist Party of India, New York, 1956). Overstreet 
and Windmiller (Communism in India, Berkeley, 1959), and 
Masani (The Communist Party of India, New York, 1954). We 
alone, however, bear responsibility for the conclusions 
reached in this paper. 
The Sino-Soviet Studies Group would welcome comment on 
this paper, addressed to Harry Gelman, who wrote the paper,

THE INDIAN COMMUNIST PARTY AND THE SINO-SOVIET DISPUTE 
Summary 
By January 1962 the Communist Party of India (CPI) had 
reached a point at which an open schism in the party in the 
coming year had become a serious possibility. The renewal 
of the Sino-Soviet conflict at the 22nd CPSU Congress had 
greatly worsened an already tense situation within the In-
dian party, and strengthened forces which for many years 
had been working toward a split in the CPI: the growth of 
unprecedented factionalism and indiscipline, the weakening 
of the authority of the party center at the hands of defiant 
provincial party committees, the slow decline in the authority 
of the CPSU for many reasons and the growth of Chinese party 
prestige in the eyes of many CPI members, and the steady pol-
arization of leftist and rightist Indian party factions along 
pro-Chinese and pro-Soviet lines. 
This process had received its initial impetus during the 
internal CPI battle between 1947 and 1951 over the methods 
of struggle the party should follow, the immediate goal it 
should pursue, and the classes it should admit into its alli-
ance. At that time the left-faction leader Ranadive took 
control of the CPI as general secretary, and in conformity 
with what he thought was CPSU policy he led the Indian party 
in the application of violent insurrectionary tactics against 
the Nehru government. Modeling his efforts on the Russian 
revolution, Ranadive gave primary emphasis to the struggle in 
the cities rather than in the countryside; and he called for 
a one-stage revolution to overthrow both the imperialist 
enemy and the Indian bourgeoisie simultaneously and bring 
about immediate Communist party rule in India. Ranadive's 
tactics failed dismally, and were disastrous for the party. 
Opposition to Ranadive rose throughout the CPI, and he at-
tempted to suppress it ruthlessly, increasing the chaos with-
in the party. 
The leaders of the Andhra provincial party committee 
then came forward and attacked Ranadive's line; citing a

relatively successful peasant revolt which had been going on 
for some time in the Telengana district of south India, they 
called for the party to abandon insurrection in the cities 
and to rely instead upon armed struggle in the countryside. 
They also demanded that the CPI ally itself for this purpose 
with anti-feudal sections of the well-to-do peasantry, as 
well as with anti-imperialist sections of the urban bourgeoisie 
(the "national bourgeoisie"). Therefore they wished the party 
to aim at a two-stage revolution in which efforts would be 
directed first at ousting from power the agents of imperialism 
and feudalism, and only later at securing firm Communist con-
trol of the Indian government. The Andhra leaders explicitly 
stated that the Chinese revolution rather than the Russian 
revolution was their model, and they fervently hailed Mao Tse-
tung as their inspiration and guide. 
Ranadive responded with public attacks not only upon the 
Andhra leadership but also upon Mao; Ranadive attempted to 
portray Mao's advocacy of alliance with the national bourgeoisie 
as an anti-Marxist betrayal of the revolution and an attempt 
to restore capitalism. There is evidence, suggesting that 
Ranadive- was encouraged to do this by signs of serious strain 
between Mao and Stalin at the time the CCP was coming to power 
in 1948 and 1949. Eventually, however, the CPSU accepted 
the desirability of the alliance with the national bourgeoisie 
and the two-stage revolution, and Ranadive fell from power 
in the CPI, to be replaced by the Andhra leadership. The 
Andhra leaders publicly apologized to Mao for Ranadive's at-
tacks, and attempted to apply the line they had advocated. 
Peasant revolt, however, proved no more successful than urban 
insurrection, and armed'struggle was finally abandoned alto-
gether, with the Andhra group in turn replaced by a new lead-
ership headed by Ajoy Ghosh as general secretary. 
Two lasing results flowed from these events. First, al-
though the "Chinese path" had not proven entirely applicable 
to India, a degree of Chinese influence was implanted and per-
manently legitimized within the CPI as a source of inspiration 
and guidance second only to the CPSU. Secondly, the faction-
alism, blatant indiscipline, and regional disregard for central 
authority which had grown during the struggle against Ranadive 
became permanent features of CPI life, to a degree seen in 
hardly any other Communist party. The authority of the central 
CPI machinery was henceforth so weakened in relation to the

provincial party organizations that never again did the central 
party leadership make a serious attempt to enforce a uniform, 
rigid line upon the often defiant provinces. 
� The most important feature of the next few years (1951-
55) for the CPI was the gradually softening Soviet attitude 
toward Nehru. By slow degreethe Indian party was forced to 
follow the evolution of Soviet policy in agreeing first that 
there were some positive aspects to Nehru's generally black 
foreign policy, then that Nehru's foreign policy was generally 
good but that his domestic policy was bad, and finally that 
there were favorable features of his domestic policy as well. 
The CPI had to be bludgeoned by Moscow and its agents in the 
central CPI leadership into taking each painful step along 
this path, usually with a considerable time lag behind the 
development of Soviet policy; each such gradual modification 
of line toward Nehru was accomplished only over the strenuous 
objections of a large section of the Indian party which did 
not wish what it regarded as opportunities--to advance the 
cause of Communis-i in India by opposing Nehru--to be sacrificed 
for the sake of Soviet foreign policy interests. Such CPI 
recalcitrance was reflected in the party program adopted in 
1951, and then was strongly manifested at the Third CPI Con-
gress at Madurai in December 1953. However, the Soviet move-
ment away from hostility to Nehru, begun cautiously three 
years before Stalin's death, accelerated greatly thereafter 
in the Bandung period of 1954 and 1955, when Nehru exchanged 
visits with the Soviet and Chinese leaders and the USSR began 
a program of economic assistance to India. Under the impact 
of these events, the CPI became increasingly bound to a moder-
ate policy involving reliance upon parliamentary elections. 
This trend was to receive its greatest development after the 
20th CPSU Congress in 1956. 
By the time of Stalin's death, any serious divergence 
between Chinese and Soviet policy toward the "national libera-
tion movement" would seem to have disappeared, and Moscow and 
Peiping appear to have acted in close coordination in foster-
ing warmer relations with Nehru in 1954 and 1955. However, 
the relative importance of the Chinese party and the Chinese 
revolution as a guide to Asia--which the CCP had stubbornly 
upheld during Stalin's lifetime--was inevitably increased as 
a result of his death, a fact reflected during this period in 
statements byboth Soviet and Chinese leaders.

Maw 
The 20th Congress of the CPSU in February 1956 and the 
events which flowed from it administered a series of funda-
mental shocks to the CPI with results which were to affect 
greatly the relationship of the Indian party to Moscow and 
to Peiping down to the present day. The first and most im-
portant of these shocks was that of deStalinization, which 
on the one hand greatly intensified the spirit of cynicism, 
the internal disorganization, and the personal indiscipline 
already widespread because of the party's previous history, 
and on the other hand greatly accelerated the long-term de-
cline in the authority and prestige of the CPSU which had be-
gun with the death of Stalin, while simultaneously enhancing 
the appeal of the CCP to those sections of the Indian party 
sympathetic to Peiping's viewpoint. This development was 
followed by the Soviet.suppression of the Hungarian Revolution 
and the subsequent execution of Nagy, which weakened the CPSU's 
position among rightist sections of the party. A third dif-
ficulty was meanwhile occasioned by the 20th Congress line on 
peaceful transition to socialism, and particularly by the 
extreme interpretation of that line as applied to India pro-
vided by an authoritative Soviet article in the summer of 
1956 which implied that Nehru, and not the CPI, would lead 
India into the socialist system. This viewpoint was directly 
challenged in public by general secretary Ghosh, and the CPSU 
soon retreated to a more orthodox position--which, however, 
still enjoined CPI support for Nehru and CPI reliance primarily 
upon parliamentary tactics. Forces in the Indian party favor-
ing the parliamentary path were strengthened by the party's 
accession to power through elections in the state of Kerala 
in April 1957; and the CPI moved from the April 1956 line of 
the Palghat party congress (where the party cautiously acknowl-
edged the possibility of peaceful transition to socialism 
through parliamentary means backed by mass movements, and an-
nounced its intention to explore this possibility by conduct-
ing itself as a parliamentary opposition) to the April 1958 
line of the Amritsar Congress (which exuded confidence that 
the parliamentary takeover in Kerala could be repeated in other 
Indian states and eventually even in the center). 
eanwhile, by the fall of 1956 the first indications be-
gan to appear of growing divergence between the Chinese and 
Soviet parties over how far the soft line toward the national 
bourgeoisie of Asian countries should be pursued. Chinese 
objections on this score, originally suggested at the time of

gkoith 
the Eighth CCP Congress in September 1956, were reinforced as 
the Indian Communist party became increasingly committed to 
the parliamentary line in the wake of the Kerala election. 
Chinese comments began to be heard in 1958 concerning the 
pernicious effect the Kerala Ministry was having on the mili-
tancy and Marxist orthodoxy of the CPI. At the same time 
the left wing of the Indian party led by the Andhra, West 
Bengal,Iand Punjab organizations, infuriated at the restric-
tions and inhibitions which were imposed upon the party as 
a whole by the need to preserve the Kerala government in power, 
became more and more inclined to regard the long-respected 
Chinese party as a source of inspiration more congenial to its 
interests than Moscow. 
At the end of 1958 there was a momentary hardening of the 
Soviet line toward Nehru, occasioned primarily by the campaign 
being conducted by the Congress Party and other forces in 
Kerala to oust the Communist government. This firmer Soviet 
attitude was exemplified by an article by Yudin in Problems  
of Peace and Socialism rebutting Nehru's attack on Communists 
as addicted to violence; Yudin's article placed the onus for 
any possible violence on bourgeois resistance to a peaceful 
transfer of power to the Communist party. 
This Soviet shift in emphasis proved to be temporary, how-
ever, and in 1959 the polarization of the CPI between a moder-
ate pro-Soviet wing and a militant pro-Chinese wing was to in-
crease greatly. In 1959 the CPI for the first time became 
gravely affected by the growing differences between the Soviet 
and Chinese postures toward the "imperialist" world', their at-
titudes toward the ruling national bourgeoisie of underdeveloped 
countries, and their views on the most appropriate means of 
Communist assumption of power. The gap between the CPSU and 
the CCP on each of these issues, which had been alternately 
expanding and contracting in previous years, suddenly widened 
greatly. This was partly the result of events over which 
neither party had control: the Tibetan revolt, Nehru's deci-
sion to oust the Communist government in Kerala, Washington's 
decision to invite Khrushchev to the United States. It was 
also, however, the result of a conscious turning to the right 
by the CPSU and to the left by the CCP. On Moscow's side, 
there was an apparent decision taken in January 1959 to abandon 
the stronger tone used toward Nehru in the fall of 1958 and 
to bear with this bourgeois nationalist leader for a consider-
able distance. This resulted first in peremptory CPSU restraint

of the CPI upon the occasion of Nehru's ouster of the Kerala 
government, and later in the Soviet adoption of a publicly 
neutral posture toward the Sino-Indian border dispute (a 
posture bitterly resented by the CC?), as well as in vigorous 
Soviet efforts to convince Nehru of Soviet friendship as the 
border dispute developed. On the Chinese side, there was in-
stead a hardening of attitude toward Nehru at the very beginning 
of the year, which helped to determine Peiping's later response 
to events in Kerala and to the border dispute. At the same 
time, Khrushchev in the fall of 1959 adopted the softest line 
toward the West generally he had ever publicly voiced in the 
aftermath of his visit to the United States, while Peiping 
grew increasingly shrill in its warnings against Western treach-
ery and in contradiction of the Soviet line. 
Against this background of increasingly divergent policies, 
the CC? in 1959 for the first time began to make aggressive 
efforts to promote its viewpoint among sympathetic sections 
of the CPI, particularly within the militant West Bengal pro-
vincial party organization. At the same time Ranadive and the 
other leftists in the party apparatus were drawn increasingly 
into an identification with and defense of Peiping's position 
in the border dispute, while right-faction leaders throughout 
the party became increasingly inclined to conciliate Indian 
nationalist opinion by supporting the Nehru government's stand 
and condemning Peiping. 
In 1960 the Soviet and Chinese parties came into open and 
repeated conflict, and this conflict was transformed into an 
organizational struggle within the world Communist movement 
in which both sides eventually found themselves appealing to 
the loyalties of the key leaders of each of the principal Com-
munist parties of the world. Although the CPSU, because of 
its fears of precipitating a formal schism in the Indian party, 
for a long time left the CPI out of its efforts to mobilize 
foreign Communist support against Peiping--and even attempted 
to continue to deny to the CPI the reality of the Sino-Soviet 
dispute--the Indian party eventually had to be drawn into that 
dispute if only because bloc policy toward India was one of 
the key matters at issue between Moscow and Peiping. CPI rep-
resentatives took part in the Sino-Soviet confrontations which 
took place in Peiping and Bucharest in June, in Hanoi in Septem-
ber, and in Moscow in October and November. The Indian party 
was formally apprised of the Soviet position in a CPSU letter

to the party center in August, and was given a Chinese reply 
more indirectly through West Bengal channels the next month. 
Under the impact of these events, the rightist CPI leaders 
pressed an offensive against leftist-faction positions, which 
they were anxious to idelltify clearly with CCP resistance to 
CPSU authority; the leftists in the central party machinery, 
for their part, were anxious to deny their own estrangement 
from the CPSU by denying as long as they could the reality of 
Sino-Soviet differences. When a clearcut choice was finally 
posed in September, vacillating and opportunistic CPI leaders 
(the majority) swung to the rightist side identified with the 
CPSU, and the CPI passed a secret resolution attacking Peiping 
and supporting Moscow. Passage of this resolution was resisted 
by the leftist CPI national leaders, however, and was bitterly 
denounced by left-faction representatives in the provinces 
throughout India. One important provincial party organization, 
in West Bengal, went so far as to pass a counter-resolution 
directly attacking the conduct of the CPSU and Khrushchev by 
name and supporting Peiping--the only such resolution definitely 
known to have been passed in any Communist party in the world. 
While the delegation led by Ghosh to Moscow supported Khrushchev 
on most issues during the November conference of Communist 
parties, it did not support his demand for a condemnation of 
factionalism within the Communist movement (implicitly, Chinese 
factionalism) because of the grave danger that such action 
would split the CPI. Khrushchev's eventual retreat at that 
conference on this crucial issue of discipline within the in-
ternational movement--together with the inclusion of many Chi-
nese positions in the ambiguous document produced by the con-
ference--served to encourage the CPI leftists generally and 
to leave those of them who had openly defied the CPSU unrebuked 
and more firmly entrenched than before. 
The year 1960 ended with the left faction of the CPI con-
tinuing to report to the Chinese party and to receive guidance 
from it, while gathering strength throughout India for an as-
sault on the central party machinery in 1961. There was a 
gradual increase in leftist strength and assertiveness through-
out the Indian party before the party congress met in April 
1961, and Suslov, the CPSU delegate to that congress, was obliged 
to counsel Ghosh to make substantial concessions to the left-
ists on the wording of the party's political resolution--in 
order to preserve Ghosh in office as general secretary and to 
prevent a threatened open split in the party (which nevertheless

came
came very near to materializing). There is good evidence, how-
ever, that the CPSU and Ghosh themselves favored a balanced 
line including both support and criticism of aspects of Nehru's 
foreign and domestic policies, and a long-term strategy of 
building a national democratic front through cooperation with 
"progressive" Congress Party leaders to achieve limited non-
socialist reforms as a prelude to the gradual Communist as-
sumption of power. Suslov did not have to contend with direct 
Chinese competition at the CPI Congress, the prospective CCP 
representatives having been ordered to leave India beforehand 
by the New Delhi government. 
While the new National Council elected by the Congress 
had a reduced rightist majority--because of the leftists' 
threat to break up the party unless their wishes were acceded 
to--the rightists subsequently used this National Council 
majority to reverse leftist control of the Central Executive 
Committee and the Central Secretariat, the two top party organs 
charged with running the party. When Ghosh led a balanced 
CPI delegation to the 22nd CPSU Congress in October, however, 
even moderates who were normally staunch CPSU supporters were 
shaken by the open attacks there on the Albanian leaders and 
the renewed assault on Stalin. Ghosh indicated his reserva-
tions about Khrushchev's course of action by declining to at-
tack Albania in his speech to the CPSU Congress--like a number 
of other normally pro-CPSU foreign delegates--although two 
months later, again like the leaders of some other parties, 
he belatedly added- mild public disapproval of the Albanians. 
Greater turmoil resulted within the CPI as a consequence of 
this CPSU Congress than had ever existed before, both because 
of the new CPSU offensive against Albania and the CCP and be-
cause of the attacks on Stalin and the displacement of Stalin's 
body. There were widespread attacks on Moscow and Khrushchev 
over these actions within all factions of the CPI, and one pro-
vincial party organization--that of Andhra Pradesh--passed a 
resolution condemning the CPSU, the second such resolution to 
be passed within the CPI in little more than a year. Ghosh 
eventually published an article publicly regretting the manner 
in which Moscow had again embarked on deStalinization, and de-
claring that the CPSU had forfeited its claim to infallibility. 
These internal difficulties of the CPI were greatly aug-
mented by the simultaneous rekindling of the Sino-Indian bor-
der dispute, a statement by Ghosh strongly attacking the CPR, 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
and a subsequent People's Daily editorial condemning both Nehru 
and Ghosh. At the close of 1961, both leftist and rightist CPI 
leaders were warning of the likelihood of an open split in the 
Indian party after the. elections of February 1962. While it 
seemed likely that the CPSU would make every effort again to 
prevent such a split, Moscow's long-term chances of success 
in this effort were dependent on such factors as the future 
course of Sino-Soviet relations, the fortunes of the "peaceful 
coexistence" line, and..the number of concessions Moscow was 
willing to make again to the CPI leftists. The Soviet problem 
was further complicated by the death of Ghosh in January 1962, 
and the lack of a suitable successor combining loyalty to the 
CPSU with acceptability to both wings of the Indian party.

I. PROLOGUE: CPI STRUGGLE OVER THE FOUR-CLASS 
ALLIANCE (1947-1951) 
The gradual growth of Peiping's influence and prestige 
within large sections of the Indian Communist party as a 
guide secondary to the CPSU has apparently been known and 
tolerated by the Soviet party for the better part of the 
last decade. It was this long-term Chinese "presence" in 
the CPI which in 1959 and 1960--when Peiping began openly 
to challenge Soviet authority within the Communist move-
ment on a world-wide scale--was to combine with the faction-
alism and astonishing indiscipline of the Indian party to 
produce a threat to CPSU primacy which endures to this day. 
Both factors--the legitimization of a degree of perma-
nent Chinese influence, and the growth of factionalism and 
regional disregard for central authority to a point seen in 
hardly any other Communist party--had their origin* in the 
internal party struggle between 1947 and 1951 over the 
methods of struggle the party should follow, the immediate 
goal it should pursue, and the classes it should admit into 
its alliance. Many of the positions espoused at that time 
by individual CPI leaders--not to mention the CPSU and the 
CCP--have since been altered or even reversed. But there 
have been lasting effects from certain developmerits of that 
time: that the central CPI authority attempted to apply a 
certain line, in conformity with what it thought was CPSU 
policy; that this line proved disastrous for the Indian 
party; that other leaders openly proposed another line, 
which they specifically acknowledged to have been derived 
from Chinese teachings rather than from Moscow; that the 
central leadership reacted with violent denunciations of 
heresy, with suppression, expulsions, and similar methods 
*This is not to say that factional strife and respect for 
the Chinese party had not existed in the CPI before this period, 
but only that an enormous qualitative change occured on both 
counts after this time, which Indian Communists have themselves 
remarked on.

to enforce its line on the party; that the central leadership 
also published a direct attack on the Chinese party as the 
source of this Indian heresy; that rebel CPI leaders in the 
center and in one important provincial organization neverthe-
less continued to defy the leadership; that Moscow eventually 
accepted certain elements of the Peiping line and forced them 
upon the Indian party; and that the old CPI leadership was re-
moved and temporarily disgraced. While this was not the en-
tire story (Moscow first and the CPI later concluded that the 
"Chinese path" was not entirely applicable to India, and the 
discredited CPI leaders were eventually readmitted to a cen-
tral leadership coalition of all factions), nevertheless two 
effects have persevered: on the one hand, considerable respect 
for the wisdom and authority of the Chinese party were im-
planted permanently within the CPI; and on the other hand, the 
authority of the central CPI machinery was so weakened in re-
lation to the provincial party organizations that never again 
has the central party leadership made a serious attempt to en-
force a uniform, rigid line upon the often defiant provinces. 
A. Soviet Shift to Militant Line (1947) 
These events were set in motion for the CPI by the Soviet 
decision in 1947 to discard the rightist, united front-from-
above line enjoining support for bourgeois governments which 
the CPSU had required of the world Communist movement after 
the USSR's entry into World War II. The CPSU now ordered a 
general shift to a militant strategy of violent opposition to 
bourgeois governments, general strikes, demonstrations, armed 
resistance, and, in colonial areas, "wars of liberation." The 
first authoritative signal for this shift was given in Zhdanov's 
report to the founding meeting of the Cominform in September 
1947; but because Zhdanov dealt explicitly only with Europe, 
nowhere in this report did he indicate clearly whether or not 
the alliance which was to carry out the armed struggle in 
colonial countries against imperialist ::rulers could include 
sections of the native bourgeoisie which might be anti-imperi-
alist (the "national bourgeoisie") or sections of the native 
peasantry which were not impoverished but which might be anti-
feudal (the "middle" and "rich" peasantry). That Stalin in 
1947 had not made up his mind on this question was indicated 
by the conflicting interpretations provided by authoritative 
Soviet speakers at the proceedings of a meeting of the Soviet

Academy of Sciences on India in June 1947 which anticipated 
the Soviet switch to the militant line, and in articles by 
the same experts in December amplifying Zhdanov's thesis.* 
The Chinese Communist Party, on the other hand, adopted 
a clear position on these ambiguous Soviet statements. On 
25 December 1947 Mao Tse-tung delivered a report to the CCP 
central committee setting forth a line which was principally 
intended for the contemporary Chinese scene but which was 
also implied to be valid for other Agian parties. Mao con-
demned "ultra-left" policies toward the petty and "middle" 
bourgeoisie, explicitly setforth the immediate aims of his 
"New Democratic" revolution as the elimination of feudalism 
and monopoly capitalism rather than capitalism in general, 
and then added a call for "all anti-imperialist forces" of 
the various Eastern countries to unite to oppose imperialism 
and the reactionaries as he had defined them--by implication, 
therefore, to aim at a two-stage revolution (first anti-imperi-
alist and democratic, and only later socialist), and to use 
a four-class alliance (proletariat, peasantry, petty bourgeoisie, 
and national bourgeoisie) against imperialism and the pro-
imperialist sections of the bourgeoisie. 
Although the Cominform organ For A Lasting Peace, For A  
People's Democracy published a summary of this Mao report, it 
omitted all mention of Mao's demand for the initial retention 
of capitalism and the alliance with the middle bourgeoisie, 
thus effectively obscuring Mao's central point. The CCP line 
on this issue was restated more forcefully and explicitly, 
however, the following year, in a passage in Liu Shao-chi's 
article "Nationalism and Internationalism," written in con-
nection with the bloc break with-Yugoslavia. While warning 
the Communists of colonial and semi-colonial countries--in-
cluding India--to beware of "national betrayal by the reac-
tionary section of the bourgeoisie" which had already surrend-
ered to imperialism, Liu insisted that the Communists "should 
enter into an anti-imperialist alliance with%that section of

the national bourgeoisie which is still opposing imperialism." 
He added that "should the Communists fail to do so in earnest, 
should they on the contrary oppose or reject such an alliance", 
this would be a "serious mistake." Although this article was 
written in November 1948, it was not published in Soviet media 
until the following June, when the CPSU showed many signs of 
having finally accepted the line of an alliance with the national 
bourgeoisie. In the meantime, throughout 1948 authoritative 
Soviet writers had continued to take ambivalent or contradic-
tory positions on this issue, and it seems likely that this 
CPSU indecision was one of the reasons for Moscow's long delay 
in publishing Liu's article.* 
B. Ranadive Rise to Power in CPI 
Meanwhile, even as Mao spoke in December 1947 a shift 
was occuring within the Indian Communist party which was bring-
ing into control a faction which interpreted Zhdanov's September 
directive simplistically, not only assuming it to be a call 
for armed struggle against the Nehru government but also seeing 
it as a demand for a limited worker-peasant alliance against 
all sections of the Indian bourgeoisie to bring about a one-
stage revolution overthrowing capitalism and ushering in so-
cialism. This shift took place at a December 1947 CPI central 
committee meeting in which the balance of power within the 
party swung away from P. C. Joshi--the old CPI general secretary 
who had led the party since the middle thirties, and who had 
advocated support for the new Nehru government--toward B. T. 
Ranadive, who has since to this day remained at least the 
titular leader of the CPI leftist faction. The central commit-
tee adopted a resolution making no distinction between sections 
of the Indian bourgeoisie, and lumping all of the bourgeoisie 
with imperialism and feudalism as the enemy to be fought now. 
This line was confirmed and developed three months later 
at the Second Congress of the CPI in February 1948, when Ranadive 
*Another reason, presumably, was Liu's insufficiently harsh 
attitude toward Tito.

atifilaFT 
formally replaced Joshi as general secretary. The Political 
Thesis adopted by this congress identified the entire world 
bourgeoisie with the imperialist camp as the common enemy in 
every country; explicitly rejected the notion of significant 
differences among the bourgeoisie; called for a united front 
from below (to entice away the proletarian following of the 
Congress party) rather than a united front from above (which 
would have meant the Joshi line of alliances with and support 
for Congress party leaders); held'that-a revolutionary situa-
tion now existed in India, and called for a violent effort to 
bring about a one-stage revolution. This party congress was 
held in Calcutta immediately upon the conclusion of an inter-
national youth congress there sponsored jointly by the World 
Federation of Democratic Youth and the International UniOn of 
Students which is believed to have given the signal for the 
armed Communist uprisings which soon afterward began in a 
number of other Asian countries. 
Following the Second Congress, Ranadive proceeded to apply 
insurrectionary tactics against the Nehru government; in so' 
doing he sought to adhere to the model of the Russian revolu-
tion and to rely primarily upon struggle in the cities rather 
than in the countryside. There were attempts at massive 
paralyzing strikes, violent demonstrations, acid-throwings, 
and so on, and many party leaders went underground. The Nehru 
government responded with a vigorous crackdown against the 
party which effectively anticipated and countered these meas-
ures and placed much of the party's top leadership in prison. 
Meanwhile, the CPI's violent tactics steadily reduced the num-
ber of effective party members, decimated the fronts, and 
rapidly eliminated the party's influence over the masses; calls 
for strikes were heeded less and less, and eventually, as Rana-
dive's opponents later charged, the party was reduced to spon-
soring acts of "individual terrorism" by tiny groups of die-
hard militants. 
Andhra Citation of Mao as Guide: While this was going 
on, Communist leaders in the Telegnana district of the south-
ern Indian princely state of Hyderabad (which had not yet been 
incorporated into India) had for three years been leading a 
relatively successful revolt among the local peasantry by rely-
ing upon a radical program of land reform. The contrast between 
the success of this effort and the failure of Ranadives tac-
tics encouraged the Andhra provincial committee--to which the

Telengana party leaders were subordinated--to circulate with-
in the party in June 1948 a document challenging Ranadive's 
line and calling for a line combining agrarian revolt with 
Communist alliance with the national bourgeoisie and all 
strata of the peasantry. The Andhra leaders explicitly ac-
knowledged that they were inspired to adopt this line by the 
experience of the Chinese revolution, and not by what they 
termed "classical Russian revolution." They declared that 
"Mao, the leader of the historic Chinese liberation struggle, 
from his unique and rich experience and study, has formulated 
a theory of new democracy" which was a "new form of revolu-
tionary struggle to advance toward socialism in colonies and 
semi-colonies" and which was something "distinct from the 
dictatorship of the proletariat." An essential aspect of this 
Maoist line which the Indian party should copy, they felt, was 
the limitation of the struggle in the present stage to one 
against imperialism and feudalism, and the consequent forma-
tion of a broad alliance with the anti-imperialist "middle 
bourgeoisie" of the cities, as well as the "middle peasantry" 
and (if possible) even the "rich peasantry" of the country-
side. The Andhra party committee cited as the justification 
for this line a statement by Mao on 24 April 1945 to the 7th 
CCP Congress, in which Mao complained that "some people cannot 
understand why the Communist Party of China, far from being 
unsympathetic to capitalism, actually promotes its develop-
ment," and explained that "what China does not want is 
foreign imperialism and native feudalism and not native capi-
talism which is too weak." 
Ranadive Attack on Mao: While neither Mao nor the Andhra 
Communists had in mind either the indefinite retention of 
capitalism or the abdication of Communist leadership, and while 
there is no good evidence that the Andhra party in hailing Mao 
as a model consciously intended to reject CPSU authority, 
Ranadive for polemical purposes chose to profess these conclu-
sions in the counteroffensive he made to the Andhra document. 
In his first response, in the CPI journal Communist of January 
1949, Ranadive contented himself with defending his line of 
a single revolution leading directly to socialism, led by the 
proletariat in firm allinace only with the poor peasantry and 
the rural proletariat, and with suggesting that the battle 
against the Indian bourgeoisie was even more important than 
the struggle against foreign imperialism. In July 1949, how-
ever, he wrote an article in the same journal which directly 
assailed not only the Andhra document but its ideological 
-6 
SMAT

inspiration, Mao Tse-tung. In this article Ranadive emphasized 
that the CPI accepted only Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin as 
authoritative sources of Marxism, and not Mao, whom he impli-
citly compared with Tito and Browder. He delcared that "some 
of Mao's formulations are such that no Communist party can ac-
cept them; they are in contradiction to the world understand-
ing of the Communist parties." Citing the 1945 Mao quotation 
from the Andhra document, he termed the formulation aboUt the 
CCP promoting the development of capitalism "horrifying," 
"reactionary," and "counterrevolutionary," and in hypocritical 
fashion interpreted Mao literally, asking: "Are we to under-
stand that while Communists in Europe, the USSR, and India 
fight world capitalism, the CCP proposes to rebuild it in 
China?" 
Joshi subsequently claimed that eighteen months before 
Ranadive expressed these views publicly he had disseminated 
them in private oral discussions within the CPI on the eve of 
the February 1948 CPI Congress. Ranadive at that time had 
reportedly declared that Mao's "New Democracy" was reeking 
with reformism and that the Chinese revolution would not be 
consolidated and directed towards socialism until its leader-
ship revised its views or was made to revise them. Ranadive 
was also said to have predicted that a "whole pack of reform-
ists" who had got control of certain other Communist parties 
after the wartime dissolution of the Cominform would soon be 
ousted. In a February 1949 article in Communist, Ranadive 
indeed made public similar vague charges of revisionism 
against the leaderships of unspecified European Communist 
parties. 
For Ranadive to pass from these private charges of vague 
public allusions to his direct public attack on Mao in July 
1949, however, was a remarkable act, particularly in view of 
the fact that the CCP at that moment was in the process of 
consolidating its conquest of mainland China, while the CPI

was a tiny and hopelessly defeated remnant of a party. De-
spite Ranadive's undoubted personal fanaticism and irrespon-
sibility, it seems likely that he must have had what he con-
sidered good evidence of strong friction between Stalin and 
the CCP to justify his action.* 
There are two known items of evidence dating from late 
1948 and early 1949 which do suggest that at the very time 
when the CCP was coming to power in China, Stalin was experi-
encing particular difficulty in adjusting himself to the 
heightened status of Mao and the Chinese party within the in-
ternational movement which was the inevitable consequence of 
this event. First, the British Communist Palme Dutt, in a 
report to a Conference on the Crisis of British Imperialism 
on 2 October 1948, listed five new features of the post-World 
War II "national liberation movement". According to the ver-
sion of Dutt's report published in Britain, the second of 
these points declared: "The advance of democratic China rep-
resents a powerful force in the world situation which exer-
cises a profound influence on the development of the libera-
tion struggle of the colonial peoples throughout Asia." The 
version published in the Cominform journal on 15 October, how-
ever, listed only four features; the point about China was 
omitted. 
Anna Louise Strong Book: A more dramatic piece of evi-
dence--and a reason why the CPSU at this time may have been 
unwilling to publish the seemingly innocuous statement above, 
which in subsequent years has been repeated many times by 
Moscow--was provided by the case of Anna Louise Strong and 
her book, "Tomorrow's China." This book, based on a year's

direct instructions by the CPSU to attack Mao, this ,seems un-
likely, if only because--as will be seen--by the time Rana-
dive wrote in July 1949 the CPSU had already accepted the 
particular Maoist doctrine which was the central object of 
Ranadive's assault. It appears more likely that Ranadive 
used earlier broad indications of Sino-Soviet difficulties 
as justification for attack on the authority cited by his 
internal party opponents.

stay in China from July 1946 to July 1947 and on repeated 
conversations with the top CCP leaders, was published by the 
Communist press of many countries late in 1948 and early in 
1949. In India, it was published by the CPI's People's Pub-
lishing House of Bombay in the fall of 1948 under the title 
"Dawn Out of China." In this work Miss Strong paid repeated 
tribute to the experience and authority of the Chinese Com-
munist party and Mao and the particular and unique relevance 
of Mao's teachings to the revolutions of Asia. She even went 
so far as to state explicitly that "it is to Mao Tse-tung and 
to Communist China much more than to present-day Moscow that 
the nationalist revolutions of Indonesia, Indo-China, Burma, 
look for their latest, most practical ideas," and that Mao's 
strategy was made to fit such peoples because China's problems 
are similar to theirs. Mao's analysis of China's revolution, 
she said, "is studied eagerly in the colonial lands of South-
east Asia;" and she thought that "Marxists all over the world 
agree that in order to understand the modern problems of Asia, 
it is necessary to study Mao's thought," since Mao was the 
"first Marxist in Asia" to succeed in applying Marxist prin-
ciples to new conditions and in giving those principles a new 
development. 
One aspect of the Maoist teachings thus lauded by this 
book is the "New Democracy" line calling for an alliance With 
the middle bourgeoisie and preservation of some native capi-
talism for the sake of the common struggle against imperial-
ism and its adherents. In a later private conversation, Anna 
Louise Strong stated that in her last interview with Mao in 
1947, she declared her intention to bring this Maoist line for 
the anti-imperialist struggle to the attention of other Asian 
Communist parties; thereupon, according to her account, Mao 
interrupted her to urge that she bring it to the attention of 
the Russians as well. In fact, after her book had already 
been published by a number of Communist parties, she did visit 
the Soviet Union in an effort to get the work published there, 
and appears to have been naively surprised at the insistence 
of the Moscow publishing house that drastic changes be made 
in the text. Finally, she was arrested in Moscow in February 
in 1949, charged with espionage, and subsequently expelled 
from the country. Her old friend Borodin, who had attempted 
to help her in dealing with the Moscow publishers, was also 
arrested and later died in prison.

The fact of Anna Louise Strong's arrest by the Soviet 
authorities a few months after the appearance of her book 
hailing Mao was likely to have been seized on by Ranadive as 
evidence. of Stalin's attitude toward both Mao's pretensions 
and Maoist policy. Thus encouraged, Ranadive and his lieu-
tenants in the party center persisted in leading the party on 
in its violent course despite the disastrous effects this was 
having, and despite the growing opposition to the Ranadive 
line not only from the Andhra committee but also from the 
party trade union leaders led by S. A. Dange. Too deeply com-
mitted to his line to draw back, Ranadive attempted to apply 
Stalinist methods of suppression within the CPI, arbitrarily 
dissolving rebellious local party committees and expelling 
dissidents on a wide scale, and thereby compounding the chaos 
throughout the party. 
C. CPSU Shift Toward Broad Alliance�, Away from Armed Struggle  
One of Ranadive's opponents who was first suspended from 
the party and then, in December 1949, expelled, was the former 
CPI general secretary P. C. Joshi. Joshi responded pugnacious-
ly to his explusion by launching a one-man campaign against 
Ranadive, sending a long letter to Stalin and to other foreign 
parties documenting Ranadive's departure from Soviet intentions, 
and publishing these and other documents in a journal founded 
specially for the purpose. Joshi was aided in this effort by 
the fact that CPSU policy doubts had apparently been resolved 
by mid-summer 1949 in favor of the line of the four-class al-
liance and the two-stage revolution. In early June Pravda fir. 
nallypublished the text of Liu Shao-chi's "Internationalism 
and Nationalism"; this fact was cited by Joshi* as having been 
*Joshi's writings in this period were replete with polemical 
defenses of the Chinese leaders against Ranadive's attacks; 
and Joshi in subsequent years became known as the CPI leader 
most closely identified with Peiping. Joshi's adherence to 
the alliance with the Indian national bourgeoisie, however, 
outlived the eventual passing of Peiping's fondness for this 
line; and Joshi was finally forced, most reluctantly, to sup-
port the CPSU against the CCP when the Sino-Soviet conflict 
surfaced in 1960.

ignored by Ranadive when publishing his attack on Mao. Also 
in June 1949, reports delivered at an important meeting held 
by the USSR Academy of Sciences upheld both armed peasant 
struggles and the participation of the national bourgeoisie 
in the anti-imperialist alliance in colonial countries; and 
the same line was taken in a collection of papers published 
by the Soviet Pacific Institute later in 1949. 
Soviet Subordination of Chinese Experience: In addition, 
one of the latter papers published by the Pacific Institute 
now described the Chinese revolution as having profited "from 
the tremendous experience of the CPSU", as having "creatively 
applied the teachings of Lenin and Stalin" under conditions 
of a semi-colonial country, and as constituting for this rea-
son "a vast treasury of revolutionary experience itself" for 
colonial peoples of the East to draw upon. This attempt to 
subordinate the significance of Mao's thinking was reiterated 
in a Soviet message on the founding of the CPR published in 
Pravda on 6 October 1949, in which the CCP was depicted as 
having won its victory by "basing itself" on Stalin's "analysis 
of the...conditions for a victory of an anti-imperialist and 
anti-feudal revolution." It thus seems that the CPSU, finally 
convinced of the expediency of Mao's four-class strategy for 
the revolutions of Asian parties--and also confronted by Mao's 
victory with the necessity of defining the CCP's relation to 
those revolutibns--attempted to resolve both problems by adopt-
ing this Maoist line and depicting it, and all Chinese experi-
ence, as derived from Stalinist teachings. 
The CCP seems never to have accepted this distinctly sub-
ordinate niche for Mao, although Mao in March and July 1949 
did perform the ritual of acknowledging Chinese successes to 
have been made possible by the Soviet victories in World War 
II. At the November 1949 WFTU Peiping Conference of Asian and 
Australasian Countries which formally ratified the Maoist 
strategy as suitable for the Asian parties, Liu Shao-chi de-
clared, without any obeisance to Soviet experience or teach-
ings, that "the path taken by the Chinese people...is the path 
that should be taken by the peoples of the various /NCNA Eng-
lish/ colonial and semi-colonial countries in their fight for 
national independence and people's democracy."* (Emphasis sup-
plied.)

mentioned only in passing in this speech; and Liu alluded to 
the European satellites as "the new democracies."

The Question of the Suitability of Armed Struggle: This 
"Chinese path" was defined by Liu as a broad united front, in-
cluding the national bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie but 
based on the worker-peasant alliance and resolutely dominated 
by the Communist party--plus a national army led by the party 
waging armed struggles from bases in the countryside while con-
ducting only "legal and illegal mass struggles" in the cities.* 
(Emphasis supplied.) Although LiTraid insert certain qualifi-
cations�declaring that this "way of Mao Tse-tung" should be 
followed in other countries "where similar conditions prevail," 
that an army should be set up "wherever and whenever possible," 
and that armed struggle is the main form of struggle of, "many" 
colonies and semi-colonies--the main thrust of his argument 
was in the opposite direction, implying that the Chinese felt 
that armed struggle on their model was indeed well-nigh uni-
versally suitable in Asia. 
The CPSU has since intimated that at the time it was not 
in complete agreement with the CCP on this point, implying that 
the Soviet party, while finally accepting Mao's doctrine of 
a four-class alliance in colonial countries, may also have 
been just beginning to consider abandoning armed struggles in 
certain countries where they had proven inexpedient, and that 
the CPSU may therefore have been reluctant to commit all the 
Asian WFTU organizations to a line suggesting that violent 
tactics were still generally suitable. While there is no 
conclusive evidence, certain of Liu's statements have .a highly 
polemical flavor which lends some credence to this. He said 
*Li Li-san, a former CCP leader who in 1930 had been in-
strumental in applying Stalin's disastrous advice to the 
Chinese party to concentrate on armed struggles in the cities 
rather than in the countryside, was also brought out at this 
WFTU meeting to testify to the "historical lesson" taught by 
his mistake and to the proven correctness of Mao's line of 
relying on armed struggle in the countryside whikessentially 
"lying low" in the cities. Li's statements were probably 
directed in large part at Ranadive, who was now repeating 
Li's old policy; they were probably also intended as a re-
minder to the Asian parties of the fallibility of CPSU ad-
vice.

that "if "if the people of the colonies and semi-colonies have no 
armed forces to defend themselves, they will lose everything," 
that the existence and development of the working class' organi-
zation and the united front depends on armed struggle, and 
that armed struggle is the "inevitable" course for colonial 
peoples. He emphasized that "the fighters of the national-
liberation wars of Vietnam, Burma, Indonesia, Malaya, and the 
Philippines have acted entirely correctly"*--as if someone had 
questioned this. He declared that it is "impossible" to over-
throw imperialism and establish a people's democracy "by tak-
ing any other easier way" than that of armed struggle, and 
warned that "if anybody attempts to do so, it would be a mis-
take.** Ultimately, however, the WFTU Conference--presumably 
in deference to Soviet views--in one of its resolutions urged 
the colonial and semi-colonial countries to take into account 
"local conditions and national characteristics" in choosing 
"the appropriate methods" to build a united front and defeat 
*Earlier, in his speech, he had also hailed India as one 
of the countries where armed struggles were taking place; the 
Manifesto issued by the Peiping WFTU Conference did not do so, 
suggesting--as does subsequent evidence--that the question of 
the suitability of India for armed struggle may have been one 
of the points at issue. 
**Liu here added unusually vigorous and lengthy warnings 
about the untrustworthiness and vacillations even of those 
sections of the bourgeoisie which participated in the anti-
imperialist alliance (the national bourgeoisie), and their 
incapacity to lead the national liberation movement or accom-
plish the democratic revolution. This danger of the Commun-
ists losing control of the alliance to the national bourgeoisie 
would naturally come to the fore with the abandonment of Com-
munist-led armed struggle against a clearly-defined imperi-
alist and reactionary enemy; in such cases, there would be 
an increased possibility that some Communists would classify 
native governments such as Nehru's as national bourgeois, and 
hence worthy of being supported against a common imperialist 
enemy rather than fought. Something like this, in fact, 
eventually happened in India in response to changes in Soviet 
policy which Peiping at first accepted but finally again came 
to denounce.

the imperialists, suggesting that armed struggle was now far 
from generally obligatory. All in all, the evidence suggests 
that while both Moscow and Peiping still endorsed armed strug-
gle for many Asian countries, and both admitted the need for 
some present exceptions, the CPSU now saw the necessity for 
more exceptions from this policy than the CCP was yet willing 
to admit. 
January Cominform Editorial and Fall of Ranadive: This 
interpretation is given some support by an editorial publish-
ed in the Cominform journal on 27 January 1950 which reiterat-
ed Liu's main points but in such a fashion as to suggest more 
vigorously that there were some Asian countries where armed 
struggle could not now usefully be employed, and that India 
was one such country. This editorial also quoted Liu's state-
ment that the Chinese path should be taken by the people of 
the various colonial countries, but changed NCNA's "The various" 
to "many," possibly meaning to indicate that the CPSU saw 
exceptions to the applicability of armed struggle and to 
limit the stature of the Chinese party and its experience. 
The same function was served by the editorial's specific in-
junction to the Indian Communist party to be guided by "the 
experience of the national-liberation movement in China and  
other countries." (Emphasis added.) In addition, the edi-
torial now instructed the CPI to unite with "all classes, 
parties, groups and organizations" willing to join it in a 
battle against imperialism, feudalism, and "the reactionary 
big bourgeoisie." 
The initial reaction of the Indian party to this signal 
was to heed the second instruction--to reject Ranadive's nar-
row approach and form a four-class alliance--but to misinter-
pret the more indirect suggestion that armed struggle itself 
be ended. In May 1950, a central committee meeting ousted 
Ranadive as general secretary and installed in control the 
Andhra leaders, headed by Rajeswar Rao. The triumphant Andhra 
group proceeded publicly to withdraw and apologize for the 
Ranadive attacks on Mao Tse-tung, and then to attempt to put 
into effect the Chinese formula of armed struggle in the 
countryside combined with "legal tactics" in the cities. This, 
however, proved no more successful than the Ranadive line.

peasantry after the Indian government occupied Hyderabad and 
applied strong military pressure on the revolt; and efforts

to open agrarian rebellions in other areas were largely un-
availing. At the same time, it proved impossible to obtain 
from the Nehru government the legal status in cities neces-
sary to build a united front there so long as the party was 
using violence in the countryside. The process of disorgani-
zation within the party accelerated,* and a campaign of op-
position to the line of the new leadership was resumed by 
Joshi and by the trade union leaders under Dange, who chal-
lenged Rajeswar Rao's contention that a revolutionary situa-
tion now existed in India. Another center of open opposi-
tion came into being when dissident party leaders working in 
the central apparatus banded together to form the so-called 
"Party Headquarters Unit;" these rebels even went 8o far as 
to found a journal for thelpublication of material opposing 
the line of the party leadership. 
Toward the close of 1950, the CPI received a series of 
guidance materials from the British Communist party support-
ing the views of the party opposition, accusing the Rao lead-
ership of having misunderstood the January 1950 Cominform 
journal editorial, denying that a revolutionary situation 
suitable for armed struggle ftoW existed in India, and urging 
concentration on the building of a broad united front and the 
application of all legal tactics, including participation in 
elections. Early in 1951, similar instructions were report-
edly given to the CPI directly by the CPSU when a delegation 
of CPI leaders of all factions is said to have visited Moscow. 
A document entitled the "Tactical Line" said to be based upon 
this Soviet guidance was circulated secretly within the party 
at this time, and subsequently published in slightly sanitized 
form as a party draft Policy Statement in May 1951. The 
"Tactical Line" stated, and the Policy Statement implied, 
that the final objective of the CPI was still an armed revolution 
*Afterwards the CPI Politburo testified that in the course 
of this joint "inner-Party struggle" and battle against the 
government the functioning of every party unit had received 
"the rudest shock;" that at the end of the struggle in 1951 
there was "very little of Party organization;" that local, 
district, and provincial committees had to be set up all over 
again; and that the party's fronts had become "virtually 
non-functioning."

to overthrow the Nehru government; but both documents denied 
that this was now feasible. These documents condemned both 
Ranadive's insistence on seeking revolution primarily through 
general strikes of industrial workers, on the Soviet pattern, 
and Rajeswar Rao's preoccupation with partisan warfare among 
the peasantry, on the Chinese pattern. It was pointed out 
that the latter policy had been unsuccessful partly because 
the Indian party, unlike the CCP, did not enjoy the advantage 
of a firm and contiguous base across the border--in the Chi-
nese case, the Soviet Union. (This point became important 
eight years later, when the PLA appeared on the Indian-Tibetan 
border in force during the suppression of the Tibetan revolt, 
and CPI leftists then began to argue that the party now had 
its contiguous base and could revive insurrectionary tactics.) 
The "Tactical Line" called on the CPI to learn from both the 
CPSU and the CCP and to prepare for the time when both methods 
could be used in conjunction; in the meantime, the party was 
to content itself with building the "revolutionary unity" of 
"all discontented sections and classes". 
In reality, the subsequent history of the Indian Communist 
party has been wholly occupied with the party's efforts to 
build this "revolutionary unity," and the revolution itself 
has become an increasingly remote (and more complex) goal as 
the policies of the CPI and the CPSU have evolved. As Ajoy 
Ghosh replaced Rajeswar Rao as the CPI leader to apply the 
new line in April 1951, the Indian party had come almost full 
circle since 1947; but the party had now changed considerably. 
While it was now accepted that the simple "Chinese path" was 
not immediately suitable to India, it was also driven home in 
the minds of all that the Chinese Communist party and Mao were 
mentors whose views should be respectfully studied after those 
of the CPSU. The rigid, arbitrary Bolshevik discipline which 
Ranadive had attempted to wield within the party was now gone 
forever; moreover, as the secret organizational report deliver-
ed to the Sixth CPI Congress in 1961 noted, elementary Com-
munist discipline was itself permanently discredited by the 
misuse Ranadive had made of it, and the extraordinary public 
factional defiance of central authority which had originally 
been justified as the only means to dethrone first Ranadive 
and then Rao was from now on implanted as a regular feature 
of party life. The new CPI general secretary, Ajoy Ghosh, 
was caught up immediately in such contention of opposing fac-
tions, over the line the party should adopt toward the Nehru 
government.

THE CPI AND THE CHANGING SOVIET LINE 
TOWARD NEHRU (1951-1955) 
The most important feature of the next few years for the 
CPI was the gradually softening Soviet attitude toward Nehru. 
By degrees the Indian party was forced to follow the evolution 
of Soviet policy in agreeing first that there were some posi-
tive aspects to Nehru's generally black foreign policy, then 
that Nehru's foreign policy was generally good but that his 
domestic policy was bad, and finally that there were favorable 
features of his domestic policy as well. The CPI had to be 
bludgeoned by Moscow and its agents in'the central CPI leader-
ship into taking each painful step along this path, usually 
with a considerable time lag behind the development of Soviet 
policy; each such gradual modification of line toward Nehru 
was accomplished only over the strenuous objections of a large 
section of the Indian party which did not wish what it regard-
ed as opportunities--to advance the cause of Communism in 
India by opposing Nehru--to be sacrificed for the sake of So-
viet foreign policy interests. Such CPI recalcitrance was 
reflected in the party program adopted in 1951, and then was 
strongly felt at the Third CPI Congress at Madurai in December 
1953. However, the Soviet movement away from hostility to 
Nehru, begun cautiously three years before Stalin's death, ac-
celerated greatly thereafter in the Bandung period of 1954 
and 1955, when Nehru exchanged visits with the Soviet and Chi-
nese leaders and the USSR began a program of economic assist-
ance to India. Under the impact of these events, the CPI be-
came increasingly bound to a moderate policy involving reliance 
upon parliamentary elections. This trend to receive its great-
est development after the 20th CPSU Congress in 1956. 
By the time of Stalin's death, any serious divergence 
between Chinese and Soviet policy toward the national libera-
tion movement would seem to have disappeared, and Moscow and 
Peiping appear to have acted in close coordination in foster-
ing warmer relations with Nehru in 1954 and 1955. However, 
the relative importance of the Chinese party and the Chinese 
revolution as a guide to Asia--which the CCP had stubbornly 
upheld during Stalin's lifetime--was inevitably increased as 
a result of his death, a fact reflected during this period in 
statements by both Soviet and Chinese leaders.

A. Evolution of Soviet Line Before Stalin's Death 
Until July 1950, Soviet and Chinese propaganda had been 
hostile to the Nehru government since its inception. The New 
Delhi regime was described as a lackey of the British and Ameri-
can imperialists which aided them in turning India into an 
advance base from which to 'combat the national liberation move-
ment of Asia. The government, the Congress party, and the 
Praja Socialist Party were alike labeled reactionary "flunkies" 
of the Anglo-American warmongers. Izvestiya in October 1949 
called Nehru's neutrality hypocritical; a Chinese writer in 
April 1950 said that he was at the "beck and call of the im-
perialists;" and the Soviet New Times in June 1950 said that 
the ruling circles of India were standing aloof from political 
entanglements only because they were afraid of exposing them-
selves in the eyes of the masses. 
Shoftly after the opening of the Korean war, however, 
there came a change. On 1 July 1950 the Indian Ambassador to 
Peiping tentatively suggested to the CPR that a solution to 
the Korean problem could be reached by referring it to the 
UN Security Council, with the CPR being admitted to her "legiti-
mate place" there and the Soviets consequently giving up the 
boycott of the Council they were then maintaining. When this 
suggestion received a favorable response from Peiping, Nehru 
on 13 July sent identical letters to Stalin and Acheson with 
a formal proposal along these lines, which was promptly accept-
ed by the USSR and rejected by the United States. This event 
was warmly welcomed and publicized by Moscow and Peiping, with 
People's Daily hailing "the world-wide support for the peace-
ful proposals of J. Nehru and the reply of J. V. Stalin." From 
this time on, both Communist states appear to have been motivat-
ed by a growing awareness of the uses to be made of Indian 
foreign policy. In the propaganda, statements by New Delhi 
unfavorable to the Communist position on Korea tended to be 
downplayed or ignored, while favorable statements or actions 
were emphasized and exaggerated. Although praise for Nehru 
personally continued to be almost wholly absent, the Indian 
government as such was often referred to in amicable terms. 
Mild criticism of the government, largely regarding domestic 
policy, reappeared in Soviet media about two months after the 
Nehru-Stalin exchange and persisted sporadically until Stalin's 
death.

In December 1950, R. Palme Dutt, a leading British Com-
munist who had often in the past served as an agent for the 
transmission of CPSU policy changes to the CPI, attempted to 
persuade the Indian party to modify its line in response to 
this new element in the bloc attitude toward Nehru. In a 
pamphlet published by the CPI in Bombay in which Dutt purport-
ed to answer questions addressed to him by the CPI, he held 
that the signs of a change in Indian foreign policy exemplifi-
ed by Nehru's stand on the issues of Korea and Peiping's ad-
mission to the UN amounted to "a very important development." 
Although this was only "a beginning" and although Nehru did 
not yet have "a consistent peace policy," yet he was showing 
at least "hesitant and limited" opposition to imperialism, 
which it was the duty of the CPI to encourage. It was also 
the duty of the CPI to bring maximum popular pressure upon 
the Indian government when it vacillated in order to defeat 
the designs of that wing of the Indian bourgeoisie which fa-
void imperialism and to strengthen the hand of that bourgeois 
wing led by Nehru which diverged from imperialist aims. 
The Indian party, however, was not yet ready to accept 
even this partial reappraisal of Nehru. The party Program 
and Statement of Policy drafted by the politburo and central 
committee in the spring of 1951 and formally approved by an 
All-Indian Party Conference the following October both took 
a negative view of Nehru's foreign policy. The Program de-
clared that the government "essentiall:y carries out the for-
eign policy of British imperialism" and insisted that Nehru's 
policy on the issue of peace was "spurious" and hypocritical. 
A decade later, Pravda was to print an article by CPI general 
secretary Ghosh which retroactively condemned these statements 
of the 1951 CPI program as erroneous. 
As Soviet foreign policy continued to explore further the 
advantages to be gained from Indian "neutrality", it simulta-
neously continued to push forward the "peace" line exemplified 
by the Stockholm Peace Appeal of March 1950, which had as its 
central aim the mobilization of the broadest possible public 
opposition--on a non-class basis--to the foreign policies of 
the "imperialist" powers, particularly the United States. The 
CPI was placed under increasing pressure by Moscow to devote 
central attention to this "peace" campaign against America, 
and this in turn reinforced the pressure on the Indian party 
to modify its line toward Nehru, who was viewed by Moscow as 
facilitating this campaign in certain respects.

In this context, the issue of the line to betaken toward 
Nehru was fought out Within: the_..CPI" for: the next few years* in 
terms of the question of whether British or American imperial-
ism was the chief enemy facing the Indian people. Those CPI 
leaders who either out of obedience to Moscow or because of 
their own less militant inclinations wished to take a softer 
line toward Nehru held that the struggle against the main in-
ternational enemy--the United States�was paramount in India 
as well, and that all other considerations ought to be subor-
dinated to the cause of attracting the maximum possible Indian 
support, including Nehru if possible, to the peace campaign. 
An opposing CPI faction was led by the chieftains of the Andhra 
provincial party, Rasjeswar Rao and Sundarayya, with increas-
ingly significant support now also from West Bengal and the 
Punjab, which were traditionally centers of Indian terrorism. 
This faction tended to pay obeisance to the world fight against 
American imperialism and to the peace campaign, but to emphasize 
that the primary enemy of the Indian Communist...Party remained 
British imperialism, which still controlled India as a semi-
colony through its economic investments and through its politi-
cal instrument, the Nehru government. Implicit in this line 
was the demand to carry on mass struggles (if, for the time 
being, no longer violent uprisings) against the New Delhi re-
gime, and not to compromise these struggles for the sake of 
the broader interests of Soviet foreign policy. 
B. Death of Stalin and Third (Madurai) CPI Congress  
Throughout 1952 and 1953 the second, or militant faction 
remained the stronger of the two within the Indian party, with 
the central party leadership led by Ghosh striving to bridge 
the gap between the increasingly divergent views of Moscow and 
the Andhra militants. While an extended party plenum at the 
close of 1952 criticized the CPI's neglect of the peace move-
ment and promised to make this the central task of the party, 
a central committee resolution the following March continued 
to identify Great Britain as the chief enemy and to describe 
the Nehru government as a collaborator with imperialism. Al-
though Moscow is reported to have sent a directive to the CPI 
a few months later urging it to stop criticizing Nehru on this 
score in the interests of winning him over tb,the "peace camp," 
strong opposition to this line persisted within the party.

A major showdown on this issue took place at the Third 
CPI Congress, which was held in the south India city of 
Madurai from 27 December.1953 to 4 January 1954. The draft 
political resolution presented to this congress by the lead-
ership of Ghosh and Dange on the whole took the position de-
sired by Moscow, with some concessions to the party militants. 
The resolution devoted somewhat more attention to the needs 
of the struggle against American imperialism than to the fight 
against Britain, but attempted to finesse the question of which 
was more important by depicting the two as compatible, since 
"the question of defeating the war plans of American imperi-
alists, the defense of India's freedom from the American threat" 
was "closely linked with the question of India's winning free-
dom, liquidating feudalism" and of accomplishing "a break with 
the British Empire" and the removal of the "British strangle-
hold on India's economy." A similar compromise stand was taken 
on Nehru. The resolution said that the Indian government's 
role on a number of international issues had been "appreciated 
by the peace-loving masses", and enumerated New Delhi's "denun-
ciation of the atom bomb, its help in ending the hostilities 
in Korea, its condemnation of the tactics of Syngman Rhee," 
its opposition to U.S. military aid to Pakistan, and its con-
clusion of cultural and trade agreements with the USSR and 
China. The resolution warned, however, that this did not mean 
that "democratic forces should uncritically and unconditionally 
give general overall support to the government policies even 
in the international sphere," since those policies "do not 
follow consistently a policy of peace and democracy;" and the 
resolution went on to list actions by New Delhi which had 
helped imperialism. The conclusion reached was that "while 
supporting all the positive measures," the party should "inten-
sify pressure on the Indian government in order to make it 
pursue a consistent policy of peace." (At the same time, the 
party was called on to build a broad united front in such a 
manner that Communist policies and freedom of action were not 
restricted in any way, while yet gathering support to replace 
the Congress Party government with a "government of democratic 
unity" of the CPI and its allies.) 
All this was not satisfactory to the Andhra militants, 
who submitted a document to the party congress known as the 
"Andhra Thesis" which did not specifically argue the question 
of policy toward Nehru, but which deplored "general talk of 
fighting Anglo-American imperialism" and insisted that the

long-term need to oppose America as the "international enemy" 
should not be allowed to obscure the immediate and primary 
"concrete task" of the CPI, which was to fight British imperi-
alism and its agents in India. Despite the presence at the 
congress of Soviet embassy representatives, as well as British 
party general secretary Harry Pollit--who emphasized the antl-
American line in his speeches--delegates from Andhra, Punjab, 
and West Bengal reportedly tried and failed to amend the politi-
cal resolution in accordance with their views. When the reso-
lution was finally passed, one leftist Andhra leader, Basavapun-
niah, is said to have formally announced the abstention of 
nearly one-third the delegates present. The leadership attempt-
ed to appease the militant opposition by granting them strong 
representation on the new central committee, which was balanced 
to include members of all factions. 
Although the CPSU had had difficulties a number of times 
before in getting the CPI to amend its line in response to a 
shift in Soviet foreign policy, it is likely that the obstruc-
tion it encountered at this CPI Congress--and on several oc-
casions again in the next few years--was due at least in part 
to the beginning of a gradual erosion of CPSU authority re-
sulting from the death of Stalin. With the demise of the So-
viet vozhd in March 1953 the Soviet party lost an irreplacable 
asset in its dealings with foreign Communist parties, since 
the awe inspired by the man who had dominated the movement for 
three decades was found to be not transferrable. The difficulties 
this caused for the CPSU within the CPI were eventually to be 
greatly increased, first by the process of deStalinization and 
then by the gradual rise of Chinese opposition to Soviet policies. 
C. The CPI and the Development of the Bandung Line 
After the Madurai Congress, Indian-American relations de-
clined for a variety of reasons in the spring of 1954, and the 
evolution of a Chinese and Soviet policy concilatory to Nehru 
was accelerated. In June 1954, Chou En-lai visited New Delhi 
for talks with Nehru, following which a communique was issued 
enunciating the Five Principles (Panch Shila) of peaceful co-
existence. A few days after Chou-r-iFrival, CPI general sec-
retary Ajoy Ghosh departed for an extended stay in Moscow, 
ostensibly for medical reasons but in fact primarily for

_sEeirrr 
lengthy conversations on the new course of CPI policy. The 
party was meanwhile plunged again into violent controversy 
shortly after Chou's departure from India. On 18 July, the 
editor of the party weekly New Age,. the Politburo member P. 
)Ramamurthi,wrote an article in which he d'eclaredi that the 
Nehru-Chou talks had wrought a "change in the relationship of 
forces in Asia;" welcomed "warmly and enthusastically" the 
development of "cooperation and friendship" between New Delhi 
and the bloc; and advanced the slogan of a "national platform 
for peace and freedom." This slogan was immediately attacked 
strongly by militants from all sections of the party as imply-
ing that the CPI should now conclude an alliance with Nehru 
and the Congress party organization, and in early September 
1954 a coalition of leftists from various provinces actually 
succeeded in getting a central committee plenum to condemn 
the party politburo for having committed a "reformist" mis-
take in authorizing the publication of Ramamurthi's article. 
This action by the central committee was extremely reveal-
ing in its demonstration of the extent to which authority with-
in the party had been dispersed among the provinces since Rana-
dive's time. A later party document commented that after the 
central committee had registered its rebuke, "even this criti-
cism...was not considered enough by certain Provincial Commit-
tees who thought that the Politburo had not been dealt with 
adequately." This document analyzed the motivation of the 
central committee leftists as follows: 
The central committee had to evolve a tactical line 
in a changing situation, and for that it had to try 
to understand the changes themselves. This was com-
pletely lacking. Fear gripped the committees--fear 
of committing reformist mistakes. Some comrades of 
the central committee even went so far as to ascribe 
the success of the congress in strengthening its 
position to reformist mistakes committed by the party. 
The "reformist mistakes" which the leftists felt the lead-
ership had committed may have included an instruction which 
(a British service reported) had been sent out by CPI headquar-
tersto party workers in the spring of 1954, advising them to 
go slow in their agitation against the government in view of 
the "delicate nature of the international situation." In Par-
liament, during the spring and summer, CPI representatives had

,szerff 
found themselves restricted by party policy to attacks upon 
the West and to criticism of the government's domestic finan-
cial and economic policies; because Nehru had seized the 
initiative in espousing an anti-Western position on a number 
of foreign policy issues--e.g., colonialism, Korea, Indochina, 
and U.S. military aid to Pakistan--Communist deputies were 
forced to trail behind him with praise on each such issue. 
Such "tailism" with respect to the national bourgeoisie was 
most uncomfortable for the militant section of the Indian 
party. 
Dutt Cominform Article: On 8 October 1954, however, the 
Cominform journal published an article by A. Palme Dutt in 
which this British Communist indirectly reaffirmed the Ramamurthi 
thesis, this time from an authoritative forum. This article 
is said by a subsequent party document to have thrown the polit-
buro "into a state of panic." Already "divided and demoraliz-
ed" by the central committee's accusation that it had backslid 
into reformism, and without general secretary Ghosh who was 
in Moscow, the politburo on 3 November hastily summoned an 
emergency meeting of the central committee and there placed 
before it a resolution rejecting the line taken in Dutt's Comin-
form article. During five ensuing days of debate in thec.ten-
tral committee, something like an abortive revolt against CPSU 
authority appears to have taken place. The Andhra leaders are 
reported to have revived their old argument about the superiority 
of Chinese to Soviet experience as a model for CPI tactics,* 
and other speakers are said to have declared that it was ob-
vious that Moscow l(and hence Dutt) could err; the recent Soviet 
reversal of line toward Tito was cited as proof of this. In 
the midst of the debate, however, a telegram is reported to 
have arrived from Ghosh in Moscow urging the party not to be 
hasty in rejecting Dutt's line; and finally the central commit-
tee did reject the politburo resolution and adopted instead 
a resolution taking a noncommital attitude toward Dutt, declaring 
that "more time and thought" were required to resolve the "im-
portant differences" within the central committee. 
*There is no evidence that the CCP at this time encouraged 
any CPI leaders to take this line, and it appears unlikely that 
Peiping would have done so--both because of the relatively 
harmonious Sino-Soviet relations existing in this period and 
because Peiping's current line toward Nehru was not in fact 
that of the CPI militants.

A few weeks later, Ghosh returned from Moscow and imme-
diately beganto write articles and public statements suggest-
ing that he had shifted further to the right. His new line 
was summarized by a statement on 7 December that "the internal 
policy of the Nehru Government does not suit the interests of 
the masses, while the foreign policy does." The task of im-
posing this line on the CPI was helped by the return visit 
which Nehru had recently paid to the CPR that fall, but was 
made more difficult by speeches which Nehru subsequently de-
livered in November praising the CPR but bitterly attacking 
the Indian Communist party. While Ghosh attempted to keep 
the CPI from responding with personal attacks, on Nehru, the 
organ of the West Bengal party, Swadhinata, nevertheless did 
publish an editorial assailing the Prime Minister; this was 
the first known example of what was to prove a persistent 
policy of defiance of the party center by Swadhinata which 
continues to this day. 
February 1955 Andhra Elections: The objections of the 
CPI leftists to the trend of Soviet foreign policy were aug-
mented by certain Soviet statements made shortly before the 
holding of important elections in Andhra province in February 
1955. An editorial in Pravda on 26 January 1955--India's 
Republic Day--not only praised the foreign policy of "the 
outstanding statesman Jawaharlal Nehru" but went on to list 
and praise the domestic accomplishments of the Nehru govern-
ment in the fields of agriculture, consumer goods' production, 
education and public health. Incidental praise for New Delhi's 
foreign policy was also contained in the 8 February 1955 
speech delivered by Foreign Minister Molotov to the Supreme 
Soviet, as well as in another Pravda editorial of 21 February. 
Such statements--and especially the 26 January Pravda editorial--
were skillfully used in Congress Party propaganda against the 
CPI in the Andhra election campaign; this had considerable ef-
fect, particularly in view of the fact that the Andhra party, 
as the moderates in the party center later emphasized, applied 
"sectarian tactics" during the campaign and "failed to recog-
nize the progressive orientation in the Government's foreign 
policy." After the Andhra party had lost this election, some 
party leftists accused Ghosh of having been secretly pleased 
with this failure as constituting a blow to the conceit of the 
Andhra provincial committee and to its independence of the 
party center. Along with being indignant at Moscow for its 
unprincipled actions in making these statements, the leftists

were angry at Ghosh and the party leadership for having failed 
either to print the January Pravda editorial and Molotov's 
statements in New Age or to have issued a secret circular about 
them, so that the Andhra leadership was not given guidance on 
the Soviet line and was caught publicly contradicting it. 
Throughout 1955 the USSR and the CPR continued to develop 
the new policy toward Nehru. In April the Bandung conference 
of Asian and African,leaders was held, and Chou En-lai showed 
the Asian bourgeoisie a disarmingly moderate image of the CPR 
and Chinese Communism. At about the same time a tentative 
contract was signed based on an earlier offer of Soviet aid on 
favorable terms in constructing a large steel mill in India. 
In May, an editorial in the CPSU journal Kommunist gave the 
first indication of a coming change in the previously hostile 
Soviet appraisal of Gandhi. In June, Nehru paid an extended 
visit to the Soviet Union. 
While Nehru was touring the USSR� the CPI central commit-
tee held a month-long meeting heatedly debating these events; 
at the close of this session �a new political resolution was 
adopted representing a compromise between the opposing factions, 
finally supporting Nehru's foreign policy while taking a con-
fused and contradictory but largely hostile line toward his 
domestic policy. Instead of uniting the party, this CPI com-
promise, like so many others before and since, only exacerbated 
the factional struggle. A-Aater politburo report declared that 
three "more or less well-defined groups within'thpparty"-the 
supporters of the resolution and its leftist and rightist 
critics--now began an '"intense political struggle" which "be-
came the main feature of inner-party life from top to bottom," 
so that "even the current activity of the party came to a 
standstill in most provinces." The rightists were at this 
stage once more led by P. C. Joshi, who had staged a gradual 
comiback.within the party since 1951 and was now again writing 
for New Age. Josiliwas strongly influenced not only by the new 
bloc line toward Nehru, but also by Nehru's avowals of fpro-
gressive" and "socialist" goals;* in July 1955, in a private 
*In December 1954 the Indian government had introduced a 
resolution into Parliament declaring the goal of government

conversation with a follower, he expressed great admiration 
for *hat he termed Nehru's great contribution to Asian social-
ism, called the Prime Minister a great mass leader and genuine 
progressive, and said that it would be suicidal for the CPI 
to continue a policy of opposition to him. Joshi now wanted 
the party to support Nehru all along the line and work toward 
a coalition government with his wing of the Congress party. 
At the other extreme, the leftists of Andhra and the Punjab 
were angry even at those kind things which the party had said 
about Nehru's foreign policy, and blamed Ghosh for rendering 
tacit support to what they felt was Joshi's "appease Nehru" 
line. 
These opposing views were disseminated by their respective 
politburo champions within the provincial committees where 
each leader had his strength, and were even published in the 
internal central committee organ Forum. During this period 
the politburo itself, by its own subsequent testimony, had 
virtually ceased to meet. With the roots of their political 
and party strength in the provinces or in specialized fields 
of activity such as the trade unions, hardly any of the polit-
buro members wished to or did devote attention to the weak 
patty .center. This indifference--and its corollary, the con-
tinued failure of the provincial organizations to keep the 
center informed of what was going on throughout the party--
had come to be a more or less permanent feature of CPI life, 
and was lamented by organizational reports delivered to cen-
tral committee meetings and Party congresses in 1951, 1954, 
1956, and again'in 1961.

this document was discussed at the central committee meeting 
held in September after Ghosh's return; this meeting was re-

CPI opposition to the government's Second Five-Year Plan, and 
proclaimed a dual policy toward Nehru of supporting him where 
he was correct and opposing him where he was reactionary. 
Meanwhile, amendments to the party program were prepared for 
ratification by the next CPI Congress, watering down the 1951 
statements defining Nehru's government as an appendage of 
imperialism. 
Khrushchev-Bulganin Visit: In mid-November 1955 the CPSU 
completed this phrase in the shift in policy toward Nehru when 
Khrushchev and Bulganin visited India, offered a long-term pro-
gram of technical assistance to India's industrialization, and 
paid several tributes to Gandhi, to Nehru, and to Nehru's "pro-
gressive" statements favoring socialism. Aware of the divisive 
effect these statements and actions were bound to have on the 
already divided CPI, the Soviet party reportedly attempted to 
offset this in advance with a letter sent to the CPI politburo 
in October. This letter is said to have declared ambiguously 
that the Indian party should not be discouraged by anything 
the Soviet government said in public but should carry on in 
good spirit, building up the party until such time when a more 
active line could be taken. Several weeks later, a member of 
the visiting Soviet delegation is said to. have conveyed similar 
advice to the CPI leaders, urging the party not to become 
"panicky" because of the Bulganin-Khrushchev speeches of praise 
for Nehru, and declaring that Soviet long-term aims were the 
reduction of Indian dependence on and ties to the United States 
and Britain and the infiltration of the Indian economy through 
the supplying of basic industrial aid. 
Rise in Chinese Stature: This period of 1954 and 1955, 
when the CPR was working in close harmony with the USSR in pro-
moting the soft line toward the bourgeoisie of India and other 
Asian countries, was to prove the all-time high point both for 
Sino-Soviet cooperation generally and for the degree of recogni-
tion given by Moscow to the stature of the Chinese party. Even 
two years before Stalin's death, he had given some implicit 
recognition to Chinese claims by allowing to be printed in the 
Cominform journal an article by Lu Ting-i stating that Mao's 
theory of the Chinese revolution was a "new development of 
Marxism-Leninism in the revolution of the colonial and semi-
colonial countries" and a "new contribution to the treasury 
of Marxism-Leninism." Lu went on to say that while the "clas�
sic type of revolution for the imperialist countries is the

October Revolution," the classic type for the colonial and 
semi-colonial countries was the Chinese revolution. In March 
1954, a year after Stalin's death, CCP politburo member Chen 
Yun publicly reiterated this claim, asserting that the Chinese 
revolution was "the major sector" of, and inspiration, for 
the revolution in the East. For a variety of reasons, some 
possibly related to internal CPSU politics, the Soviet party 
not only made no effort after Stalin's death to counter these 
Chinese claims, but made gestures specially intended to placate 
Peiping. On 8 February 1955 Molotov publicly referred to the 
CPR as co-leader of the'bloc with the: Soviet Union; although 
Peiping never itself picked up this formula, it was reiterated 
for a time by Moscow and a number of foreign Communist parties, 
including the CPI. .An equally striking gesture was Pravda's 
formal announcement, in a special communique on 3 March 1955, 
that the accusations of espionage and subversion brought 
against Anna Louise Strong at the time of her arrest and ex-
pulsion in February 1949 had been completely groundless; just 
as her treatment by Stalin had been meant as a reproof to Mao's 
pretensions, this statement by Stalin's heirs was very probably 
intended as an indirect apology to Mao.

III. CONSEQUENCES OF THE 20TH CPSU CONGRESS (1956-1958) 
The 20th Congress of the CPSU in February 1956 and the 
events which flowed from it administered a series of funda-
mental shocks to the CPI with results which were to effect 
greatly the relationship of the Indian party to Moscow and 
to Peiping down to the present day. The first and most im-
portant of these shocks was that of deStalinization, which 
on the one hand greatly intensified the spirit of cynisism, 
the internal disorganization, and the personal indiscipline 
already widespread because of the party's previous history, 
and on the other hand greatly accelerated the long-term de-
cline in the authority and prestige of the CPSU which had 
begun with the death of Stalin, while simultaneously enhanc-
ing the appeal of the CCP to those sections of the Indian 
party sympathetic to Peiping's viewpoint. This development 
was followed by the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian revo-
lution and the subsequent execution of Nagy, which weakened 
the CPSU's position among rightist sections of the party. A 
third difficulty was meanwhile occasioned by the 20th Congress 
line on peaceful transition to: socialism, qnd particularly by 
the extreme interpretation of that line in application to India 
provided by an authoritative Soviet article in the summer of 
1956 which implied that Nehru, and not the CPI, would lead 
India into the socialism system. This viewpoint was directly 
challenged in public by Ghosh, and the CPSU soon retreated to 
a more orthodox position which still enjoined CPI support for 
Nehru and CPI reliance primarily upon parliamentary tactics. 
Forces in the Indian party favoring the parliamentary 
path were strengthened by the party's accession to power 
through elections in the state of Kerala in April 1957; and 
the CPI moved from the April 1956 line of the Palghat party 
congress (where the party cautiously acknowledged the possi-
bility of peaceful transition to socialism through parliamen-
tary means backed by mass movements, and announced its inten-
tion to explore this possibility by conducting itself as a 
parliamentary opposition) to the April 1958 line of the Amritsar 
Congress (which exuded confidence that the parliamentary take-
over in Kerala could be repeated in other Indian states and 
eventually even in the center).

....srbercff 
Meanwhile, by the fall of 1956 the first indications 
began to appear of growing divergence between the Chinese 
and Soviet parties over how far the soft line toward the 
national bourgeoisie of Asian countries should be pursued. 
Chinese objections on this score, originally suggested at 
the time of the Eighth CCP Congress in September 1956, were 
reinforced as the Indian Communist party became increasingly 
committed to the parliamentary line in the wake of the 
Kerala election, and Chinese comments began to be heard in 
1958 concerning the pernicious effect the Kerala Ministry 
was having on the militance and Marxist orthodoxy of the CPI. 
At the same time the left wing of the Indian party led by 
the Andhra, West Bengal, and Punjab organizations, infuriated 
at the restrictions and inhibitions which were imposed upon 
the party as a whole by the need to preserve the Kerala gov-
ernment in power, became more and more inclined to regard the 
long-respectOiChinese party as a source of inspiration more 
congenial to 'its interests than Moscow. 
At the end of 1958 there was a momentary hardening of 
the Soviet line toward Nehru, occasioned primarily by the 
campaign being conducted by the Congress Party and other:forces 
in Kerala to oust the Communist government. This firmer So-
viet attitude was exemplified by an article by Yudin in Prob-
lems of Peace and Socialism rebutting Nehru's attack on Com-
munists as addicted to violence, and placing the onus for any 
possible violence on bourgeois resistance to a peaceful trans-
fer of power to the Communist party. The Soviet shift in em-
phasis proved to be temporary, however, and in 1959 the polari-
zation of the CPI between a moderate pro-Soviet wing and a 
militant pro-Chinese wing was to increase greatly. 
A. The Effects of DeStalinization 
At the fourth CPI Congress, held in Palghat from 19 to 
26 April 1956, the question of the attacks on Stalin made at 
the 20th CPSU Congress two months before was a central issue. 
Although there is no direct evidence, certain passages in the 
speech made by Ghosh to the Indian congress suggested that 
some of his audience might have been already aware not only

of the public criticism of Stalin made at the 20th Congress, 
but also of at least the gist of Khrushchev's secret indict-
ment of the former dictator.* Ghosh in his speech alluded 
to the consternation spreading throughout the CPI, acknow-
ledging that "some of our comrades say that the whole moral 
basis on which they stood is shaken and there is nothing on 
which to stand." He strove to counter this feeling by offer-
ing a mixed appraisal of Stalin as an outstanding leader who 
had made certain mistakes toward the end of his life, and by 
defending Stalin's past role as "the international leader of 
the Communist movement" and the CPSU's role as "the party 
which has acted as a model" for the movement. He indicated 
his own dismay at the way deStalinization was being handled 
by saying that "many of us may be critical of the way in which 
certain things were done,"** but pleaded that the party not 
to give way to "cynicism" regarding the USSR and the CPSU, 
insisting that the Soviet party "remains the leading party" 
of the international Communist movement. But. Ghosh cited 
questions he said were being asked within the CPI regarding 
what other Soviet leaders were doing during "all these days" 
of the cult of the personality, and what made it possible 
"for such things to continue for such a long time;" further-
more, Ghosh acknowledged that he had no satisfactory answers 
to give to these questions, and that "what replies have been 
given have not satisfied me." Similar dissatisfaction with 
Soviet actions and answers was to be expressed publicly by 
Ghosh in December 1961 in the wake of the public Soviet at-
tacks on Stalin at the 22nd CPSU Congress. 
Subsequent reports have suggested that the Soviet attacks 
on Stalin were particularly devastating for Indian Communists 
who were old-timers in the party, and who had become adept at 
rationalizing Stalin's shortcomings and the repeated Soviet 
*The text of the secret speech was not released by the U.S. 
State Department until 4 June. 
**A subsequent CPI Central Committee resolution in July 1956 
warned that a wholly negative, "one-sided appraisal" of Stalin's 
role "causes bewilderment among the masses and can be utilized 
by enemies of Communism to confuse them."

betrayals of CPI interests for Soviet foreign policy interests. 
The elaborate rationalizations established through the decades 
of Stalin's tenure were now destroyed. The organizational re-
port submitted to the Sixth CPI Congress in 1961 testified that 
the Soviet deStalinization campaign of 1956 created a "big 
shock" within the "entire party," and "undermined the faith 
of a large number of party members in the international Commun-
ist movement." As a result, "ideas of questioning" what had 
been accepted as "unquestionable truths became the order of 
the day;" these newly-questioned truths included "the need for 
the unity of the party, discipline, democratic centralism, and.. 
the solidarity of the international movement." While this was 
a phenomenon which took place in many Communist parties in 
1956, it was particularly marked in the CPI because .of the 
party's previous history and because, as the 1961 organizational 
report noted, disregard for discipline had Already become a 
widespread fact in the Indian party before 1956. Reports in 
the summer of 1956 now spoke of "anarchy in the party;" hardly 
anything was kept secret any more, and faction leaders in party 
headquarters disseminated a constant flow of rumors and propa-
ganda among their followers to discredit the factional opposi-
tion or to inform their supporters of discussions at the top. 
This CPI internal propaganda war was to be of great importance 
during the Sino-Soviet polemic of 1960. 
Simultaneously, the prestige of the Chinese party began 
to grow throughout the CPI as that of the CPSU fell. For a 
time, this was even the case with such a normally loyal Soviet 
adherent as Ghosh. In his speech to the Palghat Congress, 
Ghosh pointedly referred to Peiping's comment on deStaliniza-
tion, the People's Daily article "On the Historical Experie--Ice 
of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat." (While rendering a 
generally favorable judgment on Stalin's virtues and shortcom-
ings, this article explicitly referred to the errors in policy 
into which Stalin had led the CCP from 1927 to 1936.) Ghosh 
declared that this article dealt with the question "in a more 
satisfactory and a more elaborate way than I have seen so far 
anywhere," and recommended that all party members read the ver-
sion of the article reprinted in New Age. A resolution of the 
Palghat Congress subsequently called on the Central Committee 
to make sure that all party organizations had this People's  
Daily article for guidance when discussing the 20th Congress.

Hungarian Revolution and Nagy Execution: Within the right 
wing of the Indian party, disenchantment with the CPSU was 
furthered by the Soviet suppression of the Hungarian Revolution 
in November 1956. In an open letter published in New Age on 
18 November responding to a socialist challenge to the CPI on 
this issue, Ghosh defended the Soviet action apologetically 
but admitted that the party had been wrong in the past in 
"idealizing the USSR" and in not having paid more attention 
to other people's criticism of the Soviet Union,. Prior to a 
December 1956 meeting of the central committee, one staff unit 
in CPI headquarters submitted a memorandum to the party condemn-
ing Soviet policy in Hungary, and a clash on the subject of 
Hungary reportedly occurred at the central committee meeting. 
The December 1956 issue of the CPI monthly journal contained 
an article strongly suggesting disallusionment with party 
methods and attitudes toward truth stemming from the Hungarian 
events, 'and the following August a "nihilist group" of second-
level party leaders with a similar point of view was said to 
be preparing a rebellious report on the "implications of Hun-
gary" for circulation within the party. 
Following the execution of Imre Nagy in the summer of 
1958 there was a similar stir of discontent, particularly with-
in provincial party organizations which were peculiarly sensi-
tive to Indian public opinion. In Bombay, where the CPI had 
an important alliance with non-Communist parties to protect, 
the trade union leader Dange made a public statement critical 
of the executions; and a similar statement was issued on 30 
June by the Kerala party, which was by then seeking to preserve 
its rule in therprthrince. In general, while CPI objections 
to the Hungarian and Nagy incidents tended to be concentrated 
among sections of the party which opposed the leftist point 
of view--and which therefore could not ultimately gravitate 
toward the CCP as Peiping became increasingly militant--these 
contributions to anti-Soviet feeling within the party never-
theless did add to the general erosion of CPSU prestige which 
began with Stalin's death and was hastened by the deStaliniza-
tion campaign. 
Besides the statements already cited, there is consider-
able evidence to document this overall decline of CPSU stature 
and the gradual compensatory rise in Chinese prestige during 
1957 and 1958; until late in this period, the phemomenon was 
general through all factions of the party, and did not yet 
represent a polarization of purely leftist CPI opinion along

anti-CPSU and pro-CCP lines. In April 1957 a meeting of the 
West Bengal provincial committee reportedly ignored a letter 
from a CPI politburo member stressing the leading role of the 
Soviet party, and resolved to "interpret and apply" Marxism-
Leninism according to local conditions and to follow Soviet 
policies only as a general ideological beacon. In June 1958, 
a group of West Bengal CPI members submitted a letter to party 
headquarters bitterly complaining of CPI subservience to the 
CPSU as demonstrated both by the party's failure to condemn 
the Nagy execution and the CPI's abrupt withdrawal of friendly 
greetings to Yugoslavia after the second bloc break with that 
country. In July 1957, the politburo member Z. A. Ahmad de-
clared to friends that "the USSR is no model now," and that 
the CPR was such a model, if not a completely satisfactory one. 
In August 1958, Mohit Sen, an important CPI central apparatus 
functionary close to Ghosh, declared that Khrushchev did not 
have a great personal grasp of the "iron laws of history," 
that Mao, on the other hand, did, and that this Maoist insight 
was partly responsible for the success of the Communist move-
ment in China. In October 1957, a long series of speakers at 
a closed meeting of the Bombay city party committee, led by 
the Bombay party secretary, strongly attacked the USSR and the 
CPSU and the CPI's subservience to the CPSU. And in August 
1958, a veteran member of the Maharashtra provincial committee 
claimed that many members of the CPI had become hostile to the 
CPSU since the 20th CPSU Congress, that these members no long-
er considered the CPSU the leader of the international movement, 
and that they felt Mao had been the real world leader since 
Stalin's death; this view was said to derive partly from the 
fact that the CCP, like the CPI, was Asian, and partly from 
the fact that the Chinese leaders had committed fewer blunders 
than those of the CPSU. 
B. The Effects of the Line on Peaceful Transition to Socialism 
The second major shock to the CPI flowing from the 20th 
CPSU Congress was the Soviet formal enunciation of dicta on 
the non-inevitability of war and the possibility of a peace-
ful transition to socialism, coupled with the intimation that 
since it was vital to bloc interests to maintain India as a 
member of the intermediate "peace zone" of neutral states, 
India was one of the countries in which it was most urgent

for the Communist party not to assault the ruling national 
bourgeoisie directly, but rather to attempt to work for pow-
er peacefully,: and primarily through parliamentary methods. 
This Soviet line does not appear to have been fully an-
ticipated by the CPI; in March, immediately after the CPSU 
congress, all copies of documents previously distributed with-
in the party in preparation for the Indian congress were re-
portedly withdrawn from circulation, and the same month a 
battle over a new resolution incorporating the new line to be 
presented to the congress was fought at a central committee 
meeting between Ghosh and the leftist forces of Sundarayya* 
and Randdive. This battle was resumed at the April Palghat 
Congress itself, where Ghosh cautiously explained and defend-
ed the new Soviet thesis at some length. Eventually the mod-
erates won, and the congress adopted a line calling for de-
fense and support of all government actions both foreign and 
domestic which were deemed progressive, and criticism only of 
those particular actions deemed reactionary. The CPI pro-
claimed itself now a parliamentary "Party of Opposition in 
relation to the present Government" which had the duty of hold-
ing up to the people the prospect of an "alternative govern-
ment." In short,the Indian party formally set out to explore 
the possibilities of the parliamentary road to socialism, with-
out committing itself explicitly to the view that this road 
would necessarily prove successful and that all other paths 
would be foresaken. 
This much the CPSU was able to secure without an unusual 
degree of difficulty; but when in the summer of 1956 the So-
viet party published a two-part article in a prominent propa-
ganda outlet, the journal New Times, intimating that Nehru 
himself--given proper support by the CPI--would lead India to 
socialism, all but the extreme right wing of the CPI rebelled. 
The article, by Modeste Rubinstein, marked the greatest extent 
*Sundarayya was a CPI militant who had shared authority in 
the Andhra Provincial Committee with Rajeswar Rao during the 
Telengana days; by 1956, Rao had changed his views and shifted 
to the rightist faction in the party, so that henceforth he 
and Sundarayya led two gropps contending for control in the 
Andhra organization.

to which the soft line toward the Asian national bourgeoisie 
had ever been carried by the CPSU. Rubinstein cited without 
contradiction and praised the significance of the various en-
dorsements of "socialism" for India by Nehru and the Congress 
party; he hailed the growth of state capitalism in the Indian 
economy as a �progressive" factor (unlike state capitalism in 
the imperialist West), and added that the role of Indian state 
capitalism differed from the role of state capitalism'inLthe 
CPR only in that it was being used "consistently" to build so-
cialism by Peiping; he cited Lenin as saying that state capi-
talism is a step towards socialism, and suggested that other 
necessary steps would come with the growth of the state sector 
of the economy under Nehru's leadership; finally, he declared 
that "given close cooperation by all the progressive forces 
of the country, there is the possibility for India to develop 
along socialist lines," and that although India's "advance 
along the socialist path" would be slower than and would dif-
fer in many respects from that of "say, China," only dogmat-
ists would object to these peculiarities, which represented 
one of the "multiplicity of forms of socialist development." 
This essentially revisionist line was violently attacked 
by Ghosh in an article in the October 1956 issue of the monthly 
New Age, where Rubinstein's articles were also printed for 
comparison. Ghosh took umbrage at the Soviet writer's flat 
statement that the peaceful path to socialism "had been advo-
cated for many years by Jawaharlal Nehru," at his whitewashing 
of all of the "reactionary" side of the Indian government's 
policies, and particularly at Rubinstein's omission of all 
indication that the proletariat and the Communist party must 
lead the way to socialism. 
While the CPSU thereupon retreated somewhat, and never 
again espoused Rubinstein's rightist line quite so openly, it 
continued to enjoin CPI support for Nehru's "progressive" 
policies and CPI reliance primarily upon the peaceful and 
parliamentary path to power. Moreover, to the present day So-
viet journals (unlike those of Peiping) have continued to 
insist upon the "progressive" role of state capitalism in un-
derdeveloped countries such as India; and at least until the 
Sino-Soviet polemic of 1960 forced Moscow to harden its line 
somewhat to retain the support of the Communist movement, many 
Soviet statements continued to suggest ambiguously that the 
"socialist" inclinations of the national bourgeoisie of Asian

these countries into the bloc orbit.* 
Growing Chinese Opposition: There is some evidence to 
indicate that as the Soviet view of the national bourgeoisie

20th Party congress, Peiping objected, and that it was at 
this point that Chinese and Soviet policy berran tn na + ^^.

That same month--on 17 September 1956--Anastas Mikoyan 
addressed the Eighth Congress of the CCP in Peiping. In this 
speech Mikoyan paid warm tribute to the Chinese party and to 
"the distinguished Marxist-Leninist Mao Tse-tung" as having 
made a "major contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory;- and 
he declared that the Chinese had found "their own distinctive 
new forms and methods of building socialism." The major 
Marxist contribution and the distinctive new form which Mikoyan 
actually cited, however, was the Chinese alliance with the 
national bourgeoisie and the Chinese effort to move toward 
socialism through state capitalism. Later in his speech, 
Mikoyan dealt at length with Communist policy toward the un-
derdeveloped countries and their national bourgeois rulers; 
he quoted Lenin on the "new transitional forms and ways" 
these countries were seeking "to avoid the torments of capi-
talism," and he indicated in polemical language what those 
forms should be. Mikoyan declared that "we must not over-
look the fact" that the capitalist world is not homogenous, 
and the underdeveloped countries differ greatly, from the im-
perialist countries; and he insisted that "we must be able 
to see" the difference between state capitalism in India and

state capitalism in the United States. He held that "Marxists 
cannot but regard positively" the growth of state capitalism 
in the newly independent countries, he suggested that this 
was their "new transitional form" to avoid capitalism, and he 
argued that this was a factor promoting growing sympathy for 
"socialist ideas and slogans" in such countries. 
In short, the evidence suggests that Mikoyan praised the 
Chinese use of state capitalism and an alliance with the na-
tional bourgeoisie for the building of socialism under Commun-
ist control in China as justification for a sanguine Soviet 
attitude toward the growth of state capitalism in underdevelop-
ed Asian countries where the national bourgeoisie and not the 
Communist party was still in control. The evidence also sug-
gests that the Chinese objected to this distortion of their 
doctrine and experience to bolster policies the c 
dorse. This interpretation is supported   
lby the content of the Rubinstein article 
(which appeared a month before Mikoyan spoke), and by Chinese 
articles much later which denounced people who thought that 
under the leadership of the bourgeoisie one could "march into 
the period of socialism by way of state capitalism." 
Peng Chen at the Bucharest Conference in June 1960 "brought 
up the matter of Mikoyan at the Eighth Congress of the CCP, 
attacking Khrushchev," and that a heated exchange then fol-
lowed. 
The Indian party was represented at the September 1956 
Chinese party congress by the rightist Joshi,the Andhra left-
ist Sundarayya, and the Kerala moderate E.M.S. Namboodiripad. 
After attending Lthe congress they went to Moscow in early 
October, and late in the month returned to India to report to 
a politburo meeting on their travels. Information is gener-
ally lacking on what they were told regarding policy toward 
Nehru by the CCP and the CPSU, although one report does state 
that Chinese leaders at the party congress warned the Indian 
delegation that they must increase their efforts to organize 
the peasantry to avoid electoral losses, since Communist strength 
among urban groups was unreliable.

C. Formation of the Kerala Government and Its Aftermath 
The right-wing faction of the CPI favoring parliamentary 
tactics and a moderate approach to Nehru received a major wind-
fall in April 1957 when the Communist party was victorious in 
the elections in Kerala and proceeded to form a government in 
that state--the first time in the history of the world Commun-
ist movement that a Communist party had achieved even this 
limited degree of power through a parliamentary election. 
This event swung the controlling weight of opiniomVithin the 
CPI toward the moderates and kept it there for the next three 
years. The Kerala election also caused a wide stir in the 
international Communist movement, and in July 1957 a reliable 
report stated that Namboodiripad, the new Communist chief 
minister in Kerala, had been asked by the CPSU to forward a 
full report to Moscow on the methods used to attain power un-
der a bourgeois parliament. 
While the following of the CPI left faction was for the 
time being reduced by the Communist advent to power in Kerala, 
the consequences of this event only further infuriated the 
diehard party militants. Reports throughout 1957 told of the 
difficulties Namboodiripad was having in attempting to recon-
cile the demands of the party extremists with the need to keep 
up a "democratic" facade in Kerala; the militants wished him 
to put through radical party measures regardless of the con-
sequences, whereas Namboodiripad was concerned with the need 
to convince Nehru in New Delhi that the Kerala regime would 
not overstep certain moderate limits and therefore should not 
be pushed out of office. (Thus in October 1957 the party left-
ists in control of the Kerala peasant federation rejected a 
series of measures on land reform approved by the Communist 
ministry, in each case demanding that more radical steps be 
taken.) Even outside Kerala, the CPI found itself under un-
accustomej new restrictions, since it now could not agitate 
any issue which might undermine the Kerala government in its 
restrained course. The party could not, for example, demand

nationalization of industries without compensation, expropria-
tion of foreign assets, or other steps which the Kerala govern-
ment itself was unwilling to take.* 
November 1957 Moscow Meeting: The tensions created in 
the party by this situation were manifested at politburo and 
central committee meetings held' in October in preparation for 
the international Communist gathering in Moscow the following 
month. The central committee considered a document presented 
by Namboodiripad which alearly reflected the rightist influ-
ences brought to bear on him by the responsibilities of office. 
He espoused a "democratic and socialist" path to socialism--a 
policy "national in character and socialist in content." He 
advocated mild criticism of the Nehru government combined with 
full Communist cooperation with the government's Five-Year Plan 
programs He urged Communist trade unionsto cooperate with 
employers to find ways of increasing factory productivity, and 
even suggested that workers' wages should be increased only 
to a limited extent "so as to keep the wage bill below total 
output so that the savings thus effected could be diverted to 
finance the Plan."** The leftists, led by the West Bengali 
Bhupesh Gupta, of course objected to this strenuously; they 
attacked the concept of the "democratic path to socialism," 
and argued that the parliamentary road was essentially a non-
Marxist one which could be followed only under extraordinarily 
favorable conditions. The central committee reached no deci-
sion, and a delegation representing all factions was chosen 
to go to the 40th anniversary celebrations in Moscow. 
*The Communist regime in Kerala, in its anxiety to build 
up the state as an Indian showcase of Communist accomplish-
ments, actually was offering substantial inducements to some 
of the largest and most conservative Indian industrialists to 
bring capital into the state. 
**A similar proposal was incorporated in the rightist draft 
political resolution submitted to the Sixth CPI Congress in 
Arpil 1961, but was defeated by the leftist opposition at that 
congress.

At the Moscow meeting, the CPSU reportedly advised the 
CPI and other parties that they were now in a position to win 
elections, and should promote the progress of socialism through 
parliamentary means. At the same time, the Soviet party is 
said to have urged that each party build up a_strong under-
ground apparatus capable of waging armed struggle should this 
ever become necessary. Ghosh and at least some other_ members 
of his delegation are believed to have rejected this demand 
as unsuitable for the CPI, citing as reasons the failure of 
armed struggle in Telengana, the fact that the CPI had now com-
mitted itself to building a mass party, the difficulty of 
maintaining secrecy in such a party under Indian conditions, 
and the fact that party cadres were needed for parliamentary 
or mass work. The CPI delegation finally agreed to build 
direct contacts within the Indian army first, and then to 
consider the advisability of seeking a standby apparatus 
against the possibility of the need for armed struggle. 
In February 1958, an official of the Soviet Embassy in 
New Delhi is reported to have contacted CPI leaders to renew 
the request that the Indian party consider establishing an 
underground organization. Ghosh reportedly again refused, 
but the leftist leaders Sundarayya and Basavapunniah of Andhra 
and Surjit of the Punjab privately decided that Ghosh was 
taking a complacent and reformist line, and resolved to try 
to contact the CPSU again out of party channels. Sundarayya 
went to Moscow for a month in April to try to promote the 
cause Of the underground apparatus, but because of Ghosh's 
opposition, the leftist efforts were apparently blocked for 
some time. On the other hand, the CPI did apparently proceed 
to intensify the recruitment of a secret organization within 
the Indian armed forces. 
The CPI Amritsar Congress: What had apparently happened 
was that the CPSU by dint of continuous pressure upon the CPI 
over a period of several years, had finally induced the Indian 
party to accomplish a ponderous turnover in its thinking--a 
shift from actual armed struggle against the Nehru government, 
first to an attitude of militant hostility preparing for an 
imminent resumption of armed uprising, then to grudging partial 
support of Nehru and cautious testing of parliamentary tactics, 
and then to support of Nehru on many issues and broad reliance 
on parliamentary elections. Having wrought this massive change, 
it was not so easy for Moscow to get the CPI soon to introduce

_sEetrir 
into the new line an element firmly associated in the minds 
of the Indian leadership with their mistaken old line. 
This was particularly true since Moscow was far from 
wishing the CPI to abandon parliamentary tactics or the mod-
erate line toward Nehru generally. In late March 1958 Ilya 
Ehrenburg, in New Delhi for a World Peace Council meeting, 
was reported to have conveyed Soviet advice to the Indian 
party to continue to seek an alliance with and conciliation 
of the national bourgeoisie, and to refrain from posing 
excessive demands to them now which might tend to drive them 
into the Anglo-American camp. At the Fifth CPI Congress held 
at Amritsar a few weeks later, Ghosh took such a position, 
proposing that the CPI ally itself with democratic forces with-
in the Congress party to isolate and force the ouster from 
positions of power of the reactionary elements in that party. 
Several reports indicate that Ghosh was opposed at the Amritsar 
Congress again by a coalition of leftist forces headed by the 
West Bengal and Punjab organizations, and led personally once 
more by Ranadive, who had been readmitted to the central com-
mittee in 1956. In his speech to the congress, Ranadive is 
said to have opposed Ghosh's line toward the national bour-
geoisie and to have warned that "when the struggle enters the 
final stage the imperialists and the national bourgeoisie will 
unite to fight against our party." In the political resolution 
adopted by the congress,* Ghosh's line of cooperation with pro-
gressive forces within the Congress party (meaning principally 
*Aside from the passing of this resolution, one other event 
of some significance occurred at the Amritsar congress: the 
party adopted a new constitution in which the old Bolshevik 
names for party organs were replaced by names somewhat more 
congenial to the Indian scene. Thus the politburo became the 
central secretariat, and the central committee became the cen-
tral executive committee; in addition, a new large party organ 
--the national council--was established at a level between the 
central executive committee and the party congress. These and 
other changes formalized and further encouraged a decentraliza-
tion of authority in the party which had long existed in prac-
tice because of the strength of the provincial committees and 
the weakness of the party center.

Nehru) was accepted; the CPI made it clear, meanwhile, that 
it would continue to fight the reactionary sections of the 
Congress party in their strongholds in the Indian provinces. 
The CPI also made its most optimistic forecast to date on 
the chances of its coming to power by peaceful means; although 
it still did not explicitly disavow violence, and termed the 
success of the parliamentary road only a "possibility," the 
tone of the political resolution strongly suggested that this 
was an excellent possibility. The influence of the Kerala suc-
cess was strongly felt here: the resolution said that "the 
process begun in Kerala can be carried forward toward the 
establishment of alternative democratic governments in some 
other States," and that the Kerala victory had given the people 
"confidence" that the Congress party could eventually be de-
feated and replaced also in the center. This was the famous 
"Amritsar line," which was to be bitterly debated within the 
party in 1959 and 1960. 
Leftist Opposition Begins Turn Toward CCP: Throughout 
the latter half of 1958 left-faction opposition to the Amritsar 
line continued to grow. In a speech before a meeting of the 
Maharashtra Provincial Council in October 1958, Ranadive criti-
cized the Amritsar thesis as revisionist, referred to the pos-
sibility of world war, and visualized an "end to democracy" 
in India after Nehru's retirement or death, when the Indian 
Army, he thought, would take over the administration of the 
country. At about the same time, Indian journalists working 
for TASS in New Delhi reported that Chinese embassy officials 
there were most unhappy about the "basic leadership of the 
CPI and had grave doubts of the fidelity to Marxism of the 
Indian party; these Chinese officials were said to be parti-
cularly unhappy about the Kerala experiment and its influence 
on the CPI, and reportedly saw "no hope in the Nehru regime." 
These views were to be reiterated to CPI general secretary 
Ghosh by Mao and Chou personally during Ghosh's visit to Pei-
ping four months later after the 21st CPSU Congress. In view 
of this trend of thought among the Chinese leadership, CPI 
leftists who had long since become disillusioned with the CPSU 
and who had long deeply respected the CCP now began to turn 
toward Peiping for support in opposing the Amritsar line. In 
mid-November 1958, the Andhra leftist Basavapunniah was said 
to have commented to a colleague that he was "fed up" with the 
Soviets, and that he believed, even more strongly than he had

for some time, that the real source of inspiration for the 
CPI now was Communist China. Basavapunniah announced his 
intention to visit the CPR immediately after attending the 
21st CPSU Congress in January, and he planned to talk to 
Chinese leaders "as a disciple talks to his teacher."* 
Temporary Hardening of Soviet Line Toward Nehru: At about 
the same time, in the last quarter of 1958, there also occurred 
a temporary shift in emphasis in the Soviet line toward Nehru. 
This was apparently directly related to events in Kerala, where 
the Communist government had come into increasing difficulties, 
partly as the result of its own imprudent actions (such as 
the use of its police to fire on hostile demonstrators), and 
partly as the result of a continuing campaign which the Con-
gress party and its Kerala allies were waging to unseat the 
Communists. In early October the CPI central executive com-
mittee and national council for ten days seriously debated 
whether the Kerala government should be ordered to resign in 
order to extricate the party as a whole from its dilemilla. 
In the midst of these meetings, however, an obscure Moscow 
publication--the newspaper Vodnyy Transport (Water Transport)--
broke the total Soviet press silence of Kerala to run an 
"Observer" editorial discussing the campaign of "provocations" 
against the Kerala regime. This editorial ended by declaring 
that "in spite of all the tricks and slander, reaction in 
Kerala has not succeeded in causing the Communists to give up 
the course of selfless service to the people which they have 
set for themselves; the struggle in Kerala has not yet ended." 
It is difficult to think of any reason for a newspaper of this 
type to be alone in publishing an editorial such as this except 
as a discreet signal to the Indian party not to resign in 
Kerala; and in fact the CPI national council so decided. 
The difficulties of the Kerala government continued, how-
ever, and in mid-October Soviet officials in New Delhi, who 
reportedly had been very happy when the Kerala regime was form-
ed, were said to be becoming increasingly pessimistic on its

Congress as a CPI delegate, and is not believed to have visited

however.

prospects. At the end of October a junior-level Soviet embassy 
official was reported to be inquiring whether the Kerala gov-
ernment was becoming unpopular as a result of the police shoot-
ings there. 
In mid-December, the speaker at a Moscow public lecture 
referred to a drift to the right and a loss of popular sup-
port by Nehru and the Congress party; he alluded to certain 
mistaken Indian votes at the UN and to certain Indian govern-
ment "differences with the socialist countries," and he 
chastised the non-scientific notion of socialism Nehru had 
demonstrated in a recent article in the Indian Economic Re-
view. The speaker spoke of the CPI as a "large, open Commun-
ist party of growing strength," and stated that "in Kerala, 
where the Communists are in power, they are doing well." 
That same month an article in the international Communist 
journal Problems of Peace and Socialism by Pavel Yudin, the 
Soviet ambassador to the CPR, took Nehru to task for the state-
ments in his Economic Review article attacking the Communists 
as devotees of violence; Yudin made it clear that the Indian 
bourgeoisie would be responsible for any Communist resort to 
violence if it refused to allow power to pass peacefully into 
Communist hands. While this article may have been partly in-
tended to put pressure on the Nehru government to prevent it 
from swinging more decisively toward the West, its primary 
design seems to have been to attempt to induce Nehru not to 
dismiss the Kerala Ministry, while informing the CPI that it 
was permitted to build up mass struggles against the Nehru 
government to bolster its bargaining position. At the same 
time, Yudin intimated that the CPI should support Nehru 's 
"bourgeois state" against imperialism and feudalism, and thus 
indicated that no permanent change in line was intended. 
Within the CPI, the Yudin article was circulated among 
party units as a basis for discussion. Ranadive and his fol-
lowers immediately seized upon it triumphantly as justifica-
tion for their position, while such moderates as Dange, Joshi, 
and Namboodiripad criticized it (Namboodiripad did so publicly). 
Unlike the CCP's hardening of line toward Nehru, however, this 
CPSU shift at the close of 1958 was to prove most transitory, 
and by early the next year Moscow and Peiping were again taking 
increasingly divergent lines toward Nehru, with serious con-
sequences for the Indian party.

IV. MOSCOW-PEIPING POLARIZATION OF CPI BEGINS: 1959 
In 1959 the CPI for the first time became gravely af-
fected by the growing differences between the Soviet and 
ChineSe,postures.toward the "imperialist" world, their at-
titudes toward the ruling national bourgeoisie of under-
developed countries, and their views on the most appropriate 
means of Communist assumption of power. The gap between 
the CPSU and the CCP on each of these issues, which had 
been alternately expanding and contracting in previous 
years, suddenly widened greatly. This was partly the re-
sult of events over which neither party had control: the 
Tibetan revolt, Nehru's decision to oust the Communist 
government in Kerala, Washington's decision to invite Khru-
shchev to the United States. It was also, however, the 
result of a conscious turning to the right by. the CPSU and 
to the left by the CCP. On Moscow's side, there was an 
apparent decision taken in January 1959 to abandon the strong-
er tone used toward Nehru in the fall of 1958 and to bear 
with this bourgeois nationalist leader for' a considerable 
distance: this resulted first in peremptory CPSU retraint 
of the CPI with respect to Nehru's ouster ,of the Kerala gov-
ernment, and later in the earnest Soviet effort to convince 
Nehru of.Soviet.friendship during the Sino-Indian border 
dispute. On the Chinese side, there was instead a harden-
ing of attitude toward Nehru at the very beginning of the 
year, which helped to determine Peiping's later response 
to events in Kerala and to the border dispute. Khrushchev 
in the fall of 1959 adopted the softest line toward the 
West generally he had eVer'ipUblicly Voiced, in the after-
math of his visit to the United States, while Peiping grew 
increasingly shrill in its warnings against Western treach-
ery and in contradiction of the Soviet line. Against this 
background of increasingly divergent policies, the CCP in 
1959 for the first time began to take a more aggressive at-
titude toward promoting its viewpoint among sympathetic 
sections of the CPI.

other CPI leaders--Ranadive and the West Bengali Joly Kaul--
had been scheduled to go to Moscow, but were denied pass-
ports by the government of India, presumably because New 
Delhi was anxious to prevent the left wing of the CPI from 
making direct contact with high-ranking Soviet leaders. 
While in Moscow, Ghosh had private conversations on CPI 
policy with Suslov and possibly other Soviet leaders, 
while Kerala Chief Minister Namboodiripad, another member 
of the delegation, had prolonged talks With Mikoyan on pos-
sibilities for the expansion of Indian trade ties with the 
bloc. On 9 February, upon the close of the congress, Ghosh 
went to Peiping, where he is reported to have had talks with 
Mao and Chou. 
In subsequent conversations with other CPI leaders, and 
in his report to the Central Executive Committee in late 
February, Ghosh depicted the Soviets and the Chinese as hav-
ing given him similar advice on two points. Both were said 
to be concerned with the increasing danger of right-wing 
military coups in the Middle East and Asia, and with the 
possibility of such a coup taking place in India; both 
parties were said to have insisted that to meet this threat 
the CPI must develop a standby apparatus capable of armed 
resistance, or at least the cadre of an underground party, 
while intensifying efforts to penetrate the Indian military 
forces. Suslov is also reported to have questioned the 
ambiguous CPI agrarian policy; while conceding that the 
Indian party could not now take a line advocating collec-
tive and state farms, he suggested thatit emphasize volun-
tary cooperative farming. Mao: and Chou were said to have 
later concurred. 
On one central point, however--the line to be taken to-
ward Nehru--a sharp divergence between the Soviet and the 
Chinese positions was reported by Ghosh. He found the So-
viets in early February almost apologetic about the Yudin 
article of December 1958--which had implied a firm attitude 
toward Nehru--and unwilling now to endorse the article as a 
guide to CPI policy. Instead, the CPSU leaders were said 
to have suggested vaguely that the CPI should take a public 
position agreeing with Nehru whenever it could and opposing 
him only when it must--in other words, that the CPI should 
emphasize areas of agreement with Nehru and minimize areas 
of disagreement. The Chinese, on the other hand, were said 
to have expressed emphatic approval of the line taken in the

Yudin article, and to have urged that it be vigorously fol-
lowed up by the CPI, that the Indian party stop mollycoddl-
ing Nehru. The CCP leaders were reported to have condemned 
the "revisionism" they found rampant in the CPI, exemplified 
by the opposition within the party to the establishment of 
a strong underground apparatus for armed action. Peiping 
is also said to have told Ghosh that the influence of the 
Kerala CP--and the parliamentary line identified with it--
was "far too strong" upon the Indian party as a whole. 
The positions here attributed to the Soviet and Chinese 
parties in February 1959 are completely consistent with the 
way each reacted to events later in the year. Moreover, good 
evidence exists on the Soviet side to confirm a modification 
in the Soviet line on Nehru at the beginning of 1959. On 20 
February, two weeks after the close of the CPSU congress, in 
a public lecture on the CPI in Moscow the speaker severely 
condemned the leftist mistakes made by the Indian party in 
the insurrectionary Ranadive period; warmly praised the gradu-
alist program of the Amritsar Congress at great length, hail-
ing Ghosh and Namboodiripad as the architects of that program; 
declared that it was only "since the Amritsar Congress" that 
the CPI had become a "truly mass party;" and expressed the 
�view that CPI parliamentary majorities similar to that in 
Kerala were soon to be expected in West Bengal and Andhra. 
Most notably, the lecturer was evasive and noncommital in 
responding to a question from the floor on the significance 
of the Yudin article--in contrast to the forthright criticism 
of Nehru expressed in a similar Moscow lecture in mid-December 
1958. Since these lectures are organized by a "society" 
supervised closely (and particularly so in Moscow) by a 
section of the CPSU Central Committee, it is likely that the 
differences between them reflected a real shift in party 
policy. 
One result of this divergence between the Soviet and Chi-
nese lines on Nehru in early 1959 was to intensify factional 
differences within the CPI and while not yet jeopardizing 
CPSU control of the CPI, to make some of the left-faction 
leaders increasingly aware that Peiping was a more reliable 
bulwark for their position than Moscow. One report in March 
stated that the party leftists, overjoyed at the original 
appearance of the Yudin article, were continuing to rely on 
it as vindication for their stand against the Amritsar thesis, 
whereas the moderates led by Ghosh were opposed to the line 
- 49 -

Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
taken by Yudin in part because they knew that Yudin's formu-
lations "did not enjoy the decisive blessings of Moscow." 
The leftist Basavapundah, who had in the past already shown 
signs of private disenchantment with the CPSU and enthusiasm 
for the CCP, complained to a friend in mid-February that the 
compliments paid Nehru in the published speeches at the 21st 
CPSU Congress were "ill-advised and unfortunate," because 
these "gratuitous compliments" would undo much of the good 
Basavapunfflah thought had been done by the Yudin article. 
(BasavapundAh was here alluding to the speech of Khrushchev, 
who hailed Nehru and his government in connection with the 
completion of the Bhilai steel plant, and particularly to 
that of Mukhitdinov, who gave the "progressive forces of 
India"--the Communist party--only secondary credit for India's 
economic and foreign policy achievements, giving primary 
credit to "the farsighted policy of the outstanding states-
man of the East, Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.") 
Basavapuntah went on to regret that during Ghosh's visit to 
Peiping the Chinese had been unable to talk him out of his 
soft policy toward Nehru, and lamented that "perhaps it is 
too much to hope for" � that the Chinese could "put some 
sense into Ghosh's head." 
Although there is little evidence to determine why Mos-
cow softened its line on Nehru once more in January 1959, it 
is possible that this decision was connected with the deci-
sions of the Nagpur meeting of the Indian Congress Party in 
that month, when the left wing of the party backed by Nehru 
pushed through a strongly worded resolution supporting land 
reform. (Basavapuntah in February expressed the fear that 
the results of this Congress Party meeting would induce 
Ghosh to swing to the right.) It also appears possible, how-
ever, that the decision to relax pressure on Nehru was in 
some way related to a broader CPSU decision taken at this 
time to pursue more actively the "peaceful coexistence" 
strategy against the Western world; the first concrete mani-
festation of such a broad decision was Mikoyan's self-in-
vited exploratory trip to the United States in early January, 
and the second was Khrushchev's enunciation, at the end of 
that month, of the 21st Congress thesis that wars, besides 
not being inevitable, could even be eliminated from the life 
of society while capitalism remains.

B. The Fall of the Kerala Government (January-July 1959) 
The unsuccessful efforts said to have been made by the 
CCP leaders in February to dissuade Ghosh from following the 
moderate line furnished him in Moscow constitute the first 
example of such direct Chinese interference in Soviet direction 
of the Indian party ever reported.* It is credible that 
Peiping should have begun such efforts at this time, since 
it was precisely in this period following the 21st CPSU Con-
gress that the CCP is known to have begun strenuous attempts 
to strengthen its influence throughout the world Communist 
movement. In addition to the Indians, party leaders from 
Latin America, Japan, Indonesia, and even Italy are known to 
have consulted with the CCP in Peiping in the spring of 1959. 
The Italians--the first delegation of Italian Communists 
ever to come specifically for an exchange of views with the 
Chinese party--arrived in Peiping in April and remained for 
May Day; according to one unconfirmed report, they were told 
by Mao Tse-tung of his determination to win Moscow's recogni-
tion of a special role for China in gpiding the "struggle" of 
the Asian peoples. As has been noted, the Soviets were reli-
ably reported to have ascribed such intentions to Mao as early 
as September 1956; and a third report was to depict Mao as 
hinting at the same point to Ghosh in October 1959. 
It should be noted, however, that there is no available 
evidence that as of the spring of 1959 the CCP had yet at-
tempted to bypass the CPI central, pro-Soviet Ghosh leader-
ship and to establish direct links with left-faction elements 
sympathetic to Peiping's viewpoint. This was to happen in 
the fall of 1959, as the result of a continued polarization 
of the CPI and a growing estrangement between the Ghosh lead-
ership and Peiping. 
*There is no evidence that the Andhra party's citation of 
Chinese authority in preference to Soviet authority in its 
battle against Ranadive in 1948 was prompted by direct con-
tacts with the CCP; and the advice which the CCP did give to 
CPI leaders at the Chinese Eighth Party Congress in 1956 was 
not in open conflict with a known Soviet line.

In the the meantime, left-faction Indian Communist leaders 
had begun to pursue more aggressively policies independent 
of Chinese guidance but parallel to Chinese attitudes. As 
the Communist position in Kerala grew more precarious in the 
first months of 1959, Ranadive took the offensive: at a 
CPI Central Secretariat meeting in New Delhi before the 21st 
CPSU Congress, he urged a radical review of CPI policy, argu-
ing that a Communist government in an isolated province such 
as Kerala would always be in trouble unless the party left 
the defensive and adopted an aggressive program of action 
throughout the country sabotaging the working of the Congress 
government. No decision was taken by the Secretariat, and 
Ranadive's line was apparently rejected in the Moscow consul-
tations. On 12 March, Ranadive wrote a letter to Ghosh 
reiterating his views; he warned that Kerala would be the 
graveyard of the CPI unless the needs of the party were given 
priority over the desire of the parliamentary government in 
Kerala to remain in office, and recommended that if the 
Kerala regime were threatened with ouster by an opposition 
combination, the party should retaliate by posing a nation-
wide threat of upheaval. This line was again advanced by 
Ranadive and other leftists at a Central Executive Committee 
in May, where the left faction severely attacked the report 
on Kerala delivered by Namboodiripad. 
As the campaign of the Kerala opposition to oust the 
Communist government grew stronger in June and July, and it 
began to appear more likely that Nehru would eventually yield 
to entreaties to suspend the Kerala government, recrimina-
tions began to multiply within the cpr, With leftistt-posJtions 
gaining as the situation worsened. In early July, Namboodiripad 
and Kerala party secretary Nair held negotiations with Nehru 
over a Kerala settlement; the Indian Prime Minister demanded 
new elections and Communist acceptance of a coalition caretaker 
government with the opposition included until the elections 
were held. A draft agreement along these lines was submitted 
by Namboodiripad to a National Council meeting in mid-July, 
which rejected it, in part because Nair maintained that the 
CPI probably could not win new elections at this time in 
Kerala, and would be better off exploiting the martyrdom of 
outright removal by the central government. Having killed 
Namboodiripad's agreement with Nehru; the National Council 
gave consideration to the tactics to be adopted in the likely 
event of the dismissal of the Kerala government. According

__szeitrir 
to one report, while no one openly demanded the explicit 
public repudiation of the Amritsar thesis, many of the 
speakers--and not only the leftists--thought the party 
would have to consider seriously whether it could continue 
to rely upon parliamentary tactics. The leftist Sundarayya 
said that the party had been drifting to the right since 
the Palghat Congress and should never have committed itself 
to any one definite method of seeking power. Other leftists 
at this time reacted even more strongly; at a West Bengal 
party meeting late in July, one leader gloomily predicted 
the quick advent of fascism,rmilitary despotism, and at-
tempted suppression of the CPI. Rightist CPI leaders as-
sociated with'Ahe conciliation of Nehru were somewhat more 
cautious in their reaction. At the mid-July National Council 
meeting, the rightists Ahmed, Joshi and Dange thought the 
Congress Party was killing "democracy" in Kerala, but never-
theless felt it would be good tactics for the party to con-
tinue to repeat publicly the slogan of peaceful, parliamentary 
transition to socialism. A similar moderate qualification 
was reported to have been inserted by Ghosh into a speech he 
gave to Party Headquarters Unit in New Delhi on 27 July; this 
private talk nevertheless marked the furthest swing to the 
left by Ghosh in several years. Ghosh was reported to have 
acknowledged that the parliamentary line and the Amritsar 
thesis were errors, and had been proved so by Kerala; he 
admitted that revisionism and reformism had made grave in-
roads into the party, and that he himself had fallen prey to 
them; nevertheless, he said, the party must still avoid the 
danger of left adventurism, of taking up arms and thereby 
losing the support of sympathetic "democratic" elements. 
Therefore, he proposed that the CPI continue to state "out-
wardly" that the Amritsar thesis still applied, while in 
fact returning to its earlier attitude of refusing to place 
firm reliance on parliamentary tactics. 
At this point, with the CPI in turmoil and extreme re-
actions to the Kerala events by some of the more militant 
provincial party organizations a good possibility, a CPI 
leader returned to New Delhi from Moscow on 28 July with 
a CPSU letter for Ghosh. The letter was reported to urge 
that the CPI should not break the law, that it should take 
no action which could result in the spreading of "fascism," 
that it should not be provoked into violence "but should 
follow democratic means and come to power throughout India 
state by state." The letter added, somewhat defensively,

that the CPSU "expects that the CPI will not differ from the 
CPSU's opinion when it judges the Indian political situation 
/1-5-oth7 objectively and subjectively." That same evening a 
ipecial Secretariat meeting was called to discuss the letter, 
and decided that the CPI would not abandon the Amritsar 
thesis (at least publicly), would not launch a violent anti-
government movement, and would not boycott future elections. 
On 31 July, three days later, the Indian government removed 
the Kerala Communist regime. The next day, West Bengal 
secretary Jyoti Basu, having returned to Calcutta from the 
New Delhi meeting, called a special meeting of the West Bengal 
Provincial Committee to halt preparations for a general 
strike which had been planned as retaliation for the expected 
Kerala government ouster. This response from the stronghold 
of the CPI militants--in contrast to the disobedient stand 
taken by the West Bengal party the following year--demonstrated 
that in mid-1959 the CPSU still retained the capacity to 
exert operational control over all sections of the Indian 
party when necessary. 
From 6 to 8 August the Central Executive Committee met 
to consider the new CPI strategy in the light of the latest 
Soviet instructions. The leftists Sundarayya, Basavapunniab, 
Bhupesh Gupta and Ranadive urged a review and change of party 
policy; Gupta also proposed a revival of the CPI illegal ap-
paratus to be run from the party secretariat, completely in-
sulated from the overt party. Ghosh was reported to have 
pleaded for patience and the deferring of Gupta's proposal 
until after the Kerala elections scheduled for the fall. At 
this time, the Ranadive group was said to have resolved pri-
vately to attempt to dislodge the moderates from control of 
the CPI and to secure full abandonmentof'the Amritsar line 
if the CPI should be defeated in the Kerala elections; mean-
while, mo overt attempt was to be made to displace Ghosh, 
since the leftists realized that Moscow's endorsement of 
their program was a prerequisite which could not be immediately 
secured. Accordingly, following the line taken by Ghosh in 
a public statement on 2 August (when he stated that he would 
not draw the general inference from Kerala that Nehru had 
ceased to be a progressive force), the rentral Executive Com-
mittee meeting agreed not to attack Nehru publicly except on 
the specific issue of Kerala, lest speculation that the 
Amritsar thesis had been abandoned be encouraged. A fairly 
moderate public resolution on the Kerala ouster was adopted,

-SWEET 
and the meeting decided to send Ghosh to Moscow later in the 
month to appraise Khrushchev of the details of the interven-
tion in Kerala. 
One of the primary goals sought by the CPI after the 
July 1959 events was the cultivation of sympathy over the 
Kerala events from both the public generally and the left 
wing of the Congress Party in particular. Ghosh placed 
hope in the considerable group of influential Congressmen 
who did not approve of the Government's intervention in 
Kerala; this group was counted on to bring pressure on 
Nehru to soften his hostility toward the Communist party. 
In several of his subsequent complaints against the CCP, 
Ghosh was to claim that this CPI strategy was working well--
that a wave of popular sympathy was attracting mass sup-
port for the party, splitting the Congress Party, and turn-
ing the Kerala events into a pyrrhic victory for the reac-
tionaries and a strategic gain for the Communists--when 
suddenly all this was ruined and the tide of popular opinion 
turned against the party by the outbreak of the Sino-Indian 
border dispute. While much of this argument is polemical 
exaggeration and rationalization on Ghosh's part, it does 
seem likely that the CPI would have emerged from the Kerala 
crisis with comparatively little damage to its national base 
of popular support had the border conflict not intervened. 
C. The Tibetan Revolt 
There is considerable evidence to indicate that just as 
the surfacing of the Sino-Indian border dispute in the fall 
of 1959 had its origin in events connected with the Tibetan 
revolt in the spring, so also the emergence of public Sino-
Soviet differences in line over the border issue in the fall 
was preceded by more subtle differences over the Tibetan 
issue months before. 
In the beginning, this was not so: the two bloc partners 
made an apparently coordinated initial announcement of the 
Tibetan revolt on 28 March, and Moscow twice in early April 
repeated in radio commentaries Peiping's claims that Kalimpong, 
in northern West Bengal, had been used as a base for the 
Tibetan rebels, despite Nehru's public denial of this charge

on 30 March. Subsequently, however, the USSR suppressed from 
its public coverage all such charges against India, and excised 
hostile references to India from reports on CPR articles or 
speeches carried in Soviet media. Moscow limited the blame 
for the uprising to Tibetan reactionaries, Western imperial-
ism, and Chiang Kai-shek. Peiping, on the other hand, continued 
to repeat its statements about Kalimpong, together with public 
attacks against Indian "reactionaries" and "expansionists" 
for their sympathy and alleged aid to the rebels. By late 
April, after strong criticism of the CPR had been voiced by 
the Indian press and in the Indian Parliament, Peiping ex-
panded its attacks into a concerted mass campaign in which 
the Indian Government was repeatedly implicated in the revolt 
and in the "abduction" of the Dalai Lama. Personal denuncia-
tions of Nehru at nationwide mass meetings in early May cul-
minated in a 6 May People's Daily editorial article reprov-
ing Nehru's attitude toward Tibet, renewing charges of Indian 
interference there, and suggesting that Nehru, while often 
differing with the "imperialists," nevertheless was also some-
times strongly influenced in his policies by the Indian "big 
bourgeoisie" tied to imperialism. This article did, however, 
signal a momentary end to CPR polemics on the issue, 
The CPI throughout this period adopted a public attitude 
strongly defending Peiping, but not usually going beyond the 
limits of the Soviet treatment of Nehru. On 5 April--when the 
Soviet line blacking out all references to Kalimpong had not 
yet been clearly established--the weekly CPI organ New Age 
ran an article urging an investigation of activities in this 
border town, as well as a CPI Secretariat resolution suggesting 
the same point. The same issue carried the text of the let-
ters released by Peiping to prove that the Dalai Lama had 
been taken to India under duress, as well as several other 
articles strongly backing the PLA action in Tibet and denounc-
ing Western imperialism's attempt to split India and China. 
After this--in line with the Soviet example--charges about 
Kalimpong are not known to have been featured in CPI media, 
but Indian party organs and spokesmen continued to defend 
Peiping, and their statements were regularly picked up by 
NCNA. The closest approach to direct criticism of Nehru in 
these statements appeared in an article by Ghosh in early 
May, where Ghosh complained that some of the Prime Minister's 
statements were "heavily biased in favor of the rebels," and 
denied that all of India's conduct during the rebellion had 
been unimpeachable or that "all the blame lies with the Chinese."

Along with this rather mixed defense of Peiping, Ghosh express-
ed pleasure that Nehru had "indignantly rejected" the crude 
attempts of the imperialists to change India's independent 
foreign policy. The CPI secretary showed great defensiveness 
over Nehru's reaction to the Chinese charge of "expansionism," 
professing to believe that this charge had not been intended 
against Nehru or the Indian government, but only against "cer-
tain reactionary circles in India." In later communications 
and contacts with Chinese leaders both in 1959 and in 1960, 
Ghosh is known to have repeatedly protested against the un-
wisdom of these Chinese intimations that the Indian govern-
ment was "expansionist" and against the harm this brought 
to the Communist cause in India. 
Details are available on only one reported meeting between 
representatives of the  CPI and the CCP during this period of 
the Tibetan uprising. (b)(1) 
early in April CPR ambassador to New Delhi Pan Tzu-li. request- (b)(3) 
ed a meeting with Ranadive to receive information on the at-
titude toward the Tibetan situation being taken by both the 
government of India and the CPI. On receiving this request, 
the CPI Central Secretariat authorized Ranadive to meet Pan, 
although the CPI had previously designated Joshi as the liai-
son man with the Chinese Embassy. Peiping was thus not yet 
attempting to bypass central Indian party channels, as it was 
to do later in contacting left-faction leaders. Ranadive in 
his talk 7 with Pan is reported to have offered him the CPI's 
support on Tibet, but to have kept within the bounds of So-
viet policy on this issue, advising Pan not to attack Nehru 
directly but to concentrate fire on the leading rightist anti-
Chinese leaders in India. Although Ranadive the following 
month was to write an article implying that the Indian govern-
ment was intervening in Chinese affairs by allowing the Dalai 
Lama to operate in India, his line toward Nehru was neverthe-
less fairly restrained and did mot notably depart from that 
used by other CPI leaders in this period; the CPI leftists 
generally did not publicly take a line sharply differentiated 
from that of other party leaders on relations with China un-
til Soviet differences with Peiping on the border issue came 
into the open in September. 
(b)(3) 
Although it has been reported that Ranadive's meeting with 
Pan was the only CPI contact with the CCP until August, there 
is some reason to suspect that this was not so, that the CPI 
leadership was in communication with Chinese representatives

some time in May or June�perhaps again orally via the Chinese 
Embassy--and that the CPI at this time urged Peiping to pro-
pose a meeting between Nehru and Chou En-lai to smooth over 
Sino-Indian differences over the Tibetan events. While there 
was no hint in Soviet or CPI white propaganda media during 
this period that the CPSU was then anxious for a Nehru-Chou 
meeting, this was hardly surprising in View of the exceed-
ingly delicate nature of the matter, since the CPR public 
position was that events in Tibet were of no concern what-
ever to India. Indirect confirmation of such a Soviet de-
sire was, however, available from another source: the con-
duct of the Indian weekly tabloid Blitz, which is not con-
trolled by the CPI (and has, indeed, criticized the Indian 
party on occasion), but which is thought'to be partly subsidiied 
by Soviet intelligence and which has many times shown itselt 
to be more intimately responsive to Soviet foreign policy aims 
and maneuvers than Communist party organs. Blitz began its 
coverage of the Tibetan revolt, like the ComErhirit New Age, 
with an almost identical article complaining about the anti-
Chinese intrigues' in Kalimpong, and similarly soft-pedalled 
this point thereafter (though it did not drop it completely) 
as the Soviet press fell silent about Kalimpong. Blitz there-
upon carried articles supporting Sino-Indian friendship and 
denouncing U.S. attempts to exploit the Tibetan revolt to 
undermine Nehru's "independent" foreign policy; these articles 
were regularly cited by NCNA, the Chinese News Agency. On 25 
April, however, Blitz also published an open letter to Chou 
En-lai urging the convening of a tripartite conference of 
India, China and Tibet on an informal basis to assure the 
"continued friendship between India and China". Although an 
NCNA dispatch the next day termed this a "nonsensical sug-
gestion," Blitz reiterated it a week later, noting that "the 
Chinese would not like a meeting between India and China over 
Tibet" since Peiping does not "consider Tibet an independent 
state," but nevertheless insisting that "there are all-com-
pelling reasons for a meeting between India and China." 
D. The Border Dispute  
If the Soviet Union did indeed try to recommend a Sino-
Indian meeting to Peiping--however cautiously and indirectly--
this is likely only to have increased CCP resentment and sub-
sequent Chinese intransigence. In the light of the almost

simultaneous events in Tibet and Kerala, Soviet policy appeared 
to Peiping to be growing increasingly concilatory toward Nehru 
as the latter swung ever further toward the right; the USSR 
seemed to be attempting to buy off Nehru, at the expense of 
fundamental Communist interests and Chinese national interests. 
This Soviet line of unprincipled conciliation--in Chinese 
eyes--was subsequently seen to be extended to the imperialist 
world as a whole when Klerushchev's visit to the United States 
was announced in August and accomplished in September and as 
Soviet emphasis upon the need for "mutual concessions" mount-
ed in the early fall. Chinese propaganda was to grow Increas-
ingly shrill throughout the fall in denunciation of such 
naive acceptance of imperial/Mc "peace gestures." Therefore, 
while the initial border clashes with Indian troops may well 
have been unpremediated in Peiping and the result of actions 
for which New Delhi was partly responsible, subsequent CCP 
policy toward the border dispute--and equally toward the CPI--
was certainly strongly conditioned by the growing dispute 
with the CPSU over world-wide policy, as well as by Peiping's 
rigid conception of its national interest and its hardening 
attitude toward Nehru. 
The juxtaposition of significant Chinese and Indian forces 
on the border in many places for the first time seems to have 
resulted directly from the Tibetan revolt. On the Chinese side, 
there was a determination to seal off the Tibetan-Indian bor-
der, both to prevent the further escape of Tibetan rebels and 
to cut off that aid to the rebels which Peiping believed was 
being furnished from the Indian side of the border. On the 
Indian side, the alarm felt at the entry of much larger PLA 
forces into Tibet generally and at the Chinese effort to 
establish a much stronger presence than ever before in bor-
der areas which had long been in dispute seem to have prompt-
ed New Delhi to attempt to build up an appropriate counter-
presence along the border. Clashes began to occur both at 
the eastern and western ends of the frontier in late July and� 
early August, in each case as the result of Chinese offensive 
action to enforce their concept of the border. While the 
Indian government continued to withhold confirmation of these 
clashes until late in August, rumors earlier began to appear 
in the Indian press, and the border problem became an object 
of anxious concern at the CPI Central Executive Committee meet-
ing held from 6 to 8 August. 
the CEC then decided to address a letter to the Chinese party 
on the whole question of Sino-Indian relations. Said to have

_azetrr 
been drafted jointly by Ghosh and Ranadive, the letter was 
delivered to the Chinese Embassy during the second week of 
August. The letter reportedly described the emotions aroused 
among the Indian populatipn over the Tibetan issue and over 
the undemarcated Sino-Indian border, particularly in view 
of the Chinese refusal to clarify their stand on older Chi-
nese maps claiming areas regarded by India as belonging to 
her. (Nehru had alluded to these maps in a press conference 
in the first week of August.) The letter is said to have 
deprecated the Chinese indiscriminate use of the terms 
"Indian imperialists" and "Indian expansionists", and to 
have urged that only specific groups such as the Praja So-
cialist and Jan Sangh parties be singled out for attack (as 
Ranadive had suggested to Ambassador Pan in April). The 
letter regretted the Chinese attitude shown toward certain 
Indian front meetings in recent months, such as the All-
Indian Conference for Afro-Asian Solidarity in Calcutta in 
April (when the Chinese walked out from a discussion of 
Tibet) and the 28 June Panch_ Sheel celebrations sponsored 
by the All-Indian Peace Council and attended by many inter-
national representatives (the invitation to which was ignored 
by Peiping). Finally, the letter urged the CCP to contact 
the Indian Ambassador in Peiping to arrange a meeting between 
Nehru and Chou to settle Sino-Indian differences. 
This letter was never answered by the CCP. It is pos-
sible that it was from this point on that Peiping began to 
classify Ghosh among the hopelessly lost souls along with 
Nehru,and began to concentrate efforts on promoting its 
point of view among sympathetic provincial CPI organizations 
such as that in West Bengal. Reports of such Chinese efforts 
began to appear during the following months. 
In the meantime, rightist-inclined provincial party 
organizations, such as the one in Maharagitra, had begun their 
long swing in the other direction; the first sign of this 
occurred on 23 August, when Dange told the Maharashtra Pro-
vincial Executive Committee in Bombay that the CPI should 
state openly that the MacMahon line is the valid border in 
the east. 
On 26 August, Ghosh departed on his visit to the USSR. 
On that day and the day before, Chinese troops had made two 
additional attacks on Indian posts in the eastern border area

_$E.efEff 
(the Northeast Frontier Agency). On the 28th, Nehru for the 
first time made a statement in Parliament substantiating the 
press reports of such Chinese incursions and armed clashes. 
This statement inflamed Indian public opinion; according to 
a private comment that day by the chief of the Communist 
Indian Press Agency, it confused and staggered the CPI. Dur-
ing the next two days the CPI Central Secretariat, minus 
Ghosh, held an emergency meeting on the problem, following 
which the party issued the first in what was to be a long and 
varied series of statements on the border, a vague declara-
tion glossing over the question of border violations, hold-
ing (as the Chinese were to do) that the entire border has 
never been defined, making no mention of the MacMahon line, 
and urgently calling for negotiations. The CPI subsequently 
came under wide public attack as a result of its failure in 
this statement to take a clear-cut stand supporting the In-
dian government position. 
September Talks in Moscow and Peiping: On 30 August, 
the Indian Government is reported to have asked its ambassa-
dor in Moscow to present India's case to Khrushchev personal-
ly. By early September there were therefore two sets of In-
dians in Moscow trying, for different reasons, to get the 
Soviets to apply pressure on Peiping: the Indian Embassy, 
and CPI representative Ghosh. There is every indication that 
the CPSU leaders, seriously disturbed for several reasons by 
the effects of the Indian border crisis, were prepared to 
apply such pressure through a variety of channels. According 
to one unconfirmed report, a Polish Deputy Premier told Yugo-
slav representatives in Belgrade in late August that the Chi-
nese action on the border had been neither initiated nor 
supported by Moscow, and added that Moscow was aware that 
splits long latent in the CPI were being aggravated as a re-
sult of the Chinese attitude. Moscow, claimed the Polish 
official, had informed the CPI that it entirely disapproved 
of Peiping's actions, and this CPSU comment was itself further 
intensifying CPI factionalism. While it is barely possible 
that such a message could have been delivered to CPI head-
quarters late in August, there is no confirmation of it from 
the Indian side; more important, it is doubtful from subsequ-
ent CPSU conduct that it would have risked further exacerba-
tion of CPI factionalism in this way. On the other hand, there 
is little doubt that the CPSU told its trusted man Ghosh some-
thing of this sort in Moscow. On 3 September Ghosh, apparently

after consultation with CPSU leaders, sent to Peiping from 
Moscow another CPI letter asking the Chinese party again to 
initiate high-level negotiations with India, and to shape 
its policy with a view to keeping India out of the imperial-
ist camp. This letter also went unanswered. That same day 
a note from Peiping to the Indian government accused India 
of "aggression" along the border and demanded withdrawal of 
Indian troops from the disputed areas. On the 6th, in a 
banquet speech before a visiting Afghan official in Peiping, 
Chou En-lai hinted at a possible link between Khrushchev's 
impending visit to the United States and Chinese policy to-
ward India. While "reiterating the Chinese people's welcome" 
to the forthcoming Khrushchev-Eisenhower exchange of visits, 
Chou added that "however, we cannot but note that the im-
perialists are stepping up the creation of tension in the 
Far East and sowing discord in relations among the Asian and 
African countries," and concluded that this required "the 
governments and peoples of all Asian and African countries" 
to continue to manifest "sharp vigilance"--in other words, 
to maintain an undiminished militant posture. (Emphasis added.) 
On the morning of 6 September, Ghosh flew to the Crimea, 
where Khrushchev was preparing for his trip to the United 
States, and remained there in consultation with Khrushchev 
for three days. at one time during (W(1) 
this period Ghosh attended a joint meeting with Khrushchev (b)(3) 
and some Chinese representative, at which Khrushchev expressed 
his unhappiness over the course of events on the Indian bor-
der and warned of the harmful effects this could have upon 
Asian nationalism generally. While this is unconfirmed, it 
is entirely likely that the CPSU was in direct communication 
with the CCP over the border situation at this time; if so, 
the results for Moscow were unsatisfactory. On 8 September, 
Chou En-lai dispatched another letter to Nehru, professing 
willingness to have the border dispute subjected to negotia-
tions, but making no specific proposal for a meeting with 
Nehru. Chou reiterated all Chinese claims to disputed ter-
ritory, and specifically rejected the validity of the MacMahon 
line in the east. He also charged that Indian troops were 
guilty of "armed attacks" on Chinese frontier outposts. That 
same evening, Ghosh returned to Moscow, and the next day the 
Soviet government issued a special TASS announcement deplor-
ing the clashes on the Sino-Indian border, urging a negotiated 
settlement, and taking a conspicuously neutral stand on the

(b)(3)

Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
....s�Reserr 
merits of the conflicting claims. It seems likely that this 
announcement was decided on during the Khrushchev-Ghosh talks, 
and was finally triggered by the unyielding stand taken by 
Chou in his 8 September letter. 
There is abundant subsequent evidence that the 9 Septem-
ber TASS statement was deeply resented by the CC?, was re-
garded (despite its air of neutrality) as humiliating "open 
criticism" of the Chinese party by a paternalistic CPSU, and 
was thought to be a Soviet betrayal of an obligation to sup-
port another bloc party for the sake of further unprincipled 
conciliation of the Indian bourgeoisie. This event undoubt-
edly added to the already strong Chinese objections to the 
line now being taken by the CPSU toward the West in general, 
and contributed to the eventual Chinese decision to launch 
an open world-wide offensive against that line in April 1960. 
During the period surrounding the issuance of the TASS 
statement Moscow took further strong measures to impress upon 
the Indian government and public Soviet dissociation from the 
Chinese position. All available means were adopted, includ-
ing repeated use of diplomatic channels in Moscow and New 
,Delhi, of the satellite governments, and of leaks to the In-
dian press; one Indian diplomat spoke of the "almost obsequious" 
Soviet attitude. On 12 September, shortly before Khrushchev's 
departure for the United States, he reportedly spoke with the 
Indian Ambassador, reiterating earlier proposals for a visit 
by him to India. That same day, a Khrushchev letter was de-
livered to Nehru in New Delhi by Ambassador Benediktov, re-
portedly attempting to minimize the significance of the bor-
der dispute, urging that it be settled by mutual discussions, 
and intimating that Khrushchev would attempt to use his per-
sonal influence to aid in a settlement. 
Meanwhile, before he flew to the Crimea, Ghosh in Moscow 
had received a message from the CPI Central Secretariat urging 
him to visit China after "consulting with the Soviet comrades," 
to see Mao and Liu, to impress upon them the dire consequences 
that would follow for the CPI if the border donflict were not 
solved quickly, and to urge them to take the initiative per-
sonally in seeking a peaceful settlement. This proposal must 
have received Khrushchev's approval, since on 9 September, 
on the morning after Ghosh's arrival back in Moscow, Ghosh 
departed again for Peiping. He remained there four days, re-
turning on the 13th once more to Moscow to report to the CPSU.

Reports differ as to whether Ghosh was seen by Mao, Liu, Chou, 
or Teng Hsiao-ping; most accounts agree, however, as to the 
essentials of Peiping's position. The CCP told Ghosh that 
the Indian public was being given false information by their 
government, that the border conflict was caused entirely by 
Indian armed provocations, that the border had never been de-
marcated, and that the culture of the peoples of the border 
areas was like that of the Tibetans, not the Indians. At the 
same time, the Chinese Communist leaders made it clear that 
their response in the dispute was being strongly conditioned 
by their view of the Indian political scene. They felt that 
reactionaries supported by the United States were gaining 
power in India and were steadily drawing Nehru into the right-
ist camp; according to one report, Ghosh was even told that 
Nehru was now the "running dog of the American imperialists" 
who had at last "lifted his mask". The CCP leaders indicated 
that they had been driven toward this view of Nehru by the 
Tibetan affair and had been reinforced in their conviction 
by the Kerala disaster. They warned Ghosh that if the CPI 
continued to support Nehru, the CPI right wing would be 
totally absorbed by reactionary forces; the CPI, they said, 
must be prepared to exist on its own strength. For their 
part, the CCP leaders felt that it was because Nehru had swung 
toward the reactionaries that the CPR could not afford to 
yield a single inch of its territory in Tibet, and had to 
strengthen its position on the border "inch by inch." They 
apparently refused to take the initiative in seeking a Nehru-
Chou meeting. When Ghosh pointed out that the CPI was being 
badly hurt by the continuation of the dispute, the Chinese 
leaders are said to have listened carefully but t0 have made 
no commitment or clear statement of their intentions. Ghosh 
was given the impression, however, that Peiping wanted the 
dispute to be settled peacefully, and was told that the CPR 
at present was contemplating no overt action against the In-
dian frontiers. 
Much of this information on the CCP position was report-
ed by Ghosh to a CPI Central Executive Committee meeting in 
Calcutta in late September, which Ghosh hastened back from 
Moscow just in time to attend.* At the same time, Ghosh gave 
*The militants in the CPI central apparatus, hoping to 
push through a leftward change in CPI policy in Ghosh's ab-
sence, reportedly had written to Ghosh in Moscow advising him 
not to hurry back for the Central Executive Committee meeting.

the Indian party leaders some inkling of the differences grow-
ing between the Chinese and Soviet lines. The Soviet leaders 
had also been very disturbed about Nehru's action in Kerala, 
and worried that Nehru might be changing his policy and draw-
ing nearer the United States. On 5 or 6 September Ghosh was 
said to have addressed and answered questions before a lengthy 
meeting of CPSU Central Committee officials devoted entirely 
to Kerala. Eventually, however, the Soviets again decided to 
maintain the current policy. When Ghosh returned to Moscow 
from Peiping in mid-September and there reported the advice 
he had been given, the CPSU apparently directly contradicted 
the CCP; Ghosh reportedly was told that the Indian national 
bourgeoisie was not about to fall under the control of the 
Western imperialist countries, that the CPI should continue 
to follow the Amritsar line, and that the CPI should above 
all avoid actions which might tend to precipitate a civil war 
in India. 
This advice was in line with statements already made by 
Khrushchev to Ghosh the week before in the Crimea, according 
to a note later circulated by Ghosh to the Indian CEC meeting. 
Khrushchev was said to have told Ghosh that the CPI and Com-
munist parties in other non-bloc countries should avoid up-
risings and other "warlike situations" since their effect 
would now hinder rather than aid the growth of Communism; that 
such uprisings would lead to the suppression of Communist 
movements by reactionary forces; that Communist party tactics 
now should be different from those used in the past since 
"now Communism cannot be established with the aid of an out-
side force;" and that the avoidance of war for three or four 
years would enable bloc military strength to surpass that of 
the West. 
This Soviet advice was used by Ghosh at the September 
Central Executive Committee meeting in arguing against an 
increasing tendency of the left-faction leaders to welcome 
the Chinese pressure on the Indian border as justifying a 
.new militant line for the CPI. In abandoning insurrectionary 
tactics in 1951, the Indian partylad cited, as one of the rea-
sons why such tactics had been erroneous, the absence in 
India of a firm and contiguous revolutionary base across the 
border such as the CCP had had in the USSR. The CPI left-
ists now argued that this was no longer true, that with the 
PLA now present in force on the Tibetan border the Indian 
party had both a channel of support for armed operations and

a potential liberator in the event of mass uprisings. Repeti-
tions of this argument by the leftists throughout 1960 have 
since been reported on many occasions by several different 
sources; it was first heard at a 13 September 1959 meeting of 
the CPI parliamentary fraction, where it was voiced by 
Basavapuratiah� Ranadive, and the head of the CPI secret ap-
paratus Jaipal Singh. In opposing arguments for this thesis 
at the subsequent September Central Executive Committee 
meeting Ghosh not only evoked Khrushchev's authority, but 
warned that the Amritsar thesis, as a fundamental tenet of 
the CPI, could only be altered "when changes in the interna-
tional situation coincide with internal political changes" 
--that is, when a change in the CPI line would serve the cur-
rent overall interests of Soviet foreign policy. Neverthe-
less, the leftists are reported to have been able to force 
through the meeting a compromise whereby the CEC requested 
Indian provincial party secretariats to prepare for central 
party consideration their suggestions for possible amend-
ments to the Amritsar Thesis. 
On the border question, the leftists circulated at the 
CEC meeting a document upholding the Chinese case entirely, 
and claiming that the dispute was linked both with a shift 
in Indian foreign policy and Nehru's reactionary domestic 
tendency recently shown in Kerala. This document said that 
the government was using the dispute to distract the Indian 
people from the real issues and to create a situation where 
the CPI could be isolated and outlawed. It called on the 
party to "expose this game of the Nehru government". Ghosh, 
however, is reported to have proposed a "middle way" suggested 
to him in Moscow, whereby the CPI would state that acceptance 
of neither the MacMahon line nor the line shown on Chinese 
maps should be made a precondition for Sino-Indian negotia-
tions. This formula, plus a statement of the CPI's conviction 
that socialist China could never commit aggression, formed 
the core of the CEC resolution eventually adopted on this 
subject and published on 25 September. This second CPI reso-
lution on the border dispute aroused a great public uproar; 
the CPI's failure to place any blame upon China or to support 
any aspect of the Indian government's position was widely 
denounced as virtually treasonable. 
This reaction from all sections of the non-Communist 
public was to place severe pressure upon those provincial 
party organizations heavily dependent on electoral alliances 
- 66 - 
_,srfreftrf

Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 , 
with other parties; as a result of the indiscipline prevalent 
in the CPI, certain rightist-inclined provincial organizations 
were to succumb to this pressure and oppose the central party 
line. The center of this opposition was Maharashtra on the 
west coast, and its leader was Dange. In mid-September Dange 
reiterated privately to a Maharashtra State Council meeting 
his August position that the MacMahon line should be taken 
as the basis for negotiation. After the Calcutta Central 
Executive Committee meeting, on 7 October, the multi-party 
alliance to which the CPI belonged in Bombay met and issued 
a public statement upholding the MacMahon line and accusing 
the CPR of "forcible occupation" of Indian territory; Dange, 
who headed the Communist representatives present, concurred 
in this statement. This action is said to have infuriated 
the CCP leaders, who communicated their anger to Ghosh, then 
in Peiping for the Chinese tenth anniversary celebrations; 
Ghosh on 9 October sent a message to the CPI Central Secre-
tariat via the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi demanding that 
no further statements be made on the border situation by; any 
CPI members. Dange issued a public statement slightly soft-
ening the strong stand taken by the multi-party alliance, 
and the Central Secretariat applied pressure upon the Maharashtra 
CP; but on 14 October the Maharashtra Provincial Committee 
defied the party center by passing a resolution supporting 
the multi-party resolution and endorsing the action of the 
Communist representatives there. 
A number of other prominent CPI leaders took positions 
in late September and early October opposing the "unpatriotic" 
stand taken in the CPI's 24 September Calcutta resolution. 
In particular, an influential section of the Kerala party 
was reported becoming vociferously anti-Chinese because the 
CPR's attitude on the border was hurting the party's chances 
in the Kerala elections scheduled for February 1960. Four 
Kerala leaders were reported to have sent a memorandum to 
the Calcutta meeting explaining the difficulties the border 
issue was causing them, and recommending that the Central 
Executive Committee state openly that the CPR had made mis-
takes and committed aggression. On 3 October, former Kerala 
Chief Minister Namboodiripad told newsmen that "the refusal 
of the Communist party to denounce China is costing it the 
goodwill of a large section of its sympathizers in India."

It was against this background that the CPI prepared to 
celebrate the CPR's tenth anniversary in early October 1959. 
The central party leadership made a vigorous effort to counter 
the tide of anti-Chinese sentiment within the party in a 4 
October special issue of the weekly New Age devoted to the 
anniversary. New Age--edited by P. C. JEgEi, who was not a 
leftist but who nevertheless had long been the most fervent 
admirer of the CCP among the Indian party leaders--on this 
occasion went far beyond a mere defense of Sino-Indian friend-
ship, and took positions which demonstrated how little com-
prehension many CPI leaders who later proved to be loyal to 
the CPSU still had of Moscow's sensitivity to certain Chinese 
policies and ideological claims, and how lightly the CPSU was 
still treading in communicating its position on these issues 
to the CPI.* This issue contained one article hailing the 
policies of the Chinese "leap forward"; another article hail-
ing the practical and ideological advantages of the communes** 
and terming them the "morning sun rising above the broad 
horizen of east Asia;" another calling Mao Tse-tung a "great 
Marxist-Leninist" whose theory of combined unity and struggle 
with the bourgeoisie was "one of the very decisive contribu-
tions of the Chinese Communists to the general theory of the 
world liberation struggle;" and still another citing and en-
dorsing Mao's "paper tiger" thesis. The CPSU by October 1959 
had long been in conflict with Peiping on each of these topics, 
and no such sweeping endorsement of all of the CCP's policies 
was ever made again by New Age. 
*As will be seen later, despite the contradictory lines on 
India already being taken by Moscow and Peiping, the CPSU con-
tinued to attempt to hide the essence of its general foreign-
policy dispute with the CCP from all except a very few Indian 
party leaders until well after the dispute had broken out into 
the open in the spring of 1960. Joshi apparently stubbornly 
refused to believe that Moscow could be in serious disagree-
ment with Peiping and consequently was a vehement supporter 
of the CCP's line on the border issue and other topics until 
the CPSU's position was finally made clear to him in mid-1960--
whereupon he abruptly switched sides. 
**There is no good evidence to indicate that reverberations 
of the Sino-Soviet dispute over the communes had ever been very 
widely felt within the CPI, although Ghosh in a private talk 
with Andhra leaders in December 1958 did indicate that he had 
been informed by the Soviets of their dissatisfaction with the 
"inner party situation in Communist China" because of the com-
mune issue, among other things.

E. The October Anniversary Talks  
The CPI leadership meanwhile prepared for another round 
of talks with the Chinese and Soviets in connection with the 
CPR anniversary. Ghosh headed a five-man delegation to Peip-
ing in early October; on the tenth: he again visited Moscow 
to report on his discussions with the Chinese, and on the 
18th he returned home. While in Peiping, Ghosh is reported 
to have had at least one joint meeting with the Soviets, 
Chinese, and representatives of other Asian parties, plus one 
or two separate talks with Khrushchev and Suslov and several  
private talks with Mao and Liu.  
in these talks with the Chinese 
Ghosh reiterated his earlier plaints about the harmful ef-
fects the dispute was having upon the CPI, only to be told 
that the Indian Government and Nehru were now thorough 
reactionaries, that the CPI was getting panicky over noth-
ing, and that China was being isolated not from the people 
of India, but only from the Indian reactionaries. Several 
other earlier reports indicated that the Chinese again em-
phasized that their determination to take a firm stand on 
the border had its roots in the Indian conduct during the 
Tibetan revolt and the Dalai Lama's activities in India. 
Peiping reiterated its claim of Indian responsibility for 
the border clashes, but professed a readiness to negotiate, 
and reportedly hinted at willingness to trade Chinese recogni-
tion of the MacMahon line in the east for Indian reco�ni-
tion of the Chinese claim to Ladakh in the west. 
the Chinese leaders, while angr over e 
stand taken by right-wing leaders such as Dange, expressed 
appreciation of the manner in which the central CPI leader-
ship had thus far resisted nationalist pressures, and ac-
knowledged that the CPI could not take a stand openly support-
ing the CPR. 
Mao and Liu apparently once more refused, however, to 
commit themselves to initiate a request for a Nehru-Chou 
meeting, and even rebuked the CPI for having failed to under-
stand how such a Chinese initiative would play into Nehru's 
hands. Repeating their pessimistic view of Nehru--and at-
tributing his hostile stand on Tibet and the border to the 
fears of the Indian bourgeoisie of the effect of the example

of socialist China on the Indian masses--the CCP leaders 
nevertheless recognized the need for the CPI to do every-
thing possible to keep Nehru from moving still further to 
the right. Liu is reported to have warned the CPI to be-
ware of Nehru as "the most clever interpreter of the 160.11:cy 
of British imperialism in 4Asia." This evaluation was re-
inforced by an article published in the Chinese journal 
World Knowledge on 5 October--in the midst of the Peiping 
talks�Which provided the most hostile CPR public allusion 
to the Indian government since the Tibetan revolt the pre-
vious spring. The article admitted that the bourgeois 
leaders of some newly independent countries have "certain 
contradictions with the imperialists," but insisted that 
"at the same time they maintain such intricate relations 
with the imperialists as lead themtto manifest an expansion-
ist ambition." Under the pressure of the imperialists and 
domestic reactionaries, said World Knowledge, "such double-
faced 'neutralists' often show vacillations." The context 
made it clear that "the leaders in India," through their 
actions toward Tibet and the Chinese border, had shown them-
selves to be such double-faced neutralists. 
There is abundant indication, both from the. public So-
viet statements in Peiping and from subsequent events 
that the Soviet delegation made a serious and un-
successful effort at this time to overcome Chinese opposi-
tion to the entire course of Soviet foreign policy. Al-
though there is no conclusive evidence, it also seems likely 
that Khrushchev made some effort ID persuade the Chinese to 
modify their posture on the border issue, at least to the 
extent of initiating a proposal for negotiations between 
Nehru and Chou; if so, it appears from Mao's subsequent re-
marks to the CPI delegation that Peiping continued for some 
time to resist and resent this suggestion. Later, after 
Chou En-lai had finally proposed such talks in his 7 Novem-
ber letter to Nehru, the Indian Ambassador in Moscow is 
reliably reported to have told his government that this of-
fer, even though hedged in by qualifications,had been sent 
under Soviet pressure; and the same assertion was made to 
the Indian Government on 16 November by a Soviet embassy 
official in New Delhi. The Soviet official added that his 
government regretted that the offer of negotiations had not 
been made at least a month earlier, but that Chinese policy 
was not flexible. There is little doubt that the USSR was

making every effort to exaggerate the extent of its pressure 
on Peiping in the eyes of the Indian government and public; 
thus on 10 October a lurid account in Blitz depicted Khru-
shchev as having sternly upbraided Chou for the Chinese stand 
and as having ordered him to reply politely to Nehru's mes-
sage of congratulations on the CPR anniversary (which Chou 
in fact did). Nevertheless, it seems to have been clearly 
the desire of the USSR throughout this period to have negotia-
tions begun and tension reduced between China and India as 
rapidly as possible, and it is equally clear that Peiping 
was dragging its feet. 
When Ghosh visited Moscow after his October stay in 
Peiping, he is reported to have been given a briefing on the 
Soviet peaceful coexistence strategy similar to that furnish-
ed him by Khrushchev the month before. Soviet party leaders 
told Ghosh that the aim of the peaceful coexistence line was 
to prevent war for a number of years sufficient to give the 
bloc decisive command of the balance of power, so that the 
rest of the world could subsequently be enabled to gravitate 
toward Communism without fear of "imperialist" intervention. 
According to another report, Suslov is Said tohavetold Ghosh 
that the CPI must at all costs not allow itself to become 
isolated from the Inlian people, even if this required the 
party to take actions not in the immediate interests of the 
socialist countries. 
Thus armed with Soviet permission to take whatever steps 
might prove necessary to conciliate Indian nationalist opinion, 
Ghosh returned to New Delhi, and on 18 October held a press 
conference in which he emphasized at great length Mao's assur-
ances to him of Peiping's peaceful intentions and sincere 
desire for a peaceful settlement with India. These remarks 
by Ghosh were given extensive coverage in New Age of 25 
October; in the meantime, however, a new crigh had occurred 
between Chinese Communist troops and Indian border guards in 
the Ladakh area, Indians were killed and Indian prisoners 
taken by the Chinese, and Peiping had officially protested 
that the clash was the result of provocation by the Indian 
side. Ghosh was thus placed in a ridiculous position, and 
reacted sharply in the light of the Soviet guidance he had 
received. An emergency meeting of the CPI Central Secre-
tariat was held on 24 October, following which a public 
statement was issued calling the Ladakh clash a "tragic event" 
and saying that there was "no justification whatever" for

the firing. The Secretariat also sent a note to the Chinese 
Embassy outlining the feelings of the Indian people about 
this event, declaring that the Chinese government should have 
expressed regret instead of making a protest, and saying that 
Peiping should be the first to take the initiative in start-
ing negotiations, since "there is no problem of prestige" in 
doing this (presumably, an allusion to Mao's indication to 
Ghosh that this was indeed a matter of prestige). This note 
was sent to the CPR Ambassador on 24 October with the request 
that it be forwarded to Peiping; 
In the last week of October, CPI leaders were reported 
to have contacted the heads of several bloc diplomatic mis-
sions in New Delhi to ask that the CPI stand on the border 
issue not be misunderstood, and that any future apparent dis-
agreement with the CCP be regarded as a tactical move by the 
CPI. These warnings were apparently initiated by Ghosh as 
a preliminary to a move on his part to promote a somewhat 
more nationalistic posture for the CPI. At the subsequent 
meetings in early and mid-November in Meerut of the Central 
Executive Committee and the National Council, Ghosh did in-
deed support some of the demands of the right faction of the 
party led by Dange. After intense resistance by the left 
faction, the Meerut meetings eventually produced a new com-
promise party resolution which, while still ambivalent, was 
several degrees closer to the nationalist position. The In-
dian government's claims for the MacMahon line in the eastern

half of the border were for the first time explicitly endorsed 
and the Chinese claims rejected; but the western border in 
Ladakh was declared to be undetermined, and Chou En-lai's pro-
posal for a meeting with Nehru was welcomed without mention 
of the prior condition of a Chinese troop pullback which the 
Indian government placed upon such a meeting. 
While the CPI was moving in this direction, the CPSU was 
taking an increasingly contradictory position on the Indian 
border dispute: while in public growing more and more critical 
of the Chinese line, Moscow in private was attempting to re-
strain CPI factionalism by denying any differences with Peiping. 
In Khrushchev's 31 October speech to the Supreme Soviet 
(which marked the high-water point of the conciliatory peace-
ful coexistence line toward the West generally) the Soviet 
Premier expressed deep regret over the Ladakh incident of the 
week before, said that "nothing can compensate" the relatives 
of the casualties, and appealed for friendly negotiations "to 
the mutual satisfaction of both sides." On 2 November a CPSU 
letter was reported to have been received by the CPI which 
insisted that the stand taken by Khrushchev was designed to 
influence the Indian government, which denied that any rift 
could exist between Moscow and Peiping, and which vaguely 
warned the CPI to move cautiously and misunderstand neither 
the CPSU nor the CCP. But on 15 November, the CPI weekly New 
Age published an interview between its Moscow correspondent 
and Khrushchev at a Kremlin reception on the evening of 7 
.November. The New Age correspondent quoted Khrushchev as 
calling the border dispute "a sad and stupid story," as argu-
ing that the area in dispute was uninhabited and without 
strategic significance, and as citing the example of the USSR's 
cession of territory to Iran as a model of amicable settle-
ment of such differences. Khrushchev was said to have declared, 
"we gave up more than we gained; what were i fe* Illonieters for 
a country like the Soviet Union." While these statements 
could have been intended also to affect Indian government 
policy, their immediate effect can only have been upon CPI 
rank-and-file membership, and must have suggested to party 
members the reality of the Sino-Soviet differences the 2 No-
vember CPSU letter had just sought to deny. While Soviet 
media never published this Khrushchev interview, portions of 
it were reported by a New York Times correspondent present, 
and it is in any case most unlikely that New Age would have 
invented statements of this type attribute-a�to Khrushchev.

The CCP is reliably known to have bitterly resented both this 
statement and the one contained in Khrushchev's 31 October 
speech, and to have viewed them as stages in a mounting So-
viet public attack on Chinese policy. 
F. Increasing CPI Leftist Ties With Peiping 
It is possible that Khrushchev's insertion of these anti-
Chinese hints in the central CPI organ in mid-November repre-
sented one of the first rather feeble Soviet attempts to 
counter the increasing Chinese effort in the fall of 1959 to 
create an area within the CPI subject to CCP guidance and re-
moved from CPSU tutelage. Ghosh 
told the Central Secretariat after his visit to China that 
Mao had hinted to him that the CCP wanted to exert a greater 
degree of leadership over the Asian parties--and particularly 
over the CPI. The most vigorous of Peiping's efforts in this 
direction were concentrated in West Bengal. There the left-
ist party leadership--with CCP encouragement--came to take 
an increasingly strong line throughout the fall in opposing 
conciliation of Nehru and of rightist tendencies in the CPI, 
and in openly fighting actions of the central party leader-
ship sanctioned by the CPSU but harmful to the interests of 
Peiping. 
On 8 October, the West Bengal party sent a resolution to 
the Central Secretariat emphasizing that "some reformist and 
anti-party elements have come into the CPI and the first job 
of the CPI should be to expel them." In late October, the 
West Bengal State Council heard with approval the leftist 
Bhupesh Gupta report--along the line taken by the CCP in the 
Peiping talks with the CPI leadership--that the Indian govern-
ment was seeking a convenient excuse to stir up anti-Chinese 
and anti-Communist feelings so that the sympathies of the 
Indian masses could be retained while India was dragged into 
the imperialist camp. A lone rightist speaker, who accused 
the CCP of "left-sectarian mistakes" and of initiating the 
border troubles to harm the Khrushchev peace offensive, was 
overwhelmingly voted down. In mid-November, the West Bengal 
party leadership was reported by several sources to be ex-
tremely hostile to the border resolution of the Meerut National 
Council offering gestures of conciliation to Indian nationalism;

_isrfreRET 
this resolution was called self-contradictory, and the central 
party leaders were accused of toeing the line of "bourgeois 
Nehru." The editorial staff of the Calcutta party organ 
Swadhinata determined not to publicize this party resolution 
or to slant its news reports in accordance with it. There is 
evidence that rightist CPI leaders made an abortive attempt 
to have the party Control Commission investigate the line 
_taken by Swadhinata. At a West Bengal Provincial Executive 
Committee meeting in early December, it was formally decided 
to oppose the results of the Meerut meeting, and subsequent 
reports told of gains made by pro-Chinese left-faction ele-
ments within the party organizations of Assam and Tripura--
neighbors of West Bengal--thanks to the missionary influence 
of the West Bengali leaders. 
There is good evidence of Chinese encouragement of this 
evolution of the West Bengal party toward open defiance of the 
party center. According to one report originating with the 
West Bengal police, a new CPR consul in Calcutta, shortly 
after his arrival in September, held several meetings with 
prominent members of the West Bengal party to appraise them 
of current Chinese policy on the border dispute and to sug-
gest the line that they should take in countering anti-Chinese 
propaganda. A West Bengal government intelligence report 
in November claimed that four powerful radio sets had been 
installed in the office of the China Review in Calcutta to 
listen to broadcasts from Peiping, and that handouts were 
being quietly given to Swadhinata for propaganda work on the 
basis of these broadcasts. Chinese propaganda then in turn 
played back the line furnished in SuTdhinata: in a conver-
sation the next year,. Ghosh 
complained that the Chinese had published nothing about the 
November 1959 CPI National Council meeting, but did fully 
publicize the subsequent meeting of the West Bengal party and 
the writings in Swadhinata ion, the West Bengal 
party was reported to have organized a 
special class, sche u es o �egin in mid-December, for lead-
ing party members: this class was designed "to explain the 
differences between the attitude of Communist China and the 
Soviet Union, with special emphasis on the Chinese concept 
of 'permanent revolution!" Finally, it was from about this 
period of the late fall of 1959 that indications of Chinese 
financial subsidies to sections of the Indian party--and 
particularly to left-faction strongholds such as West Bengal--
- 75 - 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
began to increase. By the following spring, the new and un-
accustomed affluence of the West Bengal party leaders, and 
the heightened assertiveness which accompanied it, were being 
remarked on bitterly by CPI rightists. 
At the same time, the left-faction members of the CPI 
Central Secretariat--Ranadive, Bhupesh Gupta, and particularly 
Basavapunniah--became increasingly active late in 1959 in 
promoting the line given them in Peiping throughout the CPI. 
In mid-November, Basavapunniah was reported by two sources 
to have repeated, to a meeting of CPI leaders concerned with 
creating an underground organization, his belief that the CPI 
lack ofacontiguous foreign supply base during the Telengana 
revolt had: now been remedied with the Chinese occupation of 
Tibet and other frontier areas. In late December he was said 
to have reiterated to a meeting of the Maharashtra State Coun-
cil Mao's statement to Ghosh that Tibet, Sikkim, Bhutan, and 
the Northwest Frontier Agency are provinces peopled by the 
same. race, that China had a historic right to these terri-
tories, that the MacMahon line was not valid, and that the 
Indian government's raising of "the bogey of Chinese aggres-
sion" had resulted from its realization that Nepal, Sikkim, 
Bhutan and. India would be deeply affected by the social and 
economic revolution in Tibet. 
A more remarkable indication of the lengths to which the 
left faction in the CPI center was willing to go to advance 
the CCP viewpoint within the Indian party--and to promote 
the notion that the CPSU endorsed that viewpoint--was furnished 
by the reports they circulated within the party at the en 
1959 of a su -Khrushchev meeting. 
these reports were firs initi-
aTea 'ay Hanadive on 12 December, when he claimed, with much 
circumstantial detail, that the party center had received a 
letter from the CPSU reporting that Mao and Khrushchev had 
met in Northeast China on 24 November to discuss and reach 
agreement on a wide range of world topics, including the bor-
der dispute. Subsequently, a text of this purported letter 
became available in CPI archives, diverging from Ranadive!s 
oral account in some details, but claiming unanimity between 
the CCP and CPSU on the border dispute as well as on the com-
ing summit conference. 
� 76 �

The alleged CPSU letter is not credible for several 
reasons; firstly, the alleged meeting itself is not credible. 
Further, while it is not impossible (in view of past and 
subsequent CPSU attempts to deny differences with Peiping 
to the CPI) that the CPSU could have deliberately misin-
formed the Indian party about the alleged meeting, the So-
viet party would not have made some of the statements found 
in the text of its purported letter: for example, the state-
ment that Mao and Khrushchev had agreed that the West de-
sired a summit meeting "because they wanted to take time to 
make their 'position of strength' stable and stronger;" 
just such a claim that Western "peace _gestures" were a 
"smokescreen" behind which the West was being allowed to 
redress the military balance of power while disarming and 
demoralizing revolutionary forces was the central theme in-
troduced into Peiping's propaganda attacks on the Soviet 
peaceful coexistence line in the late fall of 1959. The 
most likely explanation appears to be that these oral re-
ports and the purported text of a Soviet letter were manu-
factured by Ranadive, Bhupesh Gupta and Basavapunniah--the 
three chief leftists within the Central Secretariat--for 
use within the Indian party. It is probably significant 
that the first version of this CPSU letter was reported by 
Ranadive four days after General Secretary Ajoy Ghosh was 
stricken with a heart attack and hospitalized on 8 December; 
Ghosh was out of the way until February, during which time 
Basavapunniah is believed to have acted in his place. Ac-
cording to one report, Basavapunniah, Ranadive, and Bhupesh 
Gupta in late December were employing this supposed letter 
not only as evidence that the CPSU and CCP were working 
closely together, but as a means of pressuring provincial 
party units against taking a strongly nationalist line on 
the border issue. It is known that Basavapunniah attended 
a meeting of the rightist-dominated Maharashtra State Coun-
cil in the third week of December and attacked the Indian 
government over the border issue; it is possible, though 
.there is no direct confirmation, that he cited the purported 
CPSU letter at this meeting. 
If this interpretation is correct, the falsification 
of the CPSU position indulged in by the CPI leftists on this 
occasion was a prelude to the more openly anti-CPSU campaign 
of falsification they launched after the 1960 Moscow Confer-
ence, when they flooded the Indian party with reports of a 
humiliating defeat for Khrushchev by the CCP And of CPSU sur-
render of guidance over the CPI to Peiping.

Change in Line Over Eisenhower Visit: It is also pos-
sible that Ghosh's removal from the scene and the temporary 
leftist assumption of control of the central party machinery 
in December 1959 played a role in the drastic CPI reversal 
of line toward President Eisenhower's visit to India in that 
month. On 5 December, a full meeting of the CPI secretariat 
was held to decide the party's policy toward that visit; a 
fight among the leaders was reported to have occurred similar 
to that at the Meerut National Council meeting two weeks 
before, with Ghosh's interpretation of the earlier guidance 
given him in Moscow again proving decisive. On 7 December, 
the secretariat issued a statement (published in New Age a 
week later) welcoming the President warmly and hallar4-1iis 
visit as an "event of great importance." Subsequently the 
All-Indian Peace Council, a CPI front, sent Mr. Eisenhower 
an effusive letter of welcome. On 9 December, however, So-
viet Ambassador Benediktov sent a note to the party secre-
tariat criticizing its judgment in issuing its statement, and 
saying that if such a decision actually was their best tacti-
cal line, the announcement should have been made by an execu-
tive body lower than the secretariat to avoid:confusing the 
party rank and file. Benediktov was reported irritated over 
press reports comparing the welcome accorded Khrushchev on 
his last visit unfavorably with that given President Eisen-
hower now. There is no evidence, however, that he suggested 
that the CPI publicly reverse its appraisal of the motives 
of the Eisenhower visit. On 15 December however, a CCP 
"analysis" of the Eisenhower journey was reported received 
by the Central Secretariat; it was said to emphasize that 
the President's "peace talk" was false and that the real pur-
pose of his trip was to discuss military and defense matters 
with his allies, as exemplified by his talks in Pakistan. 
The next day the secretariat met--this time without Ghosh, 
who was now in the hospital--reviewed the matter, and issued 
a public statement denouncing the Eisenhower visit along 
lines similar to those said to have been contained in the 
Chinese. analysis. This CPI statement was published in the 
20 December New Age, together with another long article at-
tacking the PresiTent as the "Voice of Big Business." Also 
in this issue of  New Age--and once again testifying to the 
growing pro-CCP orientation of the leftist Central Secre-
tariat members--was an editorial on the 80th anniversary of 
Stalin's birthday taking a basically pro-Stalin line much 
closer to that of the commentary published in People's Daily 
on this occasion than-to that of the fairly critical editorial 
published in Pravda.

V. THE CPI AND THE SINO-SOVIET POLEMIC: 1960 
In 1960 the Soviet and Chinese parties came into open 
and repeated conflict, and this conflict was transformed 
into an organizational struggle within the world Communist 
movement in which both Sides eventually found themselves ap-
pealing to the loyalties of the key leaders of each of the 
principal Communist parties of the world. Although the CPSU, 
because of its fears of precipitating a formal schism in the 
Indian party, for a long time left the CPI out of its efforts 
to mobilize foreign Communist support against Peiping--and 
even attempted to continue to deny to the CPI the reality of 
the Sino-Soviet dispute--the Indian party eventually had to 
be drawn into that dispute, if only because bloc policy to-
ward India was one of the key matters at issue between Moscow 
and Peiping. CPI representatives took part in the Sino-Soviet 
confrontations which took place in Peiping and Bucharest in 
June, in Hanoi in September, and in Moscow in October and No-
vember. The Indian party was formally appraised of the Soviet 
position in a CPSU letter to the party center in August, and 
was given a Chinese reply more indirectly through West Bengal 
channels the next month. Under the impact of these events, 
the rightist CPI leaders pressed an offensive against leftist-
faction positions, which they were anxious to identify clearly 
with CCP resistance to CPSU authority; the leftists in the 
central party machinery, for their part, were anxious to deny 
their own estrangement from the CPSU by denying as long as 
they could the reality of Sino-Soviet differences. When a 
clearcut choice was finally posed in September, vacillating 
and opportunistic CPI leaders (the majority) swung to the 
rightist side identified with the CPSU, and the CPI passed a 
secret resolution attacking Peiping and supporting Moscow. 
Passage of this resolution was resisted by the leftist CPI 
national leaders, however, and was bitterly denounced by 
left-faction representatives in the provinces throughout In-
dia. One important provincial party organization, in West 
Bengal, went so far as to pass a counter-resolution directly 
attacking the conduct of the CPSU and Khrushchev by name and 
supporting Peiping--the only such resolution definitely known

Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
-s,xenlr 
to have been passed in any Communist party in the world.* 
While the delegation led by Ghosh to Moscow supported 
Khrushchev on most issues during the November conference 
of Communist parties, Khrushchev's eventual retreat at 
that conference on the crucial issue of discipline within 
the international movement--together with the inclusion of 
many Chinese positions in the ambiguous document produced 
by the conference--served to encourage the CPI leftists 
generally and to leave those of them who had openly defied 
the CPSU unrebuked and more firmly entrenched than before. 
A. Soviet Moves in Earlyl 1960  
In the months immediately preceding the outbreak of open 
Sino-Soviet polemics in April 1960, the CPSU appears to have 
made further efforts to impress its position on the CPI and 
to maintain the good will of the Indian government. Accord-
ing to one report the CPI on 12 
January received a letter from the Soviet party attempting 
at some length to justify Soviet economic aid to India on the 
grounds that Nehru was a liberal democrat whose foreign policy 
up to now had been progressive; Soviet economic assistance 
was depicted as helping him to maintain his "progressive" 
neutrality as far as possible, and the maintenance of this 
neutrality, said the CPSU, "will be a major factor for build-
ing the strength of the socialist forces in India." 
Whether or not this report is accurate, it seems likely 
from the conduct of the CPI leadership after the Kerala elec-
tions in early February that the CPSU had been in some form 
of contact with the CPI in January to exercise a restraining 
influence once more. In those elections, the Communist party 
was defeated in its bid to return to office by an anti-Com-
munist alliance, yet increased its popular vote and its per-
centage of the total vote. The CPI was reported divided as 
to how to interpret this, with the leftists apparently again 
seeking to deny the usefulness of the parliamentary approach. 
Before the elections, in a private conversation on 26 January, 
*It is quite possible, of course, that such secret resolu-
tions were passed by the Chinese, Albanian, and perhaps also 
the Malayan and Burmese parties.

_SEC-REIF 
Basavapunniah had predicted a Kerala election defeat and had 
asserted that such a defeat would be salutary for the CPI in 
that it might teach the party a lesson regarding the "illusion" 
of parliamentary democracy. Yet on 5 February, when the final 
results became known, the CPI Central Secretariat issued a 
public statement saying that the party had "no hesitation in 
accepting the results of the elections in a truly democratic 
spirit," while the secretariat of the Kerala party declared 
that the CPI in Kerala would "play its role as a constructive 
and responsible opposition." The adoption of this posture 
indicates that the moderates had been able to predominate at 
this point, presumably with CPSU assistance. The rancor of 
the leftists, however, was made evident in a March article 
on the elections by Ranadive in the monthly New Age. Ranadive 
noted that the party, "taking the realities -61--tE�situation 
into consideration," had stated that it would work as a con-
structive opposition party, but at the same time was at pains 
to link Nehru personally with all the most nefarious and 
reactionary activities of the Kerala anti-Communist alliance 
which enabled that alliance to defeat the CPI. 
Warsaw Pact Meeting and Khrushchev Visit: At about the 
same time that the CPI was thus reacting to its defeat in 
Kerala in early February, Khrushchev was reportedly launching 
a fairly strong attack on Peiping's policy toward India in a  
speech before a Warsaw Pact meeting in Moscow.  
 Khrushchev 
charged that the Chinese actions on the Indian border had 
created tension during a period of international detente, and 
that as a result a great deal of support for the Communist 
cause in the neutralist countries of Asia had been forfeited. 
This indictment is known to have been greatly elaborated by 
the CPSU in confrontations with the CCP later in the year. 
It was at this February Warsaw Pact meeting that the CPR 
representative, Kang Sheng, is believed to have had the first 
of the Chinese personal altercations with Khrushchev in 1960 
over differences on foreign policy; moreover, Peiping sub-
sequently took the unprecedented step of publishing a sanitized 
version of Kang's speech revealing its dissenting view of dis-
armament, reduction of tensions, and other questions. 
A week after this meeting, Khrushchev visited India, pre-
ceded by further Soviet-inspired reports intimating his anxiety 
to heal Sino-Indian differences. (Thus the Soviet home service

....sgettrf 
and press two days before Khrushchev's arrival picked up an 
open letter to him published in Blitz appealing to the Soviet 
premier to play the role of peacemaker during his visit.) 
Reports agree, however, that during his meeting with Nehru, 
Khrushchev did not offer to mediate the dispute, but merely 
expressed his anxiety for an early settlement and was given 
a copy of Nehru's invitation to Chou to visit India in  
 Khrushchev also 
reiterated to Nehru his disapproval of Peiping's border policy. 
This was apparently not mentioned, however, in the account 
of the meeting Gromkyo passed to the Chinese Ambassador that 
same day, according to the version the ambassador subsequently 
furnished CPI leftist leaders. This version instead stressed 
that Khrushchev told Nehru the Chinese felt they were misun-
derstood in India, and that he attempted to disabuse Nehru of 
the notion that the USSR could exert significant influence on 
Peiping (a notion which the Soviet government and Blitz had 
been eager to promote the year before). It is possible that 
both versions were correct, and that Khrushchev, while deplor-
ing the Chinese actions, now denied any capability to change 
Peiping's stand and attempted to persuade Nehru to accept the 
CPR offer to trade recognition of the MacMahon line for the 
acceptance of some Chinese claims in Ladakh. 
That the CPR was intent on maintaining this stand--and 
may have been apprised in advance of the position Khrushchev 
intended to take with Nehru--was indicated by a note the CPI 
secretariat received from the Chinese party on the eve of 
Khrushchev's visit, urging the CPI once more to prepare the 
Indian public for a settlement along the lines advocated by 
Peiping. On 27 February, after Khrushchev had left, the CPI 
secretariat received another note through the Chinese embassy 
with a copy of Chou's reply to Nehru accepting the invitation 
to India. When Chou actually visited New Delhi in late April, 
however, the concessions by Nehru which the CPR may have antici-
pated did not materialize, and the CPI was advised by the Chi-
nese delegation that Nehru was under such great pressure from 
rightist leaders that he could not act independently.

B. Peiping' t Lenin Anniversary Articles  
In April 1960 the CCP opened a massive public offensive 
against the CPSU foreign policy line through four key state-
ments tied to the anniversary of Lenin's birth: an article 
in the 1 April Red Flag signed by Yu Chao-li (a pseudonym), 
another in the Eia-11-5171-1 Red Flag signed by the journal's 
editorial department, a People's Daily article on 22 April, 
and a speech by propaganda department director Lu Ting-i the 
same day. Central to the many implicit indictments leveled 
at Soviet policy in these statements was the theme that the 
peaceful coexistence line as enunciated by Khrushchev was 
dampening the militancy of revolutionary forces throughout 
the world. 
The publication of these statements had an electrifying 
effect on all factions of the Indian party. In Bombay, all 
issues of the April Peking Review containing the first Red ' 
Flag article were reported quickly bought up by CPI funEfion-
Tires; the article was termed a "bombshell" for the CPI. Its 
effect within the rightist-dominated CPI Maharashtra Provin-
cial Council was reportedly to weaken the position of the 
leftist faction still further, since the article was recognized 
to be a "thinly-veiled attack" on Khrushchev's peaceful co-
existence line. On the other hand, among the leftists in the 
party Central Secretariat--Ranadive, Basavapunniah, and Bhupesh 
Gupta--the article was warmly welcomed; this group was said 
to have immediately decided to use the Red Flag arguments to 
support efforts to modify a draft politicalresolution to be 
considered by the CPI National Council in May. The influence 
of this article seemed to be reflected in an article Ranadive 
wrote in the 24 April New Age on the Lenin anniversary: 
Ranadive put his emphasis on Lenin's call for militant and 
"irreconcilable" struggle and Lenin's fight against "reform-
ist and revisionist distortion of Marxism," and failed to 
mention Khrushchev's name. In contrast, an article by Ghosh 
on the same subject in the same issue of New Age paid repeated 
tribute to Khrushchev, to Khrushchev's visit to India, to the 
spirit of Camp David and the need for negotiations. 
Basavapunniah, however, seems to have reacted rather 
naively to the Chinese offensive, assuming, on the basis of 
the first Red Flag article, that it meant not that the CCP was

Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
.Jszeist 
attacking the CPSU but rather that Peiping and Moscow were 
together beginning another campaign against revisionism. He 
was encouraged in this view by Moscow's continued reluctance 
to worsen CPI factionalism by admitting the existence of a 
Moscow-Peiping struggle, despite the fact that this struggle 
had now come out into the open. During the third week of 
April Basavapunniah was reported to have made the rounds of 
bloc embassies in New Delhi appealing for support for his 
faction. On the 24th, he was said to have had a joint meet-
ing with Soviet embassy counselor Romanovskiy and Chinese 
embassy first secretary Ma Mu-ming. He reportedly told these 
gentlemen that he was very happy with the 1 April Red Flag 
article as it would help the CPI in its fight agaiEgf revi-
sionism, and appealed for more such intervention by the So-
viet and Chinese parties in aid of his faction. According 
to the version of the interview Basavapunniah later repeated, 
both Romanovskiy and Ma "welcomed this suggestion," and 
Romanovskiy offered innocuous reasons to explain the apparent 
slight differences between the Soviet and Chinese approach 
in Asia.* 
Later in April, after the second Red Flag article en-
titled "Long Live Leninism" had become available to. him, 
Basavapunniah noted in a private conversation the confusion 
which he thought existed in the CPI on the subject of this 
article; many Indian Communists, he said, had drawn the con-
clusion that there was a deep ideological controversy between 
the CCP and the CPSU. Basavapunniah declared his intention 
to "explain" at the forthcoming National Council meeting that 
there was no controversy but only "a difference in approach 
and in their attitude toward judging situations." He also 
disclosed, however, his intention to distribute to the Nation-
al Council members copies of the "Long Live Leninism" article 
which he had had made. 
� *While it would have been quite in character for Basavapun-
niah to have invented this interview, its credibility is en-
hanced by the fact that the CPSU apparently advised Ghosh and 
other non-leftist CPI leaders during this period to continue 
to deny to the party the reality of Sino-Soviet differences.

_arareftEr. 
In addition to producing a galvanizing effect on the CPI 
left-faction leaders through the publication of the April 
documents, the CCP appears to have offered direct covert gui-
dance to those leaders during the same period. On 25 April, 
Ranadive was reported to have had a half-hour meeting with 
Chen Yi, who was in New Delhi as part of the Chou mission; 
this was said to have been the only contact between the CPI 
and the Chinese delegation. Ranadive at this meeting was 
reportedly given a document containing Peiping's assessment 
of the political scene in India and in Asia generally. This 
document apparently reiterated CCP warnings on the growth of 
"right reaction" in India and stressed that Nehru was under 
constant pressure from the rightist group inside the Congress 
party, and that he was not the same man he was a few years 
ago and could_no longer make an independent decision. Other 
information on this document is lacking. 
The May CPI Meetings: The CPI Central Executive Commit-
tee met in Calcutta from 3 to 6 May, and the National Council 
the following week. In the midst of their deliberations, the 
party leaders were confronted by the spectacle of the 8 May 
New Age weekly, which carried without comment lengthy extracts 
from�Eth (a) the 22 April Lu Ting-yi Lenin Day speech in 
Peiping and (b) the Kuusinen address in Moscow on the same 
day providing the first major Soviet public response to the 
CCP. The decision to publish both speeches was reportedly 
made by New Age underlings in New Delhi who had been placed 
in a quandry in the absence of the party leaders. However, 
when delegates at the Calcutta meeting in their speeches cited 
this and other evidence to demonstrate the existence of a 
Sino-Soviet conflict, they were reportedly rebuked by Ghosh, 
who characterized such insinuations as inspired propaganda. 
This Ghosh line was in accord with instructions passed by 
Soviet Embassy Counselor Yefimov on 4 May to Nikhil Chakravarthy, 
manager of the Communist Indian Press Agency: Yefimov was 
said to have declared that the theme of Sino-Soviet differ-
ences was being exploited by people who hoped to create con-
fusion in the minds of CPI members, that the IPA should in-
crease its propaganda against this confusion tactic and that 
he would supply propaganda material for this purpose from 
the Soviet embassy. 
While in early May the CPSU and the CPI leaders obedient 
to it were thus exercising remarkable ntthisrasnQt 
th' 
true of the left faction.

the leftists had become much more aggressive in pushing their 
point of view and much more tightly organized as a faction. 
(This factional discipline was to become increasingly apparent 
in subsequent provincial party meetings; thus at a meeting in 
Maharashtra a month later it was reported that the leftists 
had met beforehand to agree on their line and tactics and to 
decide who would speak on each question.) The increase in 
leftist sentiment at the Calcutta meetings was in part at-
tributable to fortuitous events which had aided the leftist 
anti-Nehru attitude: Nehru's failure to yield to Chou during 
the New Delhi border talks, the statements strongly critical 
of China which Nehru had made at a subsequent visit to London, 
and the announcement of a U.S.-Indian grain deal. But in large 
measure the increase in leftist aggressiveness must be attri-
buted to the strong open and covert ideological support the 
extremist CPI faction had just received from the Chinese party. 
As one result, the May National Council meeting was un-
able to resolve the running dispute in the party over the line 
to be taken toward Nehru and the Amritsar thesis; moveover, 
the meeting was unable to accept the ambiguous but largely 
rightist draft political resolution prepared by the Central 
Executive Committee the month before. The question of this 
resolution was put off, with opposing views circulated for 
general discussion by all party members, and was not to be 
decided until the party congress the following April. 
Meanwhile Ghosh, who had resumed the post of general sec-
retary in February, was again given leave for three months by 
the party because of illness, and was temporarily replaced by 
Namboodiripad. Ghosh, who had in the past often used his ill-
nesses as cover for trips'for "treatment" to the USSR, was re-
ported planning such a trip in the near future. Other reports 
indicated that the CPI was planning to send a small delegation 
to the USSR inconspicuously for guidance, and Ghosh may have 
undertaken such a trip in late May. 
May Contact With Chinese Embassy: On 21 May, two weeks 
after the National Council meeting, Ranadive sent an inter-
mediary to meet with the Counselor of the Chinese Embassy, 
Yeh Cheng-chang, at the latter's request. Among other things, 
Yeh was reported to have inquired as to the Indian public's 
reaction to the failure of the summit meeting, and was told 
that the public was blaming both the United States and Khru-
shchev. Yeh remarked that the U-2 incident had proved the 
- 86 - 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 � 
Chinese Communist thesis that Leninism would never be outmoded 
so long as imperialism remained in the world, and added that 
the Chinese knew that there would never be a successful summit. 
The Chinese representative asked Ranadive's intermediary for 
his reaction to the "Long Live Leninism" article, and was told 
that the article provided a good warning against the revision-
ist trends "developing in some Communist parties." Following 
the line taken by the Chinese leaders in their discussions 
with Ghosh in Peiping in October 1959, Yeh told Ranadive's 
man that Nehru was the best representative the Asian national 
bourgeoisie could have found to implement Ghandi's ideology, 
which'Ayehsaid:was primarily designed to help check the spread 
of Communism in Asia. Turning to the border issue, Yeh repeat-
ed the CCP line that a "little bunch of people" in India were 
trying to exploit the Sino-Indian conflict to divert atten-
tion from the domestic economic crisis. Citing, significantly, 
West Bengal as his example, he claimed that a recent Calcutta 
parliamentary by-election which had been won by a Communist 
had shown how little the border .issue had affected the Indian 
public; in West Bengal, Yeh said, the people were "hungry for 
bread" and cared for little else. 
The impact of Chinese views upon the West Bengal party 
hinted at by Yeh was once again demonstrated a few days after 
the Yeh interview, during an informal gathering of provincial 
party leaders in Calcutta. West Bengal CP Secretary Jyoti 
Basu, commenting on the failure of the summit conference, was 
said to have declared that events had shown that the Chinese 
party had been correct all along in its line toward the United 
States. Basu reportedly added that the CPI had made a great 
mistake in not actively opposing Eisenhower's December visit 
to India, and pointed to the good political capital being made 
by the Japanese party in fighting now against a similar Eisen-
hower visit to Japan. Joly Kaul, another prominent leftist, 
stated at the same meeting that he agreed that the Chinese 
Communist Party had shown much political acumen and that Chi-
nese theoreticians had emerged as the real leaders of inter-
national Communism. Kaul was said to have urged that every 
important West Bengal party leader be required to study care-
fully the recent writings and speeches of the Chinese leaders--
referring, presumably, to the "Long Live Leninism" documents. 
It is not known whether or not this suggestion was carried out, 
but it will be recalled that preparation of a similar program 
to impartthe wisdom of the CCP to West Bengal cadres had been 
reported in December 1959.

�SECA' 
In addition to the May meeting with Yeh Cheng-chang, to 
Ranadive's interview with ChenYi the month before, and to the 
two CCP notes to the CPI in February on the Chou visit, at 
least two other communications between the Indian and Chinese 
parties in the first five months of 1960 have been reported. 
On 10 April, left-faction leaders were said to have furnished 
to both the Soviet and Chinese embassies texts of the CPI's 
predominantly rightist draft political resolution with ap-
propriate unspecified "explanations;" and in early May, Rana-
dive reportedly forwarded to Peiping and Moscow copies of a 
state-by-state survey of the composition of the CPI which 
the Chinese party had apparently been the first to request, 
the previous year. There is thus good evidence of a steadily 
improving Chinese "presence" in the central CPI apparatus as 
second authoritative center to which to report and from which 
to receive guidance. 
C. The WFTU Clash in Peiping 
The second major event in the 1960 struggle between the 
CPSU and the CCP took place at the WFTU meeting in Peiping in 
the first week of June, where the Chinese party broke Commun-
ist discipline by openly lobbying among both party and non-
party foreign delegates in an attempt to get WFTU to abandon 
the Soviet line on disarmament, war, and the nature of imperi-
alism. This Peiping effort to impose its line on WFTU ap-
parently won varying degrees of support from a considerable 
number of the delegates, but was eventually substantially de-
feated as a result of the opposition of the CPSU delegation 
led by trade union chief Grishin--only, however, after a 
furious battle among the delegates in which all the CPSU's 
latent strength within WFTU was called into play. 
There is reason to believe that the current leader of the 
right-wing faction within the CPI, S. A. Dange, played an im-
portant part in this CPSU counterattack. Dange--who had as-
sailed the CPR over the border issue before party meetings 
and in public during the fall of 1959, and who had reportedly 
refused to go to Peiping with the CPI delegation for the October 
1959 Chinese anniversary celebration--came to Peiping in June 
1960 in his dual capacity as leader of the Communist-dominated 
Indian trade union federation and vice-president of WFTU. 
While Peiping published a highly edited version of the WFTU 
- 88 - 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 000600337 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
_,srbenscf 
proceedings stressing those speeches (and portions of speeches) 
which had supported the Chinese line, the NCNA accounts severely 
cut the speeches of delegates (such as the Italians and Poles) 
who are known to have backed the CPSU--and furnished no hint 
of a speech by Dange at all. This is likely to have been both 
because Dange was personally obnoxious to the CCP and because 
there was little in his speech that could be published in a 
sanitized version; it is almost certain that he did speak. 
Vitbria Foa, an Italian delegate, reported in Avanti on 14 
June that "the Indians" were among those delegates who had 
lined up solidly with the Soviets against the Chinese, helping 
to "fight with great energy...not only in the public debate, 
but also in the commissions." It has also been reported that 
Dange personally led a Soviet-sponsored campaign to have dele-
gates boycott a banquet given by Chou En-lai to proselytize 
the CCP viewpoint; also, that Dange charged at the WFTU meet-
ing that Liu Ning-i was turning the meeting into a political 
forum. (Liu, the head of the CPR trade union organization, 
had warned in his 7 June public speech to the meeting that 
"in the struggle to safeguard peace the international working 
class movement should take care that its activities help and 
do not hinder the struggle," adding that "no trade union or-
ganizations truly representing the interests of the working 
class would allow so-called 'aid' by imperialism to be con-
fused with the unconditioned, sincere, and friendly assistance 
of the socialist countries." This barb was probably directed 
primarily at certain past Khrushchev hints that Western aid 
to underdeveloped countries under some conditions could play 
a useful role, but it may also have been aimed partly at Dange 
and his organization. In the secret resolution passed by the 
CPI in September criticizing China--which Dange was instrumen-
tal in pushing through--Liu was attacked by name for having 
violated "the principle of the nonparty character of mass 
organs.") 
On 11 June, shortly after the close of the WFTU meeting, 
Basavapunniah passed to the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi a 
written report on Dange which the CCP had evidently requested 
from the CPI leftists in the course of its battle with him. 
The report outlined positions alleged to have been taken by 
Dange at the May National Council meeting in Calcutta, protray-
ing him as having urged tolerance toward capitalist investments 
in India and cooperation with the Indian bourgeoisie, as hav-
ing emphasized differences between the CPSU and the CCP on 
- 89 - 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
questions of of war and peace, and as having again condemned the 
CCP stand on the border issue. While it is likely that some 
of Dange's positions were deliberately distorted by Basavapun-
niah for his own purposes, the mere request for this report 
was indicative of the Chinese party's attitude toward both 
Dange and Basavapunniah. 
The Chinese action in bringing their quarrel with the 
CPSU before a forum at which non-party people were represented 
not only further exacerbated that quarrel but furnished the 
Soviet party with a charge against the CCP--violation of party 
discipline--which could be used to some effect in appealing 
for the support of the world movement. The CCP's behavior at 
the WFTU meeting was denounced (without naming China) in an 
article Grishin wrote in Trud after his return from Peiping, 
in a Bulgarian article in August, and in Mukhitdinov's speech 
in Hanoi in September. It was also assailed directly in the 
CPSU circular letters attacking the CCP during the summer, 
and finally at the Moscow conference in November, where Dange 
was reportedly pressed into service as an eyewitness to pre-
pare a memorandum documenting the CPSU charges about the WFTU 
events. 
D. The Bucharest Conference and Its Aftermath 
While the WFTU battle was going on in Peiping in early 
June, the CPSU appears to have taken initial steps in a coun-
teroffensive against the Chinese party. According to a sub-
sequent Chinese account to CPI representatives, the CPSU sent 
two letters to the CCP on 2 and 7 June attempting to secure 
Chinese participation in an international meeting to discuss 
out differences at the Rumanian p ar ty con ress lat e 
that month.  
'the CPSU 
also at some time before the Bucharest meeting sent a strongly 
worded letter to the CCP attacking Chinese conduct and policy 
over a wide range of issues; it is possible that this message 
was identical with one of the two CPSU letters of early June. 
Dange, who is known to have visited Moscow in late May before 
going to Peiping for the WFTU meeting, subsequently reported 
that he was told by a CPSU secretariat member of the Soviet 
intention to send such a letter. Judging from reports of a 
version of this Soviet letter which the Chinese delegation at 
Bucharest apparently distributed to the delegates there in an 
- 90 - 
_15.E.GREV

Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
_STareltrr 
effort to fix Soviet responsibility for the deterioration of 
relations between the parties, the CPSU message contained, 
among other things, very sharp charges of CCP errors in foreign 
policy toward India, together with complaints that Peiping's 
policy was arousing suspicions of the Communist movement among 
Afro-Asian bourgeois leaders and evoking doubts as to Communist 
desires for peace. These reported private charges against the 
CCP dovetail well with the public attacks on contemporary 
"]ft-wing deviationists" made in the Soviet press at about the 
same time (10 June), and correspond still more closely with 
the charges made two months later in an article by the leading 
Soviet oriental expert Ye. Zhukov in Pravda on 26 August. 
While it seems possible that Dange was telling the truth 
when he claimed to have been informed in Moscow of the Soviet 
intention to send a strong letter to Peiping, it is less clear 
whether any CPI leaders were told in advance of Soviet pur-
poses at the Rumanian party congress. Although Dange also 
subsequently claimed that he and Ghosh had been privately told 
in late May of Moscow's intention to attack the CCP before an 
international gathering at Bucharest, this seems doubtful, if 
only because the Bucharest events in late June showed signs 
of last-minute Soviet preparation. In any case, it is certain 
that theSoviet party made no attempt in June to enlist the 
formal support of the CPI organization against the CCP, while 
it did make such efforts to gain the backing of other parties. 
According to one report, the CPSU even sent a short note to 
the CPI Central Secretariat shortly after the WFTU meeting ad-
mitting that differences existed between the Chinese and So-
viet parties on the subjects of war and peaceful coexistence 
but minimizing those differences and urging the Indian party 
not to take them seriously. In contrast, officials of the 
CPSU central committee are known to have discussed the Sino-
Soviet dispute at length on 13 June with a group of European 
and African delegates to the WFTU meeting, and to have asked 
at least one of these representatives to have a plenum of his 
party's central committee convened after his return home to 
discuss the WFTU meeting and to condemn Peiping. 
This continued Soviet effort to insulate the fragile In-
dian party from the effects of the dispute apparently contri-
buted to the shock caused by the Bucharest proceedings to the 
two leftists chosen to represent the CPI, Basavapunniah and 
Bhupesh Gupta. In addition to attending the public sessions

_iszeits1 
of the Rumanian party congress, where they heard Khrushchev 
make a scarcely veiled attack on the Chinese leaders as 
"children" who mechanically repeated what Lenin had said on 
imperialism, the Indian delegates attended a series of pri-
vate interparty meetings. The first of these took place 
early during the Congress, when Soviet functionaries gathered 
the English-speaking foreign delegates* to show them a CPSU 
letter dated 21 June, various versions of which were sub-
sequently circulated to certain parties. This letter was 
distributed to the participating delegates and then taken back 
immediately, with no note-taking permitted; Basavapunniah 
later commented that he considered these security measures 
humiliating. The 21 June letter contained a long, detailed 
exposition of the Soviet version of the background of the 
dispute, including complaints against Chinese conduct in the 
international fronts and charges of CCP deviation from mutual-
ly agreed positions on war and peace, the nature of the pre-
sent era, and the forms of transition to socialism. According 
to a reliable report, this letter also claimed that the CCP 
had charged the CPSU with "abandoning class positions" by 
"flirting with the national bourgeoisie," and had demanded 
that the policy of giving aid to such countries as India be 
revised "because the national bourgeoisie of these countries 
are not capable of carrying on the struggle against imperi-
alism and are, in fact, becoming imperialists themselves." 
The CPSU letter answered this purported Chinese statement 
(which the CCP later claimed to be distorted) by insisting 
that Soviet economic aid to these countries "objectively" 
promotes peace and weakens imperialism, and by warning of 
the need not to "skip stages in the revolution"--that is, 
not to discard the alliance with the national bourgeoisie 
before the time was ripe. 
Following their perusal of this document at the private 
CPSU briefing during the congress, Basavapunniah and Bhupesh 
Gupta attended a closed meeting of some 50 Communist parties 
held immediately after the conclusion of the congress of 25 
*The CPSU organized at least one similar gathering, for 
Spanish-speaking delegates, and possibly others.

and 26 June. On the 25th, they heard representatives of some 
20 parties speak in a general debate during which most of the 
speakers supported the Soviet line and criticized Chinese 
policies; on the same day, the Chinese representative made an 
initial defense of the CCP position. During the debate on 
the following day Khrushchev made a long and violent attack 
on Peiping policies and on Mao personally, a significant 
pontion of which concerned the Sino-Indian quarrel. Khru-
shchev accused the CCP of deliberately creating a conflict 
with India in order to injure the CPSU peaceful coexistence 
line,' of causing the Indian Communist party to become dis-
organized and to lose power in Kerala, and of. pushing Nehru 
toward the imperialist camp. He declared that fora few 
kilometers of insignificant territory China could easily have 
reached a peaceful agreement with India as the USSR had in 
the past with Iran (repeating more explicitly the argument 
used in his November 1959 interview in New Age). Only the 
fact that the Soviet Union did not suppUiT T11-6 CPR position, 
he said, preserved good political relations with India and 
avoided a deterioration of the situation in Aisa. This 
speech was heatedly rebutted that same day by Peng Chen. 
It was between the speeches of Khrushchev and Peng Chen 
on the 26th that Bhupesh Gupta spoke on behalf of the CPI. 
Taking his cue from the evasive stand adopted by a few other 
Asian party representatives, Gupta attempted to remain vague 
and neutral, attacking neither the CPSU nor the CCP. He in-
sisted that Nehru was primarily responsible for the border 
conflict between China and India (contradicting Khrushchev), 
and added that Nehru had done this to divert the attention 
of the Indian masses from their own difficulties (echoing the 
line repeatedly given to the CPI by Peiping). He made a 
gesture toward Khrushchev by stating that the original posi-
tion of the CCP had not facilitated a rapid solution of the 
problem, but immediately added that the Chinese party had 
received a CPI delegation and had given careful consideration 
to its suggestions on the border issue. Gupta concluded with 
a fervent appeal for unity. The left faction of the CPI lead-
ership had thus refused to back the CPSU in a direct confronta-
tion with the CCP upon an occasion when such support was 
surely desired and when, because of the secrecy of the meet-
ing, such support need not have come to the knowledge of the 
CPI rank and file to harm internal party discipline.

_�.F.C-ftrr 
CCP Renews Claim to Asian Leadership: It is possible 
that the line taken by Basavapunniah and Gupta at Bucharest 
was influenced by the "private discussions" which they sub-
sequently disclosed having had with the Chinese delegates at 
some time during the meetings. In a later conversation with 
party cronies, Basavapunniah ascribed to the CCP one posi-
tion which was not known to have been overtly expressed in 
any document or Chinese speech at Bucharest, and which was 
likely to have been furnished him directly in these private 
talks. The CCP was portrayed as believing that China must 
now play the same role in Asia that the USSR had previously 
played in Europe in bringing Communist regimes to power, 
and that the CPR should therefore be given a free hand in 
Asia. 
The credibility of this report is enhanced by the fact 
that similar statements had been reported by different sources 
as having been made in Peiping to Ghosh in October 1959 and 
to an Italian party delegation the previous April. Nor was 
Basavapunniah's June 1960 claim to be the last such item of  
evidence.   in October 1960   
 stated that one of the 
main causes Of the dispute was the political attitude of 
China and the USSR toward Southeast Asia, and that the CPR (b)(1) 
contended that as an Asian country she should have a free (b)(3) 
hand in that area and she refused to be criticized about her 
policies there. Similarly, among the positions reportedly 
attributed to the CCP in a special CPSU memorandum on the 
dispute discussed at a Polish party plenum in September was 
the contention that the center for African and Asian parties 
should be in China, just as the center for the European parties 
is in Moscow. While it no doubt suited the polemical pur-
pose of the CPSU to stress this as evidence of the Chinese 
promotion of disunity, it nevertheless is probable that the 
CCP leadership has in fact long considered itself the logical 
leader of the Asian parties and that it took steps to advance 
this notion among those parties--including the CPI--as Sino-
Soviet relations worsened in 1959 and 1960. 
Interview With Suslov: Following the Bucharest meetings 
Basavapunniah and Bhupesh Gupta proceeded to Moscow, where 
they remained for some time in late June and early July. The

Dange, but it is unlikely that they had much success in this 
effort after their performance in Bucharest. In a reported 
conversation with Suslov, however, they were given further 
Soviet guidance on Nehru which did not substantially alter 
the CPSU line. Suslov was said to have declared that the 
Indian bourgeoisie was the greatest bargainer between East 
and West, and that Nehru was coming under greater and greater 
rightist pressure to move him toward the right and the West, 
but that the USSR could not ignore him, and would in fact 
continue to support him and wait for an opportunity to draw 
him toward the socialist camp. Suslov added that Nehru was 
establishing a "strong and stable capitalist base" in India 
which would probably outweigh the public sector of the In-
dian economy. He advised the CPI to formulate a "clear line" 
on Nehru on the basis of an examination of the Indian internal 
situation, and to adopt a policy toward Nehru independent of 
the USSR policy toward him. This is the ambiguous and some-
what hypocritical advice which Soviet leaders had been giving 
the CPI for a number of years--ever since the USSR's hostile 
posture toward the Indian government was abandoned, in fact--
and ignored the fact that the CPI could not successfully take 
a public stand on Nehru that was seriously discordant with 
the views on Nehru publicly expressed by the Soviet Union. 
In line with his own inclinations, Basavapunniah subsequently 
interpreted Suslov's remarks as meaning that-the CPI should 
consistently oppose Nehru, although it is clear from Basavapun-
niah's own account that Suslov was at great pains to avoid 
saying this. 
CPI Meetings: Basavapunniah and Bhupesh Gupta had also 
originally intended to visit Peiping after Moscow if they 
had sufficient time, but it is not known whether they did so. 
At any rate, it was not until 13 July that they returned to 
India, and it was not until several weeks after that that they 
reported to the party on the Bucharest events of late June. 
In the meantime, Basavapunniah is believed to have consulted 
with Sundarayya, his mentor in Andhra who is probably the most 
extremist of all the important CPI leaders, on the line the 
left faction should take at the forthcoming party meetings. 
From 3 to 10 August, Gupta and Basavapunniah reported on Bucha-
rest to the Central Secretariat, and from 10 to 17 August, to 
the Central Executive Committee. Certain portions of the 
written report, however, were considered too sensitive for 
presentation to the Central Executive Committee: for example,

the more polemical portions of Khrushchev's closed-session 
speech, and the exchanges between him and Peng Chen. Never-
theless, according to Basavapunniah, at least one right-wing 
CEC member rebuked him and Gupta for not having supported 
the CPSU at Bucharest, and the CEC split down the middle in 
its discussion of the CPSU-CCP differences, with Ghosh and 
the rightists supporting the CPSU, Namboodiripad and Ranadive 
attempting to remain neutral, and most of the CPI's principal 
leftists--including Basavapunniah, Gupta, Basu, Sundarayya, 
Surjit, Bora, and Konar--supporting the Chinese position. 
The CEC decided that its next meeting in early September would 
discuss the national and international situation thoroughly 
and prepare a resolution for the National Council. 
Despite the secretariat's attempt to keep the most sensi-
tive facts about the Bucharest encounter from disseminating 
through the lower echelons of the party, the nature of the 
Sino-Soviet conflict seems to have become common knowledge 
throughout the CPI in July and August, due largely to the ef-
forts of the right-faction leaders, who wished to use the 
dispute as a weapon with which to discredit and isolate the 
leftist leaders identified with the CCP in the eyes of the 
party rank-and-file for whom the CPSU retained primary authority. 
Conversely, the leftist faction had a vested interest in try-
ing to suppress knowledge of the dispute. This proved impos-
sible not merely because the non-Communist Indian press pub-
lished those details of the conflict known to the Western pub-
lic, but also, as the leftists subsequently charged, because 
rightist leaders such as Dange leaked party information about 
Bucharest to bourgeois organs such as Link. Ever since the 
WFTU meeting, it was said, Dange had attempted to convey to 
his followers in the CPI a strong anti-CCP bias, supposedly 
assuring them that the Chinese party leadership would be over-
thrown by Khrushchev. After Bucharest, Ghosh was said to have 
also conducted a whispering campaign within the party, saying 
that Khrushchev had instructed him to expose the Trotskyite 
tendency of the Chinese party. At a Maharashtra provincial 
party meeting on 20 August, Dange thus referred openly to the 
Bucharest events, defending the CPSU and characterizing the 
Chinese position on the border issue as "totally wrong;" he 
defended his frankness as justified because the party members 
had read it. all in the newspapers anyway.

The July Blitz Articles: This rightist faction effort 
to keep the CPI rank-and-file informed was given involuntary 
assistance by the simultaneous CPSU efforts to reap some 
subsidiary benefit from its troubles with the CCP by impress-
ing on the Indian public and government that the USSR had 
been defending peace and friendship with India against the 
views of the warlike and hostile Chinese. On 30 July, Blitz  
published an unsigned article on the general theme, "Is China 
Going Trotskyite?" This article referred, among other things, 
to details of the Sino-Soviet battle at the WFTU conference; 
to statements made in Khrushchev's speech to the secret meet-
ing at Bucharest; to the manner in which the Chinese press 
had obscured and distorted Khrushchev's Bucharest "speeches;" 
to the details of a recent CPSU Central Committee resolution 
attacking narrow nationalism and leftwing sectarianism; to 
recent East German public rejection of the Chinese communes; 
and to a recent resolution passed by the Trotskyite Fourth 
International endorsing the Chinese line as the correct one. 
A second long article, signed by Blitz's editor, Karanjia, 
charged the Chinese with "gloating" over the failure of the 
summit conference, said that Peiping had been responsible for 
the 1959 abortive move against Kassim by the Iraqi CP; and 
generally depicted Khrushchev and Nehru as twin angels of 
peace fighting against the dogmatist, Trotskyite alliance of 
Mao and Eisenhower. 
(b)(3) 
Despite the fact that the Soviet ambassador later denied 
to CPI leftists having planted this  material in Blitz to at-
tack the Chinese,  official told the CPI (W(1) 
that he had definite information that this was so, and Karanjia (b)(3) 
himself has reported that the material had been sent to him 
by "leaders of the Soviet faction in the CPI Central Secretariat" 
at the behest of the Soviet embassy. Whether or not the 
articles were channeled to Blitz through Ghosh, the details 
and wide range of information cluded seem likely to have 
originated in the CPSU. This Soviet effort to impress Nehru 
was successful: Karanjia subsequently claimed that Nehru 
had talked to him about the article and had written Khrushchev 
for more data on the Bucharest clash; presumably Khrushchev 
responded, since three months later Nehru told a cabinet meet-
ing that he had now come to know that at the Bucharest meet-
ing the Soviets had criticized the Chinese for their action 
in Tibet and for their attitude toward India on the border 
problem.

Leftist Appeal to China for Revolutionary Aid: At about 
the same time that this was going on, the most militant of 
the CPI leaders were for the first time explicitly turning 
to the Chinese party and away from reliance on the Soviet party 
in their plans for a future revolution. In early August 
these leaders are believed to have passed to the CCP written 
proposals asking CCP collaboration in Indian underground 
organization work aiming at eventual revolution, collabora-
tion whin would be expanded after the leftists had taken con-
trol of the CPI at next year's party congress, as they hoped 
to do. It was explained that this request was addressed to 
the Chinese because they "understand the problems of the mili-
tant wing of the CPI," and because the CPR and not USSR, has 
a border with India, so that only China could provide the 
supplies and arms necessary for an Indian revolution. A week 
later the originators of this proposal were informed that it 
had been forwarded to Peiping, that it was expected that Pei-
ping would approve the proposal and that active collaboration 
would probably begin in a few months: 
In the light of this left-faction initiative, the CPSU 
appears to have acted naively in consenting to one more joint 
effort with Peiping to minimize the impact of the Sino-Soviet 
dispute upon the CPI. On 15 August Ghosh and Sundarayya,

E. The CPSU's August Letter and its Consequences  
In the third week of August, a few days after the joint 
Sino-Soviet meeting with Ghosh and Sundarayya, the CPI receiv-
ed from the Soviet Embassy a lengthy CPSU letter informing 
the Indian party directly for the first time of Moseoles:Agriev-
ances against Peiping. This letter was said to reiterate 
points made in Khrushchev's speech in Bucharest and in the 
21 June circular letter distributed there; it was also said 
to be based upon material provided by the July 1960 plenum 
of the CPSU Central Committee, including the speech which 
Khrushchev is known to have delivered at that plenum but which 
was never published, a sanitized version of 
this letter  the letter ap-
pears to have been circulated widely among free world parties, 
and some details of it are known. Among other things, the 
CPSU circular message again emphasized the need to win the 
uncommitted countries to the side of the bloc through pursuance 
of a "peaceful coexistence" policy coupled with generous 
economic help. The letter denied the Chinese charge that the 
CPSU was thereby "strengthening reactionary regimes,"* accused 
the CCP of being "obsessed" with the "so-called strength of 
reaction" in the non-Communist world, and declared that Pei-
ping, by magnifying "minor issues"--for example, with India--
had hurt the Communist cause and impeded the work of local 
Communist parties. The letter added that these and the other 
charges it leveled at the Chinese were being provided to give 
world Communist leaders a basis for their discussions so that 
these matters could be resolved at a scheduled meeting in Mos-
cow in November. 
*Khrushchev in August and September is known to have reite-
rated several times--particularly to the East European parties--
that the CCP had opposed the granting of economic aid to bour-
geois nationalist governments of underdeveloped countries, and 
that Peiping was particularly incensed by Soviet assistance 
to such men as Nehru and Nasser, assistance which Peiping claim-
ed was maintaining their regimes in power and hindering the 
rise of the local Communist parties. This attitude had been 
widespread in the CPI in 1954 and 1955 at the onset of the 
new Soviet policy of assisting Indian industrialization.

-(b)(3) 
This letter was used by the rightist faction to force 
the CPI into a direct attack on the Chinese par*. At a 
Central Executive Committee meeting held from 4 to 7 September, 
the rightists forced through by a small majority a secret 
resolution condemning China which had been written by Ghosh 
in consultation with Dange. An alternative leftist draft by 
Basavapunniah was rejected. All the leftists on the CC lined 
up in opposition to Ohosh's resolution; Dange afterward boasted 
that he had forced Ranadive--who would have preferred to ab-
stain and to avoid taking a position opposing the CPSU--to 
commit himself and vote against the resolution. � 
This September secret resolution backed-the Soviet line 
on the possibility of averting war, on the significance of the 
20th CPSU Congress, on the increasing bloc deterence of im-
perialist aggression and the dogmatism of those who did not 
think imperialism was so deterred, on the importance of the 
struggle for disarmament, on the significance for the bloc of 
the "peace zone" and of India above all, and on the increasing 
possibilities for a peaceful transition to socialism in a 
number of countries. The resolution blamed the Indian govern-
ment for giving succor to the Dalai Lama, but condemned the 
CPR for having described Kalimpong as the command center of 
the Tibetan revolt, for having said the Dalai Lama was brought 
to India under duress, and for having used the phrase "Indian 
expansionism." Peiping was accused of having made a mistaken 
assessment of the Indian situation "without any effort to as-
certain the views of the Communist Party of India." The USSR, 
on the other hand, was said to have taken a correct stand on 
the border dispute as a "conflict between two countries of 
the peace camp." Much detail was provided on the harmful ef-
fect the Chinese actions had had on the CPI. It was recognized 
that there had been a change for the better in Peiping's line 
alter the October 1959 visit of the CPI delegation, but it was 
said that this had happened too late. The CCP errors were said 
to have been the result of a new and mistaken assessment of 
the role of the national bourgeoisie of India. The CPI reaf-
firmed its disagreement with this assessment, and its belief 
in peaceful transition to socialism as the basis of Indian 
party policy. Finally, the resolution expressed concern over 
the open discussion of Sino-Soviet divergencies in the bloc 
press, which, it said, "has done damage to the Communist move-
ment;" along the same line, it criticized the actions of Liu 
Ning-i at the WFTU meeting in bringing party disputes openly 
before non-party bodies.

Along with this secret resolution, the Central Executive 
Committee adopted a public resolution omitting any mention of 
China but otherwise similarly supporting Soviet positions on 
the averting of war, on policy toward India, on the non-violent 
transition to socialism, and on the "creative" application, of 
Marxism-Leninism truths. This resolution explicitly "reaf-
firmed" the positive assessment of the Indian Government's 
foreign policy made by the Amritsar and Palghat party congresses. 
The open resolution was. promptly summarized by TASS on 8 
September and published in Pravda two days later. 
The secret CEC resolution had been intended as the Indian 
party's written contribution to the deliberations of a multi-
party international editorial commission (on which the CPI 
was represented) which was to meet in Moscow in October':to at-
tempt to reconcile CPSU-CCP differences. Against the strenuous 
opposition of the.CP1 leftists, the CEC also agreed to have 
the document circulated to members of the CPI National Council 
and to the various Provincial Committees of the party. Below 
that level, the resolution was not to be shown but was to be 
described orally to the rank-and-file with suitable omissions. 
Dange's forces, however, were not content with this, and appear 
to have been responsible for the subsequent leak of the gist 
of the resolution to the mass-circulation Indian weekly Link--
an action which occasioned further bitter reciiminationIRG 
the leftists. 
The September resolution evoked, in fact, a violent and 
unique reaction in the left-faction strongholds. On 7 October, 
Ranadive was reported to have instructed an intermediary to 
inform the Chinese Embassy that this resolution. had already 
been formally opposed by the.provincial parties of West Bengal, 
the Punjab, and Tamilnad. In fact, the West Bengal and Punjab 
organizations had not yet done this, and there is no evidence 
that the Tamilnad party ever did so. However, certain details 
which.Ranadive told the Chinese embassy had been placed in these 
leftist resolutions were eventually found in the secret.resolu-
tions subsequently passed by both West Bengal and the Punjab, 
suggesting that a coordinated attack on the controversial CEC 
resolution may have been organized in advance from the center. 
On 21 October the West Bengal party passed three resolu-
tions containing the only explicit attacks on the CPSU and on 
Khrushchev personally known with certainty to have been made

by any Communist party organization in the world during the 
1960 Sino-Soviet struggle. Although these resolutions were 
supposed to be secret, at least one of them was promptly 
leaked into the Indian bourgeois press, presumably in answer 
to the earlier rightist-inspired leaks. 
The first West Bengal resolution, on questions of the 
international Communist movement, stressed the provision of 
the 1957 Moscow Declaration that revisionism is the main 
danger facing the movement, and found the views of the CPSU 
difficult to reconcile with this. The 20th and 21st CPSU 
Congresses and the statements of CPSU leaders were criticized 
for ignoring the danger of revisionism. Khrushchev and other 
Soviet leaders were attacked for having used language about 
the imperialist leaders that had created confusion and illu-
sions among the people. The Chinese party was defended as 
having always supported peaceful negotiations, although mild 
regret was expressed that some of the recent CCP writings 
could create the impression that the Chinese did not fully 
appreciate the significance of such negotiations. The CCP 
was lavishly praised for the active struggle it had carried 
on regarding Algeria and colonialism generally; "in this 
respect," said the West Bengal party, "the position of the 
CPSU was not quite strong until recently." Many writings and 
statements of CPSU leaders during the past year were said to 
have failed to stress properly the importance of mass strug-
gles against imperialism, creating a "wrong understanding" in 
other parties, particularly in the CPI. In particular, the 
"writings, statements and speeches of CPSU comrades" were at-
tacked for having praised the results of the domestic policies 
of the government of India "in such a way that difficulties 
were created in the way of the development of class struggle 
in our country." The West Bengal party also could not under-
stand why news of the heroic struggle it was carrying out 
against the anti-people policies of the Indian government was 
never published in the Soviet press. The resolution implied 
that the CPSU, through its stress on peaceful transition to 
socialism, was leading the CPI to rely solely on parliamentary 
elections,"which is a reformist conception." The resolution 
ended by terming both the CPSU and the CCP "the most mature, 
experienced, and leading parties," and expressed the hope that 
the CPSU would fulfill its responsibilities as leader "in a 
more inspiring way."

The second West Bengal resolution denounced the CEC action 
itself as "wrong and harmful," because the CEC had spoken out 
without having "acquainted itself with the views of the CCP." 
The CEC was accused of having acted solely on the basis of So-
viet accusations, plus the evidence of "one or two Red Flag 
articles and one or two speeches," while "convenienTTY -a-Tic-Tid-
ing to take into account a number of articles and speeches of 
the Soviet leaders and some documents of the CPSU in the con-
text of which the Red Flag articles were written"--that is, 
the Soviet provocafT6n-g�TwHich had obliged Peiping to speak 
out. This resolution demanded that the Indian party take 
particular care in its actions "because the divergencies of 
opinion were primarily between two great Communist parties of 
the world, both of whom have rich revolutionary experience, 
have successfully applied Marxism-Leninism to concrete condi-
tions and have led great revolutions, and both of whom exert  
great influence On the course of the world revolutionary move-
ment." (Emphasis supplied.)* 
The third West Bengal resolution expressed "serious 
anxiety and uneasiness" over the reported news of the with-
drawal of Soviet technicians from China and the closing of 
two weeklies in Moscow and Peiping, but did not assign blame 
to either party for these events. 
The Punjab resolutions, passed on 24 October, echoed 
most of the West Bengal strictures against the CEC resolution 
and the revisionist errors of the CPI leadership, but did not 
explicitly attack the CPSU. The resolutions of both provin-
cial organizations traced the growth of revisionist influences 
in the CPI in some detail, touching on the pernicious effects 
of deStalinization, the 1956 New Times Rubinstein article, the 
reactions to the Hungarian revolution and the Nagy execution, 
the Kerala parliamentary experiment, and the CPI's handling 
of Eisenhower's 1959 visit. 
*A resolution very similar to this is known to have been 
placed before a meeting of the Andhra party in November by 
forces led by the local left-faction leader Sundarayya; but 
it was defeated.

It is characteristic of the present relationship of the 
CPSU to the Indian party that the authors of these resolu-
tions--and particularly of the West Bengal direct attack on 
the CPSU--to this day are not known to have been reprimanded 
or attacked by either the CPSU or the central CPI organs, but 
on the contrary have been courted by the CPSU and have re-
mained in positions of authority within their provincial 
organizations. 
F. The Hanoi Confrontation and the CCWs September Letter 
There is reason to believe that the Punjab and West Ben-
gal resolutions were prepared under the influence of guidance 
which the leftist faction received from the Chinese party 
shortly after the Third Vietnamese Party Congress of 5-15 
September. The CPI was represented at this Hanoi Congress 
by one man from each wing of the party: K. Damodaran, a 
prominent Kerala rightist who had rebuked Basavapunniah and 
Gupta at the August, CEC meeting for not having supported the 
CPSU at Bucharest; and Hare7K�ishna_Konar,one-OrAhe--moSt 
militant of the West Bengal leaders. 
The Hanoi Congress was the apparent scene of intensive 
lobbying among the Soviets, Chinese, and Vietnamese for the 
support of the Vietnamese party; it was there also that So-
viet delegate Mukhitdinov made a public condemnation of "dog-
matists" who wanted to "force on the other side" their er-
roneous ideas. There is no evidence that the two Indian 
delegates had any part in these negotiations, but it is 
known that Konar and Damodaran did have at least one private 
joint meeting with Soviet representatives during the congress. 
At this meeting, Konar asked the Soviets a series of hostile 
questions, covering points later touched on in the West Bengal 
attack on the CPSU: he alluded to the harmful nature of Khru-
shchev's remark at the 20th CPSU Congress on the improvement 
in Indian living conditions, he asked why there had been no 
coverage of the Indian strikes and struggles in the Soviet 
press, and he called attention to the confusion which had been 
created by the Soviet action in calling Eisenhower a man of 
peace, thereby "dulling the people's vigilance." The Soviets 
replied to these points in a notably defensive manner, deny-
ing that they had dulled anyone's vigilance, denying that

Khrushchev's 20th Congress remark had been harmful, and promis-
ing to improve Soviet press coverage of the Indian party's 
anti-government struggles (a promise never kept). In their 
turn, the Soviet representatives asked Konar and Damodaran 
for their views on the Bucharest events; Damodaran replied in 
support of the Soviet line, while Konar reportedly answered 
"as at the /"August7 CEC meeting"--that is, in agreement with 
the CCP. � 
(b)(3) 
At one point during the congress, Damodaran and Konar 
appear to have also had an extended discussion of the Sino-
Indian border question with the Chinese delegation, during 
which Damodaran reportedly asked why Peiping had not been 
willing to give up land to settle the question as the Soviets 
had done in the 1920s in the case of Turkey and Iran (repeat-
ing a point made in the August CPSU letter to the CPI). Fol-
lowing the congress, Li Fu-chun, the chief CCP delegate, ac-
companied the two CPI representatives to Peiping, where they 
had discussions with Chou En-lai.* Chou evidently gave most 
of his attention to the leftist Konar, and relatively little 
time to Damodaran, who subsequently complained of the cold 
treatment he had received in Peiping. During one joint meet-
ing with both Konar and Damodaran, however, Chou is said to 
have taunted them with the news of the anti-Chinese September 
Central Executive Committee resolution (which had reportedly 
been passed to the CPR Consul General in Calcutta by West 
Bengal leaders). the Chinese (W(1) 
leaders at this meeting furiously attacked the resolution, (b)(3) 
saying that the Indian party had wronglyaassessed the implica-
tions of the Sino-Soviet dispute and had shown that it harbored 
*The Vietnamese Party Congress was not the only scene of 
Chinese and Soviet proselytizing of Indian party representa-
tives abroad in September. At about the time that Konar and 
Damodaran were flying from Hanoi to Peiping, the head of the 
All-India Youth Federation (a CPI front) at a World Youth 
Forum meeting in Moscow was being buttonholed by representa-
tives of the All-China Youth Federation and the Soviet Komsomol 
in turn and harrangued with the two parties' opposing argu-
ments on disarmament and war.

illusions about Nehru. The Chinese told Konar and Damodaran 
that they had explained to Ghosh the reasons for their actions 
in the border dispute and therefore did not know why he had 
condemned them in the CEC resolution; they added that they 
knew, however, that this resolution had not been unanimous. 
The CCP also appears to have given Konar a separate 
lengthy briefing which reiterated the overall Chinese posi-
tion on points in dispute with the CPSU. Judging from the 
oral report which Konar subsequently gave to a West Bengal 
party meeting in Calcutta, this briefing actually constituted 
a summary of a letter which the CCP had sent to the CPSU on 
10 September and was to present to the international editorial 
commission in Moscow in October, defending Chinese conduct 
against charges made in the 21 June CPSU letter and attacking 
Soviet positions, on war, peaceful transition, and policy to-
ward the national bourgeoisie. According to the version of 
this CCP letter eventually presented to the international 
commission, Peiping inter alia denied that it had discarded 
a policy of seeking to conciliate the neutral countries of 
Asia and Africa, and denied that it had called the national 
bourgeoisie of these countries "imperialist." The CCP heavily 
emphasized, however, the contradictory and unreliable nature 
of the national bourgeoisie, particularly in India, where the 
bourgeoisie "shows an increasing internal anti-democratic 
tendency and is gradually retreating from its external anti-
imperialist position," although it still retains a neutral 
posture. It was for this reason, said the Chinese party, 
"that the incidents with China occurred and that India resist-
ed reaching an accord." But the CPSU, said Peiping, supported 
the Indian bourgeoisie; although Moscow appeared to agree 
with the Chinese policy of "unity and struggle" toward them, 
yet the CPSU "was opposed to the fight which we waged against 
the governing classes of India when they attacked us." 
Although it has been reported that Konar had several 
private meetings with the CCP delegation in Hanoi, during 
which he may have been given some of this information, it 
seems probable that his principal briefing took place during 
his lengthy interview with Chou in Peiping. According to one 
report, it was in Chou's presence that Li Fu-chun read out to 
Konar excerpts from the 10 September letter. At the same 
time, the CCP reportedly told Konar that the full 150-page 
letter would eventually be sent to the CPI--in Calcutta, and 
only thereafter to New Delhi; the Chinese were said to be

,determined to ensure that the letter came first into friendly 
left-faction hands in West Bengal. There is no evidence, how-
ever, as to whether or not this promised full text was ever 
received. On the other hand, the CPI leftists are believed 
to have made extensive use of the summary of the letter which 
Konar had obtained. Upon returning to India, Konar reported 
on what he had been told to the Central Secretariat in late 
September, and then to the Calcutta party organization on 5 
October. Konar also seems to have circulated a document para-
phrasing the CCP letter within the West Bengal party, among 
the leftists in the Central Secretariat, and possibly else-
where within the CPI; subsequently, the CPI rightists made 
an abortive attempt to have him censured for this activity. 
There is little doubt that the West Bengal anti-Soviet resolu-
tions of 21 October were strongly influenced by the Peiping 
letter, and that it was to this Chinese answer which the West 
Bengal party was alluding when it said that the Central Execu-
tive Committee should have waited to "acquaint itself with 
the views of the CCP." 
G. The Moscow Conference (November)  
The Indian party delegation which attended the 81-party 
conference in Moscow in November 1960 was a balanced one, in-
cluding, in addition to Ghosh, Dange, representing the right 
wing, Namboodiripad afid Ramarurthi, representing the center, 
and Bhupesh Gupta, representing the leftists. The delegation 
was reportedly organized in this way because the CPSU, in sub-
mitting its formal invitation to the CPI to send five delegates, 
had recommended that they include persons who had opposed the 
September CEC resolution as well as some who had supported it. 
This action by the Soviet party--which is consistent with the 
subsequent attitude of the CPSU, and particularly with the 
conduct of Suslov at the CPI congress the following April--
demonstrated that Moscow had no intention of abandoning 
authority over the CPI leftists to Peiping and was determined 
to try to prevent the further polarization of the Indian party 
along pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese lines. While this Soviet 
policy, coupled with the adoption of a line slightly more cri-
tical of Nehru, was eventually to improve the CPSU position 
among some of the CPI leftists and fora time prevent further 
anti-Soviet outbreaks such as the October 1960 West Bengal

resolution, the long-run objective has not to date been 
achieved: the ideological division of the party has per-
sisted and Chinese prestige within sections of the party 
has continued to be very strong. 
The first effect of this Soviet effort to regain ascedancy 
over the leftists was to inhibit Ghosh somewhat in his sup-
port for the CPSU at the Moscow meetings. Both in the editorial 
commission meetings in October (which prepared a draft of the 
Moscow Statement) and the full 81-party meetings in November 
(which fought over the draft and finally adopted the Statement) 
Ghosh made vigorous indictments of the CPR's policy toward In-
dia during the Tibetan revolt and the growth of the border dis-
pute, along the lines of the September CPI resolution. In so 
doing Ghosh backed the CPSU in what was one of the principal 
points at issue in the Moscow debates between Teng Hsiao-ping 
and the Soviet spokesmen: Communist policy toward Nehru and 
other leaders of the national bourgeoisie. In certain other 
respects, however, Ghosh showed a tendency to hedge. He 
made several gestures calculated to propitiate admirers of 
Peiping, and, most notably, did not support the CPSU on the 
central question at stake in the conference--the question of 
authority within the international movement, and whether or 
not a condemnation of "factional activity" should be included 
in the Statement -(*hich wouldrimply Chinese acceptance of the 
rule of the Soviet majority). In the end, the Soviets were 
forced to yield to Peiping on this point rather than accept 
an open split in the world movement, and the final document 
did not condemn factional activity. 
According to an Italian party report on the conference 
regarded as probably true, the Indian delegates, while sup-
porting most elements of the Soviet line, made it known that 
they would not sign the document unless the Chinese agreed 
to it, because the CPI would otherwise have split into pro-
Soviet and pro-Chinese segments. It is this concern to secure 
the continued adherence of the CPI leftists which seems to 
have restrained Ghosh's conduct. Bhupesh Gupta, the principal 
leftist on the Indian delegation, had reportedly warned before 
leaving India that he would not support the anti-Chinese line 
of the September CPI resolution and might openly back Peiping; 
yet after the conference, CPI spokesmen repeatedly emphasized 
to party meetings that Ghosh's Moscow speech had been pre-
viously endorsed by all members of the CPI delegation. It is

...sgensff 
possible that the CPI delegation succeeded in persuading Gupta 
not to object to Ghosh's line on the border issue on condition 
that Ghodh deolined to support the CPSU on the question of 
factionalism and discipline, a more vital matter both tb the 
CCP and to its Indian adherents. 
Private Meetings with CPSU and CCP: At the close of the 
Moscow conference, the Indian delegation had several private 
conversations with the Soviet leaders, while Gupta also appears 
to have conferred with the CCP representatives, to whom he was 
introduced by Peng Chen, whom he had met at Bucharest. Dange 
also subsequently claimed that there had been a separate three-
way meeting of the CPI, CPSU, and CCP, at whichlhe and an un-
named Chinese delegate had a heated verbal exchange, calling 
each other "revisionist" and "adventurist." According to 
Dange, at this meeting the CCP finally agreed that it would 
not create any more incidents on the Indian border before the 
1962 elections, to avoid further injury to the CPI. While 
there is nothing improbable in this--and while such a Chinese 
commitment would be consistent with another commitment which 
Peiping is reported to have made to Khrushchev to give him a 
period of grace of undetermined length to test the intentions 
of the new American administration--Dange's claim has not been 
confirmed, and has been denied by certain of the CPI leftists. 
The entire CPI delegation seems to have conferred with 
Suslov at the beginning of December, while Ghosh alone had 
another interview with Suslov and Ponomarev on the 9th, after 
the rest of the Indian delegation had gone home. Only two 
points emerge with any clarity from these private conferences. 
First, the Soviets again declined to furnish the CPI with a 
clear-cut line to take toward Nehru, again unhelpfully tell-
ing the Indian party to work out its own policy without regard 
to the public Soviet attitude toward the Prime Minister. 
Secondly, it seems to have been agreed between the So-
viets and the Indian leaders that a peaceful transition to 
power would not be possible in India without the creation of 
an armed revolutionary capability as a second string to the 
party's bows to be held in reserve. The CPSU had been press-
ing the CPI off and on for several years to build up such a 
subsidiary underground mechanism, and had sometimes encoun.:, 
terdiconsiderable resistance to this suggestion from the ad-
herents of the parliamentary line, including Ghosh--resist-
ance about which the Indian militants and Peiping had both 
bitterly complained. Following the National Council meeting

in Meerut in November 1959, at a time when the CPI was seriously 
expecting to be outlawed as a result of the Chinese border 
crisis, the party had reportedly decided to reactivate its un-
derground apparatus. Organizational work along this line had 
apparently beenIsuspended in the middle of 1960, however, as 
a result of insecurity resulting from factional activity as-
sociated with the Sino-Soviet dispute. (In answer to a ques-
tion from a foreign Communist delegate at the Vietnamese Party 
Congress in September, Konar had reportedly declared that the 
CPI did not then have an underground organization functioning 
on an all-India scale, but that such an organization existed 
in West Bengal which could give shelter to party members in 
times of crisis.) 
The renewed Soviet effort in Moscow in December to have 
the Indian party return to building an underground organiza-
tion was probably the result of three factors: first, a So-
viet estimatethat a possibility existed that right-wing mili-
tary dictatorship could evolve in India after Nehru's death; 
second, the adoption of a somewhat more militant CPSU line 
than heretofore toward the national liberation movement in 
general (although this line was still considerably more cautious 
than that of Peiping); and third, likely CPSU awareness that 
the CPI leftists had begun to bypass Moscow in appealing to 
Peiping for help in building an underground organization.

VI. Tlit INDIAN PARTY APPROACHES A SPLIT: 1961 
The year 1960 ended with the left faction of the CPI con-
tinuing to report to the Chinese party and to receive guidance 
from it, while gathering strength throughout India for an as-
sault on the central party machinery in 1961. There was a 
gradual increase in leftist strength and assertiveness through-
out the Indian party before the party congress met in April 
1961, and Suslov, the CPSU delegate to that congress, was ob-
liged to counsel Ghosh to make substantial concessions to the 
leftists on the wording of the party's political resolutiOh 
to preserve Ghosh in office as general secretary and to pre-
vent a threatened open split in the party. There is good evi-
dence, nevertheless, that the CPSU and Ghosh themselves favor-
ed a balanced line including both support and criticism of as-
pects of Nehru's foreign and domestic policies, and a long-
term strategy of building a national democratic front through 
cooperation with "progressive" Congress Party leaders to 
achieve limited non-socialist reforms as a prelude to the 
gradual Communist assumption of power. Suslov did not have 
to contend with direct Chinese competition at the CPI Congress, 
the prospective CCP representatives having been ordered to 
leave India beforehand by the New Delhi government. 
While the new National Council elected by the Congress 
had a reduced rightist majority--because of the leftists' 
threat to break up the party unless their wishes were acceded 
to--the rightists subsequently used this National Council 
majority to reverse leftist control of the Central Executive 
Committee and the Central Secretariat, the two top party or-
gans charged with running the party. When Ghosh led a balanc-
ed CPI delegation to the 22nd CPSU Congress in October, how-
ever, even moderates who were normally staunch CPSU supporters 
were shaken by the open attacks there on the Albanian leaders 
and the renewed assault on Stalin. Ghosh indicated his reser-
vatiOns about Khrushchev's course of action by declining to 
attack Albania in his speech to the CPSU Congress--like a num-
ber of other normally pro-CPSU foreign delegates--although two 
months later, again like the leaders of some other parties, 
he belatedly added his mild disapproval of the Albanians. 
Greater turmoil resulted within the CPI as a consequence of 
this CPSU Congress than had ever existed before, both because 
of the new CPSU offensive against Albania and the CCP and 
_ageMET 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
because of the attacks on Stalin and the displacement of Stalin's 
body. There were widespread attacks on Moscow and Khrushchev 
over these actions within all factions of the CPI, and at least 
one provincial party organization--that of Andhra Pradesh--passed 
a resolution condemning the CPSU, the second such resolution to 
be passed within the CPI in little more than a year. Ghosh even-
tually published an article publicly regretting the manner in 
which Moscow had again embarked on deStalinization, and declar-
ing that the CPSU had forfeited its claim to infallibility. 
These internal difficulties of the CPI were greatly aug-
mented by the simultaneous rekindling of the Sino-Indian bor-
der dispute, a statement by Ghosh strongly attacking the CPR 
and a subsequent People's Daily editorial condemning both Nehru 
and Ghosh. At the close of 1961, both leftist and rightist CPI 
leaders were warning of the likelihood of an open split in the 
Indian party after the elections of February 1962. While it 
seemed likely that the CPSU would make every effort again to 
prevent such a split, Moscow's chances of success in this ef-
fort were dependent on such factors as the future course of 
Sino-Soviet relations, the fortunes of the "peaceful coexist-
ence" line, and the number of concessions Moscow was willing 
to make again to the CPI leftists. The Soviet problem was 
further complicated by the death of Ghosh in Jaunary 1962, and 
the lack of a suitable successor combining loyalty to the CPSU 
with acceptability to both wings of the Indian party. 
A. Left-Faction Resurgence Before the April Congress  
The long and defiant struggle of the Chinese party against 
the CPSU in Moscow before the eyes of the entire movement, the 
near-standoff between Chinese and Soviet positions in the final 
Statement of the Moscow Conference, the Soviet surrender to Pei-
ping on the key issue of whether to condemn factionalism in the 
Statement, and above all, the fact that both the CCP and the In-
dian party leftists stood unpunished and unchastened after their 
direct attacks on the CPSU--all this had the effect of encourag-
ing the militant wing of the CPI, of emboldening these leftists 
in their efforts to strengthen their position throughout the 
party in preparation for the capture of control of the party at 
the coming party congress. 
The most immediate sign of this emboldened leftist atti-
tude was found in the blatantly anti-Khrushchev and anti-CPSU 
whispering campaign about the Moscow conference which was con-
ducted within the party shortly after the conference by the 
leftists in the party center--Basavapunniah, Bhupesh Gupta, 
and particularly Ranadive. Disseminated in this way were the

__,SEGRET 
assertions that the CCP had been supported against Moscow 
by all the Asian parties except India, by many Latin American 
parties, and by Czechoslovakia as well as Albania; that the 
Soviets had replied in a weak and unsatisfactory way to Teng 
Hsiao-ping's powerful criticisms of Khrushchev and his policies, 
and that the CPSU had eventually been forced to acknowledge 
that it had made major mistakes; that the Soviets had specifii,-
caly admitted that their criticism of China on the border is-
sue had been wrong; that Moscow had agreed to support whatever 
policy the CPR adopted in the future on the border dispute; 
that Peiping had been given authority over all the Asian 
parties, and particularly over the CPI,* and that Suslov had 
sternly overcome Ghosh's objections to this; and finally, 
that Moscow had agreed to supply Peiping with.the.technical 
knowledge and all the assistance needed for the production 
of atomic weapons. It is virtually certain that all of these 
statements were false; but what was more significant was the 
openly anti-Soviet attitude which the leftists now were will-
ing to convey through such fabrications. 
This defiant leftist attitude was also demonstrated At 
CPI provincial party meetings toward the close of the year.. 
In late November, a meeting of the West Bengal party by an 
overwhelming vote formally reaffirmed the pro-Peiping and 
anti-CPSU resolution adopted the previous month. Speaking at 
this meeting, Konar reportedly stated that he and the West 
Bengal Communist Party would never accept a "Moscow line that 
did not correspond to the Indian realities." He added that 
the day of abject CPI acceptance of Moscow policy was over, 
that "policy made in Moscow" no longer carried much prestige. 
He said that the West Bengal party would undertake a full pro-
gram of peasant and industrial agitation the next year which 
would "further vindicate the West Bengal CP stand that con-
tinued social revolution as conceived by the Chinese party is 
vital to the Indain Communist movement." Konar cited the 
cases of Cuba, Algeria, and the Congo to support the claim 
that social revolution, even using violent means, did not mean 
an inevitable international war; he professed to believe that 
China had extended support all the way to Cuba, and would 
therefore have no difficulty in supporting the CPI. In short, 
*This report recurred several times; it seems to be the 
favorite wish-fantasy of the CPI left faction.

he held that the Soviet thesis of peaceful coexistence had 
been used merely as an excuse for inactivity by the Indian 
party, and he refused to put up with this. 
Left-faction assertiveness also was marked at meetings 
of the Kerala and Andhra parties held in early December; 
moderate leaders in both organizations were reported shocked 
at the degree to which leftist sentiment had increased. In 
Kerala, extremists were encouraged by the swing toward the 
left of former chief minister Namboodiripad, who had grown 
increasingly disallusioned with Ghosh's moderate line since 
the ouster of the Kerala government in 1959. In 4ndhra, a 
powerful leftist bloc led by Sundarayya now contraled nearly 
half the strength of the provincial party; here the leftists 
refused cooperation with the rightist leaders and were able 
to prevent the election of new party organs : or the adoption 
of a political report. 
December National Council Meeting: This leftist offen-
sive was also marked at the tumultuous meetings of the Central 
Executive Committee and the National Council Which met in 
Bombay at the year's end to hear reports on the Moscow con-
ference. It was later claimed that the rightist leaders at 
the CEC meeting cast doubt on the reality of the "unity" 
achieved between the CPSU and the CCP at Moscow, for which 
they were denounced by the leftists. Several accounts agree 
that the National Council heard conflicting explanations of 
the meaning of the ambiguous Moscow Statement from the oppos-
ing factions represented on the Moscow dalegatiOn.� with 
Gupta and Namboodiripad reportedly providing. an interpreta-
tion "along the lines of the Chinese article Long Live Lenin-
ism," portraying the Statement as accepting tE-6-CCP 
while Ghosh, Dange and Ramamurthi took the opposing line. 
Much of the National Council debate apparently centered 
on the concept of the "national democratic state", which the 
CPSU had had inserted in the Moscow Statement to connote a 
transitional phase between a former colony's achievement of 
political independence and the assumption of direct Communist 
control. The national democratic state was there defined as 
one which had won complete economic independence from the im-
perialist world and assumed close economic ties with the bloc; 
which had adopted an "anti-imperialist" foreign policy; in 
which the state-owned sector had become predominant in the 
economy; and in which a list of "democratic reforms" and

SFrengf

"democratic freedoms" freedoms" had been achieved, two of the most im-
portant of which were land reform and freedom of activity for 
the Communist party. The national democratic state would be 
ruled by a broad united "anti-imperialist front" embracing 
"all patriotic strata" of the country concerned, including 
national bourgeoisie, peasantry, and proletariat. Although 
it has been implied by Soviet articles that the proletariat 
(the Communist Party) would have some importance in this coali-
tion, the minimum degree of Communist influence acceptable 
in a national democratic front and the length of time the 
Communist party should be willing to wait to secure firm con-
trol have never been spelled out by Moscow. Peiping, long 
hostile to Soviet gradualistic and evolutionary notions on 
the Communist assumption of power in underdeveloped countries, 
has been suspicious lest the new concept be used to justify 
a further indefinite delay in the achievement of Communist 
hegemony. Unlike Moscow, Peiping has therefore never publicly 
mentioned the national democratic state, and in fact was to 
print a veiled attack on the concept in People's Daily on 10 
October 1961, on the eve of the 22nd CPSU Congress. 
Against the background of this fresh Sino-Soviet disagree-
ment over a concept just placed in the equivocal Moscow State-
ment, the Indian party leaders split into three groups at the 
December National Council meeting in their application of the 
concept to India. An extreme rightist group-considered India 
already a national democratic state, thought the Indian bour-
geoisie was completing the democratic revolution in a consist-
ent manner, and wished to support Nehru on all major policies. 
A centrist-moderate rightist group did not think India now a 
national democracy, but thought it could become so; this group 
wished to oppose the reactionary policies of the Congress gov-
ernment but to support the progressive ones, and to make Nehru's 
progressive policies the basis for the establishment of a 
national democratic front in which the national bourgeoisie 
would in effect be allowed to remain temporarily in the lead. 
The leftists, who were numerous, thought Nehru's government 
was leaning more and more toward feudalism and imperialism, 
and called for a national democratic front led by the workers 
and peasantry which suitable bourgeois elements would be al-
lowed to join but not to lead; this front would lead a struggle 
against the reactionary policies of the Nehru government. This 
internal party debate, of central importance to CPI policy, 
reached no conclusion at the December 1960 National Council

meeting, and was to be resumed again at a similar meeting in 
February 1961 and still again at the party congress in April. 
A party commission was meanwhile set up to consider this is-
sue in preparing a political resolution for the February Na-
tional Council meeting. (A second commission was to write a 
new draft constitution for the party, and a third to study 
party policy toward the border dispute.) 
While the leftists were thus stalemated on the question 
of "national democracy," they were apparently successful in 
imparting a more militant and revolutionary tone to the meet-
ing generally; in line with the earlier Soviet stipulation in 
Moscow, the National Council members were reported to have 
been generally agreed that a peaceful transition to power was 
possible only if preparations for an armed capability were 
made simultaneously. Ja4pal Singh, the head of the secret 
CPI organization in the Indian armed forces, was subsequently 
said to have been heartened by this new militant trend in the 
party and to have decided to reactivate his organization in 
May 1961 following an expected victory of the left faction 
at the party congress. 
Meanwhile, the leftists--aware that the cessation of 
Sino-Soviet polemics as a result of the Moscow meeting had 
left the September CEC resolution attacking China out of date--
moved to have the National Council formally repudiate the 
resolution. While this effort narrowly failed, several sources 
agree that the National Council tacitly decided to return to 
the compromise line on the border dispute enunciated at Meerut 
in November 1959, when the CPI had upheld the MacMahon line 
in the east, termed the Ladakh border in the west undefined, 
and refused to assign blame to either country for the dispute. 
No public statement on the border issue was made, however. 
CCP Guidance to Leftists (December-February): During the 
months immediately following the Moscow Conference the left 
faction of the CPI was further encouraged by a series of con-
tacts with Chinese embassy officials in which Ranadive and 
his representatives furnished the CCP with a running account 
of the current progress of the CPI factional battle as well 
as an elaborate assessment of the history of that battle over 
the past two years. In return, Peiping furnished the CPI 
militants with repeated oral and written interpretations of 
the 1960 Moscow Statement and guidance in the application of 
- 116 - 
firsreftrr 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
the provisions of that Statement to India. The essence of 
the Chinese advice was to regard the Moscow Statement as 
guidance to parties not in power to adopt a new and more 
militant line for the attainment of power. This was said by 
Peiping to pertain especially "to newly liberated countries 
where the class struggle is not being carried on," specifi-
,cally including India, for whom the question of national 
democracy did not apply. The CCP found in the Statement the 
"implicit" assertion that peaceful coexistence between a Com-
munist nation and a newly-liberated capitalist country does 
not require the Communist party of the latter country to give 
up its struggle for Communism for the sake of good relations 
between the two countries; this, said Peiping, "clarified" 
the concept of peaceful coexistence which had confused some 
parties in the past (meaning the CPI, among others) and had 
led to a pacifist approach. While the CPSU would also main-
tain (and,had maintained for years) that the CPI should not 
give up its struggle for Communism or adopt a "pacifist ap-
proach for the sake of Soviet-Indian relations, it is certain 
that Moscow would not read into this very broad negative 
generalization the authorization for a militant, across-the-
board offensive against the Indian government which Peiping 
was trying to commend to the CPI leftists. 
CPI-CCP Correspondence: In the midst of these dealings 
with the CPI left-faction readers, Peiping at the end of Decem-
ber is believed to have sent a formal party letter to CPI head-
quarters--the only such message known to have been sent through 
official party channels after the Moscow ronflamoni-*c,  
  petalis on this Chinese message 
are sketchy, although  it was concerned in 
large part with the border issue.

Ghosh Circular Report: Meanwhile, in preparation for the 
expected battle at the forthcoming National Council meeting 
in February, soon after the close of the December National 
Council session Ghosh, with the probable assistance of Dange, 
drew up a circular report on the Moscow meeting for circulation 
to all National Council members. This report was notable for 
its polemical tone. It emphasized more than once that while 
all parties had participated in preparing the Moscow Statement 
and while all parties were equal, the CPSU had played the "lead-
ing and guiding role.. .in preparing the Draft and in convening 
and steering the conference." Ghosh followed this up by 
reiterating the Soviet line and attacking the CCP position on 
the preventability and the consequences of war, warning (as 
Ulbricht had done publicly in his report on the Moscow Confer-
ence to the East German Central Committee in December) that 
it was "wrong" to want to conceal the destructiveness of 
nuclear war from the people. Ghosh endorsed the Soviet claim 
that their peaceful coexistence line was "the general line of 
the foreign policy of the socialist countries"--a point which 
is known to have been kept out of the Moscow Statement at Chi-
nese insistence. Ghosh denied that the demand for general 
disarmament (a principal Soviet point) was a "bourgeois liber-
al" slogan, breeding "illusions about imperialism" (as the 
CCP had repeatedly said it was). He said it was the task of 
all Communist parties to approach the mobilization of the mas-
ses "through simple and clear slogans and a non-sectarian ap-
proach." He stated that it was one of the aims of peaceful 
coexistence "to draw closer towards the socialist camp the 
newly-liberated and peace-loving states, thus consolidating 
and extending the peace zone." To this clear indication of 
the approach the CPSU wished to be taken toward India Ghosh 
affixed a strong endorsement of the need to create a national 
democratic front to bring about a national democratic state. 
Such a state, he emphasized, would not be the same as a peo-
ple's democracy, since it would be ruled by a coalition of 
several classes "in which the working class and its party is 
an important but not yet the leading force."

On the other hand, Ghosh affirmed the need for the work-
ing class and the peasantry gradually to strive to "assume 
increasingly the leading role" in the national democratic(_, 
state. Moreover, Ghosh also picked up from the Moscow State-
ment the more militant positions now again espoused by the 
CPSU, on the subject of just liberation wars (which he said 
do not weaken peace but strengthen it); on theCCommunist need 
to be prepared for violent as well as non-violent transition 
to power (confirming the CPI decisions taken in Moscow in 
December); on the need not to equate the peaceful path with 
reliance solely on parliamentary elections without regard for 
mass movements; and on the need to "unmask" demagogic bour-
geois efforts to use the slogan of socialism to deceive the 
masses .(while yet "fully supporting all measures of the na-
tional government which weaken the position of imperialism 
and feudalism.") Despite the concessions to militancy listed, 
however, Ghosh's circular was on. the whole moderate in pro-
gram as well as vehemently pro-CPSU. Most notably, he im-
plied-considerable tolerance for the "progressive role" of 
the Nehru government.. 
A couple of weeks after the dispatch of this circular 
report, Ghosh courageously carried the battle into the strong-
hold of the opposition by appearing (unexpected and unwelcome, 
as the leftists remarked) at a January conference of the West 
Bengal party State Council. There he heard Jyoti Basu, the 
West Bengal secretary, attack the central party leadership as 
having failed in its responsibilities. Basu charged that the 
leadership should have issued a self-critical report on re-
visionism in the CPI; he said the "so-called nationalist fac-
tion has forgotten Marxism and trailed behind the bourgeoisie;" 
he denounced the rightists for having mouthed diatribes against 
"China and international Communism;" and he found that the 
central leadership had harbored illusions about parliamentary 
politics, which had been used as a refuge from which to ignore 
mass movements. A West Bengal speaker who subsequently at-
tempted to defend Ghosh's moderate program was almost shouted 
down, and found himself generally isolated at the meeting. 
Ghosh thereupon g9t up and pugnaciously defended himself, 
the authority of the CPSU, and the moderate program he espous-
ed for the CPI. Ultimately, he said, it was the Soviet draft 
enriched and enlarged by amendments and discussions that had 
been adopted almost in its entirety by the Moscow Conference. 
From this, fact,..

it was proved beyond doubt that the Soviet party 
was the leader of the World Communist movement--
both in theory and in practice. If this basic 
fact were forgotten, the worst form of devia-
tAonism might creep into any national party giv-
ing rise to revisionism and chauvinism. It would 
be childish to even attempt to challenge the lead-
ership of the Soviet Party or to think in that 
line. It was quite a different thing to point out 
mistakes or question certain formulations of the 
Soviet Party, but to question its leadership was 
altogether a foolish act. Even pointing out mis-
takes or suggesting possible rectification's should 
not be done in a manner so as to undermine the So-
viet Party or to cast aspersions against it. 
Unfortunately, Ghosh told the West Bengal leaders, in 
many centers in India attempts had been made to undermine the 
leadership of the Soviet party. Ghosh made a peculiar cita-
tion of authority to demonstrate the foolishness of such at-
tempts: the Chinese party, he claimed, however great its dif-
ferences with the CPSU on certain questions, had never tried 
in its writings or statements to belittle or undermine the 
Soviet leadership. (This would probably have been a good tack 
to take with the West Bengal party chiefs if they had not had 
abundant evidence to the contrary.) Ghosh also asserted that 
one should not forget that democratic centralism means that 
a strong center must guide all lower units--ignoring the fact 
that the CCP at Moscow had specifically rejected the notion 
that the discipline of democratic centralism applies in rela-
tions between parties of the international Communist movement. 
In addition, Ghosh upheld the line he had marked out in 
the circular report for a CPI transition to power without 
civil war through utilization of the parliamentary method 
bolstered by a united front of workers, peasants and progres-
sive bourgeoisie. The West Bengal party conference, however, 
rejected this approach and adopted one emphasizing that Nehru 
was not to be trusted, that there could be no unity "with any 
section of the bourgeoisie who are allied with the ruling 
class," that the worker-peasant alliance (in fact, the Communist 
party) must lead and control the national democratic front 
from the very beg4nning, and that a "fierce campaign" must be 
launched against the "anti-people policy of the government."

Jyoti Basu meanwhile retired as party leader to concentrate 
on the forthcoming 1961 election campaign, but was replaced 
by another prominent leftist and strong supporter of the CCP, 
Promode Das Gupta. The leftists in control of the West Bengal 
machine at the same time succeeded in purging the only right-
ist previously represented on the West Bengal Secretariat. 
February National Council Meeting: A few weeks later, 
the National Council met to decide on the draft political and 
organizational reports to be-placed before the party congress 
in April, as well as on a new draft program for the party to 
replace the one adopted in 1951. The National Council was 
also to decide on a new public resolution on the border dis-
pute to be issued by the party; this appeared to be necessitated 
by the- Indian Government's publication in mid-February of 
the findings of the Indian team that had been negotiating with 
the CPR. 
In most cases, the party commissions that had been pre-
paring the individual draft reports had split along familiar 
lines into right and left segments, so that the National Coun-
cil was presented with two or more drafts on each subject. 
For example, Ghosh and Ranadive each presented his version of 
the long-awaited party political resolution. Ghosh's resolu-
tion set forth the aim of replacing the present "vacillating" 
and "compromising" government with a government of a national 
democratic front which in turn would facilitate the peaceful 
transition to socialism. It called for a broad-based campaign 
seeking the cooperation of "patriotic elements in every-party" 
to establish this front and secure gradual changes in the gov-
ernment's policies. In addition to endorsing the usual "united 
front from below" tactic of seeking to draw support from the 
rank-and-file of the Congress and of such parties as the Paja 
Socialists, Ghosh's resolution called for the employment of 
"united front from above" tactics in some cases--for example, 
the conclusion of direct alliances with local Congress com-
mittees or other local organizations "to which the peasants 
who are not under our influence are politically attached."* 
*It was just such a proposal by a minority right-wing West 
Bengal party leader that had been angrily shouted down at the 
January West Bengal provincial meeting Ghosh had addressed.

Ghosh identified only the extreme right of the Congress party 
and of the big bourgeoisie as the enemy of the national demo-
cratic front, and consequently declared that .the "democratic 
forces must adopt a correct attitude towards the small and 
medium industrialists" who are anti-imperialist, and that 
Communist-controlled trade unions must even abate their de-
mands toward these industrialists in the interests Of "draw-
ing them closer to the democratic masses." While.criticizing 
strongly the Indian government and Nehru for their policies 
toward feudalism, Western loans, land reform, and the Com-
munist Kerala regime, this resolution several times praised 
Nehru, particularly for his foreign policy and his support 
for the public sector of the Indian economy. 
In contrast, Ranadive's resolution took a much harsher 
view of Nehru, did not support alliances with local Congress 
committees, was not so eager to bring the bourgeoisie into 
the democratic front, and was much stronger in its exposition 
of the need to struggle against the policies of the Indian 
government. While Ghosh's political resolution was approved 
with minor amendments by the National Council, the leftists 
secured the right to circulate Ranadive's draft with Ghosh's 
and to have both considered by the party Congress in April. 
A similar result followed the National Council battle 
over the proposed versions of the new long-range party pro-
gram. Opposing drafts were submitted by Dange and Bhupesh 
Gupta. Dange's draft program, among other things, reportedly 
called for increased emphasis on the development of very 
broad party front groups in which very diverse non-Communists 
would be brought to the forefront; stressed that the CPI 
should make every effort to win the support of progressive 
members of the Congress Party throughout India; and proposed 
that the CPI support Congressmen judged sympathetic to the CPI 
in local and national elections. Gupta's draft attacked 
Nehru's policies at great length, opposed the creation of more 
broad-based front groups and particularly the use of Congress-
men in these organizations, and reportedly called for an in-
ternal purge of rightist tendencies in the CPI. While Dange's 
draft was approved, Gupta also won the right to submit his 
text to the party congress. 
In the case of the organizational report, only one draft 
was submitted--by Namboodiripad--supposedly because the minority 
rightist faction on the commission preparing this report had

refused to participate. Namboodiripad's report, in addition 
to submitting a draft of a new party constitution, severely 
chastised the indiscipline in the party as well as the re-
vionist and "Parliamentary" habits of thought he found wide-
spread. While this report met with opposition in the National 
Council, it was finally decided without a formal vote to pre-
sent it to the party congress, where more severe trials await-
ed it. 
Finally, a sharp battle was fought in the National Council 
on the border issue, with inconclusive results. An effort 
by some of the rightists to secure an open condemnation of 
China was overwhelmingly defeated, and a subsequent attempt 
to obtain endorsement of the Indian case on the basis of the 
report of the Indian negotiating team was blunted. EventUally, 
a resolution was adopted and published formally reiterating 
the Meerut November 1959 formula (approval of the MacMahon 
line in the'east and of an undefined 'traditional boundary" 
in the west), blaming nobody, saying that the Indian people 
think the Indian case is strong but that China also thinks 
her case is strong, and fervently calling for more negotia-
tions. However, despite leftist protests, the resolution also 
upheld Indies exclusive right to negotiate the boundaries of 
Kashmir--of which Ladakh is a part--with China-(reproving 
CPR feelers on this subject to Pakistan), and to carry on 
frontier negotiations on behalf of Bhutan and Sikkim (reprov-
ing Chinese efforts to bypass New Delhi in contacting those 
two Indian dependencies). The inclusion of these provisions 
was a definite victory for the rightist faction. 
On the whole, the National Council meeting seems to have 
been a standoff, provisionally approving rightist positions 
on some questions and leftist positions on others, evading 
still other issues, and passing everything on to the party con-
gress for the decisive battles. The leftists tended to be 
encouraged by this outcome; they kept the Chinese party inform-
ed of events, and passed on to Peiping their optimistic fore-
cast of victory in April. Dange's forces, on the other hand,. 
were rather somber; Dange thought the rightists had won their 
last victory (such as it was) on the border issue, and expect-
ed a very close division of forces at the party congress, with 
the outcome in doubt.

Continued Swing Toward Left in Provinces: Information 
from a number of the CPI provincial organizations in the months 
before the party congress confirmed both the leftist claim of 
a swing in their direction and Dange's estimate of a very close 
alignment of forces. Leftist assertiveness was particularly 
noted on the border issue: in mid-February, while the right-
ists at the National Council meeting were vainly trying to. 
get the party to endorse the report of the Indian negotiating 
team, an organ of the Kerala party prominently published the 
gist of the report issued by,Peiping's negotiators, under the 
headline "Indian Documents Are the Products of British Imperi-
alism." In West Bengal, local party meetings were being told 
that the West Bengal party organization fully accepted the 
Chinese contention that the Indian government was keeping the 
border issue alive in order to get aid from the West. One 
West Bengal leader in late February not only publicly denied 
that the CPR had committed aggression against India, but was 
quoted by the press as declaring that "we should be ashamed 
to criticlze China, the greatest socialist country, living in 
the land of beggars." (Emphasis supplied:5-
An index of the changing balance of forces in the party 
was furnished by the reception given the two drafts of the 
political resolution--Ghosh's version which had been endorsed 
by the National Council, and Ranadive's alternative--as they 
circulated through the provincial organizations. West Bengal 
party secretary Das Gupta told the leftists on the CPI Central 
Secretariat in mid-March that he did not intend to publish the 
National Council resolution in the West Bengal organ Swadhinata; 
subsequently, the West Bengal State Council overwhelmingly 
voted to reject the National Council draft and to accept Rana-
dive's resolution. Identical action was taken in the other 
left-faction stronghold in the Punjab, despite a personal visit 
and plea by Ghosh to try to stem the tide. Dange made a similar 
appearance before the vacillating party organization of Tamilnad, 
in south India, where the former rightist Ramamurthyhad been 
reported inclining toward the left since the beginning of the 
year because of the need to preserve his position in the face 
of increasing left-faction sentiment; despite Dange's efforts, 
Tamilnad also rejected the Ghosh draft and accepted Ranadive's 
alternative. In Assam, neighboring the West Bengal organiza-
tion and often influenced by it, the party leader Phani Bora, 
a Ghosh supporter, was obliged to trim his sails and avoid 
submitting either resolution to a vote to avoid being unseated 
by his leftist opposition.

In certain other provincial organizations, however, the 
Ghosh draft was endorsed; and in the right-faction stronghold 
of Maharashtra, where Dange and Ranadive held a furious debate 
in mid-March, the leaders laid plans to lobby among uncommitted 
delegations at the party congress for the Ghosh political 
resolution, as well as for a direct indictment of the CPR on 
the border issue. 
B. Soviet and Chinese Policy Toward India Before the Congress  
These internal party struggles and maneuverings in pre-
paration for the party congress were inevitably influenced 
by the very different policies being pursued toward India by 
the Soviet Union and the CPR. The Soviet posture toward 
India. was composed, in equal parts, of a limited amount of 
pressure seeking specific foreign-policy objectives; a fair 
amount of public flattering of India and of Nehru; and dis-
creet ambivalence on the question of the Sino-Indian border. 
The Chinese attitude, on the other hand, was one of simple 
and unremitting hostility, in which Peiping's energies were 
chiefly devoted to documenting the charge that Nehru had be-
come an imperialist lackey of the United States whose every 
move was inimical to the interests of the entire bloc. 
Soviet Policy: Soviet pressure in early 1961 was chiefly 
concerned with the question of Indian support for United Na-
tions operations in the Congo, support which Moscow sought 
strenuously and unsuccessfully to have withdrawn. In this 
fort the USSR appears to have worked in close coordination 
with the central leadership of the Indian Communist party. 
The December CPI National Council meeting, for example, is-
sued a resolution mildly criticizing the Indian government 
for not having shown itself in "complete solidarity with the 
leading African governments" by having recognized the Gizenga 
regime in the Congo. Toward the end of January, an article 
by Joshi in the Republic Day issue of New Age, while generally 
praising Nehru's foreign policy, criticized his policy toward 
colonialism, saying that New Delhi had "remained silent too 
long before expressing Indian solidarity and on occasions was 
not firm enough." 
el-
In the third week of February, Nehru received letters from 
Khrushchev asking him to support Soviet demands on the Congo, 
- 125 -

Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
_sgettsf 
including the end of UN activities there. Bhupesh Gupta, a 
parliamentary spokesman of the CPI, reportedly was briefed in 
advance on these letters by the Soviet Embassy, and on 27 
February raised a question in Parliament designed to obtain 
public acknowledgement from Nehru that Khrushchev had request-
ed him not to accede to any demands from Hammarskjoldi to 
send Indian troops to the Congo. Nehru at the time would 
only acknowledge having received letters from Khrushchev, but 
subsequently made his position clear by announcing that his 
government would send a brigade of combat troops to support 
UN operations in the Congo. Thereupon, a CPSU letter to the 
CPI at the end of February reportedly requested, among other 
things, criticism of the Indian government's foreign policy 
shortcomings. An article in Izvestiya on 9 March asked, in 
passing, if it was "so essential" for the Indian people to 
support the "bankrupt" UN Secretary-General; and an article 
in the CPI's weekly New Age three days later discreetly made 
the same point. An artiae" by Ghosh published in Pravda on 
5 April said that the Indian government had shown "unwarranted 
vacillation" on the Congo issue by not having recognized 
Gizenga or attacked Hammarskjoid;; this was repeated in 
Ghosh's speech to the CPI Congress, in the Political Resolu-
tion published after the Congress, and in the advice Suslov 
reportedly gave to CPI leaders during the Congress. 
The only other major criticism made of Indian foreign 
policy by Moscow in the first half of 1961 concerned the 
Cuban invasion: on 4 April, an article placed in Litarary  
Gazette expressed at some length Soviet "bewilderment" at 
Nehru 's statement that he was unable to judge the right or 
wrong of the Cuba situation; this article was broadcast by 
Moscow six times to South Asia in English, and was understand-
ably picked up promptly by NCNA. 
These examples of pressure, however, have been more than 
balanced by the many Soviet statements and actions flattering 
and supporting the Nehru government. In December 1960, soon 
after the Moscow Conference, the Soviet New Times ran an arti-
cle appraising and ,on the whole approving the new third In-
dian five-year plan. In late January, the CPI's New Age print-
ed a two-part article by the deputy head of the Soviet Insti-
tute of Oriental Studies on Indian state cap?Aialism: a 
qualified verdict was rendered that so far state capitalism 
in India had been progressive and had fulfilled a national

-URKST 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
function. In late January a Soviet broadcast to Asia describ-
ed how India was "growing stronger year by year, becoming more 
influential and more wealthy", primarily because of her pro-
gressive foreign policy. On Indian Republic Day, 26 January, 
the Soviet leaders sent warm congratulations to the people and 
government of India and to Nehru personally, praising them 
for India's contributions to the causes of peace; disarmament, 
and the ending of colonialism. The semi-annual-CPSU slogans 
published in April similarly flattered India. On 28 April, 
a Soviet broadcast in Bengal .(possibly meant for the West ' 
Bengal Communist Party to hear) stressed that the: Soviet Union 
and India have "kept faith in the fundamental Bandung princi-
ples," and quoted.Khrushchev on the unanimity of views between 
the USSR and India on nearly all international problems placed 
before the UN. And in June another Soviet broadcast, in 
Mandarin to China, pointedly emphasized to Peiping the coopera-
tion which India had furnished the bloc in opposition to im-
perialist schemes for the recognition of "two Chinas" by the 
United Nations. 
These statements have been accompanied by the continua-
tion of Soviet assistance to the Indian economy. During a 
Kosygin visit to India in February a credit agreement between 
the two countries, negotiated and announced the previous year, 
was signed with much fanfare; and a few days later the USSR 
Ambassador in New Delhi, Benediktov, publicly denied to In-
dian newsmen published reports in the Indian press about dif-
ferences between the Soviet Union and the CPR over Soviet aid 
to India. A further sizable credit at low interest from 
Hungary was announced in March. In April the Soviet Ambassa-
dor to Mexico, while piously denying in a private conversation 
that Soviet foreign commercial activity was ordinarily sub-
ordinated to . political Motives, admitted that this was true 
in the case of India. 
Finally, with regard to the Sino-Indian border issue, 
Moscow was equivocal in the first half of 1961. On the one 
hand, the CPI was apparently instructed to say as little as 
possible. Guidance to this effect may conceivably have been 
furnished Indian party leaders in Moscow in December 1960; at 
any rate, at the end of February 1961, a letter was received 
from the CPSU, signed by Suslov, asking :the CPI not to make 
statements categorically condemning China, but on the other 
hand to do nothing either to antagonize further Indian public

_SECRET' 
opinion on this issue. This guidance was reiterated by Suslov 
during his visit to India in personal briefings to CPI leaders 
on 6 and 14 April, and the CPI went from reiteration of the 
Meerut formula (in the February National Council resolution) 
to silence on the border issue (in the resolutions of the ApFil 
party congress). At the same time, the Soviet-linked Indian' 
organ Blitz continued to manifest a strongly nationalistic, 
explicitly anti-Chinese line. The Soviet Union itself was 
non-committal, particularly in regard to the question of its 
maps of the Sino-Indian border, a topic on which New Delhi 
was repeatedly prodding Moscow during the spring. In March, 
an Indian spokesman declared that 1959 Soviet maps had shown 
Bhutan and Sikkim as independent states, whereas much older 
maps had shown them as Indian protectorates; he said India 
had brought up this matter repeatedly, the last time in Novem-
ber 1960, but that no positive reply had yet been received 
from the USSR. According to Indian government announcements, 
by April the GDR, Hungary, and North Vietnam had assured India 
that they would not print incorrect maps again, but other 
Communist countries--as Nehru put it on 21 April--"were reluct-
ant to correct them as they felt to do so would mean taking 
an active political step." 
CPR Policy: The Chinese attitude toward Nehru's govern-
ment was typified by a pamphlet published in Peiping contain-
ing a collection of the speeches Chou En-lai made during his 
1960 tour of Southeast Asia. Translated into various langu-
ages, this pamphlet contained a map of the south Asian area 
showing India as a country under imperialist domination, while 
Bhutan, Nepal, Burma, Cambodia and Indonesia were described 
as being "aligned with the Socialist countries." On 29 March 
it was disclosed in the Indian Parliament that the Indian cus-
toms had been instructed to seize all copies of this pamphlet. 
Peiping's depiction of India as the principal imperialist 
agent in Asia, surrounded by other states friendly to the bloc, 
is consistent with the policy the CPR has followed over the 
past two years of attempting to 'igalate India, its chief Asian 
rival, through the settlement of existing controversies with 
other south Asian states on terms acceptable to the latter. 
(Examples have been the settlement of the Chinese-national 
dispute with Indonesia and the border question with Burma: in 
both cases the terms agreed to by Peiping are definitely known 
to have been strongly influenced by the desire to isolate

India.) In late 1960 and early 1961, the CPR also put out 
feelers to Pakistan to negotiate the border with Kashmir and 
Ladakh (claimed by both Pakistan and India), while the Indian 
dependency Bhutan was enticed both with the prospect of in-
dependent border negotiations with China and with':the possi-
bility of economic aid from Peiping. These feelers--which 
the Indian Communist-party felt obliged to denounce publicly 
in February, both in Parliament and in a National Council 
resolution--have since led to no concrete result, except to 
stimulate the aspirations of the Bhutan government for a 
greater degree of autonomy and for Indian permission to seek 
economic aid directly from.the United States. These CPR 
gestures again demonstrated, however, Peiping's overalltattitude 
toward the Nehru government and the continued Chinese inten-
tion to seek to weaken India's position among its neighbors. 
On 14 February, Nehru revealed that during the negotiations 
of the previbus winter the CPR had stated that it respects 
only India's.'"proper" relations with plutan and Sikkim, where-
as in April 1960--Nehru claimed--Chou En-lai during his visit 
had said that China respects those relations, without qualifi-
cation. Throughout 1961, there were a number of reports 
indicating Chinese intensification of efforts at subversion 
and propaganda within Bhutan; one leaflet distributed was 
said to have warned the Bhutanese against "collusion with the 
government of India to convert Bhutan into a land of slaves." 
This Chinese attitude toward the Indian government has 
been accompanied by a determination not to virald in tho hr_  
der dispute. 
an Inaaan lettast 
  advised the Indian Foreign Ministry that the 
CPR was willing to settle the dispute by arbitration provided 
India made the first public move for this, a subsequent In-
dian attempt to test the Chinese attitude came to nothing. 
When in July R.K. Nehru, .% secretary general of the Ministry 
of External Affairs, stopped off in Peiping on his way home 
from Mongdlia, the CPR was reported to have made fresh ter-
ritorial claims to him orally; such new Chinese claims, how-
ever, have not subsequently been announced publicly. The 
Foreign Ministry official subsequently complained privately 
that the Chinese had treated him with "intolerable arrogance;"* 
*It had previously been reported that Indian diplomats in 
Peiping had frequently been humiliated and insulted, that mem-
bers of the embassy staff had even been publicly attacked and 
beaten in the streets, and that protest notes about this had not 
been answered.

in response to his reassertion of Indian claims, Liu Shao-chi 
is said to have told him that it was ridiculous of him to 
have travelled so far only to restate unacceptable conditions; 
and Mao, whom he claimed to know well, refused to see him. 
After this, both Prime Minister Nehru and a Chinese Embassy 
official in New Delhi were reported to have predicted, cor-
rectly, that relations between the two countries would con-
tinue to worsen. 
It has been a principal Chinese endeavor--still unsuccess-
ful--to obtain from the Soviet Union and the CPSU both a policy 
toward the Indian government and a Marxist appraisal of Nehru 
more consonant with Chinese national interests. In early June, 
Chen Yi was reliably reported to have again indicated Peiping's 
discontent on this score in a conversation with a bloc diplo-
mat in Geneva. Chen repeated to this bloc official the long-
standing CCP line on Nehru: his increasing closeness to Wash-
ington; his role as "spokesman for the interests of the Indian 
upper bourgeoisie"; his government's inability to solve the 
basic problems of the Indian people and consequent fear "that 
the example of the enormous accomplishments of New China will 
seduce the impoverished masses of the subcontinent;" all this 
serving to explain India:' unfriendly attitude toward China 
and its periodic formentation of frontier incidents between 
the two countries. Chen went on to assert that the Indian 
government, by following a policy of "complete duplicity," had 
even gone so far as to aspire to a certain amount of support 
from Moscow against Peiping. �Fortunately, he said, the Soviet 
press had "now" started to uniask this maneuver, which showed 
that the Soviet authorities had not let themselves be duped. 
(Chen's tone implied, however, that Moscow up to now had in-
deed let itself be duped.) Chen was intimating Chinese hopes 
that the various Soviet press allusions to Indian policy on 
the Congo and the one April Literary Gazette article criticiz-
ing Nehru over Cuba heralded a fundamental change in the So-
viet line toward India. Such expectations, however, were 
neither realistic nor (probably) sincere; there have been no 
more such direct Soviet comments, and the gap between Chinese 
and Soviet policy toward India has again widened. 
Peiping's propaganda has meanwhile continued to utilize 
every conceivable subject and pretext to attempt to discredit 
Nehru both to the bloc and the Communist movement and to the 
radical but non-Communist forces of the "national liberation

movement." Working occasionally through direct commentaries, 
but principally through frequent, selective, and highly slanted 
NCNA reportage of events and statements, Peiping has built up 
a picture of Nehru as a faithful servant of United States 
policy on the Congo, on Laos, on Cuba, and on Berlin whom 
Washington has explicitly promised to reward for these services 
with large economic assistance, and who has accordingly offer-
ed ever more favorable terms for U.S. "imperialist domination

ing Chinese campaign, while apparently directed only indident-
ally to the Indian Communist party, has nevertheless helped 
to maintain that climate of opinion within which the pro-CCP 
left faction of the CPI appraises the Indian scene. 
C. The Indian Party Congress, April  
March WPC Meeting: Two weeks before the Sixth CPI Con-
gress opened, a five-day meeting of the World Peace Council 
in New Delhi provided the Indian party with a practical demon-
stration at close quarters of the continuing differences bet-
ween Soviet and Chinese policy toward India. In addition to 
furnishing a new occasion for subdued conflict between the 
CPSU and the CCP, the events of this meeting were significant 
in that they provided what was at least the ostensible reason 
for the CCP's failure to attend the Indian party congress and 
consequent abandonment of guidance of the congress to the CPSU. 
The Chinese party indicated in advance to the left faction 
of the CPI that it intended to use the WPC meeting as a vehi-
cle for attack on the Nehru government. On 13 March, 11 days 
before the meeting opened, a senior Chinese embassy official 
in New Delhi told a CPI confidant that the main mission of 
Peiping's delegation would be to put pressure on the other 
delegations to denounce India's role in the Congo, Laos, and 
Algeria, where Indian policy was said to be based "on the Am-
erican pattern." This Chinese official emphasized to the 
Indian party leftist that Khrushchev's explicit request to 
Nehru on the Congo question had been spurned, and noted that 
President Kennedy at a press conference had quoted Nehru's 
statements to support his own views. A week later, another 
embassy official acknowledged that the Chinese delegation would 
have to fight at the WPC meeting for a denunciation of India,

f t r 
but stated that he expected many African and Asian delegations 
to assist Peiping in this effort. The Chinese embassy officers 
suggested that the importance Peiping attached to this matter 
could be judged from the importance of the delegation being 
sent; this delegation to be was headed by Liu Ning-i, president 
of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. (Liu had been 
one of the principal figures in the Sino-Soviet clash at the 
WFTU meeting in Peiping nine months before, and had subsequently 
attended the Moscow Conference of November 1960. Most notably, 
Liu had been attacked by name in the September 1960 secret 
resolution of the Indian Communist party, a resolution to which 
Peiping is known to have taken violent exception.) 
While conclusive evidence is not available, reports from 
several different sources suggest that the CPR delegation at 
the World Peace Council meeting may indeed have made an attempt 
to get some critical reference to the Indian government's policy 
on colonialism included in the WPC resolutions, and that this 
attempt was defeated through Soviet influence. The scene of 
this struggle was apparently the closed meetings held from 25 
through 28 March in the WPC commission on "Na 
ence and Abolition of Colonialism." 
a draft resolution on the Congo plac is commission 
with Chinese support contained a bitter attack an India and 
on Nehru's "pacifist attitude;" this provision was opposed by  
the Indian delegation, and was ultimately defeated.  
The CPR delegate is said to have declared 
that the so-called neutral nations were merely playing the game 
of the imperialists in-the Congo, and to have asked how such 
nations could extol Lumumba on the one hand and fail to condemn 
Hammarskjold- and the actions of the UN on the other hand; if 
these neutrals were sincere in their protestations of neutrality, 
he said, they would have recognized the Gizenga government and 
supported it. To this statement, which certainly was primarily 
aimed at India, the Soviet delegate Tikhonov was said to have 
replied that he could not accept the view of those who criti-
cized the neutral nations and said that they were playing the

..arberrr 
imperialists' game; while he thought Hammarskjold- should be 
condemned, he extolled the role of the neutrals in the main-
tenance of world peace.* 
On the other hand,   the USSR 
made considerable effort, both directly and through the CPI, 
to prevent the Sino-Indian border question from becoming an 
issue at the WPC meeting. This was in line with the position 
taken in the Suslov letter to the CPI at the end of February, 
when the CPSU apparently asked the Indian party to evade this 
topic as much as it could, consistent with the need to avoid 
complete alientation of the Indian public. Despite these So-
viet intentions, the issue kept emerging at intervals through-
out the WPC sessions, and had to be suppressed each time with 
difficulty. On the opening day, during the deliberations 
over formation of an agenda, one non-Communist Indian delegate 
proposed that a discussion be held on the question of whether 
some Indian territory was being occupied by the CPR, as a 
result of which the peace of Asia was being endangered. This 
suggestion was supported by a member of the CPI extreme right-
ist faction; and CPI leftists subsequently charged, probably 
falsely, that the latter had been encouraged by Romesh Chandra, 
the CPI functionary and Ghosh agent who was steering the WPC 
sessions. The proposal was in any case rejected by Sunderlal, 
Chairman of the All-Indian Peace Council, who made the mis-
take of publicly claiming that Prime Minister Nehru had re-
quested that the question not be discussed: a claim which 
Nehru later publicly repudiated. 
*While the USSR certainly did not want a direct attack on 
India included in any WPC resolution, this Soviet willingness 
to undertake a polemical defense of India at a front group meet-
ing may have been specially influenced by the locale of the 
WPC session. At a subsequent meeting of the Afro-Asian Peo-
ple's Solidarity Organization in Indonesia a few weeks later--
where several much stronger Sino-Soviet clashes on a number 
of issues were reported--it was reported that the Chinese dele-
gate launched a similar strong attack against India for having 
sent troops to the Congo, without contradiction from the So-
viet representative.

There were several subsequent reports to the effect that 
during one (or possibly more) at the closed meetings of WPC 
commissions some Western delegates attempted to raise the 
Sino-Indian border issue for discussion, that the CPR delega-
tion thereupon threatened to walk out of the meeting, and 
that the proposal was defeated with Soviet assistance. At 
least one CPR walkout acutally did take place over this is-
sue during the WPC proceedings, in public. On the evening 
of 24 March the Chinese delegation attended ceremonies com-
memorating the centenial anniversary of the birth of the In-
dian poet Tagore, in the course of which Indian Cultural 
Minister Kabir said that Tagore would not have remained silent 
regarding China's encroachments on Indian soil. Liu Ning-i 
followed Kabir to the platform, criticized him severely for 
being unfriendly to a peace-loving neighbor, repeated Peiping's 
version of the Tibetan and border events, implied that the 
Indian government did not have the support of most Indians 
on these matters, and concluded with the charge that India 
was attempting "to reap the seeds of confusion sowed by Brit-
ish imperialism." Liu then led the Chinese delegates out of 
the meeting. 
More important consequences flowed from this event than 
from anything else that happened at the WPC meeting. There 
was an immediate uproar among the Indian public and press; 
Nehru in Parliament a few days later termed the walkout "of-
fensive"; and the right wing of the Indian Communist party 
made haste publicly to disown Liu: on 3 April Mrs. Renu 
Chakravarty declared in Parliament that "we do not agree at 
all" with "certain remarks made by the Chinese... We do not 
like what the Chinese did or said." Subsequently, the Indian 
government refused to extend the visas of those members of 
the Chinese delegation, including Liu, who had planned to re-
main in India after the WPC meeting to attend the Indian Com-
munist party congress opening ten days later. The Ministry 
of External Affairs told Sunderlal that the continued presence 
in the country of the Chinese delegation would not be welcome. 
Peiping did not attempt to send another delegation to 
attend the CPI Congress, and the Indian government did not pre-
vent Moscow from sending a delegation led by Suslov to the 
Congress. The result was that the CPSU had the field to it-
self in providing guidance to the Indian party at an event 
of central importance. It seems likely that the Indian government

had this in mind from the first, that New Delhi never had any 
,intention of allowing the CCP to be present to encourage the 
CPI leftists and lobby for a thoroughly militant'line,-and 
that the government wished the Indian Communist'partY'to be 
oriented along the moderate line New Delhi associated-With the 
Soviet Union..*- It is therefore likely that Liu Ning-l's'visa 
would not have been extended in any case; it is even Possible 
that Minister Kabir's provocatory remarks were planned delib-
erately to entrap Liu into making public statements which could 
Tbe used to justify this refusal and to, make'- it politically 
un-
feasible for the CPI to protest.** 
�, Nevertheless, the actions of the CCP would seem peculiarly 
inept if it were assumed that a primary object of Peiping was 
to attempt to secure predominance within the CPI at this time. 
If this had been the first consideration, it would have been 
appropriate (despite the threat to national pride) to .make 
another attempt to get a CCP delegation admitted to India to 
attend the party congress. Moreover, if Liu Ning-i's atten-
dance at the congress on Indian soil had been considered vital, 
it would . seem extraordinary to have first sent him to 
the World Peace Council meeting with instructions to attempt 
*Similarly, New Delhi has on occasion sought to prevent CPI 
extremists from making contact with CPSU leaders: thus in 
February 1959 it was reported that Ranadive, originally named 
to the CPI delegation to the 21st CPSU Congress, had been re-
fused a passport, while more moderate CPI leaders had been 
given passports. In another step likely to have been intended 
at least in part to weaken the left faction of the CPI, the 
Indian government on 27 December 1961 was to withdraw the 
foreign exchange trading license of the Bank of China; this 
bank had reportedly been used as a base for CCP financing of 
its adherents within the Indian Communist party. 
**Not only did the CPI not protest the exclusion of the Chi-
nese, but it seemed to go out of its way to avoid mentioning 
the fact. Thus on 23 April the article on the opening of the 
party Congress carried in New Age noted that "the fraternal 
delegates from the parties-OT France, German Democratic Repub-
lic and Israel were unfortunately refused visas and could not 
attend;" there was no allusion to Liu Ning-i or the Chinese 
party.

to secure a public condemnation of Indian government policy. 
Finally, if Peiping had had both the intention and the serious 
hope of securing a major change in the balance of forces with-
in the CPI, it would probably have appointed a delegation to 
the congress headed by a man equal in stature to Suslov (num-
ber three or four in the Soviet hierarchy), rather than by 
Liu Ning-i--who, while important, is a second-echelon figure 
not belonging to the CCP Politburo.* (In June, the CCP did 
appoint such a man--Teng Hsiao-ping, CCP secretary-general--
to lead a delegation to the Japanese party congress, to counter 
the CPSU assignment of Mukhitdinov, a lower-ranking Presidium 
member, the Japanese government, however, refused to admit 
either delegation.) These considerations suggest that Peiping 
had decided in March that despite the undeniable increase in 
CPI left-faction strength and the optimistic claims of their 
leaders, they were unlikely to score an organizational victory 
at the party congress, and that it would therefore be unwise 
to risk sending a top CCP leader to India to dispute the au-
thority of Suslov. It is also possible that Peiping at this 
point in 1961 was still reluctant to abandon the conservative 
policy in the movement which it had apparently followed since 
the 1960 Moscow conference--of refraining from further overt 
attempts to displace CPSU influence in areas of continuing 
CPSU hegemony. 
Ghosh Pravda Article: The Sixth CPI Congress was schedul-
ed to begin on 7 April. On 5 April, the same day that Suslov 
and his entourage arrived in New Delhi, Pravda published a 
lengthy article by Ghosh keyed to the congress. In view of 
the many conflicting and distorted repoits which later became 
current concerning the congress and Suslov's role in it, this 
Pravda article--which Moscow broadcast widely to South Asia--
is of great importance in documenting the line which Ghosh and 
the CPSU both endorsed for the CPI before the congress battle 
began, and therefore in distinguishing which of the actions 
Suslov urged upon Ghosh during the congress were reflections 
of CPSU policy and which were tactical moves to preserve Ghosh's 
position and prevent a split in the party. 
*Moreover, the Indian government might not have felt free 
to refuse to xtend the visa of a top Chinese leader.

Ghosh's article repeats and expands the tributes paid in 
his draft political resolution to Nehru's contributions to 
peace and disarmament and his resistance to imperialist pres-
sures. At the same time, Ghosh adds--in accordance with the 
trend of Soviet policy since his February draft was adopted--
a lengthy, detailed, criticism of the "vacillations" of the 
Indian government, particularly in regard to the Congo, which 
was not found in his draft resolution. The changes in the 
resolution eventually made on this topic were therefore fore-
ordained before the congress, and owed nothing to the demands 
of the CPI leftists. Ghosh's conclusion was that the CPI 
must organize the masses to put pressure on the Indian govern-
ment to overcome these "weaknesses" and make New Delhi's policy 
more "consistent." 
On the internal economic situation, Ghosh's article placed 
only slightly more emphasis on the negative side of Indian gov-
ernment policy than had his draft resolution. His appraisal 
was still fairly balanced: he paid tribute to the first two 
five-year plans for broadening and strengthening the industrial 
basis of the Indian economy, noted that the third plan, "as 
before, places the stress on the development of heavy industry, 
mainly in the state sector," and concluded that Indian politi-
cal independence now rested on a firmer economic base than be-
fore. Ghosh also stated that "it would be, of course, incor-
rect" to think that the Indian government has submitted to the 
blackmail attempted by the imperialists to force a reduction 
of the plan and a weakening of the state sector in exchange 
for the granting of loans to India. Nevertheless, Ghosh com-
plained of instances of concessions made to foreign capital, 
of the growing ties between Indian and foreign bourgeoisie, 
of the government's failures to enact significant land reform, 
and of the dissolution of the Kerala government. He spoke of 
an "intensification of the contradiction between the govern-
ment of India and the people." But on the whole, Ghosh's 
Pravda appraisal of the economy did not lean as heavily on the 
negative side as he was to do in his speech to the congress 
or in the final version of the political resolution, suggest-
ing that here changes may have been forced by the need to off-
set CPI leftist pressure. 
On the other hand, Ghosh added an element which he was 
to repeat in his Congress speech, which the leftists were to 
object to strongly, and which had not been found in his draft

political resolution: an explicit statement that the continua-
tion of the Sino-Indian border dispute had hurt the CPI more 
than anything else and had been the chief factor pushing the 
Indian government in the direction desired by imperialists and 
reactionaries. 
Finally, Ghosh's Pravda article called for a "broad na-
tional association of all patriotic and democfatic forces"--
based on the alliance between the workers and peasants, the 
nucleus of the national-democratic front--to defend the state 
sector, achieve land reform, control the monopolies, prevent 
imperialist loans, criticize harmful tendencies in government, 
and so generally gain influence over government policies. 
Ghosh called vaguely for the overcoming Of differences among 
democratic forces resulting from their belonging to different 
political parties, but did not clearly indicate which social 
classes, parties, or elements of parties might belong to the 
national democratic front, and on what basis. 
To sum up: Ghosh and the CPSU had apparently agreed be-
fore the CPI Congress on a balanced line including both praise 
of Nehru's foreign policy and criticism of his vacillations; 
credit for aspects of the government's domestic policy and a 
certain number of detailed attacks on its faults; and emphasis 
on the harm being done to the Communist cause in India by the 
Sino-Indian dispute. They were also agreed on the need for 
a broad national-democratic front, but had not yet specified 
the makeup of that front beyond the generalized call for the 
inclusion of "all democratic forces." 
Chronology of the Congress: On 6 April, Suslov arrived 
at the site of the CPI Congress, the town of Vijayavada, in 
Andhra Pradesh province of southern India. Either that night 
or on the morning of the next day, Suslov is reported to have 
briefed a few top representatives of all the CPI factions--
Ghosh, Ranadive, Bhupesh Gupta, and Dange--and to have reit-
erated the Soviet request that there be no CPI discussio 
the Sino-Indian border dispute. 
Suslov is said to have later indicatea to CPI moderates that 
this was all the more necessary because the CCP was not repre-
sented at the congress; if any resolution on the subject were 
passed, the Chinese would assume that he had sponsored it as 
a new CPSU attack on them. In fact, no resolution was to be 
passed and there was to be no congress discussion of the issue 
permitted, although four resolutions prepared from different 
viewpoints were presented.

On 7 April, the outgoing National Council met to decide 
the agenda for the congress, and there was an immediate fac-
tional battle over whether the congress was to take up first 
the political resolution or the ,long-term party Program. The 
Ghosh-Dange forces, with their superior National Council're-
sourCes, won this skirmish, and the right to consider the 
party program first; it was supposedly felt that there was 
greater congress support for the Dange draft of the program 
than for Ghosh's political resolution, and that an initial 
victory might affect later voting. 
Early on the morning of 8 April, the congress began dis-
cussion of the two drafts of the_program. A serious attempt 
was made to keep all, the congress debates secret. Dange and 
others, speaking for the rightist draft, reportedly; set forth 
the goal of "national democracy" for India, urging that "pro-
gressive" elements of the Praja Socialist party and the Con-
gress party-,-especially the mass following, Of, the.,latterbe 
drawn into the broad National Democratic Front alliance by the 
CPI, and proposing that the alliance seek above-all to isolate 
the reactionary elements in the Congress party and in the 
right-wing parties. Ranadive and Bhupesh Gupta, who presented 
the leftist view, supported "people's democracy"--or a limited 
alliance led by the Communists--as the goal for the CPI's new 
program. They tended to discourage any dealings with the Con-
gress party; they wished to place little 'trust in the national 
bourgeoisie; and they sought to unite progressive forces clearly 
under the leadership of the working class, directing the mobi-
lization of the masses against the Congress party, 
The debate on the program went on for 11 hours, through 
the morning and afternoon congress sessions on 8 _April and 
the morning session of 9 April. At some point Namboodiripad 
is said to have offered a "golden mean" draft program the de-
tails of which are unknown, but which apparently attempted to 
reconcile the conflicts between the other two drafts. On the 
morning of 9 April, Ghosh gave a speech on the program in 
which he made a final effort to swing the congress toward the 
Dange draft, defending "National Democracy" as a correct slogan. 
It is not clear whether any vote was ever taken; the upshot, 
however, was that the congress could not agree. A party spokes-
man acknowledged this to newsmen after the morning session on 
the 9th, and attempted to gloss over the differences as con-
cerning only questions of emphasis. The spokesman asserted 
- 139 - 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
,sEercET 
that although both of the principal drafts had envisaged the 
formation of a united democratic front at a particular stage, 
opinion differed as to when the slogan of national democracy 
should be taken up. The eongress had therefore decided that 
the new National Council to be chosen at the end of the con-
gress sessions would work on a new draft program to be pre-
sented to the next party congress (which some reports indicated 
might be called after the Indian elections in 1962). Mean-
while, the spokesman announced, the CPI would continue to be 
guided by the Amritsar line. 
Suslov was instrumental in 
getting Ghosh to agree to shelve the question of the party 
program. Suslov is said to have argued that it was senseless 
for the CPI to further split itself over this issue when the 
old party program could be made to serve immediate needs. 
This was one of the first confirmations of the supposition 
that a primary purpose of the CPSU at the CPI Congress was to 
keep the CPI from formally splitting apart, and that as in 
1960, the CPSU was prepared to make some concessions to this 
end. 
In the meantime, Suslov had addressed the party congress 
on the afternoon of 8 April. He paid emphatic tribute to the 
importance of India to the outcome of the world struggle against 
imperialism and to the vital significance of the Indian policy 
of neutrality. He pointedly warned the CPI of the need for 
discipline and unity in its ranks. He spoke of the Indian 
party at one point as struggling "against imperialism and feudal 
oppression, for national independence, and for democracy and 
social progress," and at another point as working "with other 
national patriotic forces...to liquidate economic backwardness 
and to establish a stable and independent economy, to strengthen 
the political independence and sovereignty of their country, 
and to promote social progress." Suslov also referred to the 
"specific complicated conditions" in which the CPI had to work; 
alluded to the CPI's task as one of "determined struggle against 
imperialism and the remnants of feudalism" (not, it will be 
noted, against the ruling bourgeoisie); and called on the In-
dian party "to unite into a single national democratic front 
all the patriotic forces interested in India's advancement along

firkeltrf 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
Approved for Release: 2022/12/16 C00600337 
the path of economic and social progress."* In short, Suslov 
endorsed a national democratic program for the CPI--and a very 
minimal one at that--and breathed not a word about socialism 
being a goal toward which the CPI should strive. The same was 
true of the CPSU message to the Indian party congress read by 
Suslov; in contrast, the CCP message read out at the same ses-
sion, while generally restrained in tone, did put-in a word 
for socialism in India. As in the case of Ghosh's Pravda 
article, the conclusion seems inescapable that the CPSU, while 
not committing itself on the subject of alliances with the 
Congress party or Congress party units, was far more in sympathy 
with the general thrust of the Ghosh-Dange line than with that 
of the leftists. 
Nevertheless, it has been widely reported--and there is 
good reason to believe--that'; it was Suslov who counseled 
Ghosh to insert in his General Secretary's Report to the con-
gress (delivered on the afternoon of ,9 April) material tend-
ing considerably more to the left on certain issues than did 
the National Council's Political Resolution. which Gh9sh had 
prepared back in February. Suslov 
may have given such advice at a meeting of top CPI leaders on 
the evening of 8 April, when he is said to have criticized 
both the National Council draft and Ranadive's alternative, 
while supporting Namboodiripad's middle-of-the-road proposal 
for a Political Resolution. 
This CPSU action was subsequently subjected to wide mis-
interpretation by both extreme left and right factions, being 
variously termed an attempt to placate the leftist leaders and 
a betrayal of the rightists. In fact, Suslov's advice to 
Ghosh appears to have been conditioned by four factors. The 
first and most important of these was the need to preserve the 
loyal CPSU adherent Ghosh in authority as General �etretary 
at all costs, in the face of trends within the party congress 
which threatened seriously to displace him. 
*The provisions summarized in this sentence were omitted 
from the TASS text of Suslov's speech, perhaps because they 
revealed too explicitly that the CPSU was attempting to set 
a line for the CPI. They appeared in the New Age version 
of the speech.

Second was the need to neutralize enough of the follow-
ing of the left-faction leaders at the congress--while rebuff-
ing those leaders themselves--to head off any inclination by 
the leftists to try to take the provincial organizations they 
controlled out of the CPI. (The CPSU had for some time feared 
as a serious possibility such an organizational split in the 
Indian party, and, as has been seen, went to considerable  
lengths in early and mid-1960 to prevent it.  
  From Moscow's point 
of view, an open schism in the Indian party--unlike the many 
mass explusions of dissenters which have occurred in European 
parties--could prove disastrous to Soviet hegemony, because 
of Peiping's availability to inspire and guide a rival Indian 
Communist party.) 
The Soviets were therefore prepared to underwrite an at-
tempt by Ghosh to steal the leftist leaders' thunder by warn-
ing against expectations of an automatic and smooth parliamen-
tary transition to power, provided that the essentials of the 
current Soviet line--the very broad alliance seeking limited 
democratic goals through peaceful means--were maintained. This 
implied a retreat from the exposed position taken by the 1958 
Amritsar congress to the more reserved but still fairly opti-
mistic view of peaceful transition ID socialism taken by the 
Palghat Congress of 1956. This method of undercutting the 
arguments of the CPI leftist faction was somewhat analogous 
to the way in which the CPSU in 1960 had sought to undercut 
the Chinese appeal to the world Communist movement by adopt-
ing a more militant line on colonial revolutions; but it will 
be seen that Ghosh's retreat was not intended to support the 
CPI left wing any more than the CPSU retreat from the extteme 
version of the peaceful coexistence line was intended to sup-
port Peiping. 
Thirdly, while the CPSU, unlike Ranadive, desired that 
a balance be kept bettveen support and criticism of Indian gov-
ernment domestic policies, it was probably felt that the bal-
ance contain 3d in the National Council draft Political Resolu-
tion was too heavily weighted toward the positive side to 
serve CPI short-term interests in the coming election campaign.

Finally, while the CPSU wished general support for Nehru's 
neutral foreign policy to be retained, it was necessary that 
Ghosh's speech 7-ow also reflect the specific criticism of New 
Delhi's Congo policy which had become apposite since the draft 
Political Resolution was prepared in February (as Ghosh had 
already, in fact, done in his 5 April Pravda article). 
These considerations were all reflected in the speech 
Ghosh delivered to the CPI-Congress on the afternoonof 9 
April, and in the description of that' speech Published in, 
,Pravda three days later. Ghosh's speeCh was' his second of the 
congress; it was a report given in his capacity as general 
secretary, opening the debate on, the political resolution and 
introducing the National Council-draft. In this report Ghosh, 
,while praising Nehres foreign policy in general terms, was, 
like the 5 April Pravda article, somewhat more specific than 
his draft political resolution had been on New Delhi's defi.,!: 
ciencies regarding colonialism. At the same'time he placed 
somewhat more stress on the degree to which the Indian govern-
ment had yielded to the attacks of domestic reactionaries and 
had shifted to the right, and spoke more of the "anti-people 
measures" of the government. He devoted less attention than 
had his draft political resolution to an explanation of how 
democratic tasks are in the "objective interest" of the nation-
al bourgeoisie, and in fact spoke less of the national' bour-
geoisie generally, instead concentrating on the danger of the 
"monopolistic bourgeoisie," who were no longer portrayed as 
the insignificant handful the draft political resolution had 
described. 
Ghosh now criticized the line of the Amritsar congress, 
and favored instead the qualified endorsement of peaceful tran-
sition made by the Palghat Congress of 1956. The Amritsar 
resolution was described as both reformist (because it implied 
a belief that the parliamentary slide into power would be both 
automatic and smooth) and sectarian (because it did not appeal 
for a broad enough united front for strictly limited, non-so-
cialist goals). Ghosh warned against interpreting-the peace-
ful path to socialism as mere reliance upon parliament alone; 
this he termed a reformist deception which had been exposed 
by the Kerala events. Ghosh predicted that the conditions of 
life for the masses would remain bad under the third five-year 
plan, and that class contradictions would sharpen. He cautioned 
that anti-democratic tendencies might increase within the ruling

class, that violations of parliamentary methods and traditions 
by the bourgeoisie--such as the means used to expel the CPI 
in Kerala--might increase; even a reactionary personal dicta-
torship, he said, might be a possibility after Nehru's death. 
All this, however, was at least offset by an emphatic 
restatement of many central elements of the right-wing line. 
Ghosh upheld his political resolution's contention that con-
ditions were nevertheless still favorable for the formation 
of a very broad national democratic front, whose chief goal 
would be not the replacement of the government but the enact-
ment of a series of democratic reforms. While making it plain 
that the CPI would have to fight the next election on the basis 
of its own program, with the government necessarily made the 
clear target of electoral attack--and that therefore any gen-
eral electoral alliance with the Congress party was impossible--
Ghosh also made it plain that this did not mean abandonment 
of the long-term effort to draw both the following and the 
"progressive" section of the leadership of the Congress party 
into the national democratic front.* As in his draft resolu-
tion, all Ghosh's allusions to Nehru except those concerning 
the Kerala events were most favorable; blame was almost invari-
ably placed upon "the government," not upon Nehru. Ghosh also 
declared that it would be a "big mistake" to equate the Con-
gress with the rightist Indian parties. Citing the Palghat 
line on the need to take into account the Congress' hold on 
the Indian masses, Ghosh reiterated the assertions made in his 
draft political resolution that a process of "rethinking" is 
going on among many Congress supporters and that an attempt 
must be made to appeal to the Congress masses and to progres-
sive Congress leaders. His draft resolution had called on the 
CPI to undertake joint action with local Congress Party com-
mittees in peasant areas; Ghosh now similarly spoke of the 
need to take into account the loyalty of Congress followers 
to their organizations and to Nehru, as well as the need to 
*While Ghosh in this speech merely implied strongly several 
times that the national democratic front must include suitable 
elements of the national bourgeoisie, Pravda's 12 April report 
on his speech, in summarizing this portion of his remarks, took 
the liberty of saying so explicitly: another indication of 
the CPSU's position.

make direct appeals "not only to the Congress masses but also 
to Congress committees, taking into account the issue concern-
ed." In short, despite his ruling out of any general alliance 
with the Congress Party during the election campaign, Ghosh 
insisted that "united front from above" as well as "united 
front from below" tactics must be used toward the Congress 
in the long-term effort of building the national democratic 
front. This was anathema to the West Bengal left-faction 
leaders. 
Worst still, from the point of view of the Ranadive fac-
tion, Ghosh went beyond the scope of his draft resolution to 
add a direct polemical attack on the "deep-rooted sectarian-
ism" of CPI leaders who found themselves unable to mobilize 
the masses to combat the negative features of Indian govern-
ment foreign policy because they were not willing or "inspired" 
to mobilize movements in support of favorable aspects of New 
Delhi's policy. It is again characteristic of the CPSU's at-
titude that this passage was included in its entirely in Pravda's 
highly selective account of Ghosh's speech. Also included 
in the Pravda summary was a pointed attack made by Ghosh on 
the contention of the old 1951 program of the CPI that the 
Nehru government was pro-imperialist.* Ghosh also attacked the 
Ranadive alternative draft political resolution as reverting 
to the pre-Palghat line of mere hostility to the government, 
of mere�Trexposure of the government and the Congress and gen-
eral propaganda about people's democracy" without any real 
attempt to reach Congress supporters. Ranadive's attitude, 
Ghosh said, was based on the "politically passive" expectation 
"that some day or other the masses, drawn by misery, would 
come over to us;" and Ranadive's draft was "permeated with a 
sense of conspiracy." In attacking the CPI leftists in these 
terms, Ghosh was surely aware that he was repeating the langu-
age used in the assault on "contemporary left-wing adventur-
ists" in the Communist movement made by Shevlyagin in a June 
1960 Pravda article--in other words, that he was identifying 
Ranadive as a pupil of the Chinese. 
Finally, Ghosh repeated the statements made in his 5 
April Pravda article about the "heavy blow" dealt "to the 
democratic forces and to the CPI" by the Sino-Indian border 
dispute, and implied that the failure to settle this conflict 
has helped reactionary forces in their efforts to alter Indian 
foreign policy. The reiteration of this point originally made 
*This point was again emphasized in a short review of the 
CPI Congress in a fall issue of the Soviet journal Peoples of 
Asia and Africa.

in Pravda suggests that it had Soviet approval; and it is known 
that the CPSU had utilized this charge about the baneful ef-
fect on the CPI of the Sino-Indian dispute in several of the 
secret confrontations with the CCP during 1960. It is possible 
that while the Soviets wanted the Indian party to avoid public 
denunciations of Peiping if at all possible, nevertheless Mos-
cow also wanted the CPI to realize clearly the fact that the 
dispute was hurting the party, and to suggest again to Indian 
cadres that the CCP bore part of the responsibility for this. 
A furious concurrent debate on Ghosh's report and on the 
political resolution next ensued at the CPI Congress on the 
morning of 10 April, and went on for five full days. On 10 
April, Ranadive on the left and Namboodiripad in the center 
introduced their alternative drafts; but both of them now found 
that they had been outflanked by Ghosh. Many elements of 
Namboodiripad's balanced plan for both CPI support and criticism 
of the government had already been accepted by Ghosh (a fact 
which the secretary general had acknowledged in his speech); 
while Ghosh's leftist points calling for a strongly anti-gov-
ernment election campaign had stolen many of Ranadive's argu-
ments. The left-faction leaders, who were more anxious to 
seize organizational control of the CPI than to secure modifi-
cations of wording in the political resolution, were reported 
to have commented at this time that Ghosh had "beat us with 
our own stick." 
The right wing of the party under Dange, however, felt 
betrayed by Ghosh's retreat, and made an unsuccessful attempt 
to head it off. Following the introduction of the Namboodiri-
pad and Ranadive drafts, Dange convened a factional meeting 
of.the CPI right wing, with delegates from many provinces pre-
sent. At this meeting Dange is reported to have been pressed 
by extremists on the right to attempt to force a congress deci-
sion on their terms. Dange is said to have replied that he 
was unsure of his following's strength, and suggested that it 
be tested by submitting a motion to the congress approving the 
National Council political resolution unmodified by anything 
in Ghosh's speech. According to the report, this was done, 
and the motion was defeated by a vote of 205-197. Dange is 
subsequently said to have told his followers that they were 
unable to carry the party with them now, must accept modifi-
cations in the resolution:, and should rely on the resolution's 
retention of the "national democracy" slogan to protect the 
essence of their views.

On the morning of 11 April, Ghosh is reported to have 
explained to the delegates that he, Ranadive, and Namboodiri-
pad were negotiating over the political resolution, and that 
debate was to continue in the meantime. On the afternoon and 
,evening of 11 April, as previously arranged in the agenda, the 
congress .was adjourned for private dickering; on 12 April de-
bate was resumed; and on the morning of 13 April the congress 
Noted on numerous amendments to Ghosh's report, which was to 
be disposed of before the political resolution. Certain amend-
ments to the speech from both sides were adopted: from the 
left, provisions stating that unity with�the.national bourgeoisie 
was to be .predicated on the extent to which it tought imperi-
alism and feudalism, calling on the CPI to explain to the peo-
_ 
ple the falseness of the Congress party's use of socialist 
slogans, and calling on:-.the party, while developing common . 
activity with Congressmen, to explain to the Congress party 
masses the inadquacy of that party's policy; and fromt.the 
right, an emphatic explanation of the need for cooperation and 
alliances with patriotic organizations and "leading Congress-
men." With these contradictory elements added, Ghosh's -General 
Secretary's Report was formally acCepted by the party congress 
on the morning of 13 April, and was later duly published in, 
this form in New Age. 
On the afternoon of the same day, discussion of the poli-
tical resolution resumed. The leftist and centrist draft 
resolutions were now withdrawn, and the delegates agreed to 
seek adoption of the Ghosh National Council resolution with 
amendments. The battle now again revolved around which amend-
ments were to be accepted; more than two hundred were report-
ed offered, and the voting was said to be close and bitter, 
with the delegates shouting and heckling one another. On 14 
April, the party congress finally voted to accept the Ghosh 
resolution plus three amendments of some consequence leaning 
on the whole toward the left-faction side: these were said 
to relate to the pernicious role of Western capital in India; 
the need for the party to lead mass struggles; and the cir-
cumstances under which cooperation with leftist elements among 
Congress party leaders would be feasible. The resolution was 
also amended to include the final section of Ghosh's report 
dealing with the party's tactical line during the coming elec-
tion campaign: as has already .been noted, this was the most 
markedly anti-government aspect of Ghosh's speech. Ghosh was 
authorized by the congress to tidy up the resolution along

these lines and release it later. As eventually published in 
the 7 May New Age, the resolution in its final form clearly 
showed the influence of the leftist amendments, which gave to 
it a more consistently militant and anti-Congress tone over-
all than that of Ghosh's speech, let alone that of the original 
National Council draft. This was the greatest achievement 
the left-faction leaders were to register at the party congress, 
and was a good indication of their strength among the delegates. 
However, because the leftists were unable to follow this up 
by seizing organizational control of the party, and because 
neither the CPSU nor Ghosh was behind them, the incorporation 
of many leftist views into the resolution did not mean enforce-
ment of those views upon the party as a whole, because pro-
vincial party organizations could and did find in the resolu-
tion some language to justify the moderate or extremist course 
the particular faction in control of each province intended 
to continue to follow. 
Later on 14 April, Suslov is reported to have had another 
conversation with CPI leaders. Although much of what he said 
on this occasion is available only through the distorting prism 
of left-faction propaganda,* the CPSU official appears to have 
reiterated previous Soviet emphasis on the need for the CPI 
to maintain both support for Nehru's progressive foreign poli-
cies and criticism of his policy shortcomings in an effort to 
bring pressure on the Indian bourgeoisie to arrest India's 
slide toward the West and pull it tOward the bloc. Suslov also 
seems to have repeated his advice to CPI leaders not to volun-
teer any public attacks on the CPR, subject again to the im-
portant qualification that the CPI as a mass party was bound 
to encounter questions on this issue and had a responsibility 
to answer them. 
*Basavapunniah, for example, continuing his efforts to con-
vince the CPI that the CPSU had given authority over the Indian 
party to Peiping, claimed privately that Suslov had strongly 
urged the CPI to "follow" the Chinese example of economic de-
velopment and had emphasized that the Chinese method of "solv-
ing the agricultural crisis" was applicable to India. This 
claim was remarkable in view of the current Chinese economic 
situation and the many Soviet public and private allusions in 
1961 to the mess the Chinese party had created.

On the morning of the 15th, Namboodiripad presented his 
organizational report on the party, together with his proposed 
draft of A new party constitution. Both- were apparently 
briefly discussed by the congress and then shelve(1, like the 
party program, as too controversial for the 'party to consider 
in its present divided state. Namboodiripad's report was a-
long and scathing documentation of the process by which-the: 
Indian Communist Party since the early- 1950s had lost every 
semblance of internal discipline or coherent Centralized 
direction, touching inter alia on such factors in this pro-
cess as the 1947-1951 factional battles for the leadership, 
the tremendous effects of deStalinization on the CPI, and the 
steady growth of parliamentary illusions throughout the party. 
Although there may be some truth to subsequent CPI leftist 
claims that Suslov read and approved aspects of this report 
it is very doubtful that any CPSU representative could have 
approved of the way Namboodiripad tried to resolve the dual 
question of discipline Within and among Communist parties. 
After deploring the erosion of faith within the CPI in both 
democratic centralism and the solidarity of the international 
:movement, Namboodiripad hailed the 1960 Moscow Statement as 
"pointing out the way in which the ideological-political is-
sues of the international movement, are to be further discussed 
and decided." He declared: 
While every national party will discuss and decide 
questions of national importance as a centralized 
party in which it is obligatory for the minority - 
to submit itself to the majority and for the lower, 
units to submit themselves to the higher units,_ 
the international relations of the world Communist 
movement are so arranged that "the Communist and 
Workers parties hold meetings whenever necessary 
to discuss urgent problems'cand otherwise maintain 
the unity of the international movement. This would 
give us a clear perspective of the way in which the 
world Communist movement is grOwing and is arrang-
ing its affairs. This new conception of the unity of 
the world movement.. .should help us a good deal in 
overcoming the consequences of the shocks felt by 
us after the Twentieth TCPSU7 Congress. 
_ 
The context of this passage suggested that Namboodiripad 
was implying that he welcomed the 1960 Moscow Statement as 
representing Soviet public acknowledgement that it was loosening

the reins on the world movement, and that only such a relinquish-
ment of CPSU authority could satisfy the demands of CPI mem-
bers and restore their willingness to accept internal discipline 
in View of the misuse to which the CPSU had put party discipline 
in Stalin's time. But if Namboodiripad thought the CPSU was 
in fact willing to accept as final the defeat it had suffered 
on this issue in 1960 at the hands of the Chinese party, he 
was naive; and this may have had something to do with the fact 
that his report was shelved. 
It was also on 15 April that four separate draft resolu-
tions were presented to the congress on the border question, 
expressing, with varying degrees of warmth, regret at the 
position taken by Peiping. In accordance with Suslov's ad-
vice, none of these resolutions was adopted or even allowed 
to be discussed by the congress. 
The final major battle of the CPI congress, over the 
election of a new National Council, began on the evening of 
15 April and went on through an all-night session until the 
morning of 16 April, accompanied by booing, heckling, and dele-
gate walkouts. The issue was joined when the old National 
Council on 15 April was unable to agree on the customary 
Communist single list of candidates for the new party organ, 
because the leftist leaders insisted on complete autonomy for 
the provincial committees in choosing their own slates of 
representatives. This was a move designed to allow the left-
ists in control of such provincial organizations as those of 
West Bengal and the Punjab to purge the few rightist leaders 
from their provinces previously placed on the National Council. 
The struggle was transferred to the congress plenum, and the 
leftists attempted to carry out their purge; but the rightist 
faction retaliated by proposing changes from the floor. The 
leftists from West Bengal, the Punjab, and Tamilnad then with-
drew their slates and walked out of the congress, leaving a 
rump of the new National Council elected. Although Dange re-
portedly wished to allow this rump_ to go ahead and function--
which would have formalized an open schism in the CPI--Ghosh 
worked frantically through the night (with, presumably, Suslov's 
help) to try to find an acceptable compromise. In the end,

it was agreed to amend the CPI Constitution to enlarge the 
limit fixed for the National Council sufficiently to accom-
modate the leftist slates plus the persons the leftists had 
ousted.* Thereupon,- the leftist Ramamurft announced on 16 
April that all those who had withdrawn from the new National 
Council were now back; the Italian party observer Pajetta Was 
said to have commented privately on the strong factional 
discipline this revealed. 
The upshot of this struggle--in which the open split the 
CPSU feared had almost materialized--was that the rightists 
retained a reduced majority on the Natibnal Council; of the 
110 members of the new body, 56 were estimated to be rightists, 
36 to be leftists,- with 18 neutrals. It will be seen, however, 
that the tactics the leftists had used to achieve this limited 
improvement of their.position were to cost them dearly when 
the time came for the rightist-led National Council to elect 
a new Central Executive Committee and Central Secretariat. 
Later on r6 April, Ghosh was duly re-elected general sec-
retary of the party, and the congress closed. Neither wing 
of the party had obtained everything it wanted, but many of 
the leftist leaders could and did congratulate themselves on 
the greatly increased strength they had shown at the congress, 
and claimed they had made at least a start toward seizing con-
trol of the party. Extremists on both sides tended to be bit-
ter and to. offer contradictory estimates of what had happened. 
At an alcoholic luncheon with cronies later in the month, Dange 
took an exaggeratedly pessimistic line, complaining that Rana-
dive now had the strongest organization in the CPI and blam-
ing Suslov for the concessions to the leftists Ghosh:hdd-made. 
The Andhra extreme leftist Sundarayya, on the other hand, told 
friends a week after the congress that he regretted that the 
congress could not give a clear lead to the people, and was 
caustic about the proposed formation of a national democratic 
front including "so-called" progressives of the Congress party. 
*Actually, one or two of the nine extra persons thus re-
stored to the National Council were leftists from Maharashtra 
whom the rightist faction h.ad also sought to purge.

Sundarayya thought that some comrades had betrayed the party, 
lured by the prospect of temporary gains; that the parliamentary 
path had been tiled and had failed, and should have been 
abandoned; that the party was losing its spirit of sacrifice 
and revolutionary character, and therefore the rightist resolu-
tion had been accepted by the congress;* that the leftists had 
tried to reorient and revolutionize the party, but had failed, 
because "a powerful section" of the party wished to support 
Nehru's government. If the party supported Nehru, he said, 
it might as well not exist as a separate party, and should 
join the Congress organization (an echo of the Chinese guidance 
to the leftistsrrovided in December 1960). Sundarayya asked 
how the CPI could cooperate with a robber, even though a small 
fraction of his spoils went to the underprivileged; he could 
not understand how there could be a "good" robber (echoing the 
Red Flag articles of April 1960). Support for Nehru and for 
the parliamentary system was estranging the CPI from the masses, 
he felt; "when leaders like me shed blood," he added, "only 
then can the party grow." 
In the sense, therefore, that the'Sixth CPI Congress did 
not encourage Sundarayya to shed his blood and did indicate 
continued (if conditional) reliance upon parliamentary tactics, 
the outcome favored the rightists. On the other hand, in line 
with the party's retreat from the Amritsar expression of faith 
in a parliamentary transition to socialism to the Palghat as-
sertion that the feasibility of a parliamentary transition would 
depend on the future attitude shown by the bourgeoisie, steps 
seem_ to have been taken at the congress to expedite decisions 
previously taken to build up the party's underground organiza-
tion. Dange claimed that the CPI had decided to establish a 
network of underground "combat cells" all over India during 
the next two years, to be used in case of need; and Jaipal 
Singh, the head of the CPI secret organization in the defense 
services, told a recruit after the congress that his organiza-
tion was in full swing again after having been deactivated in 
May 1960 because of party factionalism and government attention 
to his activities. Nothing more has been heard since the congress

about the possibility of Chinese help to and guidance for these 
CPI underground activities; there had been indications earlier 
in the year that Peiping had responded to the leftist plea for 
such help by predicating it upon leftist seizure of organiza-
tional control of the CPI at the party congress, and the fail-
ure of the leftists to do this, together with the apparent 
CPSU moves to preempt supervision of this field, may have in-
duced Peiping to back off. 
D. The CPI Between Its Congress and the 22nd CPSU Congress 
June National Council Meeting: Two months after the Sixth 
Congress, the new National Council met at Bangalore, with its 
most important task the election of the Central Executive Com-
mittee and the Central Secretariat, the executive bodies that 
would be charged with immediate supervision of the party un-
til the next party congress. Both of the old organs had pre-
viously turned out to have leftist majorities, despite the 
large rightist majority on the old National Council which had 
elected them: a fact suggesting that the polarization of the 
party which was brought to everyone's awareness under the im-
pact of the Sino-Soviet dispute in 1959 and 1960 had not gone 
nearly so far in 1958 when the party organs were last chosen. 
Now, this discrepancy was intolerable to the rightists; and 
the new National Council, with a much smaller rightist majority 
than before, replaced the old Central Executive Committee 
dominated 14 to 9 by the leftists with a new body in which the 
moderates had a 13 to 12 edge. An even greater .change occurred 
in the Central Secretariat, which is responsible for the day-
to-day operation of the party, and which the leftists had been 
able to use to their own advantage on several occasions in 
Ghosh's absence. This body was cut down to five members, of 
whom the first four--Ghosh, Dange, M.N. Govindan Nair,* and 
Z.A. Ahmad--were moderates, while Bhupesh Gupta was the sole 
leftist remaining. Although some reports have suggested that 
*After going through several stages in his political evolu-
tion (like a number of other CPI leaders), Nair had now adopt-
ed a moderate position.

....ar6GRET 
this one-sided result came about partly because certain left-
ists, including Ranadive, withdrew their names rather than 
participate in a larger rightist-dominated Secretariat, the 
direction of the change was not caused by these leftist maneuv-
erings. The most important effect of the Secretariat reshuffle 
was to ensure that until the next party congress the central 
direction of the Indian Communist Party would remain in hands 
at least more likely than before to be loyal to the CPSU un-
der all circumstances. For this reason, it seems reasonable 
to believe--although there is no direct evidence--that the 
basic trend of these changes, if not the details, was endorsed 
by the CPSU in advance. 
Provincial Factional Struggles: The CPI was supposed to 
have united to concentrate its energy in preparations for the 
electoral campaign. However, factional infighting--slightly 
subdued--vent on as before, particularly in the provincial 
party organizations. The right wing scored a temporary vic-
tory in a marginal province in June, when the Andhra Pradesh 
party narrowly elected a rightist as the new party secretary 
against a leftist opponent supported by Sundarayya. In July, 
the northern Uttar Pradesh organization controlled by right-
ist Central Secretariat member Ahmad again defeated the local 
left-wing opposition. In May and June Ranadive and Dange 
both were reported making strenuous efforts to strength the 
positions of their minority adherents in the respective op-
position strongholds of Maharashtra and West Bengal; in neither 
case did these efforts bear immediate fruit. 
While most CPI leaders during this period were guided by 
the Soviet advice to remain circumspect in their public state-
ments on the border issue, this was not so of everyone: Ahmad 
in July indicated that the party would take a clearly nation-
alist stand on the question of Chinese incursion into India, 
a position for which he was severely berated in the West Bengal 
organization, and from which he subsequently retreated. 
Ramamurthi, the leftist from Tamilnad, on the other hand was 
quoted in June by a provincial bourgeois newspaper as having 
declared in a private interview that India, not China, had 
committed aggression on the border. The leftist attitude on 
this score was made clear by Ranadive in May when he told a 
closed party meeting that the attitude Nehru showed toward 
China on the border dispute should be an important criterion 
for the appraisal of his foreign policy.

Both Dange and the leftist leaders acknowledged in the 
months after the Sixth Congress that the line the CPI was now 
following was an ambiguous one designed solely for the interim 
period of the election campaign, and that a more consistent 
line (by which they meant one following their own views) would 
have to be sought after the elections. In the meantime, as 
expected, the provincial organizations and central factions 
were interpreting the tactical line for the elections to suit 
themselves. In some cases this meant completely ignoring 
everything that had happened at the party congress. A central 
party official was to complain in the fall that certain pro-
vincial committees had not even troubled to get the Political 
Resolution translated into their respective languages, so that 
party members were not told of what was supposed to be the of-
ficial line of the party. This official noted the "depressing" 
fact that "some leading cadres have not even cared to read the 
resolution," and that no provincial committee had bothered to 
inform the party center what if anything it was doing to ex-
plain it to local party members. (At the June meeting of the 
National Council, Namboodiripad had lamented the "sorry state 
of affairs /Tihereby7 the Central Office of the party...is not 
in a position even to collect information on the organizational 
position of the party in various states and regions.") ' 
Even when the provincial organizations took cognizance 
of the line the congress had adopted, they reacted in opposite 
directions. On the one hand, during the spring and summer 
right-wing party units in Delhi and Andhra were negotiating 
to support Congress candidates, Namboodiripad was pledging 
CPI support for a Congress or Praja Socialist candidate for 
the Kerala Assembly speakership,and Ghosh and Namboodiripad 
were seeking to pull the CPI out of its political isolation 
by issuing public appeals to the Congress and Praja Socialist 
parties to form a united front with the CPI to fight communal-
ism in India. On the other hand, West Bengal party meetings 
heard attacks on the rightist activities of the central party 
leadership, and criticism of Bhupesh Gupta for agreeing to 
serve as the sole leftist on the rightist Central Secretariat. 
In August, followers of Konar prepared a draft resolution for 
the West Bengal party attacking the political resolution adopted 
at the CPI Congress, complaining that even Ranadive's proposals 
had not gone far enough to the left, and denouncing the party 
leadership for failing to see that the National Democratic 
Front line was unsuitable for India. Konar himself at a

Provincial Executive Committee meeting declared that this line 
was unrealistic, and attacked the central leaders for wishful 
thinking on the question of cooperating with progressive Con-
gress party elements, declaring that Ghosh and the others in 
New Delhi appeared to want to avoid serious battles on the 
economic as well as the political front. He asked the West 
Bengal organization to scotch any illusions about the growth 
of a "bourgeois" democratic front in their province, and stated 
that the West Bengal party was fighting for a leftist alliance 
in West Bengal rather than for a bourgeois democratic alliance. 
What this meant in practice was that the leftist West Ben-
gal leadership not only emphatically rejected attempts by 
the local right-wing minority to have the provincial party 
support occasional progressive Congress Party candidates, but 
also refused to allow the important but vehemently anti-Chinese 
Praja Socialist party into the alliance they were constructing 
for the elections, declaring that they would "not surrender 
to attempts to smuggle Congressite political thought into the 
leftist alliance." Instead, the West Bengal party allied it-
self only with a group of tiny splinter parties on the extreme 
left which it could expect to dominate without the need for 
compromise. Moreover, because Konar and the other extremist 
leaders held out the unrealistic hope to party cadres that they 
could unaided win control of the West Bengal Legislature and 
form a purely Communist provincial government, the party was 
niggardly in alloting legislative candidatures to its allies 
in the leftist alliance, to the point of endangering that al-
liance. Finally, the left-faction leadership of the West Ben-
gal party is reported to have attempted to continue its purge 
of rightist opposition within the provincial party by denying 
party nominations for seats in the legislature to leading 
_ rightists. 
Ghosh and Basu Visits to Moscow: Meanwhile, on 11 July 
Ghosh let for one of his periodic visits to Moscow, to con-
sult with CPSU leaders on a variety of subjects. In addition 
to holding discussions on the international situation and on 
CPI internal dissension and policies. Ghosh is said, 
to have taken 
part in meetings of an international committee considering 
fresh CPSU-CCP grievances. While this is completely unconfirmed, 
it is quite possible that the CPSU gave Ghosh some briefing 
on the current state of Sino-Soviet relations. There is no

evidence, however, that Ghosh was told of a Soviet intention 
to attack the Albanian leaders--and thus indirectly the CCP--
at the 22nd CPSU Congress in October. 
A few weeks after Ghosh's departure for the Soviet Union, 
he was followed there by Jyoti Basu,- the West Bengal leader. 
who had stepped down as provincial party secretary in January. 
Reports indicate that during the two or three weeks that Basu 
remained in Moscow, the Soviet leadership made some effort to 
influence his views both on the issue of the "national demo-
cratic front" and on the question of the relations of the West 
Bengal party to the CCP. While there was some indication both 
before and after Basu's journey that his views had become a 
trifle less extreme than those of Konar or Promode Das Gupta 
(the new provincial party secretary), there was not subsequent 
evidence that the CPSU had succeeded in driving a serious 
wedge into the pro-Chinese left-faction phalanx in West Bengal 
which Konar and Gupta now controlled. 
September National Council Meeting and Election Manifesto: 
In early September Ghosh returned to India, bearing with him 
instructions reportedly given him by CPSU Presidium member 
Kuusinen to see that the CPI in its forthcoming Election Mani-
festo made some gesture in support of the Indian nationalist 
position on the border issue and in condemnation of the-Chi-
nese position. While it is undoubtedly true that the CPSU 
gave such advice primarily because it wished the CPI to make 
the most effective possible appeal to nationalist sentiment 
in the elections, the fact that this consideration had so much 
greater weight With Kuusinen in September than with Suslov in 
April strongly suggests that Moscow was at least partly in-
fluenced by the fact that it was about to launch a major of-
fensive against the CCP and its adherents at the CPSU party 
congress the following month. This is also suggested by the 
extreme nature of the plank that Ghosh is reported to have at-
tempted to get the CPI to adopt. During a Central Executive 
Committee meeting held from 11 to 17 September at which a 
draft Election Manifesto was prepared, a plank on the border 
issue was drawn up, reportedly by Ghosh personally, which was 
said to have condemned China as an aggressor, to have strongly 
supported the Indian position on the border, and to have speti-
fically commended the Indian government study team for its re-
port which "proved" the correctness of the Indian stand.

However, when during the following week Ghosh attempted 
to get the National Council to approve this plank, it was 
found that the expected rightist margin in the Council had 
disappeared, presumably partly because less than half the 
Council members were actually present, and partly because 
some who were willing to support moderate measures on domes-
tic CPI policy were not willing to back an open condemnation 
of the Chinese. Three amendments to the plank were offered, 
one strengthening it, one leaving it essentially unchanged, 
and a third, from Ranadive, denying all support to the Indian 
position. During acrimonious debate Ranadive charged. that 
Ghosh was reneging on an understanding reached at the CPI 
Congress not to discuss this issue, Sundarayya and Basavapun-
niah thkeatened to leave the meeting, and Sundarttyya and 
Konar each warned that their respective organizations in 
Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal woulct not be bound by the plank 
if adopted. When the Ghosh CEC plank was submitted to a 
vote, it was defeated, 25-22. The issue was finally put off 
by instructing Ghosh to amend the draft in the light of the 
National Council discussion; and as a result of negotiations 
between the factions Bhupesh Gupta finally prepared the com-
promise version that was finally included in the Manifesto 
released to the press on 12 October. Despite press reports 
to the contrary, this version was not any advance on previous 
CPI positions-. Exactly like the February 1961 National Coun-
cil resolution, it affirmed the MacMahon line in the east 
and an unspecified "traditional frontier" in the west, sup-
ported India's title to all of Kashmir (and therefore implicitly 
her exclusive right to negotiate with the CPR for Ladakh), 
and called for a political settlement. Even this much, how-
ever, did not please the leftists, who had wished the CPI to 
continue to maintain the party's congress' policy of silence 
on this issue. The CCP was duly informed by the leftists of 
the details of the struggle over Ghosh's plank, as well as of 
the fact that Kuusinen had encouraged Ghosh to.write that 
plank. 
Otherwise, the National Council meeting was chiefly not-
able for its rejection of the leftist attitude on electoral 
alliances. In areas where no Communist candidate was to be 
offered, the Council reportedly approved both the conclusion 
of alliances with the Praja Socialist Party for the defeat of 
reactionary Congress candidates, and support for "acceptable, 
progressive" Congress candidates to defeat the nominees of

_agent 
extreme right-wing parties. Both of these tactical measures 
had been and continued to be rejected by the West Bengal 
party organization. 
E. The 22nd CPSU Congress and Its Aftermath  
Suslov at the CPI Congress in April had reportedly again 
requested that the CPI send a "balanced" delegation of left-
ists and rightists to the CPSU Congress in October. This re-
quest was fulfilled; in addition to himself, Ahmad,� and the 
MaharaAhtrazi:ler Sardesai--three moderates--the delegation 
included Promode Das Gupta, the West Bengal leader, and from 
one to three lower-level figures associated with the leftist 
faction.* The CPI delegation witnessed the :tumultuous events 
of the congress, and heard Ghosh address the congress on 21 
October. During or shortly after the congress Ghosh appears 
to have had private discussions with Khrushchev and MikOyan 
(during one of which the other members of the delegation may 
have been present); and early in November, after the close of 
the congress, all members of the delegation except Ghosh went 
on a tour of the Soviet provinces, while Ghosh remained in 
Moscow to confer with Suslov. It also seems reasonable to 
expect that some members of the delegation--most notably Das 
Gupta, the leftist leader*t-would have met with members of the 
CCP delegation during the congress, and one report of uncertain 
reliability purported to give details of such a conversation 
between Chou and the CPI leftists, in which Chou attacked 
Khrushchev's actions and policies along familiar Chinese lines. 
*A seven-man delegation was supposed to go to Moscow, but 
it is not certain that two of the lesser CPI delegates actually 
went. 
**On 24 September, Ranadive had reportedly sent an inter-
mediary to the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi to emphasize to 
the CCP that Das Gupta was a reliable member of the leftist 
faction and should be taken into confidence by the Chinese 
at the 22nd CPSU Congress.

There is little doubt that the CPI delegation, and Ghosh 
personally, were profoundly disturbed by the violent assault 
unleashed on the Albanian leaders at the congress in what was 
to prove the opening step in a campaign to force Peiping to 
relinquish support of Albania and thereby undermine its own 
challenge to CPSU authority over the international Communist 
movement. Ghosh well knew the reaction this would evoke from 
the left-faction strongholds of the CPI, and he may have sur-
mised that Chou En-lai's charge that the CPSU action was an 
un-Marxist way to try to resolve differences between Communist 
parties might receive sympathy even in sections of the Indian 
party normally loyal to the CPSU. In view of his subsequent 
statements, Ghosh may even have felt this way himself, although 
he certainly held no brief for the basic views of the Albanians 
or the Chinese; in any case, his primary concern was to pre-
serve his own position and if at all possible to prevent the 
public facade of CPI unity from being destroyed on the eve of 
a national election. In his speech to the CPSU Congress Ghosh 
therefore refrained for the time being from joining in the 
attackon the Albanian leadership; in this evasion he was joined 
at the congress by a number of other leaders of non-bloc Com-
munist parties who in the past had demonstrated at private in-
terparty meetings staunch loyalty to the CPSU and hostility 
to the CCP. 
This was not all, however: even worse, from Ghosh's 
point of view, was the equally violent attack at the CPSU Con-
gress upon Stalin. This attack placed upon the public record 
and even elaborated the denunciations of Stalin's crimes--and 
the revelations of the realities of Soviet life under his re-
gime--that had previously been recorded only in Khrushchev's 
1956 secret speech (which, while published by the West, did 
not have quite the same standing with non-bloc party members 
as a direct, public avowal of the facts by the CPSU). Ghosh 
could not forget the staggering and lasting effect upon CPI 
morale and discipline wrought by the first great denigration 
of Stalin; Namboodiripad in his organizational report to the 
April 1961 CPI Congress had declared the present chaos in the 
party in large part attributable to that event. Ghosh knew 
that despite the 1956 move against Stalin, the latter's 
memory was still revered by many members of all factions of 
the Indian party. The CPI general secretary also knew that 
his own position was in large part dependent upon that CPI 
rank-and-file faith in the happiness of life in the USSR and

the eternal wisdom of the CPSU which Khrushchev was busily 
,demolishing. For all these reasons, it is credible that, as 
reported, Ghosh in his private talk with Suslov "had a serious 
discussion over the deStalinization issue" and protested,. 
against the CPSU decision to remove Stalin's body from his 
tomb. (Ghosh, in fact, publicly confirmed this in New Age on 
10 December.) It was also reported that when during the�E6n-
gress the entire CPI delegation met with Khrushchev, this i0-
.sue was also raised; one delegate was said to have commented 
that Stalin was still highly regarded outside the USSR, and 
Khrushchev reportedly replied that this was an issue which the 
individual parties must handle as they see fit. 
.When Ghosh and the others returned to India in the first 
week of November, they found the party already in turmoil. 
During the 1-5 November meeting of the,Andhra Pradesh pro-
vincial party council, a complete split had developed, with 
the rightists supporting Khrushchev's action and calling, . 
Stalin a "sadist" and "fascist," and the leftists denouncing 
Khrushchev and saying that he should be "shot dead." :The 
provincial council finally narrowly passed a leftist-sponsored 
resolution attacking the CPSU and Khrushchev--the second time 
such a resolution was passed within the Indian party, the 
first having been the West Bengal statement of October 1960.* 
The resolution condemned both the Soviet public attack on 
Albania (as a regrettable violation of the principles, govern-
ing the settlement of such disputes) and the new attack on 
Stalin (as improper, disgraceful and tragic treatment of a 
still-respected figure). Though this resolution was not made 
public, four members of the Andhra party Council are reported 
to have cabled Khrushchev condemning his "vindictive" action. 
A number of party agencies and district committees of the 
West Bengal party meanwhile wrote to party headquarters can-
celling their subscriptions to New Age: in protest against the 
reports of Soviet attacks on Stalin which the central CPI pub-
lication was carrying. West Bengal leaders in mid-November 
were privately commenting that the Soviet "open and vitupera-
tive denunciation" of Albania had "certainly violated the 81-
Party Conference code of conduct between two sister parties," 
and that "the treatment of Albania was little different from 
the conduct of a colonial power." Calcutta district party 
leaders were reported quoting NCNA releases indicating Chinese 
*Subsequently, an unconfirmed Yugoslav press report on 10 
January 1962 claimed that the secretariat of the West Bengal 
party had also adopted a resolution denouncing the Soviet at-
tack on Albania at the 22nd Congress.

support for Albania. In Kerala, the party organ Jana Yugam 
on 31 October said that it was tragic that the battle against 
Stalinism had degenerated into an attack on his body, and one 
Kerala leader asked for the body to be sent to the Kerala 
party. Namboodiripad on 3 November reportedly praised Stalin 
and his work in a press conference. Members of the secretariat 
of one CPI district committee in Maharashtra published an open 
letter to Khrushchev urging him to "reconsider the propriety" 
of the decision to move Stalin's body, and asking (like Hoxha) 
whether Khrushchev's actions against his rivals was not build-
ing up a concentration of his own power and a cult of his own 
personality. Communists in the Tamilnad city of Madurai car-
ried pictures of Stalin in a procession of 18 November. The 
turmoil was equally great among sections of the party which 
accepted the accusations against Stalin: in early November, 
a general meeting of the Bombay City party organization was 
reported to have been broken up by wild heckling from the rank-
and-file, who shouted demands to the Bombay leaders to explain 
what they had been doing while Stalin was committing his crimes. 
_Much of this was discussed at a meeting of the CPI's Cen-
tral Executive Committee in early November which heard Ghosh 
report on the CPSU Congress events but took no action. In 
mid-November Sundarayya, Das Gupta, Namboodiripad, and several 
of the leftist-dominated provincial organizations were report-
ed demanding a meeting of the National Council to discuss the 
CPI position on Stalin and Albania; but Ghosh was opposed, be-
cause he knew that any such meeting would be disastrous for 
the party on the eve of the elections. He instead preferred 
to postpone the meeting until after the elections; the members 
of the National Council were polled, and it was reported that 
they agreed with him. Basavapunniah thereupon commented that 
Ghosh was hiding behind the elections to prevent the party 
from meeting to decide the issue, and that the internal con-
troversy would continue to rise nevertheless. 
Finally, Ghosh spoke out himself, in an effort to calm 
things down. On 10 December, he published an article in New 
Age in which he deferred to a later meeting of the National 
t-Efrincil any evaluation of the 22 Congress' attack on Albania 
"as well as the comment made by Chou En-lai on the propriety 
of making such open criticism." At the same time, he finally 
went on record with qualified support for Moscow against Al-
bania by mildly condemning Albanian attacks on Soviet foreign 
policy and on the 20th Congress decisions as "not in conformity"

with the 1960 Moscow Declaration.* (Ghosh's anxiety about the 
effect of the Sino-Albanian-Soviet struggle upon the CPI, how-
ever, was made manifest when he told a 16 December press con-
ference that "these differences should be ironed out by nego-
tiations and discussions as agreed to at the meeting of Commun-
ist parties in Moscow last year"--a statement suggesting that 
Ghosh privately agreed with Chou En-lai's point.) 
In his 10 December New Age article, Ghosh attempted to 
combat disallusionment wIEN the Soviet party with a lengthy 
tribute to the accomplishments of the Soviet Union, the signi-
ficance of the new CPSU program, and the role of the CPSU as 
the "vanguard of the world Communist movement." At the same 
time, he stated that a "big majority" of CPI members had been 
"deeply hurt" by the decision to move Stalin's body, he insist-
ed that Stalin was a distinguished Marxist-Leninist of extreme 
.importance, and he expressed "deep regret" that the struggle 
against Stalin's cult had been carried so far. Moreover, Ghosh 
implicitly sided with the Italian party in declaring that the 
question of how the excesses occurred and how they would be 
prevented from recurring had not been properly answered. Ghosh 
added this pointed warning that Khrushchev had undermined not 
only Stalin's but the CPSU's authority: 
The 20th Congress...not merely ended the deification 
of Stalin, but also demolished the belief in the in-
fallibility of any Party or any leader. This was neces-
sary for such a belief is contrary to the very-spirit 
of Marxism-Leninism.** (Emphasis added) 
Ghosh concluded by admitting that even CPI members were 
"dumbfounded and demoralized" by these events, by begging party 
members to keep silent, and be declaring that it was impossible 
*A number of other non-bloc Communist parties whose repre-
sentatives did not attack Albania at the CPSU Congress never-
theless went on record against the Albanians subsequently; it 
is likely that this belated conformity (which has still not 
extended even to all European parties) was evoked by subsequent 
CPSU pressure, and it is possible that such pressure was ap-
plied also to Ghosh. 
**Khrushchev subsequently conceded, in another context, that 
he personally was not infallible.

to hold a National Council meeting to discuss recent develop-
ments until after the approaching elections. 
Sino-Soviet Policy on India and the Return of the Border  
Dispute: By the time Ghosh wrote the New Age article cited, 
however, another factor had arisen to exacerbate greatly rela-
tions between the CPI factions and between Moscow and Peiping: 
a revival of the border dispute. 
During the latter half of 1961, the Soviet and Chinese 
attitudes toward the Nehru government had continued to move 
further along the lines each had marked out. The USSR main-
tained a policy of economic assistance to India and continued 
to depict Nehru's foreign policy as generally progressive, 
while simultaneously sustaining discreet pressure upon the 
Indian government to bend toward the Soviet view on specific 
topical issues. In the latter half of the year, the emphasis 
shifted from the Congo and Cuba, and the most important of 
these. pressures were now concerned with the Soviet resumption 
of nuclear testing, Nehru's stand at the neutralists' con-
ference, and particularly the Berlin issue. The CPI was re-
peatedly briefed by the CPSU on these issues in the spring 
and summer, and maintained continued propaganda pressure in 
support of Moscow's position. While Nehru's actions and state-
ments in each of these matters was far from wholly satisfactory 
to Moscow, the USSR did not at any time repeat its earlier 
direct criticism of the Indian government. Meanwhile, a 
subsidiary campaign which the Soviet Union had been actively 
promoting for a long time--both directly and through the CPI--
to induce Nehru to take armed action against the Portuguese 
enclave of Goa finally bore fruit in December, with a number 
of gratifying consequences: it forced the United States and 
Britain to take stands publicly condemning India; it promoted 
disharmony between Portugal and the other NATO allies; it 
distracted some Indian public attention and anger from the 
Chinese border dispute; it enabled the CPI to wear the cloak 
of Indian nationalism it had been unable to assume on the 
Chinese border issue; and it bolstered the stock of the un-
popular but pro-Soviet Indian defense minister, Krishna Menon, 
who was reported in trouble in his campaign for re-election 
to Parliament from Bombay. 
Aside from the question of the Sino-Indian border, there 
was only one aspect of Soviet policy toward the non-Communist 
world during this period which caused any internal difficulties 
for the CPI: the decision to resume nuclear testing. This 
decision caused the Indian party some embarrassment in the 
election campaign because of its earlier vigorous campaigns 
against American testing; it also evoked some disarray on 
the fringes of the party, among fellow-travellers and extreme

right-wing party members. Thus the Indian branch of the Afro-
Asian Solidarity Committee reportedly adopted a resolution 
expressing regret at the Soviet decision, an abortive attempt 
was said to have been made in the All-India Peace Council to 
do the same, and two rightist CPI leaders in Kerala made pub-
lic statements opposing the USSR's action. On the whole, how-
ever, the internal CPI troubles over this issue were so minor 
as to be totally obscured by the violent disturbances which 
shook the party in November and December over other issues. 
Peiping in the latter half of 1961 maintained its vitriolic 
line toward Nehru, continuing in its propaganda to build up 
a picture of him as a faithful servant of American imperialism 
and enemy of both Peiping and Moscow. To maintain this single-
hued portrait, Chinese propaganda continued to make extremely 
tendentious selections from Nehru's statements, going to 
extravagant lengths in this regard in connection with the 
neutralist conference and Nehru's remarks on the Berlin is-
sue. On the Indian side, general relations with Peiping con-
tinued to worsen, with the Indian government taking steps to 
round up and expel more Chinese from Calcutta and to dis-
courage all activities of the India-China Friendship Society. 
In the meantime, the border issue again became inflamed, 
with Peiping and New Delhi again exchanging charges of fresh 
border incursions in a series of notes in the summer and fall. 
On 20 November, Nehru brought these matters to public atten-
tion before the Indian Parliament, thereby setting in motion 
new violent denunciations of the rPR by tie Indian and Western 
press. Peiping believed 
that Nehru naa peen persuaded to take this action by President 
Kennedy during the Indian Prime Minister's November visit to 
the United States; indeed, Peiping subsequently publicly said 
as much. The Chinese Communist regime may also have believed 
that despite India's public support for Peiping's admission 
to the United Nations, Nehru's statement was timed to help the 
United States block this action by influencing hesitant neu-
trals against Peiping. 
Already angered by this action of Nehru's, Peiping was 
infuriated when on 21 November, the day after Nehru's statement, 
Ajoy Ghosh issued a public statement on his own initiative as 
CPI general secretary strongly criticizing the CPR. Ghosh 
expressed "surprise and regret" at the information disclosed 
by the Indian government, implicitly accepting the Indian ver-
sion as beyond question. He declared that the Chinese actions 
could not but heighten tension and embitter relations between

%NW 
the two countries, and "demanded" that the CPR government 
put an end to such actions and take measures to ensure that 
they would not recur. 
It is likely, in view of Peiping's reaction, that the CCP 
concluded that Ghosh had been incited to make this statement 
by the CPSU--particularly in the context of the increasingly 
open propaganda and organizational battle that was simultaneously 
developing between the Sovdet-led parties and the Chinese-
Albanian bloc. A CPI leftist member of the delegation to the 
CPSU congress subsequently claimed that the Chinese delegation 
to that congress had briefed the CPI at the time on the Chi-
nese version of the current border controversy; and a fairly 
reliable source reports statements by the Maharashtra leader 
Sardesai, another CPI representative at the Soviet congress, 
alleging that Khrushchev told the Indian delegation that Nehru, 
as a "patriotic leader," was bound to resist aggression, and 
that the CPI should take a "practical" attitude toward this 
problem. Although this evidence is not conclusive, it does 
seem probable that the CPSU was also aware in October of the 
Sino-lndiah exchange of notes, considered it possible that this 
would lead to public polemics, and authorized Ghosh to take 
such action as he saw fit if this happened.* 
After waiting two weeks, Peiping in early December pub-
lished the texts of the notes it had exchanged with New Delhi, 
followed by a ferocious People's Daily editorial denouncing 
the "anti-Chinese campaign launched by Nehru in India." In 
this editorial, Peiping summed up all its efforts of the past 
year to indict Nehru as an enemy of progressive mankind, and 
charged that he had initiated his "anti-Chinese campaign" at 
American instigation to hurt the bloc, as well as to bolster 
what Peiping depicted as the sagging chances of the Congress 
party in the coming Indian elections. In addition, in this 
editorial the CCP finally gave vent publicly to its long-held 
feelings about Ghosh, attacking him for having "trailed be-
hind Nehru and hurriedly issued a statement in condemnation 
of China...without bothering to find out the truth or to look 
into the rights and wrongs of the case." 
*It is particularly credible that the CPSU gave Ghosh such. 
contingency authorization because this is exactly what had 
happened in October 1959, when the CPI made its strongest pre-
vious criticism of Peiping in connection with the Ladakh in-
cidents. (See pages 71-72.)

party to Ghosh that circulation. of NewAge would be halted 
completely in that province if,such statements continued. 
Other, leftists meanwhile avowed. their intention to contradict 
GhOsh if they were questioned during the election, campaign 
about Ghosh's statement.* The West Bengal party orgaiLSwadhinata 
did in fact publish articles strongly attacking Nehru=along 
the lines Peiping had taken, and as in the past, these arti-
cles were Picked up by NCNA and. Peoples. Daily. :As.one con-
sequence of this SwadhinataA.ine, an information official of 
the Soviet embassy was reported to have refused an interview 
to a representative of the paper; earlier, Westi3engaIlead-
ers had privately charged that the USSR had cancelled Promised 
visits by Major Titov and Paul Robeson to a "peace festival" 
sponsored by the 'West Bengal party in early November because 
of the stand of the provincial organization. 
The Peiping-Nehru polemic was soon intermeshed with the 
broader Sino-Soviet battle going on concurrently, with, Albania 
amplifying Peiping's denunciations of the Indian leader-, and 
other East European states, like the USSR, refusing to do so. 
Even before the 7 December People's Daily editorial :had been 
published, Moscow's alarm at the whole trend of events was 
made apparent when on 2 December TABS announced that an invi-
,tation extended to Brezhnev during the. summer to Visit India 
at an opportune time was now being accepted, and that Brezhnev 
was to arrive within two weeks. When Brezhnev arrived on this 
emergency journey, he was accompanied by a deputy chairman 
of the USSR's State Commission for Foreign Economic Relations, 
and it appeared liekly that the Soviet policy of support and 
economic help for the Nehru government was to be emphatically 
reaffirmed. 
By mid-December, Ghosh had backed off very slightly from 
. his extreme anti-Chinese position, telling a press conference 
that some political parties wished to make capital of the Sino-

Indian dispute, and praising Nehru for not seeking war with 
China as a means of settling the dispute. At the same time, 
he reaffirmed that if Peiping indulged in any act of aggres-
sion, India would be justified in repelling the: intruders. 
Other CPI rightists were not so forebearing toward Peiping. 
Central Secretariat member Ahmad on 13 December publicly 
declared, in response to a question about the Chinese attacks 
on Ghosh, that Ghosh could well look after himself "and needs 
no advice from outside as to what he should do in a matter 
with which the Indian people as a whole are vitally concerned." 
Ahmad'dismissed as "absurd" the People's Daily contention 
that India's foreign policy and her attitude toward the CPR 
was determined by the "lure of the dollar," and reasserted 
CPI support for Nehru's foreign policy. 
F. Prospects for the Indian Communist Party 
By the end of 1961, then, the Indian Communist Party had 
reached a point at which the right wing of the party was openly 
criticizing the CCP and was being criticized by it; was support-
ing Moscow generally against Albania and China, though regret,. 
ing the means that had been used to attack Albania; was itself 
shocked by and divided over the new assault on Stalin, and was 
publicly regretting that Khrushchev had reopened this issue. 
The left wing was publishing statements supporting the Chinese 
line on Nehru; was censuring and sometimes even boycotting 
the central party organ for its anti-Chinese statements; had 
adopted at least one resolution attacking Khrushchev and the 
CPSU; and was generally united in opposition to the Soviet 
moves against Albania, China, and Stalin. 
On 6 November, Indian leftist members of the National 
Council are said to have conferred with Basavapunniah and to 
have agreed with his judgment that the CPI could no longer 
be held together, and must break up after. the 1962 elections. 
Basavapunniah was said to have felt that it was only the elec-
tions which were maintaining the facade of CPI unity now, and 
that the only thing which could pull the party together might 
be an unexpected success at the polls. Later in the month, 
after conferring with Ranadive, Basavapunniah took a slightly 
less extreme position, asserting that the leftists were pre-
paring a document which would force the issue of the CPI's

international allegiance at the CPI.Congress or National Coun-
cil meeting to be held after the elections. He added that if 
the rightists did not agree at least to a policy of non-align-
ment with either Peiping or Moscow, the leftists would initi-
ate a split in the party. At about the same time, S. G. Sardesai, 
secretary of the Mararashtrh ?rovincial party organization and 
a leader of the right-wing CP: faction, reportedly warned a 
meeting of his followers to be prepared for a split between 
the pro-Soviet and pro-Chinese wings of the CPI (and of other 
Communist parties) as a result of the Sino-Soviet struggle. 
In evaluating the reality of the leftist threat to split 
the party, it must be remembered that non-alignment, insofar 
as it involves neutrality on policy issues disputed by Moscow 
and Peiping, is simply not possible for the CPI. For example, 
the question of policy toward the Nehru government, on which 
many of the differences between the CPSU and CCP have focussed 
in recent years, cannot be evaded by the Indian party; the CPI 
must lean either to one side or the other, since it can neither 
avoid having a policy toward Nehru nor reconcile the incom-
patible policies of the Chinese and Soviet leaderships. Simi-
larly, the questions of whether or not to continue to seek 
power through parliamentary elections, of whether to seek to 
draw the national bourgeoisie into an alliance, cannot be in-
definitely evaded in fact although they .can be blurred over 
in compromise resolutions. Entirely apart from the policies 
urged on each wing of the party by Moscow and Peiping, extrem-
ists of each wing have their own oonvictions which they will. 
not give up. The CPI in recent years has prevented this 
fundamental contradiction from tearing it apart only by allow-
ing the provincial organizations dominated by one or another 
faction to follow in practice their own line, within very 
broad limits commonly agreed upon in the center.* With the 
continued polarization of the party along Soviet and Chinese 
lines, however, this arrangement has tended to break down, 
because worsening relations between the CPSU and the CCP have 
*One prominent West Bengal party leader privately acknowl-
edged in November that the CPI had "now become almost a 
loose federation type" of party along the lines of the Indian 
bourgeois parties.

inevitably led to open conflict between the autonomous left-
ist provinces and the center. Basavapunniah on 6 November 
declared that if the Chinese party were to "take action 
against the CPSU"--meaning a direct attack on Khrushchev--this 
would cause the breakup of the CPI; and in this he was probably 
correct. In the absence of Sino-Soviet mutual direct denuncia-
tion, however, the CPSU will in the near future probably con-
tinue to strive to maintain the facade of unity in the Indian 
party. It would do so if only because the three greatest 
centers of Communist popular strength in India--Kerala, Andhra 
and West Bengal--are also centers of considerable left-faction 
rank-and-file strength, so that in the event of the formation 
of two Communist parties in India the leftist one, oriented 
toward the CCP, might well take with it a great deal of the 
present party. 
By the estimate of the CPI itself, the February elections 
are unlikely to help the party significantly, and are hence 
themselves unlikely to help keep the party united. Therefore, 
whether and how long the CPSU, in the absence of an open Sino-
Soviet split, would be successful in holding the Indian party 
together would depend on a number of long-term factors which 
are beyond the scope of this paper: how many concessions the 
CPSU would be willing again to make to the leftist faction; 
the development of Sino-Soviet relations, and of the policy 
of the Chinese leadership toward the CPI; how far the Soviet 
deStalinization campaign is continued and extended, and how 
far Soviet prestige suffers in consequence; whether Nehru and 
his successors within the Indian government and the Congress 
party veer toward the left or the right on foreign and domestic 
policy; the overall state of East-West relations, and the 
prospects for the peaceful coexistence line; and the related 
question of the future views of the Soviet leadership on the 
current balance of power, the level of acceptable risks, and 
the consequent choice of a more or less militant policy toward 
the West. 
Finally, Soviet short-term chances of averting a schism 
in the CPI must hinge in large part on Moscow's success or failure 
in finding a suitable successor to Ajoy Ghosh, who died on 13 
January 1962. It will be most difficult to discover any CPI 
leader who is both firmly reliable from the CPSU's point of 
view and capable of conciliating the opposing wings of the In-
dian party in their present hostile mood. The most obvious 
candidate will be E.M.S. Namboodiripad, who has aspired to

succeed Ghosh for several years and who has served as acting 
general secretary on occasion; however, Namboodiripad has 
made many gestures toward the leftists over the past two years 
in response to their growing strength within the party, and 
there are good indications that he is now distrusted both by 
the CPI's right wing and by the CPSU. If Namboodiripad were 
chosen general secretary, this might increase leftist influ-
ence within the central CPI machinery sufficiently to induce 
the party militants not to split away--but at the cost of 
reduced Soviet influence within the Indian party and increased 
disaffection by the CPI rightists. If on the other hand Mos-
cow were to succeed in installing as general secretary a right-
ist such as Dange or even some neutral nonentity, Soviet in-
fluence in the party center might be preserved, but the danger 
of a leftist split would be increased. The most hopeful expedient 
for Moscow would seem to be to accept Namboodiripad reluctantly 
as the new CPI leader and attempt to influence him subsequently 
to turn again in the Soviet and moderate direction. This, 
Namboodiripad is opportunistic enough to do; but there is as 
yet no evidence that Moscow has resolved upon this course, or 
that, if followed, it would extricate the CPSU from its Indian 
dilemma.
