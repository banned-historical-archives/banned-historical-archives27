 USSR-US: Neutron Bomb Campaign
 //The Soviets are trying to discredit the US
 position on arms control and disarmament by playing up the
 world press reaction to possible US deployment of neutron war
 heads in Western in Europe.
 For the past two weeks, the Soviets have been select-
 ing commentary from the world press and using their own edito-
 rials to portray neutron weapons as inhumane and as an impedi-
 ment to further progress on arms limitation. Pravda has cited
 the weapon as a case study of "secret" US policymaking, and
 Tass said yesterday that the issue would hamper the mutual and
 balanced force reduction talks. Other Soviet commentary has
 charged that deployment of neutron weapons would be contrary
 to decisions reached at the Helsinki conference.

 Approved Foti
 Although Soviet media have stressed that the neutron
 weapaa IS a new development of major consequence, the Soviets
 presumably realize that the weapon probably would have little
 impact on the military balance in Europe and that the warhead
 would be deployed on existing delivery systems. The Soviets,
 nevertheless, are presumably concerned that the neutron weapon
 might make NATO less reluctant to escalate to nuclear war over
 Western Europe.
 Enhanced-radiation weapons, moreover, would provide
 US forces in Western Europe with increased flexibility, partic-
 ularly in view of Moscow's general lack of passive defense
 against a neutron warhead for its tactical field forces.
 Thus far, the increased criticism of US weapons pro-
 grams   a                      not altered an apparent Soviet decision to tone down
 personal criticism of President Carter. For the past several
 months, the Soviets have been painting a highly negative pic-
 ture of the President's intentions. More recently, however, the
 Soviet attacks have been against US policies rather than the
 US President, particularly on issues related to SALT and the
 Middle East.
 Apparently some Soviet leaders believe that the almost
 unrelieved negative assessment of the Carter administration's
 intentions was counterproductive, although there has apparently
 been no decision to change the substance of Soviet accusations
 on key policy-related issues.
 ALBANIA-CHINA: Breaking Point
 A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman has denied
 that China has been asked to withdraw its advisers from Albania.
 The denial is designed to scotch press speculation that rela-
 tions between the two countries are reaching the breaking
 point. Peking is clearly sensitive to the kind of crowing that
 is coming from Moscow and Eastern Europe over China's diffi-
 culties with what was its main ideological ally.
 I             There is little doubt that in recent weeks Chinese-
 Albanian relations have reached an all-time low. Frictions be-
 tween the two countries date at least from China's opening to

 the West in 1971, but the dispute has clearly taken on new im-
 portance in Albania since the emergence of the new Chinese
 leadership last fall.
 The Albanians resented the purge of China's leading
 e  is s, with whom Tirana felt it had a special relationship.
 The Albanians also almost certainly were angered by the recent
 rehabilitation of Teng Hsiao-ping, whose ouster last year was
 applauded in the Albanian media.  In addition, the Albanian
 leadership, which has long been at odds with Yugoslavia, is no
 doubt irritated that in the coming weeks Peking will play host
 to Yugoslav President Tito for the first time.
 //A break with China would have important implica-
 tions for Albania. Chinese economic and military aid, although
 reduced significantly, has been continuing. Some projects
 started years ago are still in progress, but apparently no new
 aid projects were contracted for the current five-year-plan
 period (1976-1980).//
 Recent Albanian attempts to improve political and eco-
 nomic re ations with selected West European countries--partic-
 ularly Greece and France--show that Tirana is concerned about
 its isolation. The Albanian regime, which has sharply criticized
 Peking for its "opportunistic" attempts to better relations
 with the West, is now itself seeking such ties with noncommu-
 nist countries.  It is doubtful, however, that these countries
 would fill the gap created by a Chinese decision to end as-
 sistance to Albania.
 An alternative for the Albanians would be to reestab-
 lish relations with an earlier ally, the Soviet Union. Alba-
 nian propaganda, however, continues to assail the Soviet lead-
 ership. In talks with foreign diplomats earlier this month,
 Premier Shehu said that Albania was still worried about Soviet
 aggressiveness. There is no indication that any faction within
 the Albanian leadership is hoping for the return of the Soviets.
 Moscow would be interested in resuming contacts with
 Tirana and has put out feelers to test Albanian receptiveness.
 Prior to late 1961, when the two countries broke diplomatic
 relations, Moscow maintained a strong economic and military
 presence in Albania. The Albanian port of Vlore was at one
 time the only Soviet naval base on the Mediterranean.

 NAMIBIA:   SWAPO's Weak Leadership
 //The South-West Africa `People's Organization has
 accepted the invitation of the five-power Western contact group
 to meet in New York to discuss the talks with South Africa on
 independence for Namibia.  SWAPO president Nujoma will head the
 delegation, but no other important SWAPO leader is accompanying
 him.  Nujoma is a weak leader and the decision to send a Zow-level
 delegation with him may reflect internal frictions in the SWAPO
 leadership.//
 //SWAPO has proposed that the talks begin August 8.
 Nujoma and SWAPO's representatives to the UN, Theo-Ben Gurirab,
 will participate, but most other members of the delegation appear
 to be low-level officials. No representative of SWAPO's internal
 wing in Namibia was named to the delegation. SWAPO internal and
 external leaders had accused the five-power group of trying to
 split the movement by briefing its leaders separately, and this
 was a major factor behind Western efforts to assemble the major
 SWAPO leaders in New York.//
 //The five Western states--the US, the UK, West
 Germany, France, and Canada--have often encountered difficulties
 in briefing SWAPO leaders;  the peripatetic Nujoma can almost never
 be found, and the invitation to the New York meeting was outstand-
 ing for more than a month. Although these problems can be attri-
 buted in part to SWAPO suspicions of South African motives and
 to problems of communication among SWAPO officials, frictions
 within the movement's top ranks--stemming in large part from
 Nujoma's weak leadership--could be a major cause of the diffi-
 culty.//
 //Although Nujoma is reputed to speak for SWAPO,
 he invariably has refrained from committing the movement to any
 course of action until he can consult fully with the executive
 committee.//
 //SWAPO vice president Muyongo recently affirmed
 the signs icance of the executive committee's role when he told
 US officials that the delegation could make decisions in New
 York only if executive committee approval were obtained before-
 hand. The behavior of these SWAPO leaders suggests the presence
 of personal rivalries--and even substantive differences--in the
 top ranks of the movement.//

 EAST GERMANY: Dissident Critics

 regime for the first time since the expulsion last November of
 dissident singer WoZf Biermann.

 A number of interviews with and articles by dissi-
 dents have appeared in the Western press in the last two weeks.
 Some dissidents now believe that the regime's easing of controls
 last year was only temporary and intended to keep dissident in-
 tellectuals off balance. They allege that the party is now try-
 ing to bring pressure on those who signed a declaration of soli-
 darity with Biermann.
 Because of these pressures, several noted East Ger-
 man artists and writers have said they also plan to emigrate.
 On the other hand, regime critics like Jurek Becker, who was
 interviewed recently by the West German news magazine Der
 Spiegel, and Stefan Heym, an internationally respected writer
 who talked with Newsweek, have said they will remain. They have
 vowed to criticize the regime when they see fit.
 The government,  fearing that an organized dissident
 movement could develop, has been encouraging unrepentant critics
 to leave quietly. The party is anxious to avoid incidents during
 the Belgrade talks on European security, and it probably also
 hopes that the departures will break up nascent dissident groups
 by getting rid of their leaders.
 II A number of well-known intellectuals,  like novelist
 Reine-Kunze, have already left the country, and those who re-
 main may also find it difficult to withstand the pressure to
 emigrate.
 USSR: Fisheries Agreements with LDCs
 anxious to bypass constraints on its fish-
 The USSR
 ,
 ing industry imposed by the 200-mile territorial zones declared
 by various countries, has continued to expand its fisheries
 assistance program in the Third World. New agreements in the
 past 18 months with seven developing countries--mostly to create
 joint fishing ventures--bring the total number of such Soviet
 fisheries accords to 38.
 These agreements give the USSR the most widespread
 and largest fisheries assistance program among the developing
 countries. They also provide Moscow with fishing concessions
 and logistic support for its vast fishing fleet at relatively
 small cost.
 Approved F
 Approved For
 I            Initially, the USSR viewed fisheries assistance as a
 men.'Avis o  satisfying the requirements of its own far-flung fleet.
 By providing these countries with extensive port and processing
 facilities, trawlers,  fishing gear, and training, the Soviets
 have obtained reciprocal services and access to port facilities,
 prolonging the fleet's time at sea.
 In recent years, the USSR has increasingly preferred
 to engage ,in joint ownership arrangements in which 49 percent
 of the investment is Soviet. Because 60 percent of the Soviet
 catch comes from within 200 miles of the coasts of other coun-
 tries, the USSR has felt the need to guarantee its long-term
 access to developing countries' waters and to secure a voice
 in their national fisheries policies.
 Through the :joint ventures, the developing countries
 receive technical services, training, and research facilities
 with minimum outlays. They also obtain modern facilities
 through lease or purchase from the Soviets.
 I              More recently, Moscow has negotiated commercial joint
 ventures designed to provide Soviet fishing vessels with ship-
 chandling services and to aid in processing,  freezing, and
 marketing the Soviet catch. These ventures are located in Singa-
 pore, Spain, and the Philippines.
 Fransov, a joint Soviet-French company established in
 1975, acts as an agent for the Soviet fleet in obtaining fishing
 rights in waters of countries where direct Soviet access has
 been politically impossible. Fransov also markets some of the
 Soviet fleet's catch from African waters, registers Soviet
 trawlers in developing countries, and may be managing construc-
 tion of Soviet shore facilities in several countries.
 I            The use of joint commercial companies, such as Fransov,
 appeals Jto some governments because they can receive the benefits
 of an increased fish catch as well as profits from sales and yet
 not   a  the political cost of direct association with Moscow.

 USSR: Retail Services Resolutions
 //A the Soviet joint party-government resolution on
 improving retail trade highlights Moscow's concern with con-
 sumer morale,                        at a low ebb as  local food shortages continue to
 exacerbate the problems of daily  living in the USSR. Although
 the decree is more notable for recognizing existing problems,
 it does provide a setting for some expansion of private sector
 food output. Unless funds are provided and incentives are given
 to workers,  however,  significant improvement in this area is
 unlikely.//
 Sections of the decree that are most likely to alle-
 viate current problems include:
 --Orders to local governments to increase the amount of
 produce from private plots being brought to collective
 farm markets.
 --Orders to collective and state farms to allocate motor
 transport to help get surplus produce to the market.
 --Provisions for the construction of new markets.
 To the extent that these measures are implemented,
 they will rejuvenate the collective farm markets, which have
 deteriorated over the past decade. They also would represent
 a retreat from a policy to move away from reliance on the
 private sector.
 I            Since the 1975 harvest disaster,  an extensive cam-
 paign  as been under way urging local administrations to make
 full use of private sector food production. Now that the cam-
 paign is at least partially codified there should be a marked
 increase in the private sector's contribution to food supplies.
 Other sections of the decree that go beyond the
 ,
 usual exhortations to provide better quality and "more polite"
 service include:
 --An order to industrial ministries producing consumer
 goods to open stores for direct sales to the public.

 --Authorization for local governments to build retail
 trade enterprises after.1979.
 --Permission for state finance organs to loan money to
 retail establishments to build or modernize their prem-
 ises and support facilities.
 The stress on more self-service stores and on pre-
 pactaging consumer goods--both still relatively uncommon in
 the USSR--could ease the consumer's lot significantly. Soviet
 families are estimated to spend nearly two hours each day buy-
 ing necessities.
 At the same time, the resolution repeats much of the
 language used in pronouncements from earlier years, most re-
 cently in 1972, to improve trade. The earlier decrees were not-
 able for their lack of results. Without provision for specific
 investment funds--in addition to those already allocated for
 the tenth five-year plan period  (1976 to 1980)--and without in-
 centives to encourage retail workers, it is unlikely that sub-

 Pakistan's military government yesterday released
 former prime minister Bhutto and 15 other political leaders
 who had been in custody since the coup on July 5.
 The release is a further indication that Chief Martial
 Law Administrator Zia-ul-Haq, despite the objections of some
 senior army officers, is still determined to hold elections
 and give up power in October. He has made it clear, however,
 that he is prepared to impose strict controls on political
 activity if necessary. The threat of violence throughout the
 country and separatist tendencies in the two westernmost prov-
 inces are major concerns to him.

 Most political activity is banned until the formal
 opening of the campaign. in mid-September. With the release of
 Bhutto and the others, the actual campaign could well begin
 much earlier and, despite Zia's efforts, could quickly become
 vituperative and violent.
 I               //Guatemala and the UK agreed yesterday to take
 steps to reduce tensions on the border between Guatemala and
 the internally self-governing British territory of Belize, and
 to continue negotiations on Belize's future. Three weeks ago
 the British reinforced their garrison in Belize following what
 they perceived to be an increased Guatemalan military threat to
 enforce its claim to Belize.//
 //No dates were set yesterday for the withdrawal
 o   British reinforcements or the next round of talks, but Brit-
 ish Foreign Office Undersecretary Ted Rowlands said that the
 military situation in Belize would "reflect the course of the
 negotiations." Both sides also promised to find formulas to
 prevent incidents along the border.
 Yugoslavia:
 The Soviet delegation to the Belgrade CSCE meeting
 continues to insist upon a firm closing date for the fall review
 conference, thereby reducing the likelihood of an early end to
 the current session.
 At an evening meeting on Wednesday, the Soviets sharply
 reiterated, their refusal to accept the Western and neutral
 position that the duration of the fall meeting be determined
 by consensus. Moscow has accepted a provision for reconvening
 the fall meeting on January 16, 1978, if work on the concluding
 document remains uncompleted, but the Soviets want a guarantee
 that all work will come to an end within four weeks from that
 date.
