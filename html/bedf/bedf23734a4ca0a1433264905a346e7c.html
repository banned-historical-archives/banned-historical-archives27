DAILY BRIEF 
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
*Communist bloc outlines tactics for Latin America: Latin 
American delegates to the 21st Soviet party congress have re-
turned from Moscow and a side trip to Peiping armed with 
new tactical plans worked out with the Soviet party as well as.. 
guidance and offers of training from the Chinese Communists;) 
(The delegates were told to eliminate defense of the USSR 
fro their propaganda and to play down their subordination to 
Moscow, concentrating instead on the "liberation" of their own 
countries. They decided to schedule an anti-imperialist "Peo-
ple's Congress" to meet sometime before July in Latin Amer-
ica and, concealing its Communist origin, to attempt to exploit 
the popularity of Cardenas, Figueres, Be ancourt, and Castro 
who would be asked to serve as sponsors. 
The  Latin American Communists were received in Peiping 
by Mao Tse-tung and Liu Shao-chi who expounded at some 
length on the benefits not only of maintaining but of increas-
ing tension, which "benefits all Communist parties" and forces 
the West to scatter its strength over a vast area. As an ex-
ample, the Chinese cited their tactics in the Taiwan Strait sit-
uation which had "helped by di rting imperialist forces" fol-
lowing US landings in Lebanon. 
The treatment given the delegation in China provides the 
strongest indication to date that Peiping is bent on increasing 
its influence in Latin America. Peiping has decided to sponsor 
a 4-6 month course in "practical" tactics for Latin American 
Communists, The Chinese Communists stressed the need for 
clandestine activity carried out by underground parties parallel 
with existing 'Latin American Communist parties.)

Moscow and Peiping Lay Out Tactics for Latin America

the 20 Latin American parties, 18 were represented

series of conferences with key Soviet officials in early Febru-
ary and with Chinese Communist party leaders later in the 
month, the Latin Americans were given extensive advice on, 
increasing their effectiveness in the "imperialist backyard.") 
the Soviet officials pro-
fessed concern that emphasis on Moscow's domination of the 
Communist movement had hampered the activities of national 
Communist parties, and called for the elimination from all 
Communist literature of reference to the "directing role" of 
the USSR. The Latin American delegates were told to elim-
inate defense of the USSR from their propaganda and to play 
down their subordination to Moscow, concentrating instead on 
the "liberation" of their own countries, thereby weakening the 
"common enemy." The Latin Americans decided to convene 
a "People's Congress," sometime prior to July. By conceal-
ing its origin, the Communists hope to attract former Mex-
ican President Cardenas, former Costa Rican President Fi-
gueres,Venezuelan President Betancourt, and Cuban Prime 
Minister Castro as sponsors of the congress and to reap the 
advantages of their popularity. The major theme of the con-
gress would be struggle against Latin American dictatorships 
and defense of the new revolutionary "democratic" regimes)

whic visited Peiping after the Soviet congress was a strong 
indication of Peiping's interest in increasing its influenc!)

(among Communists in underdeveloped areas, particularly 
Latin America, Mao Tse-tung and second-ranking party 
leader Liu Shao-chi, among other top leaders who conferred 
with the Latin Americans, impressed on them the suitability 
of Chinese Communist revolutionary tactics in the underde-
veloped conditions of Latin America, The Chinese argued 
that events in Cuba had proven that the "imperialists are pa-
per tigers." They asserted that a "policy of tension" benefits 
Communist parties, which can force "imperialists to spread 
their forces thin over a vast area." As an example, they cited 
their tactics in the Taiwan Strait situation which had "helped 
by diverting imperialist forces". following US landings in 
Lebanon) 
(The Chinese advised formation of clandestine parties in 
each .Latin American country to function parallel to the es-
tablished Communist parties, arguing that they themselves 
had used similar methods, "especially in Shanghai," to great 
advantage) 
(The Chinese offered to set up in Peiping, at Chinese ex-
pense, a four- to six-month course for Latin American lead-
ership cadres. The course, to begin in August, would stress 
the "practical experience" of the Chinese revolution, rather 
than genyal Communist theory "which could be learned in any 
country."

II. ASIA-AFRICA 
Nehru's Position in Tibet 
(While officially maintaining his policy of noninterference 
in the Tibetan situation, Prime Minister Nehru apparently has 
given secret assurances to resistance leaders in India that he 
will provide what diplomatic support he can, as well as asylum 
for the Dalai Lama and his staff. The Indian leader on 31 March 
publicly expressed his sympathy to a large delegation of Tibetans 
from the Indian frontier town of Kalimpong, but pointed out that 
India was not in a position to intervene and counseled patience) 
In a meeting later with the Dalai Lama's brother, a 
leader of the Indian-based resistance movement, Nehru prom-
ised he would take up the Tibetan question with Peiping and urge 
that Tibet be granted full autonomy. Nehru's own doubt that this 
approach would be successful suggests that his offer of support 
represents more a gesture to the ,5ebels than an indication of 
firm intention to pressure Peiping 
(Ip the event Nehru does approach the Chinese on behalf of 
the Tibetans, they probably will inform him that Tibet is consid-
ered "autonomous" and that Indian representations are regarded 
as "interference." People's Daily on 31 March stated, "No for-
eign country should inter ere in the Tibet rebellion, �which is an 
internal affair of China)' 
Peiping's repetition of charges that Kalimpong is a "corn-
man ding center of the rebellion" provoked a new uproar in the 
Indian Parliament on 1 April. In view of the fact that Nehru had 
categorically denied this allegation on 30 March, the deputy ex-
ternal affairs minister ) ccused the Chinese of challenging Nehru's 
"integrity and honesty." 
r(he Dalai Lama's party was last reported to have been expected 
at the Indian frontier in Assam on 31 March. In reaffirming that the 
Indian Government would "definitely" grant asylum to the Dalai Lama 
and his staff, Nehru told the Lama's brotlier it would be best that he 
be brought to the New Delhi area, where Nehru could keep in touch 
with him. The prime minister said his government was already mak-
ing arrangements for the Dalai Lama's stay in India and he would Der-
sonally discuss his future with him)

UAR Attitude on Rapprochement  With US 
(Despite the expressed desire of some UAR officials for 
a demonstration of American support of Nasir's anti-Commu-
nist campaign, the regime apparently hopes to avoid the im-
pression of a rapprochement with the United States which 
would lend credibility to Communist charges that Nasir is 
now subservient to the "imperialists." 
 Cairo wishes 
to be "cautious and reserved" in dealing with Washington. 
apparently referring to Kamal's reports to Cairo on his ta s 
with US State Department officials, 
 Cairo is obviously 
anxious to continue at least the appearance of neutrality. Both 
Baghdad and Moscow have claimed repeatedly that Western 
interests are behind Nasir's attacks on the USSR and Arab 
Communists. Cairo officials are also fearful of a cessation 
of Soviet economic and military aid as retaliation to Nasir's 
continued attacks on the USSR's interference in Arab affairs. 
They probably hope for American assurances of support in 
the event of Soviet sanctions, but at this time they apparent-
ly wish to keep moves to improve relations with the United 
States as unobtrusive as possible.)

Instability in the Sudan  
espite Premier Abboud's repeated assurances to the 
peop that the Sudan's military government is stable and 
united, jockeying for power continues at the highest army 
levels, and the leaders of the suspended political parties 
are maneuvering to improve their positions. The junior 
officers' movement, led by Brigadier Abd al-Rahim Shan-
nan, has been holding nightly meetings since 24 March, 
and is plan-
ning an attempt to seize power by arresting most of the 
senior members of the Supreme Military Council. Briga-
dier Muhyi al-Din Abdullah, who participated with Shannan 
in leading the early March coup, is now being excluded from 
the group's secret .plans, apparently because he opposes fur-
ther drastic action. 
(The senior council members are acutely aware of the 
threat posed by Shannan's group, which reportedly contains 
pro-Communist and pro-Egyptian elements as well as other 
dissident officers; they are therefore attempting to build up 
a counter-movement within the army. They also have to con-
tend with political and religious leaders who want a n mber of 
military members of the cabinet replaced by civilians. 
he governmental changes since early March and the 
death on 24 March of Ansar leader Sayyid al-Rahman al-
Mandi have resulted in a sharp decrease in the power and 
influence of the Ansar sect and its Umma party, the strongest 
pro-Western elements in the country. The demands of leaders 
of the neutralist National Unionist party (NUP) that they 
be included in the Abboud government have so far been refused, 
but the senior officers in the government may resort to an !'al-
Hance" with NUP political leaders against the junior officers' 
movement.)

Israeli-Syrian Recalls oi Reserves  
'The USIB Watch Committee issued the following report 
afte a special meeting held at 1730, 1 April 1959: ) 
( An Israeli mobilization, announced at 1900 GMT 
on April, recalling "all" reserves to report for re-
serve duty was followed prior to 2100 GMT by a UAR 
order to personnel of the First (Syrian) Army to re-
turn from leave and to all reservists detailed to cer-
tain numbered formations to report to their units by 
the morning of 2 April. A later Israeli order ordered 
reserves of three units (probably brigades) to report 
by 1700, 2 April. By 2100, a spokesman of the Israeli 
Defense Forces described the call-up as a recall of 
certain reservists of only three reserve units for ord-
inary training and the Lsraeli finance minister, speak-
ing for the prime minister in the Knesset, declared 
that the order was only a routine call for training and 
that no importance was to be attached to it. The Israeli 
Embassy in Washington has also characterized this ac-
tion as "lt unusual," .olaserving that "the days of Suez 
are over." 
No preliminary mobilization measures, such as 
re isitioning of motor vehicles or rail rolling stock, 
have been observed or reported in Israel. The strength 
and deployment of Israeli military forces are believed 
to be normal. Recent incidents along Israel's borders 
have been minor and have not been treated as serious 
by the Israeli press, and the only specific source of 
tension between Israel and the UAR recently publicized 
has been the Egyptian seizure of cargoes of Israeli-
chartered ships. Israel is known, however, to be con-
cerned over a rapprochement between N sir and the US 
and possible UAR action against Qasim.

Staff, General Rustu Erdelhun, stated in response to an Irani-
an question that in time of war the Shah would "of course" 
become the commander in chief of Baghdad Pact forces. Any 
such decision, however, would require the approval of Britain 
and Pakistan. 
The Shah, pleased with the outcome of the talks and im-
pressed with Erdelhun's presentation, has ordered the chief of 
the Iranian General Staff to coordinate closely with Turkey on 
defense problems and on Baghdad Pact military organization. 
The Turks and Iranians also agreed that, to assure concerted 
action in an emergency, the Baghdad Pact Military Planning 
Organization should have a proper staff structure headed by an 
American officer. These issues probably will be raised for-
mally during the July meeting of the Baghdad Pact Military Com-
mittee, 
The Shah emphasized to Erdelhun his fear that Iran would 
be encircled by hostile powers now that Iraq is working with the 
Communists. Erdelhun, who is a highly competent officer and 
strong advocate of close Turkish-American military cooperation, 
attempted to calm the Shah by stressing that Turkey and Pakistan 
stand on Iran's flanks and that US power will deter aggression by 
the USSR. 
In respect to the Shah's continuing dissatisfaction with the 
level of American military'aid, General Erdelhun stressed that 
both Turkey and Iran must increase the literacy and technical 
competence of their service personnel before they can make ef-
fective use of modern weapons.
