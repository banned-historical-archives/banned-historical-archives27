Marxism-Leninism, has given a

strafing their indestructible po-
litical unity and unswerving 
loyalty to the ideas of Marx-
ism-Leninism, 
Bed Errors Conceded 
The fraternal Communist and 
Worker parties also discerned 
this maneuver of the enemies 
? of socialism in time and are 
giving it the rebuff it deserves. 
x.At the same time it would be 
wrong to close one's eyes to 
the fact that certain of our 
friends abroad have not got to 
-the bottom of the question of 
. the personality cult and its 
consequences and are toler-
ating at times a wrong in-
terpretation of certain of its 
aspects. 
In its criticism of the person-
ality cult the party proceeds 
from the principles of Marx-
ism-Leninism, Already for more 
than three years our party has 
been waging a consistent 
struggle against the person-
ality cult of J. V. Stalin, firmly 
overcoming its evil conse-
quences. 
Naturally, this question occu-
pied an important place in the 
work of the Twentieth Con-
gress and its decisions. The 
congress noted that the Cen-
tral Committee, quite rightly 
and timely, came out against 
the personality cult, the spread 
of which belittled the role of 
? the party and the popular 
masses, lowered the role of col-
lective leadership in the party 
and frequently brought about 
grave omissions In work and 
gross violations of socialist 
laws. The congress empowered 
the Central Committee to carry 
out consistent measures to en-
sure the complete elimination 
of the personality cult, so alien 
to Marxism-Leninism; to ligtii-
date its ConsequencesIn all 
spheres of party, state 'and 
ideological work, and to imple-
ment strictly the norms of 
party life and the principles of 
the collectivity of party leader-
ship laid down by the great 
Lenin. 
In the struggle against the 
cult of personality the party 
leadership is guided by the 
]i flown tenet of Marxism-Len-
inism on the roles of the popu-
lar masses, party and indi-
vidual personalities in history, 
on the inadmissibility of the 
personality cult of a political 
leader, however great his 
merits. 
The founder of scientific corn-
11114111S111, Karl Marx, stressing 
his dislike of "any personality 
cult," used to say that he and 
Friedrich Engels joined the 
League of Communists ''on con-
dition that everything contrib-
uting to the superalitious wor-
ship of authorities be thrown 
out of the Charter." 
in founding oup Communist 
party, Vi, Lenin fought mr-
remittingly against the anti-
Marxist conception of the 
"hero" aod the "crowd" and 
resolutely condemned the prac-
tice of setting the individual 
hero over the popular masses. 
"The wisdom of tens of mil-
lions of creators," V. I. Lenin 
used to say, "creates some-
thing immeasurably higher than 
the greatest foresight of 
genius." 
? Cult Found Obstacle 
In putting forward the ques-
tion of the struggle against the 
personality cult of J. V. Stalin, 
the Central Committee proceed-
ed from the fact that the per-
sonality cult contradicts the 
nature of Socialist order and 
became an obstacle on the way 
to the development of Soviet 
democracy and the advance-
ment of the Socialist society to-
ward communism. 
The twentieth party congress, 
on the initiative of the Central 
Committee, ,deemed it neces-
sary to 'speak out courageously 
and frankly abstit the grave 
consequences of the personality 
cult and the serious errors tol-
erated during the latter period 
of Stalin's life, and to call upon 
the entire party to make a 
joint effort to put an end to 
everything the personality cult 
entailed. At the same time the 
Central Committee was fully 
aware that the frank admission 
of errors tolerated would be 
linked to certain shortcomings 
and losses which might be ex-
ploited by enemies. The coura-
geous self-criticism in the ques-
tion of the personality cult was 
a now and brilliant proof of the 
force and strength of our party 
and of the Soviet Socialist 
regime, One can say with as-
surance that not a single one 
of time ruling parties of the 
capitalist countries would ever 
have risked taking a similar 
step. On the contrary, they 
would have tried to conceal 
'such unpleasant facts front the 
people and pass over in silence 
such unpleasant facts. 
But the Soviet Communist 
party, brought up on the revo-
lutionary principles of Marx-
ism-Leninism, told the whole 
truth, no matter how bitter. 
Tho party resolved to take' this 
step exclusively on its own 
initiative, being guided by the 
consideration that if the stand ' 
taken against the cult of Stalin 
caused some temporary dif-
ficulties, it would still, from 
the point of view of the vital 
interests and' ultimate aims of 
the working class, have a vast 
positive result. This creates 
firm guarantees that in the fit-
-fit?re phenomena similar to the 
personality cult can never ap-
pear in our party and our coun-
try and that in the future the 
leadership of the party and the 
, country will be carried out col-
lectively on the basis of a 
1 Marxist -Leronist policy and 
wide inner party democracy, 
with the active creative partic-
ipation of millions of workers. 
Having taken a resolute stand 
against the personality cult and 
its consequences, having open-
ly subjected to criticism the 
' mistakes to which it gave rise, 
the party has demonstrated 
once more its devotion to the 
immortal principles of Marx-
ism-Leninism and the interests 
of the people, its solicitude for 
creating the best conditions for 
the development of the party 
and Soviet democracy in the 
interests of successful Commu-
nist construction in our coun-
? try. 
The Central Committee notes 
that the discussion in party 
organizations and at general 
meetings of workers of the 
question of the personality cult 
and its consequences took place 
amid great activity of party 
members and nonparty men, 
that the Central Committee 
line found full approval and 
support among the party and 
people. 
The publicizing by the party 
of the facts of the violation of 
Socialist law and other errors 
connected with the personality 
cult of J, V. Stalin naturally 
cause feelings of bitterness and 
profound regret. But the Soviet 
people understand that the eon-
domination of the personality 
cult was necessary in tile inter-
ests of the construction of com-
munism, whose active partic-
ipants they are. The Soviet 
people sees that the party has 
In recent years insistently car-
sled out practical measures 
aimed at removing the con-
sequences of the personality 
cult in all spheres of party, 
state, economic and cultural 
construction. As a result of this 
work the Party, whose internal 
forces are no longer fettered, 
has come still closer to the 
people and is now in a state of 
unprecedented creative activ-
ity. 
II 
How could the personality 
cult of Stalin, with all its nega-
tive consequences, arise and 
acquire such currency under 
the conditions of a Soviet So-
cialist regime? 
When examining this question 
, one must bear in mind both the 
objective and concrete condi-
tions in which the building of 
socialism in the U. S. 8.1R. 
took place, as well as some 
subjective factors connected 
with the personal quantities of 
Stalin. 
The October Socialist Revo-
1 lution entered history as a clas ! 
sic eexa.mple or the revolution- , 
soar transformation of capital- ? 
ist society, carried out under . 
the leadership of the working ' 
class. By the example of the 
heroic struggle of the Bolshe-
vik party, the first Socialist 
state in the world, Communist 
parties in other countries and 
all progressive and democratic+ 
forces are learning the experi-
ence of solving the vital social 
1--questions arising from present-
day social development. 
,? In the course of almost forty 
' years, the building of a Social-
ist society of workers of our 
country, vast experience has 
1 been accumulated which is be-
. hag creatively studied and ?as-
, similated by workers of other 
Socialist states, in accordance 
: with their concrete conditions, 
' This was the first experience 
I. in history of building a Social-
ist society which was formed 
i in the process, the test in prac-
tice of many truths thitherto 
' only known to Socialists in 
general outline and theory. For 
more than a quarter of a cen-
tury, the Soviet land was the 
only country which paved for 
mankind the way to socialism. 
It was like a besieged fortress 
situated in a capitalist encircle-
ment, After the abortive inter-
vention of fourteen states in 
19181922, the enemies of the 
Soviet country In the West 
, 
and East continued to prepare 
new "crusades" against the 
It, S. S. It, 
Enemies sent Into the 
U.. S. S. H. a large number 
of spies and divereionists who 
tried in every way to under-
mine the first Socialist state in 
the world. The threat of a new 
imperialist aggression against 
the U. S. S. H. became partic-
ularly 'intense after the advent 
to power of fascism in Ger-
many in 1933, which proclaimed 
as its ain't the destruction of 
conummism, the destruction of 
the Soviet Union, ? the first 
weakers' state in the world. Ev-
eryone remembers the forma-
tion of the so-called anti-Com-
inthrn pact and the 'Berlin-
Rome-Tokyo axis, which were 
actively supported by the forces 
of all international reaction. In 
an atmosphere of a growing 
threat of war, the rejection by 
the Western powers of the 
measures to curb :faecism and 
organize collective security re-
peatedly proposed by the So-
viet Union, the sta to was com-
pelled to strain every nerve to 
strengthen defeeisie and strug-
gle against the intrigues of the 
harmful 'capitalist encircle- , 
ment. The party had to train 
the whole people in a Rpiiit of 
constant vigilance and readi-
ness in the face of foreign 
enemies, . 
Early Struggle :Related 
Tile intrigues of international 
reaction were all the snore dan-
gerous because for a long time 
an 'embittered class struggle 
had been going in the country

decided. After the death of 
Lenin, hostile trends became 
active in the party, Trotskyites, 
right-wing opportunists and 
bourgeois nationalists whose 
position was a rejection of 
Lenin's theory on the posaibil-
ity of the victory of Socialism 
In one country. 
This would actually have led 
to the restoration of capitalism 
in the U.S.S.R. The party un-
leashed a merciless struggle 
against these enemies of Lenin-
ism. 
Fulfilling Lenin's behests, the 
Communist party set a course 
towards the Socialist industrial-
ization of the .country, the col-
lectivization of agriculture and 
the realization of a cultural 
revolution. 
In the course of solving these 
majestic tasks of building a 
Socialist society in one sepa-
rate country, the Soviet people 
and the Communist party had 
to overcome unimaginable dif-
ficulties and obstacles. In the 
shortest space of time, our 
country, without any economic 
help whatsoever from abroad, 
had to liquidate ,its centuries-
old backwardness and reshape 
the entire national economy on 
new Socialist foundations. 
This complicated national and? 
international situation demand-
ed iron discipline, evergrowing 
vigilance and a most strict 
centralization of leadership 
which inevitably had a negative 
effect on the development of 
certain democratic features. 
In the course of a fierce 
struggle against the whple 
world of imperialism, our 
country had to submit to cer-
tain rentrictions of democracy, 
justified by the logic of the 
etruggle of our people for so-
cialism in circumstances of 
capitalist encirclement. But 
these restrictions, were already 
at that time regarded by the 
party and people as temporary, 
subject to removal as the So-
viet state grew stronger and 
the forces of democracy and 
:socialism developed throughout 
the world, The people de-
liberately accepted these tem-
porary sacrifices in view of 
the ever-new successes daily 
achieved by the Soviet social 
order. 
All these difficulties on the 
path of building socialism were 
overcome by the Soviet people 
under the leadership of the 
Communist party and its 
Central Committee, which:con-
sistently carried out Lenin's 
general line. 
? The victory socialism in 
our country in conditions of 
enemy encirclement and a con-
stant threat of attack from out-
side was a world-historic deed 
pn the part of the Soviet peo-
ple, Miring the first five-year 
plans, as a result of intense 
and heroic efforts by the people 
and party, our economically 
backward country made a 
gigantic leap in its economic 
and. cultural development. On 
the basis of the successes in 
Socialist construction the living 
standards of the workers were 
raised and unemployment was 
liquidated for good, The pro-
foundest cultural revolution 
took place in the country. 
In a short space of time the 
Soviet people reared numerous 
cadres of a technical intelli-
gentsia, which took its place on 
the level of world technical 
progress and put Soviet science 
and technology among the first 
in the world. The inspirer and 
organizer of these victories was 
the great party of Communists. 
On the example of the U.S.S.R., 
workers and peasants who had 
taken power into their own 
hands could successfully build 
and ? develop their Socialist 
state without capitalists and 
land-owners, expressing alsd 
defending the interests of wide 
people's masses. All this played 
a great inspiring role in the 
growth and influence of Com-
munist and Workers parties in 
all countries of the world. 
`Devoted to Marxlsrn-Leninism' 
Holding the position of Gen-
eral Secretary, of the Central 
Comnaittee of the party for o. 
lengthy period, S. V. Stalin, 
together with other leaders, 
actively struggled for the reali-
zation of Lenin's behests. He 
was devoted to Marxism-Lenin-
ism, and as a theoretician and 
good organizer headed the 
struggle of the party against 
the Trotskyites, right-wing op-
portunists and bourgeois na-
tionalists and against the in-
trigues of capitalist encircle-
ment. 
In this political and ideologi-
cal struggle Stalin acquired 
great authority and popularity. 
However, all our great victo-
ries began to be incorrectly 
connected with his Larne. The 
successes attained Ly the Com-
munist party and the Soviet 
country and the adulation of ; 
Stalin went to his head. In I 
this atmosphere the cult of Sta-
lin's personality began gradu-
ally to take shape. 
The development of the per-
sonality. cult was to an enor-
mous extent contributed to by 
some individual traits of J. V. ? 
Stalin, whose negative char-
acter was already pointed out 
by V. I. Lenin. At the end of 
1022 Lenin sent a letter to the 
current party congress, in 
which he said: 
"Comrade Stalin, by becom-
ing General Secretary, has con-
centrated vast power in his 
hands. I am not certain that 
he will always be able to use 
this power sufficiently careful-
In a postscript to this letter 
written at the beginning of 
January, 1923, V. I. Lenin 
reverted to the question of 
some personal traits of Stalin 
Intolerable in a leader. 
"Stalin is too rude," wrote 
Lenin, "and this shortcoming 
which is quite tolerable in our 
midst and among us Commu-
nists, becomes intolerable in the 
office of the General Secretary. 
I therefore invite the comrades 
to think of a way of removing 
Stalin from this post and ap-
pointing to the post another 
person who in all other respects 
differs from Comrade Stalin?
to wit, is more tolerant, more 
, loyal, more polite, more atten-
tive toward comrades and less 
I capricious." 
i At the thirteenth party can-
' gress, which was held soon 
? after V. I. Lenin's death, his 
letters were made known to 
the delegates. As .a result of 
the discussion of these docu-
ments it was recognized as ex-
pedient to leave Stalin at his 
post as Secretary General, on 
condition, however, that he 
took Lenin's criticism Into 
consideration and drew all the 
, necessary conclusions, 
; Having remained at the post 
? as ,General Secretary, Stalin, in 
the first period after Vladimir 
Ilyich's death, took into ac-
count his critical remarks. 
Later on, however, Stalin, hav-
ing excessively overrated his 
merits, believed in, his own 
Infallibility. 
Plenary sessions of the Cen-
tral Committee and congresses 
of the party were held irregu-
larly, and later they were not 
convened for many ,years. In 
fact, Stalin found himself out-
side criticism. 
Great harm to the cause of 
Socialist construction and the 
development of democracy in-
side the party and the state 
was inflicted by Stalin's er-
roneous formula. that as the 
Soviet Union moved toward 
socialism the class struggle 
would/ allegedly become more 
and more acute. This formula, 
which is only correct for cer-
tain stages of the transition 
period, when the question of 
"Who will beat whom?" is be-
ing solved, when a persistent 
class struggle for the building 
of the foundations of socialism 
was in progress, was put for-
ward into the first plan in 
1937 at a moment when social-
ism had already triumphed in 
our country and the exploiting 
classes and their economic base 
had been liquidated. 
Berla's Role Related 
In practice, this erroneous 
theoretical formula was the 
basis for the grossest violations 
of Socialist law and mass re-
pressions? . 
It was in these circum-
stances that special conditions 
were created in particular for 
the state security organs, in 
1 
, whom enormous confidence re; 
:! posed as a result of their MA 
dubitable services to the peck, 
' Ole and country in the defense 
of the conquests of the revolu-
tion. For a considerable period 
of time the state security or-
gans justified this confidence 
and their special position did 
not cause any danger. The 
, situation changed when the 
: control of them by the party 
and Government was gradual-
ly replaced by the personal con-
trol of Stalin and the normal 
administration of justic was 
often superseded by his per-
sonal decisions. 
The situation became even 
more complicated when the 
criminal band of the agent 
of international imperialism, 
[Lavrenti P.1 Berle, was put 
at the head of the state se-
curity organs. Serious viola- . 
tions of Soviet law and mass 
repressions occurred. As a re- . 
suit of enemy machinations, . 
many honest Commonists and 
Soviet non-party men were 
; slandered and suffered inno-
cently. 
The twentieth party congress 
and the entire policy of , the 
' Central Committee after the 
death of Stalin bear vivid tes-
timony to the fact that within 
the Central Committee of the 
party a Leninist core of leaders 
had come into being who cor-
rectly understood pressing re-
quirements in the sphere both 
Of internal and external policy, 
It cannot be said that there 
was no counter-action against 
- the negative manifestations 
which were connected with the 
personality cult and put a 
brake on the advance of 
socialism. 
Moreover, there were certain 
periods, for instance during the 
war years, when the individual 
acts of Stalin were sharply 
restricted, when the negative 
consequences of lawlessness 
and arbitrariness were substan-
tially diminished. 
It is known that precisely 
during this very war period 
members of the Central Com-
mittee and also outstanding 
Soviet war commanders took 
over certain sectors of activity 
in the rear and at the front, 
made independent decisions, - 
and through their organiza-
tional, political, economio and 
military work, together with 
local party and Soviet organi-
zations, insured the victory of 
the ? Soviet people in the war. 
After victory the negative con-
sequences of the cult of per-
sonality re-emerged with great 
force. 
Action Said to Be Barred 
The Leninist core of the Cen-
tral Committee immediately 
after the death of Stalin set a 
course of resolute struggle 
against the personality cult 
and its grave consequences.

(it Might be asked why these 
people did not take an open 
stand against Stalin and re-
move him from the leadership? 
this could not he done In 
the circumstances Which had 
arisen. 
Facts undoubtedly bear out 
that Stalin was guilty of many 
lawless deeds, particularly in 
the later period of his life. It 
should not be forgotten, how-
ever, that the Soviet people 
knew Stalin as a person who 
always acted in defense of the 
U. S. S. R. against the In-
trigues of the enemies and 
struggles for the cause of so-
cialism. At times be applied 
' in this struggle unworthy 
methods and violated the Len-
-inlet principles of party life. 
Therein lay the tragedy of 
Stalin. 
But all this made the strug-
gle against the lawless deeds 
perpetrated at the time more 
difficult, since the success of 
Socialist construction and the 
consolidation of the U. S. S. R. 
were attributed to Stalin. Any , 
action against him in those 
conditions would not have been 
understood by the people, and 
this does not mean there was 
a lack of personal courage in-
volved. It is obvious that any-
one who had acted in that sit-
uation against Stalin would not 
have received support from the 
people, Moreover, such a stand 
would in those conditions have 
been regarded as ? a stand 
against the cause of Socialist 
construction and a blow against 
the unity of the party and the 
whole state, extremely danger-
ous in the presence of capitalist 
encirclement. 
In addition, the successes 
which the working people of 
the Soviet Union attained un-
der the leadership of their 
Communist party aroused jus-
tifiable pride in the heart of 
every Soviet person and created 
an atmosphere in which indi-
vidual mistakes and shortcom-
ings seemed less important 
against the background of 
enormous successes, while the 
negative consequences of these 
mistakes were quickly made 
good by the colossal growth of 
the vital forces of the party 
and Soviet society. , 
One should also bear in mind 
that many facts and wrong ac-
tions of Stalin, especially as 
regards the violation of Soviet 
became known only in 
recent times, after his death, 
mainly in connection with the 
expesure of the Berle, gang and 
the establishment of party con-
trol over the organs of state 
security. 
Such are the main conditions 
and causes which resulted in 
the emergence and currency of 
the personality cult of J. V. 
Stalin. Obviously, everything 
that has been said explains, 
I but in no way justifies, the I 
Stalin cult and its conse-
quences, which have been so 
sharply and justly condemned 
by our party. " 
III 
Indisputably the personality 
cult has inflicted serious harm 
on the cause of the Commu-
nist party and Soviet society. 
It would, however, be a 
serious mistake to deduce front 
the past existence of the cult 
of personality seine kind of 
changes in the social order in 
the U. S. S. R. or to look for 
the source of this cult in the 
nature of the Soviet social 
order. Both alternatives are 
absolutely wrong, as they do 
not accord with reality and 
conflict with the facts. 
In spite of all the evil which 
the persoanlit3i cult of Stalin 
has done to the party and 
the poeple ,it could not change 
and has not changed the na-
ture of the social order. 
Even Stalin was not big 
enough to change the state. 
No personality cult could 
change the nature of .the .So-
cialist state, based on pub-
lic ownership of the means 
of production, the union of 
the working class and peas." 
antry, and the friendship of 
peoples, although this cult did 
inflict serious damage on the 
development of Socialist dem-
ocratism and the upsurge' of 
the creative initiative of the 
millions. 
To imagine that an individ-
ual personality, even such a 
large one as Stalin, could 
change our politico-social or-
der means to enter into pro-
found contradiction with the 
facts, with Marxism and with 
truth and to give way to ideal-
ism. This would mean to at-
tribute to an individual per- , 
sonality *Such excessive and su-
pernatural powers as an abil-
ity to change the order of a 
society and a social order in 
which the many-million strong 
masses of working people axe 
the decisive force. 
As it is known, the nature of 
the social-political regime is 
determined by the nature of 
the means of production, to 
who:MI the means of production 
belong and in the hands of 
what class, political authority 
is vested. The whole world 
knows that in our country, as 
a re i ult of the October Revolu-
tion and the, victory of social-
ism, the Socialist means of 
production have been consoli-
dated and that for nearly forty 
been in the hands of the 
working class and peasantry. 
Thanks to this, the Soviet 
social regime is gaining in 
strength from year to year and, 
Its productive forces are grows 
Ing. This is a fact which even 
our ill-wishers cannot fail to 
admit. 
The consequences of the per-
sonality cult were, ea is known, 
certain serious mistakes in the 
leadership of various branches 
of the party and Soviet state, 
both in the internal life of the 
Soviet country and in its for-
eign policy. One can, in parti-
cular. point to serious short-
comings countenanced by Stalin 
in the direction of agriculture, 
in organizing the country's pre-
paredness to repel the Fascist 
invaders, and in the gross ar-
bitrariness which led to a con-
flict with Yugoslavia of indi-
vidual sides of the Soviet state's 
life, particularly in the last 
years of I. V. Stalin's life, in 
the development of Soviet so-
ciety. But, it goes without say-
ing, they did not divert it from 
the correct road towards com-
munism. 
Our enemies assert that the 
personality cult of Stalin was 
. not engendered by finite his-
torical conditions which have 
already sunk into the past but 
by the Soviet system itself, by 
what they consider to he its 
link to democratism and so on. 
Such slanderous assertions are 
refuted by the entire history of 
the development of the Soviet 
state. The Soviet as a new 
democratic form of state au-
thority arose as a result of the 
creative revolutionary activity 
of the broadest popular muses 
who had risen to the struggle 
for freedom. They were and re-
main organs of genuine popular 
authority. It is precisely the 
Soviet regime which created 
the possibility of discerning the 
immense creative energies of 
the people. 
World War H Test Cited 
It set in motion inexhausti-
ble forces inherent in the Popu-
lar masses, drew millions of 
people towards conscious dire, 
tion of the state, into creative 
participation in the construe-
tion of socialism. In a histori-
cally short space of time the 
Soviet state came out victorious 
from the most difficult of tests 
and passed its baptism of fire 
in the World War II, 
When the last exploiting 
classes were liquidated in our 
country, when socialism became 
the dominant eyetem in' the 
entire natienal economy, while 
the international situation of 
our country had radically 
changed, the scope of Soviet 
democracy has been incalcu-
lably expanding and is conti-
nuing to do so. 
Unlike any kind of bourgeois 
democracies, Soviet democracy 
not only proclaims the right of 
all members of Soviet society, 
without exception, to work, 
education and leisure, partici-
pation In state affairs, freedom 
of speech and of the Mess, 
freedom of consciousness and 
also a real possibility for the 
free development of personal 
abilities and other democratic 
rights and freedoms, but also 
insures them materially. 
The essence of democtacy 
lies not in formal indications 
but in whether. the political 
authority services and reflects 
in act on the Will and basic 
interests of the Majority of the 
people and workers, The entire 
internal and foreign policy of 
the Soviet state proclaims the 
fact that our regime is a truly 
democratic ?popular' regime. 
The highest aim of the Soviet 
state is to raise the popula-
tion's living standards in every 
respect and secure a peaceful 
existence for its people. 
A testimony to the further 
development of Soviet democ-
racy are the measures, which 
are being put 'through fur the 
party and government for ex-
tending the rights and compe-
tence of union republics, the 
strict adherence to law and re-
organization of the system of 
planning with the aim of fos-
tering local initiative, activa-
ting work in local soviets and 
developing' criticism and self-
criticism. 
In spite and regarillesS of the 
personality cult,. the mighty 
Initiative of the Popular masses 
led by the Communist party 
and engendered by our regime 
has performed its great histori4 
cal task, overcoming all bar-
riers on the way to the con-
struction of socialism, And in - 
this the democratic nature or 
the Soviet regime finds its 
highest expression. The out-
standing victories of socialism 
in our country did not come of 
themselves. They were gained 
thanks to the tremendous or-
ganizational and educational 
work of the party and its local 
bodies, thanks to the fact that 
the party has always brought 
up its cadres and all Commu-
nists in a spirit: of loyalty to 
marxiem and leninism, in a 
spirt of devotion to the cause 
of communism. 
The Soviet society is strong 
through an awareness of the 
masses. Its historic destinies 
were determined' and are still 
being determined by the crea-
tive labors of our historic work-
Ing class, our -glorious collec-
tive farm peasantry nod pupa.

For liquidating the conse-
quences of the personality cult. 
for restoring Bolshevik norms 
of the party life and by deploy-
ing Socialist democracy, our 
party achieved a farther 
strengthening of its ties with 
broad masses, rallied them still 
closer under the great Lenin-
ist banner

The fact that the party itself 
boldly and openly posed the 
question of liquidating the per-
sonality ? cult, the question of 
inadmissible mistakes made by 
Stalin, is a convincing testi-
mony that our party firmly 
stands on guard for Leninism, 
the cause of socialism and com-
munism, the maintenance of 
Socialist law and interests of 
the people, and the safeguard-
ing of the rights of Soviet citi-
zens. ThiS is the hest proof of 
the force and viability of the 
Soviet Socialist regime. It 
speaks at the same time for 
the determination to eradicate 
to the end the consequences of 
the personality cult and not al-
low mistakes of such a nature 
to be repeated hi the future. 
The condemnation by our 
party of the personality cult of 
? Stalin- and its consequences 
evoked the approval and wide 
response of all brotherly Com-
munist and Workers' parties. 
Noting the significance of the 
Twentieth Party Congress to 
the entire international Com-
munist and workers' move-
ment, the Communists of for-
eign countries regard the strug-
gle against the personality cult 
? and its consequences as a strug-
gle for the purity of Marxist 
and Leninist ,principles,. for a 
creative approach to the solu-
tion of contemporary problems 
of the international workers' 
movement, for its firmation 
and further development of 
principles of proletarian inter-
nationalism. 
In statements of a number of 
brotherly Communist parties, 
approval and support is ex-
pressed for the measures 
against the personality cult 
carried out by our party. The 
organ of the Central- Commit-
tee of the Chinese Communist 
Intrt5:', the People's Daily,' de-
scribing the conchisions reach-
ed and discussing the decisions 
of the Twentieth Party Govern-
ment held by the Politburo of 
the Chinese Communist party, 
says in an editorial entitled 
?'''historic experience of dicta-
torship? of proletariat: . 
"The Communist party of the 
Soviet Union, following Lenin's 
- behests, deals seriously with 
some grave errors countenanced 
? y Stalin in directing Socialist 
construction and the conse-
quences they have provoked. 
'Because of the gravity Of these 
.consequences, the Soviet party 
was faced with the need, while 
admitting the great services of 
V. Stalin, to reveal with all 
'urgency the essence of the 'rills 
.-
takes Stalin allowed to occur 
and to urge the entire party to 
beware of a repetition of this, 
and to urge it resolutely to 
eradicate the consequences en-
gendered by these shortcom-
ings." 
Chinese Bed Backing Quoted 
"The Communists of China 
profoundly believe that after 
sharp criticism developed at 
the Twentieth Congress, all ac-
tive factors which were se-
verely restricted in the past 
because of certain political mis-
takes will indubitably be set in 
motion everywhe're, that the 
Communist party of the.Sovict 
-.Union and the ? Soviet people 
will be united as never before 
in the struggle to build a great 
Communist society as never 
before seen in history, in a 
struggle for a stable peace 
throughout the world." . 
"The merit of the leaders of 
the Soviet Communist party," 
reads a Statement by the Polit-
buro of the French Communist 
party, "lies in their having un-
dertaken to correct the mis-
takes and shortcomings con-
nected with the personality 
cult, a fact that testifies to the 
'force and Unity of the. great 
party of Lenin, to the confi-
dence which it enjoys among 
the Soviet people, and swells 
Its authority among the inter-
national workers' movement.'' 
The general secretary of the 
National .Committee of the 
United States Communist party, 
Eugene. Dennis, noting the tre-
mendous significance of the 
twentieth congress, states in 
his well known article: "The 
twentieth congress strength-
ened universal peace and social ; 
progress. It marked a new 
statge in the development of ? 
socialism . and in the struggle ? 
for peaceful coexistence which 
started in -the time of Lenin, 
was pursued in subsequent year 
and is becoming more and more 
effective and successful,'' 
At the same time it should be 
noted that when discussing the 
question of. the personality cult 
a' correct interpretation of thq ? 
reasons which engendered it 
has not always been given. For 
instance, a substantial and in-
teresting interview given by 
Comrade [Palmiro] Togliatti 
[Italian Communist leader] -to 
the magazine Nuovi Argumenti 
contains, alongside many of the 
most important and ecirrect de-
ductions, also some incorrect 
ones. One cannot, in Particular, 
agree With Comrade 'Togliatti 
when he asks whether Soviet 1 
society has not reached. "cer-
tain forms of degeneration?"? ' 
There are no foundations for 
such a question. It is .all the 
more incomprehensible because 
In another part of his interview 
Comrade Togliatti says quite 
correctly: "It mtiSt be deduced 
that the essence of the Socialist 
regime was not lost, since none 
of the preceding gains were 
lost, nor did the regime, lose 
support of the working masses 
of workers, peasants and Intel- . 
lectuals who form Soviet soci-
ety. This support proves in it-
self that, in spite of everything,. 
society retained its main demo-
cratic character." ' 
And indeed without the sup-
port of the broadest popular 
masses of the Soviet regime 
for the policy of the Commu-
nist party, our' country would 
not have been able to create 
in an unprecedentedly short 
space of time a powerful So-
cialist industry or to carry out 
collectivization of agriculture 
and it would have been unable 
to gain a victory in the World 
War II, on whose outcome the 
fate of all mankind rested, 
As a result of the complete 
route of Hitlerism, Italian 
fascism and Japanese mints. 
risrn, the forces of the Com-
munist movement extensively 
developed, grew in scope and , 
became mass Communist par- . 
ties in Italy, France and other 
capitalist countries. People's 
democracies were established 
In a number of countries of 
Europe and Asia, a world sys-
tem of socialism arose and was 
consolidated, and the national 
liberation movement which led 
to the disintegration of the col-
onial system attained unprece-
dented successes. 
Br 
The Soviet party congress, 
unanimously approving the de-
cisions of the party, which con-
demned the personality cult, 
the Communists and all Soviet 
people see in them a proof of 
the increased force of our party, 
Its Leninist adherence to prin-
ciples, its unity and integra-
tion. "A party of the revolu-
tionary proletariat," V. I. Lenin 
said, "Is sufficiently strong to 
criticize itself openly, to call 
mistakes and weaknesses by 
the[r right names," Guided by 
this principle of Lenin's, our 
'prtrty will continue to disclose 
boldly, to criticize openly and 
,,to remove resolutely the miss 
takes and blunders in its work.' 
The Central Committee con-
siders that work accomplished 
up to now by the party on the 
elimination of the personality 
cult and its consequences al-
ready have given positive re-
sults, 
Proceeding from the decisions 
of the Twentieth Party Con-

tries following the road to 
socialism contribute to a great 
extent to the successful solu-
tion of these problems. 
Under new historic condi-
tions, such international work-
ing class organizations as the 
Comintern and Cominform 
ceased their activities. It does 
not follow from this that in-
ternational solidarity and the 
need of contacts between rev-
olutionary and brotherly par-
ties which adopted the positions 
of Marxism-Leninism have lost 
significance. 
At the present time, when 
forces of socialism and the in-
fluence of the ideas of social-
ism have grown immeasurably 
throughout the whole world, 
when individual ways toward 
socialism are becoming appar-
ent in various countries, Marx-
ist parties and the working 
class must naturally retain and. 
strengthen ideological unity of 
International brotherly solidari-
ty in the struggle against the 
threat of a new war and in the 
struggle Against the unpopular 
forces of monopoly and capital, 
Which are striving to suppress 
all revolutionary progressive 
movements. 
Communist parties are united 
by the great aim of liberating 
the working class from the opt. 
pression of capital. They are 
united into one by loyalty to 
' the scientifio ideology of Marx-
ism-Leninism, by the spirit of 
proletarian internationalism, 
and boundless devotion to the 
Interests of the popular masses. 
In their activity under con-
temporary conditions the Com-
munist parties proceed from 
the national peculiarities in the 
conditions of every country, 
and are expressing with the 
greatest fullness the national 
interests of their peoples. At 
the same time, realizing that 
the struggle for ? the interests 
of the working class, for peace 
and national 'independence of 
their countries, is a matter of 
the whole international pro-
letariat, they rally together and 
strengthen their ties and coop-
eration among themselves. 
The ?ideological unanimity 
.and bOtherly solidarity of , 
Marxist -parties of the work-1 
'Mg class of various countries 
is all the more necessary "be-
cause capitsllist monopolies. are . 
creating their own internation-
al unions arid' blocs '4 
similar' to' NATO, SEATO and 
"She Baghdad Pact, itimad 
against peace-loving nations, 
against the national-liberation 
movement, against the working 
class, and the vital interests 
of the toilers. 
While the Soviet Union has 
done much and is continuing 
to do much for the reduction 
of international tension?and 
this is acknowledged now by 
everybody ?American monopo-
list capital at the same time 
continues appropriating large 
sums for intensifying subver-
sive activity in the Socialist 
countries. At the height of the 
"cold war," as it is known, 
the American Congress- of
(in addition to funds 
being spent unofficially) allo-
cated $100,000,000 for the pur-
poses of subversive activity in 
the countries of people's de-
mocracy and the Soviet Union. 
Now, when the Soviet Union 
and other Socialist countries 
are doing. everything possible 
to reduce international tension, 
the adherents of the "cold 
war" are trying to activize the 
"cold war,", which is con-
demned by the peoples of the 
whole world. This is shown by 
the decision of the American 
Senate on an additional appro.' 
priation of $25,000,000 for sub-
versive activity, which is 'cyn-
ically being called "an encour-
agement of freedom beyond the 
Iron Curtain." 
We must soberly appraise 
this fact and thaw relevant de-
ductions' from it. It is clear, 
for instance, that the anti-peo-
ple's demonstrations in Poznan 
were paid from this source. 
However, the provocateurs and 
the diversionists, who were paid 
from the overseas funds, had 
only enough courage for a few 
hours. 
The workers of Poznan re-
btiffed the enemies' sallies and 
provocations. The plans of the 
dark gentry of the "cloak and 
dagger" failed. So did their 
foul provocation against the 
people's authority in Poland. 
Subversive activities in the 
People's Democracies will also 
continue to fail in the future, 
although such actions are gen-
erously paid for from monies 
appropriated by American mo-
nopolists. One can say that 
this money is being spent for 
nothing. 
Careless Attitude Opposed 
All this demonstrates that 
one must not show a careless. 
attitude 'toward the new ma-
chinations ? of the imperialist 
agents, who are trying to pene-
trate iuto Socialist countries 
for the purpose of undermining 
the achievements of the work-
ers. The forces of imperialist 
reaction are attempting to di-
vert the workers from the cor-
rect path of the struggle for 
their interests, to poison their 
souls with lack of confidence in 
the success of the cause of so-
cialism. 
Contrary to all the machina-
tions of the ideologists of the 
capitalist monopoly, the work-
ing class, led by the experi-
enced Communist vanguard, 
which march on its road, which 
has led to the historic achieve-
ments of socialism, and -will 
lead to new victories of the 
cause of peace, democracy and 
socialism. One can be confi-
dent that the Communist and 
workers parties of all coun-
tries will raise their glorious 
Marxist banner of proletarian 
internationalism even higher. 
The Soviet people are justly 
proud that Our Motherland 
was the first to chart the path 
to gocialism. Now, when social-
ism has become a world sys-
tem, when brotherly coopera-
tion and mutual assistance 
have been established between 
Socialist countries, new favor-
able conditions have developed 
for the flourishing of Socialist 
democracy, for the further con-
solidation of the material-pro-
duction base of communism, 
the steadfast upsurge of the 
standard of living of the work-
ers, for all round development 
of the personality of a new 
man?builder of the Communist 
society. 
Let the bourgeois ideologists 
concoct fables about "crises" 
of communism, and about 
"confusion" in the ranks of 
the Communist party. We are 
used to hearing such incanta-
tions by the enemies. Their 
forecasts always burst like 
soap bubbles. Luckless fore-
casters like these have come 
and gone but the Communist 
movement, the immortal and 
life-giving ideas of Marxism-
Leninism triumphed and are 
continuing to triumph. This 
will also be the case in the 
future. No foul, slanderous at-
tacks of our enemies can stop 
the irresistable trend of his-
torical development of man-
kind toward communism.

Pravda, 3 July (as broadcast by radio) 
Pravda has published the decision of the Central Com-
mittee of the CPSU On Overcoming the Personality Cult and 
Its Consequences." This document, which is of great politi-
cal theoretical significance, gives a vivid picture of the 
mighty upsurge of creative initiative and revolutionary 
energy which has been evoked by the historic decisions of 
the 20th CPSU Congress in the ranks of our Party and all 
of the Soviet people, in the ranks of the fraternal Commu-
nist and workers parties. 
On the basis of a Marxist-Leninist analysis of the 
most important phenomena of international and internal life 
and the activity of the Party in the present epoch, in this 
decision the CPSU Central Committee gives clear answers to 
the problems presented by life and directs the efforts of 
the Party and the people toward the solution of the most 
important problems set forth by the 20th CPSU Congress. 
The Central Committee of the CPSU notes with satisfac-
tion, the decision states, that the decisions of the his-
toric 20th CPSU Congress have met with the full approval 
and ardent support of the whole of our Party, all of our 
people, the fraternal Communist and workers parties, the 
working people of the great commonwealth of Socialist coun-
tries, and millions of people in capitalist and colonial 
countries. 
This is understandable because the 20th Congress, which 
marks a new stage in the creative development of Marxism-
Leninism, has given a thorough analysis of the present inter-
national and internal situation, has armed the Communist 
Party and all the Sovieu people with a majestic plan for a 
further struggle for the building of communism, and has 
opened new prospects for the joint action of all parties 
of the working class for the elimination of the threat of 
another war and for the interests of the working people. 
A very short period has elapsed since the 20th Congress 
of the Party, but even during this short period the great 
life-giving force of its decisions have found concrete mani-
festation in the new successes of the Soviet people in all 
sectors of Communist construction. The Soviet people have 
rallied Still more closely around the Communist Party, their 
leader.

They are fully determined to carry out in the future 
too the wise Leninist policy of the Party, the policy of 
a further consolidation of the might of the Socialist 
Fatherland, the policy of peace and cooperation with all 
countries. 
The decisions of the 20th CPSU Congress and the suc-
cesses of our Party and the Soviet people in the course of 
their practical realization are in the center of attention 
of the world public. While the program for the struggle 
for the stabilization of peace and the vital interests of 
the people--set by the 20th Congress--was greeted with 
satisfaction and aroused great inspiration among the work-
ing people of all countries, it has given rise to alarm 
and rancor in the camp of the enemies of the working .class. 
The reactionary circles of the United States and several 
other capitalist countries are clearly perturbed by the 
increased influence of the ideas of socialism, by the active 
and consistent struggle of peace-loving peoples for a lessen-
ing of international tension and for the strengthening of 
the cause of peace. 
In the decision of the CPSU Central Committee, it is 
pointed out that lately the bourgeois press has launched 
an extensive, slanderous anti-Soviet campaign which the 
reactionary circles are trying to base on certain facts 
connected with the condemnation by the CPSU of the cult of 
J. V. Stalin. 
By organizing this campaign the enemies of socialism 
are making every effort to weaken the power of attraction of 
the decisions of the 20th CPSU Congress in order to distract 
the attention of the working class and its Party from the 
important tasks set by the 20th Congress. They are resort-
ing to all sorts of tricks and devices in order to distort 
the policy of the Communist Party, in order to cast a shadow 
on the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism, in order to under-
mine the trust of the working people in the first Socialist 
country in the world, the USSR, and in order to sow confusion 
in the ranks of the international Communist and workers' 
movement. 
The ideologists of the bourgeoisie, by launching various 
slanderous inventions in regard to the cult of personality, 
are trying to conceal the fact that what is involved is a 
stage that already has been covered. But they will not

succeed in distorting the truth, in falsifying history! 
The whole world knows the persistence and determination 
with which the Communist Party and the Soviet Government 
are liquidating the consequences of the personality cult 
and are successful implementing (great) tasks in the interests 
of the strengthening of peace and the building of Communism, 
In the interests of the broad masses of the people. 
The CPSU Central Committee stresses in its decision 
that, in its criticism of the personality cult, the Party 
proceeds from the principles of Marxism-Leninism, from the 
premise of Marxist-Leninist theory in regard to the role 
of the masses, parties, and individuals in history. 
As is well known, at the 20th CPSU Congress, the ques-
tion of the cult of the personality and its consequences 
were examined in detail. The bold and principled criti-
cism of the cult of personality, developed on the initiative 
of the Central Committee, was supported by the whole of our 
Party and the entire Soviet people. It was clear testimony 
of the strength and the might of our Party and of the Soviet 
socialist society. Only a Party nurtured on the revolutionary 
principles of Marxism-Leninism, which expresses the basic 
interests of the people and which enjoys their boundless 
support, could act so boldly and with such fortitude. 
The Party has considered that, although its statement 
against the cult of the person of Stalin would evoke certain 
temporary difficulties, in the long run--considering the 
basic interests and the final objectives of the working 
class--it would produce great and positive results. 
This also serves as a firm guarantee that any such mani-
festations as the cult of personality can never reappear in 
our Party and country and that henceforth the leadership 
of the country by the Party will be carried out collectively/ 
on the basis of Marxist-Leninist policy, with the active 
and creative participation of millions of workers. 
Millions of people, both in our country and abroad, 
studying the decisions of the CPSU Central Committee, will 
find in them exhaustive explanations of the causes which . 
led to the emergence and the spread of the cult of the per-
sonality, and they will approve all the decisions which 
have been and are being carried out by the Communist Party

and ,its Central Committee to overcome the cult of person-
ality and its consequences. The CPSU Central Committee has 
profoundly analyzed both the objective conditions which led 
to the spread of the personality cult and the subjective 
factors connected with the personal features of Stalin, 
the negative nature of which has been pointed out by Lenin. 
The Soviet people are reading the decisions of the 
20th CPSU Congress. This 20th Party Congress and the en-
tire policy of the Central Committee since Stalin's death 
clearly show that, within the Central Committee of the 
Party, there existed a nucleus of Leninist leaders who cor-
rectly understood the immediate requirements of both internal 
and foreign policies. Immediately after Stalin's death, 
the Leninist nucleus of the Central Committee began a deter-
mined struggle against the personality cult and its wretched 
consequences. The positive results of this struggle are 
having a beneficial influence on the entire multilateral 
activity of our people. 
The enemies of socialism-affirm that the cult of the 
person of Stalin has resulted not from definite historic 
conditions which are already part of the past but from the 
Soviet system. Such slanderous assertions are denied by 
the entire history of the development of the Soviet State. 
A long, difficult, and glorious road has been covered 
? by our Motherland under the leadership of the Communist 
Party. It was the first country in the world to pave the 
? way to socialism for mankind. It had to overcome age-old 
economic, cultural, and technical backwardness; it had to 
build socialism under conditions of severe struggle against 
the class enemies and their agents within the country as 
well as against the intrigues of international imperialist 
reaction. 
For more than a quarter of a century, the land of the 
Soviets, like a besieged fortress, found itself in condi-
tions of capitalist encirclement and under a constant threat 
of imperialist aggression. The complex international and 
internal situation required iron discipline and the strictest 
.centralization of leadership. Under such conditions it was 
necessary to impose certain limitations on democracy which 
were justified by the logic of the struggle of our people 
in conditions of capitalist encirclement.

Historic experience shows that all the difficulties 
and obstacles on the road to the building of socialism were 
overcome. As a result of the heroic efforts of the Soviet 
people and the Communist Party, our country took a gigantic 
leap forward in its economic and cultural development and 
became a mighty Socialist state. The world wide historic 
successes of socialism in the Soviet Union have marked the 
triumph of the Leninist general line of the Party. 
The strength and vitality of the Soviet socialist order 
and its superiority over the bourgeois order have been 
proved by the unprecedented tempo of the economic and cul-
tural development of our country. The Soviet order has 
set into motion the inexhaustible forces of the masses of 
the people. It has involved millions of people in the 
struggle for socialism. Soviet society has the strength of 
the consciousness of the masses. Its Tate is determined by 
the constructive labor of the heroic working class, the col-
lective farm peasantry, and the peoples intelligentsia. 
It is this which demonstrates that the Soviet order has 
emerged with honor from the most difficult trials both in 
peace and war. 
Today the Central Committee and our entire Party are 
concentrating their main effort on carrying out the decisions 
of the 20th CPSU Congress, which contain a detailed program 
for the further strengthening of the Soviet order, for the 
development of its economy and culture, for the constant 
improvement of the well-being of the workers and the all-
around development of socialist democracy. Toward this end 
are directed the measures being carried out by the Party 
and the Government for the broadening of the rights and 
the competence of the Union Republics, for the strictest 
observance of the law, for the reorganization of the planning 
system, for the development of local initiative for the acti-
vization of activities of the local Soviets and for the - 
development of criticisms and self-criticism. 
Basing itself on the decisions of the 20th Party Con-
gress, the CPSU Central Committee appeals to the Party 
organizations: consistently to observe in all their work 
the most important postulate in the teaching of Marxism-
Leninism on the people as the makers of history and the 
creators of all the material and spiritual riches of mankind; 
on the decisive role of the Marxist party in the revolutionary

struggle for the reorganization of society and for the vic-
tory of communism; persistently to continue the work car-
ried on in the past years by the Central Committee of the 
Party by the strict observance in all Party organizations, 
from top to bottom, of the Leninist principle of Party 
leadership and, above all, of the highest principle, that 
of collective leadership; the observance of the norms of 
Party life as determined by the charter of our Party, and 
the development of criticism and self-criticism. 
To reestablish fully the principles of Soviet socialist 
democracy as expressed in the constitution of the Soviet 
Union and to correct fully all infringements of revolutionary 
socialist legality; to mobilize our cadres, all the Commu-
nists, and the broadest masses of the workers in the struggle 
for the practical realization of the tasks of the Sixth 
Five Year Plan, developing by every means the creative 
initiative and the energy of the masses who are the true 
makers of history. 
The decisions of the CPSU Central Committee on the 
abolition of the cult of personality and its consequences 
are of the greatest international importance. This docu-
ment shows the extent of the reactions and the approval of 
all the fraternal Communist and workers parties in regard 
to the historic decisions of the 20th CPSU Congress. It 
also points out that the fraternal parties are learning 
in good time of the maneuvers of the enemies of socialism, 
who are attempting to introduce confusion into the ranks 
of the international Communist and workers movement, and 
that they are showing a worthy resistance. 
At present, when the forces of socialism have immeasur-
ably increased, when socialism has become a world system, 
and wh2n the variety of roads to socialism in the various 
countries are becoming apparent, the Marxist parties of 
the working class must naturally preserve and strengthen 
their international fraternal solidarity in the struggle 
against the threat of a new war, against the antipopular 
forces of monopoly capital which are striving to suppress 
all revolutionary and progressive movement. 
In particular, such a fact as the U.S. Senate's allo-
cation of large sums for subversive activities in the coun-
tries of socialism and the infamous provocation of the

imperialist agents in Poznan, directed against the people's 
rule, show that it is impossible to permit carelessness in 
the face of the new intrigues of the imperialist agents 
who are striving to penetrate into the socialist countries 
in order to cause damage to the workers and undermine their 
achievements. 
Our Motherland, which was the first to pave the way 
to socialism, today is in the full flOwer of its creative 
forces. The Soviet people, armed with the historic decisions 
of the 20th CPSU Congress and consolidated around the Commu-
nist Party, are advancing firmly and confidently. In the 
closest unity with the Soviet Union, under the banner of 
socialism, inepired by the Marxist-Leninist doctrine, the 
great People's China and all the countries of People's Demo-
cracy are building a new life. The ideas of peace, demo-
cracy, and socialism have the support of many millions of 
workers in the capitalist, colonial, and dependent countries. 
No angry or slanderous attacks by our 'enemies will suc-
ceed in halting the inviolable progress of the historic 
development of mankind toward communism.

Pravda, 6 July, (as broadcast by radio), excerpt 
The enemies of socialism have frequently made the allega-
tion against our Party that, as a result of the establishment 
of the political domination of the working class in our doUntry, 
the basis of democracy was undermined. In reality, however, 
the political domination of the working class is the only means 
for the defense of all the workers from the yoke of capitalism, 
from the coercion of the bourgeoisie, from imperialist wars, 
from class and national enslavement and for the insurance of 
a real people's rule. 
The historic experience of the Soviet Union confirms this 
convincingly. The Soviet regime has set into motion innumerable 
forces inherent in the popular masses. It introduced millions 
of people to a conscious administration of the state, to the 
building of socialism. At a certain phase the complicated 
international and internal situation in which our people had 
to live demanded iron discipline, a constant acceleration of 
vigilance, the strictest centralization of leadership. 
As noted in the decision of the CPSU Central Committee on 
the overcoming of the cult of the individual and its consequences, 
this could not but have had a negative effect on the development 
of certain democratic forms. In the course of the obdurate 
struggle against the whole world of imperialism, our country 
had to introduce certain restrictions of democracy justified 
by the logic of the struggle of our people for socialism under 
the conditions of capitalist encirclement. But even then these 
restrictions were considered temporary by the Party and people, 
due to be eliminated with the strengthening of the Soviet State 
and the development of socialism throughout the world. 
In spite of a certain restriction of some democratic forms 
caused by the complicated situation, the Soviet regime from 
the first days of its existence consisted of a higher degree 
of democracy than any bourgeois democratic country. This is 
understandable because in contrast to the (bourgeois) 
democratic countries, under the Soviet regime authority is 
practiced in the interests of the majority of the population. 
Steadily realizing Lenin's national policy, the Communist 
Party be,ame the inspirer and organizer of the friendship of the 
Soviet peoples. It is in the USSRthat for the first time, not

formally but in actual fact, the equality of the nationalities 
has been insured. To all members of the society without 
exception the right to work, to education and leisure, to 
participate in state affairs, the freedom of speech, of press, 
of conscience, as well as real opportunities for the develop-
ment of individual abilities, and all other democratic rights 
and liberties, have been insured. 
In the recent years the Party has adopted new measures 
for the development of the democratic foundations of our 
society's life. These measures include the extension of the 
rights and competence of the Union Republics, the strengthening 
of the socialist legislation, the reconstruction of the 
planning system for the purpose of releasing local initiative, 
the development of :criticism and self-criticism. The task is 
now to develop Soviet socialist democratism as before and with 
all persistency, and to induce an ever increasing number of 
workers to active participation in state administration. 
Our socialist state owes all its successes to the leader-
ship of the Communist Party. Sometimes it is asked: Why does 
only one party exist in the USSR? A multitude of parties is 
inherent in a society with different classes and different 
interests: this is primarily innerent in a bourgeois society, 
where there are antagonistic classes. Before the Revolution 
there were many parties in Russia. There was a party of 
capitalists, a party of landowners, a party with the loud-sounding 
name of the Socialist-Revolutionary Party and others. And there 
existed a party of the working class, the Communist Party founded 
by the great Lenin. This party succeeded in raising the workers' 
to the struggle against the capitalists and landlords, against 
the Tsarist regime. Under its leadership the Great October 
Socialist Revolution was carried out. 
The Communist Party has shown in fact, in the experience 
of life, that it is this and no other party which represents 
the working class and defends its interests. The petty 
bourgeois parties, the Social-Revolutionaries, Mansheviks, 
Anarchists and their like, went bankrupt and exposed themselves 
in the eyes of the masses as helpers of the bourgeoisie. It is 
for this reason that the Russian workers, who came out victorious 
the October Revolution under the leadership of the Communist

Party, entrusted to it the helm of the country's administration. 
From year to year the confidence of the people in the Communist 
Party and their love for the Communist Party continued to grow 
in strength; with the Party leading it farther and farther still, 
along the road of building socialism. 
At present time, as a result of the victory of socialism, 
a new homogeneous society has been created in the Soviet Union 
which is devoid of any hostile classes, of any social groups - 
whose interests fail to coincide. Therefore there is no social 
ground in the Soviet society for the origination and existence 
of other than the Communist Party. 
Some people abroad are interested in having in the USSR 
artificially created non-communist parties?, financed by foreign 
capital and serving its interests. But the Soviet people have 
no needce such parties. The Soviet people enforce their social 
forms on no one; neither do they intend to adopt any alien 
social forms. This does not mean, of course, that in other 
countries proceeding along the road of socialism other workers 
parties should not, under certain historical conditions, be 
given the opportunity of taking part in the administration--on 
the condition that the leading role is assured for the revolu-
tionary Marxist Party which expresses the interests of the 
working class in the most consistent manner. 
As for our country, the Communist Party was, is, and will 
be the one and only ruler of thoughts, the one to express the 
ideas and hopes of the people--their leader and organizer 
throughout their entire struggle for communism. Armed with the 
Marxist-Leninist theory, strong in its unity, solidarity, and 
discipline, unsurpassed in its skill to organize the millions 
of the masses and to guide them correctly in a difficult situa-
tion, the Communist Party has been, from the first days of the 
Soviet State, confidently steering the ship of our state and 
social life toward communism. 
Addressing the. Ninth Party Congress in March 1920, V. I. 
Lenin said: "It was only because the Tarty was on guard, be-
cause it was strictly disciplined, because the Party authority 
united all departments and institutions, because scores, 
hundreds, thousands, and then millions of people responded to 
the signal given by the Central_ Committee, and because un-
precedented sacrifices were made, that the miracle which has

happened could have happened. Only because of this were we 
able to win against the twofold, threefold, and fourfold 
attacks of the entente imperialists, and of the imperialists 
of all the world." 
Whenever the country was in danger, whenever sacrifices 
were required and privations suffered, whenever new difficult 
tasks faced the country the Communists were the first to rush 
ahead, meeting the difficulties, carrying with them the broad 
masses, and inevitably scoring a victory. To be where the 
fate of the revolution is decided, the fate of socialism, 
the fate of communist construction, has become a law to the 
Communist. Thus it was during the years of the Civil War and 
foreign intervention when many a son of our Party lost his 
life in the struggle against the enemy but would not give up 
the gains of the Revolution. 
Thus it was during the period of restoration when under 
the difficult conditions of the New Economic Policy Communists 
were in the advanced ranks of the obdurate struggle against 
the class enemy. 
Thus it was during the years of the country's socialist 
industrialilation and the collectivization of agriculture 
when Communists went in large groups to the construction sites 
and in the face of the furious hatred and fierce resistance 
of the class enemy insured the fulfillment of the Party's 
assignments. Thus it was during the years of the Great Father-
land War when the Tarty directed its best forces to the military 
fronts and to the decisive sectors of the rear. 
The leading role of our Party emerged with even greater 
force during recent years, when on the initiative of the Central 
Committee of the CPSU the vast measures aiming at a new develop-
ment of the economy, at the liquidation of the backwardness of 
a number of branches of our national economy, and primarily 
agriculture, and at the acceleration of the pace of cultural 
construction began to be, put into practice. 
In accordance with the instructions of the local Party 
organs, primary organizations of the Party have squarely turned 
to face the concrete tasks of economic construction, begun 
making a more profound study of the 'economy and technology of

production, to delve actively into the state of affairs at 
enterprises, collective farms, MTS, and state farms. Tens of 
thousands of Communists have voluntarily left for work in MTS, 
state farms, and collective farms and have by their untiring 
organizational work played a singularly important role in 
raising agriculture which was begun in the recent period as 
is continuing to grow steadily. 
Never will the patriotic efforts of our youth who on the 
call of the Party have gone to the eastern areas by the hundreds 
of thousands to reclaim the new lands and the projects of the 
Sixth Five Year Plan be erased from the memories of the Soviet 
people. The raising of the level of the leading work of the 
Party and all its local organizations is the true road to new 
successes in the struggle for the further strengthening of the 
Soviet Socialist State, for the upsurge of industry and agri-
culture, for the growth of the well-being and culture of the 
workers., Our Party is boldly leading us along this road, for 
It unites in its ranks the most progressive, the most conscious 
and organized section of .the Soviet people; for it is insepar-
ably bound, with the broadest masses of the workers.

The resolution of the CPSU Central Committee on the over-
coming of the cult of the individUal and its conseqUendes has 
found a wide response not only in the Socialist Camp but in 
the entire international working class movement and in all our 
fraternal parties. For it concerns basic problems--the essenc6,-
of the Socialist system and its victorious struggle against 
distortions connected with the cult of Stalin. 
This momentous document signifies a further progress of 
self-criticism and improvement, brought about in the life of 
the Soviet Union and in the activity of the entire international 
working class movement by the 20th CPSU Congress. It is one 
more Soviet contribution to the fraternal discussion now going 
on in all Communist and workers parties. That is why it was 
greeted by them with appreciation. 
"This document seems to me an exceptionally important 
contribution to the elucidation of problems which have been 
put forward by the international working class and Communist 
movement in connection with the criticism of Stalin's activity. 
Formulated at the 20th CPSU Congress,"Comrade Togliatti said. 
The enemies of Socialism have unleashed a fierce propa-
ganda campaign round this discussion. The main aim of this 
campaign is to whitewash the incurably diseased capitalist 
system through an attempt to "prove" that the distortions of 
the Stalin period, in whose removal the CPSU has been effectively 
engaged for 3 years, allegedly stemmed from the Soviet system 
itself. But if it were so, how can one explain the fact that 
the CPSU leaders have themselves withCommunist courage made 
public these distortion's and declared an inexorable struggle 
against them? 
The instigators of this slander campaign from the other 
side of the Atlantic carefully avoid giving an answer to this 
question. For the answer given to this question by the CPSU in 
deeds and in works clearly shows that the distortions of the 
21

Approved For Release 2003/08/11: CIA-RDP78-02771R000200380003-3 
Stalin period not only did not stem from the Socialist system, 
but were an overgrowth which was harmful and alien to the 
essence of this system. 
"The courageous and merciless self-criticism in the problem 
of the cult of personality," as Pravda rightly points out, "is 
a new, telling expression of the vigor and power of our Party, 
of the vigor and power of the Soviet Socialist system." 
The CPSU Central Committee was aware of the fact that the 
open admission of the errors committed would result in certain 
negative consequences, providing easy pry for the enemies of 
Communism. But these difficulties will be of a passing chara-
ter and will be absolutely incomparable with the enormous, 
positive results which correspond to the most vital interests 
of the working class. 
For does not the courageous and uncompromising unmasking 
of all negative manifestations connected with the cult of Stalin 
create the best guarantee against any possible repetition of 
these severe distortions in the future? For does it not 
create a solid foundation for the development of inner party 
democracy, collective leadership, and all-round development 
of Soviet democracy, based on an active and creative partici-
pation of the masses in governing their own country? 
The resaution of the CPSU Central Committee contains a 
more extensive answer than the documents of the 20th CPSU 
Congress to the question how in conditions of the Soviet 
Socialist system the cult of Stalin, with all its severe con-
sequences, could have originated and spread. The Soviet 
comrades are thus not only analysing the subjective factors 
connected with the personal traits of Stalin, but above all 
the historical conditions in which the USSR was building 
Socialism. 
The exceptionally difficult and complex international 
and internal situation of the USSR--a fortress encircled by 
the enemy--required an iron discipline and centralization of 
leadership, which exerted a negative influence on the develop-
ment of Socialist democracy. But already at that time, 
emphasizes the resolution, the-Party and the nation regarded 
these restrictions as temporary ones.

The resolution of the CPSU Central Committee emphatically 
stresses the harm done to Socialist construction and to the 
development of democracy within the Party and in the Soviet 
State by Stalin's erroneous thesis on the sharpening of the 
class struggle with the progress of the Socialist construction 
in the USSR. This document states that this thesis was correct 
only with regard to the given stages of the transition period. 
While in practice, in conditions created by the victory of 
Socialism, it served to justify mass repressions and the most 
brutal infringements of Socialist legality. 
The resolution of the CPSU Central Committee sheds light 
on the situation which made it difficult for the Leninist core of 
the Central Committee to come out against Stalin and to wage 
a struggle against the unlawful acts which were being committed 
at that time. In conditions in which in spite of Stalin's 
errors the nation was in hard toil pushing forward Socialist 
construction, steps against Stalin would not have met with the 
support of the nation. 
. In conditions in which the successes of Socialist construc-
tion were most closely linked in the consciousness of the nation 
with the name of Stalin any step against Stalin would have been 
understood as a step against the cause of Socialism itself, as 
an extremely dangerous, in conditions of capitalist encirclement,' 
undermining of the unity of the Party and of the whole State'. 
Immediately after the death of Stalin the Leninist core of the 
Central Committee started a determined struggle against the 
cult of the individual and its severe consequences. 
"It is evident," the closing part of the respective part of 
the resolution reads, "that all this explains, but by no means 
justifies,the cult of J. V. Stalin and its consequences which 
have been so sharply and justly condemned by our Party." 
The resolution of the -CPSU Central Committee categorically 
refutes the thesis that as a result of the cult of personality 
and the distortions connected with it, the Socialist character 
of the Soviet social system, whose foundations are social owner-
ship of the means of production, the worker-peasant alliance, 
and friendship among nations) has changed.

The cult of the individual, the breaches of legality, 
have done great harm to the development of Socialist democracy 
and hampered the creative initiative of the masses. The cult of 
Stalin, who found himself above any criticism, led to serious 
errors and neglect in the management of agriculture. In pre-
paring the country to face Nazi invasion, it led to brutal 
arbitrariness which resulted in a conflict with Yugoslavia. 
All these errors, although they have done great harm to 
the State and hampered the development of the vital forces of 
the Soviet community, were unable, however, to divert this 
community from the basic road of development towards Communism. 
We know from communiques and press articles, from reports 
by people returning from the Soviet Union, that in recent years 
great transformations toward the democratization of life, the 
consolidation of Socialist legality, the improvement of the 
living standards of the working people, transformations being 
implemented by the Party and the government consistently, 
step by step, in accordance with the principle of the unity 
between works and deeds, between theory and practice, have 
been taking place in the USSR. 
This finds its expression in the development of Soviet 
democracy, in the steps being undertaken by the Party and 
the government with a view to extending the rights and powers 
of the Union Republics, to insuring strict observance of 
legality, to stimulating local initiative, to enlivening the 
activeness of local Soviets, as well as to stimulating criti-
cism and self-criticism. 
Would it have been possible to reclaim through administra-
tive means 33 million hectares of virgin land during about two 
years? It was possible to implement this enormous task, as 
Pravda. rightly emphasizes, only owing to the consciousness, full 
initiative,and heroic labor of the people's masses. 
The resolution of the CPSU Central Committee cites state-
ments of the fraternal Communist and workers parties and of 
their individual leaders concerning the 20th Congress. Worthy 
of note are the polemical accerits in the appraisal of the 
interview with Comrade' Togliatti.

As far as this polemic is concerned, worth stressing is 
the fact that on both sides it is characterized by the most 
friendly exchange of views between comrade Communists, an 
exchange which not only does not weaken but strengthens 
proletarian internationalism and the profound organic unity 
of the international working class movement. 
The concluding part of the resolution of the CPSU Central 
Committee contains an appeal to all Party organizations 
steadily to implement the political, organizational, and 
economic directives of the 20th Congress. The resolution points 
out that in conditions of the transformation of Socialism into 
a world system, new inspiring prospects of victories in the 
struggle for peace and Socialism are being opened up before 
the'internatipnal working class movement, 
The diversity of roads leading to Socialism in various 
cbuntries is taking shape, but, at the same time, the 
international brotherhood and solidarity of our movement are 
becoming of especial importance. "In their activity in the 
present conditions," says the resolution, ."all Communist Parties 
take as their starting point the individual national traits and 
conditions of each country, and express as fully as possible 
the national interests of their peoples." 
Bearing in mind that the struggle for the interests of 
the working class, for peace and national independence of their 
countries is at the same time the cause of the entire inter-
national proletariat, they are merging their efforts and 
strengthening their mutual bonds and cooperation. 
This solidarity in the struggle for common aims we use to 
oppose the maneuvers of the advocates of the cold war, who are 
relentlessly engaged in attempts at sowing division in 
Socialist countries. 
The new document of the CPSU Central Committee will 
undoubtedly be of great importance for discussion and practical 
activity which draw their strength from the Leninist ideas 
of the 20th Congress. The article reprinted by us from Pravda's  
July 8 issue, entitled "The Soviet, Truly People's System is 
Lasting and Unbreakable," is an essential commentary to this 
resolution.

The resolution of the CPSU Central Committee should be 
carefully studied by every Party member. Our Party and working 
class, together with the whole international working class 
movement, will do their best to draw all the conclusions from 
this document which correspond to our tasks in the struggle for 
the development of people's democracy and the victory of 
Socialism.

HUNGARY 
Szabad Nep,? 3 July (as broadcast by radio) 
Attempts at disrupting the unity of the Party have gained 
ground recently. After the events of the past few days the 
majority of Party members expected the Central Committee to 
define its attitude. After the 20th CPSU Congress profound 
changes were set in motion in Hungary. Collective leadership 
is asserting itself more and more in the Party, and communist 
criticism and self-criticism are coming into full play in 
Party organizations, factories, villages and offices. Workers 
criticize the faults of Party work, and the shortcomings of 
the state .and economic administration ever-more boldly, and 
submit clever and competent proposals to remedy them. 
Our Party and Government have rehabilitated our comrades 
who were condemned unjustly, granted large-scale amnesty to 
others who were sentenced for political crimes, and have taken 
firm measures to enforce socialist legality. Acting on the 
proposal of the Central Committee, the Government has'already 
taken various steps to eliminate bureaucracy from administration; 
the field of competence of managers and local councils has been 
widened and their economic independence increased. 
Those fruitful debates which dealt with various political, 
ideological, and economic questions in the light of the 20th 
CPSU Congress were also levers of our growing and steadily 
developing democracy. The debates were particularly fruitful 
about the directives of our Second Five Year Plan. Hundreds 
of thousands of workers, working peasants and intellectuals 
took part in these debates, most of which were very useful and 
instructive in that they widened the political horizon of the 
workers. Many valuable proposals were made which are well worth 
taking into consideration. All this proves that Party democracy 
and the democratic character of our entire national life are 
developing ever-more vigorously under the guidance of our ?arty's 
Central ComMittee, The Central Committee wants to speed up 
this trend of development in the future.

However, the resolution passed by the Central Committee 
several days ago pointed out that the healthy development which 
began after the 20th CPSU Congress is threatened by the fact 
that opportunist, demogogic views and even ideas hostile to 
the Party and the People's Democracy have gained ground in 
many places, first of all in the debates of the Petofi Club 
of the UTM (Union of Working Youth), in some weeklies and 
periodicals, for instance in certain numbers of the Irodaimi 
U sa (Literary Journal) and the Beke Es Szabadsag (Peace and
freedom), and also in certain meetings arranged by some Party 
and mass organizations. 
Journalism was hardly mentioned at the latest debate of 
the Petofi Club, although it was convened to discuss problems 
relating to the press and information. Instead, many opportunist, 
harmful, and even hostile views were expressed on that occasion. 
Some called for a new revolution, for a new ides of March and 
for structural changes. 
What kind of new revolution could take place in Hungary 
where there has already been a revolution, a socialist revolu-
tion, led by the most progressive social class, the working 
class which is in close alliance with the working peasantry and 
every worker? We are, therefore, justified in pointing out 
that such a new revolution could be directed only against 
socialism. We can also justly point out that in the language 
of socialism new revolutions of this kind are called counter-
revolution. Our working class and working people are well aware 
of this. 
Tibor Den i has used that debate for launching an open and 
brutal attack on Party loyalty. He attacked the leaders of 
the Party and the Party's activists. He said that liberation 
would start only now. But our liberation took place in 1945. 
Such statements, therefore, disparage and reject all that has 
been created and achieved by our people in the course of almost 
12 years of freedom. 
Tibor Den i appealed to his audience to disseminate his 
anti-Party views all over the country. He launched an open 
appeal for anti-Party (organizational work?) which has nothing 
to do with debates on ideological questions or with democracy.

Deri's speech was received with profound indignation by, and 
aroused stormy protests from, the Communists who attended 
the debate. 
Certain speeches delivered during the latest debates, the 
cheers and expressions of approval with which they were re-
ceived, and the debates on literature have clearly expressed 
the disparagement of the leading role of the working class and 
the Party. Those who allege that the working class is not active, 
does not deal with policy and does not understand the signifi-
cance of the 20th CPSU Congress, decry the working class.. Those 
who express such ideas by word of mouth or in writing do not 
know the truth. 
The Hungarian working class led the struggle for a revolu-
tionary change during the Horthy fascism under the leadership 
of the Party. It is the leading force of our socialist construe:-
tive efforts today. Its political conduct is infinitely better 
than the policy of those who attack the Party and our people's 
democratic system. The working class fights, and will continue 
to fight, boldly against everything that might endanger our 
achievements or the application of the lessons ? of the 20th 
Congress in our country. 
It cannot be accidental that these opportunist, harmful 
and anti-Party views were voiced by those who still maintain a 
close and systematic contact with Imre Nagy, who has been 
expelled from the Party because of his anti-Marxists views, 
hostile to the Party and the People's Democracy, and his fac-
tionalism. 
Unfortunately, these brutal and anti-Party views were not 
always met by the rebuff they deserved. This happened because 
these debates, and especially the recent debates arranged by 
the Petofi club, were attended not only by honest people who 
loved the Party dearly and who wanted to help and to further 
socialist construction--although a number of them have been 
misled by demagogy--but because the debates increasingly be-
came rallying points for individuals opposed to the Party and 
the ideas of socialism, including persons who have been expelled 
from the Party and bourgeois elements.

. These people turned the debates into scenes of attacks 
against the People's Democracy. They out-shouted and disturbed 
those speeches which presented the correct Party attitude, but 
they enthusiastically applauded every attack on the Party and 
the People's Democracy. They were not disturbed by the presence 
at these debates of representatives of the imperialist press 
who eagerly seized the opportunity to write of the slanders told 
about our political system. 
All these events outraged honest and loyal Communists and 
non-Party citizens, workers and intellectuals alike. They 
justly expected the Central Committee to reply and to inform 
public opinion. 
We are convinced that the overwhelming majority of the 
Party membership, workers, working peasants, and intellectuals 
have received with satisfaction the Party Central Committee's 
resolution, published last Sunday, which rejects and condemns the 
attack which is developing against the Party, the working class 
and the working masses to be on guard. 
We must be on our guard. We have been reminded of this 
duty not only by the debates, hostile to the Party, which took 
place in the Petofi Club, but also by the imperialist provoca-
tion at Poznan. The Central Committee's resolution is an appeal 
to every supporter Of the People's Democracy: Do not allow the 
demagogues to mislead you, because only with the Party and 
guided by the Party can you successfully struggle for the 
assertion of the ideas of the 20th Congress and for the develop-
ment of socialist democracy. 
The Central Committee of our Party is exerting supreme 
efforts to assert the spirit of the 20th Congress in the Party 
and in the whole country more quickly. It fights unequivocally 
against (word unintelligible,?Ed.) and its remnants, against 
sectarianism, against hardened and ossified views and dogmatism. 
It intends to struggle with an even greater determination for 
the all-round development of socialist democracy. 
In order to achieve it, it is necessary that Communists 
should fight, .above all with political weapons, by conviction, 
for the purity of Marxism-Leninism and for the policy of the 
Party, that they should watch over the unity of the Party,

that they should prevent the driving of a wedge between the 
Party and its leaders, and that they should rally behind the 
Central Committee in serried ranks. 
It is the duty of the press to Tend adequate support tO 
this endeavor and to arm Communists and every supporter of our 
regime with ideological weapons so that they can struggle for 
the purity of ideological and political life. Lately, the 
press has failed to take a sufficiently strong stand against 
incorrect views. It did not condemn the anti-Party (character?) 
of certain debates. It was not by accident that many of our ? 
comrades have sharply criticized a Szabad article, pub-
lished under the title "The Sunshine of InTalectuality" which 
gave a false appraisal bf the debates in the Petofi Club. 
Our Party does not reject everything which was said at 
these debates or was printed in the press. It does not condemn 
those who took part in the debates. This is made evident by 
the Central Committee resOlution. We must state as an estab-
lished fact that these debates were actively attended by a 
Very large number of Party and non-Party members, honest people, 
loyal to the Party who love our regime. Many correct speeches 
were delivered during the debates, and many correct articles 
and workers' letters appeared in the press. 
Many of these criticized, and justly, the mistakes com-
mitted in the past and at the present. The Party and its 
Central Committee (paid?) due attention to the correct critical 
remarks made about their policy and work by Party and non-Party 
members who are loyal to the Party and our demoeratic system, 
who want to help the Party to correct mistakes, and in the 
elaboration of new and important ideological and political 
problems. 
Of course, many important and correct measures have been 
taken already, and it is an unhealthy sign that theae were not 
-mentioned during the debates. Indeed, many such mistakes were 
criticized at the debates whose correction has been in progress 
for a long time. Correct critical remarks, however, must be 
dealt

of our public life and to developing our ideological and 
economic work. Erroneous views were also uttered in the 
course of the various debates, views which were simply due to 
lack of experience or lack of information. In such cases the 
mistake can be corrected by explaining the correct, Marxist 
and Party-like attitude. One of the most important tasks of 
these debates is to clarify incorrect views and to develop 
correct views. 
The resolution of the Central Committee is not directed 
against these incorrect views; what it rejects are the opportunist 
views hostile to the Party. We must wage an energetic ideological 
and political struggle against opportunism, all the more so 
since it can easily become a weapon in the hands of the class 
enemy. 
The Central Committee and the Party want democracy, a 
socialist democracy where there is no room for the enemies 
of the people, but where views are clarified in Party-like 
debates. What we need are debates which help us to solve our 
problems, strengthen the unity of the Patty, consolidate the 
ties between the Party and masses, solve important ideological 
questions and promote the work of the Party and our productive 
efforts. 
The Central Committee of our Party is resolved to proceed 
steadily on the road defined by the 20th Congress. It raises 
high the banner of socialism. All those who have placed :their 
faith and .confidence in the ideas of the 20th Congress, and who 
want to struggle and to work with the people and for the people 
must rally under this banner.

CZECHOSLOVAKIA 
Rude Pravo, 4 July, excerpt (as broadcast by radio) 
Yesterday our press published the decision of the 
Central Committee of the CPSU on the cult of personality 
and its consequences. This is an important document not 
only for the CPSU and the Soviet people but for the entire 
international workers movement. It contains a lesson for 
our Party, ,too, which always considered its older and 
more experienced co-fighter, the ,CPSU, as its teacher. 
From it we shall continue to learn how to apply Lenin's 
theories and norms of Party life by Utilizing its exper-
iences in a creative and not mechanical way. 
Only a short time has elapsed since the 20th Congress 
of the CPSU. Yet even in this brief period it has become 
clear to the world that the decisions accepted by the 
Soviet Communists have great and vital force, that they 
strengthen the position of socialism, democracy and peace, 
and bring forth an unprecedented revolutionary enthusiasm 
and initiative from the workers. It is also evident that. 
this great program for the strengthening of peace, social-
ism, and working class. unity, outlined by the CPSU Congress 
has greatly upset the reactionary political circles, above 
all those in the United States. 
Recently a new wide-spread slanderous campaign against 
the USSR and the People's Democracies and against the great 
ideas of socialism and communism has been launched. The 
more consistently Communist parties implement their_ pro-
gram, the greater becomes the anger and fury of the enemies 
of socialism. As a pretext for their unbridled attacks they 
use certain facts connected with the criticism of the cult 
of personality around J. V. Stalin and the 6erious mistakes 
which occurred during the last years of his life. 
From the U. S. imperialist circles with their corrupt 
press down to politicians of the.type of Fanfani; the 
Italian Christian Democrat, they all speak about the "bank-
rupt* of communism," of "confusion" inside the Communist 
parties, of"disintegration" of the socialist regimes. The 
ultimate aim of this performance of gravediggers of socialism 
16 to undermine the confidence in the leading socialist power,

to create confusion in the ranks of the international 
workers movement and to cover up their own fear. Yet 
they cannot deceive anyone. 
It is well known that in the course of the debates 
on the results of the CPSU Congress, inherently honest 
people in our country asked: "Will not the bold and open 
criticism and self-criticism weaken the position of social-
ism?" Such views, even if proffered with honesty, failed 
to appreciate basic principles. To speak openly and boldly 
of the grave consequences of the cult of personality was 
necessary, if all the Communist parties were to overcome 
jointly and quickly all its bad influences. 
Obviously in the beginning this bitter truth caused 
painful sadness and even some difficulties inside certain 
Communist parties. Yet all these negative sides are minute 
compared with the tremendous positive results which have 
already become apparent and will appear even stronger in 
the future from the point of view of the basic interests 
and aims of the working class. 
Quills, dipped in the ink of anti-Soviet and anti-
socialist .hatred, try to draw as distorted pictures as pos-
sible. Filling reams of paper, they endeavor to prove that 
the causes of the cult of personality were not objective, 
historic conditions and subjective factors, but the Soviet 
.regime itself and its undemocratic character. Yet just as 
It is impossible to hide the sun behind a dirty hand, no 
slander can prove that the Soviet regime is undemocratic. 
The lie of the alleged Soviet lack of democracy, kept 
alive with every possible effort, will not gain laurels 
for anti-Communist fighters. The past decades have shown that 
true human freedom and democracy was not safeguarded by mono-
polist capitalism, but by socialism. Can any country west 
of the Elbe or east of Peiping insure for its citizens a 
permanently growing living standard, the right to work, 
education and leisure? 
The Communist Party of Czechoslovakia, just as the other 
fraternal parties, has approved and supported the measures 
taken by the CPSU against the cult of personality and its 
consequences. It has drawn practical conclusions for its 
future work from the decisions of the CPSU Congress. The

general inner Party discussions and the recent Party con-
ference have shown that the results of these conclusions 
are beginning to take shape. It is necessary to continue 
on this road, to be consistent and to enforce Leninist 
principles in all spheres of our life. Socialism has be-
come a world system, opening up for all Communist Parties 
and for the entire working class movement wide vistas0 All 
the Communist parties, while guided in their work by individ-
ual national characteristics and their special situation 
and expressing the interests of their own nation's, realize 
at the same time that it is necessary to constantly strengthen 
the tips of international solidarity in the fight against 
the common enemy. This unity and loyalty to the principles 
of proletarian internationalism is the more necessary in 
the face of the various aggressive blocs of capitalist 
countries and the subversive activities directed against the 
countries of the socialist camp. 
The Antipopular events in Poznan, which were.planned 
carefully and long in advance, have taught us to rid our-
selves of carelessness and smugness. Capitalist monopolies 
and certain political circles, so long as they continue to 
exist, will not treat us with excessive liberalism. 
Yet the plans of the black knights with cloak and dag-
ger will fail in the same way as the fairy tales of the 
bourgeois ideologist who forecast the crisis and breakdown 
of Communism. Their proclamations are neither new no 
original. Metternich and the Russian Tsar in their time 
made similar forecasts. Where are they today? They dis-
appeared below the trapdoors of history while the ideals 
of communism continue to be victorious. The followers of 
these prophets, who still foretell the end of communism 
with astrological formulas,' will soon see that despite their 
'vociferous slander of socialism, they are bound to be en-
gulfed eventually by the logical development of history. 
The powerful engine of history rolls forward on its rails. 
No obstacle can holdup this advance towards communism.

EAST GERMANY 
Neues Deutschland, 8 July 
It was impossible to discuss at length at the Third SED 
Conference all problems resulting from the'new situation and 
from the criticism of the personality cult. The Politburo of 
the Central Committee of the SED welcomes the decision of the 
Central Committee of the CPSU of June 30, 1956, on the over-
coming of the personality cult and its consequences. It re-
commends, therefore, that all Party members and Party organi-
zations thoroughly study this important decision, explain it 
to the workers, and draw from it conclusions for improving the 
political, economic, and ideological work of the Party. 
The propaganda of our opponents alleges that Stalin's 
mistakes were rooted in the Soviet system, in its social, con-
stitutional, and political order and in Marxism-Leninism in 
general. Unfortunately some representatives of progressive 
Ideas were influenced by this argument. 
It must be said with all emphasis: The aggressive German 
imperialists and militarists also helped to make it possible 
for Stalin's mistakes to develop. It was they who, tolerated 
and actively supported by their allies in the United States, 
Great Britain, and France, brought German fascism to power in 
order to use it as an assault force against the Soviet Union. 
In this way they have been creating since 1933 an atmosphere 
of permanent threat to and undermining of the Soviet Union. 
It must not be forgotten that the grave and inexcusable mis-
takes of Stalin with regard to the violation of legality were 
committed under these conditions of an agressive policy con-
ducted by German fascism against the Soviet Union. These mis-
takes are not inherent in the Soviet system, however. 
The main point for the further democratization of life 
in the GDR is and Will be that the masses of the people, by 
their cooperation and active work, determine this process and 
contribute toward overcoming all bureaucratic obstacles, to-
ward insuring democratic legality, and toward giving the elected 
representative bodies of the people full scope. The fact that 
mistakes and exaggerations occurred In the observation of demo-
cratic legality was due to the situation of the cold war, tp 
the necessity to combat the constant criminal activities of 
Western agencies, and to the circumstance that socialist legis-
lation had to develop.

The implementation of a correct policy, advocated by all 
workers, demands increased vigilance on the part of all pro-
gressive forces of society. The events of Poznan, where agents 
provocateurs of a reactionary clandestine movement, with the 
help of foreign agents based in West Berlin and West Germany, 
caused disturbances and bloodshed, show that the enemies of 
peace stop at nothing in their efforts thwart the process of 
International relaxation of tension and further democratiza-
tion of life in the countries of the socialist camp and the 
possibilities of a peaceful road to socialism as indicated by 
the 20th CPSU Congress. 
The Third SED Conference raised a multitude of problems 
which must be solved with the help of Marxist-Leninist theory 
and method. "We must state that the socialist education of the 
workers and the Marxist-Leninist instruction of Party members 
has lagged. This is due to the weakness of the theoretical 
work done so far, as well as to the dogmatic traits still pre-
ponderant in Party propaganda_ It is therefore necessary for 
the comrade scientists and propagandists to discuss openly how 
to overcome dogmatism and how to develop an atmosphere of lively, 
creative theoretical work." 
In the GDR, too, the consequences of the personality cult 
must be completely overcome. "On the basis of its own experi-
ence, the Central Committee of the SED began as early as in 
1953 to institute measures against the personality cult; it 
stated, for instance, that it is not permissible to continue 
to name institutes, enterprises, streets, and so forth after 
living persons. But these measures do not mean that all forms 
and consequences of the personality cult have already been 
overcome. For instance, in the history of the Party and in the 
history of the German workers movement it is still customary 
to underestimate the part played by the lower party and trade 
union organizations, to give hardly any appreciation of it. 
The Party organizations must therefore discuss ways in 
which the Party can successfully continue the struggle to 
overcome the personality cult and its consequences. 
Another issue is the better promotion of the Partys 
intellectual and spiritual life. Frank and comradely discus-
sion is of the greatest importance for the education of Party 
members. It cannot be said that this.spirit already prevails 
today in all Party organizations. The Party must also seriously 
consider how the development of cadres and the care for all 
members and candidates can be imporved. At present there 
still exists much indifference toward human beings, as well 
as injustices. This must be changed quickly.

It must be said openly that the Party at present does 
not give sufficient explanation to the workers about the 
causes of and reasons for certain difficulties and contra-
dictions in the building of socialism. Our agitation and 
propaganda sometimes creates the impression that no diffi-
culties whatsoever exist in the GDR, that everything is 
going smoothly. This, however, cannot be the case in the 
period of transition from capitalism to socialism. 
The frequently practiced method of presenting in un-
relieved black and white the comparison between conditions 
In the GDR and West Germany is also harmful. We tell the 
workers quite frankly that in many spheresof science and 
technology it is necessary to catch up with West Germany, 
that it is necessary constantly to improve the material and 
cultural conditions of the workers in the QDR by stepping up 
labor productivity. But the people's democratic order and 
the socialist economy in the GDR give the workers work, secu-
rity, freedom, and a constant improvement of their living 
conditions, whereas the capitalist order in West Germany is 
not based on a stable foundation and is heading toward 
grave economic and social traumata. 
We still have great economic difficulties to overcome. 
The democratization of life must be continued. A creative 
atmosphere is to develop in science, learning, and art. We 
Shall solve all these tasks if we look boldly ahead and 
never lose sight of the goal. 
Talk by Professor Eisler on the statement published by the  
SED Central Committee on the 20th CPSU Congress and the  
Third SED Conference (as broadcast by radio) 
Let us imagine ourselves for a moment in the Soviet . 
Union, in the period after 1933.* The Soviet Union was gravely - 
threatened by German fascism, by the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo axis, 
which Was supported by all international reactionaries. The 
peoples of the Soviet Union, the Communist Party and the 
government of the Soviet Union, had to face, so to speak, 
hourly the danger of a military attack by all the imperialists 
against the first socialist power' The fascists and imperialiOtp 
at the other countries at the same time sent their spies to . 
the Soviet Union. They exploited the reactionary, elements 
Still existing there for their war preparations.

In view of such a situation, which was a matter of life 
and death for the first socialist country, iron discipline, 
a constant increase in vigilance and strict centralization 
of the leadership ... were necessary in the Soviet Union.... 
This involved certain restrictions on democracy. However, 
these necessary restrictions were only regarded by the 
Communist Party of the Soviet Union and by the peoples of 
the Soviet Union as temporary and necessitated by an ex-
tremely complicated and dangerous situation, and were to 
be lifted, of course, as soon as this danger was over. 
It is clear, however, that in such circumstances any 
stand against Stalin, who had great authority, would simply 
not have been approved by the Soviet people. The people 
would have regarded this as a weakening of the preparations 
against the aggressors. 
In this situation Stalin began to override the Party 
and to flagrantly misuse the great authority which he 
possessed. This led to the well-known grave mistakes which 
Stalin committed and which have now been rectified. If 
the Soviet Union had not been involved in such danger by 
German fascism, by the Berlin-Rome-Tokyo axis, it would 
undoubtedly have been possible to prevent in good time the 
mistakes of Stalin and the personality cult of Stalin, and 
to preserve ... the leadership of the communist Party and 
its inner-party democracy, and certainly to restore them 
at an earlier date.

RUMANIA 
Munca, 4 July (as broadcast by radio) 
An old, wise saying of the workers movement states 
that the class enemy's praise is the surest sign that you 
are on the wrong track. The reverse of this rule is just 
as valid: The louder and more furiously the enemy shouts, 
the more the blows dealt to him hurt him. 
Every slander campaign and attack launched by the 
ideologists of capitalism against the revolutionary workers 
movement always reflects the panic which has taken hold of 
the enemies of the working class. This is why nobody was 
surprised that the 20th CPSU Congress brought on furious 
attacks by the ideologists of capitalism as a result of the 
state of unrest and irritation in which the camp of the 
enemies of the working class lives. 
Fully approved and supported by the entire Party and 
by all the Soviet People, by brother communist and workers 
parties, and by millions of working people in the capitalist 
and colonial countries, the decisions of the 20th Congress 
became at once of worldwide historic importance. They con-
stituted a new phase in the creative development of Marxism-
Leninism and opened up new prospects for the United actions 
of all the parties of the working class for the prevention 
of a new war and for the promotion of the workers' interests. 
The first results are visible to all. The Soviet people 
have closed their ranks even more closely around the Commu-
nist Party and are achieving remarkable results in all 
fields of the Soviet Union's political, economic, and cul-
tural life. But this is occurring not only in the Soviet 
Union. Facts everywhere show the great vital force of the 
decisions of the 20th Congress for the international workers 
and communist movement, for the struggle of all progressive 
forces for the strengthening of world peace. 
Adopted by the broad workers masses, the theoretical 
theses of principles set down by the Congress are daily be-
coming a force which worries the enemies of socialism and 
progress. The theses regarding the peaceful coexistence 
of states with different social systems, (the theses regard-
ing?) the possibility of preventing wars, and the diverse

forms of transition to socialism contribute to the easing 
of tension, to the strengthening of the unity of action 
of the forces of peace and democracy, and to the continued 
consolidation of the positions of the world system of 
socialism. 
Under these conditions it is easy to understand that 
the enemies of socialism and communism are striving with 
all their might to distract the attention of the working 
class and its parties from the advanced and inspired ideas 
which the socialist world is proclaiming. 
Reflecting this situation, analyzing the internal and 
international events of the current phase, and clearly ' 
answering the problems raised in life, the decision of the 
CPSU Central Committee published yesterday, regarding the 
liquidation of the cult of personality and its consequences, 
is a document of exceptional importance. 
The CPSU Central Committee's docuffient speaks with the 
all-powerful voice of truth about the invincible progress 
of the historical development of mankind toward communism, 
about the emptiness of the illusions of the ideologists 
of capitalism--the amateurs who fish in troubled waters. 
The tricks of the bourgeois press and of the reactionary 
circles which they sought to use in their new anti-Soviet 
slander campaign appear (ridiculous?) and foolish to all. 
Using as a pretext the facts linked with the cult of person-
ality of Josef Stalin, a cult which the CPSU has condemned, 
they conceal the fact that this is a past phase in the life 
of the Soviet Union. ' 
With the dishonesty which was always characteristic, 
the ideologists of the bourgeoisie are forgetting the fact 
that, beginning 3 years ago, a persevering and firm action 
has been carried out for the liquidation of the consequences 
of the cult of personality, and that the new tasks in the 
interest of the consolidation of peace and the building of 
communism, in the interest of the broad,peoplets masses are 
being successfully implemented in the Soviet Union. 
Everybody can realize that precisely this courageous 
and principled criticism of the cult of personality which 
is being carried out on the initiative of the CPSU Central

Committee is an eloquent proof of the force and the solidarity 
of the Party and the Soviet socialist system. Only a Party 
educated in the spirit of Marxist-Leninist teachings, a 
Party serving the people and linked with and supported by 
the people can permit itself to take such an open stand. 
Not one of the leading parties of the capitalist countries 
has and will ever risk such a step on its own initiative. 
The decision of the CPSU Central Committee shatters 
the slanderous (whispers?) of the inimical ideology which 
has tried to show that the appearance of Stalin's cult of 
personality was caused not by certain historical conditions 
of the past but by the very Soviet system. 
How absurd this slander is, is proved by the entire his-
tory of the development of the Soviet state. Led by its 
Communist Party, the Soviet Union has traveled a glorious 
road, a road which it built by overcoming the greatest dan-
gers and difficulties. 
Despite an economic, cultural, and technical backward-
ness of centuries, and under the conditions of a fierce 
fight against class enemies at home and abroad,,. the Soviet 
people built eocialipM, (and?) carried Marxism-Leninism to 
victory. 
The Soviet socialist system has amply proved its 
superiority by the unprecedented rate of its economic and 
cultural development. All this was possible because the 
Soviet system put into motion the inexhaustible forces of 
the people's masses, gearing the millions of people to the 
conscious leadership of the state, to creative, active par-
ticipation in the building of socialism. No isolated per-
sonality, however strong he may be, can change the nature 
of such a profoundly democratic system in which the decisive 
force is the working people's masses of millions. 
Only by an idealistic aberration, by denying Marxism, 
by denying the truth can (they?) come to the conclusion that 
the nature of a social-political regime is determined by 
something other than the manner of production, and the posses-
sion of the means of production and the political power of 
the class.

The socialist manner of production was established 
in the Soviet Union almost 40 years ago while the power 
rested in the hands of the working class and the peasantry. 
This explains why the evil done by the cult of personality 
in the leadership of the various branches of the Soviet 
Party and state did not and could not divert the develop-
ment of Soviet society from the correct road of evolution 
toward Communism. 
This explains why the decisions of the 20th CPSU Con-
gress regarding the liquidation of the consequences of the 
cult of personality and the reestablishment of the Leninist 
norms of Party life, and the development of socialist demo-
cratism are being carried out with so much success. 
The CPSU Central Committee's decision rightly stresses 
that the entire international communist and workers move-
ment considers the fight against the cult of personality 
and its consequences a struggle for the purity of the prin-
ciples of Marxism-Leninism, for a creative approach to the 
solution of international problems, and for the establish-
ment and the ceaseless development of the principles of 
proletarian internationalism. Not only the militants of 
the workers movement, but all working people devoted to the 
cause of peace admit the great historical merit of the 
Communist Party of the Soviet Union in the implementation 
of the decisions of the 20th Congress. 
Our working people led by their Party on the road of 
building socialism feel profound gratitude to the gigantic 
contribution of the CPSU and the Soviet Government in the 
victory of the common cause of socialism and peace.

ALBANIA 
Zen i Popullit, A July (as broadcast by radio) 
The reaction concerning the discussions of the 20th CPSU 
Congress is still being observed throughout the world. The 
decisions have been approved everywhere by all the Communist and 
workers Parties, workers, and millions of people. The Congresst 
most (important?) theses concerning the international situation, 
the development of communism in the Soviet Union, and the 
respect of Leninist principles by the Party in connection with 
the liquidation of the cult of personality have opened great 
prospects for the future of mankind by giving a new impetus to 
the revolutionary movement in all countries. 
Undoubtedly these theses brought about reaction in the 
camp of our enemies and .a new propaganda of lies about a so-
called socialist crisis. However, nothing can stop the dis-
semination of the great ideas of this Congress. Moreover, it 
should be admitted that we are still in the early stages. Only 
4 months have passed since the Congress. However, this period 
revealed the great and vital force of its decisions for the 
international communist and labor movement, for the struggle of 
all the progressive forces for consolidating peace in the world, 
as stated in the decision of the CPSU Central Committee regarding 
the excesses of the cult of personality and its conseqUences0 ? 
carried by our press yesterday. 
The June 30 decision of the CPSU Central Committee thoroughly 
reviews the reaction in all countries brought about by the great 
problems debated at the 20th Congress and minutely analyzes the 
results of the reaction of the first phase. 
, The decisions of the 20th Congress and the measures for 
their implementation, the latest decision of the CPSU Central-
Committee emphasizes, reveal a wholly principled attitude on a 
series of problems and (several words unintelligible--Ed.). 
Great results are being achieved even now. These results 
demonstrate the force of the decisions of the 20th Congress 
which in the future will enliven the movement for socialism, 
democracy, , and peace to auch-an extent as never has been seen.: 
before.

people. Now it exercises great influence in the development 
of the international situation. The people link closely with 
the 20th Congress the obvious results in the easing of inter-
national tension, the dissemination of the idea of peaceful co-
existence, and the revival of hopes for prevention of war at 
the present time. It may well be noted that no other socialist 
ideas had such a drawing power and exercised such great influence 
over the working and progressive movement in the world as did the 
decisions of the 20th Congress. 
This is what alarms and disturbs.the camp of the enemies 
of socialism. It is not without purpose that the bourgeois 
propaganda is making so much uproar about the Stalin cult and 
it consequences, its intention is to obscure all other matters 
and, by condemning the cult of Stalin, to create the impression 
that there is confusion and lack of unity among the inter:-
national communist and workers parties, and to minimize Soviet 
prestige. 
? It is true that the attempts of socialist enemies in this 
purpose are gr9at and--despite the fact that they have received 
the answer they deserve and they-A-lave been and are being un-
masked--the matter should not be underestimated. On the contrary, 
Vigilance must be strengthened and we must step up our fight 
against them. 
It is a fact that during this period certain persons in 
certain People's Democracies--awaiting the most favorable 
moment to attack the Party--appropriated the lies of the hostile 
propaganda and, screening themselves behind the slogans of the 
20th Congress, attacked Communist and workers parties and their 
leaders and lied about the Soviet Union and the socialist 
system.

Indeed, was it not the same thing which certain hostile 
elements who dared raise their heads at the Tirana Town Party 
conference but who received the answer they deserved by the 
Party also wanted to do in our own country? It is a fact that 
often wrong interpretations are made in connection with certain 
matters of the cult of the individual. However, one thing is 
clear, the bourgeois propaganda aimed at disturbing the people 
is losing ground and the principle of condemning the cult of 
the individual is getting stronger every day. 
The decision of the CPSU Central Committee systematically 
Unmasks bourgeois propaganda theses in connection with the 
distortion of the question of the cult of personality. Thus 
it showed that the bourgeois propaganda purposely does not 
mention the fact that now the question of the cult of the 
individual is a past thing in the life of the Soviet Union 
and that during the past 3 years the CPSU carried out a deter-
mined struggle to liquidate the cult of the individual and its 
Consequences. 
Hostile propaganda tries to raise questions such as: Why 
was the question of the cult of the individual raised now? 
This was done in order to create skepticism about the sincere 
and Courageous self-criticism carried out at the 20th Congress. 
Asking how the cult of the individual arose, hostile propaganda 
pretended that the cult of the individual was broUght about by 
the socialist system itself which, therefore,. 18 not 'a democratic 
system and so forth. 
However, the June 30 decision of the UST-Central Committee 
fUily unmasks these slanders of bourgeois propaganda on the ' 
basis of the facts of life itself. There could be nothing more 
false than saying that the cult of the individual did not spring 
up as a result of the prescribed historical conditions through 
which the, Soviet Union had to pass and stating instead that it 
arose because of the socialist system which allegedly 115 not 
democratic. 
Where else can more be spoken of genuine democracy than in 
socialism where the means of production are the people's common 
property and the regime JO in the people's hands? In socialism 
the people have the means of production in their own hands: as 
well as the government, thus-creating the broadest possible

democracy of their own, while in capitalism neither the pro-
duction means nor the government are in the hands of the 
people and in this way there is no democracy for them. This 
is true. 
By its condemnation of the cult of the individual and its 
consequences in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies, 
the CPSU Congress also condemns the violation of socialist laws 
and takes measures to strengthen the democracy of the people--
the real masters of the country. 
However, no comparison can be made between our socialist 
democracy and their bourgeois democracy since these differ as 
day differs from night. It also should be said that there is no 
more vain hope than thinking that by raising questions and 
various doubts the trust of communists and workers in the CPSU 
and first socialist country in the world will be threatened. 
Attempts to isolate the Soviet Union, continues Zen i I 
Popullit, began with the existence of the Soviet Uniarga?
attempts to divide the international workers and Communist 
movement also began with its existence. These attempts will 
continue for many years to come. However, to try is one thing, 
and to succeed is another thing.. The enemies of. socialism will 
never achieve this aim because Socialist countries are united 
by the eternal Marxist-Leninist ideas and because their own 
historic experience has taught them that their strength lies 
in their unity--their guarantee for the victory of socialism. 
and communism. 
Therefore, all the activities of our enemies are doomed 
to failure. Our solidarity is getting stronger every day. The 
unity around and trust of all socialist countries, Communist ' 
and workers parties, and working people throughout the world for 
the Soviet Union is increasing. However, we must increse 
vigilance in order not to leave any gap through which the 
enemies of socialism may enter their wedges to harm 1.114 be it 
ever so little. 
Our Party has taught us to draw lessons from the CPSU. 
The historic decisions of the 20th Congress exercised great 
influence in our country. They inspired all preparations for. 
our Third Congress and all our Congress directives and decisions 
:were guided by the 20th Congress. Currently the 20th Congress' 
decisions show us the way to fulfill the tasks and directives 
of our Third Party Congress.

Our Party also at once noticed and unmasked the maneuvers of 
the enemies of socialism, punished Party enemies who dared raise 
their heads on this occasion, unmasked the deceitful bourgeois 
propaganda and never allowed a split in its ranks or attacks 
against and criticism of the Soviet Union, our friend and 
,liberator. Our Party never allowed distortion of the cult of 
the individual. It took serious measures to liquidate the cult 
of the individual and its consequences; our Party will persist 
in this policy. 
Our Party is learning valuable lessons from the recent 
decision of the CPSU Central Committee on the excesses of the 
cult of the individual and its consequences, enabling it to 
fight even more effectively against the slanderous propaganda of 
the bourgeois ideology, persistently explaining anything con-
nected with the problem of the cult of the individual, liquidating 
any attack against the Party and unity of the world communist 
and labor movement, consolidating vigilance against the enemies 
of socialism, and preventing enemies from sowing confusion in 
our own ranks or violating our friendship and ties with the 
Soviet Union. 
At the same time, Zen i I Popullit concludes, our Party 
will continue to respect consistently the lofty principle of 
our Party recognizing the people as the creator of history.. It 
will implement strictly the Leninist rules in the Party, will 
strengthen internal democracy in.the-Party and democracy for 
the people, and will march forward toward the country's socialist 
construction built on the basis defined by the Third Party 
Congress.

Nuovi Argomenti, No. 20, May-June 1956 
The condemnation by the present Soviet leaders of cer-
tain aspects of Stalin's policy, more particularly, of his 
method of political leadership, represents, in my opinion, 
merely a concession to the growing discontent of the great 
masses of workers and farmers and of the federated peoples 
of the USSR. In the Soviet Union a profound political 
crisis is undoubtedly in progress, which expresses the 
constantly sharper contrast between the grandiose develop-
ment of the productive forces and the backward forms of 
the dictatorial state, quite inadequate to express the 
needs of society. In short, it is a crisis of the totali-
tarian regime at its foundations. 
Faced with this crisis, the Soviet leaders have used 
Stalin as a huge scapegoat. However, neither the condem-
nation of the Cult of personality, nor the rehabilitation 
of thousands of innocent persons "liquidated" as traitors 
and enemies of the people, nor the abandonment of the 
coarser forms of political and cultural oppression which 
were in favor during the Stalin era can, naturally, solve 
the basic political problem which lies at the root of the 
/crisis of the Russian state. These are palliatives of 
scant real value, even if announced with great demagogic 
skill. Whether the Russian dictatorship has a personal or 
collective political leadership, its anachronistic nature 
will certainly not change. Sooner or later, we shall wit-
ness new clamorous episodes of the substantially unsolved 
crisis. 
I do not think that the parliamentary politiCal form 
of Western type is the only one which can be considered 
legitimate from the democratic point of view, nor do I 
think that it is the best or the most adequate political 
alternative to the present Russian dictatorship. However, 
.I am also convinced that no regime deserves to be character-
ized as democratic so long as it excludes multiplicity of 
political currents, their right to express themselves freely 
in the press and in public meetings, and their right to 
designate their own men of trust for elective offices. The 
pseudo-Marxist declaration that there can be no diversity 
of opinion or political choice where there are no contrasts

of social classes is a ridiculous sophism, all the terms 
of which are false. It is precisely the enforced absence 
of opposition newspapers in the country, of opposition 
currents within the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, 
and of opposition tickets in elections which gives a 
fictitious character to all the "democratic" formulations 
contained in the Stalin Constitution of 1936. 
There is a difference of political language not only 
between West and East but also among citizens of the same 
city, according to their differing concepts of politics or 
of social life in general. Thus, as is known, for our own 
Fascists and the Nazis, although they were Westerners, op-
position was treason and discussion was deviation, or heresy, 
as it is called by the Catholic Church. The diversity of 
political language, then, does not have racial, ethnographic, 
or climatic origins, but is the difference between closed 
societies and open societies. Here it can naturally be 
asked why closed societies prevail in certain regions and 
in certain epochs. 
, Even Russian civilization is of European and Christian 
type, but somewhat less differentiated than the West. 
Russia did not have the separation of church and state. 
Ivan the Terrible knew that it was his duty "not only to 
hold the reins of power but also to save souls." Russia 
had neither a Scholastic philosophy, nor a Reformation, nor 
an independent lay thought (it did not have a St. Thomas, 
a Machiavelli, or a Galileo). Russia had no free munici-
palities or cities, except in the limited area of the Baltic. 
Russia has never had a freely elected parliament or a parli-
amentary government (the Duma had only a consultative char-
acter), nor free trade unions of workers, nor cooperatives 
administered by the members themselves. The socialist move-
ment there was almost always clandestine. Such a tradition, 
no doubt, makes the budding and flowering of democratic 
forms particularly difficult; but what is incomprehensible 
is why a typical exponent of such a backward cultural situa-
tion, like aldanov, was accepted as a guide and censor even 
by Western writers and artists. 
In spite of everything, I do not believe in fate, and 
even less in the inevitability of terror. I do not believe 
that there are any situations with but a single mode of exit. 
I do not believe in the sanctity of accomplished facts. If

I can admit that, under given circumstances, terror is in-
dispensable for the political schemes of the tyrant, I 
deny that it is necessary for his victims. 
The fact that the Communists of the entire world be-
lieved, at the time, in the Stalin version of the trials 
and conspiracies just as they believe today in the official 
condemnation of those Monstrous deeds by Stalin's successors 
is one of the many irrefutable proofs that the Communists 
of the entire world have been kept under the blindest obedi-
ence to the Moscow leaders. The so-called "Italian way of 
Communism," practiced by the Communist Party of Italy since 
the liberation and credited to Palmiro Togliatti, seems to 
contradict such a crude assertion, but only in appearance. 
It is sufficient to remember that the fate of the individual 
European countries after the liberation was decreed in the 
meetings of the Big Four at Yalta and Potsdam. Italy, 
along with the other countries of the West, was then aban-
doned by Stalin to Western influence, in exchange for the 
disinterestedness of Churchill and Roosevelt in the fate 
of the countries of Eastern Europe. The Communist Parties 
of Italy and France had to make a virtue of necessity; any 
foolishness in a contrary direction was vigorously repressed 
by order of Moscow, just as Stalin himself sent the rebel 
Markos to Siberia. Thus the "Italian way of Communism" was 
also a Stalin way. 
Many reports lead one to suppose that an internal relax-
ation of tension is now going on in Russia, but it is per-
haps premature to say that a new politicalphase has opened. 
A decisive turn will be able to take place only when an im-
portant political disagreement is publicly reported and 
presented for discussion in the Communist press before being 
solved in a meeting of the party and the state, without the 
minority's being threatened with extermination. 
The vast area, with more than one billion inhabitants, 
colored pink on geopolitical maps of the world to indicate 
it as socialist, for purposes of electoral propaganda, is a 
childish concept, a typical survival of the Stalin epoch. 
Among the European countries of people's democracy, and 
between them and their brother peoples situated farther to 
the east, from the Ukraine to North Korea, the differences 
and contradictions are no less profound than among the coun-
tries of the Western Hemisphere. It is not yet possible to

various countries of the two world blocs to regain their 
independence. However, one can feel the duty of declar-
ing that this is very desirable in the interests of peabe 
and democracy. 
Ignazio Shone 
LlUnita, 28 June, excerpt from a resolution of the Central 
Committee of the Italian Communist Party 
The Central Committee of the PCI has been unanimous in 
underlining the great value of the decisions of the 20th 
Congress of the CPSU, and in approving of the denunciation 
and condemnation of the errors and criminal violations of 
Socialist legality and of democracy in the Party and the 
Soviet state. 
Even though the charges and criticisms require a more 
thoroughgoing examination, they represent not only new 
possibilities of progress for the Soviet Union but also an 
essential contribution to the labor and Socialist movement 
which, within the framework of international solidarity, 
is bound to develop in every country with a new capaCity 
for criticism and initiative and an ever increasing autonomy. 
The guarantee of the basic freedoms and of the develop-
ment of the human being is an essential element of Socialist 
society. The Soviet Union will draw new strength and ever 
growing prestige from the full restoration and further 
development of these freedoms and of Socialist legality; 
the struggle for liberation waged by Communists and workers 
in every country will receive a new impetus. 
The Central Committee deems that the extensive and in-
tensive debate which is taking place within the Party) on 
the problems of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, and to which 
Comrade Togliatti has made such an important contribution 
with his interview and his report to the Central Committee, 
must be carried forward in all Party organizations. This 
debate is encouraged because it makes it possible to derive 
a lesson applicable also to our Party, for the correction 
of errors, and for the improvement of our work, while it 
effectively enriches with fresh political and ideological

content the life of our organizations and is translated 
into a more active and solidary participation of all com-
rades in the life and struggles of.the Party. 
?This debate is proof of the Party's vitality and 
maturity and will contribute to developing the capability 
and initiative of all comrades and all.organizations to face 
the great problems arising from the new situation, and to 
contribute to stating accurately and going deeply into the 
themes of our policy and of the Italian road to Socialism. 
This intensive activity of critical examination, of 
investigation, and of ideological elaboration must flow 
together into the discussion preceding the congress and into 
the assemblies and preliminary conventions which will pre-
pare the Eighth National Congress of the PCI.

PRECISELY, THE PROOF!  
(Front-page editorial by P. Nenni published in the 1 July 1956 issue of 
Avantit) 
The article which Avantik published last Sunday and the article on 
the highlights of the last Congress in Moscow, which had preceded it by 
several months, are among those acts of responsibility toward himself, 
toward the Party, toward the workers, which a person who has any degree 
of public confidence cannot shirk without failing the first and foremost 
of his obligations, which is not to be content to establish a fact, but 
to go back to its political, social, and ideological causes, and to ask 
himself how and why it happened and what it means. Thus, in going back 
behind the events denounced in the Khrushchev report to their political 
and ideological causes, we have come face to face with the principle, 
from which we cannot deviate far without danger, that corrections of the 
hereditary deficiencies of political and social institutions, even of 
those which erose in the creative fervor of revolutions, cannot come (as 
.Rosa Luxemburg maintained in her controversy with Lenin and Trotsky) ex-
cept from the active and prompt political life of the masses, outside of 
which everything becomes bureaucratic and corrupt. The Poznan workers' 
revolt reminds us of the same principle, with painful tragicalness -- a 
revolt which caught Poland in the process of thawing out, but which shows. 
also, and tragically, the slowness with which the new exigencies of demo-
cratic development have been faced in the political and economic and 
trade-union fields, and emphasizes the urgency of carrying them forward' 
and radically, without any concession to the temptation or to counsels 
of repression, which does not cure social sores but rather aggravates them. 
The fact that the Khrushchev report has created a "scandal"; that 
our newspapers and those of all parts of the world have interpreted it in .

brought a whole slew of attacks or has given occasion to the people of the 
most diverse education, who have no knowledge of socialism, either ideo-
logically or in action, to take me and us in hand to teach us haw socialists 
behave -- all this has been disregarded. Ue cannot shirk our own duty 
through fear of the criticisms or of the speculations to which we may be 
exposed. The debate which has been begun must continue. The socialists 
and the Communists have much to gain and very little to lose. In time 
we shall tally up the results of the controversy. The urgent thing is 
to answer those who have stated that they are waiting for proof. 
Actually, it is we who have been waiting for proof for some time, 
patiently, with a strong dose of forbearance, but also with the feeling 
that matters cannot remain as they are. 
The proof which Saragat is waiting for us to provide pertains to 
foreign and domestic policy. He says so politely. Others say so rudely. 
In the cleverest and most padded political comments of the past week 
there was, hidden or openly expressed an invitation to jump across the 
ditch, to gain for me and for us an air of bourgeois respectability through 
renouncement of the pledge to push the situation to the left in order t 
join that sort of brotherhood of death which is the so-called democratic 
center. They will wait for quite a whiles 
Today in the world and in Europe there exist the bases for a new 
foreign policy. In Italy there exist bases for a new domestic policy. 
The socialists are ready to cooperate in working out its lines, its ob-
jectives, its programs. Time is lost if they invite us to accept the old 
De Gasperi foreign policy, now that this policy lacks even the apparent 
justification it drew from the danger of war, which, by design or not, 
it helped to stir up. They are wasting saliva and ink if they invite us 
to accept the Shelba's domestic policy, fed by a usanfedistau ( follower

of a politico-religous association which e:ftsted in Southern Italy after 
the French Revolution and was highlighted by the leadership of Cardinal 
Ruffo) and Mc Carthyist spirit, and by conservative fears. Above all, an 
invitation of this type if foreign to the trend of our era, which has 
emerged, perhaps for a long time, from the spiral of hatreds and fears. 
Everything around us is in a state of evolution. Bolshevism is 
evolving, dropping the myths so that the conquests of the revolution 
flourish and develope, a demoggatic reorganization of the entire Soviet society 
Communism is seeking its own read of evolution; at least Italian CoMmunism. 
The balance of power between states is gradually evolving. The balance 
of strength between classes is evolving. Entire continents and vast 
natiOnal groups are in movement, awakening from an ancient lethargy. The 
little Italian political world stands still, observes, baAkwat the moon while 
the caravan passes by, awaits the surrender of the se4a/tsts, while 
everything which has characterized it (this littlewerld) for the past 
years goes out, vanishes, and dies. 
In this regard it is correct that we socialists do not have to abandon 
any of the struggles we have fought in the last ten years: neither the 
fight against the military blocs and the Atlantic (Fact) excesses nor 
the fight against war intvor of neutrality, nor our opposition to 
a domestic policy threaded with provocations and discriminations, nor 
the mass action to exact basic rights of existence and dignity for the 
workers, nor, above all, the campaign for national and international de-
tente. 
The changes which have taken place since 1953, especially in the past 
year, in the international situation and in the situation of individual 
nations did not rain down from heaven. They are the result of the detente 
which we believed in when others denounced it (as they, stia. do) as a trick,

It will be difficult to achieve anything as long as whoever starts 
a discussion with us does not keep this in mind and does not draw its con-
clusions. This fact is known to the internal Christian Democrat forces 
who have pushed and are pushing for a meeting, which we do not claim should 
take place exclusively on our party's terms, yet will never occur if 
based on the principles against which we have fought during the past ten? 
years. This fact is certainly known by the social-democrats, who seek 
activities in common with In in the hope of socialist unity, for which 
(activities) decision of the majority of their party two days ago, which 
practically nullifies the forward step taken on the oGiuntel, problem, 
has caused profound disallusionment. 
At any rate, there is something comical in the row among the center 
parties over who will shoulder the responsibility for writing finis to 
the centrist political alignment. Fanfani blackmails the social-democrats 
with an unloaded pistol, and Malagodi does likewise with Fanfani. If the 
social-rdemocrats proceed along the road they have taken in Milan, if La 
Pira moves straight forward in Florence, if the same goes for Genoa and 
Venice, you can rest assured that nothing at all will happen in Rome, 
and if by chance 4 crisis develops it will not be a catastrophe for any-

even if in the immediate future it (this policy) will be partly conditioned 
by it (the Giunte problem). 
It seems to me that the need for a socialist unity policy springs from 
basic factors; from the end of the threat of a third world war; from the end 
of the terror of a Soviet march to the European Atlantic and the Mediterranean 
which beclouded many minds; from the radical changes which have occurred in 
international disputes, just as are changing the bases of the domestic struggle, 
freed at last from every threat of violent overthrows, brought back--and largely 
because of the socialists--.on the road to natural revolutionary evolution. 
But since big things, big ideas are still influenced by the small, we 
answer those who ask for proof that the things for which we aim are a new 
orientation, a new impetus to Italian society, to the State, an impetus which 
could and can start from the communes, which are the prime and most sensitive 
cell of democratic life. 
In conclusion I would like to call the attention of our comrades, of the 
workers, and of the large portion of the socialist electorate who placed their 
confidence in us a month ago, to the new clear intent of the campaign in Pro-
gress against us which flares up every time we assume new and broader autonomous 
responsibilities, that is, the intent to drive us back to positions of sectarian-
ism, extremist, and osocialcommunist" isolation. 
This is such an open game that I feel it does not fool anyone.

Unrest Gets Above the Surface 
Only one firm conclusion can be drawn 
from the Poznan riots. This is that the 
tentative relaxation of the Stalinist 
tyranny is resulting in sporadic outbursts 
of unrest both in Russia and in the satel-
lite countries. Earlier known cases werel 
the east Berlin disorders of 1953 and 
those in the Vorkuta prison camp in the 
U.S.S.R. itself. This year has brought 
the student riots in Tiflis, the gravity of ; 
which it is hard to gauge, and Thurs-
day's events in Poznan. There may be, 
other cases which are never heard of ; 
in the west. The Berlin and Poznan out-1 
breaks had this in common, that they 
both took place under the eyes of western 
observers. 
That such a determined assault on 
Soviet authority should have been made 
in Poland is true to the character of the 
Polish people. Their acceptance of Soviet , 
overlordship has been more reluctant 
than that of any other satellite country. 
They have been the most restive in;  
pressing for further concessions now that  
the thaw has begun. Poznan, like Berlin, 
has a revolutionary tradition. An indus-
trial town with a university, it has always 
been the centre of a Catliolic-nationalist 
spirit. The Soviet Goiernment has 
thought fit to keep a stronl Russian garri-
son in the vicinity, as htve Polish and 
German Governments inthe past. 
What will be the reactia of the Soviet 
authorities if such incidens continue 
While it may be easy to quell the indi-
vidual outbreak at Poznan, it is clear , 
that this is no mere flash in the pan, but 
rather a symptom of some more general 
stirring. The Soviet Government, having , 
denounced Stalinism and in various ways' 
set out on more liberal paths, will hardly 
be able to stand still The appetite for , 
greater freedom grows by what it feeds 
on. The present rulers of Russia might 
decide to satisfy it in their own country 
at a certain cost, but if they do so in ! 
the satellites they run the risk of for-
feiting the position of strength they have , 
built up for themselves on their western 
frontiers since the war. 
Alternatively, they might decide to I 
scrap their new experiments and revert 
to a policy of Stalinist repression. There 
would be a precedent for this. The 
situation bears resemblances to that in 
1905 when there was a series of outbursts 
against the Tsarist regime which 
amounted in sum to a state of revolution. 
The sequel was the period of authori-
tarian reaction under SroLypiN. It may 
still be possible for the Soviet Govern- i 
ment to follow suit if it wants. It has 
at its disposal all the modern machinery 
of repression. On the other hand,. the 
' idea of a freer life has begun to spread 
among the masses under Soviet rule. 
History would suggest that in the long 
run it may be irrepressible.

Poznan Poser for 
the Kremlin 
By EDWARD CRANKSHAW 
THE Polish leadership has been r 
admitting the existence of , 
serious discontent among the 
workers for some time past. As 
long ago as April the First Secre-
tary of. the Polish Communist 
Party, Ochab (a man with strong 
Stalinist affiliations), said to a 
meeting of party activists in War-
saw: "It can hardly be said that 
we, as the ruling party, have raised 
the standard of living to the level 
required by the workers and at the 
pace we ourseIves envisaged at one 
time." 
The average wage in Poland is 
officially given as 850 zloties a month; 
but in the same speech Ochab 
admitted that in fact "several hun-
dreds of thousands" of workers were 
still earning less than 500 zloties a 
month. On May 20, Zycie Gosparcze 
carried an article complaining of low 
living standards which stated cate-
'gorically "A person who earns only 
1,000 zloties a month cannot make 
ends meet. .. Masses of people live 
in indescribable conditions. 
Long Tradition of 
Independence 
This is the background to the Poz-
nan riots?and to the feeling of ,the 
Polish working class in general : a 
state of seething discontent, acknow-
ledged by the Government, and wait-
ing to flare into the open. The motive 
was economic rather than political; 
but recent political developments 
' have had a close bearing on the 
present situation. 
That the explosion, when it came, , 
occurred at Poznan, was due to a 
number of factors. In the first place 
Poznan has a long tradition of inde-
pendence. It has a strong German 
element, dating from the days of 
Prussian rule, and more than once 
in the past it has defied the Warsaw. 
Government. It is also one of the 
main headquarters of Catholicism; 
and Catholicism in Poland still stands 
for the people against the Govern-
ment. Further, a number of Poznan 
, factories have lately switched from 
armament production to peace-time 
production, and the workers have lost 
the extra wages paid to those engaged 
in the armament industries. 
Real Grievances 
Admitted 
It is fairly clear that the workers 
of the Stalin locomotive works had 
been planning for some time past a 
peaceable demonstration timed to 
coincide with the Poznan trade fair, 
in order to obtain the maximum pf 
publicity. But feelings were inflamed 
by two things ; the arrest of a num-
ber of workers for going on strike, 
and the slamming of the door in the 
face of a workers' delegation sent to 
Warsaw, to lay the case of their fel-
lows before the Government. These 
two events Set the demonstration on 
fire. 
It is not only Poznan, however. 
The seriousness of the general situa-
tion in Poland as a whole is reflected 
in Government statements. In one 
breath the Prime Minister, Cyran-
kiewicz, ascribes the riots to im-
perialist provocateurs and declares, 
that those responsible will be 
punished with the utmost rigour of 
the law; in the next breath he is ad-
mitting the existence of very real 
grievances which he puts down to 
" economic difficulties" and also to 
"mistakes and the incorrect applica-
tion of existing laws." These mis-
takes, he went on to say in a state-
ment which was more of an appeal 
than a threat, will be immediately 
corrected. 
The Polish situation reflects in 
acute form the dilemma of all the 
satellite Governments. The great 
industrialisation programme called 
tor the sacrifice of living standards in 
the Russian manner. The fulfilment 
of this sort of programme is possible 
only through the ruthless applica-
tion of police terror. With the 
easing of Soviet pressure under the 
Kremlin's new look, Poland moved 
faster than any other satellite towards 
liberalisation, and the power of the 
police was curtailed. But the Govern-
ment has not been able to adapt its 
economic programme to the new 
spirit. 
The liberalisation has been real. 
The Poles, always impetuous and 
reckless, rushed to proclaim the new 
freedom, and at the first sign of de-
creasing pressure Polish intellectuals, 
writers and poets immediately began 
to talk at the tops of their voices with 
a lack of discretion which sent shud-
ders down the spines of their friends 
in the West. But nothing happened to 
them, and they went on talking and 
writing, satirising and denouncing the 
system against which, so short a time 
before, no whisper could be raised. 
And when the news of Khrushchey's 
denunciation of Stalin went round, 
the Poles were the first to see that 
everyone knew about it. Nothing 
happened to them. At the most they 
received a discreet warning from 
Moscow not to let things move too 
fast. 
Trying to Walk a 
Tight-rope 
This immunity deafly emboldened 
rebellious spirits everywhere. And 
now the Polish workers have made 
themselves felt. They are not 
Russians, inured to sullen obedience, 
Given a chance, they have proteste4 
against the miserable conditions ot 
their lives. But a line has to be 
drawn somewhere. Economics and 
living conditions, unlike political 
ideas, touch the hatd facts of life. 
The workers of PoZtian are asking 
for something which the Govern-
ment cannot in present cirdumstances 
provide ; more food, better clothes, 
a better life. Ever since the change 
of mood in the Kremlin the Polish 
Government has been trying to com-
promise, to walk a tight-rope, to give 
greater freedom without, the means 
to enjoy that freedom. 
The great decision now lies with 
the Kremlin : a return to repression, 
which would make nonsense of Mr. 
Khrushchev's earnest protestations--
or the granting of more freedom 
and more than the sham of indePen, 
den ce?which would call for a 
decisive check in the forced in-
dustrialisation prograrntne, at the 
expense of existing plans.

RUSSIAN LEADERS EXCUSE THEIR 
SILENCE UNDER STALIN 
Front Our Special Correspondent 
people's democracies are similarly doomed 
,to failure, even though such actions are 
generously paid for out of funds assigned 
by American monopolies." 
The decree, which is dated June 30, closes 
on this note: " No malicious, slanderous ? 
outbursts of our enemies can halt the 
invincible historical march of mankind 
toward Communism." It calls upon all 
party organizations to adhere to the prin-
ciples of Marxism-Leninism, to observe the 
"supreme principle" of collective leader-
ship, and to end violations of the revolu-
tionary Socialist laws. 
In spite of Lenin's warning, Stalin 
retained the post of general secretary and, 
according to the account in the decree, did 
"reckon with the critical remarks of V. I. 
Lenin for a period immediately following 
his death." However, later Stalin began 
ignoring party democracy, called meetings 
of the Central Committee less regularly, 
grossly flouted the Leninist principles of 
leadership, and "in fact, was 'beyond 
criticism." The successes of the people and 
party were attributed to Stalin, and in this 
MOSCOW, JULY 2 
The Soviet leaders who have suc-
ceeded Stalin undertook to-day to ex-
plain why Stalin's errors and excesses, 
which are now subject to constant 
criticism, were permitted to occur. A 
long decree, published in the Communist 
Party newspaper Pravda, explains that 
it was not lack of personal courage on 
the part of the present leaders that per-
mitted the development of Stalin's one-
man dictatorship, known as the cult of 
the individual, but rather a set of 
historical circumstances which made it 
impossible to deter Stalin from mass 
oppressions and other crimes. 
The decree runs to almost 7,000 words 
and is signed by the Central Committee 
of the Communist Party of the Soviet 
Union. Apparently it seeks to reply to 
questions concerning the earlier role of 
Stalin's heirs which have been raised 
by Russians as well as persons abroad 
since the reappraisal of Stalin was begun. 
? CALCULATED RISK 
The Communist Party document declares 
that certain capitalist and imperialist ele-
ments are trying to take advantage of the 
calculated risk of the de-Stalinization pro-
gramme, which was undertaken in an effort 
to release, long repressed initiative on the 
farm and in the factory, by "resorting to 
all manner of tricks and ruses to distract 
the attention of working people from the 
progressive and inspiring ideas the Socialist 
world puts forward before humanity." 
Although the Soviet Union is seeking to 
correct mistakes of the Stalin past and is 
' "doing very much to bring about a relaxa-
tion of international tension?and this is 
; now recognized everywhere? American 
monopoly capital continues to assign large 
sums of money to strengthen subversive 
activities in Socialist countries." 
The decree states that at the peak of the 
cold war the United States Congress appro-
priated $100m. for the purpose-of conduct-
ing subversive activities in Communist 
countries, and that recently another $25m. 
has been appropriated for the same purpose. 
SUBVERSION IN POLAND 
: Such funds, the decree says, have been 
used to stimulate the Poznan riots. "Agents 
provocateurs and subversive elements who 
were paid out of the oversea funds had 
enough go ' in them only for a few hours. 
The toilers of Poznan resisted hostile sallies 
and provocations. The plans of the dark 
knights of cloak Lod dagger have fallen 
through, their dastardly provocation against 
the people's power qi Poland has failed. 
future attempts atsubversive actions in 
atmosphere, the decree explains, any effort 
by the men around Stalin to oppose him 
would not have been supported ' by the ? 
people. 
The decree poses the question which 
undoubtedly has been widely asked in the 
Soviet Union: "Why, then, had not these 
people [the present leaders] come out 
openly against Stalin and removed him 
from the leadership ? In the prevailing 
conditions this could not be done. The ? 
facts unquestionably show that Stalin is 
guilty of many unlawful acts, that were 
committed particularly in the last period 
of his life. however, one must not forget 
at the same time that the Soviet people 
know Stalin as a man always acting in 
defence of the U.S.S.R. against the 
machinations of enemies and working for 
the cause of Socialism." 
The decree stresses that it was not that 
the present leaders had lacked personal 
courage to oppose Stalin. "Any opposition ? 
to him under these circumstance," it says, 
"would not be understood by the people, 
and it is not at all a matter of lack of 
personal courage. It is clear that everyone 
who in these circumstances would come out 
against Stalin would get no support from 
the people." 
Another reason given for lack of action . 
against Stalin while he lived was that 
"many facts and wrong actions of Stalin, . 
particularly in the sphere of violating Soviet 
law, became known only lately, after Stalin's 
death, chiefly in connexion with the expo-
sure of Beria's gang and the establishment 
of party control over the security organs."

SPECTATOR, JUNE 22, 1956 
MEN IN IRON MASKS 
HEN Communist leaders in other countries can 
accuse the reigning group in the Kremlin, and not 
merely those who happen to be awaiting execution, 
both of personal faults and of inadequate Marxism, it is plain 
that strange moves are afoot. Togliatti has now pointed out 
(what was plain enough to non-Communists already) that 
Khrushchev's excuses for his own and his colleagues' failure to 
stop Stalin are inadequate, and that he seems not to have con-
sidered what is at fault in the Soviet system that such a dictator-
ship could arise. Khrushchev is said to have told Nenni that 
he realised these revelations might wreck the French and 
Italian Communist Parties, but they had been made for urgent 
internal reasons. And the soundest interpretation of the secret 
speech is that it was a result of the struggle for power within 
the Party Praesidium. The original attack on the 'cult of 
personality' seems to have been an emergency measure to 
prevent Khrushchev's assumption of supreme power. Khrush-
chev, if this is right, then acted on the old political principle 
'If you can't beat them, join them,' and took over sponsorship 
of the move?several parts of his speech are clearly directed 
against Malenkov and others. (And the struggle continues. The 
Army paper Voyenny Vyestnik has now been heavily counter-
attacked from above simply for repeating Khrushchev's criti-
cism of Stalin's military skill.) 
The speech should not be taken as gospel there is a great 
deal of omission and some obvious falsification. But it at last 
revealed the truth of striking and important political cases 
which have for decades been as much debated as that of the 
Man in the Iron Mask. 
There is a great deal of dynamite in all this which is now 
exploding all through the Communist world. The ruling group 
itself was just that small minority who managed to keep Stalin's 
confidence to the end?a very considerable reflection on their 
characters, as in the case of Catesby, Ratcliffe and Lovell. 
Moreover, Khrushchev undermines the legitimacy of their 
whole succession. He states, for instance, that ninety-eight out 
of the 139 members of the Central Committee elected in 1934 
were shot in the next year or two, and, again, that Stalin ille-
gally expelled Andreyev from the Politburo. The latter has not, 
however, been reinstated, nor have the few imprisoned sur-
vivors of the old Central Committee re-entered public life. 
1 he faisty 0 Khrushchev's position does not escape Togli-
atti, who ill4kes sound points against the Russians. But, no 
more than Khrushchev's speech itself, is Togliatti's statement 
lacking in disingenuousness. On the far periphery of the Com-
munist world America's leading pro-Soviet writer, Mr. Howard 
Fast, is confessing in the pages of the New York Daily Worker 
that he all along knew about Stalinist persecutions in Russia. 
But Togliatti, who was in Moscow as one of the top operatives 
of the Comintern during the whole terror, and saw his col-
leagues arrested by the score, affects to deny all knowledge of 
these things. The pattern is simple. The Soviet leaders blame 
Stalin alone. Those who were a little farther away blame Stalin 
and the Soviet leaders. But the facts were quite adequately 
known, and the rest of us_ are perfectly entitled to blame, as 
accomplices in varying degrees, all members of the Communist 
movement at least down to Mr. Fast's level. Neither the 
Khrushchev speech nor the Togliatti statement shows any signs 
of being due to the sudden rush to the head of a passion for 
objective truth. They must be seen as political manceuvres : 
Khrushchev's as a desperate effort to secure his position against 
the Kremlin's barmecides, Togliatti's as a tentative step to-
wards carving out a fief for himself (perhaps in concert with 
Tito) among the crumbling remnants of the Stalinist ideological 
empire. 
The present leaders both in and out of Russia are using the 
tones of Leninist democracy. These certainly sound better than 
those of Stalin, but, still, we know what Leninist democracy 
was like. Khrushchev's attack on Stalinist terrorism is confined 
entirely to terrorism exercised against Communists. He notes 
with approval that 'Lenin without hesitation used the most 
extreme methods against enemies.' Where Stalin went wrong 
was that he 'chose the path of repression and physical anni-
hilation not only against actual enemies' but also against 
Communists. Such are the limits of the new 'liberalisation': 
Togliatti and Co. see nothing wrong here. 
We may as well note that Khrushchev finally and irrefutably 
justified NATO and the Western atomic bomb programme, 
which some people would have had us drop. For he not only 
revealed that the USSR was only a few years ago ruled by a 
bloodthirsty maniac, but explicitly confirmed that 'the wilful-
ness of Stalin showed itself also in the international relations 
of the Soviet Union' so that 'during Stalin's leadership our 
peaceful relations with other nations were often threatened, 
because one-man decisions could cause, and often did cause, 
great complications.' Nor are we offered any guarantee against ; 
repetition, even if we make the thoroughly unproved assump-
tion, urged on us by the Bevanbrook axis, that we can trust the 
present rulers. So long as the Soviet State is sealed off politically 
and ideologically from its own people and from the world, just 
as its armaments are withheld from UN inspection, we cannot 
check their professions. But if they were trustworthy they 
would have nothing to hide. 
While a threat of disintegration hangs over the Communist 
movement, let us not close our eyes to the danger which faces 
the rest of us. It is quite likely that a modus vivendi will after 
? 
all be reached between the Kremlin and the Togliattis. A more 
flexible, and less obviously anti-national, Communtst enemy 
might be a greater danger than ever to the free nations. In spite 
of occasional anodyne remarks, no Communist has disavowed 
the objective of a one-party world, nor the use of violence and 
fraud, of 'extreme methods' in fact, to bring it about.

TIIE ECONOMIST, JULY 7, 1956 
Trotsky to the Pantheon? 
THE communist dialogue is in spate. Prodded by western 
communist interventions, Pravda has had to publish 
a diluted version of Mr Khrushchev's secret speech. This 
is really the main purpose of the lengthy official declaration 
explaining the attacks on the " cult of the individual." 
Moscow now claims communist approval from Peking and 
Paris for its new line, but denies Signor Togliatti's charges 
about signs of degeneracy in Soviet society. Stalin's heirs 
must also defend themselves against accusations of com-
plicity in their master's crimes. Their defence is twofold. 
On the one hand, they now put more stress on his positive 
achievements and also on Russia's encirclement; who, they 
ask, would have understood them if they had sniped at 
the commander of a besieged fortress ? At the same time 
they hint that during the war a "Leninist nucleus" of 
soldiers and politicians did by-pass Stalin's orders. This 
distinction between more and less " Stalinist" members 
of the central committee. may well foreshadow further 
removals from the leadership. 
Revelations succeed one another at an unexpected pace 
and little can now be kept behind closed doors for long. 
Lenin's testament, one of the eighteen documents which 
Mr Khrushchev apparently released during the secret 
session of the congress to explain his attack on Stalin, has 
now been published in Kommunist, the theoretical organ 
of the party. The "testament " is a document in which 
Lenin outlined the prospects for the party and his assess-
ment of its leaders, foreshadowing a clash between Stalin , 
and Trotsky. His tribute to both was tempered by criticism 
of their main weaknesses. The appendix to the testament 
is a subsequent letter in which Lenin requested Stalin's 
removal from the key post of secretary-general. This this 
Russians can now read, and the release must be followed I 
quickly by the publication of other restricted texts circu-
lated by Khrushchev. These include Lenin's final violent 
outburst against Stalin's treatment of minorities and his ' 
letter asking Trotsky to lead the attack on the Russifying 
Georgian in that debate. 
New evidence and fresh disclosures seem to be forcing 
Khrushchev's hand in permanence. He wanted to keep the I 
change gradual and discreet, but was immediately forced 
into the open. He began his criticism of Stalin in the name 
of the Stalinist faction, and still defends his master's early 
years; but now, in the face of Lenin's judgment, many will I 
ask him and his colleagues whether they were not backing I 
the wrong man and the wrong line from the very start. Who 
could have said a few months ago that Lev Davidovich 
Trotsky may end up in the Pantheon of the Soviet I 
revolution? Not Mr Khrushchev.

THE ECONOMIST, JULY 7, 1956 
Lessons of Poznan 
ARSHAL TITO'S reconciliation with Moscow and the revolt 
in Poznan are related events, two manifestations of the 
change that has been at work throughout the Soviet orbit 
since Stalin's death. Tito's visit to Moscow illustrates the extent to 
which Stalin's heirs have revised not only their master's methods of 
dealing with smaller communist countries, but also his very concept 
of what a satellite should be. The Poznan rising is evidence of the 
explosive forces which such a revision can release. 
At the height of the cold war, from 1949 onwards, the very mention 
of a country's "own road to socialism" was a punishable crime, 
branding the bold spokesman as a traveller on the heretical road that 
led to Belgrade. With President Tito's visit to Moscow, Titoism has 
ceased to be a heresy. True, it never at any time involved the scrap-
ping of communism or the abandonment of one-party rule. It would 
be wrong to see, in Jugoslavia or in eastern. Europe, an evolution 
towards any political system remotely acceptable to the liberal ideas 
of the west. Titoism was, rather, a national revolt against Moscow's 
orders which broadened out into a rejection of the dictation of ideas 
by Stalin. 
By how much has the situation changed since Stalin's death? The 
communiqu?ublished at the close of the Moscow talks accepted 
Titoism as orthodox, and actually made it a heresy to question the 
concept of "own roads to socialism." In recent months Mr Khrush-
chev and his colleagues have apparently been urging the eastern 
European leaders to seek their own remedies and solve their own 
problems. Yet, scarcely had Marshal Tito on his way home left 
Bucharest?once the Cominform seat from which the denunciation 
' had come, his visit thus marking symbolically the end of the schism 
' ?when the Poznan cannonade began. 
For. eastern Europe the dismantling of Stalinism is really a dual 
process. The countries are groping aft er their own identity, while 
simultaneously throwing the fetters of Stalinist doctrine on to the 
historical scrap-heap. The forces unleashed by the "thaw," as this 
process has come to be called, have never represented as great a threat 
to the foundations of Soviet society as to the communist regimes of 
eastern Europe, for reasons which are obvious. Although the cloci-
trine of the Russian revolution came from the west, the revolution 
itself came from within Russia, and it has lasted nearly forty years 
already. During this period Russian society has been torn apart and 
reshaped, and new generations brought up to whom the status of 
the free, property-owning peasant is as little known as that of the 
, landlord or the merchant.' In eastern Europe, though it could rely 
on degrees of support which varied from one country to another, 
the revolution was not an indigenous force but a ready-made product 
imported in the luggage of the victorious Soviet Army. '(President 
Tito's position as a successful resistance leader was quite exceptional 
and largely explains his strength.) The last tzu years have not been

enough to uproot all remnants of the past, all old con-
victions and longings. Over wide , areas the Catholic 
Church still claims the allegiance of a large part of the 
population. The land, except in Bulgaria, is still largely 
in the hands of peasant smallholders suspicious of a 
regime philosophically committed to their elimination. 
The Poznan outburst has now shown that the industrial 
working class is not immune from discontent, either. 
Poland has a long romantic tradition of desperate 
struggle in seemingly lost causes. Yet this is not the 
Oily reason why the first explosion should have taken 
place there. Poland is the best test-tube for the study 
of the metamorphosis of a satellite, because it is there 
that the experiment has gone furthest. Throughout 
the postwar period Polish Communist rulers, heirs of 
leaders executed in Stalin's jails, showed a greater reluc-
tance in carrying out Moscow's orders than did other 
satellite bosses. Rajk, Kostov and Slansky had been 
executed, but the rehabilitation of Wladyslaw Gomulka, 
!lie disgraced Polish party secretary, did not have to 
be posthumous. When Stalin's heirs gave the signal 
to relax the discipline, the Poles began to move forward 
with a singular enthusiasm. The rejection of Stalinism 
provoked a greater intellectual ferment there than else-
where. The Polish Communist party suffered an 
apparently genuine fit of conscience which led it into 
violent condemnations of its own hypocrisies in the past. 
Writers, after years of euphemism, dipped their pens 
in black ink to describe the seamy side of a People's 
Democracy with such gusto that Polish newspapers 
have lately been kept off the news-stands in Prague, 
Sofia, and Bucharest. 
The whole trend seemed to develop with official 
blessing. The Sejm (parliament) was allowed to raise 
, a critical voice; imigrZs were invited back; the AK?
the resistance movement directed from London during 
the war?was rehabilitated. Thousands of prisoners 
were released by a mass amnesty, while the UB?the 
security police?was attacked for violating " socialist 
legality," its chiefs sacked or imprisoned, and its hold on 
the population greatly weakened by persistent criticism 
, of its abuses both from above and from below. A new 
reign of freedom was being proclaimed from the house-
tops, but the economic measures to quieten the result-
ing expressions of discontent were taken belatedly and 
could not, in any event, keep pace with the political 
wave. Workers may well have read in all these signs 
the permission to stake their demands bluntly, and 
opponents of the regime a chance to precipitate a crisis. 
That the first outburst should have taken place in 
Poznan itself, in the Polish west, is somewhat more 
perplexing. Poland may have a tradition of insurrec-
tion; bloody clashes with the police were not unknown 
before the war; but Poznan is not the heir of that 
tradition. This stolid city, so long in Prussian posses-
sion, was a stronghold of the right-wing National 
Democrats, and its labour was far from being a social-
ist vanguard. Anti-German feeling, ingrained by his-
tory, formed a link between this region and the 
communist government. At the same time the pros-
perous, westernised population of Poznan probably 
resented the economic disorder and the ensuing short-
ages more actively than any other. The spark was 
apparently given by a blundering revision of work 
schedules, amounting to a cut in earnings. Was the 
patience of the Poznan workers really exhausted and the 
revolt an expression of blind, uncalculating despair, 
or did a peaceable demonstration for the righting of 
grievances get out of control? It is for the moment 
impossible to disentangle a clear answer from the con-
flicting evidence. Yet, whoever pulled the trigger, the 
communists themselves candidly admit that " legitimate 
grievances of the workers " made the rising possible. 
The communist government will obviously seek con-
solation in the special character of Poznan and excuses 
in "the work of foreign agents". But when the pro-
letariat deserts a " proletarian dictatorship ", Marxist 
rulers must ponder seriously the real reasons for the 
discontent, and its extent. It is not easy from outside 
to measure the standard of life in eastern Europe or 
to draw precise comparisons with the prewar level. 
The Poles claim that consumption a head of foodstuffs 
and other consumer goods is higher now than before 
the war. At the same time they admit that real wages 
have risen only imperceptibly since 1950, that acute 
shortages are being felt, and that many wages are still 
little above the starvation level. One possible explana-
tion of the contrast between certain claims and the 
known facts of poverty and dissatisfaction may lie in the 
extremely rapid growth of the urban population 
throughout eastern Europe. Poznan itself has now 
375,000 inhabitants against 275,000 in 1939. Peasants, 
come to town, acquire new tastes ; their pressure on the 
supply of consumer goods grows quickly heavier. 
But the growth of the urban population is only one 
aspect of the rapid industrialisation on the Stalinist 
model which eastern Europe has shared with the Soviet 
Union, and of which the industrial workers have prob-

ably had to bear a large part of the burden. Massive 
investment, the stress on heavy industry and since 1951 
on defence, overcrowding, high food prices?all these 
had to be paid for industrialisation at breakneck speed. 
This was the economic basis of Stalinism in Russia. 
The cast European leaders have been trying to change 
their Stalinist political edifice without adapting its 
economic foundations. 
What next ? Has the new wave sweeping through 
eastern Europe been broken on the Poznan dam, and 
will it now recede ? Prophecy is a difficult art, but 
some lessons can be drawn from the precedent of 
Berlin three years ago. The parallel between the two 
events is striking: in each case the revolt followed 
quickly upon the first signs of relaxation, and in each 
it was a blunder over wage-rates that precipitated the 
_ 
storm. In Berlin after the June rising of 1953 a,clear 
attempt was made to put the political lid back on. Now, 
too, the advocates of going slow in dismantling the 
Stalinist empire, whether in Budapest, Prague or 
Moscow, will seek in Poznan an argument for their 
case and for the maintenance of a strong grip by the 
security police. Yet, even in eastern Germany the 
economic concessions were maintained and the current 
of political relaxation reasserted itself. 
Mr Cyrankiewicz, the Polish premier, has declared 
that the process of " democratisation " will go on un-
abated. Something may well be set in motion immedi-
ately to relieve the economic grievances. Poland alone 
of the countries of the Soviet bloc has not yet pub-
lished its new five-year plan ; there may still be an 
opportunity to shift the balance of economic effort in 
the consumer's favour. Events may force other 
countries as well to revise their integrated plans in the 
same direction. Nor need the political process be 
arrested. The partisans of the new line, arguing that 
what is required is more and not less of the same 
medicine, may continue to carry the day, leaving 
Poznan as a tragic reminder of the risks involved not 
only in establishing, but also in relaxing, a dictatorship 
and an empire. 
Whatever shape the transformation should take, the 
West can no longer view it with the mental rigidity 
born of the earlier phase of the cold war. Then, when 
the countries of eastern Europe were being moulded 
to the same pattern and thrust into the Stalinist strait-
jacket, it was convenient to lump them together as 
Moscow's satellites. Now that the strait-jacket is being 
lifted the behaviour of each east European country 
must once again be looked at for itself.

THE ECONOMIST, JUNE 30,1956 
Nenni on Liberty 
IT is in Italy that the Khrushchev version has created the 
greatest intellectual ferment. After Signor Togliatti's 
challenge to Moscow, it was the turn last week of Signor 
Nenni. His essay in Mondo Operaio is probably the most 
balanced assessment to have come as yet from a leftist 
political figure. Signor Nenni criticises Mr Khrushchev for 
not providing any historical interpretation of Stalinism and 
shows ?the contradiction between the achievements of the 
Soviet Union and the portrait of the maniac who apparently 
presided over the country's destiny. For him, Stalin's heirs 
cannot find an excuse in terror, because "they had been 
placed in positions of responsibility . . . precisely to face 
difficult situations." Finally, he traces the progressive sub-
stitution of the Bolshevik dictatorship for that of the prole-
tariat, and of Stalin's rule for that of the party, and 
concludes that what Russia now needs above all is a change 
of institutions in the direction of democracy; he thus ends 
with a measured plea for personal liberty. 
What lesson for the future Signor Nenni draws from all 
this is less clear. His essay is not a mere attempt by a 
former Stalin Prizewinner to extricate himself from a 
predicament. He and his party are likely to benefit from 
the new situation. They may well gain from both sides: ' 
the Communist disarray should bring them some fresh, 
support on the left, while their new emphasis on democracy 
? and liberty could win them the sympathy, not only of Signor 
Saragat's Social Democrats, but also of the left wing of the 
Christian Democratic party. How will Nenni manoeuvre.' 
in the circumstances ? He can use his stronger position to 
influence Communist policy. He may also look increasingly 
to his right and progressively relax the "pact of action "., 
now uniting him with the Communists. 
His decision will be fateful for the international working 
class movement. For the moment he merely claims that 
new relations will have to be worked out. The end of the 
Cominform and the dethronement of Stalin mark, in his 
opinion, the end of an era in the international movement 
? as well, and this would indicate that he thinks of creating , 
a new united international rather than of joining the existing 
anti-communist one. Signor Nenni has aces up his sleeve, 
? 
, but nobody can tell whom he will choose as partner in the 
game.

FRANCE 
Franc-Tireur, 30 June-1 July 
Against the back drop of the workers' revolt in Poznan, 
against misery, oppression and totalitarian dictatorship, 
Franc-Tireur publishes today and widely distributes--in 
collaboration with the Socialist Party and its organ, Le 
Populaire de Paris--the extraordinary secret report in 
which, before the members of the 20th Congress of the CPSU 
the First Secretary of the party, Nikita Khrushchev, offi-
cially revealed what we have never failed to denounce: the 
suffering, the oppression, the absolute dictatorship of 
the 20 years of Stalin's reign which weighted down the 
Russian people and the people's democracies, leaving aside 
the sinister effects that worldwide Stalinism had on the 
labor 'movement' everywhere. 
Before deciding to publish and distribute among the 
largest popular audience this tremendous confession by one 
of the old comrades and associates of Stalin we have wanted 
to wait until the authenticity of the report was clearly and 
irrefutably established. We wanted to wait for confirmation 
or else for denials that were sure to come from Moscow or 
from the different Communist parties should the slightest 
doubt exist. 
Now official and unofficial confirmation has come from 
everywhere, first from the US and Great Britain, then from 
Italy where the ex-Stalinist leader Togliatti was forced to 
:discuss the secret report and to pass timid criticism on a 
'collective leadership Which has decided at this time to make: 
a single man responsible for the "errors" and "faults" which . 
,could well have been collective. The confirmation was issued 
by the Italian socialist leader Pietro Nenni who goes even 
farther and places the blame at the door of the system, the 
dogmas, and the methods which made such failures arid crimes 
possible. 
Cautious confirmation has begun to trickle in from OMIlr' 
munist parties and finally from Moscow which is taking 
shelter behind the reactions of certain parties abroad in 
'acknowledging the existence and authenticity of the extra-
ordinary document.

Published and distributed jointly by Franc-Tireur and 
Le Populaire de Paris, organ of the Socialist Party, the 
supplement should reach all socialist workers, all demo-
crats and, we hope, through joint efforts also the long-
abused, misled, and bewildered Communist masses from which 
the party of Messrs. Thorez, Fajon, Servin, etc., has 
painstakenly tried to hide this official testimony from 
the Kremlin, every line, every fact and every reference 
of which must forever doom their lies and servility. 
Let us read this secret official report. Let nobody 
shrink from reading the four pages that we have left intact 
so as to preserve the full impact of the tragic account; 
all we have done is insert a few subtitles some of which, 
in quotes, are exact reproductions of Khrushchev's words. 
Except for some theoretical considerations and allu-
sions to the period of Lenin's life that serve as a sort 
of prologue to the speech but which do not touch the 25 
years of Stalin's regime, the supplement represents the 
full text of Khrushchev's indictment of his old master, 
Stalin the Terrible. 
It is, in fact, the portrait of a modern Ivan the Ter-
rible, a documented and minute description of all the acts 
that Khrushchev-himself repeatedly refers to as monstrous, 
of all the acts that Khrushchev himself calls disgraceful. 
The acting First Secretary of the CPSU and all his 
comrades in the collective leadership well knew this tyrant 
before whom he and they seem to have trembled so long, but 
decided to disclose his true nature and his crimes only 
three years after his death. 
When to the indignation, stupefaction and consternation 
of his audience the author of this report revealed that Stalin 
caused millions of innocent men to be massacred or deported, 
that he displaced whole groups of people, that he fabricated 
out of whole cloth monstrous indictments the mystery of which 
has at last been brought to light, that by physical and moral 
torture ?he made Communists in Russia and elsewhere admit 
imaginary crimes--he did not tell us anything new, he merely 
admitted facts. 
Franc-Tireur had never ceased proclaiming them, the so-
cialist party had never ceased announcing them, all sincere

old Communists, survivors of purges and executions, had 
never ceased talking of them. As our comrades of Populaire  
will remember, Guy Mollet, summed up what French democrats 
were thinking when he said on the occasion of Stalin's 
death: "History will record the harm he has done to the 
labor movement." 
And :16w?sooner than we had expected--the role of his-
tory is taken by Mr. Nikita KhrushcheN/J provisional medium 
of the glaring truth, a valuable, ranking, and irrefutable 
witness, because he was at Stalin's side, who claims today, 
along with the other successors, that he no longer wants 
a "Btalinine" atmosphere. 
Who will henceforth be able to deny the long list of 
horrors and extravagances of the Stalin regime? Who? 
Surely not those who showered fulsome praise on all his 
acts and all his moves and who now wish to go on with the 
business of the day and to make us believe that all is for-
gotten?as if rehabilitation of the dead were sufficient to 
free from responsibility a system that bred the hangmen! 
And what a list it is: What -a table of bloody contents! 
All, that one needs to do is follow the chapters of the report. 
Now Khrushchev himself reestablishes the truth and 
tries to steal a march on history and inherent Justice. 
But history has outstripped him already. Mr. Khrushchev . 
is too late.. The revolt of the Polish workers and peopled 
following the revolt in East Berlin is a sign that perhaps 
history marches faster than is desired by Mr. Khrushchev 
and all those who believe that the faults and crimes of a 
single man can explain and justify everything, and'that the 
cult of personality can be destroyed by putting the entire 
blame on the shoulders of a single person.: 
It is perhaps to the involuntary credit of Mr. KhruShchey 
to have confirmed with so many dramatic trappings what we 
already knew, to have proclaimed the moral victory of truth 
and of liberty, and thereby to have opened the way for the 
most excruciating and simultaneously the most damning revision 
of the great lies and stifling dogmas In the name of which 
was enacted all that the First Secretary'of the-CPSV denounces.

L'Humanite, Paris, 27 Jun 1956 
Our party has rarely been attacked from so many sides. 
Speculating on the conditions under which the Khrushchev 
report was presented and made public and on the emotion aroused 
.by the serious acts for which Stalin is being reproached, 
certain individuals ask us, others advise us, others urge us 
strongly--a question of emphasis--to reorganize our party from 
top to bottom, to turn everything upside down, to renounce 
everything which has contributed to the grandeur and the auth-
ority of our party. Without letup, Le Figaro and L'Aurore, 
as well as L'Observateur? L'Express, and Le Popularre? are 
trying to cultivate the party renegades and traitors, from 
Lecorre to Herve? with the hope that their calumnies will 
have some effect within the party, and with encouragement and 
congratulations in advance to this or that Communist intel-
lectual who is told that he has too much intelligence to 
accept the party line. 
While all the lessons of the 20th Congress of the CPSU 
seem to indicate to us that new steps are being taken forward 
by the international revolutionary movement, it is natural 
that everyone wants us to go backward. Not forward toward 
the magnificant Marxist-Leninist discipline which is sought 
by the CPSU and which deserves authority in the international 
worker movement, but toward an opportunist morass where this 
.movement would be if a new type of workers party (the Communist 
Party) had not appeared in response to an appeal by Lenin. 
The final word is issued by the Socialist press, which is 
leading the way in this campaign. Charles'Ronsac? in an article 
in Demain, fancies that the Khrushchev report and its effect 
on the French Communists "offers the French Socialists a golden 
opportunity to tear the working masses" from the .influence of 
our party. To our daily efforts to form a Communist-Socialist 
united front, Le Populaire responds with a daily anticommunist 
article. Recently reporting a speech about the 20th Congress 
of the CPSU made by a Socialfbt leader returned from the USSR,

Approved For Release 2003/08/11: CIA-RDP78-02771R000200380003-3 
this newspaper writes: "In a speech made to the Tours Congress 
by Leon Blum, he points out that, at that time, the Socialists 
who remained faithful.to the old tradition had the right, point 
of view." 
This is the theme, whether conscious or not, of so many 
attacks on our party. They only make us more attached to our 
Communist ideal. 
Is it still necessary to ask the question, "Who was right?" 
Another Socialist leader returned from the USSR, Andre Philip, 
in order to judge the accomplishments of Socialism there, was 
forced to compare it to his dream of Socialism: Just where is. 
the Socialist Party's Socialism 35 years after Tours? It is 
nowhere. Nowhere does Andre Philip find an accomplishment or a 
work of the Socialist Party to compare to that of the Soviet 
Union. 
And we? We have the USSR. And with the USSR, already a 
whole world system of Socialism, from the Elbe to the Pacific. 
And hundreds of millions of men of all the countries who are 
excited by these accomplishments and who are becoming more 
capable of imitating them. Should one nullify all of this 
under the pretext that errors and faults, mainly those of Stalin, 
were able to affect this impressive totality of victories? 
There is no question of that. It has never been so obvious 
that capitalism is dying. Leninism is living and has no lesson 
to learn except from itself. 
, Is our party in such a state that is necessary to submit 
It to a radical change? The 2 January elections have answered 
that question. It is the first party of the country. It is 
growing in influence and organization. This year it has re-
cruited tens of thousands of new members. Its press ,circulation 
has increased. The Socialist Party leaders--since it is from 
this height that they pretend to judge us--have enfeebled their 
party almost continually since the pre-war period. 
, Which party really shows the way to the working class, to 
the nation if it is not the Communist Party? We congratulate 
ourselves at this time tO see-so many Socialists taking such

welcome positions on so many different points and taking 
common action with us on these points. We are happy about 
what these stands mean, not only on the part of isolated 
militants,,but.by sections and federations of the Socialist 
Party: it is the Socialist Party in its entirety, anxious to 
seek other roads, which will join in common action with our 
party tomorrow. But who has pointed out these ways? Who 
has helped the Socialists discover them.... 
The Socialist Party or the Communist Party? We do not 
make it a question of preference to those who agree to fight 
at our sides, but instead give a proud answer to those who 
censure us. 
These attacks can only lead the Communists to close their 
ranks. They strengthen their confidence in the party. This 
is true particularly of the insults and slander aimed at the 
sorely tried party leaders, particularly Maurice Thorez, whom 
the party is fortunate in having at its disposal for the good 
of the working class and all the country, and who have grown 
as the party has grown. To denounce the cult of the individual) 
which was done in the Soviet Union, the French Communists--who 
have committed, shall we say, only minor sins in this realm--
do not forget the role of men in the formation and continued 
forward progress of their party. The present anti-communist 
campaign finds our party stronger and more united than ever. 
Reactionaries will find it useless to suggest to the Com-
? 
munists that, for them, political courage is to accuse their 
party and its leaders of everything and nothing. Political 
courage, for the Communist masses, is pride in being Communists 
in the face of reaction. And it is because they are confident 
of the merits of their party that French Communists, on the 
eve of their 14th Congress, will work all the more resolutely 
among the masses and among the workers of all opinions to 
form a'united workers front, a new Popular Front, and a 
socialistic. France.

WEST GERMANY 
Freies Volk (Communist), 2 July (as broadcast by radio). 
In answer to open questions, the secretariat of the 
party executive of the KPD sends us the following statement:' 
The bourgeois press has published the unauthorized text 
of a report of the 20th Party Congress of the CPSU, which 
was released by the U.S. State Department and is attributed 
to Comrade Khrushchev. In this connection, members and 
functionaries of our party as well as the public have asked 
a'great number of questions of the party executive. This 
is understandable, since the report deals extensively with 
gross blunders and arbitrary actions committed by Stalin 
in addition to his already known errors and mistakes. We 
shall try to answer frankly and openly all such questions, 
which were asked in honest conviction and out of cOncern. 
Already before the 20th Party Congress, the leadership 
of the CPSU began correcting mistakes which had occurred 
under Stalin's leadership, canceling aribtrary actions of 
the past and restoring completely the Socialist legality. 
The open criticism of the 20th Party Congress, which at the 
same time represented the severest Self-criticism, as well 
as the changes already made guarantee that a repetition of 
similar 'mistakes will be impossible. They express the inner 
strength of the CPSU, its unity, and solidarity. 
:Aside from uncovering the correcting of these mistakes, 
as was done at the 20th Party Congress) the CPSU is now 
faced with the task of ascertaining through a thorough 
analysis how such mistakes were possible. The precondition 
and guarantee for the theoretical and practical solution Of 
this great task are created by the broad discussion of these 
problems in the CPSU and among the Soviet public and by the 
creative initiative of the masses aroused thereby as well 
as by the liberation of science from dogmatism, which is 
closely connected with the cult of the individual. 
.The uncovering of the causes for the mistakes which . 
'occurred in the Soviet Union will be of advantage to those 
countries which are proceeding on .the way toward the 
con-
struction of Socialism. As a result, they will be able in

their own construction work to avoid the mistakes made in 
the Soviet Union. For the KPD and the working class of 
West Germany, too, important' new conclusions appropriate 
to conditions in West Germany will follow from the appli-
cation of Marxist-Leninist science, which will help to 
successfully conduct the fight for peace, democracy, and 
social progress. 
By restoring collective leadership, the Soviet Union, 
during the past years and after the 20th Party Congress of 
the CPSU has attained considerable achievements in its 
foreign policy which is based on the consolidation of peace, 
on the principles of coexistence, and on the desire for a 
relaxation of tensions and for disarmament. These achieve-
ments are the result of the collective policy of the CPSU 
and the Government of the Soviet Union. With their publica-
tion, the aggressive circles want to shake the confidence 
in the collective leadership of the CPSU, in the Soviet 
Union, and in the cause of Socialism altogether. They there-
by hope to counteract the increasing international relaxa-
tion of tensions and the growing power of the workers move-
ment. 
It is no accident that it was the Federal Republic 
which in recent months activated the agitation against the 
Soviet Union in connection with Adenauer's attempt to push 
through general conscription and the further militarization 
of West Germany even against the will of the people. There 
is a close connection between Adenauer's speeches, saying 
that the Soviet Union is the "deadly enemy," the distorting 
assertions about the Soviet Union's German policy, and the 
U.S. State Department's publication of the report ascribed 
to Khrushchev. The West German population is beginning 
to realize that the establishment of friendly relations 
and the development of trade with the Soviet Union are neces-
sary in the German people's own interest. 
The aggressive forces, on the other hand, which expect . 
new business from militarization, see in this development 
a great danger to themselves, since they have always explained 
the accelerated militarization to the people with the alleged 
"threat from the East." This is the reason why.: they Oppose 
the Soviet Union's efforts for further relaxation of tensions,: 
for disarmament and security, which deeds have proven to be 
undeniably honest. This is why--in spite of all proof to. . 
the contrary--they keep up the assertion that nothing has

changed in the international situation and through the cor-
rection of Stalin's mistakes. 
In reality, not only criticism and self-criticism were 
exercised in the Soviet Union, but illegalities and symptoms 
of degeneration alien to Socialism were abolished. In 
doing so, Socialism once more proved its superiority over 
the capitalist system. 
While Socialism has freed itself from the deviations 
and illegalities alien to it, domestic arbitrary actions 
and suppression and aggression toward the outside are the 
characteristics of imperialist reign. 
Contrary to the demands of large segments of the West 
German public, the monopolists and militarists stubbornly 
stick to their policy which harms the interests of the 
people, finds expression in illegalities toward the citizens, 
and finally endangers the existence of our entire people 
and peace in Europe through the threat of another aggressive 
war. As a result of this situation, the Communists in the 
Federal Republic, as well as all those who regard a policy 
of peace, of democracy and understanding the basis for 
German reunification and for an independent German policy, 
find it necessary to oppose the anti-Soviet agitation which 
serves the imperialists to camouflage their antidemocratic 
manipulations directed against peace. 
We Communists proudly state that the KPD always was, 
is, and will be the standard bearer of Socialism, of friend-
ship with the first Socialist state, the USSR, and of the 
proletarian internationalism. We shall continue and strengthen. 
this fight in the interest of the German working class, our 
people, and peace in Europe. 
Although the uncovering of the causes which led to the 
mistakes committed is a task which still has to be solved 
' by the CPSU--and after all can only be solved by the CPSU--
we still believe that in judging these mistakes the develop 
ment of the Soviet Union and its position as the only Socialist 
state during the first 30 years of its history must be taken 
into consideration. The Soviet Union developed as the only 
Socialist state at a time when it was surrounded by a world 
of enemies. The imperialists left no doubt that they wanted 
to crush the first workers and peasants state with all avail-
:able means, including military intervention. No sooner had

the Russian workers and peasants won the victory in their 
own country, when the armed intervention of the imperialist 
powers began. The German imperialists and militarists, 
the imperialistis of Britain, France, the United States, 
and Japan attacked the young Soviet state with their armies. 
Even after this attempt was thwarted, the imperialists 
never ceased trying to start a new war of intervention 
against the Soviet Union. 
From the beginning, the German imperialists played an 
especially aggressive role among the imperialist interven-
tionists against the Soviet power. In 1917, they answered 
Lenin's peace 'offers, the first foreign-political step of 
the new Soviet state, with strengthened military attacks. 
Even after the peace of Brest-Litovsk did they continue 
their invasion of the Baltic states and the Ukraine. 
After the Soviet Union, in the Rapallo Treaty, had de-
sisted from demanding German reparations, thereby leading 
Germany out of her complete isolation, the German imperialists 
had the then Foreign Minister Rathenau murdered and through 
the Locarno Treaty led the Weimar Republic into the anti-
Soviet policy of the imperialist Western Powers. Finally, 
through the person of Hitler they pushed those political 
forces into power which had declared war against the Soviet 
Union and the destruction of Socialism the core of their 
policy. Thus, the German imperialists were always the 
pioneers of that anti-Soviet encircling and invasion policy 
which has brought untold damage to the German people and 
the peoples of the Soviet Union. 
The workers and peasants of the Soviet Union won the 
victory in an economically backward country with a weak 
industry and backward agriculture. As a result of the 
capitalist encirclement, the transformation of this state 
into a progressive industrial and agrarian state became a 
question of life or death for the first Socialist state in 
the world. The Soviet Union had to master this task of 
overcoming the industrial and agricultural backlog through 
its own efforts in an inimical environment and in a short 
time. This was only possible by overcoming great difficulties 
and necessitated the creation of a strong centralized ap-
paratus-

However, the creation of a strong centralized apparatus 
brings about the great danger of bureaucratism and the weak-
ening of initiative on the lower levels. It cannot be 
denied that this fact made it easier for Stalin--who had 
gained great merits in the history of the-CPSU and especially. 
in carrying out Lenin's general plan for the construction 
of Socialism in the country--to increase his personal power.-
He believed that acts which led to the glorification of his 
person and to the broadening Of his personal power were in 
the interest of the Soviet state and the Soviet people. 
Some comrades and Social Democrats ask why the other 
members of the CPSU leadership did not correct Stalin's mis-
takes any sooner. In the past, and especially after Lenin's 
death, Stalin acquired great merits in carrying out the 
general principles established by Lenin against Trotskyites 
and Bucharin followers. Stalin was doubtlessly one of the 
strongest Marxists. Had the CPSU followed the way suggested 
by the Trotskyites and rightists, this would have led to 
the liquidation of the workers and peasants power in the 
Soviet Union and to the restoration of capitalism. It is 
not difficult to imagine today the course of the Second . 
World War and the attack of the Hitler fascists against 
the Soviet Union had not the Soviet Union built up a power-
ful heavy industry in accordance with the generaLparty 
line, and had it not collectivized agriculture, but accord-
ing to the plans of the rightists had instead given priority 
to the development of the consumer-goods industry. 
In that case, the Soviet Union would not have had the 
defense strength with which it could meet the fascist at-
tack and finally smash it. 
According to the reports of the leading comrades of 
the CPSU, the serious mistakes did not begin to show-until 
after the 17th Party Congress of the CPSU. This, however, 
was at a time when the international situation became ex-
tremely critical, when the German fascists and Japanese 
imperialists openly propagated the attack against the Soviet 
Union, when the British and French imperialists tried to 
orient the German, Italian, and Japanese imperialists to-
ward the Soviet Union in their demand for a new distribution 
of the world and attempted to settle the differences in the 
imperialist camp at the expense of the Soviet Union.

Considering Stalin's great authority, the attempt to cor-
rect his errors and mistakes already at that time doubt-
lessly would have led to serious differences and to a 
serious weakening of the Soviet Union's power and authority. 
Such a situation-might have become a grave danger to the 
existence of the Soviet Union before and during the Second 
World War. This also explains the difficult situation in 
which the other leaders of the CPSU found themselves at 
that time and until Stalin' death. 
Immediately after Stalin's death, the leadership of the 
CPSU began correcting his mistakes, condemning the cult of 
the individual and revoking arbitrary measures taken by 
Stalin. The leadership of the CPSU finally openly criticized 
Stalin's mistakes at the 20th Party Congress, disregarding 
the fact that this criticism might be used against the Soviet 
Union by the supporters of the capitalist society. This 
open criticism also warrants a thorough abolition of all 
mistakes committed and proves the intention of preventing a 
repetition of such mistakes in the future. 
We deny representatives of the capitalist society the 
right to express hypocritical indignation about Stalin's 
arbitrary actions for having caused much bloodshed and tears 
among the working masses. They (the representatives of the 
capitalist society--Ed.) unscrupulously destroyed the life 
of a whole city by dropping.an atom bomb, they unscrupulously 
prepare a new atom war, they cause an infinite number of ? 
deaths in order to keep up the colonial system in Africa and 
Asia, they are responsible for the crimes of Hitler fascism, 
and they participated in such crimes. The uncovering of 
the causes which led to such mistakes and which made arbitrary 
actions possible, as well as their prevention in the future, 
are a matter for the workers movement exclusively. 
If we are asked why leading German Communists did not 
any sooner realize the gross mistakes made under Stalin's 
reign, we have to declare: We had no reason to doubt the 
necessity for the severest measures against the imperialist 
agencies, after we ourselves experienced the furious and 
criminal attacks of the reaction at the German workers moVe-
ment and our party. 
We had no reason to doubt that the murderers Of Rosa 
Luxemburg, Karl Liebknecht, Ernst Thaelmann, Rudolf Breitscheid,

and tens of thousands of other German antifascists would 
do everything in their power to organize in the Soviet 
Union, too, the work of enemies of the party, of spies 
and murderers. This is actually what happened, and it 
is still going on today on German territory. To this end, 
agents organizations were set up in the Federal Republic 
and West Berlin, which plan the murders of Social Demo-
crats and Communists (see the murder list of the BDJ) and 
which send agents, spies, and diversionists to the GDR in 
order to disturb the peaceful construction of the German 
Democratic Republic through acts of sabotage, arson, poison, 
and acts of violence, as the fascist riots of June 17, 1953. 
To oppose this was and is at any time the duty of the 
Socialist state. If in doing so the justified and necessary 
defense against imperialist crimes against the Soviet. state 
was transgressed in the Soviet Union, and if the security 
organs committed illegal acts against and infringed on inno-
cent persons, we condemn these events as much as the other 
Communists do. However, those who themselves did and still 
do everything in their power to disturb the peaceful 
Socialist construction in the Soviet Union and in other 
countries have the least right to coMplain,aboUt it. Who-
ever wants to know the root of evil in today's world must 
realize that capitalism is the source of all evil and of 
all crimes of our time. Socialism, however, is the source 
of hope for humanity. Socialism shows humanity the way to 
liberation from the curse of exploitation, national suppres-
sion, and war. Herein lies the world-historic importance 
of the victory of the workers and peasants, first in the 
Soviet'Union and now also in the People's Democracies, 
from the German Democratic Republic to People's China. 
The cannon kings of the Rhine and Ruhr hate Socialism 
not because of possible mistakes but because ? of its vic-
torious strength, because of the liberal and progressive 
spirit which the Socialist theory and practice increasingly 
arouse in the hearts of the West German. workers. It is this 
spirit which the imperialists, these deadly.enemies of the 
working class and of humanity, want to extinguish. That. is 
why they are now crying that a "genuine change" must not 
be confined to eradicating Stalin's mistakes, but that we 
must also turn away from Marx, Engels, and Lenin. How could 
the workers ever turn away from the idea of their liberation, 
after it has already been victorious on one-third of the

earth: How could humanity part with the idea of a future 
truly worthy of human beings, when this is already being 
put into living practice by a billion people between the 
Elbe River and the Pacific Ocean: 
The 20th Party Congress of the CPSU has given all 
nations a new great perspective.- The imperialists will 
not be able to obscure the great fact of the construction 
of Socialism and of the further economic and cultural pro-
gress of the Soviet Union under the Sixth Five Year Plan. 
The 20th Party Congress of the CPSU has shown the nations 
that war is no longer inevitable but rather, that they 
have the power to prevent another war. It has solved new 
important problems in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism. 
Concerning the question of the form of transition to Social-
ism, it was proved that the victory of Socialism in the 
Soviet Union and the coming into existence of a world. camp 
of Socialism in the capitalist countries has created the 
possibility of carrying out the transition to Socialism in. 
a peaceful and parliamentary way. 
The example of the victory of the cause of the workers. 
and 'peasants and of the construction of Socialism in the 
Soviet Union is today--as regard the form--no longer the 
only model for the victory of Socialism in other countries. 
For this reason, it is stated in the declaration concerning 
the relations between the Federation of Communists of Yugo-
slavia and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union that 
both sides take the point of view that Socialism develops 
differently in different countries and under different con-
ditions, and that the fact that Socialism develops in many 
ways contributes to its strengthening. They start from 
the fact that all tendencies to force their opinion regard-
ing the definition of ways and forms of Socialist develop-
ment (on others?Ed.) are alien to both sides. They agree 
that the aforementioned cooperation must be based on complete 
voluntariness and equality of rights, on friendly criticism;
and on the comradely character of the exchange of opinions 
in the disputed questions between our parties." 
For the Communist Party of Germany, too, consequences 
result from the change in the world situation, from the fact 
that the Soviet Union no longer is the only Socialist country 
but that Socialism has gone beyond one country and has teen 
victorious in a number of countries. The fact that Germany

is split and that there exist two German states certainly, 
makes our situation different from that of other countries. 
As long as the Western occupation forces and the ruling 
circles of the Federal Republic stick to the idea that a 
reunified Germany must be included in NATO, the military 
bloc system of the United States, as long as these circles 
refuse to acknowledge that the reunification of Germany is 
a matter for the Germans themselves and that therefore 
negotiations between the governments and parliaments of the 
two German states are necessary, the reunification of 
Germany will be impossible. 
This means, however, that the two German states will 
continue to develop in different directions, since con-
ditions in these two German states are becoming increasingly 
different. In the German Democratic Republic, Socialism is 
being built up. It is in the interest of the entire German 
working class that the construction achievements in the 
GDR prove to the entire German people the superiority of 
the Socialist economic system over the capitalist system. 
The Federal Republic, on the other hand, is a monopolist 
capitalist country, in which the German militarists are 
trying to consolidate and enlarge their position through 
the militarization of West Germany. Without doubt, the con-
struction of Socialism in the GDR is carried out not with-
out difficulties and mistakes. How could this be different 
in view of the especially hard conditions of Germany's 
partition, under which the workers and peasants in the GDR 
have to master the management of economy and state. How-
ever, all the difficulties and mistakes that have occurred 
in the GDR and will yet be made in the future are diffi-
culties in development, which in the process of the ful-
fillment of the economic plans and the full unfolding of 
democratic life will be overcome. Therefore, the future 
belongs to the development of the GDR. 
The KPD and SED separated organizationally already in 
January 1949. The KPD agrees with its sister party, the 
SED, in questions concerning Germany as a whole, for instance 
that Germany must be united on a democratic and peaceful 
basis, that reunification is possible only throUgh negotia-
tions between the governments and parliaments of the two 
German states, and that the achievements of the German 
Democratic Republic must be preserved.

Since, however, the development of the two German 
states is basically different, conditions for the work of 
both parties are becoming increasingly different, and in 
many questions of policy the two parties become also in-
creasingly different. 
The policy of the KPD is determined exclusively by 
its special position in the Federal Republic. As far as 
the KPD is concerned, it is striving for a democratic 
change of the situation in the Federal Republic, the unity 
of action of the working class, as well as the cooperation 
of all antimilitaristic forces in the interest of peace 
and security in Europe as well as for the peaceful solu-
tion of the German question. 
For this purpose, it submitted to the working class 
and to the entire population at the 23rd and 24th assembly 
of the party executive suggestions which it desires to 
develop further and to implement together with all positive 
forces of the people. 
If functionaries of the party find fault with the fact 
that they were not informed in time by the party leadership 
of the serious mistakes and the arbitrary actions committed 
by Stalin, so that the opponents were given a chance to 
surprise the party with their publications, such criticism 
i5 in principle justified.' The secretariat of the party 
_executive and the first secretaries of the Land party 
groups were fully informed on the entire course of the 20th 
Party Congress of the CPSU. The principle questions of 
Stalin's errors and gross mistakes were extensively exposed 
and discussed in the presence of many functionaries of the 
party. However, the secretariat of the party executive 
and the leading functionaries must state self-critically 
that they did not make sufficient efforts to bring about 
the full ,unfolding of the decision within the party and to 
fully clarify for our members and functionaries all problems 
of the 20th Party Congress, including questions connected 
with the cult of the individual and Stalin's abuse of power. 
The attempts of the enemies of the working class to 
revive anti-Communist agitation and to use the necessary 
correction of Stalin's mistakes and errors against the 
Communist Party will consolidate our party even more. Al].

are bound to fail, as they did in the past. The Communists 
will openly discuss all questions in their party units and 
executive boards and will remove all differences of opinion 
and obscurities in free discussion. ,What we need in our 
party is open discussion in order to clarify things this way 
and to bring about unity of action. In this manner, the 
efforts of elements inimical to the party--whose policy has 
long since gone bankrupt--to reach new influence will hope-
lessly fail. 
Clarity about basic questions of our policy, the main-
tenance of unity and solidarity of our party are also the 
indispensable prerequisites for strengthening our enlighten-
ment work among the masses, for establishing community of 
action between Social Democrats and Communists, and for 
developing a broad popular movement against militarization 
and for peace, unity, and democracy. In view of our posi-
tion and our task in the Federal Republic, we must decide 
on the forms of our party work, we must abouse the initiative 
on the lower levels, we must overcome the dangers of bureau-
cratic rigidity and we must strengthen our influence on 
the masses in order to solve the problems of freedom for the 
working people and of social justice. 
Christ und Welt, 14 June, excerpt 
Khrushchev speaks exclusively of the bloody injustice 
done to the members of the Communist Party by mass-mui,derer 
Stalin. There is not a single reference, not even an aside, 
to the infinite suffering inflicted upon the Russian people 
as a whole during the Stalin era. Not a single sentence 
mentions, for instance, that millions died of hunger as the 
victims of the precipitate collectivization of agriculture. 
The concentration camps in which, after all, not only some ten 
thousand Communists are vegetating, but millions of people, 
are also completely skipped in his speech. 
? At one point Khrushchev takes exception. to Stalin's 
having removed complete ethnic communities from the Caucasus 
? during the War. However, he calls this an extraordinary deed 
mainly because all comrades and Komsomol members of those groups 
had to go along with that amorphous move into exile.

A superficial reading of his speech might lead to the 
wrong conclusion that Khrushchev is attacking dictatorship as 
such. Far from it: All 24 columns deal exclusively with an 
internal party strife, i.e., with the fact that Stalin turned 
into a sinister despot in the eyes of the Communists them-
selves. 
Khrushchev is and remains a Stalinist, as far a8 his view 
on the events up to the 17th Party Congress (1934) is concerned. 
He explicitly approves of the elimination of Trotsky,' Zinoviev, 
Kamenev, and Bukharin. He says, to be sure, that murder and 
torture would not have been necessary to accomplish it. Yet 
here lies the real reason why his list of Stalin's mass-murders 
remains so incomplete. Indeed, 7,679 Communists murdered by 
Stalin have been exonerated (most of them posthumously), but 
there are evidently groups within the party and the army which 
will not be exonerated. As far as those groups are concerned, 
Only Stalin's method, not his principle, has been condemned. 
Thus, KhruShchev speaks as the head of a victorious faction 
within the party, the Tito faction, as it were, which finally 
has won the upper hand against Zhdanov.. The speech states 
explicitly that the struggle against the Trotskyites and 
Bukharinites was necessary because both deviations "would 
have led to a renewal of capitalism or to a surrender to the 
world-bourgeoisie." Here Khrushchev is even using orthodox 
Stalinist terminology. 
At one point, Khrushchev comes Very close to the truth 
when he says that the invention of the concept "enemy of the 
people was at the source of all ?the trouble. This concept, 
he says, implied automatically that ideological errors of 
persons arrested needed no longer be proved. A person exposed 
as an enemy of the people must be liquidated automatically. 
Reviewing Khrushchev's endeavor to answer the question 
why the members of the Politburo did not prevent Stalin from 
committing his crimes, Wirsing continues as follows: 
? Khrushchev said that members of the Politburo had given 
active support to Stalin because he was one of the "strongest 
Marxists and his logic and strengthhad influenced the cadre 
of the whole party." And, finally, it had been Stalin who had 
originally held up the banner of Leninism against rightist, 
and leftist deviationists.'

N6 word reveals any insight into the underlying causes 
which had to result in terror. Khrushchev is satisfied with 
the superficial explanation that all this was part and parcel 
of the personality of Stalin. The rest of the world, however, 
is not satisfied with that explanation. After reading the 
secret speech, we know that an indescribable corruption of all 
concepts of law and injustice must have taken place in the 
USSR within the last 30 years. Can that be made undone by the 
pen-stroke of a secret speech? 
However often Khrushchev calls Stalin a brutal murderer, 
we still have nothing else but a rebellion of sons against 
their father, and that goes to say a family affair. Of course, 
the shock caused even in the tiniest Siberian village by the 
downfall of the super-size monument Stalin is likely to have 
unfathomable consequences. However, Khrushchev is trying to 
destroy only half of the monument, as it were. The feet of 
the despot, resting on a pedestal erected by Lenin, remain. 
This fact it is which, more than the disclosure of all the 
cruelties of the sinister Georgian, must concern us. Not 
only with regard to stalin, but more so with respect to 
Khrushchev, is this secret speech a deeply disquieting docu-
ment.

Und Ziel, (Communist) July/August,,Issue (as broadcast by radio) 
Seldom has an event stirred public opinion and, above 
all, the workers. movement as much as the 20th- Congress of. 
the Soviet Communist Party. Even though--as with any big. 
historical event?the actual and real proportions of the 
problems become clearer with the passage of time, the 
phenomena characterized by the term "cult of personality" 
are still in the center of questions, thoughts, and concern. 
Since the moment when we found out that injustice could 
happen inol Socialist state, that Socialist legality was 
violated, and that offenses were possible which are contrary 
to the principles of Socialism, all this has been a burning 
wound in our breast. In view of the superhuman achievements 
and. efforts in the construction of Socialism, we overlooked 
too easily that Socialism is being. constructed by human 
beings, and that with insufficient control human weakness 
can cause. harmful political effects. Socialism is not an 
automatic guarantee for kindness and justice, but only the 
basis on which justice can be achieved and secured in a 
fighting effort. 
One could say now?and occasionally this is being said 
and written?that these were the mistakes of a brother party, 
that these were, after all, not our mistakes. However,- we 
are not satisified with this point of view. We declare. 
openly that we also do not understand those Socialists whose 
sleep is not disturbed bythe fact that a Socialist govern-
ment permits the slaughtering in Algeria of human beings 
who want nothing but freedom for their country. We cannot 
let it suffice to tell those "philantroplsts" who would 
sprinkle pepper into our wounds to devote their efforts to 
fighting for the rehabilitation of the Rosenbergs. For 
Indeed, the witnesses for the prosecution against the couple 
turned out to be police informers, and no atomic scientist 
still believes the lie that the Soviet Union needed reports 
from the Rosenbergs for the production of atomic bombs. 
However, the longing for Socialism is so closely linked 
with the working people's love of justice that the depravity 
of imperialist regimes cannot be a consolation for the fact 
that in the Socialist state the gravest injustice could

happen to innocent people. The only thing which gives U. [5 
strength and security is the fact that the errors were 
recognized, that the offenses became known and were openly' 
proclaimed. Open self-criticism, the criticism of the 
cult of personality, and the firm measures for a democratic 
control of the state security service are the greatest pos-
sible guarantee against a repetition of such things. This 
is the attitude reflected in the words of Karl Marx in 
"The 18th of Brumaire" that proletarian revolutions are sub-
ject to persistent self-criticism, that they fall back con-
stantly on that which has been seemingly accomplished, in 
order always to make a new beginning -after having denounced 
thoroughly and severely all half-measures, weaknesses, and 
wretchedness inherent in-their experience. 
Self-criticism is an essential characteristic of pro-
letarian revolutions and proletarian revolutionaries. By 
saying that errors and offenses were committed it is made 
clear that they were not necessary and could have been pre-
vented. However, simply to answer the question, "how was 
this possible?" with "cult of personality" would amount to 
turning this idea into a new cliche. For even if the ex-
cessive power of a single person furthered arbitrary decisions, 
and consequently the personal weaknesses of an individual 
had grave results, the cult of personality cannot be attri-
buted to one person alone. 
Here one must consider the development as a whole, 
which made possible the cult of personality and its effects. 
One must consider the struggle of life and death which 
the Socialist state had to wage for its existence, encircled 
by capitalist countries, confronted with the enormous task. 
to turn a backward agricultural country into a modern indus-
trial country out of its own power. 
This was a time in which iron discipline was an absolute 
necessity for the change and defense of the country. This 
also made possible the expansion of the state security 
service and its detachment from democratic control. 
To present matters in such a manner as if there had 
never been any imperialist saboteurs and spies, as ifthere 
had been no constant threat of war against the Soviet Union, 
as if the achievement of Socialist construction had not 
been the basic problem of the international workers' movement, 
would mean to agree with those who consider the errors and

Approved For Release 2003/08/11: CIA-RDP78-02771R000200380003-3 
offenses characteristic of the development, who do not con-' 
-older the errors in carrying out the "general line" but 
consider the general line itself as an error. 
However, the decisive thing, the "general line," the 
great political concept, was correct. It led to the con-
struction of the Socialist state, to the destruction of 
fascism, to the establishment of the workers' might on a . 
quarter of the Globe. This would probably have been possible 
in an easier manner and with less sacrifices. It is bitter 
for us to discover that Socialist legality could be violated, 
but it would be foolish to overlook the.fact that these of-
fenses happened in the course of the greatest revolution 
In the history of mankind. 
Particularly, the criticism of the cult of personality 
has reminded us again that great revolutions are not the 
work of particular individuals but, above all, the result 
of the working people and the broad masses who overthrew 
the power of capital, established Socialism, and took over 
the administration of their state and their economy. The 
sudden progress from the pine torch to modern power installa-
tions, from illiteracy to extensive scientific training was 
the result of the participation of millions in the leader-
ship of the state, their fatherland. Grave errors reduced 
the possibilities of Socialist democracy but could not cancel 
them, becausethey did not cancel Socialism. Had it been 
otherwise, would this enthusiasm have been possible, this 
drama of Socialist construction, this vigor of Socialist 
patriotism? Has any other state ever found the strength to 
achieve such victories after such military defeats? 
To try to explain the errors does not mean to excuse 
or belittle them. The revolution is not a delicate work of 
art, said Mao Tse-tung once. It was so the least where it 
was victorious first, where the first state was established 
without and against the capitalists'in a world of capitalist 
states. 
In the course of a great change in the distribution of 
power in the world, new paths toward Socialism have become 
possible, easier paths but not easy ones, for the exploiters 
will never voluntarily give up _their profitable rule. The 
fact that new possibilities have appeared is, above all, due

In the discussion on the problems posed by the 20th 
Congress of the Soviet Communist Party, the question arose 
whether the Communists will not have to reassess their 
position toward the Soviet Union. It was said.. that the 
events have shown that one cannot simply and blindly trust 
the Soviet Union. The proof: Yugoslavia, where we came 
into an awkward situation as a.result of our blind trust 
in the policy of the Soviet CoMmunists. 
No Communist and no Communist Party Is freed of .the 
necessity of independent and critical thinking. We are 
not at all obliged to defend each speech and each article 
from the Soviet Union and each measure of the -Soviet 
authorities if we are not convinced of their correctness. 
The leadership of a Socialist state, too, can make mistakes, 
and even though the collective leadership considerably re-
duces the possibility of errors, it also IS not infallible. 
However, for any revolutionary workers'party it remains ? a 
matter of course not to be neutral in the international 
class struggle and to demonstrate its unswerving solidarity 
with all revolutionary forces, and of course also with 
those who have already overthrown the power of capital in 
their country. 
It is also a matter of course for us that the Socialist 
state, in which this happened the first time, is considered 
the great source of power in the struggle of the workers 
for the victory of Socialism all over the world- It is 
also clear to us that a country, lin which there can be no 
groups and classes to profit from war and to be Interested: 
in war, has always pursued a policy of peace and will con-
tinue to carry out this policy. OUT ties with Socialist 
construction and the Socialist peace policy are therefore 
unconditional, not because we trust the Soviet Union blindly, 
but because we consider it a Socialist state and a Socialist 
power of peace. 
Certainly, we have participated in a grave error as 
regards the attitude toward and the estimate of Yugoslavia 
committed by. the. Soviet Communists, but not because of blind 
trust. The criticism directed against the Yugoslav Commu-
nists by the Communist Parties of the Information Bureau 
in 1948 appeared correct and justified to us on the basis 
of the available material, also on the basis of Yugoslav 
material. The decision of the Information Bureau one year 
later, the slandering of the leaders of the Yugoslav Commu-
nists as fascists, took place on the basis of material

provided by the Soviet state security service, which we did 
not know about. Not knowing these facts'? should we have 
described the resolution as incorrect at that time, in 
opposition to all Communist Parties? We would have scarcely 
achieved more than the splitting of our own party. Thu's, 
we committed a grave error together with the Communist 
Parties and with the Soviet Communists, an error which we. 
are now admitting along with the other Communist Parties. 
We do not think that the chief lesson to be drawn 
from this should be "caution" toward the party of the Soviet 
Union. The open self-criticism of the Soviet Communists, 
regardless of prestige and enemy propaganda, is for us 
another reason for trusting them. We must be more critical 
and more independent in our assessments than tip to now, 
but we must also maintain Unswerving class solidarity in 
the same manner as up to now. 
The self-critical examination of the past, the open 
admission of mistakes and error makes it easier to meet 
the great task with which the workersimovement is confronted: 
to bring about a rapprochement of Socialists and Communists 
in order to utilize the full potential of the workers move-
ment for the vital interests of the working people, for - 
peace, and for Socialism. The Communist Movement is shedding 
certain rigid forms and formulas, parts of an armor which 
were fashioned in a difficult struggle but which in the 
course of time hampered our own mobility--and hampered not 
only the blow of the enemy but also the touch of a friend. 
Consider for instance the certainly not incorrect for-
mula of the "two camps" which has now become inadequate and 
does not take into consideration the complexity of world 
politics. The alternative of neutrality has offered also 
bourgeois states a chance to draft-away from the American 
grip and to 'expand the "zone of peace." In the theoretical, 
scientific and cultural fields, various views are being 
reassessed and critically considered in an atmosphere of 
discussion. Of course, the discussion is carried out on 
the basis of scientific Socialism, of Marxism-Leninism. The 
Communist Party is a fighting group of people with the same 
ideas, based on a specific ideology. The free discussion 
within the Communist movetent does not mean that one can 
voice views which are contrary tit) this ideology.

The self-criticism of the Communist movement makes 
easier the rapprochement of Socialists and Communists, and 
there is no doubt that this rapprochement would acquire a 
rapid pace if the leaderships of the Socialist Parties 
would show the same self-critical attitude toward their
. 
policy and toward their past. It would be erroneous, 
however, to attribute the increased possibilities of united. 
action of Socialists and Communists only or particularly 
to the self-criticism at. the 20th Party. Congress. As far 
as the Congress is concerned, the decisions made there, 
which were derived from sociological development?that 
war can be avoided, and that the path toward Socialism . 
must not necessarily lead via civil war--have contributed 
to removing anti-Communist prejudices, prejudices such as 
"the Communists are speculating on a war, they are uncon-
ditionally in favor of force," etc., which appeared in the 
course of years of anti-Communist slander and which hampered 
the rapprochement of Socialists and Communists. 
Above all, the entire development of world politics 
has made the rapprochement of Socialists and Communists 
easier. The rigid fronts of the Cold War have begun to 
crumble, and groupings which for years defended the American 
policy have detached themselves from American control. This 
includes bourgeois groups as well as Socialist Party leader-
ships. 
The danger of German rearmament has increased the 
recognition among many Socialist leaders in West European 
countries that It is necessary to come to an understanding 
with the countries of the East, particularly with the Soviet 
Union. The possibility of agreement between the Socialist 
and Communist Parties is within reach in several countries. 
Of course, in order to mr.Jce this a reality much effort 
is still necessary. In the leaderships of the Socialist 
Parties there are still powerful politicians who are opposed 
to any joint action with the Communists and in some cases 
against any detente with the Soviet Union, The Communists 
cannot quit criticizing such Socialist leaders in general, 
they cannot give up the criticism, of views and methods 
which are contrary to the principles of their ideology and . 
the workers' movement. 
Few parties have as much experience in the policy of 
a Popular Front as the Communists of France. However, the

French Communists refused to express confidence in the 
Socialist Government as regards the Algerian problem, 
they could not approve of it without violating the most 
elementary principles of proletarian internationalism. 
The greatest possible flexibility in the efforts to bring 
about action unity of Socialists and Communists can be 
based only on firm adherence to the principles, including 
the conviction that the workers of any country need a 
strong Communist Party as a boosting force in the interest 
of workerslunity. 
What the Communists found out in connection with the 
criticism of the cult of personality at the 20th Party Con-
gress has caused uneasiness and confusion among their 
ranks.. This was due to the nature of the information and 
to the form in which it was revealed. HoWever, the stir-
ring discussions and examinations and the clarifying result 
to which they will lead will initiate a new era in which 
the attraction and popularity of the Communist movement 
among the masses will lead to_new great successes of the 
international working class. 
Volksstimme, 26 June (as broadcast by radio) 
? 
The discuSsions and results of the 20th Congress of 
the Soviet Communist Party have started wide discussions 
In the entire Communist world movement. For Months, the 
Communists have been discussing not only the (startling?) 
facts which the 20th Party Congress revealed about the ef-
fects of the cult of the individual but are also dealing 
with thenew views worked out by the Party Congress regard-
ing the possibility of preventing wars, the possibility of 
new roads to Socialism, workers'unity, and many other 
-principles -of the workers' movement. A wide, useful, and 
creative discussion is being held in the Communist Parties 
of all countries. 
The Austrian Communists also, immediately after the 
20th Party Congress, began discussions on these problems, 
but the intensity of the election campaign led to a neces-
sary interruption of the discussions and to a concentration 
of all the party strength on the election campaign. Only 
a few days after May 13, however, the Central Committee of 
the Austrian. Communist,Party held a meeting which discussed 
the election outcome, reviewed the party's attitude in the

election struggle, and drew conclusions for the continuation 
of the struggle and work of the party. 
It was self-understood. that this discussion, ? introduced. 
by a. report by party chairman Koplenig, became the beginning. 
of a conscientious reviewing of the policy of our party, 
and that the members- of the Central Committee, in discussing 
the new tasks of the party, tried to draw the necessary 
conclusions for the struggle of the Austrian workers from 
the results ofthe 20th CPSU Congress. The Central Committee 
of the KPO decided immediately to continue the discussions 
begun at the meeting in the local party organizations and . 
to. summarize the results of the discussions of party members 
and officials. at a.new meeting of the Central Committee. 
In addition, the Central Committee decided to prepare 
a discussion on the possibility of a peaceful and parlia-
mentary course of Austria on her road to Socialism within 
our party and within the entire working class. For weeks 
now, Communists all over Austria have been discussing all 
problems of their workand policy in meetings of party 
members, officials, or activists. Thousands of Communists 
are voicing their views and. are fervently. discussing the 
entire policy of the party. Many.problems of our policy . 
are being reviewed, weaknesses and mistakes are beingad-
mitted, and many- valuable suggestions for the further strug-
gle of our party are being made. 
The discussions reveal the deep love for the party and 
the efforts made to work out the new policy of our party. . 
Sometimes, also,, harsh language is used, and not everything 
said is quite correct, but this could not be otherwise and 
is not harmful as long as this criticism is guided by the 
will to help the party. It is-the very essence of the dis-
cussions that the positive and correct views will assert 
themselves finally and lead.to an improvement of the work. 
Naturally, the problems of the 20th Party Congress 
play a decisive role in the discussions of the Austrian 
Communists. They discuss with passion and deep sincerity 
the effects and results of the cult of the individual and 
are searching for the cause which led to such serious errors 
in a Socialist country. This problem was not completely 
clarified at the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist Party. 
We Austrian Communists are of the opinion that the measures 
already taken before the 20th Party Congress and decided 
upon at the Party Congress must be continued so that perma-
nent and firm guarantees are established that such develop-
ments alien to the very spirit of Socialism will be prevented 
In the future.

the consequences of the cult of the individual were pub- , 
lished in the press :of our opponentsthe Politburo of the' 
Austrian Communist Party's Central Committee some time ago

Party to place this document at the disposal of our party., 
We Austrian Communists voice the belief that questions of 
such big international importance must be treated in a 
manner which takes into account the conditions under which 
the Communist Parties in the capitalist countries are waging 
their struggle. 
The enemies of the workers' movement are hoping to capi-
talize on the serious discussions conducted by Communists 
all over the world.. These are empty hopes. By means of 
discussions, we Communists are overcoming mistakes and 
shortcomings in our work. With newmethods, we will estab-
lish better relations with the Socialists and fight .more 
successfully for the establishment of workers' unity, and 
thus for the cause of the workers' movement and the victory 
of Socialism.

As the last party still clinging to Moscow's apron 
strings, the Austrian. Communist Party has now finally "taken 
a stand" on the results of the 20th Congress of the .CPS1J, 
though in a somewhat weary and vexed way. The Oesterreichische 
Volksstimme yesterday reported on the "course .L5T-171-76?dts-17--
sions"" which allegedly 'took place at party?meetings.and con-
ferences. What was discussed and what the result was, can 
however not be found in the report. 
? It is very clear, however, that Moscow deemed. It super-
fluous to even send their insignificant Austrian comrades 
the text of Khrushchev's speech which is already- known to 
the whole world. But even had they. received ?a copy,- they 
would not have dared offer an opinion with out special orders. 
At the most, they would venture to -quote Togliatti once more. 
There they stand with their huge new printing plant, which. 
publishes nothing but the diminutive issues of their press, 
and fear bankruptcy. ? Can they say anthing? ? How can they knew .. 
whether the masters of today will .not be relieved by others 
already tomorrow? Whether or not a new change of course will 
come about which will force the Communists to swallow the. Lies 
of today just as they must now choke dowh the lies of yester-
day? 
That is why they are just stammering a few words agalrist 
the "cult of personality" and have thred only once to speak 
about the "grave mistakes" in Russia. But -- in the whole 
Volksstimme article, Stalin's name does not appear once! One 
can never know... 
But they cannot get- away with it that easily! Dld not 
the Austrian Communists again and again sPread. Stalin's name 
over all their press as the "greatest person of our epoch" ---
yes or no? . 
It is ture or not that on the day after Stalin's death, 
when Abeiter-Zeitung? in the first paragraph of its editorial, 
stated that he was not a great man, they assailed us with. a ? 
tremendous cry of rage? Is it true or not that they not only 
accepted all Stalin's infamous acts but praised them as the 
brilliant accomplishments of the Great Brother and even also 
of Socialism, whether they were the blood orgies of the. groat ? 
"ChiStka" or the gagging of art and science, whether the in-
suiting tirades against Tito or the arrest of the Jewish 
doctors? And is it true or not that 25 years ago the same

Koplenig headed the Communist Party of Austria as he does - 
today? Is it true or not that the same little bureaucrats, 
who reveled in the "cult of personality" for their whole 
lives, are now acting as though this had all never existed? 
They did' not know anything? They have just now been informed 
of the true nature of Stalinism? We do not believe that

FRAM DECLARES 
SOVIET PERIL RISES 
Anti-Stalin Drive Is Shift in 
Tactics, Not Aim, Latter 
to Virginia gditor Says 
WINCHESTER, Va., July 9 
- - - Generalissimo Francisco 
Franco, Spanish Chief of State, 
warned today that the new, So-
viet policy constituted A "great-
br danger over a long period of 
Lime." 
The downgrading of Stalin 
"does ,not represent any change 
in objectives,' he said in a letter 
to Harry F'. Byrd Jr., editor 
and publisher of The Winchester 
Star and The Harrisonburg 
Daily News-Record. 
The anti-Stalin campaign, Gen-
eral Franco added, is just 'a 
variation in tactical strategy to 
better attain these objectives.'" 
Mr. Byrd, who two years ago 
had had a lengthy interview with 
.the Spanish leader in Madrid, 
had recently sought his ap-
praisal of the Soviet Union's 
"new look." The Franco letter 
appeared with a copyright ar-
ticle in today's issues of the two 
Virginia newspapers. 
Text of the Letter 
The text of the letter follows: 
man/dation iersm the SpatikshA 
El Pardo.Palace, 
June 2,_ 1958. 
The Hon, Harty F. Byrd Jr. 
Dear Friend: 
I received your kind letter of 
April 30, in which you asked 
me for my opinion on the new 
anti-Stalin attitude which has 
been proclaimed by the leaders 
of the Kremlin. It is not diffi-
cult to see through their tactic: 
I believe, like yourself, that the 
present expression of Soviet 
policy does not represent any 
change in the objectives pur-
sued, but rather a variation In 
tactical strategy to better at-
tain these objectives; having 
SPAIN 
tried some procedures, they put-
others into action which they 
judge more appropriate. The 
near future will confirm this. 
In any form, it constitutes a 
clear expression of the dyna-
mism and agility of their pol-
icy. 
The very grave accusations of 
Khrushchey I:Nikita S. Khru-
shchev, Soviet Communist par-
ty chief] and the attendant 
publicity results from a compli-
cated and difficult crisis in the 
Soviet policy. What else could 
justify permitting this very 
grave impact, which adversely 
affects the internal and exter-
nal prestige of communism? 
They could have effected the 
change and justified what they 
call a new collective course as 
the crowning of some labor, as 
the end of one period and the 
beginning of another, without 
having to resort to making 
these extremely grave ACCUSR, 
flans public, and creating a 
havoc which adversely affetts 
communism in general and 
which has been turned against 
them as accomplices and col-
laborators. When they must de-
fend themselves in this fashion, 
It is because somebody is at-
tacking and attacking strongly. 
Army's Bole Discussed 
It has been known for some 
time that the Communist lead-
ers and the principal figures 
of the Communist party, like 
the generals and military lead-
ers, felt themselves under the 
constant menace of Staliniat 
terrorism, with its periodic 
purges and shots in the back 
without any possible defense 
against them. Stalin's death 
brought them together with the 
aim of freeing themselves from 
this terror. In the process, the 
Army had to play a principal 
role, This explains its part in 
the new situation, 
From the point of view of 
Communist foreign policy, the 
growing repudiation of sub-
servience by the Communist 
parties of other nations to 
Moscow and Soviet imperialism 
made advisable rectification 
of a strategy which jeopard-
ized the attainment of Com-
munist expansion abroad. It 
became necessary to place the 
blame on someone, to give a 
semblance of sincerity to the 
rectification, The immediate 
reconciliation With Tito I Presi-
dent. Tito of Yugoslavia] dem-
onstrates this. _ 
Polley 'Bad for West' 
To the light of the foregoing, 
we must. conclude that the 
change in tactics obeys internal 
needs of cOmmunism, and we 
must deduce, as a result, that 
what they consider good must 
necessarily be bad for the 
West. There are no other rea-
sons which could justify (such] 
fundamental changes in a poli-
cy which has expanded their 
frontiers to unprecedented lim-
its and which has permitted 
them to occupy one of the 
fore,piost places in the com-
munity of nations, 
What is evident is that Rus-
sia today needs time and space 
to consolidate its conquests and 
It s new internal situations, and 
It. is to this that the new policy 
responds: to show themselves 
in sheep's clothing, attract at-
tention and create problems in 
other areas, which, by permit-
ting them to consolidate their 
situation, also permits them to 
assimilate what they have at-
tained so far, Time is a power-
ful ally for them. 
In brief: The letting up of the 
moment constitutes a. greater 
danger over a long period of 
time. I ani sure that you, who 
know Russia and the unchang-
ing aims of Communist. policy, ' 
will not be far from this point 
of view. 
Very cordially yours, 
F. Fmksico.

BELGIUM 
Le Drapeau Rouge, Resolution of the Central Committee of the Com-
munist Party of Belgium, 26 June ' 
Though not in possession of the official version of the speech. 
by Comrade Khrushchev criticizing Stalin, the Central Committee of 
the Belgian Communist Party, at a meeting in Brussels on 23-24 June, 
is of the opinion that several points in it call for the following 
statements: 
1. The Central Committee believes that, despite its painful 
aspects, the discussion opened by the 20th Congress of the CF-SU in 
socialist countries and in communist and progressive circles all 
over the world contains elements of great interest to all those who 
fight for the triumph of peace and of socialism. 
Under these circumstances, the Central Committee is aware 
of the important contribution to the .debate in progress made by 
the recent statements of a number of party brothers and, in partic-
ular, by Comrade Togliatti: secretary general of the Italian Com-
munist Party. 
He expresses the hope that the labor and the democractic 
press, which published the complete text of the documents emanating 
from the US Department of State, will demonstrate their objectivity 
by publishing likewise all other documents on the disputed subject. 
2. The Central Committee considers intolerable the violations 
of revolutionary legality and of the rules of socialist democracy 
committed in the USSR. 
The implacable hatred of the capitalist world for the Com-. 
munist Party of the USSR: which was first to lead its people to a 
definite victory over capitalism, explains, though it does not con-
done, the atmosphere of exaggerated distrust in which the grave 
offenses were made possible. 
3. The Central Committee admits that the Belgian Communist 
Party erred when, in the ardor of its fight in defense of the coun-
try of socialism: it did not pay enough attention to the possibility 
of avoidable excesses which have now been denounced. 
It is happy to see the Communists of the USSR and of the 
people's democracies frankly admit their errors.

It is convinced that a serious search for the origin of 
these errors will strengthen the measures already taken to prevent 
a repetition. 
The Central Committee believes that the courageous denuncia-
tion of these errors enhances the prestige of the socialist countries 
among the Belgian workers and militant socialists who today in over 
growing numbers acknowledge the triumph and the superiority of the 
socialist system of production and its groat contribution to the good 
fortune of mankind. 
In the course of events in the socialist world the Central 
committee recognizes important elements of a nature to promote the 
unity of action which is indispensable to Belgian workers in the 
struggle against capitalism and for the maintenance of peace and the 
development of social progress. 
4. The Central Committee sees in the brilliant victories won 
in the socialist countries in the economic, social and political 
fields, and particularly in the triumph of the belief in peaceful 
coexistance over the machinations against peace,--exalting stepping 
stones on the victorious road of mankind towards socialism.

SWEDEN 
Daa:ens Nyheter, 19 June 
Everything indicates that when Togliatti behaves as he 
now does, it is primarily in order to prevent a crisis in 
his own party, and to prevent, as far as possible, the infor-
mation on Stalin now being published, not in the interests of 
truth but in Khrushchev and Company's interests, from becom-
ing a weapon directed against the Western European Communist 
Parties that wallowed in the mud before the despot. East of 
the Iron Curtain there is no one to remind the present rulers 
of their revolting paeans of praise to Stalin, or of their 
equally revolting rage against Tito--and he who is nauseated 
has nowhere else to go. ,But in countries where a free opinion 
exists, the Communists are daily forced to eat their own words, 
and it is plain to see that the turnabout as concerns Stalin 
has caused confusion in the Communist ranks, and defection in 
various quarters. But on the .other hand it is hardly neces-
sary to point out that a Communist Party critical of Moscow 
.is a self-contradiction--such parties have neverlived long 
(Yugoslavian Communism-expected). Unconditional acceptance 
of Soviet policies--the day-to-day Soviet policy--has ever 
since the acceptance by the Third Internationale in of 
the infamous "21 Theses" been the first Commandment of the 
Communist catechism. 
The destruction of the Stalin myth, however, has placed 
the Communist parties of Western Europe in a great dilemma, 
further aggravated by the honors showered upon the former 
"Fascist," "murderer of workers," and "Warmonger," Tito in 
Moscow..t. 
It is, of course, impossible to determine what the con-
sequences will be in the long run of Togliatti's maneuver and 
how other Western European Communist Parties will react. 
According to London telegrams, speculation is rife there con-
cerning a more extensive "revolt against Moscow"--which 
seems a little fantastic. On the other hand, a sensation is 
constituted by the declaration of the British Communist organ 
the Daily Worker to the effect that "the Soviet leaders have 
lost a certain amount of prestige," that the violation of 
"Communist democracy" in-the Soviet Union must be explained 
better than Khrushchev .has done thus far, and that the result 
of Togliatti's declaration will be that Apeople will begin 
to think for themselves"--a point of view which would mean

speech condemning Stalin, has evidently set a stone rolling 
which will be hard to stop. 
Ny_Dag, (Communist) 20 'June 
The chairman of our Italian brother party, Palmiro 
Togliatti, with his interview statement on Khrushchev's 
Stalin speech has caused tremendous perplexity and speculation 
in the capitalist world. Since we have not yet obtained a 
copy of the interview in. Unita and only have come by mis-
cellaneous rumors concerning its ?contents through the instru-
mentality of the clever reporting art of bourgeoise news agen-
cies and correspondents, it is premature to make an. accurate 
?evaluation of the contents. On the other hand, some evaluation 
of the statements of our opponents, which, have no more basis 
than the reports mentioned above, can be made. 
According to these statements, not until now when he has 
been pressed by the Socialist leader, Nenni, and because of 
the supposed election defeat, has Togliatti taken a. stand in. 
the matter. To this it can be said that as early. as. March, 
Togliatti published a long article, which was. reprinted In the 
entire Swedish Communist press, in which he analyzed_Stalin'S 
errors and tyranny and .the reasons therefor. The curious 
thing at. that time was that Nenni polemiclzed against Togliatti 
and was hostile toward the .expcsition of Stalin's errors. And 
then let us add that the figures from the zTtallaq Interior 
Ministry- published last week showed that the Italian Communist 
Party did not suffer defeat at all, but on the contrary, success-
fully defended its strong positions and continues to have twice 
as many adherents as the Socialist Party with whom the Comm-
unists are carrying on friendly and successful. cooperation. 
Anotherconclusion which the commentators have drawn 
from the Tbgliatti interview, is that he states that a way to 
socialism different from the Soviet way should be followed In 
Italyand that the special conditions in that country should - 
be taken Into consideration in this connection. Naturally. 
Togliatti did not suggest this as something novel inasmuch as 
he had said the same thing a long time Our Swedish 
party had adopted this point of view as early as the Congress 
of 1944; it was expressed even more clearly at the 1946 Con-
gress; and it was confirmed in the party program in .1953. ? 
The concept was interpreted by. the 20th Congress of our Soviet 
brother party in February of this year, at which timeTogliatti 
also commented on it. Permit us also to add that all the 
countries which have entered into the Way. of Socialism since 
the Second World War have pursued their own ways, which have

taken into consideration the special c.,ircumetances which 
existed in these countries. This would have been impossible, 
however, if the Soviet people had not built up their social-
istic order in the way of the Soviet'. 
But the ,most malevolent of all is the attempt to portray 
Togliatti 's interview as an admission that our Italian brother 
party had carried out its policies on "orders from Moscow" --
which Moron-Tidningen, among others, pretends to believe. 
In line wiffiThis base portrayal, Togliatti thus has now 
chosen Tito's way and so refuses to "take orders from the 
Kremlin" any longer. This is a pgrtrayal which befits reac-
tionaries and war provocateurs, bUt has ,nothing to do with 
reality. The Italian Communist Party and all other Communist 
parties- determine their. policies themselves with reference to 
the circumstances in their countries, and allow themselves to 
be guided by the current interests of their own working people 
and the historical goals of the working class. There are no 
international organizations which coordinate the policies of 
their respective parties with'the,policies of their brother . 
parties in other countries. 
In our opinion it would have been beneficial if Khrush-
chev's speech had been made public, since this would have 
forestalled all the versions which, have appeared in various 
capitals this spring and which have been trumpeted forth as 
the original. Even if this speech may give aesomewhat one-
sided picture of Stalin's work, since it dwelt mainly on Stalin's 
weaknesses and the mistakes he committed and does not illumin-
ate the entire situation in which these weaknesses could have 
their play, either, still the truth, even though it is painful, 
is better than a silence which leaves room for all kinds of 
interpretations, caricature, and calumny. We cannot, however, 
judge what reasons determined that, the world still has not 
received an authorized version of Khrushchev's speech. 
On the other hand, the leaders of the Soviet Union have 
shown the whole world that they have settled accounts with 
past oppression and errors and in all areas are further deve-
loping and deepening the socialist democracy.- The internal 
reorganizing and the external offensive for peaceful coex-
istence and relaxationHof tensions give new fruitful impulses 
to the international labor movement and clears the way for 
coodination of the efforts of all progressive forces. Svenska 
Dagbiadet fears that this, as well as the continuing debate 
on the principles of the collective leadership, will strengthen 
the Communist movement still more. We are convinced that this ? 
will happen.

Even though the LTommunisI7 leaders may .be able still to 
deal with the membership as robots, this will be of little use. 
For, which way are the robots to be turned? Should the lie 
be stuck to that the leaders did not know what the whole world. 
knew, of the horrors of the Stalin period? Or should it be 
maintained that everything that happened in the Soviet. Union 
during a 25-year period-mass murder, terror, torture?was-
acceptable and only to he regarded as expedient methods on 
the road to paradise? Should the arch enemy, the Social 
Democrats, be. approached with offers of a.popular front, or 
should an attempt be made to return to pure revolutionary 
Leninism? - None of these problems have been solved,- and the 
confusion continues under cover of a pained silence...'. For 
a time, the leaders may save themselves by continued .silence. 
But they are unable to stop the process of dissolution which 
has set in. . 
25 June  
A close analysis of Khrushchev's speech failed to disclose 
a single word of criticism of the Soviet system of dictator-
ship, and that Khrushchev's condemnation applied to Stalin's 
despotism over the party) not over the people. 
It is wishful thinking, according to the editorial, to 
expect a fundamental change in the system of dictatorship, but 
the severe shock to the faith in dictatorship will in the long 
run carry with it consequences, and it is here that the break. 
with Stalinism opens a perspective which the present Soviet 
leaders had not foreseen.

NORWAY 
Arbeiderbiadet; 25 June, excerpt 
Reidar Larsen has been selected to speak for the'Nor-
weglan Communists in the matter of the Stalin. down2;radingi 
This looks simply heroic: A young, unknown man stands 
forth alone and "bawls out" the mighty leaders, both dead 
and living, of the Soviet Union. But in reality there is 
no heroism. Note what has happened. The Italian Communist 
leader Togliatti spoke first'. He said that "the Communist 
movement needs and desires greater freedom for its own judg-
ment" and that conditions in the Soviet Union "no longer can 
be an obligatory pattern for other Communist states". The 
Frendh Communists followed up this criticism. A resolution 
by the British Communist Party had the same content -- and, 
what is most important, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia,. 
behind the Iron Curtain, folloWs in Togliatti's footsteps. 
The new Communist line may be found in these and other . 
statements. They follow each other in well ordered sequence. 
First the large ones, then those not so large, then the small 
ones, and the Norwegian Communist Party brings up the rear. 
We may be rather sure that the Kremlin spoke first. No 
rebellion is involved. The Kremlin has only given new signals, 
.which are evidently being followed, not however, without inner 
turmoil. 
Nevertheless the most important thing now is how the 
Communists intend to prevent the same horrors being repeated. 
At present, they have gotten no further than to wonder what 
the causes of the horrors could have been. The fateful errors 
must have begun some place, they say, and they urge the Soviet. 
Communists to explain. They are just as confused as people 
looking for a needle in a haystack. 
There is no reason to make the problem so complicated. 
The explanation is simple. We ask the Communists whether the 
world has ever seen a dictatorship not guilty of suppression, 
cruelties, and miscarriages of -justice. The tragic part of 
the new situation is that the Communists condemn the dictator, 
but not dictatorship. We believe that many Communists under-
stand that dictatorsbtp must lead to suppression. But they 
are not allowed to state their views.

A very- important debate has begun in the -international 
labor movement. Experiences -- positive and negative -- are 
being evaluated. Settlement is being made With occurrences 
contrary to basic principles, in order to prevent their re- ? 
ourrence. Present day perspectives for new victories in the 
struggle for socialism are being analyzed, and the line for 
the new forward march being drawn. 
The immediate occasion for the debate is what took: 
place at the 20th Congress, CPSU, but it is of greater ex-
tent. 
Naturally and necessarily, the Communist Party of Nor-
way must take part in the debate -- with a special viewto 
our conditions and problems We urge the readers of Frihoten 
and Party members to take part in the discussion.. 
Some people ask what the opinion of the Party is. But 
in this discussion there is no question of "ready-made stand-
points." The bourgeois press, ? the enemy of socialism, will, 
now as before, make sensations, and seek to spread-their own 
confusion to others. Our most effective reply will be an open 
and honest discussion, by means of which we may learn from 
past experience and from the present situation.

FINLAND 
Suomen.Sosialidemokraatti, 19 June . 
When for decades we have become accustomed to the 
religious echo by the Communist Parties of the entire 
world of the statements of the Soviet Communist Party 
headquarters, it is not without reason that the surprising, 
independent stand of the Italian Communist leader, Palmiro 
Togliatti, is described as sensational. The leader of 
the West's largest Communist Party has pointed his criti-
cism at the Soviet leaders outright,--and directed the 
discussion regarding Communist mistakes along new channels 
even in his own party. Why were all those evil deeds per-
mitted,.and afterwards the blame loaded onto the back of 
the leader who during his time was treated as a god? 
What is important is not necessarily that this is the 
first time that the expose of the Stalin cult has created 
discussion but that this is the first time that the dis-
cussion comes from the mouth of a well-known Communist 
leader. It seems that the conferences of Marshal Tito--
the rebel who has risen to a position of respect in the 
Communist camp--and Togliatti, prior to Marshal Titos 
ceremonious Moscow trip, have truly directed policies to-
ward change. The strong criticism from the leader of the 
West's largest Communist Party cannot help but influence 
the West's smaller Communist Parties into taking a stand 
even though it doubtless will result in headaches for some 
of them. 
Togliatti's stand was in large part also affected by 
internal political matters. The Italian Communist Party 
suffered defeat in the communal elettions and it now appears 
in danger of losing its earlier ally, the Nenni Leftist 
Socialists. Togliatti has made his decision, and from all 
appearances, Marshal Tito's counsel has greatly influenced 
him. As we remember, the Communists have suffered reversals 
in all elections following the anti-Stalin campaign--this 
has occurred in Austria as well as the Netherlands. Togliatti's 
example cannot but be influential. But too much must not 
be expected from the change. Even during the era of the 
smile there is reason to reCall the story of the Trojan 
horse. That he who was previously infallible is later under 
criticism is a cheering *sign for the democracies. But it must 
always be remembered that new words do not change old objectives.

It appears obvious that the present day workers movement, 
which promotes the highest ideals of every nation and all man-
kind, is facing a new great progressive era. This has partly 
resulted from the recent, and still continuing, Soviet expose. 
and criticism of mistakes which at first aeemed very painful, 
but later has been felt as a more liberating, daring and stimu-
lating breath of air throughout the world. 
Thus, it is natural that the conclusions; of various 
bourgeoise papers (as Helsinzin Sanomat and Ilta Sanomat), 
whose strongest characteristic is that of not taking an inde-
pendent stand, concerning the Communist "ripping of seams" and 
crises" do not reach the heart of the matter. On the other 
hand, we can be encouraged in that currently the previously 
mentioned types of papers have seldom been liberal In publi-
cizing and discussing those matters which Create healthy 
broad scope discussions of problems in the present worker's 
movement. 
A result of this type of broad scope deliberation and 
discussion is the decrease of the suspicion and fear of many 
honest persons of Socialists and Communists, and toward . 
Socialism and Communism. The impression that Communists are 
the instigators of some underhanded orders is eliminated and 
the belief that the present day workers movement promotes the 
freedom of all working people is strengthened. This type of 
development creates an even firmer foundation among all nations 
for a feeling of friendship for the USSR and other Socialist 
countries and strengthens peace and security between nations. 
We have every reason to be thankful for. the fact that the 
Italian Communist Party's well known leader, Paimiro Togliatti, 
has given a broad scope statement on those matters which we . 
have mentioned in the preceding paragraphs. The Finnish press 
has had only relatively few small, inaccurate and even erroneous 
translated and interpreted fragments of Togliatti's statement 
But even at that it appears that it arouses significant 
ideological discussions of those general mistakes which. might . 
have affected the progress of the entire international workers 
movement up to the present time. The initiation of this type 
of discussion on the international scale will undoubtedly hasten 
the ideological growth and unity ofthe workers' movement and 
will deepen the Consciousness that not only is this ideological 
growth and unity necessary and advantageous to all countries, 
but also that itawakens the so-called rank-and-file of a broader 
workers movement to their clear and definite rights and freedoms, 
which includes the freedom to criticize. This signifies that 
an organized democracy is developing into that which it should - 
be. 
In complete contradiction to the conclusions of the 
bourgeoise press, there is no doubt that Togliatti's statement 
might be an indication of the beginning of a new and rich 
progressive era in the present day workers' movement.

INDIA 
Indian Communist Party Reaction, 13 July,. excerpt,-(as'broadcast 
by radio) 
The facts mentioned in Khrushchev's report reveal that 
together with great successes in building socialism in the 
Soviet Union, there also occurred during the latter part of 
the life of Stalin instances of distortion of Soviet democracy, 
infringement of Socialist legality by excesses and arbitrary 
acts and violation of norms of inneT Party life. 
In view of the seriousness of the mistakes committed 
and in view of damage caused by them, it was necessary to take 
resolute measures to rectify the mistakes and undo the damage 
done. 
It was necessary to wage a. determined struggle against 
the cult of personality, a cult alien to the spirit of Marxism-
Leninism. By undertaking these tasks, the Soviet Communist 
Party leadership has rendered great service to the cause of 
Socialism. 
While fully recognizing the negative features and grave 
defects that developed in Stalin's methods of leadership, the 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of India considers 
that a one-sided appraisal of his role during the last 20 
years of his life, years of mighty development in the Soviet 
Union and the world Communist movement, caused bewilderment 
among the masses and can be utilized by enemies of Communism 
to confuse them. 
The Committee, therefore, is 'of the opinion that are 
objective assessment of Stalin's life and work in their entirety, 
Stalin's great achievement and serious shortcomings, is essential 
for successfully fighting the cult of the individual and for 
effectively combating the prevailing confusion. 
The Central Committee declared it was necessary to under-
take a fuller analysis of the causes which led to the arbitrary 
acts and excesses. It added, "To ascribe all shortcomings and

and arbitrariness to defects of an individual falls short Of 
Marxist-Leninist standards of historical objectivity. 
Khrushchevis revelations have been seized upon by 
imperialists and other enemies of the working people to denounce 
the Soviet Union and undermine the confidence of the people in 
the Socialist system. 
Enemies of the workers are at pains to make out that the 
violations of Soviet democracy and excesses committed are 
inherent in the Soviet. system. 
There is a serious danger of many honest and progressive 
elements being influenced by this propaanda, which the Com-
munist Party of India considers it imperative to expose and 
combat. 
It is evident that a system in which such violations and 
distortions. were inherent could not have unleashed the creative 
energies of hundreds of millions of people on a scale never 
known before,- and have brought about such unprecedented social 
transformations. 
The mistakes and excesses that occurred in the Soviet 
Union were not due to the principles of Marxism-Leninism or 
the Soviet system, but to deviations from them in practice. 
These deviations occurred against a background of great - 
victories of socialist reconstruction., carried out in an extremely 
difficult period. 
The Committee is confident that the world Communist movement 
will profit by the experience of the Soviet Union and take ef-
fective measures for the defense and extension of democracy in 
every sphere. 
While Socialism has become the common 'goal of all progres-
sive Mankind in OUT present epoch, each country will however 
proceed to this goal in its own way.

Free Press Journal, 30 June, excerpts 
The Poznan revolt is only the beginning of a revolutionary 
fight for liberation in Soviet Satellite Countries. 
The trouble in Poland is almost. according to schedule. 
If "polycentrise? the word alleged to have been coined by 
Tito to describe the new international Communist relationship, 
can permit a hitherto subdued Togliatti and a habitually' 
yessing Thorez to assert the right of criticism, it is no 
wonder that in Poland ideological autonomy has been expressed 
in much more aggressive terms. The Polish Communist Party has 
the largest mass of nationalism in its mental make-up of any 
East European Communist Party. 
Since the post mortem struggle against Stalin began, 
foreign correspondents in Warsaw had often reported Pales 
talking of a "second revolution." They sense that international 
and national Communist leadership has been growing at a greater 
pace in Poland. than elsewhere, and the authorities conscious 
of it have been trying to respond to it. 
The Poznan trouble indicates that the rate of liberalization, 
now that the weight of international compulsion has been re-
moved, is not considered fast enough. It is also significant 
that the demand for release from party bureaucratic compulsions 
-should start at Poznan, which has the highest proportion of 
industrial workers in its population. As polycentrism becomes 
the international pattern of Communism, internally different . 
groups and parties will have to be tolerated, and the industrial 
workers, who are ideologically Given a. very high status in 
society, will claim their right to organize and express their 
opinion earlier than other groups. .The Polish trouble is only. 
the beginning of a vast movement.

AFRICA 
Dakar, Afrive Nouvelle, 26 June 
The End of a Myth 
On 25 February during a secret session of the 20th 
Congress of the Communist Party of the USSR, Nikita Khrush-
chev presented a report on the cult of personality. This 
report, which has Oust been published by the entire world 
press, is without doubt the most violent condemnation 
known of Stalinis conduct as head of the Soviet state. The 
successor of the Russian generalissimo acknowledged par-
ticularly that the late little father of the Russian people 
had eliminated during his lifetime hundreds of early Com-
munists, after having extorted by force from them confessions 
of imaginary crimes, and that he had massacred tens of thous-
ands of opponents of the Russian Revolution. 
Such facts cannot surprise us. We have known them 
for a long time. One can, however, ask what effect they 
have on all those who have believed in Marxism. Thus, this 
regime which was to free man from all alienations has been 
able to breed the most terrible dictator of all times. And 
this doctrine, which has always proclaimed the impossibility 
of a person influencing history, has been able to produce 
a personality strong enough to impose himself for 30 years 
on the fatherland of Communism, influencing, said Khrushchev 
himself, "in a bad way the international labor Movement" 
because he was more concerned with the power of his state 
than with the happiness of his people. 
One understands that the Western Communist parties may 
have difficulty in admitting such revelations. Would not 
the acceptance of these revelations as true at the same time 
strike a terrible blow at so-called scientific socialism 
and historical mateilialism? 
Must one conclude that Thorez and Togliatti are going 
to choose the path of a new Titoism? It is not very probable. 
But they will enjoy henceforth a greater freedom of action. 
However, we do not delude ourselves: this evolution 
corresponds to the present interest of the Soviet Union. 
As Pineau stated at Washington, the USSR Is obliged today

to face duties which exceed its means in Europe as well as 
Asia, and the USSR begins to understand that it will need 
time to meet its obligations in China, India and the Near 
East. As war is no longer imminent, the USSR no longer 
has the same need to maintain a fifth column in every 
foreign country. 
All the same, nothing has changed in the Soviet con-
ception. At no time did the Khrushchev report have a word 
of pity for the millions of victims of the dead tyrant. 
And if the abuse of viblence is condemned In it, the prin-
ciple of its use is not. 
One chance remains for the West, however. Time can 
work for the West if it knows how to utilize the future to 
promote a policy of aid to underdeveloped countries and of 
cooperation between peoples. Those who believe in God 
must in any case employ it: such a policy demands a great 
love of people and an unconditional respect for the rights 
of the human being, which it is. difficult to exhibit if 
one cannot see in each being the image of a divine creator.

MOROCCO 
Le Courrier du Maroc by Christian Houillion, 19 June 
Francois Mauriac has a new hobby. He aspires to become 
the Egeria of the Communist Party. It is certainly never too 
late to do good, and the Christian, bourgeois, and masochistic 
member of the Academy is opportunely embarking on a quest for 
new sources of enthusiasm. 
Thus, while recalling problems raised by Stalin's con-
demnation and complaining about the Communists' silence and 
-their attachment to the former dictator of all the Russias, 
the defects of whom he calls to mind, Mauriac explains to tne 
"young French Communists" why he has adopted their worries: 
"Don't tell us we are getting involved in what should not 
concern us. To the contrary, At is of utmost concern to us, 
because History's conjunctures may perhaps force us once aain 
to take the same road as you do, as in the days of the Spanish 
War and the Resistance." And, lavish with his advice, Mauriac 
proclaims, using Tito as an example: "Young French Communists, 
this is the example which I hold up to you, the man by whom I 
wish you would be inspired." So, now the young French.Com-
munists are provided with a new mentor, an eminent adviser. 
Thorez and Jacques Duclos no longer have anything to teach 
their legions; a bourgeois has taken it upon himself to out-
line Party line! 
Now, Mauriac's anti-Stalinism breaks out at the very 
? 
moment when the French, Italian, and British Communist Parties 
are in disagreement with Moscow. The language of the Khrushchev 
report has convinced neither Thorez, Togliatti, nor Harry Pollitt 
of the dictator's evilmindedness. 
In fact, people from both sides of the fence cannot. forget 
that, under Stalin, Russia made considerable progress since the 
last Czar; Togliatti has just argued that case in an article 
which caused a certain amount of comment. And the Westerners 
know something about Russia's progress: Khrushchev and Bulganin

have received quite a brilliant heritage, and it does not, 
seem honorable for them to insult thememory of a'dead man for 
whom they, however, were once the willing accomplices, 
Although recognizing Stalin's errors (what statesmati. 
doesn't commit errors), certain Communists refuse to believe 
that he is the sinister person described by Khrushchev and 
Mauriac. Furthermore, Togliatti specifies: "It seems more 
just, in my opinion, to recognize that despite his mistakes, 
Stalin had the approval of a large part of the nation, and, 
first of all, that of the leading-group in the government. 
The error of Stalin's collaborators was in not realizing soon 
enough that they had let him do everything he pleased, until 
the day when it was too late to prevent him from doing so 
without a total upset." 
The attack launched by Mauriac Is justified even less 
because he sets himself up as an enemy of the cult of personality, 
when he himself has kept up a similar cult for many months, 
having as an idol a political man for whom"he IS very indulgent. 
And, finally, it is unwise to deduce from the Khrushchev 
report that there will be an extensive upheaval in international 
Communist strategy, The Communist 'Parties which are silentwill 
perhaps be brought into line by Khrushchev, until the time when, 
in a few years, a collaborator of Russia's new Master comes 
forward and pronounces the 'anti-Khrushchev indictment. .Atrresent, 
the Russians have kept the same objective in the world as Stalin, 
and Moscow's recent diplomatic actions are proof of this. Tactics 
have changed and smiles have been substituted for Molotov's 
"Nyet," but the outcome leaves no room for doubt; young French 
Communists probably do not need Mauriac to convince them of the 
chance for success of the plan perfected a-long time ago by 
Lenin and Stalin. Many "traitors" in Russia have recently been 
rehabilitated. It is not by attacking Stalin's memory that the 
Proteus-like member of the Academy will be most likely to "take 
the road" with his young Communist friends! '

Le Courier du Maroc by Jacques Rouvier, 11 June 
The publication of the complete text of the Khrushchev 
report at Moscow is very interesting. We are familiar with 
the essential point, namely the condemnation of Stalin. They 
also tell us that 98 out of 139 members of the Central Committee 
elected in 1934 were arrested and shot. Nevertheless, a series 
of questions would normally be posed for Communist parties: 
first, the acolytes of Stalin who supported him and permitted 
him to pursue his policy are presently in power; there are 
then two possibilities, either they approved this policy and 
profited from it, or they did not approve it and certainly 
lacked the essential element of the character of a leader. 
However. that may be, the masses first were told that the great 
majority of the Central Committee are traitors and everyone 
agreed on this and thanked the brilliant Father of the People. 
Now one announces that the brilliant Father of the People was 
a poor madman and everyone is also in agreement. The fact 
which is certain is that the methods remain but that the men 
change. Before there was one man; now there are several men. 
In the interior of the party rumblings are making them-
selves heard because there are several rival ,2,7tDups. However 
that may be, the goals remain the same, but it is also certain 
that if internal struggles should continue, the external power 
of Russia would decrease as it was diminished at the time when 
Stalin carried out his purges and especially when he suppressed 
his whole general staff.

TUNISIA 
Le Petit Matin, 26 June 
The problems raised in the French Communist Party .by 
the publication of the Khrushchev report and the denuncia-
tion of the crimes of Stalin are becoming 'greater and 
greater in volume. 
It is known that after having maintained a long silence 
on this report, the Communist Party decided to break it 
this week with a declaration of its, political bureau pub-
lished 24 hours after the interview given, by Togliatti to 
a liberal Italian review. 
It appears from this declaration and this interview, 
both of which were approved by the British Communist Party, 
that Western Communists, while approving the spirit which 
dictated the Khrushchev report,_ refuse to subscribe with-
out more analysis to all the accusations made against 
Stalin. In other words, the Western Communist parties de-
sire that henceforth problems posed in the Soviet Union 
are not obligatorily their problems. 
There is no question, say the French Communist leaders, 
that the next Congress of Le Havre will take as the basis 
of its work the conclusions of the 20th Congrees of the 
Communist Party of the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, the 
adaptation to this relative autonomy with respect to the 
USSR presents delicate problems to the French Communist 
leaders. 
The Central Committee discussed this Friday and adopted 
a resolution which will be printed elsewhere. Furthermore, 
we will have occasion to discuss later on the way in which 
the party directorate intenda to approach the Congress of 
Le Havre. 
In the meantime, it is interesting to note two positions 
expressed this week in the weekly press by two intellectuals, 
one of whom was excluded from the party several months ago, 
Pierre Herve, and the other, Claude Roy, who is still a party 
member, but who has often demonstrated a certain independence 
of spirit.

In France Observateur Pierre Herve attacked Maurice 
Thorez very violently. The following are passages from 
his article: "There is no collective direction in the 
French Communist Party: Maurice Thorez rules through his 
creatures and his creatures rule through him. There is 
no democracy in the party: the manner of preparation for 
the Congress of Le Havre would furnish proof if there were 
need for it. In the conferences of federations and sections, 
the representatives of the leadership maneuver in a way to 
prevent criticisms being entered in the voted resolutions. 
The machine is scarcely shaken. The Federal Secretaries 
have their lists of delegates checked by the Central Com-
mittee. These arrangements are made so that the breath 
coming from Moscow does not reach Le Havre. 
One should not draw from this the conclusion that there 
is nothing more to do: it is necessary to fight fascism 
wherever it is, including inside the Communist Party. No 
democrat, no advocate of socialism stands to gain anything 
by the increased nationalist and reactionary tendencies 
which come to light in the Communist Party. It seems to 
me that, on the contrary, a renovation of the methods of 
the French Communist Party can only be obtained in accord 
with the conclusions of the twentieth congress of the Com-
munist Party of the USSR." 
The following passage is from an article by Claude 
Roy in LfExpress: "The Khrushchev report Is only interest-
ing, agonizing, and haunting for those Christians as you 
and Communists as ourselves who 'have in common an inability. 
to be happy in the world as it is.' It is to those alone 
that serious problems are presented today. To those who 
have never forgotten the victories won over misery and 
iniquity from the Oder to the Yellow Sea; to those who have 
perhaps forgotten sometimes that man is never all of one 
piece, that truth is not the property of a single man, that 
trust is not unconditional, and that revolutions are not 
monolithic. It is to those men and primarily to the members 
of the Communist Party that the knowledge of having been 
sometimes mistaken is a silent suffering because it is 
appropriately indescribable. It is those men that are 
aroused, nevertheless, from the silence of chagrin by the 
resolute will never to let such happenings occur again." 
A great debate is henceforth open which is evidently 
one of the most important events of recent years. Is the

new current which is exhibited in the interior of the Com-
munist Party capable of reversing in the near future the 
former methods? There is the question which all men ask 
themselves who think that it is possible to march the 
road of progress only by means of a great rallTof which 
the Communist Party is necessarily one of the essential 
components. 
Tunis-Soir? (quotes from French Non-Communist Press on the 
Reaction of the French. Communist Party to the 
Khrushchev Speech) 19 June 
Le Fi aro Marcel Gabilly commented as follows: "If 
today the French Communist Party criticizes openly the 
Khrushchev report, the same as Togliatti did two days ago 
and the London Daily Worker yesterday, this does not mean 
at all that it raises the flag of independence against 
Moscow. It is entirely because Moscow has, by its own 
chief, modified its instructions. 
"The synchronism with which the Communist parties pro-
test at Rome, at London and at Paris is remarkable. This 
discipline shown by each crying 'Viva la liberte' deceives 
no one. 
L'Aurore commented as follows: "One awaited with 
curiosity the reaction of the French Communist Party. This 
appeared yesterday in a declaration of the political bureau. 
The text is similar to a Spanish inn: one finds there what 
one brings there. Thorez and Dticlos.carry off the clownish 
feat of praising Stalin as the designer of 'Leninism' and 
of crushing him according to the accusations made by - 
Khrushchev. 
Thorez and Duclos execute an about-face, proclaiming 
the virtues of the recent Mosbow congress, asking Khrushchev 
humbly to communicate to them the :text of his indictment 
against Stalin, and reaffirming at the end their 'close 
solidarity' with the Communist Party of the twit." 
Franc-Tireur: Charles Ronsac wrote as follows: "The 
brief statement of the political bureau is a sinister joke."

Whom do the French Communist Party leaders think 
they will convince that they 'have been ignorant' of the 
facts revealed by the report and which they are refrain-
ing from even mentioning again? Thorez, Duclos, Fajon, 
Billoux and Co., not to mention Aragon and Courtade, have, 
on the other hand, the nerve of calling the 'extravagant 
eulogies' addressed to Stalin during his lifetime erroneous, 
whereas their own eulogies would make up a most obsequious 
anthology. 
Finally these leaders reveal themselves as super-
Stalinists in having Stalin play in the October Revolution 
a role which Soviet historians will henceforth challenge 
and, especially, in crediting him with the lion's share 
in 'the formation of all Communist parties.' This last 
avowal is important because it is sincere. It is thanks 
to Stalin and in his name that these men, accomplices of 
an 'arbitrary repression,' have for years deceived and 
fooled a large part of French workers." 
Les Echos commented as follows: "In reality, there is 
generWrcoWsion in the Communist camp. In the peoples' 
democracies the Cominform leaders of yesterday are adapting 
themselves somehow or other .(and mostly poorly1 eapecially 
in attempting to save their personal positions) to the de-
Stalinization. Only Poland,. and more cautiously Rumania 
which awaits Tito's visit, make the reversal resolutely. 
In the USSR there is no visible sign of regret for 
Stalinism among the youth (at least up to the present time) 
or among the directing circles. But this regret is very 
possible in. the Communist International, if it has not 
already begun with the position adopted by Togliatti. There 
is no longer a Communist Mecca nor an unquestioned prophet. 
And that is an event which gives to the 'Khrushchev report' 
an historical importance." 
Tunis-Soir, 21 June 
La Voix du Nord Andre Stibio commented as follows: 
"At 'Ga." present time our impression is that the Western 
Communist parties are passing through a profound crisis, 
which they scarcely attempt to disguise, and that their 
plans do not go as far as certain individuals claim. Their

immediate goal is more prosaic: it is to regain a little 
balance, to rediscover more solid doctrinal foundations, 
and to overcome the type of paralysis with which they have 
begun to be affected since Stalin was,cast down from his ' 
pedestal, denounced with an unusual violence by those who 
were his companions and his accomplices, before becoming 
his posthumous prosecutors." 
Jacques Le Desert stated in Le Midi Libre as follows: 
"How can one imagine that in a paYITY as strongly organized 
as the Communist Party, where nothing is left to chance, 
where everything is so minutely examined and weighed, the 
important officials were ignorant 2f the whole content of 
the Khrushchev report, the conclusions of which the official 
organ of their party, nevertheless, commented favorably 
upon about 20 March? 
How can they admit that they could underestimate the 
importance it had for them, and that they had done nothing 
in this instance to get information? 
And if Thorez and Duclos had the report for a long 
time, which is at least.probable, they could have published 
it themselves in L1Humanite for the edification of their 
political friends.- Te regret which they exhibit today 
of not having been able to do so is.then only hyproorisy."

IRAN 
Etelaat, 6 June 
The exact text of the speech delivered by Khrushchev at 
the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the USSR was 
published by the US Department of State yesterday. This text 
has apparently .reached the Americans through one of the Com-
munist parties of the satellite states. 
While Tito is on a visit to Moscow, let us see what 
could have motivated the US Department of State to publish 
this speech.. 
In the first place, in publishing this speech, the US 
Department of State has scored a major propaganda counter 
attack, using a tactic often employed by Soviet propagandists, 
namely, quoting directly the speech of a Soviet leader. Using 
the very words of a Kremlin leader attacking another Kremlin 
leader is a most effective means of counter propaganda. 
Another aim of the publication of the speech is to erase 
from the minds of people the notion that after the death of 
Stalin, a new era of liberalism descended on the USSR. By 
publishing the speech, the US Department of State wants to 
go on record as having informed the world, the American pub-
lic included, that no basic change has taken place in Soviet 
policy, and that the much publicized Soviet transformation 
is not a reality at all. 
Moreover, to the world at large, the publication of the 
speech will reveal American diplomacy as maintaining an un-
abated fight against international Communism. Also, since 
Washington's attention is constantly focused on the Satellite 
states, the US Department of State wants to make it clear 
that it has not relinquished the idea of securing the freedom 
of these states.

- TT, ? -Ile Red Tsar 
- The publication of the text of Mr. Khrusbchev's "secret" 
speech, made before the Communist Party Cohress in Mos-
cow on February . 25,- shows that the speaker minced no 
.'words in giving the assembled Reds a revelation of Stalin's 
dictatorship at its worst. 
The picture thus drawn of the dead Soviet leader is that ? 
of. one of the cruelest despots who ever disgraced the 
.huMat-trace but how far others shared his crimes, or per-
-haps instigated them, is not so clear. Certainly people who 
'nicknamed. Stalin in his. lifetime "Red Tsar" were justified. 
He seems to have regarded everyone with suspicion and as 
possible object for "liquidation" but his greatest fault in: 
the eyes of his successors, who now sax..they have forsworn 
dictatorship, is that he turned his terror against the Corn-
munist .Party itself. 
While we must hesitate to ? declare that Stalin was a 
-necessary product of the Russian people in a state of revolu-
tionary excitement, it is possible that to some extent he', 
thiaji..:.be regarded as a consequence of Russian history?. 
history marked by so many extremes. 
But many perusing Mr. Khrushchey's speech, and bean 
? ing in mind the events that - have happened and are -still; 
happening in Red satellite countfies, will be inclined to ask 
-"Is a dictatorship the logical outcome' of communism?" and ? 
"'Tan communism exist without a dictatorship?" The an-
swers to these questions may well be "yes" and "no" respec-
tively. But we need not be, like the Reds theniseiveo, too - 
dogmatic. The answers .we seek are likely to be given 
within the next few years through practical developments. 
This much is possible?the coMmunism.that we have 
known in action since the Bolshevik revolution in Russia 
MAY* superseded by what we generally call socialism to-, 
day?a socialism susceptible of being adapted to variouS 
countries according to their special circumstances. 
It may be asked what is the difference between com-
munism and socialism? It is not always, easy to say. But 
perhaps it would not be wrong to pronotince that cotninun-
? ism, although it wears the outward tratipings of socialist 
? ideas, clings to a vicious dogmatism opposed to the spirit - 
. a free inquiry and the judgment of issues on the merits of 
each case. Moverover, it seems certain that it is just this 
_vicious dogmatism that is apt to 'make the crimes of Stalin 
.and other dictators possible. 
In other words, these men, and the supporters who 
make their'existence possible, can only 'see one side of any 
Issue and when 'they are thwarted by opposition, they turn 
instinctively to murder and the prison camp to enforce 
their views. 
Those other questions as to how far socialism itself .is 
a hound proposition, and how far human competitiveness 
and. individualism Might to be discouraged under modern 
conditions of life Mint be judged fairly and calmly as occa-
sion arises in the 'practical affairs of nations. 
. What. is certain is thaf.the' state of things revealed In 
Mr. Khrushehev's speech is totally inconsistent with human 
welfare. And we are reminded :that those who now direct 
the course os the, system rose to eminence under his tute-
-lagre. DO they want us to believe that they were poor 
pupils? '

Yukan Sankei Ji, 19 June 
An unidentified writer states as follows: 
? When I wrote, at the time of Stalin's death, that 
Stalin was a great slaughterer rarely seen in history, I 
received many scathing letters. However, the 10 June is-
sue of the international edition of the New York Times, 
which I received yesterday, carried Khrushchevis detailed 
comments on Stalin's terrorism during the 1930s. 
I got up at 0400 hours this morning and began read-
ing the article, but I am having difficulty because 
Khrushchevis speech Is printed solidly in small type. But 
I did discover that my views and Khrushchevis speech are 
completely in accord on Stalin's large-scale murder in the 
1930s; that is, that Stalin brutally murdered Trotsky, 
Zinoviyev, Bukharin, etc. when they were not revolutionary 
but merely engaged in ideological arguments; that Stalin 
condemned to death many other innocent people; and that 
Lenin would not have committed such cruel acts but, on the 
contrary, he probably would have placed these people in 
important posts and resolved the issue politically. 
Khrushchev confirmed my accusation that Stalin was a 
murderer rarely seen in history. I would like to hear 
from those Communist Party sympathizers who criticized me.

MALAYA 
Singapore, Nan-yang, Shang-pao, 21 April 1956 
Official Soviet propaganda has for sometime been en-
larging its adulation of Lenin, in order to fill the 
blank left by Stalin, a gap which the collective leader-
ship system cannot fill. By restoring the former glory 
of Lenin, the Soviet leaders doubtless hope to destroy 
Stalin's black record, and follow a more glorious path. 
This tendency was already discernible after Stalin's 
death. It was seen not only in the striving anew to 
build up Lenin as all-knowing, but also in the greater 
emphasis on collective leadership. It stressed the rights 
of citizens and condemned the cult of the individual. It 
admitted the mistakes of Stalin, and opposed his methods 
and policies, foreshadowing the eventual casting aside of 
Stalin's image. 
The new rulers had long before made everything ready; 
the praises of Stalin ceased Very quickly after his funeral. 
There was less and less mention of his name on radio and 
in the press, and more and more praise of Lenin's sagacity 
and intelligence. Anniversaries of Lenin's birth and 
death are celebrated with the highest rituals and applause. 
He is pictured as the sole example of Sovietism, and the 
source of inspiration. It is made clear through secret 
hints, that Stalin's many cruelties may be blamed on his 
departing from pure Leninist theory. 
Lenin's writings are being searched for quotations 
justifying every new turn in Soviet policy; articles in the 
papers inform the public about Lenin's collective leader-
ship, and his understanding of peaceful coexistence, social 
laws, religion, and even of art and music. When change in 
policy demands, Lenin become S an elder statesman of heavy 
industry. To emphasize this point, at the Central Committee 
Meeting in January 1955, Mr. Khrushchev said that the great 
Lenin was the sole repositor of the correct line. Stalin's 
name was still mentioned, but the word "great" was omitted. 
In Soviet propaganda, the collective leadership system 
is now continually tied in with Leninist theory. Before the 
20th Congress, it was a.topic for regular discussion in papers

" 
Approved For Release 2003/08/11: CIA-RDP78-02771R000200380003-3 
and on radio. Commentators on party affairs clearly have 
discovered that it is safe to talk about Lenin. Early 
Communist strivings are also mentioned, Lenin's struggles 
with the.Mensheviks, his wisdom in guiding the revolution, 
and so forth. Lenin's small book, published long ago, in 
which he jeers at the Menshevik slogan of "one step for-
ward, two steps backward," has become a teaching history 
topic by A-Ii-K'o-sai Tu-chia-ting over Moscow radio. 
In Mr. Khrushchev's long address to the 20th Congress 
in Moscow in February, the first part was adding to Lenin's 
testamentary instructions. He said correctly that Marx-
Leninism condemned the cult of the individual, and the 
making of an outstanding leader to be the top-ranking hero 
and miracle-worker. Those all became, during secret con-
ferences over several days, forerunner of his amazing 
attack on Stalin. 
Naturally enough, satellite propaganda wanted to be 
on the safe side. They very carefully took over this whole 
topic of collective leadership, at the same time holding 
fast to as much of the Lenin line as was harmless. Most 
recently, the Budapest official daily Szabad Nep reported 
that the Soviet Communist party congress had severely criti-
cized crooked interpretations of harmful Leninist ways of 
administration, and had restored Lenin's collective leader-
ship system, and the party's principle of democracy. 
As to the reports of riots in Tiflis, opposing Khrushchev's 
accusation of Stalin, the most Unusual feature was: the 
Georgia Zarva Vostoka's editorial was to be broadcast on 
16 March, when that paper in carefully measured terms stressed 
Georgia's "ties with our brothers, the great Soviet people." 
However, because it held to Leninism, the paper observed 
that the party congress decisions reiterated Lenin's dictum 
that socialism cannot do away with national differences and 
personality, but in fact assured the growth of the whole 
economy and culture of existing nations. 
Every sentence that Lenin uttered about coexistence with 
capitalist nations, is being used again, and made into script_ 
suitable for newspaper or radio. These sentences, at last 
year's Geneva conference were considered, to contain many 
parts to smile at. A political commentator, Li-hang-tjal-wu, 
may serve as an example. He. said: "Lenin's profound opinion 
was that each?nation should have the right to choose its own. 
form of government and way of life. Lenin was a genuine

hater of interference in other men's affairs. He felt that 
a nation's right of self-determination was sacred and also , 
inviolable. He not only proclaimed that peaceful coexist-
ence with capitalist nations was possible, but also com-
mercial cooperation on a basis of mutmal respect.". 
When at present some rulers have taken away the rights 
of public security and police, and attacked the. individual 
arbitrary methods, Lenin's "Laws of Society" is revered 
as a model. This is the same as when there is a big turn 
in policy, regarding coexistence or heavy industry, in 
principle or in party matters, Lenin's pronouncements have 
become a Bible. 
Stalin never desired to oust Lenin; .he used Lenin, 
and created "Stalinist Leninism." In some essays on 
Stalinism, he again explained things about Lenin. Khrush-
chev in his big speech, shows a tendency to do the same 
thing. We recall that this was Stalin's way of getting 
into the Central Committee. In a dignified way he played 
the role of representing Lenin,. stirring up trouble for 
Trotsky, and finally destroyed Trotsky's faction. And 
Trotsky himself was also like Stalin; he began his work 
in the role of an expounder of Lenin. 
The present Soviet rulers have brought out Lenin's name 
and destroyed the name of a leader who has already left 
this world; and have revived Lenin's teachings in order to 
discredit old policies which have failed. Als6 they have 
explained the new policies as proper. This method helps 
the Soviet rulers because the various cruelties of Stalin's 
rule, and his disregard of freedom, his purges, killings, 
and slave-camps, etc., have aroused Anger the world over. 
The method of bringing out Lenin paves the way for restoring 
the Soviet system to a place of honor. At least, "coexist-
ence" must be like this. 4 
At the same time, it seems that the Soviet leaders 
really want to lessen-the pressure on the Soviet people, 
and in the past three years they may be said to have done 
.so little. Also while those- policies of Stalin's were 
cruel, yet at that time they were seen to be necessary, and 
were not discredited and left no traces to lessen "efforts 
to push agriculture," or "more severely to cause consumers 
to assume the task of heavy industry."

In a word, the new leaders, as Mr. Khrushchev now ad-
mits,'when they were grovelling in service to Stalin, suf-
fered many insults; and now we see that there has come 
about a situation more reasonable, more free, more humane. 
They plainly admit that Stalin's policies did not succeed. 
Outwardly, his cold war led the West to unite against the 
Soviet Union, and to build a terrifying military defensive' 
rampart; which rampart has proved itself a heavy road-
block in the way of Soviet economic growth; and also if 
continued, will cause more suffering to the Soviet people 
who have been in trouble for so long. Within the nation 
they have aroused a feeling of fear and unrest. 
In summary the psychological effect sought for by the 
reviving of the adulation of Lenin is to create among the 
satellite nations the identification of the current Soviet 
leadership with those qualities of wisdom, abilities to 
counsel and organize, and the harmonious leadership of 
Lenin which the satellite nations have not forgotten. The 
purpose of reviving this adulation of Lenin is also directed 
toward socialist elements abroad who have been alienated 
by Stalin's mistakes, but who still have respect for Lenin.

Saigon, Le Journal d'Extreme Orient, 6, June 
The Department of State has just published, without 
assuring its authenticity, a version of the "anti-Stalie 
speech delivered by Khrushchev at the 20th Congress of the 
Communist Party of the Soviet Union. 
The revelation of contents of this document causes some 
experts to think that Stalin was assassinated and was not 
victim of a cerebral hemorrhage as.-the official version 
has it. 
Khrushchev has reportedly stated in fact that Stalin 
was on the verge of launching a murderous purge against 
certain members of the Politburo, including Molotov and 
Mikoyan. "It is not be be excluded," he Zhrushchei7 has 
reportedly said, "that had Stalin remained at the helm for 
several months more, Comrades Molotov and Mikoyan would not 
have delivered speeches at this congress. Evidently, Stalin 
had plans to finish off the old members of the Politburo." 
Sensing that Stalin, driven by his morbid fear for con-
spiracy, would go ahead to eliminate them with his usual 
savageness, his most intimate collaborators wanted so much 
for him to disappear before their own condemnation. The 
American experts recognize, however, that the Khrushchev 
speech, even if it is justified in its assumptions, does 
not bear any conclusive indication on this historical riddle. 
This document is a long indictment against the person 
and his methods of dictatorship. Khrushchev has reportedly 
imputed to Stalin the abuses committed during the purges, 
the responsibility for the initial disaster of the war and 
the rupture with Yugoslavia, and the death of 70 per cent 
of the members of the Central Committee of the Party. 
Finally, he has reportedly exposed the conflkets which set 
the Communist despot against Wroshilov, Molotov, Mikoyan, 
and Zhukov.

Interview, Aidit, 5 July (as broadcast by radio) 
Jakarta--Stalin did more good than harm during the 
time he was in power in the USSR, Mr. Aidit, secretary 
general of the Indonesian Communist Party, said today.. 
He added: "Stalin's only fault was that he promoted the 
power of a single man instead of collective leadership." 
Mr. Aidit said that the Indonesian Communist Party--
the most important one in Southeast Asia--would continue 
"to consider Stalin one of the greatest leaders of Commu-
nism" and would keep his portrait on the walls of the 
Party headquarters in Jakarta.

THE 011122.11:40/01 Rik 
Despite their breast beating and 
self-accusation, the Communist lead-
ers refuse to face up to the central 
issue involved in the overthrow of 
the Stalin myth. The Communists 
outside of Soviet Russia, who boast 
that they have a "scientific" expla-
nation for everything, want to know 
how and why Stalin's crimes and the 
Stalin myth could happen. And the 
Moscow Communists, who proclaim ? 
the Marxist theory that history is - 
made not by individuals but by eco-
nomic forces and "class" action, now 
attempt to put all the blame for 
Stalinism on Sralin, 
But the real issue, long evident to 
free men everywhere, is that the 
horrors of Stalin's rule were not 
primarily the result of the aberra-
tions of Stalin or any other man 
but are instead inherent elements 
and inevitable products of the whole 
Communist system, which requires 
a Stalin to run it and therefore must 
always create a Stalin or collapse 
in chaos and revolt. 
The reasons why responsibility for 
these evils rests not so much on 
men as on the system are self-
evident. Communism represents a 
violent itnd in practice a permanent 
revolution to overthrow all non-
Communist social systems and Gov-
ernments and to wipe out all but one 
of the existing "classes" in order to 
establish a "dictatorship of the pro-
letariat" which annihilates all oppo-
nents. .When successful resistance 
by the. non-Communist world makes 
it, necessary, this revolution may he 
carried on, .as in the Thirties and 
now again, by the Trojan horse tac-
tic of temporary "coexistence" and 
a "united front" with "progressive" 
elements to capture parliaments and! 
bring. Communists to power legally.. 
But, as proclaimed anew by the 
Communist leaders themselves, the 1 
revolution is always the parainV.,. 
objective, to be pursued, when b. 
Communist resistance weakens, bjls 
violence, terror and war. 
In this revolution of extermination 
the end justifies the means and abro-
gates both the rights of the indi-
vidual and the mond and ethical 
restraints of civilization. Further-
more, since such a revolution. can be 
staged onlYWa.conspiracy,.tt Misfit 
be staged, as Lenin reeggnized, by a 
small group of ruthless men, who in 
turn will be dominated by the most 
ruthless among them. This man 
thereby inevitably becomes a dicta-
tor whose arbitrary will becomes 
law that spells life or death for 
millions. 
But the same inevitability of dic-
tatorial rule continues to prevail 
even after a Con?nunist system is 
established. For communism, even 
when called "socialism," rests in 
theory on "community" ownership 
of all means of production, distribu-
tion and exchange, which in practice, 
and despite the promise of a "with-
ering away" of the state, means a 
monopoly of state capitalism. This 
means expropriation and "liquida-
tion" of all "capitalists," from large 
industrialists to small shopkeepers 
and farmers, and the transfer of all 
productive property to the state. It 
means the centralized management, 
operation ,and planning of a whole 
national economy and every ?part of 
It. by a vast bureaucracy under a 
top command which makes the state 
the only employer and seeks to real-
ize its political aims and cover up 
its blunders and inefficiency by ter-
rorizing and exploiting both the 
managers and the workers to the 
point of making them all serfs of 
the state. Finally, it means the 
roestant prevention ind suppression 
of all opposition to MI system, 
whether due to men's innate desire 
for freedom or to a possessive in-
1i7 
?iiii-nit iiii,-hls Ore that- would inter-1 
fere with state operations. 
.All this demands and inevitably 
leads to a concentration of totali-
tarian power?not only political but 
also economic, social, educational 
and every other powers-in the top 
command of the state. And this top 
command is again the small groin) 
of ruthless men who have clawed 
their way to the top, and who, being 
usurpers, twist inevitably rule by 
means of a ruthless police terror. 
They may seek to "liberalize" their 
rule and decentralize their state op-
erations; they may temporarily 
tate Lenin's "new economic policy" 
An respect to rebellious peaSants; 
they may even pose as a "collective, 
leadership," But the end result is 
still dittatorship, ' -Which inevitably 
leads to the tyranny of the man who, 
in the constant struggle for power, 
is fastest on the trigger, and to 
poverty and human degradation for 
,the masses. 
In all this, C01111111111iSfil merely 
confirms . an ancient wisdom , sum-
marized by Lord Acton in the maxim 
that "power tends to corrupt and 
absolute power corrupts absolutely." 
The founding fathers of the United 
States knew it when they voted for 
the separation of political powers, 
not to speak of economic power. The 
Socialists realized it when they not 
only repudiated Marx' revolution in 
favor of democratic evolution but 
also, in view of the Soviet example 
and their own experience with no-
' tionalizationp of industry, began to 
veer away ftom total state owner-
ship. The unmasking of Stalin 
' should serve to warn those who still 
Isee in communism a short cut to 
linhistrial deveiopinent and do not 
reckon the price.

Reactions to and develop- ? 
merits since the Congress in the 
past four months have been 
varied. In many quarters, . 
eluding in certain Left circles, 
there are, some for whom the 
revelations about Stalin have 
taken up the whole horizon and 
who seem temporarily to have 
lost sight of the political if-
icanee and far-reaching 
of the 20th Congress as a whole. 
But there. is also a growing . 
number of non-C ommun is t 
groups and individuals who see 
in the 20th Congress, and in the 
very revelations about Stalin, 
a completely new possibility for 
re-evaluating their own views 
regarding relations wills Commu-
nists. And these past weeks have 
seen (not only in .New York) an 
increasing number of 'impor-
tant and stimulating Minimal I 
discussions taking place between 
Communists arid nm-Commu-
nist liberal and labor leaders. 
John Foster Dulles and the 
State Department recognize 
that there is a changing political 
climate abroad and at home, a 
change sharply away from the 
atmosphere of the -Cold War. 
They are keenly aware of the 
fact that the 20th Congress has 
stimulated this whole trend. 
The State Department for in-- , 
stance is uneasy at the rap-
prochement between Belgrade , 
and Moscow, the cutting of So-
viet armed forces, the Soviet 
invitation to General Twining, 
and the fact that a scone Gallop 
Isair

publication and Use of its ver-
sion of the special Khrusircheii 
report, it can disrupt the trend 
toward peaceful co-existence 
among Americans and the "nen- ? 
teals,' disorient the Left, and 
SOW disunity among Commu-
nists at home and abroad. 
But despite all efforts of the 
State Department, even some 
conservative spokesmen and 
many literals view the 20th 
Congress as inauguratisag a pe? 
riod in which the 'industrial and 
teclintilogical supremacy of U.S. 
capitalism will have in meet on 
an equal level with the historic, 
peaceful competition of Soviet 
socialism. And the, special report 
of Khruslichey is viewed in 
numerous non-Comemnist as 
well as in Cosiunuoist circles as 
an evidence of that strength and 
confidence which enables the 
Soviet Union today to break 
with some veto ',wistful features 
of the past, aod to pave the way 
for a vast expansion of democ-
racy in its internal We. 
This perspective and these 
changes wrist inevitably bring 
about modifications in the ?posi-
tions of all forward-kiaing 
groups, trade unionists, liberals, 
Socialists, no less ,than Commu-
nists. Anti it is the recognition of 
these big changes that has creat-
ed the growing number of re - 
ts for mutual chariges and 
re-
quests
mi discussions by non-

in a number of cities in An

THE KH1IUSHC11EV report 
on Stalin tells a tragic story. 
Shocking and painful as it is, 
however, it is a part of history, 
*ENNIS

we knew. Now belatedly, we 
see that the heroic path In the 
most monumental and progres-
sive advance in Minion history. 
was made all the more difficult 
at a certain period by shocking 
crimes and crass violations of 
socialist law and ethics. 
We especially, because we are 
Cornon u nists, understand and 
share the profound grief and 
shock of the Soviet people. The 
crimes and brutalities that sullied 
the tatter period of Stalin's lead-
unforgiveable. Nor 
did hey have any historical or 
"necessity." Netlike% 
can justify the use of tortures 
and rigged trials; large-scale de-
portations; provocative rend chau-
vinist adjusts as in the case of 
Yugoslavia; the pessecution of 
the few .M doctors and snuffing 
omit the lives of more than a score 
of Jewish cultural figures. 
Socialism could _sot continue 
to illow such terrible injustices 
to go undisclosed or unremedied. 
That is, the meaning of the ma-
?rally and politically courageous 
corrective measures undertaken 
in the Last three years. We can 
expect to see these measures am-
plified as IChrushebev's extremely 
frank report is critically discussed 
by millions of Soviet citizens. 
? 
. THERE ARE MANY ques-
tions about which A of us are 
thinking deeply. Many are the 
honest questions of friends, as 
well as of those who strongly 
disagree with us. Some axe the 
loaded questions pressed by the

State- DePariMenrinef its s 
voices . 
" Indio and press. 
Why did these things happen? 
Were they inevilible? Are they 
inherent in soCialtsm, in Com-
munist philosophy? 
A pet Theme of the State De-
, partinent is that the special 
Khruslichev report rejects "only" 
those injustices which were per-
petrated against "the wrong 
people." The claim is made that 
the refection of Stalin's methods 
must be ertended to the mice-, 
bon of Lenin and Leninism and 
of socialion as a whole. 
But not even the brazen ad-
vocate of atomic "brink of war" 
policies can obscure the history 
of the last four decades. The 
liberating teachings of .Lenin 
have already -triumphed in one-
of the globe. The socialist 
world system has arrived and. 
is irrevocably established. It 
wants and needs peace. It con-
siders that war is no longer in-
evitable, as it was in Lenin's time, 
that a thernso-imelear war would 
Inc a catastrophe, hut that it can 
be prevented. It is confidently 
competing on o pc-Ambit basis 
with capitalism in every. sphere 
of human aspiration and en-
deavor. It recognizes with a

socialises are mune and that in

two facts need be recalled. Un-

of the new Soviet Republic in 
1917 was to proclaim peace and

by how we boldly and creatively

These problems are now be-

only by us Communists, but by 
many labor, liberal, Left, and

groups. Opinions need not, -ind

There is room for much thought 
and expkvation inside and out-..

thought and action rooted in the 
political realities of our country. 
Above all, there is the need 
for greater mass political and 
economic activity, .such as 
around the key issues in the 
1956 elections, now, even while 
the current discussions go on. 
This, above all else can provide 
the framework for new gains

for the eventual emergence el 
a new mass party of socialism.

A FRATERNAL DISCUSSION 
lin Editorial 
WE PUBLISH hi this issue the complete text of a 
statement by the Central Committee of the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union on the Stalin discussion. 
This discussion, now going on among the various 
Comnitunist Parties, is something new in the history of the 
communist movements. . 
It is a fraternal, critical discussion, conducted on an 
equal basis among Marxists who are seeking the scientific 
answers to profound questions of importance to them-
selves, to the workingclass and to the general cause of 
democracy and .socialism. 
This discussion confounds the foes of socialism who 
Insist that there is nothing new in the Communist move;. 
?mews and that the unmistakable evidence of independence 
and equality is all a "plot." 
- The _recent declaration of the Communist Parties of 
the Soviet Union and of. Yugoslavia stated that the "tide-
gatkms have agreed, guided by the principles of Marxism- - 
Leninism, to a prompt mutual cooperation and exchange 
of views in tin field of socialist scientific thought both in 
their mutual relations and in the international workers' 
movement in general." 
It is in this .spirit that various Communist Parties, ,in-
chiding the American, raised questions regarding the 
speech of Nikita Khruslichev on Stalin?particularly with 
regard to the need for a deeper explanation of the errors 
and crimes ascribed to Stalin. 
In the latest chapter in this discussion, the Central 
Committee of the Coimminist Party of the Soviet Union 
has now given its reply to some of these questions. Many 
Marxists will feel satisfied ,with the answers which the, 
Soviet communist Party now presents. Many will feel that 
the final answers still need to be found and that the dis-
cussion must continue. 
The Daily Worker will have more to say on the So-
viet Communist Party's statement in the future and we 
will keep our readers informed, as the discussion goes on, 
of the views of Marxists here and throughout the world. 
A deeper probing of the errors in the Soviet Union 
can only result in speeding the profound changes already 
getting under way in that country. It can be of invalnable 
help to the Communist movements elsewhere, and to the 
cause of co-existence and world peace.

Washington Post 
July 2 1956 
Matter of Fact . 
Was Stalin Murdered?  
ABOUT. A WEEK after Jo-
iteph Stalin died, one of these 
reporters had a long talk with 
George Kennan, who had very 
recently been recalled as Am-
bassador to the Soviet Union. 
Kerman ventured a prediction 
about the future and a guess 
about the immediate past, and 
both are worth recalling in 
view of what has happened 
since, 
Kennan's prediction w a 
that Stalin might very well 
become within a few years the 
chief ideological devil of the 
Soviet Union and world com-
munism. It seemed a strange 
notion at the time, since 
Khrushchev and Company in 
Moscow, and all important 
Communists elsewhere, were 
vying with each other in ful-
some tributes to the "great 
Inst leader." But in the light 
of recent 'events, Kennan's 
prediction about the future 
lends added weight to his 
guess about the past. 
Kennan's guess was that the 
men around Stalin had mur-
dered him, or at least been 
implicated in his death, lie 
had, Kennan said, no solid 
evidence that Stalin had been 
murdered, any more than he 
had solid evidence that Stalin 
would become an ideological 
devil. In both cases, it was 
a matter of atmosphere and 
of instinct. Kennan vividly 
described the atmosphere in 
Moscow which he had so re-
cently left?the fear and ha-
tred of the old tyrant so thick 
In the air that you could al-
most smell it. 
IF STALIN was not a mad-
man before he died, Kennan 
said, he was just this side of 
madness a judgment fully, 
vindicated by Nikita Khrush-
chev's hair-raising description 
of Stalin's last years. It seemed 
to Kennan a reasonable con-
jecture that Stalin's subordi-
nates had done away with him, 
_ 
? ? ? ?By Joseph and Stewart Alsop 
not only to save their own 
lives but because the struc-
ture of Soviet power might be 
endangered by the dictator's 
near madness. 
Kennan's guess was only a 
guess, and there is still no 
positive proof that Stalin was 
murdered. But if you re-read 
Khrushchev's famous speech, 
in which he denounced Stalin 
as a murderer, and consider 
? other recent events in the 
light of Kennan's guess, it be-
gins to seem rather like the 
missing piece of a puzzle. 
W h y, for example, did 
Khrushchev make his speech 
at all? This is the question 
which has mystified all the 
experts. Before the speech 
Kennan's successor, the able 
Charles E. Bohlen, and every 
other diplomatic observer in 
Moscow had reported that the 
Khrushchev-Bulganin regime 
w as solidly installed. For 
more than a year a carefully 
planned process of chipping 
away at Stalin's reputation had 
been in progress. 
WHY, THEN, should 
Khrushchev abandon the 
chisel for the meat axe and 
hack away so ruthlessly at the 
memory of the dead dictator? 
He no doubt underestimated 
the risks he was taking, but 
he is a shrewd man, and he 
must have known that the 
risks were real and grave. 
Why take them? 
If Kennan's guess was accu-
rate, the answer is clear. A 
collective sense of blood guilt 
can be a source of unity, and 
could in part explain why the 
"collective leadership" has 
worked successfully, contrary 
to many expert predictions. 
But blood guilt can also be a 
source of danger, the danger 
of blackmail by a party to the 
secret. There are two ways of 
dealing with such a danger. 
There is Stalin's way, killing 
all who knew the secret. The 
other way is to transform the 
act itself into a necessary and 
even laudable one. 
Certain passages of Khrush-
climes speech also take on a 
new meaning in the light of 
Kennan's guess. For example, 
Khrushchev singled out Molo-
tov and Mikoyan by name, and 
said that even they would not 
have survived had Stalin lived. 
Mikoyan and Molotov, 
Kennan has speculated, are 
precisely the two men who 
were almost certainly not 
Implicated in Stalin's death?
Mikoyan hated Stalin, but he 
is a cautious man, and Molotov 
retained to the end a spaniel-
like devotion to his cruel 
master Thus Khrushchev's 
words may have been a warn-
ing and a reminder. The 
whole tone of Khrushchev's 
speech, in fact, with its re-
peated emphasis on Stalin as 
a murderer, supports Ken-
nan's conjecture for murder 
Is the natural retribution for 
murder. 
FINALLY, there is the more 
recent mystery. Why did 
Pravda, Khrushchev's own 
party newspaper, publish an 
article by the American Com-
munist Eugene Dennis, criti-
cizing Khrushchev by name, 
and asking why he and his 
colleagues did nothing to pre-
vent Stalin's crimes? Such an 
article in the Soviet press has 
always been the prelude to an 
official answer. Might not the 
answer be that Khrushchev 
and his colleagues did indeed 
do something, and something 
rather drastic and decisive to 
curb the murdering tyrant? 
Perhaps it will never be 
known for certain whether 
Kennan's conjecture was as 
accurate as his prediction. 
But at least Kennan's guess 
throws an interesting new 
light on the events which have 
shaken the whole structure of 
Soviet power.

Washington Daily News 
July 9 1956 
Soviet Signs in tile Win 
pAata. July. 9?The West is watch-
ing two tests this week of the 
Soviet "new look." 
One is the treatment of the Poles 
arrested in the Poznan massacre. 
The other will be the Moscow meet-
Mg of the Supreme Soviet Wednes-
day. 
The de-Stalinization campaign has 
been an attempt to persuade the 
Russians, their satellite peoples, the 
neutral countries and the NATO 
nations to trust a regime which no-
body trusts in fact?not even the 
communists. 
This was to be done by making Stalin the sole 
criminal for all the long bloody record shared by 
Stalinist Khrushchev and Co. 
Under this "change," the Russian people would 
work harder, the satellites would prefer chains to 
freedom, the neutral countries would become "peace 
partners" of Moscow, and NATO defense would melt 
sway under the warmth of Soviet smiles and arms 
"reduction." 
? * 
THIS trick worked well?up to a point. It won some 
co-operation inside Russia and the satellites. It 
softened up Marshal Tito and lured Yugoslavia back 
toward the fold. It brought more countries into the 
neutral camp, and spread appeasement in the West. 
But the Soviet trick was not quite perfect, There 
could be no obvious return to the 'old look" without 
flaking the whitewash off Khrushchev and Co. 
The satellite peoples, encouraged by the slight re-
laxing, soon began to ask when their Stalinist dictators 
would be fired and when they were going to get 
more bread and freedom. Allied governments began 
to ask when Khrushchev was going to submit his 
155 
By Ludwell Denny 
'Disarmament" to an international inspection inforce-
ment agency, and make good his pledge for German 
reunification and free elections in the Soviet zone. 
Some answers are now in. The others will be indi-
cated at least in part by the Poznan "trials'' and the 
Supreme Soviet meeting. 
Kremlin acts already prove there is no basic change 
In forejgn policy. But many intellectuals, laborites and 
nationalists of Western Europe are still hopeful of a 
"basic change" in Kremlin criminality and aggression. 
Hence the importance of Poznan. The ruthless mass-
acre of Polish demonstrators crying for bread is hard 
for any non-communist to explain away. 
Therefore, the Socialist International Organization, 
the European committees, hi-partisan groups of Brit-
ish and other parliamentary members, the trades 
unions and even neutralist newspapers, are demanding 
a public, fair trail for the Imprisoned Poznan demon-
Strators. 
Of 'course, nobody will ever know how many have 
been executed. But unless the Kremlin permits the 
Polish puppet dictatorship to hold a few show trials 
and release some Innocent victims of Its fantastic 
"foreign agent" charge, Ithrushchev's deStaliniza-
tion propaganda will begin to flop, eirerywhere. 
? ? ? 
Kremlin's problem before the rubber-stamp 
? Supreme Soviet is less damatic but similar to the 
Polish problem?how to denounce Stalin without de-
Stallnizing? How to maintain a dictatorship without 
police state terror now? Above all how to give the 
Soviet and satellite slaves more bread without cutting 
back heavy industry priorities for global supremacy? 
One easy answer will be shouted to all these ques-
tions: "American imperialists and militarists are to 
blame for everything?including Stalin." That's not as 
effective propaganda as it used to be. The Kremlin is 
beginning to hurt.

France, Poland, Bulgaria Czechoslo-

either gone or sent trusted agents 
to the Soviet Union to find out what 
is going on. They are likely, to be 
startled. 
For Khrushchev has resolved to 
let the Russian people in on the open 
secret of his anti-Stalin views. He 
had already disclosed these to the 
February Bolshevik Congress and 
distributed various documents sup-
porting his diatribe. Substantial por-
tions of his speech have been printed 
and sent out to party _agitators both 
within the U.S. S. R. and the satel-
Rtes. 
The Next Steps 
Now he has decided to go further. 
Next month, when the Supreme So-
viet meets, the "Stalin Constitution" 
of 1936 will be revised. Further-
more, the entire text of the famous 
February speech will be published. 
Moscow contends that the State 
Department's version is incomplete. 
Together with this sensational 
document the Bolshevik leadership 
plans to circulate Lenin's so-called 
"testament," in which the first rev-
olutionary boas denigrated Stalin. 
Finally the minutes of the Central 
Committee meeting in which Stalin 
was named general secretary of the 
party and promised faithfully to fol. 
low in Lenin's footsteps will be 
printed. 
The East German Precedent 
It is unlikely that even the bloody 
Poznan strike will deter Khrushchev 
from this audacious program. For, 
lunhaPpily enough the uprising 
seems doomed to go down in history 
as a repetition of the huge 1953 
demonstrations in East Germany. 
In that instance the Western 
World sat by uncomfortably while 
Soviet troops and tanks squashed 
Incipient rebellion. Then the pbppet 
Pankow Governmmit revised a few 
of its most irritabnit restrictive 
measures that heditriven the work-
ers to desperation. 
An Awkward Positi? on, 
Certain observers feel the Polish 
police authorities mit have known 
in advance that some form of action 
was contemplated in Poznan. They 
may even have planned to permit it 
?until it got out of hand. In any 'I 
event, however, the local militia and 
army appear amply strong to quell 
it without, visible Soviet assistance. 
If this proves to be the case, the 
West will again be left in the embar-
rassed position of supporting free-
dom and advocating it in its official 
propaganda but proving powerless 
to really help. It is much like the 
legend of the Italian officer during 
World War I who summoned his 
platoon around him in a trench, 
shouted "Avanti" and rushed off on 
a charge. "Bravo" shouted his sol-
diers, laying down their arms to 
watch him and applaud. 
Lack of Consultation 
Unfortunately, despite the urging 
of many diplomatic experts, the 
Allied powers never got together 
after the East German insurrection 
to decide what, if anything, could be 
done were such an uprising to recur 
behind the Iron Curtain. The answer 
certainly is not easy. But there is 
no evidence that the West has ever 
seriously sought to find it or to Co-
-ordinate Its own position. 
Surely this is now urgently neces-
sary. For, after the meetings of 
Communist leaders commencing in 
Moscow and after the sensational 
developments contemplated at next 
month's gathering of the Supreme 
Soviet, a new wave of reactions. 
hopes, _debates and possibly turbu-
lence limy again shiver through the 
orbit. 
Communist Worries 
Khrushehev is making an ex-
traordinary experiment with forms 
of liberty and independent thinking 
to which the people of the U. S. S. R. 
are not accustomed. Therefore, even 
the most expert Communist politi-
cians cannot with' certainty predict 
eventual results. But, while Russia 
has been habituated to Belshevik 
dictatorship for almost,Iour decades 
and to Czarist autocracy for many 
centuries, no such submissive tradi-
tions are inherent in the satellites. 
This is clearly what worries the 
delegates from the East European 
capitals who are seeking counsel in 
Moscow. How are they to ration 
original, thinking among their re-
sentful popolations when the. food 
for thought Is being ladled out right 
In the Kremlin? And how, ask the 
party, bosses of Italy and Prance, 
are they to keep their organizations 
'together as vihrinit7P4tleaf lorce 
when all the idols they ,have been 
'trained to adore are being toppled? 
' .The great paradox of, 'communism 
Is being unveiled to those who 'wor-
ship it. This is the proof, as cited 
by Khrushchev, that the most evil 
type' of classical dictatorship cannot 
only occur but can develop in its 
most abhorrent form within a, class-
:less society. Obviously this proves 
the dialectics of Marxism-Leninism 
must be wrong. What, the Commu-
nists' must be inquiring of each 
other, can be done about tails star-
tling fact they now, acknowledge? 
Is Poznan?and brutal repression?
again to be the only answer?

Orwell in Pravda ? 
- 
In connection with their continuing 
de-Stalinization program (it might also 
be called a fumigating operation), Rus-
sia's "collective leaders" have been at 
pains to declare that theirs is "a truly 
democratic popular? regime." However, 
speaking through a follow-up editorial in 
Pravda, they have hastened to add that 
nothing could be more foolish than sug-
gestions, from the outside world that the , 
Kremlin may in due course permit the 
establishment of opposition political par-
ties in the Soviet Union. 
To Westerners, of course, it is an 
absolute contradiction in terms for any 
government to say that it presides over 
a "democracy" while at the same time 
severely proclaiming that it will tolerate 
the existence of no political party other 
than its own. But Mr. Khrushchey and 
his colleagues?expert as they are in the 
totalitarian art of turning reality and the 
meaning of words completely upside 
down?have given us a typical Communist 
'explanation of this most ingenious and 
absurd paradox. Reading like something 
from George Orwell's "Animal Farm" or 
"1984," it, is an explanation that ought 
to be mulled over by all who have enter-
tained the hope ,thatk post-Stalin Russia 
may now be starting to move, slowly but 
surely, toward genuine freedom. , 
As set forth in Pravda, the explana-
tion begins by asking why there is only 
one political organization in the USSR. 
157 
There then follows an answer that upends 
all common sense and chops logic to the 
point of massacre. But let the "collec-
tive leaders" speak for themselves in this 
gem of Orwellian fantasy. As they por-
tray it, the Soviet Union?unlike "bour-
geois" countries, which are made up of 
many clashing groups?is a fully "unified 
society", so blessedly lacking in "antago-
nistic classes" and so much in agreement 
with itself that "there is no social 
ground . .. for the creation and existence 
of other parties in addition to the Corn-
, munist Party." Hence, in Pravda's words, 
"the Communist Party has been and will 
be the only master of the minds anll 
thoughts" and actions of the Russian 
, people. 
Moreover, emphasizing that they "are 
in no need" of any other kind of political 
representation, Pravda quotes from Lenin 
to warn that the Russian people must 
work with "absolute subordination" under 
the "iron discipline" of the Communist 
Party. This says about all that needs to 
be said at the moment. Clearly, even 
with Stalin dead and defamed, the Soviet 
' "democracy" apparently intends to re-
main essentially as hard and as despotic 
a taskmaster as ever. And inherent in 
it?despite the present "collective" and 
smiling nature of its dictatorship?is the 
substance of a tyranny still capable of 
committing crimes at least as vast and 
monstrous as its predecessor's. The free 
world would be recklessly wishful to think 
otherwise.

THE SOVIET "EXPLANATION" 
Responding to the clamor created 
by the State Department's publica-
tion of Khrushchev's secret attack 
on Stalin, the Soviet Communist 
party's Central Committee has is-
sued an answer designed to still un-
rest among foreign Communists. 
Whether it will achieve that objec-
tive remains to be seen. Italian 
Communist leader Palmiro Togliatti 
has indicated approval of the new 
statement but has not retracted his 
original assertions about Soviet "de-
generation." The Daily Worker 
, here has indicated that not all 
American Communists may be fullY 
satisfied. 
Fortunately, we of the free world 
ere not subject to any compulsion 
to fol,;-ow Moscow blindly. Exam-
inlr,g the new Soviet Communist 
statement objectively, it soon be-
comes clear that it is a dishonest 
document, based upon false premises 
and deliberately aimed to divert at-
tention from the really basic ques-
tions raised by Stalin's crimes. There 
Is even considerable na?t?n the 
statement, as when it asserts that no 
capitalist country would ever admit 
? to making mistakes. Whoever wrote 
that seems to have forgotten that 
In free countries it is precisely the 
function of opposition parties and 
of the free press to point out such 
mistakes. Only in a one-party dic-
tatorship can the ruling group hide 
monstrous crimes, as was done in 
Russia for 'so long. 
What emerges most clearly from 
? the statement is that 'the present 
rulers in Moscow refuse to account 
for their own personal role in, 
Stalin's criminal rule. Their pre-
tense that they dared nqt move 
against Stalin because he was so 
"popular" is obviously nonsense. 
They were Stalin's closest hench-. 
men, creatures he had elevated to 
positions. of, power and privilege. 
When he died, their claim to con-
tinued power was that they had 
been his closest "comrades at arms." 
While he lived, they led the chorus 
0P-sycophantic adulation for Stalin. 
How can they now escape respon-
sibility as his accomplices? 
The statement also makes clear 
that the present rulers :wish to as-
sure perpetuation of their dictatorial 
rule. They repeat again the myth 
that the means of production are in 
the hands of the workers and peas-
ants. They deny that the bases of ' 
Stalinist misrule must be sought in 
the Soviet system.' The former as-
sertion is patently disproved by 
Khruslichey's own description of 
Stalin's absolute power. The latter 
denial is an astounding rejection of 
Marxism by men who claim to be 
Marxists. Stalin could never have 
achieved his absolute power if there 
were not stroug forces within the 
country whom his rule benefited. 
Those forces, of course, came from 
the bureaucracy which ruled under 
him, oppressed the great majority 
of Soviet people and diverted to it-
self and its own consumption a vast-
ly disproportionate portion of the 
national income. A leading Hun-
garian writer recently described his 
country's Government as a "regime 
of gendarmes and bureaucrats." Was 
that not the nature of Stalin's re-
gime yesterday, and of his succes-
sors' regime today? 
Moscow's statement attempts to 
justify Stalin's dictatorship on the 
ground it was necessary to ,combat 
external enemies and to transform 
the Soviet Union. The first justifi-
cation is a lie, as shown by the ease 
with which Hitler and Stalin joined 
together in 1939 to partition Poland.. 
. . _ 
The two dictators showed then they 
had much more in common than 
either had with the democracies. 
The real reason for the dictatorship 
was that Stalin's regime conducted 
a bitter war against the great ma-
jority' of its people.. No democratic 
society could have robbed the Soviet 
peasantry of its land and forced thd 
enormous -sacrifices required US 
build up Soviet heavy industry' at 
such a breakneck pace. It is the 
fact of this war agitinst the Soviet 
people which Moscow fears to face, 
for in this facet qf the matter are 
concealed Stalinist , crimes, which 
are also crimes of the present rulers. 
It would have been unreasonable. 
to expect a straightforward account-
ing from those now ruling in Mos-
cow. Such an accounting would re-
quire a really revolutionary, demo-
cratic transformation of the Soviet 
Union.  But the  effort to unload all 
Soviet crimes on the sole persohality 
of Stalin necessarily involves 'so 
many internal untruths and contra-
dictions that it cansot long fool any-
one who can think for himself. An 
explanation that does not really ex-
plain cannot end the turmoil that 
has been growing in recent months.

Explosion .at Poznan 
Like the East Germans in June of 
1953, the Poles of Poznan have now 
erupted irij'o a world-resounding explo-
sion of pent-bp feelings against Commu-
nist-imposed hunger and tyranny. At a 
cost of much bloodshed, their brief 
uprising apparently has been suppressed. 
But what they have done?as rank-and-
file workers bravely defying the tanks 
and guns of the Red regime?represents 
a spirit that is ineradicable, and there 
can be no doubt that it is a spirit shared 
? by the vast majority of their countrymen. 
The Polish people, after all, are over-
whelmingly Catholic. More than that, 
throughout the centuries of their history, 
there has been bred into their blood and 
bones an intense sense of nationalism 
intermingled with a profound hostility 
toward Russian imperialism, czarist and 
' Soviet alike. Repeatedly in the past, just( 
as now, they have demonstrated?some-
times with what might be called a reck-
less but altogether admirable romanti-
cism?a devotion to independence so deep 
and fierce as to make them fight for their 
own, regardless of cost, even against the 
worst kind of odds. The Poznan "revolt" 
is one example of this ekceptional trait 
of theirs, and another ,can be found in 
the story of how their cava10?armed 
only with sabers?threw itself unflinch-
ingly against , the massive armor of 
Hitler's invading legions. 
159 
So it is not surprising that these 
people have regarded the Kremlin-serving 
Warsaw regime as an alien and hateful? 
thing ever since it was imposed on them. 
In recent weeks, in keeping with Moscow's 
de-Stalinization program, the regime has 
proclaimed numerous liberalizing reforms 
?more of them, in fact, than in any other 
Soviet satellite?but this sop-throwing 
program has not been good enough or 
thorough enough to satisfy the great mass 
of Poles. Their violent march in Poznan 
Is proof of that?an uprising reflecting 
hot only a desperate desire for an end 
to miserably low living standards, but 
also a passionate yearning for independ-
ence. Their hunger, in short, is not for 
bodily food alone, but for the substance 
of national freedom as well?a hunger to 
be rid of the Red tyranny, a hunger to 
he genuinely their own masters. 
What remains to be seen now is 
whether the post-Stalin Kremlin, operat-
ing through the Warsaw Communists, 
will react with savage measures, or 
whether?as in East Germany three years 
ago?some placating moves will be made. 
The answer, one way or the other, should 
become clear in due course. Meanwhile, 
whatever? may develop in the form of 
oppression or concession, the world can 
be sure of this: That the Poznan explo-
sion, far from being a mere flash of tem-
porary temper, is symptomatic of the 
volcanic pro-freedom forces that rumble 
? everywhere beneath the seemingly solid 
surface of the Red empire.

JUN 29 1956 
The 'Big 
The gist of niost of the Communist 
reaction outside the Iron Curtain to the 
Attacks upon Josef Stalin has been to 
agree that the late dictator was (in Eu-
gene Dennis' words) guilty of "crimes 
and brutalities." But they have also 
asked some questions of the present 
"collective leadership" ? comprising men 
who were high in Stalin's councils. "Did 
any of them," wrote Mr Dennis in the 
New York "Daily Worker," "attempt to 
change anything in the period which 
preceded the last three years? Could one 
have stopped the evil goings-on earlier?" 
This, of course, is the big question.. It 
applies not only to Khrushchev & Co.?
although with most force to them?but to 
every one, including Mr. Dennis, who 
slavishly followed the Stalinist line while 
the Red emperor was alive and only 
dared speak of his crimes after he was 
dead and repudiated by his successors. 
For the crimes of Stalin were not news 
to any literate person when Khrushchev 
listed them. They had been published 
and republished in the press of the free 
world. Mr. Khrushchev supplied soma 
pertinent details, but the most important 
fact of his speech was that he made it at 
all, and acknowledged the truth of what 
the world knew, but the Communists 
woulst not admit. By so doing, he opened 
the door to questions concerning his own 
role?and that of Premier Bulganin, and 
the rest of the Soviet hierarchy. 
Long experience of Communist disci-
pline in the face of the twists of Soviet 
policy naturally makes the free peoples 
suspicious of the unanimity with which 
the Communists outside the Soviet Union 
walked through that door, and asked the 
questions. It could well be that the 
ground is being prepared, as official 
Washington assumes, for a calculated an
one that will serve the current 
party purpose of Waking itself attractive 
to "popular front" movements and na-
tionalist drives throughout the world. It 
could also be, as Mr. Dulles suggests, that 
this process of criticism of the Soviet 
leaders by their hitherto subservient tools 
In other lands may get out of hand, and 
uestion 
that discipline may never be restored. 
But there will haVe to be much more evi-
dence, much clearer indications of the 
drift of Communist policy, before that 
possibility can be taken as a solid basis 
for Western policy. 
Meanwhile, Moscow's answer to its 
Communist critics will be awaited with 
skeptical interest. Mr. Khrushchev was 
very foggy in discussing his own share of 
responsibility for Stalin's misdeeds. He 
posed the big question himself: "Where 
were the members of the Political Bureau 
of the Central Committee? Why did they 
not assert themselves against the cult of 
the individual in time?" But his answers 
were. hardly complimentary to him or his 
colleagues. 
First, they had supported Stalin as 
"one of the strongest Marxists." What he 
had done against the peasants and the 
workers in enforcing collectivization and 
Industrialization had their approval. 
Then, when he turned his "terroristic 
methods" against his own supporters: 
"Attempts to oppose groundless suspi-
cions and charges resulted in the oppo-
nent falling victim of the repression." 
Finally, the Central Committee was 
never, and the Politburo seldom, con-
vened. By Juggling the administration, 
Stalin kept it in his own hands or that 
of his most pliant assistants. But the 
nub of the matter was that Khrushchev 
& Co. saw nothing wrong with terrorism 
until it threatened themselves, end then 
they were too terrified to oppose it. 
These answers do not seem to satisfy 
the Communists outside the Soviet Union 
?who are guilty of the same kind of 
intellectual cowardice. They certainly do 
not satisfy the free world. If the present 
Soviet leadership produces new answers, 
the old must not be forgotten. A system 
based on fear ruled international Com-
munism ,under Stalin. Mr. Khrushchev 
did not attack the system except in One 
aspect?"the cult of the individual." The 
system remains?the evil thing has not 
been wiped out by a speech, nor by the 
remarkably unanimous reaction of world 
Communism to that Speech.

Back to Heel 
"It would be wrong," declared the Cen-
tral Committee of the Communist Party 
of the U.S.S.R. last week, "to close one's 
eyes to the fact that certain of our friends 
abroad have not got to the bottom of the 
question of the personality cult." When it 
comes to getting to the bottom of some-
thing, nobody can beat the Kremlin's lead-
ers. Etoavn they went in their hip hoots, 
-sloshing around in a swamp of doubletalk, 
and throwing little bits of misinformation 
behind them, like cracker crumbs, for 
those who tried to follow them. But they 
were not very helpful guides for those who 
anxiously sought answers to the questions 
implicit in Khrushchev's historic attack 
on Stalin at the 20th Party Congress 
(MR, June 1s). 
Moscow's, long silence had been desper-
ately. hard on Western Communist lead-
em who, unlike their Russian masters, can-
not rely on police terror and a controlled 
press to maintain discipline among the 
rank and file. Left to their own devices, 
men like Italy's Paltuiro Togliatti, leader 
of the biggest Communist Party (2,130.-
000 members) outside the Iron Curtain, 
had begun to make their own explana-
tions, and to talk recklessly of "polycerr-
trism," i.e., independent policies for each 
of the world's Communist parties. To-
gliatti echoed publicly the unsatisfied 
questions of his own disillusioned fol-
lowers: How could a tyrant like Sta-
lin come to power under the Communist. 
system? Why had the Kremlin leaders 
who now denounced Stalin tolerated his 
tyranny? 
Making Explanations. What Togliatti 
demanded was a "Marxist" explanation of 
Stalinism, i.e., an explanation of particu-
lar events in terms of vast, impersonal 
historic forces. One such explanation?and 
the obvious one?for Stalin's rise to arbi-
trary power is the absence of checks 
and balances in the Communist system. 
Unable to concede this, Moscow's Central 
Committee offered an explanation which 
explained nothing: "The development of 
the personality cult was to an enormous 
extent contributed to by some individual 
traits of J. V. Stalio." 
Firmly repudiating Togliatti's sugges-
tion that Russia's present leaders were, 
"co-responsible" with Stalin, the Central, 
Committee advanced for the first time the 
unsubstantiated claim that there had in. 
fact been a staunch "Leninist core" of the 
Central Committee arid that on occasion 
it opposed Stalin's arbitrary use of power. 
""Phere were certain periods, for instance 
during the War years when the individual 
acts of Stalin were sharply restricted . . 
Members of the Central Committee and 
Soviet war 'commanders 
took over certain sectors of activity in the 
rear, and at the front made independent 
decisions." 
Who's a Coward? "If might be asked," 
noted the resolution, "why these people 
did not take an opekeand against. Stalin 
and remove him froni leadership." The 
answer, said the Central, Committee, flatly 
contradicting Khrustichev's earlier admis-. 
sion that Stalin's subordinates were afraid 
to risk their necks, was not "that there 
was a lack of persona! courage." It was, 
rather, that: 
III "The success of Socialist construction 
and the consolidation of the U.S.S.R. were 
attributed to Stalin . . Anyone who had 
acted in that. _situation against Stalin 
would not have received support from 
the people." 
Ii "Such a stand would have been regard-
ed as . . . a blow against the unity of the 
party and the whole state." 
II "The successes which . . the Soviet 
Union- attained . . . treated an attrnos-
phere in which individual enistak.es and 
shortcomiogs seemed less important." 
flj "Many wrong actions" of Stalin, espe-
cially as regards the violation of Soviet. 
Jaw, became known only after his death." 
Coming from the old. Stalin gang who 
_ 
had prospered under him, executed his 
will and shared his guilt, this explanation, 
was feeble indeed. In the light of the 
searching and troubled questions asked by 
Togliatti, France's Thorea and. other patty 
leaders abroad, it MIPS in fact so intellec-
tually weak as to be insulting. Worse yet, 
from Togliatti's point of view, the resolu-
tion contained the -first public rebuke he 
had ever received from Moscow. Snapped 
the Central Committee; "One cannot in 
Particular agree with Comrade Togliatti 
when he asks whether Soviet society has 
not reached 'certain forms of degenera-
tion."There are no foundations for such 
a question." 
But one thing it did do was to show 
who was boss. Responding to the whistle 
like a well-trained dog, Moscow-wise Pal-
Miro Togliatti promptly came to heel He 
voiced "unreserved approval" of "the line 
followed by the Soviet comrades in the 
construction of a socialist society." Then, 
to get a little better rending on just what 
the line was, he dispatched to Moscow a 
team of three top Italian Communists. In 
France, party leaders announced that they 
were satisfied with the explanation too. 
For the present at least, all the brave talk 
of polycentrism and individual thinking 
was at an end. Or supposed to be.

The Stalinists Case 
Against Stalin 
ISAAC DEUTSCHE!! 
No oxr who has seen and heard 
Nikita Khrushchev speaking on 
a platform or arguing with people 
will doubt the authenticity of the 
text, published by the State Depart-
ment, of his secret speech at the 
Twentieth Congress of the Soviet 
Communist Party. The text prob-
ably has its gaps, and here and there 
the transcript may not be quite ac-
curate. Nevertheless this is the real 
thing?genuine Khrushchev saying 
indirectly about himself almost as 
much as about Stalin. 
Yet Khrushchev also gives the 
impression of an actor who, while 
he plays his own part with superb 
self-assurance, is only half aware of 
his own place in the great, complex, 
somber drama in which he has been 
involved. His long monologue is a 
cry from the heart, a cry about the 
tragedy of the Russian Revolution 
and of the Bolshevik Party, but it 
is only a fragment of the tragedy. 
Impromptu laditissent 
Khrushchev himself did not ex-
pect to burst out with this cry. Only 
a few days before he made the secret 
speech, he did not know that be 
was going to make it, or at any 
rate he did not know what he was 
going to say. Even the composition 
of his speech showed that he spoke 
more or less impromptu: He dashed 
from topic to topic almost indis-
criminately; he ventured spontane-
ously into sidelines; and he threw 
out reminiscences and confidences 
and asides as they occurred to him. 
By its irregularity this speech, de-
livered at the closing session of the 
Congress, on February 24 and 25, 
contrasted curiously with WS-formal 
address at the inaugural session ten 
days earlier. The two speeches con-
trast strikingly in content as well. 
In his inaugural address Khru-
shchev said, for instance: 
"The unity of our party has 
formed, itself in the course of years 
and tens of years. It has grown and 
become tempered in the struggle 
against many enemies. The Trotsky-
ites, Bukharinites, bourgeois nation-
alists, and other most wicked en-
emies of the people [italics ours), 
champions of a capitalist restora-
tion, made desperate efforts to dis-
rupt from the inside the Leninist 
unity of our party, and they all have 
smashed their heads against our 
unity." 
The words might have come 
straight from Stalin's mouth. But 
ten days later Khrushchev said: 
"It is Stalin who originated the 
concept 'enemy of the people.' This 
term automatically rendered it un-
necessary that the ideological errors 
of a man, or men, engaged in 'a con-
troversy be proven; this term made 
possible the usage of the most cruel 
repression . . . against anyone who 
in any way disagreed with Stalin..." 
Khrushchev then went on to say 
that the Trotskyites, Bukharinites, 
and so-called bourgeois nationalists, 
whatever their faults, were not en-
emies of the people; that there was 
no need to annihilate them; and 
that they "smashed their heads" not 
against the party's "Leninist unity" 
but against Stalin's despotism. 
CI.F.ARLY, some dramatic but as 
yet undisclosed event must have

change Khrushchev's tune so radi-
cally, an event which showed 
Khrushchev that it would not_do to 
sit on the fence and that in the con-
flict between Stalinism and anti. 
Stalinism he had to come down on 
one side or the other. Did perhaps 
the small band of Old Bolsheviks, 
wrecks from Stalin's concentration 
camps who had been brought to the 
conference hall as guests of honor, 
stage some demonstration of protest 
that shook the assembly's conscience? 
Or were the young delegates, who 
were brought up in the Stalin cult, 
so restive alter Khrushchev's first 
ambiguous hints about -Stalin .(and 
even more so after Mikorm's more 
outspoken remarks) that they forced 
him to come out into the open? 
Whatever happened, Khrushchev 
had to produce an answer on the 
spot, and the answer was an indict-
ment of Stalin. To justify his new 
attitude, he ordered, no doubt with 
the Presidium's approval, that Len-
in's. testament?that long-stippressed 
testament in which Lenin urged the 
party to remove Stalin from the post 
of General Secretary?be distributed 
.among the delegates. 
To the student of Soviet affaim 
Khrushchev's disclosures bring lit-
tle that is really new. A biographer

points. Khrushchev confirms in every 
detail Trotsky's account of the re-
lations between Lenin and Stalin to-
ward the end of Lenin's life. Stalin's 
old critics are also proved right in 
what they said about his method of 
collectivization, about ? the purges, 
and about the Trotskyite and Bu-
kbarinite "fifth columns?' Nor is there 
anything surprising to the historian 
in Khrushchev's revelations about 
Stalin's role in the last war and 
about his miscalculations. 
.However, it is not front the .his-
torian's viewpoint that Khrushchev's 
performance should be judged. He

probing restlessly into its tiwn mys-
terious past. But this is still the 
Stalinist factiim, caught in the tan-
gle of its own experiences and its 
traditional but now untenable view-
points. 
The l'ungle of Reasoning 
Khruslichev has described how 
the members of the Presidium, the 
men who rule the Soviet Union and 
manage its vast nationalized emit-
ting (the world's greatest single in-
dustrial concern), spend their days 
and weeks poring over the archives 
of the NKVD, questioning the of-
ficials who once conducted purges 
and extracted confessions, and re-
living in their thoughts the long 
nightmare of the past. Yet the un-
derstanding of which the members 
of this Presidium are capable-es-
pecially the older ones-has its his-
torically formed limitations, which 
they cannot easily transcend. They 
cannot see where and why things 
had "gone wrong." They, would like 
to cross mit, if possible, the last

which Stalin oppressed and "be-
trayed" his own followers. 'They 
would still like to think that what 
was done in the earlier chapters was 
justified and beneficial and need not. 
have led to the final debacle and 
shame. They would like to remain 
Stalinists without and against Stalin, 
and to recapture the spirit of the 
"sane" and "hutment" Stalinism of 
the 1920's, of that Stalinism which 
had not yet soaked its hands in the 
blood of the Bolshevik Old Guard 
and in the blood of masses of peas-
ants and workers. They do not real-
ize that the latter-day "insane" 
Stalinist!' had sprung from the ear-
lier "sane" Stalinism, and that it was 
not only Stalin's whimsical and cruel 
character that was responsible for it. 
This approach governs all of 
Khruslichey's masoning as revealed 
in the February 24-25 speech. It 
dictates the range arid nature of his 
disclosures. Because Klirushchev 
pleaded the case of the old Stalinist 
faction "betrayed" by Stalin, his evi-
deuce against Stalin showed huge 
gaps and was all too often ambigu-
otts, in spite of the bluntness of the 
language he used and the shocking 
character of his facts. 
Significant .0mistsions 
Khrushchev built his: case against 
Stalin on three sets of facts: Lenin's 
denunciation, in his testament, of 
Stalin's "rudeness and disloyalty," 
Stalin's role in the purges, anti the 
14trIts of Stalin's leadership in the 
war. Under each count of the indict-
ment he treated the facts selectively 
so as to turn the evidence against 
Stalin himself rather than against. 
-the Stalinist faction, 
lie conjured up Lenin's ghost, be-
cause only with this ally at his side 
multi he, after thirty years of Stalin 
worship, hope to obliterate Stalin. 
Ile quoted from Lenin's testament 
the passages aimed directly against 
Stalin, but he passed over in silence 
all that Lenin had said in favor of 
Trotsky and Iliukharin. Ile assured 
his hearers that he now views "ob-
jectively and with detachment- the 
party feuds; but he still labeled 
Trotsky and Rukharin "enemies of 
Leninism," although they were no 
longer "enemies of the people." In 
the light of Lenin's hill testament, 
'Trotskyism and Bukharinism may 
be seen as offspring of the Leninist 
line :it least as legitimate as even 
the early Stalinism. 'Bic testament 
has therefore not been published in 
Russia even' now---it was distributed 
only to the delegates at the Twen-
tieth Congress. And even its his se-
cret speech Khrushchey was afraid of 
making too extensive use of it. 
Even more eloquent were the gaps 
in Khrushchey's story of the purges. 
Ile began with dark hints about the 
assassination of Kirov in PM, the 
event that set in motion the ava-
lanche of terror. He alluded to 
Stalin's connivance at the crime but 
added that nothing was certain; and 
lie left the mystery as deep as ever. 
Then he gave a inure or less detailed 
and horrifying account of the secret 
purges of Eikhe, Postyshey? Kosiot, 
(Inbar, Me/Wank, and Rini/utak,

fulness of one man, Khrushchey Because the history of the Soviet 
said repeatedly. But if so, "emu-
rades may ask us: Where were the 
members of the Political Bureau ... ? 
Why did they not assert them-
selves ... ? Why is this being done 
1940, and of the purge of Voznes-
ensky in 1951. But he had nothing 
explicit to say about the purge trials 
of 1936-1938, which shocked the. 
world, and in which the defendants 
were men of world fame, the recog-
nized leaders of Bolshevism, the 
Red Army, Soviet diplomacy, and 
the Communist International. 
He revealed nothing of the inner 
story of die purges of Zinoviev, 
Kamenev, Bukharin, Radek, Rakov-
sky, Pyatakov, and Tukhachevsky. 
He was silent on Trotsky's assassina-
tion, which was instigated by Stalin 
and Rena. Eikhe, Pentyshev, and 
Chubar were by comparison insig-
nificant figures. Their names meant 
little or nothing?not only to the 
outside world but even to the young 
Soviet .generation. But they were 
men of the Stalinist faction; and. 
through Khrushchev, the faction 
honored in them its martyrs. 
Not for nothing did Khrushchev 
tlwell so much tat the fortunes of 
the delegates to the Seventeenth 
Party Congress held in 1934. (At 
that assembly the Stalinist faction 
celebrated its final triumph over ali 
its adversaries, and in party annals 
the Congress is referred to as the 
-Victors' Congress?) Of nearly two 
thousand of the. "victors," about 
sixty per cent were later, according 
to Khrushchev,, "arrested on charges 
of counterrevolutionary crimes." In 
the years 1934-1938 alone, Stalin 
annihilated sixty or seventy per 
cent of the leaders of his own fac-
tion, and there were uncounted vic-
tims among the rank and file. 
In recent years public opinion 
outside Russia. has been aware of 
the fate of anti-Stalinist victims of 
the terror. It is only right that it 
should also be aware of the fate of 
Stalinist victims. But do not Khru-
shchev and his associates feel the in-
decency of their exclusive concentra-
tion on their own Stalinist martyrs? 
One Man to Blame 
Throughout Khrushchev's indict-
ment of Stalin ran the motif of self-
exculpation.

only now?" Unwittingly he demon' 
strated that much more was in play 
than the "willfulness of one man." 
Stalin had so much scope only be-
cause Khrushchev and his like 
accepted his will. 
Khrushchev recalled how at first 
they all trusted Stalin and zealously 
followed him in the struggle against 
other factions until they made him 
so powerful that they themselves be-
came powerless. Ile showed that 
even when they might have been 
able to act against him they did 
not wish to act. He related that in 
1941, when the Red Army reeled 
tinder Hitler's first ,onslaught, Sta-
lin's nerve snapped. It -might seem 
now that this was an opportunity for 
the party leaders to get rid of hint. 
Instead they sent a deputation to 
Stalin to beg him to seize the reins 
. again; and so they condemned them-
selves and their country to another 
twelve years of terror and degrada-
tion. None of them had the confi-
dence and courage of Trotsky, who 
as early as 1927 foresaw such a turn 
of events and said (in his famous 
"Clemen(:eau Thesis") that in such 
a crisis it would be the duty of party 
leaders to overthrow Stalin to wage 
war more efficiently. 
The Politburo of 1941, fearing 
that a change of leadership in the 
middle of a war would. destroy mo-
rale, rallied to its oppressor. It 
should be noted that this was not 
the first situation of this kind. In 
exactly the same way, the Politburo 
had hoisted a dejected and sulking 
Stalin back into the saddle time 
years earlier at; the height of col-
lectivization. In every major emer-, 
geney the Politburo felt the need of 
the "strong arm," and it turned to 
Stalin only to suffer under that 
strong arm for years. It so magnified

Union was one sequence of emer-
gencies, the Stalinist faction was al-
ways at an impasse. 
THE oursrmx inevitably irises 
whether during all those years no 
members of the ruling group made 
any attempt to destroy the incubus. 
It would have been unnatural if 
HO P1? ts at all had been '-hatched 
against Stalin. If Khrushchev and 
his colleagues really thought that 
"it all depended on the willfulness 
of one man" (which Trotsky, Zino-
viev, and Kamenev never thought), 
might not some of them have con-
'chided that the way out was to elim-
inate that -one man?" Khrushchev 
tells us that Postysltev, Rudnitak, 
and other leading Stalinists did in-
deed come into opposition to Stalin. 
But here too he leaves many things 
unsaid; and so the full story of the 
Stalinist opposition. to Stalin re-
mains to be disclosed. 
The historian finds a further con-
tradiction in Khrushchev's testi-
mony, one that* has in trunnion 
with Trotsky's appraisal of Stalin, 
although in Khrushchev the contra-
diction is, of course, far cruder. 
Khrushchev stressed the achieve-
ments as well as the failures of the 
Stalin era. For the achievments?in-
dustrial advance, educational prog-
ress, planned economy, victory in 
war?he praised . the masses, the 
people, the party, Leninist doctrine, 
and even the Central Committee?
the cowed and docile Central. Com-
mittee of the Stalin era. For the 
failures he blamed Stalin alone, 
If the qualities of one man were 
responsible for the Soviet military 
disasters of 1941, were they not also 
in some measure responsible for the 
victories of 1943-1945? If all major 
decisions on policy and strategy 
were taken by Stalin alone, then it 
is at least illogical to deny Stalin 
all credit for the results.

plans, and decisions conceived by 
emperors, generals, and "great men" 
were meaningless and worthless, and 
that only the innumerable, spon-
taneous, and unco-ordinated actions 
of nameless masses of people shaped 
history. But Tolstoy was consistent: 
He attributed to "great men" no 
special influence on history, for evil 
any more than for good. 
- The Sevaktkllibi 
No matter how vigorously Kiwis-
shchev pleaded the alibi for himself 
and the present ruling group, he 
proved a semi-alibi only. As a prose-
cutor he could hardly convince a 
jury that he has not been the de-
cendant's accomplice?at best he 
made himself an accomplice under 
.duress. He spoke of Beria as that 
"villain who climbed up the govern-
ment ladder over an untold number 
of corpses." How truer But was 
Baia alone? Khrushchev described 
with horror the character of a for-
mer official who took part in pre-
paring the purges of l937.-.1938 and 
in extracting confessions. The of-
ficial was brought before the Pre-
sidium and questioned. He was, said 
libruslichev, "a vile person, with 
the 'brain of a bird, and morally 
completely degenerate." What did 
this repulsive character claim in his 
defense? His plea, as reported by 
khrushchev? was that he acted on 
higher orders which he understood 
it be his duty as a party member 
to carry out. Khruslichev indignant-
ly rejected this apology as worthless. 
Yet almost in the same breath he 
used the same apology for himself 
and the other members of the Polit-
buro: Under Stalin, he said, "no 
one could express his will." 
TTascwisv of contemporary Rus-
sia is that die whole elite of the 
nation share in one degree or an-
other Stalin's guilt. Certainly,. no 
one in Moscow who would set hint. 
self up today as Stalin's accuser and 
pidge could prove his own alibi. 
Stalin made of the whole nation, at 
any rate of all its educated and ac-
tive elements, his accomplices. Those 
who opposed hint perished, with 
very, very few exceptions, long ago. 
Khroslichey exposed not only 
Malin but Stalinism, not only the 
man but his method of government, 
and this rendered the continuation 
or revival of the Method nearly hit-
passible. He set out to state only the 
case of the Stalinist faction against 
Stalin, anti he destroyed the case of 
the Stalinist faction. Willy-nilly, he 
exploded the idea of die monolithic 
party and of the monolithic state 
in which all must think alike. 
Having produced the shock, Miro-
shchev was anxious to soften its im-
pact. "We cannot let this matter get 
out of the party, especially not to 
the press," he warned his listeners. 
"It is for this reason that we are 
considering it here at a closed Con-
gress session. We should know the 
limits; we should not give ammuni-
tion to the enemy; we should not 
wash our dirty linen before their 
eyes," However, one may even suspect 
that the indiscretion that allowed 
the State Department to act as Khrit-
shchev's first publisher wits not un-
welcome to Moscow. It is from- the 
mass of the Soviet people that his 
speech has been kept secret so far.

The New Leader 
June 18, 1956 
_ 
Founder of Soviet Communism set precedents 
for almost all of Stalin's later crimes 
BACK TO LENIN 
By Mark Vishniak 
"There was nothing intrinsic in 
She Leninist method that protected 
it from prostitution. . . . Stalin 
became a tyrant because he was 
all-powerful and not ail-powerful 
because he was by nature a tyrant. 
He grew into tyranny precisely be-
cause the character of the Soviet 
Constitution enabled him to do 
so."?Aneurin Bevan, Tribune, 
March 23, 1956. 
DESPITE the efforts of present So-
viet leaders to draw a sharp line 
of demarcation between the wicked 
Stalin and the virtuous Lenin, Sta-
lin's "cult of personality" was actual-
ly reared on a base that Lenin had 
created: unconditional subservience 
to the Party's will as expressed 
through the Central Committee, 
which in turn was expressed through 
the Politburo, which was finally di-
rected by the Leader or Vozhd. 
After Lenin, Stalin became the 
V ozhd. Now Khrusichey & Co. have 
replaced one-man leadership with 
collective leadership, swearing elk-
glance to Lenin and Leninism. 
"Collective leadership" is nothing 
new. It is closely linked with "demo-
cratic centralism" and "intra-Party 
democracy," about which both Lenin 
and Stalin wrote quite often. "Demo-
cratic centralism" meant officially 
that "all executive organs of the 
Party, from the smallest to the high-
est, are elected." The word "elected". 
_ 
should, of course, be understood in 
the light of Soviet practice, which 
embodies ."firm centralization," "iron 
discipline" and "conscious mono-
lithic unity of will and action" (Great 
Soviet Encyclopedia, 2nd ed., vol. 
13, p. 656). Intra-Party democracy 
is defined as "the possibility of elect-
ing [various] bodies and the neces-
sity of accounting to all leading Party 
organs from below upward." intra. 
Party democracy is also "a collegial 
work spirit, the developing of criti-
cism and self-criticism." 
What is the difference between the 
new "collective leadership" and "a 
collegial work spirit"? Under both 
Lenin and Stalin, the Bolshevik party 
always contended that it was practic-
ing "intra-Party democracy." It was 
actually abolished by Stalin, but it 
had begun to wither under Lenin. 
As early as 1921,, at the Tenth 
Party Congreiss, a resolution of Len-
in's was adopted, forbidding the for-
mation of any intra-Party groups on 
167 
the ground that this could help only 
the bourgeoisie and the counter-
revolution. Lenin silenced those who 
tried to argue with him.?Trotsky. 
Medvedev, Shliapnikov, Kollontay, 
Bukharin, and others. He expelled 
from the Central Committee old com-
rades-in-arms like Preobrprhensky, 
1. N. SmirnoV and Serebryakov. His 
explanation for forbidding discussion 
was the 'existence of "an encircling 
world bourgeoisie, watching for a 
minute of wavering to bring back 
'their' people to restore the bourgeoi-
sie and landlords." (Lenin, Collected 
Works, vol. 26, p. 348) 
Ls This very different from the 
"capitalist encirclement". which Sta-
lin always cited as justification for 
his terror apparatus? Stalin physi-
cally destroyed the people whom 
Lenin had only told to "shut their 
mouths." That is the chief difference 
between the two. ? 
Stalin drew . on Lenin's works for 
all his shifting theories on the inevi-, 
tability or non-inevitability of war 
between the Communist and non-
Communist worlds, and on the 
achievement cif world Communism 
through bloody struggle or through 
parliamentary means. Even the so-
called Stalinist. concept of "social-
ism in one country" had its roots in 
Lenin's writings of 1916-1923. 
I recall only two instances when 
Stalin differed significantly from 
Lenin. 
Early in 1936, Stalin criticized 
Lenin's views on Clausewitz. Hiding 
behind Engels, he wrote: "Unlike 
Engels, Lenin did not consider him-
self competent in military matters. 
. . -Lenin approached Clausewitz's 
works not as a military man, but as 
a politician. . . . Therefore, as far as

the 'criticism of Clausewitz's military 
doctrine is concerned, we, Lenin's 
heirs, are not tied to. any of Lenin's 
statements, which only limit our free-
dom of criticism." This was followed 
by a quasi-scientific "Marxist" expla-
nation: "It is ridiculous to take les-
sons today from Clausewita, who was, 
after all, a representative of the man-
*during period of war, while we . 
today are in the Machine period." 
Despite all this, Stalin concluded with 
a prolific quotation from Lenin. 
The second instance was in the 
realm of Party practice. After Lenin 
was shot in August 1918 by Eanya 
Kaplan, he wasn't sure he could sur-
vive and told Rykov, his successor as 
Premier: "Let no blood be shed 
among any of you. . . . " Lenin was 
thinking of the French Revolution, 
which had devoured its own leaders. 
Stalin didn't follow Lenin's advice, 
nor have Stalin's heirs in dealing with 
Beria, Abakumov, Bagirov and 
others. 
Stalin did follow Lenin's precepts 
in his ultimate disposition of the 
peasant problem. At the Tenth Party 
Congress in March 1921, at which 
the New Economic Policy was pro-
claimed, Lenin spoke at length about 
the necessity of a union between the 
working class and the peasants, a 
"soldering" of the two: "We must 
admit openly that the peasants are 
not satisfied with the relationship we 
have worked out with them, they do 
not like it, they do not want it, and 
they won't continue it." Lenin 
harped on this theme many times in 
his last 18 months. In May 1921, he 
said once more: "We say openly and 
without deception to all peasants: In 
order to maintain socialism, we shall 
give you all kinds of concessions, 
comrade peasants, but only to a cer-
tain extent and within certain limits, 
and of the latter we'll be the only 
judges." (Italics supplied.) 
At the Eleventh Congress, at the 
end of March 1922, Lenin repeated: 
"Our aim is to prove and to show 
how to help the peasants. .. . Either 
we will do it or the peasants will send 
us to the devil." Such was Lenin's. 
conclusion after four-and-a-half years 
of leadership. 
Stalin remembered these words and 
fulfilled them in his own way. When, 
in 1928, he decided that the time had 
conic to stop concessions to the peas-
ants, he loosed the coercive appara-
tus at full speed and achieved forced 
collectivization in record time. Stalin 
relied both ou a Leninist precedent 
and on Lenin's words after NEP. 
The precedent was the formation in 
the middle of 1918 of what Lenin 
named "Poor Committees" for "a 
Crusade for Bread." 'Arise "Poor 
Committees" (kombedy) 
connnan-
ticered peasant "surpluses," "helped" 
in the harvest, fought the "kaiaks," 
and compelled peasants to join the 
Red Army. Lenin considered the com-
mittees "a great upheaval which in a 
very short time [half a year] helped 
us to socialism in the villages." Ten 
years later, Stalin also led the vil-
lages toward socialism via forced 
confiscation---not only of grain, but 
of land as well. lie used Lenin to back 
his point. Said Lenin: "The fight is 
and will be even more desperate and 
more cruel than the fight against 
Kolchak and Denikin. . One must 
understand the entire meaning of that 
fight and convey it to the masses of 
workers and peasants so that they 
understand: 'Who will beat whom? 
Who will win?' The dictatorship of 
the proletariat is a fierce, mad strug-
gle in which the proletariat must fight 
the whole world, because the whole 
world was against us, having hacked 
Denikin and Kolehak." 
Both Denikin and Kolchak died 
long ago, and those who backed them 
for a short while have also gone. 
Lenin and Stalin are dead, but the 
dictatorship of the Communist party 
is, unfortunately, still in existence, 
still fighting all who dare to disagree ? 
with it.
