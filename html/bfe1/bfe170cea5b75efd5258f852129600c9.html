 July 14, 1971
 MEMORANDUM FOR:
 FROM:
 SUBJECT:
 Introduction
 ON-FILE NSC RELEASE
 INSTRUCTIONS APPLY
 IDENT SAS SEEN.
 HENRY A.. KISSINGER
 My Talks with Chou En-lai.
 My two-day visit to Peking resulted in the most searching, sweeping
 and significant discussions I have ever had in government.  I spent
 seventeen hours in meetings and informal conversation with Chou En-lai,
 flanked by Marshal Yeh Chien-ying, member of the Politburo and of the
 Military Commission; Huang Hua, the new Chinese Ambassador in
 Ottawa; and Chang Wen-chin, head of the West European and American
 Department in the Foreign Ministry.  Another four hours was spent with
 Huang and Chang, mostly on drafting a communique.  These meetings
 brought about a summit meeting between you and Mao Tse-Tung, covered
 all major issues between our two countries at considerable length and
 with great candor, and may well have marked a' major new departure
 in international relations.
 It is extremely difficult to capture in a memorandum the essence of
 this experience.  Simply giving you a straightforward account of the high-
 lights of our talks, potentially momentous as they were, would do violence
 to an event so shaped by the atmosphere and the ebb and flow of our
 encounter, or to the Chinese behavior, so dependent on nuances and style.
 Thus, this memorandum will sketch the overall sequence of events and
 philosophic framework, as well as the substance of our exchanges.  For
 the intangibles are crucial and we must understand them if we are to
 take advantage of the opportunities we now have, deal effectively with
 these tough, idealistic, fanatical, single-minded and remarkable people,
 and thus transform the very framework of globil relationships.
 What Happened
 The Chinese treated the entire visit with elaborate correctness and courtesy.
 They were extremely tough on substance and ideological in their approach,

 but their dealings were meticulous; they concentrated on essentials; they
 eschewed invective and haggling over details.  The atmosphere on the
 human plane was relaxed and cordial, matter-of-factly; (one did not have
 the sense that they were carrying out instructions to be cordial as is often
 the case with Dobrynin.)
 Thus Chinese hospitality started in Pakistan as we boarded the Pakistani
 plane in pre-dawn obscurity to be greeted by four senior Chinese officials,
 headed by Chang, flown up from Peking two days earlier along with three
 Chinese navigators (they had insisted on boarding the plane half an hour
 before us).  And it continued right through to our return flight to Islamabad
 two days later with all the Chinese officials (except Chou) at the airport
 and the plane loaded with one last round of Chinese dishes, the latest
 English version of Mao's works, and photo albums of our visit prepared
 throughout the night.
 We were met at noon at the Peking airport by the very senior Marshal Yeh
 who, like Chang aboard the plane, sought to confirm that you were in
 principle prepared to visit-their country and that I was there for constructive
 talks between equals.  Both were worried about why I had come secretly
 (Yahya had told me the same thing).  Was I ashamed to acknowledge meeting
 them?  Here, and in Chou's specific references on several occasions, the
 Chinese showed extreme sensitivity to slights such as Dulles' refusal to
 shake Chou's hand in Geneva in 1954.
 We were whisked in Chinese-built limousines, curtains drawn, through
 wide, clean streets, with little traffic except bicyles.  We passed through
 the huge Tiennmen Square, capable of holding 500, 000 people, to a stately,
 serene, totally secluded government guest house in the Western section
 of the capital.  After drinking tea with our Chinese hosts, we rested,
 consumed the first of a series of Chinese meals of staggering variety
 and quantity, and prepared for Chou's arrival.
 He came at 4:30 p. m.  At our first encounter like the entire visit, he
 was matter of fact, urbane, and totally at ease without any of the self-
 conscious sense of hierarchy of Soviet officials.  After a few minutes of
 ice-breaking small talk and an official photograph, we moved to a conference
 table and launched into three hours and twenty minutes of discussions.
 I gave the substance of the opening statement you had approved, considerably
 truncated to get to the point quickly, laying out a possible agenda which we
 in fact took up point-by-point in our meetings -- the summit, Taiwan,

 Indochina, relations with major countries such as Japan and the Soviet
 Union, South Asia, future American-Chinese communications, arms control,
 and any other topics of interest to the Chinese.  He immediately moved to
 their fundamental concern, Taiwan, and I rejoined with our position on
 Indochina.
 We broke at 8:00 p. m. for dinner, continuing a low-keyed substantive
 discussion.  Indochina came up again as we finished off the last few of the
 fifteen or so dishes.
 Our resumed session from 9:50 to 11:20 p.m. was dominated by the subject
 of great power relations in general.  Chou spoke of the Chinese fear of a
 remilitarized Japan, and  violently and contemptuously attacked Soviet
 imperialism which he claimed had learned its lessons from the U. S.  I
 explained the philosophical framework of U. S. foreign policy in the post-
 war period culminating in the Nixon Doctrine.  Chou listened raptly, asking
 very probing but non-contentious questions, some based on the President's
 remarks in Kansas City of July 6.  (It was characteristic of Chou that when
 I indicated that I had seen only press reports, I found Chou's own annotated
 copy of the text waiting for me at breakfast with a request to return it since
 it was the only copy he had.)
 On Saturday morning, July 10, we were taken to the Forbidden City, where
 the entire, enormous Imperial Palace grounds had been closed off from the
 public for a half day so that we could take a secret tour.  For two and a half
 hours we absorbed the magnificently simple and proportionate sweeps of
 the red and gold buildings, the courtyards each with its own character, and
 the living quarters of past emperors.  The Director of all of China's archeo-
 logical museums guided us past ancient relics of China that had been unearthed
 in recent years.
 We then proceeded to the Great Hall of the People where we were greeted by
 Chou for another four and a half hours of discussions sandwiched around a
 one and a half hour roast duck lunch.
 Before lunch Chou made a one and a half hour presentation, as always
 without notes, responding to each of the seven points on my original agenda.
 This was an extremely tough presentation, though put forward without
 rhetorical flourish -- the preoccupation with Taiwan; the support for the
 North Vietnamese; the spectre of big power collusion, specifically of being
 carved up by the US, USSR, and Japan; the contempt of the Indians, hatred
 for the Russians and apprehension over the Japanese; the disclaimer that
 China is, or would want to be, a superpower like the Russians and we who
 have 'stretched out our hands too far"; and throughout, the constant view

 that the world must move toward peace, that there is too "much turmoil
 under the heavens."  There were light touches as well, such as Chou's
 revelation that James Reston was taking a slow train from the border which
 would conveniently get him to Peking right after our departure. Still, Chou
 ended with a challenge -- whether there was any sense in a high-level
 meeting given our vast differences.
 I responded very toughly, pointing out that they had raised the issue .6f a
 Presidential visit and that we could not accept any conditions.  I would not
 raise the issue again; they had to decide whether to issue an invitation.  I
 then launched into a deliberately brusque point-by-point rebuttal of Chou's
 presentation.  Chou stopped me after the first point, saying the duck would
 get cold if we did not eat first.
 At lunch the mood changed and Chou's geniality returned. I gs.thered the
 impression that his speech had been largely for the record.
 At the end of lunch Chou launched into a moving account of the Cultural
 Revolution which he continued to relate even after I noted that this was China's
 internal affair.  One could tell that the Revolution was an anguishing period
 for him.  He described China as torn between its fear of bureaucracy and the
 excesses of revolution with each side claiming to speak for Mao until the
 acknowledged excesses threatened to destroy the fruits of some fifty years
 of struggle.
 After lunch I continued my comments on his remarks, having covered Taiwan
 and Japan before the break.  On Indochina, as on Taiwan, I noted the need
 for time for a political evolution and I re-emphasized the link between the
 two questions.  After moving through the other issues such as great power
 relations, South Asia, communications between our governments and arms
 control, we had laid a sound substantive framework.  Chou, suddenly,
 matter-of-factly returned to your visit to China.  He suggested the summer
 of 1972, indicating that they would prefer it if you met the Soviet leaders
 first.  He said that they were not afraid of anyone but they were not looking
 for unnecessary trouble either.  I said that a US-Soviet summit had been
 agreed in principle but I could make no promise and would accept no
 condition.  I also said that a summer summit might look like a political
 campaign gesture.  Chou then moved your visit up to the spring.
 We adjourned at six so Chou could go to another meeting (he normally works
 from noon to early morning) and agreed to meet four hours later to draft
 the joint announcement.  We returned to the guest house for dinner and

 an evening of fits and starts, of nighttime strolls and cancelled meetings
 and a complicated, occasionally, painful minuet of communique drafting.
 This process is described in the section dealing with the summit.
 The next morning we held a final two hour meeting which wrapped up the
 summit, the communique, and final substantive comments.  In the first
 forty minutes we reached agreement with Huang and Chang on the Com-
 munique at Tab A.  This capped a drafting process that had its quota-of
 tension but was marked by the other side's clear willingness to meet us
 half way.  Our negotiating over the language was free of the pettiness and
 elbowing that we have experienced with the Russians.  And once the basic
 bargain was struck, the rest of our business flowed comparatively easily.
 Chou, who had been waiting nearby -- so as to avoid a confrontation over
 language -.. suddenly appeared after the announcement was agreed, and we
 proceeded to settle all the major principles of your visit along the lines
 you wished.
 After bidding farewell to Chou, we and the other Chinese officials had a
 final lunch.  All tension was gone and Marshal Yeh's normally impassive
 face was finally creased by smiles.  On the way to the airport he recounted
 some of his experiences M?? how over forty years ago as a division commander
 of Chiang, he heard of Mao and his 2000 followers in the mountains and
 joined them.  And as we drove up toward the waiting Pakistani plane he
 remarked that none of them on the Long March had ever dreamed to see
 Victory in their lifetimes.  They had thought their struggle was for future
 generations.
 Yet, he said, "here we are and here you are. "

 The Chinese
 Two qualities in the Chinese came across with particular force during
 this initial encounter: their inward philosophical tension and their inward
 strength.
 For us this episode is, of course, a major new turn in international relations.
 For the Chinese Communists it is no less than a personal, intellectual, and
 emotional drama.  They have endured fifty years of the Long March, struggle
 against the Japanese and Kuomintang, the Great Leap Forward, and the
 Cultural Revolution.
 Yet here they were, dealing with arch capitalists, while what they call a
 "war of liberation" was going on at their borders, acting out a drama of
 philosophic contradictions.  The moral ambivalance of this encounter for
 them was reflected in a certain brooding quality, in the occasional schizo-
 phrenia of Chou's presentations, inthe jagged rythym in drafting the
 announcement, and the tales of the Cultural Revolution and the Long March
 and Mao Tse-Tung's inspirational leadership.  This ambivalence showed
 up also in their request during our Saturday Imperial Palace tour for an
 oral summary statement to be made on tape by both sides the final day.
 I suggested this idea be shelved until we had finished our discussions and
 they confirmed it would be for internal use only.  When Chou arrived at
 the guest house late that evening he said that they no longer considered
 the tape necessary.  I suspect they wanted the tape for Mao Tse-Tung.
 Thus these were men in some anguish.  Yet their long history of past
 suffering gave them an inner confidence that was reflected in a certain
 largeness of spirit. There was none of the Russian ploymanship, scoring
 points, rigidity or bullying.  They did not turn everything into a contest.
 Profoundly committed and firm on principle, they dealt in historical terms;
 and once we reached basic understandings, such as on the announcement,
 details fell into place without maneuvering for petty gains.
 They can be expected to be meticulous in their diplomacy.  Indeed they
 stressed over and over again that they considered meticulous observance
 of even .the spirit of our agreements the key to good future relationships.
 When I mentioned the fact that the Russians had put out their own, and
 different, English translation of the May 20 SALT announcement, Chou
 showed obvious contempt and assured me that the Chinese would never
 resort to such a gambit.  Our hosts stressed that the television film and
 photos of our visit would be held until we agreed to their use.
 The Chinese are clearly men of deep conviction and a wide chasm of ideology
 and isolation separates us.  But they were nevertheless willing to paint
 prospects not only of normalizing relations but moving onward to friendship
 and cooperation.

 Chou En-lai epitomized these qualities.  He spoke with an almost matter
 of fact clarity and eloquence.  He was equally at home in philosophic
 sweeps, historical analysis, tactical probing, light repartee.  His
 command of facts, and in particular his knowledge of American events, was,
 remarkable.  He insisted on admitting faults in their society, and protesting
 that their lavish hospitality was only "what they should do. "
 There was little wasted motion, either in his words or his movements.
 Both reflected the brooding inner tension of a man concerned both with the
 revolutionary fire of the next generation and the massive daily problem
 of caring for 750 million people, one who endured the tribulations of the
 Long March and was now inviting the President of the United States to visit
 his capital.
 Chou was also genial and urbane, with a refreshing sense of humor.  He
 displayed an easy egalitarianism -- with his interpreters who had a free'
 though respectful relationship with him, or with all of our party who he
 consistently ushered into and out of elevators in front of him.  And he.
 was considerate ...p in his genuine concern when one of my colleagues wasn't
 feeling well, in briefing me just before my departure of events in the world
 from which I had been insulated, and in making sure that we would continue
 to use the Yahya channel occasionally because "one should not burn bridges
 that have been useful. It
 In short, Chou En-tai ranks with Charles De Gaulle as the most impressive
 foreign statesman I have met.
 Of course, these people were on their best behavior.  These were the
 cream of their current elite; and it is inconceivable that the next generation
 there will produce leaders tempered by such experiences.  Almost all of
 the positive qualities we saw are Chinese, not communist, and can be
 found in Taiwan or Singapore or San Francisco.  Much of their ideology
 is distasteful, and living in China today would be a numbing, depressing
 experience.  They are certainly fanatically tough.  They do not wish us
 well.  Their new society has been purchased at a terrible cost -- in
 freedom, spontaneity, color, and family life.  But the present generation
 of leaders understand big conceptions.  Our dealings will be difficult,
 especially as we inaugurate a brand new relationship.  The rewards and
 risks will be great.  But if we keep our nerve and are clear about our purposes
 we can start a new historical course.

 Summit

 ?          .M
 The summit emerged as the cause of a major Chinese ambivalence.
 Even before the meetings started the Chinese were anxious to get confirm-
 ation that you were in principle willing to go to China.  On the other hand
 they pretended that they had responded to your request.  On substance
 Chou took an initially hard position that the summit should be in the
 context of improving Sino-US relations and that the best way to accomplish
 this was by the establishment of diplomatic relations. He eventually
 backed away -. only after considerable give-and-take -- by reluctantly
 acknowledging that recognition was not an "absolute" precondition for a
 summit, though this direction should be set by it.
 This was in the earlier stages of our talks.  Later on, Chou again
 toughened his position by stating that the initiative for a summit had come
 from you and not from the Chinese.  I referred to the actual messages,
 which I had brought with me, but suggested that if it was so difficult
 perhaps we should drop the idea of a summit for the time being and go
 on to substantive matters.
 By the second day, the Chinese stand again had softened.  On the way to
 our tour of the Forbidden City, Ambassador Huang referred to Chou's
 interest in a statement on a summit.  Chou himself raised the subject in
 our discussions that afternoon and after making, no headway with a ploy
 that a summit should be in a climate' of Sino-US friendship to be established
 by recognition, proposed at about 5:30 in the evening that a drafting
 committee for a joint summit communique meet that night at about 8:30 p. m.
 He told me that he had another a)pointment, but would personally appear
 about 10:30 p.m.
 Having gone this far, Chou was willing to look more deeply into the summit
 issue.  He listened to my thoughts on general principles, and insisted that
 another high-level meeting between our representatives would be necessary
 before the summit took place to fix the agenda and details.  The U. S.
 representative, he said, should be either me or someone else of similar
 stature close to you.  I mentioned Ambassador Bruce and in his final

 the visit should be an open one.
 Chou in addition expressed a desire to have your summit with Mao Tse-Tung
 take place after any similar meetings with the Soviets.  Even though he

 was willing to be flexible when I explained our problems, this was a
 significant sign (and perhaps the most significant) of the Chinese worries
 about their confrontation with the USSR.
 Producing a mutually satisfactory communique proved to be a tense process.
 Their drafters failed to appear at the stipulated time, and at about 10:45 p.m.
 we were told that they would not arrive before 9:00 the next morning.  I
 had in the meantime been walking in the grounds of the guest house to discuss
 with my associates the possible reasons for the delay, and I also had made
 it plain to their protocol people that I had to leave Peking no later than
 1:00 p. m. the next day whatever the state of our discussions.  I also said
 that as the President's representative they had to give me a precise meeting
 time and could not keep me on standby.  They must have sensed my irritation,
 for just as we were going to bed we were informed that Chou was coming.
 He arrived at about 11:15, referred to my departure time, apologized for
 getting us up, and said that his drafters would appear shortly.  He departed
 after an hour's friendly conversation dealing with Taiwan, India, the Berlin
 issue, and the Soviet Union.
 I then spent several hours with the Chinese officials going over a draft by
 their side which would have had the initiative for the visit coming from you,
 and which would have keyed the summit just to seeking ":normalization of
 relations."  (Tab B).  I insisted that the origin of the visit had to be put
 in terms of mutual interest.  They agreed after a while, although there
 were differences over the exact language.  Where they had trouble was over
 my insistence that the summit meeting should have a broader scope than
 just the normalization of relations.  At about 1:40 a. m. , they proposed a
 30-minute recess in which they would try to work out language on both
 points suitable to us, and left the room.  We took another brief walk in
 the grounds and returned to await their arrival; at 3:00 a. m. we learned
 that they had left the building entirely (they must have gone to Chou En-tai's
 office) and would not return until 9:00 a. m.
 Ultimately, at 9:40 a. m. , on July 11, Chou and the other officials
 reappeared.  At this point there was some confusion; Chou, it seemed,
 would be strolling outside while the others came in to discuss their draft
 communique with me.  Our first word, however, was that all were to come
 in together, and the Chinese seemed rather embarrassed at the sudden
 shift in plan. In their new version of the communique they had gone very
 far to meet my requirements, and their wording needed only a few minor
 changes to be fully acceptable.  The agreed joint communique (Tab A)
 suggests a mutual desire for the summit with you accepting their invitation,
 and its purpose has been broadened to "questions of concern to both sides."

 With agreement reached on the communique, Chou quickly appeared.
 Presumably for "face" reasons, he had not been prepared to present him-
 self unless or until there was such an agreement.  Once in the meeting,
 he accepted easily all the details for the summit which I then put forward.
 He made the.point that Chairman Mao had personally endorsed the summit
 meeting, and accepted my proposed date and time for the public release
 of the joint communique, even though "this may cause us a little trouble. "
 I can only account for the fits and starts in the drafting of the joint
 communique by attributing them to a deep conflict between ideological and
 practical considerations on the Chinese side.  Ideologically, the concept
 of Chairman Mao sitting down with the leader of what they call the
 "imperialist camp" must be extremely difficult for some Chinese to
 accept, despite the prospect of its moving forward their campaign against
 Taiwan.
 TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE/EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY           ..10-
 On the other hand, I believe they are deeply worried about the Soviet threat
 to their national integrity, realistically speaking, and see in us a balancing
 force against the USSR.  And, unlikely as it may superficially seem, I
 sense that they actually do appreciate the balancing role we play in Asia.
 Nevertheless, it is hard for life-long revolutionaries to act against their
 own principles, and we must be exceptionally careful not to drive them
 away.
 The Chinese will undoubtedly stress the Taiwan issue as the key to
 normalization of relations, but we can maintain that all issues of mutual ,
 concern will be discussed for the sake of Asian and world peace.  On all
 other issues Chou in effect left all the other basic principles up to you,
 giving us precisely what you wished:
 A visit of up to five days.
 , --      Probably one other city besides Peking.  (He mentioned Mao
 might be outside the capital for more quiet talks with you. )
 -- Small official delegation, to include Secretary Rogers, myself
 and a couple of aides.
 Agenda will probably look somewhat like the one Chou and I had,
 ?
 with this subject to be pursued by Bruce and/or me.
 -- Small press delegation; he said this could mean around ten.
 They will establish the groundrules after we tell them what they should be.

 Minimum secret service; I really don't think security will be

 -- The PRC will not invite other U. S. political leaders before your
 visit.     I emphasized that it was important that our new departure in relations
 start at your level and not be muddied by eager politicians in advance.  This
 would not rule out newsmen and cultural exchanges in the interim.

 Taiwan
 This was described by Chou as the basic issue between the U. S. and the
 PRG, going back to the Korean war, when we "surrounded" Taiwan and
 declared -- in contrast to our previous position -- that its status was
 "undetermined. "  Chou maintained that this was still our position, citing
 as a case in point a recent statement by the State Department press spokes-
 man to the effect that Taiwan status was legally undetermined.  (You ,will
 recall that you took considerable exception to this statement.) I emphasized
 that they might have noted that the remarks by the press spokesman had not
 been repeated.   There was considerable laughter on the Chinese side over
 this, and frequent later references.  Chou asked whether we could apply
 the same method to Laird's comments about nuclear weapons for Japan.
 I am sure that they were already aware that you had clamped down but
 wanted confirmation.
 ?
 Chou then went on to say that to establish diplomatic relations with the
 PRC, the U. S. must:
 -- Recognize that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China, and a
 province of China.
 -  Recognize the PRC as the sole legitimate government of China.
 -- Withdraw all its armed forces and military installations from the
 area of Taiwan and the Taiwan Strait within a limited period.
 -- Consider that the US-ROC Mutual Defense Treaty is invalid.
 ?
 I responded that the Chinese were going beyond what they had said to us
 in their messages and in the two 1970 Warsaw talks, in which they had
 requested the removal of our military presence only.  I said that we had
 to distinguish between what could be done immediately and what had to be
 left to historical evolution.  With respect to military presence there
 were two components to our forces on Taiwan -- those related to the
 defense of Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam, and those related to the
 defense of Taiwan.  The former could be withdrawn after the end of the
 war in Vietnam; the latter would depend on the general state of our
 relations with the PRC.
 Chou asked whether I was linking the Taiwan issue to Indochina.  When
 I affirmed it he did not demur but turned to a discussion of Indochina,
 pointing out only that it was easier for the Chinese who were not at war to
 take a long view than for the Vietnamese.

 On the political future of Taiwan, I said we did not advocate a "two Chinas"
 or a "one China - one Taiwan" solution but would accept any political
 evolution agreed to by the parties.  We hoped that this evolution would be
 peaceful, and Chou said the PRC would try to keep it so.
 I said that we could not accept recognition as a condition to your visit to
 Peking.  Chou, after much give and take, said that recognition was not
 a precondition but that the visit should set recognition as the ultimate
 direction of our policy.  He accepted my position that some time would be
 required, i.e., well into your second term.
 Chou said that if China was to be patient it needed three assurances: first,
 that the US would not support "two Chinas" or a "one China, one Taiwan"
 policy; second, that we would not support the indigenous Taiwan independence
 movement; and third, that we would not permit Japanese troops to move in.
 I stressed that this would be our policy but noted that some events on Taiwan
 might be beyond our ability to control.  Chou interposed no objection.
 Regarding the UN, I said we might support a position where the admission
 of the PRC would be by a majority vote, but the expulsion of other countries,
 i. e., Taiwan, would be by a 2/3 vote with the Chinese Security Council seat
 going to the PRC.  As soon as the PRC gained the necessary 2/3, it would
 be China's sole representative in the UN.
 Chou stated that the PRC did not regard getting into the UN as a particularly
 urgent matter.  It had lived without the UN for 21 years, and could continue
 to do so.  However, if others asked, the PRC would of course maintain its stand
 that its legitimate rights in the UN must be restored.  China would have to
 oppose the US position which I had described.  When I suggested that he
 mute the rhetoric, he agreed smilingly.  Chou added that our proposed stand
 would cause more difficulty to us than to the PRC.  He did not take undue
 exception to it as long as we would not put it forward ourselves, but
 would simply support it if proposed by others. (Significantly, discussion
 of the UN issue came well before agreement on the summit and the joint
 communique, showing that the one was not an obstacle to the other.)
 As a final point on Taiwan, Chou noted that the agreement on your meeting
 with Chairman Mao would "shake the world. " Afterwards, Chiang Kai-shek
 might collude with the USSR or Japan, and would demonstrate against you.
 Chiang would try to operate independently of the U. S.  Chou knew this from
 his previous associations with Chiang, and the US "should beware. "

 Indochina
 Chou En-lai was as forthcoming as we could have hoped.  His attitude
 throughout reflected the ambivalance of Peking's position.  For ideological
 reasons, he clearly had to support Hanoi.  On the other hand, it was
 apparent that he did not wish to jeopardize the chances for an improvement
 in our relations, especially after I explained the positions we had taken in
 Paris and warned of the danger of escalation if negotiations failed.  He
 came back to this latter point again and again, without threat or bluster,
 simply using it as an argument for the desirability of peace.
 Thus Chou went back and forth between a formal theoretical defense of
 Hanoi's position (though in much lower key than Le Duc Tho at Paris) and
 concrete questions that sought to discover areas of agreement.  He stressed
 Peking's support of Hanoi while insisting that there had not been advisers
 in Indochina nor would there be.  He critized American aggression but
 stressed Chinese interest in an "honorable exit" for the US.
 From the outset, I linked the Indochina conflict and our relations with Peking:
 -_ I pointed out that two-thirds of our forces in Taiwan were linked
 to the war and their removal would depend on an end of the conflict.
 -- I also pointed out that an end to the war would accelerate the
 improvement in our relationship.
 In addition, I reviewed the current situation in Paris and pointed out that
 the talks were blocked because of Hanoi's insistence on the overthrow of
 Thieu and- its refusal to agree to a ceasefire.  I warned that a breakdown
 in the negotiations would mean continuation of the war, with incalculable
 consequences.
 Chou addressed Indochina several times during the first two days of our
 talks.
 On the first day he asked a number of questions about our position, generally
 in an intelligent and sympathetic manner.  These were:
 --- Were we really ready to pull out?
 Would we close all our bases?
 -- Why would we wish to leave a "tail," such as some advisers and/
 or the Thieu Government?

 ..w Would we be prepared to accept having the Indochinese people
 determine their own future?
 ?
 Why did we wish a cease-fire?
 Would we wish to continue giving aid to the present government?
 It was clear that he understood the linkage between Taiwan and Vietnam and
 did not object to it.  He also was extremely concerned about the possibility
 of escalation.  In addition, he made the following points:
 -- He revealed that he had not been informed about the secret meetings
 we have had with the North Vietnamese in Paris recently.
 -- He said that China only had two objectives with regard to a Vietnam
 settlement:
 There must be a withdrawal of US and Allied forces.
 The peoples of the three Indochinese countries must be
 left to decide their own future.
 He insisted that China would keep hands off after a settlement.
 On the second day Chou took a harder line.  As part of a generally tough
 presentation, he attacked the Thieu and Lon Nol Governments and he charged
 us with having committed "aggression" in Indochina since World War U.
 He warned that we should pull out completely and not leave a "tail" behind
 in the fort of advisers since these would be the entering wedge for a new
 involvement.
 He warned about the dangers of escalation but also made clear that China
 would not intervene.  He explained several times that Chinese assistance
 to Hanoi had never included combat forces -w there had only been some
 bridgebuilding and road repair crews during the bombing.
 He stressed that there were no Chinese advisors in Indochina nor would
 there be.
 The morning of our departure, without prompting, Chou returned to Indo-
 china in an astonishingly sympathetic and open manner.  He made the
 following points:
 .._  He hoped our negotiations in Paris would be successful and he
 wished me luck.

 He would talk to Hanoi after the announcement of the President's
 visit to Peking had been made.
 Peking supports Mme. Binh's seven point proposal but they
 were negotiable.
 -- He hopes our withdrawal will be complete, thorough and honorable.
 He thought that we would find Hanoi more generous than we.
 This means he will talk to the North Vietnamese and may be able to exert
 some influence.  The mere fact of his talking to them is likely to compound
 the shock of your announced visit to Peking.  In any case, he knows that
 the very fact that we and Peking are moving closer will have an impact in
 Hanoi.

 Japan
 Chou repeatedly expressed concern about the revival of Japanese militarism,
 and I have no doubt that the PRC relationship with Japan is in fact a serious
 matter for the Chinese.  Chou maintained that the rapid development of
 Japanese economic power would inevitably carry rearmament in its wake.
 In this, he said that Japan's economic expansion would lead to political
 expansionism.  He pointed to the great budgetary increase of Japan's
 Fourth Defense Plan over its predecessors as a case in point.  He quoted
 Sato as mentioning that Japan's rapid economic growth would permit this
 plan to be completed in two to three years rather than the five originally
 contemplated.
 He noted also that Sato had now spoken of the defense of Taiwan, Okinawa,
 and Korea being essential to the defense of Japan, and took Sato's mention
 of this in our 1969 Joint Communique with him as an indication that the
 US was supporting Japan's rearmament.  Japanese troops might even go
 to Taiwan. At one point he mentioned the possibility of Japan colluding
 with the US and the USSR to carve up China, and cited Secretary Laird's
 speech in Japan as a sign of U. S. interest in Japan's developing nuclear
 weapons.  He doubted that the return of Okinawa would be without nuclear
 weapons.  Chou plainly was holding us responsible for trends in Japanese
 policy which appeared to threaten China.
 I declared flatly that we were not encouraging, and indeed opposed, any
 revival of Japanese expansionism.  I agreed on the military implications
 of Japan's economic growth and said that the US and PRC interests coincided
 in trying to keep this growth under control.  All the US supported was
 Japan's ability to defend itself.  Paradoxically, the presence of US troops
 on Japan helped to restrain the Japanese rather than the reverse.  We
 would never collude with other countries in carving China up.
 I strongly denied that what Secretary Laird had allegedly said was Administra-
 tion policy, and pointed out that once Okinawa reverted to Japan our bases
 would be under the same restrictions as now exist for those in Japan.
 Chou accepted this, and later personally called attention to the State
 Department spokesman's comments on Secretary Laird's speech.
 Although Chou had started off with a very rigid position on Japan, I believe
 that he understands the restraining role which we play with respect to the
 Japanese.  This came through toward the end of our meetings, when he asked
 that we see to it that, as US troops are withdrawn from Taiwan, Japanese
 troops are not moved in to replace them.  I said that this would be done.

 Korea was cited by Chou as another area of "turmoil under heaven. "
 This arose first from the fact that there was no peace treaty there despite
 China's efforts in 1954 to extend the Geneva Agreements to Korea.  Chou
 had proposed this to get something better than a ceasefire in Korea,,: and
 Anthony Eden, in the chair, had gone along until Walter Bedell Smith had
 "waved his arms" and caused Eden to reject the move on procedural grounds.
 Presumably, Chou was suggesting that China wanted an arrangement in Korea
 which had legal status.
 Chou went on to say that there was constant conflict along the DMZ; U. S.
 forces were still present; and ROK troops were in Vietnam.  There was
 now a joint U. S. -South Korean army in which Thailand was also represented.
 Park Chong-Hee was as aggressive as Syngman Rhee.  Therefore, the
 DPRK   and China -. had a right to be concerned.
 I said that what happened in Korea depended very much on the general
 relationships in the area.  If the war in Indochina ended and U. S. -PRC
 relations developed, the ROK troops in Vietnam would return, and it was
 conceivable that before the end of your next term most of the U. S. troops
 in Korea would be withdrawn.  Chou himself suggested that in those terms
 the process had already begun with our removal of 20, 000 men, and I
 agreed.  On Chou's other points, I said I knew of no Thai troops in the ROK.
 The joint U. S. -ROK military command was not a new policy; it was
 intended to make our withdrawal easier and was not a new commitment.
 Chou's remarks on alleged ROK aggressiveness gave me an opportunity
 to highlight North Korean actions.  I said that the FRG was opp osed to
 ROK military aggression against the North Koreans, but North Korea for
 its part was very harsh in its military meassures against both the US
 and the ROK.  We believed it would be very helpful to Asian peace if the
 PRC could restrain North Korea in the use of force against the U. S. and
 the ROK.  Chou did not reply,  but I think that his silence may be taken
 as a form of assent -- he could hardly admit that an ally of the PRC was
 behaving aggressively.

 South Asia
 _19-
 Chou described the South Asian subcontinent as a prime area of "turmoil
 under heaven. " This was because India had long ago under Nehru adopted
 an expansionist philosophy, not only committing aggression against Pakistan
 but against China as well.
 Chou went into great detail to outline the development of the hostile relation-
 ship between China and India.  This began, he said, when the Indians became
 aware in 1959 that the Chinese had built a road across Indian-claimed terri-
 tory between Sinkiang and the All region of Tibet    but how could this have
 been Indian territory when the Indians weren't even aware when the road was
 built?
 The Indians had then attacked a Chinese military post in this region, but had
 lost heavily because the Chinese position was uphill from where the Indians
 were and was strongly fortified.  But world opinion (including Khrushchev)
 felt that the Chinese must-have st4- rted hostilities because of the heavy
 Indian losses.  The Indians had also used force against the Chinese in other
 areas.  The culmination was the Sino-Indian war of 1962.
 Chou made the following points:
 -- India was responsible for the pre sent turmoil in East Pakistan.  It
 was supporting Bangla Desh and had allowed a Bangla Desh "headquarters"
 to be set up on Indian territory.
 In the light of Indian expansionist ambitions, India would use any
 military aid -- such as that given by the USSR -- for aggressive purposes.
 Chou acknowledged that we were not giving military assistance to India, but said
 that one had to keep the consequences of any aid in mind.
 -- China would stand by Pakistan in the present crisis.  This position
 began to develop with a rather low-key remark at dinner the first night that
 China "could not but take some interest in the situation, " and ended with a
 request to me at the end to convey assurances of Chinese support to
 President Yahya Khan.
 I told Chou that we were trying very hard to discourage an Indo-Pak war.
 I assured Chou that we were bringing all the influence we could to bear on
 India to try to prevent a war from developing.  Chou said that this was a good
 thing, but he inferred that we might not be able to do too much because we

 were 10, 000 miles away.  China, hpwever, was much closer.  Chou
 recalled the Chinese defeat of India in 1962 and hinted rather broadly that
 the same thing could happen again.
 The Chinese detestation of the Indians came through loud and clear.
 Conversely, China's warm friendship for Pakistan as a firm and reliable
 friend wa.; made very plain. The lesson that Chou may have been trying
 to make here was that those who stand by China and keep their word will
 be treated in kind.

 Communications
 I explained that it was essential for our two governments to be able to com-
 municate rapidly, reliably and secretly   without the intervention of third
 parties,however friendly.  This had two aspects -- how to get in touch with
 each other and whom to deal with in the government.  I suggested three
 levels of contact:
 -~ A hot line between Washington and Peking for urgentmessages.
 A secure direct channel between the Chinese leaders and yourself
 which would not be vulnerable to the bureaucracies or developments
 in a third country.  This would be used for important and sensitive
 matters, to agree on basic principles and to clarify misunderstandings.
 It would be kept free of the bureaucracy to prevent both leaks and
 formalism.  I mentioned Paris, London or Ottawa as possible con-
 tact points.
 -- A diplomatic contact such as Warsaw for more technical issues and
 implementation of agreements reached through the secure channel.
 Chou's first reaction was rather cool, with a suggestion that it might be
 premature.   On the second day Chou returned to the subject to say that he
 would let me know the next morning at our final session.
 On Sunday morning he never mentioned the hot line proposal and stated that
 revival of the Warsaw Talks would be a waste of time.  They took more of
 everybody's effort in preparing instructions then they were worth.  He
 agreed that we did need a secure White House /Peking channel and chose the
 Chinese embassy in Paris, saying that their Ambassador there was a
 member of the Central Committee and that Ottawa would be too much in
 the limelight.  I said that General Walters would be our contact in Paris
 and would be in touch on July 19.  We shall communicate either by sealed
 envelopes or through messages to be transmitted by their Ambassador.
 Chou added that we should continue to pass some non-substantive notes
 through President Yahya who had been a good friend.

 Great Power Relations
 Chou professed apprehension over the possibility that the US, USSR, Japan
 and even India might collaborate to carve up China.  He showed deep bitter-
 ness against the Soviets and contempt for their petty tactics.  The Soviets,
 he said, were proceeding down the U. S. road in "spreading their hands out
 too far. " While he was confident they would be ultimately defeated, he
 inferred that difficult times might be expected before this came about.
 Fear of revived Japanese militarism was a major theme throughout our
 discussions.  Japan's economic growth was to him equated with expansionism,
 and he felt that rearmament to back it was already taking place.  In addition,
 China's historical distrust of the Indians came through strongly.
 I emphasized that the US would never collude with other powers against
 China and that this would be shortsighted since the US and China had no
 real conflicting interests.  Indeed, in the area of relations among large
 countries our interests were very comparable.  With respect to Japan,
 we were interested in its having the ability to defend itself, but would oppose
 Japanese militarism.  While the objective consequences of US actions might
 sometimes look like collusion, we would strive consciously to avoid this.
 I assured Chou on the following:
 that you were prepared to inform them in advance of major
 decisions we have with other great powers that might affect
 them.
 -?? that you would take their views into account.
 ,... that we would consult on items of interest to them and try to reflect
 their concerns.  I offered to explain to him our approach on other
 negotiations we were conducting, such as SALT.  Except for a
 general question on Berlin issues, he did not take this suggestion

 Chou several times emphasized that China lacked the economic base to be
 considered a great power, but had no desire to be considered one, and indeed
 wished to avoid the kind of great power rivalry existing between the Soviet
 Union and the U. S.  Chou alleged that even after China's economy became
 developed it would still not act as a great power.  The Chinese clearly like
 to picture themselves as free from the vice of great power ambitions which
 have only served to stir turmoil in the world and brougit problczxtis for the

 powers themselves.  They prefer to be cast in the role of championing the
 less powerful and fortunate countries of the world.  Their attitude toward
 great powers now is a mix of hostility, suspicions and fear.  This may be
 rather disingenuous, however, for while they profess not to envy those who are
 undisputably great powers, they may be making a virtue out of a necessity.
 And their very interest in a U. S. -Chinese summit has them playing a great
 power, game.

 I asked for their views on the Soviet proposal on a five power nuclear
 conference, ' reminding him that you had held up our response so as to
 get Chinese views.  They flatly rejected the idea as a Soviet attempt to
 lasso them.  I said we would be slow in our response; that other countries'
 pressures might force us to go along; and that if such a conference were
 held we would seek to make sure that China was not put at a disadvantage.
 On SALT I assured them we would conclude no agreement directed against
 them, and that we recognized that limiting their embryonic strategic
 program at this time would be discriminatory.  I said we were willing to
 discuss accidental war agreements with them such as we were discussing
 with the Russians; Chou replied that we could raise this with them whenever
 we wished.  I added that we were prepared to consider a renunciation of
 force agreement such as Chou had proposed in 1955.  He responded in low
 key that Taiwan was linked to this issue and immediately went on to say he
 hoped my Paris Talks with the North Vietnamese would bear fruit.

 of the four Americans still held in China when the PRC thot$ht conditions
 were ripe.  We were not making a request and recognized it was China's
 matter to decide, but we would consider their release a voluntary act of
 mercy.  Chou said that their law allowed shortened sentences for good
 behavior and they would continue to study the matter.  (This could well
 mean they might make a gesture.)

 Conclusion
 I am frank to say that this visit was ,a very moving experience. The
 historic aspects of the occasion; the warmth and dignity of the Chinese;
 the splendor of the Forbidden City, Chinese history and culture; the
 heroic stature of Chou En-lai; and the intensity and sweep of our talks
 combined to make an indelible impression on me and my colleagues.
 These forty-eight hours, and my extensive discussions with Chou in,:,.
 particular, had all the flavor, texture, variety and delicacy of a Chinese
 banquet.  Prepared from the long sweep of tradition and culture,
 meticulously cooked by hands of experience, and served in splendidly
 simple surroundings, our feast consisted of many courses, some sweet
 and some sour, all interrelated and forming a coherent whole.  It was
 a total experience, and one went away, as after all good Chinese meals,
 very satisfied but not at all satiated.
 We have laid the groundwork for you and Mao to turn a page in history.
 But we should have no illusions about the future.  Profound differences
 and years of isolation yawn between us and the Chinese.  They will be
 tough before and during the summit on the question of Taiwan and other
 major issues.  And they will prove implacable foes if our relations turn
 sour.  My assessment of these people is that they are deeply ideological,
 close to fanatic in the intensity of their beliefs. At the same time they
 display an inward security that allows them, within the framework of their
 principles, to be meticulous and reliable in dealing with others.
 Furthermore, the process we have now started will send enormous shock
 waves around the world.  It may panic the Soviet Union into sharp hostility.
 It could shake Japan loose from its heavily American moorings.  It will
 cause a violent upheaval in Taiwan.  It will have major impact on our
 other Asian allies, such as Korea and Thailand.  It will increase the
 already substantial hostility in India.  Some quarters may seek to sabotage
 the summit over the coming months.
 However, we were well aware of these risks when we embarked on this
 course.  We were aware too that the alternative was unacceptable -- .
 continued isolation from one-quarter of the world's most talented people
 and a country rich in past achievements and future potential.
 And even the risks can be managed and turned to our advantage if we
 maintain steady nerves and pursue our policies responsibly.  With the

 Soviet Union we will have to make clear the continued priorities we
 attach.  to our concrete negotiations with them.  Just as we will not
 collude with them against China, so .we have no intention of colluding
 with China against them.  If carefully managed, our new China policy
 could have a longer term beneficial impact on Moscow.
 With Japan our task will be to make clear that we are not shifting our
 allegiance in Asia from her to China.  On Taiwan we can hope for little
 more than damage limitation by reaffirming our diplomatic relations' ..
 and mutual defense treaty even while it becomes evident that we foresee
 a political evolution over the coming years.  With our other Asian allies
 we will need to stress both our continued bonds and our hope that
 reconciliation between us and the Chinese will serve the cause of regional
 peace.  And in India, after the initial shock, our China moves might
 produce a more healthy relationship.
 For Asia and for the world we need to demonstrate that we are enlarging
 the scope of our diplomacy in a way that, far from harming the interests
 of other countries, should instead prove helpful to them.
 Our dealings, both with the Chinese and others, will require reliability,
 precision, finesse.  If we can master this process, we will have made a
 revolution.

 Rawalpindi plus two representatives of the Shanghai Foreign Affairs

 A thaw began to set in later that day, when Prime Minister Chou En-lai
 met my entire official party in the Great Hall of the People.  Following
 a photographic session of his staff and mine at the entrance to the
 conference room, Chou seated us inside behind the inevitable cups of
 green tea and proceeded to say a few words of personal greetings to
 everyone in the. party.  He was extremely cordial during the general
 meeting which followed.  Then at the formal banquet which he hosted
 for the entire party (including the crew of the aircraft) he shook hands
 with each one of us individually; he gave what I consider to be an extra- .
 ordinarily warm welcoming toast (attached at Tab A); and he went
 around the room after the toast to touch glasses with every American
 present.  Chou had done his biographic homework well on those Ameri-
 cans at his table, and flattered them with references to their educational
 and professional history or past experience in China.
 From this point on the character of the visit was firmly fixed by our
 Chinese hosts.  It was in my judgment a careful, thoughtful, conscien-
 tious effort, first:
 - to make me and my party feel like truly welcome guests; and
 second;
 >- to get the Chinese public accustomed to the idea that a senior
 U. S. official and the members of his party were in fact being
 received as honored guests by the top PRC leadership.
 The way my visit was built up by the Chinese leaders, as well as the
 lengths to which they went to assure that the public and lower-ranking
 PRC officials got the message, became very apparent as the days went
 by.

 trip concerns security:  at literally every road junction along the
 entire righto?-way there was at least one uniformed member of the

 The next day, October 23, brought a further and even more ostentatious
 appearance before the Chinese public.  Our Chinese hosts had arranged
 a visit for me. and the members of my party to the Summer Palace, about
 a half--hour's drive west of Peking, and once again I was escorted by
 senior PRC officials rather than by protocol functionaries.  My host on
 this occasion was Marshal Yeh, who saw to it that he and I were properly
 -displayed together before what the Chinese call "the masses."  The
 Acting Foreign Minister and the Secretary to the Prime Minister were
 also present.  The high point of this episode was our taking tea aboard
 a boat poled out onto the Summer Palace lake in plain view of literally
 hundreds of Chinese spectators.  The fact that a strong, cold wind was
 blowing (on an otherwise perfect day) did not deter our hosts; they
 clearly wanted this, boatride to take place and only a hurricane could

 officials.
 A few other vignettes may help to characterise the spirit with which
 the Chinese received us:
 -- On the evening of October 24 a farewell banquet at the Great
 Hall of the 'People, which was originally to b  hosted by the Acting
 Foreign Minister, was preempted by Chou Ei-lai.  Chou did not have
 to do this, but made the extra effort.  As bef re, he was a most.
 gracious host.  He did not, though, repeat th   round of toasts -- once
 the dinner was over, he and I want into a nearby conference room for
 further discussion of substantive issues.
 As I have previously indicated, the aircraft crew was given
 the most hospitable treatment.  Sightseeing tours were arranged for
 the crewmen, special quarters were constructed for them at the airport,
 gifts were provided, and indeed they were accorded the same kind of
 meticulous courtesy with which those of us in the Guest House in Peking

 is a matter of tactics, but for them it involves a profound moral adjust-
 ment.  This is not easy for them, but they are making it and more.
 My.final observation once again concerns signs.  I have mentioned the
 offensive sign at the airport noted in the news reports upon our arrival
 which the interpreter in my car indeed translated for me as we sped
 past it on our way into Peking as something having to do with "American
 Imperialism.'"  When on October 26 we returned to the airport prior to
 our departure, the offensive characters were, gone.  The sign was still
 there, but had been completely repainted; the message had nothing to
 do with the United States.
 There are many possible conclusions which might be drawn from the
 atmospherics of this visit to Peking.  In my opinion, one conclusion
 Peking's Commitment to Improving Relations
 stands out above all the others:  the Chinese leadership is committed to
 a course leading toward an improvement of relations with the U. S.  The
 P.eople's Dai3  announcement and photographs, the display of friendship
 toward us by top PRC officials before their- cadres, the public gestures
 of friendship, the toning down of anti-U. S. propaganda, and the many
 instances of personal courtesies extended to us, all underscore this
 commitment.     Any reversal of the direction in which the PRC leadership
 is moving would at this point probably involve serious domestic reper-
 cussions for.Prime Minister Chou En-lai and the other senior personali-
 ties who have joined with him in this endeavor.

 special envoy Dr. Kissinger and the other American friends who
 have come to'China for this interim visit.  The purpose of Dr. Kissinger's
 present visit is to make preparations related to the political discussions
 and technical arrangements of President Nixon's visit.
 A new chapter will now be opened in the history of the relations between
 China and the United States after they have been cut off for 22 years,
 and we should say that the credit for this should go to Chairman Mao
 Tsetung and President Nixon.  Of course, there must be someone serving
 as a guide, and it was Dr.. Kissinger who courageously made a secret
 visit to China, the so-called "land of mystery".  That was quite a remark-
 able thing.  This is now Dr. Kissinger's second visit to a land that should
 no longer be considered a "mystery".  He has come as a friend, and has
 also brought with him some new friends.

 Kissinger is his advanceman.  We hope these discussions will achieve
 As for me, although I have never been to the United States, I know quite
 a fe%r- American friends, and the United States is not unfamiliar to me.
 It is evident that the social systems of our two countries are different,
 and our respective world outlooks -- Dr. Kissinger likes to use the
 word "Philosophy" -- are totally different, yet this should not prevent
 us from finding common ground.  The Sine-American talks have gone on
 for 16 years now, but no common ground has yet been found.  Now Presi-

 Our two peoples are great peoples.  Although our two countries are

 assistants plus Messrs. Chapin and Hughes on our side; our other
 meetings were private, with usually only one assistant on our side.

 questions concerning your, forthcoming trip.  This was followed by over,

 devoted to general philosophy, our overall approach to the People's

 that domestic and international constraints demand a phased resolution
 of outstanding issues.  Meanwhile the very momentum of our joint initia-
 tive carries inherent advantages: for them, the burnishing of their
 global credentials, a general direction on Taiwan, and the prospect of
 a,lower American military profile in Asia; for us, some assistance in
 reaching and safeguarding an Indochina settlement, and built-in
 restraint on Chinese activities in Asia; for both of us, less danger of
 miscalculation, greater exchanges between our peoples, and a counter-
 weignt to the Soviet union.
 Chou confirmed an essential ingredient for launching this process and
 moving-it forward - Chinese willingness, despite their past rhetoric,
 to be patient on, solutions. . He was even more explicit than in July that
 they do not require time deadlines so long as principles are established,
 Several times he emphasized that the PRC?, being a big country, could
 afford to wait on issues of direct concern, such as Taiwan, while the
 more urgent matters were those concerning her smaller friends, such
 as Indochina and, Korea, whom one couldn't expect to have a broad
 perspective.  This line is consistent with Peking's virtuous stance. of
 championing the cause of smaller nations and refusing to be a ,'superpower
 with its characteristics of bullying and overinvolvexnent.
 Another consistent theme, as in July, was Chou's insistence on frankly
 acknowledging that there is much turmoil in the world and great differences
 between us.   Both in our discussions and in the communique drafting, the
 Chinese showed their disdain for pretending that peace was either near or
 desirable as an end in itself; for submerging differences in ambiguous
 formulas of agreement, or for discussing such subsidiary issues as arms
 control, trade, or exchanges which only serve to make relations look
 more "normal" than they really are.
 Among the general points that I emphasized were the fact that in some
 areas we could set trends but the policy implementation had to be gradual;
 that we should not push the process too fast because this would give your
 domestic opponents a chance to sink your initiative; and that Peking should
 not try-to complicate our relations with our allies.
 In brief, the essential outcome on each of the. major topics was as follows:

 to our approach of minimizing our requirements and Chinese

 such as ongoing contacts and exchanges; and (3) the technical arrange-

 (See the next section of this report.),
 Chou and I then informally agreed on 'a game plan for the three types of
 issues that we .had already settled in'advance through communications
 and a private talk I had. with the senior. Chinese representative who had
 come to meet us at Shanghai.
 (This game plan was carefully followed over the next five days: On the
 technical subjects, I laid out the fundamental considerations and handed
 over thse books we had prepared in advance.  The Chinese .studied these
 and came back with questions in meetings with technical personnel headed
 on our side by Messrs. Chapin and Hughes.    The major issues were
 referred back to me and Chou and were settled in social and private
 sessions.  Chou and I held a series of private meetings on the major
 substantive issues and the drafting of the communique.  The State Depart-
 ment representative and a member of my staff held two sessions on the
 subsidiary issues of diplomatic contacts, exchanges and trade.)
 Chou ri ade some preliminary comments on the substantive agenda which
 foreshadowed his approach on subsequent days.  He termed Taiwan the
 crucial issue for normalizing our relations.  He called Indochina the
 most urgent issue in order to relax tensions in the Far East.. He moved
 Korea to third on the agenda, giving it a higher priority than in July,
 citing both sides' responsibilities for settling this question which the
 1954 .Geneva Conference had not treated.  His fourth and fifth topics were
 Japan, which he said had a far-reaching influence on reducing Asian
 tensions, and South Asia where both sides were concerned.  He put rela-
 tions with the Soviet Union sixth and last; this was not a main issue, as
 Peking was not opposed to our relations with any other country.
 Then, clearly for the record, Chou once again said that they, would prefer
 it if you visited Moscow before Peking.. I subsequently repeated for the
 record that it was we who had set the date for the Moscow summit, and
 this was based on the ripening of conditions, not on Peking's desires to
 interfere with US-USSR relations.  Chou eagerly assented.
 Chou came back to my statement that the old must coexist with the new.

 Chou rejoined this was only part of the story and couldnot be accepted
 absolutely.  Since  we  were entering a new era it was necessary that

 Taiwan, but until we were able to cement our friendship we should not give

 from which they were trying to escape.
 I then sounded a warning about Peking's making trouble for us with our
 allies.  First, I, noted that we supported Britain's entry into the Common
 Market and a more unified and autonomous Europe.  I added that we
 didn't seek to drive a wedge between the PRC and its friends, and it
 would be shortsighted if either side tried to use the improvement in our
 relations as a device to destroy the traditional friendships of the other
 side,  This would only cause the two sides to draw back into the rigidity

 issues. He did not do this, partly because this is not his style and partly
 because he needs the visit as much as we do.  In any event, while we'had

 This remains, as we always knew it would, the single most difficult issue.
 On the one hand Chou says that the PRC, being a large country, can afford
 to be patient; that it is showing restraint in the language that it is suggesting
 in the communique for your visit; and that Indochina, and even Korea, are more

 that we can do more than we can say, that to push the process too fast and
 too explicitly could wreck the whole fabric of our China initiative.  While
 Chou understands our dilemma, he has problems of his own and. he must
 show concrete progress on this issue for his own domestic and inter-
 national audiences.  Accordingly, our discussions and our communique
 Resolution of this issue in a way that allows our relations to move forward
 over the next few years depends on China's willingness to accept our thesis
 ing the understandings that we had laid out in July:
 clarity and ours for ambiguity.
 This was the first substantive issue that we discussed.  I opened by review-
 -- We would withdraw those forces on Taiwan related to Indochina
 in a relatively short period after the war in Indochina is over.
 -- We would reduce other forces on Taiwan progressively over a
 longer period of time, depending on the state of our relations.
 In response to Chou's query, I said that we would not set a final
 date on these withdrawals but that both sides understood the
 evolution.
 We would not advocate a two-China or one China, one Taiwan
 solution.  At this point Chou said that we should not advocate
 a one-china, two-government solution as suggested by our UN
 position.  He noted the PRC had been very restrained in its
 attacks on this position.

 and the Prime Minister in a restricted meeting.  I added that this was a
 painful process for us; we had worked with the government on Taiwan for
 years and whatever the historical causes, it was not easy to make such
 changes. , Opposition to this policy would certainly arise as it began to
 unfold.  We would not challenge the PRC view that this was an internal
 matter, but the PRC should settle the issue peacefully.
 On the UN, I noted that we had carried out the policy I had outlined in July
 and that we had kept our rhetoric down.  In fact it was better for both of
 our countries if the Albanian Resolution did not pass this year, for then
 the process would be pushed too fast and there would be a rallying point

 were nationwide, even global in scope.  I said that as far as I
 knew the US had nothing to do with this and that' I would check into
 the facts.  Chou took the occasion to criticize CIA actions around
 the world, and I rebutted briefly.

 After a brief historical-lesson on why Taiwan is Chinese territory, Chou
 revealed what the British were prepared to do in order to elevate their
 diplomatic mission in Peking to Ambassadorial level: acknowledge that
 Taiwan was a province of China, withdraw their consulate from Taiwan,
 and support the Albanian Resolution at the UN.  The British would also
 agree privately that they would not promote the view that the status of
 Taiwan was undetermined, and if they received inquiries the British

 question.  How the Chinese people would solve the q estion of Taiwan was of

 Chou said this would be sufficient if the PRC acted expediently, but
 instead they considered it unacceptable.  The PRC objected to the British
 reserving their position if the issue of Taiwan's status were raised; Chou
 noted that Britain signed the Cairo and Potsdam declarations declaring
 Taiwan belonged to China.  He reinforced this by relating some more
 history, including the US role, to demonstrate why the status of Taiwan
 was not undetermined and to underline PRC sensitivity to this issue.  He
 then got to his point:. what was the US policy?  Do we maintain that the
 status of Taiwan is still undetermined or was it our view that Taiwan had
 what our policy is.  We did not challenge the premise that all Chinese
 maintain there is only one China and that Taiwan is part of that China.
 In that sense we didn't maintain that the status of Taiwan was undetermined.
 Expressing this in a communique was a different matter, but we were
 prepared to note that all Chinese maintain there is but one China.  We
 would also make sure that there would be no further statements by our
 officials that Taiwan's status is undetermined.  In response to Chou's
 question about what we would say if other countries were to raise this
 question, I said that I would have to check this with you.  l assured Chou
 that we were not encouraging any government to maintain that the status
 of Taiwan was undetermined and that the UK position had not received

 issue we would certainly not support it; I pointed to our UN position which
 I responded by again saying that we must separate what we could say and
 was careful not to address this question.

 them than the UN seat and that they would refuse to, go to the UN if our

 the one-China position of all Chinese and by indicating that we would reduce
 our forces in the Taiwan area.  Chou's formulations, which I could not
 accept, would have us actively express the wish that a one-China solution
 be brought about by peaceful means and pledge that we would finally withdraw
 all our forces from Taiwan and the Taiwan Straits.

 Our discussions on the afternoon of October 21 on this subject were
 generally similar to those we held in July.
 I underscored the reasonableness of our approach, pointing out that our
 negotiating proposals had addressed every concern of their allies.  I
 stressed the advantages to the PRC of an Indochina settlement, on the
 one hand, and the risks of.continued conflict on the other hand. 'Against
 this backdrop I made a somewhat more emphatic pitch than July for
 Chinese help with Hanoi, while still making it clear that we would not
 embarrass Peking.  Chou, in turn, emphasized the desirability of our
 setting final withdrawals before your visit (without insisting on a political.
 solution).  He reiterated that peace had to be made with Hanoi directly,

 need for final U. S. withdrawals.  He asked why we had not accepted, or

 they could not accept Ambassador Bruce in Peking while a war was still

 Chou made a distinction between Vietnamese and Indochina-wide

 freeze the political situation in the entire region (his main problem
 being Sihanouk's status, of course).  I said that we would not interfere
 with whatever governments evolved as a result of the ceasefire.  We
 then had a testy exchange on Cambodia where I pointed out that there
 would not be any need to arrange a ceasefire if North Vietnamese troops

 I then summed up:

 -- We were no long-term threat to the independence of Vietnam

 -- We recognized the limits to what the PRC could do and the

 -- We could not go any further than our proposals of October 11.
 Chou again commented that they hoped we could settle and get out, whereas
 the Soviet Union wished to pin us down.  He said it would be impossible
 not to mention Vietnam in the communique if the war had not been settled.
 I rejoined that there should be no misapprehension that Vietnam was an
 extremely sensitive issue for us and that it was impossible to accept a
 communique that was critical of us.    When Chou asked why we had not

 to see a major offensive -- and our reaction -- shadowing the summit.
 Thus the situation on the ground, and our declining role should provide
 settlement.

 Chou devoted considerable time and passion to this subject, which he
 placed as number three on the agenda.  In East Asia, the three princi-
 pal "powder kegs", in his view, were Taiwan, Indochina and Korea,
 with the last two the most urgent.  (This had some quality of being for
 the record to prove loyalty to allies. )

 as he had in July, that the 1954 Geneva Conference had not settled the
 Korean question. . A ceasefire had been reached but no treaty had been
 concluded and a serious crisis could therefore arise.  He said that the
 Panmunjom meetings had gotten nowhere, that North Korea had no parti-
 cipation in the UN debate, and that North Korea could participate in
 since the July talks.
 Chou continued as follows:
 U. S. military forces should withdraw from South Korea as
 Chinese forces had done in 1958.  He acknowledged that we
 had already taken out a third of our troops and said that we
 had paid a great price to do it, i. e. extensive military
 - . The 1965 treaty with Japan was even more serious and there
 was the possibility that Japanese military forces would
 replace American ones.  Officers of Japanese self-defense
 troops had been going to Korea (I had checked on this since
 July and Chou was indeed correct).
 If there were increased military strength and hostilities after
 we withdrew this could not but directly affect relaxation of
 tension in the Far East.
 Their Korean friends were "most tense" and this could not
 but affect the Chinese government and people.

 abusive series,of demands upon us to withdraw our forces and military
 support for Korea, give North Korea equal status, prevent Japanese
 influence, disband UNCURK,. leave the Korean question to the Koreans
 themselves, and let North Korea participate in the UN debate uncondi-

 that while big China could live with the problem of its divided status for
 a while, the PRC could -not ask its -smaller, friends, Vietnam and Korea,

 Chou backed off from the abusive language, stating that it was "firing
 empty guns.'' I said that the substance was more important in any event.
 I informed him that we had received a communication from North Korea,
 through Ro~mania, earlier this year and had responded in a conciliatory
 fashion but had heard no more.  I then clarified what the objectives in the
 peninsula should be.  We were prepared to discuss the possibility of a
 more permanent legal basis for the existing situation in Korea, but we
 were not interested in a legal situation that made the reopening of hosti-
 lities possible (i. e. we would not scrap present arrangements so as to
 invite aggression).   When I noted that our ultimate objective was the
 reduction of U. S. forces in Korea, Chou again raised the fear of Japanese
 troops replacing ours. I assured him that our policy here was the same
 as on Taiwan, namely that it was not our objective to replace our forces
 with Japanese self-defense forces and that we were opposed generally to
 the military expansion of Japan.  Chou declared that the PRC attached

 -forces would continue to go down and could be expected to

 Chou again emphasized that keeping Japanese military forces out was
 paramount.  I said that we would attempt to do this, but that if North
 Korea should start aggression then one could not be sure of the conse-
 quences.  I made very clear that whatever we could do in Korea depended
 on North Korean restraint.  Chou agreed that all these issues were
 mutual and that both of us should use our influence with our friends to
 keep them from military adventures.  He cautioned, however, that the
 era of negotiations, such as the Red Cross meetings, could be the era
 of "dragging out" and while they would wait on Taiwan, it was harder
 for their smaller friends to be patient.
 In the communique draft we agree to disagree.  The Chinese back their
 allies' eight points and call for abolition of UNCURK.  We honor our
 commitments to South Korea and endorse reduced tension and increased
 communication in the peninsula.  These formulations are preferable
 to a formal joint position that. suggests we are negotiating on behalf of

 he continued to fall back on pat phrases
 At my invitation, Chou outlined Chinese views of Japan:
 Japan's "feathers have grown on its wings and it is about
 to take off", i. e. its tremendous economic expansion was
 inevitably leading it toward military expansion;
 - Its economic assistance to other countries was not to help
 them develop but rather to establish Japanese economic
 domination;
 -- The Soviet Union was looking for Japanese investment and
 markets and was encouraging it to be more aggressive;
 China was not hostile toward Japan, and great changes have
 taken place in both countries since the war; the PRC was
 ready to conduct its relations on the basis of the five
 principles of peaceful coexistence..
 When I questioned Chou on what he meant when he said that the PRC
 wanted Japan to pursue a policy of "peace and friendship", he defined
 this as Japan's recognizing the PRC's sovereignty over Taiwan, giving

 was no question that if we withdrew our umbrella they would very rapidly
 build nuclear weapons.  When Chou asked whether we were capable of
 limiting Japan's self-defense strength, I said that I could not promise
 this, but that we would have a better opportunity to do this with our
 present relationship than in a situation when Japan felt betrayed by us
 and Japanese nationalism asserted itself.  I said that we had no incentive
 to encourage Japan to be dominant twenty-five years after World War II

 Siberia.  I thought both sides would play with each other but neither would

 South Asia
 This issue surprisingly consumed much less time than I expected, and
 while China clearly stands behind Pakistan, I detected less passion
 and more caution from Chou than I had in July.
 Chou opened up by mentioning an October 7 letter from Kosygin to
 Yahya which he termed equivalent to an ultimatum threatening Pakistan.
 He said the situation was very dangerous and asked for our estimate.
 I made the following points;
 - - At first India had a reasonable complaint about the political
 and economic burden of the refugees coming from East Paki-
 stan.  We had moved to meet this problem by providing over
 one-half of the foreign relief to refugees in India, or nearly
 $2O million.
 -- However, India was now trying to take advantage of the crisis
 as a means of settling the whole problem of Pakistan, not just
 -East Pakistan.  The Indian strategy apparently is to change
 abruptly the situation in East Pakistan so as to shake the
 political fabric of West Pakistan.
 - - I then outlined U.S. policy and the steps we had taken to support
 Pakistan in the consortium, debt relief, and other bilateral areas.
 I emphasized our total opposition to military action by India, the
 warnings that I had given the Indian ambassador about cutting off
 economic aid if they were to move, and the fact that you would
 repeat these warnings to Mrs. Gandhi when she visited the U. S.
 I added that we had urged the Russians to exercise restraint.
 They had told us they were trying to do so, but we were not sure
 whether this was in fact the case.
 -- We thought there was a good chance that in the near future that
 India would either attack or provoke Pakistan into action.
 -- Finally, I outlined our proposal that both forces withdraw their
 troops from the border and that Yahya make some political
 offers so as to overcome hostile propaganda and make it easier

 Chou thanked me for this information and said that he wished to study
 the Kosygin letter further before discussing this issue the next day in
 more detail.  He commented that Tito had been. persuaded to the Indian
 view by Mrs. Gandhi, and this plus Soviet support would increase the
 risk of Indian miscalculation,

 the Soviet Union had made concessions very rapidly and given up all their
 principles.  He said indeed that the Berlin Agreement had turned out to
 be much more substantive, with Soviet concessions, than we had esti-
 mated in our private communications.  I responded that we had fore-
 shadowed that the agreement would primarily concern access procedures
 and asked him what other concessions he thought Moscow had made.  He
 said that the Russians had conceded that West Berlin was a part of West
 Germany, which they had never done before and which would embarrass
 East Germany.

 ail disputed territories -- this was unacceptable. )
 Throughout our meetings Chou often interlaced disdainful and hostile
 comments about the USSR, but always in the tone that the PRC was not
 afraid of any confrontation.  He referred to their petty negotiating tactics,
 their sticking their hands out in various places, and their complicating
 of efforts for an Indochina settlement (a point reiterated by Marshal Yeh

 that we would try to deflect discussion on this initiative into specific

 other major powers and Chou took this reference out.
 I think we have made a useful record in recent months of making clear
 to the Chinese that. we are not trying to conclude arms control agreements
 at their expense, that we recognize their current lack of interest in the
 subject, and that we are always ready to conclude with them any agreement
 that we have made with the Soviet Union. . While I do not think they will
 want to discuss these subjects seriously in the near future, our stand should
 be both reassuring to them and a clear demonstration of reasonableness and
 equal treatment.

 American Prisoners in China
 As in July, I waited until the final meeting to raise this subject and did
 so as asking the PRC ' a favor, not making a formal proposal.. You will
 recall that the PRC holds four men: Downey (life) and Fecteau (20 years)
 downed on a CIA-sponsored flight in 1952; and Smith and Flynn (no charges)
 pilots in Vietnam who went over the border in 1965 and 1967 respectively.
 Since July, I had checked into the actual circumstances concerning
 Downey and Fecteau whom the Chinese had claimed were CIA agents.
 They indeed were, and CIA, for its part, would be willing for us to admit
 their activities if this were required to get the men released.  In my
 talks with Chou, I confined myself to saying that I had found that these
 men had engaged in activities that would be considered illegal by my
 country.  I thus said that our plea had nothing to do with the justice of
 the case, on which we conceded that the Chinese had a correct legal
 position. However, if, as an act of clemency, the PRC would consider
 that they had been sufficiently punished, this would make a very good
 impression in the U. S.
 -- They had released early this year the old man, Mr. Walsh.
 the pilots were relased before the Vietnam war were concluded, this

 he further defined as confessing to crimes.  In response to
 my question, he said that they had all confessed.

 In about two months time the PRC might consider lessening
 the sentence of some of the men who had behaved well and
 they would let us know later what they had in mind.
 I said that we would do our best to see that anyone released
 would not engage in propaganda against the PRC, and Chou
 admitted that Walsh had behaved well since his release.
 I then inquired about the two pilots; to my knowledge theirs were unintended
 intrusions into Chinese territory and they were victims of the war.  Chou
 replied that Peking had to deal with these men "in a different light. " If
 already with Hanoi).

 .Chou concluded by suggesting that they could move on the two agents
 first, pointing out that they had already served long sentences and
 that Fecteau's term was almost completed.  I said this would mean a
 great deal to the American people and we would treat any release as

 to keep this information secret, for any public disclosure of Chinese

 When we raised the subject of trade and said we were prepared to liberalize
 our restrictions further, they said bluntly that they had absolutely no
 interest in the matter.  Indeed they were grateful that the USSR and the US
 had caused them to be self-reliant.

 The Chinese disinterest in these subsidiary issues probably stems partly
 from a wish to focus more on the fundamental issues in the US-PRC
 relationship, and partly from a desire to preserve as much ideological
 purity as feasible by not appearing to rush into a too-active program of
 contacts and exchanges with the U. S.  As for trade, they may not have
 defined their goals and probably see little immediate potential in any event.
 On the other hand, the Chinese appeared to appreciate our rationale for
 seeking to make some progress on subsidiary issues: that this would help
 make movement possible on the more fundamental questions and convince
 detractors of improved relations that gains could, in fact, be made from
 this course.  Thus they included references in the draft co::: m rdyuc to
 sending a periodic envoy to Peking and to facilitating exchanges in various

 TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE
 EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY
 MEMORANDUM FOR:         THE PRESIDENT
 FROM:                   HENRY A. KISSINGER
 SUBJECT:                My October China Visit: Drafting the
 Communique
 Prime Minister Chou En-lai and I negotiated a tentative draft commu-
 nique for your China trip (attached at Tab A), in the course of going
 through seven drafts and eleven hours of meetings during the last two
 and'a half days of my visit. During this process Chou was extremely
 tough and skillful but also reasonable and broad in outlook.  The result
 of our efforts is an unusual communique that clearly states differences
 as well as common ground between the two countries and reassures
 the friends of both sides rather than ra.i.sin.g' anxieties because of the
 compromise language, which would be subject to varying interpretations.
 A communique along these lines should portray your conversations with
 Mao and Chou as being between leaders who stuck by their principles
 but had the largeness of perspective to move relations forward despite
 profound disagreements.
 Our position on Taiwan (page 6) is the only remaining issue.  Although
 we significantly narrowed our differences on this most painful issue,
 including a clear effort by Chou to show some restraint, I said that I
 could not accept the final Chinese compromise formulation, that I would
 have to check with you, and that we would go back to them with counter-
 language.. The rest of the communique remains tentative, of course,
 and is subject to change because of events during the next four months
 and your talks with the Chinese leaders.  But we now have a working
 draft which should be acceptable to both sides, though causing both
 some domestic problems, and which could never have been produced
 under the time and publicity pressure of your stay in China.
 Tabling of Conventional U. S. Draft
 As reported in separate memoranda, we spent the first three and
 a half days of talks establishing the basic framework of arrangements

 for your visit and exploring in depth the various substantive topics we
 had covered in July.  With this backdrop I tabled a draft communique --
 which you had seen -- the evening of October 22 (Tab G).  It was highly
 conventional, stressing fuzzy areas of agreement and using vague
 generalizations.  Its basic thrust was to glide over differences and.,
 emphasize common ground.  I purposely held back our formulations on
 specific areas like Indochina, Korea, South Asia, or the military forces
 on Taiwan.  On the evening of October 23, Chou gave me his initial
 reaction.  It was that it could serve as a basis for discussion, that
 naturally they would want to add their views in some places to show
 differences, and that he would send his Acting Foreign Minister to
 undertake the redrafting process the next morning.
 Sharp Chinese Response
 On the morning of October 24, Chou showed up personally instead
 and delivered a scorching one-hour presentation --y as he indicated --
 at the explicit instructions of Mao.  His basic theme was that the
 Chinese believed in revolutionary progress rather than a Metternich-type
 peace that stressed stability at the expense of justice and was bound to
 be short-lived because of its essential oppressiveness.  Progress
 required struggle not peace, or peace only after struggle.  The world
 is in turmoil and the small would inevitably overturn the big. We could
 not continue to hang onto our old friends if we were entering a new era.
 Chou dearly had been ordered by Mao to emphasize the Chinese
 revolutionary dogma and reject our effort to submerge differences and
 accent cooperation.  He said that our basic approach was unacceptable.
 Our fundamental differences had to be set forth in a communique; other-
 wise the wording would have an "untruthful appearance. "  Our present
 draft was the sort of banality the Soviets would sign but neither mean
 nor observe.  The Chinese kept their promises;. they were not afraid to
 state disagreements.
 accept the basic approach of each side's stating its views so long as we
 we started our new relationship by betraying our old friends, and that
 problems had to be solved by history, not force.  I said that we could
 I replied very harshly, saying that Chou's position hadn't surprised
 me, but that such language of infallibility and preaching was intolerable
 for a communique.  I pointed out that the Chinese wouldn't respect us if

 also staked out common ground so as to indicate progress.  I empha-
 sized that we would reject language that tended to put us on trial or
 to humiliate an American President.  After explaining the difficulties
 with drafting a communique from scratch during your visit, I concluded
 by saying that the choice was up to Chou, reminding him that he had
 said to an American group that it didn't matter if your trip failed.
 Chou affirmed their wish for a successful. visit and asked for a break.
 He then agreed to launch into a drafting process.
 This exchange foreshadowed our basic positions in the negotiating
 process we then embarked upon.  Chou's emphasis was on sharp delinea-
 tion of our respective positions while my objectives were to dilute the
 rhetoric and shorten the length of opposing views, and expand areas of
 agreement.
 Chinese Counter-draft Stressing Differences
 The Chinese worked on a draft all day and, after stuffing us with
 roast duck at a banquet, tabled their first draft that evening (Tab F).
 It contained very strong rhetoric on their general approach to inter-
 national affairs and sharp formulations of Chinese views on specific
 issues.  Despite my needling, Chou was at first reluctant to hand his
 draft over.  I responded that I agreed with the basic concept of both
 sides plainly, stating their views and then common positions, but that
 the Chinese views were phrased in the most intransigent fashion and
 you would not travel all the way to China to hear propaganda that one
 could read in the -newspapers.
 I then voiced our principal objections.  In the general section, we
 could not have an American President sign a document which said that
 revolution has become the irresistible trend of history or that "the
 people's revolutionary struggles are just."     Nor would we brook reference
 to racial discrimination -- while we were equally opposed to it, mention
 of it in this communique would be certainly interpreted as a critique of
 American domestic problems.  There was almost no mention of agreed
 principles in international or bilateral relations.
 On specific issues, the Chinese draft had us both stating that
 Vietnam was the most urgent question for the relaxation of tension in the
 Far East,  It cited China as "the reliable rear area" and Chinese backing

 for the Indochinese peoples' "fighting to the end for the attainment of
 their goal" -- clearly unacceptable phrasing while Americans were
 dying or held prisoner in Indochina.  The Chinese called for the
 complete withdrawal of US troops from South Korea and Japan and the
 unconditional return of Okinawa.  The draft had both sides agreeing
 that Taiwan is the "crucial issue" obstructing normalization of bilateral
 relations.. And the Chinese had linked periodic visits of US envoys to
 progress on Taiwan; this I rejected too.
 I stated that the total impact of their draft would be disastrous and
 inconsistent with our self-respect W- the rhetoric must be toned down
 and some progress shown.  I delayed our scheduled departure from
 the next morning to the next afternoon.  Our side, then went back to our
 Guest House to redraft the better part of the night.
 Our counter-draft (Tab E),which we presented the morning of
 October 25, took out their most offensive language, put in our own posi-
 tions and beefed.up areas of agreement.                      On specific regional issues
 we kept the structure of each side's expressing its views and then a
 common position, albeit rather vapidly.  I defined our objective as
 being to state differences without being offensive and showing a positive
 direction without raising false hopes.  I again put off our departure, to
 the next morning.  The Chinese took our draft away, and we once again
 endured a lengthy wait until dinner time that night when we got the
 second Chinese draft (Tab D).
 Because of time pressure we had but two hours to deal with what
 remained a tough version.  There was still much objectionable Chinese
 rhetoric and not enough positive material.  The Chinese, had also changed
 the structure, lumping regional issues with general views under each
 side's position and not attempting to state explicit agreed positions on
 these specific questions.  Chou explained his reasons:
 (1)  We should not state common positions for appearance sake,
 but only when they in fact exist -- this wasn't really the case for the
 regional issues.
 (2) The agreements were so vague as to lead each side to explain
 its position in contradictory manner giving rise to post-summit contro-
 versy.
 (3) It gave impressions of Sino-US condominium which was in
 neither party's interest.
 No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-467-5-1-7
 TOP SI.ECRET/SENSITIVE/EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY
 I pointed out with melancholy that the Chinese draft still accentuated
 our differences in provocative fashion.  We had to decide whether we
 were starting a new period in our relationship or employing new tactics
 in a continuing struggle.  We would be condemned for signing such a
 document which still had a largely negative cast to it, appealed to revo-
 lution, and spoke of supporting the Vietnamese people to the end.  I then
 gave them our third draft (Tab C) proposing once again reduction of
 their offensive phrasing, e. g. on revolution and backing the Indochinese
 peoples' struggles, and restoring some positive language of agreement.
 I also was somewhat more forthcoming on Taiwan which now was clearly
 emerging as the most difficult issue.  Making clear that I was stretching
 my instructions, I used language that said the US would not challenge
 (rather than-merely noting) the views of all Chinese that there is but one
 China and indicated progressive reduction of US forces on Taiwan.
 During two hours of sparring Chou elaborated some of the philo-
 sophic underpinning of their approach to the communique.  He drew a
 clear distinction between principle and policy execution, in effect
 paralleling our approach that we could set a course on certain issues
 but time was needed to resolve them..  In this session particularly, but
 also in others, he emphasized that while they had to have principles like
 troop withdrawals or sovereignty over Taiwan, they clearly could do
 without time deadlines.  They were in no hurry but the direction must
 be clear.  Chou was startlingly frank and concrete with respect to our
 military withdrawal from Taiwan -- not only would they not press for
 a timetable, they actually preferred that some US forces remain so as
 to keep the Japanese forces out!
 After very candid exchanges, the Chinese took away our draft
 for revision at. 11:35 p. m.
 Agreement on a Tentative Draft
 At 4:45 a. m. , October 26, we were given a. third Chinese draft
 (Tab B) which was a considerable improvement.  It muted some of their
 rhetoric in the direction of our changes and kept most of our additions
 of positive language.  On Taiwan, they clearly made an effort but their
 formulation was still beyond what I could accept.
 We met at 5:30 a. m. with four or five fundamental issues remain-
 ing.               I pointed to a few phrases which remained annoying and to the
 deletion of our reference to our honoring our commitments to Korea.

 Chou said that it was a difficult situation because they had accepted
 without change our statements of principle, such as individual freedom
 and peaceful competition (this was true) while we were trying to dilute
 their formulations.  There was no question that the two sides have
 deep differences and they should be stated.  He suggested that it was
 extremely difficult to reach agreed language before I left, that this
 text was tentative, and that some work could be left until your visit.
 I rejoined that the more we could settle now the ,better.  Chou agreed
 but stressed the need for confidentiality.  He then again displayed
 reasonableness as he made a further effort to curb some of their language
 and agreed to restoration of our Korean language.
 We also- had another long exchange on Taiwan during which he made
 clear he could budge no further.  He pointed out that they had used great
 restraint on this question, had thought hard about reformulations which
 could meet our concern, and were not stipulating any timetables.  How-
 ever, there had to be some concreteness or the Chinese people would not
 understand.  He agreed with me that their objective was to be explicit
 on this question while ours was to be ambiguous.  In turn I said I was
 already operating on the margin of my authority with the formulation
 I had proposed and was extremely doubtful that you would consider their
 language.  We left it that I would discuss this with you and might propose
 a new formulation, in which case they might be able to change a couple
 of words.
 By 8:10 a. m, , we had reached agreement on the tentative draft
 at Tab A except for Taiwan (underlined portion) as well as cleaning up
 remaining technical issues such as public announcements and statements.
 I reaffirmed to Chou that knowledge of this communique would be confined
 to the White House.  They clearly want secrecy about this document for
 the same reasons we do, as well as not to derogate from Mao's authority
 before he has had a chance to talk to you.
 THE RESULT
 The draft communique should serve us better than the conventional type
 which contains contrived and ambiguous language.  It is an honorable
 document in which both sides vigorously and inoffensively set forth
 their differing views on the world scene and specific issues.  This
 reflects the basic reality, which you have been stressing, that there

 TOP SI+CRET/SENSITI,VE/EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY
 are fundamental differences between us and the Chinese.  The communique
 then states how despite these. differences, we have common interests in
 our conduct of international relations and bilateral dealings and how we
 propose to further them.  There is thus both realism and forward movement.
 This paper should prove more reassuring to our friends than a blander
 document where they would search for hidden meanings or understandings.
 US-PRC joint positions on such questions as Indochina, Japan and Korea
 would be all but meaningless given our differences and could only be
 expressed in language that each side could interpret as it wished.  Such
 agreements would either be an artful exercise in semantics or suggest
 we and the PRC were negotiating on behalf of third countries (which,
 moreover, the communique states that we won't do).
 Instead, while the PRC supports its allies, we go clearly on record as
 honoring our commitments to Korea and placing the highest value on our
 relationship with Japan and honoring our mutual defense treaty obliga--
 tions.  On the Asian subcontinent our neutrally-phrased position compares
 with Peking's pro-Pakistan stance -- this should help us marginally with
 India while not really hurting us with Pakistan, for whom we remain the
 only real Western friend.  On Indochina, we restate our standard position,
 and this issue may well have been transformed by the time of your visit.
 Some of the Chinese rhetoric in the document is unpleasant and this,
 combined with what inevitably will be a painful section. on Taiwan, will
 cause us some problems.    But Chou took out the most offensive language
 such as supporting revolutions and opposing racial discrimination and
 generally rounded off the Chinese statements so that they are very mild
 in comparison to standard Maoist expressions.
 The Chinese hardly need the communique as a propaganda vehicle.  They
 have many other instruments for that purpose (including now the United
 Nations).  Indeed the language on Chinese positions, while naturally still
 grating on American ears, can only look restrained to any audience
 familiar with the usual public lines.  In fact, it is difficult to see how
 Chou could have gone much further on the language and still preserved
 his international and domestic positions.  He recognized the points I
 made about our own domestic problems and took them into account in.
 his redrafting.  Furthermore while he let us edit his formulations, he
 did not, attempt to change ours -- he even reinserted some language of
 ours that we had dropped because we had,deleted some of their phrases.

 TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE/EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY
 Another positive element was Chou's restraint in terms of making any
 demands onus.  While there is some vigorous rhetoric on .general
 principles, the Chinese do not, for example, specifically call for the
 withdrawal of our forces from Korea or Japan.  Indeed Chou time and
 again emphasized that, while in principle foreign forces should be
 withdrawn, the PRC was not specifying any time limits.
 .Thus the Chinese are willing to pursue their objectives by banking on
 the thrust of history.  They will continue to be tough, but they essentially
 accept our arguments that we can often do more than we say, that the
 process must be gradual, and that some issues must be left to evolu-
 tionary pressures.  This involves great risks for them, at home and
 abroad, given their past public demands and dissidents in their own
 camp.
 Furthermore, they are clearly gambling on your reelection.  Chou
 specifically pointed out toward the end that they could be in real trouble
 if your Administration was not in power to implement our understandings.
 He shares what he described as your wish that you preside over the
 200th anniversary of America's birth.
 All of this does not mean that Chou was easy to deal with -- he emphati-
 cally was not.  But nevertheless he was able to empathize with our
 difficulties and he made an effort to produce language to meet our
 concerns.  Nor is the communique without domestic and international
 problems.  But it is fair to say that the problems for Chou and the PRC
 are at least as great.

 supports individual freedom and social progress for all the peoples of
 the world, free of outside pressure or intervention.  The U. S. side stated
 that the peoples of Indochina should be allowed to determine their destiny
 without outside intervention; that its constant primary objective has been
 a negotiated solutionxand that in the absence of a negotiated settlement it
 envisaged the ultimate withdrawal of all U. S. forces from the region
 consistent with the ai:21;. of true self-determination for each country of
 Indochina.  The existing commitments between the U. S. and Republic
 of Korea would be honored;   the United States would support all efforts of
 the Republic of Korea to seek a relaxation of the tension and increased
 communication in the Korean peninsula.  The United States placed the
 highest value on its friendly relationswith Japan and it would continue
 to honor its mutual defense treaty obligations.  The United States urged
 India and Pakistan to resolve their differences through peaceful
 negotiations; all attempts to use armed force to settle international problems
 are contrary to the interests of the people cf this region.
 There are essential differences between China and the United States
 in their social systems and foreign policies.  However, the two sides
 agreed that countries, regardless of their social systems, should conduct
 their relations on the principles of respect for the sovereignty and
 territorial integrity of all states, non-aggression against other states,
 non-interference in the internal affairs of other
 states,
 equality and mutual
 benefit, and peaceful coexistence.  International disputes should be settled

 It would be against the interests of the peoples of the world
 any major country to collude with another against other -countries, or

 With these principles of international relations in mind the two
 sides stated that:

 and'the United States is in the interests of all countries;
 both wish to reduce the dax{ger of international military conflict;
 neither seeks hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region and each is
 opposed to efforts by any other  romtry  or group of countries to establish
 such hegemony; and
 neither is prepared to negotiate on behalf of any third party or to
 enter into agreements or understandings directed at other states.
 The two sides reviewed the long-standing serious disputes between
 China and the United States.  The Chinese side reaffirmed its position:
 The Taiwan question is the crucial question obstructing the normalization
 of relations between China and the United States; the Government of the
 People's Republic of China is the sole legal Government of China; Taiwan
 is a part of Chinese territory which has long been returned to the motherland;

 the liberation of Taiwan is China's internal affair in which no other country
 has the right to interfere; and the U. S. troops must withdraw from Taiwan.
 The Chinese Government firmly opposes any activities which aim at the
 creation of ':'one China, one Taiwan, " "one China,   two  governments, "
 "two Chinas, "  an  "independent Taiwan" or advocate that "the status of Taiwan
 remains to be determined. "
 ? The U. S. side declared:  The United States acknowledges that all
 Chinese on either side of the Taiwan Straits maintain there is but one China and
 that Taiwan is a province of China.  The United States Government does not
 challenge that position; it hopes that the               u  -Cie Taiwan question
 consistent with this position will be achieved through peaceful negotiations
 and states that it will _progressively reduce and finally withdraw all the
 U. S. troops and military installations from Taiwan.
 The two sides agreed that pending the normalization of relations between
 the two countries, the Governments of the two countries would respectively
 take measures to facilitate the exchange of visits between the two peoples
 and their contacts in the scientific, technical, journalistic and cultural fields.
 The two sides agreed that the U. S. Government will send a senior,,
 representative to Peking at irregular intervals for concrete consultations
 to further the normalization of relations and carry forward negotiations on
 issues of common interest.

 Haig:           I am very honored that the Prime Minister is seeing me
 personally.
 Chou En-lai:    Yes, because I heard from Minister Fei and the
 Director of West European, American and Australian
 Affairs, who both told me that you had important
 matters to convey.
 Haig:           Yes, Dr. Kissinger and the President asked me to
 request an audience to give you, in blunt terms, a
 soldier's assessments of recent events in South Asia
 and discuss them in context of the President's visit.
 Chou En-lai:    How is Dr. Kissinger?  I heard he had a slight cold.
 Haig:           He has had a touch of the flu but is much better today.
 Chou En-lai:    You have to be careful here too because it is snowing.
 I don't know whether it has snowed in Washington yet.

 Haig:             We have had no snow yet.  Usually by this time we
 would have had snow.
 Chou En-lai:      This is your first visit to China, I suppose?
 Haig:             Yes, both myself and Mrs. Hartley.  We are very
 honored to be here.  I said today that my father-in-
 law came to China some. 48 years ago for his first
 visit to China.
 Chou En-lai:      48 years ago.  Very interesting.  I believe he is still
 well?  Your father-in-law? 'So you can now write
 him a postcard from Peking.
 Haig:             Yes, his' trip was 48 years ago.  Mr. Prime Minister,
 I thought what I would like to do is not belabor any of
 the special details that we have passed on in our
 messages but the Prime Minister will recall that we
 took a number of steps during that period.
 Chou En-lai:      Yes, I remember that you conveyed certain messages
 through a certain channel.
 Haig:             We believe and we have very strong confirmation that
 those steps were effective in convincing the Soviet
 Union to influence the Indians to accept a cease-fire
 rather than to proceed with attacks against West
 Pakistan -- in other words to stop short of what had
 been their goal against Pakistan.  One of those steps
 was Dr. Kissinger's reference to the possible can-
 cellation of the President's Moscow trip if the conflict
 continued.  Since the cease-fire has gone into effect,
 we have made a very careful assessment of the
 overall implications of recent events on the subcontinent
 and we have concluded that up until recently the Soviet
 policy on the subcontinent has been, in general, to
 keep the subcontinert divided.  This was manifested
 in their performance during the earlier conflict between
 India and Pakistan but we think they have decided on a

 rather precipitous shift in their policy to adopt one in
 which they would now seek to encircle the PRC with
 unfriendly states.  We believe that this modified
 Soviet strategy has evolved as a'result of recent
 events and has caused them to overhaul their former
 strategy for the subcontinent.  We also noted when
 the crisis developed. that the Soviets tried very hard
 to divert us from the course that would converge with
 the policy of the People's Republic.  In short, they
 sought to influence us to maintain a hands off policy.
 During the period when this crisis started to develop,
 they invited Dr. Kissinger to visit Moscow personally
 on several occasions as guest of Mr. Brezhnev.  They
 also offered to reach agreements with us in the
 accidental attack and provocative attack areas, all
 of which we rejected.  We rejected these approaches
 by the Soviet Union on two grounds -- one was on the
 grounds of principle.  We felt we had certain obliga-
 tions with respect to Pakistan and we felt we could
 not tolerate use of force to dismantle that country.
 But we also rejected the Soviet approaches because
 we felt that the future viability of the PRC was of the
 greatest interest to us and a matter of our own
 national interest.
 Again, speaking the blunt language of a soldier, I
 would not be so naive to infer that this is a pre-
 cipitous shift in our attitude which has suddenly
 developed after the years of differences which have
 divided us.  Rather, we have arrived at these con-
 clusions because we are convinced that the Soviet
 strategy is first to neutralize the People's Republic
 and then turn on us.  Therefore, our intersts are
 self interests.  I would want this clearly understood.
 Since the cease-fire has gone into effect between India
 and Pakistan, we have carefully assessed subsequent
 Soviet actions and we are convinced that they intend

 TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE/EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY
 to continue their efforts to encircle the' People's
 Republic.  We say this based on a number of factors.
 Included among those factors are their repeatedly
 announced support for the Bangladesh, and their
 offer to move advisers and assistance into East
 Pakistan, the recently announced visit of Soviet
 Foreign Minister Gromyko to Japan and, above all,
 their stepped up expressions of support for Hanoi
 in its conduct of the war, as well as increased
 Soviet materiel support for Hanoi.  In the context
 of what I have just said, I would also like to comment
 very briefly on the recent decision of the U. S.
 Government to launch a series of limited aerial
 attacks against North Vietnam.
 This was a decision that was taken only with the
 most careful thought and with the greatest reluctance.
 We believe that our policy with respect to the war in
 Southeast Asia is very clear at this point.  We have
 undertaken every reasonable step to bring the conflict
 to an early conclusion.  On the 11th of October, we
 transmitted to Hanoi the most forthcoming set of
 proposals for settlement of that conflict that we could
 conceivably develop, including the offer to have the
 current leader in Vietnam step down prior, to a post-
 settlement election.  In the face of these proposals,
 no one can doubt that we have any intention of main-
 taining our presence in South Vietnam.  We have told
 Hanoi, that we would withdraw and withdraw totally
 and they understand this.  Despite these proposals
 of October 11th, we have yet to receive any response
 from Hanoi nor have we even received from them
 an expressed willingness to discuss these proposals
 in Paris as we have offered to do.
 ?
 Instead, from Hanoi, we'have seen a step-up of
 attacks in Cambodia and Laos.  We have seen increased
 attacks against our unarmed reconnaissance aircraft
 over North Vietnam.  We have seen the continued de-
 velopment of Hanoi's supply route through the de-
 militarized zone and we have seen rocket attacks

 against-populated centers in South Vietnam.  We have
 seen increasing numbers of missile attacks from
 sanctuary in North Vietnam against our air forces
 in Laos.  These actions we could not but interpret
 as an effort by Hanoi to humiliate the United States --
 a humiliation that no great power can accept.                                     In this
 context, our retaliatory strikes were launched.  Also
 in this context, future U. S. air activity over North
 Vietnam will be directly related to Hanoi's future
 actions.  For our part, our strongest wish is to
 settle the conflict as quickly as possible and on terms,
 the fairness of which cannot be doubted.  On the other
 hand, we cannot subject ourselves to the kind of
 humiliation which Hanoi's actions seem designed to
 achieve.
 ?
 In the context of what I have just said, we have con-
 cluded that the continuation of the war in Southeast
 Asia can only give.Moscow an opportunity to increase
 its influence in Hanoi and to further the encirclement
 of the People's Republic.  We feel strongly that Moscow
 is urging Hanoi in the direction of continued military
 action and as such, they are forging another link in
 the chain which is designed to constrain the People's
 Republic.  In all of these circumstances, we also
 believe that President Nixon's visit takes on a new
 and immediate significance which transcends its earlier
 importance.  In the context of the events I have just
 described, i. e. , the immediate effect to the People's
 Republic and the revised Soviet strategy, the
 President's visit is not only one of long term historic
 significance -- the original motivation and the guiding
 force underlying the visit -- but now we see an
 immediate significance which must now be considered
 with respect to the President's visit.  In the light of
 our own strategic interests -= America's strategic
 interests which I described earlier -- we are con-
 vinced of and dedicated to the proposition that the
 viability of the People's Republic should be maintained.
 We have accepted this premise in full consideration of
 those things which divide us.  We recognize that these

 differences are both ideological and practical in
 nature.' On the other hand, just as Dr. Kissinger
 outlined to you earlier, Churchill was willing to
 cooperate with Stalin in order to cope with the
 greater danger of Hitler Germany.  We feel that the
 United States and the People's Republic must concert
 at this critical juncture.  We are prepared to use our
 resources as we did during the crisis between India
 and Pakistan to attempt to neutralize Soviet threats
 and to deter threats against the People's Republic.
 In sum, this is an overly generalized and soldier's
 blunt elucidation of Dr. Kissinger's and the President's
 views.  It suffers from brevity and hence the over-
 simplification which a more careful exposition would
 avoid.  We have considered some of the implications
 of this assessment and we have asked ourselves in the
 short to m what the United States could do within the
 context of this assessment to deal with some of the
 events which we think could occur in the future.  One
 of the steps we are prepared to do unilaterally and
 without any reciprocity on the part of the People's
 Republic -- is to provide you with our assessments
 of the Soviet threat which exists against the People's
 Republic to the degree that our own technical resources
 are able to do so.  I would emphasize that these would
 be steps taken without condition and without reciprocity
 and Dr. Kissinger has asked me to inform you that
 when he arrives with the President he would be ready
 to discuss the modalities of furnishing this information,
 perhaps through a third country or through whatever
 other means you might prefer.
 An additional implication of the assessment I have
 just provided is the fact that we have a major problem
 developing within the United States which your
 Ambassador to the United States, Ambassador Huang Hua
 can confirm, and Miss Tang has observed first hand
 also.  This is a strange merger of forces within the
 United States -- all dedicated to either preventing the
 President's visit to Peking or to contributing to its

 failure.  The forces which have converged are com-
 posed of first the American Left which is essentially
 pro-Soviet and if it is not truly dominated by Moscow
 in that sense of the word, it is at least strongly
 attracted toward Moscow and future U. S. alignment
 with Moscow.  In this instance, the Left has been
 joined in a strange wedding with those conservative
 elements who are strong supporters of Taiwan.
 A third area of difficulty for us in the United States
 is a degree of bureaucratic haggling concerning the
 wisdom of the initiative to visit Peking.
 All of these factors have converged in a way which
 poses a very serious threat to the success of the visit.
 In the short run, these forces would hope to prevent
 the visit at all    in the longer run, they would hope
 to prevent or deter the normalization of relations
 between the People's Republic and the United States.
 For this reason, President Nixon and Dr. Kissinger
 are all the more concerned about making President
 Nixon's visit a success not only in reality but also in
 the appearance of the visit itself.  Thus, we feel it
 must succeed in both fact and in appearance.
 Unfortunately, most American journalists are shallow
 idiots.  They draw their editorial line from the
 immediate atmospherics of the situation and from
 what is essentially the instantaneous reporting of a
 set of circumstances rather than from a careful analysis
 of the realities and implications of these realities.
 For" this reason, it is crucial that there be no public
 embarrassment to the President as a result of his
 visit to Peking.  It is in our mutual interest that the
 visit reenforce President Nixon's image as a world
 leader.  I have brought several journalistic efforts
 of recent weeks from some of our more important
 newspapers, such as the New York Times, which I
 would like to leave with the Prime Minister so that
 he can see how these forces have been working in

 the United States against both the normalization of
 relations and the President's visit.  In the light of
 these trends, we would hope that between now and
 Dr. Kissinger's visit that perhaps certain steps
 could be taken --! one might be some strengthening of
 the positive aspects of the Joint Communique which
 was worked out so satisfactorily during Dr. Kissinger's
 visit.  We are thinking along the lines of a possible
 reference to trade or something that would give an
 immediate sense of accomplishment as a result of the
 visit, such as increased scientific or cultural ex-
 changes.
 Finally, the most crucial issue in the Public Com-
 munique which would be released at the time of the
 President's visit is the unresolved issue of the status
 of Taiwan.  You will recall that Dr. Kissinger left
 without this language being agreed upon.  We have
 looked at this problem from two perspectives.  The
 first is what we will actually do about Taiwan in the
 future and second, is what we will say about Taiwan
 in conjunction with the President's visit. In order
 for us to be, very bluntly, anti-Soviet and pro-People's
 Republic, we must have the support of the American
 conservatives.  As I pointed out, this support is
 intimately linked today to the issue of Taiwan.  At
 this point, I would like to categorically reaffirm
 what Dr. Kissinger told you about our future policies
 towards Taiwan:
 First,, we will do nothing to encourage or support
 the movement towards an independent Taiwan.      Second,
 we will do nothing to encourage or to support
 Japanese efforts to manipulate the future of Taiwan
 either through the independence movement or a
 Japanese presence in Taiwan..
 And third, we will withdraw war-related U. S.
 forces from Taiwan as soon as the war has been

 concluded.  Also, over the longer period we will
 gradually reduce our presence there.
 In summary, the United States finds itself caught
 between the dilemma of a Left Wing which is dominated
 by forces friendly to the Soviet and by the Right Wing
 which is dominated by pro-Taiwan forces.  For this
 reason, and in the light of all the considerations I
 have mentioned tonight, we would urge you to reconsider
 very carefully the language in the Joint Communique
 that pertains to Taiwan and, hopefully, to agree to
 a formulation that is somewhat less truthful and some-
 what less precise than the language which Dr. Kissinger
 carried away with him during his last visit.  I have
 brought another version of the paragraphs pertaining
 to Taiwan which I would like very much to leave with
 you, on an ad referendum basis.  Perhaps when Dr.
 Kissinger arrives there can be further discussion
 on this subject.  In -the interim, Dr. Kissinger felt
 that you should have our assessment of what we con-
 sider to be the overriding strategic implications of
 Soviet actions and strategy.  We have made some
 very careful soundings since Dr. Kissinger's return
 and we know that the language that was considered
 during his visit would cause an uproar in the United
 States.  This, we feel, would only strengthen the
 very forces that are working against the visit itself
 and the implications of that visit for the future of
 both of our countries.
 That concludes the strategic assessment of the
 President's and Dr. Kissinger's or rather my inter-
 pretation of that assessment.  I must apologize for
 its bluntness but I felt that you would appreciate this
 kind of candor.  Candor was certainly the characteristic
 of Dr. Kissinger's discussions here and especially
 those with the Prime Minister.
 ?
 I do have several minor administrative matters to raise
 in this very restrictive form and in such a way that the

 rest of our party would not be privy to them.  With
 your approval, I will discuss them now.
 Chou En--lai:        Yes.  Go ahead.
 Haig:                First, Dr. Kissinger considers that it is essential
 that he attend all the meetings between the President
 and yourself and whatever meetings might occur be-
 tween the President and the Chairman.  That is the
 first item.
 Secondly, Dr. Kissinger again asked me to emphasize
 the essentiality of having concurrent meetings at the
 level of the Foreign Ministry and the Department of
 State which would occur whenever the President
 would meet with you and with the Chairman.  It might
 pose a challenge of some magnitude to have sufficient
 substantive topics to cover but we are confident that
 together we can accomplish that constructively.
 Next, I.would like to reiterate what I have given to
 your very hospitable representatives today and that
 is that the composition of our party is made up of
 many technicians.  Some of them are not governmental.
 They are all great advocates of their particular
 specialty.  They may, during their visit here, be the
 source of some abrasive demand or requirement which
 would run counter to our mutual best interests.  I
 want to emphasize if there are any demands of that
 kind that develop at the technical level you should not
 feel obliged to accept them but rather bring them to
 me so that no technical matter can be permitted to
 act as a source of irritation or detract from the success
 of this visit.
 Each of our representatives who has been to China
 before now has returned with the greatest respect
 and admiration for the hospitality and for the pro-
 fessionalism and skill of your representatives.  I am

 determined to keep that high level of cooperation and
 respect alive during this visit and I am prepared to
 take whatever steps you or your representatives might
 feel necessary to insure it.  Therefore, I would again
 urge that anything your side feels may be counter-
 productive is brought directly to my attention.
 One last very minor thing, Mr. Prime Minister, is
 that Dr. Kissinger was concerned because just
 before I left a female television personality called
 him and told him she was going to contact your
 Ambassador in New York and try to get him on her
 show and to use Dr. Kissinger's name to get him on
 the show.  Dr. Kissinger wanted you to know that he had not
 given approval for this and felt that this was totally
 a Chinese matter as to whether the Ambassador ap-
 pears or not.
 Chou En-lai:         We have not gotten mews of this yet.
 Haig:                The commentator is a Miss Nancy Dickerson
 Chou En-lai:         So she approached Ambassador Huang Hua about that?
 Haig:                If she has not already, she will probably do so soon
 and she may use Dr. Kissinger's name.
 I thank you for your rather clear notification. Of
 course, you have said you have not gone into great
 detail but we understand the general idea.  And, of
 course, we must report this to Chairman Mao Tse-tung
 and also must consult with other colleagues.  Therefore,
 I am not able to give an official reply. However, I
 would like to comment on what you have said.  The
 first thing is just as you mentioned that the coming
 together of our two countries would be beneficial to
 the promotion of the normalization of relations be-
 tween our two countries and also to the relaxation
 of tension in the Far East.  We believe this will not only
 be beneficial to the U. S. but also to the People's

 Republic of China and also to the peoples of our two
 countries and to the people in the Far East.
 The second point is that Soviet meddling in the South
 Asian subcontinent and in Indochina, in my opinion,
 is not due to a change in the strategic policies of the
 Soviet Union but rather a necessary consequence of
 reaction on the part of the Soviet Union toward the
 coming closer between China and the United States.
 And I mentioned this to Dr. Kissinger during his
 first visit to China -- that we were anticipating to
 shoulder, to bear the consequences of this coming
 together of U. S. and China and that we were prepared
 for this and we do not, therefore, find it to be un-
 expected.  For instance, the question of the sub-
 continent.  It was because the Sino-American Com-
 munique of July 15 -- the first announcement of
 July 15th, your time, was published that the Soviet-
 Indian Treaty, a so-called treaty which was actually
 a military alliance, came into being after having been
 delayed for two years.  It was finally signed in
 Delhi in August and it can be said that Pakistan did
 not deal with that very earnestly at that time.
 Of course, this is not something that either China or
 the United States could do for them as their friend.
 And, therefore, when later on in December, the
 situation had already become rather urgent, when
 we.heard of Dr. Kissinger's information about the
 policy as adopted by the United States, we considered
 that although it was rather late at that time already,
 we considered that that was the only possible policy
 that could be adopted at that time.  Of course, now,
 the question of the subcontinent has become compli-
 cated.  And we believe that it will continue to develop.
 And if the United States Government has any other
 new further opinion with regard to this situation, we
 are willing to hear it.  Because the obstruction of

 ?
 TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE/EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY               -13-
 India's advance toward West Pakistan is only a
 temporary phenomenon.  And with the development
 of the already complex situation on the subcontinent,
 will undergo still more changes.  And, therefore,
 in the interim period from now until the visit of
 your President to China, if the U. S. Government
 has any new information it would like to convey,
 we are willing to exchange opinions on the situation
 in the area.
 ?
 I would like to say also, very frankly, that our
 opinions differ from yours on Vietnam.  We believe
 that it was not necessary for the U. S. Government
 to bomb North Vietnam in such a way as President
 Nixon has never done since he has taken office, as
 he did around Christmas last year.  And, in addition,
 this action wa:i taken after President Nixon had
 withdrawn I believe around 400, 000 troops from
 South Vietnam, and, therefore, this action made it
 even more unacceptable to the people of the world,
 including the people of the United States and this
 was also reflected in the press of the United States.
 And this also occurred at precisely the time when
 President Nixon declared to the world around
 Christmas that he wished to move toward relaxation
 of tension and toward peace in the world.  And if we
 should say that Soviet forces in the Indian Ocean
 and in the South Asian subcontinent have increased,
 we should say that they were led into that area by
 India.  But if we should say that the Soviet Union
 was given an opportunity to increase its influence
 and its force in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam
 then we should say that it was assisted by the recent
 action of the United States.  Because as I remember,
 when Dr. Kissinger was here discussing things with
 us, he expressed particular admiration and apprecia-
 tion of the fifth point put forth by Madame Binh of the
 Republic of Vietnam.  The basic spirit of that clause
 was to change South Vietnam and Indochina into a non-
 allied area, i. e., an area which would maintain

 peaceful and friendly relations with all sides.  And
 this would be beneficial to the relaxation of tension
 in Southeast Asia.  It would also be beneficial to the
 improvement of relations between the United States
 and China.    However, now the U. S. bombing has
 increased the Soviet influence and tension in this
 area.  Of course, this is not of great consequence
 to us but it is quite bad for the local area.  It will
 make the situation in all of Southeast Asia tense and
 it will also be a matter of great concern to the people
 of the U. S. and the world and it will not be favorable
 toward the ending of the war in that area.
 Originally, we were waiting to convey these views
 to President Nixon and Dr. Kissinger when they
 come later on but since you have now mentioned these
 matters, we think this is also another opportunity to
 advance some of our opinions.  Of course, this is also
 just an initial exchange and I believe we will have
 another opportunity to exchange opinions.  And, of
 course, as you said, this exchange is limited to us
 two .
 And as for the third factor, we have taken into con-
 sideration the fact that you have certain internal problems
 which we see from the press and also Dr. Kissinger
 mentioned it during his previous visits and we have
 also felt the three forces which you mentioned.  I
 would also like to ask something very bluntly and to
 you as you are a military man.  Is it that the Pentagon
 also has differing opinions?
 ?
 Haig:              Some elements in the Pentagon have differing opinions
 but those who are the most responsible and strategic
 thinkers are in full agreement with this initiative and
 the visit of the President.
 Chou En-lai:       As for the two questions -- the two issues that Dr.
 Kissinger raised about the Joint Communique.

 The first is essentially a question of trade.  We under-
 stand this proposal and we can also see from American
 opinion that they are also attaching importance to this
 question and this is also an issue that carries weight.
 The second is the suggestion you have brought from
 Dr. Kissinger about the wording of the part about
 Taiwan.  In our opinion, the paragraph that we have
 written down -- I am not speaking about the part
 the Chinese says but the part that the U. S. side says.
 We believe that in the wording of that part we have
 fully taken into consideration the present dilemma
 that you just now mentioned between the United States
 Government and the forces you mention from the Left
 and the Right because this is a force of crucial sig-
 nificance to the United States but since you have
 brought a new opinion, we would be willing to take it
 into consideration, because as we have mentioned
 before we are always willing to get the work done as
 best as possible because you must work with a view
 toward the future.  And also Dr. Kissinger has already
 given some hints about this question to the press -- five
 points, isn't that so?
 t
 Haig:            Five points?
 Chou En-lai:     You have not seen them?  A Minister of Japan -- we
 found it in the Japanese press.  They were representatives
 of the Democratic Socialist Party -- the leader of that
 party.
 Haig:            He did talk to him.
 Chou En-lai:     And he announced these five points to the Japanese press.
 Haig:            I don't recall Dr. Kissinger using five points.
 Chou En-lai:     We have been trying to get a copy.
 Haig:            I will find out about that.  I did not sit in at the meeting.

 Chou En-lai:                           We will try to get a copy and give you an English
 translation.  Of course, it quoted Dr. Kissinger
 and these words came from the Japanese.  As for
 the specific questions you later mentioned (admini-
 strative questions), we don't think there is any
 question to that because we believe during his
 second visit Dr. Kissinger mentioned these points.
 I believe we can cooperate very well on them.  Of
 course, you can continue discussions with Acting
 Foreign Minister Fei, either directly or you can
 have separate group discussions with various other
 people.  Of course, we will not do anything to
 embarrass you and if anything comes up at lower
 levels, they will not be settled there.  They will be
 brought to you.
 As for your- plans for this present visit to China,
 there are two suggestions.  One was that you would
 spend a greater portion of your time in Peking and
 then- go to Shanghai and Hangchow for a visit.
 Another would be you would stay here for a short
 time -- then go to Shanghai and Hangchow and come
 back here.  In my personal opinion, it would be
 better to have all issues decided in Peking and then
 go to other places.  It would be economizing on the
 time.  But, of course, if you would like to wait for
 a reply from Washington before you would like to
 finalize certain details or if you have other political
 matters to discuss later on, then a return trip would
 be better.  Either question is entirely up to you to
 decide.
 Haig:              I think, at first glance, we would favor a longer time
 here and then the trip to the other two locations and
 depart from there.  I think we will know that better
 after we have had discussions of the schedule
 tomorrow morning at the plenary sessions, after
 which we could decide.  But I believe that this would
 be the best way to proceed.
 Chou En-lai:       I am sorry to have taken up too much of your sleep.

 please send my regards to him.

 personal cooperativeness that we are receiving at every level from
 your people.  I am somewhat embarrassed to find that some of our
 people, have come with all the answers and have not operated with as
 much efficiency as I would have preferred.  This has required
 additional patience and assistance from your side which has certainly
 not been lacking.

 FM Chi: I heard that they have had rather smooth and rather good
 discussions in the groups.
 Gen Haig: Everything has been superior in the exchange of views but
 I find that the network people have sometimes not performed as
 effectively as I would have liked.
 FM Chi.: They seem to be doing alright.
 Gen Haig: ? You are too kind.  I did have some other followup informa-
 tion to our meetings of early Tuesday morning with the Prime Minister.
 I immediately reported in great detail that morning to Dr. Kissinger
 the results of the discussions with the Prime Minister.  And he replied
 to me first that he received my report with no little nostalgia and he
 felt that in replying to my message that he wanted to again extend his
 personal greetings to each of you that had worked with him so
 cooperatively and in such a friendly spirit in October and July.
 FM Chi; We would also like to thank him.
 Gen Haig:  One of the first items I mentioned to the Prime Minister
 was our hope that we could strengthen the positive actions of the
 Draft Communique.  And when the Prime Minister replied to me he
 mentioned that this was primarily a problem of trade.  I wanted to
 reemphasize that we were thinking also of cultural and scientific
 exchanges between the two sides -- that we might wish to consider
 improved language with respect to these two items as well as trade.
 In line with this, when Dr. Kissinger and the President come in
 February, they will have some additional proposals for exchange in
 the cultural and scientific area, as well as some ideas for your
 consideration in the area of trade, recognizing that this must come
 very slowly and it is not the kind of thing we would anticipate
 immediate action on but maybe some words of future promise.  And
 we would welcome if between now and the visit you care to communicate
 further on this, perhaps in the Paris channel or, if you prefer, to
 wait until the party arrives and there could be some further discussion.
 Concerning the draft alternative language I left ad referendum with
 respect to the U. S. portion of the paragraph on Taiwan, we would

 welcome any additional views which your side might have before
 I return to the United States and we would be prepared to accept
 and consider any additional or alternate  language that you might
 care to give before I leave.  In any event, we would.anticipate that
 this subject would always be the result of direct exchanges here in
 Peking between you and myself while I am here or Dr. Kissinger and
 the President after they arrive.
 Now, also, during the meeting on Tuesday morning, the Prime
 Minister conveyed the thought that he would welcome any additional
 views we have on the subject of South Asia and the subcontinent
 before any meetings with President Nixon.  With your side's approval,
 we would like to send some additional views on this subject through
 the Paris channel between now and the 21st of February.  And for
 now, I would like to emphasize that our policies there will focus on
 efforts to buy time and to strengthen the defense capabilities of
 Pakistan.  We certainly share the Prime Minister's concern that
 that situation is far from settled and is still in a period of dynamism
 which will require the most careful watching and perhaps action on
 both our parts.  We have been using our influence just before and
 since the cease-fire to get Turkey and France to help in the arms
 situation in Pakistan.
 ?
 FM Chi: Turkey and France?
 Gen Haig: Yes.   Turkey and France and this was a topic discussed
 between Presidents Nixon and Pompidou in the Azores.  Concurrently,
 we are starting up our economic program for Pakistan at a greater
 level of assistance than heretofore.  Now, turning to the topic of
 Southeast Asia which was also discussed with the Prime Minister
 on Tuesday morning, Dr. Kissinger has asked me to reiterate our
 government's view that it is Moscow which is blocking the arrival
 at a peaceful negotiated settlement of the conflict.  He has asked
 me to recount in somewhat greater detail the sweeping proposals
 which we have made in search of a settlement of the conflict.  We
 had, as I stated earlier, a meeting scheduled for the 20th of
 November with representatives of Hanoi in Paris.      They cancelled
 that meeting and since that time, we have heard nothing from Hanoi.

 Vietnam, as Dr. Kissinger stated in October, is an anguishing
 problem for our government.  In this sense, it was not the
 Nixon Administration that got us into the conflict but he, of course,
 has the problem of terminating the conflict.
 Dr. Kissinger has also asked me to emphasize that when he met
 with Mr. Le Duc Tho in Paris in July, after the visit to Peking,
 he informed Mr. Le Duc Tho that the United States wished to end
 the war in Hanoi aLA not in Peking.  During the past year, we have
 done the following specific things with respect to the conflict:
 .         On May 31st of last year, Dr. Kissinger met with Minister
 Xuan Thuy and proposed seven U. S. points for ending the war.  One
 of these points was an offer on our part to set a deadline for our
 withdrawal.
 Then, on June 26th, Mr. Le Duc Tho came to Paris and met
 secretly with Dr. Kissinger.  At that time, Hanoi proposed nine points
 in reply to the seven points we had proposed in May.
 Then, on July 1st, Madame Binh published her  seven
 points and as Dr. Kissinger pointed out to the Prime Minister in
 October it was very odd procedure from our perspective to be
 given nine points secretly and seven points publicly.
 So, on July 12th, on his return from Peking, Dr. Kissinger
 met with Mr. Le Duc Tho in Paris, again secretly, and at this
 meeting we inquired of Mr. Le Duc Tho which we should deal with --
 the nine points or the seven points and Mr. Le Duc Tho said the nine
 points were more significant -- the ones we had gotten secretly.  In
 view of that response, it was very difficult for us to deal publicly with
 the seven points of Madame Binh when we were told that the more
 significant points were the nine secret points given by Mr. Le Duc Tho.
 Despite the confusion that came from these different views,
 on August 16th, we made a formal eight point proposal which constituted
 our reply to the secret nine points, as well as a reply to the seven points
 made publicly by Madame Binh.  In this reply in August, we actually

 went very far toward the seven and nine points of the other side
 and even included their specific language in our proposal on
 several of the key points.
 On September 13th, Dr. Kissinger again went to Paris
 secretly.  On this occasion, as on the preceding occasion in August,
 Mr. Le Duc Tho found it inconvenient to come from Hanoi to meet
 with Mr. Kissinger and, instead, he met with Mr. Xuan Thuy.
 Nevertheless, at this meeting, Mr. Xuan Thuy rejected two of the
 eight points Dr. Kissinger had forwarded in August.  As a result of
 this rejection, we then reformulated those two points and submitted
 eight new points on October 11.  Of those eight points, six are
 identical to those already accepted by Hanoi, and the other two
 points constituted reformulation of the points which Hanoi had
 rejected in September.
 .    We then requested a secret meeting on November 1.  As I
 pointed 'out earlier, since then we have had no substantive reply
 or exchange from Hanoi.  In our view, our proposal of October went
 as far as anyone could possibly go.  So, we were faced with intransigence
 not after we struck North Vietnam in December but well before.  Among
 the proposals we offered in October were the following:
 1.   A specific offer for a fixed date for the withdrawal of our
 forces.
 2.   The provisions for new elections six months after a peace
 treaty would be signed.
 3. A specific offer that all American troops would be withdrawn
 one month before this election.
 4. The specific offer that the President and the Vice President
 of Vietnam would resign one month before the election so that they
 would not run it.
 In addition to this proposal, the United States reiterated to Hanoi and
 reiterates here, our readiness to accept a post-settlement nonaligned

 Southeast Asia.  Specifically, what we visualized under our proposal
 would be the immediate signature of a statement of principles by
 both sides on which a settlement would be based.  We would then
 withdraw all American forces except a few thousand within seven
 months of the signing of these principles.  And we would do this even
 before the signature of a.final peace treaty.  There is also the
 provision for an all-around cease-fire and the resignation one month
 before the election of President Thieu and his Vice President.
 Therefore, in the broadest sense we feel we have replied positively
 to every demand that Hanoi has made that is reasonable and does not
 constitute a direct humiliation of the United States as a world power.
 It is this sequence of events which has led to the conclusion on our
 part that the war continues in Southeast Asia only for Soviet aims.
 Certainly, no Asian power or no patriotic Vietnamese element can
 fear our eventual domination.  It is interesting that just this week
 we have learned that New Delhi is going to upgrade its representation
 in Hanoi very soon.  And certainly this is an ominous further clarifica-
 tion of what Soviet aims must be along the southern flank of the People's
 Republic of China.  I will not elaborate further on this topic during my
 visit but I would hope that there could be some very frank exchange of
 views on some of the more recent indications of increased Soviet
 strategy of encirclement.
 Now, also during Tuesday morning's meeting, the Prime Minister
 raised the December 16, 1971 issue of the Japanese Weekly Shuhan
 Gendai, a copy of which was furnished to me yesterday (attached).
 This was an article allegedly written by the Director of Propaganda for
 the Democratic Socialist Party of Japan.  The article also allegedly
 portrayed the substance of a discussion between Mr. Kasuga and
 Dr. Kissinger in Washington.  As I confirmed on Tuesday morning
 to the Prime Minister, Dr. Kissinger had met with Mr. Kasuga in
 Washington.  However, that meeting lasted just 30 minutes, not two
 hours as the article indicates. During the meeting, Mr. Kasuga raised
 several questions associated with the President's visit here to Peking
 and persisted strongly in attempting to get some U. S. view on Taiwan
 from Dr. Kissinger. I have informed Dr. Kissinger of the contents of
 this article following the discussion Tuesday morning with the Prime
 Minister, and he has replied by providing me with a text of the precise
 minutes of his meeting with Mr. Kasuga.  Dr. Kissinger also has

 reiterated personally to me, in addition to providing me with the
 minutes, that he gave no reply to Mr. Kasuga with respect to the
 future status of Taiwan.  My personal review of the minutes of
 that meeting confirm categorically that Dr. Kissinger deflected all
 questions on the subject. Instead, he referred to his press conference
 which occurred on the Tuesday before the December 3rd meeting
 with Mr. Kasuga and offered to give him a copy of that press conference,
 with which I know you are familiar.  In commenting on the Japanese
 press article, Dr. Kissinger asked me to convey the following message
 to the Prime Minister.  In Dr. Kissinger's view, the only press which
 is less reliable than our own is that of the Japanese.  He also asked me
 to reiterate again what I stated on Tuesday morning to the Prime Minister
 and in somewhat more detail concerning our view on the future of Taiwan.
 Tuesday morning, I cited three specific policies of the United States with
 respect to Taiwan.  Dr. Kissinger has reformulated these assurances
 in terms of five specific poi-its.  First, the United States will withdraw
 Southeast Asian-related forces within a reasonable period after the
 end of the Indochina war.  Second, the United States will gradually
 withdraw the reminder of its forces as tensions ease.  Third, the
 United States will give no support to the return of the Japanese presence
 in Formosa or to the introduction of Japanese troops in that location.
 Fourth, the United States will make no further reference to the status
 of Formosa as being undetermined.  And, fifth, the United States
 will offer no encouragement to the so-called Taiwan independence
 movement.  This is the essence of the guidance I have received from
 Dr. Kissinger and I think completes the response to all of the untended
 issues which arose on Tuesday morning.
 FM Chi: First of all, I would like to thank General Haig for conveying
 Dr. Kissinger's message.  And I will convey it to Premier Chou En-lai.
 And if Premier Chou En-iai has any considerations of any other
 discussions or any other messages we will further inform you.  So,
 there is nothing further on our side.

 Gen Haig: I am just a little concerned about the networks portion.
 Everything else has gone beautifully and I think we are in very good
 shape.  There are some unsettled problems in terms of television
 coverage.  I am hoping it will, be resolved this morning.  If not,
 we may have to delay 24 hours.  I hope this does not occur because
 I know this is a terrible burden on you and I am very anxious for us
 to finish on schedule.
 FM Chi: I believe it may be solved very quickly.  I do not believe
 there is any great obstruction.
 Gen Haig: That group is commercially oriented.    This is business to
 them.  They are not conscious of the political details.  I would hope
 they would not attempt to play your side off against us.

 Chou En-lai:         We gave you too much wine today?  Our hosts did not
 know how to make conversation, so they just drowned
 you in wine.  I believe Mr. Chapin can down quite a
 few cups.  General Haig has quite a capacity.  It is
 alright -- you are quite young.
 This afternoon, Acting Foreign Minister Fei con-
 veyed to me the message from Dr. Kissinger that
 you conveyed to him.  I thank you for your informa-
 tion.  I already said, on the morning of the 4th, that
 after I reported to Chairman Mao Tse-tung I would
 discuss it with my colleagues and give you'a formal
 reply.  So I would like, first of all, to give a reply
 to the former message you gave on the morning of
 the 4th and then to deal with the latter message given
 this morning -- later on.
 We have studied the message conveyed by General
 Haig.   Your straightforwardness has helped us to
 attain a clearer understanding of the views of the

 U. S. side on the current situation and Sino-Soviet
 ways.  We would like to express our views in a
 similarly frank way.
 1.    The high level talks to be held between
 China and the United States to seek normalization
 of the relations between the two countries accord
 with the desire of the Chinese and American
 people and if positive results can be achieved
 they will also be conducive to the easing of tension
 in the Far East and in conformity with the interests
 of the people in Asia and the world.  As the time
 for the talks draws near, certain hostile forces
 have been intensifying their destruction and
 sabotage.  This is something within our expecta-
 tions and we are prepared for it.
 2.      After the announcement of President
 Nixon's visit to China, the Soviet Government
 hastily made concessions in Europe and came to
 agreement with the West on the Berlin question.
 While in Asia, it concluded with India a Treaty of
 peace,  friendship and cooperation in name but it
 was a military alliance in substance.  Following
 that, the Soviet Government took advantage of the
 situation to support India, to commit armed aggression
 against Pakistan and occupy East Pakistan.  This is a
 continuation, under new circumstances, of the con-
 sistent Soviet policy of contending for hegemony.
 There is no'shift of strategy to speak of.  China
 is under no commitment to Pakistan.      However,
 proceeding from its curretxt principal stand,
 China has rendered and will continue to render
 political support and also materiel assistance
 within our capacity to Pakistan in its struggle
 against division and aggression.  The Soviet Union
 has supported India to invade and occupy East
 Pakistan.  They appeared arrogant and unbridled
 for a time but in fact they have further opened their

 expansionist situation and, in fact, have become
 isolated from the entire world.  The development
 of events are proving that the subcontinent will be
 in continuous turmoil.  India and its supporter
 have the nooses around their own necks.  They will
 certainly suffer from the consequences of their own
 doing.
 3.    There exist fundamental differences
 between China and the U. S. on the question of
 Vietnam and Indochina.  After Christmas, the
 United States wantonly bombed the Democratic
 Republic of Vietnam.  This has shocked world
 opinion and aroused world opposition.  The self-
 justification made by the United States side is
 utterly untenable.  As victims of the war of ag-
 gression, the Vietnamese people have the right to
 take every necessary action in self defense.  China
 firmly supports their struggle.  If the United States
 truly has the desire to withdraw all its forces and
 end the war in Vietnam, there is no reason for
 them to refuse to accept the reasonable seven-
 point proposal put forward by the North Vietnamese
 side.  In fact, it is not Hanoi that is humiliating
 the United States but the United States that is in-
 sulting Hanoi.  By what logic may a big country
 willfully commit aggression against a small country
 while the self-defense by a small country be de-
 scribed as aggression?  This policy of the U. S.
 can in no way shape the firm resolve of the peoples
 of Vietnam and other Asian countries to fight and
 win.  On the contrary, it has created obstacles to
 the U. S. to the withdrawal of troops and to its
 efforts to obtain release of the POWs.  And has
 also brought an unfavorable element into the visit
 of the President of the United States to the People's
 Republic of China.
 4.     China is a big country but not yet a very
 strong one.   Economically, we are still very back-
 ward.  One half a year ago, President Nixon de-
 scribed China as one of the five great powers of the

 world but now in its message the United States side,
 all of a sudden, expresses doubt over China's
 viability, asserting that it wants to maintain China's
 independence and viability.  We are surprised at
 this.  We hold that no country should ever rely on
 external forces to maintain its independence and
 viability.  If it does so, it can only become a
 protectorate or a colony.  However small a country
 may be, so long as it fears no brute force and dares
 to struggle, it will be able always to stay on its own
 feet in the family of nations.  Vietnam is a vivid
 case in point.  Socialist New China was born and
 has grown up in continuous struggle against foreign
 oppression and aggression and will continue to live
 on and develop.  We have long stated that we are
 prepared to meet enemy invasions from all sides
 and fight to the very end - - not flinching from
 undertaking the greatest national sacrifice and make
 contribution to the human progress.  Facts have
 proved and will continue to prove that all schemes
 to isolate, encircle, contain and subvert China will
 only end up in ignominious defeat.
 5.     The relations between China and the
 United States have not been normal.  Nevertheless,
 the Chinese side will receive President Nixon with
 due protocol and courtesy and will make its efforts
 to seek positive results in the Sino-United States
 talks.  In its message, the United States side ex-
 pressed the wish that the image of the President
 as a world leader should be enhanced through the
 visit.  This we find it difficult to understand.  The
 image of a man depends on his own deeds and not
 on any other factors.  We do not believe that any
 world leader can bd self styled.
 6.     In its message, the United States side
 indicated that certain forces in the United States

 are opposed to the normalization of Sino-United States
 relations and the Sino-United States high level talks
 and asked the Chinese side to reconsider the
 language of the Draft Communique with regard to
 a certain portion on Taiwan.  Of course, we do
 not object to further consultations but we would
 like to point out that we have already done our best
 to take your difficulties into consideration in our
 draft.  As you know, the Chinese people feel very
 strongly about the Taiwan question.  If the United
 States side truly has the desire to improve Sino-
 United States relations, it should adopt a positive
 attitude of settling this issue which is the crucial
 question in Sino-United States relations.  If there
 is yielding to certain forces opposed to the normali-
 zation of Sino-United States relations and backing
 down from the former position, that will bring no
 benefit to China and the United States.
 So that is our comment to the oral message you
 conveyed on the morning of the 4th.  Of course, you
 mentioned some new matters this morning.  The first
 thing is that of trade and I remember very clearly
 that your Excellency conveyed in your message the
 wishes of President Nixon and Dr. Kissinger with
 regard to that matter.  And I said that we had noted
 the opinion of the United States side and we would
 consider putting it into the Joint Communique.
 There is no question that the relations between
 China and the United States have not been normalized
 and that the development of trade will be limited and
 slow.  However, we should look further to the
 future and the relations between China and the United
 States -- should proceed in a direction headed for
 normalization and the matter of trade should be
 viewed as a positive factor in this progress.  And
 since Dr. Kissinger has mentioned cultural and
 scientific exchanges, if he has any specific idea,

 No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-467-5-1-7
 TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE/EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY
 of course we would be willing to exchange opinion
 on these matters during the discussions.
 The second question is the matter of the South Asian
 subcontinent that you mentioned in the message you
 conveyed from Dr. Kissinger.  We appreciate the
 part of the message in which you mentioned that the
 United States side at present would wish to count
 on gaining time to enhance the self-defense of
 Pakistan and that the United States was willing
 to undertake an economic assistance towards
 Pakistan.  As for the other portions, they were a
 sort of explanation and as I have already answered
 them previously, I feel them to be redundant.  And
 as General Haig has in the early hours of the 4th
 very straightforwardly conveyed President Nixon's
 and Dr. Kis singe is message to us, I would like to
 request your Excellency to report the reply we have
 just given you in a similarly straightforward
 manner to President Nixon and Dr. Kissinger.
 Haig:                I am very grateful for the very detailed and very
 frank views which I will convey precisely as re-
 ceived to Dr. Kissinger and to the President.  As
 I pointed out at the time..I gave those views, they
 were views which were largely conveyed in my own
 language as I understood the general thrust of my
 instructions.  In several instances, I believe the
 simple language of a soldier might have been
 more blunt than it might have been.  I believe some
 of my words may have been misinterpreted.  I
 would also like to briefly discuss your reply from
 a personal point of view because I have not been
 able to discuss the matter personally with the
 President or Dr. Kissinger.
 First, with respect to the situation in Southeast
 Asia, I believe it is very helpful to exchange views

 TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE/EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY               -7-
 even though it appears we basically disagree on this
 subject.  From our perspective, and this is a
 problem I have been very very close to for the last
 three years, it is not United States forces that are
 in Laos or United States forces that are in Cambodia
 but North Vietnamese forces.  We have expressed
 our desire to withdraw our forces and we have made
 honorable conscientious proposals that would lead to
 that withdrawal and a settlement.  It is the other side
 that has not responded to these proposals.  I think
 I explained that we were told to pay attention to the
 nine points given to us secretly by Hanoi and that
 is the way we have proceeded, based on advice, from
 Hanoi's spokesman.  Even so, this is a topic that I
 think warrants more extensive exchange at the time
 of the President's visit. I do believe that in the
 long run our perception of the convergence of the
 interests of the United States and the People's
 Republic of China in the area of Southeast Asia is
 the ultimate truth.
 The second point is the terminology that I used
 concerning the viability and independence of the
 People's Republic of China.  Certainly, we would
 not presume to infer that we were assuming the
 role of the protector or the guarantor of China's
 viability.  On the other hand, we did want to make
 very clear, and perhaps I did it clumsily, that in our
 perspective China's viability and future health is of
 interest to the United States.  This is a matter of
 our own national interest in the context of the world
 situation as it has developed.
 The third point I would like to mention is the again
 unfortunate language which suggests that the
 imagery of the President Was an important item.
 This was meant only in the context of the prepara-
 tions we are making for the President's visit.  I

 TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE/EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY
 think it is important the : we do not afford our
 enemies an opportunity to attack the President either
 in terms of his motivation or his effectiveness during
 his visit.  The worst disservice I could do to
 President Nixon would be to suggest that his public
 image is a matter of concern to him or a matter
 which influences his decision on any given sub-
 stance.  Certainly, his performance in the inter-
 national arena thus far suggests that popularity
 has never been, nor will ever be, the criteria by
 which he makes his decisions.
 With respect to the issue of Taiwan, I immediately
 conveyed to Dr. Kissinger the reply that I received
 from you on Tuesday morning and he is, I think,
 very much aware of that reply.  He did provide
 this additional information today, primarily to
 answer the questions that came up Tuesday and
 not to elevate our discussions here to a dialogue
 that would go on continuously but, hopefully, to
 elaborate on those is:?iues which might have required
 clarification based on the discussion of Tuesday
 morning.
 On the three subjects that we discussed that our
 side hoped could be more positive in the com-
 munique, i. e. , trade, scientific and cultural
 matters, I am confident that Dr. Kissinger will
 come up with some very modest proposals because
 he realizes that that portion of the communique
 is balanced and very well worked out.  I do not
 expect any drastic revision to the communique in
 this respect and we recognize the issue of trade is
 a long term one.
 And finally, on the subject of the South Asian sub-
 continent, I think recent events have confirmed one
 thing to me from my humble perspective and that
 is that while forces are sometimes under way
 TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE/EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY
 No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-467-5-1-7
 No Objection to Declassification in Full 2010/07/23: LOC-HAK-467-5-1-7
 TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE/EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY
 that we would like to think our own good intentions
 may somehow control, the facts are sometimes
 quite to the contrary.  In South Asia, certainly the
 United States was slow in recognizing the dangers.
 I think it behooves both our sides to be equally
 cognizant of future dangers there and elsewhere
 and I would hope it would not be a question of
 looking back on a situation that had turned sour for
 the lack of timely action which might have prevented
 that.
 I again thank the Prime Minister for his very
 thoughtful treatment to me and my party while
 we have been here in Peking.  One thing has
 characterized any exchanges I have been involved
 in with your officials and that has been the degree
 of candor and frankness which is very encouraging
 to me.  I think both of us have had long standing
 positions on controversial issues on which we do not
 agree and would hope those will not be translated too
 readily into -- and to use your term --  empty
 canons of rhetoric" but rather to the kind of frank
 language that will minimize misunderstanding even
 though the disagreement might remain at the con-
 clusion of the discussion.
 Chou En-lai:         Your Excellency has just now commented a bit on
 our reply and I think I should also like to add a few
 words.  Of course, the reply I gave you just now
 in itself is a complete answer.  And what I am
 now adding, of course, is additional and it was led
 to by your comment.
 And on the question of Southeast Asia, our current
 opinion has been, to put it simply, that the United
 States is in the wrong.  This is not only the words
 of the Chinese but also of the other people in the
 world.  I have heard American friends themselves

 TOP SECRET/SENSITIVE/EXCLUSIVELY EYES ONLY
 speak of this.  And, in addition, this is not something
 that was created by President Nixon himself.  It was
 his predecessors.  And President Nixon has already
 decided to withdraw his troops.  And as I have said
 to Dr. Kissinger before, I would wish that the United
 States would withdraw completely as General DeGaulle
 did in Algeria and do it in one strike and cleanly,
 wholly, without any remainder and immediately.
 And to find various excuses to drag on in a messy
 way will only finally end up in losing the initiative.
 With a subjective wish for a glorious and honorable
 withdrawal while in reality there may not be such
 honorable and glorious withdrawal and if you only
 have the subjective wish but reality is not a glorious
 and honorable withdrawal, then on the contrary, this
 might give rise to difficult predicaments that are
 difficult to extract ones self from.  Have you read
 the Soviet News?  That is upon your present visit
 to China, the Soviet press has done some reporting
 in which they have given some special descriptions
 of you as saying that you are especially in charge
 of Vietnamese and Indochina Affairs.    Of course, we
 do not pay attention to that.  It is precisely because
 you may be in charge of this that I would like to
 speak to you with special earnestness.  That is that
 your excuses will not carry over with the people of
 the world.  For instance, you said that it was not
 the United States troops that went first into Laos
 and Cambodia but North Vietnamese troops.  The
 question is that your troops should not have gone to
 Vietnam in the first place.  The sending of United
 States troops into Vietnam itself is aggression.
 For instance, we have a common point in opposing
 the sending of Indian troops into East Pakistan.
 Then, how can we agree to your sending troops into
 South Vietnam,  That is why the Soviet Ambassador
 criticized you on the issue of Vietnam when the
 question of the war in Pakistan was under debate
 in the United Nations.  That is the first point.

 The second point is -- take Laos for instance -- the
 troops of Thailand went into Laos.  That is also
 foreign aggression.  And your CIA has given often
 air support to the Laotian bandits in the form of
 ammunition or money or food.  They have given
 this to the Lao bandits of the minority Nationality,
 the forces of Vang Pao in the area that is under the
 control of Laos and this is something that is
 recognized in the American press.  Then, since the
 United States and Thailand can give air support to
 bandits in Laos, then why can Vietnam not give
 patriotic assistance to the forces of liberation?  For
 instance, it is the same as the situation in which you
 assisted South Korea and advanced your forces up to
 the very banks of the Yellow River.  It was only then
 that we sent our volunteers to assist the Democratic
 Republic of Korea and when we now cooly assess that
 situation -- was that not very clear?  And the case
 is similar in Cambodia.  If the Lon Nol - Matak
 clique had not subverted Sihanouk, then how would the
 war in Cambodia have come about?
 Later on, your President himself decided to send
 troops on an intrusion into Cambodia.  That was at
 the end of April 1970 and later on in the early part
 of 1971, United States troops entered into Laos and
 this was even further aggression and at Christmas
 last year, you launched a massive air strike against
 North Vietnam.  Your President and your Pentagon
 have called those successes but, in my opinion, they
 are not successes.  You are a soldier and I also have
 been one in the past -- not now of course.  I have
 also been in military action and I know that this kind
 of fighting cannot bring victory.  It can only give rise
 to dissatisfaction on the part of ones own people.
 And these actions on the contrary are giving the
 Soviet Union an opportunity.  And if you want some
 news, I can tell you a bit that if you do not leave
 that place, then Southeast Asia which does have the
 possibility of being turned into an area of nonalignment

 will become an area of contention between the two
 superpowers.  We are very clear about that. And
 then Europe, the Mediterranean, the Middle East,
 the subcontinent, the Indian Ocean, Southeast Asia
 will be linked together and how can tension be
 relaxed and wouldn't that be completely contrary to
 the ideals of your President.  On the morning of
 the 4th, you told us of the strategic thinking of the
 President.  And you once again rnertioned that your
 President wished to relax the tension but if things go
 on like that, then the situation that will appear will
 be completely contrary to those subjective wishes.
 And the result will be that the situation will continue
 in continuous turmoil not only in the subcontinent.
 Of course, the settlement of the Vietnam question
 will be reached between the United States and the
 DRV, either in Paris or Hanoi or perhaps in other
 places.  Of course, we, as the third party, cannot
 meddle in this but we must state clearly our stand
 and there must be no ambiguity about that.  I have
 dealt in rather great detail on this question in the
 hope that you will convey this to President Nixon
 and Dr. Kissinger.  This itself, in fact, constitutes
 an initial exchange of opinion.  Of course, it is
 probably too long to send in your cables so you can
 talk about them when you get back and Mrs. Hartley
 will be tired working on them until tomorrow morning.
 ?
 As for the other two questions, there is no need to
 pay too great attention to the wordings and terminology.
 We would like you to know that although our country
 is backward, we have our independence.  In our
 country, we have relied on our own initiative and
 self-reliance and have relied on these to fight until
 today.  We have our self-dignity and so have you and
 if we mutually respect each other that is equality.
 So the erroneous terminology that you just now
 mentioned is not" only a matter of terminology but a
 matter of attitude.  We are not a superpower and we
 refuse to be a superpower.  Your President has
 mentioned that China is a potential strength power.
 There is a degree of reason in that.

 The third point you mentioned was the image of
 your President and our reply would be as we have
 mentioned in the third point of our reply - - that the
 image of a man depends on his own deeds.  And
 since we have invited your President to China, we
 will certainly give him the protocol and courtesy
 due him.  I don't think there is any question of this
 and do not believe we have to say more about this
 because I believe you will understand this through
 the technical discussions we have had.  Of course,
 it is impossible to go beyond that because we have
 not established diplomatic relations and you still
 recognize Taiwan.  You must not forget that.  It
 is important to us. The good thing about it is that
 Chiang Kai-shek also only recognizes one China.
 He also says Taiwan is a Province of China.  It is
 a good thing because Taiwan would have long ago
 become a puppet of yours and become another Thieu
 or Sigmund Rhee and if such a situation had occurred
 wouldn't that make it even more impossible for us
 to come together and that would bring even more
 difficulty in the normalization of relations.  So now,
 we have come to the question of Taiwan.  So as to
 the question of Taiwan, I have already dealt with it
 in the official answer to you and if there is further
 discussion -- if there is still room for individual
 changes in that part -- then they should await the
 arrival of President Nixon or Dr. Kissinger.  As
 for the present, we believe that in our draft we have
 already given very great consideration to your
 difficulties.  As for other specific wordings and
 various measures, just as I mentioned about trade,
 cultural and scientific matters, they are rather minor
 matters and can wait until the arrival of your
 President.     And my secretary has just now called
 my attention to the fact that you mentioned the fact
 to pay attention to the danger developing in the sub-
 continent and you mentioned in the past you had been
 late in recognizing the danger there.  You just now
 mentioned that in the past you had come to the
 realization of this danger too late to avoid danger.

 As to that question, I have already answered on the
 morning of the 4th and we have identical views.
 Hai                    I am very grateful for this lengthy discussion. It is
 presumptious of me to speak for President Nixon or
 Dr. Kissinger.  I think on the subject of Southeast
 Asia there will be many useful exchanges during the
 President's visit.  The past history you referred to
 should be a source of wisdom and learning.  It does
 not necessarily provide the answers to current
 situations.
 Chou En-lai:          Of course, this answer must be given by your President.
 I cannot do that for him.  For instance, in the instance
 of the Korean War.  We entered into the war against
 aggression.  During that time, the President was
 Truman who was a Democrat and not a Republican.
 He still put forth the suggestion of negotiation, so
 actually they fought one year without negotiations but
 later on, with your Republican President Eisenhower,
 he ended the war in Korea.  I think it is useful to
 recall that part of history but the situation in Korea
 was different from that in Vietnam so it would not
 do to dogmatically copy that.  The war that began in
 Vietnam has brought the whole of Indochina together,
 has merged it into one but we have not entered that
 war so the situation is different.  And only with
 determination and resolve can that situation be settled.
 Otherwise, you will only lose the initiative.
 Hai :
 I think we are convinced that it is going to 'take bold
 action and I think we have taken it by offering sweeping
 proposals.  It is somewhat of a puzzle that we have
 not received a response to those proposals.  Perhaps
 that is where the trouble lies.  That is why alternative
 means must be pursued.
 Chou En-lai:           That is a question that I cannot answer because the war
 in Indochina is different from the war in Korea.  In the
 case of Korea, on our side the Democratic people of
