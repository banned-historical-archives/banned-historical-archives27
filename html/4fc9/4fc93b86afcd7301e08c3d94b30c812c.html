DAILY BRIEF 
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
*Communist China - USSR: 
Khrushchev is reported to 
have attacked Mao Tse-tung, comparing him to Stalin as one 
who formulates theories without coming into contact with 
events in the modern world. The Chinese delegate countered 
by calling Khrushchev a "revisionist" who is creating illusions 
about imperialism and underestimating its real nature. 
Peiping also reportedly refused to accept 
Soviet missile bases in China unless they were under Chinese 
control. (Page 1) 
II. ASIA-AFRICA 
Laos: Premier-designate Souvanna Phouma is expected 
to form a broadly based coalition government which will prob-
ably include some members of the ousted Somsanith govern-
ment. Souvanna is reported to have told the Indian ambassador 
that the new cabinet will not contain any military figures, and 
that the Ministry of Defense will be returned to civilian con-
troL Souvanna will probably exercise close personal supervi-
sion over foreign affairs and defense matters, in line with his 
often-expressed view that if the situation in Laos is to be sta-
bilized, a neutral policy and the reduction of the army's role in 
Internal affairs are necessary. 
Somsanith and most of the Luang Prabang contingent of his 
ousted government are in Vientiane, where they are probably 
participating in thtxonsultations looking to the formation of a 
new government. j.Qiie exception is ex-Foreign Minister Itham-
pha.n Panya, who reportedly has gone to southern Laos to join 
General Phoumi. The latter is not known to have abandoned 
his plans to force a return to the status quo ante 
Meanwhile, the Kong Le group gives little sign as yet of re-
laxing its military grip on Vientiane and may attempt to hold on 
until a government to its satisfaction receives assembly approval.

Congo: Eew moves planned by Lumumba to bolster his in-
ternal position have art authoritarian character. These report-
edly will include the suspension of judicial procedures in favor 
of trial by military tribunal and passage of a law requiring that 
licerises for newspapers and periodicals be renewed every two 
Apfhs'A major internal crisis for Lumumba appears to have 
en averted by postponement of the Abako party's convention 
cheduled for 13 August, at which the Abako had been expected 
to declare the lower Congo region independent of the Lumumba 
government. Lumumba also may avoid an early showdown con-
cerning the political status of Katanga in the expectation that a 
scheduled meeting of independent African states in Leopoldville 
from 25 to 30 August will take a strong stand in favor of a uni-
fied Congo. 
e,UN Secretary General Hammarskjold on 15 August summoned 
a new meeting of the Security Council following Lurnumba's charge 
that the Congo had "lost confidence" in Hammarskjold. In an ef-
fort to retain the propaganda initiative, Lumumba also called for 
the dispatch of a 14-nation UN commission to oversee the with-
drawal of Belgian troop, (Page 4) 
UAR-USSR: A Syrian delegation is scheduled to leave for 
the USSR within the next few days to sign contracts for several 
major development projects under the $150,000,000 line of credit 
extended by Moscow in 1957. Reportedly included is Soviet con-
struction of a high darn on the Euphrates River. Soviet activities 
in Syria on this and other projects have so far been largely lim-
ited to preparatory surveys, although the satellite countries have 
carried out some smaller projects. Conclusion of this new series 
of construction contracts is in line with Moscow's current efforts 
to re-establish close political ties with the UAR. 
(Page 5) 
Thailand: Vihal Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman is giving 
e impression that a trend toward neutralism in Thailand is in-
vitable. In a recent conversation with the Chinese ambassador

aggressive intentions and may link  the Pakistani incursion with 
US military support for Pakistan.  (Page 7)

to Esso Export's 9 August cut in posted prices for Middle East 
crude oil of 4 to 14 cents per barrel. Although other companies

Petroleum Company have already cut prices of oil products. 
Further, cuts in crude prices appear certain. The Kuwaiti Gov-

III. THE WEST 
Cuba: The eighth national congress of the Popular Socialist 
(Communist) party of Cuba opens on 16 August with the attend-
ance of relatively high party officials from France, Italy, and 
most countries of the Sino-Soviet bloc. The congress, the first 6 
since 1952, was apparently scheduled to coincide with the OAS 
foreign ministers' meetings in Costa Rica this week and is likely 
to be a demonstration of international Communist solidarity with 
the Castro regime in its "struggle against American imperialism."

*South Korea: Kim To-yun, who has been nominated by newly 
elected President Yun for prime minister of South Korea, probably 
will need the support of independents and former Rhee elements to

of the majority Democratic party, is strongly opposed by Chang 
Myon, titular party chief who controls approximately half the Dem-
ocratic members of the House of Representatives. Exclusion of 
Chang's supporters from the new cabinet would widen the intraparty 
breach and could lead to government instability.

azt-ra, 
New reports continue to indicate that a residue of bitterness 
between Moscow and Peiping has been left over from the Bucharest 
congress in June. 
IChrushchev attacked Mao personally at a closed session, 
comparing him to Stalin and alleging that the Chinese leader had no 
idea of the present international situation. The Chinese delegate, 
retorting angrily that Khrushchev was a "revisionist," declared, 
"We have no trust in your analysis of the world situation." Khru-
shchev is said to have termed the breach between the two countries 
extremely serious. 
An 82-page document circulated by the Russians at the congress 
presented a detailed criticism of Chinese actions and declarations. 
It charged that the Chinese underestimated the dangers of local wars 
and that their hostile policy toward India had provoked anti-Commu-
nist,reaction throughout Southeast Asia. The document scored Pei-
ping for refusing to join in common defense proposals for the estab-
lishment of missile bases and radar detection units in China, for op-
posing Moscow's gradualist strategy in underdeveloped countries like 
India, Indonesia, and Egypt, andforbringing criticism of the Soviet 
party into the open. 
Since the Bucharest congress, which was followed by a Soviet 
party plenum that condemned "left-wing sectarianism" and "narrow 
nationalism;' Moscow has taken the ideological initiative against 
Peiping. A long Pravda article of 7 August accused "leftist phrase 
mongers" of departing "absolutely" from Marxism in their eagerness 
to advance world revolution by means of war. Izvestia has termed 
Peiping's interpretation of Lenin a "blasphemy" and called other 
points of the Chinese position "absolutely absurd." 
The Chinese, comparatively taciturn since the congress, re-
plied to the Soviet charges in a 13 August People's  Daily editorial. 
It asserted that "modern revisionists" were spreading calumny and 
slander against China and were "apologists for imperialism." The 
failure of the Chinese to attend the Orientalist congress currently 
meeting in Moscow may reflect Peiping's rancor. 
The Russian-language magazine of the Sino-Soviet Friendship 
Society has apparently suspended publication. According to the Yugo-
slav press, a mass exodus of Soviet specialists from China is under 
way, but this report is unconfirmed.

Situation in Laos 
Laotian Premier-designate Souvanna Phouma will probably 
try to form a broadly. based "national unity" government which 
may range from such left-wing neutralist figures as Bong Souva,n-
navong and Santiphab party leader Quinim Pholsena to some mem-
bers of the ousted Somsanith government. Souvanna is likely to 
draw heavily on his own party--the Rally of the Lao People (RLP)--
as a roughly representative middle ground between left-wing ele= 
ments and the strongly anti-Communist Committee for Defense of 
National Interests (CDNI). The CDNI, with its strong influence in 
the army. through General Phoumi, may go into a period of eclipse_ 
the new cabinet will not include any military figures and that the 
Ministry of Defense itself will be placed under civilian control. 
The defense portfolio in the two previous governments had been 
held by Generals Sounthone and Phoumi, respectively, both of 
whom were CDNI leaders. In addition, ex-Premier. Somsanith 
has stated, presumably on the basis of the exchanges which led 
to his resignation, that one of the first acts of the new government 
will be the reorganization of the general staff. Souvanna has long 
felt that the army was playing a disproportionate role in the cen-
tral government's efforts to stabilize the countryside, and he can 
be expected to exercise close policy guidance over defense mat-
ters. He will also undoubtedly devote much attention to foreign 
affairs, in line with his view, that strict neutrality is the only feas-
ible policy for Laos;) 
omsanith and most of the Luang Prabang contingent of his 
ousted government now are in Vientiane and are presumably par-
ticipating in the consultations looking to the formation of the new 
government. One exception is ex-Foreign Minister Khamphan Pan-
ya, who reportedly is joining General Phoumi in southern Laos 
and who, along with Phoumi, has probably been a major target of 
the forces supporting the Vientiane ,coup.. Phoumi, meanwhile, 
has indicated no abandonment of his plans to undo the coup by mil-
itary force. 
The Kong Le coup group gives little sign as yet of relaxing its 
military grip on Vientiane despite the fact that its immediate aims

The Situation in the Congo  
Postponement by the Abako party of a convention originally 
scheduled for 13-16 August appears to have averted a major inter-
nal crisis for Congolese Premier Lumumba, The Abako on 7 Au-
gust had passed a resolution of no confidence in the Lumumba 
government, and the convention reportedly was to have been the 
occasion for the Abako to declare the lower Congo region independ-
ent of the central government. Although the reason for the post-
ponement is unclear, it may have resulted from pressure by Lu-
mumba on Abako leader and Congo President Joseph Kasavubu. 
With Kasavubu seemingly unwilling to oppose Lumumba, the 
focal point for anti-Lumumba activity may once again become the 
Congo Senate, whose moderate president, Joseph Ileo, has become 
Increasingly critical of the premier. The Senate, which has been in 
adjournment since 22 July, is scheduled to reconvene on 16 August. 
he Lumumba government continues to implement measures 
designed to suppress internal opposition. These include the sus-
pension of judicial procedures in favor of trial by military tribu-
nals and passage of a law requiring that licenses for newspapers 
and periodicals be renewed every two months. Congolese officials 
earlier, had closed down the facilities of the Belgian and French 
news agencies in Leopoldville3 
Lumumba may avoid an early showdown concerning the polit-
ical status of Katanga in anticipation that a scheduled meeting of 
independent African states in Leopoldville from 25 to 30 August 
will take a strong stand in favor of a unified Congo. 
Secretary General Hammarskjold on 15 August summoned 
a new Security Council meeting--expected to be held Wednesday or 
Thursday--following Lumumbais charges earlier in the day that the 
Congo had "lost confidence" in Hammarskjold. In an effort to retain 
the propaganda initiative, Lumumba also called for the dispatch of a 
14-nation UN commission--Ghana, Guinea, Tunisia, Morocco, Ethi-
opia, the UAR, Sudan, Ceylon, Liberia, Mali, Burma, India, Af-
ghanistan, and Lebanon�to oversee the withdrawal of Belgian troops1

Contracts. With the USSR for Major Development Projects. in Syria  
Moscow is moving to implement its $150,000,000 economic aid 
agreement signed in 1957 with Syria. The USSR has agreed to pro-
ceed with work on a Euphrates River high dam and other major de-
velopment projects.  during nego-
tiations held this spring in Damascus, Soviet negotiators hesitated 
to make a commitment on the dam project, claiming it was first 
necessary for the UAR and Iraq to reach an understanding on the 
division of the river's waters. At that time, Moscow also was nego= 
tiating with Baghdad concerning the construction of a dam on the 
Euphrates, for which Soviet technicians currently are conducting 
preliminary studies. 
Under the line of credit to the Syrian region, the Soviet Union 
probably will construct a railroad from Aleppo to Qamishliye, in 
northeastern Syria. the 
USSR may also build railroads connecting Latakia with Homs and 
possibly Aleppo. 
In addition, Moscow apparently will undertake the second stage 
of its geophysical surveys, calling for oil and mineral exploration 
in northeastern Syria. Soviet technicians completed the initial sur-
veys under this project earlier, spending almost a year preparing 
a detailed map of the region based on aerial photographs taken by 
Soviet aircraft. 
Although Soviet economic aid activity in Syria has been largely 
limited to surveys, the European satellites have constructed a num-
ber of small enterprises, including a Czech oil refinery at Horns in 
1959 which Prague has since agreed to expand. 
Conclusion of new contracts for major developmental projects 
� in Syria, where economic conditions remain critical, follows a se-
ries of other recent Soviet moves aimed at re-establishing close 
political ties with the UAR.

Thai Foreign Minister Foresees Neutralist Southeast Asia  
i-Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman is giving the impression 
that he accepts as inevitable a trend toward neutralism in Thai-
land. In a recent conversation with the Chinese ambassador to 
Bangkok, Thanat argued that American aid policies in Southeast 
Asia, and particularly Cambodia, were making neutralism in= 
creasingly attractive. Under present circumstances, neutrals 
could ask and obtain aid from both Communist and non-Commu-
nist sources, whereas allies of the United States, cut off from 
bloc aid, were taken for granted and required to make "heavy 
sacrifices,"; 
�.Thanat's discussion is additional evidence of Thailand's grow-
ing dissatisfaction and concern over its relations with the United 
States. Most recently the Thai Government has voiced fear that the 
United States would yield to Cambodian leader Sihanouk's "black-
mail" requests for increased arms aid. Bangkok has warned that 
such a move by Washington would force Thailand to reconsider its 
foreign policy. In May, when the United States announced it would 
provide India with 1,000,000 tons of rice and 16,000,000 tons of 
wheat under a four-year PL-480 sales agreement, Thanat was so 
incensed that he threatened to boycott the 1960 SEATO foreign min-
isters' meeting in Washingtocj 
hanat argues that the Laotian situation is an indication of South-
east Asian neutralist trends and that, unless American aid policies 
are changed to favor allies over neutrals, the whole Southeast 
region may ultimately adopt a "Sihanouk type" of neutralism.

Pakistani Fighters Forced Down Inside Afghanistan 
Afghan-Pakistani tensions presumably will increase sharply 
following the forcing down of two Pakistani "Fury" fighters in-
side Afghan territory. The two British-made piston aircraft 
probably were overflying Puishtoon tribal areas inside the Afghan 
border when intercepted by Afghan MIG-17 jet fighters and were 
then forced to proceed to Kandahar. The Afghan Government 
has stated that the planes had taken off from Miram Shah air-
field, in the Pakistani frontier region south of Peshawar, 
Kabul and probably Moscow are likely to exploit the inci-
dent as "proof" of Pakistan's aggressive intentions and may link 
it with US military support for Pakistan. The Afghans have been 
emphasizing since May that the U-2 had taken off from Peshawar 
on its 1 May flight, attacking this as evidence of "imperialist' 
support for Pakistan's "oppression of occupied Pushtoonistan." 
They now may try to draw comparisons between the two inci-
dents. Kabul's propaganda will probably reach a high pitch 
while Afghanistan's tribal chiefs are gathered in the capital for 
the national independence celebrations in late August. 
Afghan Prime Minister Daud may privately welcome the 
incident as demonstrating Afghanistan's improved defensive 
capability resulting from his policy of accepting Soviet military 
assistance. Pakistan, on the other hand, now may feel obliged 
to find a way of demonstrating that it remains a stronger military 
power than Afghanistan.

Cuban Communist Party Congress to Be Attended by Strong 
Delegations from Abroad 
The eighth national congress of the Popular Socialist (Com-
munist) party of Cuba opens on 16 August. The congress, the 
first since 1952, had been set for last month and was rescheduled 
only recently, suggesting that it was timed to coincide with the 
OAS foreign ministers' meetings in Costa Rica this week. The 
congress is likely to be used as a demonstration of international 
Communist solidarity with the Castro regime in its "struggle 
against American imperialism. " Attendance of Communists from 
the Sino-Soviet bloc at the Cuban Communist meeting is likely to 
encourage the apparent willingness of most American governments 
to condemn "extracontinental intervention" in the affairs of the 
western hemisphere. 
Most of the Sino-Soviet bloc countries will be represented by 
relatively high-level delegations. The USSR, Communist China, 
Poland, East Germany, Bulgaria, Hungary, and North Korea are 
sending central committee members, journalists, and persons 
skilled in agitation and propaganda techniques. Rumors that the 
bloc delegations would include top party officials have not been 
borne out as yet. Paul Verner, candidate member of the East Ger-
an politburo, is the highest rsaing bloc party official known to 
have arrived for the meeting. Emikhail Suslov, secretary of the 
Soviet party central committee, reportedly was to attend, but the 
Cubans have been advised that it will be inconvenient for him to 
do so,IJacques Duclos, second-ranking official of the French party, 
and Vaio Spano, a member of the Italian Communist party central 
committee, arrived in Havana on 13 August. 
The foreign Communist delegations undoubtedly will use this 
opportunity to strengthen the Communist position in Cuba with the 
aim of using that country as a base for further penetration in Latin 
America.
