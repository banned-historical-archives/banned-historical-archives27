 Chen Hsi-lien:   A Study in Compromise
 F_             I
 Of all the decisions ratified by the National
 People's Congress in January, perhaps the most
 glaring anomaly was the appointment of Chen
 Hsi-lien, commander of the important Peking Military
 Region, as a vice premier in the government. Chen
 is the only military man among the 12 vice premiers,
 and while he is not the only military man in the
 national government--several government ministers
 have predominantly military backgrounds--he is the
 only man in the government with troops under his
 command.
 Chen's appointment was no mere gesture of
 conciliation to the military. He was not just given
 a government title without real responsibilities.
 Thus far, at least? he has played a very active
 role. In mid-February he was named chairman of
 China's national games, a major sporting event that
 will not take place until September. This job has
 traditionally gone to military men, but Chen has
 carried out other assignments as well. He led
 China's delegation to Nepal for the King's coro-
 natson,'.met separately.with the King, and during
 his travels he apparently delivered a message from
 Peking regarding amino-Indian relations
 /believes
 Z en also supervises the machine-building ministries,
 which are concerned mainly with the production of
 military goods.
 The attention accorded to Chen contrasts
 sharply with.the shaky political status of most ,f
 China's other regional military commanders. All
 of them, including Chen, came under varying degrees
 of attack during the anti-Confucius campaign last
 year. None of the eight commanders involved in the

 mi. itary rotation of December 1973 has been given
 a oivilian job in his new location. Of the three
 must powerful regional military commanders--those
 who sit on the party's ruling Politburo--Chen has
 d:ne the best by far. Shenyang regional commander
 1.:i Te-sheng was demoted from party vice chairman
 :o ordinary member of the Politburo %nd lost his
 job in the national military hierarchy. Canton
 regional commander Hsu Shih-yu has neither gained
 nor lost.   He came under heavy attack in wall post-
 ers late last year, however, with no apparent effort
 from Peking to halt the attacks, as had been done
 earlier ;.n the year. Hsu has not appeared publicly
 since the National People's Congress and has missed
 several important leadership turnouts in Canton.
 On the face of it, Chen seems an unlikely
 candidate to prosper as a result of the National
 People's Congress, which endorsed the moderate
 policies of Chou En-lai. In July 1973, Chen
 crossed swords with the moderates over the use of
 university entrance examinations, and appeared to
 best Chou in the subsequent confrontation.   At that
 time, Chen was probably less concerned with exams
 than with the party's plans regarding the political
 status of the military on the eve of the party con-
 gress; he may even have feared he was going to lose
 his Politburo post. During the military rotation a
 few months later, Chen was brought to Peking and
 rumors immediately began to fly that he was in line
 for the job of defense minister or army chief of
 staff. In any event, Chen got neither position,
 Late last year, propaganda attacks on an
 historical figure by the name of Chen Hsi seemed
 aimed directly at Chen Hsi-lien. Chen Hsi was in
 charge of China's northern border area--as was
 Chen Hsi-lien for many years--and was accused of
 collaborating with China's northern. enemies, an
 obvious reference to the Soviet Union. These were
 serious charges, but Chen has managed to survive
 them.

 Chen's appointment as vice premier appears
 to be an artful compromise between those who
 perhaps wanted to exclude him from the central
 government apparatus entirely, or even purge hiii,
 and those who may have wanted him to become
 defense minister or army chief of staff. Chen
 himself has made it clear that he is anxious to
 retain some civilian duties, and as the man in
 charge of the troops in Peking, he is an important
 man to keep happy.
 Despite.his radical. stand on university
 entrance exams in 1973, Chen probably is not
 wedded to radical domestic policies in general.
 Where he may differ sharply with the civilian
 leadership is over the issue of defense spending.
 Chen conceivably could argue for a larger piece of
 the budgetary pie for the military, but there is
 little he can do to ensure this.   Even if he does
 in fact supervise the machine-building ministries,
 their budget must be approved by the powerful State
 Planning Commission, headed by a long-time civilian
 protege of Chou En-lai. Chou himself made it clear
 in his report to the National People's Congress
 that China's economic priorities remain the same,
 with agriculture heading the list and heavy in-
 dustry, including defense-related projects, coming
 in last.  It is possible that defense may in fact
 get somewhat more money than it did last year, but
 certainly not as much as some in the military would
 like.
 In the complex system of interlocking party,
 government,  and military bureaucracies, Chen is one
 of three men who hold important posts in each area.
 But just as he does not have a free hand to push
 for special interests in the government hierarchy,
 he is subordinate to Chou En-lai and to close Chou
 associates in the party and military as well.
 In fact, in the military hierarchy, Chen is

 accountable to ranking deputy chief of staff
 Yang Cheng-wu, who criticized Chen by name during
 the Cultural Revolution.
 Chen should be pleased with his new responsi-
 bilities, but the system of checks and balances in
 the three major bureaucracies currently works in
 favor of civilian moderates and against any in-
 dividual who might -try to upset the balance.  As
 pointed out in the February issue of the party
 theoretical journal Red Flag, there is little
 tolerance of the notion that "each takes what he
 wants and puts it to his exclusive use." Chen
 probably has most of what he wants but, in return,
 he will be expected to cooperate with the rest of
 the team.

 Wrangling with Hanoi
 I                                I
 Signs of tension in Peking's relations with
 Hanoi have increased in recer.t weeks.               As in the
 past, evidence of friction between the two sides
 peaked earlier this year when battlefield action
 was on the upswing and Hanoi's requirements for
 support presumably had increased.
 The frictions are evident in public comments
 from both sides, as well as in recent private com-
 plaints of Vietnamese officials in Peking and abroad.
 Explanations of these difficulties lie in Hanoi's ap-
 parent view that Peking has not provided full support
 to the war effort ii. South Vietnam and in Peking's
 concern that Hanoi is attempting to expand its in-
 fluence in Indochina.
 Recent examples of conflict center on these
 issues, which, have been a source of irritation in the
 no-Vietnamese relationship for years.  Last month,
 that the Chinese, un i e the  o ie s, could
 not be    rusted and that Peking in fact, "does not
 want to s      united Vietnam."   In a series of recent
 reports, I                                Iwhose views
 almost certainly reflect. Hanoi s attitude on this sub-
 ject, assarted that the Chinese had torpedoed the
 PRG's recent attempt to gain a seat at the Red Cross
 Law of War meeting in Geneva.    The official claimed
 that the. Chinese had decided at the last minute not to
 attend the conference, and had then lobbied with Third
 World representatives against a resolution that would
 have seated a PRG delegation.
 There have been several other recent reports
 of private North Vietnamese criticism of the low levels
 of Chinese support.
 North Vietnamese complaints that   e

 Chinese were dragging their feet in the shipment
 of war material.                                                25X1
 in early February that in late De gem er, Peking
 was 33 shipments behind schedule in weapons and
 economic aid deliveries to Hanoi.  Reflecting the
 philosophical differences that lie behind the con-
 troversy,                                                                said re-       25X1
 cently that the Chinese have urged a. "slow, mod-
 erate approach" in South Vietnam and were opposed
 to large-scale warfare there.
 Peking's own propaganda has reflected this
 difference.  When the fighting in. the South picked
 up in January, Chinese media coverage of the situa-
 tion was reserved.   Instead of providing detailed
 coverage of Communist victories,  the Chinese press
 emphasized that Communist initiatives were aimed at
 preserving the Paris accords and played down the
 large-scale nature of this military activity.
 The friction appaLc~ntly goes beyond differences
 over the Vietnam war.   Last month, on the first an-
 niversary of Peking's assertion of authority in the
 Paracel Islands, the Chinese press took note of the
 event with articles UJL,at pointed up the historical
 basis of Peking's claim to sovereignty there.  An
 NCNA commentary also asserted that Peking would brook
 no challenge to its position in the islands--presum-
 abl                               from Hanoi as well as from other  uarters.  A
 25X1                                               implied In
 January that Hanoi had officially protested to the
 Chinese on the Paracel issue.
 Other examples of Peking's apparent unhappi-
 ness with Hanoi include:
 --Coverage of the second anniversary of
 the Paris Accords, which was limited
 to an NCNA correspondent's account in
 contrast to the People's Daily edito-
 rial last year commemorating the event.

 Approved For Release 2007/01/17 : CIA-RDP86T00608R000300090007-4
 --Chinese media apparently made no
 mention of the 25th anniversary
 of the establishment of PRC-DRV
 diplomatic relations in 1950.
 The current situation in Cambodia, is almost
 certainly influencing Peking's wary attitude toward
 Hanoi.   As the Khmer Communists, whose ties with
 Hanoi are apparently closer than those with Peking,
 draw closer to a military victory in Cambodia,
 Chinese fears of widening North Vietnamese influ-
 ence                                Indochina almost certainly giow.   The Chi-
 nese also seem to be concerned about increased So-
 viet influence on the Khmer Communists--both di-
 rectly and indirectly through Hanoi--ia the event
 of an early Communist victory.
 Peking apparently does not believe that the
 Communists are likely to win a quick victory in
 South Vietnam.   It is clear that such a development,
 together with a Communist take-over in Cambodia,
 would cause serious problems for Peking.   Chinese
 leaders almc;:t certainly recognize that the resultant
 absence of a strong US presence in Indochina would
 bring Peking into even more direct and costly com-
 petition there with both Hanoi and the Soviets.
 This
 is not to say that the Chinese are
 unin-
 terested
 in maintaining their equities with
 North
 Vietnam.
 The delivery in early February of
 eight
 MIG-19 fighters to Hanoi was probably a sop
 to North
 Vietnamese requests for additional military
 support.
 Providing aid in the form of highly visible
 aircraft
 may help soften Hanoi's criticism, although it con-
 tributes little to North Vietnam's capability to
 prosecute the war in the South.
 Peking's interest in maintaining maximum influ-
 ence in Hanoi is further reflected by a PLA delega-
 tion's arrival in the North Vietnamese capital last

 week.  The riission, headed by Sinkiang military
 chief Yang Yung, almost certainly will take up
 the Cambodian situation with Vietnamese leaders.
 The visit is also probably a Chinese attempt to
 balance the trip to Hanoi made late last year by
 a high-level Soviet military group.

 Peking has devised an official explanation
 fox Mao's absence from the National People's Con-
 gress in January.
 25X1
 25X1
 According to    e orricial line, Mao announced
 as early as August 1973, at the Tenth Party Congress,
 that he did not plan to attend the people's congress
 because he did not intend to hold a government post
 and wanted to concentrate exclusively on party affairs.
 This official story seems to combine e.emenbs
 of truth with some elements of obvious chicanery.
 The explanation that Mao wants to devote his time
 only to party matters does not explain his failure
 to attend the Central Committee plenum that pre-
 ceded the people's congress. As chairman of the
 party, Mao's presence at this meeting, in light of
 his exclusive attention to party matters, would
 seem mandatory.  Nor does this story account for
 his long absence from Peking, which dates not merely
 from the meetings in January but back to July of
 last year.   Still away from the capital, Mao ap-
 pr..rently moved early in February from his home
 province of Hunan to a favorite vacation spot in
 Hangchou in Chekiang Province.
 The story does strike an authentic note with
 Mao's disinterest in occupying a government posi-'
 tion.  He has been on record for years as saying
 he did not want to be head of state and that the
 post should be abolished, as it was at the people's
 congress.
 This situation bears an ironic resemblance to
 that of 1958, when Mao claimed he was voluntarily
 stepping down as head of state to devote more time

 move was not voluntary an-1 that he was deliberately
 shunted aside by the party leadership.  Mao would
 have difficulty making that claim today, not only
 because of his many statements that he did not
 want to be head of state, but because the story
 has widely circulated in China that he was shown
 in advance and personally approved the reports and
 the slate of government officers recommended by the
 Central Committee to the people's congress.  I
 These accounts seem designed to counter any
 speculation that the Chairman has been put out to
 pasture, or that major steps have been taken over his
 objections.  In fact, a recent statement of his has
 touched off a nationwide political study campaign,
 suggesting Mao remains a central fi urn on the
 political scene.
 Paradoxically,
 Mao left Peking just as the unity theme began to be
 promoted vigorously in the propaganda.
 Whether Mao opposed the idea of unity at that
 time, he has now apparently joined the rest of the
 leadership in endorsing this sentiment.   How strongly
 he actually feels about unity within the leader-
 ship is not clear, however, for the longer he stays
 away from Peking, the more "Likely he is to give the
 impression that something--or someone--in the capital
 displeases him.

 Peking's Third World rhetoric notwithstanding,
 Latin America has long been the neglected child of
 China's foreign policy.   Lately, however, the Chi-
 ..ese have shown more interest in increasing their
 contacts with certain countries in the region, and
 a greater flow of delegations is one indication of
 this trend.
 China's vice minister of fuel and chemical in-
 dustries, Tang Ko, recently spent six weeks touring
 Venezuela, Mexico,  and Trinidad, an unusually long
 overseas visit for a vice minister.  Next month,
 Poliburo member and vice premier Chen Yung-kuei,
 accompanied by a retinue of 21 Chinese, will pay a
 one-week visit to Mexico.  This deiegaton will in-
 clude a vice minister of agriculture and forestry
 as w?il as a ranking official of the Ministry of
 Foreign Affairs.  Although Chen probably has less
 influence than his position would suggest, he is the
 highest ranking official ever to visit Latin America.
 .3oth political and economic considerations seem
 to be behind much of this activity.   Tang Ko's trip
 to three petroleum-producing countries was avowedly
 to determine whether they could assist China in off-
 shore exploration and drilling; it is not known if
 any agreements were concluded.   Over the longer term,
 though, Peking probably calculates that these oil
 producers will grew in political influence and that
 they may prove useful to the Chinese in pursuing their
 anti-Soviet aims in the region.   This helps explain
 why Chen Yung-kuei is being sent to strengthen re-
 lations with Mexico, a country whose petroleum in-
 dustry appears to have great potential.
 Trade seems to be another important lure for
 the Chinese.   Several months ago, Lin Ping, director

 the Chinese Foreign Ministry, remarkedi
 that China is increasingly interested in LLtin
 America as a source of raw materials. Chile is a
 case in point.   Despite certain political lia-
 bilities, the Chinese have carefully cultivated
 relations with Santiago to ensure a steady flow
 of natural fer'.ilizers and copper to China.
 Peking also hopes to increase its exports to
 Latin America and has recently held a number of
 trade fairs in the region.
 The Chinese would like to strike a balance
 between economic and political goals in Latin
 America, and seem determined not to sacrifice
 one for the other.  For example, in the interest
 of maintaining cordial political. ties with Brazil,

 Watching and Waiting in the Provinces
 F__                            I
 Provincial leaders are treating Mao's latest
 dictum to study the "dictatorship of the proletariat"
 with caution. They seem to be particularly concerned
 that it may lead to new attacks on them.
 The troublesome quotation, which first appeared
 in a People's Daily editorial on February 9th, was
 expanded on in a series of articles carried in
 official party papers and journals. Besides calling
 for stricter adherence to party discipline and for an
 end to public disturbances, the articles continue
 the strong attack on a number of common practices
 that undermine the collectivized economy. Cadre who
 tolerate such "bourgeois" behavior also come in for
 harsh words, but the articles generally counsel ed-
 ucation and discussion as the remedy for such error:-
 One exception is an article by Chou Ssu, a
 pseudonym that suggests the article's views may
 be close to Chou En-tai's (the legalist Li Ssu
 was obviously an analogue to Chou's anti-Confucius
 propaganda).  It echoes much of the tough yet meas-
 ured language common to the other articles, but it
 also points out--in what some may see as a threat--
 that Lenin solved a simi-ar problem in the Russian
 party by purging those who persisted in their ways.
 Peking has not made its goals in this study
 campaign entirely clear.  Stricter enforcement of
 party directives, especially as they relate to the
 troubled economy, certainly seems to be one of
 its purposes, but the possibility of new attacks
 on provincial or national figures also exists.
 Understandably, the provinces have chosen to
 emphasize the safer economic aspects of the study
 campaign and will probably continue to do so until

 Peking's plans become clearer.  Familiar whipping
 boys--private plots, production bonuses, and peas-
 ants who shirk collective farm duties to seek better
 paying jobs elsewhere--are getting most of the crit-
 ism.  The provinces, however, like Peking, stress
 that it is not the existence, but the unauthorized
 expansion of these programs that is under attack.
 As much as possible, the provinces have avoided
 the more sensitive subjects in the campaign that
 could easily become the basis -"or renewed criticism
 of individual leaders. Most provinces have repeated
 Peking's criticisms of "bourgeois lifestyles and,
 muddled thinking" by "some cadre and workers," b,ot
 only a handful have relayed the warnings about the
 possibility of new "capitalist roaders" or enemy
 agents arising in the party. Many provincial leaders,
 especially those who are military men, were targets
 of the anti-Confucius campaign. Peking cut that
 campaign short prematurely last year,  partly because
 it had gotten out of hand. Provincial leaders may
 fear, rightly or wrongly, that this year's study
 campaign may be an attempt to continue last year's
 campaign under a new name.
 In addition to concern about their personal
 :? lfare, provincial leaders seem worried that the
 study campaign may lead to a revival of the
 factional clashes that characterized some phases
 of the anti-Confucius campaign. Yu Tai-chung, first
 secretary of Inner Mongolia, in an address to a
 provincial meeting on February 20th, dealt at length
 with the need to keep the study campaign "on course"
 and to educate, not persecute, erring individuals.
 Szechwan, Kiangsu, and Kweichow have all made simi-
 lar broadcasts stressing the importance of "accurate"
 criticisms and attention to unity.
 Peking also seems determined to keep the study
 campaign tightly controlled--law-and-order themes
 have been featured in all the national articles--but

 it is clear, too, that excessive caution or foot-
 dragging by provincial cadre will not be tolerated.
 One of the most recent articles in People's Daily

 Chien-ying as first vice chairman of the part
 military commission                                                  25X1
 The report
 is plausible in view of Yeh's high rank; in the
 past, the Chinese minister of defence has normally
 also been the commission's first vice chairman.
 Assuming the report is true, it suggests
 that the military commission is now dominated by
 allies of Premier Chou En-lai.   The other indi-
 viduals known with certainty to be commission
 vice chairmen--Hsu Hsiang-chien, Nieh Jung-chen
 and Teng Hsiao-ping--are all Chou supporters.
 Mao is, of course, the chairman of the mil-
 itary commission and, as party chairman, has been
 designated commander in chief of the armed forces.
 Mao's long absence from Peking and his limited
 physical stamina, however, mean that his impact on
 the workings of the commission is limited to the
 broadest policy questions.   The ranking vic;o
 chairman would be in a position to influence
 heavily the daily affairs of this body.
 The appointment of Yeh as the ranking active
 member of the military commission would help
 explain why he was not named a vice premier, as
 were previous defense ministers,   The upgrading
 of Yeh and the downgrading of the defense port-
 folio serves to emphasize party authority over
 the military without reflecting negatively on
 Yeh.
 Yeh's apparent promotion clearly conflicts
 with reports of last summer that party vice chair-
 men Wang Hung-wen had been made first vice chairman

 f the military commission.
 Wang was
 said to nave assumed the post because Yeh Chien-
 ying was ill.   in fact, Yeh did not appear in
 public between July 31 and September 30; it is
 possible that he was indisposed and that Wang was
 just filling in.
 Even such a temporary expedient, however,
 would certainly have rankled several experienced
 vice chairmen who would have felt themselves fully
 capable of taking over the reins, and who would
 have been concerned about the political implications
 of such a development, particularly as they relate
 to Wang's succession chances.   In any event, Yeh
 Chien-ying has recently been appearing regularly,
 while Wang's star has dimmed a bit.   It is by no
 means certain at this juncture that Wang is next
 in line to Yeh on the commission, or whether Wang
 did fill in last summer--or even if he is a senior
 member of the commission.
 In fact, apart from the vice chairmen clearly
 mentioned, we cannot be sure of the precise
 composition of the commission.   It has long been
 thought that Premier Chou was a member, but this
 has never been confirmed.   Several aging military
 veterans such as Chu Teh and Liu Po-cheng probably
 retain their membership, and would be inclined to
 support the moderates.   Shenyang Military Region
 commander Li Te-sheng presumably is still at least
 a member of the commission's standing committee
 and may hold a higher rank by virtue of his former
 position as head of the People's Liberation Army's
 political department.   The other military region
 commanders, including Politburo members Chen Hsi-
 lien and Hsu Shih-yu, as well as the first political
 commissars of the military regions, are almost cer-
 tainly members of the standing committee.  Opposi-

 power would presumably be centered in this group,
 although it is unlikely the group is fully cohe-

 In addition, Chang Chun-chiao may well be a
 commission vice chairman now that he has been
 named the PLA's top commissar, and he could have
 joined the upper rank.  In fact, the naming of
 civilians such as Chi Teng-kuei, the first polit-
 ical commissar of the Peking Military Region, to
 leading political commissar posts has probably
 resulted in an increasing civilianization of the
 military commission. This trend, coupled with the
 fact that supporters of Premier Chou hold impor-
 tant posts, suggests that despite the membership
 of regional military commanders the military
 commission is an important instrument in the

 The following is the text of a cable from the
 US consulate general in Hong Kong.
 The "Little Red Book" of Mao quotes, waved by
 Red Guards in the Cultural Revolution, may have a
 sober replacement in the collected quotes of Marx,
 Engels, and Lenin on proletarian dictatorship pub-
 lished jointly by People's Daily and Red Flag on
 February 22.   It is probably no coincidence that
 the new collection numbers 33 quotes, exactly the
 number of chapters in the original "Quotations
 from Chairman Mao Tse-tung."   Even the number of
 words, 10,000, is approximately the same.
 Time will tell what this return to orthodoxy
 and further downgrading of Mao thought means.   At
 present, the move is clearly Mao's initiative, and
 the joint editorial note accompanying the Marx-
 Engels-Lenin quotations, like a preface, cites
 four Mao quotations on dictatorship., led off by
 his recent dictum about.the need to study Lenin's
 writings on the subject.   (The last of these quotes
 is newly identified as coming from Mao, and warns
 about people like Lin Piao coming to power if
 Marxism-Leninism is not properly understood.)
 The collected Marx-Engels-Lenin quotes, from
 our initial reading of them in the Hong Kong com-
 munist press, convey a message aimed at improving
 discipline and, beyond that, at increasing pro-
 duction.   Three Lenin quotes come from his work
 "left-wing communism, an infantile disorder"
 (mentioned for the first time on the Inner Mongolia
 radio on February 20), and we would guess this is a
 particular warning to the left.  The left may also
 be the target of quote number 25, which hints at
 a rectification of party membership with emphasis

 on quali i.y rather than numbers.   The 10th Party
 Congress in 1973 revealed that the party had
 swelled to 28 million members, and the bulk of
 that influx would have come from the activists of
 the Cultural Revolution.           In view of the rehabil-
 itation of veteran cadres that has taken place
 since the fall of Lin Piao in 1971, we would guess
 that it is the left (and the young) who are most
 likely to be culled from membership, if it comes
 to that.
 The joint editorial note and collection of
 quotes appeared roughly two weeks after the February
 9 editorial launched the "dictatorship" campaign;
 this is the same interval between pronouncements
 which was observed at the outset of the artti-
 Lin/Confucius movement last year.  The campaign
 is still in the study phase, and we would expect
 some discussion yet to come about the organs of
 dictatorship--the courts, police, military, and
 militia.  We have heard nothing yet about the cam-
 paign's practical effects, but propaganda has made
 clear that increased production is to be the measure
 of performance.

 Politburo member Hua Kuo-feng, named a vice
 premier and the minister of public security at the
 National People's Congress, apparently retains
 the agricultural responsibilities he has exercised
 for the past two years.  11
 The combination of agriculture and public
 security, each a full time job in itself, obviously
 makes Hua a busy--and important--man, and fits with
 a general trend to concentrate a wide variety of
 duties in a few hands.   Hua'3 continuing agricultural

 A Larger Chinese Role
 in the Balkans
 China is devoting a good deal cf attention to
 the Balkan states and is attempting to increase Pe-
 king's influeizce in the region, largely out of con-
 cern over Soviet intentions.
 The unresolved succession question in Yugosla-
 via and the real limitations of Romanian independence,
 along with crises in the Middle East and Cyprus, have
 convinced Peking that important Chinese interests are
 affected k; the maneuvering of the powers--especially
 the UJSR--in southeastern Europe.
 The Chinese have sought--with varying success--
 to strengthen their influence in Albania, Romania,
 Yugoslavia and Bulgaria and to encourage antagonism
 to Moscow.
 For about a year, streams of official Chinese
 delegations and high-level visitors have criss-crossed
 the Balkans, and increased numbers of Albanians, Ro-
 manians, and Yugoslavs have visited China in return.
 Peking's spokesmen and press have spoken highly and
 frequently of Balkan policies, particularly those
 aimed against Moscow.
 This kind of attention is relatively new.   Al-
 though Peking for some years has been at pains to cul-
 tivate the maverick Romanians, the Balkans in general
 ranked relatively low in China's order of priorities,
 as evidenced by the inattention paid to its long-stand-
 ing ally Albania.   In 1973, it appeared that relations
 with the Balkan countries had languished, and the Chi-
 nese had written off the rest of Eastern Europe as hope-
 lessly under Soviet influence.   China set its sights on
 March 3, 1975

 Approved For Rele
 the West where there were brighter prospects for
 developing a community of interest in restraining
 Soviet conduct and where Peking could acquire the
 capital equipment and technology necessary for ac-
 celerated modernization of the Chinese economy.
 The Middle East and Cyprus conflicts clearly
 demonstrated the strategic value of the Balkans, par-
 ticularly to the USSR.  Soviet airlifts to Arab coun-
 tries required airspace clearance over the Balkan
 states.   Moreover, the deterioration in the USSR's
 relations with Egypt probably gave Moscow more inter-
 est in getting naval facilities in Yugoslavia.
 The Balkans' strategic vulnerability in Chinese
 eyes was increased by the increasingly shaky condition
 of NATO's southern flank running through Italy, Greece
 and Turkey, which was weakened by the Cyprus situation
 and by political and economic difficulties caused in
 part by Middle East oil pr?cir:g policies.   In addition,
 a stronger Soviet position in the Balkans that gave
 Moscow easier naval and air access to the Mediterranean
 and Middle East, would enhance Soviet strategic power
 at Western expense.
 Under these circumstances, Peking saw an obvious
 interest in enhancing its influence in the area.  Pe-
 king's establishment of greater influence in Moscow's
 backyard or encouragement of an independent course by
 the Balkan states would complicate Moscow's Middle East
 and European policies and tend to divert Soviet atten-
 tion from China.
 Peking has been particularly concerned that Mos-
 cow might seek to establish strong Soviet influence in
 Yugoslavia following Tito's death.

 The surfacing last
 sullulter or    e existence in Yugoslavia of a pro-Soviet
 group accused of anti-regime subversive activities--
 the so-called "Cominformist Affair"--added to Chinese
 concerns.
 Soviet intentions in the Balkans, in fact, have
 become an important concern of Chinese policy.   For-
 eign Minister Chiao Kuan-hua, in a major UN speech
 last fall, listed the Balkans along with oil as major
 new sources of international tension.  A commentary
 in People's Daily fleshed out this propaganda line,
 charging that Moscow had stepped up its "expansionism"
 in the area.   As "evidence," the article noted the
 "Cominformist" plot, Soviet military exercises near
 Romania, alleged demands for transit rights, and al-
 leged Soviet support for Bulgarian claims to part of
 Yugoslav Macedonia.
 I                                            Chinese officials
 invariably point to the Balkans as a world trouble spot,
 frequently adding what seems to be an element of gen-
 uine concern that conflicting Soviet and US interests
 in the region might well trigger a general war.
 The "Cominformist" plot also provided Peking a use-
 ful issue to promote antipathy to Soviet influence.   Chi-
 nese statements began to focus on Soviet threats to the
 independence of the Balkan states and on the determina-
 tion throughout the region to resist Soviet pressures,
 with military force if necessary.   The Chinese missed no
 opportunity to publicize Yugoslav and Romanian measures
 to strengthen conventional military forces, and to up-
 grade partisan warfare and civil defense capabilities,
 and Peking emphasized its readiness for military coop-
 eration with the Balkan states.
 Peking has long believed that Eastern Europe is a

 encouraged greater East European independence from Mos-

 Peking had ordered an intensive propagan a campaign
 to exploit Soviet-East European "divisions."
 in 2a ing s view, 1as ern  Europe is c a ing un er.
 Soviet pressure and strongly desires independence.
 Eastern Eurupe is a volcano likely to
 erupt  un er_ certain conditions, including a Soviet
 attack against China.
 Soviet efforts to convene an international Commu-
 nist conference that would challenge China's Communist
 credentials and isolate the PRC have further spurred
 Peking's Balkan policies.   Peking has sought to persuade
 East European states that they and China share a common
 interest in curbing Soviet attempts to impose Moscow-
 oriented discipline on Communist states.  The Chinese
 clearly are banking on mavericks like Yugoslavia and Ro-
 mania to continue to hold the line against Moscow and
 thereby reduce Soviet pressure on China.
 In view of Yugoslavia's strategic location and its
 uncertain political future, improved ties with Belgrade
 seem of overriding importance to China's Balkan policy.
 The once-dormant relationship revived in the wake of
 the "Cominformist Affair."  On the heels of Tito's an-
 nouncement of the plot, the highest level Yugoslav mili-
 tary delegation ever to visit China and a Yugoslav par-
 liamentary delegation arrived in Peking.  Belgrade re-
 paid in kind when Vice Foreign Minister Yu Chan visited
 later in 1974.   Prime Minister Bijedic is scheduled to
 arrive in Peking this spring; he will be the highest
 ranking Yugoslav to visit China. Following Yu Chan's
 visit, the Yugoslav press reported that the two sides
 were satisfied with the positive development of relations.
 Nevertheless, the relationship is relatively frag-
 ile.                     A renewal of ties on the Communist party level is
 unlikely.   Belgrade evidently was put off to some extent
 by Yu Chan's emphasis on the Soviet threat, and his use

 of anti-Sovietism as the basis for Sino-Yugoslav
 relations, and Belgrade made clear its desire to
 keep its distance from China's dispute with Mos-
 cow.   China's restrained handling of the "Comin-
 formist Affair" seems to reflect such caution.
 Overcoming obvious temptations, the Peking press
 has carefully follcwed Belgrade's lead in publi-
 cizing the affair and has largely refrained from
 independent comment.
 Peking is less inhibited in its relationship
 with Romania.   Efforts to strengthen relations last
 summer proved productive almost immediately.   Peking
 sent the highest ranking Chinese mission to travel
 abroad in almost a year to Romania's 30th National
 Day celebrations.   The Chinese group was given an ex-
 ceptionally cordial and warm reception.   This pattern
 was repeated later in 1974 during the Romanian Party
 Congress when President Ceausescu's reference to "the
 ascending trend of cooperation with China" drew some
 of the warmest applause that his keynote address
 received.
 Peking has given extensive coverage to Romanian
 defense measures, and pointed Chinese statements on
 "threats of force" during the visit of Romania's for-
 eign minister to Peking drew a strong disapproving
 reaction from Moscow.   Some observers have concluded,
 in fact, that Peking is encouraging Bucharest in part
 because of concern over Romanian staying power.
 China's friendship with Albania also is on the
 upswing following a period of relative decline.   China
 exchanged more delegations at all levels with Albania
 in 1974 than with any Balkan country, and the warmth
 in greetings and press treatment that was customary
 years ago has resumed.
 The relationship was given a shot in the arm
 last year when Tirana bluntly rejected Soviet sound-
 ings on prospects for closer USSR-Albanian relations.

 Defense Minister Balluku was subsequently purged--
 apparently because he advocated a review of ties
 with Moscow, which implied criticism of Tirana's
 relations with Peking.  Premier. Shehu later denounced
 Soviet overtures as a blatant attempt to split Al-
 bania from China.
 The relationship is still not, however, what it
 was years ago.  The issue that divides Peking and
 Tirana--China's rapprochement with the industrialized
 West--remains unresolved.   The two sides' ideological
 kinship and antipathy toward the USSR are sufficient
 to sustain relations at the current plateau, which
 suits China's purposes in the Balkans.
 China's thinly veiled anti-Soviet appeals to Bul-
 garia, however, have proven completely unproductive.
 The Chinese have given heavy play to Bulgarian contacts
 with the West and cited examples of inequitable Soviet
 economic treatment of Bulgaria.   Bulgarian speeches
 last year were so blatantly anti-Chinese, however, that
 Peking's ambassador staged walkouts.  On the PRC Na-
 tional Day,  the Sofia press sharply attacked the Chinese
 government t:nd Mao's leadership.
 Despite some disappointments,  Peking probably is
 reasonably satisfied with the turn of events in the
 Balkans.   Romania, Yugoslavia, and Albania clearly rec-
 ognize  that good relations with China are useful 4.n
 helping to counter the USSR.
 Although the Soviets have made some headway in
 Yugoslavia despite the Cominformist affair, Peking can
 take satisfaction that Romania, Yugoslavia, and Albania
 all took steps last year to add new muscle to their
 military defenses, and to improve relations and coordi-
 nation with one another.  Yugoslavia and Albania had
 long been at odds with one another over ideological
 and other issues, and in the early 1960s their quar-
 rels were used as a surrogate by both Moscow and Pe-
 king for their then-burgeoning larger quarrel.   Now
 the Chinese are clearly encouraging rapprochement.

 Indeed, the Chinese may be on the verge of help-           25X1
 ing to finance a project in Yugoslavia that would tie
 Albania closer to Yugoslavia and eventually Western
 Europe.
 Tirana already  has indicated interest in linking the
 terminus of. Albania's rail line to the Belgrade-Bar
 line some 50 mi-Les away.   Albania presently is not
 tied to the European rail system.   The rail line is
 only a f'ew miles from the port at Boka Katorska, which
 the Soviets covet.
 Bucharest and Belgrade, moreover, have opposed
 Soviet efforts to censure Peking at gatherings of Euro-
 pean Communist parties.   In fact, no criticism of an-
 other party is a stipulation to their continued partici-
 pation in the present series of Europear. Communist
 party conferences.
 All sides recognize. however,  .ne limitations of
 Chinese influence in the Balkans.  As Premier Chou En-lai
 remarked to a Yugoslav correspondent some time ago:
 "water at a distance cannot extinguish fire."   Despite
 Peking's incessant talk about military cooperation, the
 Chinese lack an effective military option to influence
 events even if Peking were inclined to risk Soviet
 counteraction.  Chinese military assistance would be
 of little use, and no one has proposed mutual security
 pacts or even informal coordination.
 Nevertheless, Chinese actions and statements
 regarding the Balkans suggest that Peking is far more
 worried about the dangers of a blow-up in that area
 than it is about the risk of a more general European
 conflagration involving Western Europe.  Although
 China continues to stress that Moscow's rapacity and
 perfidy make a Soviet move against Western Europe pos-
 sible, its statements on this subject lack the urgency
 of private Chinese remarks on the Balkan situation--and

 in fact Peking probably does have a good deal to
 worry about in the wake of Tito's demise.
 The Chinese may in part be hoping for US ac-
 tion to forestall aggressive Soviet moves.  A Chi-
 nese official                                                         25X1
 indicate   as  October before Secretary Kis-
 singer's trip to Peking that China "needs" informa-
 tion on US intentions toward Yugoslavia.  The offi-
 cial asserted Moscow was pressing Belgrade for naval
 bases in the Adriatic, 'and that US policy was the
 "key" to the situation.
 The Cyprus situation and related Greek and Turk-
 ish ties with NATO are also important elements af-
 fecting the balance in the Balkans over which Peking
 has little influence.   Peking has tried to develop
 friendly relations with both Athens and Ankara--its
 embassies in both capitals are still relatively new--
 and to counsel restraint to both parties.  The Chi-
 nese seem to have no objection to Dr. Kissinger's
 efforts at mediation.   Peking's overriding interest
 is the maintenance of NATO's southeastern flank, and
 the Chinese have made it clear that they would use
 their veto in the UN Security Council to block a So-
 viet role in the Cyprus settlement.
