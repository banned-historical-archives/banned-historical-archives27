 SOVIETS EXPAND NEWS SERVICES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA.  TASS News Agency
 for the first time has recently stationed a correspondent in the new
 state of Singapore. There are unconfirmed reports that NCNA (New China
 News Agency) plans to do the same.  NOVOSTI  (APN), the other Soviet news
 agency, which also functions as a feature service, began offering serv-
 ices in Hong Kong about three months ago.                           NOVOSTI distributes in Hong
 Kong through ASAFLA News Agency (presumably for Asia-Africa-Latin
 America), the director of which is a Chinese of Indonesian nationality
 named"S.K. Ong (aka Wang Hsi-chun [telecodes 3769, 6932, 68741; aka Wong
 Sik-kuan, aka Ong Siek-khan), DOB circa 1913.
 NEW EDITION OF THE "LARGE SOVIET ENCYCLOPEDIA."  The new chairman
 of the Soviet State Committee for Publishing announced in December that
 a new edition of the Large Soviet Encyclopedia will be published, pos-
 sibly during 1966, and that it would be shorter than previous editions.
 Speculation is rife that the editors have been advised to abridge cover-
 age of the Soviet era -- both historical and biographical -- in order to
 avoid future embarrassments if the "official  line" changes on a person
 (e.g., Beria, Stalin, Khrushchev) or event (e.g., Battle of Stalingrad).
 SOVIET PUBLISHERS-COMPLAIN OF CENSORSHIP AND OTHER DIFFICULTIES.
 Literary Gazette, leading Soviet intellectual review, in its issue of
 last November 13 carried an article, which included a strong complaint
 about delays caused by "checking or consultative organs" (i.e., censor-
 ship authorities), saying that these bodies were often able to delay
 publication of important works almost indefinitely, and recommending
 that Soviet laws be passed defining precisely the maximum periods during
 which manuscrpits and books can be held by the authorities.  The same
 review a week later also complained of the faults in the system of al-
 locating paper for books, saying that some important works had been de-
 layed because of paper shortages caused by printing innumerable brochures
 of various types which were of no great importance.

 Power     Castro Ignores British
 ve the    Guianan Rice Offer.
 People
 In a series of exchanges
 since January Premier
 Fidel Castro has publicly charged
 the People's Republic of China
 with reneging on a trade agreement
 )and thereby forcing him to cut the
 Cuban people's",ri.ce ration in half.
 [See BPG #986.]  While it.appeared
 likely that the mutual public re-
 criminations would cause diplo-
 matic relations to be broken,
 Cuba's Ambassador has returned
 to Peking.
 Castro also denounced certain
 countries to the free world for
 boycotting trade with Cuba while
 continuing to trade with the CPR
 -- because it was a more important
 customer.
 But Georgetown's Sunday
 Chronicle (27 February) reported
 that the, British Guiana government
 (no friend of communist Cuba), was
 concerned with the plight of the
 Cuban people and had offered to
 sell rice:to Castro.  However,
 Castro had not told the Cuban peo-
 ple of this-offer, nor had he re-
 sponded with a purchase offer.
 The same report points out that
 when defeated Marxist and former
 prime minister Cheddi Jagan visited
 Cuba, he supported Castro's call
 for armed struggles in Latin Amer-
 ica and made no attempt to inform
 the people that Brit isl-944iana
 would sell them rice.
 The article asks:  "What kind
 of politics is Communism when it
 will stand by and see the.people
 go hungry and ignore the benefits
 for all in buying our rice?"
 [See Briefly Noted below on
 Castro's latest, official statement
 to the UN on his right to export
 revolution to Latin America.]
 Defies     Castro Letter to U Thant
 Latin
 America    As a result of the state-
 ments made at the Tri-
 Continent Conference in
 Havana, January 1966, and the estab-
 lishment at that Conference of a
 Committee to Aid the National Lib-
 eration Movements, 18 member nations
 of the Organization of American States
 (excepting only Mexico) addressed a
 letter (10 Feb 66) to.the Security
 Council of the United Nations pro-
 testing against this blatant inter-
 ference in their internal affairs.
 This provoked an almost incredi-
 ble letter from Fidel Castro to U
 Thant, Secretary General of the UN, in
 which he denounced all the signers of
 the OAS protest-as "miserable lackeys"
 of Yankee imperialism.  He averred
 that "the peoples of the Latin Ameri-
 can countries that those governments
 claim to represent are mercilessly
 plundered by U.S. monopolies. The peo-
 ples under those governments have a
 right - which they will exercise sooner
 or later - to sweep out those govern-
 ments, which are traitors, and serve
 foreign interests in their own coun-
 tries, and they will sweep them out
 with the most violent revolutionary
 action, because imperialist exploitation

 and oppression is exercised increas-
 ingly by means of force, violence
 and arms, and no other possible
 choice is left.  To proclaim the
 right of those peoples ... is not
 an act of intervention, but'-rather
 the struggle against. intervention.
 It is not just to confuse the spirit'
 of independence with interventionism."
 Not surprisingly, the letter
 provoked a storm of protest through-
 out Latin America, since it served
 to confirm the apprehensions which
 the Havana Conference had already
 aroused.  The text of Castro's let-
 ter is attached for further documen-
 tation of the actual intentions of
 Communism for Latin America and of
 "National Liberation" movements
 generally.
 Soviets
 Can';t       Caricaturist Censored
 Stand        for Cartoon.
 Criticism
 Helsingin Sanomat, the
 largest and most respected of Fin-
 land's newspapers, carried a cartoon
 by the very talented and very it-,.
 reverent caricaturist "Kari" in its
 edition of 26 January 1966.  The car-
 toon poked fun at the 10th anniversary
 celebration of the return of the
 Porkkala area to Finnish possession
 (it had been leased to the Soviets
 for 50 years at the end of World War
 II at their demand), questioning
 whether there was any real reason to
 celebrate the Soviet gesture.
 Obviously spurred by a complaint
 from the Soviet. Embassy in Helsinki,
 the Finnish Foreign Minister, Dr. Ahti
 Karjalainen, wrote a strong letter to
 the executive editor of the newspaper
 in which he stated, "As foreign minis-
 ter, I regard it as- my duty sharply
 to condemn the manner in which the
 lLelsingin Sanomat has behaved in
 this mater.   He asserted that the
 cartoon conflicted with the best in-
 terests of the nation, and accused
 its author of willfully harming
 Finland's friendly. relations with
 the Soviet Union.
 As may be seen by the copy of
 the cartoon which is included as
 an attachment, it was quite innocuous
 by free world standards.  That the
 Soviets should complain about it is
 a measure not only of their obsessive
 desire to stifle criticism of any
 sort, but also of their plain boor-
 ishness ... points which might well
 be made by replay of the cartoon and
 its brief history4   [We do not cast
 aspersions on the Finnish govern--
 ment].
 Soviet
 Diplo-      Support of Liberation
 matic       Struggle
 Dilemma
 Soviet association with
 the aggressive calls for revolution
 in Latin America, Africa and Asia
 issued in January at the Havana
 Tri-continent Conference have
 brought widespread reaction in
 Latin America.  On the heels of the
 2 February OAS resolution condemn-
 ing "the open participation ... of
 official or officially-sponsored
 delegations of member states of the
 UN [in violation of the principles
 of the UN Charter and UN Resolution
 2131 (XX), 21 December 1965]...,"
 Uruguay was reported to be consid-
 ering a break with Moscow.  Uruguay
 queried the Soviets through diplo-
 matic channels whether Soviet chief
 delegate Rashidov's interventionist
 statements at Havana were made in
 the name of the Soviet government.

 note, and elsewhere in Latin
 America where officially confronted,
 evidences cautious attempts to dis-
 sociate the Soviet government from
 the militant resolutions and speeches
 of the Conference, particularly from
 Rashidov's statement.  The Soviet
 reply pointed out that the delega-
 tion to Havana represented "Soviet
 social organizations" rather than
 the Soviet government; and reportedly
 also that Soviet officials explained
 that Rashidov "merely stated a per-
 sonal political position."  In ef-
 fect, while told that delegates
 represented Soviet "social organi-
 zations," their positions correspond
 with Soviet policy, which "officially"
 respects sovereignty of all nations;
 however, if peoples are "oppressed"
 by colonialism, neocolonialism or
 imperialism -- terms that offer
 great latitude for interpretation
 --, the Soviet Union, as spearhead
 of world revolution, does intervene.
 In other words, there is no disparity
 between Rashidov's statements in
 Havana and Soviet foreign policy as
 outlined in the recent past by gov-
 ernment officials, a fact that
 Soviet diplomatic and public dis-
 claimers have attempted to circumvent
 with clever phraseology and ploys,
 always mindful of not alienating
 Afro-Asians and Latin Americans or
 exposing themselves to harsh comment
 from Peking.
 Some of the Soviet delegates to
 the Tri--continent Conference do be-
 long to Soviet social, cultural or
 international front organizations,
 entities which are said to reflect
 the views of the Soviet people.
 Other Soviets present in Havana
 have in the past engaged in high
 level official and non-official
 activities which are so comple-
 mentary and coincident in time that
 it is difficult to imagine that they
 do not at least overlap.  Sharif
 Rashidov's career is most illustra-
 tive of this point.   (See unclassi-
 fied attachments.)  Our emphasis
 remains on demonstrating Soviet com-
 plicity in promoting subversion and
 their attempts to pacify and mislead
 friendly governments which are Soviet
 targets of subversion.
 Double        The 23rd CPSU Congress
 Standards
 in Soviet     The 23rd CPSU Congress
 Media         is still scheduled to
 convene 29 March, shortly
 after this Guidance will be received,
 and there is little evidence of what
 to expect beyond that discussed in
 our two preliminary BPG items on the
 subject, Nos. 976 and 985.  A brief
 plenum session on 19 Feb "approved"
 the draft 5-year plan for presenta-
 tion to the Congress.  As anticipated,
 it is scaled down considerably from
 the grandiose 20-year project in-
 cluded in the 3rd Party Program by
 the 22nd Congress.
 Washington Post staff writer
 Rosenfeld on February 26th drew at-
 tention to a "stunning discrepancy"
 between the TASS International Ser-
 vice English-language summary of
 the draft plan and the Russian text
 broadcast by Radio Moscow domestic
 service:  the summary included --
 and the Russian text omitted -- a
 pledge "to introduce everywhere (by
 1910) a monthly guaranteed remunera-
 tion for work of collective farmers,
 corresponding to the level of wages
 for state-farm workers."  R. points
 out that this is not only a radical
 economic proposal but also a politi-
 cal hot potato and speculates that
 the last-minute switch indicates

 conflict in the Kremlin.  (See R.
 article in Press Comment, 1 March
 1966.)
 The Russian text also omits
 the summary's statement that the
 1970 target for average non-farm
 wages is 114 rubles/month (compared
 with 95 in 1965 and 90 in 1964).
 Propagandists can play up
 Rosenfeld's suggestion of conflict
 in the Kremlin -- or they might
 play these cases as samples of
 double standards in Soviet media:
 i.e., these attractive features are
 advertised to the outside world for
 maximum international propaganda
 advantage, but the Soviet leadership
 is so doubtful whether they can be
 realized that it does not disclose
 such promises to the Soviet people
 who might be more likely to remember
 and count on them.

 PROPAGANDIST'S GUIDE to COMMUNIST DISSENSIONS
 Commentary           16 Feb-I Mar 1966
 Principal Developments:
 1.   The Ambassadors of several non-Communist countries in Peking are re-
 porting to their governments around 1 March that the Chinese have notified
 the Soviet and East European Communist governments that no further over-
 flights of supplies to Hanoi will be permitted, that war material can be
 shipped by rail through China to Vietnam, but all other supplies will have
 to be sent by sea.   The Moscow correspondent of Belgrade Borba reports
 Soviet opinion that Peking wants to avoid a political settlement in Viet-
 nam "at any price," to prolong the warfare and spread it to "the other coun-
 tries of Indochina and make it the cause of a worldwide conflict."
 2.   The Poles expel the Albanian Ambassador on charges of distributing anti-
 state propaganda in Poland ("not for the first time") and enabling a (pro-
 Chinese dissident) Polish citizen to escape by providing him with an Albanian
 diplomatic passport.   The Albanians totally deny the charges, call the Polish
 action a retaliation for Albanian refusal to attend the Gomulka-proposed Com=
 itunist meeting in Warsaw "under pressure of the Soviet revisionist  oovern-
 ment" (see #72), and expel the Polish Ambassador (who had just been appointed
 on 28 January, in an apparent move to normalize relations after Poland had
 been represented in Tirana by only a Charge d'Affaires since Soviet-Albanian
 break in 1961).
 3.   Peking's major polemic of the period is a bitterly defensive People's
 Daily rebuttal to Castro's 6 February charges of Chinese pressure and sub-
 version tactics against Cuba.   NCNA precedes the PD rebuttal by publicizing

 4.  As the USSR and Mongolia ratify the new treaty of alliance negotiated
 during the January Brezhnev visit (#70), the Western press tells of reports
 reaching Moscow of the dispatch of 2 or 3 Soviet Army divisions into Mongolia
 because of Chinese troop concentration across the border, Feb 25 .  Another
 Western correspondent, citing reports from Bucharest, tells of Chinese re-
 fusal to extradite defectors from the USSR -- Bessarabians deported to Soviet
 Central Asia when the USSR annexed their homeland from Rumania in 19+5 -- on
 the ground that Russia had failed to extradite Chinese refugees to Soviet
 territory as required by the agreement they signed in 1951.  The Chinese re-
 portedly permitted the Bessarabians to contact the Rumanian Embassy in Peking
 for assistance.

 Polish and Yugoslav tributes described in #72, we have seen only a less en-
 thusiastic endorsement in the provincial Czechoslovak Communist organ Brati-
 slava Pravda.
 Significance:
 The extent of the transformation of international Communism's internecine
 warfare from ideological argumentation to national power conflicts is dramati-
 cally demonstated by the line-up of principal developments described above.
 The only event of truly great ideological significance -- the 10th anniver-
 sary of the 20th CPSU Congress, which (in addition to the more spectacular
 launching of de-Stalinization) drastically revised the official Soviet inter-
 pretation of the Marxist-Leninist scriptures and set in motion the trends and
 chain reactions which have led to today's disarray in the ICM -- is almost
 ignored by most of the Communist parties and states, -- which seem to be
 largely preoccupied with the evidence that the Soviet and Chinese protagonists
 are moving inexorably toward an open break.
 Further divergent reports on Soviet plans for trying to convene an inter=
 national Communist meeting in connection with the 23rd CPSU Congress leave
 the prospects still completely obscure, -- with evidence that most Communists
 are almost as much in the dark as the non-Communist world.                        25XIC10b

 Febrary.  14 (delayed):  NCNA Peking describes an article in "the latest
 issue" of "the Argentine journal No Transar, organ of the Communist
 vanguard group of Argentina," on the theme that "the Soviet revisionists
 have betrayed the national liberation movement of the Asian, Africa.,
 and Latin American peoples in order to materialize their criminal designs
 of cooperation with the U.S."
 February 16-23:  The organs of 12 CPs in Western Europe and the Western
 Hemisphere condemn or deplore the harsh Soviet sentence on writers
 Sinyavsky and Daniel.
 February 17:  Yugoslav Foreign Secretariat official spokesman Blago-
 jevic condemns the "harsh, unfounded, and unprovoked attack on Yugoslavia
 and its foreign policy" by Cuban Party organ Granma (see #72, Feb. 13),
 asking: "Who and what is this intended to serve?~' -
 February 17 and continuing:  The top-level Japanese CP delegation which
 has been visiting ComChina (see #72, Feb. 10 & continuing) flies from
 Canton to Hanoi on the 17th "for a friendship visit to the DRV."
 Vietnamese editorials and statements and the joint communique avoid
 mention of the dissensions ~n the ICM, but delegation head, SecyGen
 Miyamoto, at a "grand meeting" on the 19th, pledges to "fight against
 the main danger, modern revisionism, to be vigilant against dogmatism,
 sectarianism, and, at the same time, to work for the real unity of the
 ICM."
 The delegation leaves Hanoi on the 27th and arrives Peking on 28th:
 at a banquet that evening Miyamoto exults that "the militant friendship
 between the JCP and the CCP had withstood all tests in the struggle
 against imperialism, reactionaries of all countries, and modern revi-
 sionism."  (See also Feb. 24 for Sankei report.)
 February 19: A brief plenum of the CPSU/CC approves the draft directives
 for the 23rd CPSU Congress on the 19 6-70 5-year plan.  Observers point
 out that, although the plan seems to indicate a   modest    improvement
 in living standards, it falls far short of the grandiose forecasts of
 the_3zd Party Program approved by the 22nd Congress.  Nothing is released

 February 21:  TASS announces that:
 "Discussions of the draft directives of the 23rd CPSU Congress
 on the 5-year plan... have started in party organizations, at

 special section is being introduced in Pravda in which articles,

 NCNA reports from Colombo on a 10 February press release by
 "N. Sanmugathasan, member of the Politburo and Secretariat of the
 Ceylon CP/CC," which was published in Kemkaruwa on 18 Feb. under
 the title:  "Castro Joins Anti-Chinese Chorus."  S. is quoted as
 saying:
 "Cuba has for some time been drifting rapidly down the path
 of revisionism -- propelled down this path by Soviet aid
 amounting to 1 million rubles per day....  Castro, of course,
 had to pay the price for this peaceful coexistence.  He had
 to attack the common enemy of both U.S. imperialism and Soviet
 revisionism....
 Now Castro has resorted to vituperatives -- without any facts.
 How this speech must have warmed the hearts of Kosygin and
 Johnson -- present-day patrons of Castro! ...
 The extent of degree to which Cuba has departed from the revo-
 lutionary path can be gauged not only from the exit from the
 Cuban political scene of one of its foremost leaders, E. Che
 Guevara, but also of other foreign political refugees who had
 found asylum in Cuba and who now find political climate the
 inconvenient...."
 Reuters reports from Vienna:  "Well-informed Hungarian sources said
 in Budapest today that Premier Chou En-lai of Communist China would
 visit Rumania early in March....  The sources attached little special
 significance to the visit, suggesting that it was merely a 'demonstra-
 tion of Rumania's indepedence from the Soviet Union.'"
 February 21-22:  NCNA on the 21st claims that "the study of Mao Tse-tung's
 writings in China today is taking on an unprecedented mass character
 and developing in depth."  On the 22nd it reveals that "a lively exchange
 of experience on the study of Mao Tse-tung's writings took place at a
 9-day conference attended by 1,500 people that ended here last weekend....
 (It) is one of many now being convened in the urban and rural areas of
 the country as the study of Mao Tse-tung's writings develops in depth."
 Non-Communist observers see the Chinese leadership seriously concerned
 about the danger of revisionism developing within China.
 February 22:  Peking People's le's Daily publishes the full text of "Cuban

 "In the midst of the concerted attacks on China by the imperi-
 alists headed by the U.S., the reactionaries of all countries, and
 the Khrushchev revisionists, the Cuban Premier, Fidel Castro, has
 added his voice to the anti-China chorus....
 Premier Castro lets loose a torrent of vicious abuse organist
 the CPR....  He accuses China of 'dishonesty,' 'cynicism,' 'bad
 faith,' 'perfidy,' (etc.)....  A big country should not bully a
 small one, or vice versa; both should abide by principle and reason.
 Premier Castro is utterly unreasonable when he incites anti-Chinese
 feelings on the pretext of China's rice exports to Cuba and its
 distribution of printed matter in Cuba....  Premier Castro has
 arbitrarily laid at China's door the blame for the 'grave diffi-
 culties' Cuba had encountered in the economic field.  This way
 of shifting the blame onto others is far from clever....
 ...Premier Castro has gone very far down the road of opposition to
 China.  People will wait and see how much further he is prepared
 to go....
 We have not so far given a systematic reply to Premier Castro's
 anti-Chinese statements.  We reserve our right to do so.
 Premier Castro's statement of 6 February is useful material.
 We are publishing it here in full and are broadcasting it to the

 the people of Latin America and other parts of the world will read
 it, ponder over the problems it raises, and fraw their own conclu-

 Simultaneously with the release of the above by NCNA on the 21st,
 Izvestiya stresses Soviet complete unity and friendship with Cuba,
 emphasizing its agreement to boost its trade with Cuba by 20%.
 February 22 and 24:  NCNA Peking publicizes an article entitled "Anti-
 China Campaign in Full Swing" from a February issue of Vanguard, organ
 of the pro-Chinese dissident CP of Australia (M-L).  It includes the
 charge that "the Soviet revisionists are just as violent as the U.S.
 imperialists in their anti-China campaign.  They conduct their anti-China
 campaign dressed u_p in Communist laanguage. It is a dirtier campaign for
 that, but it is the same campaign.'  Another NCNA Peking release on the

 February 23 and 25:  Warsaw news agency PAP releases the following com-
 munique:
 "Slanderous and anti-state publications and materials have
 been circulated throughout Poland in recent weeks.  It has been
 established that these materials, which have not appeared for the
 first time, were printed in Albania this time, too.
 It has been established in the last few days that the Albanian
 Embassy went so far as to provide Kazimierz Mijal, a Polish citizen,
 with an Albanian diplomatic passport, issued in the name of an
 Albanian citizen who had stayed in Poland from 8 to 15 February
 this year.  Using this passport, Kazimierz Mijal left Poland ille-
 gally.
 As this activity of the Albanian Embassy constitutes a viola-
 tion of the principles of international law and good practice, as
 well as a violation of the law and order in force in the Polish
 People's Republic, the Polish Govt has recognized the further stay
 in Poland of the Ambassador of the Albanian People's Republic, Koco
 Prifiti, as undesirable."
 On the 25th, Tirana releases the text of an Albanian Foreign Ministry
 note to the Polish Government which rejects the Polish charges as "ground-
 less and purposely created by the Polish Govt"; ties them to the 11
 February Albanian open letter to the Polish Party rejecting its initiative
 toward calling a meeting of Warsaw Pact and Asian socialist countries
 (#72) "under pressure of the Soviet revisionist government"; and demands
 that the Polish Ambassador to Albania, Stanislaw Rogulski, be removed
 as persona non grata.
 February 24:  Tokyo newspaper Sankei reports "information confirmed by
 public security officials" to the effect that the Miyamoto-led JCP dele-
 gation touring China and Vietnam is scheduled to visit the USSR to attend
 the 23rd CPSU Congress.  It interprets the JCP decision as meaning that

 and 'made many people in our country understand the 20th Congress more

 propaganda for speedier de-Stalinization in the socialist countries, he
 writes:  "In our country ... the enemy plays this tune with special
 emphasis, since he knows of our weakness -- our trend to 'humanize' M-L...
 and to revive 'our traditional Czechoslovak democratism' of the Masaryk-

 995 WH,d.      ENCOURAGING EVIDENCE OF BRAZILIAN RECOVERY
 SITUATION:   The second anniversary of the Brazilian Revolution
 (to be celebrated on 31 March) will soon be at hand and this provides
 a convenient peg for stimulating propaganda favorable to the achieve-
 ments of the government of President Humberto Castello Branco.   Such
 propaganda is particularly necessary since the government itself is
 seemingly disinterested in obtaining a "good press" and apparently
 satisfied to let accomplishments speak for themselves.  A further argu-
 ment for stimulating favorable treatment is that press coverage tends
 to focus on sensational developments in Brazil, particularly any indi-
 cations that the revolution is going astray; this tends to eclipse less
 remarkable, though fundamentally more important information such as the
 improvement in the foreign trade balance.   Finally, current Brazilian
 developments require, above all, historical perspective.   It is es-
 sential to recall the legacy of the Kubitschek, Quadros, and especially
 the Goulart regimes and the chaotic economic, political and social con-
 ditions which sparked the Revolution, in order to comprehend the motives
 and actions of the present government.
 The most notable positive achievements of the Castello Branco gov-
 ernment lie in the field of economic stabilization.   On the domestic
 front, inflation has been cut from a projected annual rate of over 140%
 in early 1964 to 45% in 1965, with hopes of a further reduction in 1966.
 The austerity program has resulted in a substantial reduction of the
 budget deficit once financed by large inflationary new currency issu-
 ances.  Major administrative reforms are being undertaken, including
 in the autonomous government agencies such as the Federal railroads,
 merchant marine, etc., subsidies to which formerly absorbed more than
 one-half of the budget deficit.   Efforts are successfully being made
 to hold down large wage and price increases, improve tax collections
 and limit credit,
 The stabilization program has been accompanied by an extensive eco-
 nomic reform and development plan, including reforms of the tax, capital
 market, and banking systems,  Agrarian reform is intended to increase
 agricultural output and assist in the redistribution of land not in pro-
 ductive use.   Improvements in education, health, housing and working
 conditions are also programmed.  Major emphasis is being placed on more
 rapid economic growth and after two years of stagnation, the rate of
 growth in 1965 reached 5%.

 The government has taken various positive steps to encourage a
 resumption of private foreign investment which virtually halted under
 Goulart.   Recent announcements by Ford, Volkswagen, Union Carbide,
 Hanna Mining, Gulf('o.il,Phillips, and other major foreign companies
 indicate that international confidence in Brazil's ability to put its
 economic affairs in order under sound management is increasing..
 The revolutionary government has instituted a series of political
 reforms which seem to have received less criticism on the home front
 than abroad.   The old political party system of 13 or more groupings
 has been abolished and an effort is being made to concentrate their
 adherents into two or three major parties which would be more broadly
 based and less representative of narrow factional interests.   Elections
 of the President and of state governors in 1966 will now be indirect,
 that is by the national and state legislatures rather than direct, as
 in the past.   Direct elections for the Federal Congress and the Etate
 legislatures are scheduled for November 15.   The government has acquired
 the power to recess the Congress for periods up to six months in the
 event of serious internal strife  (this is a temporary measure which ex-
 pires at the termination of the present government),   In the first months
 of the revolution 300 persons were deprived of their political rights for
 a period of 10 years; these were persons accused of corruption, Communism,
 or supporting the anti-democratic initiatives of the Goulart regime.
 Elections are scheduled for the Fall of this year and President
 Castello Branco will step down in March 1967.   During the remaining year
 of his regime many other problems remain to be solved; these include im-
 plementation of the agrarian reform bill, building and staffing an ex-
 tensive school system, raising the literacy level, extending the road
 system into the hinterlands,raising the level of real wages, and counter-
 ing a resurgent nationalism.  As may be seen, these problems essentially
 revolve around the establishment of economic stability and then renewed
 economic growth; without them there can be no political solution.
 A further point of concern is the nature of the government which
 will be elected next Fall and installed the following March.   The degree
 to which this new government continues the general policies of the pres-
 ent regime, and the degree to which it eschews military dictatorship,
 are questions of considerable concern.   The current front-running candi-
 date-is War Minister Artur de Costa e Silva, a professional soldier,
 whose principal present base of power is the military.   Informed observ-
 ers are not entirely sanguine that he would readily adapt himself to the
 role of civilian leader of a civilian government.

 996.                       SINYAVSKY-DANIEL CASE
 SITUATION:   Voluminous reporting of the Sinyavsky-Daniel (S-D) case*
 recorded first the reaction of non-bloc intellectuals, then a broad
 spectrum of world opinion, and finally the leaders or media of at least
 12 non-bloc CP's.    Non-bloc concern focused on the issue of freedom and
 justice; prominent intellectuals tried to get Soviet leaders to release
 S and D who, since mid-September 1965, had been held incommunicado,
 probably without counsel, and with no charges preferred against them.
 Most of the CP's spoke out after the trial:   their main concern was that
 the S-D case would affect adversely their own positions.   The attach-
 ment and referenced articles in Press Comment 1 Mar 66 provide abundant
 details on the case:  we will deal here largely with facts and specu-
 lation about aspects of the case which are given little coverage else-
 where, viz., internal Soviet politics, problems with youth, legal aspects,
 and coincidental developments in other bloc countries.
 The Soviet leaders were clearly aware of the crescendo of foreign
 concern over the S-D case; yet they permitted a patently rigged trial,
 resulting in near-maximum sentences on l4 Feb.   Domestic considerations,
 therefore, appear to have been paramount.   Inasmuch as earlier intensi-
 fications of the struggle between the intellectuals and the regime
 usually coincided with increasing difficulties for the regime, it is
 assumed that the S-D case is a current symptom of such difficulties.
 'S and D were charged with producing anti-Soviet propaganda.   Their
 works were published in the West under the respective noms-de plume of
 Tertz and Arzhak.

 In the realm of politics, severe struggles are suggested by a
 survey of intellectual questions in the Soviet press between March and
 September 1965.  Most revealing was the sharp exchange in August and
 September between :a) Komsomol chief Sergey Pavlov [a Shelepin prote'g4
 who was linked to the S-D case by a prominent Soviet author (LOU)] and
 b) former chief Pravda editor Aleksey Rumyantsev, over the issue of
 permissible approaches to sociological and ideological problems. Pavlov
 won, and continued to propound the hard line on culture and a tolerant
 attitude towards Stalin.   Rumyantsev, who had vigorously defended the
 liberal authors, was removed from his post some time between 9 and 21
 September.   (The generally accepted date of the arrest of S and D is
 13 September.)   It is suggested, on this basis, that if any top Soviet
 leader was the victor in the S-D case, it was Shelepin.
 A subsequent political victory for Shelepin is suggested by the
 sentences.   Just before  the trial P.N. Demichev, a candidate for the
 presidium with responsibility for ideological questions, assured West-
 erners in Moscow that the sentences of S and D would be light.   (Tarsis
 stated in London that, according to Moscow rumor of early February, S
 would get 3 years and D would get 2 years).  The harshness of the actual
 sentences (7 and 5 years) indicates that an earlier decision has been re-
 versed.                A harsh sentence would be in keeping with the castigation of
 authors by Pavlov.
 In cultural matters, the enduring problems of the ideologically
 "correct" up-bringing of youth appear to have become increasingly signi-
 ficant in recent years.   This is evidenced by the deep involvement in
 the S-D case of Pavlov, whose Komsomol embraces the 14- to 26-year age
 group.  Pavlov's chief complaint about the influence of the undesired
 kind of literature is that it estranges youth from a communist world
 outlook and from a clear, precise idea of communist ideology, and that
 it interferes with the ability of Soviet youth to objectively analyze
 real life and hold correct ideological positions.   But Pavlov makes only
 feeble efforts to find a way to realize his ideological aims.   (See at-
 tached translation of article, which details other regime problems with
 youth.)  Furthermore, the outcome of the S-D case is hardly conducive
 to the production of the "right" kind of literature for Soviet youth.
 Nor can the recently published praise of the terror-tainted Zhdanov (see
 attachment) be expected to inspire Soviet authors to fulfill Pavlov's
 prescription.  The Soviets may succeed in restricting unbridled creative
 writing.       But they have given no evidence that they are preparing an ef-
 fective program of ideological guidance for youth.
 The persistence of other vexing problems -- economic, foreign af-
 fairs -- has probably tried the patience of the Soviet leaders.   They
 may well have been tempted to take a Stalinist short-cut in dealing with
 S and D.       Whatever their motivation, the leaders appeared to pay no heed
 to the substantial post-Stalin efforts of Soviet jurists who had attempted
 to reform the seriously deficient Soviet legal system.

 The legal aspects of the S-D case have drawn sharp criticism
 throughout the world.  These aspects include:  the long pre-trial
 incarceration incommunicado; the prejudicial attacks on S and D in
 the Government press before the trial; the limited access to the
 trial (no foreigners; 70 invited spectators, some of whom laughed
 heartily at the defendants' responses); the vagueness of the charges;
 the reported surprise call on S to submit his plea a day or 2 before
 scheduled; the failure of the Soviet court to furnish proof of guilt
 to the public; the harshness of the sentences, from which no appeal
 is permitted.
 For a comparison of reports of the trial with the Criminal Code
 of the RSFSR, the article. by Harvard's Professor Berman is by far the
 most useful and thorough.   (see Press Comment 1 March 66) Berman stresses
 the Code's critical requirement that there be "convincing proof of a di-
 rect intent -- a special purpose -- knowingly to defame the Soviet system
 and to weaken Soviet authority."  The British CP chief, John'Gollan,
 criticizing the trial, concluded:   "Justice should not only be done but
 should be seen to be done.  Unfortunately, this cannot be said in the
 case of this trial."   (see Press Comment l March 66 )
 General foreign reaction has been more voluminous and harsher than
 expected.   The vast majority of leftist intellectuals have protested
 individually or collectively:   in some countries, the communists were
 virtually the only ones not participating in the protest.
 The pressures of anti-Soviet feeling generated by the S-D case
 were evidently more than the CP's of many countries could stand.  There-
 fore a totally unexpected round of protests was issued by the leaders or
 appear.e d- in the CP media of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland, UK, France,
 Italy, Austria, Uruguay, US, Iceland, Chile.  A theme running through most
 of the CP protests was that the Soviets' actions were indirectly injurious
 to the CP in the non-communist country.  Little sympathy was spent, how-
 ever, on the plight of the 2 defendants.
 During the time that the S-D case was developing, signs of cultural
 suppression appeared in 5 other bloc countries, too:   Czechoslovakia,
 East Germany, Hungary, Poland, and Rumania.  A relationship between these
 events can only be speculated on.   Some of the highlights of the events
 in the bloc were:
 -- a suppression of journals formerly used by young, creative
 writers in Czechoslovakia;
 -- the arrest of a poet and attacks on creative artists in East
 Germany;
 -- attacks on abstract art by the party in Rumania;
 -- questioning of the relationship of Marxism and the individual
 (within Polish party circles) and a legal case involving the smug-
 gling of manuscripts out of Poland;

 -- a clear warning to Hungarian writers to stay within the pre-
 scribed bounds.
 In more than one of the countries, there was clear-cut evidence
 of a reversal of policy, of a step backwards to more restrictions on
 the expressions of creative intellectuals.       Further details are given
 in the attachments.

 997.              THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS:
 Stockholm, 5-8 May 1966
 SITUATION:   The Socialist International (S.I.), headquartered in
 London, will hold its bi-annual Congress in Stockholm, Sweden, from 5
 to 8 May, 1966.   The Congress is the highest forum of the International,
 in which -- as of 1959, the latest available world-wide statistics -- 39
 socialist parties are either members or observers.   (The now near-inactive
 Asian Socialist Conference, headquartered in Rangoon, Burma, has in the
 past cooperated closely with the S.I. and the Latin American Bureau of
 the S.I., headquartered in Uruguay is an affiliated organization.)  As of
 1959, these parties represented a total electorate of 66 million voters,
 owned 175 daily newspapers in 12 languages and published 154 periodicals.
 The S.I. represents the forces of organized Democratic Socialism
 throughout the world.  The Socialist Parties are non-Communist and indeed
 have reason, based on their history, to oppose and fear Communist inter-
 ference and infiltration.   They represent a substantial segment of labor
 and leftist thought outside the Communist world.  Their influence in most
 countries in Europe, the Near East, and in some non-Communist Asian and
 Latin American countries is considerable.  Their achievements are parti-
 cularly notable in Western Europe, while in Japan, Burma, India and Ceylon
 they have also carried marked weight.  The S.I., and the parties of which
 it is composed, reflect the genuine meaning of Socialism:  the gradual
 socialization of the principal means-of production, by consent and com-
 pensation (rather than by compulsion) and by constitutional (parliamentary)
 action through constructive evolutionary processes (rather than by violent
 revolution and confiscation); this as opposed to the Soviet and Peking mis-
 construction of the term which identifies Socialism as the dictatorship
 of the proletariat through revolution against and destruction of the exist-
 ing social, political and economic order to be replaced by Communist leader-
 ship.   For detailed background on the S.I., see unclassified attachment.
 As reported in the Socialist international Information (S.I.I.) of
 18 Dec. 1965, the 9 December Bureau meeting of the  S.I.  in Vienna  made
 final arrangements for the Congress and for the preceding special confer-
 ence.   S.I.I. reported that "the theme of the special conference will be
 'Democratic Socialist thought and action in the new countries.'   This
 special conference will be of private character, but the same theme will

 be discussed at the Congress, which will also discuss the international
 situation, the integration of Europe, and disarmament.  Provisions will
 also be made for the discussion of the problem of future liaison in the
 Asia-Oceania area, to respond to the desire of the parties in the area
 and aiming at a final discussion of the problem at a meeting point in
 Asia at the end of 1966."
 The S.I.I. also reported that the Disarmament Commission of the
 S.I. Will prepare a draft of resolutions for consideration by the vari-
 ous parties as a policy document at the Stockholm Congress.   -- No ad-
 ditional information on the agenda of the Congress is available at this
 writing.
 While information on the Congress agenda is sparse, there is reason
 to assume that the Stockholm Congress may become marked by attacks on
 U.S. foreign policy -- despite the fact that the majority of the parties
 affiliated with the S.I. have always been staunchly anti-Communist and
 generally friendly, or at least objective,toward the U.S.  These are
 likely to include first and foremost, U.S. policy on Vietnam, but pre-
 sumably also U.S. intervention in the Dominican Republic, U.S. opposition
 to the admission of Communist China to the U.N., the civil rights issue
 in the U.S., the alleged "persecution" of the anti-Vietnam "movement" in
 the U.S., the maintenance of military bases abroad (in Japan in particular),
 and others.   Concern over escalation of the war in Vietnam could produce a
 critical attitude by the current Congress toward U.S. policy with left-wing
 parties, such as the Japanese SP, being among the leaders condemning U.S.
 policy.  Even moderate European Social Democratic parties, like the Scandi-
 navian, motivated partly by fear of escalation of the Vietnamese conflict
 into a general war, and feeling pacifist and Communist pressures at home
 could become increasingly critical.   Cooperation of the French SP with the
 Communists against DeGaulle in the recent Presidential election, and simi-
 lar "pro-Popular Front" trends elsewhere, may further dilute the traditional
 anti-Communist position of the S.I.                                                    25X1CJjap

 998.               SCIENCE AND SCIENTISTS IN COMMUNIST CHINA
 SITUATION:   Communist China exploded an atomic device in October 1964
 (and another in May 1965), shocking much of the world.   Reactions ranged
 from coldly scientific commentary on the primitive nature of the device to
 laymen's private and editorial expressions of apprehension, strong concern
 and even fear.    Scientific advances had been going forward behind China's
 walls for a number of years, but much of the world was unaware of how far
 science in China had progressed until the drama of the bomb.   [The emotional
 reaction to the explosion in technically advanced countries was not unlike
 the reaction iii.'the United States to the Soviet Union's first orbiting of
 an earth satellite, Sputnik I, in October 1957.]  On the basis of available
 evidence Western experts have concluded that most of Communist China's
 scientific and technical resources are presently allocated to the further
 development of more advanced and conventional weapons programs -- as distinct
 from pure research and from industrial and other peaceful uses.
 Communist China has traveled a rocky road trying to reach scientific
 independence.   The main burden of her scientific development effort has
 been borne by older scientists and engineers trained in America and Europe
 prior to 1949, and possibly by those trained in the Soviet Union largely
 before 1960.   China's first steps in mid-20th century science were taken
 with the assistance of the Soviet Union.   In the decade between 1950 and
 1960 over 7,000 Chinese took their scientific undergraduate and graduate
 work in the USSR, and over half of that number completed their academic
 training there.   Those scientists could be playing a major role in China's
 scientific program -- unless they are hampered by regime suspicions that
 they might be pro-Soviet, or by bureaucratic controls over the science
 program.
 In-country training since the communist takeover has been of low cali-
 ber.   The dominance of the Communist Party in China's scientific life has
 been a major factor in slowing down her scientific developments, and in
 alienating the older foreign-trained Chinese scientists as well as the
 Chinese-trained younger scientists.   For example, the Party's Great Leap
 Forward (1.958-1960) set science back drastically by spawning radical train-
 ing schemes and introducing the study-work program which stressed labor
 more than education.   1961 saw education reasserting itself by increasing
 study and laboratory time and decreasing time spent by students in jobs and
 at political meetings.

 However, in late 1964 the "social rectification" program once more
 took precedence and students and graduates in all fields were sent to
 the countryside to perform manual labor (as were high party officials).
 The increasing stress on this program has been matched by increasing
 resistance by many young Chinese, particularly those in scientific
 fields, who resent the enforced periods away from their chosen work and
 their exile from urban areas which supply the textbooks, classes, labora-
 tories and the inspiration of a scientific-academic environment.   The
 young resent the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP) restrictions on higher
 scientific education and its imposition of party-chosen priority tasks
 on them.  This has created a vicious circle which inhibits the rapid
 growth of scientific research and development and creates a resentful,
 educated elite who may not always continue to be sufficiently placated
 by the prerogatives science and higher scientific education are awarded
 in China.
 The rift in Sino-Soviet relations in 1960 was a far more serious
 matter for China than for her Soviet mentors.   Unaided, China did not
 possess the technical capability to develop weapons for modern warfare.
 With the withdrawal of the Soviet Union, China has been forced to con-
 centrate on the technically-developed non-communist world. She has been
 hampered on two counts -- her own technical inadequacies (so that she
 has little or nothing to offer another nation in scientific exchanges),
 and her chronic suspicion of things foreign -- which has blocked the
 establishment of the relatively open relations which have characterized
 scientific exchanges in the free world.   China's effort to establish an
 international scientific organization independent of the Soviet's World
 Federation of Scientific Workers has apparently not been very productive.
 However, necessity has pushed China toward the non-communist, techni-
 cally advanced world and she has begun to acquire scientific materials
 and apparatus from outside the Bloc, to send science students to European
 countries for advanced study, to adapt Western scientific methods, to at-
 tend scientific conferences and even to invite Western scientists to China
 for consultation and lecture tours.   China has also used scientific and
 technological help as an instrument of foreign policy to gain access and
 influence in the less developed countries.  The extent of the help ex-
 tended by China in these "scientific exchanges" -- especially compared     25X1C10b
 to that available from advanced free world countries -- is minimal.

 Castro Letter to       Blasts
 Latin American Charges
 [The Cuban revolutionary government sent a letter
 to UN Secretary General U Thant answering the docu-
 ment containin.* the charg^s sent to the
 Concil by re;,resentati-re'a of  Latin  American  rc  e 21-
 ments -- excl- dJ.n.-Mexico.  The text of Prime
 Minister Fidel Castro follows.]
 "Your excellency, Mr. U Thant, secretary general of the United Nations:
 I am addressing you in order to give a proper answer to the letter sent
 to the Security Council chairman by representatives of Latin American
 governments, with the exception of Mexico, which, following the orienta-
 tions of the,U.S. interventionist and imperialist government, 'denounced'
 before that organization the resolutions of the first conference of soli-
 darity of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, which took
 place in Havana from 3 to 12 January 1966.  I also request that this
 answer be circulated among all the members of that organization.
 "It is incredible that these governments are so cynical as to accuse Cuba
 and the conference of solidarity of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin
 America of intervention, because tne governments on behalf of which the
 letter is signed. are pre,,: =sel;T the most servile instruments of Yankee im-
 perialism in Latin America, the majority of which unhesitatingly supported
 the criminal intervention of the Yankee troops in Santo Domingo, and only
 a few of which lodged a weak and hypocritical protest.
 "With the cowardly and shameless complicity of these same governments, the
 Yankee military occupation and oppression of that country and that brother
 Latin American people are maintained, a country in which almost daily the
 invading troops fire on the people and murder defenseless men and women.
 Some of these governments, such as Brazil, Honduras, and Costa Rica are
 participating directly in that military occupation.  The limit of cynicism
 is reached when Mr. Garcia-Godoy, a puppet without dignity or patriotism,
 signs that declaration in the name of a country which is occupied and op-
 pressed by Yankee troops and other foreign mercenary soldiers.
 "In fact, all these governments are instruments of the interference,
 domination, and exploitation of their own countries by U.S. imperialism,
 which directs their armed forces, banking institutions and trade, in a
 word, the economy of each of them.  It sets their foreign policy and
 shamelessly reserves for itself the right to occupy them militarily, as
 was done in Santo Domingo, when it deems it necessary to its exploiting
 interests.

 In collusion with governments that represent those same interests, the
 United States has conducted its openly interventionist policy in this
 hemisphere.
 "Thus, in 1954, using mercenary forces coming from bases established in
 neighboring countries, it overthrew the legitimate constitutional govern-
 ment of Guatemala, to plunge that country back into the depths of exploi-
 tation.  In 1961 it organized, financed, and directed.---with the partici-
 pation of the governments of Guatemala and Nicaragua--the mercenary
 invasion at Giron Beach.  In 1964 it perpetrated the massacre of the
 Panamanian people because they were vindicating their sovereignty over
 the Canal territory.  And in 1965, defying the protest and indignation
 of the world, it invaded and occupied Dominican territory.
 "The Latin American peoples' feeling of militant solidarity has grown,
 developed, and become more deeply entrenched in struggles against Yankee
 imperialist intervention, against Yankee occupation and colonization of
 Puerto Rico, against Yankee seizure of a portion of Panamanian territory
 in 1903; against the second Yankee intervention in Cuba in 1906 against
 Yankee intervention in Mexico in 1914 and 1917, against Yankee interven-
 tion in Haiti in 1915, against Yankee intervention in the Dominican
 Republic in 1916, against Yankee intervention in Nicaragua in 1910, 1912,
 and 1926; and against the aforementioned Yankee aggression in Guatemala
 and Cuba.
 "And today, that feeling of solidarity acquired extraordinary force and
 vigor because of the military occupation of Santo Domingo and the threat
 of intervention in any Latin American nation.  That threat was expressed
 concretely in the recent resolution in the U.S. House of Representatives,
 which said brazenly that the U.S. Government should intervene, when it
 deems it advisable, in any territory of this continent.
 "The Yankee imperialists have pursued their interventionist policy in
 Africa, Asia, and the rest of the world, in addition to Latin America.
 Yankee intervention in the Congo under the U.N. banner is an example.
 Currently, Yankee intervention against the people of South Vietnam and
 the air raids on the Democratic Republic of Worth Vietnam furnish an ex-
 ample of how the circles of the Pentagon and the North American monopolies
 carry on their interventionist policy beyond the seas and endanger world
 peace.
 "The so-called governments of Latin American countries which, alleging a
 danger to peace from the resolutions adopted at the solidarity conference
 of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, have signed that letter
 addressed to the president of the U.N. Security Council and have turned
 a deaf ear and a blind eye to the monstrous reality imposed by imperialism
 in the world of today.

 "The peoples of the Latin American countries that those governments claim
 to represent are mercilessly plundered by U.S. monopolies.  The peoples
 under those governments have a right--which they will exercise sooner
 or later--to sweep out those governments, which are traitors, and serve
 foreign interests in their own countries, and they will sweep them out
 with the most violent revolutionary action, because imperialist exploi-
 tation and, oppression is exercised increasingly by means of force, vio-
 lence, and arms, and no other possible choice is left.
 "To proclaim the right of those peoples which are oppressed and exploited
 by imperialism, with the complicity of the feudal oligarchies and the most
 reactionary classes of each of those countries-,-the privileged and abso-
 lutely minority interests which represent such governments--is not an act
 of intervention, but rather the struggle against intervention.
 "It is not just to confuse the spirit of independence with interventionism.
 "The revolutionary representatives of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and
 Latin America, who met in Havana, certainly agreed to redouble the strug?
 gle against intervention and to help people who are fighting for their
 liberation and independence.  And not only that, they also stressed that
 it is the duty of progressive states and governments to support peoples
 who are fighting against interventionist and aggressive imperialism.
 `The aid extended to peoples who are fighting for independence has well
 known historic and political precedents.
 "No one would think of saying that the French revolutionaries, who in the
 18th Century helped the North American people gain their independence from
 British colonial domination, could be accused of being interventionists.
 The peoples of France, the United States, and the entire world recognized
 the true virtue of the valiant men who fought in America. to win the in-
 dependence of the 13 colonies.
 "The militant and revolutionary solidarity of the Latin American people
 was manifested very actively in the liberating epic of Bolivar, San Martin,
 and Sucre.  Peoples of Latin America recall that solidarity with gratitude.
 No one would think of labeling the Latin American liberation movement dur-
 ing the last century as an act of intervention.
 "In 1826, Simon Bolivar called the peoples of America to the Panama Con-
 gress to discuss the best means to complete the liberation of the continent
 from Spanish colonial domination.
 "According to the opinion of Yankee imperialism and the miserable lackeys
 who signed the aforementioned letter, the Panama Congress could be con-
 sidered an infringement of the sovereignty of nations, having an openly
 interventionist nature.
 "Let imperialist aggression, oppression, and intervention cease; let the
 United States leave Dominican territory; let its troops withdraw from
 southeast Asia and Vietnam; let no more bombing strikes be carried out

 against the DRV; let the territory which was usurped in the Canal Zone
 be returned to the Panamanian people.  Stop exploiting the poor people
 of America and other parts of the world; let the United States give back
 the territory used for military bases on foreign soil, including the
 Guantanamo base; let it abandon its conspiracy in Asia, Africa, and Latin
 America.  In short, let the system of imperialist domination end.  That
 is what is demanded by the peoples and the men who legitimately represent
 the interests of the peoples.
 "The Revolutionary Government of Cuba fully supports the resolutions
 adopted by the first solidarity conference of the peoples of Asia, Africa,
 and Latin America.
 "We are not unaware, Mr. Secretary General, that the cynical statements
 made by the men who claim to be representatives of 18 peoples of Latin
 America conceal the intention of justifying future intervention by U.S.
 troops in other Latin American nations, and particularly a means for at-
 tacking Cuba when the revolutionary tide swells on this oppressed, ex-
 ploited continent and the insignificant U.S. minority -- the monopolistic
 circles that govern the United States, who are responsible for the tension
 existing in the world and responsible for aggression and interference di-
 rected against the peoples -- see the empire of their interests crumble
 at their very feet.
 "But Cuba, Mr. Secretary General, is not defended by an unarmed although
 heroic people, like the Dominican Republic.  The day this imperialism and
 its accomplices dare show their claws in our country, then the time will
 really have come in the bosom of that U.N. organization to sigh for peace,
 because the resistance they will meet will be capable of shaking the world.
 "With highest esteem, i remain attentively yours, Fidel Castro Ruz, prime
 minister of the revolutionary government."

 the Soviet delegation to the Havana conference, as a pretext for

 "...charges are being circulated that representatives of
 Soviet social organizations which took part in the work of the
 conference called for 'subversive activity, and intervention in
 the internal problems of Latin American countries,'
 "...grossly falsifying the real facts, these circles are
 publicizing that representatives of the Soviet Government
 rather than representatives of Soviet social organizations
 took part in the 'Solidarity Conference of the Peoples of
 Three Continents'.
 "Since the Soviet Union consistently in international
 relations follows a peaceful policy aimed at strengthening the
 independence and sovereignty of all nations, without interfering
 in their internal affairs, the Soviet Union has extended and
 will extend necessary help to those peoples who are victims
 of imperialistic aggression. ...The Soviet Government gives
 full support to the peoples of colonial countries who are
 attempting to obtain national freedom and independence.  The
 Soviet people have feelings of profound friendship and solidarity
 toward all peoples fighting for national freedom.  It was in
 this sense, specifically that the delegation of Soviet social
 organizations spoke at the 'Solidarity Conference of the Peoples
 of Three Continents'.  At the same time the Soviet delegation
 declared itself in favor of nations with different social
 systems basing their relations on the principle of peaceful
 coexistence, one of the fundamental principles of Soviet
 foreign policy."

 SHARIF RASHIDOV
 Candidate member of the Presidium of the Central
 Committee of the CPSU
 First Secretary of the Uzbekistan Communist Party
 Deputy of the USSR Supreme Soviet
 In his rise from the ranks of the Uzbek Party to the
 officialdom of Soviet politics, Rashidov has demonstrated both
 an aptitude for administration and pronounced talent as a
 writer and propagaudist.  These attributes combined with his
 credentials as a leader in a Soviet Asian republic have
 uniquely qualified him to serve as an instrument of Soviet,
 Afro-Asian policy.  He is today one of the leading Soviet
 personalitieo in the field of Afro-Asian affairs.
 He has been widely used to foster Soviet influence in the
 Afro-Asian world.   His pursuit of this objective has required
 extensive travel to Communist and non-Communist countries and
 led him to take a leadership role in Afro-Asian organizations.
 The highlights of his activity, which follow, have occurred
 against a background of the larger developments in Soviet,
 Afro-Asian relations..
 In 1955 he accompanied Bulganin and Khrushchev on their
 tour of India and Burma.  In 1956 he went to Karachi for the
 proclamation of Pakistan as an Islamic Republic, and later was
 Mikoyan's traveling companion on visits to India, Burma, North
 Vietnam, China and Outer Mongolia.  The following year he
 accompanied Voroshilov to Indonesia.  In December, 1957, he was
 the chief Soviet delegate to the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity
 Conference in Cairo, and has become a prominent member of the
 Soviet Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee.  In October, 1958, he
 was Chairman of the Soviet-sponsored Afro-Asian Writers'
 Conference in Tashkent, and in January, 1959, he was appointed
 Chairman of the committee set up by the Secretariat of the
 Board of the USSR Writers' Union for liaison with the Permanent
 Bureau of the Afro-Asian Writers.  The following September he
 headed the CPSU delegation to the Fifth Party Congress in
 Guinea.  In May, 1962, he led a delegation of Soviet specialists to
 Cuba to assist in irrigation and land drainage schemes and in
 June that year again visited Indonesia.  He participated in a
 Soviet economic mission to Algeria in August, 1963.  A Kenyan
 delegation met with him in Uzbek in April, 1964.  The celebration
 of the Algerian revolution was the occasion for a return trip to
 that country in October and November of 1961.   Most recently prior
 to the Havana Conference, he attended the 45th anniversary of the
 Communist Party of Indonesia in May, 1965.

 Fact Sheets
 March 1966
 Encouraging Evidence of Brazilian Recovery
 The forthcoming Second Anniversary of the revolution which resulted
 in the ouster of President Joao Goulart and the establishment of Humberto
 Castello Branco as President serves as a convenient point for stock-
 taking:  for assessing the accomplishments of Castello Branco's govern-
 ment to date and for estimating the course it is likely to take until the
 end of its writ in March 1967.
 In fact, the Revolution was hardly a revolution in the classic
 sense.  There was no bloodshed, no rioting in the streets, no battle
 lines.  In short, a few military leaders called upon Goulart to resign;
 they were joined by a substantial number of political leaders, including
 many state governors, and by a rapidly growing number of other top military
 leaders.  Goulart fled from Rio to Brasilia, where he hoped to find
 political support; finding little, he promptly left for exile in Uruguay.
 The entire affair lasted but 55 hours.  On the other hand, the Revolution
 was very real in the substantive sense.  There is no doubt that Castello
 Branco and the government which he formed were determined to work very
 fundamental changes in the economic, political, and social structure of
 the nation.  Indeed, they had little choice; the chaotic state of the
 country's economy and the growing social unrest demanded urgent and major
 reforms, and it was the purpose of the Revolution to institute them.
 It is perhaps worth recalling some of the basic facts which were
 well-publicized at the time, but which tend to drop from memory over the
 years.  The central and overwhelming fact was the disintegration of the
 Brazilian economy.  In the late 1950's, when Brazil's huge coffee exports
 were bringing a good price of the world market, the government of former
 President Juscelino Kubitschek pushed an ambitious nation-wide program to
 develop Brazil, especially its vast and virtually untouched interior.
 During this time U.S. and other foreign investors poured capital into
 Brazil to create an avalanche of new industries.  In this period of
 dizzy economic growth Brazil seemed firmly set for the long-awaited
 economic "take-off"; in one year the economy grew more than seven and one
 half percent.  However the expansion was financed in good part by infla-
 tion and in the 1960's the results of overspending by the government, of
 deficits rolled up by state-owned enterprises, and of too much borrowing
 against the future, plus a fall in world coffee prices, began to turn
 Brazil's dream of quick development into a nightmare of inflation.  This
 was compounded by a turn toward leftist nationalism after Joao Goulart
 assumed the Presidency in August 1961.
 Goulart established a severe profit remittance law, a definitely
 hostile Brazilian officialdom harassed foreign, especially U.S., investors,
 Brazilian reforms which had been promised as conditions for further U.S.

 Government loans simply were not effected, and government payrolls were
 even further padded by political appointees.  The inevitable result was
 runaway inflation; it went up 50 percent in 1962, 84 percent in 1963,
 and during the first quarter of 1964, immediately preceding the Revolu-
 tion, it reached a projected annual rate of about 144 percent.  Foreign
 investment, which had averaged US$85 million in the Kubitschek years from
 1955 to 1960, fell to US$4.5 million in 1963 and US$3.6 million in 1964.
 The economic unrest was accompanied by radical political moves by
 Joao Goulart which stirred the anxieties of major elements of Brazilian
 society.  Goulart attempted to build a political following based on
 organized labor, the peasants, students and the enlisted men and non-
 commissioned officers of the military forces (the latter served equally
 to offset opposition to Goulart among the military leadership).  Parti-
 cularly in his  dealings with organized labor, Goulart appeared to favor
 and assist the Communists.  As a result of his activities there developed
 a widespread belief among Brazilians of diverse political persuasion
 that the Goulart government had clearly demonstrated its intent to alter
 radically the legal and power structure by means of agitation, strikes,
 military insubordination, and at least tactical collaboration with trained
 subversives of various Communist groups... all for the purpose of perpet-
 uating himself in power.
 The background to the Revolution, then, was an economy literally
 on the brink of bankruptcy, a government which many thought was deliberately
 perverting the democratic system which brought it to power, an impotent
 party system which had almost paralyzed the Congress' ability.to protect
 the people's interests, corruption in government beyond bounds, and a
 growing social disorder threatening to lead to civil war, to the ultimate
 benefit only of the Communists.
 The overthrow of Goulart was received with widespread popular sup-
 port in the major cities, in contrast with the apathy, disorganization
 and indifference displayed by those groups which the Goulart regime con-
 sidered its bulwarks:  students, trade-union rank and file, enlisted men,
 peasants.  This ready acceptance not only avoided violent strife; it
 permitted the Castello Branco government to concentrate on economic and
 social reforms without being obliged greatly to alter the norms of polit-
 ical                      democracy in Brazil.  The field of activity which received most
 attention, and which has shown the most impressive results was the national
 economy.  On the domestic front, inflation was held to 87% for 1964, and
 was cut to about 45% in 1965.  At the end of 1965 it was running at a
 rate of about 2% per month,or 24% per annum, which gives  high hopes
 that it may be further reduced to 20% during 1966.  Cutting down infla-
 tion was absolutely essential, but it has worked considerable hardship on
 various sectors of the economy.  The effort has meant holding down civil
 service and military wages, eliminating subsidies and raising public
 service rates, higher taxes, and strict controls on wages and prices,
 among other measures.  Admittedly the change has been difficult, but the
 elimination of many of the distortions which had developed in the national
 economy -- for example one third of the government budget deficit used to

 be due solely to subsidies to the antiquated railway system -- and this
 realignment and rationalization will be of immense benefit in the long
 run.
 Other reforms in the domestic economic front include:  a thorough-
 going reform of the personal income tax collection (which will hit, inci-
 dentally, the rich -- who have more successfully evaded taxes in the
 past -- much harder than the poor),complete with an extensive electronic
 computer system which will keep track of who pays what he should and who
 doesn't; a completely reorganized banking system with Brazil's first
 central bank; greatly increased development grants by the federal govern-
 ment to the regional and state authorities for spurring local economic
 development; and a reform of the stock market, converting it from a
 somnolent instrument of an economic oligarchy to an active, policed, and
 disciplined source of investment capital.  The result in 1965 has been
 an estimated overall gain of 5% in the gross national product -- a
 respectable figure for any country and a really impressive one considering
 that it had been 1% in 1963, less than the population growth rate of 3%.
 The recovery of Brazil's external economic position has been even
 more impressive, having been transformed in two years from a shambles
 to a broadly based and internationally credit-worthy structure.  The
 Castello Branco regime inherited a treasury totally depleted of its
 foreign exchange reserves and gold stocks and, furthermore, in arrears
 on its payments on foreign debts.   This situation has now been reversed
 to the point that Brazil can boast of a foreign exchange reserve of over
 US$300 million -- due principally to a significant increase in exports
 and to substantial loans from the United States, the Inter-American
 Development Bank, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and
 other agencies.   It is worth noting that these same sources had previously
 been closed to Brazil because of its gross economic mismanagement.  The
 government has changed the profit remittance law, greatly easing the
 situation for potential foreign investors, and it has negotiated an in-
 vestment insurance agreement with the United States as further encourage-
 ment to the influx of foreign capital.  However, these measures are just
 beginning to take effect, as evidenced by announcements by both Ford and
 Volkswagen of substantial expansions of their plants in Brazil, by a
 US$96 million investment by Union Carbide and Phillips Petroleum in
 major plastic and fertilizer projects, and by a joint Brazil-U.S. iron
 ore venture  involving the Hanna Mining Company of Cleveland,Ghio, which
 will include a $150 million port designed to double Brazil's iron ore
 exports in five years.   If these should be the forerunners of a return
 to former foreign investment rates, then Brazil may well finally "take

 continued political stability.  Immediately after the Revolution, the

 revolutionary aims of the government and gave it the necessary power
 carry them out.  That the housecleaning was not entirely impartial wasundoubtedly inevitable.  However it did manage to serve its basic purpose
 without being permitted to go to extremes.  The government continued to
 work through the already elected Congress where, despite the purge,
 partisans of the old regime -- mainly members of the Partido Social
 Democratico (PSD) and the Partido Trabalhista Brasileiro (PTB) -- formed
 the most substantial bloc.
 A further reform was undertaken in the student field, which had
 been heavily infiltrated by Communists long before the revolution.  Com-
 munists held control of most of the local, state, and national student
 organizations.  The leaders of the Revolution determined to render student
 organizations as apolitical as possible in order to strengthen the
 university's role as a place of learning and to raise academic standards.
 To this end a new student organization was established to replace the
 National Student Union (UNE) which was strongly influenced by the Com-
 munists.  Federal financial support was withdrawn from the UNE and given,
 instead, to the new student organization.  This aroused criticism among
 the students, who apparently felt that a purge of the UNE directorate
 would have sufficed.  A Communist-led effort to boycott elections of
 officers for the new, apolitical student organization in the Fall of
 1965 failed, however, and it now has the support of the great majority
 of the students.
 The political stability of the nation was seriously imperiled,
 however, by the election on 4 October 1965 of governors of eleven of the
 twenty two states.  The overall election results were not unfavorable to
 the government.  However, in the two most important states where elections
 were being held -- Minas Gerais and Guanabara (the former Federal
 district of Rio de Janeiro) -- candidates of opposition parties were
 elected.  This provoked howls of protest from "hard line" elements of the
 army who perceived a real danger of the return to positions of influence
 of precisely those persons against whom the Revolution had been directed.
 The situation was greatly aggravated by the sudden return from exile of
 ex-President Kubitschek.  For a few days wild rumors circulated of coups
 d'6tat led by the "hard line" military officers against the Castello
 Branco government, which staunchly declared that the duly elected offi-
 cials would be permitted to take office.  Under pressure from the "hard
 liners7P the President demanded from the Congress broad new powers for
 federal intervention in the States to prevent or suppress serious internal
 disorder.  Congress delayed action, however, and the government was
 obliged to promulgate a second "Institutional Act" which dissolved all
 political parties, gave the President power to declare a state of siege
 and to rule by decree for periods of up to six months, and which estab-
 lished the principle of indirect election of the President.

 It was undoubtedly regrettable that recourse was had to extra-
 ordinary procedures rather than persuasion, and comment from abroad has
 been critical even from those with strong sympathies for the basic aims
 of the regime.  It cannot be maintained, however, that Brazil has fully
 recovered, economically or politically; what is needed is a period of
 political peace'?in which to complete the still only half-achieved program
 of stabilization.  Moreover, President Castello Branco is the antithesis
 of a personal dictator.  He has been a moderating influence on his
 military colleagues and can be expected to use his new powers with
 restraint.  In the second Institutional Act he expressly forbids succeeding
 himself as president.  Personal freedom has not been adversely affected
 and freedom of the press remains intact, witness the vigorous criticisms
 of the government published every day.  Interestingly, the second Insti-
 tutional Act was publicly endorsed by a wide variety of Brazilian groups:
 the internal press, for the most part; commercial and industrial organi-
 zations; women's groups; and trade unions (including the nationwide
 Industrial Workers' Confederation).  Conversely, most of the opposition
 was silent and the general public either mildly in favor or apathetic.
 The abolition of the existing 13 or so political parties has been
 followed by the creation of two officially approved political groupings,
 one pro-government (the National Renovation Alliance - ARENA) and the
 other the opposition group (the Brazilian Democratic Movement - MDB).
 On 5 February 1966 the Brazilian Government issued its "Third
 Institutional Act," establishing dates and circumstances of congressional,
 gubernatorial and presidential elections this year.  On 3 September
 elections will be held for the governors of 11 of the 22 states, with the
 voting to be by the state legislatures rather than by popular vote.  On
 3 October the next President will be chosen by the present Congress;
 again this will be an indirect election.  Finally, direct congressional
 elections are set for 15 November 1966.  The opposition party has already
 strongly criticized the indirect election feature of the new Act, and
 this will undoubtedly be an issue in the forthcoming elections.
 Despite its impressive advances in economic and political reform,
 there are still serious outstanding problems facing Brazil;  one of the
 biggest is agrarian reform.  Although the revolutionary government
 early issued a "Land Statute" outlining its intentions, little has been
 done since then except to begin a thorough study of the true nature and
 extent of the problem.  The government has made clear it has no intention
 of expropriating private lands forming part of going agricultural concerns.
 However a central feature of the law would make available to landless
 farmers potentially tillable or otherwise useful land, government-owned
 or private, now lying idle.  Other efforts are being directed to improving
 their use of the land and tools presently available to them.  Perhaps the
 most important answer to the problem of land-hungry peasants is the building
 of highways and access roads into the enormous isolated but potentially
 arable areas of the country.
 New hope for agrarian reform was aroused by the recent appointment

 of Ney Braga as Minister for Agriculture.  A young leader of the former
 Christian Democratic party, and dynamic former governor of Parana state,
 Braga is well qualified to bring new life to the program.
 Education remains perhaps the most fundamental problem for Brazil.
 With a literacy rate of only 55%, with tremendous shortages of schools
 and teachers, the nation's further development will hinge in large part
 on a greatly expanded educational effort.
 The dampening of the inflationary spiral has resulted in a slight
 downturn in real wages.  Hopefully this trend will be reversed as the
 economic upswing progresses; if not the Branco government will face
 mounting opposition from the workers.
 A final problem to be mentioned is that of resurgent nationalism.
 The lowering of the barriers to foreign investment has already brought
 cries of protest from several quarters.  The right wing of the military
 forces is a traditional source of nationalism in Brazil and this sentiment
 is coupled with criticism of the government's allegedly gentle treatment
 of corruption and with assertions that the government's disinflationary
 campaign is fostering unwarranted criticism of the military.  Although
 these elements of the military do not represent a sizeable political
 force, their criticisms freqently supplement demagogic campaigns of
 other nationalist and opportunistic groups and constitute a source of
 constant harassment for the government.
 As can be seen, all these problems revolve around the task of
 economic rehabilitation; without first stability and then renewed economic
 growth, there can be no political solution.  If stability and then growth
 can be achieved there is little reason to fear for democracy, which has
 long been strongly rooted in Brazil.  The patience and understanding
 which the people have shown have been remarkable.  The undeniable suc-
 cesses thus far achieved can well be attributed as much to good following
 as to good leadership.
 The democratic aspirations of President Castello Branco can best
 be understood from a statement he made to the Rio Conference of the
 Organization of American States in November 1965:
 "Democracy should not be a mere show of appearances, in
 which liberty is confused with indiscipline, and social
 injustice is perpetuated, masked by the easy promises of
 demagogues. Democracy should consist of the democratization
 of opportunities for access to land, housing and education;
 the promotion of development through austerity, savings and
 continued effort, and vigilance against the enemies of the
 open society, who avail themselves of the franchise granted
 by democracy to destroy it.

 institutions.  Less than two years ago we were aware of the

 and the sounds of economic and social chaos.
 To a formal democracy, we shall join a democracy meant
 for the continued improvement of the people's welfare.  It

 Intellectuals and the Party in East European Communist Countries:
 Czechoslovakia
 Attacks against intellectuals across the board were made by the
 Czech CP in November and December 1965.   In an address before the
 Union of Czechoslovak Stage and Film Artists, Politburo member Hendrych
 discussed the "rather serious ideological and artistic problems" con-
 cerning them.  After praising the positive results of past work in help-
 ing to forge a socialist society, Hendrych discusses i. a. films and
 plays which "went beyond the borderline of criticism, from exaggeration
 to deformation, and from socialist positions to the other side."
 In the sphere of literature, the revisionist monthly Tvar and the
 frequently critical monthly Knizni Kultura, have been discontinued. The
 failure of the regime to provide satisfactory reasons for ending the
 magazines' publication gives rise to the strong suspicion that it was
 a measure to limit the dissemination of the works of the young writers
 who are increasingly critical of the regime.
 East Germany
 Signs of a possible cultural detente between the two halves of
 Germany during most of 1965 changed into a ringing revival of the cold
 war climate in November-December.  The suppression of the works of the
 young poet, Wolf Biermann, was one of the early manifestations of this
 re-emphasis of Stalinist ways.  Attacks on Biermann and other writers
 and film-makers were used as a vehicle for lashing out against "ideo-
 logical co-existence," skepticism (vs. wholehearted acceptance of the
 resr~i.rne) ,  tail-  rev  ; i.o.rr.i_;rb tendencies.   In Neues Deutschland (ND), Polit-
 buro member Erich Honecker expressed particular sensitivity to the
 "enemy's" arguments which lead cultural workers to "uncertainty about
 the correctness of our socialist road."  The dismissal on 12 January
 of Min. Of Culture Bentzien was another indication of the Ulbricht re-
 gime's resumption of a hard line on cultural matters.
 Some writers, notably Christa Wolf, spoke out at the party plenum
 in defense of the artists who had been attacked.   Several writers de-
 fended themselves in ND.   But the party's response to these defenses in-
 dicates that more pressures on writers and artists are to be expected.
 The most comprehensive article on the East German situation (and
 indeed, the situation in any of the bloc countries) is in the Literary
 Supplement of the London Times of 13 January 1966.   (See Press Comment
 20 January 1966.)

 Poland
 A significant and stirring development has been the recent publi-
 cation of Adam Schaff's book, "Marxism and the Human Individual." Schaff,
 the director of Warsaw's Institute of Philosophy and Sociology, examines
 inter alia the alientation of the individual in the socialist society.
 Thus, what the Soviet authors are accused of insinuating in their novels,
 Schaff virtually comes out flatly with in his sociological study.   Schaff
 has been attacked for his views by high CP officials.  How successful
 his defense will be is yet to be determined.
 A companion development has been the arrest of 7 writers during
 1965.   They were tried and sentenced for slandering the Polish state in
 their manuscripts which were smuggled out of the country and published in
 Western Europe.
 Rumania
 "Retrospective" painting and plastic arts came under the fire of CP
 officials at the turn of the year.   Exhibited works were criticized as
 being confused and artistically poor, adoptions of unassimilated alien
 influences, purposeless efforts, and immature.   The significance of this
 development is that it reverses an atmosphere of relative tolerance in
 the cultural field which the party had promoted.   It probably means that
 an effort will now be made to return to socialist realism in art.   As in
 the USSR, however, there is some journalistic support for a continuance
 of the new, more liberal policies.
 Hungary
 The General Meeting of the Hungarian Writers' Association, which
 was held at the end of November 1965, was distinguished by its dullness,
 apparently reflecting careful planning.   Socialist realism was alluded
 to, but apparently not used as a term in discussing the desired orienta-
 tion of literature.   Reference was made to despair and indifference as
 common reactions to present difficulties.  And caution was raised against
 "... liberalism, an uncritical spirit, (and) blind acceptance" which is
 the apparent result of contacts with non--socialist countries.  As a re-
 sult, more care is apparently to be used in the selection of books from
 non-socialist countries for publication in Hungarian.   Dobozy, the Sec-
 retary General of the Writers' Association, said significantly:   "Our
 literature possesses a wide variety of ideological colors....   We draw
 the line only at political opposition or at writings which offend against
 accepted canons of taste."
 A note of contrast should be added.   The Yugoslav authorities faced
 a similar problem with the young author, M.Bulatovic, who was in Western
 Europe at the turn of the year.   ]3ulatovic severely criticized the Yugo-
 slav society both in interviews and in books to be published abroad. The
 Yugoslav response was to dismiss Bulatovic with a few words of condemnation

 March 1966
 Background of relations between the CPSU party and intellectuals in the
 Soviet Union.
 The role of Andrey Zhdanov in Party-intellectual relationshps was
 of great importance between 1946 and the death of Stalin.  With some
 fluctuations in intensity, Zhdanov throttled free expression and at-
 tempted to harness writers to the service of the state.  He assaulted
 "cosmopolitanism," an action equivalent to anti-Semitism.  Although he
 died in 1948, his influence was such that the entire period from 1946
 to 1953 was known as the "zhdanovshchina," a synonym for cultural terror.
 Thus, the mention in Izvestiya of 25 Feb 66 of Zhdanov on his 70th birth-
 day as "a true son of the people" could well be interpreted as a threat
 by the regime to increase its restrictive measures unless the intellec-
 tuals get back into line.
 Upon Stalin's death a short-lived surge in freer intellectual ex-
 pression was observed.   It was curtailed in mid-1953, resumed in 1954,
 accelerated in early 1956, halted in late 1956, reversed in mid-1957,
 expanded in 1959, halted in late 1962, cautiously resumed in mid-1963
 after which it increased somewhat until October 1964 when Khrushchev was
 ousted.
 During the first 4 months of the regime of Brezhnev and Kosygin the
 intellectuals substantially stepped up their outpouring of anti-Stalinist
 expression.
 The first sign of a reaction against the intellectuals was detected
 in early March, 1965, in a published report of the RSFSR Writers' Con-
 gress.   There, to gasps of dismay from the liberals, Soviet literature
 and films were criticized by the conservatives who quoted the Chinese
 Communists.   From then on, an increasingly bitter exchange between the
 more liberal and the conservative organs was witnessed.   It was capped
 and epitomized by two articles, one by Sergei Pavlov, the head of the
 Komsomol, and the other by the 60-year-old Aleksey Rumyantsev, the chief
 editor of Pravda.   Pavlov, writing in Pravda of 29 Aug, lashed out at
 movies, literature, and the theater for the unhealthy criticism which
 was engendering "nihilism" in youth, and he pointed out the need for
 caution in dealing with the cult of the personality (i.e., attacks on
 Stalin).   Rumyantsev in Pravda of 9 September, apparently in rebuttal
 to Pavlov and others, stated his belief that nihilism is engendered by
 hushing up and glossing over difficulties, not by the passionate effort
 to expose wrongs in order to set them right; to underscore the meaning
 of his wordsi he went down the list of the liberals under attack and de-
 fended them.
 Within the next 10 to 12 days, Sinyavsky and Daniel were picked up
 by the KGB, and Rumyantsev was removed from his job.   (Rumyantsev now
 has an insignificant job with the Academy of Sciences.)  Pavlov, on the
 other hand, is still the chief of the Komsomol and he has spoken out
 further in the vein of the hard line.  The hard line, especially in

 Izvestiya, became dominant and more strident in Soviet media.   In
 January in Pravda, for the first time in years, "cosmopolitanism" was
 referred to as something to be fought.  And, seemingly to bring the
 circle to a close, the above-noted reference to Zhdanov was made in
 Izvestiya.
 Some feeble opposition to the above-noted trend has been ob-
 served...Nouyy Mir, the liberal writers' organ, has defied the implied
 ban on publication of unacceptable material.   Individual writers, such
 as Paustovskiy, have protested against the Sinyavsky and Daniel case.
 And Pravda held back for some time before joining the ranks of the hard
 liners attacking the two.   Pravda also commemorated the 20th Party Con-
 gress, implicitly supporting de-Stalinization; but it also praised
 Zhdanov.

 Komsomol'skaya Pravda
 Moscow, 29 December 1965
 SPEECH BY S.P. PAVLOV TO THE
 EIGHTH PLENUM OF THE CENTRAL
 COMMITTEE OF THE KOMSOMOL
 -USSR-
 [Following are excerpts from a translation
 of a speech by the First Secretary of the
 Central Committee of the Komsomol, Comrade
 S.P. Pavlov in the Russian-language news-
 paper Komsomol'sk aya Pravda (Komsomol Pravda),
 Moscow, 29 December 1965, page 3.]
 "Comrades!   The education of the younger generation is now the
 center of attention of the Communist Party, the Leninist Komsomol and
 all ideological institutes in the country."
 "Strictly speaking, education in the traditions is one of the means
 for solving the chief task:   the education of man -- the fighter, citizen
 and patriot.   It was specifically this guide that was used by the bureau
 of the Central Committee of the Komsomol in presenting the given question
 for discussion at the plenum.   In addition other circumstances were taken
 into account that also confirmed the rightfulness and even the necessity
 of posing such a question today."
 "It is typical that. recently two tendencies of bourgeois propaganda
 have become absolutely clearly observable:  the first is to set the
 Komsomol against the youth and the second is to set the party against
 the Komsomol and the younger generation against the older.
 "At the same time our enemies strive to utilize the deficiencies in
 our educational work and to rely on the negative phenomena existing among
 our young people.
 "What are the causes for similar phenomena?  -- ;Say;s the speaker --
 apparently one of the causes is that at some stage we relaxed the educa-
 tional work among the youth.   Some of our Komsomol organizations in
 reality began to speak more of percentages and tone, of the head of
 cattle and of ferrous concrete and showed little concern for man and the
 sentiment that is typical of a given section of our youth and of relations
 between young people."

 "Comrades!   Patriotism and humanitarian education of our young people
 are inseparable.   It seems that the enthusiasm of a certain group of
 our young people for modern bourgeois art has its reasons.   One of
 these reasons is the deficiency in propaganda of our age old culture,
 the culture of the peoples of the USSR, and national popular tradi-
 tions in art, the knowledge of which instills a natural feeling of
 national pride and Soviet patriotism."
 "It would be a great error to believe that the fact in itself of
 living in the Soviet country under conditions of socialist reality pre-
 supposes  the presence of a communist world outlook in a young person.
 There is no doubt that loyalty to the ideas of communism lives in the
 hearts of the overwhelming majority of young Soviet boys and girls.   But
 far from all of them clearly and precisely understand what communist ide-
 ology is, what it means to be a conscientious and consistent communist
 and how to bring up in oneself the qualities of a fighter for our re-
 volutionary ideals.   It would also be erroneous to believe that the
 growth of political consciousness and ideological convictions in a
 young person is always directly proportional to the growth of his gen-
 eral educational and cultural level.   Today our task is not simply to
 train a highly qualified and educated young worker, graingrower and
 specialist but, first of all, to instill in each of them the qualities
 of a communist-Leninist.
 "The most important events in the political life of the country --
 the 20th, 21st and 22nd party congresses and the decisions of the recent
 plenums of the CC CPSU, directed toward the reestablishment of the Lenin-
 ist norms of party life, the expansion of socialist democracy and the
 surmounting of subjectivism in the approach to economic and political
 problems -- created favorable conditions for the comprehensive develop-
 ment and formulation of human personality.
 "It is natural that these events promote the growth of the creative
 activities of the young peoples and arouse in them aspirations for inde-
 pendent thinking, the comparison and analysis of facts and the desire to
 perceive more profoundly the concept of what is taking place.
 "Under these conditions the responsibility of all ideological in-
 stitutes for the education of the younger generation is increasing as
 never before.   This is why I would like to dwell in a somewhat more
 detailed manner on the role that belongs to literature and art that
 are, as a result of their emotional possibilities, the most effective
 means of influencing the minds and hearts of the young people.
 "Today, at the plenum we cannot but express a number of fundamental
 remarks on certain tendencies, holding a position in our literature and
 art and preventing, from our point of view, Soviet youth from examining
 objectively the many features of our reality and from adopting correct
 ideological positions.

 "With the blessings of the editors of Novyy Mir (New World) and
 from the pages of many journals a flood of so called "camp" literature
 has literally gushed forth.  We cannot but be disturbed that the place
 of true heroes, people capable of active actions and struggles and feats
 is being occupied by politically amorphous personalities, locked in a
 shell of individual experiences and flaunting their public and civic
 passiveness.
 "The journal Yunost'  (Youth) particularly zealously produces such
 heroes, if one may call them that.   It recently published a novel by
 Anatoliy Gladilin Istoriya odnoy kompanii (The Story of One Crowd).
 "Vodka, money,  'chuvikhi,' second hands clothes -- this exhausts
 the spiritual interests of the heroes of the novel.  Here, for instance,
 is a letter which is sent by one of Gladilin's heroes to his friend:
 'TtOld Shoe! I often see the Baron.  He's got it made!   The pay is
 good.   Zvonok left the institute.  Alla is buying up second hand clothes
 from the profiteers, etc.
 "'Kol'ka greetings!
 "'We are already in Voronezh.  We spent the night in the forest,
 talked about you, drank vodka and smoked 'Trezor.'  At night there is
 such jazz -- if you could only hear it.  We were in Penza, but there
 is nothing there, and the town is spiteful-,  but Tambov though we liked;
 in particular, we liked the 'Tambov girls; we probably will never again
 see such girls though it is true that if you look at it then it is no
 worse in Voronezh.   Yes, in Tambov there is a lot of second hand clothes:
 ten kinds of stretch socks; there were T-shirts for sale; we found
 'Elastik' stretch stockings for Lyubasha.   (Yes, here they have such
 sweaters; today we saw one for 32 rubles in large knit with wild catonic
 coloring)   (And what wines they have here!)
 "'We have 25 rubles.  We are looking for a way out of the situation.
 Well, so long.  Write how you relaxed on Saturday.   Pass on greetings to
 all.
 "'We are now going to see her ... you know yourself who, and then
 will move on to the 'Rossiya' bar.
 "As you can see it is difficult to establish the difference between
 these two letters.   The difference is that the second letter was written
 not by the literary hero but by a real person, a constant subscriber to
 the journal Yunost'.
 "This letter was forwarded to the Central Committee of the Komsomol
 by Boris Grigor'yevich Vodichkin from Kuybyshev.  He has a seventeen year
 old son for whom he subscribes to the journal Yunost'.   He recently by

 chance stumbled on his son's correspondence with his friends.  At first
 he could not understand the origin of this foppish attack.   He began
 himself to read the journal regularly, after which he sent an indignant
 letter to the Central Committee of the Komsomol, erroneously assuming
 that Yunost' is a Komsomol journal.
 "Recently, the attacks against socialist realism and ambiguous
 expressions on truth in art and the fact that only an artist can evaluate
 a work of art, etc. have appeared more frequently.   In general the 'ideas'
 are not new.  What causes alarm is the fact that these 'ideas,' fixed up
 and touched up, are more and more actively forced, cultivated and justi-
 fied by some people.
 "Recently, the journal Yunost' published a retort by the young
 satirist Rozovskiy,  'Whom Do You Initate in Your Silly Endeavor?' that
 again categorically and loudly maintains that only talent can judge talent
 and that only an artist can evaluate works of art.   This is an incorrect,
 harmful position foreign to us.   In essence Rozovskiy places literature
 and the arts above the people and threatens principally important Leninist
 tenants on the national character of literature.
 "Since when have the vulgarization of our reality, indiscriminate
 running down of the achievements of our system, sick skepticism and cheap
 grumbling as a result of present difficulties been considered as civic
 courage?  If this is courage, then what is political immaturity?  We did
 not set it as our task to make an exhaustive analysis of the situation in
 literature and art; we wanted to focus your attention on a number of tend-
 encies that interfere with the cause of the communist education of the
 youths.  Our position proceeds from the requirements of Lenin and our
 party toward socialist literature and art, and this position of ours also
 proceeds from long standing traditions of the work by the Komsomol with
 the creative youth of the country.   This is the constant support of
 writers, composers, artists and workers in the film and theater, main-
 taining firm party positions and using in their work the method of social-
 ist realism.   If we take into consideration the fact that the Komsomol has
 at its disposal seventeen journals with a single edition of five million
 copies, 108 central and local newspapers published in 24 languages with
 a single edition of 10 million, television, radio and cinema and that the
 "Molodaya gvardiya" publishing house of the Central Committee of the
 Komsomol annually publishes 37 million books, then it becomes obvious
 what a powerful ideological weapon we have at our disposal.
 "How we will use this weapon is another matter.  We propagandize
 the talented and ideologically convinced poet inexcusably little and at
 the same time endlessly crowd around two or three names that have set
 our teeth on edge.
 "Today we must present a serious rebuke to the Komsomol press and
 the young editors in radio and television for the unjustified timidity
 in evaluating individual works of literature and art and in the formula-
 tion around them of public opinion.   Sometimes as a result of their

 inexperience, a lack of esthetic taste and the inability to orient
 themselves correctly in the tremendous flood of literature the young
 people follow false fashions, forgetting the wise Russian saying that
 all that glitters is not gold.
 "Guided by clear cut party attitudes in the area of literature
 and art, the Central Committee of the Komsomol together with the
 unions of composers, writers, cinematographers, artists and journal-
 ists conducted and continues to conduct certain work with the young
 creative intelligentsia.
 "This includes regular seminars and meetings between the Komsomol
 aktive and young poets and artists, the organization of creative re-
 ports, business trips and art exhibits, and finally the establishment
 of the Leninist Komsomol Prize for the best work in literature and art
 for Soviet youth.
 "All of this is undoubtedly good.  However, the results of our
 efforts will be ten or a hundred times better if the Central Committees
 of the Komsomols in the union republics, kraykoms and obkoms will de-
 vote maximum attention to the creativity and the living conditions of
 young poets, prose writers, cinematographers, actors, etc.
 "The recently held seminar of young writers in Chita showed that
 works about the Komsomol are completely absent in the works of the
 young writers.   Of all of the works discussed not one was devoted to
 the given subject.  Apparently this is not by chance.   Komsomol obkoms
 and kraykoms often are completely ignorant of the young writers:   how
 they live, what they are working on and what their creative plans are.
 "We have begun to forget the good Komsomol traditions when the
 manuscripts of the young poets and writers were reviewed at open
 Komsomol meetings and when the young poets and writers read their works
 at the Komsomol obkom and kraykom offices in order to receive friendly
 comments and comradely advice.  What is more, many Komsomol leaders are
 not even familiar with their native writers and their books, as the
 saying goes, 'They have not even sniffed these books.'
 "Comrades!   Never before has one generation reaped so many fruits
 of the lengthy revolutionary struggle as ours has.   The most precious
 stock and 'dowry' of the Soviet youth is the economic might of our Home-
 land, the revolutionary experience of the previous generations and the
 life of the best representatives that have become the guiding star for
 millions of young boys and girls.
 "We are proud of our genealogical and ideological proximity to those
 who laid the foundation of socialism and who in the hour of trial bore
 the unprecedented brunt of the military toil, suffered great sacrifices
 and shared the glory of Victory.   Children being in the closest contact
 with their 'fathers' draw experience from them, gathered through decades,
 and arm themselves with their world outlook.  The children worthily carry
 on the traditions of our fathers.

 DECLARATION ON COLONIALISM
 Joint Statement adopted by the Fourth Congress of the
 Socialist International and the Asian Socialist Conference
 (London, 12-16 July, 1955)
 "2.  The right of peoples to self-determination, provided
 that it does not infringe the same right for other peoples,
 and that it does not prejudice their freedom or the peace
 of the world, is a basic principle of the democratic
 system of society. The Charter of the United Nations
 recognizes this right.
 "3.  Self-determination, hitherto regarded by imperialist
 nations as a privilege, must be exercised as a right by
 colonial and dependent peoples and satellite countries."
 "5.  The colonial rulers and imperialist Powers still
 cling to their 'sacred mission', whether in its old or
 new interpretations, only to justify their self-interest and
 for safe-guarding their domination as long as possible."
 "7.  The struggle against colonial rule is in essence the
 human protest against poverty, misery, degradation and
 indignity, which any form of imperialism necessarily
 entails for the peoples under it.
 "8.  But national freedom is only a means to human freedom.
 The struggle against colonialism should aim at the emanci-
 pation from any form of exploitation of man by man and at
 social and economic equality of the suffering masses and
 the establishment of a democratic Socialist society."
 "10. All genuine democrats full.y share with these fighters
 their passionate desire for human rights and freedom, and
 therefore associate themselves with the struggle against
 colonial and any other form of oppression and for a world
 order free from slavery, hunger, political terror and war."
 SOCIALIST POLICY FOR THE
 UNDERDEVELOPED TERRITORIES
 A Declaration of Principles
 Adopted by the Second Congress of the Socialist International
 (Milan., 17-21 October, 1951)
 1.  The Socialist International aims at the liberation of
 all men from economic, spiritual and political bondage and
 the creation of a world society based on the principles of
 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000300060005-9
 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000300060005-9
 freedom and equality and of voluntary cooperation between
 free peoples.
 "The Socialist International seeks the freedom of all
 nations.  It rejects every form of racial discrimination
 and every system which divides the world into superior and
 inferior nations.
 "2.   To this end it seeks to establish in every country
 equal citizenship and democratic institutions through
 which to maintain and expand the political freedom and
 economic wellbeing of all the people.
 "It seeks to create between countries relationships
 which express the fundamental unity of all mankind and
 which recognize the just aspirations of all people to a
 full and free life.  It recognizes the value of different
 cultures and seeks to promote human dignity in all lands.
 "3.   The Socialist International therefore rejects without
 reservation any form of capitalist imperialism which binds
 peoples in the chains of political domination and economic
 exploitation and which thrives on the odious myth of racial
 superiority.
 "It rejects, too, the tyranny which Communist imperialism
 seeks to impose upon the peoples of the world. The oppression
 and exploitation of any people, whatever ideological justifi-
 cation may be sought for it, is diametrically opposed to the
 principles of democratic Socialism.
 04.   The Socialist International recognizes the upsurge of
 national consciousness as a stage in the emancipation of
 nations.  Communist propaganda attempts to divide the world
 by exploiting nationalist fervor  for its own ends. Socialists
 condemn chauvinistic nationalism because it denies international
 solidarity.  They regard the development of democratic Socialism
 as essential to the satisfaction of genuine national aspirations
 within the framework of an international community."
 "6.  Socialists, in their struggle to achieve full self-
 government for the dependent territories, as well as the
 governments concerned, must give due consideration to the
 growing interrelations of the nations of the world, in order
 to reach peaceful cooperation between free peoples."
 I.
 The Task of Socialists in the Underdeveloped Territories
 "2.  For economic development to go forward people must not
 only desire progress; their social, economic, legal and political

 institutions must be favorable to it.  Fundamental changes
 will be necessary.  Economic relationships which rob the
 individual of the fruits of his labor have to be broken.
 Bonds of caste have to be abolished.  Legal and political
 systems which concentrate power in the hands of a small
 class, intent on maintaining its own wealth and privileges,
 have to be removed.
 "Under reactionary, selfish or corrupt leaders, the
 masses remain apathetic and dispirited or their misery
 becomes fertile ground for any ideology which holds out to
 them promise, however false, of means towards a better life.
 Given vigorous and honest leadership, the masses can be
 inspired with an enthusiasm for human progress.  Socialists
 in the underdeveloped territories aim at providing that
 creative leadership."
 Socialists in the underdeveloped territories strive to
 establish governments convinced of the need for agrarian
 reforms.  Land redistribution is of vital importance in
 many countries where living standards and productive capacities
 are low and where a large section of the labor force is
 employed in agriculture.  Thus Socialists expect the govern-
 ments of the underdeveloped countries to introduce legislation
 to abolish agrarian feudalism    to set up a system of owner-
 farmers wherever suitable and to assure to the tenant farmers
 security of tenure and a fair share of the increased yield of
 their labor.  This would induce them to invest in new
 ventures, to adopt improved techniques, to put forth
 intensive efforts to increase production, and so to raise
 their standard of living.  Finally, waste lands will have to
 be brought into cultivation.
 "5.  Socialists seek action which will provide the cultivators
 with facilities for borrowing the funds necessary to enable
 them to carry on operations with adequate equipment and
 without a heavy debt burden.   They promote the introduction
 of the agricultural unit which will maximize output and
 the establishment of suitable co-operative organizations.
 "6.  Socialists work for development programs which will
 bring to domestic industry in peasant economies better
 appliances and improved techniques both of production and
 of organization, and which will build up, where appropriate,
 industries under planned direction.  They support action
 which will assist the necessary flow of capital to their
 countries, provided there is full protection against imperialism
 in any form."

 THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL
 ON
 THE UNITED NATIONS
 Statement adopted by the Fourth Congress of the Socialist
 International (London, 12-16 July, 1955)
 "The Socialist International has consistently affirmed
 its support for the United Nations Charter and Organization.
 The United Nations Organization provides, in spite of short-.
 comings, an essential machinery for the furtherance of
 peace and international cooperation.  One of its prime
 functions is to provide a meeting ground where opposing
 powers can come together to seek a peaceful solution of
 conflicts.  For these purposes the United Nations must
 be of world-wide character and not an exclusive association
 of like-minded nations.  The Socialist International accordingly
 urges the admission to the United Nations of all states which
 are willing to respect the United Nations Charter."
 THE SOCIALIST INTERNATIONAL
 ON
 THE INTERNATIONAL SITUATION
 Resolution adopted by the fourth Congress of the Socialist
 International (London, 12-16 July, 1955)
 Disarmament
 "Rearmament is the result of suspicion and political
 tension.    Consequently the efforts to ease tension must
 go hand in hand with the work of the disarmament commission.
 "Socialists aim at a universal system of disarmament
 under effective international supervision and control not
 limited either to certain weapons or certain areas."
 European Unity
 "The Socialist movement aims to achieve international
 cooperation on the widest scale, from which no country should
 be excluded.  Within this framework, it strives for the
 realization, as part of the community of free nations, of
 a strong Europe united in freedom, so that its peoples may
 enjoy greater security and well-being and the individual
 rights and liberties to which all men are entitled."
 "The Socialist movement reaffirms its support for
 such developments which are designed to promote freedom,
 security, welfare and social justice for all the people of
 Europe -- and not only in the democratic countries, for
 Socialists cannot disregard the lot of democrats, many of
 them fellow Socialists, under Fascist and Communist regimes.
 The Socialist International declares its solidarity with its

 comrades and will continue to strive to secure for the
 peoples of all countries the fundamental human rights to
 which they are entitled and their freedom and independence."
 Asia and Africa
 "Throughout Asia and Africa the status quo is being
 rejected.  The young nations of these continents are seeking
 a new social system.  Communism pays only lip-service to
 the freedom and independence of these peoples; accepting
 Communism means the surrender of their independence.
 Democratic Socialism is the only alternative which offers
 the solution of their urgent economic and social problems
 with freedom."
 "The first priority is that the free countries should
 be able to maintain their independence and that those which
 are still dependent should achieve freedom under democratic
 self-government.
 "National independence does not in itself solve the
 economic and social problems which burden these areas.  A
 vigorous program for economic and social development is
 everywhere an urgent necessity.  Socialists call for
 practical cooperation through the United Nations, its
 specialized agencies, and other means which are acceptable
 to the countries concerned, in order to bring as rapid a
 development as possible in technical knowledge and capital
 resources.  The Socialist movement urges that this task
 should be given greater priority in all countries.
 "In the Middle East the new State of Israel represents
 a new ferment and a progressive democratic approach to the
 problems of this important region.  The negotiation of a
 peace settlement between Israel and the Arab States would
 open the way to fruitful cooperation to the benefit of all.
 "In the Far East it is evident that any settlement must
 be reached with the Peking Government as the effective
 government of China.  This will involve the admission of
 the Peking representatives to the United Nations.  The
 Peking Government must for its part show willingness to
 respect the principles of the United Nations Charter in
 its international relations."
 "In Vietnam the guarantor nations of the Geneva
 agreements have the duty of contributing to the establishment
 of a democratic regime in the country.  They have as well,
 and above all, the duty to demand a strict observance of
 the agreements by the Governments of the North and South."

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000300060005-9
 "In the Union of South Africa the intransigent policy
 of the present Government, violating the Declaration of Human
 Rights by depriving the overwhelming majority of its people
 of the common rights of citizenship, is dealing a heavy
 blow to all efforts towards a peaceful and democratic
 settlement of the racial conflicts in the area.  Socialists
 should press for any steps by their Governments and their
 organizations which can assist in calling a halt to this
 dangerous course."
 "For Socialists 'peaceful co-existence' is only a means
 to an end.  The Socialist aim is, as it always has been,
 more than mere co-existence; it is peace and international
 cooperation to realize the true brotherhood of man.
 "This goal is not an idea in the minds of a few.  It
 is a growing need of the common people everywhere.  Capitalism,
 under which the evils of exploitation and subjection have
 flourished, is opposed to the principles of social justice
 and equality between men.  Totalitarianism, whether Fascist
 or Communist, is the old tyranny writ large by using the new
 techniques.  Democratic Socialism alone has taken a positive
 stand to the new social forces at work in the world.  It
 is the Socialist movement which provides an answer to the
 needs and hopes of the common people throughout the world."
 Excerpts from:
 RESOLUTION ON GENERAL PROBLEMS
 Adopted by the Sixth Congress of the Socialist International
 (Hamburg, July, 1959)
 II. Nuclear Disarmament
 "2.  Congress further recognizes, as it did in Vienna, 'the
 supreme importance of also securing agreement to abandon the
 production of all fissionable material for military purposes
 and therefore of nuclear weapons, parallel with agreement to
 control conventional forces'.  The achievement of all-round
 multilateral disarmament with effective inspection and
 control remains our paramount aim...
 "3.---Progress made on tests has not yet been. matched by any
 similar advance in the wider field of disarmament.  Indeed,
 we recognize that even with good will by all concerned the
 negotiation of a disarmament agreement will take a long
 time.  And we are already faced with the prospect that more
 and more countries may, in the absence of agreement on
 disarmament, proceed to manufacture their own nuclear weapons.
 The spread of nuclear weapons to more and more countries is a

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000300060005-9
 terrifying prospect for the future peace of the world, because:
 a) it would lead to a further poisoning of the atmosphere
 through increasing radioactivity;
 b) it might lead to a breakdown of a test agreement among
 those powers that already have nuclear weapons;
 c) it would make the achievement of multilateral nuclear
 disarmament more difficult.
 In view of these facts, this Congress reiterates its view
 that while progress toward world-wide disarmament, nuclear
 and conventional, is an urgent necessity, immediate action is
 required to prevent a deterioration in the international
 situation by the spread of nuclear weapons..."
 IV. Developing Countries
 "l.  Congress welcomes the progress made by Socialists of Asia,
 the Middle East, Africa and Latin America in the service of
 their ideals of liberty and peace.  It voices its solidarity
 with them in their action to assure for the peoples of these
 continents the respect of their fundamental rights and of
 democratic liberties."
 SOCIALISM AND COI 1U1ISM
 Statement adopted by the Bureau of the Socialist International
 (London, April, 1956)
 "Socialism and Communism have nothing in common.  The
 Communists have merely perverted the very idea of Socialism.
 Where they are in power they have distorted every freedom,
 every right of the workers, every political gain and every
 human value which Socialists have won in a struggle lasting
 several generations.
 "We believe in democracy, they do not.  We believe in the
 Rights of Man, they mock them.  This is not changed by the
 refutation of Stalinism.
 "The repudiation of Stalin by those who -- whether in
 fear of their lies or in genuine complicity -- previously
 helped in Stalin?s crimes and praised his sins, has not
 fundamentally altered the character of the Communist regime.
 Even with collective leadership it yet remains a dictatorship;
 and what they now call 'Leninism? is nothing but an earlier
 edition of the misconceptions and misdeeds of Stalinism.
 "We note the professed desire of the Communist Party of
 the Soviet Union for some fora of cooperation with Socialist

 Approved For Release 2000/08/27 : CIA-RDP78-03061A000300060005-9
 parties.
 "But where Socialist parties in the Russian-dominated
 part of the world have cooperated with them, they were
 crushed out of existence, compulsorily merged or otherwise
 eliminated by the ruthless methods of a dictatorship which
 ironically calls itself People's Democracy.
 "Nor can we forget that Socialists are denied all
 political rights in the countries of the Soviet bloc and
 that many are still in prison whose only crime was to
 believe that there are more roads to Socialism than one.
 "Therefore, the Council of the Socialist International
 has already stated that the recent changes of Communist
 tactics provide no grounds for departing from the position
 taken up by democratic Socialism, which firmly rejects any
 united front or any other form of political cooperation with
 the parties of dictatorship.
 "While the Socialist International thus rejects all
 forms of cooperation with Communist parties, it favors forms
 of cooperation between governments which will facilitate
 the peaceful settlement of disputed issues.  The Soviet
 Union together with the Western Powers has a heavy responsi-
 bility for the settlement of such major questions as dis-
 armament and the reunification of Germany -- solutions for
 which the whole world is waiting.
 "The Soviet Union could, however, immediately contribute
 to the relaxation of the international situation by stopping
 the arms sales to the Arab States which have aggravated the
 danger of war in the Middle East; halting the virulent
 propaganda campaigns directed against democratic countries;
 and permitting the free dissemination of news and opinion.
 "We reaffirm that without freedom there can be no
 Socialism.  Socialism can be achieved only through democracy.
 Democracy can be fully realized only through Socialism.  It
 is indeed democratic Socialism which offers to the workers
 of the world the surest way to their emancipation and offers
 to the peoples of the world a road towards the achievement
 of a better society."

 prepared to deal with world affairs, dedicate themselves
 to the cause of Communism and take over from the older
 generations of revolutionaries on all fronts".
 Privation        But in the absence of war-time conditions
 resented         it becomes more and more difficult to per-
 suade people to accept --tie-- prospect of
 unrelieved hardship and privation. After 15 years of Corp-
 munist rule some sections of the population, particularly you>g
 people, are showing signs of disillusionment at the failure of
 the regime to achieve any significant improvement in living
 conditions.
 One of the promises the Communists made in 1949 and
 have not yet been able to keep was higher education for all.
 The cut-back in industrial progress in ig6o was followed by a
 reduction in the number of students receiving higher technical
 education. This, in turn, meant disappointment, with no
 alternative but to work in the countryside, particularly in the
 remote border regions.
 One way in which the authorities have tried to deal with
 the situation has been to expand the youth organisations. On
 May 3, 1965, a China Young Communist League (CYCL)
 communique revealed that youth leagues were being established
 which would enrol young people between the ages of 7-15-
 Young Pioneers .(cadet branch of CYCL) would continue to
 exist as an elite nucleus of the youth leagues. Similarly,. in
 October, 1965, it was announced that the CYCL. (cadet
 organisation for the Communist Party) would also increase

 "Expansion of CYCL membership is neither a
 question of merely increasing the number of organisa-
 tions, nor a matter of the CYCL alone, but, more
 important still, a question concerning the further con-
 solidation of the party's leadership over the youths and
 the unceasing reinforcement of the forces for carrying
 out Socialist revolution and construction".
 Peking's        The spate of publicity given to stories of the
 poisons'        struggles of young people of "bourgeois"
 and worse origins to repudiate their families
 and to live acceptable revolutionary lives has emphasised that
 "contaminating" influences are everywhere. These include not
 only "hangovers" from the past-such as capitalism, bureau-
 cratism and feudalistic and other undesirable ideological
 concepts-but also those which are still emerging, such as the
 new capitalism, revisionism, complacency and lethargy.
 The Press is full of exhortations to young people not
 to'take an interest in fashions, to stop thinking of "extravagant"
 meals but to be thankful that, however monotonous the diet,
 the State always manages to put something in the rice bowl,
 to forget their own wishes and ambitions and instead to work
 for the attainment of Communism. But even those young
 people who have accepted sacrifices for the good of the State,
 have found hostility in the remote areas to which they have
 gone, have been weakened by physical hardships and have
 begun to write to the newspapers questioning the validity of
 current policies. The Peking Daily Worker on September 25
 rebuked those "who do not believe .there.. are any future
 prospects for any young intellectuals who cherish.any ambi-
 tions at all".
 But life is little better for those students who have been f
 fortunate enough to be accepted for higher education; The
 ."part-work, part-study campaign", together with increased
 physical education and study of Mao's works reached such .a
 pitch by : the beginning of September that a People's Daily
 editorial was forced to urge that a proper balance should be
 maintained. between work and rest.and that extra-curricular
 activities should be reduced. It added: "What useful 'thing
 can a student do if his health is ruined? A student with poor health willbe a very big loss to the country".
 Enforced       Overseas Chinese students who responded

 return to. China for higher education have
 also become disillusioned. Many were forced to accept courses
 despite their lack of interest or aptitude. The standard of living
 was much lower than that to which they had been accustomed,
 and their studies were far too heavily, filled with ideological
 indoctrination. Moreover, the "part-work, part-study",, drive
 interfered with their academic work still further. Some did not
 t with go to the promised higher educational institutions but were

 Affairs journal admitted : "Many young people are not happy
 with agricultural production. Some want to work in factories
 and some on the farm for one year and then sit for the university
 matriculation examination".

 visas           visit their families outside China during

 never return.

 Li Yung-chuan, who had been studying in Canton,
 told the Sing Tao Daily News of Hongkong on June 16, x963,'
 that of the 3,000 overseas Chinese students in Canton in 1962
 only x,ooo remained by the spring of 1963. "I am not going
 back to the mainland ...," he added. "In three years all
 I learned was Marxist-Leninist theories." The Hongkong
 Press also reported that another overseas Chinese student had
 said that "not one in a hundred" of his fellow students had
 been able to obtain visas to leave China during 1963. By last!
 year, according to Sing Tao Daily News, of August 8, fewer still
 were successful. Instead they were told by the authorities that
 the summer vacation was a time for more political education
 and military training and that the "development of their':,
 thinking" would be harmed by contact with "capitalist society
 and exposure to bourgeois living".
