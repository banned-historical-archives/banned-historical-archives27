12 May 1958 
DAILY BRIEF 
I. THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Soviet tactics on nuclear testing: In his letter of 9 May 
to President Eisenhower, Premier Khrushchev accepted the 
American proposal to have experts begin discussions about 
detection of violations as the first step toward an agreement 
on ending nuclear weapons tests. This concession indicates 
the USSR's determination to emphasize test suspension as a 
major issue for settlement at a summit meeting and Mos-
cow's judgment that negotiation on the test suspension issue 
will increase public pressure on London and Washington to 
stop tests. The USSR will probably not resume testing at 
least until after there is some resolution of the issue of a 
summit meeting. Khrushchev's letter contains no specific 
threat of resumption, and First Deputy Foreign Minister 
Kuznetsov recently said that even if 
Britain and the United States continue tests, the USSR will 
not resume  tests "unless something really very important 
happens." 
Bloc-Yugoslav dispute: With the calling off of Voroshi-
lov's visit to Belgrade, the rift between Belgrade and the bloc 
has, as anticipated by both sides, definitely entered the sphere 
of state relations. Yugoslav Foreign Secretary Popovic as-
serts that the situation is "much worse" than the public realizes. 
Moscow may now follow through with its threat to curtail eco-
nomic relations with Yugoslavia, a step which will bely Soviet 
propaganda that bloc aid is free from political considerations. 
Meanwhile in Budapest, Gomulka continues in general to sup-
port bloc foreign policy positions without taking a stand on the

mu. 
dispute with Belgrade. The "postponement" of the Soviet state 
visit will doubtless result in more pressure on Gomulka to 
cancel Tito's scheduled visit to Warsaw later this month. 
(Page 1) 
II. ASIA-AFRICA 
Indonesia: Foreign Minister Subandrio claims Indo-
nesian Communists are exerting considerable pressure on 
the government to request "volunteers" from the Sino-Soviet 
bloc, but that he and Prime Minister Djuanda are strongly 
opposed to such a course of action. Subandrio renewed his  
government's urgent reauests for American aid  
the possibility of negotiations with North Celebes dissident 
rs is out of the question at this time. 
Dissident troops in North Celebes have apparently oc-
cupied Parigi, about 30 miles east of Palu, after having 
made a new amphibious landing on 8 May. Prio 
rth_r_P-7rigi was bombed by dissident aircraft. 
(Page 2) (Map) 
Lebanon: President Chamoun has definitely decided to 
seek a second term and has tentatively scheduled his first 
open step in that direction for about 14 May. The constitution 
must be amended first. The rioting set off by pro-Nasir ele-
ments in Tripoli on 8 May has subsided, although the Cairo 
and Damascus radios are calling for a continuation of the 
"revolution." The disorders may influence Chamoun to 
delay his intended move. More trouble is probable when he 
does make his intentions known. (Page 4) 
Cyprus: Tension between Greek and Turkish Cypriots 
is such that an open clash between them may be imminent. 
Both the Greek and the Turkish underground organizations 
have also warned London that unless their mutually exclusive

demands for a Cyprus settlement are met, new attacks  will 
be launched on British personnel. (Page 5) 
Japan-UAR: The Japanese ambassador in Cairo has 
made a strong recommendation to Tokyo that long-term 
credits be granted to the UAR. Such a move by japan, fol-
lowing a West German credit, would be used by Nasir to 
claim that his policy of neutrality is paying off materially. 
However, the Japanese Government, which has only limited 
assets for economic assistance, may prefer to concentrate 
on exploiting the recently won offshore oil concession in  he 
neutral zone of the Persian Gulf. (Page 6) 
III. THE WEST 
Britain--defense policy: Public criticism by top British 
air officials of the government's reliance on missiles at the 
expense of manned aircraft may bring out latent dissension 
in Conservative ranks over Britain's radically changed de-
fense program as outlined in the 1957 white paper. These 
criticisms could lead to a test of Defense Minister Sandys' 
position at a time when consideration is being given to in-
creasing the power of the Defense Ministry at thp P3MP  se 
of the individual services. (Page 7) 
Haiti: A marked deterioration in public order, includ-
ing rifle fire in the vicinity of the American ambassador's 
residence, has followed the government's imposition of a 
state of siege on 2 May and its increasingly arbitrary meas-
ures against political opponents. This trend, unless checked, 
could provoke a general uprising against the Duvalier regime. 
For the present, however, Duvalier's continuing army back-
ing seems sufficient to keep him in power. (Page 8)

LATE ITEM 
*Communist China: Foreign Minister Chen Yi has 
made the first public intimation that an understanding 
with the Soviet Union has been reached on the subject of 
nuclear weapon deliveries to Communist China. In inter-
views published in West Germany, the foreign minister 
states that his country may obtain nuclear weapons if no 
agreement can be reached with the West on a nuclear-free 
zone in Asia and if the United States places nuclear weap-
ons in the Far East. This statement is probably intended 
primarily to serve Peiping's propaganda ends. There 
were unconfirmed reports that the Soviet Union had agreed 
to supply Communist China with "super-weapons" when 
Mao Tse-tung and a military mission visited Moscow last 
November. At the conclusion of the visit, the Soviet de-
fense minister spoke of "our armies armed with modern 
first-class weapons." He did not commit himself more 
as to the type of weapons he had in mind.

'11". THE COMMUNIST BLOC 
Worsening in Bloc-Belgrade State Relations May Presage  
Cut in Soviet Economic Aid 
The Yugoslav - Sino-Soviet bloc dispute has finally en-
tered the sphere of state relations, signified by the last-
minute postponement of Voroshilov's visit to Belgrade. This 
more serious turn was foreseen in the Chinese and Soviet 
attacks of 5 and 8 May and in the forthright Yugoslav reply 
to the bloc, published on 9 May, which said that a return to 
the methods of the Cominform would not only damage rela-
tions between Yugoslavia and other socialist countries, "but 
international socialism generally as well." Moscow now may 
follow through with its threat, contained in the 8 May Pravda 
editorial, to curtail economic assistance to Yugoslavia. 
Thus far, Yugoslavia has used only $52,000,000--pri-
marily in the form of foreign exchange loans--of a total of 
$370,000,000 in credits extended by the USSR since 1956. 
This total includes a $175,000,000 joint USSR - East German 
credit for an aluminum mill which Moscow suspended early 
last year because of Yugoslavia's continued expressions of 
ideological independence. Although reinstated several months 
later, the project remains in the planning stage. 
The $318,000,000 remaining under the Soviet credit and 
about $90,000,000 in credits from Czechoslovakia and Poland 
not yet expended could be canceled should the USSR follow 
through on its threat to suspend aid. Since the loans are 
chiefly to provide equipment for industrial construction now in the 
planning stage, their cancellation would not cause an economic 
crisis in Yugoslavia. 
Yugoslavia's trade with the bloc currently amounts to ap-
proximately $200,000,000 a year, less than 25 percent of total 
Yugoslav foreign trade, whereas in 1948 the bloc accounted 
for more than 50 percent of Yugoslav foreign trade. While 
trade with the USSR has increased substantially- since 1953, it 
has never accounted for  more than 15 percent of Yugoslavia's 
total trade.

IL. ASIA-AFRICA 
Situation in Indonesia 
Foreign Minister Subandrio told Ambassador Jones in 
Djakarta on 10 May that the Indonesian Communist party (PKI) 
has stepped up its activities. He attributed the recent army 
detention of New York Times correspondent Bernard Kalb 
to Major Marsudi, the pro-Communist Djakarta town com-
mander. Subandrio also claimed PKI pressure for a re-
quest for volunteers from the Sino-Soviet bloc was having 
its effect on certain elements in the cabinet and the armed 
forces, although he and Prime Minister Djuanda were strong-
ly opposed to such a course. The foreign minister reaffirmed 
his government's requests for American aid, citing specifical-
ly spare parts for F-51's and C-47's. 
A recent attempt at a negotiated settlement between 
North Celebes dissident leaders and the central government 
was unsuccessful, according to Lt. Col. Pirngadie, the Dja-
karta army headquarters information officer.  
the central 
government had been encouraged to send a mission composed 
of officers from South Celebes when it received word from 
Col. Warouw, now acting head of the revolutionary govern-
ment, that he would be willing to negotiate a settlement. In-
stead, he tried to persuade the South Celebes officers to join 
the dissident cause. Pirngadie stated that chances of new 
negotiations at this time are nil. 
� A party composed of the North Sumatra military command-
er and high-ranking civil officials was ambushed in Tapanuli, 
While apparently 
no casualties were sustained, the incident points up the continu-
ing capability of dissident troops by-passed in the central gov-
ernment invasion of Tapanuli to mount guerrilla warfare.

troops the day before had occupied Parigi, about 30 miles

Lebanese Internal Situation 
Lebanese President Chamoun has definitely decided to 
seek a second term and is planning to make a conclusive 
move in that direction by 14 May, according to Foreign 
Minister Malik. Since the constitution must be amended 
by Parliament to allow a second term, Chamoun's sup-
porters may present an amendment this week signed by 
the required two-thirds majority for its passage. Parlia-
ment then could re-elect the President in the same meet-
ing. Chamoun's tactics may be altered, however, as a 
result of the serious rioting in Moslem Tripoli. 
The rioting, during which the USIS library was burned, 
was instigated by pro-Nasir elements and may have been 
guided by Syrian intelligence agents. Two Lebanese army 
battalions have been moved into the city. 
Losing momentum and lacking a real issue so long as 
Chamoun made no move to declare his intentions, Chamoun's 
opponents seized upon the assassination of a pro-Soviet 
journalist as justification for a general strike. They have 
hoped to lay at the government's door blame for a deteriora-
tion of law and order, but were reported to be quarreling 
among themselves prior to the riots in Tripoli. The pos-
sibility that disorders may turn from anti-Chamoun demon-
strations to Moslem-Christian communal strife could widen 
the rifts which have been appearing within the opposition 
group, _which includes a significant Christian element.

'NOW" 
Tension on Cyprus Mounts  
Bitterness between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot com-
munities recently increased to a point where open clashes 
may occur at any time. Intercommunal rioting on Cyprus 
would probably have an immediate effect on the minorities 
in Turkey and Greece and could lead to a further drastic 
deterioration in relations between the two nations. 
Members of both communities on the island are being 
asked to express their nationalism through new and some-
times dramatic means. EOKA, the Greek Cypriot under-
ground organization, has demanded that the population elimi-
nate all signs in English and cease using the Latin alphabet. 
Even American firms on Cyprus have been told to revise 
their signs and trade marks by 15 May or "suffer the conse-
quences." In addition, there is evidence that EOKA is now 
engaged in a form of economic warfare by attempting to 
force Greek employers to discharge their Turkish employees. 
Meanwhile, the Turks on Cyprus have indicated their inten-
tion to push toward a de facto form of partition by refusing 
to pay taxes to Greek Cypriot officials. 
In London, Governor Foot is conferring with British 
leaders. Recent statements by the colonial secretary 
indicate that new British proposals for Cyprus will be pre-
sented in Athens and Ankara shortly after the 11 May Greek 
national elections. 
EOKA has warned that unless Foot's mission results in 
progress toward self-determination for Cyprus, the long-
threatened "all-out offensive" will be launched. Meanwhile, 
the underground Turkish resistance movement has issued 
instructions to Turkish Cypriots to inflict "every kind of 
damage and injury" to Britons if there is any move toward 
a s91ut1on other than partition.

Japanese Ambassador Recommends Economic 
Support for UAR  
The Japanese ambassador in Cairo has made an un-
usually strong recommendation that his government grant 
long-term credits to the United Arab Republic (UAR)  for  
assistance in the establishment of industrial plants.   
Ambassador Tsuchida 
stated his conviction that Japan could achieve "good re-
sults" in the UAR and an economic bridgehead in the area 
by providing a "comparatively small amount of coopera-
tive assistance." 
Tsuchida asserted to Tokyo that the United States 
would welcome Japanese as well as other free world as-
sistance to the UAR as a counter to Communist influence. 
He said that economically, too, there is a good prospect 
for retiring credits by increasing future production of 
sugar, soda, oil, and other products in the UAR, and urged 
that recommendations of the recent Japanese investigation 
mission to Egypt be given serious consideration.

III. THE WEST 
Top British Air Officials Challenge Defense Policy  
Statements by the two top air staff officials, in effect 
criticizing British defense policy for reliance on missiles, 
have brought into public view increasing service department 
opposition to some elements of the radical defense policy 
outlined in the 1957 white paper and generally reaffirmed 
in the 1958 paper issued in February. 
The chief and the assistant' chief of the air staff recently 
told a group of British service and civilian leaders, including 
Prince Phillip, that the Air Ministry is convinced of a continu-
ing need for manned aircraft to supplement missiles. The 
press is highlighting this unusual "public revolt" against the 
defense minister's policy which calls for the gradual abandon-
ment of manned fighters and bombers. The remarks aroused 
Defense Minister Sandys' resentment, according to the Ameri-
can Embassy, and inspired parliamentary questions and criti-
cism on 7 May regarding military "meddling" in policy mat-
ters which should be reserved for the cabinet. 
Public airing of the controversy, however, may bring out 
some hitherto latent dissension in Tory ranks over various 
aspects of defense policy. Former Defense Minister Head and 
former Chancellor of the Exchequer Thorneycroft are known to 
be disturbed by Sandys' growing reliance on missiles. 
The statement by the air force chiefs may also generate 
resistance to expected changes in the defense establishment 
which would give increased powers to the Defense Ministry 
at the expense of service ministers and military chiefs. There 
is speculation that additional duties for the chiefs of staff 
chairman, who is also chief of staff to Sandys, will give him 
a "czar" role over the services. The air force may be par-
ticularly concerned because of reports that Admiral Lord 
Mountbatten will succeed Marshal of the RAF Sir William 
Dickson in this post, thus depriving the air staff at a critical  
time of its direct line to the top policy level.

New Repressive Actions by the Haitian Government 
A virtual reign of terror, which has been developing 
since the government suspended constitutional rights on 
2 May and intensified its repressive measures against 
political opponents, has produced a serious deterioration 
in public law and order in Haiti. Among other incidents, 
a number of rifle shots were fired on 7 May in the vicin-
ity of the American ambassador's residence, although Am-
bassador Drew believes no attempt on his life was in-
tended and the government has since expressed regrets. 
Although President Duvalier has categorically denied 
the government's complicity in acts of terrorism, it ap-
pears certain that his secret police, with at least the pas-
sive acquiescence of the army, has carried out some acts 
of violence, including the total destruction of two opposi-
tion newspapers on 4 May. 
Duvalier seems to retain for the present the support of 
the army which is essential to his continued control. The 
government's repressive actions against both opposition 
elements and the mulatto class, might, however, go so far 
as to provoke a general uprising. Ambassador Drew re-
ported on 7 May that many people were likening the present 
situation to that of July 1915, when President Vilbrun Guil-
laume Sam, climaxing a campaign of political persecution 
with a brutal massacre of political prisoners, was seized 
by his enemies and thrown to the mob, which hacked him 
to pieces and paraded through the streets with fragments 
of his body. 
Ambassador Drew saw one hopeful aspect to the situa-
tion on 9 May when he reported that some cabinet ministers 
realize jjie adverse effects the campaign of terror is having 
on t government's position at home and abroad.
