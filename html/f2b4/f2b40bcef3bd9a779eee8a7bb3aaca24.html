 ORIGIN, MISSIONS, AND STRUCTURE OF CIA
 Lyman B. Kirkpatrick
 This is a brief summary of the history of the modern origin of
 the central intelligence concept and thus of the Central Intel-
 ligence Agency.
 In 1940 the fortunes of Britain and France were at their
 lowest ebb.  Some high-level officials of the US Government
 were predicting that Great Britain could not hold out against
 the Germans.   To check on this, President Roosevelt sent Colo-
 nel William J. Donovan, prominent New York attorney and
 winner of the Congressional Medal of Honor as Commanding
 Officer of the 69th Regiment in World War I, abroad to dis-
 cover and report his estimate of the situation.  Donovan first
 visited the Mediterranean area, and on his second trip talked
 to leaders of both Britain and France.  His report indicated
 that Britain would hold out, but he urged that. the US im-
 mediately organize itself for global warfare.      Donovan's par-
 ticular interest was in the intelligence field, and he went to
 talk to Secretary of the Navy Knox, Secretary of War Stimson,
 and Attorney General Jackson about his concept of an agency
 which would combine intelligence with the forces of propa-
 ganda and subversion.
 On 10 June 1941, Donovan proposed "a service of strategic
 information."  This service would have an advisory panel com-
 posed of the chiefs of intelligence of the Army, the Navy, the
 Department of State, and the FBI.  It would draw its personnel
 from the Army and the Navy and would also have a civilian
 staff.  It would not displace or encroach upon the intelligence
 prerogatives of the established departments, although it would
 collect information independently.  This was the start of the
 Office of the Coordinator of Information which combined in-
 formation, intelligence, and clandestine activities.  In 1942,
 however, the Coordinator of Information was split and the
 Office of War Information-the predecessor of the present
 US Information Agency-was created and given the respon-
 sibility for all overt attributable propaganda information, and
 to the Office of Strategic Services went the responsibility for

 clandestine activities and for research and analysis of intelli-
 gence.
 From the OSS the present day intelligence community in-
 herited certain assets.  Among these were records and some
 methods and means of procuring both overt and secret intelli-
 gence.  There were certain basic counterespionage files devel-
 oped with the advice and assistance of some foreign intelligence
 services, particularly the British.  There was a considerable
 reservoir of knowledge of procedures for research and analysis
 of basic intelligence information.  There were some skilled per-
 sonnel.  Finally, but far from last in importance, there were
 agreements with key foreign intelligence services.
 The history of the OSS, and particularly its relationship with
 other US intelligence organizations during World War II, is far
 too detailed for discussion in this essay.  But it should be noted
 that shortly after the creation of the Office of Strategic Services,
 top level officials in the US intelligence community started to
 think about a peacetime intelligence service.  On 25 August
 1942, Brigadier General John Magruder wrote a paper on a
 proposed plan for a joint intelligence bureau which would be
 an agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  For the next two years
 there was considerable discussion of this and similar papers.
 On 5 October 1944 a document was originated in the office of
 General Donovan entitled "The Basis for a Permanent World-
 Wide Intelligence Service."  Certain of the principles enun-
 ciated in this document are interesting to note.  This service
 would collect, analyze, and deliver intelligence on the policy or
 strategy level.  The proposed organization would have its own
 means of communication and control over its secret operations.
 It would not interfere with departmental intelligence and it
 would not have any police function. An individual rather than
 a collective responsibility for national intelligence was pro-
 posed. Finally, the director of the proposed organization would
 be responsible directly to the President.
 It is interesting to note that Secretary of War Stimson com-
 mented on the subject of intelligence coordination in his biog-
 raphy "On Active Service in Peace and War."  This quotation.
 reads: "Stimson was insistent that no impatience with its occa-
 sional eccentricities should deprive the Army of the profits of co-
 operation with General Donovan's Office of Strategic Services.
 Throughout the war the intelligence activities of the United
 SECRET                      3
 States Government remained incompletely coordinated, but
 here again it was necessary to measure the profits of reorgani-
 zation against its dislocations and on the whole, Stimson felt
 that the American achievement in this field, measured against
 the conditions of 1940, was more than satisfactory.  A full re-
 organization belonged to the post war period."
 On 18 January 1945, the Joint Strategic Survey Committee
 reported to the JCS on the subject of a central intelligence
 organization.  The members proposed first a national intelli-
 gence authority composed of the Secretaries of State, War, and
 Navy and the Chief of Staff to the President.  There would be
 an advisory board consisting of the heads of the various intel-
 ligence services.  The new organization would have the power
 to inspect the operations of the various departmental intelli-
 gence services and would have the responsibility for protecting
 sources and methods.
 At this juncture the press got wind of the discussions for
 creating a new intelligence organization and, on 9 February
 1945, fairly complete details appeared in the Chicago Tribune
 and the Washington Times Herald.  There was considerable
 furor, and some members of Congress took a dim view of the
 creation of what they felt might become a peacetime "gestapo."
 Shortly after this - just a few days before his death -
 President Roosevelt asked General Donovan to get together
 with the heads of the various intelligence and security services
 and get a consensus of views on a central service.  Donovan
 did this and also went further and queried by letter all of the
 members of the Cabinet.  Within the intelligence community
 there was general agreement that a central service might be
 appropriate, but there were several conflicting views as to
 whether it should report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to the
 Department of State, or to the President, and there was also
 controversy as to whether there should be individual or collec-
 tive responsibility for national intelligence.  The response from
 the Cabinet members was varied and ranged from yes to no.
 After open hostilities had ceased, as we all vividly remember,
 there was almost frantic haste to demobilize not only the mili-
 tary services but many of the war agencies.     On 20 September
 1945 the OSS was disbanded.  Its Research and Analysis
 Branch and its Presentation Unit were transferred to the De-
 partment of State, its Secret Intelligence and Special Opera-

 4                      SECRET
 tions Units were transferred to the Army, and the former were
 preserved in the Strategic Services Unit which reported to the
 Secretary of the Army.
 On 22 October 1945 a report prepared by Ferdinand Eberstadt
 on possible unification of the Army and Navy recommended a
 central intelligence organization and a national security coun-
 cil.  On 14 November 1945 the Secretaries of State, War, and
 Navy met, discussed the proposed central intelligence organiza-
 tion, and set up an interdepartmental working committee to
 attempt to arrive at a unanimous recommendation.
 The end product of these reports and committees was the
 issuance on 22 January 1946 of the Executive Order creating the
 Central Intelligence Group.  This Executive Order reflected
 much of the thinking and work that had gone on during the
 war. A National Intelligence Authority was created, composed of
 the Secretaries of State, War, and Navy and the Military Chief
 of Staff to the President.  The Director of the Central Intelli-
 gence Group was designated by the President, and personnel
 were to be assigned from the respective departments as well as
 recruited from civilian life.  The Director of the new Central
 Intelligence Group was charged by the Executive Order with
 preparing plans for coordination.  The new organization could
 inspect the activities of departmental intelligence if such in-
 spection were approved by the National Intelligence Authority.
 It could recommend policies and objectives. It was responsible
 for correlating, evaluating, and disseminating intelligence and
 for the performance of services of common concern and such
 other functions as directed.  The Executive Order explicitly
 stated that the departments would continue to collect, evaluate,
 correlate, and disseminate departmental intelligence.  Finally,
 an Intelligence Advisory Board, composed of the heads of the
 service intelligence agencies, was established to advise the Di-
 rector of the Central Intelligence Group.
 With the creation of the Central Intelligence Group there
 commenced a process of accretion of functions taken from the
 wartime agencies and from departments which were anticipat-
 ing reductions in budget under peacetime conditions.  The
 Strategic Services Unit was transferred from the Department
 of the Army and became the Office of Special Operations
 - charged with espionage and counterespionage functions. The
 Washington Document Center was taken over from the Navy
 SECRET                      5
 and shortly after that the Army's German Military Documents
 Center at Fort Holabird joined this unit and together became
 the Foreign Documents Division.  The Foreign Broadcast In-
 formation Service, an organization with worldwide bases for
 monitoring all non-coded radio traffic, which had originally
 been under the Federal Communications Commission, was
 transferred from the Army and became the Foreign Broadcast
 Information Division.  During World War II the Army and
 Navy and OSS and occasionally other agencies had all ap-
 proached US businesses and institutions in search of foreign
 intelligence information.  An early agreement was reached
 that this domestic collection should be performed as a service
 of common concern by Central Intelligence with other agencies
 participating as they desired, and this became the Contact
 Division.  Another illustration of the type of functions taken
 on is the division of responsibilities with the Department of
 State on biographic intelligence.  The list would be much too
 long if we attempted to enumerate all of the functions acquired
 in this method.
 Slightly over a year and a half after the creation of the
 CIG-on 25 July 1947-the Congress, utilizing most of the fea-
 tures of this Executive Order, passed the National Security Act
 of 1947 creating the Central Intelligence Agency.
 Thus, the mission of the Central Intelligence Agency becomes
 fairly obvious with the preceding background.  The National
 Security Act of 1947 describes the general mission with em-
 phasis on coordination and on performing services of common
 concern.  It should be clearly noted also that the legislation
 assigns two roles to the Director of Central Intelligence and the
 Deputy Director of Central Intelligence - over-all coordination,
 as well as the role of head(s) of an Agency.

 STRATEGIC THINKING AND AIR INTELLIGENCE
 Major General James H. Walsh
 My purpose in this article is to discuss, in very broad terms,
 some of the significant aspects of air strategy for the future
 and the vital functions that intelligence must perform in order
 to insure the success of future air operations.  The suspicions
 currently entertained that the Soviet sputnik may be getting
 intelligence of both meteorological and cartographic nature re-
 quired for accurate firing of ICBMs illustrate some of the possi-
 ble relationships between air power and intelligence.  In a rudi-
 mentary way, even the first earth satellites point up the tasks
 and capabilities of future intelligence systems required for
 survival under conditions of international technological com-
 petition - intelligence systems which must meet three basic
 criteria: global coverage, instantaneous discovery, and abso-
 lute accuracy.
 I believe that we have a reasonably good understanding of
 past and present concepts of air warfare and the relation of
 intelligence to those concepts.  It is far more difficult to look
 into the future and to do so with the precision and clarity
 needed to prepare ourselves effectively for the trials and dan-
 gers ahead.
 The reason for this basic uncertainty is not that many people
 have neglected the problems of aerial technology and its stra-
 tegic implications.  The reason is rather that we are in the
 midst of a technological revolution.  Changes are becoming so
 rapid, so penetrating and, in many instances, so contradictory
 that the direct and indirect results of the technological revolu-
 tion tend to control - and at the same time toy confuse - the
 nature and application of tomorrow's air strategy.  Neverthe-
 less, it is in this setting of dynamic technical change and a
 world beset by what often seems an unlimited number of
 related and unrelated political, economic, and military prob-
 lems that we must attempt to examine the future direction of
 air power.
 To begin with, we already have seen major alterations in the
 basic nature of air forces since World War II.  The transition

 to jets, nuclear weapons, sonic speeds, countless black boxes,
 and, to a degree, missiles typifies the changed environment
 which governs today's air capabilities as compared with those
 of 1945.
 Fifteen years ago the RAF qualitatively was the world's lead-
 ing air force.  Today it is in third place.  More important, it
 is not in a class, by a broad margin, with the air forces of the
 US and the USSR.  It has neither the aircraft, the equipment,
 the bases, the research and development, nor the funds to
 become again a truly self-sufficient force, with strategic capa-
 bilities as required by world conditions.
 Fifteen years ago the Soviet Air Force was an adjunct- of the
 Russian army.  Statistically it represented a force in quantity,
 but it had poor operational know-how and no strategic capa-
 bility.  Its aircraft were fair, at best.  Today the Soviet Air
 Force is the largest in the world.  It is equipped with modern
 weapons, some of them as advanced as those of any other
 nation. It has a well-funded and aggressive research and de-
 velopment program.  Although it still has many weaknesses,
 the Soviet Air Force is making a bid for world air mastery.
 The VS Air Force also has come of age in.the postwar period.
 It has held the quality lead for most of that time and still holds
 it for most of the important 'equipments.  Its personnel are
 superior in training and efficiency.  But the USAF has prob-
 lems, especially in areas outside the SAC program.  Its progress
 is not to be belittled, but in some areas its progress perhaps has
 not been so fast or so forward as we would like it to be.
 The fortunate aspect is that during the postwar period the
 USAF has grown to be a global force.  In fact, to this date, the
 USAF - not forgetting its naval support - is the only global
 force extant.  This American capability is a fact of overriding
 importance.    It will remain a controlling factor in the inter-
 national power equation, to a certain extent, irrespective of
 technological slippage and of the inevitable acquisition by the
 Soviet Union of a global missile force.
 The most important single change since World War II is that
 atomic airpower has become the dominant military force.  The
 only way a nation can deliver nuclear firepower over long dis-
 tances and in a short time is through the air.  Sea and ground
 delivery of nuclear warheads is important, particularly in spe-
 cial situations.  But in terms of a global nuclear war, these
 SECRET                       9
 systems - and some of the secondary means of aerial de-
 livery - can do no more than furnish local, regional, and tac-
 tical support to the strategic air strike forces.
 One of the changes upon us deals with defense in nuclear
 aerial war.  Whereas the offense still seems to have outdis-
 tanced defense, the old axiom that like weapons are the best
 defenses against like weapons again could become true.
 For the moment there is very little one can do when an
 atomic explosion occurs except to be underground, fully
 equipped with food and non-contaminated water or, preferably,
 plenty of Irish whiskey.  Nevertheless, the very possession of
 nuclear weapons for defensive purposes may act as a "prevent-
 ing" factor - not because even the best defense would be capa-
 ble of halting an attack, but because a good defense system
 would boost the force requirements of the attacker, lower the
 probability that he can execute his plan with full success, and
 thus, in some cases at least, tend to induce him to delay his
 aggression until he has reached the required force and tech-
 nological levels.  It is in the nature of a "race," that the
 aggressor may be unable to achieve such a posture of superi-
 ority that he can dare take the risk of nuclear attack.  If this
 should be a vain hope, for example, because the defender has
 failed to keep up with the pace of the race, the actual use of
 nuclear warheads against incoming vehicles should reduce the
 effectiveness of the offense.
 Some of our forward looking scientists are optimistic about
 the feasibility of employing anti-ICBM missiles, which would
 take advantage of the greatest point of vulnerability of the
 early ballistic missile, its fixed trajectory.  Many ideas have
 been proposed about nuclear predetonation and sophisticated
 employment of modern electronics to interfere with incoming
 nuclear attack.
 There are a number of passive defensive steps which could
 be taken to lessen the vulnerability of our retaliatory force.
 These include the dispersal of aircraft and missiles, shelters,
 and other forms of base hardening, short exposure times, rapid
 reaction procedures, and maintenance of a substantial portion
 of the alert force in the air at all times.
 Unfortunately such systems can be very costly.  They are
 limited in their coverage and may not be reliable enough for

 Approved For Release 2005/03/15 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000100020001-2
 the safety of personnel and certain equipment. Elaborate pas-
 sive defenses tend to disrupt and slow the ability of an air force
 to retaliate as rapidly as required.  For these reasons the stra-
 tegic effectiveness of passive defense is predicated upon effec-
 tive warning.  By warning I refer to technical alarms such as
 radar and infrared sensing and to interrelated strategic and
 tactical indications intelligence.
 The true effectiveness of defense will be a function of the
 scope, size, quality, and mental effort put into requisite weapons
 systems needed to furnish capabilities for protection, warning,
 interception, and countermeasure tasks.  It may be dubious
 whether or not even the best defensive system pitted against
 combinations of different types of attack weapons ever will
 attain a high kill rate, but this may not be the critical point.
 Rather, countersystems embodying nuclear warheads and
 built around effective warning and reaction responses suggest
 that a nation may be able to close the gap between the power
 of the offense and present limitations on defense.  Such sys-
 tems could pre-empt the advantage of surprise by sneak attacks
 by an aggressive nuclear delivery force.  They would force the
 attacker into more elaborate and costly delivery means, pri-
 marily large and massive raids which are susceptible to stra-
 tegic and tactical detection and to interception measures.
 Through all these means and measures the offensive may not
 necessarily be priced out of business, but its effectiveness should
 be reduced against its primary objective -the opponent's re-
 taliatory force.  Thus, it would be hoped, the attacker would
 be induced not to strike because of the uncertainty over the
 success of his initial blow and also because he would have -to
 risk his main force at excessive loss rates.  In nuclear war the
 first blow must be decisive: the retaliatory force must be killed.
 It is quite clear that intelligence influences the effectiveness
 of defense.  Whatever the technical proficiency of a defense
 system, it can be improved by better intelligence, whereas even
 the technically most promising defenses can be invalidated
 through intelligence failure anywhere along the "assembly
 line" - from scientific intelligence to tactical warning.  Per-
 haps it should be observed that good intelligence would allow
 the utilization of foreign scientific and technological achieve-
 ments for the improvement of our own posture.  Beyond pro-
 SECRET                       '11
 viding us with better design patterns, such intelligence also
 would enable us to build our equipment to such specifications
 as to optimize its capabilities against the enemy's weapons.
 I should like to turn now to a discussion of various tech-
 nological factors, some of them here now and some on the
 horizon, and try to relate them into a strategic pattern.
 During the years ahead we shall be approaching practical
 terminal limits in certain key parameters of weapons systems.
 We already may have reached what could be called terminal
 explosive power, not that it would be impossible to achieve
 higher yields.
 Within the next few decades we probably will attain terminal
 speeds, at least for terrestrial operations.  We cannot exceed
 certain speeds without being forced from the earth's gravita-
 tional field.  Before we achieve theoretical terminal velocities
 we should reach a far lower practical speed limit for operations
 directed against targets on the ground.       We must remember
 that the attainment of maximum speed in flight may require
 more time than would be necessary to reach a terrestrial tar-
 get at lesser speeds.
 We certainly shall be capable of terminal ranges in the sense
 that future air and missile systems will be able to circumnavi-
 gate the globe at least once.  I am convinced that there will
 be no practical limits to altitude, although there may be tem-
 porary barriers to surmount before manned and powered space
 flight becomes a reality. Such restrictions could occur in
 metallurgy, engines, communications, aero medicine, and nu-
 clear components, among other fields.
 Let me dwell for a moment on the relationship of altitude to
 tomorrow's air strategy.  In the immediate future, altitude
 essentially will be a matter of tactical advantage inasmuch
 as, with respect to powered flight, we still shall be competing in
 heights measured by thousands of feet.  We have come to
 recognize that the attack force with the higher altitude capa-
 bility, generally speaking, is the force with the greater penetra-
 tion capability.  To achieve tactical altitude advantage we are
 moving into speeds up to Mach 3 as a result of improved rocket
 fuels, higher thrust engines, aerodynamic advances, and even
 newer black boxes.  I am talking about situations up to 100,000
 feet.

 But today we also stand on the threshhold of entirely new
 altitude dimensions.  Space vehicles already have been climb-
 ing to heights of 600 miles, and unpowered satellites, or sput-
 niks, are flying around the earth approximately every hour and
 a half, at heights up to over 1,000 miles.  This altitude is by no
 means a limit but soon will be exceeded.  Disregarding the
 future development of orbital flight, even at this point the
 significance of the recent quantum jump is that we are acquir-
 ing the capability of staying in the air.
 This overriding technological fact will have the most pro-
 found impact upon military operations.  At present altitudes,
 the airman must worry about hurricanes, fog, winds, and other
 weather factors characteristic of the dense air which lies just
 above the earth.  Tomorrow's space flyers must be concerned
 with meteoric showers, cosmic radiation, electronic barriers,
 and Buck Rogers' conditions within his cabin. Instead of using
 flight as a means of traveling from one point on the earth's
 surface to another, either for friendly or unfriendly purposes,
 the new problem will be to reach an orbit, maintain it, and
 utilize nonpowered flight for scientific, military, and probably
 economic purposes.
 The flying machine of outer space will not spend 90 percent
 of its time on the ground, but 100 percent of its time aloft.  In
 simple statistics, we are moving from transonic speeds and
 periodic flights of several thousands miles in length into an
 environment where speeds will be of the order of 16,000 knots
 and "ranges," depending upon the height and shape of the or-
 bit, easily may exceed 1 million miles per day and hundreds of
 millions of miles per year.
 The development of terminal weapons - in terms of ex-
 plosive power, range, endurance, and speed - will not bring
 the technological race to an end.  Strategies will capitalize
 on the new dimension of altitude and perhaps endurance rather
 than distance as a decisive area of military competition.  Mili-
 tary superiority will be dependent upon relative advantages in
 electronics, warning, and deception. Thus the sciences of in-
 strumentation and intelligence will become truly decisive ele-
 ments in the equation of a strategy in which the chief maneu-
 vers seek to conquer altitude and achieve enduring control from
 the ground to outer space.
 SECRET                     13
 Modern air strategy will be affected by a number of additional
 problems, each of which could become crucial in varying cir-
 cumstances.  There is, for example, the requirement that a
 portion of the aerial strength must be on constant readiness
 status.  A strike force that requires one or two days to get
 ready is a military liability.  Even in today's war it would be
 caught on the surface.
 An effective air force must be numerically strong and able
 to get its combat aircraft into the air in time.  It must be
 located on a large number of bases, preferably distributed on
 several continents and located at varying distances from the
 enemy.  Moreover, it must be supported by reconnaissance
 forces operating vigilantly around the clock.  Only such an air
 force is in a position to achieve a strategic, though not neces-
 sarily physical, invulnerability.
 In former wars, material strength was the decisive factor.
 The speed with' which fire power could be delivered was an
 important but still a subsidiary element.      The nature of a
 future war is essentially no longer a dispute about territory but
 a competition for gains in the time dimension. This is because,
 in the first place, technology is a variable in time.  The speed
 with which this factor varies will continue to increase as long
 as technological progress continues.  In the second place, sur-
 prise being a key to success in air and missile warfare, the initial
 rounds of conflict are little more than a contest to operate
 faster than the opponent.  Surprise attack will be successful
 if the attacker moves faster than the defender.  It will fail if
 the defender's "reaction time" deprives him of targets and dis-
 rupts the attack schedule.
 Intelligence must come to closer grips with the time dimen-
 sion.                                                                                                                       We are dealing not with one uniform period but with a
 whole set of different time categories.  There is the time prob-
 lem of maturing manpower, scientific discovery, and technolog-
 ical invention - measured in generations.  There is the dura-
 tion of research and development programs, decisionmaking,
 production, and incorporation of weapons into battle orders -
 a period of years to decades.  There is the complex problem of
 warning - ranging all the way from advanced strategic warn-
 ing measured in weeks, months, or even years, to tactical warn-
 ing, measured in minutes.                                                                                                                                 There is the problem of reaction
 time and interception, measured in seconds and microseconds.

 Pre-emptive, retaliation, deterrence, counterforce, retarda-
 tion, and disruption attacks all, in one way or another, are tied
 to a specific time requirement.  The more mobile warfare be-
 comes, the more moving targets are assuming significance, the
 less it is a question of mere "capability" than of "capability in
 time."  An airplane carrying a high yield weapon can knock
 out an air base; the problem is to destroy it at a time when the
 target will be most lucrative - for example, just before the
 moment when an attack is to be launched from that target.
 Need I add that only intelligence can provide this all-impor-
 tant "timing capability"?
 Perhaps an additional illustration will clarify this thesis fur-
 ther: "Reaction time in guided missiles."  It is important to
 count missiles in terms of numbers, warhead yields, and the
 like.  But the foremost problem is that of reaction time or
 response.
 If it takes a strategic missile force four hours to launch,
 whereas the opponent can launch within minutes, the obvious
 advantage belongs to the side with the shorter reaction time
 - provided it has adequate warning. The 4-hour reacting force
 will never leave the ground; its threat will be pre-empted.  If
 this is correct, it appears to be a mistake for intelligence to
 count the degree of deterrent power primarily in numbers of
 missiles or warhead yields.  It will be necessary to assess, above
 all, relative times of reaction.
 Earlier we discussed the new parameters of altitude.  It is
 appropriate, I believe, that we reflect on the purpose of operat-
 ing at such altitudes.  The use of outer space will permit al-
 most continuous observation of any point on the earth, a situa-
 tion which, although not entirely without precedent, marks
 a new departure in modern strategic warfare.  Space platforms
 are becoming indispensable elements of effective warning sys-
 tems against future means of weapons delivery.  Unless we
 conquer space, a great deal of the scientific knowledge which
 we require to remain in the technological race will not be avail-
 able.
 Furthermore, orbiting vehicles eventually will be used as
 weapon carriers and thus will develop into crucial components
 of offensive and defensive missile warfare.
 All this poses the spectre of outer space military conflict
 which will involve three phases:  first, the competition to get
 vehicles into space in sufficient quantities to occupy desirable
 orbits and to make profitable scientific use of orbital flights;
 second, the development of military techniques for operating
 from our own orbits and for countering the enemy's militarily
 significant orbital activities; and third, the ability to neutralize
 or destroy terrestrial and aerial components of orbital systems
 This new sphere of warfare raises some perplexing problems
 in world relations.  In addition to traditional surface bound-
 aries, there will arise sovereignties over vacuous orbits and the
 areas beneath them-a system of interlaced surface and spatial
 boundaries thousands of miles in depth and tens of thousands
 of miles in length.
 A new pattern of international relations must be developed in
 which orbits are occupied peacefully or conquered and in which
 orbits must be delineated.  During peacetime the nations must
 respect each other's scientific and security operations in the
 orbits, and in wartime, of course, the purpose will be to elimi-
 nate all of the opponent's space vehicles. In turn, there must
 be capabilities for protecting the satellites.  It is clear that this
 involves entirely new types of "aerial" operations, as it is also
 clear that the diplomats and international lawyers will have to
 do some hard thinking to settle peacefully the problems of orbit
 allocation and orbit sovereignty.
 The introduction of the orbital dimension into warfare sig-
 nifies that factors such as Iron Curtains, the dispersal of air
 bases and missile sites, and the ability of navies to "hide," so to
 speak, in the vastness of the oceans will tend to lose signifi-
 cance. The nature of the new implements is definitive enough
 to suggest that the use of truly underground and of undersea
 facilities may dominate the terrestrial scene.  As a result, the
 roles and techniques of surprise will undergo very profound
 changes, the exact nature of which we cannot predict.
 For a nation to exist and survive under these conditions, its
 intelligence system must become a predominant security tech-
 nique.  Such a system must meet three criteria: global cover-
 age, instantaneous discovery, and absolute accuracy.  The sys-
 tem must be fully operational both in war and peace. Intelli-
 gence must be run not only for the benefit of, but by those who
 are responsible for decisions of life or death.
 I believe I have reached the point where it is necessary to
 examine this strategic framework with its epochal implications

 in the practical light of where we are today and to consider the
 future directions we must take.
 The problems of strategic and technological surprise are
 becoming increasingly serious.  The danger of tactical sur-
 prise is not lessened when the enemy, in addition to a high alti-
 tude and rapid strike capability, also has a capability for low
 altitude air attack and may be developing mixed high and low
 altitude offensive forces.
 Taking an even broader view, we can say that the nuclear
 explosive and the supersonic delivery vehicle have appeared at
 a moment when society is quite defenseless against such weap-
 ons.  During the last few centuries, war has taken place at the
 margins of society.  Society supported the war from its produc-
 tion surpluses and remained intact as a going concern despite
 losses and devastations.
 You recall that during ancient times, the situation was dif-
 ferent.  During the Middle Ages, every town had to be self-
 sufficient for defense, with walls, moats, shelters, food, and
 water reserves.  Practically every citizen had to bear arms.
 The American frontier town serves as a more recent example
 of this dangerous way of life.
 I believe that society eventually will adjust itself to the mod-
 em technology of destruction.  Perhaps we may have to be-
 come troglodytes; our ancestors were.  Architects may develop
 new types of resistant houses and "safe" urban settlements.
 Perhaps we shall develop anti-radiation protection.  The prin-
 ciple of "hardening" can be applied to many human needs.
 I am predicting only that the human mind will not stop in-
 venting.  After it realizes the grim threat of modern weapons,
 society gradually but inevitably will take measures to assure
 its survival.  I am basing this prediction on my faith that mod-
 ern man, morally and intellectually, is not inferior to previous
 generations of 700 and 2500 years ago.
 Whether this process of social adjustment is going to last
 20 or perhaps 50 years I am unable to say.  But during this
 interim phase, humanity well may be passing through the
 greatest peril of its existence.  A war five years. from now prob-
 ably will be immeasurably more destructive than a war around
 2000 A. D.  Our security, therefore, must be tailored to get us
 and the Free World safely through this immediate period of
 extreme hazard.
 SECRET                       17
 It is this interim character of the present military situation
 which confronts us with many perplexing problems. Defense
 planning, which includes intelligence, is faced with numerous
 paradoxes.
 In this age of maximum offensive strength, there may be a
 great deal of reluctance to use up-to-date weapons, simply be-
 cause no one wants to unleash a nuclear war.  Yet we must
 prepare ourselves for a contest which requires us to put the
 bulk of our resources into nuclear armaments. As a result,
 we may have only limited capabilities to wage war in which
 nuclear weapons do not provide the basic fire power.
 Yet some people have gone so far as to advocate the retention
 of full-fledged non-nuclear forces in addition to atomic forces.
 It is generally agreed that we should prepare ourselves to fight
 with nuclear weapons.  Yet some contend that we also should
 retain a capability to fight in the style of World War II - high
 explosives on the ground, at sea, and even from the air.
 We probably could agree that the availability of non-nuclear
 forces would be very advantageous.  Several types of non-nu-
 clear explosives will remain with us, even in the nuclear age.
 Under certain tactical conditions, those may be even more ef-
 fective than nuclear materials, which is the main reason why
 they should be retained.
 Unfortunately, the question is not one of advantage or dis-
 advantage, or even of choice.  The question is one of capability
 in all aspects -manpower, military organization, research,
 funds, training, equipment, tactics, and so on.
 Suppose that we maintain both a nuclear and a non-nuclear
 defense establishment.  There is the high probability or near-
 certainty that the investment in non-nuclear arms would be
 invalidated as soon as the first atomic weapons are used.  This
 will happen, almost inevitably, at the first serious military set-
 back of either belligerent.
 But the question of non-nuclear armaments is not just a
 matter of duplication.  The cost of matching atomic systems
 with non-nuclear weapons in terms of relative military effec-
 tiveness would be exorbitant.  More significant, such a second
 force could not be established on any reasonable scale unless
 we acquire two sets of our national resources, two sets of our
 qualified manpower, and two sets of our country.

 I am not raising the issue of limited versus general war.  The
 requirements of any local war situation can be met from avail-
 able and programmed forces and resources.
 Rather, I am addressing myself to the problem of attempt-
 ing to build a non-nuclear force at the expense of our atomic
 strike and defense units, which must be maintained at an in-
 creasing degree of readiness because of the overwhelming pri-
 ority of the Soviet nuclear threat to the US and the Free
 World.  We cannot turn back.  There may be a collapse of
 nuclear courage, but no longer can there be any doubt that
 we have crossed the nuclear Rubicon.
 A similar paradox confronts us in disarmament.  If the
 danger of attack could be eliminated by reductions of force
 levels and by the outlawing of particular types of weapons, the
 security of all nations unquestionably would be enhanced.  The
 trouble is that with the power of modern weapons, even minor
 infractions to disarmament agreements may prove fatal.
 After 1919, the Western Powers tried to control German arm-
 aments.  But practically every week a German arms violation
 of the Versailles Treaty was reported.  Many work shops re-
 peatedly were discovered in which, it was said, machine guns
 were being produced under the guise of baby carriages.
 Nevertheless, the security of the Western Powers did not
 seem vitally threatened, despite the fact that the Germans
 maintained secret arsenals and continued surreptitiously to
 produce weapons which they were not supposed to have. These
 weapons did not seem powerful enough to pose a real threat to
 Western security.  Neither were the camouflaged divisions
 which the Germans maintained secretly.
 But in our time a nation which produces perhaps as few as
 50, or as many as several hundred high-yield weapons could
 become a real threat to the peace, even with makeshift delivery
 vehicles, especially if other nations faithfully adhere to their
 disarmament agreements.  You are well aware of ominous in-
 fractions to such agreements in North Korea.
 The point is that we cannot go back in history and undo the
 discoveries of nuclear fission, electronics, and aviation.  We
 have to live in the modern world.  Technological progress
 tend to "break through" even the most elaborate and sophist",
 cated disarmament "controls."  Each breakthrough will neces

 sitate renegotiation of agreements.  There will be little, if any,
 stability and durability, let alone guarantee of assured inter-
 national safety in such arrangements.
 I confess that this is a very dismal picture.  It will not be
 changed by expectations that the human race will become
 peaceful and angelic in the next 20 years.     There are two
 brutal facts which we have to remember.  The first is that the
 Soviet regime still is around.  Although it sometimes seems to
 be showing signs of middle or even old age, there is no new
 evidence that proves that Kipling was wrong when he wrote:
 "Make ye no peace with Adanizod, the Bear who walks like a
 man."
 The Soviets have not changed their basic objectives.  Their
 policies have remained constant in areas that count, including
 their fantastic military preparedness effort.  It is clear that
 the Soviets do not expect that the millennium of peace has
 dawned.  While they prepare for war we cannot turn our backs.
 When they talk conflict, we cannot risk to ignore the peril.
 When they arm themselves with the most modern weapons, we
 cannot reduce the magnitude of the threat by wishful thinking
 about their supposed inability to do that which manifestly they
 are doing.
 We can philosophize that the Soviet Union will enter into an
 evolution which, after some time, will transform the present
 Bolsheviks into Jeffersonian Democrats or Puritan pacifists.  I
 do not believe that anyone who has studied Russian and other
 revolutionary history seriously expects such a mutation will
 take place.
 Naturally, I do not postulate eternity for the Soviet system:
 their time will come.  The question is, when?  So far, reports
 about their demise usually proved quite "exaggerated."  Their
 resilience has been extraordinary. Distinguishing our hopes
 from realistic planning assumptions, we would be foolhardy not
 to give them an additional life expectancy of one or two
 decades.  We must assume that they will remain in power dur-
 ing the entire period when the technological challenge to the
 US will be at a maximum.
 It is not certain, of course, that the Soviets deliberately will
 launch an attack on the US.  But at the same time we cannot
 be sure they will not.  In the same vein, there is no doubt but
 that the social system of Russia is changing in many ways.

 But is this necessarily a favorable development?  One danger
 surely is that if the Soviet dictatorship were liquidated by force
 or otherwise, this event - which only optimists expect at this
 time -could precipitate a major internal crisis.  Such a crisis
 would be uncontrollable. This means that it could lead very
 easily to a world conflagration.  There just is no way by which
 we could conjure away the ominous dangers in our future.
 This leads me to the second point of pessimism about peace
 in the foreseeable future.  It is a mistake to consider the Bol-
 sheviks as the only cause of conflict.  Wherever we look at the
 continents today, there is plenty of politically combustionable
 material.  Old political structures are breaking down.  New
 nations are emerging.     Most of them have their own imperi-
 alistic ambitions, and some of the older nations show frighten-
 ing signs of decay.  Economic difficulties, cultural transfor-
 mations, intellectual crises, and ideological passions acerbate
 many of these political changes, not to mention inflammatory
 propaganda campaigns, political warfare, and the like.
 Unfortunately many of the political minds still function as
 though we were living in the time of gun powder and sea power.
 Few have grasped the significance of the modern technology.
 There is a dangerous timelag between political thinking and
 technological reality.  As industrial technology advances,
 psychological stability weakens.  We must admit the possi-
 bility that world society will grow sicker and ever more un-
 stable, even as the descendants of Icarus reach out for the
 moon.
 It is unjustified, therefore, to expect that all nations will
 observe restraint in order to avoid nuclear conflict.  Perhaps
 most nations will, but the odds are that there will be a few who
 will act irresponsibly.  Hitler was not the last specimen of his
 type.
 Recent sociological research asserts that a large percentage
 of political rulers and regimes have been, historically speaking,
 criminal in motivation and action.  There is no doubt that
 many rulers, especially those who acquired unlimited powers,
 may have been, at least partly, insane.  In fact, a German
 historian coined the term "Caesarian insanity" in order to
 describe the actions of many Roman emperors.
 Although we have made some political progress, the world
 nevertheless has had more than its share of insane, criminal,!.
 SECRET                     21
 and power-hungry rulers during the 20th century.  Crime and
 insanity rates tend to rise as industrial civilization advances.
 It may be very convincing to us to say that because of the
 existence of hydrogen weapons the power-seekers should mend
 their ways.  This type of argument remains unconvincing to
 the evil doer who is willing to accept the risk, regardless of the
 consequences.
 There is only one way to reduce the probability of criminal
 aggressiveness.  That is, to remain militarily overpowering
 and mentally more vigilant than the would-be aggressor - to
 outsmart and outarm him at every turn and to apply per-
 suasive techniques to protect him - and us - from making a
 miscalculation.  It is not enough to possess what could be
 called a "statistical posture of deterrence."  The aggressor also
 must be convinced that it is inadvisable for him to break the
 peace.  But do we master the techniques by which we could
 have such an impact on the opponent's mind?
 We are in the midst of a lasting crisis which Mao Tse-tung
 has described as "protracted conflict."  Political and psycho-
 logical weapons are being used every day to advance the Com-
 munist cause.  In modern conflict, even though actual shoot-
 ing may not be taking place, air power and the threat of almost
 instantaneous massive destruction have become the key ele-
 ments of the psychological as well as the physical struggle.
 The extent to which we can deter the opponent from attack-
 ing us determines our freedom of action on many of the world's
 battlefields.  If the level of our ready deterrent strength is too
 low to provide the assurance that the enemy will not react with
 an all-out attack, we could be inhibited in executing proper
 defense actions in subsidiary theaters.
 Deterrence is a necessary condition for the maintenance of
 peace - and the waging of limited war - but it cannot be a
 static condition if it is to keep that peace.  If any nation
 acquires a more effective weapons system, the best posture of
 deterrence existing before the technological mutation is subject
 to rapid nullification.  We live in a world where the threats to
 tomorrow's peace are developing today in the laboratories and
 on the drawing boards.
 It is true that so long as the two main competitors run neck
 to neck, even a major advantage in one or more technological
 fields may not necessarily upset the balance.  A state of mu-

 tual deterrence may be reached which essentially would mean
 that a world conflagration could occur against the deliberate
 planning of both the US and the Soviet Union.  Hence I do not
 believe that the Soviets merely are trying to catch up in the
 technological race.  On the contrary, they seem to have organ-
 ized themselves to win the technological race on a broad front,
 not only in many significant scientific areas but also in combat
 operational strengths as distinguished from mockups and pro-
 totypes.  In other words, they may be trying to surpass us
 simultaneously by at least one whole and perhaps two weapons
 generations.
 The technological race is the very essence of protracted con-
 flict.                                                    It is the main event which we cannot afford to lose. The
 essence of this conflict is not, as many of our contemporaries
 believe, a series of limited wars in the jungle and in the desert.
 Any American intervention into limited war depends crucially
 upon our relative technological posture.  If we lose the tech-
 nological race we cannot fight on local and regional fronts.
 Nor will an increase in our capability to fight in Bali or Tim-
 buctu improve our over-all deterrence.  It certainly is not likely
 that, should the US fall behind in technological capability, the
 Russians will press their advantage merely to get a few fringe
 benefits.  The struggle between Rome and Carthage is more
 meaningful to our times than the formalized and restrained
 war-tournaments of some epochs in the history of Christian
 Europe.
 Technological superiority in means of delivery is the essence
 of success in nuclear war.  The idea that nuclear war will take
 the form of an exchange of mutual blows perhaps forecasts Ii
 correctly what is going to happen.  However, this is not neces-
 sarily a concept on which the military planner should work.
 The purpose of planning for nuclear war is to achieve such a
 predominance of strength that a nuclear blow can be delivered,
 without the undue risk that a deadly retaliatory blow will be
 returned.  Even the Soviet military leaders who, during the
 Stalinist period, belittled the importance of military surprise:
 now appear to recognize that surprise could be the condition
 of nuclear success.
 The acquisition and maintenance of a dynamic capability to'
 deliver a rapid and devastating blow - plus a proportionately,
 dynamic defense - are prerequisites to survival.  The natio
 SECRET                     23
 which insures that its retaliatory force is, in fact, effective at
 all times, is obtaining maximum protection against preventive
 and pre-emptive attacks. The success of preventive war and
 pre-emptive nuclear launchings depends upon the achieve-
 ment of triple or quadruple surprise - technological, tactical,
 timing, and conceivably strategic.  The US can keep its re-
 taliatory guard up only if it is able to render those surprises
 too costly, too impractical, and too uncertain.  Thus surprise
 attack will be too risky for enemy resort only if the US keeps
 ahead in technology and intelligence, as well as in its force
 levels and, above all, in reaction times.
 Should we lose tempo and should one or more of these four
 pillars of our security crumble, the enemy's superiority may
 become such that he need not use nuclear weapons except as a
 threat.  The so-called ultimate threat of large hydrogen weap-
 ons could become "demilitarized" - by manipulated fear.
 Suppose the aggressor says: "I grant that you can retaliate,
 but you will be completely devastated through my first blows.
 We leave it to you whether or not you want to elect your own
 death.   If you retaliate, you will die, at best with the comfort-
 ing thought that you have killed some of us.  Or you may
 survive under our whip.  That is your alternative."  It is
 known that the Soviets are doing considerable research on
 conditioned reflexes and brain-washing techniques.  Manipu-
 lated fear and the conditioning of the opponents' mental and
 psychological reactions are strategic concomitants to nuclear
 weapons.  The Soviets don't overlook a bet.
 Previous wars have lasted for years.  Ever since the emer-
 gence of a modem industrial society with its long mobilization
 requirements, war could not be short. A future war may be
 decided within a matter of a few hours. I think it is wrong,
 however, to place all attention on the destructive phase of this
 type of conflict.
 in previous times, the length of the war allowed us to remedy
 the shortcomings and omissions of peace.  Today and tomor-
 row, once the climax of the conflict has come, we shall be the
 prisoners of our previous decisions.  In that critical phase we
 shall not be able to increase our force levels, acquire a new set
 of technological weapons, adjust our tactics to outdo those of
 the enemy, or even reassure the fearful and give orders to the
 panicky.

 .The protracted conflict may last longer than any previous
 war.   Although the climactic or decision phase of this conflict
 may be short, still, the conflict could endure for many decades.
 We are in the battle now. As a consequence, the main battles
 are being fought by military forces in continued readiness, by
 warning and intelligence services, by the research and develop-
 ment community, by national and industrial planners, and by
 budget makers, as well as by moral and intellectual attitudes.
 Militarily speaking, the decisive phase could be won or lost
 by the staff and operational officers who 5 to 10 years before
 the shooting select or reject certain weapons systems, succeed
 or fail in shortening lead times, organize offensive and de-
 fensive forces, determine the balance between force elements,
 and plan deployment and reaction times.  It also may be won
 or lost by the executive and congressional branches which de-
 cide, with a timelag of 2 to 3 years, the force levels to be main-
 tained in any technological phase; by the weapons require-
 ment, procurement, and logistics planners within the military;
 and by industry, all of whom, together, have the task of devel-
 oping and producing superior weapons faster and in larger
 quantity than the enemy; finally, by intelligence officers who
 must try to forecast the relative strengths and weaknesses of
 the strategic equation 5 to 10 years ahead.  The latter will suc-
 ceed - or fail - depending on whether or not they convince
 the powers-that-be that their best estimates are valid.
 In protracted conflict, the climactic phase may be war in its
 most extreme form.  If the climax is a matter merely of threat
 and surrender, it will be the most "peaceful" of all wars. To
 intelligence its most significant aspect should be that pro-
 tracted conflict is a war during peace.
 It is easy to enumerate the need to win the technological race,
 the requirements for adequate numbers of weapons and forces,
 the advantage of hardened and dispersed base locations, the ti
 necessity for fast reaction times, and so forth.  But the basic
 reason these requirements are difficult to satisfy is that no'.,
 nation has the economic capability to live up to the exigencies.,
 of protracted conflict in the early period of the nuclear age.
 I am not talking about budgets which can be increased anct,
 I do not mean various degrees of economic mobiliza
 tion and readiness.  Rather, I refer to more fundamental,
 limitations.
 SECRET
 To win the technological race a nation needs numerical and
 qualitative superiority in technicians and inventive geniuses.
 Unless the most revolutionary educational changes are made,
 it is unlikely that sufficient scientists and technicians will be
 produced to satisfy the growing needs of increasingly complex
 military programs.  Even a program which marshaled all edu-
 cational resources into scientific and technical curricula prob-
 ably would be inadequate for acquiring that degree of technical
 superiority and material effort which makes the launching of a
 nuclear attack or the psychological threat of such an attack
 a relatively riskless affair.
 The cost of weapons systems is rising geometrically, while the
 increase in productive capabilities proceeds much slower.
 There is the problem of protecting and rebuilding our cities and
 facilities to survive in a nuclear environment.  This is a prob-
 lem - so far largely untouched -- which clearly accentuates
 the severe limitations on our economic capabilities to meet the
 challenge of the nuclear age.  In this time of economic plenty,
 scarcity still is the supreme fact of civilian and, above all, mili-
 tary economics.
 Material resources are not the only limiting factor.  Time,
 which is a major resource, also is in short supply.  For ex-
 ample, the time needed to transform a blueprint into a modern
 weapons system has become such that a military force never
 possesses an active arsenal without at least some obsolescence.
 I mean obsolescent in the sense that certain tasks simply can-
 not be accomplished against opposition or must be undertaken
 at excessive risks and costs.
 There is one inescapable conclusion from this discrepancy
 between requirement and capability.  It is this: the future
 strategist has the potential choice of an entire technological
 spectrum of weapons.  At least several weapons systems will be
 able to do the same task.
 Because of the technological potential available to both sides,
 he will have to decide whether to select a faster or slower
 weapon, an explosive with greater or lower yield, a weapon of
 endurance or of stealth.  Should he guard against high or low
 level attack?  Should he dispense with manned bombers in
 favor of missiles?  Should he select  an  earth satellite
 "anchored" approximately 21,000 miles above its target to de-

 which to la

 a missile?
 In practical terms the strategist can select only a limited
 number of systems from this entire technical spectrum, which
 will grow as we progress further into the scientific era. Strat-
 egists on the other side have to make similar eliminations.
 The chances are that the choices may not be identical because
 of different strategic objectives, production capabilities, opera-
 tional doctrines, concepts of defensive warfare, and so forth.
 In turn, because the choices probably will be different on both
 sides, the possibility of surprise and other major military in-
 itiatives will increase.
 Therefore, intelligence must forecast, in ample time and cor-
 rectly, the enemy selection so that proper defenses can be de-
 signed.  Of course, the choice of the enemy may impose the
 need for counterweapons, which may have a feedback against
 our original weapons choice.
 It is necessary to insure that the relationship between what
 we actually have and what we require to counter the enemy's
 principal threats is such th

 we are notti

 If we made a poor or overly narrow selection from the spec-
 trum, if intelligence fails to guide the research and develop-
 ment community concerning the enemy's probable selections,
 we might invite attack, provide inadequate defense, and jeop-
 ardize life and liberty.  But if our intelligence is keen and our
 armament effort generous we might ensure peace for the period

 SECRET
 In this area, we do not seem to have matched their strategic
 comprehension.  We are said to have made the decision never
 to strike the first blow.  At the same time we have neglected to
 introduce sufficiently into our thinking the fact that if the
 opponent is allowed opportunity to achieve a broad tactical suc-
 cess through an initial blow, the retaliatory strategy must be
 more costly and complicated in order to compensate for the
 risk and loss which could occur at the outset and weaken the
 retaliatory force before it goes into battle.
 Under the postulate that the enemy strikes first, defense
 must be more expensive than under the postulate that we shall
 not surrender the initiative.  It follows that we must not be re-
 luctant to pay the price of our security against an opponent to
 whom we present the gift of the deliberate surprise attack.
 The technological race has engulfed us exactly as a fast flow-
 ing river occasionally catches the unsuspecting oarsman. Such
 a situation cannot be met and overcome by preaching to the
 river, by throwing away the oars, or by using only one of two
 hands.  In such a situation, all skills and all strengths are
 needed to ride out the rapids and not get smashed against the
 rocks.
 The fundamental conclusion I want to leave is that the tech-
 nological race, because of various economic limitations and po-
 litical climates, may not be won by any super power engaging
 in the competition, even with all its strengths.  But this race
 very well may be lost by a country which fails to put its con-
 tinued best efforts into the challenge.
 It is to a large extent the duty of the national intelligence
 community to explain to our nation's leadership the true na-
 ture of this strategic problem.  I pray that we will not fail in
 this task which is indispensable not only to our survival but to
 the survival of civilization.
 Intelligence has been getting the facts about the Soviet Bloc,
 or at least enough of them to enable many right decisions to be
 made.  But we have not been able, often enough, to get our
 Information and evaluations accepted and acted upon.  The
 somber fact is that as professional intelligence people we have
 not entirely grasped the meaning of protracted conflict in the
 nuclear missile age.
 I believe it not unfair to state also that as professional intel-
 ligence people we have been disappointingly slow in under-

 standing the nature of the pressing problems which are con-
 fronting us.  Only too often our categories of analysis and esti-
 mates still reflect the strategic realities of a passing age.  We
 know all about the deposits of even the least important raw
 materials, but we may miss major scientific discoveries. Our
 battle orders of the infantry are considerably better than those
 of earth satellites.  We are adept in measuring floorspace, but
 we are rarely engaged in comparing lead times.  We are able
 to refine our calculations of weapons yields to the first decimal,
 but the analysts worrying about Soviet neuropsychology have
 yet to break through to the national estimates. We produce
 mountains of "data," but our progress in data handling para-
 phrases Lenin's title, "one step forward, two steps backward."
 We are considerably better in post mortems than in warning.
 Our understanding of man's greatest resource, time, has re-
 mained fuzzy in most areas.
 All in all, although we often express our conviction as to how
 important intelligence is to national security, we ourselves have
 not quite realized the crucial position we are occupying in the
 present power struggle.  It is really the effectiveness of intel-
 ligence which, together with the effectiveness of our scientists,
 is the basis of technology.  Beyond the development phase, in-
 telligence is either. a multiplier or a divisor of military strength-
 in-being.  It is the one "weapons system" which by necessity
 is in constant touch with the enemy, regardless of whether
 there is war or peace.  And in war, of course, intelligence re-
 mains a key condition of success.
 But we must elevate our sights beyond the old saw of intel-
 ligence being the "first line of defense."  Intelligence is the fac
 for which should make defense economically practical, tech
 nologically superior, and strategically victorious. In the mils
 sile age, intelligence literally will merge with the decisive weap=
 ens system, lest the missiles be entirely ineffective.
 But intelligence will not be able to do this job unless it com
 of age as a technological system in its own right.  We mus
 get the equipment our ubiquitous, instantaneous, and ency
 clopedic mission requires.  We must have the forces to opera'
 these tools.  We must develop utilization techniques which
 at par with or better than those equipments.  And we m
 be able rapidly to feed our information to all users.
 One feature will remain unchanged: the ability to think.
 Electric computers and space telescopes are no substitutes for
 common sense and judgment.  Reasoning by false analogy;
 preoccupation with minor problems to the detriment of major
 issues, emphasis on decimals and disregard for the large magni-
 tude, wrong philosophies about the rules of evidence, delusion-
 ary procedures such as the piling of estimates upon estimates
 - not to mention normal human failings such as prejudices,
 wishful thinking, parochial interest arguments, and subver-
 sion - all those will remain possible in the era of technologi-
 cal warfare.  The machines, even the electrons, are no better
 than the brains they are designed to serve.  It is gratifying
 to think that when the machine proves to be inadequate - for
 example, because it may take three months to "program" it -
 common sense and "conventional thinking" still will be called
 upon to take its place.
 The plain fact is that the machine, however good, will not
 replace the analyst.  The machine will make the human brain
 a more powerful tool - this is the main reason we need it in
 intelligence. Intelligence technology is indispensable for the
 rapid handling of thousands of data and for the reduction of
 innumerable variables to manageable factors.  This technology
 is the key to speed, coverage, and accuracy; to computation;
 and to experimentation with, and testing of, our conclusions
 and estimates (for example, through "gaining" techniques).
 But intuition and insight are necessary to make the ma-
 chines work.  In turn, intelligence technology will make its
 greatest contribution if it allows deeper insights and ever more
 creative intuitions.  Man has remained the key factor in tech-
 nological warfare, as he was the key to victory when rocks and
 clubs were the most powerful weapons.  Military, or in a
 broader sense, conflict intelligence will be at its best when it
 is based on brain intelligence:  IQ's plus wisdom.
 Pending the dawn of the technological age in intelligence,
 we should face up more courageously to the facts of life, how-
 ever bitter.
 As a nation and as the core of the Free World alliance, we
 have been underrating the danger for more than twelve years.

 CONCEPTS FOR A PHILOSOPHY
 OF AIR INTELLIGENCE
 Lewis R. Long
 I should like to set forth certain concepts for air intelligence
 that I feel would vitalize an air intelligence philosophy and
 could lead to an air intelligence policy and doctrine consistent
 with the dominant role that air power must play in the years
 to come.  I make no claim of originality in all these concepts;
 nor do I consider that they alone would form a sound air intel-
 ligence doctrine.  However, together with the valid concepts
 contained in the doctrinal manuals, they would, I am con-
 vinced, provide better guidance to the field than has hereto-
 fore been available.
 I should like to emphasize that all the concepts presented
 are meant to be applied within the framework of one overrid-
 ing concept for a philosophy of air intelligence - that air intel-
 ligence is geared to air power in a nuclear age. and that it has
 the same predominant characteristics as has the air force -
 range, speed, mobility, flexibility, and penetrative ability.
 Because air forces have the capability of flying to any point
 on the globe and returning to any desired location, air intelli-
 gence must provide basic information to guide such flights in
 peace or in war.  Because air forces exert a dynamic impact on
 all forms of international relations, air intelligence must be pre-
 pared to expose for the scrutiny of air commanders the entire
 structure of other nations and to advise and assist in the deter-
 mination of air strategy and policies.
 In the established principles for the successful employment
 of air forces it is considered that the air forces are an entity.
 gven so, air intelligence must be considered indivisible and re-
 sponsive at all levels of operation to employment as a single
 aggregate instrument.  Air intelligence must be employed for
 the attainment of a common objective, which - in essence -
 Is to contribute to the security of the nation.  Air intelligence
 provides the key to proper employment of the air forces in ex-
 esdaing the initiative in many different conditions of interna-
 tional relations, in taking advantage of different opportunities

 as they occur, and also in creating opportunities in which bene-
 fits to the US may accrue by the utilization of air forces in peace
 or in war. Air intelligence must also guide the air force in ex-
 ploiting the principle of surprise, in order to attain both mili-
 tary and psychological advantages through speed, deception,
 audacity, originality, and concentration. For the present, air
 intelligence must concentrate on indications of imminence of
 hostilities, without neglecting information on capabilities and
 vulnerabilities of potential enemy countries.  This concentra-
 tion of effort not only will contribute to the security of our
 forces. but also will provide guidance for combat operations if
 war is forced upon us. Finally, air intelligence must be care-
 fully coordinated through proper control.
 CONCEPT NUMBER ONE.  Intelligence agencies are never
 more at war than in periods of nominal peace.  The logical out-
 growth of this concept is, of course, the fact that the success
 of the initial phases of war (and in this thermonuclear age
 these probably will also constitute the decisive phases) will de-
 pend on the quality of intelligence produced in peace.  Most
 people can understand and pay lip service, at least, to the lat-
 ter idea, but they balk completely at a rational consideration of
 the first one when it comes to providing tangible support
 needed by the intelligence structure.  I have never, in peace-
 time, seen an intelligence staff at any echelon that was not
 undermanned, overworked, and restricted in its operations by
 a lack of real appreciation on the part of the command for the
 goals the intelligence section had set for itself to accomplish
 in the light of the command mission.
 At all echelons intelligence staffs must have adequate num=
 bers of the best qualified personnel, maximum equipment, facil
 ities, and funds; maximum freedom of action; and coequal
 status with other major staff elements. It can be categorically,
 stated that if the air force intelligence structure had all the
 support it could profitably employ - and fully Justify-in
 peacetime, its resources would be ample for any type of war W,
 might become involved in.
 Let us now analyse each of the requirements (personnel, m
 terial support, freedom of action, and coequal status) in to
 of what other writers have had to say, bearing in mind th
 three basic intelligence missions: to provide timely warnin
 the imminence of hostilities (whether on a total or limited w
 CONFIDENTIAL                  33
 basis); to provide detailed knowledge of the capabilities and
 vulnerabilities of potential enemy nations and of friendly and
 neutral nations; and to provide the best possible intelligence as
 to the intentions of foreign nations, particularly those that are
 our potential enemies.
 PERSONNEL.  During wartime, all the services drew heavily
 on civilian professions for manning intelligence posts.  Law-
 yers, insurance adjustors, investigators, police enforcement of-
 ficers, scientific and technical personnel, and teachers were put
 into uniform; and, by and large, these people carried the intel-
 ligence workload of the services.  By and large, too, their con-
 tributions compared favorably with those of professional mili-
 tary people.  There have been numerous attempts made to
 identify the qualifications for intelligence personnel. Farago'
 lists ten major groups of traits which "the good spy is supposed
 to possess" in -order to qualify for that particular aspect of
 intelligence work.  For the most part, these same traits could
 be used as a starting basis for selection of personnel for other
 intelligence tasks.
 First of all, his morale must be high and he must be
 genuinely interested in the job ahead.
 Second, he must be energetic, zealous, and enterpris-
 ing.
 Third, he must be resourceful, a quick and practical
 thinker.  He must have good judgment and know how
 to deal with things, people, and ideas. He must be pro-
 ficient in some occupational skill.
 Fourth, he must be emotionally stable, capable of great
 endurance under stress.  He must be calm and quiet,
 tolerant and healthy.
 Fifth, he must have the ability to get along with other
 people, to work as a member of a team, to understand
 the foibles of others while being reasonably free of the
 same foibles himself.
 Sixth, he must know how to inspire collaboration, to
 organize, administer and lead others. He must be will-
 Ing to accept responsibility.

 Seventh, he must be discreet, have a passion for ano-

 serve a secret.
 Eighth, he must be able to bluff and mislead, but only
 when bluffing and misleading become necessary.
 Ninth, he must be agile, rugged, and daring.

 MATERIAL SUPPORT.  I should like to stress the importance
 of allocating the maximum in equipment, facilities, and funds
 to intelligence work in time of peace with a quotation from
 Sun Tzu,2 the Chinese military oracle, whose writings on the
 art of war in 500 B. C. have influenced military thinking down
 to this day.
 Hostile armies may face each other for years, striv-
 ing for victory which is decided in a single day.  This
 being so, to remain in ignorance of the enemy's condi-
 tion simply because one grudges the outlay of a hun-
 dred ounces of silver in honors and emoluments is the
 height of inhumanity.
 One who acts thus is no leader of men, no present
 help to his sovereign, no master of victory.
 Thus, what enables the wise sovereign and the good
 general to strike and conquer, and achieve things be-
 yond the reach of ordinary men, is foreknowledge.
 In speaking of the cost of the British secret service as
 whole (both positive and counterintelligence), Seth noted:3
 In 1913 the Secret Services cost 46,000 pounds; in
 1939, 500,000 pounds; during the recent war 52,000,-
 000 pounds annually; and in 1953, 5,000,000 pounds.
 It is worth many times this amount, for though

 are now more extensive than at any time in. this cenr
 tury, British secret service still maintains its lead in
 performance and results.
 Farago gives a somewhat different order of magnitude for
 British expenditures for intelligence.  He said that the 1954
 budget was three million pounds and that this amount was the
 highest in the entire history of the British Secret Service.  He
 pointed out, however, that this figure is deceptive because it
 represents only allotments from public funds and he adds:
 "The bulk of Britain's intelligence revenue comes from private
 funds, such as dividends of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company,
 some of whose shares are held by the Admiralty." 4
 Farago then gave an indication of what US military services
 are spending for intelligence.  In fiscal year 1955, the Army
 asked for $54,454,000 for intelligence, and for fiscal years 1952-
 54, inclusive, the Army spent a total of $176,400,000 on intelli-
 gence.  Yet this represented less than one-half of one percent
 of the total Army budget .5  Then, stressing his thesis that the
 cold war is a "War of Wits," Farago pointed out relative ex-
 penditures for intelligence in the Continental Army and in the
 services today: 6
 Between 1776 and 1781, George Washington spent
 approximately eleven percent of his entire military
 budget on intelligence operations. The fact that today
 we spend less than one percent of our peacetime mili-
 tary budget on these same activities shows how little
 effort is being made to solve the "friction" by intel-
 lectual means rather than brute force.
 From the contacts I have had with various British intelli-
 gence officers, visits to JIB (Joint Intelligence Bureau) and
 some of the intelligence officers of the Air ministry, and from
 comparing the results of British intelligence with those of USAF
 Intelligence, I am certainly inclined to agree, at least partially,
 with Seth's last statement for the quality of British intelligence
 production is invariably very high, and the quantity compares
 favorably with that produced by the much larger USAF intelli-
 pence staffs.  The British traditionally have been willing to

 spend a great amount of money, time, and effort in the collec-
 tion of intelligence information, more, perhaps, than most
 modern nations.  They have not, in other words, weighed re-
 slts obtained by intell igence efforts on a completely pragmatic
 basis, as we "practical Americans" are inclined to do; they know
 that one cannot package intelligence results on a "pound-for-
 pound" basis.  So for the past two hundred years they have
 been preeminent in the field.  This is not to say that they have
 not made serious mistakes; but, by and large, their intelligence
 estimates have been remarkably sound.  Moreover, they have
 used periods of nominal peace to extend and consolidate their
 intelligence activities, not only for the purpose of preparing
 for the next war but also (what is even more important) pre-
 paring for the peace to follow.
 FREEDOM OF ACTION.  As background for a discussion of
 the need for granting maximum freedom of action to air force
 intelligence, I should like to quote the following passage from,
 the Report of the Task Force on Intelligence Activities:
 Effect of Diplomacy on the Over-All Collection of In-
 telligence.
 The task force has recognized the incompatibility in
 method between the practice of diplomacy and the
 more direct and active operations incident to the col-
 lection of intelligence and the conduct of cold war.
 While all contribute to the end in view, conflicts be-
 tween them must be resolved, usually on a high level,
 and always in the national interest.  It must be real-
 ized that diplomacy is not an end in itself; that while
 political ends must be served and unjustifiable risks
 avoided, the collection of intelligence is a vital element
 in the fight to preserve our national welfare and ex-
 istence.  Instances have come to the attention of the
 task force where too conservative an attitude has pre-
 vailed, often to the detriment of vigorous and timely
 action in the field.
 Although the foregoing comment was made in connecti
 with a discussion of the intelligence activities of the Dep
 ? Intelligence Activities, A Report to the Congress, by the Commissl
 1955, pp. 42-43.  (Hereafter referred to as "Task Force Report."),
 CONFIDENTIAL                  37
 ment of State, it is every bit as applicable to air intelligence as
 to the Department of State because the air attache system,
 which is a major contributor of intelligence information, func-
 tions as an integral part of the State Department's Forefgn
 Service.
 It is altogether appropriate that, generally speaking, diplo-
 matic considerations take precedence over the collection re-
 quirements of the attaches.  Nevertheless, within the frame-
 work of that principle (which is a part of the principle of civil-
 ian control over the military establishment), it should be ob-
 vious from the implications of the Task Force findings that a
 less conservative attitude toward opportunities for collection
 of intelligence information should permeate not only the diplo-
 matic service but also the military establishment.
 I shall not devote much attention to detailed suggestions for
 carrying out intelligence operations.  My concern is with the
 promotion of principles that would provide the type of climate
 in which competent people, using their innate intelligence and
 ingenuity, can devise an infinite number of ways in which to
 collect and produce air intelligence - ways which must, of
 course, be within the framework of US national objectives at
 all times.  Nevertheless, I feel very strongly that we should
 take a page out of the British Secret Service book and put our
 intelligence collection efforts on a basis where they can pay
 their own way, at least in part.  This would be a long-term
 proposition and it would be impossible of achievement under
 the existing regimentation that governs all business enter-
 prises in which the government is officially engaged.
 COEQUAL STATUS WITH OTHER MAJOR STAFF ELE-
 MENTS.  There is, as far as I can discern, no rhyme nor reason
 in subordinating intelligence as a staff section to operations.
 My biggest objection to the subordination of intelligence to op-
 erations lies in the fact that the operations officer is automati-
 cully placed in the position where he frequently makes purely
 command decisions.  The intelligence officer is supposed to
 itdvise the commanding officer as to what the enemy can and
 probably will attempt to do that would interfere with the ac-
 complishment of the command mission.  The operations officer

 capabilities and to make a sound command decision as to
 command action.  It is totally wrong for the operations officer
 to make such a decision, for the commanding officer is thereby
 deprived of the full value (and probably full information) of
 enemy capabilities, vulnerabilities, and intentions.  Zacharias,
 commenting on the fallacy of subordinating, told the Con-
 gressional Committee investigating the Pearl Harbor disaster
 that one of the organizational deficiencies which was a con-
 tributing factor was: S
 That the planning officers were allowed to take over
 the Intelligence function of evaluation.  This resulted
 in individuals without a full knowledge of the Japanese
 or their psychology determining what the Japanese
 might do.  This practice applied not only in Washing-
 ton, but also at Pearl Harbor, where the erroneous con-
 clusion was reached by the planning officer that there
 was no chance of an air attack on Pearl Harbor.
 CONCEPT NUMBER TWO.  Success achieved by intelligence
 in peace will determine the outcome of the war.
 General Kuter stated: 9
 In jet-atomic warfare there will be no room for gross
 errors of judgment. There will be no time, should hos-
 tilities start, to correct mistakes in the types of forces
 that we have provided, the manner in which they have
 been organized and trained, or the way we fight.  And
 the terrible penalty for failure could be quick and com-
 plete defeat.
 Many factors are involved in any satisfactory an-
 swer. But one thing is sure. The question cannot be
 answered satisfactorily unless we have the proper doc-
 trine, and unless the doctrine is accepted.
 For years the US has believed that its greatest military p
 tential lay in its industrial might.  The validity of this bell'

 was demonstrated in World Wars I and II and again in Kor

 will the US or any other country be able to build up its mili-
 tary forces and rely on its industrial potential after the war
 has begun." 1?
 Intelligence must be developed before war breaks out if it is
 to influence our preparations, provide a foundation for our
 planning, and guide early phases of operations. It is true that
 Mr. Allen Dulles, present Director of the CIA,11 achieved un-
 precedented success in the history of espionage with the intelli-
 gence network he established in Germany, operating from
 Switzerland, during the war.
 ... Through this network Mr. Dulles managed to
 start a conspiracy within the high command of the
 German armies in the south and to bring about the
 surrender of the very army on which Hitler was de-
 pendent for the prolonging of the war from behind the
 legendary "Alpine redoubt."
 However, the situation in Japan was a far different matter.
 Through shortsightedness and perhaps ineptitude and inex-
 perience, the US had failed to establish the groundwork for an
 effective espionage system in Japan, notwithstanding the fact
 that Zacharias and other authorities on Japan had been aware
 of the need and had advocated such prior planning.  In view
 of the steadily deteriorating relations that existed between
 Japan and the US right up to the surprise attack against Pearl
 Harbor, this failure to develop, in advance of war, a workable
 system for systematic collection (in Japan) of intelligence in-
 formation during the war that most intelligence personnel
 were sure was virtually inevitable is an extremely black mark
 against the US intelligence agencies of that time.  Moreover,
 this country made no serious effort to establish an intelligence
 net within Japan during the war because it was felt that the
 effort was far too great in relation to its possible value. Farago
 pointed out that it is a virtual impossibility ". . . to set up a
 local network in an enemy country under wartime condi-
 lions...." 12    [Allen Dulles' success notwithstanding]

 How can we account for the fact that, against all reasonable
 odds, the US did establish a satisfactory espionage net in Ger-
 many after war started but failed to do so in Japan, its other
 major enemy? I suggest that the reason lies, among other
 factors, in the accessibility of Germany before the outbreak
 of war.  In other words, more Americans and individuals from
 Allied nations had contacts before the war in Germany than in
 Japan.  Interestingly enough, the Soviets failed to re-establish
 within Germany an adequate espionage net:
 ... when their original network, known as the
 Rote Kapelle or Red Orchestra, was smashed.  They
 managed to create such networks only in countries of
 their wartime allies, Canada, the United Kingdom,
 and the United States, and in neutral Switzerland, tra-
 ditional battleground of international espionage.13
 The Soviets did achieve remarkable success in Japan (remem-
 ber the Sorge espionage case?) 14 It seems to me that there is a
 direct correlation between the accessibility of a potential enemy,
 country just before the outbreak of hostilities and the proba-
 bility of being able to establish (or re-establish) and maintain;
 an espionage net in that country after war breaks out.  What
 does this mean, as far as the US is concerned at the present
 time?  If it is difficult to penetrate the iron Curtain today,
 it will be even harder when war breaks out.  Therefore, w
 must go all-out to penetrate it, and to establish many strong
 '
 diversified, and versatile nets as soon as possible.  We canno
 do this under the existing limitations of personnel, equipment,
 and funds.  Yet maximum reliance must be placed on the
 ability of intelligence to decide by whom, when, where, and
 what strength the US may be attacked.  The responsibility o
 the Directorate of Intelligence (ACS/I, since 1 July 1957).;
 USAF, is to develop this information regarding our suscepti
 bility to air attack - this in an air-nuclear age.
 CONCEPT NUMBER THREE.  Air intelligence must, on a con
 tinging basis, encompass all aspects of power in foreign na
 tions (political, economic, and psychosocial, as well as mini
 -
 tary), both in the present and in the historical perspectit
 Moreover, it must speak out on matters of national strategy.
 's Ibid., p. 182.
 " Ibid., pp. 163, 166, 179, 181, 212, 219-220.
 Heretofore, air intelligence (as well as army and navy in-
 telligence) has confined itself primarily to an evaluation of the
 military power of foreign nations.  The National Security
 Council has directed the air force to interest itself primarily in
 intelligence of foreign air forces and has assigned responsi-
 bility for covering other aspects of national power to the other
 US intelligence agencies.
 It has long been an American tradition that the military
 establishment should remain free from the "taint of politics."
 As a result, the military has shied away from any contact with
 political problems.  This even reached the point before World
 War II where few of the regular military establishment exer-
 cised their constitutional right to vote in elections.
 This fear of military domination in our national life stems,
 of course, from our inherited distrust of all forms of tyranny
 and autocracy.  Before the time that military power became
 inextricably tied to the other forms of national power, perhaps
 even as late as the First World War, this attitude may have had
 some validity in our national consciousness.  However, Clause-
 witz would not have subscribed to the complete separation of
 military thinking from the remainder of national life and activ-
 ities.  He pointed out that war is merely an extension of na-
 tional, political policy by other means.15 Hitler demonstrated
 his conviction that war is merely a "mopping-up process" by
 capitalizing on the gains made by his fifth column.  Certainly
 the Marxists have from the beginning showed the world by
 word and deed that the line of demarcation between politics
 and military action is extremely nebulous.
 It can and probably will be argued that air intelligence
 should "stick to its knitting" and concentrate on ascertaining
 the strengths and weaknesses of foreign air forces in the tradi-
 tional fashion (in which the army is supposed to develop intel-
 ligence on foreign ground forces; the navy, on foreign naval
 forces: the air force, on foreign air forces; and the State Depart-
 ment and CIA, on foreign political and economic strengths and
 weaknesses).  However, as it is air power that will have to
 carry the brunt of any initial contacts with the enemy, as well
 a~ continuously to seek out and destroy all aspects of the enemy

 have the capability of advising the Chief of Staff, USAF, where
 and when to hit the enemy in order to hurt him most.
 It seems incontrovertible to me that we have reached a place
 in history where the military establishment, particularly the
 air force, must concern itself with political problems (as well
 as the economic and psychosocial problems) - the traditional
 American feeling in the matter notwithstanding.  General

 in packaging the ideas we want to use in our "War of Wits"
 with the Soviets, this struggle for the minds of men.
 CONCEPT NUMBER FIVE.  Intelligence should be used as an
 offensive weapon, one capable of influencing the outcome o
 either the cold war or any hot war, peripheral as well as total.
 Although there are no apparent indications that the Soviet
 Union, during the next few years, intends to take action of the
 sort that would surely precipitate another world conflict, we
 must be always on the alert to the possibility that such a con-
 flict might arise through miscalculation on their part.  The
 dangers are greatest in the peripheral areas, where Satellite
 peoples might get out of hand and take action "from which we
 cannot retreat without disaster; then the chances of keeping
 war limited are very remote." 18
 The difficulty is not in the lack of desire to exercise such
 restraint, but in the fact that the things we stand to lose are
 of such great value that there is no chance of limiting phases,
 of conflict.  To have mutual understanding and agreement be-
 tween enemies is essential if conflict is to be localized.  What
 does this mean to air intelligence?  Simply this: we must pro-.
 duce intelligence on every facet of enemy life.  To do this, air,,
 intelligence should control or at least coordinate all air force
 agencies that to any degree operate in enemy territory or attack
 behind enemy lines or perform other than strictly military,
 operations in areas that may become the scene of battle or
 areas where, in the cold war, the air forces encounter Com
 munist influences.
 CONCEPT NUMBER SIX.  Intelligence must be used syst
 atically.  Commanders, policymakers, planners, and opera.
 tions personnel at all echelons must rely upon, then plan, th
 act not only upon intelligence but also upon intelligence reconi,
 mendations - within practical limits of our own capability an
 feasibility of such recommendations.  We have long express
 as a principle of intelligence the concept that it must
 supplied to the interested command in time to be of
 Unfortunately, in intelligence circles there has not been,
 seems to me, equal emphasis placed upon submission of inte
 gence to the commander and his staff in such a form and,
 convincingly expressed that it will receive the prompt attentii
 CONFIDENTIAL                  45
 and responsive command action that it warrants. Stressing
 the need for reducing the margin of error inherent in any
 human undertaking, General White pointed out the need for
 educating our planners and our leaders.  He said that poor
 command decisions and inferior or unimaginative staff work
 would nullify the tremendous effort that has gone into develop-
 ing an extremely expensive air force.  He added:
 ... Superior employment of air weapons must be
 based on complete understanding of the nature of air
 warfare, the political and military context within
 which the air forces are operating, and a sound but
 imaginative understanding of targets and weapons.19
 There also has been entirely too little emphasis on the con-
 cept that command plans and action should be based on in-
 telligence.  This has not always been the fault of intelligence.
 Nevertheless, too often in the air force, particularly, operational
 plans have been prepared with absolutely no regard for the
 intelligence estimate of enemy capabilities and intentions that
 these selfsame plans were designed to counter.  In my experi-
 ence as a staff officer at various echelons of command, there
 have been few instances in which command war plans, emer-
 gency plans, or operations plans have actually been geared to
 the intelligence that gave rise to the necessity for such plans.
 More often than not, the intelligence annex is merely prepared
 at the same time as the basic plan and the other annexes and
 all are stapled together at one time.  The proper procedure,
 and the one that we in intelligence at USAFE (US Air Forces
 In Europe) were finally able to sell to the planners, should be
 this.  The intelligence estimate of the situation is prepared
 first, and given to the commander and to all his staff agencies
 in advance of the planning cycle.  The basic plan and all the
 annexes (including the intelligence annex) are then prepared
 simultaneously, with a view to countering the threat indicated
 In the intelligence estimate.
 I believe this failure to take the intelligence estimate into
 conhlderation at every stage in the planning cycle in the mili-
 tary establishment stems by and large from an American pre-

 dilection for ignoring in the policymaking cycle available in-
 telligence regarding the capabilities and intentions of actual or
 potential enemies.
 It seems to me that the intelligence family must find some
 way not only to improve the quality of its product but also to
 stimulate an acceptance of that product and a willingness to
 act upon it.  The process of making positive recommendations
 by intelligence for command action would, I believe, materially
 improve this situation and would lead to a command acceptance
 of a principle advanced by General Ridgway, when he was Chief
 of Staff of the US Army. He stressed the fact that the present
 world situation makes it more important than ever to have com-
 plete information upon which to base economical deployment
 and effective employment of army forces, as well as to avoid sur-
 prise (obviously the same principle applies to all military
 forces). General Ridgway stated: "Adequate intelligence con-
 stitutes the fundamental basis for the calculation of risks, the
 formulation of plans, the development of materiel, the alloca-
 tions of resources, and the conduct of operation." 20
 CONCEPT NUMBER SEVEN.  Intelligence must eontinuousl,
 estimate enemy intentions as well as capabilities and vulnera",,
 bilities.  One of the biggest reasons that commanders at times
 have made their own estimates, rather than accept those o
 their intelligence officers, is simply that the intelligence office
 have been unwilling to "go out on a limb" and estimate enem
 intentions.  Before the early 1930's the "method of intentions'
 was used by the US Army.  It was a method used by the eld
 von Moltke.  Shortly before 1936 the American Army adop
 the "method of capabilities," which had been the method us
 by Napoleon.21
 Admittedly the "method of intentions" is a difficult one an
 for the inexperienced intelligence officer, nonhabit forming:
 cause the probability of error is extremely high.  Success f'
 this method depends not only on an intimate knowledge of th
 14
 mentality of the opposing commanders as well as the tactii
 doctrine of the enemy but also upon such intangible things;
 the physical and mental condition of the opponent, his no
 reactions, and reasoning processes.  On the other hand

 "method of capabilities" takes into consideration all lines of
 action open to the enemy. It does not discard any possible line
 until the enemy's dispositions are such that, even though he
 desired to adopt that line, he is physically incapable of doing
 so.  Thus it strives by elimination to reduce the possibility
 down to one - the only one line of action which the enemy can
 take.  This is the ideal, as far as intelligence is concerned, but
 it is seldom reached.
 CONCEPT NUMBER EIGHT.  Intelligence is no longer a func-
 tion of command, except at the higher echelons.  All of the
 services (particularly the air force) have traditionally paid, only
 lip service to the principle that intelligence is a function of
 command.  This has been amply demonstrated by a lack of
 provision for suitable intelligence staffing between World War
 I and World War II and by a demeaning of intelligence func-
 tions.  My reasons for believing that intelligence should no
 longer be considered a function of command at all echelons are
 different from either of these.
 In the first place if an all-out global war should occur, the
 US intelligence operations should be centrally controlled.  Sec-
 ond, the entire intelligence process cannot reasonably be car-
 ried out at all echelons; therefore, even in a prolonged period
 of cold war, air intelligence operations must be, if not actually
 centrally controlled from Washington, at least concentrated in
 a small number of locations where the complete intelligence
 process is directed by one individual.  Unquestionably, in the
 past, commanders of squadrons, groups, wings, even air divi-
 s4ons and air forces occasionally may have felt a twinge of
 conscience because they have been unable to see their way clear
 to carry out all the intelligence functions that manuals said
 they should, from collection through dissemination.  These
 Individuals may now draw a sigh of relief, as I view it; for in
 the air force, their primary intelligence function is to dissemi-
 nate down to the troops air intelligence that has been received
 from higher echelons.
 It may be argued that I am hereby cutting the rug out from
 under the principle I previously expressed - that the intelli-
 p ncr officer should not be subordinated to other staff officers
 but should report directly to the commanding officer.  On the
 c mtrary. in these lower units, and even when his recognized

 duties are in accord with his actual duties, I still feel that the
 intelligence officer at every echelon of command should remain
 responsible only to the commanding officer or the chief of staff,
 and not to any other staff officer! He must maintain this inde-
 pendence of other staff considerations in order best to present
 to his commander the most complete intelligence picture and
 the most reasonable intelligence recommendations, even though
 he himself may not have developed either the intelligence esti-
 mate of the situation or the recommendations based on it.
 At the major air force command levels there is no question
 in regard to major staff level standing for the intelligence
 officer as intelligence should continue to be for his commander
 a complete function of command, in the traditional sense.  At
 the lower echelons, intelligence would still be a command re-
 sponsibility, but rather more in the "special staff" tradition
 than the "general staff" concept.
 CONCEPT NUMBER NINE.  Major headquarters staffs should
 get out of the operational aspects of intelligence to the maxi-
 mum extent possible and should confine their attention largely
 to policymaking and flash or spot estimating functions.  This
 concept is closely related to some of the thinking indicated in
 the discussion of the preceding concept.  Compared with the,
 present tables of distribution, the intelligence staff of Head
 relatively small.  These staffs, however, would be comprised of
 highly qualified personnel, representing the maximum Intel
 primarily policymaking, inspection, liaison, and estimating
 of the imminence of hostilities and spot estimates, as requir
 by the commander and his staff.  They would exercise st
 supervision not only over the intelligence activities of all su
 ordinate units of the command, but also over the collection an
 production activities of the intelligence centers belonging
 the command; these centers would perform the operation
 aspects of the intelligence process for the entire command.
 CONCEPT NUMBER TEN.  Air Intelligence (to include cou
 '
 terintelligence) must keep under continuous review and,
 the maximum extent possible, must downgrade and publish
 flies concerning enemy capabilities, activities, and intentions;'
 What I am proposing is nothing less than declassifying cer-
 tain carefully selected items of intelligence and counterintelli-
 gence regarding Soviet activities and providing such informa-
 tion to the American public on a planned basis.  Let the Amer-
 ican people get this information, but from authoritative sources
 and not from newspaper columnists.
 Probably the most violent opposition to this proposal will
 come from some of my fellow intelligence officers, because tradi-
 tionally, intelligence has had a moral responsibility to protect
 its sources, and rightly so.  Nevertheless, intelligence files are
 bulging with information that represents such a conglomera-
 tion from so many sources that no one source could possibly be
 harmed by its disclosure. Let us substitute this type of infor-
 mation for at least some of the detailed data on our own mili-
 tary establishment that we now hand out so freely. I am confi-
 dent that the public reaction to this policy would, in general, be
 very favorable, and that in the long run, the story of air power
 and the capabilities of the air force to safeguard the security
 interests of the US can be made synonymous in the minds of
 the American people.
 So let's stop giving aid and comfort to our potential enemies
 and start a program designed to discomfort them on a global
 talc - by informing and arousing the American public and
 the rest of the free world with factual knowledge of Soviet ac-
 tivities and intentions.  For example, an article in the Sep-
 t,-tuber 1955 Reader's Digest discussed the disturbing story of
 the manner in which the Communists, who had infiltrated the
 military services and governmental structure of Iran, were pre-
 rnted from taking over the entire country by the merest ac-
 cident.  As a result of the investigation, it was disclosed that
 five hundred Iranian officers were implicated in the plot, in-
 cluding numerous high-ranking individuals in both the Army
 and the police departments.22
 This story, terrifying in its implication for other countries,
 would. I submit, have had a much stronger impact on public
 awareness of the Communist threat to the world today had it
 bat-tt omcially released by a government intelligence agency,
 rather than by a commercial writer.  This is the type of run-

 DEVELOPMENTS IN AIR TARGETING
 1. THE MILITARY RESOURCES MODEL
 The basic objective for air targeting is to present measure-
 ments of the ability of the enemy to take actions which
 threaten our national security.  These measurements must be
 presented in such a way as to guide our action against the
 enemy's strengths.  This objective is usually broken down into
 subobjectives which illustrate clearly its breadth and com-
 plexity.  Expressed in terms of courses of enemy action which
 are unacceptable to the US, these subobjectives are, in descend-
 ing order of importance:
 1. To deliver atomic weapons against the US, our forces
 abroad, and our allies.
 2. To resist the penetration of his airspace by our air forces.
 3. To develop and produce potentially decisive weapons or
 weapons systems.
 4. To conduct large-scale land and naval operations against
 our forces and our allies.
 5. To develop and maintain the economic, political, and psy-
 chological strengths necessary to support prolonged military
 operations.
 With the development of new weapons and weapons systems,
 however, and the resultant capability of a single aircraft or
 missile to deliver the equivalent of millions of tons of TNT on
 one mission, the analysis and presentation of the strengths
 supporting the first three subobjectives have assumed ever-
 Increasing importance and urgency.  This compression of fire-
 power in time brings the realization that the decision in future
 wars may be reached in a matter of hours or days at most.
 Old problems have been accentuated and many new ones cre-
 ated by these developments.  For example, selection of target
 rytems to achieve the subobjectives time-phased in the order
 drown above is no longer sufficient. Analysis must produce
 rat only a priority of targets within each subobjective and
 target system, but also an indication of how many of them

 must be attacked to achieve the objective.  Thus analysis by
 increments in time and space is becoming an essential element
 in the targeting process.
 The complexity of these problems and the speed with which
 they must be solved have led to the introduction of new statis-
 tical methods and of new machine computing techniques into
 the targeting analysis process.  For example, immediate
 assessment of the damage and contamination effect of a given
 attack will be necessary in order to determine the destruction
 required of succeeding attacks.  This involves a continuing
 evaluation of target priorities and of net offensive strengths
 throughout an air offensive until a decision is reached.  Two-
 sided war-gaming offers the best possibility for providing the
 answers needed for this and similar problems.  Because of the
 time element and the great volume of data required by the new,
 statistical techniques, high-speed electronic computing is
 By this process hypothetical but highly probable

 .
 military situations in both peace and war can be examined and
 by the analyst to guide and evaluate target selections.  Only
 in this way can the total targeting effort truly be said to pr
 sent measurements of the enemy's strengths in such a way
 to facilitate action against them.
 During the last several years it has become increasing
 apparent that mathematical "Monte Carlo" and "input-ou
 put" type models offer a new and promising technique for "war'..

 m-a    __
 resources for targeting purposes.  The rapid advances in th
 speed and data handling capacity of modern electronic con%
 i
 on
 puters have now made these models feasible for applicat
 many air targets problems.
 The purpose of the mathematical models is the selection
 targets for optimum forestalling of enemy courses of actin
 s
 This requires the models to answer the following question
 order.
 1. Present situation
 a. What is the size and composition of the enemy
 tart' establishment (military resources)?
 b. What is the size, composition, and productive abili:
 of the enemy economy (economic resources) ?
 c. What levels of military action will these resources sup-
 port?
 2. Mobilization capability
 a. What would be the size and composition of enemy
 military resources and economic resources after an all-out
 mobilization period of x months?
 b. What levels of military action would these resources
 support?
 3. Evaluation of damage
 a. For any specified bombing attack what would be the
 yield and location of all exploding weapons?
 b. Given these explosions what would be the size and com-
 position of the post attack military and economic resources
 (including population)?
 c. Given the post attack resources what level of enemy
 military action could be maintained?
 4. Recuperation
 What would be the size and composition of enemy mili-
 tary and economic resources y months (or days) after the
 specified attack, taking into account repair, rebuilding, con-
 version of other facilities, and new construction?
 For "war-gaming," that is, estimating net offensive capabili-
 tIes, the above questions must be asked about our own country
 as well as about the enemy country.
 The system of mathematical models which would answer
 these questions is shown schematically in Figure 1.
 The air battle, the damage, and the contamination models
 would answer questions 3a and b above.  Discussions of these
 models are planned in subsequent issues.
 The remaining questions concerning the present, post mobi-
 lization, post attack, and post recuperation capabilities of the
 military and the economy are the province of the military re-
 aources model, which includes economic resources.
 Procedurally, the military resources models determine the
 number and size of missions, both offensive and defensive of
 "Anus types, which each country can carry out in a given span
 Cd time.  This information is fed to the air battle model which

 mines the military, economic, and population resources re-
 maining in each country after a period of air battle.  The dam-
 age information is in turn fed back to the military resources
 model which determines the number, type, and size of missions
 which each country can carry out after the first phase of air
 battle.  The process is then repeated for later phases of the air
 battle.
 If the models can, as is believed possible, answer the ques-
 tions posed we have an exceedingly powerful tool not only for
 target selection, but also for estimating the capability of a
 country to carry out military action now and in the future
 under various conditions and assumptions.  The testing of
 alternative target systems in the first and succeeding phases
 can lead to the choice of the optimum target system for any
 of several different strategic situations.
 When then, is the military resources model and how is it de-
 signed to answer the questions put to it?
 The military resources model is an input-output model. This
 is a kind of mathematical model about which it has been said,
 it is much easier to understand what it is expected to do than
 how it does it.  What the military resources model is expected
 to do is to estimate the capabilities of a military establishment
 and its supporting economy to carry out military action.  The
 r sential problem of making this estimate is that everything
 must be considered simultaneously.
 It Is not enough to know that the capacity of the aeroengine
 Industry is so many engines per month.  One must also know
 whether there is enough steel (or electric power, copper, petro-
 1runt, ball bearings, and so on) to produce these engines while
 at the same time the tank, gun, shipbuilding, ammunition, and
 many other key industries (including reconstruction in a post
 attack period) are also requiring steel.  Furthermore, not only
 ihr direct demand for steel must be considered.  The aero-
 Inc industry consumes not only steel but also aluminum,
 ciactrlc power, transportation, and many other inputs, the pro-
 duction of which also requires some steel.  In short, to know
 ttw capabilities of one industry we must account for require-
 tflcnta of all industries for a vast range of raw materials, labor,
 akppttal equipment, components, goods in process, transporta-
 Ucm and communications.  Input-output models are a tech-
 for doing just this.     An input-output model shows for

 The military resources model consists of three sub-models or

 Without knowing the full complexity of the statistical and
 computational procedures (which is awe-inspiring) the reader
 can now visualize the operation of these grids in answering our
 initial questions.  The military grid shows for a given set of
 military forces the level of combat actions that could be main-
 tained if the economy provides all the supplies the military re-
 quires.  The coefficients of the military grid determine the re-
 quirements of the given level of combat actions from the econ-
 omy.  The economic and transportation grids determine how
 much of these supplies can be forthcoming from the existing
 inventory of economic resources.
 At the present time the economic grid of the Soviet Bloc has
 been largely completed.  It has been constructed in two
 parts - one covering the USSR and European Satellites and
 the other the Peoples Republic of China.  For the European
 1i1oc the grid distinguishes 240 producing industries or sectors
 and their materials, components, capital equipment, and labor
 inputs.  Five test runs have been made and evaluated.2  On
 the basis of the evaluation of these test runs, application of
 this grid to certain types of live air targets problems is now be-
 in:; undertaken.  However, a substantial data improvement
 rrsearch program is going concurrently.
 `i'hc military grid has been under development for about nine
 months.  It is expected that test runs of this grid will be made
 in the summer of 1958.
 The transportation grid has been under development for
 about six months, and it is expected that test runs of this grid
 rill be made in the summer of 1958.  The construction of this
 grid is being undertaken on two fronts.  The first involves the
 Er);raphic disaggregation of the economic grids in terms of
 kcal regions.  The second consists of the development of a
 transportation grid based on these regions.  To date, 159 re-
 gk3n.+ covering the USSR have been designated, outlined, and
 cod-vd. The transportation net has been divided according to
 ttwwr regions and the terminals and links within each region
 cndrd and catalogued.  The 159 regions correspond to Soviet
 C& Uts wherever possible in order to take advantage of the data

 bases from which to operate, and so on, in specific quantities.
 If a ton of steel is needed the government must see that steel
 mill capacity, pig iron, scrap, coal, labor, and so on, are avail-
 able in the correct amounts.  If more steel capacity is needed
 it must provide the steel, concrete, machinery, and so on, in
 the right quantities and types to construct a new steel mill.
 These resource restraints and technological relationships are
 set out comprehensively and in detail by the military resources
 model.  The ability of the economy to support the mobiliza-
 tion of desired combinations or "mixes" of air, land, and sea
 forces can be measured.  A typical problem would be a deter-
 mination of the maximum "balanced" air, land, and sea forces
 which could be activated in a specified mobilization period with
 specified stockpiling and capital expansion policies.  In addi-
 tion to measuring the maximum activation of combat units,
 the economic grid can be used to determine under a variety of
 illoc policies and objectives the maximum capability to pro-
 duce specific weapons such as guided missiles and H-bombs at
 specified times.
 However, the economic-industrial grid does not take into
 account any restraints or bottlenecks that might develop
 within the military structure itself.  Therefore, the outputs of
 the economic grid are fed into the military grid as inputs. The
 military grid is then used to assess the capability of the Soviet
 illoc military structure to mount and sustain, during a pre-
 attack period, elements of military strength fully prepared to
 rnkage in combat activities required by given strategies.  The
 ability of the military structure to support desired combina-
 tians or "mixes" of air, land, and sea combat activities can be
 measured under varying Bloc mobilization objectives, policies,
 and assumptions.  In addition to measuring the maximum
 r*mbat capabilities that can be sustained, the military model
 can be used to determine the capability of the military struc-
 14at to put into operation specific weapons, such as guided
 4*411es. within the available military resources, that is, trained
 patratnel, missile sites, logistics, and repair facilities.
 Tic transportation grid would then be used to establish any
 lttnaportation restraints or bottlenecks which might develop
 the economy or military structure itself.

 4. Feasibility Testing
 The necessity for balancing the internal flows within the
 matrix of an input-output model make this type of model par-
 ticularly suitable for testing the internal consistency of either
 announced Soviet Bloc plans or of US intelligence estimates of
 Soviet Bloc military or economic growth patterns.  For exam-
 ple, the internal consistency of either Soviet Bloc plans to
 mount military strength or US intelligence estimates of Soviet
 Bloc military growth plans can be tested.    Estimates inde-
 pendently projected for various types of air combat strength
 can be tested one against the other in order to determine
 whether or not the total projected strength estimate is internal-
 ly consistent and whether or not such total strength can be sup-
 ported by the Soviet Bloc military structure.  The economic
 grid can be used to check production estimates independently
 arrived at for various military end products to determine
 whether or not the production pattern so established is eco-
 nomically feasible.  The transportation grid should be of great
 help in checking estimates of Soviet Bloc transportation pat-
 terns and capability.
 5. Mobilization Indicators
 The military resources model can be used to establish indi-
 cators of mobilization build-up.  By testing the model under
 various assumed mobilization conditions certain economic
 changes as well as changes within the military structure can be
 Identified as indicators of partial or complete mobilization.
 Specific changes in the use of resources can be identified as in-
 dicating specific types of mobilization.
 6. Intelligence Collection Indicators
 In using the military resources model to solve a series of
 simulated air targets problems, certain areas of economic and
 military activity will be shown to be of critical significance to
 Ut capability of the Soviet Bloc to mount and maintain mili-
 tary strength.  These critical sectors are those on which it is
 mwt Important to obtain accurate, current data for targeting
 purposes.  Thus the priority list of air targets intelligence re-
 gWroments can be sharpened, and emphasis can be placed on
 U  collection of certain key military and economic data.
 7. Inputs for Operational Models

 over-all military strategy into requirements upon the

 Approved For Release 2005/03/15 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000100020001-2
 economic-industrial, transportation, and military structure for
 the creation of military formations and military resource ele-
 ments together with the necessary military supporting activi-
 ties in both pre- and post-attack situations.  Operational
 models such as the air battle model, currently being tested,
 serve to indicate these requirements in a realistic manner.
 The military resources model is designed to provide appropriate
 inputs for these operational models in the form of units of comp`,
 bat capability and to reflect the output of operational models
 in changing requirements upon the military structure.  Thus
 the military resources model can define the maximum levels of
 combat activity possible within the limitations of the Bloc mill),
 tary and economic structure at any specified time.
 8. Data Requirements
 The validity of problem solutions provided by the mili
 resources model is dependent upon the accuracy of the data
 inputs as well as the logic of the mathematical design of th
 model.  Each of the component parts of the model - the ee
 nomic grid, the military grid, and the transportation grid
 has its own data requirements which must be initially asseinn
 bled and subsequently kept up to date.
 The economic grid contains a classification of economic ac
 tivity in the Soviet Bloc in the form of three submatrices o
 grids; the commodity input grid, the capital input grid, an
 the capital expansion grid.  The data requirements of the co
 modity input grid or matrix consist of the commodity inpu
 per unit of production for each of the 240 sectors of the mat
 These sectors cover most of the commodities produced in
 Bloc.  The data requirements of the capital input matrix c
 sist of the inputs of capital equipment and labor per unit
 production of each of these same commodities.  The data l
 u
 quired by the capital expansion matrix consist of the co,
 modity and capital inputs necessary to increase available ca
 ital by one unit:  The data described above are in the form
 technological coefficients which reflect the technological r,
 tionships currently operating as the economic restraints in
 desired mobilization or recuperation. by the Soviet Bloc.
 order to reflect fully the flexibility of the Soviet Bloc econ
 in meeting mobilization or wartime requirements the data
 puts must reflect not only production processes currentl;
 use but also the alternative processes which could be us
 SECRET                     63
 break bottlenecks, or stoppages resulting from air attack. Thus
 the economic grid requires the introduction of all practical
 alternate input coefficients in order to establish realistic tech-
 nological restraints. Because production technology changes
 with the passage of time, these coefficients must be continually
 scrutinized to insure that they reflect current technology.  In
 addition, changes are necessitated in the classification of com-
 modities and capital equipment in the light of experience
 gained in using the model for various types of problems. Those
 economic sectors which prove to be the most sensitive to mobi-
 lization or recuperation demands may require a more detailed
 or disaggregated classification in the model, whereas less vital
 sectors may be further aggregated.  .
 The running of a simulation on the economic model requires,
 in addition to the technological coefficients, data on the eco-
 nomic resources available to the Soviet Bloc for the time period
 being considered.  Thus for each of the 240 commodity groups
 in the grid, current data on Bloc capacity, inventory, and for-
 eign trade must be assembled.
 The data requirements of the military grid of the model
 parallel those of the economic grid, but pertain to military
 activities rather than economic activities.  As previously men-
 tioned, the output of the military grid, equivalent to commodity
 outputs in the economic grid, is in units of frontline activity,
 for example, flying hours of a specific type of bomber.  For
 each such military activity data on inputs of other military
 activities as well as inputs of industrial commodities must be
 determined.  In addition, for each unit of military activity the
 requirements of military capital aggregated in the form of
 "resource elements" such as airstrips, naval bases, and repair
 facilities must be determined together with the inputs neces-
 sary to expand a military "resource element" by one unit.  As
 in the case of the economic grid, input data for alternative
 Processes of producing a unit of military activity must be
 Wembled and all coefficients in the grid must be kept in accord
 11th the most modern logistical processes used by the Soviet
 We.  In the running of simulations on the military grid, data
 pf total Soviet Bloc capacity, inventories, and possible incre-
 t   to from foreign trade for each of the military activities in
 t11t+ grid Should be available for the time period under consid-
 tton.

 The introduction of transportation factors into. the military-
 resources model requires an analysis of the Soviet Bloc eco-
 nomic and military commodity flow structure in terms of geo-
 graphic regions, thus greatly increasing the data needs.  For
 each region the types and amounts of transportation facilities
 available must be determined in order to establish the freight-
 handling capabilities of each region. For example, the analysig
 of the USSR railroad system, currently underway, requires for,
 each terminal, link, and region estimates of the terminal motive.
 power and freight-car handling capacities, rail-link capacities,
 and regional car-day requirements.  In addition to these trans
 portation data requirements, the Soviet Bloc production and
 consumption pattern must be established by geographic region.'
 This task requires the identification of the types and amounts;
 of economic and military capital facilities, or "resource el
 ments," available in each region.  In addition, the Soviet Bloc
 "bill of goods," or final demand for military and civilian goods;
 must be determined by geographic region.  The regional con,
 sumption of goods for military, government, and civilian use as
 well as the regional consumption of construction materials an
 producer durables must be estimated.  Only when all th
 data are introduced into the military resources model can th
 transportation restraints, or "bottlenecks" under specifi
 mobilization and recuperation conditions be identified.
 The data problem is formidable, but considerable progr
 has been made, and new sources of data are being found an
 exploited.  The data requirements for the model-machine tec
 nique do not represent a marked change from the req
 ments of traditional methods of analysis.  However, the rigo
 ous analysis made possible by this technique or method simpp;
 makes existing data deficiencies more apparent.  Moreov

 testing techniques will contribute to a sharpening of the,
 ority list of intelligence collection requirements.
 The headshrinkers' literature is full of remarks about the
 efforts of mankind to avoid thinking.  As a matter of fact, I
 rather imagine that a very small proportion of the brainpower
 of the most creative thinker alive is ever devoted to creative
 thought.  In our society a fairly large proportion of this small
 amount of creative thought is devoted to finding ways to help
 mankind avoid thinking.  Games, alcohol, tranquilizers, TV,
 and business routine can all be used to help an individual fill
 24 hours a day without ever having a creative thought. We like
 cliches because they help us sound confident without thinking.
 This does not mean that the average man is idle.  On the con-
 trary, he is probably a very active and useful citizen.  As a
 matter of fact, idleness is generally abhorred because it leaves
 a vacuum that is an invitation to thought.
 You and I may be exceptions to this general pattern in some
 small degree, but I want the reader to recognize that if this
 taper contains one small original thought, it will be here only
 as a result of tremendous psychic effort spent in overcoming
 my own urge not to think, and that if this thought, in its turn,
 sUmulates any creative thinking in the mind of the reader, it
 'will be only over the opposition of your shrewd and dogged sub-
 conscious which tries so hard to protect you from the rash act
 of thinking.
 having drafted this challenge to the reader's subconscious,
 I now propose that we think about some of the problems of in-
 telligence.  (I almost said "look at some of the problems of in-
 klligence."  This just goes to show you how my subconscious
 &bhors the sound of the word "think.")  To pose the problems
 thrt I would like us to think about, I want first to go back into

 more familiar with the events that I am about to describe than

 the intelligence commu
 point, the intelligence community entered a stage which
 always be with us to some extent.  It is the stage in which
 arguments about fact are caused by the technological gap be-
 tween the informed and the uninformed analyst.  This is a gap
 that training and experience have narrowed considerably and
 which probably can be narrowed even further in the future,
 but it probably will exist to some degree as long as some parts
 of the intelligence community develop new methods and new
 ways of thinking and other parts of the intelligence community
 lag in knowledge and understanding.  It is not necessarily a
 bad phenomenon.  It at least means that somebody is out in
 front and doing some thinking.  It keeps the other fellows on
 their toes.
 As a result of over 10 years of development, the intelligence
 community has now reached a high level of sophistication in
 the application of standard techniques of analysis to intelli-
 gence problems.' Subsidiary methods such as style of writing
 and the manner of presentation are excellent.  The community
 seems to have learned how to produce very good answers to
 intelligence problems without generating an undue amount of
 Internal friction.  All this is cause for considerable pride and
 satisfaction.
 As good as we may be, however, we are obviously not good
 enough.  We have just seen a classic example of one of our
 major outstanding difficulties in the question of US policy to-
 ward the launching of the Soviet earth satellite.  There was no
 failure of intelligence to report the facts relating to the Soviet
 satellite program well in advance of the event, and intelligence
 also pointed out that this event would be of distinct advantage
 to the Soviet Union in the field of political prestige.  Intelli-
 gence had done the job our customers normally expect of us,
 and yet in a real sense, the US was caught napping.      The US
 prepared a plan of what to do after the Soviets had launched
 a Jatellite, but we did not take any action or even decide to take
 any action before the event.  In other words, our planners did
 fwt fully recognize the magnitude of the blow the Soviet
 taunching would give to our prestige.  It would be very easy for
 us to sit back smugly and blame the unfortunate consequences

 fault still lay with the intelligence community?  Could it be
 that we have not yet devised the proper method of presentation
 which would permit us to say "damn it, we mean it!"
 If we are willing to recognize that it is possible for intelli-
 gence to "fail" even when it is shrewdly accurate and timely
 we might find further food for thought in looking at the pro
 lems that we are being shrewdly accurate and timely about:
 They tend to be problems that have a fairly immediate practical
 application. No one could object to our tackling such problems
 When one looks for analysis in depth or in terms of long-te
 trends, however, we find that it is generally lacking in our for
 mal publications.  The bold analysis, the sharp intuition, th
 long step ahead, and the provocative ideas are generally foun
 in informal bull sessions; in "think" pieces that have no tru
 status; in the internal staff memoranda of ONE, OCI, and so on
 and in some of the briefs and background material used by th
 DDI on an ad hoc basis. They are almost never found in thi
 formal papers put forward by the community for the so
 guidance of our planners and policymakers.
 There are strong conservative influences in our present
 tem of producing intelligence which would tend to resist than
 in anything involving method and type of analysis, form
 presentation, and so on.  Might we not be at a point of develo
 ment, however, where we need to make a quantum jump in
 conduct of intelligence? Is there any way in which intellige
 can learn to say better "we mean it," "these are the probl
 that may arise in consequence," "these are the decisions
 must be decided?"  How can we extend our analysis in
 and depth beyond present dimensions and yet carry with us
 conservative elements in the intelligence community?
 There might be changes in organization or in the meth
 of presentation which might improve our impact on the fo
 lation and execution of national policy.  These things sho
 be explored, but no such changes could create, by themsel,
 the change in the intellectual and visceral impact of in
 gence that we must aim for.  The only sure way to con
 national affairs with greater wisdom is for the responsible
 organizational substitute for brains.  Intelligence is an

 tremendous responsibility to apply themselves to new ways of
 thinking which will give us a more brilliant insight into the
 dynamic world and our constantly changing place in it.
 The real area in which we must seek improvement, there-
 fore, is in that related to analysis.  Perhaps we must learn to
 pose a different kind of question to ourselves.  Perhaps we need
 to learn to think on a different time scale.     Perhaps we need
 to develop even more new methods of analysis.  Perhaps we
 need to do some combination of all of these things, and many
 others as well.
 There are probably many different ideas that should be ex-
 amined.  Here is a sample of the kind of thing that we might
 think about.  Might it not useful for us to engage systemati-
 cally in backward analysis from hypothetical cases?  For ex-
 ample, intelligence predicted the launching of the Soviet earth
 satellite and said that it would have unfortunate consequences.
 But let us suppose that several years ago we had posed the fol-
 lowing question: "What would be the impact on the policy
 situation of the US and on its prestige if the Soviet Union were
 to accomplish some technological breakthrough which would
 support a Soviet claim for Soviet supremacy in the field of sci-
 ence and technology?"  If we had had this sort of analysis, it
 might have been possible for us to point out in a much more
 meaningful manner the way in which the Soviet missile pro-
 gram and the development of a Soviet earth satellite might
 place the Soviet Union in the favorable situation envisaged in
 our hypothetical analysis.  We could pose other similar ques-
 ttons such as: "What will be the effect on the world political
 altuatlon when Soviet industrial production equals US indus-
 trial production?"  "What would be the consequences if all
 of the 'third force' groups backed by the US came to power and
 'right wing' parties disappeared?"  "What would the world
 kink like after 20 years of disarmament and `peaceful coex-
 Utance?"' Analysis of these questions might put a vastly dif-
 terent light on intermediate developments leading toward the
 hypothetical situation we have posed for ourselves.
 There is undoubtedly room for improvement in our work, but
 Unfortunately as we get better and better, we have more and

 ELINT
 A SCIENTIFIC INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM.
 Charles A. Kroger, Jr.
 During the initial phases of the Battle of Britain a German
 bomber, relatively safe under cover of darkness, flew over the
 blacked-out landscape heading for London.  At a specific mo-
 ment the bomber dropped its bombs, which accurately hit their
 target, and another successful German Luftwaffe attack was
 history.  Electronic advancements by the Germans made this
 possible. British interception and analysis of this new elec-
 tronic bombing device countered the Germans' success and
 continued to render less effective every subsequent electronic
 advantage the Germans. developed.  In a parallel manner the
 Germans developed a highly effective electronic intelligence
 rdiort directed against the Allied raids originating from Britain.
 This phase of electronic intelligence, utilizing electronic means
 to determine enemy electronic capabilities, began in England
 just before World War II and has been an ever increasing effort
 which today is called ELINT.
 ELINT is a coined word for the process of electronic intercept
 and analysis or electronic intelligence - a process about which
 rrry little has been written.  The intelligence officer, unless he
 Is In the electronics field himself, has had little contact with
 FLINT.  By directive ELINT is defined as: "the collection
 (observation and recording), and the technical processing for
 later intelligence purposes, of information on foreign, non-

 Other than atomic detonation sources."  In simple terms,
 LLINT is the detection and analysis of radiations from foreign

 talus to intelligence.
 Jtut as a flashlight radiates a beam of light observable to the
 human eye, electronic devices emit or radiate nonvisible, non-

 For a specific example of how ELINT works, let us take a
 simplified look at Soviet radar.  Soviet radar devices radiate
 electronic impulses at certain frequencies and in definite beams
 searching the sky for long distances and great altitudes for any
 object that may be present.  When these impulses strike an
 object they bounce off and return to a ground or airborne re-
 ceiver which calculates the length of time between emission
 and reception and the strength of the signal received.  From
 this, the Soviet radar operator can generally tell the size, speed,
 direction, altitude, and other pertinent information about the
 unseen object.  Our Strategic Air Command, with its retalia-
 tory mission, urgently requires every possible bit of information
 on Soviet radars - particularly on their location and capa-
 bility.  This is where ELINT goes to work.  By, intercepting,
 amplifying, recording and analyzing an enemy radar signal or
 pulse, we can learn all about it.  By studying the type of radi-
 ation, its modulation (AM, FM, pulse) its pulse repetition rate,
 pulse duration, pulse shape, its radio frequency (position on
 the electronic spectrum), its antenna pattern characteristics,
 and so on, we can identify the radar, compare it with known
 information, ascertain its range, location, use, and other essen-
 tial information required to evaluate its capability as a radar
 and its susceptibility to countermeasures.
 This same process of ELINT pertains to any and all enemy
 electronic devices including airborne intercept devices used by
 guided missiles, guided missile launchers, fighter aircraft, long-
 range and short-range navigational aids, ground controlled in-
 tercept height finders, anti-aircraft and aircraft fire control
 radar, blind bombing devices, electronic radiations emanating
 from scientific laboratories or production plants, and so on.
 What do these radiated signals sound like?  Frankly they
 sound like noise or radio static during a thunder storm-in
 fact, before the more euphonious term of ELINT was coined, the
 British called it "Noise Listening" and, during World War II,
 had a "Noise Listening Bureau."
 Although ELINT is a very complex field - constantly looking
 beyond present knowledge of electronics to fulfill its role of pro-
 viding timely information on new foreign electronic develop-
 ments, it need not be pushed aside as too complicated to be
 understood.  Because of its complexity, some members of the
 intelligence community are inclined to throw up their hands
 Approved For Release 2005/03/15 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000100020001-2
 and ignore this potential tool.  However, FLINT is not too
 difficult to comprehend or use, nor is it an end in itself, but it
 can contribute essential, accurate information to the intelli-
 gence process.
 Scientific intelligence and, in particular, ELINT, or electronic
 intelligence, had its start in England immediately before World
 War II.  Early in 1939 the British Committee for the Scientific
 Study of Air Defense first drew attention to Britain's ignorance
 of new German weapons.  One scientist, Dr. R. V. Jones, was
 appointed to look into the matter.  Before he even started his
 task the war broke out and in June 1940, Dr. Jones, after con-
 siderable study, concluded that the Germans had developed a
 radio beam by which their bombers could operate over England
 regardless of weather, darkness, or cloud cover and still be most
 accurate in their blind bombing.  This beam, just a little more
 than one-half mile wide, passed directly over London.  Based
 on Dr. Jones' conclusion, steps were immediately taken to find
 any possible countermeasures.  A Royal Air Force search air-
 craft was outfitted and it accomplished its mission of looking
 for and detecting this German beam.  Technical analysis of
 this information provided the radio frequency and other char-
 acteristics of the beam, thus permitting the British to jam it
 and render. it ineffective.  Henceforth, many bombs intended
 for London fell harmlessly on the open countryside.  This in-
 terception and analysis of an enemy electronic radiation (later
 known as Knicklbein) was the birth of present day ELINT.
 The Germans altered their beam system and soon began using
 a better system utilizing intersecting beams referred to as the
 "X" apparatus, which provided greater accuracy. These beams
 were at a different frequency than Kriicklbein, requiring new
 search and analysis before the British solved this new threat
 and took countermeasures.  With the "X" apparatus, the
 bomber flew along an electronic beam while its position along
 the beam was observed from a German radar station on the
 continent.  When the bomber was over the target, it was told
 to drop its bombs. By now Britain's ELINT capability of inter-
 cepting and analyzing this electronic information was quite
 effective and continued to grow in scope and importance
 throughout the war.
 During World War II the US made extensive use of electronic
 intercept devices in both the Pacific and European Theatres of

 Operation.   Special USAF and Navy planes equipped with
 ELINT receivers ferreted out the secrets of German and Jap-
 anese antiaircraft radar and aircraft warning devices.  From
 the use of such planes the word "ferret" was coined, a term
 Presently applied to aircraft equipped to investigate enemy
 electronic radiations.  Among the most deadly weapons di-
 rected against the Eighth Air Force were the German antiair-
 craft guns which were equipped with extremely accurate radar
 directors known as "Wurzbergs."  The close formations of
 American aircraft made a juicy target for the more than 16,000
 German antiaircraft guns.  By use of radar intercept equip-
 ment (ELINT equipment) information was obtained which per-
 mitted the use of jamming devices, and thus the one-billion
 dollar investment of the Germans in their Wurzberg radars was
 literally ruined by the countermeasures made possible through
 ELINT.  Knowing we had this capability, the Germans began
 a frantic search for non-jammable radar equipment, but the
 war was over before they succeeded.
 Following World War II there was a period in which interest
 in ELINT, as in many wartime activities, tapered off.  Some
 effort continued but the real push to provide intelligence on
 electronic advancements in other countries was not initiated
 until the USSR clamped down its Iron Curtain.  Since that
 time, the collection and analysis of electronic signals radiating
 behind the Curtain has been the constant goal of ELINT. Since
 the birth of ELINT in 1940 the effort has grown in size, cost.
 importance, complexity, coverage, and capability, and, like
 most scientific efforts, is making yesterday's limits, today's
 capabilities.
 Electronic intercept, to use one connotation of ELINT, pro-
 vides factual information.  Unlike the collection of much in-
 telligence information where we are forced to rely on word of
 mouth, memory, or integrity of source, electronic radiations are
 intercepted and recorded by machine.  If a signal is being radi-
 ated it can be recorded and later reported accurately even by
 someone who doesn't understand all that he is doing.  Because
 of this factual nature, ELINT has provided substantiation of
 many intelligence estimates based on other intelligence
 processes.
 During World War II, Air Force B-24 aircraft and radar-
 equipped Navy Catalina aircraft were assigned the job of locat-
 ing enemy radar in the Pacific. They spotted and pinpointed
 Japanese air warning sets scattered all the way from the Solo-
 mons to the China coast.  A few days before the Leyte landing
 in October 1944 one of the ferrets discovered a new Japanese
 radar on Suluan Island at the mouth of the Leyte gulf.  As
 this radar commanded the approaches to the Leyte coast line
 it was necessary to eliminate it and this was done on a com-
 mando raid by the US Rangers.
 Currently, ELINT is providing the Strategic Air Command
 with the intelligence it requires on the location and range of
 Soviet radar.  Through ELINT, information is acquired on the
 method, capability, and limitations of Soviet long-range navi-
 gation systems upon which their atomic bombers rely.  Soviet
 missile tests are monitored by ELINT and the point may soon
 be reached where, by interception and analysis of the telemeter-
 ing signal from Soviet missiles, we will acquire missile per-
 formance data vital to our National Intelligence Estimates.
 (Telemetering is the electronic system used in missile testing
 which records, codes, and transmits to ground test stations such
 things as missile speed, flight path, guidance, skin tempera-
 tures, and other behavior characteristics of the missile in
 flight.)
 Since early in World War II the Army, Navy, and Air Force
 each have expended varying degrees of effort on ELINT, and in
 1952 the Central Intelligence Agency entered the ELINT field.
 Although much of this individual endeavor was valuable, in
 1954 better organization was given to ELINT -organization
 on a national level.  The lack of proper dissemination of val-
 uable intelligence produced by one organization but not always
 readily available to the others in the community was noted as a
 serious problem.  When this situation came to the attention of
 the National Security Council a study was made, and National
 Security Council intelligence Directive No. 17, entitled Elec-
 tronic Intelligence  (ELINT)  was issued  (in May 1955).
 NSCID-17 established the first national policy for ELINT and
 it is still the basic authority for the national ELINT program.
 It directed that:
 a. The US Communications Intelligence Board
 (USCIB) shall be the national policy body for ELINT.

 b. The Department of Defense and the Central In-
 telligence Agency shall be responsible for their respec-
 tive ELINT collection activities.
 c. The technical processing of all ELINT shall be
 accomplished in a jointly-staffed center administered
 by the Department of Defense.
 d. All data collected by the collection agencies shall
 be made available to the National Technical Process-
 ing Center (NTPC).
 e. The NTPC shall effect the fullest and most expe-
 ditious processing possible and furnish the results to
 the interested agencies.
 The present national organization for ELINT is rather com-
 plex, with many interlocking organizations and many formal
 and informal coordinating committees.  The important con-
 sideration is that each of the services and CIA is free to run its
 own collection operations designed to furnish information it
 alone requires, but is expected to submit all collected data to
 the NTPC subject only to the minimum delays necessitated by
 prior exploitation for urgent tactical or operational purposes.
 One can immediately see the strong vertical organization for
 ELINT within each major component.  It should also be appre-
 ciated that much horizontal collaboration is being accom-
 plished by joint participation in such organizations as the
 NTPC and AFOIN-Z in an effort to coordinate individual activi-
 ties into a national ELINT program.
 In October 1953 a study was made of ELINT in CIA.  This
 resulted in the appointment of an Agency ELINT staff officer
 and in the preparation of an Agency ELINT program which the
 Director of Central Intelligence approved on 29 May 1954.
 Within the Agency ELINT is organized generally as follows.
 The Office of Scientific Intelligence develops targets and
 requirements for ELINT collection, furnishes scientific and
 technical guidance to Agency collectors, and performs the tech-
 nical analysis and collation of ELINT with all source material
 in the production of scientific intelligence.  The Clandestine
 Services conducts a continuing review of the potential and
 capabilities for covert ELINT collection, implements specific
 clandestine activity in response to approved ELINT require-
 ments, and coordinates US ELINT clandestine activities with
 foreign governments.  The Office of Communications arranges
 for research, development, and procurement of ELINT equip-
 ment as required to support clandestine ELINT collection. The
 CIA ELINT Staff Officer advises the Deputy Director of Central
 Intelligence and appropriate operating components on the
 formulation, implementation, and coordination of ELINT
 plans, policies, and programs.
 On the national level, much work has gone into summarizing
 what each organization requires in the way of information on
 enemy electronic developments.  This sizeable task has re-
 sulted in a formal statement of the currently definable Specific
 ELINT Collection Requirements (SPECOR).  This collection
 guide is based on the priority of the National Intelligence Ob-
 jectives.  It has been disseminated throughout the services and
 CIA field units for guidance as to what information the intelli-
 gence community requires and in what priority.
 To realize the need for an adequate requirements system,
 consider that the ideal ELINT system is one capable of collect-
 ing all s bgnals of interest and extracting all of the useful infor-
 mation from each signal.  This is neither possible nor prac-
 ticable, however.  The questions of just what signals are of
 interest and just what information about them is needed must
 be answered in the light of the gaps in our intelligence.  Thus,
 as in other branches of technical intelligence, ELINT is faced
 with the problem of relating scientific techniques to intelli-
 gence problems.
 In general, ELINT targets fall into two major categories.
 The Army, Navy, and Air Force, charged with the military de-
 fense of our country, are primarily concerned with the location
 and capability of all enemy radar on a current basis.  This is
 referred to as the Radar Order of Battle (ROB).        The Air
 Force, for instance, must know where the heavy concentrations
 of enemy radar are so that its planes can either skirt the area
 or take proper countermeasures.  The largest portion of inter-
 cepted enemy electronic information falls into this category of
 maintaining an adequate radar order of battle.  CIA, on the
 other hand, is primarily interested in scientific break-through,
 or in not being surprised by new enemy electronic develop-

 Approved For Release 2005/03/15 : CIA-RDP78T03194A000100020001-2
 ments.  This means that most ELINT effort is directed toward
 the interception and analysis of new and unusual electronic
 signals.  Naturally in the course of searching for new and un-
 usual signals, much order of battle information is received.
 This serves, in addition to supplementing the services opera-
 tions,
 as a basis of comparison to determine what is new and
 unusual.  The ELINT objectives of first priority to CIA relate
 to those signals which have yet to be intercepted or for which
 the radiating source has yet to be seen.  Specifically, the
 targets are as follows:
 a. Those non-communication signals which are, or
 are suspected to be, associated with the Soviet or
 Satellite ability to deliver atomic or other weapons of
 destruction - that is, guidance or telemetry signals
 associated with missiles, airborne navigation, and
 bombing systems.
 b. Those non-communication signals which are or
 are suspected to be associated with the Soviet or Satel-
 lite ability to defend their countries against the deliv-
 ery of atomic or other weapons of destruction -that is,
 early warning, ground-control intercept, gap-filling
 radars, surface-to-air weapons systems, airborne weap-
 ons systems, ground surveillance systems, jammers,
 and so forth.
 c. Those signals occupying an unusual portion of
 the radio frequency spectrum not normally associated
 with Soviet or Satellite equipment.
 The equipment involved in ELINT is elaborate and com-
 plex.                                                        To make matters worse, the higher up the frequency
 spectrum you go the shorter your intercept range becomes,
 and the present trend toward higher frequencies means that
 ELINT equipment must get closer to the target or be designed
 with greater ranges, both of which approach the impossible.
 ELINT equipment falls into two main catagories: collection
 equipment (airborne, maritime, fixed station, or agent-carried)
 and analysis equipment (used on the ground to reproduce,
 readout, and analyze the collected information).  Basically,
 the major components of an ELINT collection system are the
 antenna, receiver, recorder, direction finder, and analyzer.
 The antenna corresponds to the human ear.  It is that com-
 ponent which first detects a signal.  It is, of course, desirable
 that the antenna be very sensitive or, as we say in ELINT, have
 high antenna gain.  This permits the maximum intercept
 range.  The ideal antenna system would have the following
 characteristics:
 a. a continuous and fixed broad area coverage,
 b. very broad electronic spectrum coverage,
 c. very high gain,
 d. inherent capability for giving directional in-
 formation.
 These requirements are not all compatible.  In practice it is
 necessary to compromise in order to gain a workable system.
 The decision as to which of the desirable characteristics can
 be safely compromised, and to what extent, is based on the fre-
 quency range of interest and also on the specific ELINT target
 under consideration.  For instance, broad area coverage may
 be obtained by either of two means - a broad beam antenna
 fixed in space or a narrow beam, scanning antenna.  The first
 method demands a sacrifice in gain.  The second limits the
 time coverage of any part of the total area.
 Following receipt of the signal by the antenna it is passed to
 a receiver.  The function of the receiver is to convert trans-
 mitted information available at the antenna into a form that
 can be measured and recorded.  Basically two general types of
 receivers are in use today - the superheterodyne and the
 crystal video.  The operating characteristics of each receiver
 may be outlined as follows:
 Superheterodyne - slow scan.
 a. inherently high sensitivity,
 b. good frequency resolution,

 c. prohibitively long search time in many cases.

 a. low sensitivity reducing maximum probable

 b. frequency resolution problems,

 main reasons for recording signals.^rA permanent record of the'
 signal is required for future analysis and for records, and on
 signals of
 h
 s
 ort duration or higher complexity the operator
 may not have enough time or capability to evaluate the signal
 parameters before the transmission is ended.
 Direction-finding equipment is sometimes utilized during the
 interception of the signal.  It displays incoming signals on an
 oscilloscope or other azimuth-reading device giving the direc-
 tion of the arrival of the signal.
 Analyzers in the ELINT collection system are sometimes used
 during interception to provide a preliminary observation of the
 type of modulation and to measure the repetition rate, dura-
 tion, and general shape of signal pulses.  Signals are usually
 presented by a cathode ray tube (similar to a television screen),
 which provides a moving picture of the shape, size, and nature
 of the incoming signal pulse or wave form.  The pictures are
 usually photographed as a permanent record. It should be
 pointed out that ELINT collection devices need not be huge
 in size, as are those used in ground, sea, and some airborne
 operations.  Quite to the contrary, considerable use is made of
 miniature equipment no larger than a book. ELINT collection
 equipment is usually designed for the specific situation in-
 volved, whether it be a 60-foot parabolic antenna on the ground
 or a tiny, unassuming, hand-carried package.
 The major components of an ELINT analysis system vary
 greatly with the purpose of the analysis.  Order-of-battle
 analysis is often done automatically by IBM-type equipment.
 The analysis that CIA performs is not for order of battle but is
 to identify new and unusual signals.  For this, man-operated
 equipment is required and an analysis position contains at least

 the following fundamental equipment: a tape transport used
 for duplicating or monitoring; a counter that measures and
 illustrates the modulation frequency; an ink-on-paper recorder
 to draw a continuous trace of the signal amplitude; an oscil-
 loscope, which permits observation of the wave form; a vibra-
 lizer to display modulation frequency components versus time;
 filters to separate signals; a rapid-advance movie camera; and
 a host of other equipment to permit the analyst to scan great
 volumes of tape and film to separate that minute portion which,
 upon detailed analysis, may prove to be a new electronic devel-
 opment.
 It is hoped that this basic discussion of ELINT will provide a
 general concept of this complex scientific intelligence process.
 It should be realized that in the interest of readability many
 points have been simplified and technical details omitted so as
 not to confuse the non-technical reader.
 If one considers that one-third of the cost of a modern fighter
 aircraft goes for electronic equipment and that most of the
 electronic devices which make up this equipment radiate sig-
 nals, then one begins to understand how much there is to learn
 of Soviet capabilities by examining their use of electronics.
 This also applies to ground and sea weapons, including missiles.
 Recent news reports of Soviet developments in the scientific
 field demonstrate how heavily the Russians are relying on elec-
 tronics and how advanced their development is.  The Soviet
 earth satellites with their radiated signals are a responsibility
 of ELINT.  ELINT must continue to intercept and to analyze
 Soviet electromagnetic emissions preferably in the research and
 development stages in order to keep abreast of Soviet electronic
 advancements and to attempt to predict future capabilities.

 REPORT ON HUNGARIAN REFUGEES
 Guy E. Coriden
 The Hungarian Revolution of October 1956 provided an un-
 precedented opportunity for the collection of intelligence on a
 Soviet Bloc country. Each of the many facets of intelligence
 activity played its role.  Every known Free World and Bloc
 intelligence organization was involved.  Every Hungarian
 refugee who could toddle was a potential target for an intelli-
 gence-minded group.                                                                        It is obviously impossible, therefore, to
 claim with good conscience to tell the "intelligence story" of
 the Hungarian Revolution.     It is also impossible to get the
 many participants to agree on which of the many efforts was
 the most fruitful.  This, then, will be the account of one
 activity - the collection of the intelligence information and
 material from the Hungarians who were admitted to the US.
 Other operations will be mentioned only as they are considered
 ix-rtinent.  Because the opportunity was unique, certain adap-
 tations in intelligence collection methods were required to take
 lull advantage of it.  The object was to extract the maximum
 anwunt of intelligence at a minimum cost while still. abiding
 by decent rules of human conduct.  As the methods used were
 lit-cessarily determined by the processing and resettlement pro-
 erdcurs as well as by the official US Government attitude to-
 ward intelligence exploitation, it might be well to begin with a
 brief historical background.
 'I'hc story of the revolution has been told many times, prob-
 ably best by the UN in its massive report.  The outbreak took
 place on 23 October 1956, and in the months following, it is
 ratlrnated that 188,000 Hungarians found refuge in Austria and
 18.000 in Yugoslavia.  As of 1 September 1957, approximately
 35.000 of these refugees had accepted asylum in the US.
 In early November 1956, when it became apparent that a
 num"ive influx of Hungarians was going to have to be resettled,
 It wu4 decided that Camp Kilmer, New Jersey, would be the
 prOcessing center for all of the refugees.  Because the iinstalla-
 lton was an Army camp, the Army was charged with the initial
 Iftlxonsibility for coordinating the resettlement effort and pro-
 tiding all of the housekeeping services.                                                                          On 12 December 1956,

 Indeed, methods and procedures were developed, abandoned,
 and reinstituted many times in the early days of the operation.
 Also the prevailing attitudes, both official and public, changed
 appreciably over the months.  In the early days the primary
 concern was to provide a humanitarian welcome for the vic-

 for internal security and the collection of material bearing on
 motivations came to the fore.
 A few statistics may help to give some idea of the scope of
 both the intelligence collection problem and the opportunities.
 Hungary is a nation with a population roughly equal to that
 of Pennsylvania and a land area just slightly smaller than that
 of Indiana.  About 65 percent of the population was consid-
 ered to be rural, and 16 percent was concentrated in Budapest
 and its environs.  The 188,000 people who fled the country
 during the great exodus represented about 2 percent of the
 population.  No age distribution is readily available for pre-
 revolutionary Hungary, but 83 percent of the refugees received
 into the US were under 40 years of age, and approximately 64
 percent of them were males.  This is certainly not a typical
 slice from an old country in a near postwar period.  Also
 despite the fact that Hungary is predominately rural, less than
 1 percent of the group coming to the US admitted to being
 engaged in agricultural enterprises.  This is probably easily
 explained on two counts: first, the land owners, even collective
 farmers, are less likely to leave than the landless; and second,
 those of rural background, faced with new opportunities and
 feeling that they have little prospect of owning land in the new
 country, are likely to follow the prevailing trend toward city
 occupations, even to the extent of falsifying their background
 statements.  Another survey of the refugees who were over 16
 years of age (excluding housewives) revealed that the average
 education of the group coming to the US was almost 10 years.
 The fact that the refugees were young, well educated, male,
 and engaged primarily in nonagricultural enterprises is a
 happy one when we think of the group both as a national
 asset and as a positive foreign intelligence target.  The addi-
 tional fact that this predominately urban group formed about
 1 percent of the total population of a small agricultural country
 should mean that not only every trade and industry but every
 major enterprise should be represented by a delegate in the US
 group.  It is well recognized that a certain number of the Hun-
 garians probably succumbed to the human tendency to exag-
 gerate and alter their backgrounds, but it is believed that the
 distortion is not significant for our purposes.

 In November 1956 the intelligence community faced the pro
 lem of exploiting the Hungarians without the benefit of even:
 the crude statistics presented in this article.  The known fac
 were that tens of thousands of Hungarians were crossing th
 border to seek refuge in the Free World.                                                                Some were sincere
 patriots who had jeopardized their lives for their country in.,
 the revolution; some were opportunists seeking economic
 betterment; and some were intelligence agents with missions,
 to collect intelligence, to establish nets or to report on they
 activities of Hungarians in the first two categories.  Austria
 found its border area inundated with the Hungarians an
 could not screen them thoroughly with the resources at its dis-,,,
 posal.  At the same time the Austrian government did note .7'
 wish to provoke the Soviet Union by allowing other Western
 nations to set up obvious intelligence procedures as a first step
 in the resettlement process.  A number of the refugees were
 willing and even anxious to impart information of value to the
 Western powers, both for patriotic reasons and in order to
 secure more favorable treatment.  The more enterprising of
 these found their way to one or another of the overt US or UK,
 missions operating in Austria.  Reports coming back from
 these missions were the first indications of the high caliber,
 intelligence-wise, of the refugee horde.  It was impossible to
 begin the problem of cataloguing the intelligence assets in
 Austria, so the next best thing seemed to be an attack on the
 same problem in the US.  The NSCID #7 Committee has the.
 responsibility for domestic exploitation. It was now faced with .
 the problem of exploiting a large, but indefinite number of
 sources without any prospect of additional manpower to meet
 the vastly increased workload.
 In casting about for a solution to such an undertaking, the
 training cadre of the Armed Services Prisoner Intelligence Com-
 mittee (ASPIC) seemed best fitted for the mission in terms of
 qualifications and availability.  This was an Army-Navy-Air
 Force-CIA unit which, in time of war, could be expanded to deal
 with certain aspects of the prisoner interrogation problem. At
 the time of the Hungarian eruption it consisted of a group of
 intelligence language experts furnished by the Army and Air
 Force as a basic cadre.  Under the auspices of the NSCID #7
 committee, advanced units of ASPIC were sent to Camp Kilmer
 in December to establish a process for assessing the intelligence

 value of the refugees, in preparation for a full exploitation.  At
 this time the prevailing sentiment among those responsible for
 ,'Operation Mercy" was a desire to extend undiluted Western
 hospitality to the Hungarians.  At this early stage there was
 an attitude of mild horror toward any intelligence activity.
 The advanced unit found it necessary, therefore, to act under
 a cover - the Historical and Statistical Survey Team (HSS).
 The activity of the unit was restricted to obtaining background
 information on the individual Hungarians and collecting such
 documents and possessions as could be pried loose without cre-
 .ating a furor.  Through its own efforts and with the coopera-
 tion of the authorities who were processing the Hungarians,
 HSS was given ready access to the information which was avail-
 able to all processing authorities.  This information generally
 consisted of name, place of birth, former occupation, military
 service, and, in some cases, education and language capabil-
 ities.  Because of language difficulties and a normal human
 desire to describe one's background in the best light, the educa-
 tion and occupation data were of limited value.  With the per-
 mission of the authorities a certain number of the refugees
 were selected for extended interviews.  Here again the prevail-
 ing sentiment toward humanitarianism, the complications of
 processing the many homeless, confused people in a humane
 and overt way presented an amazing number of difficulties for
 the surveying teams.  Refugees were difficult to locate, suspi-
 cious, or overly garrulous.                                                                                                                               The intelligence operation was at
 the low end of the priority scale at the camp.  There was incle-
 ment weather, a complicated system of drawing meal tickets,
 and the usual spate of unsettling rumors.       Methods were de-
 veloped by HSS on one day, altered the next, and discarded on
 the third day - all in response to the changing conditions and
 reactions.  On the basis of the original inadequate informa-
 tion, about 6,000 refugees were selected for their intelligence
 potential and were asked to submit to an initial interview.  Of
 these, about 3,600 complied with the request, and slightly more
 than 2,000 proved to have sufficient potential to justify record-
 ing a Preliminary Interrogation Report (PIR).  These ranged
 from scientists or ministerial officials with detailed knowledge
 of intra-Bloc operations to private soldiers with knowledge of
 troop and supply locations in one limited area.

 that they were safe and could extract favors in return for serv-
 ices or information.  When the refugee reached his destination
 and was integrated in a com
 munity, protective relatives and
 friends frequently became a barrier or encouraged a suspicious
 attitude.  Simply stated, the refugee, like a bewildered child
 in an unfamiliar situation, responds best to a friendly, solid
 person who understands him.  As he becomes wise to the way
 of the new world these psychological factors favoring coopera
 tion disappear.  Then each case takes on more individuality
 and the treatment which has placed the refugee in this specific
 situation is the important thing to look into for any needed
 !ever to cooperation.
 It was decided that to take advantage of the situation the
 intensive intelligence exploitations should be carried out by a
 second interagency group with the cover name of US Sociolog-
 ical and Technical Research Unit (USSTRU).  This unit was
 CONFIDENTIAL
 activated on 10 January 1957.  While maintaining some sem-
 blance of separate operations, HSS and USSTRU cooperated
 fully; and when conditions permitted, sources were shuttled
 from one to the other.  About ninety different individuals
 from CIA, comparable numbers from the Army and the Air
 Force, and a few from Navy and State participated in the
 USSTRU operation.  No large portion of the group was there
 at any one time - the ceiling at the peak of the operations
 was about 60 persons from all participating agencies. Because
 in the case of USSTRU the most effective collection could be
 done by analysts and intelligence officers having knowledge of
 the particular areas covered and gaps to be filled, specialists
 from all parts of the intelligence community were rotated to
 Camp Kilmer for time periods varying from a few days to sever-
 al weeks.  Members of both intelligence units operated with a
 degree of dedication comparable to that shown by the people
 engaged in the processing and settling of Hungarians.  For
 most of the period the work week consisted of seven 12- to 14-
 hour days.
 Although the constant flow of experts through the intelli-
 gence operating units provided the best qualified interviewers,
 they also created continuing problems.  The light cover re-
 quired a certain degree of caution which was difficult to main-
 tain under the circumstances.  This mass participation meth-
 od, however, had the added advantage of acquainting the whole
 intelligence community with the potential of the Hungarian
 refugees and the problems involved in exploiting this potential.
 Many of the large number of analysts involved were given their
 first experience in interviewing a source through the use of an
 interpreter and in reporting on information in which they were
 not expert.  We have introduced the problem of interpreters,
 and this might be the place to say that early in the game two
 language factors came to light: (a) the intelligence community
 probably has fewer language specialists in Hungarian than in
 any other but the most exotic Eastern and Near Eastern lan-
 guages, and (b) the Hungarians have a lower coefficient of sec-
 ond-language competence than any other civilized population
 except Americans.  The shortage of competent Hungarian
 translators was a limiting factor in the size of the operation
 throughout its existence.  Those who did come forward were
 used for long periods of time and were released only with great

 PAPER MILLS AND FABRICATION
 Stephen M. Arness
 The paper mill and fabrication problem has appeared in
 many forms including outright fabrication, the sale of pseudo-
 intelligence, false confirmation, and multiple distribution of
 both valid and false information, as well as organized decep-
 tion. by foreign governments.
 US intelligence agencies as well as all Free World intelligence
 agencies have been flooded with such information.  It was esti-
 mated in 1952 that more than half of all the material received
 on several countries of greatest intelligence interest fell into
 these categories.  US estimates were thus endangered and
 American intelligence efforts have been needlessly dissipated.
 Multiple dissemination by paper mills operated by exiles from
 the Soviet Bloc cuts particularly deeply into the professional
 manpower resources of all agencies.  Working independently
 of each other, American intelligence agencies were slow in de-
 veloping a mechanism for benefiting methodically from their
 common experience in order to remedy this situation.
 Paper mills are defined as intelligence sources whose chief
 aim is the maximum dissemination of their product.  Their
 purpose is usually to promote special emigre-political causes
 while incidentally financing emigre-political organizations.
 The information thus conveyed consists of a mixture of valid
 information, overt material, propaganda, and fabrication. Its
 bulk, form, and obscure origin frequently preclude successful
 analysis and evaluation.
 Fabricators are individuals or groups who, without genuine
 agent resources, invent their information or inflate it on the
 basis of overt news for personal gain or a political purpose.
 The line between the two categories, in many cases, is diffi-
 cult to draw.
 Competent fabrication has defied recognition on the part of
 analysts and evaluators.  Well-planned deception or provoca-
 tion is apt to prove undetectable by analytical processes. It
 cannot be assumed, therefore, that more than a fraction of the
 number of actually existing cases in these categories have been
 identified.  The established professional competence of the

 ffered them
 a ready-made opportunity to
 remain alive and to preserve a Political organization b
 Ong alleged intelligence.  Careful operational analysis d m-
 onstrated that few, if any, emigre organizations had valid and
 unique intelligence assets; they lacked primarily the technical
 communications and documentation facilities for continuous
 contact with the homeland.  Despite this, the unfortunate
 fiction persisted that such organizations had undefined special
 means of obtaining intelligence.
 In many cases exile leaders neither understood nor respected
 the basic preiiiise of TT o Policy theacked.            "S Policy not to engage in war unless
 att       Their "intelligence" production, true, embroidered,
 or false, was inevitably used to influence US policy in the direc-
 tion of hostility to the Soviet Bloc and to satisfy the ambitions
 of political pressure groups.
 SECRET
 To state the obvious: each exile group, as each sovereign
 country, used the weapons at its command in its self-interest,
 enlightened or otherwise.  Emigre groups considered intelli-
 gence production a weapon to be so used.  Yet the record of US
 dealings with them shows that in case after case it ignored the
 fact that the satisfaction of US intelligence needs was clearly
 secondary to their own political interests.  One effect of the
 cry-wolf policy on the part of the emigres and the recognition
 of their efforts to mislead is that one of their reports may be
 ignored.
 Immediately after the war, several exile groups had man-
 power assets behind the Iron Curtain.  Hasty, uncoordinated,
 and totally insecure operational use of these assets by both
 emigre groups and Free World intelligence agencies permitted
 the Communist security services to identify and destroy or to
 use them.  Initial failure in the West to recognize the ruth-
 lessness and efficacy of the Soviet-type police state contributed
 to this process which, generally speaking, was completed by
 1950.
 In view of this, it became apparent that nothing could be
 achieved by further uncontrolled subsidies to exile groups.
 Assertion of operational control by US intelligence officers
 through financial or other means, it could be expected, would
 normally be resented and sabotaged by such groups as it would
 strike at the roots of their political purposes.  Generally, it
 was found advisable not to deal exclusively with the political
 leadership, but to take advantage of dissidence within the
 groups and to make it plain that intelligence production on our
 terms was valued more highly than the leaders' political coop-
 eration.  The leaders, finding personal control of their groups
 effectively endangered, then were apt to come to terms.
 This strategy was followed increasingly in those operations
 involving Satellite exile groups with which CIA had contact.
 However, unless all intelligence agencies also recognize these
 principles and effectively suppress extraneous, uncoordinated
 aid to these groups, the uncontrolled information-peddling
 pattern will certainly persist or recur.
 The fact that substantial funds for intelligence procurement
 have been available to numerous agencies may actually be a
 handicap.  Exile groups and individual intelligence peddlers

 SECRET                     99
 The Communist concept of intelligence operations, patterned
 on the Soviet model, embraces a much broader field than does
 the Anglo-American.  Far from being limited to seeking infor-
 mation through clandestine operations, it includes within the
 scope of "state security" a great variety of tasks designed to
 maintain the Communist Party in power and suppress all op-
 position. This means that all activity which can be construed
 as even critical of the state becomes a priority intelligence tar-
 get.
 The Communist security services accordingly make every ef-
 fort to penetrate and control emigre movements abroad which
 may endanger their regime. This is not a difficult task. Emigre
 groups have operated openly in the West with little regard for
 security, and normally have admitted as members anyone who
 voices his anti-Communism strongly enough to be heard and
 who cannot be positively identified as a Communist agent.
 These two facts - that penetration and control of the opposi-
 tion abroad are among the most important Soviet and Satel-
 lite intelligence tasks, and that they are so easily accom-
 plished - lead to the assumption that emigre groups can
 keep only few secrets from the Soviet and Satellite governments,
 and that Soviet and Satellite agents may be high in the coun-
 cils of such organizations.
 There can be no reasonable doubt, furthermore, that Soviet
 and Satellite intelligence services have had the same easy access
 to the bulk of the emigre "intelligence" product as we do.  It
 follows that Soviet intelligence analysts are apt to have a grasp
 of the extent of US information on the Soviet Bloc procured
 from such sources.  They are thus able to base their deception
 planning on a thorough knowledge both of US intelligence pro-
 curement methods through exile groups and of much of the
 information in US hands against which deception is likely to
 be checked.
 The lengths to which the Soviet Government will go in keep-
 ing track of emigre activities can best be illustrated by an
 historic case.  During the nineteen twenties and thirties, in
 France, Soviet Intelligence obtained control of the Ligne In-
 terieure, an "elite secret group" within the strongest Russian
 emigre organization of the day, the General Russian Military
 Union (ROVS).      The Ligne Interieure had been designed by
 the ROVS for the centralization and political control of Rus-
 assume that cost is no object to US intelligence personnel.
 Innumerable instances are on record in which payment for;
 both good and bad information was wholly out of proportion
 to its true value.  US financial liberality and competitive
 bidding among agencies has led to inflation in the intelligence;
 market.  Quality intelligence is seldom to be found in pieces
 of paper upon which a peddler has placed a price tag.
 Virtually all outright fabrication cases can be attributed pri-
 marily to disregard for factors such as the following:
 a. Control of agents should include their direct financial
 dependence upon the intelligence officers handling them.
 b. Salaries of agents and sub-agents should be based upon
 sound estimates of actual living costs in indigenous terms,
 and exceed these only moderately.  Excessive personal com-
 pensation, particularly when it is used to encourage volume
 ,
 of production, is a common cause of padding and fabrication.:
 c. A portion of the agents' earnings should be withheld in.
 special blocked accounts until their services are satisfactorily
 completed.
 d. Unless the use of funds available to agents for opera-
 tional expenditures is closely controlled, security breaches or
 the purchase of embroidered and fabricated material will
 result.
 e. Subsidies to foreign intelligence services and groups
 must be carefully watched to prevent financing by them of
 recognized paper mill operators and fabricators.
 US intelligence agencies abroad have reacted in various ways
 to the problem of uncoordinated spending on intelligence pro-
 curement, provided they were aware of it.  Local coordination
 on a varying scale has taken place spontaneously in some areas.
 In the past some CIA field stations, concentrating their avail-
 able manpower on procuring good information, paid no atten-
 tion to US competitors in the field; others treated the problem
 as one of counterespionage. For the most part, however, efforts
 have been made to establish the origin of all information from
 the area, regardless of the agency purchasing it.  In some in-'
 stances the attendant waste of professional manpower overseas
 has been prodigious.  It is estimated, for example, that one-
 third of CIA's intelligence officers in Austria were committed
 during June 1951 to the detection and neutralization of fabri-
 cators and paper mills.

 sian emigre groups, especially those of military usefulness.,
 This aim naturally appealed to most White Russian emigres;
 however, since the Ligne Interieure was under Soviet control,
 it simultaneously served the purpose of making virtually the
 whole White Russian emigration subject to Soviet inspection;`
 and manipulation.  In 1935 this Soviet control was exposed:;"
 when the head of the Ligne Interieure, the Soviet agent Gen-
 eral Skoblin, was discovered to have organized the kidnapping
 of General Yevgeni Miller, then head of the ROVS. His inten-
 tion had been to replace Miller with a Soviet-controlled substi-
 tute.                                                     In subsequent investigations the background of the So-
 viet conspiracy outlined above was uncovered in detail.
 These considerations should not lead to an automatic as-
 sumption that information received from emigre groups is
 planned Soviet deception or provocation.  In most cases there
 is no substantial evidence that the originators of fabrication
 were, or are, agents of the Soviets, that the material has been
 supplied to them by Soviet intelligence, or that it constitutes
 Soviet deception.  On the other hand, it is known that the
 Soviets are masters of deception and provocation and are will-
 ing to accept extraordinary sacrifices in terms of true informa-
 tion passed, in order to make deception stick at the proper mo-
 ment.  This leads to the conclusion that the Soviets may be
 using the present to digest their information and to develop
 potential deception channels and materials, reserving decep-
 '
 tion operations for moments and circumstances of their own :-
 choosing.
 The theory that analysts in Washington are in a position to
 detect deception or fabrication rests on the assumption that
 they have verified material at hand against which they can
 measure their reports.  Under the pressure of the volume of
 invalid material they must process, with little verified "control"
 material to go by, evaluators must rely on their personal skill
 and instinct.  Their judgment is thus increasingly subject to
 human error.   On the whole, analysis alone, whether on a high
 or low level in US intelligence, has been unable to break fabrica-
 or deception cases except when the material lacked quality.
 tion
 Evaluators are handicapped not only by their ignorance of the
 operational circumstances under which the information is pro-
 cured, but by the amount of processing and re-processing to
 which it is subjected before it reaches them.  Translations,
 SECRET                    101
 revisions, and summaries of spurious information frequently
 eliminate the flaws which might allow an analyst to detect a
 fraud in the original.  It is the lesson of experience that fab-
 rication and multiple false confirmation can be detected only
 by the method of operational investigation of the source and
 transmission channels, combined with reports analysis.
 There can be no doubt that the Soviets are fully capable of
 planting information in our intelligence channels which has all
 the earmarks of being genuine.  Only by careful scrutiny and
 cross-checking of the channels through which such deception
 material has been forwarded can the danger be reduced.
 Unfortunately the following doctrines, which are fallacious
 and detrimental to the US intelligence effort, are still wide-
 spread among intelligence personnel:
 a. That intelligence agents of all nationalities are entitled
 to keep secret from their US intelligence officers the iden-
 tities, antecedents, methods of operation, and means of access
 to information produced, of their subsources.
 b. That it is the mission of intelligence officers in the field
 to procure information without a determined attempt to
 ascertain its origin, leaving it to the experts in Washington
 to judge its validity.
 c. That overseas sources are in danger of compromise if
 identities are revealed to other agencies of the US Govern-
 ment which were established, trained, and equipped to pro-
 tect such information properly.
 The last mentioned concept fostered resistance among intel-
 ligence officers of various government agencies which prevented
 a long overdue exchange of information on fabricators and
 paper mills.  As a result, an excessive amount of professional
 manpower had to be devoted to costly overseas investigation,
 where simple headquarters coordination of suspect sources
 would have revealed duplication or fraud.
 The steady concentration of US intelligence agencies on mili-
 tary targets in the Soviet Bloc, and the relatively small influx
 after 1946 of knowledgeable new sources, have tended to solidify
 the intelligence market.  Since 1946, in many areas, agencies
 of the Government have been dealing with identical intelligence
 sources. This makes a systematic program of centralized reg-
 istration of sources both necessary and profitable.

 Among the European powers, sentiment was building toward
 mediation in the
 war and recognition of the Confederacy, if not
 toward actual intervention on its behalf.  The British were
 provoked to these attitudes by the shortage of cotton for their
 textile mills, resulting in unemployment and deprivation for
 hundreds of thousands of workers; by a preference of the Brit-
 ish nobility for the aristocratic, Anglo-Saxon South over the
 heterogeneous, "mongrelized" North; by the desire of the
 British Government to see two rival pygmies instead of a single
 united giant on the Ca
 di
 na
 an frontier; and by general national
 anger toward supposedly hostile Northern actions such as the
 blockade and the removal by a Yankee warship of two Con-
 federate agents from a British mail steamer, the Trent.  Subtle
 propaganda by Confederate agents in Great Britain provided a
 catalyst for these sentiments, and the rout of the Federal troops
 at Second Bull Run fired the retort.  Recognition of the Con-
 federacy by Her Majesty's Government and a negotiated peace
 .on the. basis of Southern independence loomed as a startling
 reality to the North in the shambles of its defeated army.
 Britain would have been followed by Napoleon III of France,
 who had the assurance of Confederate support and eventual
 recognition of any French conquests in Mexico in return for
 his recognition of the Confederacy-which had, in effect, al-
 ready repudiated the Monroe Doctrine.
 The South responded to news of the great victory at Second
 Bull Run with a demand that the war now be carried into
 Yankee territory.  Newspapers in every Southern city spoke
 for their readers when they clamored for an immediate invasion
 of the North.  Sentiments similar to those stirring the average
 Southern citizen also motivated the leaders of the Confederacy.

 Lee agreed that Southern military success had put the Con-
 federacy in a position to state its political objectives leading to
 an honorable peace, but he still felt that one more victory over
 the Federal troops -- and this one a victory north of the
 Potomac - would so clearly prove the strength of the Con-
 federate position that the North must accede to any demand
 for peace.  Such a victory might well affect the coming Con-
 gressional elections in the North as well as influence the waver-
 ing British and French Governments to recognize Southern in-
 dependence.                                                                              An offer of peace after a great victory would be
 considered a magnanimous gesture by a victorious power rather
 than a sign of weakness by a frightened bureaucracy.
 To achieve these political ends, Lee had to gain another bat-
 tlefield victory over the Federals, and a major objective of an
 invasion of the North was therefore the Federal. Army of the
 Potomac itself.  By taking the initiative, Lee could draw his
 opponents, far less skillful than he, whoever they might be,
 into a war of maneuver in which he could win on a field and at
 a time of his choosing.  As another major objective of his in-
 vasion, Lee also intended to seize or to destroy the Pennsylvania
 Railroad bridge over the Susquehanna River at Harrisburg,
 Pennsylvania.  The seizure or the destruction of this bridge
 would sever the connecting artery between Washington and the
 \Vest.  The only other through connection to the West was at
 the periphery by way of the Hudson River and the Great Lakes.
 Lee had the capability of attaining his objectives.  With a
 victorious, battle-tested army under successful veteran com-
 inanders, Lee would be able to defeat the Federals if he were
 permitted to select the terms of reference for the battle as he
 already had done at Second Bull Run and was to do again later
 at Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville.  Lee also would be able
 to destroy the railroad bridge at Harrisburg if he reached it
 without having drawn the Federals into battle or to seize the
 bridge if he reached it after a victorious battle.
 Although his army was relatively small, Lee divided it into
 several parts, with the Federal garrisons at Harpers Ferry and
 Martinsburg in the Shenandoah Valley as targets for three
 units.  Two other units were to proceed toward Boonsboro and
 Hagerstown.  In his Special Orders 191 of 9 September 1862,
 Lee drew up his order of march and made his troop dispositions.
 Each of the key commanders mentioned in the order was sent

 While resting in this area, Private Barton W. Mitchell and
 Sergeant John M. Bloss, both of the 27th Indiana, found a copy
 of Lee's Special Orders 191 i
 n a paperd
 wrappe around three
 cigars.  The order was authenticated by Colonel Samuel E.
 Pitman, First Division Adjutant-General, who recognized the
 signature of Lee's Assistant Adjutant-General as that of Colonel
 Robert H. Chilton, with whom Pitman had served in Detroit.
 The order then was brought to McClellan, who set off to destroy
 Lee in detail.
 McClellan, dilatory by nature and convinced by his faulty
 intelligence that Lee had an army about 50 percent larger than
 the Army of the P
 t
 o
 omac was nt likl t
 ,oeyo have attacked Lee.
 Even with Lee's orders before him - orders dividing Lee's
 army - McClellan inched cautiously forward.
 Lee, informed of the loss of the copy of Special Orders 191
 that he had sent to Daniel Harvey Hill, did his best to reassem-
 ble quickly his scattered units to present a united front to the
 Federals, and on Wednesday, 17 September 1862, the Battle of
 Antietam took place.  Lee, forced to fight on the defensive for
 UNCLASSIFIED
 the first time during the war and incapable of maneuver, was
 able to stop the Federal attack only with great difficulty.  On
 19 September, Lee withdrew into Virginia, and the North was
 free of the invader.
 The railroad bridge at Harrisburg was not cut, and the North
 was able to maintain its fundamental east-west link.      Mary-
 land, eager to follow a winner, not only did not secede but even
 went so far as to increase its effort on behalf of the Union.
 With Maryland remaining loyal, Washington was neither sur-
 rounded nor isolated, and its Fifth Column remained nervously
 underground.  The fear of invasion among Northern states
 proved to be groundless, and the governors of these states
 rather than demanding troops from Washington to defend
 themselves, provided troops, albeit reluctantly, to the Union
 army.  With substantial reinforcements from the eastern
 states available, the Union was able to send Western recruits
 to Don Carlos Buell and Grant to exploit their victories at
 Perryville, Kentucky, and at Corinth, Mississippi.
 The Copperhead movement, which needed the impetus that
 a Southern victory north of the Potomac could give, never re-
 ceived this impetus and gradually lost strength as the war
 progressed.  Even at the polls this movement proved to be weak
 as Lincoln's Republicans swept the Congressional elections of
 1862 to remain in power.
 Lincoln, who had resolved upon the Emancipation Proclama-
 tion as a military, political, and psychological measure neces-
 sary to insure the ultimate conquest of the Confederacy by the
 Union, leaped upon Antietam as the victory which he needed to
 give meaning to the Proclamation.  Even though the Procla-
 mation was a political gesture, in-victory it seemed more ideal-
 istic -and realistic - than if it had followed a defeat on
 Northern territory.  After a Union defeat the Proclamation
 would have seemed to be nothing more than the empty oratory
 of a beaten demagogue rather than the noble gesture of a con-
 fident leader.
 The recognition which the South had expected from abroad
 was contingent upon a Confederate victory, and the Southern
 retreat from Maryland could hardly be construed as a victory
 even by the Confederacy's most sanguine European supporters.
 The retreat, in turn, led to second thoughts; second thoughts,
 to inaction; inaction, to continued nonrecognition -right

 Lee unequivocably blamed the failure of the invasion o

 army, pointing out the need to eliminate the threats to his

 clothing, and weapons which were some of the objectives of the
 invasion.  At the very least, if McClellan had not obtained a
 copy of Lee's orders, Lee could have reunited his army lone
 have re-equipped it with some of the hoard from Harpers Ferry
 and given his 10,000 or more stragglers time to rejoin his army.

 in the capital of Pennsylvania, astride the rail lines to Phila-
 delphia, Baltimore, and Washington, would have menaced all
 three of these terrified metropolises.  During Lee's second in-
 vasion of the North in 1863, Richard S. Ewell approached within
 three miles of Harrisburg before he was called back because of
 the chance encounter at Gettysburg.     The panic of the Penn-
 sylvania countryside at that time is a slight indication of what
 Confederate headquarters at Harrisburg might have caused -
 especially if Confederate cavalry under James E. B. ("Jeb")
 Stuart had been permitted to raid in the direction of Phila-
 delphia and even New York.
 If Lee had chosen to commit himself early rather than to
 wage psychological warfare against the three cities simultane-
 ously, he might have marched directly from a victorious battle-
 field against Baltimore or Washington.  The very Maryland
 farmers who watched impassively as Lee's half-starved tatter-
 demalions poured across the Potomac might conservatively
 have estimated that a victory by Lee on Maryland soil looked
 dangerously like the beginning of the end of the war on
 Southern terms.  The number of recruits whom Lee might
 have picked up in Maryland, under the band.-wagon steam-
 roller, would have increased sharply, thus augmenting even
 more an army in which straggling had suddenly disappeared.
 The strong secessionist tendencies indicated by Baltimore in
 April 1861 might have opened that city to Lee in 1862, per-
 mitting his entry against bare token resistance..
 Washington, thus isolated by a secessionist Maryland and
 itself swarming with a devious, opportunistic Fifth Column,
 could hardly have remained the capital.  Previously prepared
 evacuation plans might have moved the Government to Phila-
 delphia or New York while Jefferson Davis, President of the
 Confederacy, graciously doling out merciful terms to a stunned
 city, rode triumphantly down Pennsylvania Avenue.  Recog-
 nition, but no longer intervention, would have been inevitable.
 A triumphant South would have scorned intervention.
 While Lee campaigned in the North, 20,000 recruits were
 assembled in Richmond for his army.  A victorious Lee, gath-
 ering volunteers in Maryland, would hardly have needed these
 recruits.  Bragg, however, pressing on Buell in Kentucky, could
 have used the recruits, and such reinforcements might well

 ;P~Emperor Maximilian of
 Mexico.  In the struggle to get the French army out of North
 America and Maximilian off his throne, this government had
 the use of an intelligence enterprise which, though conducted
 on a small scale, turned out to be very effective.  Up to the
 last weeks this intelligence operation consisted of competent
 reporting on the part of espionage agents and diplomatic
 representatives; but when a crisis developed at that point, these
 sources were silent, and it was a cablegram from Napoleon to
 his commanders in Mexico that yielded the information needed
 by the nation's leaders.
 As an intelligence coup the interception and reading of this
 message were hardly spectacular, for it passed over fifteen
 hundred miles of telegraph wire accessible to United States
 forces and, contrary to later assertions that it had to be de-
 ciphered, it appears to have been sent in the clear.  Neverthe-
 less, the event was an outstanding one in the history of United
 States intelligence operations, not simply because it represented
 a beginning in a new field but also because the message in
 question was of crucial importance.
 State of the Union, 1861-65
 The crisis in which America's intelligence capability as-
 serted itself did not come until after the nation had spent five
 anxious years watching the European threat develop.
 Napoleon had sent an army to Mexico late in 1861, assertedly
 to compel the payment of huge debts owed by the government
 of Mexico.  His object, however, was not simply a financial
 one: a new commander whom he sent to Mexico in 1863 re-
 ceived instructions (which leaked into the press) to the effect
 that the Emperor's purpose was to establish a Mexican govern-
 ment strong enough to limit "the growth and prestige of the
 United States." 3  At a time when the American Union ap-
 peared to be breaking up under pressure from its southern half,
 such a statement meant to American readers that Napoleon
 had no intention of stopping at the Rio Grande.

 In June 1863 French arms swept the Liberal government of
 President Benito Juarez from Mexico..City= and, inAhe-su of 1864 Napoleon installed the Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian,
 thirty-two-year-old brother of Emperor Franz Joseph of Aus-
 tria, on the new throne of Mexico.  During this period the
 Northern people, their belligerence aroused by the Southern
 rebellion, were clamoring for action against France - action
 that might well bring disaster upon them.  Aggressive be-
 havior by the United States might give Napoleon the popular
 support he needed to join hands with the Confederacy in a
 declaration of war, a development that could provide Seces-
 sion with enough extra strength to prevail.
 While the Civil War lasted, Congress and the public were
 held in check largely through the prestige and political skill
 of the Federal Secretary of State, William H. Seward.  But
 when the War was over - by which time the government had
 reason to believe that Napoleon had become disenchanted with
 his puppets in Mexico - Seward was ready to turn his people's
 aggressive demeanor to advantage, and he warned Napoleon
 that their will would sooner or later prevail.  Before this state-
 ment reached Paris, however, the United States Minister there,
 John Bigelow, who had been mirroring Seward's new firmness
 for some months, had in September 1865 obtained a tentative
 statement from the French that they intended to withdraw
 from Mexico.4
 While Bigelow was shaking an admonitory finger at the
 French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, an American military fist
 was being displayed before the French along the Rio Grande.
 Promptly upon the silencing of Confederate guns, General
 Grant sent Philip Sheridan, second only to William T. Sherman
 in the esteem of the General-in-Chief, to the command of the
 Department of the Gulf, with headquarters at New Orleans.
 A considerable force was posted along the Mexican frontier
 and designated an "army of observation."

 he possessor of a-reputa-
 tion as a gamecock, adhered strongly to an opinion prevalent
 in the Army that a little forceful military action now would
 save a full-scale war later. The audacious statesman who was
 directing foreign policy at Washington was, to Sheridan, "slow
 and poky," and the general found ways of giving considerable
 covert aid to the Juarez government, then leading a nomadic
 existence in the north of Mexico.5  Sheridan and Seward,
 though the policy of each was anathema to the other, made an
 effective combination.
 One of the ways in which Sheridan could exercise his relent-
 less energy against the Imperialists without flouting Seward's
 policy was in collecting intelligence on what was going on below
 the border.  There was an interregnum at the United States
 Legation in Mexico City, and all the official news reaching
 Washington from below the Rio Grande was that supplied by
 the Juarist Minister to the United States, Matias Romero, a
 scarcely unbiased source if a prolific one.6  Sheridan quickly
 undertook to fill the gap.
 This task must have been decidedly to the general's taste, for
 he had been one of the most intelligence-conscious commanders
 in the Civil War .7 He had achieved something of an innovation
 in organizing intelligence activities when, during his 1864
 campaign in the Shenandoah Valley, he established a group of
 intelligence operatives under military control.  His previous
 sources of information, local citizens and Confederate deserters,
 had both proved unreliable.  "Sheridan's Scouts" were a mili-
 tary organization in a day when it was customary to have
 civilians perform most of the intelligence-gathering tasks other

 to-Seward correspondence in the Papers Relating to Foreign Affairs
 described in footnote 4.
 T When a division commander in 1862-63, Sheridan had exercised an
 initiative in intelligence collection that was more likely to be found
 in an army commander.  His Memoirs reveal a constantly high in-
 terest in intelligence activities.

 than battle-zone reconnaissance.  After the war, Major Henry
 Harrison Young, the- Scouts- comet- tinder;         --of    west
 men went to the Gulf Department with Sheridan.
 Sheridan also, in common with numerous other commanders
 North and South, had an acquaintance with communications
 intelligence as it was produced in the field command of that
 day.  By the time the Civil War was well advanced, Signal
 Corpsmen in every theater had learned how to solve the enemy's
 visual-signaling alphabets, and they derived much information
 for the commanders by keeping their field glasses trained on
 enemy signal stations s  There was not likely to be any op-
 portunity for such methods along the Rio Grande, however, and
 no more likely was the possibility of tapping telegraph lines
 carrying useful information.
 Young and his four men were dispatched to important points
 in northern Mexico to report on movements of the Imperial
 forces and the various projects of ex-Confederates who were
 joining Maximilian's forces and attempting to establish colonies
 under his flags  Judged by the accuracy of the reports reach-
 ing Sheridan and the strong tendency of the Southerners'
 projects to abort after coming under his notice, the work of
 these five men was most effective.'0
 1866, Year of Telegrams and Tension
 The critical question -whether the French would tire of
 their venture and withdraw - was, however, one to which no
 intelligence service could divine an answer, for the French for
 a long time did not know the answer themselves.  In 1865
 Marshal Frangois Achille Bazaine, now Napoleon's commander
 in Mexico, was informed by the Minister of War that he must
 bring the army home, and at about the same time he received

 erate Armies (Washington, 1884-1901) contains hundreds of deci-
 pherments resulting from such interceptions, chiefly in the oper-
 ations of 1863-65 in Tennessee and Georgia, the operations along
 the South Carolina coast beginning in 1863, and the Richmond-
 Petersburg siege of 1864-65.

 the throne of Mexico contained a secret clause providing that
 French military forces to the number of 20,000 were to remain
 in Mexico until November 1867.12 As events were to prove,
 however, this compact was less likely to determine Napoleon's
 course of action than were the pressures on him represented
 by the United States' vigorous diplomacy and the rising mili-
 tary power of Prussia.
 In April 1866 Minister Bigelow succeeded in pinning Na-
 poleon down to a definite understanding, to the effect that the
 28,000 French soldiers in Mexico would be brought home in
 three detachments, leaving in November 1866 and March and
 November 1867.  Seward's reply to this promise was char-
 acteristic of his tone at this time: dwelling only briefly on the
 diplomatic niceties, he suggested that the remaining period of
 occupation be shortened if possible.  The Secretary was in high
 feather; in the same month a protest by him induced the Aus-
 trian government to abandon an effort to send substantial
 reinforcements to the small Austrian force in Maximilian's
 army .l3
 In June Maximilian received a studiously insolent letter from
 Napoleon containing the stunning announcement that the
 French would withdraw.  Attention now focused on whether
 he would attempt to hold his throne without French arms.
 The unhappy sovereign reacted first by dispatching his Em-
 press, twenty-six-year-old Carlota, to Paris in a vain attempt
 to change Napoleon's mind.  He soon decided to abdicate, then
 determined to remain on his throne, then wavered for many
 weeks between abdicating and remaining 14
 Napoleon meanwhile had to contend not only with his pro-
 teg6's indecision but with some apparent recalcitrance on the

 part of Bazaine, who was variously suspected of having a secret
 agreement with Maan                         '~`uprt, of being secretly in league with the Mexican Liberals, of profit-
 ing financially from his official position, and of having hopes
 of succeeding Maximilian.  (There is evidence to support all
 these suspicions.) 16   Soon Napoleon realized he had made a
 bad bargain with the United States; to attempt to bring the
 army home in three parts would risk the annihilation of the
 last third.  Early in the autumn of 1866 the Emperor sent his
 military aide, General Castelnau, to Mexico with instructions
 to have the army ready to leave in one shipment in March, and
 to supersede Bazaine if necessary.  Thus the evacuation was
 to begin four months later than Napoleon had promised, but
 to end eight months earlier.16
 No word of this important about-face was, however, promptly
 passed to the United States government.  At the beginning of
 November - supposedly the month for the first shipment - the
 best information this country's leaders possessed was a strong
 indication that Napoleon intended to rid himself of Maximilian.
 This was contained in a letter written to Maximilian by a con-
 fidential agent whom he had sent to Europe; it showed the
 failure of Carlota's visit to Napoleon.  Somewhere between its
 point of origin, Brussels, and its destination, the office of Maxi-
 milian's consul in New York, it had fallen into the hands of a
 Juarist agent 17  Soon after Minister Romero placed it in
 Seward's hands, Napoleon's new Foreign Minister, the Marquis
 de Moustier, wrote his Minister in Washington, de Montholon,
 that the evacuation timetable was raising serious difficulties
 but that in no case would the November 1867 deadline for its

 Cruz, to find the French leaving and Juarez resuming the reins
 of government:  ills    loo    ea o ex=aenaor Lewis D.
 Campbell, newly appointed Minister to Mexico, and General
 William T. Sherman, sent with Campbell to give the mission
 prestige, to advise Juarez in regard to the many military prob-
 lems that would be plaguing him, 21 and possibly to arrange
 for the use of small numbers of United States troops to assist
 the Liberal regime by temporarily occupying certain island
 forts.22
 Evidence was accumulating that Maximilian and his Eu-
 ropean troops would soon be gone from Mexico, 23 but it stood
 no chance of general acceptance in Washington. Such was the
 degree of trust now accorded Louis Napoleon that his promise
 to evacuate Mexico would be believed on the day when the last
 French soldier took ship at Vera Cruz.
 At this juncture Sheridan's headquarters came into posses-
 sion of a copy of a coded telegram to Napoleon from Bazaine
 and Castelnau.  The message had left Mexico City by courier
 on December 3 and had been delivered to the French Consulate
 at New Orleans, from where it was telegraphed to Paris on the
 9th.  As will be explained below, there is every reason to believe
 that this message went unread by United States cryptogra-
 phers. The possession of its contents would have been of great
 value, for the message (as translated from the version given
 by Castelnau's biographer) said:
 completion be exceeded."' This note should have reached Sew-
 ard in early November (1866), but if it did, itss, strong:.hint
 not here would be no partial evacuation in that month was
 apparently lost on him.
 When the French felt able to promise complete withdrawal
 in March, de Moustier revealed to Bigelow the abandonment
 of the three-stage plan.  So alarmed was Bigelow by the pros-
 pect of a -major outbreak of anti-French feeling in America
 that he refrained from sending the news to Seward until he had
 heard it from the Emperor himself, whom he saw on November
 7.  The November shipment had been cancelled for reasons
 purely military, the Emperor said, showing surprise that the
 United States had not known of the change.  The order had
 been telegraphed to Bazaine and had been sent in the clear
 in order that "no secret might be made of its tenor in the
 United States." 19  Undoubtedly the Emperor was perfectly
 sincere in implying that he expected the United States govern-
 ment to make itself a tacit "information addressee" on tele-
 grams of foreign governments reaching its territory.
 Receiving Bigelow's report of this interview, Seward struck
 off a peremptory cablegram to Paris: the United States "can
 not acquiesce," he declared.  The 774 words of this message un-
 folded before Bigelow on November 26 and 27, their transmis-
 sion having cost the State Department some $13,000.  On De-
 cember 3 Bigelow telegraphed the Foreign Minister's assurance
 that military considerations alone were responsible for the
 change of plans and his promise, somewhat more definite than
 the previous one, that the French "corps of occupation is to
 embark in the month of March next." 20
 So strongly had this government relied on Napoleon's original
 promise that President Johnson had dispatched an important
 diplomatic mission to Mexico (republican Mexico, that is) - a
 mission that was already at sea, expecting, on arrival at Vera

 To Eiis Majesty the Emperor Napoleon-at Paris.
 Mexico, 3rd December.
 Emperor Maximilian appears to wish to remain in
 Mexico, but we must not count on it.  Since the evac-
 uation is to be completed in March, it is urgent that
 the transports arrive.  We think that the foreign regi-
 ment must also be embarked.  As for the French of-
 ficers and soldiers attached to the Mexican Corps, can
 they be allowed the option of returning?
 The country is restless. The Campbell and Sherman
 mission, which arrived off Vera Cruz on November 29
 and left December 3, seems disposed to a peaceful solu-
 tion.  Nevertheless it gives moral support to the Juar-
 ists through the statement of the Federal government.
 Marshal Bazaine and General Castelnau 24
 As December wore on, rumblings from Capitol Hill indicated
 that Congress - the same Congress that was even then mov-
 ing to impeach President Johnson - might attempt to take
 the management of the entire affair out of the Administration's
 hands. Word arrived from Bigelow that transports to bring the
 army home were ready to sail from French ports, but that
 information would by no means be convincing enough to reas-
 sure Washington.  And that word was the last to be heard
 from Bigelow, as competent a reporter as he was a diplomatist.
 He was relieved as Minister by John Adams Dix, ex-senator, ex-
 general, who did not manage to turn his hand to report-writing
 until mid-February, after the crisis was past.25
 Similarly, nothing that would clarify the situation was com-
 ing out of Mexico.  General Grant received a report from Sher-
 man, at Vera Cruz, containing two items of intelligence, highly
 significant and completely contradictory: two ships, waiting
 at Vera Cruz to take Maximilian home, had been loaded with
 tremendous quantities of royal baggage; and the Emperor had
 just issued a proclamation to the Mexican people announcing

 there and asking instructions concerning the evacuation of the
 European forces.  The French clear-text version, as repeated
 by General Castelnau in a letter to Napoleon on December 8,
 1866 (and quoted by Castelnau's biographer), reads:

 his intention to remain.  Sherman and Campbell were facng
 a dilemma, in that they could not reach Juarez without cross-

 supposed to have nothing to do. Sherman invited Grant to
 instruct him to go to Mexico City to see Bazaine, who, he was
 sure, would tell him the truth about French intentions, but
 nothing came of this suggestion. Wrote the general of the
 colorful pen and the fervid dislike of politics: "I am as anxious
 to find Juarez as Japhet was to find his father, that I may dis-
 pose of this mission." 26
 Tension mounted in Washington early in January as the
 Senate prepared for a debate on the Mexican question, and a
 wide variety of reports circulated, the most ominous being that
 half of the French forces were to remain in Mexico through the
 summer, and that Assistant Secretary of State Frederick W.
 Seward, who had sailed mysteriously from Annapolis on Christ-
 mas day, was on his way to see Napoleon.  (He was en route
 to the West Indies on one of his father's projects for the pur-
 chase of territory.) 27  But on January 12, before the Senate
 got around to the Mexican question, the War Department re-
 ceived a message from Sheridan at New Orleans transmitting
 the following telegram:
 French Consul New Orleans
 Paris Jany 10th
 for General Cast[elnau] at Mexico.
 Received your dispatch of the ninth December.  Do
 not compel the Emperor to abdicate, but do not delay
 the departure of the troops; bring back all those who
 will not remain there.  Most of the fleet has left.
 NAPOLEON.
 "Sherman to Grant, December 1 and 7, 1866.  Sherman, despite his
 reputation for hard-headedness, was not one of those who favored
 military action by the United States in Mexico.  He wrote Grant,
 "I feel as bitter as you do about this meddling of Napoleon, but we
 can bide our time and not punish ourselves by picking up a burden
 [the French] can't afford to carry."

 Seward's project, a very closely kept secret, was the acquisition of
