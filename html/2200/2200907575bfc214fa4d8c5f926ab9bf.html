 FRENCH URGE EARLY PREPARATION
 FOR EAST-WEST TALKS
 On the grounds that he
 needs every possible weapon to
 get the French Council of the
 Republic to approve the Paris
 agreements, Premier Faure on
 22 March handed the American
 charge and the British ambas-
 sador in Paris an aide-memoire
 calling for early convocation
 of a working group to prepare
 for talks with the USSR.
 Faure said he and Foreign
 Minister Pinay undertook a
 moral commitment to work for
 early East-West talks when
 they pressed for prompt and
 unconditional ratification of
 the accords.   Council approval
 is expected by 26 March.
 Many Frenchmen accept
 former premier Mendes-France's
 implied thesis that negotia-
 tions with the USSR after
 ratification can still stymie
 German rearmament.  Faure
 himself thinks that an agreed
 approach to the USSR should be
 made as soon as possible.
 Some Frenchmen are still
 -thinking in terms of a con-
 versions alike--will end up
 nowhere."
 Radio'Peiping on 20 March
 derided any American hope of a
 "quick victory" through the
 tactical use of nuclear weapons,
 and asserted that the United
 States did not in any case in-
 tend to "renounce weapons of
 mass destruction "
 ference in May as proposed by
 Mendes-France.
 A tripartite study group
 was originally suggested by
 Mendes-France but the proposal
 was sidetracked during the
 government crisis in February.
 Faure stated that he
 envisaged initially only a
 tripartite group, excluding
 West Germany.  Temporary ex-
 clusion from the working group
 would annoy the West Germans,
 but would probably be accepted
 by Chancellor Adenauer once
 the French have ratified the
 accords.  London's reaction
 to the proposal will depend on
 its acceptability to Bonn.
 German president Heuss
 signed the Paris accords on 24
 March, thus completing action
 by the Bonn government.
 Even if the court on 28
 March should agree to accept
 the Social Democratic petition,
 most legal observers agree that
 the case is so weak as to pre-
 sent no threat to the a"ords.

 VIETNAM SECTS SERVE
 "ULTIMATUM" ON DIEM
 Premier Diem's plan to
 deal with the Vietnamese
 sects by buying off certain
 commanders in the hope that
 the army can then deal with
 the remainder is facing a
 setback.  Those bought off
 do not always stay bought and
 the army is in no shape to
 play its role.
 The continuing intrigues
 of the sects are not likely
 to result in the fall of the
 government, but they are pre-
 venting it from getting on
 with the task of building the
 political and economic strength
 necessary to deal with the
 Viet Minh.
 The sects stepped up
 their political pressure with
 a joint "ultimatum" on 20
 March, calling on the govern-
 ment to reconstitute itself
 in an unspecified manner with-
 in five days.  Failing this,
 the signatories threatened to
 "appeal to the people."
 The ultimatum bore the
 signatures, among others, of
 the Cao Dai generals Phuong
 and The, who had not joined in
 an earlier antigovernment
 manifesto.  The wavering
 attitude toward the government
 of these individuals illus-
 trates the sort of difficulty
 Diem faces.
 In February, General The
 declared his loyalty to the
 government in a much-publicized
 ceremony in Saigon.   Since
 that time he has been the
 recipient of more than half
 the premier's confidential
 funds and has deployed his
 private army of some 2,000
 men in a manner designed to
 offset the influence of the
 Binh Xuyen forces which have
 remained hostile to the govern-
 ment,
 On 20 March, General The
 reopened the question of his
 loyalty to the government by
 signing the "ultimatum"--and
 Vietnamese army forces sta-
 tioned near Saigon suddenly
 found themselves uncomfortably
 sandwiched between forces of
 the Binh Xuyen and of General
 The.
 Meanwhile, Diem admits
 that army morale is low.  He
 attributes this to the arbi-
 trary dismissal of officers by
 the defense minister.  The
 latter has expressed his fear
 that Diem will insist on a
 tough line against the sects
 and made it clear that he has
 no stomach for a showdown
 fight against them.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 USSR Charges West Is Avoiding
 Big-Power Negotiations
 Prime Minister Churchill's
 disclosure of his correspond-
 ence with Molotov last summer
 and the State Department's
 publication of the Yalta.
 documents have been used by
 Moscow to argue that Britain
 and the United States are
 seeking to avoid great-power
 talks which might ease inter-
 national tension.
 This Soviet reaction
 suggests that the USSR is
 trying to establish the posi-
 tion that it will not be to
 blame if it refuses to nego-
 tiate on European issues after
 ratification of the Paris
 accords.
 The USSR probably con-
 sidersits negotiating posi-
 tion weak because of its
 basically uncompromising at-
 titude on the German and
 Austrian issues, which would
 be the major subjects of new
 four-power talks.   The Foreign
 Ministry delayed.for six
 months before agreeing to the
 Berlin conference of February
 1954.
 The present propaganda
 line--in the context of Soviet
 statements that ratification of
 the Paris accords would make
 negotiations pointless--indi-
 cates that a prolonged period
 of stalling will follow rati-
 fication of the accords.  At
 the same time, Moscow can be
 expected to dangle the possibil-
 ity of talks whenever this seems
 likely to interfere with im-
 plementation of German rearma-
 ment.
 Following Churchill's dis-
 closure of his exchange with
 Molotov, the Soviet govern-
 ment released the text of the
 correspondence.  Pravda pub-
 lished a sharp attack on
 Churchill which was in line
 with a recent hardening of the
 propaganda tone toward Britain.
 Churchill was not only
 blamed for abandoning his pro-
 posal that he and Molotov meet,
 but his whole public campaign
 for top-level talks was attacked
 as insincere and not aimed
 at lessening tension.  Accord-
 ing to Pravda, Churchill's
 various ca is for conferences
 were merely intended to strength-
 en Britain's bargaining po-
 sition in relation to the
 United States.
 Ambassador Bohlen has com-
 mented that the correspondence
 last summer shows that the  So--
 vie.t government, while desiring
 to exploit differences within
 the capitalist world, was
 not prepared to modify its pot-
 icy in order to take advantage
 of even such an outstanding
 opportunity as offered by
 Churchill's initiative.   In-
 stead, Moscow first answered
 the prime minister cautiously
 and then interjected the Euro-
 pean conference proposal while
 the correspondence was still
 in progress.
 American publication of
 the Yalta papers was attacked
 as part of Washington's cru-
 sade against the Yalta agree-
 ments designed to further
 American aggressive policy.
 The agreements were described
 as the foundation of postwar
 co-operation among the big
 powers.  Pravda claimed that
 the United States, by trying to
 discredit the Yalta agreements,
 was seeking to discredit the
 very idea of great-power talks.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Austria May Support Sanctions
 Against New Anschluss
 The Austrian government,
 in an effort to ascertain and
 meet Moscow's terms for a state
 treaty, is seemingly prepared
 to accept an arrangement which
 would call for automatic sanc-
 tions by the big powers in the
 event of another German-
 Austrian Anschluss.
 any West German attempt at an
 Anschluss would be blocked.
 Thus far, however, the
 Austrians have failed in
 their efforts to obtain clar-
 ification of Molotov's state-
 onent before the Supreme Soviet
 on 8 February that four-power
 "measures" to guarantee against
 another Anschluss would fa-
 cilitate the conclusion of.an
 Austrian treaty. Communist
 newspapers in Austria continue
 to insist that the provision
 against an Anschluss in the
 present draft treaty is only
 a "paper guarantee" and hence
 inadequate.
 The Austrians evidently
 believe that Molotov wants a
 four-power agreement that
 Chancellor Raab, in a
 radio address on 20 March, sug-
 gested that the four occupation
 powers guarantee Austria
 against "any possible" outside
 danger.
 The Austrians are clearly
 willing to make considerable
 concessions to Moscow to get
 rid of the occupation.  Actu-
 ally, however, they have faint
 hope of success and their pres-
 ent diplomacy,is aimed largely,
 at denying Moscow a cheap
 propaganda victory.
 No evidence exists that
 Moscow is really interested in
 an Austrian treaty.   The pur-
 pose of Molotov's statement
 on 8 February, and his diplo-
 macy since then, may be merely
 to delay implementation of
 the Paris treaties by getting
 the West involved in new
 Austrian negotiations.
 There is also a possi-
 bility that the USSR may in-
 tend to adopt a harsher policy
 in Austria in the near future,
 and that such a policy would
 be "justified" by blaming the
 an Anschluss.
 West for failure to reach
 agreement at this time on a
 treaty and guarantees against

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 March 1955
 Japan-USSR Talks
 Prime Minister Ichiro
 Hatoyama has tentatively se-
 lected Shunichi Matsumoto,
 former ambassador to Great
 Britain, to replace Arata
 Sugihara as head of the Japa-
 nese delegation in the, forth-
 coming Japan-USSR talks.
 The switch was necessi-
 tated by the eleventh-hour
 appointment of the nationalis-
 tic Sugihara as Defense Board
 chief following sustained and
 noisy opposition by the Social-
 ists to the prinle minister's
 first choice _f--r the defense
 post, former admiral Nomura.
 The designation of Matsu-
 moto, a career diplomat who
 resigned his post to run in
 Possible Disagreements on New
 Soviet Appointments
 Uncertainty or disagree-
 ment among Soviet leaders con-
 cerning ministerial appoint-
 ments is suggested by the
 apparent delay in announcing
 the appointment of N. A. Mik-
 hailov to succeed G. F. Aleksan-
 drov as USSR minister of cul-
 ture and by the continued va-
 cancy of the important post of
 USSR'minister of agriculture.
 Rumors of Aleksandrov's
 removal had been current in
 Moscow since 10 March.   His
 failure to appear at a recep-
 the 27 February lower house
 Diet election, probably repre-
 sents a compromise between
 Hatoyama and Foreign Minister
 Mamoru Shigemitsu.
 Matsumoto is reported to
 be on friendly terms with both
 Shigemitsu and Sugihara, the
 prime minister's personal for-
 eign policy adviser.  Matsumoto
 is likely to take a stronger
 bargaining position with the
 Russians than Sugihara.
 Meanwhile, Japanese offi-
 cials in Tokyo continue to mani-
 fest "nervousness" over Mos-
 cow's failure to ^.onfirm New
 York as thr' site for +ha no srn
 tiations.
 tion given by the Ministry of
 Culture on 13 March suggests
 that he was removed before that
 date, but no official announce-
 ment was made until 21 March.
 Difficulty in reaching
 agreement on the appointment of
 Mikhailov--who had been Soviet
 ambassador to Poland--may have
 caused the delay.
 Mikhailov,  like Aleksan-
 drov,  has long been considered
 a Malenkov protege. He waF elec-

 reduced in March 1953.   On the
 day after Stalin's death, he
 was named to the key post of
 Moscow oblast party first
 secretary, replacing Khr-o.-
 shchev.  At that time, Malen-
 kov was ranking party sec-
 retary, ranking member of the
 .party presidium, and chairman
 of the Council of Ministers.
 Mikhailov was appointed
 ambassador to Poland in March
 1954 following a trip to
 Warsaw, made with Khrushchev,
 as a member of a Soviet dele-
 gation to the Polish party
 congress.. It is possible
 that Khrushchev was responsible
 for Mikhailov's removal from
 the key Moscow secretaryship
 and transfer to Warsaw.   If
 that is the case, his return
 to Moscow suggests that
 Khrushchev is either willing
 to accept or unable to prevent
 the appointment to important
 posts of persons formerly
 associated with Malenkov.

 Receive New Medium Tank
 The re-equipment of Soviet
 units in Germany with a new
 medium tank, beginning in the
 autumn of 1954, probably fol-
 iows re-gquipment programs for
 units inside the USSR.   This
 tank, probably the T-54, seems

 gun developed in World War II.

 when I. A. Benediktov was
 transferred from that post to
 become USSR minister of state
 farms.   In the past, it has
 been usual to designate a
 successor simultaneously with
 the removal of a minister.
 The post may already have
 been filled, and the official
 announcement temporarily with-
 held.   It is also possible
 that the Agricultural Ministry
 is being reorganized, as
 recommended by Khrushchev at
 the January party plenum, and
 that appointment of a new
 minister has been delayed pend-
 ing completion bf the reorgan-
 ization.
 This post has pivotal
 significance in agricultural
 administration and is one with
 which Khrushchev would pre-
 sumably be especially concerned.
 Failure to fill the vacancy in
 the near future would tend to
 indicate conflicting purposes
 within the top leadership and,
 like Mikhailov's appointment,
 would suggest that Khrushchev's
 authority over important per-
 sonnel assignments is not un-
 limited.
 The USSR, conscious of its.
 leadership in tank design, has
 maintained close security over
 postwar developments in this
 field.
 When the new tank began to
 appear in Germany last autumn,
 nearly six years after the T-54
 began to be produced, little in-
 formation on its characteristics
 had been obtained.   It was never
 shown in parades and was not
 used during the Korean war.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 March 1955
 In general,  the new tank
 has a slightly lower, wider
 silhouette than its predeces-
 sor, a more rounded turret set
 closer down on the hull, and a.
 gun which is probably of higher
 velocity and larger caliber.
 Its diesel power plant has been
 improved somewhat, its armor
 undoubtedly has been strength-
 ened, and it may incorporate
 improved transmission, steering
 and gun-laying systems.
 Estimates of current So-
 viet medium tank production,
 based on fragmentary evidence,
 suggest a rate of between 3,700
 and 6,200 per year.   On this
 basis, the total number of
 T-54's produced through the end
 of last year would be between
 18,000-20,000 tanks and 28,000-
 35,000 tanks.
 These estimates seem high
 in comparison with the total
 of approximately 18,000 medium
 tanks authorized in the present
 tables of organization and
 equipment for the Soviet army's
 175 line divisions, but stock-
 piling may account for a large
 portion of T-54 production.
 The re-equipment of tank
 units in Germany probably fol-
 lows similar programs for units
 inside the USSR.   Despite a
 lack of positive identification,
 ,it is believed probable that
 substantial numbers of T-54's
 have been issued to units in
 key border areas from which
 Western observers are excluded.
 As early as 1951, Soviet
 personnel allegedly were told
 that new medium tanks were in
 standard issue, but only to
 units within the USSR.   The
 appearance of the T-54 in
 Germany may well indicate that

 Food Shortages and Unrest
 I n East Germany
 Recent reports indicate
 increased tension in various
 localities in East Germany.
 Some uneasiness has been
 noted among the construction
 workers of East Berlin, who
 are generally credited with set-
 ting off the riots of June 1953.
 It is probable, however,
 that resistance elements in East
 Germany are not well enough
 organized, and that the popular
 mood is too dispirited to bring
 about an uprising comparable
 with that of two years ago.
 The growing unrest is prob-
 ably due primarily to food
 shortages caused by poor sugar
 and grain crops in 1954,  the
 chronically inefficient dis-
 tribution system, faulty ad-
 ministration, and possibly a
 change in the food import pro-
 gram.  Food is scarcer now than
 during the same critical period
 last year, when an unusually
 severe winter had caused a
 serious supply situation.
 The shortages, which have
 been noted in basic as well as
 less essential categories of
 food, probably will become more
 serious during the next few
 months.
 Only an undertone of dis-
 content is evident at present.
 Under the pressure of the seri-
 ous                                                         food situation, however,
 scattered strikes and other
 overt expressions of opposi-
 tion to the regime may result
 from the government's plans to
 increase labor norms, its em-
 phasis on recruiting for para-
 military training, its stiffen-
 ing attitude against the churches,
 and its greater emphasis on
 heavy industry.
 There has been no substan-
 tial change in the uneasy peace
 in Berlin, where controls on the
 free movement of persons be-
 tween the East and West sectors,
 tightened during the Christmas
 holiday season, were relaxed on
 17 January.   Reports in January
 and February that West Berliners
 working in the East sector
 would be discharged within a
 short time have not been borne
 out.  The rate of discharge of
 these employees is not yet
 exceeding the normal turnover.
 The comparatively soft
 policy in Berlin may be dic-
 tated in part by fear that
 a harsher attitude might
 rouse an already disaffected
 populace to increased resist-
 ance.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Food Supply in Soviet Cities
 The American embassy in
 Moscow reports that food supply
 in the Soviet capital and in
 the major cities of the western
 Ukraine is showing no improve-
 ment over last year.
 As of mid-March, the
 situation in Some cities was
 somewhat worse than during the
 same period in 1954.
 The average citizen in
 these areas is thus faced with
 a daily diet which does nothing
 to convince him that, after
 18 months of major effort, the
 regime's programs to expand
 agricultural output have made
 any real progress.
 In the eastern Ukraine,
 lower Volga region and possibly
 other areas where droughts
 occurred during the 1954 grow-
 ing season, severe food short-
 ages may develop in April and
 May unless supplies are received
 from elsewhere.
 The total food supply
 available for consumption in
 the year ending 1 July 1955 in
 the USSR as a whole should be
 about 2 to 3 percent greater
 than in the preceding year,
 thus enabling the government to
 correct deficiences in drought-
 stricken areas without major
 sacrifices in other parts of
 the country.
 In Moscow state stores,
 food supplies this spring con-
 tinue substantially at last
 year's level, with the excep-
 tion of meat.
 the sup-
 ply of          as not been so
 short in nine years."
 The drive to double the
 number of livestock in the
 Soviet Union by 1960, which
 Khrushchev announced in
 January, may result in a
 temporary reduction in slaugh-
 tering so as to improve future
 supplies.
 Meat has always con-
 stituted a relatively small
 portion of the total Soviet
 diet, however, so that short-
 ages do not cause severe or un-
 accustomed hardships to the
 population.
 Bread? the staple of the
 Soviet diet, appears to be in
 good supply in Odessa and Kiev,
 and in sufficient though some-
 what scarce supply in Kishinev,
 the capital of the Moldavian SSR,
 Queues have frequently been ob-
 served in that city in front of
 stores selling bread.
 The meat supply in the
 state stores of all three
 cities has been very poor, but
 supplies on the free market
 are good and prices are about
 the same as last year.
 Considerable shortages of
 sugar are reported in the
 western Ukraine, as well as
 limited shortages in Moscow,
 probably because the produc-
 tion of sugar from beets in
 1954 was about 200,000 metric
 tons less than in 1953.
 Sugar shortages in the
 Soviet Union probably will be
 aggravated by a drop in imports
 from Eastern Europe this year,
 since bad weather caused poor
 sugar beet crops throughout
 the Satellites.   Imports last
 year from the Satellites
 amounted to over 450,000
 tons.
 In an apparent attempt
 to alleviate this impending
 shortage, the Soviet Union
 concluded a contract in
 February 1955 with Cuba for
 the import of about 200.000
 tons of sugar.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 North Korea's Food Problem
 A serious food shortage
 has forced the North Korean
 government to take extreme
 measures to increase produc-
 tion and to distribute food
 more equitably in 1955.
 The food shortage in urban
 areas was revealed in October
 when the regime abolished all
 private retail trade in grains
 to curtail widespread specula-
 tion.   The situation grew worse
 rather than better, however,
 and the government reinstated
 urban food rationing on 10
 March.
 Natural calamities and
 an  overzealous and unpopular
 collectivization program, ag-
 gravated by continuing short-
 ages of fertilizer, farm equip-
 ment and draft animals, com-
 bined to limit 1954 grain
 production to 86 percent of
 assigned quotas.
 Floods, severe cold
 weather and early frosts caused
 crop failures which impover-
 ished many farmers and forced
 the regime to waive defaulted
 taxes and loan repayments.
 Pyongyang has also had to
 release 100,000 tons of state-
 held grain to farmers, an
 amount equivalent to the grain
 sent as aid from Communist
 China during 1954.
 Japan-Orbit Trade Relations
 The impending visit of a
 39-man Chinese Communist trade
 mission to Japan will provide
 Peiping with many propaganda
 opportunities.
 The Japanese government
 has limited the places the mis-
 sion may visit to Tokyo, Nagoya,
 Food production failures
 are apparently in hart attrib-
 utable to ar. overemphasis. on
 collective farming.   Pyongyang
 announced in January of this
 year that almost one third of
 all farmers had been drawn into
 co-operatives.   The number of
 such enterprises has increased
 from about 100 at the time of
 the armistice to more than
 10,000.
 This hasty collectiviza-
 tion program is reported to
 have aroused much antagonism,
 but it continues despite Pyong-
 yang's admission that the
 nation's experience in co-
 operative management is
 insufficient.
 To prevent a shortage this
 year the regime is strenuously
 attempting to improve the pro-
 duction of foodstuffs.   The
 government offered on 2 March
 incentive payments of extra
 rations to those co-operatives
 which overfulfill their quotas
 in farming, livestock and fruit
 production.   North Korean
 propaganda has also stressed
 an increase in the fish catch.
 Increased food production
 would m?vn it nr ihle to de-
 vote more Orbit aid to re-
 habilitation and industrializ-
 ation.                Concurred in
 b y ORR
 and Osaka.   It is possible, how-
 ever, that Tokyo will rescind
 this limitation when the Chi-
 nese Communists reach Japan.
 There will probably be mounting
 demands by Japanese Communists,
 businessmen  and others, and by
 the Chinese that this be done.

 Reports indicate that the
 mission hopes to visit over 50
 factories in the Osaka-Kobe
 area alone.
 The Foreign Ministry has
 already bowed to a Chinese
 demand by allowing special en-
 trance permits to list the
 mission members as nationals
 of the People's Republic of
 China.
 Efforts by the government
 to form a representative and
 conservative Japanese group to
 negotiate the proposed unoffi-
 cial trade agreement with the
 Chinese mission have failed.
 The Japanese Chamber of Com-
 merce and other conservative
 groups have declined to partici-
 pate--because of the prominent
 role played by pro-Communist
 Diet members and trade pro-
 moters--and this may reduce
 the impact of the mission's

 of the Japanese Foreign Ministry
 that the purpose of the Chinese

 Court Decision Clears Way
 for Pakistan Reorganization
 The decision of the Paki-
 stani Federal Court on 21
 March confirming the legality
 of the present government
 clears the way for putting in-
 to effect Karachi's plans to
 reorganize the national and
 state governments and complete
 a new national constitution.
 Reversing a lower court's
 ruling, the judgment provides
 the governor general's ruling
 group with a legal mandate
 and has been warmly welcomed
 by the country's press.   it
 also eliminates a potential
 opportunity for the Communists
 to exploit American support of
 an "illegal" government.
 The unification of West
 Pakistan into a single province,
 for which Karachi has detailed
 plans, probably will progress
 smoothly.   There, appears to be
 no significant obstacle to the
 election of delegates to a new
 Constituent Assembly by the
 provincial legislatures in West
 Pakistan.   The arrest of some
 legislators in Sind, allegedly
 for plotting against the
 provincial government, may be
 designed to ensure the elec-
 tion of progovernment repre-
 sentatives.
 On the other hand, Karachi
 may be forced to delay the
 restoration of parliamentary
 government in East Pakistan
 unless it can resolve the
 split in the United Front
 Party there.   This would pre-
 sumably postpone the province's
 election of delegates to the
 Constituent Assembly, which in
 turn would prevent the speedy
 adoption of the new national
 constitution.
 Considering the general
 desire throughout Pakistan to
 re-establish the normal func-
 tioning of constitutional gov-
 ernment, however, any delay
 is likely to be  fairly short-
 Syria
 The Syrian government, in
 which pro-Egyptian,  leftist
 and neutralist elements pre-

 Egyptian-Saudi Arabian pact.
 Meanwhile, Egyptian prime
 minister Nasr told Ambassador
 Byroade that his country now
 is too committed to the pact
 to change its course, and his
 advisers believe that Syria
 "must be signed up quickly."
 Iraq, on   the other hand,
 exerted some influence on the
 Syrian delegation that visited
 Iraq last week to discuss the
 rival defense pacts,
 According to Iraqi offi-

 Baghdad somewhat "chastened"
 and inclined to temporize on
 the subject.
 Iraq's partner, Turkey,
 has made strong diplomatic
 representations to Syria in the
 hope of keeping it out of the
 Egyptian alignment.
 Under these conflicting
 pressures, the Asali cabinet
 may fall apart as a result of
 disagreement between Prime
 Minister Asali, who is inclined
 to temporize, and Foreign
 Minister Azm, who appears to
 favor signing the Egyptian pact,

 have not been seriously ham-

 are likely, however, and the
 unions of the outdoor workers,
 carpenters,  ironworkers,  and
 painters have already announced
 they will strike at midnight
 on 29 March.  There are no
 immediate shortages at the
 base, but an airlift of es-
 sential supplies has been re-
 quested.

 The workers are demanding
 wage increases of at least 25

 the employers' offer of about
 seven percent, and a work
 stoppage of between two and
 five weeks seems likely.
 The most probable economic
 consequence will be a resumption
 of the inflationary spiral
 which was arrested in late
 1952.   Politically, the strikes
 are a victory for the Communists,
 who, in co-operation with left-

 the Icelandic Federation of
 Labor.  The Communists are
 seeking to extend their control
 over the entire labor movement
 to use it eventually for
 political ends.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 March 1955
 West Germany it is serious;
 in France complicating factors
 like the Poujade movement
 leave the situation uncertain
 but threatening.
 For the most part the
 trouble stems from demands for
 increased wages,   to which
 governments and employers are
 opposed, largely because of
 the inflationary effect of
 granting such demands.
 Except in Finland the
 Communists are actively in-
 volved in the agitation in an
 effort to damage the Western
 European economy and promote
 political instability.
 The Icelandic Communists,
 who dominate the Icelandic
 Federation of Labor, are spear-
 heading a campaign for infla-
 tionary wage increases and have
 brought about a strike that
 threatens the port of Reykjavik
 with economic paralysis.
 In Finland the cabinet has
 threatened to resign if the six
 striking government workers'
 unions, representing some 25,000
 workers, do not accept the gov-
 ernment's  compromise offer on
 their wage demands.   While not
 directly involved in the strike,.
 Finnish Communist. would probably
 use the fall of the government to
 push their efforts to undermine
 the political stability of the
 country.
 The labor situation in
 Italy is worsening while the
 government makes only feeble
 efforts to cope with the problem
 of growing unemployment.
 The Sicilian sulphur mines,
 employing some 10,000 workers,
 were closed down on 20 March;
 serious political repercussions
 are in prospect in view of the
 imminence of the Sicilian elec-
 tions in early June.   The dis-
 missal of 1,500 Sardinian coal
 miners led to a 48-hour protest
 strike by both Communist and
 non-Communist miners.
 Unity of action between
 Communist and non-Communist
 elements was also displayed in
 Trieste on 15 March when a one-
 hour general strike was sup-
 ported by all labor organiza-
 tions and by an association of
 small businessmen   in protest
 against the continuing economic
 decline of the port.
 The strike in Genoa of the
 Communist-dominated port workers'
 union against new hiring regu-
 lations is now in its tenth
 week, with regular cargo-handl-
 ing                                                              operations interrupted by
 sporadic stevedore strikes.
 Communist control of the sea-
 men's union has been strength-
 ened in readiness for sympathy
 strikes in response to demands
 from the dock workers.
 Under pressure from the
 Italian Communist Party, the
 General Labor Confederation
 reportedly has agreed to start
 a series of "labor actions,"
 including general strikes, to
 continue without interruption
 during the next few months.
 In West Germany, dissatis-
 faction of workers with their
 share in the general prosperity
 is causing the unions to adopt
 a more militant program.
 The 600,000-member Ruhr
 coal miners' union voted on
 22 March to go out on strike
 unless its demands for a 12-per-
 cent wage increase are met.
 The powerful miners' union is
 prepared to wage a three-week
 strike, and is seeking financial
 and tactical support from the
 metalworkers' and railway un-
 ions, both of which engaged in
 a series of successful strikes
 last year for increased wages.

 The threatened mine--
 worker's strike will spur the
 Adenauer government to strong
 efforts at mediation,especially
 if it also ties up large seg-
 ments of West German industry
 and transportation.   Failure
 to win on the wage issue, how-
 ever, would cause the West
 German unions to lose ground
 to the Communists9who have
 been in the forefront of the
 wage agitation.
 In France, rising prices
 will make it difficult for the
 Faure government to meet the
 workers' wage demands at the
 scheduled April "rendezvous"
 with industry and labor with-
 out risking a new inflationary
 trend.   The government workers'
 strong protest at the inade-
 quacy of Faure's offer of a
 three-billion-franc increase
 in civil service pay has o-
 bliged the premier to announce
 that a rise in the minimum wage
 for government workers will
 also be considered at the
 April "rendezvous."
 Complicating Faure's
 task are the large budgetary
 deficit facing the government
 and the growing Poujade anti-
 tax movement, which is threat-
 ening to get out of hand and
 stampede the National Assembly
 into unwise tax legislation.
 Faure's problem is to re-
 form the tax system without
 reducing receipts, and any
 concessions to small business-
 men without adequate compen-
 sation to the workers is likely
 to spark an "antifascist"
 campaign among the unions to
 the detriment of the public.
 The approach of the can-
 tonal and senatorial elections
 in France further limits Faure's
 chances of maintaining a tight
 economic and financial policy
 and preserving industrial
 peace.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE; WEEKLY SUMMARY
 Guizado Trial May Cause
 The trial of former
 Panamanian president Guizado,
 which opened in the National
 Assembly on 21 March, is ex-
 pected to have widespread re-
 percussions in Panama, and may
 even lead to attempts to
 overthrow the government.
 Guiza,do is charged with
 complicity in the assassina-
 tion of President Remon on
 2 January.
 Prominent Panamanians,
 local businessmen, and diplomats
 have informed American officials
 in Panama of their belief that
 an acquittal of Guizado for
 complicity in the Remon mur-
 der case might completely
 discredit the government and
 could call for the prosecution
 of powerful persons not yet
 publicly ., implicated.  These
 persons might therefore antic-
 ipate such action by seizing
 the government.
 In early February,
 there were rumors that some
 highly placed Panamanians
 feared further revelations in
 the case and that many favored
 the establishment of a junta.
 At the moment, certain.
 forces in the government and
 the National Assembly appear
 determined to have Guizado
 found guilty by hook or by
 crook.  Their motive may be
 to conceal their association
 with narcotics traffickers
 who are widely believed to
 have been the real authors of
 Remon's assassination.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 SOVIET GROUND FORCES IN GERMANY MODERNIZING EQUIPMENT
 Soviet ground forces in
 Germany, which would bear the
 initial brunt of land oper-
 ations in the European area
 in the event of war, were
 re-equipped and modernized
 during 1954 to a greater ex-
 tent than in any other year
 since the end of World War II.
 The program, continuing in
 1955, is producing a sub-
 stantial improvement in the
 mobility and firepower of
 these forces.
 The re-equipment was high-
 lighted by the arrival in
 Germany, beginning in the
 autumn of 1954, of over 200
 medium tanks of an improved
 model.   (For a discussion of
 this tank, see Part II.)
 Four of the eight tank divi-
 sions in the Group of Soviet
 Forces in Germany had prob-
 ably each received about 50
 of the new tanks by the end
 of February 1955, while a
 fifth may have received an
 initial consignment of 10
 during February.
 The new tank probably is
 the T-54, which first went
 into production in 1949.   It
 is evidently being used to
 replace the T-34, rather
 than as an additional element
 of divisional equipment.
 The Soviet forces in
 Germany are estimated to have
 nearly 4,000 tanks of the
 T-34/85 model.  Whether they
 will all be replaced quickly
 or in a single program has
 not yet been determined.
 The eight tank divisions,
 which are authorized 210 me-
 dium tanks each, may rapidly re-
 ceive their full authorization,
 of the new model, while the
 ten mechanized divisions and
 four rifle divisions  (author-
 ized respectively 185 and
 52 each) may continue to
 operate for some time with
 the older model.
 Soviet forces in Germany
 are known to have received
 during 1954 a total of 637
 tanks of all types, about
 1,500 light armored vehicles,
 and about 1,800 artillery
 pieces.   Relatively few items
 in any of these categories
 were noted being shipped out
 of East Germany during the
 same period.
 More than 20,000 new
 military trucks also were re-
 ceived last. year, while only
 6,800 of the 50,000-60,000
 trucks previously assigned to
 the Soviet forces in Germany
 are known to have been shipped
 back to the USSR.
 New trucks have now al-
 most completely replaced Lend-
 Lease and old Soviet trucks,
 many of which probably were
 cannibalized or otherwise dis-
 posed of locally.
 Other significant arrivals
 during the year include new
 semiautomatic rifles,replacing
 bolt-action models, a few
 helicopters, new full-tracked
 amphibious vehicles, wheeled
 amphibians ,and heavy-duty
 bridging equipment.
 Distribution of new equip-
 ment to units in Germany has
 been widespread, and there are
 no indications of stockpiling.
 some equipment is being used
 to implement changes in the
 organization of mechanized and
 artillery elements of tank
 and mechanized divisions.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 March 1955
 The effect of the re-
 equipment will be a significant
 increase in mobility and fire-
 power of Soviet ground divisions
 deployed in Germany.
 The re-equipment program
 indicates that the USSR is
 continuing to devote consider-
 able attention to strengthen-
 ing the capabilities of
 ground forces, at least
 this key area.

 USSR MODIFIES FOREIGN TRADE POLICY
 The volume of over-all
 Soviet trade with the West, es-
 pecially with Western Europe,
 will be lower in 1955 than in
 1954 as a result of a modifica-
 tion in the USSR's foreign
 trade policy.
 Within this reduced volume,
 the USSR can be expected to im-
 port a smaller proportion of

 consumers' goods and a larger
 proportion of goods needed for
 industrial development--
 machinery, electric and elec-
 tronic equipment, nonferrous
 metals and merchant ships.
 Soviet trade with the West
 rose, sharply from mid-1953 to
 mid-1954, primarily as a result
 of a dramatic rise in Soviet
 imports under the "new course."
 Difficulties in marketing ex-
 ports in the West, however,
 limited Moscow's ability to
 finance the expanded imports.
 In spite of unusually
 large gold sales by the USSR
 in late 1953 and early 1954,
 the trade imbalance continued
 to grow worse.   In the last
 half of 1954, this trend neces-
 sitated ,a marked decrease in
 Soviet imports, especially of
 consumers' goods, from the West.
 Since Late December, Soviet
 policy makers--in keeping with
 their renewed emphasis on the
 expansion of heavy industry
 inside the USSR--have determined
 on a further cutback in imports
 of consumers' goods both from
 Western Europe and the European
 Satellites.
 In trade negotiations
 with Western European countries,
 Soviet officials now are likely
 to be less amenable, to talk
 less about "trade for trade's
 sake," to haggle more and bar-
 gain harder, and to infuse

 trade discussions with more
 political propaganda.   They
 will also continue to use
 trade offers to reinforce
 political and diplomatic
 efforts to divide the West-
 ern coalition.
 Soviet commercial repre-
 sentatives have attempted, for
 example, to exert political
 pressure by claiming that
 recent reductions in imports
 are a direct result of Western
 plans to rearm Germany,  and
 have threatened some Western
 business firms with a cessa-
 tion of Soviet orders if the
 Paris accords are ratified.
 The USSR will probably
 also continue its efforts to
 split the West on the issue
 of COCOM and Battle Act ex-
 port controls.   Bloc countries
 intend to keep on with large-
 scale imports of some com-
 modities on which controls
 were relaxed last August, and
 Communist importing officials
 undoubtedly will cite these
 cases to individual Western
 firms as examples of the in-
 creased trade that would be-
 come possible if controls
 were further reduced.
 The USSR is putting es-
 pecially heavy pressure on
 Japan for a lower level of
 controls, capitalizing on
 the desire of Japanese busi-
 ness firms and the government
 for a rapid expansion of trade
 with China and, to a less ex-
 tent, with the other bloc
 nations.
 Both the USSR and the
 European Satellites are push-
 ing ahead with their program
 of using trade and economic aid
 to increase their political
 influence in the underdeveloped
 non-Communist countries of the
 Middle East,  South Asia and
 Latin America.   There is evi-
 dence, both in the statements
 of Soviet and Satellite offi-
 cials and reports of specific
 negotiations,  that there will
 be a gradual increase during
 the next few years in the
 volume of Soviet capital
 goods offered in exchange
 for raw materials and agri-
 cultural products.
 Additional offers of
 technical aid for the build-
 ing of industrial plants in
 some of these countries
 probably will be made, but
 the number of such projects
 actually undertaken is likely
 to increase slowly and the
 total cost to the Soviet bloc
 will remain small.
 Soviet propaganda, cap-
 italizing heavily on such
 projects as are actually
 under way, is likely to focus
 in general terms
 on claims
 that the
 bloc is
 willing and
 able to provide
 such assist-
 ance on a
 major scale.
 The
 USSR and the East
 European
 Satellites plan
 to
 continue
 to stage lavish
 ex-
 hibitions
 at industrial
 trade
 fairs in
 a large number
 of
 non-Communist countries,
 stressing the high level of
 technical advancement and
 industrial progress achieved
 under the Communist system.
 Inside the Soviet bloc,
 announcements of 1955 trade
 agreements indicate that
 Soviet trade with the European
 Satellites will not increase
 as it has in previous years.
 Attention apparently is being
 focused on exchanges of basic
 raw materials and capital
 goods,  and the volume of con-
 sumers, goods traded may well
 decline.
 To attain a higher de-
 gree of co-ordination, es-
 pecially in the output of the
 heavy industries and armaments
 industry, the European Satel-
 lites also intend to exchange
 industrial technicians, blue-
 prints, and technical know-
 how on a major scale and to
 co-operate in drawing up their

 individual economic plans for
 the five-year period beginning
 in 1956.
 .The USSR is also committed
 to provide substantial economic
 aid to China and North Korea,
 and the European Satellites
 are participating on an in-
 creasing scale in the con-
 struction of industrial plants
 in those countries.  Agree-
 ments for 1955 call for a fur-
 ther expansion of Soviet trade
 with China and a 25-percent
 rise in trade with North Korea.
 The Soviet Union has been
 behind schedule in supplying
 economic assistance to North
 Korea, but most of the Satel-
 lites have signed economic aid
 agreements with Pyongyang for
 1955 calling for increased
 deliveries of capital equipment.
 China is the only country
 in the Sino-Soviet bloc that
 has as yet concluded formal
 trade and aid agreements with
 the Viet Minh, although East
 Germany and the Viet Minh
 are reported to have signed
 an interim trade agreement
 covering the period 1 October
 1954 to 1 March 1955.
 Trade and aid agreements
 are likely to be signed by
 other European Satellites and
 the USSR in the near future.

 The Chinese Communist
 leadership has been tightening
 its control over the party at
 the same time the party has
 been tightening its control
 over China.   Both appear to be
 in unprecedentedly strong
 positions.
 The party has been engaged
 since 1951 in a quiet but
 thorough purge--officially
 designated a "reorganization"?
 which has removed about one in
 ten of those who were party
 members in 1951.
 For the past year the
 party's central committee has
 apparently emphasized a drive
 for "unity" among the committee
 members.   This "unity" drive
 has evidently been conducted
 under the continuing leader-
 ship of Mao Tse-tung, Liu
 Shao-chi and Chou En-lai, who
 have been ranked in that order
 as the "big three" in party
 pronouncements for several
 years.
 The leading victims of
 the drive appear to have been
 Kao Kang, a politburo member
 previously publicized. as one
 of the top five, and Jao Shu-
 shih, chief of the party's
 organization department.
 Both were apparently punished
 in part for trying to build
 "independent kingdoms" as re-
 gional leaders.   In addition,
 Kao may have openly opposed
 the party's economic policy
 and Jao may have made unwise
 appointments.
 Continuation of the "unity"
 drive at the central committee
 level was probably a factor in
 postponing the party's confer-
 ence, which had been scheduled
 for 1954.   Such a conference,
 last held in 1951, is a kind
 of vocal outlet for the central
 committee and can replace up
 to 14 of its members, whereas
 a party congress, last held in
 1945, has the function of elect-
 ing the entire central committee
 which, at present, has 70
 members.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 March 1955
 The next party conference
 is expected during 1955.   It
 will probably announce the end
 of the "reorganization," for-
 malize the rise to power of
 several new leaders, and remove
 any erring members of the
 central committee who have not
 been "rehabilitated."   In line
 with Mao's policy of "treating
 the sickness" rather than
 staging a spectacle such as
 the Soviet purges of the
 1930's, the number of those
 "unreconstructed" is ex-
 pected to be small.
 The party conference is
 expected to emphasize party
 unity in the regime's "prog-
 ress  toward socialism."   It
 seems likely also to call for
 improvements in recruiting
 and training the rural member-
 ship and in the related task
 of consolidating agricultural
 producer co-operatives--a
 transitional step to collec-
 tivization.  All of these
 goals will probably be related
 to the objective of "liberating"
 all Nationalist-held territory.
 Party control has been
 pervading all phases of Chi-
 nese life.  The new govern-
 ment set up last fall under
 China's first constitution
 has approximately doubled its
 top-level personnel, and most
 of these new bureaucrats are
 experienced party men.
 Communist Party members
 now exercise complete control
 of all key organs and minis-
 tries.   Where changes in high-
 ranking personnel have occurred,
 party members have replaced
 non-Communist officials.   Non-
 Communists allowed to retain
 nominal leadership,of a minis-
 try or commission have been
 surrounded by an increased
 number of deputies, most of
 whom are Communists.
 Direct central control
 over provincial party com-
 mittees is being established
 by the abolition of regional
 party bureaus, which in the
 Soviet Union remain impor-
 tant links between the center
 and local units.   The North
 China and Central-South bureaus
 are known to have been elim-
 inated, and there are good
 indications that others have
 been abolished or are soon
 to be.
 Recent elections reveal
 the party's open control of the
 united front at the provincial
 level.   In most cases the
 elected chairman of the united
 front body is also the party
 secretary in the province.
 Peiping's authority in
 the provincial governments was
 increased considerably by the
 new constitution.   Following
 the decision in June 1954 to
 abolish regional governments,
 the constitution provided for
 provincial governments to come
 under the direction of Premier
 Chou En-lai's State Council.
 The State Council has an ad-
 ditional check through its con-
 stitutional responsibility to
 nominate heads and deputy heads
 of departments of provincial
 governments.  .
 Considerable progress has
 been made in the past year in
 tightening party control of
 the armed forces.   Changes in
 September 1954 brought military
 affairs for the first time
 into the administrative area
 of the government, and all
 elements of. the armed forces
 now seem to be subordinate ;;o
 the State Council.  At the
 same time the power of regional
 military leaders--who have
 long seemed to be the only
 potential leaders of organized
 resistance movements in Com-
 munist China--has been steadily
 reduced.
 Finally, three regulations
 enacted in recent months have
 brought party control even
 closer to the man in the street.

 These regulations govern
 the organization of city

 committees and public security
 substations.   These typical

 have existed in varying de-
 grees in China since the
 Peiping regime was established,
 have now been standardized to
 provide a thorough check on
 every family.
 DRIVE TOWARD FREER TRADE AND CONVERTIBILITY IN WESTERN EUROPE
 Final action by most West-
 ern European countries to elim-
 inate restrictions on dollar
 imports and to make their cur-
 rencies freely exchangeable
 for dollars may be delayed in-
 definitely should current
 symptoms of incipient infla-
 tion in several of these
 countries become acute and
 general.
 In the meantime the
 better economic outlook in the
 United States and proposed
 American trade liberalization
 measures are furthering prog-
 ress toward convertibility.
 Because approximately 40
 percent of world trade is
 transacted in sterling, it is

 pound must lead the way to
 convertibility.   Britain has
 steadily removed restrictions
 on the use of sterling over
 the last two years, but timing
 of the final step to freely

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 March 1955
 European Economic Co-operation
 (OEEC) in 1948 set a goal of
 removing quotas on 50 percent
 of intra-European imports..
 This goal was raised to 60 per-
 cent in mid-1950, and a target
 of 75 percent was set for 1
 February 1951.   Despite numer-
 ous setbacks for individual
 countries, a general level of
 75-percent liberalization was
 slightly surpassed by early
 1954 except in France, which
 then lagged at 18 percent.
 With internal and ex-
 ternal economic conditions much
 improved in 1954 and with the
 use of a compensating tax,
 France advanced to 65-percent
 liberalization last November
 and to an experimental 75
 percent in January.  Announce-
 ment that France would commit
 itself officially to attain
 the general level of 75-percent
 liberalization by 1 April was
 one of the main factors that
 made it possible in January
 for the OEEC to raise trade
 liberalization goals to 90
 percent for September 1955.
 In order to accelerate
 preparation for dollar conver-
 tibility, the OEEC ministers
 agreed in January that their
 countries would periodically
 submit their records on the
 removal of quotas on dollar
 imports. for review by the OEEC,
 with the implication that each
 would be called on to justify
 any ,delays..  It was also ar-
 ranged that the trade policies
 of the United States and Cana-
 da would be reviewed from time
 to time in the OEEC for their
 progress toward liberalization.
 The ministers also took
 steps to arrange continuance
 of the OEEC's European Payments
 Union (EPU) for one year, and
 a $600,000,000 fund was planned
 to provide credit to support
 the currencies of countries
 that may require it when the
 currencies of most other coun-
 ties become convertible and
 the EPU automatically goes out
 of existence.
 The OEEC ministerial ex-
 amination group on convertibil-
 ity,                                                          in January deferred
 further recommendations for
 steps toward full convertibil-
 ity,  pending the review of the
 General Agreement on Tariffs
 and Trade  (GATT)  then in prog-
 ress.  Little advance was
 made at the GATT meeting to-
 ward freeing trade, largely
 because of American insistence
 on continued use of agricul-
 tural import quotas.
 The earliest target date
 for full convertibility appears
 to be some time after October
 1955.  The British govern-
 ment is unwilling to consider
 full convertibility before
 the general election which is
 expected at about that time.
 The outstanding improve-
 ment in Western Europe's eco-
 nomic situation between mid-
 1953 and the fourth quarter of
 1954 makes convertibility
 shortly after the British
 elections possible.
 Industrial production rose
 12 percent in this period and
 gold and dollar reserves in-
 creased by $2.6 billion to
 $13 billion, contributing
 greatly to the reduction of
 quantitative restrictions on
 dollar imports, an important
 step toward convertibility.
 By the end of 1954 these re-
 strictions had been removed
 from 48 percent of Western
 Europe's dollar imports, com-
 pared with 13 percent at the
 beginning of 1954.
 It was possible for this
 expansion in Western Europe's
 economy to take place with
 comparatively stable price
 levels, despite relaxation of
 controls and increases in
 money and credit supply, be-
 cause the increased output
 came from previously unused
 capacity.
 Since the third quarter
 of 1954, however, it has be-
 come increasingly apparent in

 able resources, particularly
 of manpower, have reached or
 are approaching full employ-
 ment.   Accordingly, governments
 have taken or prepared to take
 steps to limit internal de-
 mand in order to counter
 inflationary trends.
 This development has been
 accompanied by some deteriora-
 tion in balance of payments
 positions.  All of the Scandi-
 navian countries have already
 taken or prepared to take
 measures to restrict credit.
 Even in the Netherlands,
 where the balance of payments
 remains strongly in surplus,
 the authorities have reduced
 liquidity of commercial banks
 as a precaution.   Although
 economic improvement continues
 in France and price rises have
 been moderate thus far,
 Premier Faure has warned that
 potential inflation is the
 greatest threat to the economy.
 Most important for the
 future of convertibility,
 some inflation has appeared
 in Britain.   That country's

 COFFEE PROSPECTS CAUSE CONCERN IN LATIN AMERICA
 The prospect of a new
 decline in the coffee market
 is causing considerable con-

 countries where coffee is a

 Another serious drop in

 are already about 40 percent
 below the 1954 peak, would
 bring on financial crises in
 some of the countries and
 probably lead to new expres-
 sions of anti-American senti-
 ment.
 Coffee production is
 expected to exceed consumption
 by a significant margin for
 the next several years, largely
 because of an estimated 12 to
 14 percent drop in consumption
 in the United States in 1954
 and a sharp increase in new
 plantings in recent years.
 The Latin American coun-
 tries principally concerned
 are Brazil--which alone sup-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 24 March 1955
 Under a recommendation
 passed at the Inter-American
 Economic Conference at Rio de
 Janeiro last November, an ad
 hoc coffee canmittee has been
 appointed and is now preparing
 a report on coffee prospects
 for the next several years.
 This committee is to prepare
 proposals, if such action is
 deemed feasible, for inter-
 national co-operation to re-
 duce fluctuations in coffee
 prices.
 Puerto Rico, meanwhile,
 has proposed that the Federa-
 tion of Mexican, Central Ameri-
 can and Caribbean producers
 (Fedecame) invite the South
 American producers to discuss
 the coffee problem at Puerto
 Rico next month.
 A likely subject would be
 the Guatemalan proposal for a
 conference of all Latin Ameri-
 can coffee-producing countries
 in Washington under the auspices
 of Fedecame, which is now sound-
 ing out the governments con-
 cerned.
 It is doubtful that these
 efforts to stabilize coffee
 prices will be more than par-
 tially successful.  The de-
 pletion in recent years of
 stocks both in the major con-
 suming country, the United
 States, and in the producing
 countries is a favorable factor.
 However, the attempt, difficult
 in any case because of the
 number of producers involved,
 is complicated by the facts
 that (a) the African producers,
 who supply about 15 percent of
 world production, are not in-
 cluded, and (b) Brazil, which
 because of its output is the
 key to any coffee stabilization
 plan, is in an extraordinarily
 weak financial position and may
 be unable to withstand buyer
 pressure for lower prices.
 A continuation of present
 price trends would have inter-
 national political as well as
 economic repercussions.  Many
 Latin Americans would probably
 renew their charge that Ameri-
 can governmental allegations of
 sharp practices in coffee mar-
 kets were important in causing
 the 1954 drop in American con-
 sumption.   Meanwhile, any Orbit
 contracts for coffee, such as
 the East German-Colombian barter
 agreement concluded last month,
 would receive extremely favor-
 able publicity even if the pur-
 chases were negligible in terms
 of world supply.
