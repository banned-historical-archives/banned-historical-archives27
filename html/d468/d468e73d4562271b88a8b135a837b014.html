 Andropov's First Year     Perspective: Andropov's Political and Policy Momentum
 Since becoming General Secretary last November, Yuriy Andropov
 has accumulated more power than any of his predecessors at
 comparable points in their tenure. Despite his personal political
 gains over the year, however, there has been little momentum in the
 policy sphere, and no additions to the voting ranks of the Politburo
 have been made since November. Continuity has been the main
 theme of the Andropov tenure thus far in both domestic and foreign
 affairs. In both spheres there has been some momentum that could
 presage change in the days ahead. Time, however, is Andropov's
 main enemy. His age (69) and poor health are not likely to allow him
 a lengthy tenure, and the regime is ill prepared for a new succession
 now.
 Andropov on Top: An Assessment of His Authority and Power
 Andropov has clearly emerged from his first year in office as the
 Politburo's preeminent member and the Soviet Union's major
 spokesman on a broad range of issues. At the same time he needs to
 exploit the opportunities provided at upcoming plenums to add
 clients or remove rivals in the Politburo and build support within the
 Central Committee to push through his proposals for changes in
 managing the economy.

 Andropov's Foreign Policy Performances
 General Secretary Andropov's immediate assertion of a leading role
 in foreign policy and the self-confident rhetoric of the leadership on
 international issues suggested a potential dynamism in Soviet policy
 that was not present in Brezhnev's final days. Nevertheless, the past
 year has witnessed a substantive approach to external issues that is
 similar to Brezhnev's and-more surprisingly-very limited person-
 al involvement by Andropov in comparison with even Brezhnev's
 final months. Poor health alone cannot explain the fact that he has
 traveled only once outside the USSR, held few meetings with
 foreign leaders since Brezhnev's funeral, and rarely commented on a
 series of important regional issues.
 The consumer welfare policies and approaches espoused by Andro-
 pov to date are not likely to be wellsprings of long-term, significant
 benefits for Soviet consumers. Andropov has been careful not to
 raise consumer expectations, playing down the material aspects of
 consumption and stressing instead the role of socialist values and
 popular commitment to the system as determinants of the overall
 "quality of life."
 Problems and Prospects of a New Succession
 Andropov's advanced age and uncertain health suggest the possibili-
 ty of a new succession at any time, but the regime is not well
 prepared for a transfer of power.

 The decisionmaking apparatus inherited from Brezhnev has under-
 gone relatively minor alterations, although the prominence of both
 Foreign Minister Gromyko and Defense Minister Ustinov has
 increased. Andropov has less need for extensive staff support, given
 his considerable experience in foreign affairs before becoming
 General Secretary, and thus far only three men have been publicly
 identified as his foreign policy aides. A second group of influential
 men around Andropov is made up of informal advisers and speech-
 writers who have long-term links to the General Secretary.

 Andropov's First Year
 Perspective: Andropov's Political
 and Policy Momentum                                   25X1
 Since becoming General Secretary last November, Yuriy Andropov has
 accumulated more power than any of his predecessors at comparable points
 in their tenure. From the outset he projected the image of a sober, "take
 charge" leader. Many Soviet officials even seemed to be upbeat about his
 prospects, and they had high expectations that he would quickly provide
 forceful and effective rule. Despite his personal political gains over the
 year, however, there has been little momentum in the policy sphere, and no
 additions to the voting ranks of the Politburo have been made since last
 November. The slow pace of Andropov's policy initiatives probably stems
 from expectations that were unrealistic, his innate caution in pressing for
 major changes, political opposition and bureaucratic resistance to change,
 and his uncertain health. (See the lead article in this issue for an
 assessment of Andropov's first year in political terms.)
 Andropov appears to be looking first to the appointment of new cadres
 before embarking on new policies. Indeed, some personnel appointments
 made by the new General Secretary (those of Geydar Aliyev, Grigoriy
 Romanov, and Nikolay Ryzhkov, for example) suggest a willingness to
 promote tough, no-nonsense politicians and technocrats to tackle the Soviet
 Union's problems. In the process, such former Brezhnev proteges as
 Nikolay Shchelokov and Sergey Medunov have been ousted, and players
 beholden to Andropov have replaced them. A new Central Committee
 Economics Department has been created.
 In the foreign policy arena it is doubtful that Andropov intended to make
 any significant departures from Brezhnev's policies (see "Andropov's
 Foreign Policy Performance"). As a Politburo member and KGB chief
 under Brezhnev, Andropov helped to shape the basic foreign policy strategy
 that continues under his own leadership. He has focused on arms control
 measures, assuming a major role in putting forth new Soviet proposals on

 INF, MBFR, and ASAT, and taking the propaganda offensive in response
 to the scheduled INF deployment. A failure to prevent INF deployment
 will test his policies toward the United States and Europe-areas that top
 his foreign policy agenda. On the other hand, bureaucratic lethargy may
 account for the lack of effective moves to improve relations with China or
 Japan. In sum, Andropov has reacted to foreign policy problems, but he has
 not set a bold new course)
 On domestic issues, Andropov has focused his attention on the need to
 revitalize the Soviet economy, attempting to "get the country moving
 again" after the lethargy of Brezhnev's last years. He is aware of the
 tensions that declining economic growth and inefficiency are generating in
 Soviet society, and he is convinced of the need to combine regime firmness
 toward the population with greater rewards for hard work. So far,
 Andropov has stressed making the current system work better. He has not
 introduced any major changes in Soviet economic mechanisms or resource
 allocation priorities. Although changes in both may be in the offing, they
 are likely to be evolutionary in nature and preceded by considerable debate
 and experimentation. Andropov recognizes that any program of change he
 proposes must contain elements that appeal to both reformist and conserva-
 tive interests within the regime
 Some of Andropov's economic decisions, such as tying monetary incentives
 more closely to performance and, on an experimental basis, giving
 managers more authority, have been favored by "reformers." Conservative
 elements in the party, on the other hand, probably approve of Andropov's
 administrative measures (the discipline and anticorruption campaigns) that
 have contributed to an upturn in productivity this year. In dealing with is-
 sues of consumer welfare, Andropov has openly attempted to dampen
 material expectations and sought to instill a more conscientious attitude
 among Soviet workers (see "Andropov and the Consumer").
 Time, however, is Andropov's main enemy. His age (69) and uncertain
 health are not likely to allow him a lengthy tenure. Vacation and illness, in
 fact, kept him out of action at least 12 continuous weeks this fall. If he is to
 be more than an interim leader, if he really intends to reshape Soviet policy
 for the future, he will have to push harder in the days ahead. In the foreign
 policy area, Soviet strategies will need to be revised, while on the home
 front economic stringency could force tough choices on resource allocation
 shifts. Andropov will have to act more boldly and decisively, even if this en-
 tails greater political and health risks.

 If Andropov does leave the scene soon, the regime would face a difficult
 choice in selecting his successor (see "Problems and Prospects of a New
 Succession"). Sickness, death, and the consequences of earlier political
 battles have so reduced leadership ranks that the regime is not well
 prepared for a succession. At present the other senior party secretaries
 appear to have the best chances of succeeding Andropov: Mikhail Gorba-
 chev, who is being promoted by Andropov; Grigoriy Romanov, whose age
 and experience give him a good shot at the top party job; and Konstantin
 Chernenko, who is still nominally number two in the party. However, there
 is no ideal succession candidate, no one has a lock on the post, and no one
 could be expected to emerge in as strong and authoritative a position as
 Andropov has in so short a time. Thus, a succession in the near term
 probably would make the Soviet leadership scene more uncertain, resulting
 in less room for maneuver both at home and abroad.

 Andropov on Top:
 An Assessment of His
 Authority and Power
 During Yuriy Andropov's first year in office, he
 clearly has emerged as the Politburo's most powerful
 member and the Soviet Union's major spokesman on a
 broad range of issues. The June party plenum and his
 elevation to the presidency further confirmed the
 General Secretary's political standing, adding consid-
 erably to his personal authority and political prestige.
 He does not have any strong political rivals, and his
 position appears secure. The domestic agenda, more-
 over, has become increasingly dominated by themes
 associated with Andropov, such as the anticorruption
 and labor discipline campaigns and proposals for
 change in managing the economy
 In spite of such accomplishments, Andropov's failure
 to significantly alter the political balance in the
 Politburo-either by promoting supporters or remov-
 ing opponents-coupled with his cautious approach in
 proposing new economic policies suggests that he has
 encountered some resistance. His age and uncertain
 health make it unlikely that he can successfully push
 through a comprehensive economic program unless he
 moves at the coming plenums to gain additional
 political support and power. Failure to do so, coupled
 with a lack of physical vigor, could result in his being
 perceived as an interim leader, one who would have
 difficulty generating support for Politburo changes or
 controversial economic initiatives. Moreover, Andro-
 pov needs to concentrate on building support within
 the Central Committee, bringing into its ranks a new
 generation of skilled managers and technocrats to
 follow his lead, implement his policies, and bolster his
 position. His ability to consolidate his power and place
 his stamp on the direction of Soviet policy thus will
 hinge on the personnel issue.
 Andropov's Progress in Consolidating Power
 All previous party leaders (Stalin, Khrushchev, and
 Brezhnev) consolidated their positions by expanding
 their influence in cadre selection and reshaping the
 top ruling bodies (Politburo and Secretariat) to ensure
 support for desired programs. In the post-Stalin era
 this process has depended less on intimidating the
 opposition than on building authority, demonstrating
 indispensability as a leader to various constituencies,
 and constructing policies that appeal to these constitu-
 encies.
 Andropov has made rapid progress in acquiring the
 authority conferred by the offices and titles (Presi-
 dent, Chairman of the Defense Council) that his
 predecessor took years to publicly acquire. His rival,
 Konstantin Chernenko, even referred to him as
 "head" of the Politburo at the June plenum-a
 plaudit Brezhnev did not receive until nine years after
 he became party leader. Nonetheless, it is not yet
 clear whether the General Secretary can translate his
 political standing into effective political power.F_
 The importance of personnel appointments in achiev-
 ing this latter goal is evident. From the beginning,
 Andropov has sought to convey an image of strong
 leadership that contrasts sharply with the perceived
 inertia of the late Brezhnev era. Numerous Soviet
 officials had privately criticized Brezhnev's unwilling-
 ness to remove incompetent or errant officials and
 repeatedly stated that under Andropov things would
 change.
 the discipline and anticorruption campaigns will be
 used to gain control of the party apparatus and bring
 in individuals more attuned to modern management
 methods and more supportive of Andropov's policy
 initiatives. Several Andropov consultants-most nota-
 bly Fedor Burlatskiy-have stressed that even modest
 reform goals must be preceded by a rejuvenation of
 art ranks, F
 Most recently, in
 discussions with US Embassy officials, maverick Sovi-
 et historian Roy Medvedev underscored the impor-
 tance of personnel changes, describing the placing of
 skilled individuals in the Soviet hierarchy as
 Andropov's paramount goal.

 Despite the chorus predicting extensive personnel
 changes, Andropov's use of this tactic to expand his
 political support in the leadership has been limited to
 date. The June party plenum did strengthen his
 position. The addition of Grigoriy Romanov to the
 Secretariat weakened the influence of Konstantin
 Chernenko. This move, when combined with the
 apparent alliance Andropov has formed with Mikhail
 Gorbachev, the party secretary reportedly responsible
 for personnel assignments, has substantially enhanced
 the General Secretary's influence over the
 Secretariat.
 At the same time Andropov has been less successful in
 creating a Politburo solidly behind him, despite the
 opportunities presented by a depletion of the leader-
 ship ranks. The full membership of the Politburo has
 not been altered since last November, and two pre-
 sumed Andropov clients who are potentially eligible
 for advancement-Yegor Ligachev, head of the Cen-
 tral Committee department which oversees cadre
 appointments, and party secretary Nikolay
 Ryzhkov-failed to move up. Reports persist of an
 anti-Andropov faction in the Politburo whose mem-
 bers are said to include Brezhnev loyalists Konstantin
 Chernenko, Premier Nikolay Tikhonov, and Kazakh
 party chief Dinmukhamed Kunayev.
 Andropov's caution in introducing new programs and
 reports of factionalism in the Politburo suggest that
 this opposition cannot easily be overcome.
 Andropov's
 ability to promote significant economic reforms has
 Andropov still lacks the Polit-
 buro support necessary to streamline the Soviet sys-
 tem and deal with problems of low productivity,
 absenteeism, and supply bottlenecks. While the extent
 to which Andropov wishes to carry economic "re-
 form" is still unclear, his speech to party veterans in
 August clearly places him on the side of innovation.
 Personnel Change-Picking Up the Pace?
 Recently there have been signs that Andropov has
 given particular attention to changes within the party
 apparatus, especially those slots traditionally confer-
 ring membership in the Central Committee. Since last
 November about two dozen Central Committee mem-
 bers have died or been retired. These vacancies pre-
 sumably have given Andropov the opportunity to fill
 them with new individuals that are more beholden to
 him. Two longtime Brezhnev associates-Georgiy
 Pavlov (chief of the Central Committee's Administra-
 tion of Affairs) and Sergey Trapeznikov (chief of the
 Science and Educational Institutions Department)
 have retired, giving the General Secretary another
 opportunity to install candidates of his own choice in
 the senior ranks of the Central Committee apparatus.
 Moreover, two new deputy ministers, Vasiliy Lezhe-
 pekov and Kirill Vostrikov, have been appointed to the
 Ministry of Internal Affairs MVD
 Andropov also intends to utilize the party elections
 now under way to increase his power by removing
 incompetent leaders. This process could be considera-
 bly facilitated by the presence of two Andropov
 allies-Yegor Ligachev, head of the Central Commit-
 tee department overseeing the elections, and Mikhail
 Gorbachev, the senior secretary responsible for cad-
 res. At the same time, this strategy must be judicious-
 ly applied. An extensive housecleaning could alienate
 the majority of local party officials, whose support is
 essential to successful implementation of Andropov's
 economic program.
 Although the "reporting and election" meetings are a
 normal part of the cadre renewal process mandated by
 CPSU statutes, those scheduled for late 1983-early
 1984 have been described as especially significant
 ocal party leaders will be judged
 by strict standards of accountability, an interpretation

 buttressed by an article in an August issue of Partiyn-
 aya Zhizn' (Party Life). In a September meeting with
 US Embassy officers, Richard Kosalopov, editor of
 Kommunist and a Central Committee member, aban-
 doned his usual reticence in discussing personnel
 matters and intimated that significant changes in
 lower- and middle-level party officials could be ex-
 pected.
 Perhaps to increase his opportunity to make further
 appointments, Andropov has also sought to convey a
 message to aging cadres that retirement is no dis-
 grace. Departing officials are now routinely thanked
 for their years of government service. In Pavlov's case,
 his retirement notice was preceded in the central press
 by the announcement of a ceremonial tribute to
 Brezhnev in the former general secretary's home-
 town. The timing of this tribute suggests that
 Andropov may be trying to reassure Brezhnev hold-
 overs that, although he wishes to install his own team,
 this need not be at the expense of Brezhnev's reputa-
 tion or those who were closest to him. Instead,
 Andropov will seek to persuade older cadres of the
 benefits of timely retirement. His address to party
 veterans in August, and their orchestrated response to
 his speech, in addition, seemed designed to convey the
 message that the older generation should step aside.
 The Struggle in the Politburo
 The ongoing election campaign, coupled with opportu-
 nities offered by the natural attrition in leadership
 ranks, could be exploited by Andropov to create a
 Central Committee presumably more in line with his
 policy preferences. According to Medvedev, major
 changes will occur among oblast first secretaries (the
 single-largest component in the Central Committee)
 as a result of the elections. These changes will then be
 ratified at an early party congress producing a new
 Central Committee. The Council of Ministers, the
 second-largest group represented in the Central Com-
 mittee, will also undergo wholesale changes, including
 the eventual replacement of its head, Premier
 Tikhonov.
 To effect extensive changes in the Central Commit-
 tee, Andropov would need strong backing in the
 Politburo. Although he does not now have a firm
 majority in that body, the next plenum and the one
 following in the spring will provide new opportunities
 to add clients or remove rivals. While there has been
 little in the way of political gossip concerning the
 upcoming plan and budget plenum, Andropov's posi-
 tion would be strengthened by the promotion of
 several officials who are thought to be members of
 what one Soviet has called the Andropov team and
 appear to be good candidates for advancement.          25X1
 Ligachev's appointment to the Secretariat and
 Ryzhkov's elevation as a candidate Politburo member
 would be a strong signal that the leadership balance is
 moving in Andropov's direction. The promotion of
 Vitaliy Vorotnikov, an Andropov client who as
 RSFSR Premier is currently enjoying favorable me-
 dia attention, or Mikhail Solomentsev, the party
 Control Committee chairman, as full members would
 help even more. Removing political opponents at this
 point would probably be more difficult but cannot be
 ruled out. Continued reports about Chernenko's ill
 health and Andropov's reported desire to make Gor-
 bachev the number-two man in the Secretariat sug-
 gest that Andropov's chief rival might be under
 increased pressure to retire.
 In any event, Andropov's alliance with Gorbachev and
 Ligachev should enable him to keep placing allies in
 key personnel slots. The success of his economic
 policies (he will seek to take credit for the rate of
 GNP growth this year), despite their limited applica-
 tion, could also increase his support among key con-
 stituencies. He almost certainly continues to enjoy the
 backing of Defense Minister Ustinov and Foreign
 Minister Gromyko and the institutional support of the
 KGB. Andropov's previous position as head of the
 KGB also may serve to inhibit any active opposition
 on the part of his rivals, who appear to lack a strong
 leader around whom to rally.
 He will need a good deal of political skill, nonetheless,
 to project the image of a dynamic leader confronting
 difficult policy choices without provoking opposition
 from those resistant to change. In addition, he must
 continue to maintain an image of physical vigor or
 risk being perceived as an interim leader. Such per-
 ceptions, if widely held, could make it difficult to

 generate support for Politburo changes or controver-
 sial economic initiatives. His continuing absence from
 the political scene will not help him in this regard.
 These problems suggest that the outcome of Andro-
 pov's efforts to tighten control over the party appara-
 tus and press forward with programs to improve the
 Soviet economy is by no means certain, although on
 balance it seems likely that he will make further
 progress in doing so.

 Andropov's Foreign
 Policy Performance
 The Brezhnev era represented the USSR's most suc-
 cessful period of international development, and Gen-
 eral Secretary Andropov's immediate assertion of a
 leading rule in foreign policy and the self-confident
 rhetoric of the leadership on international issues
 suggested a potential dynamism in Soviet policy that
 was not present in Brezhnev's final days. The im-
 proved leadership rankings at the outset of Andropov,
 Defense Minister Ustinov, and Foreign Minister Gro-
 myko-the key players in national security affairs
 during the Brezhnev era-also pointed to a significant
 consensus on foreign policy issues and the prospect of
 greater Soviet activity to enhance the USSR's inter-
 national position. Nevertheless, the past year has
 witnessed a substantive approach to the external
 issues that is similar to Brezhnev's and-more sur-
 prisingly-very limited personal involvement by
 Andropov in comparison with even Brezhnev's final
 months
 With the exception of arms control issues, Soviet
 foreign policy during Andropov's first year has been
 marked by few initiatives and little imagination. Poor
 health alone cannot explain the fact that he has only
 traveled once outside the USSR (and then to a
 Warsaw Pact meeting nearly one year ago), held few
 meetings with foreign leaders since the Brezhnev
 funeral, and rarely commented on a series of impor-
 tant regional issues. Andropov has been associated
 with no major initiatives on regional issues, and even
 with regard to Eastern Europe-an area of special
 expertise and experience-there are no indications of
 policy lines that are different from Brezhnev's.
 Andropov's need to concentrate on more pressing
 domestic issues as well as the intractability of many
 foreign policy problems apparently account, in part,
 for the meager results in foreign policy during his first
 year.
 Continuity in the Foreign Policy Team
 Before becoming General Secretary, Andropov had
 long experience and a political stake in issues related
 to foreign policy. He played a key role, along with
 Gromyko and Ustinov, in supporting Brezhnev's de-
 tente policy in the mid-1970s. It is, therefore, no
 surprise that he has continued the basic strategy he
 inherited from Brezhnev and retained Brezhnev's
 foreign policy team largely intact
 Andropov has had considerably more input in shaping
 Soviet foreign policy than Brezhnev did when he took
 power in 1964. Andropov already holds the three key
 national security policy positions-General Secretary,
 President, and Chairman of the State Defense Coun-
 cil. He still cannot change Soviet policy unilaterally,
 however, and must consult with his Politburo col-
 leagues-particularly the senior Moscow-based mem-
 bers involved in foreign policy issues-and broker
 changes with key institutional interests like the mili-
 tary. This limits his ability to make dramatic or rapid
 shifts.
 Arms Control
 Andropov has focused most of his attention on arms
 control issues, particularly INF. In doing so, he has
 strongly reaffirmed Moscow's commitment to arms
 control. He has not dramatically changed longstand-
 ing Soviet positions but has attempted to infuse new
 dynamism and vigor into the basic Soviet positions
 and has modified them in order to appear not to have
 lost the initiative to the United States. He has person-
 ally articulated all the key Soviet pronouncements on
 INF.

 25X1
 Scarcely a month after replacing Brezhnev, Andropov
 elaborated an offer, first broached on the eve of
 Brezhnev's death, to reduce Soviet IRBM launchers
 to a level equal to that of British and French interme-
 diate missiles. The move served to divert attention
 from the US "zero option" and to intensify pressure
 on Western governments to make concessions.           25X1
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/15: CIA-RDP84TO1083R000100110002-5
 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/15: CIA-RDP84T01083R000100110002-5
 Andropov also has acted as principal regime spokes-
 man for Soviet INF positions with the West Europe-
 ans and has attempted to ensure Warsaw Pact support
 for countermeasures in meetings with East German
 and Hungarian leaders.
 Andropov belatedly showed some concern for Western
 demands to limit Soviet SS-20s in Asia, but delays in
 articulating Moscow's position probably cost the Sovi-
 ets credibility at the talks and internationally. In
 January SPD leader Hans-Jochen Vogel went public
 with what he thought was a promise by Andropov to
 dismantle some SS-20s after an INF agreement rath-
 er than transfer them to the east. Moscow, however,
 failed to table such an offer until August, thus
 embarrassing Vogel-the Soviets' preferred candi-
 date-on the eve of the West German elections. F_
 Under pressure from the United States, China, and
 Japan, Andropov finally sought to reassure China and
 Japan by pledging in a 27 August interview to destroy
 any excess SS-20s if an agreement is achieved. He
 went on, however, to assert lamely that existing
 SS-20s were not meant for offensive use against them.
 Despite this concession the Soviet leader of the INF
 delegation maintained until mid-September that the
 proposal referred only to dismantling launchers and
 would not entail destroying missiles. Soviet officials
 had to correct this in a Moscow news conference
 which made clear that the offer included dismantling
 missiles as well as launchers.
 Andropov proclaimed on 27 October yet another
 "concession" by offering to reduce the number of
 SS-20 launchers in the western USSR to 140. The
 move presumably was intended to stimulate the flag-
 ging West European peace movement, but, in fact, it
 came as a disappointment to many West Europeans,
 who had expected larger reductions. The beginning of
 NATO INF deployments signals the failure of
 Andropov's major foreign policy effort since assuming
 office
 Andropov has also unveiled several other arms control
 proposals to regain the initiative after US proposals.
 In December he proposed a mutual nonaggression
 treaty between NATO and the Warsaw Pact. In late
 June, Moscow tabled new MBFR proposals including
 certain provisions for on-site inspections, thus answer-
 ing a major criticism of earlier Soviet proposals.
 During his meeting with US senators in August,
 Andropov offered to place a moratorium on the
 testing of Soviet antisatellite systems if the United
 States would refrain from testing similar weapons and
 called for a new treaty banning antisatellite and
 space-based weapons.
 relations.
 US-Soviet Relations
 Andropov's emphasis on arms control has led him to
 devote considerable attention to relations with the
 United States. He met Vice President Bush at Brezh-
 nev's funeral and hinted at a willingness to hold a
 summit meeting with President Reagan if tangible
 results could be achieved. These moves fit a strategy
 of appearing to take the high road in US-Soviet
 Meanwhile, Andropov waged an active campaign to
 influence US public opinion in the spring and sum-
 mer. It appears that he and his advisers at this point
 viewed the growing nuclear freeze sentiment as their
 best hope of pressuring the White House into arms
 control concessions. They may have calculated that
 the approach of the 1984 elections would encourage
 the President to moderate some of what they see as his
 "anti-Soviet" positions in order to improve his
 electoral prospects.
 By the end of the summer, it appeared that Andropov
 was signaling interest in lowering the level of confron-
 tation between Washington and Moscow. Moscow
 had compromised on the wording of the final CSCE
 document in Madrid and agreed to discuss upgrading
 the hotline after an initially skeptical reaction. The
 Soviets also kept their promise to allow the Pentecos-
 tals to emigrate. In late August President Reagan
 lifted some trade restrictions, and the United States
 and the Soviet Union signed a new long-term grain
 agreement. Andropov told West German Chancellor
 Kohl in July that he was willing to meet the President
 sometime before the spring of 1984.

 Secret
 The inept, ill-considered Soviet handling of the KAL
 shootdown has, nevertheless, raised questions in the
 West about Andropov's image as a sophisticated
 spokesman on foreign policy issues. Moscow consid-
 ered that the strong US response was politically
 motivated by anti-Soviet elements and answered US
 criticism with countercharges equating US actions
 with those of Nazi Germany. The Soviet defense was
 slow in developing, and it should have been apparent
 in Moscow that the eventual line-that the United
 States used the KAL flight to collect intelligence, in a
 deliberate provocation-was lame and bound to alien-
 ate the Western public. The shootdown made any
 summit meeting unlikely in the near term and severe-
 ly undercut Soviet efforts to appeal to the American
 public over the heads of the US leaders.
 Asian Policy
 On bilateral relations with China, Andropov has not
 advanced any new initiatives. While calling in broad
 terms for improved relations, he has relied more on
 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and party profession-
 als to do the spade work and has not authorized any
 major concessions on troop reductions or third-party
 issues (Afghanistan, Vietnamese occupation of Kam-
 puchea, or Soviet troops in Mongolia), which Beijing
 sees as crucial to a breakthrough. Moreover, an
 authoritative article in September indicated that no
 major change in Soviet positions was likely, suggest-
 ing that Andropov is still unwilling or unable to
 sanction major concessions that could bring about
 rapid results. Nevertheless, the Soviets have managed
 some improvement in economic and political relations
 without making any concessions to Chinese demands,
 which is perhaps all that could have been expected. F_
 Nor has Andropov initiated any major changes in the
 Soviet approach elsewhere in Asia. The emergence of
 Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone, who has taken a
 harder line on defense issues and the Northern Terri-
 tories, led to a downturn in Soviet-Japanese relations.
 Andropov in his August interview on Asian INF
 called for improved relations, but, as with other Soviet
 "peace" efforts, this has probably been undermined
 by the KAL shootdown.
 In Southeast Asia, Moscow has attempted to reassure
 Vietnam of continuing support despite efforts to im-
 prove relations with Beijing. Andropov met Vietnam-
 ese party leader Le Duan in July but has yet to meet
 Laotian or Kampuchean leaders, leaving these chores
 to Gromyko and Ustinov. In Afghanistan, Andropov
 has sanctioned some tactical adjustments, but earlier
 speculation in the West that Moscow might withdraw
 its troops has proved unfounded. The Soviet situation,
 in fact, has probably worsened in Afghanistan, where
 the Babrak government has failed to establish inter-
 national credibility and the insur ency has become
 more pervasive.
 Third World
 Andropov's first year has witnessed no gains in the
 Third World except for the Middle East, where last
 year's Israeli invasion of Lebanon provided opportuni-
 ties for preserving the critical relationship with Syria.
 Andropov, Gromyko, and Ustinov probably played
 leading roles in the initial decision in the summer of
 1982 to upgrade military support for Syria after its
 defeat at Israeli hands in Lebanon. The Soviets
 carried through on delivery and manning of the SA-5
 antiaircraft missiles despite the risks of becoming
 more deeply involved in Middle East hostilities. They
 have also delivered SS-21 tactical missiles to the
 Syrians-the first delivery of this weapon to non-
 Soviet forces.
 In the war between Iran and Iraq, Andropov has
 continued Moscow's tilt toward Baghdad. As a result,
 Soviet relations with Iran have deteriorated even
 further. Andropov avoided committing the USSR
 beyond rhetorical, political, and low-level military
 support to Libya's intervention in Chad. He has also
 maintained a low profile on fighting in Lebanon and
 has failed to provide more than rhetorical support to
 Arafat in his internecine struggle.
 Soviet client regimes in southern Africa face an
 increasingly serious security threat from insurgents
 backed by South Africa, and the Soviets have had to
 increase deliveries of more sophisticated military
 hardware to maintain the regimes in Angola and
 Mozambique. The deteriorating security situation has
 abetted Soviet efforts to impede US diplomatic moves
 aimed at reducing tensions between South Africa and
 its neighbors.

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/15: CIA-RDP84TO1083R000100110002-5
 In Central America, the Soviets appear to be more
 concerned about the possibility of increased friction
 with the United States. Andropov, perhaps as a result,
 has yet to meet any Cuban leader for extensive
 bilateral discussions. In his June Central Committee
 speech, Andropov suggested that the USSR is not
 willing to underwrite the economies of emerging
 "progressive" states like Nicaragua. Similarly, com-
 ments from Soviet officials avoid any hint that the
 USSR has made a military commitment to defend the
 Sandinista revolution.
 Prospects
 Soviet foreign policy continues to operate in an envi-
 ronment largely created by Brezhnev, but INF de-
 ployment in Western Europe will provide Andropov
 with a major test. Andropov's response to deployment
 will be the first genuine test of the creativity and
 effectiveness of his foreign policies, particularly to-
 ward the United States and key European countries.
 In the Third World, there have been no reversals, and
 he seems determined to carry on Moscow's longstand-
 ing opportunistic policy of exploiting political instabil-
 ity to expand Soviet influence. All indications so far,
 however, suggest that he remains cautious and will
 not overcommit the regime, particularly if such a step
 risks direct military confrontation with the United
 States. Andropov does not appear willing to use
 Moscow's increasingly strained resources to bankroll
 additional Third World clients.

 Andropov and
 the Consumer
 The Andropov regime appears to be taking a cautious
 approach on consumer issues. Without impinging on
 defense or industrial investment, it has little room for
 maneuver unless and until the Food Program pays
 some return and more resources can be spared for the
 provision of soft goods, consumer durables, and serv-
 ices. Moreover, the regime does not view major
 improvements in consumption as an urgent necessity.
 Indeed, the General Secretary stressed in his June
 plenum speech that improvement in the Soviet stand-
 ard of living will be slow.
 The regime apparently is willing to settle for slow
 growth in consumption because the cost of doing
 otherwise would be extremely high. Moreover, it
 believes that other means are available to motivate
 the work force: specifically, greater wage differentia-
 tion and sterner penalties for poor work performance.
 Andropov has been careful not to raise consumer
 expectations, playing down the material aspects of,
 consumption and stressing instead the role of socialist
 values and popular commitment to the system as
 determinants of the overall "quality of life."
 What Andropov Inherited
 Among the most difficult challenges facing Andropov
 when he became Secretary General of the Communist
 Party of the USSR one year ago was that of improv-
 ing worker performance just as the increase in real
 consumption of the Soviet population had virtually
 come to a halt.
 Although the standard of living had improved sub-
 stantially during the Brezhnev era, it remained low in
 comparison with those of developed Western countries
 and most East European countries. Moreover, by the
 late 1970s the Soviet Union was clearly in the midst
 of a downward drift in economic growth that tended
 to force greater attention to investment in priority
 sectors like energy, transportation, and heavy indus-
 try. Finally, four successive years of disappointing
 agricultural production, combined with continuing
 growth in personal disposable income, led to widening
 gaps in demand for and supply of "quality" foods.
 Queueing, informal rationing, and special distribution
 of meat, milk, and butter spread widely during 1979-
 82.
 For some time before the death of Brezhnev, the
 regime had been concerned by the agricultural sec-
 tor's inability to support a standard of living commen-
 surate with the USSR's great-power standing. The
 persistence of this condition was seen as an embar-
 rassment and a contributing cause to the broader
 problems of consumer discontent and slow growth in
 labor productivity. The Brezhnev Food Program, un-
 veiled in May 1982 after several delays, was intended
 to reduce the costly dependence on imports of feed
 grain and food; upgrade the variety, quality, and
 nutritional balance of the diet; and, in general, to'
 convert the farm sector from one that is a brake on
 economic growth to one that is a strong contributor.
 Moscow's response to slowing growth in material
 welfare in the Brezhnev era has been twofold and has
 brought mixed results. One attempted remedy, the
 continuing effort to tighten the reins on money income
 growth, has slowed the accumulation of purchasing
 power. Although this approach has contained the
 potential pressures of suppressed inflation, it has done
 little to improve the consumer's lot. Moscow has also
 consistently attempted to improve the match between
 the mix of goods and services and consumer desires
 and to improve product quality. But the predominant
 factor accounting for imbalances in consumer mar-
 kets remains the problem of assortment. Attempts to
 achieve equilibrium between demand and supply for
 specific products have been hindered by the regime's
 failure: (a) to adjust relative prices, resulting in a
 pervasive seller's market in which prices for goods
 generally do not reflect scarcity or cost, and (b) to

 provide effective incentives for producers to respond
 to consumer desires, to innovate, and to exercise
 stronger quality control.
 What Andropov Has Done
 Like Brezhnev, Andropov seems to feel that, until the
 agricultural sector can guarantee a higher quality
 diet, directing additional investment resources to pro-
 vide the accoutrements of a well-developed consump-
 tion sector has to be postponed. In the 1980s the
 Soviet consumer cannot look forward to widely avail-
 able personal care services, well-designed and spa-
 cious housing, or widespread car ownership.
 The range of responses that Andropov considers ap-
 propriate and feasible to deal with the near stagnation
 in consumption is limited. Under Andropov, the re-
 gime has generally followed the Brezhnev approach to
 consumption problems: it has endorsed the Food
 Program, it is slowing aggregate income growth, and
 it is pursuing administrative measures intended to
 force enterprises to produce a better quality and
 assortment of consumer goods. Since early this year,
 several decrees relating to consumer goods and
 services have appeared; their general tone indicates
 high-level frustration and irritation that the variety,
 quality, and general availability of consumer goods
 and services are not improving. But the decrees do not
 appear to provide many, if any, additional resources.
 Finally, Andropov is trying to grapple with a situation
 apparent in the last years of the Brezhnev regime:
 having relied increasingly upon material incentives
 instead of discipline, the regime had neither strong
 positive or negative incentives at its disposal to influ-
 ence worker performance in a period of slowing
 growth of real consumption. Although Andropov
 would like to have both, he recognizes that the
 economy is not going to provide much consumption
 growth in the near future, and, accordingly, he has
 taken several disciplinary measures to improve worker
 effort.
 The most recent measure dealing with worker disci-
 pline and incentives was a decree in August calling for
 tougher measures against absentees, drunks, and oth-
 er offenders. It provides for loss of pay and vacation
 privileges, demotion, or even dismissal for those guilty
 of such offenses while offering positive incentives for
 good workers. Managers are subject to disciplinary
 proceedings for failing to ensure labor discipline. F
 Although initially the concept of worker discipline
 was applied to blue-collar workers and directed large-
 ly at absenteeism, drinking on the job, and high labor
 turnover, Andropov has extended it to society at large,
 and the concept of discipline now implies social order
 and popular commitment to the system. It is the
 antithesis of what a recent Pravda editorial
 condemned:
 Unfortunately, people who live in their own little
 world of exclusive petty concerns, pushing commu-
 nity interests into the background, are still very
 much with us. This can be seen in manifestations
 of a private-ownership, nationalistic mentality;
 local self-interest; parasitism; money grubbing;
 acquisitiveness; drunkenness; and so on. An indif-
 ferent, narrow-minded attitude toward life is in-
 compatible with the makeup of a conscientious
 Soviet citizen.
 While the discipline campaign provides the negative
 incentives, Andropov's approach toward remuneration
 is designed to be a positive motivator. He has harshly
 attacked wage leveling, and he is making a stronger
 effort to link remuneration to the contribution of each
 worker. So far, however, except in agriculture, little
 systemic change in the direction of broader pay
 differentiation has occurred. Instead, factory manag-
 ers and trade union leaders have been told to reward
 better workers with more bonuses and privileges.=
 What Andropov's Policies Will Achieve
 The consumer welfare policies and approaches es-
 poused by Andropov to date are not likely to be
 wellsprings of long-term, significant benefits for Sovi-
 et consumers.
 The Food Program. Although the Food Program has
 long-run potential for more efficient food production,
 implementation probably will be slow. Even if the
 program's 1990 targets for per capita consumption of

 quality foods are met on time, consumption of these
 highly desired foods would still remain substantially
 below present per capita intake achieved in countries
 with comparable levels of economic development. In
 addition, because of high demand for quality foods
 and because personal disposable income will continue
 to grow, the supply-demand gap for these products is
 likely to remain large0
 Adjusting Enterprise Incentives. The pronounced dis-
 equilibrium in markets for individual consumer goods
 and services can be traced to the inability of the
 planning system to ensure a mix of goods that would
 satisfy consumer demand at existing prices and to the
 failure of quality control at all stages. Enterprises
 generally lack a strong interest in the marketing side
 of their operations, despite an extensive history of
 government efforts to change this attitude. A new
 success indicator that tasks heavy-industry enterprises
 to produce a specified amount of consumer goods per
 ruble of the enterprise wage fund is not likely to help
 much, because it does not relieve enterprises of the
 obligations to meet their primary output targets.
 Labor Discipline. Andropov's efforts to improve disci-
 pline will not endure unless some way of firmly and
 consistently tying worker remuneration to perform-
 ance is devised that does not depend upon an endless
 stream of decrees and harangues from the top. Estab-
 lishing this link between remuneration and perform-
 ance would require a reversal of the pronounced trend
 toward wage leveling that occurred under Brezhnev.
 Andropov has indicated that he will continue to push
 for more wage differentiation. Although a thorough-
 going and time-consuming revision of wage norms to
 reward higher skill levels and output would be neces-
 sary to carry out Andropov's intention of promoting
 productivity, this step would not be sufficient. Labor
 productivity growth is hampered by several problems
 outside the individual worker's control, such as late
 deliveries of supplies, equipment breakdowns, and
 faulty technical specifications. As it is, workers re-
 ceive only half their wages when they are standing
 idle through no fault of their own, a situation that
 contributes to poor morale and falsification of output
 statistics by managers unwilling to antagonize their
 workers
 Finally, even if the wage system is eventually struc-
 tured so that payment corresponds more closely to
 contribution to production, better workers will be left
 with the quandary of how to translate their relatively
 higher incomes into an improved standard of living if
 the desired consumer goods are not available. Most
 workers are unlikely to accept Andropov's thesis that
 the quality of life does not necessarily equate with
 material consumption.
 Slowing Wage Growth. Although Andropov has said
 more than once that the consumer economy as a
 whole is plagued by too much purchasing power, the
 chief problem is one of assortment. The imbalances in
 the Soviet consumer goods market are less the conse-
 quence of excess purchasing power relative to the
 overall supply of consumer goods and services than
 the result of disequilibrium in markets for specific
 categories of goods and services or items greatly
 desired by consumers.'
 Looking Ahead
 The policy implications of this situation cannot be
 encouraging from the perspective of the Soviet leader-
 ship. Although a continuation of the policy of slowing
 wage growth and allowing selective price increases for
 nonessential goods will help to prevent the growth of
 excessive purchasing power, this policy does little to
 provide incentives for workers. To reinforce incentives
 would require major restructuring of relative retail
 prices and substantial increases in the supply of
 quality foods, housing, and personal services-gener-
 ally bringing the product mix into greater conformity
 with demand. It would also require greater attention
 to relative wages to bring individual incomes more
 ' The evidence lends little support to the theory that repressed
 inflation caused by a faster growth of incomes than of total goods
 and services available for purchase is the reason for pervasive
 disequilibrium in consumer markets. First of all, our estimates of
 personal money incomes and outlays over the last decade and a half
 show generally equivalent rates of growth. In addition, the dispos-
 able income that Soviet households have been saving is a decreasing
 share of their annual income gains. Finally, comparisons of the
 USSR with countries where consumer markets are in equilibrium
 suggest that the ratio of net financial assets to consumption outlays
 in the USSR is not disproportionately high

 into line with workers' contributions to production. As
 past Soviet experience shows, it is far more difficult to
 carry out these initiatives than to control the growth
 of household incomes.
 The Andropov regime, while trying to dampen con-
 sumer expectations and to instill a more conscientious
 attitude among workers, still hopes to achieve some
 slow growth in the availability of consumer goods and
 services. We judge that Moscow would be highly
 reluctant to allow consumption levels to decline from
 their present level and will continue to import sub-
 stantial quantities of consumer goods, in part by
 pressuring its CEMA partners for more deliveries of
 these goods. The 1984 economic plan and the discus-
 sions surrounding the compilation of the 1986-90 plan
 will provide more clear-cut evidence regarding Andro-
 pov's intentions in the consumer arena.

 Secret
 Problems and Prospects
 of a New Succession P
 Soviet party leader Yuriy Andropov's absence from
 this year's anniversary ceremonies in Moscow-no
 general secretary has missed them in 30 years or
 more-is almost certainly due to a worsening of his
 physical health. His frail health in fact has been
 evident from the outset of his tenure and has given
 rise to speculation that the regime could face a new
 succession at any time.
 There are signs, moreover, that the bureaucracy has
 been concerned about Andropov's physical staying
 power, even while the new leader's hold on power is
 the Politburo is haunted by the question of
 succession and hard pressed to decide who from
 among its ranks could fill the position of general
 secretary if Andropov leaves the scene any time soon.
 There are good reasons for Soviet concern over the
 succession: sickness, death, and the consequences of
 earlier political battles have so reduced leadership
 ranks that the regime appears less prepared for a new
 succession than it was when Brezhnev died last year.
 Moreover, no likely candidate starting from among
 the senior party secretaries-Konstantin Chernenko,
 Mikhail Gorbachev, and Grigoriy Romanov-and
 including the darkhorses Dmitriy Ustinov and Viktor
 Grishin-now seems to have a better than 50-50
 chance to be selected. This situation strongly suggests
 that the next succession will be more controversial
 and tumultuous than the last one. Each of the best
 placed candidates-senior secretaries Chernenko,
 Gorbachev, and Romanov-have significant political
 liabilities, and Andropov's seeming support for Gorba-
 chev will not be much help once he is dead.
 Perhaps it will take a little longer than usual, but a
 new leader will emerge within a matter of days. No
 new leader is likely to have the power, authority, and
 prestige that Andropov had when he gained the post,
 and any new leader after Andropov is likely to
 encounter more difficulty in consolidating his posi-
 tion. As a result, the possibility of protracted turmoil
 within the leadership cannot be ruled out.
 The Potential for an Early Succession
 Although Yuriy Andropov has been party chief for
 only a year, his advanced age and uncertain health
 have raised questions among Soviets and Westerners
 alike about the length of his tenure. Indeed the illness
 that prevented Andropov from attending the revolu-
 tion ceremonies in early November-Khrushchev and
 Brezhnev never failed to attend-points to the Soviet
 leadership predicament. Andropov took office at age
 68 (he is now 69)-almost 10 years later in life than
 any of his predecessors. While the specific nature of
 his current health problems is unknown, the official
 explanation that he has a cold is almost certainly an
 understatement of the problem. Unofficially, Soviets
 report that he has a kidney ailment, but, whatever the
 exact nature of the problems, there is no doubt that
 his health is frail.
 At the same time his political position remains solid:
 Andropov is treated deferentially by his Politburo
 colleagues, he has the most authoritative voice in the
 leadership (while out of sight this fall, his remarks on
 the KAL shootdown and INF were prominently pub-
 lished in the Soviet media), and he was accorded top
 leadership status in the displays of leader portraits
 and slogans during the November anniversary cere-
 monies. Moreover, there is no evidence of organized
 opposition to his role in the Politburo.
 While Andropov has from the outset seemed political-
 ly healthy, concern about his physical status began
 the day of Brezhnev's funeral and has heightened
 since then. During the June 1983 visit to Moscow of
 Finnish President Koivisto, for example, Finnish offi-
 cials were surprised that Soviet authorities permitted

 Andropov to appear before the foreign press, an
 appearance which highlighted his poor condition.
 Another example of Andropov's physical weakness
 occurred the following month, when a long-scheduled
 meeting between Andropov and West German Chan-
 cellor Helmut Kohl had to be delayed because of
 Andropov's health. Even Soviet propagandists have
 been unable to show Andropov in good physical form.
 A US Embassy officer who saw a Soviet documentary
 film on Andropov that was released to movie theaters
 this summer reported that, despite the film's efforts to
 portray Andropov in the most favorable terms, he
 came across as a very sick man. Andropov's 12-week
 absence from public view since late summer has also
 served to raise doubts about his health status. He
 postponed a planned trip to Bulgaria, reportedly
 called off a planned Warsaw Pact summit meeting,
 and the fall meetings of the Central Committee and
 Supreme Soviet remain unscheduled as of 14 Novem-
 ber, possibly because of Andropov's uncertain health
 status.
 Soviet officials in Moscow and abroad have been
 openly discussing Andropov's health during the past
 year, indicating that it has become a subject of
 concern at least within the middle level of the
 bureaucracy:
 ? On one occasion a Soviet Embassy officer in Bel-
 grade passed along a story that Andropov had
 diabetes, on another that he had kidney trouble.
 ? A Radio Moscow official told Embassy officers that
 Andropov's health was not good and that he had
 kidney trouble.
 Andropov appeared weak and unsteady
 during the session, and his appearance cast a mood
 of uncertainty among Central Committee members
 about how long he would rule.
 These perceptions, if widely shared in the bureaucra-
 cy, probably have slowed Andropov's effort to consoli-
 date his position and could increase his vulnerability
 to political challenge. There is no question, moreover,
 that Andropov's long absence this fall has hurt his
 chances to push in new policy directions.
 question of succession and hard pressed to decide who
 from among its ranks could fill the position of general
 secretary if Andropov leaves the scene. Sickness,
 death, and the consequences of earlier political battles
 have so reduced leadership ranks that the regime
 appears less prepared for a new succession than it was
 when Brezhnev died last November. For example,
 without Andropov the party will have the smallest
 Politburo since the early 1950s, and there is no leader
 in the Secretariat who has experience comparable to
 that of Khrushchev, Brezhnev, or even Andropov.
 Moreover, when Brezhnev died there were at least two
 leaders well placed (holding membership in both the
 Politburo and Secretariat) and with the requisite
 experience to become general secretary: Andropov,
 who had been moved to the Secretariat several
 months before Brezhnev's death; and Brezhnev's pro-
 tege, Konstantin Chernenko. Chernenko, however,
 has suffered health problems during the past year.
 Role of the Politburo and Key Leaders
 The succession decision is most likely to be made in
 the Politburo by the senior core of remaining leaders:
 senior secretaries Chernenko, Gorbachev, and Roma-
 nov, Premier Tikhonov, Defense Minister Ustinov,
 Foreign Minister Gromyko, Moscow party boss Gri-
 shin, and Ukrainian party chief Shcherbitskiy. It will
 be in the interest of these leaders to move quickly in
 order to avoid conflict and political paralysis and to
 project an image of decisiveness abroad. While a
 coalition could form "in the corridor" before a formal
 Politburo meeting, all 10 remaining full Politburo
 members will have a vote on the succession question.
 Only if the Politburo is unable to reach a consensus
 would the decision shift to the more than 300 voting
 members of the Central Committee. If the Central

 Committee gets involved in the decision, support for
 individual leaders among its members, especially from
 key oblast party officials, would become very impor-
 tant in the selection process.
 Best Placed Candidates
 Precedent suggests that Andropov's successor will
 come from the party secretaries who hold voting
 membership in the Politburo-criteria met now only
 by Chernenko, Gorbachev, and Romanov. Chernenko,
 now 72 and in ill health, must be considered a
 candidate for Andropov's job, but he has significant
 liabilities as well as some strengths. He was passed
 over last time, reportedly because he lacked support
 from such key leaders as Ustinov and Gromyko, both
 of whom continue to be important players in the
 Politburo. Indeed, Chernenko's star seemed to fade
 soon after Andropov took office, although he has
 maintained the nominal number-two position in the
 party. Chernenko was absent during April and May
 for apparent health reasons-he probably cannot be
 counted on to be in political life for a long period-
 and appeared to have been slighted in some of the
 Soviet press treatment of the June Supreme Soviet
 session and party plenum. Moreover, during
 Andropov's absence for vacation and health reasons,
 Chernenko was said
 to be sharing party oversight responsibil-
 ities with others, a sign,                 that he
 was not fully trusted in the top supervisory role.
 There is more recent evidence, however, of a minor
 political comeback for Chernenko. Over the past few
 weeks his public level of activity has picked up: he has
 met with the Mexican Communist Party leader,
 Algerian officials, and Czechoslovak propagandists;
 he attended a conference of Bloc party officials in
 Moscow; and he published articles in prominent ideo-
 logical journals. The strongest signal that he remains
 an important factor in the leadership-and, hence, in
 the succession-is the highlighting of his position as
 unofficial party second in command at the recent
 anniversary ceremonies.
 have a life-threatening disease such as cancer, how-
 ever, he could be the choice of those in the Politburo
 who are reluctant or unable to choose among the other
 younger and better qualified candidates for the job.
 Moreover, the younger contenders might not even
 fight him for the job, if they perceive him as a weak
 and short-term prospect whose tenure would enable
 them to build strength for the future. These are
 admittedly poor reasons to select Chernenko, and the
 odds are less than 50:50 now that he would emerge on
 top in a succession.
 Gorbachev's prospects have improved in recent
 months, apparently because Andropov has consciously
 expanded his responsibilities in the leadership. Indeed,
 a Soviet Embassy officer in Belgrade, who has provid-
 ed much insight on Kremlin politics over the past two
 years, told a US official in August that Andropov
 wants Gorbachev anointed as number two in the
 party. The diplomat also stated that Gorbachev's high
 visibility reflected an expanding portfolio that in-
 cludes economic matters, agriculture, cadre policy,
 and ideology. A reliable Soviet informant also told our
 Moscow Embassy that Gorbachev is the senior secre-
 tary in charge of cadres, and Medvedev has indicated
 that Gorbachev (with others) may be chairing Secre-
 tariat meetings in the absence of Andropov.
 Soviets touting Gorbachev may be drawing conclu-
 sions from public events that suggest the scope of
 Gorbachev's activities, in fact, is growing. For exam-
 ple, Gorbachev presided at the appointments of two
 officials in July, served as master of ceremonies at a
 prestigious gathering of party veterans with Andropov
 in August, and that same month opened a Central
 Committee conference on cadres. In September he
 also attended a meeting of Soviet education-a new
 task for him. Gorbachev is also aided by his youth and
 apparent good health. Irrespective of his new responsi-
 bilities, his agricultural portfolio alone gives him
 much political clout. He deals with numerous oblast
 and kray party first secretaries from farm areas, and,
 by his own count, oversees 15 ministries that are
 responsible for more than two-fifths of Soviet GNP.
 Chernenko still has the same liabilities that prevented
 his selection last time, plus the further problem of ill
 health-indeed, there would probably be reluctance
 to elect another sick man. Assuming that he does not

 Gorbachev's expanding role in the leadership does not
 now easily convert into additional political muscle for
 him. So far, under Andropov, he has presided over
 only two important personnel shifts, and in neither
 case were "his" people installed. In short, he has not
 had enough time to make the cadre function work for
 him. Moreover, he probably cannot count on the
 support of the important heavy industry and defense
 constituencies in a succession fight. In this sense,
 Gorbachev's political base is narrower than it might
 seem from the growing scope of his public activities.
 Lastly, while Gorbachev is helped by Andropov's
 support, such support will not help after Andropov's
 passing unless he does more for him while he is on top.
 Romanov's prospects, on the other hand, are probably
 better than they appear on the surface. While he has
 had little visibility since becoming a party secretary,
 and his portfolio is narrower than Gorbachev's-he
 evidently is responsible for heavy and defense indus-
 try-Romanov is probably perceived by the more
 conservative elements in the party as the better
 choice. For example, he has had experience as a
 manager of a key regional party organization with
 strong ties to the industrial and military sectors.
 Moreover, he is an ideological conservative who has
 taken a harder line than many of his colleagues on
 foreign policy issues. In a time of trouble for the
 USSR at home and abroad, the Soviet leaders after
 Andropov may look to the more conservative candi-
 date as the better choice.
 Romanov, in fact, has been considered a succession
 candidate for over a decade, ever since then king-
 maker Mikhail Suslov installed him as Leningrad
 party leader in 1970. Since then he has been restless
 with ambition, generating recurrent rumors that he
 would be transferred to Moscow as either a party
 secretary or premier. After Andropov took office he
 began to receive broader exposure in the leadership
 (his attendance in April at the Karl Marx commemo-
 ration in Berlin was seen in this context). Moreover,
 Romanov sat with Andropov and Gorbachev at the
 meeting of party veterans in August and recently was
 referred to favorably in remarks by a regional party
 leader.
 His arrogant personality and open political self-  .
 promotion as well as stories regarding his scandalous
 behavior that have been circulating in the Soviet
 Union probably account for current perceptions
 among some Soviet observers-including a Soviet
 Embassy officer in Belgrade and Roy Medvedev-
 that he has limitations as a politician. Some foreign
 observers, such as our Consul General in Leningrad,
 on the other hand, now speak of a more sophisticated
 Romanov who is trying to pose as a gentleman on his
 best behavior. More importantly, according to both
 US and Canadian Ambassadors to Moscow, Roma-
 nov in recent exchanges has appeared to have a good
 grasp of the main issues-this contrasts with his
 earlier performance where he seemed to be ignorant
 of some of the basics.
 Darkhorses
 None of the senior secretaries is an ideal candidate:
 ? Gorbachev, 52, may be viewed as too junior, both in
 age and experience, for the top party job and may
 lack support from the military-industrial sector.
 ? Romanov, 60, has served only a short time as a
 national party secretary (since June 1983) and has a
 reputation for roughness that might not serve him
 well. His tendency in the past to frequently shuffle
 cadres may also be cause for concern among party
 bureaucrats.
 25X1
 25X1
 ? Chernenko seems to have few pluses other than his 25X1
 presence in the leadership and probably is not the
 choice of the military-security constituents
 The lack of ideal candidates for the general secretary
 position could lead the Politburo to turn to others
 outside the Secretariat, such as Ustinov, Grishin, or
 Shcherbitskiy. Such a course is unprecedented. For-
 mer Azerbaijan party leader Geydar Aliyev, brought
 to Moscow under Andropov as a full Politburo mem-
 ber and First Deputy Premier, is also a darkhorse
 candidate

 Secret Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/06/15: CIA-RDP84TO1083R000100110002-5
 Ustinov has the advantages of past experience in the
 Secretariat (1965-76) and service in the important
 military sector. At age 75, however, he is the second-
 oldest full member of the Politburo and has suffered
 from poor health. Nonetheless, if the regime wanted
 to send a signal that things are under control while
 recognizing that only an interim choice has been
 made, they could take the unprecedented step of
 selecting outside the Secretariat and pick Ustinov.
 Such a compromise choice would be only a first step,
 however, in a more protracted, potentially more con-
 troversial succession.
 Grishin had been mentioned by Soviet officials as a
 possible "compromise candidate" during the previous
 succession and could become one this time around.
 Located in Moscow, he has a definite political advan-
 tage over his other regionally based colleagues. How-
 ever, he too is handicapped by health problems and is
 not part of the Andropov coalition.
 Shcherbitskiy is probably the most influential leader
 outside Moscow and has extensive experience in eco-
 nomic management. His continued failure to move to
 a national-level position, however, is still a serious
 handicap for him. Moreover, some Soviet officials
 who have touted him in the past now state that
 Shcherbitskiy will remain on the margins of power. F
 Aliyev is known for his political ambition and ability
 to shift loyalties to get ahead. For that reason,
 however, he may not be trusted by his colleagues. As a
 Muslim, moreover, he probably would not be consid-
 ered acceptable for the top party post by the Slavic
 majority in the party
 After Andropov?
 Even if the next leader could positively be identified-
 and Gorbachev and Romanov seem to be front-
 runners-his present views insofar as they could be
 discerned probably would provide only a general sense
 of the direction Soviet policy would take in the
 immediate post-Andropov period. These views proba-
 bly would be modified as he attempted to gain support
 and even further altered by political calculations, the
 exigencies of events, and the broader perspective of
 his new post (witness foreign policy specialist
 Andropov's concentration on economic problems).
 As of now, the younger candidates to succeed
 Andropov-Gorbachev and Romanov-seem to share
 Andropov's basic domestic policy views. Both men
 probably view Soviet economic problems as heading
 the domestic agenda; both are strong advocates of
 discipline and greater efficiency in labor and produc-
 tion; and both are vigorous leaders who seem open to
 innovation, experimentation and change, albeit within
 strict ideological bounds. Romanov, an inveterate
 ideological conservative, sharply cracked down on
 dissidents as Leningrad leader. Gorbachev, in con-
 trast, at least appears to be more pragmatic and could
 be more flexible, less doctrinaire, in the ideological
 and social sphere. Chernenko's views on Soviet do-
 mestic issues are more widely known than those of his
 younger colleagues in the Secretariat. He has long
 advocated investment in consumer goods sectors and
 greater attention to the social factor in domestic
 affairs, and he has stressed traditional solutions to
 economic problems. In recent pronouncements in the
 ideological sphere, however, he has taken a more
 conservative line.
 In the foreign policy area, certain stylistic differences
 seem apparent within the party Secretariat. Gorba-
 chev, although lacking in foreign policy experience,
 projected an image of quiet self-assurance, flexibility,
 pragmatism, and intelligence during his recent trip to
 Canada. By contrast, Romanov, with over 20 foreign
 trips and fairly wide contact with foreign diplomats
 over the years, has far greater experience in foreign
 affairs. In their published statements, Romanov has
 taken a harder line than Gorbachev on foreign policy
 issues. During his May 1983 visit to Canada, Gorba-
 chev hewed closely to the established foreign policy
 line in both public and private remarks. Romanov's
 remarks in the foreign policy area have tended to
 focus on arms control issues and seem to evince a
 special interest in US-Soviet relations. While most of
 his public remarks have taken a hardline, ideological
 stance, he has posed on occasion as a partisan of
 better relations with the United States in private.
 Chernenko's public remarks during the Brezhnev era
 were more enthusiastic than most other Soviet leaders
 in his support of improved relations with the West,
 particularly the United States, and of arms limitation.

 Secret
 In the likely crisis atmosphere of an early Andropov
 succession, however, no new leader could afford to
 look weak or indecisive, nor could he retreat from any
 perceived challenge to Soviet interests abroad.
 Collectivity to the Fore
 If the succession occurs soon, no new leader is likely to
 have the power, authority, and prestige that Andropov
 had when he gained the post, and any of the above
 candidates would probably encounter more difficulty
 in consolidating his position. The presence of strong
 political rivals from the outset-something that
 Andropov has not had to face-would make the
 maneuvering in the Politburo particularly intense and
 the new general secretary's position more vulnerable.
 The age structure of the Politburo might allow a
 younger candidate to consolidate power sooner, as
 older members die off, but rivalry among younger
 leaders would also intensify

 creased. Andropov has less need for extensive staff
 support, given his considerable experience in foreign
 affairs before becoming General Secretary, and thus
 far only three men have been publicly identified as his
 foreign policy aides. A second group of influential
 men around Andropov is made up of informal advisers
 and speechwriters who have long-term links to the
 General Secretary.
 Gromyko's influence is probably at its highest level
 ever. In March 1983 he was named First Deputy
 Chairman of the Council of Ministers, a post that-
 combined with his job as Foreign Minister-gives him
 greater authority over the government's entire foreign
 policy apparatus, including the Ministry of Foreign
 Trade and the State Committee for Foreign Economic
 Relations. This assignment has made him the most
 senior of the three first deputy chairmen in the
 Council, by virtue of his tenure in the Politburo. It
 strengthens his authority-and that of Andropov-
 against Premier Nikolay Tikhonov, who has not been
 allied with Andropov and was out of the country at
 His Foreign Policy Allies
 Andropov, Andrey Gromyko, and Dmitriy Ustinov
 probably constitute an informal triumvirate for the
 making of foreign policy. All have extensive experi-
 ence in this field, but it was not until Brezhnev's latter
 years that they entered the innermost circle of lead-
 ers. In November 1981, for example, Ustinov gave the
 major policy speech on the eve of the celebration of
 the October Revolution, the first time that a Defense
 Minister had done so in over two decades. In 1982 he
 wrote a series of articles in Pravda-not linked to any
 holiday or anniversary-on Soviet defense policy and
 arms control.
 Under Andropov, Ustinov's prominence has increased.
 His statements to TASS on 6 December 1982 about
 arms control and security issues, for example, suggest-
 ed a degree of policy authority that Brezhnev would
 have reserved for himself, and the content and media
 play of the TASS interview underlined Ustinov's

 In the Brezhnev era, the General Secretary's personal
 staff played an important role in making foreign
 policy decisions. The staff included a number of high-
 ranking foreign policy specialists who provided the
 expertise Brezhnev lacked and helped him become the
 USSR's preeminent foreign policy spokesman. Ac-
 cording to US Embassy contacts in Moscow, however,

 Andropov has less need for such extensive staff
 support, given his considerable experience in foreign
 affairs before becoming General Secretary. He also is
 more intellectually vigorous than Brezhnev was in his
 later years and is not likely to need so much guidance.
 However, any General Secretary needs a staff that
 can assign tasks to the bureaucracy, coordinate its
 actions, and regulate the flow of information coming
 to him.
 Thus far, only three men have been publicly identified
 as Andropov's aides: Andrey Aleksandrov-Agentov,
 Arkadiy Vol'skiy, and Viktor Sharapov. Aleksandrov
 is the only holdover from Brezhnev's staff and seems
 to have responsibility for Soviet relations with the
 West. Vol'skiy, an engineer and former first deputy
 chief of the Central Committee's Machine Building
 Department, is probably concerned primarily with
 domestic affairs and industrial production.
 Sharapov worked for Andropov at the KGB and has
 edited collections of Andropov's speeches and articles,
 including one collection published after Andropov was
 named President, and a reprint of Andropov's 1982
 Lenin Day speech. Before joining the KGB in 1972,
 Sharapov was a Pravda correspondent in the United
 States, China, and Vietnam. He faithfully attacked
 US foreign policy in his role as a journalist, but we
 know little about his current views on foreign affairs.
 His "Kitchen Cabinet"
 A second group of influential men around Andropov
 apparently is made up of informal advisers and
 speechwriters rather than formal staff aides. These
 include Georgiy Arbatov, Fedor Burlatskiy, Vladimir
 Kryuchkov, and Aleksandr Bovin.
 Arbatov, a member of the Central Committee, has
 long been prominent as the head of the Institute of the
 USA and Canada and is Moscow's top expert on the
 United States. He has known Andropov since he
 worked for him in the Central Committee's Bloc
 Relations Department in the mid-1960s and has
 served as an important adviser to the Soviet leader-
 ship since the Institute was created in 1967.1      1
 Burlatskiy has known Andropov at least since 1959,
 when he worked under him in the Bloc Relations
 Department of the Central Committee. Burlatskiy
 currently heads the Department of Philosophy of the
 Committee's Institute of Social Sciences, but he has
 told foreigners that he spends most of his time writing
 speeches for Central Committee members and serving
 as an informal adviser to Andropov. An expert on
 Sino-Soviet relations, he has told Westerners that
 much of his published analysis of Chinese domestic
 politics was intended as thinly veiled commentary on
 issues facing the Soviet Union, such as economic
 reform and Stalin's legacy.
 Kryuchkov has been a personal friend and confidant
 of Andropov since at least the mid-1950s, when he
 served under Andropov in the Soviet Embassy in
 Hungary. In 1967 Andropov took Kryuchkov with
 him to the KGB, and in late 1974 Kryuchkov became
 chief of the First Chief Directorate, the KGB compo-
 nent in charge of foreign intelligence. In late 1978 or
 early 1979 he became a deputy chairman of the KGB.
 oolminded, clever,
 and a good organization man. He is one of the very
 few individuals mentioned as a "protege" of
 Andropov.
 Bovin frequently appears on Soviet television in his
 official position as a political commentator for Izves-
 tiya but also claims to be an unofficial consultant and
 speechwriter to top party leaders and one of Andro-
 pov's principal advisers. The two have known each
 other at least since the late 1960s, when Bovin, like
 others in the "kitchen cabinet," worked for Andropov
 in the Bloc Relations Department. He has had a
 visible public role in foreign affairs since Andropov
 became General Secretary. When asked in early 1983
 whether he carried a message to Chinese leaders
 during a recent trip to Beijing, for example, he replied
 that he "was" the message, implying that Andropov

 had sanctioned his trip as a signal to China. He has
 told foreigners that foreign policy would be more
 dynamic, decisive, and flexible under Andropov than
 under Brezhnev, but that its broad outlines would
 remain the same
 Some of these men, particularly Bovin and Arbatov,
 may very likely be more than advisers. Andropov has
 apparently used them to relay informal messages to
 foreign governments. They may, therefore, assume
 positions in the future as instruments of the foreign
 policy apparatus as well as advisers to the top leaders.
 Other Changes
 Although Andropov has brought in his own group of
 personal advisers, he has made few significant
 changes in the foreign policy establishment. With the
 exception of Gromyko's appointment as First Deputy
 Premier, the highest level change has been the promo-
 tion in December 1982 of Viktor Chebrikov from
 First Deputy Chairman to Chairman of the KGB.
 (Andropov's immediate successor in the KGB post,
 Vitaliy Fedorchuk, replaced Minister of Internal Af-
 fairs Nikolay Shchelokov, a Brezhnev crony who fell
 victim to Andropov's anticorruption drive.)
 Chebrikov joined the KGB in 1967 with Andropov
 but is generally considered more of a party official
 than an intelligence professional. Before joining the
 KGB he spent over 20 years in a succession of party
 posts in the Dnepropetrovsk region of the Ukraine, the
 former political stronghold of Brezhnev.
 Chebrikov's appointment will probably have little
 direct effect on Soviet foreign policy, and his appoint-
 ment most likely had more to do with Andropov's
 concern for domestic than foreign affairs. It seems
 unlikely, moreover, that Andropov will allow Chebri-
 kov to use the KGB to establish an independent role in
 foreign policy decisionmaking, because to do so would
 diminish some of Andropov's own authority. The
 KGB is probably still one of Andropov's most impor-
 tant bases of power.
 Institutional Representation on the Politburo
 Another unresolved question concerns the institution-
 al representation of various foreign policy organiza-
 tions on the Politburo. When the Ministers of Defense
 and Foreign Affairs and the Chairman of the KGB
 were promoted to the Politburo in 1973, the distinc-
 tion between Politburo "decisionmakers" and institu-
 tional "executives" was significantly blurred. The
 lack of turnover since that time, however, has made it
 difficult to determine whether this decision represent-
 ed a precedent for the longer term or reflected
 Brezhnev's need to place allies on the Politburo to
 support his foreign policy and particularly his ap-
 proach to US-Soviet relations.
 For a decade there has not really been a test case.
 Ustinov was already a Politburo member when he
 became Defense Minister in 1976. Andropov's imme-
 diate successor in the KGB was in office only a few
 months before he was transferred to another post.
 Chebrikov assumed the KGB chairmanship in De-
 cember 1982. The departure of Gromyko or Us-
 tinov-either by death or retirement-from their
 ministerial posts would raise the issue of institutional
 representation again. No current Politburo members
 or candidates have the type of experience to make
 them likely successors to either man, requiring the
 Politburo to look outside its own ranks to fill these
 institutional positions.
 25X1
 25X1
 It does not follow, however, that Chebrikov or the
 future Foreign or Defense Ministers will necessarily
 assume seats on the Politburo. The Politburo will
 certainly rely upon them, just as it relies upon other
 heads of government institutions, but this reliance is
 no guarantee of promotion. As in the case of Chebri-
 kov, men such as Andropov might have strong reason   25X1
 to prefer that these new "executives" remain in the
 political background. If so, the gap between execu-
 tives and decisionmakers that existed prior to 1973
 may soon reemerge. 25X1

 A Progress Report on
 Sino-Soviet Relations
 Although the third round of Sino-Soviet consultative
 talks in Beijing that ended in October resulted in no
 breakthroughs on major bilateral and international
 issues, the two sides are making some progress toward
 better relations. The political dialogue will continue,
 and the parties have agreed to a further expansion of
 contacts. These contacts still are quite limited when
 measured against either country's dealings with the
 United States, but they are striking compared with
 the situation prevailing less than two years ago.
 Ups and Downs in the Political Dialogue
 Both sides appear to have entered into the second
 round of consultative talks held in Moscow in March
 1983 optimistic that the other side's problems with the
 United States might make it more accommodating.
 But both' appear to have emerged from those talks
 discouraged over the other's obduracy.
 before the National People's Congress, reiterated that
 Moscow must make a serious move toward meeting
 Beijing's "positive proposals" at the March talks
 Moscow, stung by Zhao's remarks, within a few days
 accused him of making a "slanderous assertion" about
 a Soviet threat to China, repeating "hackneyed accu-
 sations" against Vietnam and Kampuchea, and mis-
 representing Soviet attempts to defend Afghanistan
 from "imperialist aggression." This was the first
 attack on a Chinese leader by name since the resump-
 tion of the Sino-Soviet dialogue last fall, and it
 presumably was meant to underscore Moscow's refus-
 al to make unilateral concessions on these three issues
 that China insists are the main "obstacles" to better
 relations. The Soviets followed up with another broad-
 side in Izvestiya on 19 June, complaining that the
 Chinese media were continuing to spread "malignant
 assessments and misrepresentations" of Soviet foreign
 policy and equating it with Washington's "aggressive
 Moscow vented its frustration first. An Izvestiya
 commentary on 19 April broke a seven-month mora-
 torium on media criticism of China when it accused
 the Chinese of creating artificial obstacles to im-
 proved relations, especially with its "fabrications"
 about a Soviet threat.
 In a press interview with East European journalists on
 the eve of his departure for Yugoslavia and Romania
 in early May, Chinese General Secretary Hu Yao-
 bang complained about Soviet sabotage along the
 border, revealing that some 200 Soviet "spies" had
 been arrested by the Chinese in the last year alone.
 Hu also said that the situation in southeast Asia could
 lead to conflict between the USSR and China. F_
 The Chinese subsequently claimed they canceled a
 visit by Deputy Foreign Minister Kapitsa to Beijing in
 May and decided against letting Chinese Vice For-
 eign Minister Qian Qichen stop off in Moscow for
 talks en route home from Eastern Europe the same
 month. This probably was because of Mongolia's then
 unpublicized expulsions of its Chinese minority. On
 6 June Chinese Premier Zhao Ziyang, in a speech
 militarist course."
 Even as the rhetoric was heating up, however, both
 sides managed to handle a few potentially thorny
 problems in relatively low-key fashion. For example,
 they pulled their punches during the Chinese artillery
 attack on the Vietnamese border in April. China's
 show of force to punish the Vietnamese for their
 offensive in Kampuchea was limited despite the rheto-
 ric about a "second lesson." Moscow responded with
 restraint and did not give fulsome expressions of
 support for its Vietnamese ally.
 The two sides were similarly circumspect in handling
 Mongolia's expulsion of its Chinese minority, a move
 that almost certainly had Moscow's approval. The
 Chinese eventually delivered a formal protest to the
 Mongolians on 3 June, almost three months after the
 expulsions began, but they avoided blaming the Sovi-
 ets. Moscow publicized the Mongolians' case but was

 careful not to rub salt in the Chinese wounds. The
 Chinese have remained silent since then, even though
 press reports indicate the expulsions are continuing at
 the rate of about 100 a week
 Deputy Foreign Minister Kapitsa to Beijing
 In early July the Soviets took some steps to check the
 seeming downturn in the dialogue by making a pro-
 posal on behalf of the USSR and all its European
 allies for joint cooperation against "imperialism." The
 Chinese reportedly rejected the proposal, but they did
 agree to reschedule Kapitsa's trip to Beijing.
 In August a Chinese Embassy officer in Moscow
 informed US officials of plans for the two countries'
 foreign ministers to meet at the UN General Assem-
 bly this fall, and leaders of both countries made
 conciliatory public statements that helped meet the
 other's security concerns. In a Pravda interview on 27
 August, General Secretary Andropov stressed the
 need for better relations in view of the current
 exacerbation of the international situation-an allu-
 sion to Soviet problems with the United States-and
 expressed confidence both sides wanted to curb mili-
 tary spending so as to free resources for domestic
 economic programs
 Two days later, in an interview in the Italian Commu-
 nist Party paper L'Unita, Hu Yaobang tried to meet
 Soviet concerns that normalization of bilateral rela-
 tions not jeopardize Soviet interests in third countries.
 Hu noted that China has never hurt Vietnam, Kam-
 puchea, Afghanistan, or Mongolia and will "never
 harm them in the future," thereby offering a guaran-
 tee, of sorts, of good behavior. The Chinese response
 to Andropov's conciliatory remarks was given in a
 banquet speech for visiting King Hussein of Jordan on
 2 September. Chinese President Li Xiannian wel-
 comed Andropov's expression of interest in improved
 relations and expressed his own hope that the "obsta-
 cles" will be removed so that normal relations can be
 established. Li, like Hu, avoided putting the burden of
 removing these "obstacles" entirely on Moscow. F_
 decision not to have Foreign Minister Gromyko at-
 tend the UN session. According to an American
 correspondent in Beijing, the meeting was to have
 focused primarily on the agenda for the next round of
 talks in Beijing. The Soviets reportedly tried to ar-
 range a meeting at another neutral venue-Romania
 or Yugoslavia-but the Chinese refused.
 Press and diplomatic sources report that, during
 Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Kapitsa's visit to
 Beijing in mid-September, the two sides agreed to
 open a second channel of communications at the
 deputy foreign minister level. Chinese Vice Foreign
 Minister Qian Qichen will visit Moscow next year. I
 The Soviets evidently made the suggestion in the hope
 of channeling talks about the Kampuchean, Afghan,
 and Mongolian issues into the new forum. Kapitsa has
 said they also want to persuade the Chinese to
 cooperate on those foreign policy issues such as the
 Middle East and South Africa where the two sides
 have similar positions.
 Although the Chinese agreed to the new talks, they
 apparently did not drop their right to raise interna-
 tional issues at the normalization meetings. They
 evidently wanted in part to demonstrate progress in
 Sino-Soviet relations on the eve of Secretary of De-
 fense Weinberger's visit. Beijing may also see in the
 new forum another channel for putting pressure on
 Moscow for movement on Vietnam, Afghanistan, and
 the Soviet military buildup on its border.
 China also accepted Soviet offers to assist in rehabili-
 tating two to four Soviet-built industrial plants, sub-
 stantially increase bilateral trade and student ex-
 changes, and further expand scientific and cultural
 contacts. The Chinese, however, reportedly rejected a
 Soviet proposal for regular meetings at the foreign
 minister level and for a resumption of the border
 talks. The Soviets are likely to continue pushing the
 latter proposal.
 The Chinese did not let the KAL shootdown in early
 September derail Kapitsa's trip to Beijing, and they
 did not support international efforts to condemn
 Moscow. The planned foreign ministers' meeting,
 however, was one of the casualties of the Soviet

 Secret
 The Third Round of the Normalization Talks
 The third round took place in Beijing from 6 through
 28 October with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister
 Ilichev and Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Qian as
 chief negotiators.               the Chinese are
 pressing Moscow to replace the "overly ideological"
 Ilichev as a negotiator. Moscow, however, reportedly
 is reluctant to do so because the only other Sinologist
 of comparable rank is Kapitsa, and the Soviets are
 reluctant to close down their newly opened second
 channel of communication to Beijing.
 China entered the talks with its,leverage enhanced by
 the recent improvement in Sino-US ties and the
 downturn in Soviet-US relations. The Soviets recog-
 nized this and probably were concerned that they give
 no sign they were prepared to bend because of it. Two
 major Soviet journal articles on the eve of the talks-
 the first in 18 months-implicitly urged Chinese
 concessions. They argued that Beijing's military posi-
 tion had actually deteriorated because of its new
 relationship with the United States
 During the round, Soviet diplomats complained that
 China appears to have added yet another obstacle to
 its list of preconditions for better relations-Soviet
 SS-20 deployments in the Far East. Chinese officials
 say they have not been reassured by Andropov's
 statement that SS-20s removed from Europe as a
 result of an INF agreement there would not be shifted
 to the Far East and were determined to raise the
 issue. One day after Kapitsa left Beijing in Septem-
 ber, Peoples Daily for the first time publicly called on
 the USSR to "considerably reduce" its missiles in the
 Far East.
 the Soviet approach in
 the consultative talks has involved normalization
 without accommodation-a fair description of Soviet
 policy to date. The Soviets have resubmitted proposals
 for better relations that have long been on the table.
 These include:
 ? Conclusion of a statement establishing the princi-
 ples of bilateral relations, first suggested immedi-
 ately after Mao's death.
 ? Conclusion of a nonuse-of-force or nonaggression
 pact, broached in the aftermath of the 1969 border
 clashes.
 ? Cessation of press polemics and propaganda, prof-
 fered every time that talks have been held since
 relations began to deteriorate in the 1950s. F-7
 The only new proposal that Moscow put forth when
 these talks resumed in 1982 involved certain confi-
 dence-building measures (CBMs). No good informa-
 tion is available on what precisely these entail, but
 they may be similar to the CBMs that have been      25X1
 agreed to or proposed between the Soviets and other
 nations, such as advance notification of exercises and
 no first use of nuclear weapons. Western press reports,
 citing sources close to the Soviet side, also say that
 Moscow proposed that the Chinese and Soviet border
 guards exchange information on their training and     25X1
 make reciprocal factfinding cross-border visits. The
 Soviet objective is to first reduce tensions with the
 Chinese and then to use such a reduction in tensions
 to change the international perception of Soviet weak-
 ness in the Sino-Soviet-US triangular relationship.
 China has rejected these proposals and put forth
 specific suggestions for removing the three obstacles
 to better relations. It has given wide publicity to its
 demands on all three questions. Vietnam must declare   25X1
 its intention to withdraw from Kampuchea uncondi-
 tionally and then actually begin withdrawals and to
 cease hostile acts against China. China will then
 agree to negotiate with Vietnam. Soviet troops must
 withdraw from Afghanistan and Mongolia, and the
 Soviets must reduce the number of troops and missiles
 along the Sino-Soviet border, preferably to the level
 prevailing in 1964.
 The Soviets have responded to Chinese discussion of
 the obstacles by encouraging Beijing to talk directly
 to the Vietnamese and the Mongolians. They have
 also attempted to reassure the Chinese that Soviet
 involvement in Afghanistan poses no threat to their
 security, and the Soviet military posture on the border
 dialogue on these issues thus far appears to have been
 sterile, with each side essentially talking past the
 other

 Both parties recognize, however, that their dialogue
 with one another enhances their respective leverage in
 relations with the United States. Thus, each time they
 have met they have generally agreed to some addi-
 tional resumption of heretofore banned cultural, eco-
 nomic, or scientific contact.
 The Areas of Progress
 The most important area of progress in the past year
 probably has been in the trade relationship. In March
 the two sides signed an agreement that will increase
 this year's trade turnover to $800 million-the high-
 est level since the early 1960s. The Soviets are
 arguing that this trade should be at the same level as
 Sino-US trade-$5 billion. Although the Chinese do
 not appear that eager for Soviet goods, the two sides
 reportedly have already agreed on substantially high-
 er levels for next year.
 In addition, the two sides have:
 ? Agreed to resume local border trade and reopen five
 border crossing points along their eastern and west-
 ern frontiers.
 ? Signed a civil air protocol that permits a mutual
 expansion in air service.
 ? Increased cultural, sports, and tourist exchanges-
 nonexistent in the 1960s and 1970s.
 ? Resumed visits by the "Friendship Societies."
 ? Agreed to exchange a limited number (10 this year,
 more next) of students and a wide variety of techni-
 cal personnel.
 ? Signed a new accord calling for a larger exchange of
 books and other published materials.
 Prospects
 Although Beijing and Moscow see major benefits to a
 further easing of tensions, the legacy of mistrust will
 not be easy to overcome and will continue to compli-
 cate negotiations. The territorial dispute is particular-
 ly difficult to deal with, because concessions by either
 side would set precedents that third parties could cite
 in pressing their own claims against China and the
 USSR. Both sides almost certainly also fear that any
 concessions on such an important issue would only
 whet the other side's appetite for more. In addition,
 the leadership in both capitals may be unsure of the
 ability of their opposite numbers to deliver on any
 bargain.
 The two countries are well aware that any agreement
 or disengagement along the Sino-Soviet border must
 take into account the interests of the military estab-
 lishments. A decision to offer major concessions on
 troop cuts, for example, would-even in the best of
 circumstances-entail acrimonious debate, especially
 in Moscow. This would be an unattractive proposition
 for Andropov, who particularly needs the military's
 support in the current period. The Chinese leaders, for
 their part, might also be reluctant to get into a row
 with their top military leaders once Deng Xiaoping
 leaves the scene.
 There seems to be little prospect, therefore, of a major
 breakthrough soon, and the Sino-Soviet dialogue,
 even under the most favorable circumstances, is un-
 likely to lead to a full rapprochement-with both
 sides cooperating on a wide variety of issues and
 treating each other as equals-within the next five
 years. The most either side seems to expect, or
 perhaps would even want, is a limited detente-a
 further relaxation of tensions, an increase in trade and
 other bilateral contracts, and some movement on the
 border dispute and other security issues. In moving
 toward this objective, moreover, both sides will pro-
 ceed cautiously to maximize their leverage with the
 United States and minimize the damage to their other
 interests in Asia.
 Nonetheless, if the current process stays on track, the
 two sides probably will eventually repair a good deal
 of the damage that was inflicted on their relationship
 during the 1960s and 1970s. The parties, by simply
 adhering to their present course of one small step at a
 time, could make considerable progress in expanding
 trade, scientific, and technological exchanges and the
 like. They might then reach the point where they
 would be willing to initiate serious negotiations over
 one or more of the main stumblingblocks to improved
 relations. For example, they might arrange parallel
 talks between the USSR, China, and Mongolia on
 mutual force reductions. Progress on such issues
 would be likely to be slow, however, mainly because of
 the military and geographic disparities.

 Secret
 Briefs
 Nuclear Missile             The Soviet Defense Ministry's announcement late last month that preparations
 Deployments             have begun for deploying "operational-tactical" missiles in East Germany and
 Czechoslovakia increases the probability that the Soviets plan to move SS-12/22
 ballistic missiles, as well as SS-23s, into Eastern Europe as one response to the
 NATO INF deployments.
 The announcement, which was carried by TASS and Radio Moscow, said that an
 understanding had been reached with East Germany and Czechoslovakia and that
 work had started in those countries in preparation for the deployments. Use of the
 term "operational-tactical" clearly indicates that in their earlier threats to deploy
 new missiles in Eastern Europe, the Soviets were referring to the SS-12/22, which
 has an operational range of over 900 kilometers, or the SS-23, which has a range
 of 500 kilometers. The term would not apply to the SS-21-a "tactical" missile al-
 ready fielded with more than half of the 19 Soviet divisions in East Germany. De-
 ployment of the SS-23, which is designed to replace the Scud-Bs already in       25X1
 Eastern Europe, probably would not require the permission of the host country.

 USSR: Comparison of 1967 and 1982                                      Percent change
 Wholesale Price Revisions
 1967               1982
 Revision           Revision
 Wholesale Price       According to data recently released by the Central Statistical Administration,
 Increase              Soviet industrial wholesale prices increased 12 percent in 1982. The largest
 increases occurred in fuels (62 percent), electric power (23 percent), and ferrous
 metals (23 percent). Machinery prices were reported as having fallen.
 The magnitudes of the 1982 price revisions were substantial by Soviet standards.
 Overall industrial prices, for instance, were raised more than during the last major
 revision of wholesale prices, which occurred in 1967. The continued surge in
 industrial material prices reflects in large part higher costs associated with
 developing lower quality raw materials in less accessible locations. Last year's
 revision of industrial wholesale prices is intended to boost industrial profit margins,
 promote resource conservation, and spur the production of higher quality goods.
 But prices play a limited role in the allocation of resources in the Soviet Union, so
 the changes, other than raising profit margins, are not likely to help much in
 achieving these goals.
 Pipeline Computer      A French firm under contract to develop a computerized control system for the Si-
 Control Development berian export pipeline is being impeded by lack of information from the Soviets
 and by technical problems. Moscow has so far refused to provide operating data
 needed to prepare software, reportedly delaying fulfillment of the contract. The
 French company also has encountered serious technical problems in developing the
 system

 the contract completion date, citing pipeline construction delays and cost overruns
 The firm reportedly had hoped to begin operational testing of software for the
 system in January 1984, but in July the Soviets requested a one-year extension of
 contract until it has received a tested program for the system.
 The Soviets may be unable to provide the necessary data because they have not de-
 cided how they will integrate the control system and the existing pipeline grid. In
 addition, Moscow may intend to evade its obligations to make payments on the
 Decree on Industrial The Central Committee recently attacked a major R&D facility-the Ural
 Innovation Ignored=  Scientific Center-for disregarding the regime's August decree on "measures to
 stimulate scientific and technical progress in the national economy." In reporting
 the Committee's criticism, Pravda indicated that the decree was being widely
 The decree, a highly publicized step to increase productivity and innovation, is
 hortatory and vague for the most part but does include a few specific measures. On
 1 January 1984 all industrial output will be divided into two classes-top quality
 and first quality. Articles that fail to reach the first-quality level are to be
 withdrawn from production within two years. To accelerate the process of quality
 differentiation, the price of such goods will be lowered 30 percent, while the price
 of all top-quality articles will be raised 30 percent. To raise the importance of pro-
 gress in science and technology (S&T) as a performance indicator, plant managers
 will be required to submit and fulfill an annual plan for the introduction of new
 technology or suffer a reduction in their total bonus payments of up to 25 percent.
 These directives are not likely to remove the systemic constraints which currently
 inhibit the pace of technological development. Marginal improvement in Soviet
 S&T performance may result, however, from any additional investment resources
 shifted to this area and from the threatened sanctions aimed at making R&D and
 production enterprise managers take their S&T responsibilities more seriously. F
 Soviets Selling        The USSR reportedly is successfully marketing Soviet-manufactured series-74
 integrated circuits in Japan and, to a much lesser extent. in the United States
 the Soviets have taken advantage of the opportunity created when
 one-third the price being charged by Japanese and US firms.
 Japanese and US firms concentrated on producing more advanced semiconductors.
 The Soviets recognized there would be a shortage of series-74 circuits, which they
 have been producing for more than a decade. They are selling the circuit-a basic
 component widely used in civil and military production worldwide-at less than

 The Soviets probably hope to gain some market recognition by selling integrated
 circuits in Japan and the United States-world leaders in this field. It is not clear
 how the foreign sales will affect supplies of these devices in the USSR. The
 military, however, presumably would be insulated from any disruptions.
 Soviet Manganese                                                                      Ithe
 Purchases             Soviets have purchased as much as 500,000 metric tons of high-grade manganese
 ore during the first half of 1983-about 400,000 tons from Australia and the rest
 from Gabon. This purchase is the first evidence of Soviet manganese ore imports in
 over a decade. With about 30 percent of known world reserves, the Soviet Union is
 the largest producer of manganese ore, and production was about 10 million tons
 last year. The Soviets, however, have been plagued by declining quality of their
 ore. We believe the high-quality imported ore is needed to blend with Soviet ore
 for use in new Japanese-designed electric furnaces for the manufacture of high-
 grade ferro-manganese, a compound used to increase the hardness and wear
 resistance of steel.
