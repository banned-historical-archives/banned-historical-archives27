 The Washington Herry-Go?Iloand_
 Peace Prospeete
 We reported on Oct, 2.1 that
 President Nixon, contrary to
 what  the  newspapers  were
 .saying, preferred to hold off a
 Vietnam cease-fire until nfier
 the   election. "Politically
 speaking," we  wrote,  "the
 President believes it is better!
 to keep the settlement term>
 vague until alter the ere'-tion."+
 He, tr,erefare, deliberately.
 sought to extend the secret ne?
 gotiations past election day to
 prevent Hanoi from exploiting
 an election-eve cease-fire and
 to avoid  charges  that  he
 rushed into an unsafe settle-
 ment for political purposes.
 The President, however, is
 now optimistic that he can get
 a cease-fire on terms which
 will leave South Vietnam rea-
 sonably safe from a Commu-
 nist takeover. His optimism is
 based on intelligence reports
 which depict Hanoi as being
 under intense diplomatic and
 military pressure.
 Both Moscow and Peking'
 are reported to be pressing!
 the North Vietnamese to end
 the war. This has been accom-
 panied, according to the intel-
 ligence reports, by a slight but
 'significant slowdown in mili-
 tary support.  At the  same
 time, Hanoi is beginning to
 feel the pinch from the U.S.
 blockade of North Vietnamese
 ports and bombing of the sup-
 ply lines.
 Perhaps even more signifi-
 cant, the intelligence reports
 claim that North  Vietnam's
 military leaders  have been
 jolted by the failure of their
 spring offensive to reach Its
 objectives. The   South Viet-
 namese army was not the
 pushover that Hanoi expected.
 The leaders also miscalculated
 the ferocity of the U.S. air and
 naval assault which has been
 more punishing than the fire.
 power President Lyndon John.
 son turned against them.
 In the past, the intelligence
 reports misled Johnson to pre-
 diet privately that the war
 would be over in 1967. But the
 military reporting and intelli-
 gence  techniques  have  im-
 proved. President Nixon haa'
 faith that this time the re
 ports are right.

 The Washington Merry-Go-Round
 tolumnists fore Gifts to Greeks
 By Jack Anderson
 The Greek dictatorship has
 sponsored a luxury tour for
 some of America's best-read
 conservative  columnists.  In
 some cases, their wives also
 made the trip.
 Not  surprisingly, the red-
 carpet trip produced a gush of
 pro-junta columns in the na-
 tion's press. Readers, however,
 didn't know that the tour was
 financed, at $2,000 a head, by
 t h e   government-controlled
 Hellenic  Industrial' Develop-
 ment Bank, whose urbane gov-
 ernor, P a u 1 Totomis, once
 rounded up thousands of inno-
 cent Greeks in concentration
 camps.
 Totomis  was' the  Junta's
 Minister of Public Order for
 six  months  after  the  1967
 coup. This charming Athenian
 man-about-town  put up the
 columnists at the plush King
 George  Hotel, arranged for
 their  first class travel and
 picked up their bills for fine
 wines and Greek foods.
 'Pile suave Totomis and his
 bosses would have gotten their
 money's worth out of the jun-
 ket if the only man on it had
 been Ralph de Toledano, who
 distributes  his  conservative
 views to 100 papers. "For the
 first time in its 150 years -of in-
 dependence,"   wrote   d e
 Toledano, "Greece is prosper-
 ing and the people satisfied."
 But de Toledano had another
 gift for the Greeks. When To-
 tomis' bank sponsored a pavil.
 -lion at the Greek-American
 AHEPA conference in Atlanta,
 deToledano wrote Vice Presi-
 dent Spiro Agnew on Totomis'
 behalf. The Vice President did
 not know Totomis, but took
 de Toledano's word for the
 Greek's good works.
 In a personal letter, Agnew
 -  without ever seeing ' the
 bank's pavillion - lauded To-
 tomis' contribution to Greek-
 American amity.  The letter
 has been proudly publicized
 by Totomis.
 The dictatorship reaped fur-
 ther benefits from columnist
 James  J.  Kilpatrick,  who
 praised the way things are
 going under the military re-
 gime. The capable, sometimes
 caustic Kilpatrick trailed to tell
 his millions of readers that
 the bank had picked up his
 tab when he singled out the
 bank for praise.
 "The more the present gov-
 ernment succeeds in promot-
 ing industrial growth around
 the country, the more secure
 that   government  becomes.
 Through . . , such energetic
 outfits  as  the  Hellenic In-
 dustrial  Development                                                        Bank,
 the government is doing just
 that," wrote Kilpatrick.
 Other kind words were writ-
 ten by junketeering column-
 ists Anthony Harrigan, who
 doubles as executive vice pres-
 ident of the Southern States
 Industrial Council; former Na-
 tional Press Club President
 Allan Cromley; Daily Oklaho-

 of Commerce economic writer.
 While most of the copy writ-

 is favorable  to  the  junta,

 any  case,  he  said  he was

 said.

 By Jack Anderson and Les Whitten!
 aclc in the sixties, a civil-rights mu]e train-symbol of
 E ih
 ow w far the plodding poor are from the Mercedes rich-
 arrived at a chic evening fundraiser in Washington. The
 hostess, dressed in her Pucci garden-party clothes, delicately
 led the mules by a bridle up her long circular driveway for
 the benefit of the Tv cameras.
 As the cameras ground, the TV men called at her to say
 something to the young mule driver who had helped bring
 .the wagon train all the way up from some southern farm and
 had been deputized to clean up her driveway after the mules.
 The ]ady turned her most radiant smile upon the mule
 skinner and said in Radcliffe accents: "Aren't these mules
 just wonderful, so patient and wise?"
 The young man looked back at the roadway where the
 mules had laid out his work for the evening. "Well lady,"
 he drawled, "that depends on which end of the mule you
 have to deal with."
 So it is with Members of Congress.
 When Senator John Stennis rams through a bill aiding
 children who lost their special schooling because their serv-
 icemen fathers died in Vietnam, then Stennis is courtly, sage,
 and effective. When he uses the same legislative skills to
 defeat a civjl-rights bill, then lie is a wool-hatted red neck.
 When the late Senator Tom Dodd was racked by the
 Senate for pocketing his campaign funds, then he was a
 rogue. A few months later, we watched him presiding over
 tedious hearings on gun controls and drug abuse. Deserted
 by other committee members who didn't want to be seen on
 TV with him, the lonesome Dodd plugged on. There was a
 sort of splendor, about him then.
 There is a temptation, nonetheless, to deal with Congress-
 men by categories. The gin-rummy geniuses of the Senate
 Press Gallery tend to divide Congress into neat opposing
 armies of Southern Democrats-Conservative Republicans vs.
 Northern Democrats-Moderate Republicans. But where does
 this put former Senator John Williams, a down-on-the-farm
 conservative who investigated federal farm giveaways?
 Economists seee Congress as blocs supporting Big Business,
 Big Labor, Big Agriculture, Big Oil, and the like. But how
 do you classify such economic mavericks as Representative
 H. R. Gross or Senator Phil Hart?
 Consumer advocates categorize Congress as pro- or anti-
 consumer. But what about such. Jekyll-I-Iydes as .SesiatOr
 Vance Hartkc, who sponsors legislation to goldplaterail-
 roads even as he smashes Detroit's wraparound .fetlders?
 The Americans for Democratic Action and the A nei?icans
 for Constitutional Action use specific votes to evalI  to the
 worth of Congressmen, often coming up with opposite con-
 clusions on the same men.
 The classifiers of Congressmen are legion. For our part,
 we have come to suspect that our mule-headed, mule-ended,
 ever-fascinating Congress defies categorization. But when the
 Washingtonian asked us to classify Congressmen for their
 anniversary issue, we hesitated only a moment.
 We have consulted our files (published and unpublished),
 reviewed our personal experiences, and relied heavily upon
 our gut reactions. We have sought the opinions, too, of a
 wide range of Capitol I fill observers.
 We are aware, of course, that our national legislators often
 achieve prominence by speechnialcing and publicity. On
 Capitol I-Jill, there is little correlation between power and
 publicity. Congressional authority, as Woodrow Wilson put
 it half-a-century ago, "is perplexingly subdivided and dis-
 tributed, and responsibility has to be hunted down in out-of-
 the-way corners."
 For instance, Senator James Eastland, a bourbon-and-
 branch-water Southerner opposed to social change and vir-
 tually every other manifestation of the twentieth century
 except federal subsidies to cotton farmers, is almost un-
 known outside of Washington and Mississippi. But few nien
 in Washington wield as much weight.
 We have sought, in our own irreverent way, to classify the
 backroom boys as well as the frontroorn performers. We dis-
 covered that some Congressmen are anonymous even to us.
 We set up a special category for the more outstanding
 nonenities, but many we simply ignored.
 A word, too, about degree. Obviously, some senior Sen-
 ators fortunate enough to be listed as "Dirty Old Men" are
 not at the peak of their pursuit. One such glorious has-been
 has slowed to an occasional posterior pat. The same distinc-
 tions of degree apply to many of our other categories.
 For those Congressmen who feel we haven't treated them
 with the proper dignity, we offer no apologies. We have
 always regarded it a function of journalism to prick the
 pompous, to deflate the windbags, and to humble the powerful.

 ''the Washington Merry-Go-Round
 Peking and Moscow Si Flavana No
 By Jack Anderson
 President  Nixon  has  re-
 =jected suggestions that he foI-
 low UP his trips to.Peking and
 Moscow with all overture tc,
 I1ava.na.
 He has no intention of seek-
 iirg better relations with.laidel
 Castro as long as Cuba ex-
 ports revolution to other Lat-
 in-American  countries  and
 Russia ? is permitted to use
 Cuban territory for military
 purposes.
 i  There have been conflicting
 signals from Havana. whether
 Castro is really interested in
 improving relations' with the
 United -States.  Secret  nie's-
 sages have been received in
 Washington suggesting he is
 eager to restore normal rela-
 Lions. These have been fol-
 lowed,- almost invariably, by
 public   attacks ?  upon   the
 United States.
 Last fall, for example, Cas-
 tro got word that the United
 States might soften its atti-
 tude toward Cuba. He hastily,
 if' cautiously, flashed back the
 si
 l th
 h
 gna
 at
 e not only was re-
 ceptive but that he might even
 be, willing to use "traditional
 democratic  procedures"  to
 spread  "socialist  power" in
 Latin America.
 Castro's message was re-
 peated in the right places at
 the United Nations by his dip,
 lomatic-intelligence represent-
 ative, Teofilo Acosta Rodri.
 guez.  The  word  q u i c k l y
 reached  the Central Intelli-
 gence Agency, which sent a se-
 cret report, dated Dec. 8, to
 the White I-louse.
 Secret Message
 "Acosta  commented  that.
 there is some support in Cuba
 for the view that Cuba could
 benefit  from    improved cul-
 tural ties with the U.S., or
 some realistic adjustment of
 differences .. .
 "Later in the conversation,
 Acosta said that Cuban lead-
 ers are doing some re-thinking
 on basic revolutionary tactics.
 There is some theoretical op-
 position to the 'Che Guevara'
 theory, which favors support-
 ing native insurrectionists and
 anarchists in poor countries.
 "Instead, support is growing
 for  the  Chilean  formula,
 which maintains that tradi-
 tional democratic procedures
 are the best means of socialist
 power  in weak,    backward
 countries."
 As it happened, Castro got
 his signals' crossed. He was
 wrong about the possibility
 that the United States might
 soften its line toward Havana.
 The blunt truth is that Presi-
 dent Nixon isn't the least in-
 terested in an accommodation
 with Castro.
 Those who watch Havana
 for the U.S. are convinced that
 Castro would jump at a genu.
 ine chance to normalize Cu-
 ban-American  relations.  He
 would  like  nothing better,
 they say, than to sit down as
 an equal with Mr. Nixon.
 Castro's  slashing attacks
 upon the U.S., they believe,
 are strictly defensive. He tries
 to appear, intractable toward
 the United States, they say
 ,
 because he is convinced the
 United States is intractable to-
 "In the latter part of Nov
 ember,  1971,"  reported  the
 CIA, "Teofilo Acosta Rodri-
 guez ... said that Fidel Cas-
 tro, Cuban prime -minister,
 had received a report before
 his departure for Chile that !
 U.S. officials were considering
 a reversal of the U.S. hard-line
 policy toward Cuba.
 "As a result, Havana had re-
 quested Cubans at the United'
 Nations to check the report.
 Meanwhile, Castro had de.'

 hind Nixon.
 Nixon's Cuban Policy
 A  White House aide as-
 sured us, however, that Mr.
 Nixon doesn't listen to Rebozo
 on Cuban Policy. The bide said
 the President based his hard
 line on three factors:
 I. U.S. Policy toward Cuba
 isn't unilateral, but multilat-
 eral.  The  Organization  of
 American States voted in 1962
 to break diplomatic and corn.
 mercial ties with Cuba. Until
 this is reversed, the U.S. will
 be bound by the OAS vote.
 2. Russia uses Cuba as a
 base to refuel'its submarines
 and for other military pur-
 poses, The argument has been
 made that this violates the
 Monroe Doctrine. Moscow also
 gives Cuba an estimated $250
 million a year in military aid,
 not  to  mention  twice that
 amount in economic aid.
 3. Cuba continues to provide
 arms,  money  and  guerrilla j
 the White House, for example,
 the CIA quoted a confidential;
 source as revealing "that they'
 Soviets a?+l;ed Fidel Castro to'
 try to regain control or Latin
 American revolutionary move-
 ments and to develop closer
 relations with Latin American
 communist parties- and their
 leaders . . ."
 The source quoted a Cuban.
 intelligence  officer, Enrique
 Benavides, as saying "that:So-
 viet Premier Aleksei Kosygin
 had promised to provide finan-
 cial aid to Castro's efforts to
 regain control  over  these
 movements....
 "Benavides said that; through
 Cuba   the  Soviets    will
 support armed revolution or'
 political struggle, whichever
 was deemed appropriate, in
 given  countries throughout'
 Latin America. According to
 Benavides, the Soviets have
 told Cuba they will `pay for
 everything' in helping all revo-
 lutionary groups, even Catho,
 lie radical group.
 "Benavides strongly empha-
 'sized  that  Cuba  has  not
 changed its line but still fa-
 vors armed revolution every-
 where in Latin America."
