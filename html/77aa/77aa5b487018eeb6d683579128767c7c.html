 THE ALBANIA-CHINA RIFT:
 FOR- TIRANA,- FEW OPTIONS
 The rapid deterioration of Albania's relations with
 Peking this year for the first time raises the possibility
 of a break between the two formerly close allies.   Avail-
 able evidence is insufficient to permit a full explanation
 for the Albanian motivation in provoking such a rupture.
 There are indications however, that Tirana is trying to
 devise a strategy to follow should it lose the political
 and material support provided by the Chinese for the past
 16 years.
 In view of Albania's strategic geographic location, its
 future course is of deep concern to all of its Mediterranean
 neighbors.   The Soviet Union, which was allied with Tirana
 until 1961, might try to take advantage of a Sino-Albanian
 break to reestablish a political foothold in Albania, but
 Moscow would probably be rebuffed.   Should the Soviets be
 successful, the status quo in the Balkans would be upset,
 and Albania's closest neighbors--Yugoslavia, Italy, and
 Greece-.-would perceive a serious threat to their security.
 Driven by xenophobia and radical ideological fervor,
 the Albanian leadership has kept the country in relative
 isolation from the outside world.   Economically backward,
 it has for the past 15 years been heavily dependent on
 Chinese help for its industrial development.
 Tirana's apparent efforts to reorient its foreign
 policy have been accompanied by signs of ferment within
 the leadership.   The massive purges of the cultural,  _
 military, and economic establishments since 1973 afford
 ample evidence of internal tensions.   The Communist
 25X1

 Approved For Release
 "old guard", led by aging party boss Enver Hoxha, is
 holding on to the reins of power, but younger functionaries
 who entered the power structure in the wake of the purges
 can be expected to make their mark on regime policies
 before long.
 Fragmentary evidence suggests that certain new foreign
 policy trends may be emerging in Albania.
 --Although Sino-Albanian relations have fallen to an
 unprecedented low, Tirana may still be able to
 avoid a final break with Peking.   In mid-August,
 the Albanians hinted that they would like to talk
 over their differences with the Chinese.
 --Should a break nevertheless occur, the regime would
 probably not shut itself off entirely from the rest
 of the world.
 --Rather, Albania is likely to strive gradually to
 improve its relations with a number of countries,
 including industrialized Western states.   There is
 evidence that the regime is already making probes
 in that direction.
 There are obvious limitations to forming such new
 relationships.
 --Since the break with Moscow, the Albanians have
 been obsessed with fear of a Soviet threat to
 their security.   Hoxha, who engineered the split,
 and the rest of the Albanian leadership are likely
 to remain opposed to reestablishing better relations
 with Moscow.
 --There is no evidence that Tirana is interested
 in a rapprochement with the US at this time.   A
 policy change might emerge gradually, however.
 --Ideological differences, combined with ethnic
 and territorial tensions, prevent Tirana from
 normalizing its relations with Yugoslavia--its
 most natural economic partner.   Tito's success

 SECRET
 SECRET

 in improving relations with China has doubtless
 aroused Albanian suspicions of Chinese betrayal
 and political encirclement, making its opposition
 to Yugoslav "revisionism" even firmer.
 --Despite Tirana's stepped-up efforts to improve
 relations with the West Europeans, the ideological
 rigidity of the Hoxha regime forecloses much pro-
 gress.                          Under no foreseeable conditions would the
 West replace China as a "protector" against threats
 to Albania's security.
 --Albania hopes it could compensate for the loss of
 Chinese aid by increasing trade with the West.   The
 non-Communist world, however, is unlikely to provide
 enough assistance to enable Tirana to maintain its
 industrial development programs.
 Albania faces a slow and frustrating job in trying to
 work itself out of its exclusive foreign ties with the
 Chinese.   Its alternatives to China's friendship and pro-
 tection appear extremely limited.
 Hoxha's departure and the formation of a new, younger
 leadership--when it happens--may open the door to important
 policy changes, but our knowledge of Albanian political and
 policy forces is too fragmentary even to guess at their
 direction.

 I.     THE SINO-ALBANIAN ALLIANCE
 Point of No Return?
 1.   In the late 1960s cracks began to appear in the
 Sino-Albanian alliance.   Until late last year, however,
 disagreements were more or less covered up by the regimes'
 public insistence on their "unbreakable friendship."
 2.   Mao Tse-tung's death last October deprived the
 Albanian Communists of their main benefactor.   The Albanian
 leadership realized that the emergence of Hua Kuo-feng,
 a less doctrinaire politician, would lead to a more prag-
 matic political climate in China.   The purge of the radical
 members of the Chinese leadership--the "Gang of Four"--
 whom Tirana considered as its ideological allies, further
 upset the Albanians.   Tirana expressed its dissatisfaction
 in coolness toward Hua and unwillingness to endorse the
 Chinese campaign against the radicals.
 3.   Early this year Tirana began to use certain
 parties of the formerly pro-Peking Marxist-Leninist splinter
 movement as surrogates in its polemics against Peking.   In
 response, the Chinese began to advise some other splinter
 parties of their differences with Albania in an attempt
 to prevent defections to Tirana.
 4.   By mid-summer relations between the two regimes
 had reached an unprecedented low.   In recent months:
 --The Albanian press launched fierce attacks on the
 basic tenets of China's foreign policies as formu-
 lated by Mao.
 --Tirana recalled military personnel training with
 the Chinese air force and began a phased withdrawal
 of Albanian students studying in China.
 --Rumors circulated that the Albanians had requested
 Peking to withdraw its technical experts from
 Albania.   Despite denials on both sides, there is
 evidence that these technicians are returning home,
 allegedly "for vacation."

 SECRET

 --Tirana continued to convert Marxist-Leninist splinter
 parties to its ideological line.  At least one party
 quoted by the Albanian press has acknowledged Tirana
 as the sole leader of the Marxist-Leninist movement.
 --The Albanians hinted that Chinese foreign policy
 principles might be as damaging to world revolution
 as Eurocommunism.
 5.  As of mid-August, however, neither country had
 engaged in public name-calling.   There are also some indica-
 tions that the Albanian leadership may not be united in
 wanting to provoke a final breakdown of the partnership.
 An Albanian hint that the regime would be willing to hold
 talks with Chinese could postpone a showdown.   Peking has
 not as yet responded to this overture.
 Origins of the Alliance
 6.   Khrushchev's theoretical innovations, as outlined
 at the 20th congress of the CPSU in 1956, met with adverse
 reaction in both Tirana and Peking.   Both regimes were
 skeptical about the feasibility of the "parliamentary road"
 and viewed revolutionary violence as the only effective
 road to revolution.   Both considered Khrushchev's policies
 of "peaceful coexistence" with the West opportunistic, and
 both continued to see the US as the main obstacle to achieving
 a world-wide victory for Communism.  Additionally, fearing
 domestic repercussions, the Albanian leadership decided not
 to abandon the Stalinist legacy.  Moreover, in the face of
 Moscow's rapprochement with Yugoslavia in the early 1960s,
 the Chinese and the Albanians shared an unrelenting hostility
 to Titoist "revisionism."
 7.   As their ideological quarrel with Khrushchev
 mounted, the Albanian leaders increasingly saw the Soviet
 Union as a threat.   One result was the purge of elements
 thought to be close to Moscow; another was reliance on
 China to protect Albania against a potential Soviet threat.
 8.   For the Chinese, Albania's rejection of Moscow
 presented the first--and only--opportunity to rally a
 ruling communist regime in support of their policies.
 Although the alliance with Tirana entailed some economic
 burden, Peking was convinced that the price was justified

 by the acquisition of an ally in a region that the Soviet
 Union traditionally regards as its sphere of influence.
 The Source and Growth of the Dispute
 9.   Differences between Tirana and Peking, mainly
 over foreign policy issues, first appeared in the late
 1960s.   China's efforts to seek closer international ties
 with an increasingly large number of states, including
 NATO members, troubled the Albanians, who detected a
 neglect of revolutionary principles and a tendency toward
 opportunism.
 10.   The differences over practical approaches on
 foreign relations were soon reflected in the ideological
 formulations on which foreign policies of the two countries
 were based.   Concerned over a Soviet military threat, Mao
 revised his views on the status of the two superpowers--the
 US and the Soviet Union.   He concluded that despite the
 continuing war in Southeast Asia, the US presented a lesser
 danger to China's security than the Soviet Union.
 11.   The resulting rapprochement between Peking and
 Washington was condemned by the Albanian leadership, which
 held that it is not permissable to "lean on one imperialism
 to oppose the other."   Tirana continued to equate the danger
 posed by the two superpowers and claimed that "collusion"
 existed between Moscow and Washington at the expense of the
 communist movement.   The Chinese, on the other hand, main-
 tained that fundamental conflicts between the US and the
 Soviet Union would undermine prospects for lasting coopera-
 tion.
 12.  During-the 1960s, Albania was heavily dependent on
 Chinese economic assistance.   Since 1961, this has totaled
 between 600 and 900 million US dollars.*  In the early 1970s,
 however, signs of a reduction in Chinese economic and
 *   In 1970, imports accounted for more than one-fifth  of
 Albania's GNP.   Albania must purchase abroad virtually
 all the machinery and equipment, structural steel,
 chemical fertilizer and coke indispensible for industrial
 development.   China has provided more than half of these
 imports, either directly or through purchases from West
 and East European countries.   The Chinese have also made
 periodic wheat purchases abroad for Albania.

 military assistance to Albania appeared.   There is no
 clear evidence, however, that the decline--in the form
 of delays in the flow of materiel--was a conscious
 Chinese attempt to blackmail the Albanian leadership.
 But the latter probably viewed the decline as a confirma-
 tion of its suspicions about Peking's "opportunism."
 13.   Despite underlying ideological differences, on
 the surface Albanian-Chinese relations remained cordial
 until the death of Mao Tse-tung.   One month after Mao's
 demise, Enver Hoxha, in a widely publicized report to the
 Albanian party congress, gave a comprehensive account of
 Tirana's opposition to Chinese foreign policy positions
 and Peking's attitudes toward the Marxist-Leninist splinter
 movement.   The report did not directly attack China, but
 reiterated Albania's opposition to China's rapprochement
 with the West and projected the Albanian positions as more
 revolutionary than Peking's.   Conspicuously absent were
 references to Albania's moral and material debt to Peking
 and praise for the new Chinese leadership.
 14.   The extent of the decline in Albania's relations
 with Peking became publicly known only last July, when
 Albanian media published a bitter attack on the theory of
 the "three worlds" that has been the basis of China's
 foreign policy since the late 1960s.   Tirana denounced the
 theory as anti-Marxist and charged that it undermined the
 revolutionary enthusiasm of the world proletariat.   Since
 the theory had been formulated under the guidance of Mao
 Tse-tung, the attack was a clear break with Tirana's
 longstanding recognition of Mao as the paramount figure of
 contemporary Marxism-Leninism, the equal of Marx, Engels,
 Lenin, and Stalin.
 15.   A month after the first open attack, Albanian
 media began to hint at Chinese collusion with Eurocommunism.
 The Albanians charged that the theory of the "three worlds"
 was similar to Eurocommunist concepts in that it served
 to confuse the proletariat and divert it from the class
 struggle, that thus contradicting the theory and practice
 of revolution and the teachings of Marxism-Leninism.

 16.   Even before Mao's death, relations between
 Tirana and Peking had been impaired by conflicting eval-
 uations of the importance of the Marxist-Leninist splinter
 parties.     In the early 1960s, the existence of these
 parties was symbolic of Peking's success in splitting up
 the previously cohesive pro-Soviet Communist movement.
 After the cultural revolution, the decline in China's
 ideological fervor and Chinese efforts to establish ties
 with West European governments lessened the importance
 of the Marxist-Leninist movement for Peking.   Contacts
 with foreign Marxist-Leninists during this period were
 left mainly to members of the radical faction in the
 Chinese leadership.
 17.   In contrast, the Albanians continued to regard
 the splinter parties as important allies.   By the mid-
 1970s, Tirana began to play an active role in providing
 organizational and ideological guidance to such groups,
 particularly those in Latin America and Western Europe.
 It sought,. successfully, to become the spiritual center
 of the Marxist-Leninist movement, the position earlier
 occupied by Peking.
 18.   Tirana's involvement with the splinter parties
 has further intensified this year.   The Albanians have
 used Marxist-Leninist groupings as surrogates in publicizing
 their opposition to China's foreign policies, and were
 successful in splitting some,of these parties.   Some
 splinter parties recently acknowledged the Albanian party
 as the sole leader of Marxism-Leninism and rejected Chinese
 policies that were not in accord with Marxist-Leninist
 principles.
 19.   Early this year the Chinese leaders became in-
 creasingly aware of the challenge.   The Chinese explained
 their policies to selected splinter parties and termed the
 Albanian line erroneous.   Peking now appears to be actively
 cultivating those splinter parties still loyal to it, and
 is countering Tirana's activity by setting up new groups
 with direct financial assistance from China.
 Motivations
 20.   Why Albania decided to challenge Peking cannot be
 conclusively determined from available evidence.   The
 Albanian actions appear less than prudent, in that their
 campaign could lead to a complete loss of Chinese economic
 assistance.   While there appears to be no single, over-
 riding motive, the following factors probably contributed
 to the decision.

 --Albania's fierce sense of independence rejects
 submission to or interference by any foreign power,
 even a close ally such as China or, formerly, the
 USSR.   Since the early 1970s China may have inter-
 fered in Albanian domestic affairs.   Earlier this
 year Tirana came close to hinting at Chinese com-
 plicity with the "anti-party" elements who were
 purged in recent years.
 --Albania may be acutely frustrated by the realiza-
 tion that its importance to China as an ally has
 been reduced.   The improvement in recent years of
 China's relations with Yugoslavia--whose revisionism
 is an anathema to the Albanian regime--has no doubt
 exascerbated Tirana's frustration.
 --The Albanians set great store in their pursuit of a
 "principled" foreign policy in the face of what the
 Albanians consider China's "opportunistic" approaches
 toward the West and particularly the US.
 --Albania is reacting to economic difficulties caused
 by the delays in Chinese assistance, which the
 Albanians associated with China's political oppor-
 tunism.
 --Ideological messianism prompts the regime to chal-
 lenge China as the leader of the Marxist-Leninist
 splinter movement.   They thus seek to replace the
 "adulterated" ideology of the Chinese leadership
 with Tirana's  "correct" Marxist-Leninist line.
 21.   Explanations for the Chinese motivations for
 tolerating the Albanian challenge are equally tentative.
 --Since the early 1970s, Albania has lost its impor-
 tance for China as its-sole ally and ideological
 supporter.  The Chinese probably feel that the
 present relatively low cost of assisting Albania
 is compensated for by the political advantage of
 retaining their limited presence there which also
 provides a deterrent to Soviet re-entry.
 --Having subdued its radical opposition, the new
 Chinese leadership perceives no immediate danger
 that Albania's ideological views will find a sig-
 nificant following in Peking.   Nor can Albanian
 criticism of China's foreign policies distract from

 the overall advantages of China's pragmatic
 foreign policy line.
 --In view of China's extensive contacts with other
 governments, Peking no longer considers support
 from the basically weak and ineffectual Marxist-
 Leninist parties as essential.   But since its
 continued ideological conflict with Moscow makes
 it necessary to portray the image of orthodoxy,
 China is embarrassed by the Albanian charges of
 political "opportunism."  With its superior finan-
 cial resources, Peking has been able to oppose the
 Albanian efforts to split the Marxist-Leninist
 splinter movement and is already setting up surro-
 gate puppet parties to advocate its policies.
 --Having demonstrated aloofness from the Albanian
 challenge, the Chinese have retained the option of
 striking back whenever it should appear convenient.
 Peking's initial response to Tirana is likely to
 be indirect, essentially a warning.   The Chinese
 may also take advantage of the Albanian feeler
 about direct talks by delaying an answer, or by
 appearing magnanimous in publicly accepting it.

 22.   Despite the appearance of political stability
 and totality of dictatorship, there is evidence of fer-
 ment within the Albanian leadership.   In the past four
 years a large number of high- and middle-level officials,
 including Politburo members, were ousted on trumped-up
 charges.   The purges, which were carried out in three
 phases, have decimated the cultural, military, and
 economic establishment.
 23.   The full meaning of these purges is obscure,
 but they seemed to involve the existence of high-level
 dissatisfaction with Hoxha's policies and concern over
 Albania's economic difficulties which have been aggravated
 by the decline in Chinese assistance.
 24.   The party leadership is aging.   Moreover, Hoxha's
 health and authority appear to have declined in recent
 months.   The leadership may be under pressure from younger
 persons--still unknown quantities to the West--who entered
 the highest party echelons in the wake of the purges.
 While a substantial impact on policy may not come soon,
 this new generation of leaders is already making its mark
 on the political scene.
 Phase One:  Cultural Purge
 25.   Despite its consistent efforts, the Albanian
 leadership has not been able to seal the country completely
 off from foreign influences.  The few instances of relaxa-
 tion of barriers to outside contacts only prompted an in-
 flux of more liberal trends and the regime quickly drew
 back.   The most recent such "opening," which occurred in
 early 1970s involved:   a party campaign to eliminate back-
 ward social concepts that in the end encouraged tendencies
 favoring change and liberalism; the climate of detente and
 accompanying relaxation between the US and the Communist
 nations; China's decreasing hostility toward the West and
 particularly its opening to the US in 1972; and the intro-
 duction of television in Albania.   This latter development--
 particularly the Yugoslav and Greek transmissions--allowed
 some Albanians to circumvent official censorship and acquaint
 themselves with foreign cultural trends.

 Approved For Release 2003/1t 1  i   DP79R00603AOQ2900070002-5
 26.   The party's ability to quickly close this
 opening and restore cultural and ideological orthodoxy,
 however, proved that the totalitarian nature of the re-
 gime had not been significantly weakened by the temporary
 impact of outside influences.  The first phase of the
 purges, in 1973, targeted on those held responsible for
 ''incorrect'' cultural policies.  Leading functionaries
 in the Tirana party organization, the state radio and
 television network, and the youth organization, were
 ousted.   The entire leadership of the Albanian Writers
 and Artists Union was also replaced.   Rigid cultural and
 ideological orthodoxy has been maintained ever since.
 Phase Two:   Military Purge
 27.        In 1974, the regime thoroughly purged the mili-
 tary establishment.   Since Albania's break with the So-
 viet Union,                        its defense capability had been dependent on
 Chinese supplies of military equipment.  Fluctuations in
 the flow of military assistance in the early 1970s--in-
 cluding no deliveries at all in 1973--probably caused
 uneasiness within the Albanian military establishment
 about their ability to resist aggression.   The Soviet
 Union's success early in 1974 in securing limited naval
 repair facilities in Yugoslavia--at Tivat, some 50 miles
 north of the Albanian border--probably reinforced doubts
 within the defense establishment about the adequacy of
 Albania's defense structure.
 28.   The real reason behind the purge of Defense
 Minister Balluku and his close associates in 1974 is
 unclear. Charges against them, including treason and
 collaboration with Moscow, are not convincing.  Balluku's
 close ties with the Chinese military leadership make it
 unlikely that he had sought to. replace Chinese assistance
 with Soviet weapons.   It is possible, however, that Bal-
 luku and other military leaders had recommended the
 broadening of economic and political ties with the West
 along the lines then being followed by Peking.   Such a
 proposal, coming from the military, could have been in-
 terpreted by party chief Hoxha as an attempt to undermine
 the party's control over the military.

 Phase Three:   Economic Purge
 29.   The third and most extensive phase of the
 purges hit the economic establishment.   It appears to
 have been directly related to the difficulties experi-
 enced by the economy during the 5th Five Year Plan
 period (1971-1975).
 30.   Despite large Chinese contributions in the
 form of complete plants and equipment, during the 5th
 FYP the country's economic growth declined.   The real
 extent of the decline is not known to us but the main
 indices of economic development for the 5th FYP period
 show generally lower percentages than those for the
 previous FYP period (1966-1970).   (Table)   The delays
 in Chinese assistance probably contributed to the down-
 ward trend of the economy.*
 31.   The full impact of the reduced assistance prob-
 ably became clear to Tirana's economic planners toward
 the end of the Plan period.   it may have prompted some
 members of the leadership to advocate counter-measures,
 such as lessening Albania's economic isolation from the
 rest of Europe.   Possibly alarmed by the political re-
 percussions of those initiatives, the Hoxha administra-
 tion launched a widespread purge of the Albanian economic
 establishment in 1975.
 Hoxha and the Party Leadership
 32.   The purges had initially seemed to strengthen
 the hands of the Party's ''old guard'' that was losely
 associated with first secretary Enver Hoxha.   Now in his
 69th year, Hoxha has been the acknowledged head of the party
 *  Among the largest projects the Chinese have built in
 Albania are the iron and steel complex in Elbasan,
 two oil refineries, a chrome ore processing plant, a
 nitrogen fertilizer plant, a superphosphate plant and
 a number of hydro-electric plants.   Last June, the
 Albanians publicly blamed delays in the construction
 of the Elbasan complex and the oil refinery in Ballsh
 on the failure of ''outside'' sources to delivery ma-
 chinery and materials.

 since it was founded in 1941.   His control of the state
 and party apparatus was secured by subsequent purges of
 political opponents of all hues.  The hard-core element
 of the leadership still forms the majority of the twelve-
 member Politburo.
 33.  There are indications, however, that in recent
 months Hoxha has encountered some opposition within the
 leadership and his position may have weakened.  Debate
 within the highest echelons of the party over economic
 priorities and consequent alternate courses is apparently
 continuing.   The new Albanian constitution, published in
 December 1976, revealed differences over the relative value
 of Chinese assistance and of self-reliance.  One faction
 had apparently managed to incorporate its views on the
 importance of self-reliance as the primary force in so-
 cialist construction without a corresponding reference
 to Chinese assistance.   Hoxha, for his part, continued
 to cite the importance of ''selfless'' Chinese aid, im-
 plying his disagreement with those advocating sole re-
 liance on the country's meager resources.
 34.  Hoxha's economic views--which show him as more
 of a realist than some of his colleagues--stand in sharp
 contradiction to his image as the challenger to the Chi-
 nese over the issue of ideological orthodoxy.   In any
 case, the divided economic councils raise the question
 whether the party leader, known to be in failing health,
 retains full control over the regime.
 35.  The ''old guard,'' although still active, has
 become just that--old.   Premier Mehmet Shehu, who has
 been generally considered Hoxha's chosen successor, is
 64.   His power was bolstered when he assumed the post
 of Defense Minister in 1974.   Shehu however,  also has
 medical problems that would appear to disqualify him
 from replacing Hoxha.
 36.  We have little information on the younger
 functionaries who now occupy leading positions in the
 state and government apparatus.  The Politburo has two
 new younger persons and there are quite a few on the
 Approved For Release 2003/1S0/29 :R CEARDP79R00603A002900070002-5
 SECR FT
 Approved For Rele se 2003/10/29 : CIA-RDP79R 0603A002900070002-5
 Central Committee.*  They were probably handpicked by
 Hoxha on the basis of their performance and personal
 loyalty.  While their backgrounds are obscure, one
 common denominator seems to be a shared experience in
 the provincial party apparatus.
 37. Despite the introduction of new people into
 the highest levels of the party and government, there
 has been no visible progress in solving the country's
 economic problems.   Moreover, the escalating differences
 with China could have a destabilizing effect on official-
 dom.   Having started their political careers in an era
 characterized by Albania's strong reliance on China,
 some of the younger leaders may be concerned about the
 consequences of provoking the Chinese.   Unlike the ''old
 guard,'' these leaders may also be less willing to make
 economic sacrifices for the sake of ideological ortho-
 doxy.
 38.  As long as Hoxha formally heads the party,
 Albania's political course is likely to reflect the
 ideological radicalism that has characterized it for
 two decades.  We cannot exclude the possibility, however,
 that once he departs, more pragmatic policies may be
 pursued.
 *   The two additions to the Politburo, Hekuran Isai and
 Pali Miska, are both believed to be in their 40s.
 Former provincial party functionaries,  they entered
 the government in the wake of the purges and rose
 rapidly.   In addition, four new functionaries have
 entered the Politburo as alternates since 1975.  On
 the new Central Committee, elected at the November
 1976 Congress, 43 of the 77 members are newcomers;
 18 of the 38 alternates are also new.

 III.   FOREIGN POLICY OPTIONS
 39.  With their relations with Peking deteriorating,
 the Albanians have been forced to consider their future
 foreign policy options.   These are limited.   The leader-
 ship's obsession with a Soviet threat to its security and
 its fierce anti-Americanism constrain its turning to
 either superpower for political or economic support.
 Neighboring Yugoslavia, which would be a natural economic
 partner, is ideologically unacceptable to the Albanians,
 and the Yugoslav's are wary of the Albanian minority and
 influence in their poorest border province of Kosovo.
 Recent efforts to improve relations with certain West
 European countries suggest that Tirana is seeking polit-
 ical support against the Soviets.   The regime's dogmatic
 opposition to democratic systems, however, is likely to
 prevent the development of closer political relations.
 Albania's inability to substantially increase its exports
 to industrialized countries or to accept Western credits
 is bound to prevent it from replacing China as the prin-
 cipal economic partner.
 Fear of Soviet Intervention
 40.   Since the break with Khrushchev, the Albanians
 have consistently viewed the Soviet Union as a threat to
 their security.   Despite recurring purges--which probably
 eliminated all elements sympathetic to Moscow--Tirana still
 insists the Soviets want to reestablish hegemony in Albania.
 The Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, which demonstrated
 Moscow's willingness to intervene militarily in East
 Europe, came as a further shock to the Albanian leadership.
 Tirana renounced Warsaw Pact membership*, and probably
 also ordered a thorough reevaluation of Albania's stra-
 tegic planning.   In addition to seeking more military aid
 from the Chinese, the Albanians made some attempt to re-
 duce their isolation from Balkan neighbors, including
 Yugoslavia, and explored contacts in Western Europe.
 41.   Having personally engineered Albania's break
 with Moscow and the Albanian alliance with China, Hoxha
 *  This was a symbolic gesture as Albania had not partici-
 pated in the Pact since the late 1950s.
 Approved For Release 2003/10S/29 :

 has been fearful that the Soviets might attempt to over-
 throw him. The regime's long-standing anti-Soviet propa-
 ganda campaign is aimed at instilling a permanent hatred
 of Soviet "social imperialism."  Although there is no
 evidence of any substantial Soviet attempt to undermine
 Hoxha, internal opponents  have almost invariably been
 accused of being pro-Moscow or, in the case of former
 Defense Minister Balluku, of joining the Soviets in a
 conspiracy against the regime.
 42.  Although it has diplomatic relations with all
 the East European states, Albania has since 1961 stead-
 fastly refused to reestablish contacts with the Soviet
 Union.*    It has also invariably rejected frequent offers
 by the Brezhnev leadership to improve relations.   A re-
 cent Romanian attempt to mediate--possibly encouraged by
 the Soviets--was also turned down by the Albanians.   Tirana
 uses its defiance of Moscow's "revisionistic" foreign poli-
 cies to demonstrate the correctness of its own ideological
 stance.   Ironically, in their polemics with Peking the
 Albanians have hinted that the Chinese have been following
 policies similar to those of the Soviets in the 1960s.
 43.  We do not expect Albania to begin a rapprochement
 with Moscow as long as Hoxha remains in power.   After his
 departure there may be an easing in hostility toward the
 Soviets, but Hoxha's heirs will still probably view Moscow
 as a lasting threat to Albania's independence.
 Tirana's relations with Moscow's East European allies,
 although correct, remain low key throughout this period.
 Romania's strained relationship with the Soviet Union
 and friendship with Peking helped create better rela-
 tions between Tirana and Bucharest, including exchanges
 of delegations and occasional party contacts.   There is
 evidence that in recent years Moscow tried--unsuccessfully--
 to use the Romanians as mediators in its dispute with
 Albanians.   Albania has maintained a modest level of
 trade exchanges with Warsaw Pact countries but none with
 the Soviet Union.   Although its exports to East European
 countries rose by 55 percent between 1971-1975, they may
 have remained stagnant, or even declined, in real terms.

 Yugoslavia
 44.   Hoxha bears a personal antipathy to Tito that
 originated in the Yugoslav leader's support for one of
 Hoxha's rivals during the immediate post-war period when
 Yugoslav influence with the new Albanian communist party
 was paramount.   Belgrade's plans to annex Albania were
 thwarted only because of the Soviet-Yugoslav split of
 1948, and Albanian paranoia about possible renewed Yugo-
 slav intervention has persisted.   The large Albanian
 minority in Yugoslavia's bordering Kosovo Province, and
 Tirana's periodic interventions on its behalf, also
 trouble Albanian-Yugoslav relations--the more so because
 Kosovo's poverty and political restiveness make the region
 a drain on and a vulnerability in the Yugoslav federation.
 45.   The antipathy is also ideological.   Ever since
 the 1948 Cominform resolution excommunicated Yugoslavia
 from the Communist camp, Albania's opposition to Yugoslav
 "revisionism" has not wavered.   The Khrushchev rapproche-
 ment in the mid-fifties and subsequent periods of improve-
 ment in Soviet-Yugoslav relations aroused suspicions of
 encirclement.   The commitment against "revisionism" miti-
 gated against a full normalization of relations with
 Belgrade despite Albania's and Yugoslavia's mutual condem-
 nation of the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia.
 46.   The Albanian leadership's opposition to Yugoslav
 "revisionism" can also be explained partly in terms of
 Tirana's relations with the Marxist-Leninist splinter
 parties.    In challenging Peking as the sponsor of the
 Marxist-Leninist movement, Tirana presents itself as the
 sole remaining defender of "correct" Communist dogma.   As
 long as Hoxha remains in power, ideological considerations
 alone will probably block normalization of Yugoslav-Albanian
 relations.
 47.   The Albanians probably believe that Tito's current
 visit to China will formalize Sino-Yugoslav rapprochement,
 and Tirana will no doubt increase its anti-Peking polemics
 as well as nourish this additional reason to mistrust
 Belgrade.
 48.   Albania's unrelenting hostility to the Yugoslavian
 form of Communism is ironic since non-aligned Yugoslavia has

 long provided a buffer between Albania and the Warsaw Pact
 nations. In addition, Belgrade's ideological differences
 with Moscow have curtailed the emergence of pro-Soviet
 forces in Yugoslavia that could present a threat to Albania.
 49.   Even though the Albanians revile Tito, Tirana
 must be disturbed by the thought of his eventual demise.
 Tirana would view any increase in Soviet influence in
 Yugoslavia during the post-Tito era as endangering Albania's
 security.   Moreover, possible Yugoslav apprehension over
 heightened Albanian irredentism in Kosovo Province after
 Tito's departure--a likely accompaniament of any post-Tito
 strains in Yugoslav federalism--could pose a serious problem
 for Tirana.
 50.   The ideological rigidity of the Albanian party
 has also inhibited economic contacts between the two coun-
 tries.   Although bilateral trade showed a seven-fold in-
 crease between 1970 and 1975, it has not reached its full
 potential.   For example, a planned railroad line, connecting
 the Yugoslav rail system with the main Albanian line, was
 not completed because of the uncertain political climate.
 There have been no new Albanian initiatives toward Belgrade
 in recent months, but the possibility of losing Chinese
 assistance could prompt the regime to try to increase its
 economic ties with Yugoslavia.
 Western Europe
 51.   Albania now has diplomatic relations with all West
 European nations except Spain, West Germany and the UK, and
 is currently trying to strengthen its existing contacts.   In
 doing so, Tirana is cultivating ties not only with non-
 aligned governments, but also with NATO members the Albanians
 perceive as independent of the US.*
 52.   The Albanians hope they will be able to establish
 closer economic ties to compensate for anticipated loss of
 economic assistance from Peking.   Their meager economic re-
 sources, however, permit only a modest expansion of exports
 Italy, with which the Albanian Communists have maintained
 a special relationship since the 1950s, is an obvious ex-
 ception.   That relationship stems from historical contacts
 and geographical proximity, and it has not been influenced
 by Italy's close political ties with the US.

 to the industrialized states.   Despite a five-fold in-
 crease between 1970-75, Albania's exports to the OECD
 countries amounted to no more than $50 million in 1975.
 53.   Moreover, as long as ideological extremism
 determines policy, Albania cannot conclude credit arrange-
 ments with the West.   The constitution forbids borrowing
 from "capitalist" countries and prohibits forming joint
 enterprises with foreign concerns.
 54.   These restrictions seriously hinder the importa-
 tion of foreign equipment necessary to maintain the indus-
 trialization program.          By sharply reducing machinery imports,
 Albania could probably purchase the most essential industrial
 and agricultural materials.   In the long run, however, this
 would inevitably have a negative impact on economic develop-
 ment.  Albanian planners are probably also aware that the
 West will not find it expedient to replace Chinese economic
 aid and technical advisers.
 55. There is also some evidence that Albanian over-
 tures to Western Europe involve political considerations.
 This may be Albania's tirst tentative   1    to tin  a new
 protector to replace China.   In view of the regime's ideo-
 logical incompatibility with democratic political systems,
 it is not clear what sort of political arrangement Tirana
 may hope to establish with West European governments.   The
 Albanians probably feel that the Mediterranean countries
 will want to take out some insurance against the
 bility of increased Soviet influence in Albania.
 Relations with the US
 56.   The Hoxha regime's attitude toward the United
 States has been unrelentingly hostile.   Hoxha and other
 Albanian leaders depict Washington as the world's leading
 reactionary power and a direct threat to Albania's security.
 This rhetoric includes elements of genuine uncompromising
 hostility to the US, as well as considerable ideological
 posturing.

 57.   Tirana went out of its way to rebuff US over-
 tures in the early 1970s.  We have seen no hint of any
 change in this attitude.   It would no doubt be awkward
 for the Albanians to make an overture to the US while
 criticizing the Chinese for doing the same thing.   A US
 connection, however, or the hint that one was in the
 making, might serve Tirana's interest in fending off any
 perceived threat from Yugoslavia and the USSR.
 58.   Although the Albanians are unlikely to pursue
 relations with Washington as long as Hoxha is in power,
 they could indirectly signal a moderation of their anti-US
 stand by deescalating criticism of Chinese-US contacts.
 Albania might be willing to purchase US-licensed equipment
 from Western European countries, pretending not to notice
 the American connection.   Tirana may also gradually modify
 the extremely hostile tone of its anti-US propaganda,
 without essentially changing its ideological opposition to
 the US.
