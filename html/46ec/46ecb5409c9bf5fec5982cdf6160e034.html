intelligence community is 
preparing for one of the most 
sweeping realignments since the 
Central Intellieence Agency (CIA)

Government's vast in-

make it more 
changes taking 
relations with 
Peking. 
responsive to 
place in U.S. 
Moscow and 
White House aides say the 
President hopes to accomplish 
these objectives in several ways.

With both Helms and Laird now 
leaving government, the President 
has once again dusted off the 
Schlesinger recommendation and 
now wants the former Virginia 
University economic professor to 
see if he can't implement it. 
The President would like to 
see Schlesinger test out some 
of the ideas he put in papers 
prepared while Director of 
Strategic Studies at the Rand 
Corporation, a government. 
financed "think tank" at Santa. 
Monica, Calif. 
These papers dealt exclusively 
with how systems analyses could 
be used to improve political, 
military, and intelligence decision-
making, and cost-cutting in these 
fields. While at the Hand Cor-
poration, Schlesinger also 
prepared a study on. the cost of 
nuclear-weapons proliferation 
which caught the President's eye.

;The impending resignation

I nation's top intelligence officer 
can in large part be traced to

But insiders already are 
e'Voicing skepticism that any 
;job outside the intelligence 
:?field could be anything but a 
comedown for Helms, who is 
:believed to have been anxious 
to stay on as CIA chief. 
A key element in this view is 
?the belief within the intelli-
gence community that Helms 
:had lost the confidence of the 
--White House?Kissinger espe-
cially. 
'.?? "Kissinger felt that Helms 
wasn't. so much trying to sun-
port ? the administration as 
playing politics on his own?
trying to keep his constituency

tablishment," one source ex-

.'bility in intelligence. intelligence assessmen t, 
championed by Laird, was the 
M a result of a sweeping 
reorganization of the intelli-
gence community in Novem-
ber 1971, Helms' official title, 
Director of Central Intelli-
gence, was expanded .to in-
clude new budgetary and orga-
nizational authority over the 
whole $5 billion a year U.S. 
intelligence effort. 
The origin of Kissinger's dis-
satisfaction with Helms is said 
to reside in an incident, early 
in 1969, in which Helms made 
an intelligence assessment in-
volving a fundamental ques-
tion of national security that 
was .sharply at odds with the 
view advanced by Pentagon 
intelligence experts an held 
privately in the White House. 
The incident was one of 
those rare oceurences when 
the latent disagreements in 
the intelligence community 
surfaced publicly, in this case 
in the persons of two rival 
chieftans, Helms himself and 
Melvin R. Laird, secretary of 
Defense. 
. At issue were the massive 
'Soviet SS-9 intercontinental 
ballistic missiles, whose exist-
ence as a new weapon in the 
Soviet arsenal became known 
to intelligence early in the ad-
ministration's first year. 
Liard testified before the 
Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee that the new mis-
siles, which are capable of 
carrying a much heavier pay-
load than anything deployed 
previously, meant that the So-
viet Union was going for a 
"first strike capability." 
About the same time, Helms 
let it be known that in his 
assessment the new missiles 
did not indicate a shift from 
the traditional emphasis on de-
fense, and that the smaller 
Minuteman-style SS-11 would. 
remain the backbone of the 
Soviet strategic missile arse-
nal. 
Judgement Was Key 
Later, in June :1969, both 
men appeared together before 
the committee in executive 
session, and their views were 
in some part' reconciled. 
Helms is said to have deferred 
25X1A 
one on which to base policy. 
The administration has sub-
sequently based some of its 
fundamental decisions in the 
nuclear strategy and national 
securityfields upon that intel-
ligence . judgement: They in-
clude: ABM, whether to go 
ahead with rapid development 
of multiple missile warheads, 
and basic negotiating positions 
in the ' strategic arms control 
talks with the Soviets. 
The Soviet Union has now 
clearly shifted to the SS-9 as 
its basic strategic weapon, and 
in this respect Helms' assess-
ment appears in retrospect to 
have been wrong. 
According to insiders, there 
have been other incidents, 
? similar but less spectacular, 
likewise involving an assess-
ment of Soviet strategic capa-
bility in which Helms and the 
Pentagon were at odds. In 
most of these, sources say, 
Kissinger has sided with the 
Defense Department. 
? The leading candidate to re-
place Helms is authoritatively 
reported to be James H. 
Schlesinger, chairman of the 
Atomic Energy Commission, 
and a chief architect of a 
study that shaped the intelli-
geace reorganization.

Now the re-elected President is moving on domestic problems. 
Ahead: efforts to overhaul Government, bring the budget under 
control, cut down on bureaucracy and avoid tax hikes. 
With a new mandate from the voters 
?but a Congress still controlled by the 
political opposition?President Nixon in-
tends to press for far-reaching reforms 
in Government agencies and programs 
? during his second term. 
The President has said:? 
"I honestly believe that Government 
in Washington is too big, and it is too 
expensive. We can do the job better 
with fewer people." 
?the outcome of this effort may de-
pend the burden of federal taxes, the 
impact of inflation on the cost of living, 
the value of the American dollar, and 
the availability of money and credit for 
business expansion. 
Action agenda. In the fortnight im-
mediately following his re-election, Pres-
ident Nixon took these actions: 
.? Signaled a firm determination to 
'shake up the organization of the exec-
utive branch of Government from the 
White House on down. 
O Called for resignations of about 
2,000 presidential appointees, it 
Cabinet officers and White House aides. 
Many vill be retained. Some will be 
shifted to new jobs. Others will be 
dropped. 
? Conferred with top advisers includ-
ing Vice President Spiro T. Agnew at 
Key Biscayne, Fla., or Camp David, 
Md., ? on plans for Administration per-
sonnel, policies and programs in the new 
term. Mr. Agnew has been the President's 
liaison man with Governors, mayors and 
local officials around the country. 
-? Recalled Roy L. Ash, president of 
Litton industries and former head of 
the President's Advisory Council. on Ex-
ecutive Organization, to assist in the 
structural planning. 
? Consulted John B. Connally, former 
Texas Governor who led the Democrats-
for-Nixon drive in the recent campaign. 
Mr. Connally was a key member of the. 
Ash Council, before serving as Treasury 
Secretary in the first Nixon term. 
O Set December 15 as -a target date. 
for announcing personnel and policy de-
cisions in overhaul of the Govermnent. 
Associates say the President will be 
guided by recoMmendations of the Ash 
Council, which conducted a two-year 
study of Government operations in 
1969-1970. 
The advisory group submitted about 
16 separate reports. Many remain con-
fidential memoranda for the President. 
Others were published at the time Mr. 
Nixon first called for wholesale Govern-
ment reorganization in his 1971 state-
of-the-union message. 
"Most Americans fed up." The 
President said then that "most Ameri-
cans today are simply fed up with gov-
ernment at all levels." 
The Ash Council found that the Gov-
ernment has grown up in a topsy-turvy 
fashion, adding people and ? programs 
without any consistent pattern, and with 
a great deal of overlapping and dupli-
cation among agencies. 
As a result, Mr. Nixon told Congress 
in January, 1972, "Our Federal Govern-
ment today is too often a sluggish and 
unresponsive institution, unable to de-
liver a dollar's worth of service for a 
dollar's worth of taxes." 
Here are major reforms proposed by 
the Ash Council, as revised by the 
White House in the last two years: 
New super-Departments, A half doz-
en Departments of Cabinet rank and a 
score of lesser agencies would be con-
solidated into four new super-Depart-
ments along modern, functional lines. 
A White House documentary On the 
subject said that "the executive branch 
should be organized around major pur-
poses of Government." 
The new super-Departments would 
deal with domestic problems in these 
areas: human resources, ? natural re-
sources, community development and 
economic affairs. 
Programs dealing- with people?such 
as education, :welfare, health, manpow-
er training, social security and unem-
ployment insurance?would tome under 
a Human Resources Department. 
Other programs?those dealing with 
urban renewal, rural development, city 
planning, hospital construction, mass-
transit systems and urban highways?
RMENT

MENT-REORGANIZATION PLAN." 
would be assigned to a Department of 
Community Development. 
A Natural Resources Department 
would guide land use, soil conservation, 
energy sources and minerals, vat-er re-
sources and marine technology, public 
works, recreation and civilian atomic 
energy. 
Under an Economic Affairs Depart-
ment would come many existing func-
tions of the Commerce, Labor and 
Transportation Departments, along with 
the Tariff Commission and Small Busi-
ness Administration. 
The Agriculture Department would 
be retained as a separate entity, but 
would be limited to dealing with farm-
commodity production and marketing - 
programs. Its present operations are. 
much broader. 
These Federal Departments would be 
abolished: Interior; Commerce; Labor; 
Health, Education and Welfare; Hous-
ing and Urban Development, and Trans-
portation. 
Originally, the Ash Council proposed 
.to leave intact the existing Departments 
of State, Treasury, Defense and Justice. 
Recently, President Nixon reportedly 
has been focusing on shaking up the 
State Department, leading to specula-

that President Nixon is 
'determined to pursue jibe

reform in the control of 
the bureaucracy. 
??:- The President wants to

' ments of n.overnmen ? r -

cording to a top adviser. It 
.is along-standing concern 
? that has been heightened

? President feels about such 
? reform indicated by? ?

? chief -adviser for .domestic-

" Nu:Hellman complained 
in an interview that as it is 
? now, many ? Cabinet deP?u-
tics ?ire sworn in "and 
then the next time you see 
them is at the Christmas' 
Party. They go off and 
marry the natives.."? 
In less :colorful terms, 
Ehrlichman believes that 
.,,.there is a tendency for de-
partment officials, includ-
ling Cabinet officers, to be 
"'heavily influenced by the 
thinking and the momen-
tum?or lack thereof?of 
the existing staff and-oper-
ations of their own depart, 
ments.. 
"There shouldn't be a Int. 
of. leeway in following the 
President's policies," he 
said. "it shot.fld be like 
a corporation, where the 
executive vice presidents 
.(the Cabinet officers) are 
tied closely to the chief ex-
ecutive, or to put it. in ex-
treme terms, when he says 
Jump, they only ask how 
high." 
Goal Is Unity 
Ehrlichman is not ruling 
rut give and take. Rather, 
he is looking for a unity 
and consistency of -pur-
pose that would enable the 
Administration to estab-
lish more precise goals 
and have the various de-r 
piArtments implement 
them more rapidly. 
How to bring this about 
has not been entirely laid 
out. 
But Ehrlichman, 'whose --
job at times has been to 
call in Cabinet officers and 
chief deputies to express 
P r C sidential displeasure 
with actions seemingly far 
afield from presidential 
policy, will likely play a

In proposing the plan 
the President complained 
that- the federal govern-

it does not deliver' what it 
promises." Power is "ex-

for either the Congress or

ALL NATIONS REPOP,770 MONITORED 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP) --
Government officials have de-
clined comment on a Ram-
parts magazine article which 
says U.S. intelligence can pin-
point the location of Soviet 
military and spacecraft and 
can break all the Soviet mili-
tary codes. 
? A White House spokesman in 
Gan Clemente, Calif., the De-
partment of Defense in Wash-
ington and a spokesman for 
? he National Security in?-;eney 
at Ft. Meade, Md, would not 
respond, to the article, entitled 
"U.S. Tspionage: A Memoir." 
The article, appearing in 
Ramparts' Augnst issue which 
went on new?stands today, is 
based on an interview with a . 
man purported to be a former 
NSA analyst. 
The ex-analyst, identified by 
a spokesman for the magazine 
as ''Winslow Peck," pseu-
eonyin ---- is quoted as saying 
high-flying jets routinely make 
flights over Russian territory 
to test Soviet reactions. 
? Others Deny Account 
While the Defense Depart-
ment refused comment, as is 
customary in intelligence mat-
ers, other knowledgeable 
sources denied that U.S. 
planes fly over Russia gather-
ing intelligence data. 
The sources said the United 
States has not relied on intelli-
gence flights over Soviet and 
Communist Chinese territory 
since the earlyy 1960s, because 
it has sent aloft reconnaiss-
ance satellites, which transmit 
pictures and monitor radio 
and other communications 
forms. 
. Contacted in San Diego at a 
telephone number supplied by 
Ramparts, a man' who said he 
was "Peck," 26, refused to 
give his real name but said he 
was assigned too NSA for 3' 
years after enlisting in the Air 
Force in 1936. lie said lie lives 
in Washiligton, D.C., but now 
is on-vacation in California. 
He said he was sergeant 
when he quit, because he was 
disillusioned in Vietnam. 
MonitAring Cited 
The Ramparts article said 
the United States monitors ev-
ery government in the world, 
including its allies, and listens 
in on all transatlantic tele-
phone calls to or from this 
country, even those by private . 
citizens. 
The monitoring includes dip-
lomatic communications of al-
lies ? including interception - 
of British communications 
through monitoring conducted 
at U.S. 'oases in England, Peck 
said. 
"As far as the Soviet Union 
is concerned \ cc know the 
whereabouts at any given time 
of all its aircraft, exclusive of 
small private planes, and its 
naval forces, including its mis-
?,iiet-firing submarines," the 
former analyst said inthe 
'The fact is that we're able 
to break every code they've 
got, understand every type of ' 
communications equipment 
and enci p her in g device 
they've got," he added. 
The Magazine said NSA, es-
ta'alished in 1952, employes 
about 15,00 servicemen and 
civilians at its Ft. Meade 
headquarters and about 90,000 
at?otmd the world. NSA's main 
mission is code cracking and 
communications intelligence. 
In the article the former an-
alyst said that 90 percent of all 
"v iable U.S. intelligence" 
comes from NSA-monitored 
communications. 
Some who were. asked to 
comment about the story said 
Peck seemed to claim far 
more knowledge than he could 
have gained in an enlisted ca-
pacity. 
The New York Times report-
ed that a veteran of 30 years' 
service in intelligence said of 
Peck: 
"Ile's obviously familiar 
with the NSA ? its organiza-
tion, operations and many of 
its techniques. But no sergeant 
in his early 20s would know 
how intelligence is handled at 
the White House level, what 
NSA material is used or dis-
carded by the President or 
more than jest the fringes 
about CIA oparatimis," 
David Hahn, author of "The 
Codebreakers" and a leading 
authority cm crypthanalysis, 
sai(1. in a telephone interview 
that the ramparts article 
"represents much new infor-
mation that ? rings true to, me 
and seems correct," However, 
he challenged some points, 
specifically Peek's assertion 
that the agency's experts are 
able to "break every SOviet 
code with remarkable suc-
cess." 
Top-grade Soviet foreign 
ministry code systems "have 
been unbreakable ,since teh 
1930s," Kahn said. He added 
that it was "highly unlikely 
that ? they have switched to 
breakable codes.!'

Intelligence Oversight 
CIA: CONGRESS IN DARK ABOUT ACTIVITIES, SPENDING 
Since the Central Intelligence Agency was given 
authority in 1949 to operate without normal legislative 
oversight, an uneasy tension has existed between an un-
informed Congress and an uninformative CIA. 
In the last two decades nearly 200 bills aimed at 
making the CIA more accountable to the legislative 
branch have been introduced. Two such bills have been 
reported from committee. None has been adopted. 
Some members of Congress insist they should know 
more about the CIA and about what the CIA knows. 
Clandestine military operations in Laos which were run 
by the CIA provided Congress with an opportunity to 
ask questions about the intelligence operation during 1971. 
(Congress and Laos, p. 68) 
Sen. Stuart Symington (D Mo.), a member of the 
Armed Services Intelligence Operations Subcommittee 
and chairman of the Foreign Relations subcommittee 
dealing with U.S. commitments abroad, briefed the 
Senate June 7, 1971, behind closed doors on CIA involve-
ment in Laos. He based his briefing on a staff report. 
He told the Senate in that closed session: "In all my 
committees there is no real knowledge of what is going on 
in Laos. We do not know the cost of the bombing. We do 
not know about the people we maintain there. It is a 
secret war." 
As a member of two key subcommittees dealing with 
the activities of the CIA, Symington should be privy to 
more classified information about the agency than most 
other members of Congress. But Symington told the Sen-
ate he had to dispatch two committee staff members to 
Laos in order to find out what the CIA was doing. 
If Symington did not know what the CIA was doing, 
then what kind of oversight function could Congress 
exercise over the super-secret organization? 
A Congressional Quarterly examination of the over-
sight system exercised by the legislative branch, a study 
of sanitized secret documents relating to the CIA and 
interviews With key staff members and members of Con-
gress indicated that the real power to gain knowledge 
about CIA activities and expenditures rests in the hands 
of four powerful committee chairmen and several key 
members of their committees?Senate and House Armed 
Services and Appropriations Committees. 
The extent to which these men exercise their power 
in ferreting out the details of what the CIA does with its 
secret appropriation determines the quality of legislative 
oversight on this executive agency that Congress voted 
into existence 25 years ago. 
The CIA Answers to... 
As established by the National Security Act of 19-17 
80-233), the Central Intelligence Agency was ac-
countable to the President and the National Security 
Council. In the original Act there was no language which 
excluded the agency from scrutiny by Congress, but also 
no provision which required such examination. 
To clear up any confusion as to the legislative intent 
of the 1947 law, Congress passed the 1949 Central Intel-
ligence Act (PL 81-110) which exempted the CIA from all 
federal laws requiring disclosure of the "functions, names, 
official titles, salaries or numbers of personnel" employed 
by the agency. The law gave the CIA director power to 
spend money "without regard to the provisions of law 
and regulations relating to the expenditure of govern-
ment funds." Since the CIA became a functioning organi-
zation in 1949, its budgeted funds have been submerged 
into the general accounts of other government agencies, 
hidden from the scrutiny of the public and all but a se-
lect group of ranking members of Congress. 
THE SENATE 
In the Senate, the system by which committees 
check on CIA activities and budget requests is straight-
forward. Nine men?on two committees?hold positions 
of seniority which allow them to participate in the regular 
annual legislative oversight function. Other committees 
are briefed by the CIA, but only on topical matters and 
not on a regular basis. 
Appropriations. William W. Woodruff, counsel 
for the Senate Appropriations Committee and the only 
staff man for the oversight subcommittee, explained that 
when the CIA comes before the five-man subcommittee, 
more is- discussed than just the CIA's budget. 
"We look to the CIA for the best intelligence on the 
Defense Department budget that you can get," Woodruff 
said. He said that CIA Director Richard Helms provided 
the subcommittee with his estimate of budget needs for 
all government intelligence operations. 
Woodruff explained that although the oversight 
subcommittee was responsible for reviewing the CIA bud-
get, any substantive legislation dealing with the agency 
would originate in the Armed Services Committee, not 
Appropriations. 
No transcripts are kept when the CIA representative 
(usually Helms) testifies before the subcom.mittee. Wood-
ruff said the material covered in the hearings was so 
highly classified that any transcripts would have to be 
kept under armed guard 24 hours a day. Woodruff does 
take detailed notes on the sessions, however, which are 
held for him by the CIA. "All I have to do is call," he 
said, "and they're on my desk in an hour." 
Armed Services. "The CIA budget itself does not 
legally require any review by Congress," said T. Edward 
Braswell, chief counsel for the Senate Armed Services 
Committee and the only staff man used by the Intelli-
gence Operations Su hcom mit tee.

The role of the Armed Services Committee is not to 
examine the CIA's budget, Braswell said, but rather to 
review the programs for which the appropriated funds pay. 
Symington told Congressional Quarterly in early 
1972 that the Armed Services oversight subcommittee had 
not met for 18 months, but that Chairman John C. Sten-
nis (D Miss.) had been taking care of the subcommittee's 
business by himself primarily. 
"The people who run the CIA budget are the five 
senior members of the Appropriations Committee," 
Symington said. That included both Stennis and Mar-
garet Chase Smith (R Maine), ranking minority member 
of the Armed Services Committee. (Box p. 19) 
"I can find out anything from Mr. Helms (CIA direc-
tor) that I want to find out because we're friends, but 
that's not the proper way to do it," Syrhington continued. 
"As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee 
and the ranking member of the Armed Services Commit-
tee I am denied the details of the money being spent by 
the Central Intelligence Agency." Symington would not 
deny that he knew details of the CIA budget, only that he 
was denied the information when he went through proper 
committee channels. 
"The budget is gone into more thoroughly than 
people (on the committee) would admit," Braswell ex-
plained. "It's just reviewed in a different way than, say, 
the State Department's budget is." The committee's 
chief counsel said the budget review was conducted by 
a "very select group...more select than the five-man 
subcommittee." 
Foreign Relations. Since the CIA never has been 
recognized officially as an agency involved in making 
foreign- policy, the operations of the agency have not 
regularly been scrutinized by the Foreign Relations Corn-
mittee. The Armed Services Committee reviews the 
agency's program annually because threats to the United 
States, against which the CIA guards, traditionally have 
been military in nature. The Appropriations Committee 
checks on the CIA's budget because the committee ex-
amines all money requests of government agencies; the 
CIA provides valuable intelligence on Pentagon programs 
about which the committee has an interest. In 1967 the 
Foreign Relations Committee became a newcomer into 
the circle of CIA-knowledgeable committees. 
In the spring bf 1967, secret CIA aid for student activ-
ities became the cover story for Ramparts magazine. The 
national press picked up the story and soon it became 
widely known that the CIA had been contributing money 
to the National Student Association (NSA) and other 
tax-exempt foundations and was playing more than 
casual role in jockeying CIA personnel into leadership 
Positions in the various organizations. 
The response in Congress to the NSA story was the 
introduction of seven bills in one month?all aimed at 
allowing Congress a closer look at the CIA. One pro-
posal, sponsored by Sen. Eugene j. McCarthy (I) Minn. 
1959-71), would have involved an investigation of the 
CIA by a select committee armed with subpoena. 
power. A proposal to set up a similar oversight and investi-
gating committee had been killed in 1966 on a procedural 
ruling regarding committee jurisdiction. With the new 
series of embarrassing CIA revelations, the McCarthy 
proposal posed a threat to the long-standing oversight 
system.

'I Have Not Inquired' 
The following exchange was excerpted from the 
Nov. 23, 1971, Senate debate over a floor amend-
ment to place a $4-billion annual ceiling on U.S. 
intelligence activities. 
Allen J. Ellender (D La.). chairman of the 
Appropriations Committee and head of its five-man 
Intelligence Operations Subcommittee, discussed his 
knowledge of CIA-run operations in Laos with J. W. 
Fulbright (D Ark.) and Alan Cranston (I) Calif.). 
Fulbright: "Would the Senator (Ellender) say 
that before the creation of the army in Laos they 
(the CIA) came before the committee and the com-
mittee knew of it and approved it?" 
Ellender "Probably so." 
Fulbright: "Did the Senator approve it?" 
Mender: "It was not--I did not know anything 
about it." 
Fulbright: "So the whole idea of Congress de-
claring war is really circumvented by such a proce-
dure, is it not?" 
Ellender: "Well, Mr. President, I wish to Say 
that?" 
Fulbright: "Is it not?" 
Ellender: "No, I do not think so." 
Fulbright: "Well, if you can 'create an army and 
support it through the CIA, without anyone knowing 
about it, I do not know why it is not..." 
Ellender: "I wish to say that I do not know. I 
never asked, to begin with, whether or not there were 
any funds to carry on the war in this sum the CIA 
asked for. It never dawned on me to ask about it. I 
did see it publicized in the newspaper some time 
ago." 
Cranston: "...the chairman stated that he never 
would have thought of even asking about CIA funds 
being used to conduct the war in Laos....I would 
like to ask the Senator if, since then, he has inquired 
and now knows whether that is being done?" 
Ellender: "I have not inquired." 
Cranston: "You do not know, in fact?" 
Ellender: "No." 
Cranston: "As you are one of the five men privy 
to this information, in fact you are the number-one 
man of the five men who would know, then who would 
know what happened to this money? The fact is, 
not even the five men know the facts in the situation." 
Ellender "Probably not.'' 
Don Henderson, a Foreign Relations Committee 
staff member, said that in an effort to undermine support 
for the McCarthy bill, the Foreign Relations Committee 
was invited to send three members to all CIA joint 
briefings held by the Armed Services and Appropriations 
Committees. The original members were J. W. Fulbright 
(D Ark.), Mike Mansfield (D Mont.) and Bourke B. 
Hickenlooper (R Iowa), who was replaced by George 
Aiken (R Vt.) when Hickenlooper retired in 1968. 
Woodruff, counsel for the Appropriations Committee, 
said that the committee had not met jointly on CIA busi-
ness with the Appropriations Committee for at least one 
year. "Maybe it's been two years," he said. "l'in not sure."

CONGRESSIONAL CONTROL 
CIA Director Helms, however, appeared before the 
Foreign Relations Committee for special briefings in 1971 
and 1972. 
"I have known," Fulbright told the Senate during the 
June 7 closed session, "and several (other) Senators have 
known about this secret army (in Laos)., Mr. Helms testi-
fied about it. He gave the impression of being more can-
did than most of the people we have had before the 
committee in this whole operation. I did not know enough 
to ask him everything I should have...... 
THE HOUSE 
Two committees in the House acknowledge that 
they participate in oversight of the CIA?Armed Services 
and Appropriations. The Armed Services Committee has 
a five-man subcommittee reviewing the programs of all 
intelligence organizations. The Appropriations Committee 
refused to say who on the committee reviews the CIA 
budget. 
Armed Services. A subcommittee formed in July 
1971 filled a hole on the committee that was left since 
F. Edward Hebert (D La.) reorganized the Armed Ser-
vices Committee and abolished the CIA Oversight 
Subcommittee that had been run by the late L. Mendel 
Rivers, chairman of the committee until his death Dec. 
28, 1970. 
I-lebert's plan' was to democratize the committee by 
allowing all to hear what the CIA was doing instead of 
just a select group of senior members. Freshman commit-
tee member Michael Harrington (D Mass.) said that 
Hebert was making an honest attempt to spread the 
authority, but the full comthittee CIA briefings were 
still superficial. "To say that the committee was per-
forming any real oversight function was a fiction," 
Harrington said. 
When Helms came before the full committee, Har-
rington asked what the CIA budget was. Helms said that 
George Mahon (D Texas), chairman of the Appropriations 
Committee, had instructed him not to reveal any bud-
get figures unless Armed Services Chairman Hebert 
requested the information. Hebert said "no'' according to 
Harrington and the budget figures were not disclosed. 
As in the Senate, the House Armed Services Commit-
tee is responsible more for what the CIA does than how 
tnueh it spends, according to the committee's chief 
counsel, John R. Blandford. The Armed Services Com-
mittee does not meet jointly for CIA briefings with the 
Appropriations Committee or with the Foreign Affairs 
Committee, Blandford said. 
The new subcommittee, responsible for reviewing 
all aspects of intelligence operations, was put under the 
leadership of Lucien N. Nedzi (I) Mich.)?a leading 
House opponent of the Indochina war and critic of Penta-
gon spending. Hebert said he chose Nedzi "because he's a 
good man, even though we're opposed philosophically." 
Hebert 's predecessor as committee chairman, Mendel 
Rivers, regarded the oversight subcommittee as so im-
portant he named himself as subcommittee chairman. 
Nedzi said that Hebert had placed no restrictions on how 
the subcommittee should be run or what it should cover. 
Appropriations. In interviews with two staff mem-
bers of the House Appropriations Committee, Congressional 
Quarterly learned that the. membership of the intelli-
gence oversight subcommittee was confidential. When

been.' Ralph Preston, a staff man for the Defense Sub-
committee, said the information was a secret, but ad-
mitted that more members than just Chairman Mahon 
were responsible for reviewing the agency's budget. 
Rep. Harrington said he has requested the compo-
sition of the subcommittee and has been refused the in-
formation. "I'm just sure the CIA committee consists of' 
the five ranking members of Mahon's subcommittee on 
defense," Harrington said. (Box this page) 
Quality of Congress' Oversight 
Because most members of Congress have not been 
aware of what the CIA was planning until long after the 
agency had already acted, more than one Senator or 
House member has made embarrassing statements out of 
line with fact.

Former Sen. Wayne Morse (D Ore. 1945-69), a 
member of the Foreign Relations Committee, took the 
Senate floor April 20, 1961?five days after the Cuban 
Bay of Pigs invasion?and said: "There is not a scintilla 
of evidence that the U.S. government has intervened in 
the sporadic rebellion which has occurred inside Cuba. 
That rebellion has been aided from outside by Cuban 
rebel refugees who have sought to overthrow the Castro 
regime." 
Four days later Morse admitted: "We now know 
that there has been a covert program under way to be of 
assistance to the Cuban exiles in an invasion of Cuba and 
that assistance was given by the United States govern-
ment. We did not know at the legislative level, through 
the responsible committees of the Senate, what the pro-
gram and the policies of the CIA really were." 
The Morse speech, delivered nine days after the 
Bay of Pigs invasion, was the first mention in either the 
House or Senate of U.S. involvement in the invasion at-
tempt. 
While explaining the details of the Central Intelli-
gence Act of 1949, former Sen. Millard E. Tydings (D Md. 
1927-51) said in a May 27, 1949, floor speech: "The bill 
relates entirely to matters external to the United States; 
it has nothing to do with internal America. It relates to 
the gathering of facts and information beyond the borders 
of the United States. It has no application to the domestic 
scene in any manner, shape or form." 
Committee investigations into tax-exempt founda-
tions in 1964 produced an informal report issued by Rep. 
Wright Patman (D Texas) labeling the Kaplan Fund as 
a conduit for CIA money. The fund described its purposes 
in its charter as to "strengthen democracy at home." 
Patman later agreed to drop the committee investigation 
saying, "No matter of interest to the subcommittee re-
lating to the CIA existed." 
In the spring of 1967, another example of domestic 
CIA programming emerged as it became known that the 
National Student Association was receiving money from 
the CIA and that the agency had been involved in manip-
ulating the leadership of the student organization. 
Laos. Another illustration of congressional ignor-
ance of CIA activities was in the series of revelations 
which came from the June 7, 1971, closed Senate session 
briefing on Laos requested by Symington. 
Three times during the two-hour session, Symington, 
a member of the Armed Services subcommittee on CIA 
oversight, said that although he knew the CIA was con-
ducting operations in Laos, he did not know how exten-
sive the program was. 
"Nobody knows," Symington said, "the amounts the 
CIA is spending while under orders from the executive 
branch to continue to supervise and direct this long and 
ravaging war (in Laos)." 
Minutes after Symington said that in all of his sub-
committees?which included the Armed Services Intel-
ligence Subcommittee under the chairmanship of John C. 
Si enn is ( I) M is. ) --there was no real knowledge about 
what is going on in Laos." Stennis took the floor and said: 
"The CIA has justified its budget to our subcommittee 
and as always they have come with expenditures right 
in line with what they were ant horized expressly to 
do....They (CIA) have told us from time to time about 
their activities in Laos."

Intelligence Reorganization 
In a move to trim costs and improve the output of 
the U.S. global intelligence system, President Nixon 
Nov. 5, 1971, disclosed details of a reorganization 
plan for the nation's intelligence program. The plan 
contained the following changes: 
? It gave authority to Richard Helms, Director of 
Central Intelligence, to review the budgets of the 
CIA, the FBI, units within the Defense and State De-
partments and the Atomic Energy Commission. It was 
believed 81-billion could be cut from the 85-billion to 
86-billion the U.S. spends yearly to ascertain Soviet 
and Chinese Communist military developments. 
? It created a new intelligence subcommittee under 
the National Security Council to tailor the results 
of the nation's vast overseas intelligence network 
closer to the needs of the President and his top staff. 
. ? It created a "net assessment group" inside the 
National Security Council to compare over-all 
U.S.S.R. forces and capabilities with those of the U.S. 
? It created an Intelligence Resources Advisory 
Committee headed by Helms to advise on the pre-
paration of a consolidated program budget. This would 
permit Helms to see the Department of Defense in-
telligence budget?estimated to be 80 percent of 
everything the U.S. spends for intelligence?and ad-
vise on it before its submission. 
"It has been said that we ll know about what the 
CIA is doing," Fulbright retorted. "I have been on the 
CIA oversight committee and I have never seen any de-
tailed figures (on Laos) whatever." 
Stennis said that the secret report on CIA activity 
in Laos, compiled by Foreign Relations Committee staff 
members, contained some information he was not familiar 
with, information he had not been told in his capacity 
as chairman of the Armed Services Intelligence Opera-
tions Subcommittee. 
"I think we all know," Stennis said, "that if we are 
going to have a CIA, and we have to have a CIA, we 
cannot run it as a quilting society or something like 
that. But their money is in the clear and their forthright-
ness, I think, is in the clear." 
Sen. Miller criticized Symington for saying the 
Congress was appropriating money blindly: "We should 
not leave the impression that the Senate somehow or 
other has been helpless in this matter. We are all mature 
individuals and we know what we are doing.... 
"But let us not say the Senate has been hoodwinked 
or leave the impression we have been misled and have 
not known what is going on. I think ?Ve may have lacked 
information on the specifics, and the Senator (Symington) 
is pulling out information on specifics, but. the Senators 
who voted on these appropriations for the CIA voted for 
them with our eyes wide open, knowing what we were 
doing. Maybe we should change it. It is something tOr 
future debate." 
"I would be the last to say he (Miller) had been 
hoodwinked," Sym ington com men ted, "or that any 
other member of the Senate had been hoodwinked. But 
I have been hoodwinked, and I want the Senate to know 
this afternoon that that is the case."

Mr. Marchetti was on the director's staff of the CIA when 
he resigned front the agency two years ago. Since then, his 
novel The Rope-Dancer has been published by Grosset & 
.Dunlap; he is now working on a book-length critical analysis 
of the CIA. 
The Central Intelligence Agency's role in U.S. foreign af-
fairs is, like the organization itself, clouded by secrecy 
and confused by misconceptions, many of them deliberately 
promoted by the CIA with the cooperation of the news 
media. Thus to understand the covert mission of this 
agency and to estimate its value to the political leadership, 
one must brush myths aside and penetrate to the sources 
and circumstances from which the agency draws its au-
thority and support. The CIA is no accidental, romantic 
aberration; it is exactly what those who govern the country 
intend it to bd?the clandestine mechanism whereby the 
executive branch influences the internal affairs of other 
nations. 
In conducting such operations, particularly those that 
are inherently risky, the CIA acts at the direction and with 
the approval of the President or his Special Assistant for 
National Security Affairs. Before initiating action in the 
field, the agency almost invariably establishes that its oper-
ational plans accord with the aims of the 'administration 
and, when possible, the sympathies of Congressional lead-
ers. (Sometimes the endorsement or assistance of influen-
tial individuals and institutions outside government is also 
so.ught.) CIA directors have been remarkably well aware 
of the dangers they court, both personally and for the 
agency, by not gaining specific official sanction for their 
covert operations. They are, accordingly, often more care-
ful than are administrators in other areas of the bureau-
cracy to inform the White Hous,e of their activities and to 
: seek Presidential blessing. To take the blame publicly 
for an occasional operational blunder is a small price to 
pay in return for the protection of the Chief Executive and 
the men who control the Congress. 
The U-2 incident of 1960 was viewed by many as an 
outrageous blunder by the CIA, wrecking the Eisenhower-
Khrushchev summit conference in Paris and setting U.S.-
Soviet relations back several years. Within the inner circles 
of the administration, however, the shoot-down was 
shrugged off as just one of those things that happen in the 
chancy business of intelligence. After attempts to deny 
responsibility for the action had failed, the President openly 
defended and even praised the work of the CIA, although 
for obvious political reasons he avoided noting that he had 
authorized the disastrous flight. The U-2 program against 
the USSR was canceled, but work on its follow-on system, 
the A-11 (now the SR-71,) was speeded up. Only the 
launching of the reconnaissance satellites put an end to 
espionage against the Soviet Union by manned aircraft. 
The A-11 development program was completed, neverthe-
less, on the premise that it, as well as the U-2, might be 
useful elsewhere.

The reorganization of the U.S. intelligence commu-

the clandestine action arm of American foreign policy. 
Most of the few changes are intended to improve the finan-
cial management of the community, especially in the mili-
tary intelligence services where growth and the technical 
costs of collecting information are almost out of control. 
Other alterations are designed to improve the meshing of 
the community's product with national security planning 
and to provide the White House with greater control 
over operations policy. However, none of that implies a 
reduction of the CIA's role in covert foreign policy action. 
In fact, the extensive review conducted by the White House 
staff in preparation for the reorganization drew heavily on 
advice provided by the CIA and that given by former 
agency officials through such go-betweens as the influential 
Council on Foreign Relations. Earlier in the Nixon Admin-
istration, the Council had responded to a similar request 
by recommending that in the future the CIA should con-
centrate its covert pressure tactics on Latin American, 
African and Asian targets, using more foreign nationals as 
agents and relying more on private U.S. corporations and 
other institutions as covers. Nothing was said about reduc-

Marines New Chief 
Looks Toward Future 
[Chicago Tribune Press Service] 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 4--Gen. 
Robert E. Cushman Jr., newly-
installed commandant of the 
Marine Corps and former Cen-
tral Intelligence Agency deputy 
director, said today that 
United States intelligence can 
do its job for less money and 
probably will be obliged to. 
Cushman, speaking at a Pen-
tagon press conference, said 
"the mood of Congress" as he 
reads it is that the intelligence 
operations cost too much and 
fund cutbacks can be expected. 
Must Know Stopping Poiut 
He said he believed intelli-
gence can do the job for less 
money by knowing when to 
stop collecting facts. He added 
that while those engaged in in-
telligence always feel they 
never have enough facts, they 
have to stop somewhere. 
The big problem, he contin-
ued, is knowing where to stop 
and making sure that one 
stops there. 
He said, however, that good 
management will insure call-
ing a halt at the right place I 
and, he was sure Richard / 
Helms, CIA director who re-V 
cently was given expanded re-
sponsibility in the intelligence 
field, will make sure that the 
agency does not go too far. 
Asked the size of the U. S. 
intelligence budget, Cushman 
said he was not free to say. 
Tells Marines Roles 
On the subject of the Marine 
Corps' role under the Nixon 
doctrine in which U. S. allies 
will be expected to provide the 
men for their own defense 
while the U. S. supplies arms 
and, perhaps, sea and air pow-
er, Cuchman said he could 
foresee no situation in which 
Marines would be used for ex-
tended ground combat, such as 
Viet Nam. 
However, he said, there may 
be occasions when Marines 
kl have to be sent in tempo-
rarily to seize and hold strate-
gic foreign territory or evacu-
ate Americans from trouble 
spots.

THE CIA AND DECISION-MAKING 
By Chester L. Cooper 
"The most fundamental method of work ... is to determine our working policies a 
cording to the actual conditions. When we study the causes of the mistakes we have made, 
we find that they all arose because we departed from the actual situation ... and were 
subjective in determining our working policies."?"The Thoughts of Mao Tse-tung." 
IN bucolic McLean, Virginia, screened by trees and sur-
rounded by a high fence, squats a vast expanse of concrete 
and glass known familiarly as the "Pickle Factory," and 
more formally as "Headquarters, Central Intelligence Agency." 
Chiselled into the marble which is the only relieving feature of 
the building's sterile main entrance arc the words, "The Truth 
Shall Make You Free." The quotation from St. John was 
personally chosen for the new building by Allen W. Dulles over 
the objection of several subordinates who felt that the Agency, 
then still reeling from the Bay of Pigs debacle, should adopt a 
.somewhat less lofty motto. (In those dark days of late 1961, some 
suggested that a more appropriate choice would be "Look Before 
You Leap.") But Dulles had a deeper sense of history than 
most. Although he was a casualty of the By of Pigs and never 
? sat in the Director's office with its view over the Potomac, he / 
left a permanent mark not only on the Agency which he had 
fashioned but on its building which he had planned. . 
Allen Dulles was famous among many and notorious among 
some for his consummate skill as an intelligence operative 
("spook" in current parlance), but one of his greatest contribu-
tions in nurturing the frail arrangements he helped to create to 
provide intelligence support to -Washington's top-level foreign-
policy-makers. 
Harry Truman, whose Administration gave birth to both the 
National Security Council and the Central Intelligence Agency, 
recalls that, "Each time the National Security Council is about 
.to consider a certain policy?let us say a policy having to do 
with Southeast Asia?it immediately calls upon the CIA to 
present an estimate of the effects such a policy is likely to 
have. . . .1 President Truman painted a somewhat more cozy 
relationship between the NSC and the CIA than probably 
existed during, and certainly since, his Administration. None 
the less, it is fair to say that the intelligence community, and espe-
cially the CIA, played an important advisory role in high-level 
policy deliberations during the I9505 and early 1960s. 
To provide the most informed intelligence judgments on the 
effects a contemplated policy might have on American na-
tional security interests, a group especially tailored for the task 
was organized in 1950 within the CIA. While this step would 
probably have been taken sooner or later, the communist victory

In late November the Central Intel-
ligence Agency conducted a series of 
"senior seminars" so that some of its 
important bureaucrats could consider 
its public image. I was invited to 
attend one session and to give my 
views on the proper role of the 
Agency. I suggested that its legitimate 
activities were limited to studying 
newspapers and published statistics, 
-listening to the radio, thinking about 
? the world, interpreting data of recon-
naissance satellites, and occasionally

hid been led by conversations with a 
number of CIA officials to believe that 
they were thinking along the same 
lines. One CIA man after another 
eagerly joined the discussion to assure 
me that the days of the flamboyant 
covert operations -' were over. The 
upper-class amateurs of the OSS who 
stayed to mastermind operations in 
/Guatemala, Iran, the Congo, and else-
where-Allen Dulles, Kermit Roosevelt, 
Richard Bissell, Tracy Barnes, Robert 
Amory, Desmond Fitzgerald-had died 
or departed. 
In their place, I was assured, was a 
small army of professionals devoted to 
preparing intelligence "estimates" for 
the President and collecting informa-
tion the clean, modern way, mostly 
with sensors, computers, and sophis-
iticated reconnaissance devices. Even 
Gary Powers, the U-2 pilot, would now 
be as much a museum piece as Mata 
'Hari. (There are about 18,000 em-
ployees in the CIA and 200,000 in the 
entire "intelligence community" itself. 
The cost of maintaining them is some-
where between $5 billion and S6 
billion annually. The employment 
figures do not include foreign agents or 
mercenaries, such as the CIA's 100,000-
man hired army in Laos.)

Special to The New York Ttroes 
WASHINGTON, Dec. 29 ? 
President Nixon is reported to 
be considering the appointment 
of an Army major general, Ver-
non A. Walters, to be the next 
deputy Director of Central In-
telligence. 
General Walters, who is now 
defense attach?t the Embassy 
in Paris, would succeed Lieut. 
Gen. Robert E. Cushman Jr. of 
the Marine Corps, according to 
United States and foreign of-
ficials here. General Cushman 
has been named by President, 
Nixon to be next commandant 
of the Marine Corps and is 
scheduled to take. command 
Friday. 
Spokesmen for the White 
House, State Department anus 
the C.I.A. declined comment on 
the report concerning General 
Walters. Nonetheless, reliable 
informants said that the gen-
eral, who has had extensive ex-
perience as an interpreter with 
both President Eisenhower and 
with President Nixon, was in 
line to be second-ranking of-
ficial at the agency. 
President Nixon's reorganiza-
tion of the United States Gov-
ernment agencies involved in 
foreign intelligence, announced 
Nov. 5, provided an "enhanced 
leadership role" for Richard 
licims, Director of Central In 
Lenience. At the time, intel-
ligence sources said that Mr. 
Helms would concentrate eval-
uating foreign intelligence for 
the President and on budget 
and management problems of 
the intelligence "community" as 
a whole. 
Day-to-Day Control 
The 'Deputy Director, they 
said, would take over more of 
the day-to-day operations of 
the C.I.A., including control ofi 
clandestine collection of intel-
ligence through secret agents 
and such eleetronic techniques 
as spy satellites and code-
cracking. 
Informants here noted that 
General Walters had served as 
Mr. Nixon's interpreter during 
the recent meeting with Presi-
dent Pompidou of France in the 
Azores. General Walters also 
served as interpreter for Presi-
dent Nixon early this month 
during the visit of President' 
Emilio G. M6dici of Brazil. 
General Walters, whose nick-
name is Dick, is widely known 
for his extraordinary linguistici 
gifts. He is fluent in French, 
German, Spanish, Italian, Portu-
guese, Dutch and Russian. He 
also speaks some Arabic and 
Greek. Languages are his 
hobby. 
He was born in New York 
March 3, 1917, and grew up in 
Europe, where his father, an 
American businessman, lived. 
He attended French schools, 
and was graduated from Stony-
hurst College in England. He 
enlisted in the Army on May 2, 
1941. 
During World War II he was 
commissioned and assigned as 
a liaison officer with the 
Brazilian forces fighting in the 
'rifted States Fifth Army in 
Italy under Gen. Mark W. 
Clark. His language abilities 
brought him to General Clark's 
attention and ultimately to the 
attention of Gen. Alfred M. 
Gruenther, Fifth Army chief of 
staff. 
As defense attach?n Paris 
and previously in Rio .de Jan-
eiro, General Walters is a senior 
officer of the Defense Depart-
ment's Intelligence Agency in 
both rank and experience. He 
also has a 20-year knowledge 
of North Atlantic Treaty Organ-
ization problems. 
Under the National Security 
Act of 1947, which created the 
C.I.A. the positions of director 
and deputy director cannot be 
held simultaneously by military 
officers on active duty. 
Richard Helms, who was 
named Director of Central In-
telligence in 1966, is the first 
career civilian intelligence of-
ficer to have risen to the na-
tion's top intelligence position. 
The tradition, however, is to 
name a military deputy when 
the director is a civilian ? and 
vice versa.

a question: "Confronting one of the 
most passion-laden, persistent and

to neglect the CIA's advice. They 
may have been overwhelmed by the 
successes of the United States, princi-

he should be overruled. But he can-
not be ignored quite so easily as was

the United States is the only country in the 
world which lists its central intelligence 
agency in the telephone book, and enables 
anyone to call up and speak to the director's 
Office. 
- But an extraordinary exchange on the floor 
of the Senate recently made clear how little 
else the people who put up the money for in-
telligence know about how it's spent. The 
debate took place on the day the military ap-
propriations bill was finally pasaed so it at-
tracted little attention, but it was revealing. 
It was provoked by Sen. Stuart Symington 
(D-Mo,) who offered an amendment provid-
ing that not more than $4 billion in the de-
;fense budget could go for the intelligence 
!services, including the CIA, the National Se-
curity Agency and the intelligence branches 
,of the various armed services. Symington's 
:point was not only to set a limit, but to set a 
'precedent. 
cross 
. CONGRESS does appropriate all the 
money that goes to intelligence, but it 
doesn't know how much, or even when and 
how. That's because it is hidden in the de-
fense budget, with the result that Congress 
doesn't really know just what it is appropri-
ating any military money for because it 
never knows which items have been selected 
for padding to hide extra funds for intelli-
gence. 
? Evidently, Symington believes that the ac-
tual amount spent is a little over $4 billion, 
tntsead of the $6 billion reported in the 
press, because he wasn't trying to cut intern-
( gence funds except for CIA payments to 
I Thai soldiers in Laos. He is one of the nine 
senators entitled to go to meetings of the 
Appropriations Subcommittee on the CIA, 
supposedly the confidential watchdog over 
the agency. As he pointed out though, there 
:hasn't been a full meeting all this year. 
What he wanted to do was to establish 
that Congress does have some rights to mon-
itor the intelligence empire which it created 
by law, and he was driven to the attempt be-
cause of exasperation at President Nixon's 
;recent intelligence reorganization. It was an-
By Flora Lewis 
en Congress lials 
flounced to the public as an upgrading of 
CIA Director Richard Helms and a better 
method to avoid waste and establish politi-
cal control. 
Senator Symington and many other 
well-informed CIA watchers in Washington, 
are convinced that Helms has been kicked 
upstairs. The result, they believe, will be an 
Increase in military influence over intelli-
gence?which has been recognized as a dan-
ger throughout the history of intelligence 
because it tends to 'become self-serving, the 
doctor diagnosing himself according to the 
therapy he likes. 
There is also a concern that the reorgani-
zation, which makes the President's National 
Security Adviser Henry Kissinger top dog 
over intelligence, will centralize the system 
so much that It will become a tool for White 
House aims, not an outside source of techni-
cal expertise. 
Responsible political control over the in-
telligence community's actions, as distinct 
from its factual and analytical reports, is 
necessary and desirable. But despite the 
public impression, in the last few years the 
CIA has been the most honest source of in-
formation for Congress on sensitive issues 
such as Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia, while 
the Pentagon, State and White House have 
dealt in obfuscations. Whatever his Depart-
ment of Dirty Tricks might be doing, Helms 
has been more straightforward with his se-
cret session testimony on what is really hap-
pening in these unhappy places than the 
peoplewho do have to explain and justify 
their funding to Congress. 
c+4 
BUT, as the Senate debate showed, that 
Isn't saying very much. Sen. Allen Ellender. 
(D-La.), who heads the CIA subcommittees 
pointed out that 20 years ago only two sena- ? 
tors and two-congressmen were allowed to ? 
know what the CIA was spending, and now 
there are five on each side of the Capitol, 
He implied that they also knew what the 
CIA was spending its money for, Sen. Wil-
Ham Fulbright (D-Ark.), had the wit to ask 
if that mean Ellender knew, before the CIA v 
set up its secret army in Laos, that this was-
the purpose of the appropriation. Ellencler 
said, "It was not, I did not know anything 
about it . . . it never dawned on me to ask 
about it." 
Sen. Alan Cranston (D-Calif.), had the, 
humor to point out that there has been a lot 
in the press about the CIA Laotian army in v 
the past couple of years, and asked whether 
Ellender has now inquired about it. El lender 
said, "I have not inquired." Cranston 
pointed out that since nobody else in Con-
gress has Ellender's right to check the CIA, 
that meant nobody in Congress knows. El-
lender replied, "Probably not." 
Symington's amendment was defeated.' 
But at least the record is now clear. A re-
cent Newsweek article quoted a former CIA 
official as saying, "There is no federal, 
agency of our government whose activities 
receive closer scrutiny and 'control' than the 
CIA." 
"The reverse of that statement is true," 
said Symington, "and it is shameful for the 
American people to be misled." The record'* 
proves him right.

. The White House will be the subject of two major tele-
vision specials this month, one on CBS dealing with the 
Christmas season and the other on NBC covering a day in 
the life of the President. 
NBC's special, titled "Dec. 6, 
1971: A Day in the Presidency," 
will be presented next Tuesday, 
front 7:30 to 8:30 p.m., with John 
Chancellor as host. It will cover 
President Nixon through an entire 
work day, focusing on every 
meeting on his schedule, includ-
ing the first part of a top-level 
session of the Washington Special 
Action Group of the National 
Security Council. 
This segment will show the 
President discussing the Indian-
Pakistani war with Secretary of 
----'-"'l ; 
dent Agnew; presentation of 
diplomatic credentials by ambas-
sadors from indone.sia, Morocco, 
Pakistan and Portugal, and a 
meeting of the QuadriaA the 
President's four major economic 
advisers. 
Chancellor said that for se-
curity reasons NBC cameras were 
excluded from a part of every 
meeting. "Among the unsched-
uled events that occured during 
the day," he said, "was a visit 
from. Nixon's daughter, Julie Ei-
senhower. 
CBS' special "Christmas at 
the White House," will, be tele-

Renven Frank, president of 
NBC News, said this is the first 
time the White House has given 
permission to film a program of 
this type. "We have been asking ' 
to do a show on the Presidency 
since 1948," he said. "We got the 
go-ahead in mid-November after 
several meetings with John Scali, 
a special consultant to the 
President." 
The President's work day on 
the day of filming (Dec. 6) began 
at 7:45 a.m., with a breakfast for 
congressional leaders, and ended 
shortly before 11 p.m., following 
a dinner for Canadian Prime

Manchester Guardian Service 
(S c o t t, who has just 
moved from Washington to 
Paris, reflects on 8f..; years 
.as the Guardian's corre-
spondent in the U.S. capi-
tal.) 
Looking back over the past 
8/2 years in which I have 
lived in the United States, I 
find that my strongest 
'impressions are largely criti-
cal. This is perhaps some- ? 
what surprising since I leave 
the country with a good deal 
of affection and admiration 
for its people. They are cer-
tainly very different from 
ourselves. More different than 
one assumes on arrival. The 
fact that we have a roughly 
:common language and have 
been taught to regard each 
other as cousins induces false 
vassumptions of similarities. 
, After a few years' resi-
dence in the United States, 
? one realizes, if one had not 
.done so before, that there is 
? for want of a better phrase 
? a "European Way of Life," 
'compounded from things both 
spiritual and material, which 
is 'important to one. This is 
, absent in North America, and 
exists as much in England as 
in France 'or in Italy. An 
Englishman might conceiva-
? by be homesick in France, 
but he could not languish for 
the same reason as he may in 
America ? for nostalgia for 
? that indefinable quality that 
Is Europe. 
The question most frequent, 
: ly put by Europeans to their 
compatriots living in the Unit-
ed States confirms the real 
, existence of violence in that 
country. How great, really, is 
the danger of lAinc, beaten 
on the street, PP }45I  r 
; robbed? The statistics, ,.cff, 
coffie, Show that there is in-
deed a far higher incidence of 
crime and violence in the 
United States than in any Eu-
ropean country. But just how 
much is one conscious of this 
in one's daily life? 
Violence on. streets 
'One can speak only for one-
self. A French friend says 
that he never knew real fear 
before coming to live in New 
York, even during the years 
fighting in the Maquis. That 
was not my own experience 
in Washington. Yet Washing-
ton is the only city in which I 
have lived where my. own 
I riends and acquaintances 
were among those who had 
been beaten, raped, yes, even 
murdered. It would be wrong, 
however, to say that I was 
daily, or more than occasion-
ally, conscious of the need foi 
caution and even more rare 
ly of actual fear. 
It was not something thqt 
preoccupied one. Subc o 
sciously, no doubt, the anxie-
ty was there. One learned to 
take precautions ? normally 
of a- negative character ? al-
most without re alizing it. 
There were st r ee t s, even 
'areas, where one did not loi-
ter after dark; some where 
one would not dream of pass-
ing- through on foot ? scarce-
ly even in daytime ? nor 
readily in a car at night. So 
one didn't. 
It was only When one was 
out of the country that one 
realized in sudden flashes the 
extent to which one's person-
al freedom was curtailed by 
the extent of violence in the 
United States. I recall Walk-
ing back to my hotel with a 
ur col 
Agrn SA 
Inner ? in London .khis. year, 
well after midnight'. It sud-
denly came to me that this 
was something I would never 
have done in Washington.? 
Complex government 
In the. area of politics, per-
haps my outstanding impres-
sion is of the infinite com-
plexity of the American sys-
tem. This complexity seems 
to arise partly from the vast 
size and variety of the coun-
try and its population; partly 
because of the checks and 
balances established by the 
founding fathers in the writ-
ten constitution, and the para-
mountcy which these give to 
the executive, the legislature, 
and the judiciary, each within 
its own sphere. 
The federal character of 
the Constitution, the fairly 
wide powers remaining to the 
individual states, the division 
of government into thr ee 
equal branches, tends to com-
plicate and to weaken the 
c en tr al administrAtion in 
Washington. This is particu-
larly so when the President's 
party does not control Con-
gress, as has been the ease 
since Nixon came to the 
White House. The American 
president's need for caution, 
compromise, and consensus is 
normally far greater than 
that of the British prime min-
ister. His potentie power is 
far greater than that of the 
British prime minister. His 
potential power is far great-
er, but his actual power to 
act assertively often may be 
less. 
Government in the United 
States is complicated not only 
because of the complete se-
paration of the executive and 
the legislative branches with 
dures followed by .the latter, 
and the massive,- cumber-
some size of the former. Jeal-
ousies between the Congress 
and ? the White House, exist 
also between the various gov-
ernment departments. This 
resfilts hi widespread overlap-
ping and duplication of func-
tions. 
In the field of intelligence 
and security, for example, 
the area of responsibility re-
mains substantially undefined,/ 
as between thic....GLArisederal 
Bureau of investigation, State 
Department, Pentagon, and 
White House. They each 
maintaji their own sources 
and lines of communications. 
The proliferation of civil ser-
vants is so great that most of 
them seem to pend'. most of 
their time in-' committee tell-
ing each other what they 
have been doing or plan to. 
do. 
In London, if you wanted to 
know what the British govern-
ment's policy is on any given: 
subject, you can be fairly: 
sure of getting it from the 
department concerned ? if: 
they will talk at all. In Wash-
ington, almost everyone is 
ready to talk ? but you are 
apt to receive' several differ-
ent and of ten conflicting 
answers to your questions, 
but from within the same de-
partment. 
Legal system :creaks 
The passage of a bilf 
through Congress is devious 
and slow, and subject to in-
numerable pitfalls. A commit-
tee chairman like Rep. Wil-
bur Mills, D-Ark., has more 
real power than have most 
members of the Cabinet. And

DEC B 1971' 
Is Pentagon Crying -\\ 
'Wolf' In Cutbacks? 
Government bureaus when faced with a budget cut have 
away of raising an alarm by predicting all sorts of dire con- . 
sequences. 
For example, the Pen tagon warned this week that some . 
parts of the world may be left uncovered by its military in 
telligence apparatus ? spies, if you will ? because of a 
projected cut of 5,000 jobs. 
That sounds ominous, until one realizes the Pentagon now 
has 139,000 persons working for it in its intelligence organiza-
tions alone. . 
One place the Pentagon could safely cut back is in its sur-
veillance of civilians. Americans were properly shocked not 
' long ago at disclosures that the military was actually spying 
: on civilians ? a- practice generally reserved for totalitarian 
countries. 
So it's hard to accept at face value Assistant Secretary of 
Defense Robert Froehlke's prediction that "we are going to 
have to accept the risk of nct having complete information 
- on some parts of the world." 
Senator John Stennis, chairman of the Armed Forces : 
Committee, raised a strenucus objection when he declared: "At . 
the present time, it is almost as though the dropping of a leaf 
in the far Pacific elicits a report." Stennis says he doubts that . 
the Pentagon can make effective use of all the intelligence it I 
now receives. ? ,,I 
No one disputes the fact that the U.S. needs a large 
enough intelligence apparatus to keep it informed of potential ., 
. i 
dangers. Anything less would be unthinkable. 
How much the Pentagon's activities duplicate those of . 
the Central Intelligence Agency is difficult to know, since 
both operations are top-secret. But certainly Congress should , 
probe overlapping activities and cut out useless duplication. 
i 
At the same time the Pentagon cannot escape the 
\ 
responsibility of using its forces efficiently. And bigness, par-
icularly in a bureaucracy, has seldom been known for its 
eIft iciencv.

Sun-Times Bureau 
WASHINGTON ? President Nixon plans to 
name Atomic Energy Commission Chairman 
James R. Schlesinger as the director of the 
Central Intelligence Agency, reliable sources . 
reported Saturday. ? 
Schlesinger, a 43-'y ear-old management and 
budget expert, is scheduled to replace career 
CIA operative Richard M. Helms early in 
Mr. Nixon's second term, which begins Jan. 
20. - 
Like several of the President's recent high-
level appointees. Schlesinger reportedly has

job, from which he cannot be legally removed 
until June 30, 1070. Nonetheless, Mr. Nixon's 
wishoatire again expected to prevail. 
Helans' departure represents another bu-
reaucratic triumph for Henry A. Kissinger 
ho has been critical of the CIA's work and 
who now stands to strengthen his control over 
the intelligence community.

a close collaborator, was named under-
secretary of state and the President retained 
William P. Rogers rather than choosing a 
more assertive secretary of state. 
Kissinger's influence may similarly be ex-
tended at the Pentagon where Helmut G. Son- . 
nenfeldt, a long-time associate and current 
member of .his White House staff, is under 
consideration as assistant Defense secretary. 
for international security affairs. 
At the CIA, Schlesinger could be expected? 
at least initially to concentrate on managing 
the huge budget and bureaucracy with Kis-
singer overseeing the flow of. intelligence. The 
,CIA.director has charge not only of the CIA 
but also of all the civilian and military, in-. 
telligence branches, which employ more than 
250,000 persons and spend approximately $.5 
billion a year. 
Kissinger reportedly has directed a series 
of complaints against the CIA. In particular. 
he is said to ?have accused Helms and the 
agency of falling to give adequate advance 
warning of the massive North Vietnamese of-
fensive last spring. 
CIA officials insist that their reports were 
complete and accurate. and that Kissinger 
should have drawn the proper warning from 
the reports. Other officials who followed the 
reports agree but Kissinger's assessment 
evidently was persuasive to the President. 
CIA sources said they were unaware of any 
presidential displeasure with Helms. They

iated to his age and fineneial problems than 
his performance on the jch. They said Helms, 
n nrnfonen1 inmilluonce efficer for 30 
years with the OSS and the CIA. has inspired 
a high level of morale among the career offi-
cials at the top of the agency. 
But they reported Helms has set a rule that 
leading CIA officials should retire at 60 and 
he will reach that age next March. In addi-
tion, friends said a divorce settlement and 
remarriage four years ago left him in diffi-
cult financial straits. 
A motive in leaving the CIA, they stig--
gested, was to get a job in Private business 
drawing a salary higher than. his current 
-$42,500 a year. 
Schlesinger'S departure from the AEC is 
sure to be well received by the oil industry 
which has. been wary of his plans to move 
forcefully into the energy crisis with atomic 
_power plants. It is also likely to be pleasing .to. ' 
environmental groups which have opposed 
him on licensing standards. 
Schlesinger came into office- in July, 1971; 
? with a declaration that the AEC would no . 
longer serve as a defender and promoter of 
nuclear power but rather as a prctector of 
public safety and the. environment. 
He has subsequently pushed atomic devel-
opment, however, arguing that environmental 
opponents failed to prove their case. 
Officials at the AEC and the White House 
give him high marks for efficiency, in-
telligence. public relations and political 
'awareness. Those are qualities which could 
serve him well at the CIA which, in addition

, Schlesinger served as assistant director of the 
Office of Management and Budget under 
Geoli?ge Shultz, who was reappointed Friday 
as secretary of the Treasury and given the 
expanded job of chief economic manager for 
the President. Schlesinger's ?close relations 
with Shultz should give him leverage in the

Better Deal 
for Service Spooks? 
WHITE HOUSE SOURCES tell The 
JOURNAL that the intelligence rear-
ganjzation announced last month by the 
President means a better deal, not less 
authority--as the country's press has 
been reporting?for members of the 
defense intelligence Community. 
? Among the specifics cited: ? 
?o More "supergrades" (GS-16 to 
GS-18 civilian billets) for Defense Intel-
ligence Agency. 
o Assignment of top-caliber military 
personnel to DIA (which in past years 
has had trouble getting the most quali-
fied Military personnel assigned to it 
and proper recognition for their work in 
? intelligence fields); 
ci Better promotion opportunities 
for intelligence?zcialysts (who in the past 
.have seldom been able to advance to top 
management levels without first break-
.- ing out into administrative posts that 
make little use of their analytical capa-
bilities). 
This lase point sterns from a major 
White House concern with the nation's 
intelligence product: "95% of the em-
phasis has been on collection', only 55 
on analysis and production," as one 
White House staffer describes it. Yet 
good analyst?s,.he points out, have faced 
major hurdles in getting recognition and 
advancement. Moreover, they have been 
"overwhelmed" by the amount of raw 
data collected by their counterparts in 
the more glamorous, more powerful, 
and better rewarded collection fields. 
The supergrade probl9m has been of 
special concern tc; the White House. A 
high Administration official, who asked 
not to be named, told The JOURNAL 
that the "White House [has] pledged to 
get Civil Service Commission approval" 
fe,r a GS-18 billet which had been 
urgently requested by DIA Director 
LGen Donald V. Bennett. Bennett, he 
said, first requested the billet more than 
a year ago. Even though DIA has not, 
Our. Outgunned Spies 
'A QUICK JOURNAL SURVEY of government-wide supergrade authorizations shows 
clearly that the Service side of the intelligence community, and DIA in particular, has 
been "low man on the supergrade totem pole" and makes clear why the White 'House 
Intelligence reorganization is aimed, in part at least, at giving Service "spooks" better 
recognition and more attractive career opportunities. Here are typical (in some cases, 
ludicrous) comparisons that can be drawn from Part II of the Appendix to the Fiscal 
Year 19 72 Budget of the United States, a 1,112-page tome which gives, by federal 
agency, a detailed schedule of all permanent Civil Service positions: 
O DIA has 3,088 Civil Service employees, but only 15 supergrades?roughly one for 
every 200 spooks. 
O 12oD's Office of Civil Defense has 721 Civil Service personnel, but 27 supergrades?
one for every 27 employees, a ratio eight-to-one better than DIA's. 
O The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, with only 776 civil servants, 
has 36 supergradcs'---one out of every 22, nine times better than DIA. The Peace Corps 
also outguns DIA nine to one, with 52 Foreign Service billets in the GS-16 to GS-18 
salary brackets for only 1,188 permanent federal positions. 
O The National Security Council staff has a 23-to-one advantage, 73 staffers and nine 
supergrade (or higher) billets. Even NSC's one-to-nine supergrade-to-staff ratio, however, 
pales by comparison with the President's Office of Science and Technology, which has 23 
superposts but only 60 people! 
Here's how the supergrade-to-people bean count for key federal agencies compares 
with D IA's (where authorized, executive level I through V posts are included in 
supergrade count):

had any authorization fora'8, it 
took almost 10 months for the papers 
needed to justify the single high-level 
slot to filter through lower echelon 
administrative channels in the Pentagon 
before they could be forwarded, with a 
"sti'ong endorsement" from Deputy De-
fense Secretary David Packard, to the 
Civil Service Commission. 
Ironicat.ly, just one .day after The 
JOURNAL was told of the White 
House's determination to help get the 
billet approved, it was learned that the 
Civil Service Commission had neverthe-
less denied the request. Instead, it of-
fered DIA a choice of having an addi-
tional GS-17 slot or of having a Public. 
Law 313 post (which would require that 
DIA first recruit an incljvidtial highly 
qualified enough to justify the appoint-
ment). 
DIA's supergrade structure, neverthe-
less, is going to improve dramatically. 
For at least three years, the agency has 
been authorized only 15 supergrades, 
but will get 24 more under a. plan just 
endorsed by Dr. Albert C. Hall, DoD's 
new Assistant Secretary for intelligenc.e. 
The posts are known to be endorsed 
strongly by both Defense Secretary Mel-
vin Laird and Deputy Defense Secretary 
David Packard, ?and apparently enjoy 
strong backing from the White House. as. 
well. ? 
By going from 15 to a total 
?supergrade billets, DIA will be able not 
only to recruit higher caliber civilian 
personnel .but to promote more of its 
own qualified analysts into these covet-
ed, higher paying posts. 
Pres Mies the Point 
Pres.s reporis on the intelligence reor-
ganization convey a much different pic-
ture than the above highlights and White 
House sources suggest. In a 22 Novern, 
ber feature, U.S. News & World Report 
noted in a lead paragraph that "The 
? Pentagon appears to be a loser in the 
latest reshuffle." Deputy Defense Secre-
tary David Packard is probably the man 
most responsible for such interpreta-
tions. In a 4 November meeting with 
Pentagon reporters, just one day before 
the White House announced that CIA 
Director Richard Helms was being given 
new, community-wide responsibilities 
with authority over all intelligence bud-
gets, Packard said: "There have been 
people thinking if we just had someone 
over in the White House to ride herd on 
this overall intelligence , that things 
would be improved. I don't really sup-
port that view. ... I think if anything 
we .need a little less coordination from 
that point than more ...."

...Congress must monitor CIA operations 
mittee is supposed to review CIA op6ra-
tions and . funding. Unfortunately, it lsel-
dom meets except to confer congressional 
blessings on CIA affairs, This congres-
sional abdication of its. responsibility for 
exercising a positive role in the formation 
of national policy reduces it to a rubber 
stamp for an omniscient executive. This 
has virtually been the case in foreign 
affairs since the National Security Act of 
1947 unified the services and created the 
National Security Council and the CIA. 
An efficient intelligence operation is 
vital to the interests of the American 
people. ,But the operation does not always 
serve the interests of the people when it 
strays into political and military activities. 
such as the formation of coups d'etat,. 
direction of clandestine wars and the 
practice of political assassination. 
President Nixon's changes appear to 
offer increased efficiency, and in Helms 
the President seems to have a supervisor' 
who is.pre-eminently concerned with gath-
ering and evaluating intelligence data. But 
only a vigilant and responsible Congress 
can serve to restrain the executive branch 
of government from abusing the vast 
power and influence available to it 
through these necessarily covert intelli-, 
gence activities.? 
President Nixon's irritation at the qual-
ity of information coming to him from the 
nation's fragmented intelligence appara-
tus is understandable. However, his ef-
forts to streamline operations, while wel-
come, are not without hazard to the 
balance of power between the executive 
and legislative branches of the federal 
government.

Helms, director of the Ceq1. Intelligence

" To the extent that the President- has 
;made the intelligence operation more effe-
eient and responsive?as indeed it should 
be ? he has increased the security of the 
-United States. But he will also have 
further eroded Congress' role in formulat-

of government does not balance executive 
? access to unlimited intelligence data with 
more intensive congressional scrutiny of

The .American intelligence comrinini-
ty sinc'e long before World War II has 
L been, and remains to a .large degree, 
a many splintered. thing. Every agency 
needing fresh, accurate and secret infor-
mation on. which to formulate its plans 
and actions has developed its own set of 
spies. This. lack of coordination and. -co-
. hesiveness has .become apparent with 
:..sortle disasters, most. notably the Pearl 
. ? Harbor attack of Dec, 7, 1941, and a lot 
of embarassments such as the Bay of 
Pigs debacle and more recently the abor-
tive commando raid .on the des-erted 
prs-
oner of war camp on Sontay, 23 mik,S 
, west of Hanoi, on Nov. 21, 1970. 
In 1947 the Central. Intelligence Agen-
? cy was established with the aim of coordi-
? hating all this nation's intelligence ef-
forts. Besides the CIA, the U.S. 
intelli-
gence ncwork tod'ay-nielii[cie?s-the Defense, 
Intelligene&, Agency, the National Sc..,cur;?, 
' ity Agency, the State Department's Du-: 
reau of Intelligence and Research and nu-
clear intelligence operations of the Atomic 
Energy Commission. '3.1he counter-intel-
ligence activities of the Federal Bu-
'? reau of Investigation must also be includ-
ed. 
President Nixon, following what has 
almost become a presidential tradition 
after public disclosure of an intelligence 
? . failure, has shaken' up the top levels of 
the American spy network. In an appar-
ent hope of overcoming the shortcomings 
? of the present system, Mr. Nixon has 
_ given Richard Helms, the CIA director, 
"an enhanced leadership role in planning, - 
coordinating and evaluating all 
gence operations." Theoretically this is 
the authority that director of intelligence ; 
has had for years. But according to one 
official because of bureaucratic rivalry'z 
among competing intelligence agencies? 
*this has not always worked out. 
Sens. Stuart Symington, fl-Mo., and 
William J. Fulbrif,;ht, D-Ark., have seen .; 
Mr. Helms' new job more of a "demotion 
upstairs" than any enhanced leadership 
role. Their suspicions are understandable, 
considering the Sonta.y raid failure and , 
the imbiay of the intelligence community 
to forecast the reaction of North Vietnam , 
to the inwsion. of South Laos last Febru-
ary and March. 
Bolstering the sc,,nator's suspicions 
must be the lack Of concrete knowledge 
about the apparent leadership crisis in 
mainland China. This development comes 
at a time of delicate negotiations preced-
ing.Mr. Nixon's planned trip to Peking. It 
would be foolish for Mr;Nixon to make 
the. journey without accurate knowledge 
of the power structure in Peking. 
However, the concern of Seos. Sym- - 
in[2;ton and Fulbright that Mr. Helms has I 
been "kicked upstairs" sounds more like ? 
the political reactions Of two men who 
have Consistently disagreed with the Pros-
Mont, than the genuine concern of persons 
fearful the nation might be losing :the , 
needed talents of a highly competent hi-
telligence administrator. 
Instead the senators should be ap-
plauding the President for his 'efforts 
to bring greater coordination and col-:e7 
siveness to, an ihtelligence effort that has 
become famous for Pearl Harbor, the Bay ; 
of Pigs and Sontay.

Leath:tem ircaosa 
11 eb Grows in French 
By MARGOT LYON 
PARIS ? "It's like a Shakespeare 
play," said a leading Frenchman this 
week. "It's an infernal cauldron where 
ambitions, grudges, big money and 
blackmail are all simmering ? an ex-
plosive mixture that will probably 
spare nobody when it boils over, as it 
must." 
: He was talking of the latest revela-
tions in the scandal that links French 
counter-espionage services with the $12 
million sale of heroin in the United 
States. 
" The story began last April when 
French agriculturist and one-time spy 
Roger Delouette was arrested in New 
Jersey as he went to claim a Volkswag-
en minibus in which 96 pounds of hero-
in were hidden. He told American au-
thorities that the man behind the smug-
gling attempt was a Colonel Fournier ? 
later said to be Paul Ferrer ? a high-
ranking officer of the Service de Docu-
mentation Exterleure et Contre-Espio-
nage or SDECE, roughly the French 
equivalent of the CIA. 
Action Urged 
New Jersey attorney Herbert Stern 
has been demanding that Fournier-Fer-
rer come and defend himself against 
the charges, but since last April nothing 
has moved, except for a visit to Paris 
from Mr. Stern himself earlier this 
month, when he saw the director of 
the cabinet of the Interior Minister, 
Raymond Marcellin, in the presence 
of U.S. Ambassador Watson and 
.tither officials. The ambassador 
seemingly tried to smooth the rough 
'edges of a somewhat stormy meeting, 
but as one of the participants said later, 
-"Dr. Watson did not manage to soothe 
1Sherlock Holmes." 
Last February Minister Marcellin 
signed a cooperation pact on dope-hunt-
ing with Attorney General John Mitch-
ell and it looks as if Washington does 
not wish to sacrifice the restored coop-
eration between the two for the skin of - 
a crook. But Attorney Stern is seen to 
be in a hurry to build his own political 
career, and is impatient with the slow - 
and exceedingly formalistic style of 
French justice. 
In turn the French criticize him for 
keeping their official from contact with 
Delouette. Mr. Stern says that De-
louette's lawyer will only allow him to 
meet with them after Delouette himself 
has been granted immunity ? along 
long way from French traditions of ju-
dicial procedure. 
With little understanding of each oth-
er's methods; legally what is going on 
is a dialogue of the deaf. 
BUT THE FRENCH public sat up 
and paid attention last weekend when 
Colonel Roger Barberot, a gaullist for-
mer ambassador, a well known busi-
nessman, and very probably an ex-spy 
himself, revealed in a radio interview 
that the entire affair had probably less 
to do with international drug traffic 
than with East-West spying. 
Before De Gaulle returned to power, 
he said, the French intelligence service 
had virtually become a subsidiary of 
the CIA. But after 1958 De Gaulle re-
stored its independence. Later in his 
term of office he oriented it toward 
counter-espionage against the United 
States. 
Two years ago when President Porn 
pidou took over, he ordered the service 
changed back to its former task of 
spying on Communist activities. By that 
time it contained so many anti-Ameri-
can agents that according to Colonel 
Barberot, when new broom Alexandre 
de Marenches began his clean-up, he 
found he had to fire all the top brass. 
' Since then SDECE (pronounced 
Zdek ) agents have used their inside 
knowledee to settle scores with..new-
. 
OUS 
rug- Tangle 
comers, old-timers and any other fac-
tion they disliked. The former head of 
the Research Service of the Zdek, said 
Barberot, was himself fired on suspi-
cion of _working closely with Com-
munist agents. 
EARLY THIS WEEK the man in ' 
question, a Colonel Beaumont alias Ber-
trand, while admitting the whole serv-
ice was infested with factional rivalries, 
sued Barberot for one million francs for , 
slander. Said Barberot: "I didn't make . 
my statement lightly." However, both I 
colonels take the line that no serious 
link exists between the Zdek and drugs, 
but that rivals clumsily placed the hero-
in in the minibus knowing that De-
louette would implicate anybody to get 
himself off the hook. 
However, the staunchest defenders 
of France have been pushing the line 
that a link Indeed exists between spy- , 
ing and drugs?only it concerns the / 
CIA and not French intelligence. 
Everybody knows, say' these hard-
liners, that the, cJA, manipulates the :v/I 
selling of Laotian opidn because it is 
more than a source of profit, it is a 
tactical necessity. So the CIA has used 
the existing networks to wipe out politi-
cal adversaries ? which in that part of 
the world were French, France having 
retained a good deal of her influence 
since Laos and the rest formed part of 
the French Empire. 
A Hidden War 
Since General de Gaulle's anti-
American speech at Phnom Penh in 
1966, a hidden but merciless war has 
gone on ? and the Delouette case is 
only one aspect of a French-American ' 
settlement. Nobody would know who , 
emerged the winner, say the gaullists, 
If President Nixon had not recently de- , 
' manded a reorganization of the CIA for / 
misleading him ? especially on Laotian 
and Cambodian affairs.

By 1-1ENRY J. TAYLOR 
Behind the scenes President Nixon's 
confidence in Central Intelligence 
Agency Director Richard M. Helms 
has taken a new leap forward. Mr. Nixon 
believes (correctly) that our nation's 
-intelligence setup is a sick elephant. 
.He has quietly assigned .Mr. Helms 
,to correct it. 
A sick elephant is a formidable danger. 
And. secrecy keeps our public from 
knowing even the size of this elephant, 
to say nothing of how sick it is. 
Inere..:lib!y, we spend .eiose to 56 
billion a year for ieteni:gence. Just 
the CIA alenc is larer in Eri": 0 than 
flie State De72:trf.ent and spends 
more tv/n t.W.Iee.as muc!! money. 
Legendary Geri. William J. ("Wild 
.BM") Donovan's, Office of Strategic 
,Services conducted our entire World 
.War II espionage throughout four years. 
and throughout the world for ?a total 
of $135 million. The budget of the CIA 
(secret) is at least SI.5 billion a year. 
Next to the Pentagon with its 25 miles 
of corridors, the world's largest office 
building, the CIA's headquarters in 
suburban Langley, Va., is the largest 
:building in the Washington area. The 
CIA has jurisdiction only abroad, not 
in the United Slates. But the CIA radii-
tains secret offices in most major U.S. 
cities, totally unknown to the public. 
About 10,030 people work at Langley 
and another 5,000 are scattered across 
the world, burrowing .everywhere for 
intelligence. These include many, many 
unsung heroes who secretly risk their 
lives for our country in the dark and 
unknown battles of espionage and treach-
ery. I. could name many. And as a part 
of its veil of secrecy the CIA has its own 
elan(l,est'Ine communIcations system 
with?vaslaington and the world, ? 
The Pentagon spends $3 billion a year. 
on intelligence, twice as much as the 
CIA. Like the CIA, its Army, Navy 
and Air Force intelligence arms operate 
worldwide, of course, and--largely 
.unknown?they also have an immense 
adjunct called the National Security 
Agency which iivals the _CIA in size 
and cost.

Ports directly to Under SeCretary ot

traditionally it plays its findings very 
close to its vest.

spread out into the world from the of-
fice of the secretary/of defense, the 
Atomic Energ.v Commission, National 
Aeronautics and Spate Administration 
(NASA) and even the Department of 
Com in erce. 
In fact, there are so many additional 
hush-hush agencies that recently in West 
and East Berlin alone there were at least 
40 known U.S. intelligence agencies 
and their branches--most of them com-
peting, with one another.. ? .

of it is another; and the use of it is a i 
third. The 1947 statute creating the,/ 
CIA limits it to the first- two. It. also 
makes the CIA directly responsible 
to the President. But it is simply not true 
that the IA -is the over-all responsibk 
agency, as is so widely believed. 
Again and again, no one and everyone 
is responsible. 
The function of intelligence is to. 
protect us from surprises. It's. not 
working that way. The sick elephant 
is threatening out: national security 
by surprise, surprise, surprise. 
Alarmed President Nixon has giVen 
Mr. Helms new and sweeping 
zence reorganization authority on an 
over-all basis. He has given him the 
first authority ever given anyone- to re-
and thus affect, all our foreign 
intelligenee agencies' budgets. The Pre-s-

rivalries. He has made it clear that he 
wants its output brought- closer to the 
needs of the- President-s so-called 40 
Committee (actually six men), which 
serves the . National Security Council 
and the President himself. . 
In amputating much of the sick ele-
phant, 'Mr. Helms' directive is to cut 
down on the surprises. And the President 
could not have picked a more knowing, 
no-nonsense man to do it. .

President Nixon has announced . a

be set up within the NSC. One, under 
?the direction of Mr Henry Kissinger, 
the chief of the council, will analyse

WASHINGTON 
Key senators are ed n-
cerned that CIA .Director 
Richard Helms might 
have been "kicked up-
stairS". in the reshuffle of 
A ni e r i Qa' s intelligence 
community, with more in-
fluence in spy activities 
going to military men. -... 
,Helms has assured in-
quiring senators that he 
had no reason to believe 
he had been shuffled aside 
in the nation's intelligence 
hierarchy. 
But there is concern on 
CapitoLHill. that Helms 
has lost out in the shakeup 
of the intelligence net-
work ordered by President 
.Nixon -last month: 
JSens. Stuart Sylpton 
(D-Mo.) and J. William 
'Fulbright (D - Ark.) are 
concerned that the 
shakeup h a s increased 
P e ntagon predominance 
in the intelligence- field, 
and Sen. John .Stennis (D-
Miss.) is conducting an in-
t' 
.vestiriation to find out 
what happened. 
What has disturbed 
Helms' friends in the Sen-
ate is that the day-to-day 
control of the CIA ap-
parently has been relin-
quished to a military man, 
Lt. *Gen. Robert E. Cush-
man Jr., in 'order to free 
Helms for his new duties 
as overall director of the 
CIA and all other intel-
ligence units. Cushman, a 
marine, is deputy director. 
of the CIA. ?' 
. .Also, the Joint Chiefs of 
;Staff and the deputy sec-
retary of defense have 
been given a new voice in 
the intelligence command 
through membership on .a 
'committee, which, under 
- the direction of presiden-
tial actviser Henry A. Kis-
singer, will oversee intel-
ligence; 
hi?a closed-door 
meeting with the Senate/

not think he was being

Stennis, the committee. 
chairman, said Helms. "'as-

we are going to analyze it

wants to use that word?if 
necessary.. We do not take 
these things lightly. The 
stakes are too high." 
No one in the Senate 
really knows what his 
happened at the CIA. Not 
,even senators like Stennis, 
who are let In on the na-
tion's intelligence secrets, 
were told in advance:

Dateline 
Washington 
o "Was Richard ? Helms promoted or fired?" was the 
?question most being asked around Washington lust week.. 
The CIA Director's new post as coordinator of all U.S. 
intelligence activities was interpreted by some observers 
as a kick upstairs and by others as a pro- mption of Helms 
to "intelligence czar." In fact, the change represents a 
move to bring U.S. intelligence activitres more directly 
under White House control. ? 
Helms 'will work under the close supervision of Henry 
Kissinger, who is now .running the newly created Na-
tional Security Council Intelligence Committee. Like the 
White House Office of Telecommunications Policy, the. 
new Intelligence Committee is designed to eliminate pro-
cedural difficulties and to consolidate information?thus 
avoiding interagency conflicts... Under Kissinger, Helms 
will work as a high-level administrator, not so much for-
mulating policy as providing information upon which po-
licy will be based. Implicitly, the new post will put Helms 
over FBI head J. -Edgar Hoover, though relations with 
Hoover will continue to be handled through Hoover's 
titular superior Attorney General John Mitchell. Mitchell 
is a member of the Committee because Justice probably 
handles more interagency intelligence questions than 
any other department in the government, including De-
ferise. 
Besides consolidating intelligence .activities under the 
White House, the President also is trying to avoid the 
.horrendous duplication that has ensued from the:- proli-
feration of intelligence operations. Some of the overlap 
.presumably will be trimmed away by Helms, though some 
observers believe this'.is, for the most part, wishful think-
ing on the President's part. They note that the individual 
service branches, the Treasury Department, the FBI, the 
- Bureau of Norco. tics, the CIA and even the White House 
police force are so jealous of their prerogatives that re-
form would take major surgery--more. than either the 
President or Helms is willing to undertake at this time.

of the Post-Dispatch 
- WASHINGTON, Nov.. .23--
Senator.  St oar t Symington 
(Dem.), -Missouri, in a major 
attack on Secrecy in govern-
Inent, proposed today that Con-
tress cut: intelligence expendi-
tures from more than. 5 billion 
dollars to a mandatory ceiling 
,of 4 billions. 
lie, charged, in a speech pre-
pared for delivery, that present 
intelligence operations were 
wasteful, overlapping and in-
adequately supervised by Con-
gress. , 
' In. a. reference to the Indo-
china war, he said that he be-
lieved "at least one war" could 
have been avoided if it had note 
been for "pressures, combined 
:with unwarranted secrecy," on 
the part of ? the intelligence 
,lagencies. 
o Symington's proposed ceiling 
would apply to the Central In-
telligence Agency, the National 
Security- Agency, the Defense 
'Intelligence. Agency and all 
other intelligence units, includ-
ing those -within the branches 
of the armed services. 
He said that he had not been 
able to determine how much 
:was being appropriated this 
year for intelligence operations, 
-although he is a member of the 
Foreign Relations Committee 
and the Armed Services Com-
mittee and an exofficio mem-
?ber of the Appropriations Com-
mittee.' 
When 'the- final draft of the 
:military appropriations bill was 
_before the, ?defense appropria-
?tions subcommittee fast week, 
he said no, mention was made 
,of the multibillion-dollar appro-
priation ,requests that it cos-
tamed for much of the 15 in-
Jelligence operating or advisory 
,operations., 
r-? After the meeting, he said, 
..he asked the ,committee staff 
a 
771 
krikJJ.? 
-"in general about intelligence 
appropriations." He said he was 
?told that the staff had been in-
structed to talk- about those ap-
propriations only with five 
'senior Members Of the commit-
tee?chairtnan Allen J. Mender 
(Dern.), Louisiana, -and Sena-
tors John L. McClellan (Dem.), 
Arkansas; ? 'John C. Stennis 
(Dem.), Mississippi; Milton H. 
Young (Rep.), North_ Dakota, 
and Margaret' Chase Smith 
(Rep.), Maine. 
Symington said he had the 
greatest respect for the five 
members, "but I lo not believe 
that they, and they alone, 
should render final, decision on 
both said authorizations and ap-
propriations without the knoo 
edge, ?let alone the 'approval, of 
any other Senators, ? including 
-those on the Armed Services

Symington quoted press esti-
mates that put intelligence ex-
penditures at 5 to. 6 billion 'dol-
lars a year. He said that de-
spite his committee assign-
ments he had been unable to 
say ?whether , these , estimates 
were accurate, , Another San-
at e source termed them fairly 
accurate... . 
...The Senator renewed his criti-
cism of. a reorganization of tho 
intelligence machinery an-
nounced earlier this month by 
President Richard ? M. Nixon.: 
. He said it could mean turning 
intelligence operations over to 
the military, thus leading to 
billions of dollars in additional 
and often unnecessary defense 
expenditures, because military.. 
-estimates of enemy plans, pro-
grams and production tend to 
be higher than civilian esti-
'mates. ?

'of intelligence in a new com-

Symington had charged earli-
er this year that KisSinger,

that Symington was correct and 
that the change should have

The news that the FBI has been investigating CBS 
;correspondent Daniel Schorr caused some trepidation. 
among Washington journalists early last week. 
? But then the White House explained it all. Mr. Schorr ? 
iwas being -investigated, a spokesman said, because he 
twas being considered for a high government job, and 
the White House Wanted to run a check on him before. 
:,they offered him the position. 
.? 
Well, all of us relaxed when we heard the explana-
itIon, not only because it made sense, but also because 
.?it showed .that the administration harbored no ill ful-
l'ings. Mr. .Schorr.. has been a consistent critic of ad-
.. i.ministration policies and if he was being _considered 
lior a high government job, that meant any of us could 
? !:be. tapped for public service. 
- A group of correspondents were sitthne? in the White 
tilouse. press room the other day, chuckling over the 
latest ?White House press release, when Clyde Moth. 
ballcr- of the "Kinzu Telegram Ledger" was called to 
fthe phone. 
. ? 
-came - back whiteface(' and said: "That was my

"Congratulations, Mothballer," the AP Man said, "that

awfully mad at me about my articles on .the Supreme

wouldn't be surprised if they made you Secretary of

"You would think they would ask me if I wanted a 
job first," Mothballer said. 
-"They wanted to surprise you," *The .Washington Post

will be in the. Cabinet!" 
"The ? FBI man didn't say anything to my mother 
about a -Cabinet apPointment But he did want to know 
if I ever played with Daniel Ellsberg .as a. kid," Moth-
bailer said. 
? 
"It's just a smokescreen, Clyde," the Los Angeles 
Times man said. "They 'always ask :that when they're 
considering semebody for Secretary of Defense." 
mother said they also went around to the neigh: 
.burs and asked'them if I had, ever had any strong feel-
Ings about Cuba." .

7,`That 'Means you're being put uP-. for 'head .of the 
a' UPI photographer said. "With Dick Helms; 
being moved upstairs, they're probably looking for a'. 
new chief of operations." 
"It's possible," Mothballer said, "but my mother said 
she caught two of the FBI ilaQ11 going through her trash 
basket last night". 
= "That means you're up for an environment job," the 
NBC man shouted. 
-- "I wish I could be as Optimistic as you guys," Moth-. 
bailer said. "Suppose the FBI was asking questions to 
intimidate me?" . 
The Chicago Sun-Times man was shocked. 'Bite your 
tongue, Methballer,". he cried. "The Nixon adminis-
tration would never stoop to a trick like that, even if 
they disagreed with every word you wrote." 
"He's correct, Clyde," .the Newsweek correspondent 
said. "Attorney General Mitchell would resign before 
he'd allow the White House to intimidate a news-
paperman." - - 
"J. Edgar Hoover wouldn't stand for it," the New 
York Post man put in. 
"I guess you're right," Mothballer nodded. "I'd better 
call my mother back and reassure her. She just doesn't. 
understand how Nixon's people operate."

Nedzi's inquiries are aimed-at putting seine

his 
visits are a ,modest beginning, they indicate 
the changes that may be coming. The four other

them.

Congress. . 
- In short, N.Indzi has become tim only member of

? 
? HE HAS FOUND the agencies bristling \vith per- '

;They keep secrets from each Other. 
At the moment Nedzi said, military and the 
State Department intelligence types are angry 
over 'a White House reorganization, of intelligence 
operations because it puts CIA Director Richard 
. Helms in position to oversee every other agen-
cy's budget. Opponents or the plan charge that 
Helms will favor his own agency. ? . 
Nedzi is more concerned that the reorganization 
will put the entire intelligence community too 
close to the White House, where intelligence could' 
be perverted for pouitical use or be forced' to 
conform with White House policy.

Though Mr. NIXON needs no justi-
fication for seeking new ways to 
achieve more at less cost, the public 
is not reassured that the quality of 
US. intelligence work is as good as 
it is cracked up to be. In. recent years, 
in fact, intelligence has become ' a 
dirty word in most. liberal and some 
moderate circles. But in those days. 
of global suspicion and strife, 
gence is essential; good intelligence' 
is of inestimable value. 
The PRESIDENT is to be commended 
for the effort. He is the first to un-
dertake the drudgery and, complex 
probing required to learn -the depth 
and scope of espionage and domestic 
security vigilance. 
To be sure, what he may find will 
scarcely be information to be made 
public. But for the first time, some-
body in super-authorjty in Washing-
ton will know what is going on, 
whether it is strictly honest in in-
tent, and how much it is costing. 
PrOm there, the 'PRESIDENT can sat-

:Ur-tintaikence 
Overlapping and duplication of the work of in-
telligence agencies in the United States government 
? .have become -so pronounced that it is no wonder. 
President Nixon. is dissatisfied. It seems almost in-
credible that these agencies should be spending an 
estimated five billion dollars a year and employing 
ethe services, of 200,000 persons. 
. What makes the situation more, deplorable is the 
mutiplicity of agencies ? not only the CIA? which , 
- has the over-all reaponsibility for foreign intelli-
gence, but intelligence agencies in each of the three 
major military services, the State Department, the 
National Security Agency, the Atomic Energy Corn-
mission, and the FBI. Many citiiens will wonder 
why a single agency couldn't do the bulk of the work, , 
with the others perhaps doing specialized tasks for , 
- their own agencies ? but no mere. ? 
. The rising cost of these activities, like that of 
all government expenditures, is enough to warrant a 
1, thorough investigation of the extent and efficacy of 
all the intelligence and spy agencies. Informed offi-
cials insist that the number of persons and the amount 
of money involved in, real spying are relatively small.. 
The large expenses are incurred in rontine gathering 
of so-called "open" information and also in inter-
cepting and trying to decipher coded messages ,on 
world-wide radio transmissions or operation of planes ? 
and satellites on surveillance missions. 
- One trouble with the intelligence organizations, 
like ail bureaucracies, is that they tend to proliferate. 
;Occasionally, they grow. almost uncontrollably as did 
the Army missionof spying on civilians in connec-
tion with possible military employment in controlling 
domestic riots. That is perhaps the greatest danger. 
All these agencies operate under a- cloak of secrecy, . 
with only a handful of civilian officials, legislative 
, and executive; aware of what they are doing. It may 
be questioned how much any cengressman or senator I, 
really knows about them. 
Another trouble is that any investigation or t 
evaluation must be done with a maximum of secrecy. 
eIt certainly can't be handled the way an investigation 
of welfare expenditures is coneincted, with legislators 
sounding off in all directions. No responsible_ par-
ties want to hamper the intelligence-gathering proc-
ess. But no one can be happy, not even the Presi-
dent, with the present situation,

Alt For Intelligence 
President Nixon is said to have difficulty 
*aseertaining what all the federal intelligence 
agencies do, and with how much money and 
manpower. And if the President cannot figure 
out what all the espionage is about, how can 
Congress, or the public? 
Thus- Mr. Nixon should have thorough sup-
port if he undertakes any real reorganizati3n' 
of the various intelligence .arms-T-the Central , 
Intelligence Agency, along with agencies of the 
Defense, Justice and State Departments and, at 
'times, the FBI. Mr. Nixon has asked his staff 
to survey this abundance of intelligence effort 
and to report back with ideas about 'cutting spy 
expenses. 
Mr. Nixon is the first President really to at-
tempt to make fiscal or any other kind of sense 
out of the intelligence apparatus, though had 
he lived John Kennedy might have tried, con-
sidering the CIA blunder in the Bay of Pigs 
'fiasco. One of the worst features of so-called 
intelligence is that it is not entirely that; it has 
too Often been involved in paramilitary yen: 
tures far beyond data gathering. 
Most citizens probably thought the CIA was 
supposed to bring all this together, .and then 
President Eisonhower no doubt thought he was_ 
' co-ordinating something when he set up the 
U.S. Intelligence Board, but the various agen-
:cies still go their own ways with an estimated 
-200,000 personnel and a similarly estimated 
expenditure of 3.5 billion dollars a year. 
Aside from saving money, reorganization 
could result in more. competent intelligence. 
But in this mysterious field governmental re-
.Organization may be more difficult than any-
wh_ere else.

Nixon did not want ,a high-pressure man heading

and trusted friend?one of Mr. Nixon's oldest and 
most confidential advisers ? has not prevented his 
department from being pushed- into -secondary 
position. Other departments with interests arid-, per.; 
sonnel abroad have been quick to ignore, or shake 
off the direction and control that the State Depaets 
ment, through its ambassadors, is. supposed to 'exs 
efelse in all oversea.s situations. 
POSsibly a different combination of president and 
secretary of state could put the department hack
-a position of command. But a reversal apparently 
will not be easy. The attempt., ought to be made, 
?for the State Department does represent civilian 
control over foreign policy, a- control less and less 
representedby the activities of the huge DefenSe 
Department and the mostly undercover .CIA. 
? ? ? 
There was a time . in the affairs of the United , 
States. when the State' Department made foreign 
, policy. That time is quite a way in the past More 
and more, as a survey by The New York Times has 
shown, the formulation of foreign policy has been 
,moved to ,the White House. The. State Departments . 
-instead ,of directing other agencies in their dealings 
with foreign goverments, finds itself competing with 
those agencies for White House attention. Moreover, 
It frequently finds itself running a poor. secon.c1

them. - ? . 
Probably this development should not be ens.-
' prising. For the past decade, the nation has been 
: conducting or directing a war. In an age of -super-
- powers and superweapons, the military budget of 
the. country has swollen to between 70 and sp 
-dollars. Whoever controls the ? spending of, that 
:amount of money, and the activities of all the people - 
involved in the expenditure; is going to have ?a. 
potent influence on policy, if not indeed to the point 
? 
of making the pblicy. 
But personalities are the imponderable in politi-
? cal affairs. A succession of relatively weak secretaries 
of state has done nothing to offset the trend toward 
' centralization of authority in the White House. It 
? is not simply that Presidents Kennedy, Johnson: and 
Nixon have insisted on paying day-to-day attention 
? to foreign policy; they have . gradually built .up 
' a White House foreign policy staff that. rivals the 
;State Department. This build-up has not been acci-
dental, of course. The catapulting of the 'United 
?States-into the position of the most powerful nation. 
' has thrust new, and magnified -responsibilities upon 
the President. ? ? ? ? -? 
Still, Harry Truman deferred to Dean Acheson 
and Dwight EisenhoWer. deferred to .John. Foster 
= Dulles. Perhaps a weaker president seeks a more, 
aggressive secretary to formufete. the policies and 
decisions that have to be made?although neither 
Truman nor Eisenhower, was exactly. aeweak man. 
Perhaps if Dean Rusk had had a streak of greater 
' decisiveness in him, he could have stemmed the tide. 
Secretary of State Rogers has impressed no one as. 
'-a strong.personality. He comes across, in press and
