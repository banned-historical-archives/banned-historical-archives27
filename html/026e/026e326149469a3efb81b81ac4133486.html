The Challenge of Ethnic Conflict 
to National and International 
Order in the 1990s: Geographic 
Perspectives 
Overview 
Since the end of the Cold War, ethnic conflicts have 
been of increasing importance�posing a threat to 
international order and demanding the attention of 
US policymakers. The aim of this conference report is 
to highlight geographic concepts and factors that con-
tribute to our understanding of these conflicts and to 
identify sources of potential ethnic strife. Following 
the order of the conference, this report is divided into 
three parts: 
� The conference's conceptual framework. An exami-
nation of the geographic approach to the study of 
ethnic conflict. 
� Regional manifestations. Current and potential eth-
nic conflicts by region. 
� Implications. Looking at ethnic conflicts from a 
comparative basis and viewing consequences for the 
United States and the international community. 
Part I: Framing the Discussion 
Dr Alexander Murphy, Associate Professor in the 
Department of Geography at the University of Oregon, 
establishes the groundwork in his keynote address. He 
examines the geographer's unique approach to analyz-
ing ethnic tensions and discusses how the geographic 
perspective can aid in understanding these tensions, in 
identifying destabilizing ethnic conflicts, and in devel-
oping effective policy responses. His discussion 
focuses on the core concepts of location, territory, and 
environment. 
Dr David Knight, Dean of Social Sciences at the Uni-
versity of Guelph, provides additional insights on the 
geographic perspective, exploring the linked concepts 
of identity, territory, territoriality, and self-determina-
tion as well as numerous territorial processes that 
function within the nation-state system. 
Part II: Regional Manifestations 
Eastern Europe 
Dr Ronald Wixman, Professor of Geography, Univer-
sity of Oregon, identifies some potentially serious 
ethnoterritorial conflicts that may arise in Eastern 
Europe as well as others that have implications 
beyond the region. He also discusses the impact of 
Western nonaction in Bosnia and Herzegovina and 
presents a worst case scenario for the situation in the 
Balkans. 
Dr Thomas Poulsen, the respondent, is Professor of 
Geography at Oregon State University. He under-
scores some of the key elements that affect the Bosnia 
situation. 
Western Europe and Canada 
Dr Colin Williams, Research Professor at the Univer-
sity of Wales, College of Cardiff, examines ethnic 
issues in Western Europe, highlighting the most press-
ing and drawing out the implications for multiethnic 
accommodation to a changing world order. He empha-
sizes the significance of the spatial perspective at 
urban, regional, and continental scales. 
Dr Alexander Murphy's response provides further 
observations on ethnic dynamics in the region and on 
the impact of Western Europe's changing political 
geography on ethnic conflict. 
Former Soviet Union 
Dr Robert Kaiser, Professor of Geography at the 
University of Missouri�Columbia, explores the fac-
tors underlying the regional variations in the ethnoter-
ritorial conflicts in the former Soviet Union. Among 
these factors are the degree of national consciousness, 
the strength of attachment to place, the nature of 
ethnodemographic trends, and the social mobility and 
relative deprivation of the ethnic group. He also dis-
cusses how various groups have reacted to rising terri-
torial nationalism. 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Dr. Ronald Wixman, in his response, discusses the 
region from a slightly different perspective, viewing 
the Soviet Union as an empire that is going through 
stages of decolonization. 
Africa 
Dr. Harm J. de Blij, Landegger Distinguished Profes-
sor of Geography at Georgetown University, examines 
the three kinds of ethnic conflict in Sub-Saharan 
Africa: religious, tribal, and strategic. He then looks in 
detail at current ethnic strife in Liberia, Sudan, Dji-
bouti, Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi, and Angola and 
assesses the potential for ethnic conflict in Nigeria and 
South Africa. 
Dr. Rex Honey, Associate Professor of Geography at 
the University of Iowa, responds by placing African 
ethnic conflict in a historical perspective. He associ-
ates current problems with the European colonialists' 
imposition of boundaries and of the modern nation-
state system. 
Latin America 
Dr Gary S. Elbow, Professor of Geography, Texas 
Tech University, discusses the potential for ethnic 
conflict in South America, Mexico, and the Caribbean 
in the 1990s. He focuses on the potential for confron-
tation between indigenous peoples and national gov-
ernments. 
Mr Mac Chapin of Rights and Resources responds 
by discussing ethnic tensions among groups in Central 
America. He concentrates on the marginalization of 
the indigenous p_opulation. 
Middle East 
Dr Marvin Mikesell, Professor of Geography at the 
University of Chicago, examines the ethnic realities 
that make the Middle East a region of inherent instabil-
ity and the persistent conflict between ethnic groups, 
many of whom share a common language and religion. 
Dr Mildred Berman, Professor of Geography at 
Salem State College, calls attention to refugees as 
another of the destabilizing aspects of the region's 
human geography. 
Southeast and East Asia 
Dr Dru Gladney, Research Fellow, Program for 
Cultural Studies at the East West Center, Hawaii, 
illustrates some of the potential ethnic and subethnic 
faultlines in Chinese society. He explores ethnicity in 
the context of the shifting nature of identity and pro-
poses some policy considerations. 
Dr Eric Crystal, Coordinator for Southeast Asia Stud-
ies at the University of California, Berkeley, presents 
four key focuses for understanding ethnic tensions in 
Southeast Asia: highland-lowland divides, religious 
identification, cultural and linguistic differences in bor-
der regions, and ideological conflicts articulated in 
terms of ethnic interest. Dr. Crystal highlights the 
impact of outside intervention on inflaming ethnic ten-
sions in the region since World War II and concludes 
with some observations for policymaking. 
South Asia 
Dr Joseph Schwartzberg, Professor of Geography at 
the University of Minnesota, examines evolving eth-
nicity in South Asia, focusing on postindependence 
India. Among the issues he discusses are the processes 
of-ethnic identity formation, linguistic affiliation as an 
organizing principle, and Hindu nationalism. 
Dr Robert Stoddard, the respondent, is Professor 
of Geography at the University of Nebraska. He dis-
cusses the regionalization of the Tamil population in 
Sri Lanka and comments on two major perspectives of 
Indian nationalism, the secular and the Hindu. 
Part III: Regional Comparisons and 
Implications for the United States and the 
International Community 
Perspectives on Demographic and 
Humanitarian Issues 
Dr. Gary Fuller, Professor of Geography and Popula-
tion Studies at the University of Hawaii, examines the 
demographic underpinnings of ethnic conflict. He 
argues that certain demographic data, such as infant 
2 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
mortality, are good indicators of a particular ethnic 
group's well-being. He also looks at how youth 
bulges�when the 15 to 24 age cohort exceeds 20 per-
cent of a given population�affect stability within 
ethnic groups. 
Dr Martin Kenzer, Associate Professor of Geography 
at Florida Atlantic University, provides a review of 
post-World War II ethnically driven refugee move-
ments and assesses the current refugee picture. 
Dr Lee Schwartz, Office of the Geographer, Depart-
ment of State, examines the linkage between forced 
migration and ethnicity. He presents a typology of 
forced movements of people and a geography of the 
ethnic composition of such migration. 
States, Nations, and Ethnic Conflict 
Dr Thomas Poulsen looks at how overlapping pat-
terns of states (sovereign countries) and nations 
(groupings of peoples with common identities) affect 
current affairs. He then examines factors that aggra-
vate or ameliorate ethnic conflicts, especially where 
nations and states do not correspond, and presents 
some political-geographic truisms that the United 
States should consider in dealing with ethnic conflict 
abroad. 
Patterns, Trends, and Regional Comparisons 
Dr Marvin Mikesell suggests that some countries�
such as Finland�have done a good job accommodat-
ing minority populations and that neighboring coun-
tries could learn from this. 
In her discussion, Dr Mildred Berman relays the 
importance of examining population trends. 
Ethnic Conflict and US Policy 
Dr Jon Gundersen, Department of State, presents his 
view that US foreign policy must take into account 
ethnic conflict, which will be on the international 
Reverse Blank 
3 
agenda over the long term. Concentrating on Europe 
and the former Soviet Union, he questions what type 
of state structure can best protect ethnic groups in the 
region. He concludes by suggesting that the problem 
of ethnic conflict in Europe could be addressed 
through a united, decentralized Continent governed by 
mutually accepted rules of behavior. 
Mr. Wade Hinkle, Department of Defense, reiterates 
then Secretary of Defense Les Aspin's view that eth-
nic/national conflict is one of the main dangers to 
US national security in the post�Cold War era. He 
then summarizes the key points of US national secu-
rity strategy: remaining engaged in international 
affairs, preventing the effects of ethnic conflict, and 
forming partnerships with like-minded democratic 
countries. 
Conclusions: Implications for the United States 
and the International Community�Problems 
and Prospects 
Dr. Stanley Brunn, Professor of Geography at the Uni-
versity of Kentucky, examines the state of the world 
political map and itemizes six factors that will affect 
global politics over the next 20 years: environment, 
religion, secularization, sports, territoriality, and com-
munications. 
In the discussion, Dr Rex Honey calls for understand-
ing that oppressed ethnic groups have legitimate 
grievances and for support of human rights globally. 
Dr Harm J. de Blij, the concluding discussant, points 
out that ethnic strife may be related to deteriorating 
environmental conditions in parts of the world.

Geographic Perspectives on Ethnic Conflict 
Alexander Murphy 
Associate Professor of Geography 
University of Oregon 
Introduction 
The topic of ethnic conflict has long interested geogra-
phers, and in recent years the geographical literature 
on the subject has attracted considerable attention. 
Although some of the issues raised in this literature 
are similar to those examined by political scientists 
and sociologists, the emphasis in geography on spa-
tial, territorial, and environmental issues has trans-
lated into a distinctly different analytical approach to 
ethnic conflict. The purpose of this paper is to summa-
rize the most important aspects of this approach and to 
discuss how a geographical perspective can help us 
understand ethnic tensions, identify potentially desta-
bilizing ethnic conflicts, and develop effective policy 
responses to those conflicts. , 
The ensuing discussion centers around three core geo-
graphical concepts: location, territory, and environ-
ment. In the United States, the discipline of geography 
is sometimes equated with efforts simply to locate and 
describe the physical and human attributes of the 
earth's surface. Geography is, however, much more 
than this; it is concerned with analyzing and explain-
ing the nature and significance of the spatial and envi-
ronmental contexts within which events and processes 
unfold. Geographers seek to understand and explain 
the patterns that make up the earth's surface, the rela-
tionship among phenomena in particular places, the 
situation of places and peoples in relation to one 
another, and peoples' understandings of the places 
where they live. 
Core Concepts 
The three core concepts around which this paper is 
structured are at the heart of these geographical con-
cerns. The concept of location deals not only with the 
spatial distribution of ethnic groups but also with the 
relationship between ethnic patterns and other human 
and physical patterns. Territory is a rich concept that 
encompasses the nature and function of formal ethnic 
territories and group sense of place. The environmen-
tal concept is concerned with the relationship between 
ethnic groups and their tangible physical setting, 
including the ways in which environmental percep-
tions affect group definition and intergroup relations. 
There are obvious overlaps among these concepts, and 
they do not encompass all relevant aspects of geo-
graphical inquiry. Nonetheless, they provide a useful 
organizing framework around which a discussion of 
the most important geographical insights on ethnic 
conflict can be built. 
Location: A Key To Understanding Relationships 
Between Ethnic Groups 
In any attempt to understand ethnic conflict, the loca-
tion of the groups in question must be taken into con-
sideration. On its surface this seems obvious, but many 
general analyses of ethnic conflict pay remarkably lit-
tle attention to locational issues. Instead, it is simply 
assumed that groups live in the political units or histor-
ical homelands with which they are most readily iden-
tified. Too often studies note that the Bretons live in 
Brittany, the French speakers of Canada in Quebec, 
and the Tamils in Tamil Eelam without any consider-
ation of the distributional complexities that lie behind 
these generalizations. 
Approaching ethnic conflict from a geographical per-
spective implies a much greater concern with the 
details of location and distribution. This means focus-
ing on the precise character of ethnic patterns and 
their relationship to other political, social, and envi-
ronmental patterns. A critical entry-level problem in 
such an endeavor is to decide who does and does not 
belong to a given ethnic group (see Smith 1986). How 
an ethnic group is delimited depends on circumstances 
and purpose, of course, but the process is not always 
straightforward or obvious. There are more people 
that Welsh autonomists would like to include in their 
ethnic group than there are people who identify them-
selves primarily as Welsh. The Tamils of Sri Lanka 
encompass two different groups from a historical and 
religious standpoint. On a larger scale, the Russians in

the Baltic countries or the Germans in Eastern Europe 
cannot necessarily be viewed as one group. Russian 
and German migrations into these regions took place 
over long periods of time, and those who came earlier 
have distinctly different perspectives from those who 
migrated during the past few decades. 
Once the issue of defining ethnic groups has been 
addressed, there is much to learn from a careful analy-
sis of group location and distribution. This can be seen 
through an examination of the effects of different dis-
tributions at a large scale. As Marvin Mikesell and I 
demonstrated in a recent article (Mikesell and Murphy 
1991), the basic distribution of a minority group within 
a state influences the types of demands the group is 
likely to raise. We posited three scenarios (figure 1), 
each involving a dominant group (A) that constitutes 
90 percent of the population and a minority group (B) 
that constitutes 10 percent of the population. In the first 
scenario, group B is concentrated in one area within 
the state. In the second scenario, group B is intermixed 
with group A throughout the state territory. In the third 
scenario, a significant portion of group B is concen-
trated in one territory, but many members of group B 
live in other parts of the state. We went on to show that 
if a minority grotip feels marginalized or repressed, in 
the first scenario it is likely to make demands for sepa-
ration (S), autonomy (A), or even independence (I). 
This was the case for the Basques in Franco's Spain 
and is still the case for the Tibetans in China. In the 
second scenario, by contrast, the demands are likely to 
be for recognition (r), access (a), and participation (p), 
as exemplified by African-Americans in the United 
States. The third scenario, which corresponds to the 
situation of the French speakers of Canada, is likely to 
yield a mixture of demands and a greater heterogeneity 
of ethnic group aspirations. 
An understanding of ethnic patterns at a variety of 
scales can tell us much about the nature of conflict and 
about the viability of proposals to ameliorate conflict. 
Take the case of Bosnia, for example. Generalized eth-
nic distributions shown on large-scale maps became 
the basis for the Vance-Owen plan to divide up the 
country into discrete ethnic territories. A closer exami-
nation of ethnic patterns, however, reveals distribu-
tions that are much more nuanced than those reflected 
in the Vance-Owen plan. Awareness of these, together 
with some of the territorial issues that will be raised 
6 
later, helps explain the negative reactions that the plan 
engendered. Similarly, a detailed understanding of the 
distribution of Tamils in Sri Lanka sheds light on the 
problems facing the Sinhalese-dominated government 
in its efforts to quell separatist threats through the dev-
olution of power to regional governments. As regional 
governments grow in power, ethnically heterogeneous 
administrative districts such as Puttalam and Ampara 
increasingly become the focuses of conflict. 
The forgoing examples suggest that a geographical 
perspective on location involves more than simply 
identifying where the members of ethnic groups live. 
It is concerned with a group's location in relation to 
other physical and human phenomena of importance. 
Analyzing a group's "relative location" can provide 
insight into the likelihood that one group will seek to 
exert control over another, the opportunities and cata-
lysts for ethnic group mobilization, the strategies 
employed by groups during times of overt conflict, 
and the possibilities for a conflict to spill beyond state 
boundaries. A brief examination of each of these 
points is instructive. 
Attempts by one ethnic group to exert control over 
another often occur when one group lives in an area 
that is highly prized by another (see, for instance, 
a number of the essays in Johnston, Knight, and 
Kofman 1988). This is evident in the history of rela-
tions between dominant and minority groups in states 
as diverse as Australia, Turkey, and France. In each 
case, minorities concentrated in areas thought to have 
little value or Importance were generally left alone or 
ignored. Those living in areas of economic, military, 
political, or cultural significance, however, often 
encountered interference and domination by the 
group in power, which in turn frequently led to 
conflict. In making this point, it is important to stress 
that the perceptual importance of an area is not simply 
a function of its economic and strategic attributes; 
places with great historical-cultural meaning or 
political significance can become focuses of conflict 
as well. Thus, the presence of Albanians in Kosovo 
and of French speakers in the communes around 
Brussels have generated serious discord because of 
the historical-cultural significance of Kosovo to Ser-
bians and the political-cultural significance of the 
communes around Brussels to Flemings.

Turning to the importance of relative location for eth-
nic mobilization, groups living within areas that are 
disadvantaged from a socioeconomic standpoint can 
use that disadvantage to foster a sense of discrimina-
tion. This does not mean that ethnicity is simply a 
product of socioeconomic differences, but comparative 
standards of living often become points of contention 
in ethnic conflicts (see, for instance, many of the 
essays in Chisholm and Smith 1990). In former Yugo-
slavia, for example, Serbian resentment of Croats and 
Slovenes was heightened by the disproportionate share 
of tourism-related revenue that flowed into Croatia and 
Slovenia. The Croats and Slovenes, in turn, resented 
the central government's efforts to redistribute some of 
that revenue to other parts of Yugoslavia. 
The capacity of a group to mobilize is also tied to its 
location in relation to demographic and settlement 
patterns. There is considerable evidence to suggest 
that culturally distinct groups without a significant 
urban base are unlikely to develop and sustain a seri-
ous ethnic movement (Murphy 1992). Most ethnic 
movements begin among an intelligentsia with some 
access to established lines of power and communica-
tion (Smith 1982). Such movements develop and grow 
through the successful mobilization of people and 
resources, which in turn requires the establishment of 
an institutional base that is convenient to a significant 
number of group members and that offers access to 
channels of communication. Since these elements are 
found primarily in cities, an urban base is almost a 
prerequisite for ethnic mobilization. Thus, in Western 
Europe most successful ethnic challenges have come 
from groups such as the Catalans and the Flemings 
that have major cities within their territories. By con-
trast, efforts to challenge existing arrangements 
among Saami activists in Norway or their Basque 
counterparts in France have been frustrated by the 
lack of a central place that could become the focus of 
identity and nationalist activism. 
Turning to the significance of relative location for the 
strategies employed by ethnic groups in situations of 
overt conflict, it has long been understood that a 
group's position in relation to physical features, trans-
portation routes, and settlement patterns affects the 
tactics of conflict. As is discussed in more detail 
below, ethnic conflicts often revolve around territorial 
issues, and control over territory is a primary goal in 
times of armed conflict. Assessing the strategies that 
are likely to be employed in such conflicts requires an 
understanding of a group's location in relation to 
places of strategic or perceptual importance, the diffi-
culties of exerting control over those places, and the 
advantages that can follow if control is successfully 
asserted. In the case of recent Serbian initiatives, for 
example, Ronald Wixman has argued that it is impos-
sible to understand the military objectives of the Serbs 
without considering the geopolitical and strategic 
advantages that will follow from a successful Serbian 
attempt both to control the Krajina region of Croatia 
and to connect it to Serbia (editorial, The Register 
Guard, Eugene, Oregon, 6 June 1993, section B, pp. 1 
and 4). 
A final important dimension of "relative location" is 
the situation of a group in relation to similar or sympa-
thetic groups in other states. Social scientists and poli-
cymakers are so much in the habit of looking at issues 
on a state-by-state basis that they often ignore cul-
tural/ethnic continuities across international bound-
aries. Yet Azerbaijanis live in Iran as well as 
Azerbaijan, and Armenians are found in Turkey as 
well as in Armenia. Focusing on the relationships 
among the peoples living on either side of these 
boundaries is of critical importance if we are to under-
stand the forces that will affect political stability in 
Western and Central Asia in the years ahead. Indeed, 
given the increasing permeability of international 
boundaries, an awareness of cross-border cultural con-
tinuities and interaction patterns in many parts of the 
world is going to be necessary if we are to compre-
hend the ways in which conflicts develop and their 
likely ramifications. 
Territory: At The Heart of Ethnicity and 
Ethnic Conflict 
A territory is generally understood to be a bounded 
area that has some political character or meaning. As 
the embodiment of a particular way of understanding 
and using the earth's surface, territory is at the heart of 
geographical thinking about ethnicity and nationalism. 
Geographers are concerned with the functional and 
8 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
perceptual attributes of territory, the ways in which 
territory acquires significance in human affairs, and 
the nature and impact of competing strategies to con-
trol territory (Knight 1982). Much of the social sci-
ence and public policy literature on ethnicity fails to 
consider these issues; instead, territories are treated 
simply as fixed units within which political and social 
developments are situated. This does not mean that 
territories are entirely ignored. Questions are asked 
about the role of Quebec in Canadian national politics, 
the political tactics of the Armenian minority living 
within Azerbaijan, the social consequences of ethnic 
heterogeneity within the states of India, and the prob-
lems that interstate resource inequalities pose for 
political stability in Nigeria. These questions tend to 
be addressed, however, without any consideration of 
the historical development, perceptual attributes, or 
spatial configuration of the territorial units involved. 
The importance of such questions becomes immedi-
ately apparent if we pose a series of counterfactual 
questions. Would ethnolinguistic identity and inter-
group conflict in Canada be different if Quebec had 
developed as three separate provinces instead of one? 
Would Armenian-Azerbaijani relations be any differ-
ent if Stalin had not created an Armenian enclave 
within Azerbaijan? Would ethnic relations in Nigeria 
be different if the state had been divided into 30 
instead of 19 constituent units? The obvious "yes" that 
each of these questions commands indicates the 
importance of going beyond approaches that take the 
territorial status quo for granted. 
Two related territorial issues are at the heart of geo-
graphical work on ethnic conflict: (1) the nature and 
scope of ethnic senses of territory and (2) the develop-
ment and institutionalization of particular political-
territorial arrangements. Turning to the first issue, the 
habit of taking territorial arrangements for granted 
means that we often do not consider the disjunction 
between territorial structures and group sense of terri-
tory. Yet a map showing group sense of territory can 
tell us much more about the likelihood of conflict than 
can a static political map. It is, of course, difficult to 
delimit a group's sense of territory with any precision, 
but insights can be gained through an examination of 
historical political patterns, group rhetoric and ico-
nography, population concentrations, and the distribu-
tion of sites with particular ethnocultural significance 
(see Gottmann 1973). When the same area clearly 
falls within more than one group's sense of territory, 
the potential for conflict is heightened (see, for 
instance, White 1992). 
It is important to note that not all senses of territory 
are monoethnic in character. One of the fundamental 
flaws of many analyses of pre-civil-war Bosnia is the 
failure to recognize the strength of a multiethnic Bos-
nian sense of territory. The number of people in Bos-
nia who were declaring themselves as "Bosnian" on 
census and survey forms grew steadily in the post�
World War II era, and many inhabitants came to think 
of the country as a territorial synthesis of cultures. The 
recent partition plans developed for Bosnia fail to 
grasp this reality. Instead they propose dividing the 
country into ethnically discrete units. Since such pro-
posals neither can build upon preexisting senses of 
territory nor can possibly lead to the establishment of 
truly monoethnic territories�the groups are too inter-
mingled for that to happen�their implementation 
would at best create a highly unstable situation; each 
of the new subdivisions would have an explicitly 
monoethnic rationale, yet each would be ethnically 
heterogeneous and would fall within more than one 
group's sense of territory (Jordan 1993). 
The Bosnian example suggests that, when policies are 
implemented that ignore underlying territorial ideolo-
gies, instability is likely to result. The issue of sense of 
territory is thus closely linked to the second core terri-
torial issue: the development and institutionalization 
of particular political-territorial arrangements. Focus-
ing on the process by which formal territories come 
into being is important because it can provide insights 
into how territorial arrangements shape ethnic identity 
and interaction, how conflicts develop and are sus-
tained, and how territory is used to advance particular 
political ends (see generally Sack 1986). 
Many groups sharing basic cultural traits did not 
become self-conscious ethnic groups until fairly 
recently. Some 200 years ago there was no widespread 
sense of Palestinian, Kurdish, or Flemish identity. 
Those identities were forged in the context of politi-
cal-territorial developments that served to differentiate 
peoples based on cultural characteristics. In the case 
9 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
of the Kurds, a larger sense of group identity devel-
oped out of a territorial struggle that marginalized and 
ignored the Kurdish peoples. In the Flemish case, the 
implementation of a territorial strategy by a move-
ment initially focused on individual language rights 
provided a crucible in which a larger sense of ethnic 
identity could develop. In both cases, ethnic demands 
and intergroup relations are fundamentally tied to the 
development and institutionalization of particular ter-
ritorial arrangements. 
The political-territorial history of a region is also 
implicated in the development and conduct of inter-
group conflict. This is because particular issues take 
on significance as territorial structures come into 
being and because those structures, in turn, provide 
the frameworks within which the issues in question 
are confronted. This complex point can best be illus-
trated through an example. In early 20th century Bel-
gium, the Flemish movement sought to secure the 
rights of Dutch or Flemish speakers to use their lan-
guage in public life. Frustrated by their lack of success 
and concerned about the growing use of French in 
northern Belgium, they changed strategies and began 
to call for the partitioning of the country along lan-
guage lines. This eventually occurred, and the country 
is now a federation made up of language regions with 
broad competencies over economic, social, and cul-
tural matters. The adoption and implementation of a 
territorial approach to the language problem shifted 
attention away from individual language rights and 
directed it toward territorial issues; disputes over the 
use of language in governmental and commercial 
affairs were replaced by conflicts over the regional 
affiliations of certain communes along the language 
boundary and around Brussels. Moreover, since pow-
ers over a broad array of issues were devolved to the 
language regions, many economic, social, and politi-
cal matters took on ethnoregional significance. As a 
result, the internal territorial structure of Belgium has 
promoted ethnoregionalism. Without a consideration 
of the development and institutionalization of territo-
rial arrangements in Belgium, this point could easily 
be missed. 
A final reason for focusing on the processes by which 
territorial arrangements come into being is that such 
an approach provides insight into the purposes behind 
the creation of ethnic territories. This, in turn, can tell 
us much about the circumstances that lead to ethnic 
conflict (see Wixman 1986). General analyses of legal 
arrangements in multiethnic states draw a distinction 
between "personal" and territorial policy approaches. 
The latter encompasses laws that set aside some terri-
tory for a given ethnic group. The assumption is often 
made that these laws are pluralist in intent and effect; 
it is assumed that they are acknowledgments of the 
existence of ethnic diversity and that they operate to 
sustain that diversity. A closer examination of territo-
rial policies in multiethnic states reveals a much more 
complicated picture (Murphy 1989). In some cases, 
territorial policies reflect a desire to recognize and 
sustain diversity (for instance, Switzerland, India, and 
Canada). In other instances such policies have dis-
tinctly different intents and effects. Territorial policies 
are adopted to diffuse international pressure (for 
instance, the recognition of-ethnic territories in 
Burma), to promote rivalry between groups_ (for 
instance, Soviet manipulation of borders in the Cauca-
sus and Central Asia), and even deliberately to con-
strain ethnic rights (for instance, the creation of 
"homelands" for the indigenous peoples of South 
Africa). Understanding the intent and effect of such 
policies is clearly important if we are to judge what a 
territory means for a given group and the role that the 
territorial context plays in intergroup relations. 
Environment: Its Context in Ethnic Conflict 
Geographers are fundamentally concerned with the 
relationship between people and the environment. 
This relationship is important in the context of ethnic 
group relations because ethnic identity is often tied to 
a particular environmental context, because ecological 
issues can become focuses of intergroup conflict, and 
because the manipulation of the environment is a fre-
quently used tactic to advance particular ethnoterrito-
rial ends. A brief examination of these three factors 
provides insight into the importance of the geographi-
cal concern with the environmental foundations of 
ethnic relations. 
In many parts of the world, ethnic identity is closely 
linked to a people's understanding and use of the envi-
ronment. The strong tie between ethnic identity and 
10 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
environmental context can often be seen in the rhetoric 
and iconography of ethnic movements; great attention 
is paid to the unique physical characteristics of a 
group's homeland in the songs, poems, art, and litera-
ture of the group. In many cases, these environmental 
characteristics are so much a part of group identity that 
any threat to them can precipitate a crisis. The link 
between ethnicity and environmental context is even 
deeper in parts of the world where differences in sub-
sistence practices define ethnic boundaries. In the 
highlands of Nepal, agriculture and ethnicity are 
closely linked. An understanding of the intricacies of 
that link is of considerable importance if we are to gain 
insight into the types of events that can precipitate 
conflict. Knowing that the Hindus equate brown grains 
with impurity, for example, allows us to understand 
the potential implications of a decision emanating 
from Katmandu to introduce brown rice into the area. 
The state of the environment in an ethnic region can 
also become a source of conflict. The ethnopolitical 
consequences of ecological degradation were apparent 
in Eastern Europe in the late 1980s; concerns over the 
rapidly deteriorating state of the environment in Bul-
garia, Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and 
Poland provided a rallying point for those seeking to 
bring down Soviet hegemony in the region. Within 
states, policies that promote environmental degrada-
tion in ethnic homelands or territories, whether inten-
tional or not, can spark dissention and conflict. This 
can be seen in former Czechoslovakia where the cen-
tral government decided to support the Gabcikovo-
Nagymaros hydroelectric dam project on the Danube 
River. The project, which will result in the flooding of 
land within the part of Slovakia where Hungarians are 
concentrated, sparked protests amongst Slovalcia's 
Hungarian minority. 
Manipulation of the environment is also frequently 
used as a tactic in ethnic conflicts. In some cases, 
efforts are made to demarcate the boundaries of ethnic 
territories through the building of particular structures 
(for instance, walls and fences), the erection of signs, 
or the emplacement of more subtle indicators of ethnic 
group territoriality (for instance, symbolic icons or 
structures) (see Rumley and Minghi 1991). In other 
cases, land use decisions are made with the goal 
of asserting control over a given area. This is most 
clearly seen when settlements are established in 
disputed territories (for instance, the establishment of 
settlements by Israeli Jews in the West Bank). More 
subtle land use decisions are also linked to ethnic con-
flict. In a provocative recent study, Shaul Cohen 
(1993) has shown how the Israeli Government and the 
Palestinians use tree planting to assert their claims to 
land, the former through afforestation schemes and the 
latter through the planting of olive groves. Studies of 
this sort highlight the importance of landscape and 
land use issues for understanding ethnic conflict. 
Policy Implications and Conclusion 
The forgoing account has only scratched the surface 
of the ways in which geographical perspectives can 
enhance our understanding of ethnic conflict. Each of 
the highlighted themes could be greatly expanded, as 
will undoubtedly become clear in the regional papers 
that follow. Looking at ethnicity through a geographi-
cal lens has a variety of implications for the formula-
tion of policy responses to ethnic conflict, but three 
stand out: (1) the importance of looking beyond politi-
cal leaders, (2) the importance of looking beyond indi-
vidual states, and (3) the importance of looking at 
maps�not just political maps, but ethnic, economic, 
environmental, and perceptual maps as well. 
11 
Turning to the first two points, most of the questions we 
ask about the world are framed in terms of states and 
state leaders. The assumption is made that states are the 
units that really matter in the world today, and the key 
questions are thought to be those that focus on the via-
bility and policy stances of political regimes. While this 
assumption made some sense during the Cold War era, 
it is increasingly problematic. The very ubiquity of eth-
nic conflict points to its limitations. If we are to grasp 
the dynamics and power of ethnic conflict in the mod-
ern world, we must be prepared to look at ethnicity 
from a bottom-up perspective, one that begins with the 
aspirations and needs of groups, not one that always 
begins with the existing pattern of states. 
This is where geography comes in, for a geographical 
perspective provides important insights into ethnicity 
and ethnic relations that go beyond conventional 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
political analyses Its power is ultimately to root 
our understanding of ethnicity in a context that is not 
simply one of political leadership and political initia-
tives. By focusing on the loc-ational, territorial, and 
environmental dimensions of ethnic conflict, a geo-
graphical perspective directs attention to basic opportu-
nities and constraints, to issues that may precipitate 
tensions, and to vital connections across international 
boundaries that may be missed if we approach ethnic 
conflict on a state-by-state basis. Maps can be extraor-
dinarily important tools in this endeavor, for they 
encourage us to think about the relationships between 
ethnic processes on the one hand and their territorial 
and environmental contexts on the other. Maps should 
not be seen as ends unto themselves, however. Rather, 
their usefulness is in helping us to see relationships and 
issues that otherwise might be missed. 
The perspectives on ethnic conflict outlined in this 
paper are suggestive of a larger challenge for US for-
eign policy: the need to redefine our national interest 
in a way that transcends conventional assumptions 
about the power and static character of the existing 
political-territorial order. Ethnic conflicts are likely to 
intensify, not abate, in the years ahead, and in places 
they may well lead to changes in the political organi-
zation of territory. Since there is little the United 
States can do to alter this situation, US foreign policy 
should not be driven by the assumption that regional 
stability is most likely to occur in places where there 
are no changes in the world political map. Instead, 
long-term stability is likely to be achieved only in sit-
uations where political and territorial arrangements 
are organized to protect the basic cultural and political 
rights of ethnic groups. This implies the need for a 
US foreign policy that is open to political-territorial 
structures that promote representative pluralism, 
whether or not those structures reflect the existing 
pattern of states.

Identity, Territory, and Self-Determination: 
Factors Underlying Potential National and 
International Conflict 
David B. Knight 
Dean of Social Sciences 
University of Guelph 
The State 
States' remain the principal territorial framework for 
international society. Whereas all States are legally 
equal within the international system, in geographical 
terms there are great differences within and between 
States, including differences that find reflection in the 
way individual States may be perceived as partici-
pants in the system (Cohen 1991; Knight, 1993). 
The State, a physical and legal entity, is a bounded 
container for the contents of a particular portion of the 
earth's surface, which includes the people, their gov-
ernment, resources, and means for communication 
and movement. The State, theoretically, is "the chief 
custodian of overall social order; it is monitor, comp-
troller, arbitrator" of all people, things, and processes 
operating within the delimited bounds (Greer and 
Orleans, cited in Knight, 1982). Further, as Johnston 
(1982) has observed, the State acts as the promoter of 
accumulation, as the legitimator of capitalism, and as 
the creator of social consensus and order. In order to 
perform these three roles, each State develops its own 
instruments and mechanisms by which the structural 
links between social formation and the State can func-
tion hierarchically and so enable the reproduction of 
the system. 
The State is thus itself a geographical factor because 
things happen that have spatial consequences as a 
result of decisions and actions by State agents and 
institutions. States' actions pertain to their own and 
others' territories. An essential quality of statehood is 
territory; all States have territory that is bounded, for-
mally or informally, by human decisions and actions. 
I State, with a capital "s" herein, refers to an internationally recog-
nized independent, self-governing territory, sometimes called a 
country. State with a lowercase "s" refers to a politico-territorial 
unit within a State, such as Minnesota within the United States. 
Territory 
Territory by itself is a passive concept. People, by 
their beliefs, decisions, and actions, give meaning to 
territory. Territory thus is not; rather, it becomes! It is 
true that many people obtain meaning from "their" 
territory and the landscape within it by believing that 
the territory and its landscape are living entities that 
are already filled with meaning. And it is true that 
such meanings may be reflected in a people's cultural 
ecology, the spatial patterning of their settlement and 
land use systems, their naming of places, their patterns 
of movement, and perhaps in reverential beliefs they 
hold about specific parts of the landscape around 
them. To suggest that these meanings are simply fig-
ments of the collective imagination�parts of the 
"geographies of the mind"�is to be radical, at least 
for those people who accept the apparent truth of such 
meanings. Meanings gained from territory�which are 
really attributions to the territory�reflect a cultural 
relationship with the territory. Consider, for instance, 
the powerful links most US citizens have to Washing-
ton, DC, where the human-created capital landscape 
serves as an important symbolic place for members of 
the American nation. 
A State's territory is thus not value-free; it holds dif-
ferent kinds of meanings for its people versus�but 
from quite different perspectives and degrees of 
knowledge, insight, and appreciation�those who do 
not belong. People of the State will revere and gain 
strength from their territory. People will see certain 
structures or specific locations, such as statues, capital 
cities, battlefields, and even the territory as a whole, as 
sacred or at least very special. In sum, territory is a 
social construction (Williams and Smith, 1983). 
If it is accepted that territory "becomes," then States 
are not geographical givens. No State exists because 
of firm geographical factors. States and their spatial 
parameters�dimensions, shapes, and boundaries�
exist because human actions and various local and 
world economic-political-social processes have led to 
their creation and continuation. These actions and pro-
cesses occur in specific time-space settings and so 
15

Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
involve geographical considerations, with resulting 
actions and processes having sometimes profound, 
sometimes subtle geographical impact. 
For those who belong to and control a territory, there 
will undoubtedly be powerful symbolic links to 
"their" territory, no matter how little the territory is 
actually known or how wealdy it is perceived; it is 
enough that it is theirs! But what if the territory in 
question does not coincide with the bounds of a partic-
ular State, either in terms of its internal or inter-State 
structures? Where there is a distributional disparity, 
there is the potential for conflict. 
The Inherent Contradictions of Territory 
The attachments people have to their territory can 
have spiritual and psychological bases that go deeper 
than anything generated simply by economic factors. 
These attachments and linkages help to bond people 
both to their territory and to others who also "belong" 
to it and accept it as theirs. 
Territory, according to the French geographer Jean 
Gottmann (1973), when delimited with a system of 
government that has effective control over it, provides 
both security and opportunity for those who live 
within its bounds. On the one hand, there is security to 
be gained from being an isolated community, whereas, 
on the other hand, there is opportunity to be derived 
from being a part of a larger whole. Inwardness and 
security, outwardness and opportunity�stress is 
caused by these contradictory dimensions of territory, 
for elements of both undoubtedly are always present 
in any situation. In terms of foreign policy and inter-
national trade and other linkages, States may be fur-
ther along the continuum toward one extreme or the 
other at different times, thus more toward stressing an 
outward-looking opportunity perspective than an 
inward-looking security perspective at one time, and 
vice versa at another. That there is an interplay 
between the two contrasting, fundamental dimensions 
of territory is vital to any understanding of the politi-
cal geography of specific States, the international sys-
tem of States, and the various group politico-territorial 
identities around the globe that are challenging the 
status quo. 
Territorial Processes 
For any State to exist there must be numerous "cen-
tripetal forces" operating that link people, places, and 
socioeconomic and political processes (Whebell 1983; 
table 1). A key process is centralization, whereby the 
people and their territory are "welded" together via 
socioeconomic and political integration. Centraliza-
tion processes vary, and the degrees of success in 
achieving unification, if-such is the goal, also vary. It 
has been almost an article of faith that by the modern-
ization of all within the State's bounds a unified devel-
oped State can be achieved, with the center�be it 
political or economic�providing supposed solutions 
to the development needs of periphery. The efforts of 
the 1950s and 1960s, in many States, did not achieve 
such a goal. Still, even when unity eluded States, 
modernization processes generally linked people and 
regions together. Core-periphery relations have inter-
nal and international dimensions for all States (Gott-
mann, ed., 1980). They operate in colonial situations 
too, as when the center establishes and then strength-
ens its links to the colonial periphery center. 
States also constantly have to deal with various decen-
tralizing processes. Whereas various centripetal forces 
strengthen and unify the State, countervailing, centrif-
ugal forces reduce its cohesion. A weak central gov-
ernment; poor communications; or significant ethnic, 
cultural, religious, or other divisions among people 
within the State serve as examples of centrifugal 
forces. If the divide is too great between a regionally 
based group and the central government, self-determi-
nation and secession may be demanded. To deal with 
demands from a peripheral portion of the State, the 
government may grant devolution whereby legislative 
power is devolved from the center to a region�such 
as what Scots nationalists want from the English-dom-
inated parliamentary center in London or when a new 
sub-State territory is created as in Jura in Switzerland 
(Jenkins, 1986). If centrifugal forces prove to be too 
destructive within a State, a people may demand inter-
nal self-determination by throwing out a government 
and reforming the State, as happended early in the 
1990s in Poland and Hungary when Communist gov-
ernments and their apparatuses were overthrown and

replaced by multiparty democratic systems responsive 
to ballot box results. Colonial rule, under the guidance 
of a governor, is a form of decentralization, as is 
decolonization that occurs by imperial action. 
All States, through their governments, deal with com-
peting centripetal and centrifugal forces. Competition 
between and among the regions of the State and with 
the center provides evidence of this. The selection of a 
capital city generally brings both forces to the surface 
as competing territorially based biases and opinions 
are expressed. Hence the selection of a new capital 
can itself be a territorial process, as evidenced by the 
bitter case in Canada in the 19th century (Knight, 
1992) and in united Germany over whether Berlin 
should once again become the capital. 
17 
Other territorial processes include: 
� Boundary establishment�the creation of limits to a 
territory. This can involve dynamic processes, as 
governments determine the areal extent of their con-
trol. Boundary conflicts remain the primary cause 
for conflict between States (Boundary Bulletin). 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
� Expansionism�the areal extension of a State and 
domination of neighboring States' territories and 
peoples (Parker, 1988) or the claiming of others' ter-
ritories overseas (Christopher 1988). 
� Irredentism�the claiming or taking of another 
State's territory based on a cultural claim, whether 
true or not. Nazi Germany's claiming and taking the 
Sudetenland (in Czechoslovakia) in 1938 is the clas-
sic example. 
� Separatism�the separation of one part from another, 
whether partially or totally. If a regionally based 
group causes friction between the region and the cen-
ter, accord may be achieved by the granting of auton-
omy as in Euskadi, northern Spain. Decolonization 
and the granting of statehood due to demands from 
within a colony is another form of separatism; it is 
significant that most colonies obtained independence 
within their colonially derived boundaries because 
separatist threats were perceived to be too great to 
permit otherwise.2 If an internal-to-a-State solution 
to discord is not enough, the State may disintegrate 
as a result of secessionism, whereby the territory is 
divided into two or more parts as with the recent 
breakup of Czechoslovakia. 
Measures of Identity 
All these territorial processes imply people. Of con-
cern here are people in groups. The word "people" has 
legal meaning; it normally encompasses all the inhab-
itants of a State. All people living within Botswana, 
for example, are said to be Botswana, whether or not 
they all have allegiance to such a definition of group 
"self." Some sub-State groups claim they are "people" 
and thus deserve international recognition (Knight 
1988; Crawford 1988). Many other terms are used to 
describe groups of people, including nations, ethnic 
groups, and tribes. All evoke feelings of self-worth by 
members and feelings of suspicion toward nonmem-
bers. To get around the problems of evocative defini-
tions, I have offered the phrase "group territorial 
2 This conservative View is under threat, as demonstrated by the 
recent creation of Eritrea out of part of Ethiopia, a territorial break 
that perhaps is but a prelude to territorial partitioning and new State 
creation that could occur throughout Africa. 
identity"; that is, if the group becomes active in a 
political manner and makes it needs known with the 
State, it becomes a "group politico-territorial identity" 
(Knight, 1982): 
Group territorial identities, involving as they do 
numerous ways for people to identify and bond and 
yet also to be separate, form an aspect of the geogra-
phies of the mind, because the links�while some-
times having physical expression, as with flags, 
national anthems, favored symbolic sites (Zelinsky, 
1988)�remain essentially in the mind, to turn off or 
on. Each definition of group self implies some other 
group, with different values, different attachments, 
and different allegiances�the description of which 
may not reflect reality from the perspective of that 
other group (Said, 1993; Godlewska and Smith 1994). 
Just as territory has inward and outward conse-
quences, so too does identity. Some groups look 
inward, stressing the need for security, whereas others 
are keen to look outward, seeking opportunities for 
interaction with others. The concepts of territory and 
identity thus share a fundamental tension between 
these competing elements. 
We operate at several levels of identity. At the center 
is the self, normally set within a family. Beyond that, 
we are amazing creatures because we have the capac-
ity to attach ourselves to many aspects of our group 
identities, such as in a neighborhood, a religious com-
munity, a scout troop, a football team, a region of the 
country, or even the nation�all of which are tied to 
particular places (Tuan, 1977). We can flick a switch 
in our minds and change attachments, as is appropriate 
at the moment. But each of us ultimately gives priority 
of belonging to a particular level of abstraction of 
identity. For many people priority in the people-to-ter-
ritory link is at the level of the State. However, for 
many others, priority is given to a lower order alle-
giance. For instance, some may have allegiance to a 
regionally based identity, as to Punjab rather than to 
India. Others may give primary allegiance to their 
tribe/ethnic group/sub-State nation. The latter three 
forms of group identity may be based on claims of 
common ancestry; common language; (selective) his-
tory; traditions; and, above all, in the name of the 
group, a particular territory. 
18

Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
What is not well understood is why people can at one 
moment share a higher level of identity that links two 
or more separate identities but then drop back into plac-
ing their local level of identity first, thus leading to the 
exclusion of previously accepted neighbors and, per-
haps, to conflict. For example, in Yugoslavia people for 
a time accepted a trans-subgroup "Yugoslavian" iden-
tity but then, as the State apparatus rapidly crumbled, 
shucked that ephemeral level of identity and returned to 
giving priority to their age-old ethnic identities. 
Territoriality 
We are all territorial beings, exhibiting territoriality in 
varying manners, depending upon in which culture we 
are brought up. Although people vary from one cul-
ture to another in terms of what they regard as their 
personal space, most will defend their home turf at a 
personal scale�be it the home from burglars, the 
team's territory during a hockey game, or the claimed 
locations for our desks in the office. At a different 
scale, ethnic and national territory may also be 
defended if threatened. Groups, as with individuals, 
exhibit territoriality. Geographer Robert Sack (1981, 
1986) notes that territoriality is a powerful and indis-
pensable geographic strategy for controlling people 
and things by controlling area. Territoriality implies 
the need to possess, occupy, and defend a particular 
territory. 
Why should people sometimes link together and at 
other times not? It is not a given that some people can 
cooperate and share territory whereas others must be 
divided. The link between territory, identity, and terri-
toriality becomes especially dynamic when discord 
exists between two or more group territorial identities 
that share a single space�such as Walloons and 
Flemings in Belgium, Greek hrid Turkish Cypriots in 
Cyprus, contrasting peoples in Sudan�or, indeed, lie 
across the shared bounds of two or more States, as do 
the Kurds in Southwest Asia. 
Self-Determination 
When the concern for identity, territory, territoriality, 
and self-determination are combined, a dynamic defini-
tion is possible: "territory is.. . space to which identity 
is attached by a distinctive group who hold or covet 
that territory and who desire to have full control of it 
for the group's benefit" (Knight, 1982, p. 526). Self-
determination is at once a legal concept that finds 
expression in international law and a geographical con-
cept because it links identity, territory, and the desire 
for control and has territorial processual consequences. 
In the West there is a tendency to discuss human rights 
from an individual basis, whereas in the former USSR 
and in many Third World States stress is given to 
group rights. Group rights form the basis for many 
claims, especially when the nation is involved, 
because most people today still put the needs of their 
nation above personal needs�thus the call to arms is 
so often heeded in times of danger. Group rights also 
find expression in self-determination, for the term is 
used to refer to groups, not individuals. Maoris in 
New Zealand use the word turangawaewae to refer, 
literally, to "the standing place for the feet." Implied 
in this is "the rights of a tribal group in land and the 
consequential rights of individual members of the 
group" (cited in Knight, 1988, p. 126). This phrase 
links identity, territory, and rights. Control is implied 
too, for without control the people's rights and respon-
sibilities cannot be fulfilled, and the identity within 
territory is threatened. Control over both identity and 
territory is self-determination. Many groups, varying 
defined, claim self-determination by maintaining they 
have valid links between their identity and their terri-
tory and have the expectation of rights and control that 
would come from the granting of self-determination. 
Despite the clamoring for self-determination and its 
application following World War I in many places in 
Europe, Woodrow Wilson's Secretary of State, Robert 
Lansing, in 1921 believed that national safety, historic 
rights, and economic interests should take precedence 
over self-determination. He felt the term self-determi-
nation was "loaded with dynamite!" Thus Lansing 
and other politicians then and later, even to this day, 
have given priority to existing States (Knight 1985). 
Although the UN Charter states that "all people have 
the right to self-determination," the UN�which is 
made of representatives of States, after all�gives pri-
ority to respecting the territorial integrity of existing 
19 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
States over any substate group politico-territorial 
identity's claim to part of the State's territory; to do 
otherwise would "dismember or impair, totally or in 
part, the existing State" (UN General Assembly Reso-
lution 2625 (XV), cited in Knight, 1985, P. 259). 
There is an out, for under international law, as cur-
rently written, secession may occur if the majority of 
the people of the total State�or the government, 
which claims to speak in their name�agrees to the 
dismantlement of governmental authority in part of 
the State and to its secession. 
The concern for the territorial integrity of States has 
recently been severely challenged by three things. 
First, by the development of human rights expecta-
tions that are said to apply to all States. Second, by the 
disintegration of the former USSR and the claiming of 
self-determination by numerous formerly sub-State 
groups�some of whom find themselves to be still 
sub-State groups but now within different or restruc-
tured States. Third, by US-led UN interventionist 
actions in several States. Perhaps we will soon see a 
rewriting of international law. Any application of self-
determination implies change, whether change within 
a territory or change as a consequence of the splitting 
of a territory into at least two parts. In each case, peo-
ple, with distinctive identities, seek change. 
Conclusion 
The linked concepts of identity, territory, self-determi-
nation, and numerous territorial processes give power 
and meaning to the actions of many group politico-ter-
ritorial identities who seek to better their lot. While a 
variety of additional factors need to be considered 
when examining potentials for ethnic or national con-
flict (Kliot, 1989; Gosar, ed., 1993), it is necessary to 
appreciate the importance of the essential concepts 
and processes discussed here to more fully appreciate 
why certain conflicts are due to ethnic and national 
tensions, bounded as they are within certain territorial 
structures and influenced by�or which cause--cer-
tain territorial processes. 
Pressures are mounting for territorial (and other) alter-
ations to the existing international system of States. 
Some of the pressures are now severe, as evidenced by 
savagery in parts of the former USSR and Eastern 
Europe, where many distinct group politico-territorial 
identities have sought or are seeking to establish their 
own States separate from the politico-territorial units 
in which they now find themselves. Is the day far off 
before similar pressures mount elsewhere�in Africa, 
Asia, or even the Americas�for secession, with or 
without violence? Not all claims for self-determina-
tion need involve secession, as suggested above, 
because accommodations are often reached within 
existing State structures. Nevertheless, secession as a 
recourse to discord remains�and, indeed, has become 
increasingly�an option.

Summary of General Discussion 
DR. POULSEN: I would like to elaborate on one of 
the points that Dr. Murphy made about ethnic mobili-
zation and socioeconomic status as they relate to terri-
toriality. Dr. Murphy referred to the ability of the 
Serbs to mobilize themselves on the basis of their 
envy and resentment toward the Slovenes and Croats, 
who are much more economically developed. Ethnic 
group mobilization can work in the reverse as well, 
when more developed regions resent the flow of 
resources to poorer regions. For example, the Croatian 
identity that developed since the 1960s certainly origi-
nated, in part, because this group was the productive 
part of Yugoslavia and the Croatians felt that the reve-
nues they generated were being wasted in Serbia and 
in the southern parts of the country. One can point to a 
similar situation in Spain where the separatist feelings 
that exist among the Basques and the Catalonians 
come, not because they lack resources, but, again, 
because they reside in the most productive part of 
Spain�on a per capita basis�and their productivity 
goes to the benefit of non-Catalonian and non-Basque 
regions. 
DR. MURPHY: That is an important point. I tried to 
allude to this after saying there was Serbian resent-
ment of Croats and Slovenes because of the dispropor-
tionate share of tourism-related revenues that they 
receive. The key to understanding socioeconomic pat-
terns in terms of relative location, which is the way I 
framed it, is not simply to think that a map of socio-
economic well-being necessarily tells us something 
about ethnicity, but rather to think about socioeco-
nomic well-being in relation to how it is understood 
and interpreted. Whether you are well off or poor, the 
key issue is whether you feel like your well-being is 
threatened�a feeling of marginalization. That is what 
is important in considering patterns of socioeconomic 
differentiation. 
QUESTION: Both the speakers have presented some 
very tantalizing concepts that I think would fit well 
into a strategy of conflict prevention, which I hope we 
talk a little bit about in the next two days. I would like 
to ask Dr. Murphy to say something about conflict res-
olution. Once people have decided to use guns to 
readjust these territorial boundaries and once that 
dynamic is engaged in places like Bosnia, what can 
the geographic discipline tell policymakers that can 
help us as we attempt conflict resolution�especially 
in cases where the conflicts are violent? 
DR. MURPHY: Conflict resolution is clearly one of 
the most important issues that we have to deal with. It 
is difficult to answer that briefly in a way that gets 
beyond generalities. Nevertheless, let me say a few 
things. 
Understanding the issues of territory, scale, and loca-
tion is necessary to make sensible and intelligent pro-
posals to ameliorate existing conflicts. 
First of all, conflict resolution requires an understand-
ing, in part, of the strategies that are likely to be 
employed by the participants. This, in turn, requires an 
understanding of how participants understand and per-
ceive territory. I think it is actually fairly clear why the 
Serbian military has pursued aggression in particular 
areas. It is further clear why that is happening in terms 
of basic strategic concerns. An understanding of 
underlying territorial motives and objectives, I think, 
is helpful in formulating any kind of response to 
something like the current conflict in the Balkans. 
Another issue that it is necessary to understand in 
terms of conflict resolution is that of scale. One must 
be cognizant of the impact of a particular proposal for 
resolving conflict. An important question that needs to 
be asked is, "What does this solution mean for Bos-
nia?" "What does it mean for the larger Islamic 
world?" 
But third, and most important, is the need to have a 
clear understanding of a region's territorial and ethnic 
realities. Conflict resolution implies some kind of plan 
to create a stable situation. I made some comments 
about the inefficacy of the Vance-Owen plan. I made 
them because the plan and other plans that have been 
articulated for the division of Bosnian territory into 
monoethnic regions fail to take into consideration sev-
eral fundamental territorial and ethnic realities�one 
of which is that, for all the usefulness of the general-
ized ethnic map of the country, it hides as much as it 
23

reveals. We have to recognize that. It is not a reflec-
tion of underlying patterns of territorial ideology, nor 
of functional patterns of interaction before the 1989 
civil war. It is, in fact, not even really in any conceiv-
able way possible to create monoethnic territories in 
that region. This implies the need for a different kind 
of strategy to conflict resolution. 
One would have to use different kinds of strategies in 
dealing with other problems. In the case of Belgium, if 
I were advising the Belgian Government on how to 
keep its ethnoregional situation under control, I would 
suggest giving the old provinces more political-terri-
torial significance within the state. Then their citizens 
could vote on a fiscal issue and have it not always be 
an ethnoregional issue. So the answer, of course, has 
to be tied to the particularities of each case. It seems 
that the issues of territory, scale, and location are part 
of what has to be in the mix in order to make sensible 
and intelligent decisions. 
QUESTION: Is there a correlation between socioeco-
nomic status and ethnic conflicts? Would it be valid to 
say that a commonality in socioeconomic status would 
ameliorate ethnic conflict? Is socioeconomic status a 
factor we should examine in attempting to determine 
whether there is a potential for ethnic conflict? 
How important is marginalization of the deprived 
population a factor in ethnic conflict as opposed to 
merely a difference in socioeconomic status? 
DR. MURPHY: Is there a correlation? Yes. Is it reduc-
ible to socioeconomic differences? The short answer is 
no. The key question�and this plays off of some of 
Dr. Knight's comments�is one of perception. How are 
socioeconomic differences understood and perceived? 
To draw on the Belgium case again, one could take a 
look at that country in the late 19th century and gener-
alize about the north. One could say that northern Bel-
gium was then less well off than southern Belgium, so 
that must be a reason why the Flemish movement 
mobilized at that time. That is a tempting interpreta-
tion if you think in simplistic regional terms�but the 
modern ethnolinguistic regions of Belgium had no 
meaning at that time. There were socioeconomic dif-
ferences between the north and the south, but they 
were understood to be a rural-urban rather than a 
regional phenomenon. Although a statistical correla-
tion existed between region and socioeconomic differ-
ences in the late 19th century, this did not really 
explain ethnic mobilization at that time. The mobiliza-
tion had much more to do with the inability of Flemish 
speakers to use their language in public life. That 
issue, in turn, began to take on regional significance as 
efforts to achieve greater language rights were frus-
trated. 
Socioeconomic differences can be significant; the key 
is to understand how these are perceived and used. 
Would a commonality of-socioeconomic status mean 
that conflicts would not be as intense in many cases? 
Yes. Would it mean ethnic conflict would cease 
entirely? Probably not, because there are lots of other 
issues that correlate as well. I think we made a mis-
take about 15 years ago when we wanted to reduce 
ethnicity to economics. Ultimately, it just does not 
work.

Ethnic and Territorial Conflicts in Eastern Europe 
Ronald Whonan 
Professor of Geography 
University of Oregon 
Introduction 
Today's Eastern Europe consists of Estonia, Latvia, 
Lithuania, Poland, the Czech and Slovak Republics, 
Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovenia, Croatia, Bos-
nia and Herzegovina, Macedonia, Yugoslavia (con-
sisting today of Serbia and Montenegro), Albania, 
Greece, and European (or Thracian) Turkey. One can 
also add to this list Moldova (Bessarabia) and the 
western part of Ukraine, as they are culturally, histori-
cally, and geographically tied to the rest of this greater 
region. At this point in time, on the other hand, East-
ern Germany and Austria should not be considered 
part of the East European realm. The reasons for 
including Greece and Thracian Turkey in Eastern 
Europe are both historical and cultural and represent a 
reality important to the current geopolitical situation 
in the Balkans. These last two regions have always 
been part of the East European culture realm, but for 
purely political and military reasons related to the 
Cold War period they were classified differently. 
Throughout Eastern Europe, there are serious issues of 
nationalism that threaten the stability of individual 
countries as well as the region as a whole. Most seri-
ous of these are conflicts stemming from ethnic- and 
cultural-territorial�geographical�demands by one 
or more parties. While some of the issues center pri-
marily on ethnic, religious, linguistic, or cultural 
rights and privileges, others are manifested in 
extremely serious demands for control of given 
regions, in open conflict based on ethnic or territorial 
claims or in international disputes over the recognition 
or nonrecognition of given countries. 
Most serious for Europe and the United States, how-
ever, are those that deal with territorial conflict based 
on various ethnic claims that demand changes in 
national control of these regions and/or population 
exchanges or attempts at ethnic cleansing. Indeed, 
many of the justifications for current actions are 
related to experiences with ethnic cleansing and popu-
lation resettlement policies in the near or distant past. 
We must be careful to distinguish between issues that 
potentially could lead to serious conflict and those that 
are merely local cultural demands. In the latter cate-
gory are issues related to simple demands for ethnic 
recognition or the right to one or another cultural insti-
tutions (native language in the media and education, 
native language press, or freedom of religion) that do 
not threaten to destabilize any given state or nation or 
that will probably not result in open hostility between 
groups. 
Quite serious to a rapidly changing picture of causes 
for interethnic conflict in Fastern Europe is the war in 
Bosnia and Herzegovina. The current war in Bosnia 
may be the precursor to an even greater war that might 
involve many other nations, including America's 
NATO Allies Turkey and Greece on opposite sides of 
the conflict. In addition, the applied policies by the 
Western powers toward this ongoing conflict affect 
not only the Balkans as a whole but also other parts of 
Eastern Europe and the Middle East. The response, for 
example, to Serbian territorial aggression and ethnic 
genocide (ethnic cleansing) both sets a precedent for 
other countries with problematic minorities and forces 
others to assess their own situations relative to foreign 
nations with exclave populations. 
Before discussing ethnic conflicts in Eastern Europe 
today and the impact of Western policy in the "Yugo-
slav War," a brief discussion is provided on the dis-
tinction between the reasons for and justifications for 
territorial claims. This distinction is necessary if one 
wishes to obtain an accurate picture of ethnoterritorial 
conflict in this diverse region. Claims to territory on 
ethnic, national, religious, linguistic, and historical 
grounds are common around the world. Sometimes 
two groups claim the same territory with differing but 
equally understandable reasons for doing so. The Jew-
ish/Palestinian conflict represents such a situation. 
Here two peoples are fighting over the same piece of 
territory, as it is tied to their current ability to exist as 
distinct nations. On the other hand, many conflicts are 
tied to far more distant issues in which historical 
25

Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
events are distorted to provide a legitimacy for current 
claims. The Greek claim to the name Macedonia is a 
good example of the use of historical justification. 
Reasons deal with actual situations related to actual 
(or perceived) threats, actual security issues, or 
attempts to redress recent injustices that have resulted 
in serious problems for a given people, nation, or 
state. Justifications, on the other hand, are excuses 
used to legitimize the desires or actions of one or 
another group to achieve their own aims. A variety of 
historical�and more so folkloric-historical�justifi-
cations, for example, have played a major role in Ser-
bia's aggression against Croatia and Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, and in Greece's anti-Macedonian 
stance. These two are deeply intertwined and explain 
to a great extent Greece's open support for Serbia in 
the current conflict in Bosnia. 
Potential for Ethnic Conffict in Eastern Europe 
We can divide the current issues of ethnic conflict in 
Eastern Europe into three categories. The first repre-
sents the least problematic situations where individual 
groups request recognition of minority rights. These 
are composed of individual ethnic groups that do not 
threaten the territorial integrity of any nation or whose 
demands or requests will not result in anything more 
than local demonstrations (even violent ones) or pro-
tests. The second category is made up of those ethnic 
issues that may result in some degree of violence or 
even territorial changes that are of local importance 
only (for instance, those that do not threaten greater 
instability throughout the region) or those that are 
quite serious but in which the Western Allies (or the 
United States individually) should not become 
involved. The last category represents those ethnic 
issues that could lead to serious regional conflicts, to 
major international conflict, or to major regional 
destabilization that may require outside intervention. 
Minority Rights Issues 
Minority culture groups exist in every country in East-
ern Europe. There are, for example, populations of 
Jews and Roma (Gypsies) in every country. In addi-
tion, there are ethnic Germans in significant numbers 
in Poland; the Czech, Slovak, and Croatian Republics; 
Romania; and Hungary. Vlah communities exist in 
various parts of former Yugoslavia, Albania, and 
Greece.' In Latvia one also finds a territorially com-
pact group of Latgalians (Catholic Latvians who 
speak a distinct dialect of the Latvian language) 
around the city of Daugavpils. Similarly there are 
Tatars in Romania, Bulgaria, and Moldova who have 
begun to ally themselves with the Turks in Turkey. A 
full listing of ethnic, cultural, and religious minorities 
in the region is not useful because most are of little 
importance other than in cultural contexts. These and 
other cultural questions need not, and should not, be 
given too much shrift by American policymakers. 
In many cases, there are also small groups of one or 
another nationality living in neighboring territories. 
While those of the Russians, Serbs, and Hungarians in 
neighboring countries present serious problems (albeit 
to varying degrees), others do not. Although Slove-
nians in Slovenia hope that the Slovene minorities in 
Italy, Hungary, and Austria will be treated fairly and 
that support will be given to the survival of the Slov-
ene language and culture in those areas, there is little 
chance that any major conflict will erupt involving 
Slovenes in these countries in the near future. The 
same can be said for the small colonies of Croats and 
Serbs in Hungary, the Romanians in border areas of 
Bulgaria and Serbia, or the Poles in Belarus or 
Ukraine. 
Potentially Serious Conflicts on a Local Level 
The second category of ethnic issues in the region 
comprises situations that may lead to serious conflict 
between two or more peoples within a country or 
between neighboring states. This last group is repre-
sented by two types of issues: those related to 
The Vlahs are the descendants of Latinized Myrians from the 
coastal regions of Dalmatia (Latinized during the Roman period) 
who maintained a nomadic or seminomadic way of life through the 
mid-20th century. For the most part, they have been assimilated by 
other Balkan nations, but communities of Vlahs still live in Greece, 
Macedonia, Serbia, Albania, and Bosnia. These peoples should not 
be confused with Romanians who migrated out of Wallachia into 
bordering areas of Serbia and Bulgaria but who are also locally 
called Vlahs (Vlasi). 
26

demands for the return of territories deemed to be 
unjustly under the control of foreign groups or states, 
and those related to the liberation of coethnics living 
in exclave communities in neighboring countries or 
regions. In this first category, I include only those 
issues in which the Western powers cannot or should 
not become involved, in spite of the fact that they may 
result in open warfare. In many of these, however, 
diplomatic discussion before the outbreak of hostili-
ties may be useful. 
There are six potentially serious local conflicts that 
may arise in Eastern Europe that are based on ethnot-
erritorial issues. These include both claims to territo-
ries in other countries that are based on historical 
grievances and issues of national liberation of ethnic 
minorities living in someone else's country. Four con-
cern transborder peoples: 1) the Russian minorities in 
Ukraine and the Baltic states; 2) the Moldovan ques-
tion, which includes both issues of ethnic rights for 
Russians and Ukrainians in Moldova and border 
issues between Ukraine and Romania; 3) a possible 
secessionist movement in western Ukraine; and 4) 
Hungarian minorities in neighboring Slovakia, Serbia, 
and Romania. Two involve minority issues: Muslim 
minorities living in the former Yugoslav lands and 
Bulgaria and ethnic Turkish minorities in the Balkans. 
Russians in Ukraine and the Baltic States 
The collapse of the USSR and the declaration of inde-
pendence by the former non-Russian republics has left 
millions of Russians outside Russia. Their situation is 
debated both locally and in Russia and plays a major 
role in the current political relations of Russia and 
these states. In a few cases, the issue is not just cul-
tural and ethnic. In the cases of Ukraine and Estonia, 
the Russian population has a significant presence on 
the border of Russia, and in those two cases (as with 
Kazakstan), Russian nationalists are demanding that 
these areas be reincorporated into Russia. In eastern 
Ukraine and eastern Estonia, this can be even more 
serious because these regions are major industrial 
areas vital to the economic well-being of these new 
republics. 
The situation of the Russians in Estonia is serious. 
Here the Russian issue is not merely ethnic but also 
territorial. On the eastern margins of Estonia one finds 
a large Russian population. In the area north of Lake 
Peipus (Chudskoe Ozero in Russian) as far as the Bal-
tic Sea, Russians form a clear majority of the popula-
tion. Indeed, Narve is a Russian city in Estonia. There 
is a great potential for a Russian attempt to secede 
from Estonia and join Russia itself. This would lead to 
a great deal of conflict. Most of these Russians do not 
represent the descendants of early Russian immigrants 
to Estonia but rather part of the huge Russian popula-
tion that arrived after World War II. 
In Latvia, Russians�when combined with Belorus-
sians and Ukrainians�account for slightly less than 
half the country's population. In Riga, Slays far out-
number native Latvians. In both Latvia and Estonia, as 
well as in neighboring Lithuania (where the Slays 
compose only about 20 percent of the population), 
there is a fear that Russia may use the presence of 
these significant Russian minority populations as a 
pretext (i.e., a justification) to reincorporate these 
small countries into a new Russian-dominated state. 
In Estonia, Latvia, and�to a lesser extent�Lithuania, 
local governments are devising various forms of legis-
lation to induce the Russians to leave. Although it is 
reasonable for Estonians and Latvians to demand that 
citizens learn the local language and swear allegiance 
to those countries�as all nations of the world demand 
allegiance to the new homeland to obtain citizen-
ship�it is clear that the two states desire to get rid of 
the Russians. Open hostility toward or attacks upon 
Russians will provoke problems with Russia, so it is 
left to a game of politics. This could escalate into a 
serious conflict with Russia, especially if a Russian 
nationalist government arises in Moscow. Regardless 
of how this goes, it is clear that the United States and 
its Western allies cannot and should not do anything in 
the event of such a showdown. On the other hand, the 
West's inaction in the Croatian and Bosnian conflict 
may play a great role in increasing hostilities and con-
flicts in the Baltic region. This is discussed later in this 
paper. 
The Moldovan Question 
Upon declaring independence from the USSR, Mold-
ova found itself in a unique position among the former 
27

Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Soviet Republics, Rather than seeking mere indepen-
dence, it proclaimed its desire to join, or rather rejoin, 
Romania. The Moldovans are Romanians who as a 
result of history found themselves under Russian rule. 
While Russians in Estonia, Latvia, Ukraine, and other 
republics were in general not frightened of the inde-
pendence movements taking place in the non-Russian 
republics, that of Moldova threatened to place them 
under alien (Romanian) rule. Violent protests erupted, 
and open warfare ensued in the Trans-Dniestr region, 
which attempted to secede from Moldova and join 
Ukraine. 
Moldova itself became part of Russia as a result of 
Russian imperial expansionism.2 Moldova was 
annexed from the Ottoman Empire. After World War I 
it was reunited with Romania, only to find itself being 
passed back to the USSR after World War II. This war 
resulted in a drastic diminution of the Jewish and Ger-
man populations, and many Tatars also left for Turkey 
and Romania. On the other hand, Stalin deported 
many Moldovans, attached the southern part of Mold-
ova (Budjak) to Ukraine, and induced the in-migration 
of hundreds of thousands of Russians and Ukrainians. 
In addition, the Trans-Dniestr region, which was for-
merly part of Ukraine, was added to Moldova (in an 
attempt to gerrymander borders, effectively reducing 
the Moldovan proportion of Moldova's population) 
and Bucovina/Bukovina (the area around Chernovits/ 
Chernivtsy) was detached from Romania and trans-
ferred to Ukraine, 
Deep antagonisms exist between Ukrainians and 
Romanians, between Russians and Ukrainians in 
Moldova, and between ethnic Russians and Moldo-
van-Romanians in Romania. Moldovan nationalist 
talk of anschluss between Moldova and Romania has 
led to uprisings among the Russians, Ukrainians, and 
2 In the 19th century, the Russian Empire expanded into areas 
under Ottoman-Turkish control. The region of Bessarabia was 
taken by Russia. No Romania existed at that time. The population 
of Moldova was changed dramatically as a result of this. It already 
had a large Tatar and Jewish population that had come during the 
period of the Ottomans, but, with incorporation into the Russian 
Empire, Orthodox Christians from Bulgaria and other parts of the 
Ottoman Empire (Bulgars, Greeks, Romanians, Gagauz, and even 
some Albanians and Serbs) migrated to Bessarabia. In addition to 
these, Cossacks from the northern Caucasus were settled there by 
Catherine the Great, and Germans were invited to settle there as 
well. Thus, by the 20th century, it already had a very mixed popu-
lation, even though the Romanians (Moldovans) were still in the 
majority. 
other non-Romanians of the region. This has the 
potential to become a serious problem not only on a 
local level but also in Romania as well. We should 
remember that one of Ceasuescu's major demands 
from Brezhnev was the return of Moldova to Roma-
nian control. 
The Gagauz (Bulgarian Orthodox Turks) of Moldova 
have also expressed serious concerns about the rise of 
Moldovan-Romanian nationalism and fear the merger 
of Moldova with Romania.' As such, they have allied 
themselves with the Russian and Ukrainian popula-
tions in Moldova. In and of themselves they do not 
represent a serious problem to Moldova, Romania, or 
Ukraine. Their importance is transient and is tied to 
the greater Slavic-Romanian split in Moldova. 
Western Ukraine 
The western part of Ukraine (Galicia and Ruthenia) 
became part of the Russian Empire and the USSR for 
the first time after World War II. In this area there had 
been a strong Central European and Catholic influ-
ence. Here distinct dialects of Ukrainian are spoken, 
and the Uniate Church has recently been reinstated as 
an officially recognized religion. The Uniate Church 
(Byzantine Rite Catholics) had millions of followers 
among the Ukrainians, Slovaks, Romanians, and Hun-
garians. In most cases this religious institution was 
declared illegal during the Soviet period. Although the 
demands for its recognition are great throughout the 
greater region of Ukraine, only in the western part of 
Ukraine does it represent any potential threat to the 
stability of a nation. Because western Ukraine became 
part of the Soviet Union only in the post�World War II 
period and because the Uniate Church in that region 
used Ukrainian and not Russian as the language of the 
church, it is considered by its members as the "true" 
Ukrainian church. Among Ukrainians themselves 
there is a deep cultural split between those who lived 
under Russian and Soviet rule for the past 200-plus 
years and those who lived under Polish or Austrian 
3 The origin of the Gagauz is still debated. They are either linguisti-
cally Turkified Bulgarians, Bulgarian Orthodox Christianized 
Turks, or a combination of both. Regardless of actual origin, today 
they are Turkish in speech (for instance, Istanbul Turkish) and are 
Bulgarian Orthodox in religion.

rule. Western Ukrainians are demanding more cultural 
and religious autonomy from Ukraine, and this may 
create some potential for real conflict. As yet, how-
ever, it is merely cultural and not political and territo-
rial. Even if it were to bring about open conflict, this is 
a purely internal matter and not of any concern for the 
West or neighboring states. 
Hungarian Minorities. The borders of current Hun-
gary were established after World War I and represent, 
in the eyes of ethnic Hungarians, a diminished state. 
Across those borders are a number of regions with sig-
nificant Hungarian populations. In some, like parts of 
southern Slovakia and northern Vojvodina�in north-
ern Serbia�the Hungarian population forms the 
majority of inhabitants. In Romania, Hungarian com-
munities exist throughout western Romania and in 
Transylvania�a region with great cultural and histori-
cal significance to the Hungarian people. We must 
remember that for more than 150 years Hungary was 
under Ottoman Turkish domination. During that time 
Transylvania and southern Slovakia, as Hungarian 
regions, were independent of the Turks. Indeed, dur-
ing this time Bratislava (Pozsony in Hungarian) was 
the capital of a free Hungary, and until World War I 
ethnic Hungarians outnumbered Slovaks in this city, 
the capital of Slovakia. 
The division of Czechoslovakia into two states has 
changed the sectarianism of living in the area.4 While 
Hungarians were not subject to open policies of Slo-
vakization under the Czech-dominated Czechoslovak 
Government, the situation today is different. The posi-
tion of the Slovak Government is that the Hungarians 
are really Slovaks whose ancestors were forced to 
become Hungarians (Magyars) during the 1,000 years 
of Hungarian rule and therefore should be re-Slovak-
ized. The Hungarians consider southern Slovakia as 
part of the Kingdom of Hungary historically. Indeed 
Kossuth, the father of modern Hungarian nationalism, 
was born in Slovakia (in fact he was a Magyarized 
Slovak). Here we see the use of historical figures and 
events by ethnic groups as the justification for current 
demands on both sides. 
4 The Hungarians saw the Czech majority as advanced and civi-
lized as themselves. The Hungarian view of Slovaks as a people is 
quite different. Slovaks are seen as low in levels of civilization, and 
the Slovaks are also far more anti-Hungarian than the Czechs. 
At high levels in the Hungarian Government, it has 
been made clear to the Slovaks that Hungary does not 
claim territory from Slovakia but that it requests that 
Hungarians in Slovakia be given full citizenship and 
rights as a minority. This is the same position held by 
the Hungarian Government vis a vis Transylvania and 
Vojvodina. But many ethnic Hungarians and lower 
level political leaders are demanding the "return" of 
these "Hungarian lands" to Hungary. As a minimal 
demand, the Hungarians in Hungary appear to be con-
cerned about the rights of their ethnic brethren in 
neighboring countries but are not demanding border 
changes. However�and this is a big however�this 
stance is contingent on fair treatment of Hungarians 
and a continued moderate position of the Hungarian 
regime. Persecution of Hungarians in any neighboring 
country may lead to a severe shift in Budapest's offi-
cial position. This is now being tested in Vojvodina, 
where the Serbian Government is relocating Serbs 
from other areas of Yugoslavia into areas dominated 
by ethnic Hungarians and where young Hungarian 
males are subject to the draft and are being sent to the 
war zone in Bosnia. Many Hungarians have fled 
Vojvodina to Hungary. This is leading to a rise in 
rightwing Hungarian nationalism that may change the 
official position of the Hungarian Government. The 
impact of Western inaction in Bosnia on the Hungar-
ian issues in Vojvodina, Slovakia, and Romania is dis-
cussed later in this paper. 
Muslim Minorities in Yugoslavia and Bulgaria 
After the Ottoman Empire withdrew from the Balkans 
in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a number 
of Islamicized groups remained. Among these were 
Muslim Bosnians (now called Muslimani), Serbs 
(mostly in the Sandzak and Kosovo-Metohija regions 
of Serbia), Macedonians (called Torbesi), Bulgarians 
(called Pomalcs), Greeks, and Albanians.5 Only 
among the Albanians did the Muslim converts form 
5 These Muslims should not be confused with ethnic Turks who 
form a distinct ethnic minority in Bulgaria, Macedonia, Bosnia and 
Herzegovina, Romania, and Greece and who are either the descen-
dants of Turks or of mixed Turkish and other ethnic backgrounds. 
Their ethnic identity is with Turkey, and they do not consider them-
selves to be of local origin.

a majority population in the given group. In all other 
cases the Christian majorities attempted to force con-
version to Christianity or to have the Muslims reclas-
sify themselves as Turks and emigrate to Turkey. In 
addition, a series of population exchanges took place 
during which Muslim groups went to Turkey and 
Christians were resettled in the Balkans. This was 
especially true of the Greeks; hundreds of thousands 
of Greeks emigrated from western and northeastern 
Turkey and were resettled in what is today Greek 
Macedonia and other parts of Greece. 
After World War I, Serbian nationalists followed a 
policy of intimidation of Muslims (both Muslim Slays 
and Albanians) in Serbia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 
and Macedonia (then called South Serbia). Tens of 
thousands fled to Turkey at that time. Bulgaria has 
continued to harass its Muslim Bulgarian population. 
Policies outlawing Muslim cultural practices and 
enforcing name changes (to Christian ones) led to 
massive emigrations to Turkey as well. It was conve-
nient for Greeks, Serbs, Macedonians, Bulgarians, and 
others to purport that these were Turks not Slavic or 
Greek peoples whose ancestors chose to adopt the 
Islamic religion�and to promote emigration. 
The Muslim subgroups, although persecuted, do not 
pose serious threats to their regions. It is interesting to 
note that the Torbesi of western Macedonia and many 
Serbian Muslims of the Sanclzak and Kosovo have 
reclassified themselves as Albanians, rather than 
assimilate into the greater Serbian or Macedonian 
nations. 
The Turkish Minorities 
The Turkish question is still an open one. To date, 
however, the Turkish position (for instance, that of the 
Republic of Turkey) is similar to that of the Hungari-
ans regarding their ethnic compatriots in neighboring 
states. The Turkish Government basically expected 
Bulgaria and Yugoslavia to respect the Turks as ethnic 
minorities in those countries. Recently, Bulgaria pres-
sured ethnic Turks into emigrating to Turkey. Approx-
imately 300,000 Turks left. Although the Turkish 
Government protested this, it did not invade. The 
Turks feel pressured by European powers who use the 
issue of Turkish entry into the European Union as a 
means of keeping Turkey out of intervention in Bul-
garia and parts of former Yugoslavia. In Turkey itself, 
literally millions of Turks have ancestors who immi-
grated from various Balkan countries. These groups 
lobby for Turkish involvement in their homelands to 
protect the Turkish and Muslim peoples there. The 
Turkish situation is discussed at the end of this presen-
tation with particular reference to its relationships 
with Europe and the EU. 
Potentially Serious Conflicts With Implications 
Extending Beyond the Region 
The Macedonian Question 
A very serious situation exists regarding Macedonia, 
in which major ethnic groups�Greeks and Serbs�
and their respective states are attempting to use histor-
ical issues and incidents as justifications for their posi-
tions regarding this territory. 
The Greeks claim title to the name Macedonia based 
on fallacious historical claims. They assert that Alex-
ander the Great was a Greek and that therefore Mace-
donia is Greek�a claim backed by historical records. 
Not only do all early Greek sources make the point 
that he was a non-Greek (the Macedonians were Illyr-
ians related to today's Albanians) but also that the 
Macedonians were the enemy of Greece. Certainly the 
Macedonian Empire maintained Greek language as 
the lingua-franca of the Empire and had a policy of 
Hellenism, but Macedonia was itself not Greek. 
Rather than engage in debates about a man who lived 
in the 4th century BCE, one should consider more 
important historical facts as well as current realities. 
Does the concern deal with the name, with Alexander 
the Great's nationality, or with current ethnoterritorial 
realities? Clearly it is the latter. After the arrival of the 
Slays in Macedonia (including what is today Greek 
Macedonia) starting in the 4th century CE, the Mace-
donian Slays maintained close relations with those of 
Bulgaria. The Macedonian and Bulgarian Slays came 
to form one people with a common language and 
church. After the arrival of the Turks their territory 
was administratively (not ethnically) divided. This 
division lasted into the 19th century when Bulgarians 
(with the help of the Russians) tried to reunite with 
their ethnic Macedonian kinsmen. As a result of West-
ern intervention this was not accomplished.

During the second Balkan War (1912-13) the Greeks 
and Serbs, with the help of the Romanians, invaded 
Bulgaria and took land from it. Romania seized 
Dobrudja (Dobrogea) while the Serbs and Greeks 
divided Macedonia between them. Not only did they 
take the land, but also they instituted policies aimed at 
eradicating the Bulgarian presence and claim. Serbia 
renamed northern Macedonia South Serbia and out-
lawed both the Bulgarian language and church (those 
used by the Macedonians themselves) and replaced 
them with the Serbian language and church. It was 
hoped that the Macedonians of South Serbia would 
become Serbs. Greece was far worse in its treatment 
of Macedonians. Slavic Macedonians (and Bulgarians 
in Thrace) were forced to accept Greek names and call 
themselves Greeks or flee the country. A policy of 
Hellenization was instituted throughout the region. 
Between the second Balkan War and World War II, 
policies of Serbianization, Hellenization, and ethnic 
cleansing were openly practiced in both Macedonia 
and Thrace. The region was also ethnically cleansed 
of Macedonians and Bulgarians, as was Greek Thrace, 
which had a Slavic majority. In addition to this, hun-
dreds of thousands of Greeks from the Pontic region 
of Turkey were resettled into those parts of Macedonia 
under Greek control. 
The Greek objection to the recognition of a Republic 
of Macedonia derives from more than issues related to 
an ancient conqueror. Greece fears the demand for the 
return of the homeland by a free Macedonia and repa-
rations for past atrocities. Greece also fears that the 
ethnic Macedonians will demand their homes back.6 
This is potentially one of the most serious issues in 
Eastern Europe, as it can involve Greece, Bulgaria, 
Serbia, Macedonia, and even Albania in a real war. 
More is said on this later. 
The Serbs and Kosovo 
A similar situation exists in Kosovo, a land claimed 
by both ethnic Albanians and Serbs. Geographical evi-
dence (such as place names) clearly indicates a contin-
uous settlement of the region by ethnic Albanians. The 
Serbian claim is based on a war that took place in the 
6 Macedonians from Greek (Aegean) Macedonia fled to the Ser-
bian-controlled areas of Macedonia as well as to Bulgaria, Austra-
lia, Canada, and the United States after 1913. 
early 13th century. According to legend, the Serbs 
were defeated at the battle of Kosovo and later fled 
north into what is today Greater Serbia.7 Historically, 
however, the Serbs came from the north and were con-
centrated along the Morava valley in what is today the 
heartland of the Serbs.8 It is important to note that it 
was church policy to have geographical diocese 
within which an official language was used. There is 
no question that Kosovo was within the territorial 
domain of the Serbian Orthodox Church, but that does 
not mean that the population living there was Serbian. 
The Battle of Kosovo, the role of Krali Marko, or 
other folktales should not be accepted as a justification 
for Serbian aggression against ethnic Albanians who 
compose about 90 percent of that region today. 
A propaganda campaign against ethnic Albanians was 
part and parcel of Serbian policy long before the cur-
rent crises in Krajina and Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Serbian propoganda claimed that the Patriarsija Con-
vent in Pee was burned to the ground by Albanians 
and that the Serbian nuns there had been raped. I was 
there one year after the alleged fire and rape, and the 
Serbian nuns in the convent knew nothing about such 
an event. The convent was still standing, and there 
was no damage to it whatsoever. Claims were also 
made that Albanians killed, raped, and tortured Serbs 
in the region, yet the local Serbs in Kosovo declared 
to me that that was a rare occurrence. Many Serbs of 
Prizren, Pec, Orahovac, and Djakovica (in the western 
part of Kosovo), on the other hand, told me that pov-
erty forced Serbs to sell their homes and move to Ser-
bia proper. Some laughed at the fact that many Serbs 
who sold their homes to ethnic Albanians in Kosovo 
31 
7 Part of the claim is also that Prince Marko (1Crali Marko) was a 
Serb and that he was killed at this battle. According to their own 
sources, he came from Prilep (in Macedonia). As such, he is 
claimed by Macedonians as a Macedonian and by Bulgarians as a 
Bulgar. He may also have been a Vlah, a people renowned for their 
military abilities at the time. One need recognize that Albanians 
also have epic songs about this battle in which three Albanian 
princes were killed, not only a Serbian one. We should not be dis-
cussing the right to rule Kosovo, as argued by Serbs and Albanians, 
based on 13th century battles or folk songs, or we will have a Bul-
garian-Macedonian-Serbian war as well as a Serbian-Albanian one. 
8 This is most likely the Kingdom of Morava (Moravia) referred to 
in the ancient texts regarding the brothers Kiril (Cyril) and Meted 
(Methodius), not Moravia in the Czech Republic. 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
later claimed to have been forced out in order to get 
special treatment (houses and jobs) in Belgrade and 
other parts of Serbia where housing and jobs are in 
short supply. 
Milosevic and other Serbian nationalists used this type 
of scare tactic to justify the Serbian invasions of east-
ern Croatia (Srem), Croatia's Krajina region, and Bos-
nia and Herzegovina. The threat to Serbian lives, 
property, and security were used, in spite of the fact 
that no such provocations existed. The same tactics 
used in Kosovo were applied to other areas where 
Serbs lived outside Serbia. 
There is a great potential for conflict in Kosovo 
because approximately 1.7 million Albanians reside 
there and because the Serbs claim that Kosovo is not 
only Serbian but also is the Urheimat (original home-
land) of the Serbian people. The Serbians are perse-
cuting Albanians�closing Albanian ethnic 
institutions, engaging in summary arrests and torture 
of Albanians, and expelling Albanians. The Serbian 
regime is also now settling Serbs in the region. This 
region has the greatest potential for ethnic conflict in 
all of Eastern Europe. If the Serbs attempt a similar 
policy as that applied in Bosnia to its native Muslim 
population, it is most likely that Albania will not 
remain inactive. 
Albanians in Macedonia and Kosovo 
Directly across the border from Kosovo is Macedonia, 
with a large Albanian population. In all Macedonia's 
western communes (counties), the Albanians form a 
majority of the population. In those bordering Kosovo 
and Albania (like Tetovo and Gostivar), Albanians 
compose over 90 percent of the local population. 
Because Albanians in Macedonia boycotted the last 
census and because the ethnic Macedonians were sat-
isfied that they did, it is unclear as to the actual popu-
lation of ethnic Albanians in Macedonia itself. Having 
traveled there in 1990, it was obvious that throughout 
western Macedonia the Albanians form a distinct 
majority, and in much of northern and central Mace-
donia they form a significant minority. Should a war 
break out in Kosovo, it is doubtful that Macedonian 
Albanians would not become involved. Refugees from 
Kosovo would flee into Macedonia, which would be 
intolerable to the Slavic Macedonians who already are 
unhappy with their large Albanian population. Thus, a 
war in Kosovo would probably lead to Albanian and 
Macedonian involvement. Such a war has the poten-
tial to also drag in Greece and Turkey. 
The Implications of Western Nonaction in Bosnia 
and Herzegovina 
The war in Bosnia and Herzegovina and in parts of 
Croatia has destabilized the entire region. While some 
may see this as only a local issue of those republics, 
and, as such, not of vital interests to the United States 
or its Western allies, others with more expertise and 
experience in this region recognize the broader impli-
cations of this conflict. The situation of Muslims in 
Serbia and Albanians in Kosovo and Macedonia has 
worsened dramatically as a result of the Serbian poli-
cies in Croatia and Bosnia. It is not only Serbian 
action but also the response by the West that has 
added to the instability. 
Fear of greater Serbian aggression is resulting in a rise 
in anger among the Albanians throughout the region. 
The "what if" scenarios are too numerous to discuss in 
this paper because they depend on many other coun-
tries and issues. What is clear, however, is that Alba-
nians in Kosovo for the moment are resisting Serbian 
attempts to get them to rise up and give the Serbs an 
excuse to come in and smash them. In the event of a 
real war, however, the violence in this region would 
be far greater than that of Bosnia. On the one hand, the 
Serbian attachment to Kosovo is far greater than that 
to Bosnia, and, on the other hand, the Albanians are 
not as traditionally docile as the Bosnian Muslims. In 
addition, Kosovo borders an ethnically Albanian 
nation-state. 
The West's general inaction in Bosnia has also played 
a major role in creating greater destabilization. While 
many Westerners close their eyes to the greater and 
broader implications of this war, members of other 
countries and regions have watched keenly. Two dis-
tinct issues must therefore be addressed: 1) the prece-
dent set and its implications in Eastern Europe itself 
32 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
and 2) the implications for Turkey and the Middle 
Fast. A possible scenario is presented at the end of 
this presentation to illustrate the magnitude that these 
events may take. 
Regardless of actual motive in not aiding the Bosnian 
Muslims or the Croats, the West has created a new sit-
uation throughout the region. Had the United States 
and its European allies come to the rescue of the 
newly established Croatian and Bosnian nations when 
they were invaded by the Serbs, a clear message 
would have been sent that the Western countries sup-
ported democratic multinational states in the newly 
forming countries in Eastern Europe. Many of these 
countries, as fledgling democracies, are struggling 
with situations of multiculturalism and of having large 
and influential ethnic minorities. By not supporting 
such ideas in Croatia and Bosnia, the opposite mes-
sage was sent. 
On the one hand, it was clear by implication that the 
West would not interfere in the internal matters of 
these states regarding ethnic issues and, on the other, 
that ethnic cleansing and brutality were to be only ver-
bally censored. This leads to two problems regarding 
ethnic stability in the region. One is the reaction of 
countries to their ethnic minorities that they perceive 
to be problematic. The other is to actions of states 
fearing outside aggression in the guise of defending 
coethnics in their states. 
In the first case we have indicated to Russia that, if it 
should so desire to reincorporate the Baltic states, 
Ukraine, or Kazakhstan on the pretext of defending 
the ethnic Russians in those territories, then the West 
is unconcerned. This may add fuel to the existing Rus-
sian nationalist groups that demand the return of those 
lands because: 1) they have ethnic Russians living 
there who need to be protected, therefore these lands 
should be under Russian control; and 2) lands once 
under the Russian people must always be part of 
Mother Russia. Similarly, Hungarian nationalists can 
use the same argument to demand the return of Vojvo-
dina and parts of Slovakia and Romania. If it is all 
right for Serbs to invade and ethnically cleanse in the 
name of protecting Serbs in these other regions, then 
why not allow Hungarians, Romanians, Bulgarians, or 
any number of other peoples to readjust national bor-
ders or protect ethnic minorities in other states? 
The inaction on the part of the West to the plight of 
Muslims and Croats in former Yugoslavia may open a 
Pandora's box by promoting, rather than inhibiting, 
ethnic nationalism. A green light has been given in 
regions in which the fires of nationalism were already 
rising as a result of their newfound freedom. In all 
cases of decolonization, ethnic nationalism rises in the 
newly created state. This often results in a demand 
that the colonizer go home. Russians and Serbs today 
are victims of such policies of decolonization, as were 
the English, French, Germans, and others in lands for-
merly controlled by them. 
When nothing was done to stop or punish the Serbs for 
their outrageous behavior, the message was also sent to 
nations that they better get rid of problematic minorities 
now rather than risk intervention from the outside. 
Romanians, Serbs, and Slovaks may perceive the Hun-
garian minorities as a greater threat because the Hun-
garian nationalists in Hungary may try to use the 
existence of Hungarian colonies in neighboring coun-
tries as a pretext to change the borders. Similarly, Esto-
nians and Latvians will fear even more so the existence 
of a large Russian population if the West has made it 
clear that in principle it is all right for Russia to liberate 
their people�the Russians�in Latvia and Estonia. 
Estonian and Latvian nationalists may feel an even 
greater urgency to induce the Russians to leave, so as to 
minimize their chances of losing their independence. 
If the United States and its allies do nothing to stop the 
Serbs in their nationalist drive to ethnically cleanse 
Bosnia and to incorporate other parts of the former 
Yugoslavia, then why should the Serbs not do the 
same in Kosovo and Vojvodina? If the West did noth-
ing in those cases, it most certainly is not going to do 
any more over Kosovo. We have thus promoted more 
Serbian aggression as well as paved the way for possi-
ble Hungarian, Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Estonian, 
Albanian, or other acts of ethnic violence against other 
nations and peoples. 
Had the Serbs been stopped and punished (as the Ger-
mans were during World War II), a clear message 
would have been sent that we do not accept undemo-
cratic behavior. Would it not be better to send the 
message that multinational policies are what the West 
33 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
expects and that the well-being of these states, diplo-
matic recognition, and financial aid are contingent on 
fair treatment of their ethnic minorities. That the West 
bowed to the wishes of Greece and did not recognize 
Macedonia's right to independence based on its con-
cern over a name showed a lack of resolve on the part 
of the West and made it clear to all in Fastern Europe 
that consistency, democracy, and recognition of the 
principle of self-determination is not a part of current 
Western thinking. The messages from this are all 
too clear to the Bulgarians, Macedonians, Turks, and 
others. 
In addition, the example set by inaction in Bosnia 
made it painfully clear to the Muslims in the Middle 
East, including our important ally Turkey, that the 
West does not stand up for the rights of Muslims as a 
people. This perception has been reinforced by the 
ultraright's win in Parisian elections (in which it took 
80 percent of the vote) with the slogan, "Charles le 
Magne stopped the Moors at the Pyrenees and Mitter-
rand gave them Paris and Marseilles," and the anti-
Turkish acts of violence in Germany. By not acting to 
defend the Bosnian Muslims and by tolerating the acts 
of rape, murder, and terror against them by the Serbs, 
the message was given that the West is no friend of 
either Muslims or of the Middle East. 
We should add to this the lack of Western resolve to 
stop the Greeks when they infiltrated Cyprus and pre-
cipitated the invasion by the Turks. Although Western-
ers did not condemn Greek acts of violence against the 
Turks, they did condemn the Turks for invading the 
island and partitioning it. The Turks ask themselves, 
"Why are we condemned for saving the lives of our 
people in Cyprus while the Serbs are permitted, in the 
guise of defending their people, to murder innocent 
Muslims?" During the summer of 1993 throughout 
Turkey pictures were hanging on billboards of a Bos-
nian child with one leg cut off by Serbs with the cap-
tion Bosnanin En Kucuk Gazisi (Bosnia's Youngest 
Warrior of the Faith). This was a tongue in cheek swat 
at the Serbs who call the Bosnian Muslims Islamic 
fundamentalists and claim that they (the Serbs) are 
defending Europe against the Muslim menace. 
If the West is truly concerned about the rise of Islamic 
fundamentalism, then it should reevaluate its position 
regarding the Muslims of Bosnia and Herzegovina. 
Throughout the Middle East anti-Westernism and anti-
Americanism are rising as the Western democracies 
that bomb Iraq, support Israel, and intervene in Mid-
dle Eastern affairs at will do nothing to stop a Chris-
tian country from annihilating a Muslim people. 
A Worst Case Scenario 
Given the above considerations, there is a possibility 
of a major war breaking out in the Balkans. Serbs are 
determined not to allow the formation of an Albanian 
ethnic entity in Kosovo, as they see it as their original 
homeland. Having ethnically cleansed much of Bosnia 
of Muslims and Croats, they have become greatly 
(continued)emboldened with their success. This has 
been exacerbated by the lack of any real deterrents by 
the Western powers. A Serb attempt to ethnically 
cleanse Kosovo may trigger a series of events that will 
draw other peoples and powers into the dispute. It is 
doubtful that Albania will be able to remain neutral 
under those circumstances, and it is most likely that 
Kosovar Albanians would be forced to flee into Mace-
donia and/or Albania itself. 
A regional war might break out that would create 
great instability. The existence of Macedonia as a state 
would again come into question. One possibility is 
that Macedonia would seek reentry into a Yugoslav 
entity. However, the large Albanian population would 
oppose that, and war would be imminent between eth-
nic Macedonians and Albanians in such a case. Mace-
donia lies among hostile Serbia, Bulgaria, Greece, and 
Albania, all of whom lay claim to its land. 
In a war in the Balkans, it is highly possible that Tur-
key might get involved, especially if requested to by 
Albania. We need also consider that hundreds of thou-
sands of Turks in Turkey today are of Albanian-, Bos-
nian-, Serbian-, Macedonian-, Greek- or Bulgarian-
Muslim extraction. Indeed, Kemal Ataturk, the 
founder of the modern Turkish republic, was of Alba-
nian ancestry from Thesalonika (Greece). Just as eth-
nic Americans lobby our government regarding issues 
in their ancestral homelands, so do Turks of Balkan 
descent.

The Turks probably would not heed a call from the 
West to stay out of the conflict because they are abso-
lutely fed up with their so-called Western allies. Dur-
ing my visits to Turkey in 1992 and 1993, anti-
Westernism was apparent everywhere. The lack of 
support for the Turkish position on Cyprus is only a 
minor irritant as compared to Western callousness 
over the issue of Islam in the Balkans. We should not 
forget that it was the Turks who introduced Islam into 
the region and who built the cities of Sarajevo, 
Mostar, Jajce, Konjic, and others that are now sitting 
in ruin. They identify greatly with the monuments 
built by their ancestors and their coreligionists in that 
region. The West has asked much of the Turks in past 
decades�to be a bulwark against Soviet Communism 
during the Cold War; to embargo goods from Iran and 
Iraq (much to the detriment of the Turkish economy); 
and, most recently, to act as a moderating influence 
and as a surrogate for the West in many of the new 
nations of Central Asia. In each case, Turkey has met 
these requests. The Turks are understandably upset, 
then, when the West does not respond to their call to 
protect Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina or Kos-
ovo or to protect ethnic Turks in Cyprus or Bulgaria.9 
Involvement by Turkey in any Balkan conflict would 
most assuredly guarantee that Greece would aid Ser-
bia. Of all their territorial and ethnic problems, the 
Turks agree that it is the Greeks who are the most seri-
ous for them. 
The worst case scenario probably hinges on the Bul-
garians, not only because their country lies between 
Greece, Turkey, Serbia, and Macedonia but also 
because they have real grievances against the Serbs 
(over Macedonia) and Greeks (over Macedonia and 
Thrace). Bulgarians are now, terrified about their 
neighbors going to war; they wish to remain out of the 
fray. However, in the event that Greece and Serbia are 
fighting against Turkey and Albania, Bulgaria might 
be forced into the war. Bulgaria could side with Serbia 
9 Not only did Bulgaria maintain a Policy of intimidation and per-
secution of Bulgarian Muslims (Pomaks) during the 1970s and 
1980s, which resulted in a substantial emigration of Pomaks to 
Turkey, but also in the late 1980s and early 1990s more than 
300,000 ethnic Turks fled Bulgaria as a result of extreme oppres-
sion. The West did little more than protest these acts. This was no 
different from the West's reaction to the Greeks' infiltration of 
Cyprus and the mass murder of ethnic Turks. 
and Greece (their coreligionists) against the Muslim 
Turks and Albanians, but the Bulgarians have a deep 
hatred of the Greeks and Serbs, and Sofia would gain 
nothing from such a situation. On the other hand, if 
Bulgaria sided with Turkey and Albania, it could gain 
territory that it has demanded for two centuries�
Yugoslav and Greek Macedonia, and Greek Thrace 
(thereby gaining access to the Aegean)�and address 
its grievances against Serbia and Greece. Turkey 
would certainly prefer Bulgarian hegemony over 
Thrace, thereby eliminating a border with Greece. 
Turkish seizure of the islands off its coast would also 
guarantee Turkey full access to the Mediterranean 
from Istanbul (something that is currently a problem 
for them because Greece is uncooperative on passage 
through its territorial waters by Turkish ships). 
If such a war broke out, the Croats and Muslims of 
Bosnia and Herzegovina would take revenge against 
the Serbs, and Hungary might use that as a way to 
seize some of the Hungarian-populated northern com-
munes of Vojvodina. Hungarian involvement in an 
international dispute regarding Hungarians in another 
country might lead Romania and/or Slovakia to 
become aggressive against Hungary or the Hungarian 
minorities in their countries. 
If a major war broke out with Greece and Turkey on 
opposite sides, what would the West do? If it backed 
Greece and closed all possibilities of Turkey joining 
the EU, Turkey would undoubtedly shift away from 
the West to a more Islamic position. Clearly, internal 
pressures in Turkey�which are already mounting�
would dictate such a move regardless of the desires of 
the moderate government. Even a neutral stance by 
the West would result in a Turkish popular backlash. 
Of great importance is the position of Russia as a 
major power. While Russia may back Serbia in its war 
against Croatia or the Bosnian Muslims, it would back 
Bulgaria and Turkey should they become allies against 
Serbia. Russia's traditional ally in the Balkans has 
always been Bulgaria and not Serbia (which in the � 
Cold War sided with the anti-Soviet West). It would 
also be useful to Russia to use such a stance to improve 
35 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268

its relations with Turkey. Thus, in the event of a widen-
ing war, we may find Serbia and Greece isolated and 
Turkey, Bulgaria, and Albania backed by Russia, 
Croatia, Hungary, and many Middle Eastern States. It 
is doubtful that we could do anything under those cir-
cumstances in terms of any involvement. 
Although one can paint other scenarios, one thing is 
clear�the West made a grave error in allowing and 
promoting Serbian aggression. Some say it is too late 
to do anything. That is an absurd position. In 1940 one 
could say that Germany had won the war and that it 
was too late to do anything to free Poland or Czecho-
slovakia. The Russians proved otherwise. Serbia is not 
a great power and need not be feared. If after three 
years of vast military superiority the Serbs still have 
not won, they would be easy to push back. The main-
tenance of the embargo against the Bosnian Muslims 
should be lifted and airpower should be used to liber-
ate Bosnia. It is certainly not too late to do that. 
By continuing to legitimize Serbian aggression, we 
are once again letting the people of Eastern Europe 
know that we do not support democratic governments 
or independent nation-states in that region. We should 
therefore not be surprised that a greater and far more 
serious war may be looming on the horizon. The 
alienation of the Turks and of Turkey is a far more 
serious issue in the realm of geopolitical reality than 
the support of Serbian delusions of grandeur. We risk 
not only a great Balkan war but also one that may 
result in Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey changing their 
national borders. Inaction in Bosnia has also resulted 
in a massive rise of anti-Western and anti-American 
sentiment throughout the Middle Fast and other Mus-
lim areas. The United States should rethink its posi-
tion on Serbia.

Summary of Discussion 
Discussant: Thomas Poulsen 
Professor Wixman has laid out both in the paper that 
he wrote and in summary presentation some of the key 
elements that explain the Bosnian situation. I would 
like to underscore a few of them. The first element has 
to do with the Serbian justification for their actions. A 
concept that is helpful in explaining the Serbian posi-
tion is that of iconography, which was coined a num-
ber of years ago by the geographer Jean Gottman. 
Gottman defined iconography as the sum total of the 
perceptions of history, national symbols, and trivia 
that go to segregate one nation from another. 
According to Serbian iconography, they are a heroic 
people. The Serbs believe that they saved Europe from 
the Muslim hordes. They also believe that Yugosla-
via�the Yugoslavia created in 1918�was their 
nation-state and that it was their rightful prize because 
they had won World War I, which was just a continua-
tion of their long defense of Europe. This perception 
can help to explain why the Serbs still see themselves 
as victims in the current conflict when most outside 
observers see them as the aggressors. 
The Serbs also believe that their homeland was Kos-
ovo, a belief derived from the fact that they suffered 
their greatest defeat in the Battle of Kosovo in 1389, 
although Dr. Wixman can convincingly argue that this 
belief is not based on fact. He could cite an examina-
tion of place names and a number of other features 
that cast doubt on the Serbian assertion. But such 
arguments would not change Serbian beliefs. All justi-
fications are real to the justifiers, and in the case of the 
Serbs�as with most people�it's not what really hap-
pens that counts, but what people believe happened. 
The Serbs were wrong in trying to maintain control of 
all of Yugoslavia. They are wrong now in trying to 
maintain control of all of Bosnia and Herzegovina. I 
still think they have pretensions to the rest. 
Another point that Dr. Wixman brought up that I 
would like to comment on is that of the role of emi-
gres in defining national identity. There are some who 
would attribute the Slovak separatism that led to the 
demise of the Czechoslovakian state as much to the 
effort of Americans of Slovak ancestry who returned 
after the fall of Communism with images and feelings 
of the 1920s and the 1930s as to any real problems in 
the region. The same can be said, perhaps, for some of 
the stronger original aspects of Croatian nationalism. 
However, many Croatians who were content to live in 
Yugoslavia and be proud of their Roman Catholic eth-
nic heritage became Croatian nationalists as a reaction 
to Serbian action. 
My last point deals with the issue of core and periph-
ery. It has been suggested that, in looking at the inten-
sity of national feelings, we should consider core 
regions and intellectuals. Certainly�based on my 
experience�for an extended period of time those in 
Croatia who promoted a sense of difference and the 
need to get Croatian "rights" somehow satisfied were 
the professors, the schoolteachers, and the intellectu-
als. But in addition to students, those who were most 
motivated to obtain such rights were not the people of 
the core area but were, in fact, the people in the border 
regions. This is a point that Dr. Wixman also made. In 
Croatia, for example, the strongest members of the 
Ustasha, the Croatian nationalist party during World 
War II, did not come from Zagreb but from the outer 
periphery, particularly in eastern Slavonia adjacent to 
the Serbian region. There, they had been challenged in 
their Croatian identity by living with Serbs. To use a 
more local example, during my lifetime, one could 
find "120-percent Americans" in the Canal Zone more 
frequently than in the state of Oregon. 
General Discussion 
QUESTION: Professor Wixman, could you discuss 
the origin of the Muslim population in the Sandzak? 
DR. WIXMAN: The origin of the Muslim people is 
the same as that of the Muslim peoples of Bulgaria 
(Pomalcs), Macedonia (Torbesi), Bosnia and Herce-
govina (Muslimani), Albania, and Serbia, including 
the Sandzak. When the Turks came into the Balkans a 
major conversion of local populations occured. Most 
39

Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
of the converts were related to the Nestorian Christian 
movement (Bogomils) who formed a third Christian 
group throughout the Balkans at that time�that is, in 
addition to the formal Catholic and Eastern Orthodox 
groups. Having been persecuted by these churches, 
the Bogomils welcomed the Turks and willingly 
embraced Islam. Those peoples of mixed ThrIcish 
(usually the descendants of Turkish soldiers and 
locally converted women) tended to call themselves 
Turks, while those that were not of mixed ancestry 
retained other appellations (as mentioned above). In 
the Sandzak many locals adopted Islam, along with 
many of the Albanians. It is important to note that 
among the Greeks and Serbs when someone converted 
to Islam they were rejected as members of those eth-
nic communities and were usually considered Turks. 
On the other hand, among the Macedonian, Albanian, 
and Bulgarian peoples there was a tendency to iden-
tify the converts as Moslem Macedonians, Albanians, 
and Bulgarians, or just as Moslems. Those who con-
verted to Islam frequently intermarried with Turks and 
with each other. The Sandzak Moslems of Serbia 
were, as the other Muslim peoples of the Balkans, pro-
Turkish in their cultural and political leanings. 
QUESTION: What role does religion play in the con-
flict in former Yugoslavia? 
DR. WDCMAN: It is the position of the Catholic lead-
ers of Zagreb and the Serbian patriarch in Belgrade 
that this is not a religious war. The religious overtones 
of the current conflict are largely the result of the 
elites�former Communist Party heads and intellectu-
als�of Zagreb, Belgrade, Bucharest, and Budapest 
assigning identities to local populations who often did 
not self-identify on the basis of religion. For example, 
Muslim Serbs and Muslim Croats never defined them-
selves as a people. They never said that they were 
Muslims. They called themselves Bosnians (Bos-
niaks). They were defined by the Yugoslav Govern-
ment in 1971 as Aluslimani. When the conflict got out 
of hand in Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgrade pressed 
the idea that the Muslims must become Christian. In 
the Sandzak no one thought of themselves as Serbs or 
as Muslims. In the same way, the former atheistic Bul-
garian Communist Government said that, in order to 
be a good Bulgarian, Turks had to change their names 
to Bulgarian names�that means from Muslim to 
Christian ones. In Albania, it was the reverse. 
The Sandzak Muslims are under pressure to convert in 
order to prove that they are true Serbo-Macedonians. 
In terms of conflict, these Muslims know that they 
have no choice but to ally themselves with Albanians. 
There is an interesting demographic trend taking 
place. The Muslims of Macedonia have made their 
position clear: they are giving up Macedonian and are 
beginning to speak Albanian. Albanianism has 
become almost a rallying point for Muslims of Serbia 
and Macedonia under the current context. 
DR. POULSEN: To understand Bosnia, I think, per-
haps, a better perspective is to look at the situation in 
Northern Ireland because that is not a religious war 
either. Although people are identified on the basis of 
the traditional religions that they have inherited, the 
roots of the conflict lie in two different nations that are 
warring in a very small area. 
DR. WDCMAN: With regard to the situation in the 
former Yugoslavia, the most important issue to the 
Croats today is the Krajina. They will never compro-
mise on it and they cannot. If the Serbs take Krajina 
and create a separate state or annex it to the new Ser-
bian republic of Bosnia, all coastal Croatia and Herze-
govina would be isolated and would fall of its own 
accord. Serbs will temporarily accommodate Croatian 
positions because they know that, as long as the West 
insists that there be a peace treaty in which this 
remains in Serbian hands, this falls tomorrow. 
Serbian goals are to create a greater Serbia. The Serbs 
of Serbia do not care about the Serbs of Krajina. The 
Serbs want Krajina as a piece of geographical terri-
tory, and the Serbs who live there became their excuse 
to get it. 
QUESTION: Dr. Wixman, could you comment on the 
conditions under which you think Albania might actu-
ally become involved in the Kosovo situation? I ask 
this against the backdrop that many people think of 
Albania itself as an ethnically homogeneous country. 
In fact, as you well know and have written about, it is 
a country divided between Tosks and Gegs, and the 
Tosks are very much in control in Albania, yet it's the 
Gags who are in Kosovo.

DR. WDCMAN: I think that's very crucial to under-
standing why the Albanians never claimed Kosovo. 
Of the 5 million Albanians in the Balkans, 3 million 
are Gegs. But two-thirds of Albanians in Albania are 
Tosk, and one-third are Geg. If Albania incorporated 
Kosovo with its Geg majority�and, by the way, the 
Geg and Tosk dialects are not close enough to be 
mutually understandable, and the two peoples have 
very different cultures�Albania would have been 
dominated by Gegs. This is one reason why Albania 
as a state and as a nation is cool toward the idea of 
incorporating Kosovo. However, that said, the hatred 
41 
toward the Serbs is growing throughout the area. If the 
Serbs really attempt to annihilate the Kosovar Alba-
nians as they did the Bosnian Muslims, can Albania 
Sit back and maintain any credibility? 
I think Albania thinks that it may be backed by Tur-
key, which in reality may be the case. The Turks are 
improving their relations with Albania and are making 
it clear that Kosovo is where they draw the line.

Introduction 
Ethnic conflicts that challenge the existing order are a 
recurrent feature of the European political landscape. 
A critical feature of European history, which has pro-
duced successive periods of ethnic conflict, has been 
the relative lack of congruence among population, set-
tlement patterns, and the political organization of 
space and territory. Sovereignty over European terri-
tory was initially determined by church and dynastic 
settlements following periodic warfare and population 
transfer. Indigenous majorities usually, albeit not nec-
essarily, formed the constituent population of essen-
tially multiethnic states and often discriminated 
against nonnationals. 
Central to the process of legitimizing some cultures 
and alienating others has been the rise of the "territo-
rial nation-state." Most histories of state formation 
and nation building have involved the institutional 
denial of minority rights�initially justified on reli-
gious grounds and more recently reflecting the exigen-
cies of state nationalism. During the period of 
chauvinistic nationalism and state expansion�
roughly 1789 to 1919�the destruction of-ethnic 
minority cultures was deemed a necessary concomi-
tant of modernity and progress. As the uneven effects 
of capitalism penetrated into the marginal, ethnically 
differentiated peripheries of Europe, outmoded cul-
tures were considered to be anathema to the realiza-
tion of a fully integrated national market. "Nation 
states" often sought to socialize their citizenry through 
a number of pivotal agencies�principally the educa-
tion system, conscription into the armed forces, and 
legislation. These new state-controlled domains struc-
tured the range of identities that were to be recognized 
and sanctioned in the public realm. As a consequence, 
many of the current conflicts based in part upon ethnic 
considerations are the result of this historical lack of 
congruence among self-determination, economic 
development, and political representation. 
I will address several types of ethnic issues facing 
contemporary Western Europe, highlight the most 
pressing, and draw implications for multiethnic 
accommodation and adjustment to a changing global 
order. My concern throughout will be to emphasize a 
spatial perspective at urban, regional, and continental 
scales. 
Ethnic Tensions Along a Frontier Divide: Northern 
Ireland 
The Northern Ireland problem�misguidedly labeled 
a religious conflict�is a classic illustration of the jux-
taposition of two ethnic groups, a common feature of 
European borderlands. It is also the most persistent, 
intractable ethnic conflict at present within the Euro-
pean Community. As a result of the English coloniza-
tion of Ireland, a process that was contemporary with 
the English colonization of North America (see 
R. Sack, 1986, pp. 138-140), a major "shatter belt" 
was created in Ulster. This belt divided Catholic from 
Protestant, Celt from Anglo-Saxon, the gavelldnd 
from the primogeniture inheritance system, and an 
agrarian economy from an industrial one (see T. Jor-
dan, 1988, pp. 89-146, 393-407). 
A cultural border is evident in Belfast; the neighbor-
hood divide equates to a national, if not an interna-
tional, divide. The divide is a permanent focus of 
stress and violence because it is not only a place-
specific frontier zone but also the cultural interface 
between two opposing systems. In an excellent over-
view of the political geography of Belfast's main 
troublespot, the Shankill-Falls divide, Boal and Liv-
ingstone (1983, pp. 138-58) examine the context in 
which the conflict takes place. 
42

Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
In coming to grips with the behavioral patterns in the 
Shankill-Falls frontier,. . . it must be recognized that 
the two territories forming the frontier zone do not 
nest compatibly within the same state�they are parts 
of two apparently incompatible nationalisms, the 
Irish on the one hand and the Northern Irish version 
of the British on the other.. .. Thus the orientation of 
the Protestant Shankill is "Ulster and British" while 
the Roman Catholic Clonard is "Celtic Irish" in incli-
nation. This suggests, therefore, that the local frontier 
in the vicinity of Cupar Street is not just an expres-
sion of urban ethnic differences, but is a microcosm 
of national division. Boal and Livingstone, 1983, p. 
154. (See figure 2.) 
Boal and Livingstone draw attention to the signifi-
cance of scale and the possibility of international ten-
sions being focused within an urban district. 
Depending on which level in the scale hierarchy one 
chooses, specific places, such as the Clonard and 
South Shankill, can be successively interpreted as: 
1) peripheries of West Belfast; 2) peripheries of their 
respective national cores�Roman Catholic Ireland 
and Protestant Northern Ireland; or 3) a periphery 
within a periphery of Great Britain and Northern Ire-
land, what Seamus Heaney (1975, p. 60) has called 
the "besieged within the siege." (See figure 3.) 
In their discussion, Boal and Livingstone also bring to 
the fore the question of how to interpret place specific 
events in such a context. They analyze the influence 
that culture, stress, violence, and lack of information 
have on the conduct and intensity of group conflict 
where key strategic locations are so infused with sym-
bolic meaning that any criminal act can be interpreted 
as a "political demonstration of loyalty" to one side or 
the other. This is the geographic equivalent of some 
prisoners, who, as in the Easter Rising of 1916, refuse 
to accept their classification as "common criminals" 
but rather as "political prisoners of war" regardless of 
the nature and type of offence committed. History has 
a way of mythologizing the mundane, and often 
squalid, acts of man as martyrdom and heroism. 
This concept of a frontier divide could also be applied 
elsewhere in Europe, for example, within Brussels and 
along the Belgian linguistic divide. It also has mean-
ing for the cultural zone of transition separating Que-
bec from the rest of Canada. 
43 
The current cease-fire and complex negotiations to 
reintroduce Sinn Fein into the political process as a 
constitutional actor are finely balanced�dependent 
on a combination of Republican political realism and 
ConservatistfUnionist compromise. However, the 
British-Irish border, together with the urban enclaves 
of Republican support in Belfast and Derry, will be 
significant geographic reminders that political ideals 
and principles are often rooted in very specific locales 
and are given real purchase by varying perceptions of 
place. 
Minority Nationalism 
Ethnic minorities are an important element in the 
political landscape of Western Europe. Much of the 
power of minority autonomist nationalism in the 
region lies in the ability of minority leaders to mobi-
lize people on the basis of their historical occupation 
of the land. Territory figures prominently as a context 
for sociopolitical processes and as a repository for a 
threatened group identity and sustenance, while 
nationalism�despite its potential for destruction�
provides a beguilingly complete sociocultural frame-
work for political and economic action. Herein lies the 
significance of resisting harmful outside influences in 
both material and cultural-ideological terms and the 
concern with developing a comprehensive definition 
of the nation and its territory to establish political 
legitimacy that can provide the basis for a call for 
some form of autonomy (Williams, 1994). A. D. 
Smith (1993, p.11) has phrased its allure thus: 
nations derive their profound hold over the feelings 
and imaginations of the people because they are his-
torically embedded. They are rooted in older and 
more long-lasting ethnic ties, myths, and sentiments 
from which these modem nations draw much of their 
emotional and cultural sustenance and much of what 
makes them distinctive, even unique. If nationalism is 
the normalization of the unique, then we should not 
be baffled by its global power. It satisfies the dual 
craving to preserve what is felt to be a collective self 
and all its special culture values, while inserting that 
self as a political community into the community of 
nations by endowing it with the standard attributes of 
the nation.

The inset in the column to the right outlines 10 struc-
tural characteristics of minority nationalism; figure 4 
illustrates where such nationalism is most virulent 
today. 
Ethnicity and Territorial Separatism: The Basques 
The most critical form of minority nationalism in the 
European Union (EU) today is separatism, which is 
manifest in a surprisingly large number of member 
states and which in some respects acts as a counter to 
the general thrust of globalization and integration so 
suggestive of the so-called "postmodemist New World 
Order" (Williams, 1993). The complex process of sep-
aratism can be schematized as in figure 5, which is 
derived from a larger project on political territorial 
adjustment being undertaken by C. F. J. Whebell. 
In postwar Europe, separatism is best illustrated by the 
Basque case, though it has relevance in explaining the 
Corsican, Flemish, and various Celtic cases as well. 
The Basques have enjoyed long periods of relative 
autonomy before their incorporation into the Spanish 
state; elements of their institutional distinctiveness, 
the fueros, survived until fairly recently and were used 
as evidence of a prior claim to legitimate statehood. 
Their language and culture were deemed unique 
because they were unrelated to any Indo-European 
language group and were among the oldest surviving 
elements of civilization in Europe. 
Under the impress of state building, the government 
sought to ruthlessly eradicate non-Spanish elements, 
producing a deep resentment within the Basque com-
munity. State oppression was confirmed during the 
Spanish Civil War and sustained thereafter when the 
Spanish forces were regarded as constituting an inter-
nal colonial military occupation. This is similar to the 
Irish Republican nationalist interpretation of the role 
of British troops in Northern Ireland. Thereafter, vio-
lence and oppression characterized Basque-Madrid 
relations as the Franco regime sought to eradicate 
local political dissent and to destroy Basque cultural 
identity.

role of violence as a movement strategy. He has also 
drawn attention to the manner in which the Spanish 
state sought to placate ethnic demands for separatism 
by offering a form of regional autonomy to Euskadi, 
Catalonia, Gallicia, and Andalucia. The gesture origi-
nally generated much euphoria but was followed by a 
decade of disappointment that was manifest in what 
he calls the "rejectionist option"�whereby the major-
ity of the electorate in the Basque provinces consis-
tently voted in an anti-Madrid fashion. The trend is 
obvious in each-of the seven elections held since the 
Basque Autonomy Statute entered force. The situation 
was compounded by the post-1987 trend in which 
regionalist parties gained electoral strength in Valen-
cia, Aragon, Navarra, Majorca, Cantabria, and Canar-
ias�areas that had little, if any, sense of historical 
regionalism. 
The nature of Basque nationalism is likely to change 
as postindustrial Spain continues to evolve and adjust. 
The trend toward a loosening of the central grip_on the 
constituent regions is gathering pace here as in many 
other European states. Clark forecasts that: 
as advanced industrial societies become more com-
plex, diverse, and pluralistic, they require regimes 
that are more decentralized, disaggregated, and 
autonomous. In Spain, where the existing local and 
provincial units may be too small or too restricted in 
other ways to assume a vigorous role in the manage-
ment of society, the solution lies in the creation of 
middle-range political entities called `meso-govern-
ments,' smaller than the nation-state, but larger and 
more encompassing than cities and provinces" 
(p. 41). 
This conclusion is valid for Italy, France, Belgium, 
and the United Kingdom but unlikely to be adopted 
willingly, especially in the latter. 
If the drift toward separatism in Spain is contained, 
however, a significant ethnic issue will remain in 
Euskadi and Catalonia. There is increasing evidence 
that the post-Franco reforms designed to introduce 
Eusquerra and Catalan to new public domains, such as 
education, commerce, the media, and the law, have 
been less effective than anticipated in assimilating 
nonindigenous Spaniards and North Africans into the 
new nationalist social order. 
The nation-state structure, though fiercely criticized, 
is also a near-permanent political feature, and it will 
structure the degree of regional autonomy available to 
substate nationalities. A "Europe of the Nations" ideal 
is still a long way removed from the regional eco-
nomic reality that most groups must face but, despite 
the apparent impracticability of the desire for regional 
autarky, remains one of the most strident voices heard 
in Europe. 
The Nation-State in Transition? 
The nation-state is being challenged and reevaluated 
by a number of contemporary forces, both from above 
and from below. Within the new European order, two 
trends have a particular bearing on the capacity of eth-
nolinguistic minorities to renegotiate their role in the 
European division of labor. The first is the weakening 
of national economic sovereignty and the transfer of 
key economic powers from state legislatures to the 
European Commission, and the second is the sharing 
of political authority among units in the state system. 
Despite the current difficulties with the European 
Monetary Regime (ERM) and the post-Maastricht 
negotiations, the European Union has gone a long way 
toward an integrated management of the constituent 
economies. It has established policies on competition, 
trade, monetary exchange rates, science and techno-
logical research, and�to some extent�foreign 
affairs. At the regional level the growth of agreements 
such as the Four Motors program, which linked 
Baden-Wurttemberg, Rhones Alpes, Lombardy, Cata-
lonia, and Wales, help sustain an element of relative 
autonomy from the central state apparatus; this is par-
ticularly important for job creation and for construct-
ing a more diverse economic profile than has hitherto 
been the case. In places like Catalonia and Wales, 
where inhabitants continue to speak indigenous lan-
guages, this decentralization is an obvious way to 
slow down outmigration and language shift, thereby 
easing one of the key determinants of ethnic antago-
nism. Such moves represent a broader pattern of 
attempts that seek to bypass some central state author-
ity and nurture regional-level power.

We may not need to establish a de jure Federal Europe 
if many regions will increasingly operate as if they 
were constituents of a de facto Federal Europe. This is 
because both at the state and, to a lesser extent, at the 
regional level, conventional political authority�tradi-
tionally encapsulated in the concept of sovereignty�
is increasingly shared among a number of units within 
the state system. The absolute nature of the nation-
state can no longer be sustained as if it were a closed 
system. Pooled sovereignty, permeable borders, Euro-
pean Community-wide socioeconomic and-environ-
mental policymaking, freedom of movement and to a 
lesser extent shared foreign policy�through interre-
lated agencies such as the Western European Union, 
NATO, CSCE�all characterize the contemporary 
state system and render it more interdependent, both 
on respective member states and on subordinate con-
stituent regions. Clearly such integration and mutual 
dependence is not without its structural strains. 
Ethnic Insiders and Ethnic Outsiders 
The major ethnic issue facing Western Europe in the 
coming decade is the question of the status of outsid-
ers. Since the 1960s several regions have experienced 
an influx of migrants who are often religiously, ideo-
logically, and racially different from indigenous Euro-
peans. Approximately 30 million people entered 
Western Europe between 1945 and 1975, one of the 
largest migratory movements in modern history. An 
estimated 13 million legally settled non-Europeans, 
and perhaps as many as 2 million "illegals," are within 
the European Union. Tension between indigenous 
Community members and "outsiders" is present and 
most likely will increase. 
The "outsider" question has become significant in the 
context of the collapse of the bipolar system and the 
emergence of a new world order. At least two major, 
contradictory processes are at work here. The first is 
the opening up of Europe to democratic ideals and 
representative politics, which follows the advance of= 
capitalism eastward and its penetration and creation of 
markets, resources, and supply sources. The other, 
occurring simultaneously, is a reaction that seeks to 
protect the individual character of West European 
states by closing borders and limiting immigration. 
The resulting tension in the hindrance of the free 
movement of people, ideas, and goods is a major 
source of ethnic tension. Neonationalism, facism, 
crypto-Communism, and blatant racism are all too 
obvious a response. 
Race and Ethnicity 
It might have been assumed that in tandem with the 
so-called "ethnic revival" of postwar Europe would 
have come an increased tolerance to racial as well as 
-ethnic minorities. However, this is not the case. As 
MacLaughlin (1993) demonstrates, both ethnicity and 
race are being used to categorize groups and structure 
policies in ways that defend the integrity of Europe-
ans. Within sections of the European media and the 
political arena, ethnicity is increasingly used to refer 
to the positive, quasibiological identity that links an 
indigenous group to a specific place in Europe. Race, 
in contrast, has come to "signify a set of imaginary 
properties of inheritance that fix and legitimate real 
positions of social domination or subordination in 
terms of cultural differences between native and for-
eigner in the European Community," (MacLaughlin, 
1993). As a classificatory category it reflects prima-
rily, if not exclusively, negative tendencies of dissoci-
ation and exclusion at state and EU levels. 
Ethnicity, Migration, and Frontiers 
For this crude distinction between ethnic and racial 
categorization to be maintained in an increasingly 
multiethnic world, Europe has to reinterpret its posi-
tion, to defend its frontiers from incursions from the 
east, mass migration from the south, and refugee 
absorption from the Balkans. What sort of society 
would a fortress Europe thus conceived seek to con-
struct? Surely such isolationism, state-inspired nation-
alism, and racial cleansing is an anathema to the 
European dream of free movement of labor and open 
borders? Unfortunately not; the lessons of history 
remind us that every generation since 1648 has fought 
for the control of the Lotharingian Axis�the Rhine-
Rhone Corridor�and its associated networks. 
Granted that the European Union exists in part to seal 
the respective futures of West European societies 
within one common framework, but the issues of 
50 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
movement and border vigilance have not been lost, 
merely shifted further east. Geographers, who have a 
long-established interest in Migration, displacement, 
and territorial adjustment, are contributing to our 
understanding of the changing patterns. 
James Walsh (1992) has provided an overview that 
suggests that in France the threat of increasing migra-
tion of Muslims animates racial passions. Fully 
3.5 million foreigners make up 6.2 percent of the total 
population. The migrants are accused of such things as 
depressing average economic wage levels, refusing to 
integrate, clustering in Islamic neighborhoods, and 
undermining French culture and customs. Such 
charges serve the cause of the National Front under 
Le Pen, who won 38 percent of the November 1991 
election vote and, in the regional elections of 1992, 
gave the National Front a larger percentage of the vote 
than the Socialist Party under Francois Mitterrand. 
Bruno Megret, a leading theoretician of the National 
Front, has announced a package of migration-curbing 
proposals: 1) posting of $180,000 bond by all non-
European visitors, 2) mandatory AIDS testing, 
3) review of the status of all aliens in France, 4) 
stricter border control, 5) no family unity doctrine, 
6) repeal of the agreement on freedom of movement 
for EC-member migrants, 7) no social benefits to 
migrant children, 8) priority for French citizens in 
housing and social benefits, and 9) immediate deporta-
tion for migrants with improper or no official docu-
ments, (Walsh, 1992, p. 21). Clearly such blatant state 
nationalism will not be adopted in policy terms by any 
responsible French Government, but more subtle vari-
ants of these elements have entered the agenda of 
respectable political parties and interest groups and 
will be set in sharper focus as the key policy alterna-
tives each time urban racial violence occurs. 
The former German Federal Republic was a logical 
destination for many displaced Europeans and others 
because of its historically sympathetic reception of 
refugees that is enshrined in Article 16 of the German 
Basic Law. It is estimated that some 400,000 asylum 
seekers were processed into Germany in 1992. Walsh 
suggests that 80 percent came from the Third World 
and that the vast majority were Muslim; he argues that 
an additional 4 million Turks and their families and a 
further 310,000 de facto refugees should be taken into 
account as constituting the non-German sector of the 
population. 
Since unification and its attendant economic and fiscal 
difficulties, this liberal attitude has been openly chal-
lenged. Anti-immigrant violence has made many Ger-
man citizens wary of an extension of their open-door 
policy, especially when the media are quick to point 
out that 93 percent of asylum seekers do not have a 
valid case. Thus, one inescapable conclusion is that 
many places within Germany are going to witness 
sporadic and deep-seated violence. When this general 
trend is applied to the borders with Poland, the Czech 
Republic, and Austria, it is evident that one major 
cause of future conflict will be the manner in which 
cross-border movement is handled. 
51 
The German state's response is to attempt to quench 
the migration flow at the source through a massive 
investment in the emergent capitalist economies of the 
east and increased immigration control at external EU 
borders. To some extent this will be welcomed by 
dependent economies that will replace the ruble with 
the mark, but it is also likely to create deep-seated 
resentment and accusations of internal colonialism, 
reminiscent of the first waves of German expansion in 
previous centuries. Such border controls will facilitate 
the removal of internal EU border checks but only to 
the extent that each constituent country is as efficient 
and determined as Germany, France, and the United 
Kingdom in employing external controls, a doubtful 
assumption. 
The most recent migrants are incorrectly viewed as 
economically dependent and relatively unskilled�a 
drain on EU resources. Miles (1992, p.41) is especially 
sensitive to this assumption. He argues that "this 
homogenization of migration flows is factually mis-
taken and analytically problematic" and that "...large 
numbers of recent migrants originate from Eastern 
Europe, the migration of aussiedler into Germany 
being of special significance; that the most important 
category of internal labor migration within the EU is 
that of skilled professional and managerial labour; and 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
that one of the fastest growing categories on non-EU 
migration into the European Union includes similarly 
highly skilled nonmanual labor from other sectors of 
the advanced capitalist world economy. In light of the 
new immigration, the stereotyping of immigrants as 
blacks originating from the Third World ironically mir-
rors and legitimates the discourse of EU states about 
the problem of immigration." This is an important 
qualification and should alert us to read between the 
lines of official pronouncement and localized reaction. 
The Implications of Globalization, Technology, and 
Accessibility for Ethnic Relations 
If we shift attention from the conventional territorial 
and urban contexts for social interaction, it is evident 
that a major source of ethnic-racial conflict will be the 
differential access groups enjoy to information, space, 
and power in Europe. The whole history of the West 
has been a constant, if traumatic, dialogue between 
periods of opening and closing, between diversifica-
tion and uniformity. The technological trends under-
pinning closer European integration suggest four 
trends as they relate to the interaction of language, 
ethnicity, identity, and the state system: 
� First, we have already witnessed the emergence of 
English as the lingua franca of Europe, if not of the 
world. This has caused other international languages 
such as French, German, and Spanish to jockey for 
position in a secondary role within the educational, 
legal, and commercial domains of a restructured and 
enlarged Europe. Fears are already expressed about 
the dominance of English and of the infiltration 
thereby of non-European, for instance, North Amer-
ican influence. Thus serious consideration is being 
given to the following proposals: a) there should be 
two foreign languages for every EU citizen, b) a first 
foreign language should be obligatory, c) English 
should be taught as a second foreign language, never 
as the first, and d) less information and cultural loss 
will occur if the principle of multilingualism in most 
affairs can be instituted. 
� Second, indigenous language groups, such as Welsh, 
Irish, or Basque (see inset on p.53) will be further 
marginalized unless they can influence the patterns 
of stable bilingualism with a much reduced language 
switching than has hitherto been the norm. Evidence 
of partial success is available in domains such as 
education, public administration, and the law. The 
key instrument is the degree of influence exercised 
on the local state apparatus to institutionalize pat-
terns of language behavior and service provision in 
new domains. One of the great ironies of many 
lesser used language groups is that they are simulta-
neously witnessing the erosion of their traditional 
strength in heartland areas and key cities while 
beginning to harness the potential of mass commu-
nication and electronic networking. 
� Third, and most intriguing from a geographer's 
viewpoint, pressure will increase on local and met-
ropolitan authorities to provide mother-tongue edu-
cation and other public services to the children of 
mobile workers and their families in multicultural 
cities such as Milan, London, Paris, and Frankfurt. 
This is set to become the major policy issue within 
public administration if a fully functional European 
Union is to be realized. 
� Fourth, and most strategical, demand will grow at 
the Community level to provide resources for the 
instruction, absorption, and occupational integration 
of the children and dependents of non-EU migrant 
workers. An inability or a refusal to provide such 
public facilities, especially in education, health ser-
vices, and community care, will undoubtedly 
increase the scale of ethnic tension and call into 
question the nature and direction of the multicultural 
character of the European Union itself. 
A more virulent expression of such tension will be the 
continued importation of non-European conflicts into 
the multicultural cities of the Community. One chief 
characteristic of globalization is that the safety valve 
of relative insulation from other countries' problems 
and issues no longer operates in a "nationally 
bounded" manner. In consequence, the "higher the 
level of globalization, the narrower the scope for 
escape alternatives. In this sense, globalization is also 
a kind of totalitarianization of world space" (Mlinar, 
1992. p. 20; Williams, 1993, p. 2).

Conclusion 
Ethnic mobilization is so often a surrogate for other 
issues such as political struggle, economic depriva-
tion, and psychological adjustment to the status quo. 
Ethnic issues, whether as purposive or reactive ele-
ments, are likely to increase in their salience as West-
ern Europe avers a more open, pluralistic society. 
Geographers can play an important role in analyzing 
the conventional elements of migration, distribution, 
and territorial organization of Society. However, the 
major challenge facing us is in interpreting the trends 
that emerge as a result of the disjuncture between the 
formally structured political units�at whatever scale 
from local to superstructural�and the actual social 
behavior of an increasingly autonomous and individu-
alistic citizenry. Coping with this new complex reality 
by learning to read between the lines will be the chief 
social skill required of both active citizen and special-
ist observer alike. Let me end by raising a few critical 
questions that geographers and others will need to 
address if Europe is to honor the basic rights of all its 
constituent citizens: 
� On what basis will the new European identity be 
constructed�federal, regional, racial, or national? 
� What effect will the enlargement of the European 
Union have on the internal ethnolinguistic and 
regional management of the Community? 
� To what extent will border tensions spill into Com-
munity states, and how will these effect the grand 
design of opening up the frontiers of Europe? 
� How permeable are the new frontiers of the Euro-
pean Community? 
� Will ethnicity, as a base for social mobilization, 
increase or decrease with greater political-economic 
integration? 
� How will political organizations, especially metro-
politan authorities, cope with the increased diversity 
of their constituent citizens and the newly enfran-
chised rights of cultural pluralism? 
� What role will territory and place have in structuring 
the life chances of hitherto discriminated minorities? 
� Will we have a nested hierarchy of disadvantage 
aggravated by global economic changes inducing 
the expansion of domination and dependence of the 
poor and the racially distinct? 
53 
� Who controls access to information within the 
mother tongue and the working languages of the 
European minorities?

� Are minorities destined to a more dependant role, 
even within their own countries, because of super-
structural changes favoring the dominant groups? 
� Or will they achieve some relative sociocultural 
autonomy through the adoption of mass technology 
and internal communicative competence? 
� What effect will globalization have on strengthening 
or weakening the regional-local infrastructure on 
which European ethnic minority groups depend? 
� What role will intractable ethnic conflicts play in 
triggering major regional clashes, and how will the 
new security architecture of Europe react to such 
conflagrations?

Summary of Discussion 
Discussant: Alexander Murphy 
I would like to highlight a few things that I think are 
particularly significant and to raise a couple of related 
questions. At the heart of Professor Williams' presen-
tation is a dichotomy between two fundamentally dif-
ferent kinds of ethnic issues that Western Europe will 
face in the years ahead. One concerns the longstand-
ing, regionally specific minority groups, and the other 
concerns the migrants who have come in from North 
Africa and the Middle East over the last 30 or 40 years 
and more recently from Eastern Europe. It is impor-
tant to recognize that each of these poses a fundamen-
tally different problem for Europe in the 1990s. Most 
obviously, their geography differs. Longstanding 
minority groups often operate from a distinct regional 
territorial base. The migrant groups, on the other hand, 
are concentrated overwhelmingly in cities and do not 
have the same kind of territorial base. The geography 
of social disruption associated with each group also 
differs. With longstanding minority and regional 
minority groups, the issues, tensions, and conflicts, in 
general, tend to be localized, whereas migrant group 
issues tend to be focused for political mobilization at 
the national level and are often far reaching in their 
impact on society. These differences are evident in the 
public reactions to them. I agree with Dr. Williams 
that we are seeing a greater acceptance of the long-
standing minority groups and that the focus of opposi-
tion politics around the recent migrants is one of the 
fundamental issues for Europe in the years ahead. 
Having identified those twin issues, I will move on to 
note what I see as the two key geographical perspec-
tives that Dr. Williams highlighted: 
� First, ethnic conflicts play out at different scales, and 
these scale differences have implications for our 
understanding. Dr. Williams highlighted the impor-
tance of scale in his discussion of Northern Ireland. 
� Second, of course, is the importance of territorial 
setting for ethnic conflict. Some of the comments 
about the changing significance of regions were par-
ticularly interesting in this regard. 
A focus on the territorial setting for ethnic conflict can 
highlight some issues that Dr. Williams did not touch 
on but that are relevant for our thinking about what is 
happening in Europe. First, differences in how States 
define citizenship is critically important. One need 
only think about the different ways in which the Ger-
mans, French, or British have defined citizenship his-
torically. Second, several different migrant groups 
exist: older new migrants, newer new migrants, and 
newer newer new migrants. The most recent come 
from Eastern Europe and look different from earlier 
migrants not only in terms of external characteristics 
but also in terms of the kinds of skills they bring and 
their potential level of acceptance within West Euro-
pean societies. 
One of the critical contemporary issues is the effect 
that the new immigrants are having on the old immi-
grants. The relatively highly skilled immigrants com-
ing in from Poland and the former western republics 
of the former Soviet Union are likely to be more easily 
integrated within the cultural traditions of the West. If 
this occurs, Turks and other non-Western migrants 
will be further marginalized. 
Finally, Dr. Williams raises two critical questions. The 
first is that the changing political geography of Europe 
is affecting ethnicity and ethnic conflict. In my own 
view, centralization as a component of European inte-
gration has currently gone about as far as it can go. A 
key current issue is the importance of regions and 
regionalization. An example of this is a map produced 
by the Commission of the European Communities that 
illustrates European integration from a geographical 
perspective. It identifies development zones within 
Europe. These development zones do not conform to 
those defined by the European Regional Development 
Fund; they are not based on political-administrative 
regions within existing nation-states. Rather, the map 
looks at Europe without nation-state boundaries, play-
ing off of some of the transboundary developments 
currently underway that are beginning to define a new 
kind of European political space.

The second question is: how do we evaluate the poli-
cies of individual states in relation to minority groups, 
in particular, territorial policies? There was an 
extended discussion in the paper of the Basque situa-
tion, where power has been devolved to regions of a 
quasiautonomous nature. Despite this devolution, a 
continuation of fairly strong anti-Madrid bias can still 
be seen in voting patterns in Spain. At the same time, 
overt violence has been reduced. This raises questions 
about the impact of state policies that acknowledge 
the existence of ethnic concentrations and use territo-
rial policies to incorporate ethnic groups in the deci-
sionmalcing process. It may mean�as has happened 
to a degree in the Basque case�that bringing a sepa-
ratist group into the decisionmalcing structure may 
marginalize the more violent elements of the group. 
General Discussion 
QUESTION: With regard to ethnic issues, what poli-
cies are likely to best promote US interests in the 
region? 
DR. MURPHY: The United States has an interest in a 
stable and economically vital Europe. This would sug-
gest that it is in the US interest to promote the kind of 
policy options that lead to stability from an ethnic 
standpoint. That may mean some of the kinds of terri-
torial policies that I suggested. It also means that the 
United States should promote the idea of a European 
Community that does not just look like a much more 
centralized community but one that actually facilitates 
the kinds of regional linkages that Dr. Williams has 
outlined. We should be not be scared of the fact that 
the nation-state is changing. It is in the US interest to 
promote the kind of regional arrangements that will 
lead to a more stable and outward-looking Europe.

Ethnoterritorial Conflict in the 
Former Soviet Union 
Robert Kaiser 
Professor of Geography 
University of Missouri-Columbia 
Introduction 
The former USSR has been the scene of scores of 
active and potential ethnoterritorial conflicts. More 
than 200 ethnic and territorial disputes have been 
identified in this region since 1989, encompassing 
nearly all the territory of the former USSR (see 
figure 6). However, not all the disputes have erupted 
into violent conflict. In Latvia and Estonia, ethnic con-
flict has taken the form of "constitutional nationalism" 
or "ethnic democracy," as Latvian and Estonian politi-
cal elites restructure ethnic relations through the use 
of legislation to exclude nonmembers.' In Transcauca-
sia, ethnoterritorial conflicts between titular nations 
and indigenous minorities began before 1991 and 
quickly escalated to open warfare. In Central Asia, 
sporadic outbreaks of ethnic violence against nontitu-
lar populations have occurred but have not been orga-
nized by indigenous political elites pursuing the 
politics of territorial nationalism. In the Russian Fed-
eration, disputes over the level of territorial autonomy 
for non-Russians have risen, but, aside from a few 
specific republics, a process of political disintegration 
comparable to that which occurred in the USSR does 
not appear to be on the horizon. 
Rather than provide a descriptive summary of all 200 
plus ethnoterritorial conflicts, this paper explores the 
factors underyling the regional variation in the ethnot-
erritorial conflicts that have arisen in the former 
'The term constitutional nationalism ; its use by the political elites 
of the dominant nation, the consequences of the new political real-
ity for nonmembers, and reactions leading to violent ethnoterrito-
rial conflict was recently elaborated by Robert Hayden (1992) with 
reference to Yugoslavia. According to Hayden, "constitutional 
nationalism envisions a state in which sovereignty resides with a 
particular nation, the members of which are the only ones who can 
decide fundamental questions of state form and identity." Ethnic 
democracy has been defined by Smooha and Hanf (1992, 31) as "a 
democracy in which the dominance of one ethnic group is institu-
tionalized." 
Soviet Union.2 The factors and consequences briefly 
discussed are generalizations drawn from comparative 
research on nationalism and territoriality and from the 
disputes that have emerged in the former USSR. They 
are by no means the only important factors, and, to 
fully understand why some ethnoterritorial disputes 
escalated to violent conflict and others did not, it is 
necessary to explore each dispute in detail and to 
examine it from each side's perspective. Nonetheless, 
it is also essential to understand the geographic vari-
ability in ethnoterritorial conflict in the former USSR 
more generally and to place the events in this critical 
world region in the context of a broader conceptual 
framework. 
Ethnoterritorial Conflicts: Factors Underlying 
Regional Differences 
The Degree of National Consciousness 
The formation of a national identity is one of the most 
important, but also one of the most difficult, factors to 
grasp. Nationalists throughout this region tend to 
depict their nations as "primordial organisms" that 
were dormant during the oppressive Soviet period and 
were reawakened during the Gorbachev era (for 
example, RUKH 1989). However, it is more accurate 
to view the Soviet period as crucial to the national for-
mation process, during which time nations became 
mass-based communities of interest and belonging 
that developed a sense of identity and a sense of 
homeland more extensive than their local environment 
(Kaiser 1994). However, even though this nationaliza-
tion process during the Soviet era resulted in a higher 
and more mass-based national consciousness than 
existed before, not all groups are equally national. 
Because national consciousness is essentially subjec-
tive, it is difficult to measure the degree to which it has 
become mass-based. Soviet censuses did ask a ques-
tion on national identity, and this data provided one 
indicator of groups that were losing members as a

result of ethnonational reidentification or assimilation 
over time (Silver 1986). According to this measure, 
the least nationally conscious communities are the 
small groups of people of the Siberian north and also a 
number of Finnic groups such as the Karelians and 
Mordvinians, whose members were undergoing a pro-
cess of reidentification toward Russians during much 
of the Soviet period. It is also true that members who 
live outside their home republics are more likely to 
acculturate and assimilate through an intergenera-
tional process of reidentification (Kaiser 1988, 1994). 
Although ethnic reidentification is a useful general 
indicator of national consciousness, this measure does 
have limits because it does not indicate the strength of 
national consciousness amohg the population that 
considered itself to be part of the nation (that is, those 
who did not reidentify). 
Another way of assessing national consciousness is to 
study the behavior of individuals and to determine to 
what degree each member of the nation behaves in a 
way that is consonant with nationalism. Nationalism 
here is defined as both an ideology and a political 
strategy. In Nationalism and the State (1982, 3), John 
Breuilly states that the political doctrine of national-
ism has three essential tenets: 
� "There exists a nation with an explicit and peculiar 
character." 
� "'The interests and values of the nation take priority 
over all other interests and values." 
� "The nation must be as independent as possible. 
This usually requires at least the attainment of polit-
ical sovereignty." 
National consciousness as discussed above is 
addressed in Breuilly's first tenet. Beyond this, the pri-
macy of national identity and the political objective 
that this inspires (that is, the attainment of indepen-
dence) are of crucial importance in understanding 
nationalism as a political and geographic action pro-
gram. Applying this to the former USSR, it is rela-
tively obvious at this point that ethnoregional 
differences exist in the degree to which nationalism 
has become an activated strategy. The Baltic nations 
have clearly been most nationalistic; close to the 
entire membership turned out for independence ral-
lies�indicating a high degree of national conscious-
ness�and they were least willing to compromise on 
the question of political independence. The least 
nationalistic of the titular groups in the former Union 
republics are in Central Asia. For example, Tajikistan 
has erupted into civil war; the conflict is, at least in 
part, intranational and interethnic, indicating a low 
level of national consciousness and the continued pri-
macy of subnational, localized ethnic identities. The 
degree of national solidarity is lowest in Central Asia, 
and the nationalized elites have had the most difficulty 
calling their groups to action. 
As a final point regarding this factor, it is important to 
note that there is a lack of correspondence between the 
degree of national consciousness and the level of 
interethnic violence. For example, the Tajik civil war 
has resulted in much greater loss of life and disloca-
tion than has the constitutional nationalism pursued by 
Estonians and Latvians. 
Strength of Attachment to Place of Residence 
A sense of homeland rises with national conscious-
ness (Kaiser 1991, 1994). As an ethnonational com-
munity becomes more nationalistic, this sense of 
homeland becomes politicized and is converted into 
territorial nationalism.' Nationalism is an explicitly 
geographic ideology and strategy, a political action 
program to make the borders of state and homeland 
congruent (Williams 1989; Gettner 1983). 
Nationality policies in the USSR facilitated the devel-
opment of a politicized sense of homeland. First, the 
federal structure helped give definite shape, size, and 
borders to homelands that for the masses of most 
groups were only vaguely perceived in the 1920s (see 
figure 7). 
61 
3 From a nationalist perspective, the ancestral homeland is the only 
place where the nation can survive and prosper in the future. If 
nationalists view the nation as a primordial organism, they also 
typically view it as an organism that can thrive only when rooted in 
the soil of the ancestral homeland.

Second, Korenizatsiya (indigenization) policies that 
targeted members of the titular nation for preferential 
treatment in their home republic clearly fostered a 
more ethnically exclusionary outlook regarding the 
appropriate status of the titular nation vis a vis all 
other nations in the republic. Most nationalists have 
come to view all their former republic as homeland, 
even while many nationalists lay claim to a more 
extensive homeland. 
On the one hand, the federal structure reduced the eth-
noterritorial conflict that might otherwise have 
occurred�it provided the political geographic struc-
ture for a relatively peaceful dissolution of the USSR. 
On the other hand, several of those national communi-
ties with units that were only autonomous have 
attempted to secede from the successor states in which 
their homelands are located. This has resulted in con-
flict escalation at the intrarepublic scale, which has 
been particularly severe in the Caucasus. 
Territorial nationalism is strongest in the regions 
where nations are most fully formed. Again, Estonia 
and Latvia�with their exclusionary citizenship laws, 
constitutions, and so forth �may be seen as most 
nationalistic. The state-building project in these two 
republics is synonymous with the exclusion of ethnic 
others, particularly Russians, even though their poli-
cies have excluded the population arriving since 
World War II rather than all nontitular people. 
Ethnic conflict is more likely where two or more 
nations feel a strong sense of homeland toward the 
same place, where both groups have become politi-
cized, and where the power relationship between the 
two groups has shifted to favor one over the other. 
This is certainly true in the case of conflicts over 
Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan and Abkhazia and 
South Ossetia in Georgia. 
A final note under this factor: it has become increas-
ingly apparent over the past few years that a Russian 
sense of national consciousness and sense of home-
land are not well developed. Russians as the dominant 
group in the USSR experienced an overlapping sense 
of identity with the Soviet People idea, and with the 
entire USSR as the Russian homeland/Socialist father-
land. Also, because of the great geographic dispersal 
of the Russian population, a more localized, subna-
tional identity is also apparent. Both of these detract 
from the strength of a Russian national identity and a 
sense of homeland. As a result, there has been a lively 
debate within the Russian community over the ques-
tion: "What is Russia?". 
Ethnodemographic Trends 
Most nationalists view the ideal polity as an ethnically 
pure nation-state with all members of the nation in and 
no outsiders present and with political borders drawn 
on the basis of the (mythical) ancestral homeland, that 
is, the state ideally is viewed as the political geo-
graphic embodiment of the nation. However, none of 
the successor states encompasses one and only one 
nation (see tables 1 and 2): 
� Armenia is ethnically homogeneous but has the 
highest percentage of members living outside a suc-
cessor state. 
� Almost all Estonians, Latvians, and Georgians are 
included in their respective states, but members of 
nontitular groups are also present. 
Demographic dilution of the indigenous nation in its 
homeland, usually occurring as the result of the in-
migration of Russians, tended to exacerbate intereth-
nic relations and was a catalyst for rising nationalism. 
Latvians and Estonians experienced the greatest 
demographic dilution in their homelands between 
1960 and 1990, and the feared demographic Russifica-
don became the cornerstone of their nationalistic pro-
grams (Panning, 1980). Ablchazians similarly cited 
Georgian in-migration and Abkhazian dilution as a 
critical factor in the need for Abkhazia to be indepen-
dent, and the Armenian declaration of independence 
in Nagorno-Karabakh was preceded by a decade of 
Azeri in-migration. 
63 
By way of contrast, Kyrgyzstan has about the same 
level of demographic dilution as Latvia, but this has 
not been a major issue in Kyrgyzstan. In the Central

Note: Indigenous minorities include those ethnonational communi-
ties with autonomous territories in the Union republics of the 
former USSR. In addition, in Moldova the Gagauz are included, 
and in Ukraine the Crimean Tatars are included. The category 
"Neighbors" includes the members of the titular nations of the 
Union republics whose borders are adjacent to the republic in 
question. 
Asian republics, demographic indigenization rather 
than greater demographic Russ ification has been the 
trend for most of the postwar period. 
Social Mobility and Relative Deprivation 
Ethnoterritorial conflict tends to be more violent in 
places where indigenous access to upward mobility is 
blocked by socially mobilized outsiders, creating a 
condition of "aspirational deprivation" (that is, where 
a group's rising aspirations go unfulfilled) (Gurr 
1970). This is particularly apparent in Central Asia, 
where dramatic increases in the levels of indigenous 
educational attainment during the 1970s and 1980s 
resulted in equally dramatic increases in aspirations. 
These aspirations were not met due to economic stag-
nation and more recently economic depression in the 
region, resulting in rising unemployment, especially 
among the young educated members of the indigenous

niia 1989 Goda, Volume 7, parts 1 and 2. Minneapolis: East 
View Publications, 1993. 
groups. Under these conditions, in-migrating "for-
eigners" tend to be blamed. Because Russians and 
other European groups occupy the higher status posi-
tions in Central Asia's urban/industrial sectors, this 
tendency is not unjustified. These socioeconomic con-
ditions provided the catalyst for sporadic antiforeigner 
violence in Central Asia, often conducted by unem-
ployed educated indigenous youths against a vulnera-
ble population that was depicted as receiving 
preferential access to scarce economic goods such as 
housing, jobs, and food (for example, Meskhetian 
Turks in Uzbekistan, Armenians in Dushanke).4 
4 Byron Weiner (1978) found these same conditions underlying the 
rise of indigenous nativism among India's so-called sons of the 
soil. Nativism is defined by Weiner as "intense opposition to 
minorities because of their foreign origin."

In Georgia a slightly different interethnic dynamic 
regarding social mobility and relative deprivation 
developed. The Georgians in Abkhazia, who view this 
territory as part of their homeland, were angered by 
the preferential treatment accorded Abkhazians as part 
of the indigenization program. Abkhazians were only 
17 percent of the population but, as the titular group in 
Abkhazia, had a much higher percent of slots in 
higher education, high status jobs, and political repre-
sentation reserved for them. In Nagorno-Karabakh the 
demographic shift toward Azeris was coupled with 
Azeri challenges to Armenian privileges in the region. 
In both cases the Georgian and Azeri attempts to 
remove or reduce Abkhazian and Armenian privileges 
resulted in civil warfare, as Abkhazians and Arme-
nians in Nagorna-Karabakh sought to secede. 
It is also true, however, that the most socially mobi-
lized titular nations, that is, the Estonians, Latvians, 
Georgians, and Armenians-are also among the most 
nationalistic. The Soviet case provides convincing 
evidence that socioeconomic development or modern-
ization, and even the provision of indigenous privi-
leges, did not solve the national problem. 
Nearly all non-Russians have used the rhetoric of 
internal colonialism. The least developed, such as the 
Tajiks, charge that the USSR did not live up to its 
promise of interethnic and interregional equalization. 
The most developed, such as the Estonians, charge 
that they would be even more developed if they had 
their independence. This feeling of relative depriva-
tion was a potent catalyst for rising territorial national-
ism that ironically was perhaps most influential in the 
most developed republics because the message of 
external exploitation and domination interacted with 
the trend toward demographic dilution among nations 
with a highly developed national consciousness and a 
sense of homeland.

Reaction by Members of Nontitular Groups to 
Rising Territorial Nationalism 
Acceptance and Accommodation 
A certain segment of the nontitular population that 
was ethnically marginal was undergoing process of 
acculturation and assimilation either with the titular 
nation or with the local Russian population. For the 
most part, these were nontitular people who had lived 
outside their homelands for several generations and 
whose ancestors had moved from their homeland 
before nationalization processes had begun (Kaiser 
1994). Of this acculturating/assimilating segment of 
the nontitular population, those who are becoming 
acculturated to the indigenous nation will accept, and 
even promote, the new ethnic reality if they are 
accepted by the titular nation. On the other hand, those 
undergoing a process of Russification may respond as 
the local Russian population does. Conversely, the 
process of Russification itself may be reversed. For 
example, children with Russian and Ukrainian parents 
who claimed to be Russians in the past may prefer to 
identify themselves as Ukrainians, particularly in 
states where titular nationalism is directed against the 
local Russians (for instance, in Latvia and Estonia). 
Beyond this ethnically marginal population, there is 
also a segment of the nontitular population that has 
lived in the same republic and locality for generations 
and has developed a strong sense of homeland (see 
table 3). Several indicators of acceptance have 
become apparent, particularly for the Russians living 
in the non-Russian successor states. For example, a 
relatively high percentage of Russians favored the 
independence of the republics they lived in and voted 
for independence-oriented parties, and a relatively 
high percentage of Russians also identified Estonia as 
their homeland (Drobizheva 1991). Surveys of Rus-
sian intereflmic attitudes tended to show a willingness 
to remain in the newly independent states, at least 
immediately after independence. It may appear 
counter-intuitive, but the Russian reaction to the new 
ethno-political realities in the successor states appears 
more accommodative than resistant thus far; this may 
reflect the limited degree of Russian national con-
sciousness and nationalism. The republics where Rus-
sians comprised the highest proportion of nontitular 
population are those without violent ethnic conflict.

However, acceptance and accommodation are also 
dependent on the behavior of the titular nationalists. In 
the case of Estonia, nationalists seeking to reduce the 
Russian presence have alienated Russians who had 
behaved as Estonian patriots. A similar situation 
occurred in Latvia. Under these conditions, Russians 
are unlikely to remain accommodative of titular 
nationalism. Russian opposition is on the rise in the 
Baltic states, as well as in Kazakstan-two regions 
where Russian acceptance and accommodations were 
dominant through 1992.

Emigration 
Nontitular outmigration occurs in regions of violent 
ethnic conflict such as the Transcaucasus and Central 
Asia, and among nontitular populations without a 
strong sense of homeland. The first wave of nontitular 
emigration was primarily of those nonindigenes who 
had recently immigrated to the region. In the past two 
years, an increasing number of those nontitular mem-
bers with deeper roots in the regions are leaving, par-
ticularly in areas of interethnic violence. This latter 
migration is referred to as refugee migration, and it 
had exceeded 3 million by early fall 1993. I will limit 
my remarks here because Dr. Schwartz will be provid-
ing the details of this aspect of ethnic conflict in the 
former USSR later. 
Resistance 
Separatism. This reaction is more likely in areas of 
nontitular concentration where the local population 
has developed a strong sense of homeland that is 
directly threatened by the territorial nationalism of the 
titular nation. The nontitular group or indigenous 
minority seeks to gain greater territorial autonomy as 
a way to minimize the impact of titular nation's 
nationalism. This nontitular reaction in turn has typi-
cally provoked a stronger counteraction on the part of 
the titular nation, leading to conflict escalation. Of 
course, early examples of this occurred in Transcauca-
sia (Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia, and Abkha-
zia), and in Moldova (Trans-Dinestria and among the 
Gagauz). 
Most autonomous units of the Soviet federation 
declared their sovereignty immediately following the 
declarations of sovereignty by the Union republics in 
1990. But not all are equally separatist. Ethnic and 
regional variations again depend on the degree of 
national consciousness on the part of the indigenous 
minority, the history of majority-minority relations in 
the region, and the degree to which the territorial 
nationalism of the majority group is perceived as a 
threat to the future viability of the indigenous minor-
ity: 
� Sovereignty declarations resulting in conflict escala-
tion include: Nagorno-Karabakh, South Ossetia and 
Abkhazia, the Trans-Dniestrian Republic, and the 
Gagauz Republic in Moldova. 
� Russia narrowly averted conflict over Chechnya's 
declaration of independence in 1991; the North Cau-
casus is the most likely region in Russia to become 
the scene of conflict escalation in the future.5 
� The Tatars, Bashkirs, Yakuts, Tuvins, and Buryats�
more highly nationalized communities in Russia--
have pressed for greater independence in a more 
confederal Russia. If they are unhappy with the new 
constitution being worked out, the potential exists 
for rising national separatism.6 Of course, this will, 
and indeed already has, provoked rising Russian ter-
ritorial nationalism in the republic. 
� Russians in Narva and Sillamae declared territorial 
autonomy but backed down when the Estonian 
Supreme Court declared these referendums illegal. 
� Russians in Crimea have declared their autonomy 
and their intent to secede from Ukraine. This has 
been the site of rising interethnic tensions among 
Russians, Ukrainians, and Crimean Tatars returning 
from exile in Central Asia. 
� Russian nationalist parties in northern Kazakstan 
have also proclaimed their goal of secession from 
Kazakstan and merger with Russia, but thus far this 
objective is not shared by a majority of Russians in 
the region. This is in part because Kazakh territorial 
nationalism has been muted in the republic by mod-
erate Kazakh political elites at least through 1992. It 
may also be true that the demographic status of two 
relatively equal communities has tended to dampen 
titular nationalism. 
Political Opposition. Nontitular groups have also 
attempted to organize opposition political parties and/ 
or movements. For example, the Russian "interna-
tional fronts" in the Baltic republics developed in 
opposition to the rise of titular "national front" move-
ments. Nontitular groups and indigenous minorities 
have also boycotted referendums and elections. This 
5 Conflict finally did erupt in December 1994. 
6 The new Russian Constitution did represent a loss of autonomy 
for the non-Russian indigenous minorities.

type of resistance has typically not provoked the same 
level of titular reaction that territorial autonomy/inde-
pendence movements have. 
Conclusion 
There are several important lessons that have been 
learned in the emergent territorial nationalism found 
in the former Soviet Union. 
Conflict escalation to violent confrontation is an inter-
active process. It has normally started with territorial 
nationalism of the titular nation, whose members 
attempt to establish their hegemony in their home-
land.7 This in turn means that the rights and privileges 
of nontitular peoples living in the emergent nationalis-
tic state are seriously eroded or restricted, resulting in 
a reactive nationalism on the part of such nontitular 
nations. Indigenous minorities have tended to react by 
declaring their sovereignty over the geographic area 
perceived as their homeland, and this has frequently 
led to a strong reaction on the part of such titular 
nation. This pattern of conflict escalation revolving 
around territorial control is found in the Armenian-
Azeri dispute, in Georgia, in the North Caucasus, in 
Ukraine (especially Crimea), and in Moldova. 
In areas where the nontitular groups have not devel-
oped a strong sense of homeland with their local 
places of residence, resistance in the form of political 
opposition�as in the case of the Russians in the Bal-
tic republics. Alternatively, emigration or even accep-
tance if the nontitular group has come to identify with 
the titular nation and its homeland are also reactions 
7 See Hennayake (1992), who recently elaborated a theory of 
"interactive ethnonationalism." 
found among certain segments of the nontitular popu-
lation. Conflict escalation to violent confrontation is 
not inevitable. Nontitular emigration is found among 
nonindigenous groups in Transcaucasia and Central 
Asia. Acceptance is found most often among nontitu-
lar groups that are ethnically similar to the titular 
nation and whose members have lived outside their 
ancentral homeland for generations. 
As a final comment, several analysts of ethnoterrito-
rial conflict in the former USSR have argued that it 
was the federal structure, based as it was on ethnic 
homelands, that was the cause of the disintegration in 
the USSR and the cause of interethnic conflict today. 
They also state that the successor states are ethnically 
mixed and that ethnonational identity and territorial 
identity must be separated to avoid the kind of ethnot-
erritorial cleansing that has occurred in Yugoslavia 
and in Transcaucasia. As laudable as this sentiment 
may be, it does not accord with the reality of territorial 
nationalism in the region. National identity and terri-
torial identity have been intimately interrelated, and a 
rising sense of national consciousness has coincided 
with a rising sense of exclusiveness toward the region 
identified as the national homeland. Attempts to 
decouple this geographic relationship between nation 
and homeland will fail and are likely to cause height-
ened interethnic tensions and conflicts in the region. A 
more informed approach to the problem of territorial 
nationalism should begin with an acknowledgement 
of the importance of homeland in the perceptions of 
nationalists and attempt to regulate interethnic ten-
sions and conflicts that are likely to emerge as a con-
sequence of these perceptions before these conflicts 
escalate to violent confrontation.

Summary of Discussion 
Discussant: Ronald Wixman 
I would like to discuss the region from a slightly dif-
ferent perspective. I think it is a grave error to view 
the former Soviet Union as a unitary state. It never 
was. It might be useful, instead, to view the Soviet 
Union as a colonial empire that is now, as other colo-
nial empires have, going through the various stages of 
decolonization. The former Soviet Union is the Rus-
sian empire, and the Russian empire is falling apart. 
The situation is not unique, as evidenced by the situa-
tion of the Germans in Eastern Europe after World 
War I. After Germany lost its holdings and the Austro-
Hungarian Empire fell apart, Germans were left in 
such places as Moravia, Slilesia, and the Banat. In 
fact, in the Banat, there were more Germans than 
Romanians or Serbs. In many areas, they were in the 
majority. But just as the Russians did in the outlying 
republics, the Germans went from having majority 
status to minority status. 
The process of nativization of the republics has gone 
through phases. The initial stage was not to produce a 
Ukrainian Ukraine or an Uzbek Uzbekistan or an 
Estonian Estonia. Instead, the Russians co-opted the 
elites in the same way that the British co-opted the 
Rajas of India. The next generation is ambivalent, and 
after that a shift occurs in which many of these elites 
produced by the state, and for the state, turn on it. The 
Soviet Union went through this process of decoloniza-
don, when the native elite turned away from serving 
Moscow and decided to serve their own peoples' 
interests. This is what happened throughout Eastern 
Europe after World War I, when the co-opted elite 
turned against Austria, Hungary, and the Ottomans. 
What does all this mean? We are seeing the newly cre-
ated republics in borders that did not exist before. The 
borders of the Soviet republics were constructed spe-
cifically by the central government. Uzbekistan did 
not create its borders, Armenia did not create its, and 
you can be sure neither the Abkhaz nor the Georgians 
created Abkhazia. These were created in Moscow, by 
Moscow, and for Moscow. The policy toward Azer-
baijanis and the Azeri language was not created in 
Azerbaijan. It also came from Moscow. So, to speak 
of a federal structure is difficult. In the decolonization 
policy, the people of the former republics are saying, 
"our people, our language, and our culture are not 
dominant." As in all other colonial areas, what hap-
pens to those people who are not members of this 
majority? Should the leftover colonials learn the 
national language? Should the French in Algeria have 
learned Arabic? They did not have to become Muslim, 
but should they have sworn allegiance to Algeria 
rather than to France? Who comes to the United States 
and keeps their allegiance to their old country and 
cannot speak English? 
The Russians are dealing with the issues of what they 
can and cannot keep and of what belongs and does not 
belong to the state. For example, Moscow claims the 
Black Sea Fleet because the government built it. 
Ukrainians say the fleet does not belong to Moscow 
because they believe they built it as much as the gov-
ernment did. When Russians say that the Crimea is 
Russian, Ukrainians say, "only because Moscow 
never let Ukrainians move there." 
The West needs to see the former Soviet republics not 
only in the context of people finding a new national-
ism but also in that of the people directing anger 
against the colonial state for having forbidden them 
their rights in their own territory. 
Similarly, the minorities in these republics have found 
themselves in the same position that minorities have 
found themselves in all other newly independent 
former colonial states. The West has been viewing 
East Europeans and the former Soviet peoples in a dif-
ferent light than it has viewed everyone else in the 
world, and I think we should recognize this and 
change the view. The former Soviet Union and Yugo-
slavia have been suffering from a majority problem 
for many years, not so much a minority problem.

General Discussion 
QUESTION: Dr. Wixman, if we accept your analogy 
that the disintegration of the Soviet Union can be 
compared with the disintegrations of previous 
empires, can we also look at the Russian federation 
now as an empire? Is there a possibility of the Russian 
federation also disintegrating like the Soviet Union? 
DR. WIXIVIAN: For the most part, no. There are very 
few regions of the Russian federation within which 
the Russians are not the vast majority. Siberia and the 
Far East is now�whatever it was before�extremely 
Russian in makeup. 
The Russian Federation is basically Russia. The big-
gest threat to Russia today in terms of its internal terri-
torial integrity is not going to come from minorities. If 
I had to guess where a problem might arise, and I was 
just there for the sixth time in 10 years, it is in the 
Russian Far East. I think that the Russians are going to 
have more problems dealing with Russian territories 
that perceive themselves as different and that resent 
Muscovite rule than from the minorities themselves. 
There is a strong movement in the Far East for that. 
DR. KAISER: I agree with parts of what Dr. Wixman 
has said. As I indicated in my presentation, a sense of 
national consciousness is something that typically pre-
cedes the drive for independence, and it is really 
absent for the most part in a lot of these smaller non-
Russian groups to the east. One region that Dr. Wix-
man didn't mention, which I think is critically impor-
tant, is the North Caucasus. It is an area without a 
large Russian population. Russians are leaving that 
area too, setting up the conditions through which a ris-
ing call for independence may occur. 
The Chechen republic, first of all, declared its inde-
pendence from the Chechen Ingush ASSR and 
declared its independence from Russia. It is the only 
one that has actually declared its outright indepen-
dence. At the same time, a lot of the North Caucasian 
peoples have joined together in a confederation. They 
are still a part of Russia but almost once removed in 
that sense. 
The other thing we are seeing in Russia is not only the 
non-Russians asking for or demanding as much inde-
pendence or autonomy as they can get but also Rus-
sians declaring their independence as republics. So a 
federation of maybe 88 republics may exist when 
everything is finished. Russian localism is, in part, a 
response and a reaction against minority nationalism, 
particularly among the nationally conscious groups 
like the Tatars, but it also may reflect a limited level of 
Russian nationalism itself that would be more centrip-
etal in its orientation. 
QUESTION: Of the 22 republics within the current 
Russian federation, one has seceded, several others 
have threatened to secede, and some are developing 
their own economic policies�in other words, eco-
nomically seceding. Is the center giving power to the 
regions or are the regions taking power from the cen-
ter? In the latter case, is it really a camouflage confed-
eration? 
DR. KAISER: This looks more to me like localism 
and regionalism than it does territorial nationalism. It 
is similar to the previous disintegrative process, but it 
does not appear as though an impetus for outright 
independence exists to the same degree that it did at 
the level of the Union republics. I should add a caveat 
here: not all Union republics were equally secession-
ist, and the Central Asian republics were not necessar-
ily all that proindependence when this process first 
began. It was the Baltic states that were pushing this 
forward, and a kind of diffusion occurred from there. 
Some of the republics even accepted independence as 
a fait accompli after August 1991. 
71 
In short, all the groups do not have to be nationalistic, 
but the wave of territorial nationalism that is needed to 
get the ball rolling toward the ultimate point of disin-
tegration currently does not appear to exist within the 
Russian Federation. 
DR. WIXMAN: The real issue within the Russian 
state�with the few exceptions of some of the nation-
als on the periphery who are really inconsequential to 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Russia anyway�is a question of decentralization ver-
sus centralization, more than of ethnicity. 
QUESTION: To what extent will patterns of trade and 
commerce shift the regional identification of the Rus-
sians who live in the Far East from considering them-
selves to be Russians to considering themselves a part 
of the Pacific Rim or the Northeast Asian community? 
'Will such patterns accelerate the trends that you are 
speaking of in terms of localization? 
DR. KAISER: Dr. Wixman seems to see more of a 
potential for separatism in the Far East among the 
Russians themselves than I do. On the ethnic map of 
Russia, the Far East is overwhelmingly Russian and 
has been since about 1700. Even so, the region is 
sparsely populated; only about 25 million people live 
east of the Urals. I suppose a redirection or reorienta-
tion of the population could occur, because there is a 
great deal of localism there. Two different regional 
restructuring processes have been at work, however. 
First, the Russians themselves are reorganizing and 
directing their attention to the Pacific Rim and think-
ing more in local and economic terms; second, the 
non-Russian population is banding together in groups_ 
and organizing to try to gain political clout. Neither of 
these restructuring processes is on the same level as an 
independence movement and certainly not on that of a 
movement based on ethnonationalism. Instead, local 
Russian areas are demanding more autonomy within a 
more decentralized Russia and particularly seek 
greater control over the economic wealth that flows 
through their region. Because these Russians are not 
sacrificing for the good of Mother Russia and all Rus-
sians, one could probably question the level of their 
Russian national consciousness and their common 
sense of homeland, but this localism/regionalism is 
not on the same order of magnitude as separatist 
nationalism. 
DR. WIXMAN: I think the movement for autonomy 
in the Russian Far East is greater than in even the eth-
nic regions. There is a strong anticentralist feeling. 
There is no question that the population is Russian; 
they are just as Russian as anyone else. But who 
resides in the Russian Far Past? The descendants of 
the people who fled to the Far Fast to escape central 
authority before the Soviets took over and of those 
people who were sent there after 1917. This is the 
group_of people in the Russian empire who, more than 
anyone else, has had an antagonistic attitude toward 
Moscow for decades. They are located on the Pacific, 
so a strong movement exists toward stronger ties to 
Korea, Japan, the United States, and Canada. 
QUESTION: Would you comment on the relation 
between ethnicity and environment? 
DR. KAISER: At the beginning of the independence 
movements, a lot of national fronts�particularly in 
the Baltic states and in Belarus�began as environ-
mental movements. Environmentalism and national-
ism�especially national independence�were very 
closely tied, not only in the Baltic states but also in 
many of the European republics. 
This should not be surprising because people consid-
ered their soil to be sacred�as the only place where 
their nation could survive and prosper�and they 
became angry when it was polluted by forces outside 
their control. Indeed, a lot of the region's polluting 
industries were moved in at the behest of Moscow. 
Along with them came Russians, so the ethnic feature 
was added on top of the environmental one. 
Since independence, environmentalism has often 
taken a back seat to nationalism and independence. 
For example, nationalists in Estonia who had 
lamented the fact that Russians had set up an oil shale 
mining operation there now say they need to keep that 
operation going so as not to rely on Russia for oil. The 
same thing occurred in Lithuania with the Ignalina 
nuclear plant. The Lithuanians have talked about add-
ing a third unit to that nuclear facility�even though 
before independence it was a symbol of Soviet 
oppression and a symbol of the environmental degra-
dation of the homeland. In Ukraine, there is even talk 
about keeping Chomobyl' (Chernobyl') in operation 
and maybe expanding it as well. In Armenia, a nuclear 
plant had been shut down by grassroots opposition 
because it was on a geologic faultline and has been 
damaged by earthquakes. Now the Armenians are 
considering reopening it because they need local

energy sources since the pipelines from Azerbaijan 
and Georgia have been cut. Environmentalism is on 
the back burner and has been decoupled from nation-
alism in these kinds of economic decision making pro-
cesses. Environmentalism was promoted when it was 
useful to the nationalists and their struggle for inde-
pendence, but it is now seen as competing with the 
nations' efforts to be less dependent on external 
resources--especially those supplied by Russia.

Geographic Factors in Ethnic 
Conflict in Africa 
Harm J. de Blij

Introduction 
Over the past decade, no geographic realm has suf-
fered as severely from ethnic conflict as Africa. Entire 
countries have been devastated by years of ethnic 
strife. Millions of Africans have become displaced 
persons in their own countries or refugees in others. 
Hundreds of thousands are imperiled by hunger and 
starvation, and ruling regimes are in some instances 
preventing food and medicine from reaching the dislo-
cated. 
This paper will focus on the geographic realm of 
Africa, not the entire African continent. Geographi-
cally defined, this realm extends from the zone of 
Islamic contact along the southern margins of the 
Sahara to the Cape of Good Hope. It includes nearly 
50 countries, an area of more than 8 million square 
miles, and�as of midyear 1994�a population of 
572 million. 
Factors Aggravating Ethnic Divisiveness 
The prevalence of etImic conflict and dislocation in 
Africa must be seen against a background of: (1) rapid 
population growth, (2) a problem-ridden international 
and internal boundary framework, (3) rising religious 
fundamentalism, (4) persistent neocolonialism, 
(5) historic animosities, and (6) stagnant or deteriorat-
ing economies�factors that serve to aggravate exist-
ing divisions. 
In rural as well as in urban areas, Africa's high growth 
rates contribute to the ethnic tensions and conflicts 
that afflict the realm. As a world geographic realm, 
Africa presently exhibits the highest rates of natural 
population growth. This continues despite the AIDS 
pandemic in tropical Africa and the realm's pernicious 
and debilitating plagues and diseases. Such population 
growth, attended by doubling times as low as 18 
years, fills natural ethnic buffer zones, places further 
stress on already overexploited environments, and cre-
ates a growing urbanward flow. 
Sub-Saharan Africa's existing boundaries have con-
tributed to, rather than mitigated, ethnic conflict in 
Africa. The framework of the continent's international 
political boundaries, as has been said ad infinitum, is a 
troublesome legacy of the colonial period. This is 
more true in some areas (such as the Horn) than in 
others (the South), but overall, such boundaries still 
divide people of common origins; elsewhere they 
throw a girdle around peoples with adversarial histo-
ries. Many African states have sought to accommo-
date the latter by manipulating their internal borders. 
Rising religious fundamentalism in Africa mirrors 
what is happening all over the world today, from 
Algeria to India to America. A number of African 
countries lie astride religious transition zones, includ-
ing Nigeria and Sudan, and religious fervor is contrib-
uting to ethnic strife in these countries. 
Neocolonialism remains a factor in Sub-Saharan 
Africa in various forms, ranging from outright inter-
ference in national affairs to economic intervention. 
French forces have acted in support of governments in 
countries plagued by ethnic strife; in effect, the French 
involved themselves in ethnic conflicts�recently in 
Burundi, earlier in Chad. US support for Zaire's 
Mobutu has contributed to the continued comparative 
stability of that vast country; it undoubtedly has 
staved off-ethnic strife there, and it has played a useful 
role�from the US viewpoint�in the war in neigh-
boring Angola. Accusations of-collaboration with 
"neocolonial" interests often stoke the fires of ethnic 
conflict. 
Sub-Saharan Africa's economies, in aggregate, are 
alone in showing an overall decline over the past 
decade. Declining living standards tend to exacerbate 
ethnic rivalries; in comparatively wealthy Europe, the

economic slowdown has also been attended by 
increasing ethnic strife. Even during the expansion of 
the 1980s, African economies lagged; with the world 
economy slowed down, African economies deterio-
rate. Economic growth provides opportunities and 
lessens frustrations. In Africa, the opposite situation 
prevails. 
This is not the place to recapitulate the historical 
geography of black Africa, but its outlines�West 
Africa's cultural flowering, that region's ancient 
savanna states, the arrival and diffusion of Islam, the 
European colonial intervention, the imposition of the 
boundary framework, contrasting colonial policies 
and practices, and the rise of African nationalism�
must be kept in mind, for they are etched on cultural 
landscapes, and they still influence interethnic rela-
tions today. 
No African region has been immune from costly eth-
nic conflict. In West Africa, the most destructive con-
flict since the Biafra War has ravaged Liberia. In 
Equatorial Africa, southern Chad and the southern 
Sudan have been engulfed by war. In the Horn, Soma-
lia has become synonymous with ethnic strife, and 
Ethiopia and Eritrea witnessed years of tribal fighting. 
In East Africa, Uganda has been a caldron of ethnic 
conflict, and today Rwanda and Burundi continue to 
suffer. And in southern Africa? an uncertain truce has 
quieted decades of war in Angola, while ethnic strife 
is at least temporarily quiescent in South Africa. 
This incomplete summary of current and recent ethnic 
conflict notwithstanding, some African countries have 
achieved ethnic accommodation against great odds. 
Africa is divided into more than 1,000 ethnolinguistic 
domains, creating cultural mosaics that make the 
former Yugoslavia look uncomplicated by compari-
son. Political geographers often point to India as mira-
cle of multicultural stability, but Nigeria's continuity 
may be a greater achievement still. Senegal, Tanzania, 
Zambia, Botswana, and Namibia are other success 
stories. 
A Typology of Ethnic Conflict in Africa 
Ethnic conflict in Africa has variable roots, suggesting 
a typology that may help assess it. Along the Islamic/ 
non-Islamic transition zone in the north, the ultimate 
cause of conflict often is religious, as is the case in 
Sudan today and has been in Chad. This should not 
imply that religion is the sole incentive, but it does 
dominate here. In the case of Sudan, fear of Khar-
toum's imposition of sharia criminal law upon Chris-
tian and animist southerners is a catalyst for conflict. 
A second form of conflict may be designated as tribal 
and is exemplified by what is happening today in 
Liberia. With a population well under 3 million, 
Liberia incorporates more than a dozen major ethnic 
groups, including the Kpelle (about 20 percent of the 
population), Bassa (14 percent), Grebo (9 percent), 
Gio (8 percent), ICru (7 percent), and Mano (7 per-
cent). In 1990 the country collapsed into civil war, in 
which tribal loyalties were paramount. Tens of thou-
sands were killed, and nearly 1 million refugees 
streamed across Liberia's borders. 
A third kind of ethnic conflict has strategic origins: it 
may have started as a tribal struggle but has worsened 
by external interests. In early 1995, one of these con-
flicts had recently abated: the war between Popular 
Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA) and 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola 
(UNITA) forces in Angola. A fourth form of conflict 
may be categorized as reformist. This has its origins in 
the political transformation of a state. For example, in 
Kenya during the runup to independence, the Mau 
Mau rebellion was essentially a Kikuyu movement 
aimed not only against whites but also against "collab-
orators." In fact, many more Africans than Europeans 
lost their lives during that period, and animosities 
between Kikuyu and non-Kikuyu endured after inde-
pendence. The first clashes in Liberia involved the 
ouster of the Americo-Liberian elite by the so-called 
aborigines, as the indigenous peoples of Liberia were 
called. In Zimbabwe, Mashona/Matabele conflict 
arose in similar context. 
In Africa today, the geographic dimension of ethnic 
conflict is this: religious strife affects principally the 
northern cultural transition zone; reformist conflict 
prevails in the south; and tribal war not directly 
related to external influences afflicts the central zone, 
most severely in Rwanda and Liberia. Persistent stra-
tegic conflict has devastated Angola and, while quies-
cent at present, still looms in Mozambique.

The Environment as a Factor 
It is drought that has been, and continues to be, 
Africa's greatest and most consequential environmen-
tal problem. The pulsations of the Sahara are now bet-
ter understood than they were during the 1970s, when 
the word "sahel" became synonymous with environ-
mental disaster. Not only did that desertification phase 
claim as many as a half million human (and countless 
animal) lives but it also caused ethnic strife in coun-
tries to the south. The geographer Thomas Bassett 
documented the results when cattle herders from the 
desiccated savannas took their livestock into farm-
lands in the Cote d'Ivoire, where crops were trampled 
and fighting broke out. Soon, the northerners were 
blaming the (then) Abidjan-based government for not 
supporting them effectively during the crisis, and 
North-South relations�always difficult in coastal 
West African countries�worsened. 
In Ethiopia, several successive years of drought turned 
out to be a more formidable adversary to the Marxist 
regime in Addis Ababa than any insurrection was�
when the crops failed and people streamed off the land, 
the insurgency became unstoppable. Now, with Eritrea 
an independent state, Ethiopia is landlocked�its politi-
cal future far from certain. In addition, Eritrean ethnic 
unity is a myth; for example, the Afar (who extend into 
Djibouti and whose domain centers on the port of 
Assab) have a claim to nationhood that may well 
reemerge in the future. Environmental conditions also 
contributed to the downfall of the Barre regime in 
Somalia. Crop failures and famines in the south led to 
the movement of people and livestock across traditional 
clan-territorial boundaries, and in the ensuing clashes 
lay the origins of the weak government's collapse. The 
current conflict in Somalia, it should be noted, however 
is not an "ethnic" conflict in the terms of this discus-
sion; it is not religious, tribal, strategic, or reformist. 
The Somali nation s' ethnic and religious uniformity 
does not extend to territorial unity: six major clans and 
hundreds of subclans occupy bounded and inviolable 
spaces not only in Somalia but also in eastern Ethiopia, 
eastern Kenya, and southern Djibouti. Significantly, the 
north, which suffered least from drought and resultant 
dislocation, has been virtually untouched by the prob-
lems of the south. 
Although news media have paid comparatively little 
attention to it, searing, decadelong drought, the worst 
in living memory, has prevailed over interior southern 
Africa, affecting lives and economies from Malawi and 
Zambia to South Africa (Tanzania and southern Zaire 
also were affected). This drought, which came at a time 
when nearly 1 million refugees from Mozambique 
crossed into Malawi and when Angola was consumed 
by a civil war, contributed to food shortages and politi-
cal unrest in Zambia; one is tempted to speculate that, 
without it, Kenneth Kaunda still would be President. 
Perhaps more important, the drought has done much 
damage in Zimbabwe, where small fanners on the Afri-
can-owned lands suffered visibly while white owners of 
large estates fared better As economic conditions wors-
ened and the Mugabe government's popularity plum-
meted the dormant land issue was revived�in the form 
of the 1992 Land Acquisition Bill. Zimbabwe's commer-
cial farmers, who number almost 4,500 (nearly all 
white) still own 30 percent of all of Zimbabwe. They 
have sustained the agricultural economy, producing 
about 80 percent of the country's cash crops. The Zim-
babwean Government wants to force the sale of half the 
whites' land for the purpose of resettling black farmer 
families. Although the program is opposed by Zimba-
bwe's donors and lenders, including Britain and the 
IMF, it is likely to proceed All this is happening at a 
time when multiparty democracy is being forced on a 
government that controls 147 of the 150 seats in the 
parliament. The drought forces the land issue; the land 
issue will cause ethnic discord in a country long known 
for its successful transition. 
In a realm where most of the population continues to 
live on and depend directly on the land environmental 
swings soon lead to human dislocation, and dislocation 
translates into conflict�often ethnic conflict. As the 
growing rifts in the European Union remind us, intercul-
tural harmony is easiest to generate when economic 
times are good. When livelihoods are threatened, the 
human reaction is to blame outsiders�that is, noneth-
nics, whether they be North African or Turkish immi-
grants or local minorities. In Europe, the problem is 
recession; in Africa, it is unpredictable, fluctuating envi-
ronments.

Current Ethnic Conflicts 
In Africa it often is difficult to distinguish ethnic con-
flict of the kind being discussed here from local or 
temporary strife resulting from political processes. 
The worldwide democratization movement is also 
affecting African countries, and frequently this has 
ethnic overtones because one-party rule tends to mean 
one-culture dominance and because military rule often 
(although not always) means the same. When multi-
party politics reached Togo, there were deathly riots 
that might have led to ongoing ethnic strife, but that 
did not follow. In Ghana, the continued rule of strong-
man Jerry Rawlings is greased by comparatively 
strong economic growth, but ethnic issues are forcibly 
submerged. In Chad, seemingly always on the verge 
of civil war, successive coup attempts and French mil-
itary involvement punctuate the apparently hopeless 
struggle toward representative government. Indeed, in 
1994, full-scale ethnic conflict was in progress in sev-
eral locations. 
Liberia 
ECOMOG, the Economic Community of West Afri-
can States (ECOWAS) peacekeeping force, has sup-
pressed but not eliminated the carnage. What began as 
the ouster of the Americo-Liberian regime in Mon-
rovia (and thus as a reformist conflict) evolved into an 
ethnic struggle involving supporters of the strongman, 
President Samuel Doe, and two rebels, Taylor and 
Johnson. Now a tribal conflict, the struggle has no end 
in sight, and the survival of Liberia as an entity is in 
doubt. 
Sudan 
The latest phase of four decades of regional conflict in 
the Sudan is more than 10 years old. It is classic reli-
gious-ethnic struggle on the northern perimeter of 
black Africa, but it is not simply a contest between 
north and south. Sudan has a complex ethnolinguistic 
mosaic. The northern provinces contain about 60 per-
cent of the total population, and, while the north is 
overwhelmingly Muslim, only about two-thirds of the 
northerners speak Arabic as their native language. The 
Muslim but non-Arab northerners�including the Fur 
and Zaghawa in Darfur, the Nuba in South Kordofan, 
the Nubians of the far north, and others�have been 
propaganda targets of the (south based) Sudan Peo-
ple's Liberation Movement (SPLM). In the years lead-
ing up to and following the coup that ousted Nimieri, 
conflict among non-Arab Northern ethnic groups, 
notably the Nuba and the Beni Amer in Red Sea Prov-
ince, continued even as the larger war intensified. 
The SPLM's military wing, the Sudan People's Liber-
ation Army, began its war against "the North" in 1983, 
in opposition to the Nimeiri government, which in that 
year announced the imposition of the sharia law over 
all of Sudan. The North-South war has swept back and 
forth across the countryside, devastating infrastructure 
and livelihoods and seemingly incapable of resolution. 
In the southern provinces, too, joint opposition to 
Khartoum's rule was not enough to submerge ethnic 
conflicts. The schism between the Dinka-dominated 
faction, led by John Garang, and the mainly Nuer fac-
tion, a breakaway group led by Riek Mashar, has pro-
duced a three-way struggle. (The Dinka are from the 
west bank of the Nile, the Nuer, from the east, on the 
Ethiopian border). In mid-1992, a further power strug-
gle produced still another split in the southern ranks. 
In June 1992, the warring parties met but without a 
settlement. In 1994, the North appeared poised to 
overcome the divided Southern forces, and promises 
of freedom of belief and religious observance, made 
by the government in 1992 in Abuja during negotia-
tions under Nigerian auspices, were no longer heard. 
The regime that took power in 1989 is intransigent 
and virulently anti-Christian and anti-Western; in the 
wake of the World Trade Center bombing, when the 
United States declared Sudan a "terrorist state," it 
expressed fears it shared with the southerners about to 
come under Khartoum's sharia heel. The human cost 
of the Sudan conflict is staggering: in 1994 there were 
an estimated 7 million malnourished and 3 million 
starvation-threatened refugees in Sudan. Both the 
Khartoum regime and the southern factions have 
impeded the flow of relief to these refugees on the 
grounds that such aid has "strategic" value.

Djibouti and Somalia 
Although Djibouti and Somalia lie on the African con-
tinent, they are not, by regional definition, African 
states. The situation in Somalia has been summarized. 
In Djibouti, two dominant ethnic groups, the Afars (or 
Danakil) and the Issas, have a history of conflict. The 
Issas, who constitute about one-third of the total popu-
lation of about 500,000, inhabit the southern third of 
the country. They spill over into Somalia (where they 
number about 60,000) and Ethiopia (some 250,000). 
In Djibouti, they constitute the majority. The Afars 
inhabit the northern two-thirds of Djibouti; they form 
about one-fifth of the total population. Their domain 
extends into Eritrea as well as Ethiopia, where they 
number some 600,000. Five other main ethnic groups 
make up the rest of the population. 
Power in Djibouti has resided with the Issas, who 
dominate the armed forces. In 1991, a guerilla move-
ment arose in Afar territory, culminating in December 
in the notorious Arhiba massacre in Djibouti City, 
when government troops killed numerous Afars. 
Although efforts were made (with French involve-
ment) to defuse the situation, things remained violent 
and tense in 1993. Some observers suggest that the 
independence of Eritrea will impel a reorganized Ethi-
opia to involve itself in Djibouti's affairs. 
Rwanda and Burundi 
This country lies between countries in which some of�
Africa's bloodiest ethnic conflict has taken place, 
Uganda and Burundi. In Uganda, the Baganda were at 
the center of the strife; in Rwanda and Burundi, the 
long-term issue is between the Tutsi (Watusi) and the 
Hutu. During four months in 1972, more than 100,000 
Hutus were killed by the minority Tutsi in Burundi. 
Ethnic strife in October 1993 and April 1994 added 
more than 600,000 to the death toll. 
Historically, the Tutsi were smaller in number, but 
stronger in terms of power, than were the Hum. The 
Tutsi, organized into kingdoms, acquired land and 
subjugated the Hutu. Social standing more than tribal 
origin distinguished Hutu from Tutsi. Repression, 
rebellion, and chaos followed independence, with the 
Hutu staking their claim to power and privilege and 
the Tutsi fighting to retain it. The conflict always had a 
lower profile in international affairs than the Amin 
episode and its excesses in Uganda, but its costs were 
nevertheless enormous. 
The latest phase began in late 1990, when a contingent 
of Tutsi refugees in exile in Uganda invaded northern 
Rwanda. The (Hutu) Habyarimana government 
responded not only by sending a defending army but 
also by arresting and executing Tutsis in the country. 
The Tutsi force, under the banner of the Rwanda Patri-
otic Front, survived an early setback and moved 
toward the capital, Kigali. According to correspon-
dents on the scene, external forces also played a role 
in the conflict. The French helped the Kigali govern-
ment, and there were reports of Ugandan support for 
the rebels. French support was based, reportedly, on 
the Francophone nature of Rwanda's upper crust; the 
Tutsi had been "anglicized" in Uganda, and there were 
French fears of Francophone loss in the event of Tutsi 
success. 
All this became moot in April 1994 following the 
death of Rwanda's President in a suspicious plane 
crash at Kigali Airport. Hutu militias embarked on an 
orgy of (apparently planned and premeditated) murder 
of Tutsis and "moderate" or "collaborationist" Hutus. 
The ensuing refugee flow can-led as many as 2 million 
Rwandans into Zaire and Tanzania; as many as 
600,000 were killed. In March 1995, Tutsi in Burundi 
attacked Hutu, and the cycle of violence returned to 
this country. No end to this tribal conflict is in sight. 
Angola 
The disastrous and continuing conflict in Angola was 
an ethnic conflict magnified by strategic forces, and in 
the aftermath of the Cold War it continued unabated. 
Dominant in the ethnic jigsaw of Angola have been 
the Mbundu in the east, the Ovimbundu of the center 
and west, the Balcongo of the north, and the Ovambo 
of the south. Luanda, the capital, lies in the Mbundu 
heartland. In the anticolonial struggle, each ethnic 
group formed its own movement: the Mbundu-
dominated MPLA in the Luanda hinterland, the 
Bakongo-run FNLA, and Ovambo-Ovimbundu 
UNITA of the south. In the postindependence civil 
war, the FNLA was quickly ousted, and a prolonged 
78

Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
battle between the MPLA and UNITA began. Eventu-
ally this conflict became internationalized with Cuban 
troops in support of the MPLA and South African and 
other external assistance to UNITA. The role of Zaire 
in the issue was significant. After the FNLA went into 
oblivion, Zaire moved its support to UNITA; this was 
a natural move, given Mobutu's dependence on the 
United States. Zaire's taking sides in Angola's civil 
war had the effect of creating behind-the-back secu-
rity for Savimbi's UNITA. 
After the withdrawal of Cuban troops, the collapse of 
the MPLA's sponsor�the Soviet Union�and the 
withdrawal of South African support for UNITA, 
mediation by Herman Cohen and his staff produced an 
agreement for a multiparty election in 1992. In that 
election, the Dos Santos�led MPLA was victorious, 
winning 128 seats in the legislature to 71 for UNITA. 
Neither Dos Santos nor Savirnbi received 50 percent 
of the vote, however, creating the need for a presiden-
tial runoff election. Savimbi charged that the election 
had been fraudulent, and, on 30 October 1992, fight-
ing broke out in Luanda and the civil war resumed. 
Neither side appeared capable of vanquishing the 
other completely, at least not without external, mas-
sive help. The question arose whether it should be US 
policy to promote a partition of this large country; the 
latitudinal morphology of the territory might make 
such a solution the sole alternative to endless ethnic 
strife. In 1994, renewed international efforts to medi-
ate the Angolan conflict again appeared to have suc-
cess, and a government was installed in Luanda. But 
the fundamental divisions of Angola remain. 
Potential Ethnic Conflicts 
Latent ethnic conflict exists in many African coun-
tries. In Southern Africa, Mozambique has just 
emerged from years of ethnic strife, but the situation 
remains fragile, and many thousands of refugees have 
not yet returned home. In Zaire, the inevitable politi-
cal transition may yield an explosion of long-sup-
pressed ethnic conflict. In long-stable Kenya, the risk 
of ethnic strife has risen in recent years, apparently 
stoked by official actions. In Chad, major conflict has 
recurred for decades and is likely to take place again. 
Other plural African societies, from Sierra Leone to 
South Africa, contend with potential ethnic conflict as 
a matter of course. 
Nigeria 
Nowhere are the risks as great, the stakes as high, or 
the divisions as deep as they are in Nigeria, Africa's 
most populous country. Nigeria's arid north lies 
deeply embedded in Islamic Africa, and its palm-
fringed southern coastlines are part of Africa's Chris-
tian and animist world. British colonialism threw a 
lasso around some 200 ethnolinguistic groups scat-
tered across a wide range of environmental and cul-
tural zones. The survival of Nigeria (despite a bitter 
war of secession) is an African achievement of nota-
ble proportions. Now Nigeria's unity is threatened. 
Nigeria's population may number 100 million or 
more; the issue of census accuracy has roiled its poli-
tics for years. Among more than 200 ethnic groups, 
three are dominant: the Hausa-Fulani of the North, the 
Yoruba of the Southwest, and the Ibo (Igbo) of the 
Southeast. These major nations (for such they are) 
have considerable disdain for each other. Muslim 
Hausa say that Yoruba are godless and uncultured. Ibo 
describe the Hausa as backward and uneducated. To 
Northerners, the Ibo are money-mad merchants who 
will do anything for a price. Nigeria was born an 
uneasy federation with three states centered on these 
dominant nations; today it is a country of 30 states try-
ing to emulate not Westminster's system but Washing-
ton's. 
The religious composition of the Nigerian population 
is estimated as follows: Muslims, 50 million; Chris-
tians, 37 million; others (chiefly animists) 12 million. 
(The much disputed 1991 census of Nigeria did not 
require Nigerians to answer questions about religion.) 
A substantial number of Yoruba, perhaps 2 million, 
are Muslims, but Islam in Nigeria long has had a mod-
erate tone. Some geographers have described the 
Yoruba as "middlemen" between Christian Easterners 
and the more dogmatic Muslim Northerners, defusing 
tensions that might have led to religious conflict. 
79

The rise of religious fundamentalism�not just 
Islamic, but also Christian fundamentalism�threatens 
Nigeria's future. In the North, where Islam predomi-
nates, Christianity has footholds, and coexistence has 
been the rule. Despite sporadic skirmishes, tensions 
along religious lines have excalated in recent years. 
There are a growing number of Muslim preachers who 
advocate Islamic radicalism and who call for an 
"Islamic republic" in Nigeria. In 1991, a Muslim fun-
damentalist in Katsina whipped up anti-Christian fer-
vor that spread to Bauchi State and led to the killing of 
more than 1,000 people in religious riots. In 1992, 
hundreds of Hausa Muslims were massacred by Chris-
tians in Kaduna State. Significantly, that conflict had 
ethnic as well as religious overtones�the Christians 
were Katafs. 
In the southern states, Islamic radicalism is viewed 
with a growing concern. In 1986, General Babangida, 
the country's strongman president, allowed Nigeria to 
join the Organization of the Islamic Conference 
(OIC), the global association of Islamic countries; 
Christian leaders in the South were outraged and said 
so from pulpits. For the first time since the Biafra War, 
voices favoring secession are heard in the South, nota-
bly in the southeast, but also in Yorubaland. 
Will things fall apart? The potential for conflict is 
greater today than it has been at any time since the 
Biafra War a quarter of a century ago. Frustration with 
incompetent and despotic military government is rife. 
Corruption is endemic. Infrastructure lies in ruins, 
from impassable roads to shuttered universities. Dom-
ination of national affairs by Muslims is becoming an 
issue in the South at a time when Muslim fundamen-
talism is on the rise. 
Nigeria may dissolve into ethnic conflict much as 
Sudan has, but, to the world at large, this prospect is 
far more worrisome in Nigeria's case. Nigeria is an 
African cornerstone, a country well connected to the 
rest of the world, OPEC's fourth-largest oil producer, 
and a model of Christian-Islamic coexistence on 
Africa's troubled transition zone. The breakup of 
Nigeria would be a geopolitical catastrophe. 
South Africa 
In terms of international importance, regional impact, 
or virtually any other measure, the prospect of South 
Africa's collapse into ethnic conflict would be incom-
parable. South Africa's multicultural society is a 
microcosm of the world, with linkages to Europe, 
America, and Asia. It remains Africa's most powerful 
and productive economy. It is a land not only of great 
potential for the long term but also of great danger for 
the near future. 
It may be inappropriate to place South Africa in a 
rubric of "potential" ethnic conflict. In fact, ethnic 
conflict has existed in South Africa for many decades, 
even centuries. Today, thousands are dying every year 
in ethnic strife as the apartheid system is dismantled. 
South Africans of all races are trying to achieve a tran-
sition that has been accomplished by revolution else-
where; but some on several sides of this complicated 
process are, or appear to be, intent on promoting con-
flict. 
Actual and potential ethnic conflict in South Africa 
exists at several levels: these may be categorized as 
intraethnic, interethnic, and interracial. 
Violent conflict within ethnic sectors of the South 
African population rose with the political tide and 
with the approach of constitutional resolution. 
Although newspaper and television accounts some-
times give the impression that the Zulu nation (for 
such it is) largely supports Inkatha and opposes Man-
dela's African National Congress (ANC), the fact is 
that much of the deathly violence in Natal and on the 
Rand was between Zulu Inkatha supporters on the one 
hand and Zulu ANC members on the other. The Zulu 
nation is fragmented by a myriad of clan lineages and 
boundaries, and clan conflict has worsened severely as 
a direct result of the political contest. 
Violent conflict between ethnic groups in the republic 
occurs in the squalid townships and sometimes on 
railroad cars taking people to and from work, but, in 
fact, South Africa has hitherto escaped widespread, 
regional strife of this kind. Undoubtedly some of the 
80

ongoing Inkatha-ANC violence has ethnic overtones, 
but given the circumstances in the country, interethnic 
violence has been limited. This is undoubtedly due to 
the multiethnic, indeed multiracial, character of the 
ANC leadership. Just as Inkatha does not represent all 
(or even most) Zulu, so the ANC is not an all-Xhosa 
organization. Still, in the popular image, the Inkatha-
ANC political struggle often is seen, in the final analy-
sis, as a Zulu-Xhosa clash, a continuation of historic 
rivalries, and the preamble to another round between 
ancient adversaries. 
This is not to suggest that interethnic conflict is not 
latent and potentially explosive. The assassination of 
Communist Party leader Chris Hani was done by a 
white killer, but what might have happened had the 
assassin been an African? So much now depends on 
the lives of Mandela and Buthelezi. 
The ultimate question, of course, is whether ANC 
dominance of government will be followed by a strug-
gle among the victors in which, for example, those 
supporting Winnie Mandela might play a crucial role. 
In Kenya, the ouster of the colonialists was followed 
by an interethnic struggle that relegated the Luo to 
lesser standing in the Kikuyu-dominated state. But 
that conflict claimed comparatively few lives, cer-
tainly as compared to what happened in Zimbabwe 
after its independence. There, the Mashona-dominated 
Mugabe regime ruthlessly suppressed the Nkomo-led 
Matabele in regional/ethnic conflict of enormous cost 
in lives and property. Since then, Bulawayo and 
Matabeleland have been the disadvantaged corners on 
Zimbabwe's map. 
Observers argue that South Africa's considerable eth-
nic integration would be likely to mitigate such 
events; there is so much ethnic mixture, the argument 
goes, that regional conflict is unlikely. But in other 
countries, such mixture also has led to chronic strife 
(for example among Muslims and numerous Christian 
minorities in Nigeria's North). Much will depend on 
the political campaign now in progress and on the 
ANC's ability to avoid factionalization along ethnic 
lines. 
The April 1994 elections that brought the ANC to 
power also produced a delicate regional balance. As 
early as February 1995, the Inkatha members of par-
liament grew restive under the new system and 
walked out of the assembly, underscoring the potential 
weaknesses of the system. The growing risk is that not 
only Inkatha but also other components of South 
Africa's polity will feel that the new order disadvan-
tages them. 
Should the South African transition collapse into vio-
lence, that conflict will resonate in the United States 
as perhaps no other could. The notion that economic 
sanctions would hasten the end of apartheid led to 
some voluntary and much involuntary adherence in 
this country; those who argued that they would lead to 
economic disaster that would doom a postapartheid 
transition were branded as racists. In the streets and on 
campuses, the prosanction movement generated 
marches and demonstrations. One must therefore con-
template the impact in this country of ethnic and/or 
racial conflict in South Africa: such conflict would 
resonate in the United States, possibly with the feroc-
ity of Northern Ireland's conflict in Britain. Interracial 
conflict in Zimbabwe could be ignored; interethnic 
strife in Bosnia, complete with hundreds of thousands 
of casualties and concentration camp honors, barely 
roils American society. But South Africa has the 
ingredients to force the issue: a growing link between 
the US black community and ANC leadership; a latent 
sympathy for the white plight in a revolution-torn 
South Africa on the part of political conservatives in 
this country; and the recent history of involvement, 
first by businesses adhering to the Sullivan principles, 
then by sanctions advocates in driving them out. For 
the United States, there is more at stake, perhaps, in 
South Africa's difficult transition than there is in the 
ethnic conflicts of all other African countries com-
bined.

Summary of Discussion 
Discussant: Rex Honey 
I think we need to keep the African experience, as 
with the former Soviet Union experience, in historical 
context We need to look at precolonial Africa to 
understand the Africa of today. Much of the culture of 
contemporary Africa predates the colonial time. To 
take a word from social theory jargon, the cultures of 
Africa have been deeply sedimented within traditional 
structures that resist change. Nevertheless, existing 
structures, such as kinship and traditional social ties 
are being battered by the kind of changes that are now 
occurring. 
This is not to suggest that, before the colonial period, 
there was an Africa that was stagnant. In the 19th cen-
tury, the Islamic Jihad had an impact across the S ahe-
lian region and penetrated south. Sub-Saharan Africa 
has traded with other areas, such as the Middle East 
and Europe, for a long time. Of course slave trade was 
a terrible aspect of that trade, but only part of it; there 
was trade before and considerable trade afterward. In 
addition, there have always been migrations of Afri-
can peoples. 
During the colonial period, there occurred the imposi-
tion of protostates and, eventually, the European 
nation-state model on Africa, I think it would be use-
ful to consider how European states came about, the 
structure of these states, and the kinds of things that 
led to successful or unsuccessful states in Europe, and 
then to look at the African states to see how they com-
pare. A very telling description of the evolution of the 
European national-state--and I will use that term 
instead of nation-state, because it is broader�is, that 
over the past millennium, successful states in Europe 
were those that were able to accumulate capital�that 
is to say, economic power�and to amass the power of 
coersion to defend themselves, conquer others, and 
maintain law and order. 
The sad part of what has happened in Africa is that the 
imposition of this European national-state has come 
at a time when the technology for coercing is at the 
greatest it has ever been in history�both in terms of 
weapons and of the electronic media. As such, the 
ability of states to get from their people what they 
want has never been so high. The biggest difference 
between the bullies of Europe in earlier times and the 
bullies of Africa now is that those in Africa have a lot 
more power in terms of weapons and communication 
controls. 
Another factor that is a legacy of the colonial time is 
the introduction and spread of Christianity. Christian-
ity mainly came into Sub-Saharan Africa in the 19th 
century and spread north at the same time that Islam 
was spreading south. Colonial regimes impacted the 
current religious map because they often controlled 
where the missionaries were able to work. This was 
certainly the case in Nigeria. 
In Nigeria, about 50 percent of the population is Mus-
lim, about 40 percent is Christian, and 30 percent is 
animist, and I do mean those numbers�they total 
120 percent. The indigenous cultures of Nigeria are 
still important in post�Cold War Africa. Cold War 
influences have also been important; Professor de Blij 
touched on some of that. Certainly, many Cold War 
battles were fought, and some are still being fought, in 
Africa. Angola, certainly, is an example. The impacts 
of the Cold War have damaged Africa tremendously. 
The African economies have been very much trans-
formed by the penetration of international capital, 
largely with alliances of convenience between the 
leaders of the African countries and the transnational 
companies that have invested in them. It is no accident 
that the wealth of Mobutu is purported to be about 
equal to Zaire's national debt. 
The politics of many of the Sub-Saharan African 
countries is ethnic. The major prize within those coun-
tries is gaining control of the state, because control of 
the state is the source of wealth. A client-patron struc-
ture, which is a modification of traditional structures 
adapted to fit the current time, functions in many of 
these states. In many ways, the traditional leaders are 
stronger than they have ever been because the kinds of 
power they have access to are now much greater than 
those they formerly held.

Individuals often retain their allegiance to an ancestral 
group, but Americans probably misread what that alle-
giance is. My reading of Nigerians and of other West 
Africans is that it is not an ethnic allegiance�rather it 
is a more diverse allegiance to the ancestral place. The 
Yoruba of southwest Nigeria are clearly the major 
group, yet little Yoruba consciousness exists except 
for such cases as the recently aborted election, in 
which a Yoruba was elected president but not allowed 
to take office. The Yoruba fight among themselves as 
much as they fight with other groups, and the same 
thing holds true for the Ibo. They are only pulled 
together when they go up against the other groups. 
In Nigeria, one major factor in modern political life 
has been the hegemony of the north. Every Nigerian 
president has been a general or a Muslim alhaji.8 In 
most cases, they have been both. 
In Nigeria, there has been a politicization of ethnic 
identity and of ethnicity, even to the point of creating a 
new ethnic group. According to a Nigerian colleague 
of mine, the major ethnic group a the country, the 
Hausa-Fulani of the north, is something very new. 
Within Nigeria, there has recently been a reemergence 
of the national question: is Nigeria a given? Professor 
de Blij was right; Nigeria's continued existence is in 
jeopardy. 
The power of the state, of the current state, is 
extremely important. The state is the source of money; 
international money gets funneled into countries pri-
marily through the state apparatus, as do the revenues 
from the country's major source of income�the 
petroleum sector. The preeminence of the state in the 
formal economy has been important, and, in looking 
at how the economy works, we need to recognize that. 
The power of the state to coerce has also increased. 
What are the prospects? Clearly, economic depression 
leads to violence; that occurs in a lot of places. Part of 
Africa's problem is that, in immediate terms, much of 
Africa is not crucial to the West. South Africa is more 
crucial, given that country's wealth. That is not to say 
that we should not pay attention but that we do not pay 
attention. 
g One who has made the hall to Mecca. 
What can be done? We have to reconsider sovereignty 
and the relationships of what goes on in states. When I 
am optimistic, I look at the European Community as 
the model to address some problems that Africans 
face. In Europe there is a multitiered, flexible sover-
eignty that allows the movement of people and trade 
within the larger area but maintains local autonomy 
for cultural issues. 
The colonial boundaries are a continuing problem. 
The peoples of Africa never chose what their bound-
aries should be�they were imposed by outsiders. The 
Organization of African Unity (OAU) has a policy on 
boundaries that essentially says the boundaries are 
fixed and should not be reconsidered; what would 
happen if that policy got turned upside down? How 
can we formulate some kind of political process so 
that Africans can choose it without killing each other? 
That presents a problem in terms of self-
determination; and without self-determination, how 
do ethnic groups have rights? If ethnic groups do not 
have rights, then conflict will occur in those groups, 
and it is in out interest to take a look at that and see 
what kinds of things can be done and how we can be 
involved. I do think that important questions remain in 
terms of what the United States can do alone, which is 
not much. I would echo Professor de Blij's concern 
that inserting our forces over there may simply exac-
erbate the problem. 
General Discussion 
QUESTION: What type of a role do you see the 
United Nations playing in Rwanda and Liberia? 
DR. DE BLIJ: The UN's policy has been either to 
have a massive presence with a clear direction toward 
a particular goal or to have no presence at all. It is one 
of the tragedies of the New World Order that this con-
flict has to be allowed to run itself out as West Europe-
ans are allowing it to do in Bosnia. Political scientists 
say that, when a situation like this occurs, an average 
84 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
ratio of 10 UN forces to 1 rebel force is needed to con-
tain the anarchy; with the UN's current resources, that 
is not feasible. Furthermore, countries that participate 
in the UN peacekeeping operations, as in Somalia, and 
that experience casualties, will develop a great reluc-
tance to participate in support of this kind of policing 
action. 
Perhaps there ought to be standing regional forces in 
Africa, South America, and Central America for 
emergencies of this kind so that imperialist powers do 
not get involved in the kind of peacemaking that get 
soldiers killed. I am encouraged that ECOMOG, the 
West African force, has achieved as much as it has. I 
still believe that, with the UN's limitations, having 
standing regional forces is the way for regional prob-
lems to be solved. I am a great believer in UN inter-
vention, but I am not sure that the United Nations has 
the resources to intervene at the level it should have. 
DR. HONEY: I think what really needs to be done is 
to formulate a UN policy that provides a generic, 
rather than ad hoc, structure for intervening. I think 
the difficulty we have now is that we are building a 
house without a blueprint. Obviously, the world is not 
going to stop, but, if we really are going to have suc-
cessful interventions, we need to figure out institution-
ally how they will work. Then I think we will have a 
chance of some successes. 
QUESTION: You had mentioned the need for interna-
tional intervention in South Africa�potential UN 
intervention. I know that, currently, we're talking 
about election monitors. Is that sufficient to tide South 
Africa over until the election and afterwards? 
DR. DE BLIJ: In the case of South Africa, I think a 
massive intervention that might keep the peace there, 
should it be needed, would pay for itself for a century 
to come, whereas that might not be the case in, say 
Somalia or Rwanda. 
DR. HONEY: I am more optimistic about South 
Africa's future than Professor de Blij. We do not have 
a crystal ball, but I have a hunch that pragmatism is 
going to prevail. Clearly the ANC leadership, despite 
its at least titular Marxist past, understands that it is 
going to have to run that economy well to be able to 
make it work. I think that there is going to be a tre-
mendous effort by the leadership to hold things 
together. There are so many incentives in terms of the 
potential for South Africa that I think the possibility 
that people will actually get together and make things 
work is every bit as high as the possibility that we will 
have a conflagration. 
DR. DE BLIJ: I think that Professor Honey might be 
right except for the effect of sanctions. Those of us 
who supported the sanctions helped create in South 
Africa an ungovernable minority of hundreds of thou-
sands of young, uneducated Africans who said "liber-
ation before education." These youths will now be 
Nelson Mandela's major problem and are the major 
source of violence in the townships. Those people are 
not retrievable. Unemployment in South Africa is 48 
percent, not because there are not people to employ 
but because they have no skills to employ them with. 
These people are going to have a revolution of rising 
expectations, and, believe me, a revolution South 
Africa will get. 
Another problem will be the integration of the armed 
forces. 
QUESTION: Regarding your point that US forces 
should not be in Somalia, is that a reflection of what's 
happening now or would you never have sent them 
there in the first place? 
DR. DE BLIP I never would have sent them in the 
first place. I thought our job was to feed people. It 
could have been done from the air. It could have been 
done with the help of the agencies already there. I 
think our tactics in Somalia were wrong. Frankly, it is 
going exactly the way I though it would go. It is a 
quagmire, and it may, in fact, lead to a fragmented 
Somalia in the end, that is not what we had in mind. If 
feeding the population is the objective, it ought to be 
done from a distance. What is now happening�the 
policing action that you can see coming�builds 
resentment to the presence of a large foreign force and 
is not acceptable.

The Ethnic Challenge to National 
and International Order in South 
America, Mexico, and the Caribbean 
During the 1990s: Geographical 
Perspectives 
Gary S. Elbow 
Professor of Geography 
Texas Tech University 
Introduction 
As in so many other regions of the world, there is 
much ethnic diversity in Latin America and the Carib-
bean. In addition to the well-recognized Amerind, 
African, and Iberian elements, one finds representa-
tives of nearly all major European ethnic groups as 
well as many Middle Eastern and East and South 
Asian groups. In contrast to many other areas of the 
world, most of these ethnic populations are immi-
grants to the region who lack longstanding historic 
associations with New World territory but who have 
generally been well integrated into the national cul-
tures of the countries in which they reside. As such, 
most are not considered ethnic minorities but rather 
members of the national culture whose ancestors came 
from a non-Hispanic area. Two countries, Argentina 
and Peru, are currently governed by non-Hispanics, 
Carlos Saul Menem, a Syrian-Argentine, and Alberto 
Fujimori, a Japanese-Peruvian, respectively, and 
members of these and other non-Iberian immigrant 
groups are locally important in politics, business, or 
industry. For example, the Bucaram, Nebot, and Sand 
families are important in Guayaquil, Ecuador, as are 
various families of Syrian and Lebanese descent in 
San Pedro Sula, Honduras, and of Japanese descent in 
Brazil. 
In general, Latin America is less prone to ethnic con-
flict than many other regions of the world. Conflicts 
within the region are more often related to class differ-
ences, declining standards of living, and unequal 
distribution of access to resources, employment 
opportunities, or political power than they are to 
purely ethnic factors. For example, the guerrilla 
insurgencies of Sendero Luminoso and Tupac Amaru 
in Peru, the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua, the 
civil war in El Salvador, and recent outbreaks of vio-
lence in Venezuela are largely nonethnic conflicts. 
Although these conflicts may involve disaffected 
members of nonruling ethnic groups, the root causes 
of the violence lie more in nonethnic issues. Fre-
quently, ethnic groups are drawn unwillingly into 
political conflicts or are duped into participation by 
one side or the other, even though there is no explic-
itly "ethnic" agenda in the objectives of the opposing 
sides. Thus, the presence of minority ethnic groups on 
one side or the other of a Latin American political or 
armed conflict does not necessarily mean that it has its 
origin in ethnic issues. 
Although Latin America is not an area in which ethnic 
conflict is likely to escalate to a level of international 
importance on a par with, for example, the Middle 
East, Africa, or the Balkan states, considerable tension 
does exist among ethnic groups in South America, 
Mexico, and the Caribbean. There have been frequent 
ethnic conflicts in the past, and the potential for future 
conflict, either armed or through political action, 
exists in several parts of the region. The most active 
conflicts at present, and probably for the remainder 
of the decade and longer, are in areas of traditional 
Indian occupation and involve encounters between 
Indians and the state.' 
Indian Populations and the State 
The regional bases0f conflict between the Latin 
American states and their Indian populations may be 
divided conveniently into highland and lowland. In a 
I Indian is a very complex term as used in Latin America because it 
refers to cultural identity not biological characteristics. Thus. Indi-
ans are people who self-identify as Indians and who retain distinc-
tive characteristics of dress, language, economy, and beliefs that set 
them apart from the Hispanicized population of the country in 
which they reside. People who are born Indians may pass into the 
mestizo majority by learning Spanish, leaving their community of 
birth, and adopting other Hispanic cultural traits. This process has 
occurred since early colonial times and accounts for a large share 
of the mestizo population in many Latin American countries.

general sense, these two areas equate with the geo-
graphic concepts of core and periphery.2 
Highland Indians 
The highlands have been core areas since well before 
the Spanish conquest. Highland Indians are the mod-
ern descendants of the population of Indian states with 
relatively well-developed political organizations, such 
as the Aztec, Inca, and Maya who were the focus of 
Spanish colonization beginning in the 16th century. 
Spanish colonial interests focused their efforts in areas 
that possessed large numbers of Indians who were 
easily mobilized for employment in the mines and 
agricultural estates that supported the colonial econ-
omy. As a result of as much as 450 years of contact 
with and exposure to Hispanic culture, these Indians 
are heavily acculturated and have developed more or 
less stable relationships with the state and its represen-
tatives; nevertheless, they still retain strong Indian 
identity. In the highlands, clashes often center around 
a growing sense of "Indian consciousness," which is 
expressed in demands by Indian communities for the 
state to grant greater collective rights to political and 
economic self-determination. 
Core area Indians�often peasant farmers who work 
marginal lands�are very sensitive to change in the 
status of their land or in any subsidies or other benefits 
they may receive from the state. When these issues 
affect mestizo peasant farmers, and laborers, as they 
often do, Indians may unite across ethnic lines with 
them to defend their common interests. Core area 
Indians may unite with lowland Indians to promote 
ethnically related agendas such as the establishment of 
autonomous areas, bilingual education, or defense of 
Indian cultural heritage, as they have in Ecuador. 
Guerrilla movements have taken advantage of indige-
nous hostility to national governments by recruiting 
Indians to their cause. However, leftist guerrilla orga-
nizations are often steeped in Marxist theory, which 
2 The core-periphery concept has two distinct senses. Their early 
use was in reference to central, developed areas of a country in 
contrast to those places that lie outside of them and do not share the 
same levels of infrastructure development or other inputs from the 
national government. Recently, the terms core and periphery have 
been applied to international distinctions in economic develop-
ment, as between the "developed world" and the "underdeveloped 
world." In this paper the terms carry their earlier meaning. 
views ethnic issues as an extension of the class strug-
gle. For this reason guerrilla groups normally do not 
include ethnic concerns in their programs, which lim-
its their appeal to Indians. One recent example is 
Peru's Sendero Luminoso, which has Indian members 
and which recruits in Indian communities but has no 
explicitly ethnic elements in its revolutionary agenda 
and has been guilty of mistreating Indians who are not 
cooperative. It may be that Sendero Luminoso has 
driven as many or more Indians to support the Peru-
vian Army as it recruited. 
Where Indians make up a large share of the population 
they may work toward the establishment of regional 
or national political control. In Bolivia and Peru�
where they account for more than 50 percent and as 
much as 25 percent of the population, respectively3�
Indians represent a potentially crucial element in 
national politics if they can be induced to vote as a 
bloc. Moreover, they have the potential to create con-
flict if they are denied the right to vote or if their votes 
are negated by fraud and corruption. In Bolivia's 
recent presidential election one non-Indian candidate 
ran a "pro-Indian" campaign, and the winning vice-
presidential candidate was an Indian. 
If political gains are not translated into achievement of 
Indian agendas such as access to land, employment, 
and some level of self-determination, more violent 
forms of conflict are possible.' Exploitation and 
repression of highland Indians has triggered conflict in 
3 These estimates of Indian population fall at the high end of a wide 
range. Because the identification of Indians is somewhat subjec-
tive, national policies such as those which favor integration of Indi-
ans into the national culture may influence estimates of Indian 
population. Another factor is that increasing numbers of Indians 
adopt mestizo culture and cease to self-identify with their cultural 
origins. Furthermore, many Latin American countries do not col-
lect information on ethnic affiliation in their national censuses. 
Thus, estimates of the percentage of Indian population in Latin 
American countries varies greatly, depending on the source of the 
information. 
4 The case of Guatemala is especially instructive as an example of 
how Indian demands for greater participation in the economic and 
political life of a country may be met with a violent reaction from 
the state. For details of this process, see the articles contained in 
Robert M. Cannack, ed., Harvest of Violence: The Maya Indians 
and the Guatemalan Crisis, University of Oklahoma Press, 1988.

the past. Indians in Bolivia and Peru are likely to pro-
test any attempt to reduce coca production in that 
country if they are not matched with the development 
of an alternative source of comparable income. 
Because most pro'ducers in both countries are Indian 
and because coca production and consumption are so 
strongly linked to Indian culture, the issue of reducing 
production may be seen as one more effort on the part 
of the white-mestizo state to keep Indians from full 
participation in the national economy. Nevertheless, 
the immediate prospects for large-scale violent ethnic 
conflict do not seem great in the Andean countries. 
Lowland Indianf 
Lowland Indians unlike their highland counterparts, 
have been little influenced by European culture. Con-
tact between these indigenous groups and the state has 
been relatively recent. Most peripheral or lowland 
areas have been opened up for development�bring-
ing military, colonists, and developers into direct con-
frontation with their long-term Indian occupants�
only during the past half-century. 
The incorporation of peripheral territories, formerly 
considered empty and useless, into the effective 
national territory of the Amazon states�Brazil, Sufi= 
name, Guyana, Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, 
and Bolivia�has inevitably disrupted the cultures of 
the unacculturated or partially acculturated native 
inhabitants of the region. The unfortunate results of 
these contacts are well documented. They include: the 
spread of deadly diseases to highly susceptible popu-
lations, loss of land, forced acculturation to Western 
life styles, and incorporation into the cash-based econ-
omy. In addition, many Indians have been killed by 
the military, colonists, miners, and other intruders of 
their territory. In the 500 years since the arrival of  
Europeans in the Western Hemisphere, the number of 
Indians in the Amazon Basin has been reduced from 
an estimated 6-12 million to about 200,000. The pro-
cess has nearly reached its conclusion, since few, if 
any, refuges remain where native peoples can avoid 
contact with bearers of national culture. 
Despite the declining numbers of lowland Indians, 
contacts between them and outsiders have the potential 
to produce conflicts that can escalate to international 
levels. One excellent example is the August 1993 mur-
der of a number of Yanomami Indians by Brazilian 
miners in the Brazil-Venezuela frontier area.5 This 
incident had international implications for several rea-
sons. The Brazilian miners apparently attacked the 
Indians in Venezuelan territory, which makes the inci-
dent of interest to that state, and the Indians have close 
ties to cultural and environmental organizations in the 
United States and Europe as well as within Brazil, 
itself. Thus, the impact of this incident extended far 
beyond the rain forests of the upper Orinoco River, 
where it took place. It threatened to reinforce Brazil's 
already negative image as a country that permits or 
even promotes environmentally destructive develop-
ment, ignores or 'violates the boundaries of national 
parks and cultural or biological reserves, mistreats 
Indians, and has laws that favor concentration of 
wealth in the hands of a small elite while millions of 
poor barely survive in urban slums or on tiny farms. 
These conflicts between native peoples and the state in 
Latin America have parallels in other parts of the 
world, especially in Indonesia, Malaysia, Burma, 
Thailand, and the Philippines in Southeast Asia. In 
these countries logging, mineral exploitation, resettle-
ment programs, and land development have displaced 
or threaten to displace native populations with econo-
mies based on shifting agriculture or hunting and 
gathering. Some African ethnic conflicts have similar 
root causes, but longstanding disputes among ethnic 
groups are more often responsible for setting off 
hostilities. 
5 This incident illustrates the difficulty of preventing conflict 
between Indian groups and outsiders where valuable resources are 
at stake. The Indians live in isolated areas where both military and 
police protection is difficult to provide, even if the national govern-
ment wishes to provide it, which is not always the r.asP. And, 
because of certain taboos or customs of the Indians, it may be diffi-
cult for outsiders to assess exactly how serious a conflict may be. 
For example, the estimates of Yanomami killed in the August 1993 
raid ranged from 20 to 73, with the final number probably lying 
closer to the lower end of the range. The Yanomarni believe that 
mentioning the dead will bring back their spirits to haunt the living 
and their counting system does not extend beyond two; therefore, it 
is extremely difficult to get them to reveal basic numeric data on an 
incident such as the miners' raid.

Growing Indian Militancy 
One response by South American Indians to threats of 
territorial invasion has been to organize into political 
action groups. Indians have been aided in this effort 
by Roman Catholic missionaries, anthropologists, 
environmental organizations, and others. Noteworthy 
among these groups is the Federation of Shuar Cen-
ters (Federacion de Centros .Shuar) in Ecuador, which 
was organized in 1964 at a time when development 
was first penetrating the local Indians' territory. This 
group provides a model that has been followed by 
many other Amazon Indian groups within Ecuador 
and elsewhere. The Shuar Federation has allied with 
other Indian organizations representing both lowland 
and highland groups, and it also works with labor 
unions, peasant farmer leagues, and other non-Indian 
groups to advance common interests. 
The objectives of newly emerging Indian militancy 
have begun to extend beyond land, mineral, and biotic 
resource-related issues to broader policy areas. In 
Ecuador the Indian political action organizations are 
working hard to change the government policy of 
national integration aimed at eliminating ethnic dif-
ferences and creating a unified mestizo national cul-
ture. The policy, grounded in the assumption that 
eventually all Indian peoples will be brought into the 
mestizo-based national culture and that ethnic minori-
ties will cease to exist, is implemented through 
Spanish-language education, indoctrinating Indians 
in national history, and similar programs. The Indian 
organizations�which support the idea of a plurina-
tional or multinational state that would accommodate 
the various Indian ethnic groups, Afro-Ecuadorians 
from the Pacific Coast, and the dominant mestizo 
national culture�are working toward a plurinational 
state that would grant a degree of political and cul-
tural autonomy to Indian groups. Similar agendas 
exist in other Andean countries. For example, Peru 
recognizes Quechua as an official language, and Indi-
ans in Bolivia are increasing their influence on 
national government policy. 
In Ecuador and other Andean countries, Indian inter-
ests clash with a number of national goals, both stated 
and implicit. Thus fan differences over these conflict-
ing interests have generally been headed off by the 
national governments or resolved peacefully through 
the political process. However; as the Indian groups 
become more militant, they will demand to have an 
increasingly more active role in setting national policy 
with respect to land, resource use, and cultural preser-
vation. The militancy of Indian organizations clearly 
sets the stage for potential conflict with the non-Indian 
groups who perceive that their interests may be under-
mined by granting greater autonomy to Indians. 
Mexico's Indian Populations 
Mexico has a history of ethnic conflict that began in 
the pre-Columbian past and continues to the present. 
Indians have been involved in the great revolutions of 
Mexican history. They were recruited by Padre 
Hidalgo at the beginning of the revolution against 
Spain in 1811 and followed Emiliano Zapata during 
the Revolution of 1910-17. Indian rebellions include 
the Caste Wars of the 19th century in Yucatan and the 
Cristero rebellion of 1926 in Michoacan, Jalisco, and 
Colima. The land reforms that followed the Revolu-
tion of 1910, along with close control by the ruling 
political party, the Institutional Revolutionary Party 
(PRI), have limited Indian protests during the latter 
half of the century. However, conflicts continue to 
occur on a local level, and some have involved the 
national government. Most of these conflicts are in the 
southern part of the country or the Yucatan Peninsula, 
where most of the traditional Indian communities are 
located. 
As in South America, ethnic conflicts in Mexico have 
their roots in disputes over land, mineral resources, 
and cultural preservation policy. Despite the claim of 
the PRI to be a defender of the interests of the people, 
Indian concerns consistently take a back seat to 
89

Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
projects perceived to be of benefit to the government. 
Mexico's Indians are, at best, little better off economi-
cally than Indians in other Latin American countries, 
and they also encounter policies that promote adop-
tion of mestizo culture. Government-sponsored devel-
opment projects, expansion of the oil industry, 
relocation of mestizo settlers in Indian territories, and 
government ignorance of or attempts to suppress 
Indian culture are all factors that contribute to conflict 
between Indians and the state. 
Other sources of potential conflict include land dis-
putes between Indian communities and the presence 
of Guatemalan refugees. Most conflicts over land are 
highly localized and involve differences between 
neighboring towns over the boundaries of communal 
land holdings. Many of these disputes originated dur-
ing the colonial period. The migration of refugees 
from the Guatemalan civil war into the Mexican state 
of Chiapas and their relocation to settlements in 
Yucatan is also problematic. Although some of these 
refugees have returned to Guatemala in response to 
government repatriation programs, several thousand 
others will probably remain in Mexico. It remains to 
be seen what sort of long-term relationships these peo-
ple will work out with the Mexican Government and 
with neighboring Mexican Indian and mestizo com-
munities. 
The rebellion of the Zapatista National Liberation 
Army in January 1994 is an example of the influence 
of the factors noted above. Despite its rhetoric, the 
Mexican Government has done little to incorporate 
the Indians of Chiapas into the national economy. 
Land the Indians had traditionally considered to be 
theirs was claimed by mestizo farmers and ranchers 
and, in some cases, incorporated into large landhold-
ings. Resettlement of Guatemalan refugees contrib-
uted to conflict, as did the Salinas de Gortari 
government's decision to eliminate the constitutional 
protections of ej ido land. The final straw for the rebels 
was approval of the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, which was seen by the Indians as setting 
the stage for further concentration of economic 
resources in the more developed northern regions of 
the country at the expense of Indian and peasant farm-
ers in the south. 
Nonindigenous Flash Points: Afro-Americans/ 
East Indians 
In the African-influenced areas, especially parts of 
Brazil and the Caribbean, there is also potential for 
racial or ethnic conflict, especially if a black con-
sciousness movement should develop. The root causes 
of friction among members of African- and Asian-ori-
gin groups are quite different from those that involve 
American Indians and representatives of the Hispanic 
states. 
Brazil, the Guianas, and the West Indies have large 
Afro-American populations. In Brazil, African minor-
ities are not normally separated spatially from the 
main culture as are Indians. Rather, they live in the 
same cities and towns, and they usually share, to a 
greater or lesser extent, most elements of the common 
national culture. However, despite disclaimers about 
the absence of racial prejudice, clear differences exist 
in the social and economic attainment of blacks and 
whites in Brazil. So far, these differences have not 
resulted in racially based conflicts. Nevertheless, 
given the myth of racial equality, if a black conscious-
ness movement should emerge in Brazil, it could pro-
vide a base for development of racial friction�
although the potential for this to occur does not seem 
very great. 
In some islands Afro-Americans are a single, domi-
nant ethnic group; these areas have little potential for 
ethnic conflict. Suriname, Guyana, and Trinidad and 
Tobago have mixed populations comprised of Afro-
Americans, East Indians, and�in Suriname�
Javanese.6 Creoles�Afro-Americans and Mulat-
toes�and East Indians tend to belong to different 
political parties, to live in distinct areas, and to inter-
act largely within their own communities. In Trinidad 
and the Guianas, where Afro-Americans and East 
Indians share national territories, conflict reflects, to a 
'Despite their location on the mainland, Guyana and Suriname are 
culturally and historically much more closely linked to the Carib-
bean than they are to their culturally Iberian South American 
neighbors.

The Impact of Resource Development 
The expansion of national cultures from the core to 
peripheral areas is a direct product of the increased 
demand for land and resources, and this, in turn, often 
reflects national policies that govern the distribution 
of resources in the previously developed core areas. 
Colonization of the "empty" periphery often is viewed 
by national policymakers as away of relieving pres-
sure for redistribution of land in the older core, where 
a combination of concentration of land in the hands of 
the elite, rapid population increase in rural areas, 
degradation of peasant-controlled land through ero-
sion and declining fertility, awl lack of employment 
opportunities contributes to substantial land hunger. 
Moreover wealthy and influential members of the rul-
ing elites, along with members of the military or rep-
resentatives of international enterprises, often 
promote colonization as a means of obtaining large 
blocks of land. Mineral resource development, espe-
cially that related to high-value commodities such as 
oil and gold, is another cause of conflict. Frequently, 
mineral resource development is linked to multina-
tional enterprises such as oil companies or interna-
tional mining concerns. These developments may also 
have international links through organizations such as 
OPEC, the Latin American Free Trade Association, or 
the Andean Pact. 
Invariably, development of tropical lowland areas is 
seen as favorable to national and international inter-
ests, and maintenance of land in an "undeveloped" 
state is viewed as wasteful, even if it provides suste-
nance for native populations that have lived there for 
centuries or millennia. Conservation interests lobby for 
slow-growth or no-growth policies but to little avail. 
Even when areas are set aside in parks or reserves, 
effective provisions for protecting them are lacking, and 
the allocation of large blocks of land to Indian commu-
nities may create a backlash anwng landless or land 
hungry peasants and members of the urban working 
classes, who fail to understand the reasons for giving so 
much land to so few people. Often these protests are 
supported by members of the upper and middle classes 
who oppose the removal of large blocks of land from 
access for large-scale development. 
As might be expected, governments have not 
attempted to solve the "Indian problem" by dealing 
with the root causes that are noted above. Rather, they 
have responded to pressure groups by passing legisla-
tion that is unenforced or by buying off the groups or 
their leaders in other ways. Examples are minimalist 
land reform legislation or creation of largely unpro-
tected national parks, reserves, or dedicated Indian 
territories. If these time-tested Latin American strate-
gies fail to work, heavier-handed approaches may be 
attempted, such as calling in the army or police; but 
these strategies are resorted to less and less because 
of their negative consequences, both internally and on 
the country's international standing. Mexico's rela-
tively benign treatment of the Zapatista National Lib-
eration Army, at least until February 1995, is a good 
example of how international opinion can affect gov-
ernment response to dissident groups. 
In Brazil, the tendencies to expand development into 
the Amazon Basin have been stimulated by the gov-
ernment's expansionist development policies. Since 
colonial times Brazil has aggressively extended its 
political frontiers at the expense of all its neighbors. 
More recently, a national policy of building roads into 
the interior and clearing the tropical forest for farm-
ing and ranching, which was fostered in part by the 
geopolitical strategies of some military officers, has 
led to large-scale development of that country's Ama-
zon lands. When Brazil builds road and colonizes near 
its political frontiers, it triggers a counterresponse by 
neighboring Amazon Basin countries such as Peru, 
Colombia, and Venezuela, which build roads of their 
own and encourage colonization of formerly undevel-
oped lowland tropical forests to counter what is seen 
as a possible Brazilian threat to national sovereignty. 
Ecuador has embarked upon a similar policy of set-
tling its Amazon lowlands with highlanders in 
response to a longstanding border dispute with Peru. 
It remains to be seen how the flare-up of fighting in 
early 1995 will affect these policies.

certain extent, differences in urban settlement pat-
terns, although a more fundamental cause of conflict is 
over which group will control the national govern-
ment and gain the benefits that come from such con-
trol. Past Indians and Afro-Americans are roughly 
equally represented in Trinidad-43 percent Afro-
American, 40 percent East Indian. In Guyana the East 
Indians comprise 51 percent of the population and 
Creoles account for 44 percent; but, in Suriname, Cre-
oles make up only 31 percent of the population while 
East Indians, Javanese, and Bush Negro account for 
37 percent, 15 percent, and 10 percent, respectively. 
Relations among East Indians and Creoles have been 
particularly tense in Guyana, where politics has been 
characterized by violence and conflict between mem-
bers of political parties that are strongly linked to eth-
nic groups. Cheddi Jagan was elected President of 
Guyana in October 1992, ending more than 25 years 
of Creole domination of the government. The election 
was accompanied by riots and violent conflict among 
members of the two dominant political parties, but the 
situation seems to have stabilized since then. As long 
as Jagan remains in power, he may be able to limit 
ethnic conflict, especially if he is able to improve the 
country's depressed economic conditions and bring 
better lives to both Creoles and East Indians. How-
ever, unless he is able to establish institutions that 
break down longstanding ethnic differences, hostili-
ties may accompany the next election. 
Other areas that might bear watching include Suriname 
and the longstanding international dispute between 
Haiti and the Dominican Republic. In the latter, racial 
and cultural differences and a history of-conflict, com-
bined with Dominican concerns about migration of 
land-hungry Haitians, h-as led to repeated expulsions of 
Haitian migrants. However, Haitians have been wel-
corned at times when Dominican workers were unable 
to meet the need for agricultural labor in the country. If 
large numbers of Haitians try to settle in Dominican 
territory, there is always the possibility of another vio-
lent response on the part of the Dominicans. 
Conclusion 
Probably the most common source of ethnic conflict 
between Indians and the state, whether located in the 
lowlands or highlands, is the dispute over control of 
territory and mineral or biotic resources. Ethnic group 
autonomy and greater participation in the political 
system are often secondary factors in ethnic conflict. 
The principal areas of current ethnic conflict are in the 
Amazon Basin and other lowland areas where native 
Indian populations confront expanding national states. 
These conflicts involve small numbers of people, but 
they are locally important and may have international 
implications when they occur in border areas or if they 
involve international environmental or cultural protec-
tion organizations or political or lending organizations 
such as agencies of the UN, the World Bank, and the 
Interamerican Development Bank. Such local con-
flicts may cause problems for governments in the 
affected countries, and they will undoubtedly affect 
the course of natural resources development. 
Indian political action organizations are likely to 
become increasingly more powerful in national poli-
tics. They will receive help from international organi-
zations with whom they share common interests. To 
the extent that national governments accommodate the 
demands of these organizations, they may reduce eth-
nic tensions. If ethnic interests are ignored, conflicts 
are likely to develop, as in Mexico in 1994.

Summary of Discussion 
Discussant: Mac Chapin 
Although we all saw a good deal about Central Amer-
ica on television and in the newspapers during the 
1980s, interest in the region has been eclipsed in 
recent years by events in Eastern Europe, Russia, the 
Middle East, and so forth. Central America is a rela-
tively tiny area; it has less than 5 percent of the land 
surface of the United States and about one-tenth of its 
population. One of the big differences between this 
part of the world and the other regions that we have 
been discussing is that we are not going to find sepa-
ratist indigenous groups in Latin America. Certainly, 
in Central America, there are no Indian groups that are 
going to attack the central governments. 
I want to talk about the indigenous people who are, 
aside from a few isolated groups in Central America, 
virtually invisible. The region's indigenous peoples 
are located primarily in two regions, the Guatemalan 
highlands and the coastal regions adjacent the Carib-
bean Sea. Both locations are classic areas of refuge. 
Mayan Indians speaking 22 different languages 
inhabit the densely populated Guatemalan highlands. 
Numbering approximately 4.5 million people, they 
compose half the country's population and half the 
indigenous population of Central America. Virtually 
all the other Indians of the region are found stretched 
along the Caribbean coast between the southern por-
tion of Toledo district in Belize and Panama. 
At the time of the arrival of the Spaniards, most of the 
6 million Indians then living in Central America were 
located in population centers along the Pacific side of 
the region where there were much better soils, a more 
hospitable climate, and less rainfall. After the Span-
iards arrived, approximately 80 percent of the popula-
tion was killed off largely through diseases; 
demographically, the Indians are just now starting to 
recover. 
Many of the region's Indian populations, who were 
not either assimilated or exterminated, moved to areas 
where the Spanish had no interest. Some groups 
moved to the highlands of Guatemala�where they 
did not even send priests for several centuries�and 
others migrated toward the Atlantic coast jungles. 
The region has three countries of some importance 
from an ethnic standpoint: Guatemala, El Salvador, 
and Nicaragua. The largest concentrations of Indians 
in Latin America are found in the Guatemalan high-
lands. The hatred between the country's Latinos and 
Mayan Indians is palpable. This intense ethnic hatred, 
which has grown over time, was most recently mani-
fested in the extremely bloody civil war that reached 
intensity in the mid-1970s and that lasted until about 
1983. Dt7fring that period 100,000 Indians were killed. 
Scorched earth policies were practiced by a number of 
Guatemalan leaders. It was a war of extermination. 
The Guatemalan Government used the military 
against the ethnic population. 
The situation in El Salvador is similar to that in Guate-
mala. El Salvador currently has an Indian population 
of about 500,000. Over the centuries, there have been 
a series of attempts to eliminate the Indian popula-
tions. In the 1880s the last communal territories were 
abolished by decree and the Indians were displaced. 
The last ethnic war in El Salvador was in 1932 when, 
within the space of about a week, the military 
marched out and killed about 35,000 Indians. It con-
sciously searched out people who were dressed like 
Indians, who looked like Indians, and who spoke an 
Indian language. There have been no ethnic conflicts 
in El Salvador since that time. The conflict has really 
shifted; the rural poor have become the surrogates for 
the ethnic population. An extension of the same battle, 
it is essentially over land and resources. During the 
1980s the target was principally peasants�in contrast 
to the Indians, who were organized. 
During the Nicaraguan civil war, the Mosquito Indi-
ans who inhabit the Atlantic coast region with its for-
estry and offshore marine resources were forcibly 
relocated. Since the end of the war they have returned 
to their homes but have been in the middle of attempts 
by multinationals to cut down the coastal forests.

I would like to reiterate a point that Professor Elbow 
made, which is that virtually all the conflicts today in 
Central America and also in South America are over 
land and resources. Indian populations inhabit rich 
forested areas, and there is a push�not necessarily by 
the state but often by a combination of corrupt and 
greedy government officials, landless peasants, and 
multinationals�to resettle the Indians and to take 
resources away from them. 
In Central America the problem areas will be the low-
lands. An examination of the remaining forestry 
resources of the region shows the correspondence 
between the forests and the lands currently inhabited 
by the region's Indian populations. Although there are 
incipient indigenous group organizations throughout 
the areas, they are not strong enough to present any 
real opposition to outside forces. These organizations 
will need to be nurtured if they are going to be helpful 
in protecting the region's remaining natural endow-
ment. 
General Discussion 
QUESTION: Would either of you like to comment on 
the possibility of racial strife in Cuba? 
MR. CHAPIN: I don't think that's an issue. 
DR. ELBOW: Most of the whites are living in Miami. 
What's left, from my understanding, is a fairly pre-
dominantly mulatto and black population. 
QUESTION: Would either or both speakers comment 
further on the role of nonstate actors such as NGOs 
and industry in conflicts in the region? I'm thinking in 
particular of attempts to develop oil in Ecuador. 
DR. ELBOW: Yes, I am quite familiar with the case of 
Ecuador. Both industry�in particular, but not exclu-
sively, the oil industry�and NGOs are active. They are 
engaged in a sort of holy war, if you want to think of it 
that way, over the Amazon. The NGOs are trying to 
preserve what's left of the resources, and the oil compa-
nies and the government are attempting to mine them. 
Ecuador has, according to the latest reports, something 
on the order of about 20 years worth of oil left, and, 
as far as I can determine, industry and government are 
trying to get it out in 15 years. The government has 
allowed the oil companies to move into areas that are 
supposedly reserved for Indians and are not supposed 
to be exploited. The oil companies can pretty much go 
wherever they want to. Now, because of bad press, the 
government and the oil companies as well have had to 
do a little bit to clean up their act. So pollution has per-
haps been reduced, but the real problem is that where 
oil companies go, others follow. The development of 
roads by the oil companies has led to the opening up of 
the region to colonization. When oil companies clear a 
little stretch of road that is 10 meters or more wide, the 
colonists come in and take out the rest. 
MR. CHAPlN: Initially, when the oil development 
started down in the Amazon area, CONOCO and an 
Indian group was involved. Then the National 
Resources Defense Counsel and others became 
engaged. The theory behind the outside involvement 
was that negative publicity would pressure CONOCO 
to act responsibly. A lot of NGOs then got involved, 
Indian groups protested CONOCO actions, and 
CONOCO pulled out. When CONOCO left, a number 
of small wildcat groups, who could not be pressured 
on anything, went in and started taking it over. So that 
is the current situation. 
QUESTION: The UN working group on the rights of 
indigenous people has been developing a declaration 
that will eventually work its way up in the UN system. 
This declaration addresses the issue of rights and con-
trol of resources by indigenous peoples. Do you see 
much of a chance for this declaration being passed by 
the UN, and, if so, how would that impact upon the 
relationship between indigenous peoples and the 
state? Would it tend to lessen friction or increase it? 
MR. CHAPIN: I don't think it will have much effect 
at all simply because any resolution passed by the 
UN has no legal status in any of these countries. If 
97 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
anything, it antagonizes the government. Most of 
these governments have laws that any subsurface min-
erals belong to the state. 
DR. WIXMAN: In the former Soviet Union, there is a 
very interesting movement that I think parallels some-
thing happening in the United States in the environ-
mental movement. The preservation of indigenous 
people, such as the native American and, in the case of 
the former Soviet Union, the native Siberian, are por-
trayed as synonymous with the preservation of the 
natural environments. Indigenous people who no one 
had ever heard of or cared about have become a politi-
cal symbol. Do you see a movement of this type tak-
ing place in Latin America among any of the young 
people in which the survival of a particular indigenous 
group symbolizes either the survival of the country as 
a whole or of its environment? Are there young Cen-
tral Americans, let us say among students in universi-
ties, that are beginning to hold up the Indian as the 
symbol of the preservation? 
MR. CHAPIN: Yes, especially in Mexico but also in 
other places to some extent. 
DR. ELBOW: It is occurring in Ecuador. One of the 
things that I think is an interesting, unexplored topic, 
is what causes a green movement to develop in certain 
countries and not in others. Why Costa Rica? Why 
now an emerging green movement in Ecuador, for 
example? 
QUESTION: Professor Elbow, you had mentioned, in 
general, that there was not much in the way of evi-
dence for the ethnic conflict in South American. You 
touched on two countries, Suriname and Trinidad and 
Tobago, where there are mixtures of ethnic groups and 
a lot of conflicts. The Trinidadian press is quite con-
cerned with the general upswing in violence. Is it your 
impression that this is due largely to this ethnic inter-
action or to the economic downturn, or is it a combi-
nation of both? 
DR. ELBOW: I suspect it's a combination of both. 
Trinidad had, 10 years ago, the highest per capita 
income in Latin America. In addition, local political 
parties have been built essentially upon an ethnic base. 
Ethnicity is used, or perhaps exploited, as a political 
tool. That is also true in Guyana. 
QUESTION: What are the sources of support for 
reform in Central and South America? 
DR. ELBOW: That is a difficult question. To the 
extent that reform is taking place, it comes from a 
combination of groups and institutions. In the Guate-
malan case, it has been a cooperative movement with 
inputs from the Catholic Church, the Peace Corps, and 
NG0s. Benefits from these efforts include: leadership 
training, education, the breaking down of linguistic 
barriers so that the Indians can communicate with 
each other in Spanish, and the development of Indian 
self-awareness and a sense of Pan-Indian identity. 
Ironically, often, it is when it looks like the Indians are 
going to begin to have some political power and to 
make some impact, that the tendency for a backlash 
begins. In some cases the army has stepped in and 
countered the development. If you look at Ecuador, 
you can see this sort of scenario developing. In 1991 
the Indians had a big sit-in in the National Cathedral. 
In 1992 they had demonstrations against the 500th 
anniversary of Columbus's landing. Ecuador is not 
Guatemala, however. It does not have the same history 
of-violence that Guatemala has, but I could still imag-
ine the government getting to the point where it feels 
so squeezed that the military steps in and says it has 
had enough.

Ethnicity and Nationality in the 
Middle East 
Marvin W. Mikesell 
Professor of Geography 
University of Chicago 
The Middle East, with its immense petroleum reserves 
and unique role as a crossroads between Europe, Asia, 
and Africa, is a region of manifest global importance. 
It is also a region of inherent instability. Tension, if 
not open conflict, between states and among groups 
within states is a persisting reality. Add extreme dis-
parity between wealth and poverty, numerous disputed 
boundaries, the problems created by frustrated Pales-
tinian and Kurdish political-territorial aspirations, the 
spreading influence of Islamic fundamentalism, and 
the prevalence of nondemocratic governments and it 
is no wonder that the Middle East is perceived univer-
sally to be a region of contention and danger. 
The Mirage of Arab Unity 
It is ironic that a region blessed with a high degree of 
cultural unity should exhibit so much evidence of dis-
cord. Arabic is the official language of no less than 
18 countries: Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, 
Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, 
Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, 
United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Moreover, with 
the exception of Bahrain, Iraq, and Lebanon, Sunni 
Muslims are the majority religious group in each of 
these countries. This remarkable degree of linguistic 
and religious commonality might have inspired a per-
vasive feeling of unity. In fact, the 18 Arab countries 
have seldom been able to function as a geopolitical 
bloc, and rivalry among prospective Pan-Arab leaders 
has produced and doubtless will continue to produce 
tension in the region. 
Attempts to merge various of the Arab states�for 
example, Egypt and Syria in the United Arab Republic 
during 1958-61�have been sporadic and ephemeral. 
Nor has any of the great cities of the region�Cairo, 
Damascus, and Baghdad�been able to function as a 
Pan-Arab capital. Why there,are 18 Arab countries 
rather than one continues to be a perplexing question 
for the people and contending monarchs and dictators 
of the region. At the end of the Cold War�as was the 
case at the end of the two world wars�most of the 
countries of the Arab realm are anachronistic and, for 
the most part, are arbitrary units of former empires. 
Nevertheless, jealousy or suspicion of neighboring 
states plus the ambition of state leaders has fostered 
keen feelings of nationalism even in countries that had 
only provincial or mandate status before their inde-
pendence. 
"Turkistan" 
A similar perplexing question must now be posed in 
regard to Pan-Turkish aspirations. Before the breakup 
of the USSR, the world had only one Turkish state�
or two if we include the dubious "Turkish Republic of 
Northern Cyprus." With the independence of the 
former Soviet Republics of Azerbaijan, Turkmenistan, 
Kazakstan, ICirgizstan, and Uzbekistan, there are five 
additional ones. To date, concern about the character 
of this enlarged realm and indeed of a "Turkistan" that 
might include other Turkish-speaking peoples has 
centered on practical issues such as what alphabet 
should be used, economic reforms, and the efficacy of 
secular or religious forms of government. The present 
and potential influence of Russia, Turkey, Iran, 
Afghanistan, and China in this vast area has invited 
considerable speculation. It is possible that develop-
ments in "Turkistan" will be influenced by more spe-
cific ethnic interests. For example, it is easy to 
imagine Azeri-speakers from Iran serving as volun-
teers in the war between Azerbaijan and Armenia. 
Conflict in Persian-speaking Tajildstan has already 
encouraged participation by the well-armed Tajiks of 
northern Afghanistan. Conflict elsewhere in Central 
Asia could encourage participation by Turkmen from 
Iran and Kazakhs and Uzbeks from Afghanistan or 
even from China. The fact that the Turkish- and Per-
sian-speaking countries of the former Soviet Union all 
have substantial minority groups complicates the pic-
ture considerably. From an American or European 
perspective, Turkey's aspiration to be a Western-ori-
ented role model for Central Asia has obvious appeal. 
99 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
It must be remembered that this aspiration derives 
from awareness of linguistic affiliation rather than any 
realistic assessment of Turkey's political influence or 
economic power. 
"Nations" in the Middle Eastern Context 
"Nation-states," although often alluded to, are rarely 
found in the modern world. Perhaps only Iceland can 
be regarded as a perfect example. In the Middle East, 
Tunisia (minus its several communities of Berber 
speakers) is an approximate example. Most Middle 
Eastern countries include more than one linguistic or 
religious group and so can be described as multina-
tional states. For example: 
� Syria has Kurdish and other non-Arab ethnic minor-
ities, and�besides its Sunni Muslim majority�has 
significant Christian, Druze, and Alawite religious 
groups. 
� Iran has both Shia and Sunni Muslims and a number 
of non-Persian linguistic groups, including Azeri, 
Arabs, Kurds, Baluchi, Luri, Basseri, Balchtiari, and 
Turkmen. 
� Lebanon has six major religious groups�Maronite, 
Greek Catholic, and Greek Orthodox Christians; 
Sunni and Shia Muslims; and Druze. 
� Egypt has a large population (about 10 million) of 
Coptic Christians. 
� Turkey has several million Kurds and many smaller 
minority groups, including Arabs, Laz, Greeks, 
Tatars, and Circassians. 
The idea that the Arabic or Turlcish languages might 
be the basis of a multistate nation has already been 
alluded to and dismissed as having only tentative or 
hypothetical meaning. "Arabistan" and "Turkistan" 
are debatable concepts rather than geopolitical reali-
ties. The same can probably be said of the idea of a 
"multistate nation of Islam." More important in the 
context of the Middle East are nonstate nations, of 
which Palestine and Kurdistan are the most conspicu-
ous examples. Finally, the linguistic complexity of 
Afghanistan and the religious complexity of Lebanon 
are so striking that these countries might be described 
as nonnation states. 
Significant Minorities 
In addition to the major groupings that create the 
impression of a three-part linguistic division (Arabic, 
Turkish, Persian) or a two-part religious division 
(Sunni and Shia Islam), the Middle East has numerous 
minority groups, and some of these have political 
agenda that are in conflict with national policies. The 
tension between substate identity and national affilia-
tion, evident in most of the world, has several clear 
manifestations in the Middle East. 
Minority�or otherwise unempowered�groups that 
have expressed separatist ideals or at least a desire for 
an enhanced degree of national recognition include 
Uzbeks and Tajiks in Afghanistan; Baluchi in Iran; 
Shiites in Iraq and Lebanon; Christians in Egypt, 
Syria, and Iraq; and Arabs in Israel and Israeli-occu-
pied territory. Each of these groups has aspirations 
that are in conflict with policies formulated by ruling 
groups in the respective countries. The region's most 
serious conflict along these lines is in southern Sudan 
where Arab or Arabized Muslims have been fighting 
linguistically diverse Christians and animists for sev-
eral decades. 
The largest minority group within the Arabic realm is 
not politically significant. About 40 percent of the 
people or Morocco and about 20 percent of the people 
of Algeria speak Berber rather than or in addition to 
Arabic. However, the scattered distribution of these 
people, mainly in mountain areas, the numerous dia-
lects they speak, and the lack of any written or stan-
dardized form of their language have precluded the 
development of any separatist movement among Ber-
bers. 
Some other minority groups are too weak numerically 
to pose a threat to national authorities or compel rec-
ognition of their linguistic or religious identity. The 
Assyrians (Aramaic-speaking Christians) of northern 
100 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Iraq exemplify this situation, in spite of claims made 
on behalf of autonomy for them by Assyrian immi-
grant groups in the United States. Nor have the Arabs 
of southeastern Turkey or in the Khuzistan Province 
of Iran posed a serious threat to Turkish or Iranian 
authority. Indeed, when the Iraqis invaded Iran in 
1980 they expected the Arabic-speakers of Khuzistan 
to welcome liberation from Irinian rule. Instead, as 
Shiites, the Arabs in this part of Iran had good reason 
to see benefit in the rule of Ayatollah Khomeini and 
danger for them in the Sunni or secular bias of the 
government of Saddam Husayn. The same religious 
bond explains why the Azeri of northern Iran rejected 
the prospect of merger with the neighboring Soviet 
Republic of Azerbaijan during World War II. 
The Problem of Kurdistan 
Estimates of the number of Kurds vary widely, from 
less than 15 million to more than 30 million. In the 
negotiations that accompanied the division of the 
Ottoman Empire after World War I, various prospects 
were suggested for the Kurds, ranging from local 
autonomy to independence. In fact, they became a 
shadow nation in northwestern Iran, northern Iraq, and 
southeastern Turkey. During World War II, when 
Soviet troops occupied northern Iran, Kurds enjoyed 
some autonomy and, under the Mahabad Republic of 
1946, even a brief period of nominal independence. In 
1974, after several years of civil war, Kurds in north-
ern Iraq were granted a high degree of autonomy, 
including recognition of the coequal status of Kurdish 
and Arabic as official languages of the region. Most of 
the provisions of this agreement were never imple-
mented, and Kurdish autonomy became a dead issue 
when the Iran-Iraq war began in 1980. In Turkey, 
Kurds, often called "Mountain Turks," have sought to 
achieve recognition and hen0 to resist assimilation. 
Kurdish nationalism in Turkey developed in response 
to denial of such recognition and the enforcement of 
laws inspired by Article 57 of the Turkish constitu-
tion, which forbids "activities that aim at destroying 
the ethnic unity of the Turkish people." In response to 
the Gulf war and some pressure from the European 
Community, the Turkish Government is now enter-
taining thoughts of at least qualified recognition of the 
Kurdish people and the lifting of some of the restric-
tions on the use of the Kurdish language. 
Kurds have adopted different strategies for promotion 
of their cause, depending on opportunities available in 
the countries where they reside. They have seldom 
expressed enthusiasm for the benefits of Iranian, Iraqi, 
or Turkish citizenship. It is Kurdish citizenship that 
they desire or at least autonomy as a transitional stage 
en route to independence. The frustration of Kurdish 
nationalism has been a consequence of its collision 
with Iranian, Iraqi, and Turkish nationalism. The loca-
tion of the Kirkuk oilfield in northern Iraq is an addi-
tional complication. Kurdish successional aims in Iraq 
have been supported by Iran and, to a lesser extent, by 
Turkey, while Kurdish nationalism in both these coun-
tries has been suppressed. Because assimilation is 
rejected by Kurdish leaders, Kurdistan is and doubt-
less will remain a nonstate nation. 
Kurdish nationalism is an even more intractable prob-
lem than Palestinian nationalism. Although the latter 
problem has a large international dimension, it relates 
essentially to the relationship between two nonassimi-
lable peoples: Arabs and Jews. The nonstate status of 
Kurdistan derives from a more complicated relation-
ship among Kurds and Arabs, Turks, and Iranians. In 
each case they have been or can be regarded as candi-
dates for absorption. Although autonomy may be a 
realizable aspiration, independence within a territory 
relinquished by three states is difficult to imagine. 
Kurdistan is best described, therefore, as a cultural 
geographic reality that happens coincidentally to be a 
political geographic impossibility. 
101 
Lebanon in Retrospect 
The disastrous conflict in Lebanon offers a useful 
focus for examination of the circumstances that can 
transform instability, present in many Middle Eastern 
countries, into warfare. For three decades Lebanon 
seemed to be functioning not only is a plural society 
but, more remarkably, also as the world's only plural-
istic theocracy. We now know that it was only an 
unsuccessful experiment. 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Lebanon was created by the French as a homeland for 
Christian Arabs, especially the Maronites. The French 
began to treat the Maronites as proteges early in the 
19th century when Paris was competing with London 
for economic and political influence in the Middle 
East. In 1860 the French intervened militarily to pro-
tect their clients during a Muslim-Christian civil war. 
After that intervention the Maronite area enjoyed priv-
ileged status as an autonomous province of the Otto-
man Empire. The dismemberment of the Empire after 
World War I permitted the French to exercise direct 
control over this district and also over the much larger 
adjacent territory of Syria. The French desire to create 
a state for their Christian proteges posed an interesting 
dilemma. The territory occupied predominantly by 
Maronites (roughly the northwestern quarter of mod-
ern Lebanon) would have been too small to be an 
effective state. Therefore, they added land from their 
Syrian mandate and announced the birth of a "Greater 
Lebanon," three times the size of the Maronite area. 
This larger territory included a substantial number of 
Sunni and Shia Muslims, non-Maronite Christians, 
and Druze. 
A French-sponsored census of 1932 suggested that 
Christians formed a slight majority of the population 
of Greater Lebanon and that Maronites, with about 
30 percent of the total, were the largest specific group. 
This was Lebanon's only formal census, and a vast 
array of subsequent problems can be traced to doubts 
about its accuracy. Suggestions that a new census 
should be made were checked by insistence that 
Maronites and other Christians "temporarily living 
abroad" should also be counted. Because the number 
of Christian Lebanese abroad could be ascertained 
only by those remaining in Lebanon, that prospect was 
never accepted by Muslims. The absence of believable 
data on the size of religious groups in a country where 
citizenship was defined by religion and political 
power, and even minor government positions, were 
allocated on the basis of religious affiliation inhibited 
the development of any collective sense of national 
identity. 
The list of problems inspired by the census contro-
versy is long and melancholy. For example, the ten-
dency of each religious group to try to get more than 
its dubious "official" share of government largess 
encouraged persistent tension. Moreover, because the 
Lebanese who found employment abroad and sent 
remittances from abroad were almost exclusively 
Christians, the country soon developed a pattern of 
extreme disparity in standards of living. The deeply 
rural Shia areas of southwestern and northeastern Leb-
anon were conspicuously backward. Even in the more 
prosperous Christian districts, democracy was com-
promised by nepotism and the inability of elected 
leaders to think of national rather than sectarian inter-
ests. 
If Lebanon had been able to remain aloof from the 
Arab-Israeli conflict, its tensions and ambiguities 
might have been countered by faith that the country 
was somehow better off than its neighbors. When Pal-
estinian refugees acquired sufficient strength in Leba-
non to wage their battle from Lebanon, the tottering 
Humpty Dumpty created by the French could not 
remain on the wall. The reason why the country disin-
tegrated so rapidly can be explained not only by its 
inherent cultural problems but also by the ineffective-
ness of the small national army, which consisted 
mainly of Christian officers and Muslim enlisted men. 
Caught in the crossfire of Palestinians already in Leb-
anon, Israelis who felt free to attack them anywhere in 
Lebanon, and Syrian "deterrent" forces that occupied 
the eastern half-of Lebanon, it is no wonder that the 
Lebanese Army went AWOL. With its departure the 
Lebanese Government, no longer able to protect its 
citizens, could not prevent the proliferation of divisive 
militias and the beginning of a civil war�immensely 
complicated by foreign interventions�that led to the 
de facto partition of Lebanon into areas controlled by 
Maronites, Shiites, Syrians, Israelis, and Palestinians. 
The Middle East in the Coming Decade 
Scholars devoted to the Middle East have often been 
able to offer convincing retrospective explanations of 
developments in this complex and troubled region. 
Examples of-successful prediction are more difficult 
to find. Within the past two decades, surprising events, 
such as the collapse of the regime of the Shah, the 
102

subsequent revolutionary rule of Ayatollah Khomeini, 
the assassination of Anwar Sadat, and the Iraqi inva-
sion of Kuwait, have had a profound effect on the 
entire region. Uncertainty isa certainty in Middle 
Eastern studies. This a priori generalization is sus-
tained by another equally obvious generalization. 
Each of the dictators and monarchs is mortal, and we 
can only speculate on what their departure might 
mean for the region. Taking account of the many dis-
puted boundaries in the region (for example, Iraq-Iran, 
Israel-Syria, Libya-Chad, Morocco-Algeria) invites 
additional speculation. 
The diffusion within the regidn of various expressions 
of Islamic fundamentalism is a cause of further and 
more serious uncertainty. Islamic fundamentalism can 
result in persecution of heterodox Muslim groups, 
such as the Druze, Alawites, Yezidis, and Bahais, and 
can exacerbate the tension between Sunni and Shia 
Muslims and among Muslims who might be labeled 
variously as worldly or other-worldly, pro-Western or 
anti-Western, and moderate orradical. At present, Iran 
is the principal exporter and coordinator of move-
ments designed to subvert and eventually supplant 
secular authority. This movement has crossed the 
region's Sunni-Shia faultline, now presents a serious 
threat to the Governments of Egypt and Algeria, and 
is a potential threat elsewhere. Even Turkey, officially 
secular since the time of Ataturk, has experienced 
unrest inspired by Islamic zealots. Because it is mili-
tary rather than civil authority that is most likely to be 
effective in blocking revolutionary religious move-
ments, Islamic fundamentalism acts both directly and 
indirectly in the frustration or delay of democratic 
development in the region. The thinly disguised Army 
coup of January 1993 in Algeria is a good illustration 
of this principle. 
In spite of this recitation of circumstances that make 
prediction hazardous in the Middle East, it is possible 
to point to some happy and unhappy constants regard-
ing minority groups. For example, it is safe to assume 
that the Arabization of the Berber areas of North 
Africa will continue without interruption. As a result 
of improvements in communication and education, 
mountain and desert peoples who now speak only 
Berber will become bilingual and eventually speak 
103 
only Arabic. This process of gradual, voluntary assim-
ilation should also result in the Arabization of the 
speakers of several languages in the Sahelian zone. On 
the other hand, some numerically small groups, 
defined by either language or religion, may avoid or 
be able to resist assimilation, especially if they have 
low national visibility. The non-Iranian linguistic 
groups in the Zagros Mountains may exemplify this 
prospect. Christians will doubtless survive and even 
prosper in countries that are able to resist the pressures 
of Islamic fundamentalism. Lebanon, Syria, and pos-
sibly Iraq could exemplify this prospect. The alterna-
tive situation, in which non-Muslims are threatened, 
would occur inevitably in any country that is captured 
by Islamic fundamentalists. 
Finally, it is probably safe to assume that the problem 
of Palestine is not likely to be solved completely 
within the coming decade. The various ideas that have 
been entertained for solution of the Israeli-Palestinian 
problem seem without exception to have inherent con-
tradictions. Trading land for peace presupposes Israeli 
willingness to trade enough land to satisfy Palestinian 
aspirations. This unrealistic formula also presupposes 
that Jewish settlers in potential Palestinian territory 
could be persuaded to leave. Again, Palestinians may 
be willing to accept autonomy rather than indepen-
dence, but only if this is a transitional rather than a 
permanent arrangement. Thoughts of a Palestinian-
Jordanian confederation are also being entertained, 
but this prospect merely defers questions about the 
character and area of the Palestinian part of the union. 
Because it is not likely that Arabs will ever be able to 
live contentedly in a Jewish state or Jews in an Arab 
state and no realistic proposal has been advanced that 
could result in the separation of the two peoples, the 
Arab-Israeli problem probably will be with us for 
many years. 
The problem of Kurdistan also seems to be intractable 
and so can be regarded as a constant in the Middle 
Eastern cultural-political equation. If the area now 
occupied by Kurds were to become an independent 
state, it would be no less viable than many of the 
existing states in the region. It would have abundant 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
land suitable for cereal farming and horticulture, a rich 
petroleum field, several cities, and a population of 
15-30 million. None of these observations distracts 
attention from a reality that precludes any prospect for 
the creation of an independent Kurdistan because a 
Kurdish state could come into being only if Iraq, Tur-
key, and Iran were to display unprecedented coopera-
tion and generosity. 
These speculative remarks reinforce a comment made 
at the beginning of this review: the Middle East is and 
will continue to be an area of contention and danger. 
As the only superpower and, indeed, the only external 
power capable of influencing events in the region, the 
United States has an unavoidable responsibility. At the 
least, we might hope that our experience since 1776 
could be a source of illumination for those Middle 
104 
Easterners�the vast majority of them�who have 
never known democracy. Other hopes can be enter-
tained. By encouraging government reforms, discour-
aging excessive military expenditures, exposing 
human rights abuses, seeking by diplomatic means to 
promote peaceful settlement of border disputes, and 
organizing boycotts when such are required to prevent 
or punish reckless national behavior, the United States 
could expect to play a constructive role in the Middle 
Fast. We also need to recognize that the United States 
has been, and will continue to be, viewed with suspi-
cion and even contempt as a new colonial power, well 
aware of the natural resources and strategic position of 
the region but incapable of understanding the aspira-
tions and frustrations of its "difficult people."

Summary of Discussion 
Discussant: Mildred Berman 
In contrast to some areas we have talked about, the 
Middle East is relatively small in terms of total popu-
lation. It contains some 300 million people�only 
about 6 percent of the world's population�although it 
certainly takes up a disproportionate share of the 
headlines. 
This is an area with a long cultural history. Three of 
the world's most influential religions have come from 
here. It has been an area of the 'first domestication of 
crops, first settlement, first cities, and so on. 
In addition, this is a place through which tribes as well 
as empires have moved, changed, and reinvented 
themselves. This means, then, that the areal extent of 
the region keeps shifting like the sands. We have 
heard the area called the Near East, the Hither East, 
and Southwest Asia. The terms Near East and Hither 
East included the Balkans because they were part of 
the Ottoman Empire. Today, the term Middle East is 
common, but during World War II the Middle East 
Command went as far south as Kenya. 
One of the terms that geographers and anthropologists 
use when discussing this region is "mosaic." It is a 
very poetic term and appropriate because of the won-
derful mosaic floors left by the Romans and the 
mosaic work on the mosques throughout much of the 
area. But a mosaic implies symmetry, and, as you have 
just heard from Professor Mikesell, the intense variety 
of people here is not very symmetrical. In talking 
about mosaics, I recently read something very inter-
esting. After Jerusalem was retaken by the Saracens 
under Saladin in the 12th century, many tiles of the 
Dome of the Rock had to be replaced because they 
had begun to fall off. The people who put the tiles 
back were not Muslim artisans, but Armenian Chris-
tians; one of the great monuments in the Muslim 
world was repaired by laborers from another religion. 
I would like to comment on two of the issues that Pro-
fessor Mikesell addressed: the Kurdish situation and 
Lebanon. 
The outlook for Kurds achieving a state is grim. Pro-
fessor Mikesell says it is impossible, and maybe it is. 
But in this region we can never say never, as evi-
denced by the recent gasp-provoking handshake 
between PLO Chief Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister 
Rabin on the lawn of the White House. In the past, 
some outside assistance has gone to the Kurds in an 
effort to destabilize the regime in Iraq. During the 
1970s, for instance, Israel and the United States sent 
in arms to shore up the Kurdish cause, but, as we all 
know, this did not work. Since the Persian Gulf war, 
there has been a fair amount of pressure brought to 
bear on Turkey in the hope that it might promote some 
Kurdish autonomy in the area, but this does not seem 
to be working. The tragedy is that, with so many other 
things going on in this part of the world, the Kurdish 
cause is definitely on the back burner. 
Regarding Lebanon, that country�a very unsuccess-
ful experiment as Professor Mikesell has so rightly 
described�was programmed for failure from the 
beginning. The separation of Lebanon from Syria 
overlooked the fact that members of the country's 
17 individual sects had loyalties not only to their reli-
gious groups but also to tribes and villages as well. 
This has continued until the present time. Lebanon 
then has had no real political control over its many 
peoples. 
The country began to unravel in the 1970s with the 
establishment of individual fiefdoms and, again, with 
the PLO ministate, which was destroyed by the 1982 
incursion of the Israel Defense Forces. Today, the 
infrastructure in Beirut and Southern Lebanon is in 
shambles. It is uncertain whether the country will ever 
reemerge as a banking center, tourist attraction, or an 
air transport hub. 
The Syrian Army presence remains a real danger; 
there are 40,000 Syrian troops in the country, and they 
show no sign of moving. The Christians are very 
much concerned about what may happen if the Syri-
ans move to annex Lebanon. They fear that this will 
be bad for them, and many Muslims in the area also 
fear the repressiveness of the Syrian regime.

Finally, the major concern the Lebanese currently 
have is the 300,000 Palestinian refugees who are in 
the southern part of their country. They would like to 
see them moved out. This is another of the destabiliz-
ing aspects of the human geography of the Middle 
East. 
General Discussion 
QUESTION: I'd like to focus the Kurdish question on 
Turkey. What do you think the prospects are for 
Turks�who seem adamantly opposed to any kind of 
acknowledgment of the Kurds at all�to ever try to 
solve the Kurdish problem politically or socially 
rather than just militarily? Is this insurgency ever 
going to end? 
DR. MIICESELL: The recent statements from Prime 
Minister Ciller simply reinforce what has been said 
before. When asked about this, she said, "Why is there 
a problem? The Kurds have the same rights as all 
other Turkish citizens." In other words, the Turks are 
quite emphatic in the idea that, although they recog-
nize they have minorities, they cannot have minority 
citizenship. 
There is a Kurdish party represented in the parliament 
in Ankara. When the delegates arrived and wanted to 
use the Kurdish language, however, they were accused 
of treason and violation of law, 
107 
The Turks see themselves as living in a unitary state, a 
nation-state. They know a lot of diversity exists in the 
country, but they have not allowed allow citizenship to 
be defined in reference to anything other than Turkish 
identity. 
QUESTION: Do you think that there will be an alien-
ation of those Kurds who have been integrated into 
Turkish society, particularly within the military and 
the intelligence services? 
DR. MIICESELL: Turkey has used military conscrip-
tion as a way of promoting national identity, and, 
when a Kurd is drafted into the army, he gets shipped 
away from Kurdistan. The Turks have used military 
service and crash programs in literacy to try to Turldfy 
the non-Turkish population. It would be very difficult 
to find out how much assimilation has taken place, 
however, because Turks are so sensitive to this issue. 
Regardless, I can't imagine an assimilated Kurd who 
has changed his name and who knows Turkish going 
back to being a Kurdish nationalist.

Popular saying in southern China 
Introduction: The Disuniting of China 
In his recent statement to the United Nations, the Rus-
sian Foreign Minister Andrey V. Kozyrev declared 
that the threat of ethnic violence today is "no less seri-
ous than the threat of nuclear war was yesterday." 
Although most people would agree that this is cer-
tainly true for the troubled regions of the former 
Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, Africa, the Middle 
East, and much of the Americas, few would acknowl-
edge that China is also faced with such a threat. While 
the former Soviet Union, in particular, is seen to be 
riddled with ethnic and nationalist strife, China is still 
regarded as a relatively peaceful monolith that is dom-
inated by a militaristic centralized power structure 
intent on maintaining its control at all costs. This 
paper will not dispute that received wisdom. Rather, it 
will seek to demonstrate why we continue to see 
China in this way and to attempt to illustrate some of 
the potential faultlines in the system, should it ever 
begin to come apart at the seams. The real subject, it 
seems to me, when we examine China in this regard, 
is "which seams." 
With the rise of a unipolar world led by the United 
States, the question of China's domestic integrity 
becomes paramount (Garver 1992). However, geopo-
litical strategists and scholars may be tempted to aban-
don their interest in the minorities of China�key 
players in the border disputes between the two former 
neighboring adversaries�who were often only of 
interest as potential irritants to Sino-Soviet relations. 
China now shares a much reduced border with Russia 
and is instead faced with several new nations with 
much less political clout. This may lead scholars to 
disregard the ethnics within and without China as no 
longer of strategic or political interest. 
What are the pressures within China for ethnic con-
flict, and why have they changed with the demise of 
the USSR? How do we begin to conceive of China as 
something more than a monocultural society with a 
6,000-year written history? Do the politics of differ-
ence make a difference for the average Chinese citi-
zen? This paper will seek to address these questions as 
I outline what I see to be some of the ethnic "contours 
of power" (Yang 1989) within Chinese society. 
Although Sovietologists could never have predicted 
the rapid events that dismantled the USSR at the 
beginning of this decade, and I do not envision the 
immediate dissolution of China, attention to the preex-
isting faultlines within these superpowers might yield 
significant insight into the political maps that charac-
terize their present and possible futures. (See figure 8.) 
Ethnic Faultlines 
The Rise of Southern Nationalisms 
There is a new feeling in China, reflected by the 
popular saying: "Northerners love (ai) the nation; 
Southerners sell (mai) the nation." Accompanying 
the dramatic economic explosion in southern China, 
Southerners and others have begun to assert their 
cultural and political differences. Recent studies by

Edward Friedman (1993), Emily Honig (1991), and 
others have demonstrated a new rising importance of 
the politics of ethnic and cultural difference within 
China proper. Not only have the "official" minorities 
in China begun to more strongly assert their identities, 
pressing the government for further recognition, 
autonomy, and special privileges, but also different 
groups from within the so-called "Han" majority have 
begun to rediscover, reinvent, and reassert their ethnic 
differences. 
In the south especially, there has been a recent rewrit-
ing of history, illustrated by a newfound interest in the 
southern Chu Kingdom as key to southern success. 
Edward Friedman reports the establishment of muse-
ums throughout southern China dedicated to the glori-
ous history of the southern Kingdom of Chu, as 
manifested in both the Warring States period, 
475-221 BC and the Three Kingdoms 220-265 AD. 
Many Southerners now see the early Chu as essential 
to Chinese culture and as distinct from the less impor-
tant northern dynasties. In a significant departure from 
traditional Chinese historiography, southern scholars 
are beginning to argue that by the 6th century BC the 
bronze cultures of the Chu spread north and influ-
enced the development of Chinese civilization, not the 
other way around. This argument supports a reevalua-
tion of the importance of the south to China's past, as 
well as economic and geopolitical future (Friedman 
1993). 
Rising consciousness of the southern Chu, or Can-
tonese, is paralleled by reassertions of identity among 
the Hakka people, the southern Fujianese Min or Hok-
Iden, the Swatow, and a host of other peoples empow-
ered by economic success and embittered at age-old 
restraints placed on them from the north. Many people 
are beginning to note the southern leanings and ori-
gins of central party political figures, and it is not 
unusual to hear reports that so-and-so is a Hakka and 
therefore has acted in a certain way. Leading figures 
considered to be Hakka or part Hakka include Deng 
Xiaoping, Hu Yaobang, and Ye Jianning�father of 
Guangdong's previous governor. It is now widely 
known that all members of the Chinese Communist 
Party's (CCP) southern bases in the 1920s and 1930s 
were Hakka, as were their leaders. Mao successfully 
mobilized Hakka hatred against other Southerners and 
their landlords. People now often praise Zhou Enlai by 
stressing his southern Jiangnan linkages. And even 
Jiang Jieshi�Chiang Kai-shek�was praised as a 
Southerner who knew how to get money out of the 
United States. 
Liao Ping-hui (1993), a Taiwanese sociologist, reports 
that Taiwan is also experiencing a dramatic reasser-
tion of the gaoshan "aboriginal" peoples to their 
indigenous rights and claims. Age-old Taiwanese/ 
Mainlander ethnic cleavages (Hill Gates 1981) have 
given way to a predominance of Taiwanese language 
and political figures in everyday life as well as a host 
of other groups maneuvering along traditional cultural 
and linguistic grounds for political power. 
The assertions of the politics of difference within the 
majority Han society militate against traditional 
assumptions about the "homogeneous" Chinese, the 
monoculturalism of China, and the predominance of a 
91-percent Han majority nationality. Local differences 
are now becoming recognized as "ethnic," (Honig 
1992), whereas previously most China scholars dis-
missed them as merely "regional." This semantic 
shift, from "regional" to "ethnic" reflects a new 
salience placed upon the politics of difference in the 
People's Republic. 
Traditional China studies emphasized "China" as one 
civilization, one country, and one culture. Rarely was 
there serious attention paid to cultural and political 
difference in China studies unless it concerned the 
"exotic" minority border peoples, almost always 
regarded as marginal to power and politics in the Peo-
ple's Republic. Most studies dealt only with ethnic 
differences as related to the 55 official minority 
nationalities of China. While two recent collections in 
Daedalus and two new edited volumes on Chinese 
national identity have begun to address this issue, 
most of them approach the issues of cultural identity 
from the other direction, that is, asking what binds the 
Chinese together�Confucianism, Communism, state-
authoritarianism, familism, or language�rather than 
what might be pulling them apart. Conflicts with 
China's long divisiveness over cultural, linguistic, and 
110 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
historical power lines are noted in Frank Dikotter's 
recent book, The Discourse of Race in Modern China. 
During the Qing, interethniq conflicts (fenlei xiedou) 
or "armed battles to separate types (lei)," became 
comtnon between Han and Muslims; Haklca (a minor-
ity group of southeast China) and Hoklo (Holckien-
speaking Chinese); and Halcka and Punti (native Can-
tonese). Ethnic feuds strove to "clear the boundaries" 
by ejecting exogenous groups from their respective 
territories. Such ethnic clashes could be extremely 
violent: a major conflict between the Hakka and Punti 
in 1856-67 took a toll of 100,000 victims. The 
reformers' interpretation of racial war was based on 
lineage feuds. This vision was sustained by the 
semantic similarity between zu as lineage and zu as 
race. "Race," as will be demonstrated in the next 
chapter, would create nationhood. On the basis of 
internal conflicts between lineages, the reformers 
constructed a representation of external conflicts 
between races (DikOtter, 1992: 70-71). 
In an articulated hierarchy of escalating opposition, 
interlineage conflicts became the model for anti-
foreignism�"us" against "them," our race against 
theirs. It is this awareness of internal conflict, lineage, 
ethnic, and racial difference that drives a deep-seated 
anxiety about the possibility of China breaking up. 
The Chinese, in my opinion, never take China for 
granted, culturally, politically, or otherwise. This is 
because most Chinese are all too aware of how easily 
and naturally China could break into its constituent 
parts. It was widely believed for a short period follow-
ing the Tiananmen crackdown that the Beijing-based 
forces were more loyal to their city's residents and 
would refuse to obey the command, while other 
armies, such as the Wuhan-based military district, 
were loyal to Deng Xiao-ping. At one point, heavy 
gunfire was widely reported to be heard on the out-
skirts of the city. It was thought to be between the var-
ious military forces converging on the city. These 
deep-seated fears reflected a concern that China was 
on the verge of spiraling into a civil disunion reminis-
cent of the warlord era, when local militarists com-
manded personal armies and built up cultural, 
linguistic, and regional political power bases. 
The "Official" Minority Nationalities and Ethnic 
Separatism 
China is a multinational, multiethnic nation with 
55 "official" minority nationality groups, identified 
mainly in the 1950s, that now total more than 92 mil-
lion in population (see Dreyer 1976). This includes 
10 Muslim nationalities�with a total population of at 
least 20 million�located primarily on China's bor-
ders with Russia and the new mainly Muslim Central 
Asian States. In the south, there are nearly 12 million 
Austro-Malay�speaking Zhuang people on the Viet-
nam border and more than 24 separate minority 
groups in Yunnan Province alone, where cross-border 
relations with Burma, Cambodia, and Thailand have 
increased dramatically in the past few years. The state 
has assigned levels of minority autonomous adminis-
tration. There are five autonomous regions, scores of 
autonomous districts, and hundreds of autonomous 
counties and villages. Autonomous here primarily 
means that there is more local control over the admin-
istration of such things as resources, taxes, birth plan-
ning, education, and legal jurisdiction. It does not 
mean that control is in minority hands. Although most 
minority regions and districts have minority govern-
ment leaders, the Communist Party in all these areas is 
dominated by the Han majority, reflecting China's 
active watch over these so-called autonomous areas. 
111 
The recent detonation of two bombs in a Kashgar 
Hotel in southern Xinjiang that killed at least six peo-
ple convinced Beijing that its fears were well founded 
regarding Uighur separatism and the increasing influ-
ence from the newly independent Turkic states on its 
borders. The longstanding struggles of Tibetan inde-
pendence movements are also well documented (see 
Goldstein 1990). This supports the 1970s prediction 
by Victor Louis, understood to be a Soviet intelligence 
operative, who wrote in The Coming Decline of the 
Chinese Empire that China would fall apart due to the 
"national aspirations of the Manchu, Mongols, 
Uighurs, Tibetans, and other non-Chinese peoples" 
(cited in Friedman 1993: 270).

Until now, most China scholars have dismissed the 
possibility as remote, and the violent incidents on the 
margins of China's great landmass were not consid-
ered a serious threat to the monolith. The Uighur, 
Kazakhs, Tajiks, Mongols, and even the Tibetans are 
still felt to be insignificant minorities: politically and 
militarily inept, internationally isolated, and expected 
to go the way of the Manchu and others who have 
been thought to be long assimilated into  the Chinese 
mainstream. Although I am not predicting or advocat-
ing the dissolution of China along the lines that Victor 
Louis predicted, in this paper I argue that recent 
events among the Uighur in Kashgar are related to the 
Haldca in Canton and explain why these linkages have 
generally been ignored by China scholarship. 
I suggest that we need new ways of thinking about 
ethnic and regional identity that often leads to local 
conflict along unexpected lines. What is going on in 
southern China is linked to the rise of local ethnic 
nationalisms�the rise of the Cantonese, the assertion 
of the Halcka, and the galloping economy of the south-
ern Fujianese�to traditional nationalisms on China's 
borders as well as global trends that have affected 
China domestically and internationally. My research 
parallels work in contemporary anthropological and 
ethnographic theory, which rejects notions of homoge-
nized cultures and posits the existence of multiple 
identities and shifting associations. 
Despite the frequent wishing away of ethnic and 
nationalist loyalties, we are witnessing the rise of eth-
nic nationalisms that define the arenas of conflict 
across the globe. This flies in the face of-earlier predic-
tions by both modernization theorists and even Marxist 
ideologues that ethnic identities would fade in favor of 
individual, secularized, economic-based behaviors. 
"Tribalism," thought to be a thing of the past, is now 
the watchword of the 1990s. Most people are surprised 
at the viciousness with which people, who were long 
thought to be assimilated, modernized, and secularized, 
are assaulting and "cleansing" others in the name of 
primordialized self-identity, self-determination, and 
ethnic nationalism. What is going on here? 
National identities, although imagined, are never arbi-
trary but arise in particular sociopolitical contexts in 
relational opposition to specific others. To follow Ben 
Anderson (1983), it is the feeling of "otherness" one 
experiences while in exile or, I would add, while being 
incorporated and dominated into a nation-state that 
may more than anything lead to a strong sense of eth-
nicity. To follow Dorine Kondo (1989:43), the notion 
of relational identity stresses "multiplicity, contextual-
ity, complexity, power, irony, and resistance." It is the 
articulation of the multiplicities of these identities, 
within the context of where they have been expressed, 
that these identities become salient. 
Nationalism is not just an idea but also a certain style 
of representation that is now most often defined by 
interactions within or resistance to the nation-state. As 
Hobsbawm argues, "Nationalism is a political pro-
gram . . �Without this programme, realized or not, 
'nationalism' is a meaningless term," (Anthropology 
Today 1992:4). Nationalism is not arbitrary, but nei-
ther is there any core content to it. It has no essential 
essence. It is not shifted and redefined. 
I began to think much more about the nature of what 
relational and oppositional identity means (see Glad-
ney 1991) after interviewing Turkestani refugees and 
emigres in Turkey. It convinced me that much of what 
I had been reading in Foreign Affairs and other jour-
nals about the resurgence of "tribalisms" in Central 
Asia now that the Soviets have withdrawn was very 
wrong. I became convinced that these people were 
profoundly different than they were before their domi-
nation by the centralizing states of Soviet and Chinese 
Central Asia and that their multifaceted identities are 
anything but tribal. 
Han Nationalism and the Rise of the Chinese 
Nation-State 
As yet, no larger studies of the creation of Han nation-
alism have emerged�mainly because it is assumed by 
sinologists trained in the dominant tradition that 
"Han" is generally equal to "Chinese"�a tradition 
created and maintained by the current regime in 
power. Studies of Chinese nationalism have generally 
ignored the issue of the creation of the Han majority in 
favor of the larger question of Chinese identity. Few 
have questioned how the Han became the 94-percent 
majority of China. Perhaps, the traditional Confucian 
112

Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
preoccupation with order and harmony in a society 
held tenuously together by proper relationships may 
be one reason why these categories have never been 
challenged. The very Confucian practice of the "recti-
fication of names" (zheng ming) is of primary concern 
to the Chinese ethnographers; once the Han and all the 
minority nationalities have been identified or named, 
order is restored, and all is well in the world. I would 
argue that it is the anxiety about differences within 
Chinese society, not the affection shared within, that 
has managed to hold China together. 
The notion of "Han ren" (Han person) has existed for 
many centuries as those descendants of the Han 
dynasty, which had its beginnings in the Wei River 
valley. However, I submit that the notion of "Han zu" 
or "Han name (Han nationality) is an entirely modern 
phenomenon�it arises with the shift from empire to 
nation, as argued above. While the concept of a Han 
person certainly existed, the notion of a unified Han 
nationality that makes up 94 percent of China's popu-
lation gained its greatest popularity under Dr. Sun Yat-
sen. Dr. Sun was most certainly influenced by strong 
currents of Japanese nationalism during his long-term 
stay in Japan. Sun argued that the ruler-subject rela-
tion that had persisted throughput China's dynastic 
history would need to be fundamentally transformed if 
a true nationalist movement were to sweep China and 
engender support among all its, peoples. More practi-
cally, Dr. Sun needed a way to,mobilize all Chinese 
against the imperial rule of the Qing, a dynasty 
founded by a northeastern people who became known 
as the Manchu. By invoking the argument that the 
majority of the people in China were Han, Sun effec-
tively found a symbolic metaphorical opposition to 
the Manchu to which the vast majority of peoples in 
China would easily rally. 
Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated the idea that there were 
"Five Peoples of China" (wuzu gonghe): the Han, the 
Man (Manchu), the Meng (Mongolian), the Zang 
(Tibetan), and the Hui�a term that included all Mus-
lims in China who are now divided into the Uighur, 
Kazakh, Hui, and so forth. This recognition of the 
Five Peoples of China served as the main platform for 
his Nationalist revolution, which overthrew the Qing 
empire and established the first "People's Republic." 
One must have peoples if there is to be a people's 
revolution. The critical link between Sun Yat-sen's 
Five Peoples policy and his desire to unify all of 
China is made crystal clear from his discussion of 
nationalism�the first of his Three People's Principles 
(Sanmin Zhuyi). It is here that Sun argued the Chinese 
were a disconnected, loose sheet of sand, with no 
sense of the nation. 
It is also not at all surprising that Dr. Sun should turn 
to the use of the all-embracing idea of the Han as the 
national group, which included all the regional peo-
ples and Sino-linguistic speech communities. Sun Yat-
sen was Cantonese, raised as an overseas Chinese in 
Hawaii. As one who spoke little Mandarin, and with 
few connections in northern China, he would have 
easily aroused traditional northern suspicions of 
southern radical movements extending back to the 
Song dynasty (10th century) that were, of course, well 
known to him. This recurring historical pattern and the 
traditional antipathy between the Cantonese and 
northern peoples would have posed an enormous bar-
rier to his promotion of a nationalist movement. Dr. 
Sun found a way to rise above deeply embedded 
north-south ethnocentrisms. The use and perhaps 
invention of the term "Han minzu" was a brilliant 
attempt to mobilize other non-Cantonese, especially 
northern Mandarin speakers, and the powerful Zhe-
jiang and Shanghainese merchants into one overarch-
ing national group against the Manchu and other 
foreigners during the unstable period following the 
Unequal Treaties. The Han were seen to stand in 
opposition to the "Others" on their borders�the Man-
chu, Tibetan, Mongol, and Hui, as well as the Western 
imperialists. By distinguishing these "Others" in their 
midst, the nationalists cultivated the imagined identity 
of the "we" Han, as opposed to the "they" minorities 
and foreigners. In Ben Anderson's terms, Dr. Sun was 
engaged in "stretching the short, tight skin of the 
nation over the gigantic body of the empire." 
The Communists stretched this skin even further, fol-
lowing the Soviet model and identifying not five, but 
55, nationality groups, with the Han in the 91-percent 
majority. My argument is that both for the nationalists 
and the Communists, it was not only the political 
113 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
necessity of enlisting the support of the ethnics on 
their borders that led them to recognize minority 
nationalities but also the desire to unify the nation 
against the outsiders in order to overcome internal dif-
ference. Now that there is no longer an external threat, 
it is this internal difference that will most pull them 
apart. 
The best analogy here is that of Europe and the 
Roman Empire. Lucien Pye (1993) has recently 
observed that "China today is what Europe would 
have been if the unity of the Roman Empire had lasted 
until now and there had not been the separate emer-
gence of the separate entities of England, France, Ger-
many, and the like." China is a multilingual nation 
with large populations that can be divided among the 
six major language groups. Linguists such as John De 
Francis and Jerry Norman have demonstrated that 
there is as much diversity "among the Chinese dialects 
as. . . among the Romance languages .1. . .To take an 
extreme example, there is probably as much differ-
ence between the dialects of Peking and Chaozhou as 
there is between Italian and French; the Hainan Min 
dialects are as different from the Xian dialect as Span-
ish is from Rumanian," (Norman 1988). Much like 
Latin in the Middle Ages, China's diverse language 
groups all are served with one standard writing sys-
tem, Chinese ideographs that vary in some styles, such 
as Cantonese, although the speech communities are 
mutually exclusive. What holds these diverse commu-
nities together is oppositional hierarchy. The politics 
of difference, until now, have not reached to this level. 
Ethnic and Oppositional Identity 
It is oppositional hierarchy, the shifting nature of iden-
tity, that now enlivens Chinese cultural nationalism. 
This relates to the popular Arab Bedouin proverb: 
Me against my brother, my brother and I against our 
cousin, our cousin and us against you. 
As the great Central Asianist Bartold once said: 
"When you ask a Turkestani what his identity is, he 
will answer that he is first of all a Muslim, then an 
inhabitant of such or such city or village. . ,or, if he 
is a nomad, member of such or such tribe." But as 
Nazif Shahrani pointed out, later Muslim travelers 
noted that the only reason the Central Asians first told 
Bartold they were Muslims was because they per-
ceived him as a European Christian and part of the 
Czarist colonial project. In similar fashion, Halcka 
have always told anthropologists that they are Han 
persons, but, among themselves, they and most South-
erners believe they are Tang persons. 
By looking at ethnic identity and conflict in relational 
terms, one can immediately understand why a person 
from a certain lineage in southern China can be 
Toisan, Cantonese, Southern, Han, and a Chinese citi-
zen, all at once or selectively, depending on to whom 
they are talking�foreigner, non-Han, Northerner, 
non-Cantonese, or non-Toisan Cantonese. It is finding 
out when and how one assumes these different identi-
ties that is key here, not what any one identity will be 
in some essentialized permanent form that exists out-
side of historical contingency. 
Sir Edmund Leach (1954) was the first anthropologist 
to argue that ethnic identity is formed as the result of 
power oppositions; the Kachin in Highland Burma 
only acted ethnically when in opposition to the Shans. 
Evans-Pritchard's (1940) classic study of the Nuer 
determined the unique expansive-contractive nature of 
hierarchical segmentary lineages among nomadic 
societies that lack a distinct leader. When the Nuer 
were confronted with an outside power, they unified 
and organized to a high degree of political complexity 
in order to respond to the challenge. When the threat 
subsided, they diversified and atomized. 
Ethnic identities are often seen to coalesce and crys-
tallize in the face of higher order oppositions. These - 
ethnic identities form and reform according to articu-
lated hierarchies of interaction with the particular 
oppositional power in question (see diagrams). In 
From Empire to Nation, Rupert Emerson (1960) pro-
vides a perceptive definition of the nation as "the larg-
est community, which when the chips are down, 
effectively commands men's loyalty" (cited in Connor 
1984). Julian Huxley and A. C. Haddon proposed: "A 
'nation' has been cynically but not inaptly defined as a 
society united by a common error as to its origin and a 
common aversion to its neighbors."

Now that the global map is most defined by the 
nation-state, the peoples within must define them-
selves vis-a-vis the nation-state. E. K. Francis, in his 
Interethnic Relations (1978); argued that the rise of 
ethnic identities and interethnic conflict was a phe-
nomenon tied most directly to the nation-state. It is the 
nation-state that takes upon itself the task of legislat-
ing identity. Empires were consumed more with rul-
ing, rather than legislating and identifying the peoples 
under their spheres of influence. In the modern era, it 
is often the nation-state apparatus itself with which 
ethnic groups find themselves in opposition. By agree-
ing to articulate their identities along the contours 
shaped by ethnic identification policies and censuses, 
ethnic groups demonstrate their desire to form coali-
tions at the highest possible level in order to interact 
as a powerful collectivity with the state apparatus. 
These ethnic identities are "imagined" in Ben Ander-
son's (1983) terms, but they are never arbitrary. They 
form according to cultural, historical, and political 
power oppositions and alliances. What we are wit-
nessing today with the end of the Cold War is the 
moving down of oppositional alliances to levels that 
now emphasize the importance of the politics of dif-
ference below the level of the Han. The opposition to 
the West, to imperialism, and. to the Japanese is no 
longer a motivating force binding China together. 
Ethnic Nationalism in China: Some Policy 
Considerations 
The increasing importance of playing the politics of 
difference for personal and corporate gain out of 
response to stigmatized identities, or just out of a 
renewed sense of the meaningfulness of one's history 
in China, has important implications for how we 
understand ethnic identity and the potential for con-
flict. Although this paper does not predict ethnic con-
flict along any predetermined lines, the argument here 
is to suggest the importance of certain faultlines, 
should fragmentation, most important at the center of 
the state's power structure, occur. The Uighur will 
never become independent as long as Beijing is in 
firm control, but Beijing is increasingly dependent on 
Canton, and, if Canton should make a move, many 
Uighur would be only too glad to take advantage of 
the situation. Analysis and policy decisions regarding 
ethnic conflict in China should consider several issues, 
which follow. 
Cultural nationalism and ethnic difference should be 
taken seriously. This is true not only among the "offi-
cial" minority nationalities, who are stigmatized or 
empowered because of that designation, but also 
among at least two other kinds of groups: applicant 
groups and sub-Han groups. 
Applicant groups are seeking or have sought to be rec-
ognized as "official" minority nationalities. Many of 
these groups were not recognized in the 1940s and 
1950s during the nationality identification programs, 
and some have sought, indeed militated for and politi-
cally organized around, nationality recognition. There 
are at least 15 groups who have applied and are under 
consideration for nationality recognition by the State 
Commission for Nationalities (guojia minzu shiwu 
weiyuanhui). These groups include the Chinese Jews 
(you tai ren), Khmer, Sherpas, Ku Cong, Deng (a 
Tibetan sub-group), Chuanqing, and several others 
(see Heberer 1990). Some 900,000 people in Guizhou 
Province alone applied for minority recognition in the 
early 1980s, and the 1982 census reported that 
799,705 "unidentified" people remained in China. Of 
interest are the Chinese Jews, once thought to be 
extinct but now claiming a membership of 8,000 and 
under consideration for rapid recognition due to 
China's official diplomatic ties to and improving rela-
tions with Israel. Although this group is certainly not 
militant, it stands to benefit considerably from recog-
nition, perhaps leading to local-level rivalries with 
other groups, particularly with Hui Muslims, to whom 
many of the Chinese Jews formerly belonged. Another 
group, the Ku Cong, presently classified as a branch of 
the Lahu nationality in Yunnan and known as the Yel-
low Lahu, are worth noting because one of their mem-
bers, Wang Zhengcun, was the elected leader of the 
Tiananmen Square Nationalities Institute's student 
democratic group and was sought and arrested as 
number 3 on the most wanted list. He has long been 
known as a "Ku Cong" nationalist, seeking recogni-
tion of his people, illustrating the importance of this 
issue for political activism (see Gladney 1990). 
115

Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
As noted above, other groups to watch outside the 
official nationalities are particularly those so-called 
"sub-Han" groups that have maintained local, linguis-
tic, and ethnic ties throughout the CCP period, despite 
lack of recognition. Especially important are those 
with outside transnational links or large populations 
outside the China mainland, such as the Halcka in Tai-
wan and Hong Kong; the Swatow in Hong Kong, 
Thailand, and Indonesia; and the Min-speaking (1-lok-
'den, Fujianese) populations in Southeast Asia and 
Taiwan. Although other local level ethnic differences 
are important in regional and ethnic politics through-
out China, it is these groups that have the economic 
and international clout to make a difference in the 
domestic scene. This again does not suggest that any 
one of these groups alone is sufficient to destabilize a 
region of China or engage in strong political activism. 
Instead, I am arguing that, as Rbpert noted above, 
when the "chips are down" these are the kinds of 
groups best positioned to exploit their cultural and 
political resources. 
Closer attention should be paid to debates in the Chi-
nese community within and outside China regarding 
the construction of Chineseness, or Chinese national 
identity. Like Sun, Yat-sen's own historic formulation, 
the outcome of these debates may determine the direc-
tion of public policy, whether it be pluralist, federalist, 
monoethnic, or even racist. At the same time, studies 
of "sub-Han" national identity and cultural difference 
have become popular in the mainland, with Xu 
Jiexun's (1985) series of publications, New Explora-
tions in the Han Nationality's History and Culture, 
being just the beginning of this important trend (first 
begun perhaps with Fan Wenlan's 1957 collection). 
Xu, a historian and political scientist at the Guangxi 
Institute of Nationalities in Nanning, has effectively 
used the Han categorization as a "nationality" (minzu) 
as a means to study cultural difference within the Han. 
Study of minority nationalities in China should focus 
not only on their traits, population, history, and culture 
but, more important, also on their interconnected-
ness�the articulation of their identity across regional 
and national boundaries. In the international sphere, 
this has certainly been important for Tibetan; Mus-
lim�especially the Uighur, Kazakh, Tajik, and Hui; 
Korean (the most educated and economically 
advanced nationality in China); and Mongol groups. 
Domestically, it has been important for their establish-
ing national networks, often through state institutions 
such as the Nationalities Institutes, Islamic and Bud-
dhist Associations, and regional Nationality Commis-
sions. It has also been important for the reawakening 
of national consciousness, such as among the Manchu, 
who have established three new autonomous counties 
in the northeast during the past 10 years. 
Population politics should be watched closely. As 
China more severely enforces its one-child policy, 
minority recognition will become more important as a 
means to having more children. In the past, China has 
been rather reluctant to enforce restriction on minority 
births in rural areas; minorities were "encouraged" to 
limit births to one more child than the Han in their 
area, but in general they had as many as they wanted. 
Now the government is attempting to enforce this pol-
icy despite strong opposition. Minorities are reluctant 
to adhere to increasingly applied birth planning poli-
cies. For example, the requirement to limit births to 
three among minorities led to riots among Uighurs 
and Mongols in 1989 and 1990. Chinese often rede-
fine themselves as minorities. Children of mixed mar-
riages are almost always opting for minority identity, 
and minorities are increasingly preferred as potential 
marriage partners. This has led to a phenomenal popu-
lation growth of 35 percent between 1982 and 1990 
among minorities, while the Han population only 
grew by 10 percent. Some groups grew dramati-
cally�the Manchu grew by 114 percent, the Tujia by 
140 percent, the Hui by 40 percent, and the Uighur by 
40 percent. The Gelao�a Yunnan minority�grew by 
an incredible 714 percent. The vast majority of these 
increases are due to redefining and reregistration of 
people who were previously classified as Han (see 
Gladney 1991: 240 if.; Banister 1987). 
The administration of minority privileges should be 
watched. Both the extent of the privileges�such as 
tax breaks, birth planning, educational incentives, and 
economic development investment�and the effect 
they have among the majority population should be 
considered. In any society affirmative action programs 
116 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
often alienate the majority, and in China this has led to 
resentment and ethnic conflict in some areas. This is 
particularly true for groups such as the Hui, Manchu, 
She, and Zhuang, who closely, resemble the Han 
majority in their areas. It has led to accusations that 
these groups are faking ethnic identity in order to have 
more children or receive special government assis-
tance (see my discussion of the "two-child Hui" Mus-
lims, Gladney: The Journal of Asian Studies). 
Popular culture should be monitored as an indication 
of the rising importance of ethnic or cultural differ-
ence. In Beijing, whereas only a few years ago South-
erners and southern accents were pilloried and 
stigmatized by many "crosstalk" comedians and enter-
tainers, Cantonese terms and aecents are now highly 
valued and affected. Canton, Shenzhen, and Hong 
Kong songs, movies, clothing styles, and entertainers 
are extremely popular throughout China, even though 
they are frequently not understood. At the same time, 
"ethnic art" that exoticizes, romanticizes, and often 
eroticizes the minorities in Yunnan and Tibet, is 
extremely popular inside and outside China, leading to 
the founding of the Yunnan Art School (see Gladney: 
Asian Visions of Authority: Religion and the Modern 
States of East and Southeast Asia). 
The ethnic makeup of "floating populations" and other 
labor groups should be examined, particularly as it 
relates to large migrations of peoples and the growth 
of ethnic economic niches. Dorothy Solinger in a 
series of articles has documented the rising promi-
nence of "floating" migrant populations but has not 
analyzed why it is that most of the groups are mem-
bers of certain ethnic sub-Han communities. For 
example, almost all shoe repair in China is dominated 
by Zhejiangese from a certain county; child care 
workers and domestics in Beijing almost all come 
from one part of Anhui; the Subei people dominate 
specific "unclean" occupations in Shanghai (see 
Honig 1991); Cantonese now cbntract almost all of 
their agricultural labor to Hunanese peasants; and, 
until recently, the Uighur dominated the moneychang-
ing black market. 
117 
The Taiwan aboriginal movement should be monitored 
as to its impact on Republic of China policy and its 
coverage in the People's Republic of China media. The 
outcome over this debate about indigenous peoples' 
land rights, their desire for native language training, 
and the need for cultural preservation will have serious 
repercussions on both sides of the Taiwan Strait. 
The military has been drastically overhauled since 
questions were raised about regional loyalty during 
the Tiananmen incident. Further attention should be 
paid to the origins and cultures of the officers in 
charge and of the forces under their commands. 
China's military districts occupy important macrore-
gions that William Skinner (1965) once argued were 
entirely separate focuses around which the rest of 
China moved. Although China, unlike the USSR, has 
not employed many "official" minorities in the mili-
tary, many commanders and their forces may have sig-
nificant local and regional attachments. Military 
researchers have tended to dismiss these local and 
regional differences because of certain assumptions 
about Han and Chinese identity. The ethnic and cul-
tural makeup of the military may not have much influ-
ence on military decision making, nonetheless, it may 
effect the relationship with the local populations, as 
we saw briefly in Beijing. 
In the mid-1980s, political scientists initiated a series 
of studies and conferences under the rubric of "bring-
ing the state back in" (see Skocpol 1985), leading to a 
stronger consideration of the role of the state in defin-
ing state-society relations. This was an added correc-
tive to earlier, particularist studies, which emphasized 
microeconomic and community or individual-actor�
based approaches. However, in both approaches cul-
ture as a political force was somehow lost. As a politi-
cal and cultural anthropologist, I am arguing for the 
necessity of bringing culture back into the debate, not 
as a determining force in social relations but as an 
important factor in understanding the options avail-
able to political actors in the field of social relations.

Geographic and Ethnographic 
Perspectives on Ethnic Conflict in 
Southeast Asia 
Eric Crystal 
Coordinator

Geographic/Ethnographic Overview 
Few regions of the world present so wide a range of 
natural environments and sociocultural adaptations as 
does Southeast Asia. The enduring geographic and 
ethnographic diversity of the region has been com-
pounded in recent decades by the forces of national-
ism, impact of ideology, intervention of external 
powers, and differential pace of development in the 
10 nations of the region. In brief, Southeast Asia today 
provides an extraordinary range of economies, societ-
ies, cultures, and geographical regimes. Per capita 
income ranges from $17,000 per year in Brunei to 
$120 per year in Laos. The stability and technological 
sophistication of Singapore, the newly industrialized 
status of Thailand, and the burgeoning agroindustrial 
base of Malaysia contrast strongly with the stark real-
ity of brutal military rule in Burma, the current 
attempt at national reconciliation in Cambodia, and 
the efforts to emerge from a subsistence economy in 
Laos. 
In the brief time allotted to me here, I wish to discuss 
the past, present, and prospective dangers posed by 
ethnic tensions in a region that, in the past decade, has 
evidenced an average rate of economic growth (7 per-
cent) higher than any other on the globe. Although 
poverty and lack of human and natural resources may 
contribute to ethnic tensions, so also may the rise of a 
middle class and the perception of the monopolization 
of power by discrete minorities in the most economi-
cally successful of Southeast Asian states. 
'The views expressed in this paper are solely those of the author. 
Identifying Key Issues in Ethnic Relations 
For purposes orthis discussion, I will focus on four 
key aspects of ethnic tension in the Southeast Asian 
region. The first factor relates to environmental issues 
and the competition for agricultural land in highland 
regions. The second factor is centered on religious 
affiliation, identification, and proselytization. The 
third factor focuses on tensions in the border regions 
of Southeast Asia. The fourth aspect relates to vesti-
gial ideological conflicts in this region often articu-
lated in terms of ethnic interest. 
Highland-Lowland Ecological Distinctions and 
Ethnic Tensions 
From the perspective of precolonial India and early 
China, Southeast Asia was a frontier region, inhabited 
by exotic races and peoples. Relatively low in popula-
tion in comparison to India and China in prehistoric as 
well as more recent times, Southeast Asia yielded 
valuable tribute and trade products such as aromatic 
sandalwood, exotic bird of paradise feathers, and 
much coveted rhinoceros horn (Hickey, 1982; 33-34). 
From late neolithic times to the present, the geograph-
ical distinction between the alluvial plains and moun-
tain hinterlands tended to define interethnic relations 
in the area and from the earliest articulation of state 
society�perhaps in the second century AD�to the 
present a sharp division between lowland and high-
land populations has obtained in Southeast Asia. 
Plains dwellers adapted and refined wet-rice cultiva-
tion, producing surpluses and articulating stratified 
societies well over 2,500 years ago. Early kingdoms in 
Southeast Asia such as Oc-eo in Vietnam and Funan 
in Cambodia further articulated the development of 
culture to the level of the state. Kingdoms in the 
region from Myanmar (Burma) to Cambodia soon 
adopted the religion and the buttressing ideology of 
Hinduism, which was brought in the wake of Hindu 
trade missions to the wealthy frontier states in "the 
lands below the wind" in Southeast Asia (Reid; 1988).

In contrast to the largely homogeneous lowland irri-
gated-rice-tilling peoples, the mountain inhabitants 
were fragmented into many small tribal groups. A 
stability of economy and polity naturally emerges 
from irrigated rice agriculture. By contrast, shifting 
cultivation in the mountains normally dictated the 
cyclical mobility of tribal peoples, offering as well 
opportunities for new migrating groups to till South-
east Asian fields in the wake of the unyielding expan-
sion of Han populations in southern China. The 
different languages, religions, socioeconomic adapta-
tions, and political loyalties of the lowlanders and 
highlanders engendered tension and conflict even in 
precolonial times. 
Presently the frontier of the Southeast Asian mountain 
hinterland seems to be in the final stages of closing. 
Until three decades ago, highland slash-and-burn cul-
tivators could always count on another forest or an 
additional mountain swidden field to provide subsis-
tence sustenance in the wake of the exhaustion of old 
farming plots. Today, throughout Southeast Asia, pop-
ulation expansion, commercial exploitation of timber 
and mineral reserves, and initiatives to conserve the 
rainforest constrain�if not absolutely deny�the tra-
ditional exploitation of the highland farming environ-
ment by minority tribal peoples. In the past 
lowlanders were content to conduct barter trade with 
upland tribal societies, secure in the knowledge that 
the only constraint on the expansion of their irrigated 
plains was the lack of available labor. Today the plains 
have in many areas reached their absolute carrying 
capacity. For the lowland rural poor and landless 
laborers, survival strategies include migration to urban 
areas or colonization of upland regions that have been 
the historic preserve of minority cultivators. With 
each passing decade the pressure on tribal peoples to 
permanently settle, abandon their claims to wide 
expanses of land, and assimilate to national culture 
have intensified. Government population-transfer pro-
grams lend the legitimacy of state planning to the shift 
of lowland populations to the uplands. Highlander 
perceptions of second-class citizenship status (if such 
citizenship is recognized at all) clearly pose the threat 
of conflict. The role of major powers in the highlands 
of Southeast Asia in the recent past clearly deserves at 
least passing mention in the context of this confer-
ence. Colonial divide-and-rule policies, perhaps 
refined earlier in other parts of the world, oftentimes 
were articulated by the English in Burma, the Dutch in 
Indonesia, and the French in Indochina in maintaining 
the social and political control of majority lowland 
peoples. Highland minorities oftentimes were given 
strategically crucial roles to play in colonial armed 
forces. Often such tribal groups were the first to be 
weaned from traditional religion by Christian mission-
aries dispatched with official sanction from the metro-
pole. 
121 
No discussion of ethnic conflict in Southeast Asia 
could proceed without direct reference to the conflict 
in Indochina. In Laos the highland-lowland geo-
graphic division took on special significance. Here the 
handful of French-trained Hmong soldiers were sub-
sequently nurtured by American operatives as the core 
cadre of a large, secret army based at Long Chieng 
(Hamilton-Merritt; 1993). For nearly 15 years this 
superbly motivated, well-armed, amply supplied, and 
professionally advised force struck as guerrilla units 
along the Ho Chi Minh trail, fought a rear guard 
action to try to hold territory in northern Laos, and 
assisted in the rescue of downed US airmen. The 
"secret army" consisted of not only Hmong but also of 
Mien and Lahu peoples of the high mountains of 
northern Laos. In the end their loyalty was not recip-
rocated. Some 250,000 highlanders who were aban-
doned in the spring of 1975 eventually fled their 
native Laos, while untold numbers fell victim to eth-
nic reprisal inside Laos. Over the past 17 years, at 
least 100,000 highland Laotians who qualified as 
political refugees have resettled in the United States. 
In Laos, low-intensity conflict has persisted to the 
present, pitting highland rebels against the central 
government. 
Highland-lowland geographic distinctions articulated 
in conflicts over land, political control, and ideology 
are amply demonstrated by the example of Laos. The 
fundamental question for the future is the role that 
nongovernmental organizations (NG0s), multilateral 
lending agencies, and national aid programs will play 
toward ameliorating these conflicts. In the past, 
national intelligence agencies have oftentimes pur-
posefully aggravated extant tensions, the better to win 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
the loyalty, allegiiince, and cooperation of ethnic 
groups whose interests were perceived as similar 
to those of the funding agency. But, as the recent 
example of Afghanistan indicates, it is often easier to 
inflame ethnic, religious, and tribal passions than to 
control them. 
Religious Tensions 
Southeast Asia has generally been regarded as a 
region of religious tolerance. Indonesia, the nation 
with the largest Muslim population, is located here, as 
are the majority of the world's Theravada Buddhists. 
Major Christian communities are found here as well 
not only in the Philippines but also as minorities in 
almost all the nation-states of the region. In the cities, 
Chinese�Southeast Asians worship at Buddhist, Con-
fucian/Taoist, and�increasingly�at Christian sanc-
tuaries. In the recent past, ethnic, religious, and 
ideological conflicts have sometimes been bound as 
one. 
The most gruesome expression of intracommunal con-
flict since the close of the colonial era in Southeast 
Asia transpired in Indonesia�largely on Java and 
Bali�in the wake of an abortive Communist coup in 
1965. As the Indonesian Army moved to seize power 
from President Soekarno, a massive slaughter of Com-
munist and Communist-affiliated intellectuals, peas-
ants, and workers was sanctioned (Hefner, 1990: 
193-215). The victims were depicted as godless trai-
tors. The executioners were largely drawn from 
fanatic Muslim youth groups. The rhetoric was that of 
national salvation through righteous retribution. The 
reaction of the Western world to these events was gen-
erally one of unrestrained approval. In the context of 
the Cold War, the destruction of the largest Commu-
nist party outside the Eastern Bloc was deemed to be a 
major victory for the West. The conflict with the Com-
munists was carefully couched in religious terms in 
Indonesia to generate maximum support for the new 
regime. 
A little noted but clearly significant element in the 
Southeast Asian religious landscape is the rapid 
spread of Christianity in recent years. The tradition-
ally animist highlanders across much of the region 
have opted for Christian conversion as a means of 
maintaining their distinct identity in the face of Bud-
dhist or Muslim lowland pressures to assimilate. As 
Christianity advances, both in the mountains and also 
in distinct urban and lowland mainstream communi-
ties, the potential for tension rises. Such tension may 
be based on longstanding differences between the 
established religion in the lowlands and the new world 
religious affiliation in the highlands. Such tension may 
also result from newly acquired skills in literacy, 
enhanced ethnic consciousness, and strengthened 
resistance in the face of perceived lowland cultural 
assimilation policies. 
Tensions in Malaysia and Indonesia between Muslim 
majority populations and Christian minorities has led 
to violence in the past and may do so in the future. In 
Indonesia tensions between Christians and Muslims 
have been rising, especially in light of the ongoing 
advance of Christianity in remote outer island regions 
and in parts of Java formerly inclined towards pre-
Hindu religious affiliation. Similarly, in Malaysia the 
underlying tensions between Christian and Confucian 
Chinese and Muslim Malays has erupted in significant 
violence in the recent past (1969) and could certainly 
do so in the future. In Vietnam largely clandestine for-
eign missionary operations are underway in many 
parts of the country. These could engender internal 
conflicts and ignite ethnic and nationalist passions in 
ways unintended by their proponents. Highland Bur-
mese rebels, especially in Karen and Lahu regions, 
have, since independence, always manipulated their 
Christian affiliation as one of the several aspects of 
regional independence threatened by Burmese nation-
alism as defined in Rangoon. In Thailand, the rela-
tively small highland population�about 9 percent of 
the country�is increasingly constrained from practic-
ing shifting cultivation. Pressure on the land has led to 
accelerated conversions among groups such as the 
Karen and the Alcha in recent years. Such affiliation 
may indeed strengthen the will, resolve, and capability 
of formerly isolated peoples to resist incursions upon 
land and culture. As the case of Burma indicates, eth-
nic conflict can result if the relations between minority 
and majority communities fail to be negotiated with 
tact and understanding. 
Border Regions 
In a region as diverse as Southeast Asia, subprovincial 
district borders are often isomorphic with linguistic 
122 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
and cultural distinctions. National borders inevitably 
demarcate major ethnic distinctions marked by unique 
linguistic, religious, and historical traditions. Of 
course there is no reason why the existence of national 
distinctions as demarcated by the borders of neighbor-
ing states should necessarily induce conflict. Yet a 
closer look at a few key border regions should at least 
occasion cause for reflection. 
Indonesia�Papua New Guinea. Indonesia, fourth-
most-populous nation on earth, presents a generally 
positive example of national integration in a multieth-
nic, geographically fragmented state. Indonesian 
nationalists in this century have successfully promul-
gated a national language, wrested independence from 
an intransigent Dutch metropole, welded a disparate 
archipelago of 5,000 inhabited islands into a coherent 
national entity, and confronted and contained a host of 
regional insurrections and irredentist rebellions. Nev-
ertheless, several problem regions continue to trouble 
policymakers in Jakarta. 
The Indonesian state extends deep into the cultural 
heartland of Melanesia on the island of New Guinea. 
Here a low-level transnational conflict has festered for 
years. The issue is not one of border demarcation. It 
relates, more specifically, to the future of the indige-
nous Melanesian population of the Indonesian prov-
ince of Irian Jaya�population, 1.6 million. This area 
was not ceded to Indonesia by the Netherlands at the 
transfer of sovereignty in 1949. Indeed, only after 
Indonesia threatened to invade in 1962 did US pres-
sure and UN administrative machinery facilitate 
Dutch withdrawal in 1963. Since that time the local 
population has become increasingly marginalized in 
Irian urban areas as thousands of entrepreneurial 
migrants from central Indonesia have poured into the 
resource-rich province. The languages and cultures of 
the indigenous population are distinct from those of 
central Indonesia. Rebel forces have frequently found 
refuge across the border in Papua New Guinea (PNG). 
Both Indonesia and the PNG national government 
have worked hard to minimize border incidents. Still, 
this border area could pose serious problems in the 
future, problems that arise from fundamentally dis-
tinct perceptions of interest of the indigenous Irianese 
population on the one hand and the government in far-
off Jakarta on the other. 
A subtext on the Irian border problem is that of East 
Timor. The world was shocked to learn of the Santa 
Cruz cemetery massacre there in 1991. There is every 
indication that during the 1975-80 period when Cam-
bodia was wracked by the autogenocidal policies of 
the Khmer Rouge violations of human rights on an 
equal scale were underway in Fast Timor. The armed 
Timorese independence movement has been largely 
quashed. The aspirations, identity, and yearning for 
dignity and self-governance of the people of East 
Timor clearly remain strong. Hopefully the current 
international pressure being brought on Indonesia may 
result in a reasonable compromise, perhaps facilitating 
the establishment of the region as an autonomous area 
within the Indonesian Republic. Administrative prece-
dents for such action�Aceh in northernmost Sumatra, 
Yogyakarta in central Java�have worked reasonably 
well. If the current military repression continues, rebel 
forces there may in the future successfully regroup. 
The case of East Timor is a clear example of selective 
Western interest in human rights abuses (Dunn; 1983). 
The Indonesian invasion of the area occurred shortly 
after the fall of Saigon. Jakarta was concerned that the 
leftist Fretilin independence forces would prove to be 
a major security risk to the republic. Washington 
assisted the Indonesian military with significant 
equipment sales�OH-10 Bronco aircraft directed 
specifically toward the counterinsurgency require-
ments of the Indonesian armed forces in Timor. 
China-Vietnam. The China-Vietnam border wit-
nessed a major military conflict in early 1979. The 
history of Vietnam is essentially that of a relatively 
small country defending national territory against an 
aggressive colossus to the north. The wars with France 
and the United States are fundamentally subtexts on 
the unique cultural and politicomilitary relationship 
between China and Vietnam. Because both states are 
currently ideologically consistent, ancient animosities 
and contemporary trade and territorial disputes�the 
Spratly and Paracel Islands�most probably will 
remain muted in the near future. Chinese military 
expansion and internal armament procurement are of 
concern throughout Southeast Asia. This is particu-
larly true in Vietnam, where disputes over the South 
China Sea islands have broken out in fierce, if abbre-
viated, conflict in the recent past. 
123

Cambodia-Vietnam. Cambodia remains a cause for 
major concern. Once the greatest of precolonial 
nation-states in Southeast Asia, the kingdom of the 
Khmer has been in decline for many centuries, victim-
ized by cohesive and stronger Thai and Vietnamese 
forces and by an unusually fractious elite. The enmity 
expressed by Cambodians toward their Vietnamese 
neighbors courses deep and is widely shared among 
the populace. The Cambodians feel that Vietnam is 
determined to swallow up what remains of their cul-
ture and country�much as ancient Vietnam destroyed 
the coastal kingdom of Champa in 1471 (Tarling, 
1992; 156). In the past Cambodian demagogues have 
manipulated such sentiments to their own ends. 
Anti-Vietnamese pogroms have facilitated the careers 
of Lon Nol and Pol Pot; anti-Vietnamese rhetoric has 
been consistently employed during the recent UN-
supervised election campaign. At present, it seems as 
if the long internal nightmare of Cambodia is coming 
to an end. If things go wrong, however, violence 
directed against the Vietnamese minority in Cambodia 
and along the Cambodian Vietnamese border could 
again arise. 
Laos-China. A final border area of some interest is 
that which divides Laos and China. At present this 
area is calm and hopefully will remain so. During the 
Indochina conflict, China, the USSR, and the Pahet 
Lao worked closely together. Despite the efforts of the 
United States, aided by its tribal allies in the moun-
tains of Xieng Ithuang and Nam Tha in northern Laos, 
Communist forces consistently advanced, supplied 
overland by Chinese trucks. After 1975 Laos quickly 
was drawn into Vietnam's political orbit. As a satellite 
state hosting some 40,000 Vietnamese troops, Laos 
after 1979 expressed the same hostility towards China 
as did Vietnam. Vietnam responded by arming and 
training highland rebels. Indeed, many tribal guerrillas 
who formerly had fought for the United States now 
rallied to a cause supported by Beijing. China's sup-
port for such movements has ceased, and currently 
significant efforts are underway to develop a trade and 
communications infrastructure that will link south-
west China to the sea through Laos and Vietnam. 
Tribal rebels these days operate, as far as is known, 
without the support of-any major government, 
financed by opium sales and by fund transfers from 
relatives in the United States. If the Vientiane govern-
ment demonstrates interest in assuring development 
equity for the highlands, respects minority cultural 
rights, and assures land title to upland farmers, the 
Laos-China border area may become a new develop-
ment growth pole in the future. Failure to carefully 
negotiate the mutual interests of the government in 
Vientiane and minority highlands in the north could 
ignite further conflict between the lowland Lao and 
the Hmong, Mien, and Lao in this sensitive border 
region. 
Ideological Conflicts 
Of the five Leninist regimes current functioning in 
today's world�China, North Korea, Cuba, Laos, and 
Vietnam�two are situated in Southeast Asia. What-
ever the threat of the expansion of Communism may 
have been in the past, it is certainly clear that this 
threat does not exist in Southeast Asia today. Laos, a 
workers' state with precious few industrial workers, 
generates most of its meager foreign income by sell-
ing electricity to Thailand. Overseeing the poorest, 
least developed, most remote country in Southeast 
Asia, the present and previous Lao administrations 
have experienced considerable difficulty in governing 
their highly diverse populations, much less in interfer-
ing in the affairs of other nations. Vietnam is clearly in 
the process of reintegrating itself into the East Asian 
economy. Vietnam is receiving considerable foreign 
investment, manages its infrastructure with demon-
strable talent in the face of meager resources, and 
shows every indication of an economic recovery from 
the policy disasters of 15 years ago (Jamieson, 1993; 
373). In sum, the end of ideology as a factor in 
national conflict can clearly be perceived in Southeast 
Asia today. But this situation hardly portends "the end 
of history," about which so much has been written in 
recent years. Indeed, it is the burden of history, and 
not of ideology, which has driven the ethnic enmities, 
national disputes, and international conflicts that have 
beset this region during the current century. 
Conclusion 
Given the expanse and complexity of the Southeast 
Asian geographical region it would be impossible to 
recount all the past, present, and possible ethnic 
distinctions, rivalries, and disputes in this region. I 
have mentioned a few areas of-concern and noted that 
124 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
environmental/highland-lowland, ethnic, religious, 
border area, and ideological concerns have in the past 
driven the engine of ethnic conflict in Southeast Asia. 
Ethnic divisions and incipient tensions exist every-
where in the world. The management of such conflicts 
is part-and-parcel of the business of government and 
increasingly the concern of a unipoIar international 
community. In the recent past agencies representing 
world powers have intentionally inflamed and exacer-
bated such tensions in the process of furthering the 
short term strategic concerns of their national capitals. 
The consequences of such actions are sometimes trag-
edies writ in Homeric proportions. Did such involve-
ment occur in the physical annihilation of the 
Indonesian Communist Party? Did the massacres of 
Vietnamese civilians living in Cambodia in 1970 at 
the birth of the Khmer Republic occur in a political 
and strategic vacuum in the context of the Vietnam 
war? Some 70,000 tribal La9tians currently reside in 
the state of California; what conundrum of political 
and social policies conspired to transport so remote a 
people to so alien and unfamiliar a land? 
Governments have often endeavored to build national 
consensus on the basis of majority ethnic loyalty and/ 
or justify foreign adventures on the basis of threats to 
ethnic security or purity. The exacerbation of what 
anthropologist Clifford Geertz has termed "primordial 
sentiments" by agencies skilled at the manipulation of 
media and the mobilization of mass organizations has 
often unleashed forces difficult to subsequently con-
trol (Geertz, 1973; 259-269). The modern history of 
Southeast Asia is rife with examples of such manipu-
lation of ethnic passions. In the wake of the Cold War, 
somewhat more evenhanded concerns for human 
rights are already emerging. That differences in ethnic 
identity, religious affiliation, ideological persuasion, 
or linguistic preference obtain in Southeast Asia is 
fundamental to the local social landscape. Southeast 
Asians have formed nation-states of "imagined com-
munities" on the bases of colonial entities erected on 
the ruins of ancient civilizations (Anderson; 1991). 
The same passions that inflamed modern European 
nations 100 years ago (or that are presently at work in 
the Balkans) are liable to remain potentially threaten-
ing in the relative young national entities of Southeast 
Asia. 
Although it would be easy to suggest that the Govern-
ment of the United States follow a strict policy of non-
involvement in overseas ethnic disputes, such is not 
my view. If the United States were to be totally unin-
volved, then major rescue operations such as that 
in Somalia or refugee efforts such as that on the 
Thailand-Cambodia border in 1979 would have been 
of no concern to the American public. Given the 
uniquely threatening nature of ethnic disputes and 
controversies, there is no choice but to actively moni-
tor and to intervene positively where necessary. Inter-
vention in the cause of the exacerbation of ethnic 
conflict should never be justified. Intervention, as we 
have seen in the recent case of Congressional action 
on East Timor, can serve as a wake-up call to govern-
ments that once could cavalierly dismiss overseas 
concerns about internal repression as the remonstra-
tions of the political periphery. The nature of such 
positive intervention might take the form of channel-
ing foreign aid to rural regions with wide disparities in 
household income or constraining trade opportunities 
for governments deemed repressive and insensitive to 
ethnic minority demands. Support could be provided 
for indigenous NGOs equipped to mediate disputes 
and negotiate issues that obtain between opposing 
groups. The most important contribution developed 
countries can make to the amelioration of tension 
between ethnic groups is to address issues of social 
inequality, which so often are the root cause of con-
flicts and clashes. If a mountain tribal people is 
awarded rights to permanent agricultural land, if 
schools are built for minority children and clinics are 
built to address urgent health needs, and if roadways 
are constructed to facilitate commerce, then the root 
cause of resentment and rebellion will be effectively 
addressed. Resources that once were invested in heavy 
armaments might in the present circumstance best be 
invested in the tasks of reducing infant mortality, 
enhancing family incomes, and facilitating equity in 
national development in Southeast Asia. With 
resources currently at hand, the tragedies of the past 
need not necessarily serve as prologue for the future. 
Understanding the past role of intelligence agencies in 
directly influencing the ethnic conflicts during the 
125 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Cold War will undoubtedly be of some help in formu-
lating future policies and plans. Until recently, access 
to sensitive records on such subjects was extremely 
restricted. Next year information on developments 
over the past 30 years in Indochina and Indonesia 
should be much more readily available. A clear vision 
of the future will most probably be enhanced by an 
objective and unbiased understanding of the recent 
past. Perhaps before long we shall learn much more 
about the role of foreign intelligence agencies in the 
generation of clandestine tribal armies in northern 
Laos, in the overthrow of the Cambodian monarchy in 
1970, and in the assumption of power of a Western-
oriented military regime in Indonesia. As events have 
often proven, the short run triumphs of political tacti-
cians can sometimes result in the ruin of long-term 
strategic plans (i.e. Iran). Scholarly investigation of 
the past may prove to be of more than passing utility 
in charting the future.

Summary of Discussion 
General Discussion 
DR. WDCMAN: I would like to make two comments. 
First, I think that we need to keep in mind that our 
analysis is colored by our own Anglo-American or 
Western ethnic perspective and that it affects the way 
in which we perceive the rest of the world geopoliti-
cally. Second, with regard to the hierarchical context 
that Dr. Gladney discussed, I think one has to recog-
nize that context is key to our understanding on the 
international and political level as well. When people 
ask someone if they are Uzbek, the answer is yes. 
When they ask them if they are Central Asian, the�
answer is yes. When they ask them if they are Muslim, 
the answer is yes. It all depends on the set of-circum-
stances, the context. In one case, these groups will 
fight each other; and in another, they will fight 
together against the "outsider." I think one of the 
problems in making foreign policy is that often we 
focus on the local level and miss the bigger picture. 
One issue that we need to take into account when 
making foreign policy is that, although two groups 
may hate each other, if we get involved, they may be 
drawn together against us. 
DR. GLADNEY: Yes, the old proverb that I referred 
to earlier, "You and I against each other, you and me 
against my brother, my brother and I against our cous-
ins, our cousins and I against you," articulates such a 
hierarchy. I am very uncomfortable with this whole 
discourse on tribalism. The notion of the tribe was 
basically refuted 60 years ago. Now, suddenly, it is 
back. A simplistic interpretation of the notion can lead 
to misunderstanding. For example, many assume that 
the Soviet Union somehow held back these ethnic ten-
sions, and now, with the Soviets out, these tensions 
have bubbled to the surface. In fact, in many cases�
such as the Tajik versus the Uzbek or the Uzbek ver-
sus the Uighur�the Soviets created the divisions and 
ethnic conflicts between groups who are essentially 
very similar peoples. Scholars and analysts need to 
look at the historical processes and historical contin-
gencies. As anthropologists, we are always looking in 
terms of context-1�when, where, why, and how�and 
are not drawing these broad generalities. 
QUESTION: Would you comment on the issues of the 
potential for the rise of Southern Chinese nationalism? 
DR. GLADNEY: There is the potential for an enor-
mous shift of focus in terms of our understanding of 
China as Hong Kong becomes the issue of the late 
1990s. I am not saying Cantonese separatism is going 
to pull China apart, but I am saying that a strong feel-
ing of difference exists in the south, and the politics of 
difference are becoming very important for China's 
domestic future. We have tended to focus on border 
minorities, yet, when I travel in China, I find that the 
Chinese are not worried about the Tibetans or 
Uighur�they are concerned that the Cantonese are 
getting rich and that they can buy their country three 
times over, and they are worried about those people 
who are poor and who keep coming into our city tak-
ing all their jobs�this whole issue of floating popula-
tion. The government can no longer say, "Hey, keep 
these differences at bay because we have the Soviets, 
the Americans, or the Japanese to worry about." I pre-
dict that these local level conflicts will become more 
important. 
QUESTION: I'm puzzled by two seemingly contra-
dictory trends in China. One is an increased economy 
and international trade, which appears to imply peace-
ful pursuits, and the other is an increased military, 
including substantial offensive capabilities. How do 
these fit together? 
DR. GLADNEY: It is a very complex situation, and, in 
my opinion, the whole issue has to be framed in terms 
of this post�Cold War society. China no longer sees 
itself in opposition to the Soviets. It is interested much 
more in microlevel issues. The economic aspects of 
this drive a lot of these issues, particularly China's rela-
tionship with the Middle Fast in terms of exporting 
military hardware. But I think also the issue is a feeling 
of internal insecurity. During the Tiananmen Square 
incident, there was a rumor that the military was not 
obeying the leadership's orders to crack down on pro-
testers. Since then, and I referred to this in my paper, 
the government has reorganized the military, fired gen-
erals, and tried to put more loyal people in their places.

However, many of them have regional loyalties that 
Beijing can no longer trust. The economic discrepan-
cies between the south and east, on the one hand, and 
the north and west, on the other, are extraordinary. You 
have the Fourth World and First World side by side in 
one country. The people in the south are becoming 
very tired of carrying the north. I think Hong Kong 
may be an issue. I think, in some ways, a military 
buildup may be also for domestic concerns. I do not 
think people have focused on that issue. 
COMMENT: Dr. Crystal, when you spoke of Cambo-
dia, you focused mostly on the anti�Vietnamese senti-
ment. What are your thoughts on the country's other 
ethnic problems? 
DR. CRYSTAL: The animosity toward the Vietnam-
ese remains the most significant source of ethnic ten-
sion. Hopefully, this tortured land will have some time 
to reconstitute its policy. The Vietnamese have with-
drawn, the United States seems to have played a 
benign role during this recent election, and the UN 
peacekeeping force was a success�despite the pre-
diction of most everyone. Hopefully, we can look for-
ward to a time when these inflamed ethnic passions 
will subside.

Evolving Ethnicity in South Asia 
With Particular Reference to India 
Joseph E. Schwartzberg 
Professor of Geography 
University of Minnesota 
Introduction 
The following survey of evolving South Asian ethnic-
ity generally supports the position of Paul Brass 
(1991, p. 8), who asserts that: 
. .. ethnicity and nationalism are not 'givens' but are 
social and political constructions. They are creations 
of elites, who draw upon, distort, and sometimes fab-
ricate materials from the cultures of the groups they 
wish to represent in order to protect their well-being 
or existence or to gain political and economic advan-
tage for their groups, as well as for themselves. 
[Further] ethnicity and nationalism are modern phe-
nomena inseparably connected with the modern cen-
tralizing state. 
I would attach more importance than Brass does, how-
ever, to the so-called primordial loyalties that inhere 
in one's birth. While these may not be immutable giv-
ens, they do represent a reservoir of cultural identifiers 
from which elites can draw as they assess specific 
political situations and make a calculus of the costs 
and benefits of seeking to elicit particular types of 
support. Among these identifiers are caste, religion, 
sect (which may be locally important, but which I can-
not explore in this brief paper), language, dialect (also 
not discussed), and regional loyalty. Birth within a 
particular group does matter. Cultural norms may be 
plastic, but they are not putty, to be molded at will. 
They are potent and they tend to endure. Hence, politi-
cians can go only so far in reshaping ethnic identities. 
I would also stress more than Brass and other political 
commentators do the importance of geographic are-
nas. I repeatedly refer in this paper to changes in polit-
ical boundaries and show that the political actors 
thrown together within the administrative limits of 
any newly reconfigured country or state adjust their 
ethnic agendas accordingly. They base them not only 
on their own social and economic interests seen in iso-
lation but also on their perceptions of the interests of 
others in the same arena with whom they must com-
pete for limited political assets. Ethnic groups have 
sought to advance their interests by a wide variety of 
means. These include the formation and support of 
political parties and other organizations; selective sup-
port for nonethnic political parties and sympathetic 
candidates; discriminatory legislation when an ethnic 
group controls the government at a particular level; 
and, when the group is out of power, propaganda, 
strikes, demonstrations, economic boycotts, and so 
forth. Groups may also deliberately resort to the use of 
force, even to the point of large-scale insurrection. 
More often, however, violence occurs when confron-
tations with other groups or with the government get 
out of control. Violence has, in fact, at times marked 
virtually every type of ethnic movement discussed in 
this paper and has repeatedly affected every major 
region and virtually every state of India, as well as the 
other countries of South Asia (figure 9). 
The Government of India has responded to the politi-
cal demands of ethnic groups in ways no less varied 
than those used by the groups themselves. On numer-
ous occasions, as in regard to state reorganization and 
the demand for quotas, it has bowed to organized pub-
lic pressures. At the other extreme, it has often 
resorted to the use of substantial force, especially in 
dealing with secessionist movements in its border 
regions, whether they be of tribals in the northeast or 
Sikhs or 1Cashmiris in the northwest. Between these 
extremes, numerous options existed. At times the gov-
ernment successfully co-opted the leadership of spe-
cific groups, made expedient compromises with them, 
or acquiesced in their control over local polities, pro-
vided they did not transcend certain limits. Alterna-
tively, the central government has used its substantial 
control over fiscal resources and other economic 
levers to gain favor or punish dissent; it has also inter-
fered in numerous ways in local politics�a cause of 
particular alienation in the case of Kashmir�declar-
ing certain groups and activities illegal, jailing dissi-
dents, and frequently suspending the elected

legislative assembly and imposing President's or Gov-
ernor's Rule. 
The potential for serious and enduring damage to 
existing polities from ethnically rooted violence, both 
intranationally and internationally, is great and 
appears to be increasing. From 1972 to 1980, India 
experienced serious ethnic violence in 67 percent of 
all months, and South Asia as a whole experienced 
such violence in 95 percent of all months. For the 
period 1981 to 1990, the figures rose to 94 percent and 
100 percent for India and South Asia, respectively. 
From an ethnic perspective, South Asia is arguably the 
most complex and one of the most turbulent regions of 
our planet. Its political map is far from frozen. One 
may safely anticipate a number of changes in the fore-
seeable future, many of which will be driven by agen-
das of specific ethnic groups. Whatever these changes 
may be, they will, in turn, surely give rise to new 
manipulations of ethnic identities to suit the needs of 
new situations. 
This presentation considers the various historical pro-
cesses that have shaped ethnic identities in South 
Asia, concentrating, because of limitations of time and 
space, on India and on the postindependence period. It 
also discusses specific bases for establishing ethnic 
identities and the periods, situations, and locales in 
which they assumed importance. It also notes the 
means by which ethnic groups seek to advance their 
interests and by which governments respond to such 
efforts. I shall not, however, strive for completeness�
the topic is simply too vast. Omitted from consider-
ation here is any discussion of ethnic relations in 
Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. Even for India, I 
shall do no more than touch lightly on the two most 
troublesome contemporary ethnic problems: the Sikh 
struggle for an independent Khalistan and the com-
plex struggle in Kashmir being waged simultaneously 
by forces seeking independence, on the one hand, or 
merger with Pakistan on the other. Virtually all the 
empirical data that I shall be presenting are drawn 
from the updated 1992 edition of the Historical Atlas 
of South Asia, which synthesizes information from a 
multitude of sources, only a small part of which are 
noted in the bibliography accompanying this paper. 
Although the interpretations of those data are my own, 
I doubt that any are wholly original. 
Processes of Ethnic Identity Formulation 
Birth into a particular group still matters far more in 
South Asia than it does in areas of other major civili-
zations. One is expected to be "true to one's salt"; 
one's essence and traditions are all determined by 
birth. 
Jati, which generally connotes caste, translates liter-
ally as birth. One is born into a particular caste in 
accordance with one's karma�the net merit or 
demerit of actions performed in previous existences. If 
one properly follows in the present life the forms of 
behavior appropriate to caste status, one may aspire to 
rebirth in a higher caste. This axiomatic belief forms 
the essence of Hindu dhartna, which may be trans-
lated either as duty or religion. These observations are 
made with specific reference to Hinduism but are 
equally applicable to Buddhism and Jainism. The 
behavioral norms on which they are based have 
strongly influenced communities of other coexisting 
faiths of South Asia as well, even Muslims, for whom 
the very notion of caste is theoretically anathema. For 
example, few Indian Muslims, before the creation of 
Pakistan, would have hesitated to identify the social 
group to which they belonged by a name that would 
conjure up in the minds of their non-Muslim neigh-
bors a particular caste-defined set of roles and a spe-
cific genre de vie. 
For most South Asians and for most of the region's 
history, caste was the principal referent of one's place 
in society. The vast majority of the population lived in 
villages in which their appropriate social and eco-
nomic roles were rooted primarily in caste. Social and 
intellectual horizons in such a setting were typically 
very limited, and political action, such as it was, was 
generally confined to a narrow spatial arena. Affairs of 
state were the domain of small classes of elite. 
Although the encompassing sacred realm of Bharat, or 
India, found a place in the consciousness of Hindus, 
communal activities at an all-India level were nonex-
istent. At a regional level, devotion to the cult of a par-
ticular deity or to a saintly figure and participation in 
major fairs and pilgrimages did provide some feeling 
132 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
of community, but the sensed bonds of religion, I 
would argue, were generally weaker, at least among 
Hindus, than were those of caste. 
The unification of India under ,the British and the 
accelerating expansion, thereafter, of the transporta-
tion and communications network, literacy, the press, 
and notions of democratic governance brought about a 
number of important changes in the way that people 
saw themselves and in their patterns of interaction. 
While identification with and loyalty to one's caste 
remained important, other social attributes became 
increasingly salient as wider arenas of economic and 
political interaction were established. New, more-or-
less Westernized commercial and bureaucratic elites 
came into being. Although they were mainly Hindu, 
these new elites drew also froth other religious com-
munities and from many linguistic regions. In some 
situations, especially after the creation of the Indian 
National Congress in 1885, they formed the nucleus 
for an emerging PanIndian, nontraditional, national-
ism. In other contexts, however, socially and cultur-
ally defined groups vied with one another for privilege 
and power. Thus, in addition to their caste and reli-
gious identities, many Indians became increasingly 
aware of regional attachments that were previously 
only dimly sensed within areas dominated by a partic-
ular language or dialect. The range of politically rele-
vant primordial loyalties�those that form the basis 
for what we now recognize as ethnicity�was 
expanded accordingly. In a sense, then, we may say 
that one's identity�or jati�today means much more 
than caste alone. 
The British rulers recognized the latent potential for 
disunity inherent in the social and cultural complexity 
of the subcontinent, and they responded fitfully and 
often grudgingly to Indian demands for greater control 
over their own destinies. In each of a series of major 
constitutional reforms, such as the Indian Councils 
Act of 1909 and the Governmeht of India Acts of 
1919 and 1935, they acknowledged the claims of spe-
cific minorities to separate electorates to guarantee 
some semblance of fair representation in the evolving 
legislative apparatus. At first only the Muslim popula-
tion was accorded special recognition. Subsequently, 
concomitant with an expanding franchise, elected 
seats were reserved also for Sikhs, Indian Christians, 
Anglo-Indians, Europeans, and Scheduled Castes as 
well as for such special interests as Indian commerce 
and industry, European commerce, landholders, labor, 
and even women. Whether the course adopted was an 
attempt to gradually establish a liberal representative 
democracy or a cynical policy of "divide and con-
quer" depends on whose version of history one 
chooses to believe. In any event, a policy of recogniz-
ing the en bloc claims of particular constituencies to a 
share of the political pie was set firmly in place, 
thereby reinforcing ethnic sensitivities. 
The establishment of quotas remains a part of the 
political modus operandi to this day, although the 
rules for fixing quotas varied from one context to 
another. Some quotas are in strict proportion to popu-
lation. Depressed groups�officially designated 
"Scheduled Castes" and "Scheduled Tribes"�are 
guaranteed certain numbers of seats in national and 
state legislatures, of positions in various lower and 
middle levels of government employment, and of 
acceptances to institutions of higher education. Rules 
of this type are institutionalized in the Constitutions of 
India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh. Other informal quo-
tas for places on party tickets, for participation in state 
and provincial ministries, or for a share of the eco-
nomic largess over which certain agencies of govern-
ment have control, are more flexible and situation-
specific. These informal quotas are often determined 
by deals made by party bosses in response to promises 
of support or various pressures by specific groups. 
Institutionalized religious quotas are presently 
unthinkable within the secular democracy of India, but 
the Muslim voting bloc�roughly one-ninth of the 
total Indian electorate and much more than that in sev-
eral regions�retains an informal claim to a share of 
power. In Pakistan the small Ahmadiya sect, which 
the Constitution has declared to be outside the pale of 
Islam, has been allotted reserved seats in both the 
national and provincial legislatures, as have other 
minorities and women. 
133 
Sociocultural identities in South Asia have never been 
fixed. The corporate mobility of particular groups, 
some ascending and others descending in the local 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
social hierarchy,, has been abundantly documented. So 
too has been the frequent creation of new groups 
through fission of older ones and the less common 
amalgamation or fusion of-groups when that suited a 
particular purpose. While these processes have oper-
ated since ancient times, the pace of change has accel-
erated greatly over the past century. Many new forms 
of identity have been socially, and often deliberately, 
constructed in response to the evolving corporate 
agendas of would-be players on the political stage. 
The institutionalization of-democracy and the atten-
dant politicization of more and more previously inert 
groups underlie these changes. Clever politicians have 
recognized that "pushing the right buttons" to elicit 
some sort of ethnically rooted response�whether 
based on religion, language, caste, tribal affiliation, or 
regional sentiment�was the most efficacious way of--
attracting a following and attaining power. Temporary 
alliances of convenience with others playing the same 
game were often established. This strategy was espe-
cially common in regions where few persons held 
deep ideological convictions. 
Types of Ethnic Identity in the 20th Century 
Emergent Nationalism 
Two political parties acted as the vehicle for the 
expression of emergent Nationalism during the pre-
independence period. The creation of the Indian 
National Congress in 1885 was an outcome of a newly 
nascent Indian nationalism. The Congress quickly 
became the principal Pan-Indian vehicle for the free-
dom struggle. When the Muslim League came into 
being in 1906, however, it embarked on a more paro-
chial course. It set its agenda as much by its percep-
tions of the likely effects of Congress activities on the 
welfare of India's Muslim community as on its views 
of the British raj. Not surprisingly, the League vacil-
lated between periods of cooperation with the Con-
gress and periods of fierce opposition to it. As powers 
were devolved toward the provinces, the importance 
of success in electoral contests gradually widened the 
rift between the, two parties. Yet it was not until 1940 
that the die was irrevocably cast in favor of establish-
ing a separate state for India's Muslim community. 
The requisite ethnic rationale invented for that state 
was Muhammad Ali Jinnah's "two-nation" theory. It 
was the idea that India's population consisted essen-
tially of a Hindu nation and a Muslim nation whose 
core identities and goals were so fundamentally differ-
ent that there was no hope that they could coexist 
within a single independent state without serious 
adverse consequences for the Muslim minority. In 
1947, Jinnah's dream of-an independent Pakistan was 
fulfilled. At the same time, the Congress dream of a 
secular, all-embracing Indian nation was shattered. 
Partition and the massive population transfers that fol-
lowed still left roughly a third of South Asia's Mus-
lims in India; this concentration continues to provide a 
basis for ethnic tensions. The more than 100 million 
Muslims in India today constitute by far the world's 
largest ethnic minority. Few parts of the country are 
without a significant Muslim presence. Within the 
Indian-held portion of the disputed state of Jammu 
and Kashmir, Muslims form a substantial majority. 
The dispute over Kashmir has been the cause of two 
wars between India and Pakistan, and the area also fig-
ured prominently in the war that led to the indepen-
dence of Bangladesh. Within Kashmir a bitter 
multisided insurrection is now in progress as some 
separatists seek an independent state and others union 
with Pakistan. Sustained Indo-Pakistani enmity peri-
odically makes life precarious for India's Muslims 
despite the country's constitutional commitment to a 
secular state with religious liberty for all. 
Muslims, of course, are not the only significant reli-
gious minority in India. Five of India's 25 states have 
Sikh, Christian, or animistic majorities (figure 10), 
and, with the exception of the mainly tribal state of 
Arunachal Pradesh in the far northeast, all have been 
scenes of bitter ethnic struggles in the postindepen-
dence period. The most intense of these struggles is 
that of Punjab's Sikhs for an independent Khalistan, 
waged intermittently since 1981. The present period is 
one of relative quiescence, but the problem remains 
unresolved. I shall defer till later discussion of the eth-
nic struggles of several tribal regions.

Linguistic Affiliation as an Organizing Principle 
Language, formerly of relatively little political impor-
tance, has since 1947 emerged as a potent political 
force in Hindu-majority areas despite the lingering 
role of religion as an aspect of ethnicity in postparti-
tion. As a matter of organizational convenience, the 
Congress Party, beginning with Bihar in 1908, began 
to organize itself into linguistic provinces, even 
though most of the provinces of British India and sev-
eral of the larger princely states were multilingual 
entities. It was not until 1920, however, that the Con-
gress Party established linguistic units throughout 
British India and made the creation of linguistic 
administrative provinces a plank in its platform for 
political reform. As Congress saw it, the arbitrariness 
of the political map that resulted from the unplanned 
history of British territorial acquisition in India was an 
affront to the natural aspirations of-India's major lin-
guistic groups. In any event, the call for linguistic 
provinces was overshadowed as an issue by the more 
inclusive agenda of Gandhi's noncooperation move-
ment. Conceivably, an unstated motive in the Con-
gress Party's call for linguistic provinces was to divert 
popular attention away from communally based poli-
tics. 
The first postindependence demand for a linguistic 
state came from Telugu speakers, the largest among 
several major minorities in the then Tamil-dominated 
state of Madras. The demands persisted, and Congress 
conceded by establishing the new Telugu-speaking 
state of Andhra in 1954. This opened the floodgates to 
calls for additional states based on linguistic criteria. 
The government then established a States Reorganiza-
tion Commission to study the problem, and ultimately 
the States Reorganization Act of 1956 led to a radical 
redrawing of the political map. The 1956 Act, how-
ever, failed to divide the essentially bilingual state of 
Bombay and the putatively bilingual state of Punjab. 
These intentional departures from the new linguistic 
state norms were short lived. Bombay was partitioned 
in 1960 to form the Marathi-speaking state of-Maha-
rashtra and the Gujarati-speaking state of Gujarat. In 
1966, Punjab was also partitioned, allegedly on a lin-
guistic basis, but in actuality on communal grounds; 
when the government acceded to the Sikh demands 
for a reconfigured Punjab, the reduced area of-the new 
state was one in which Sikhs became an absolute 
majority. Figure 11 reveals the extensive changes 
wrought by linguistic reorganization over the period 
1951-72. 
The government's conciliatory attitude in regard to 
linguistic reorganization did not mollify linguistic 
groups sufficiently to guarantee their loyalty to the 
Union government. Within Madras, in particular, a 
demand arose for an independent Dravidian nation�
sometimes dubbed "Dravidistan"�to comprise the 
four new linguistic states in which Dravidian lan-
guages were spoken. As matters transpired, the three 
other Dravidian states of South India showed rela-
tively little enthusiasm for a Tamil-led Dravidian 
nation, and the movement lost its momentum. But one 
lasting outcome was the rise to power of the Dravida 
Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), a Tamilian ethnic party 
established in 1949. Alone or at the head of-a multi-
party coalition, the DMK has ruled Madras, or Tamil 
Nadu as it was renamed in 1969, for all but six years 
since it first came to power in 1967. Arguably, the pru-
dent willingness of the Congress Party to allow ethni-
cally minded Tamil politicians to enjoy the rewards of 
power did as much as the lack of separatist ardor in 
neighboring Dravidian states to blunt secessionist 
demands. Had the movement succeeded, it would 
almost certainly have led to the Balkanization of 
India. 
Demands for reorganizing the political map of inde-
pendent India were not all rooted in linguistic con-
sciousness. Several newly created linguistic states 
contained regions that lagged notably behind others in 
levels of economic and social development. As a rule, 
areas that had formed a part of British India were gen-
erally more advanced than those previously ruled by 
the less progressive princes, such-as the Nizam of 
Hyderabad. Regions lagging behind the political core 
areas of the states to which they were joined soon 
sensed that the state was not doing enough to rectify 
the ill-effects of past neglect. This, in turn, led to sev-
eral demands for separation, fueled by local politi-
cians who sought to harness local discontent as the 
vehicle for furthering their own political ambitions. To 
what extent those politicians and their followers were

able to construct a regional sense of ethnicity cannot 
readily be determined, but none of these attempts to 
achieve a separate state succeeded. 
Another outcome of states reorganization was the 
escalation of what have been called "nativistic" move-
ments. In such movements the dominant linguistic 
group of a particular state, styling themselves as "sons 
of the soil," sought, by a combination of legal mea-
sures, intimidation, and violence, to limit the opportu-
nities of immigrant groups from other states�and 
sometimes of indigenous Muslims as well�and, in 
some instances, to create legal obstacles to their settle-
ment. The strongest of these movements were in 
Assam and Maharashtra. 
Tribal and Caste-Based Ethnicity 
A number of tribal groups who aspired either to state-
hood within the Indian union or to full independence 
were disregarded in the initial phase of the linguistic 
reorganization. In the mineral-rich Chhota Nagpur, in 
the northeast of peninsular India, tribals had estab-
lished a forerunner of the present-day Jharkhand Party 
as early as 1939. The party has campaigned intermit-
tently for a tribal state since the parliamentary elec-
tions of 1957. Other groups, most notably the Nagas 
and later the Mizos along India's northeastern borders, 
resorted to armed rebellion. Many among these fron-
tier tribals were Christians, almost all spoke languages 
unrelated to the major languages of the states in which 
they lived, and very few had reason to fuel a deep 
sense of loyalty to India. Their struggles were at times 
abetted by foreign Christian groups as well as by Pald-
stan and China, all of which provided them with moral 
and/or material support. 
The Indian Government's attitude in dealing with 
tribal demands was generally less conciliatory than it 
was in respect to other ethnic groups. Ultimately, 
however, through a combination of military suppres-
sion, co-optation of compliant leaders, and other tac-
tics, accommodations were reached with elements of 
each of the rebellious frontier groups, and many new, 
tribally dominated administrative units�either union 
territories or fullfledged states�were established. The 
much more numerous, but also more pacific, tribal 
groups, however, continue to find their political aspi-
rations frustrated. 
The role of caste in the postindependence period has 
changed considerably. In the past, power at the local 
level was typically shared by the dominant landhold-
ing group and the ritually supreme Brahmans. Each 
group legitimized the role of the other in its appropri-
ate sphere. With the coming of democracy, however, 
numbers, rather than ritual ascendancy or other claims 
to elite status, became increasingly important determi-
nants of power. Throughout India, at all levels of gov-
ernment and across the political spectrum, parties 
appealed to particular types of caste constituencies to 
gain support. Local magnates�believed to control 
large "vote banks" of their caste followers�offered 
their support to specific parties in return for a place on 
the ballot. Single castes rarely composed an absolute 
majority of the electorate; alliances among various 
caste groups were therefore common. 
Anti-Brahmanism had become a potent political force 
in some regions even in the preindependence period. 
The appeal of Charan Singh to a wide spectrum of 
middle-level peasant castes over much of the Hindi-
speaking area of India was a key factor in catapulting 
the Janata Party to power in 1978, following the 
period of emergency rule initiated by Indira Gandhi in 
1975. The desire for empowerment among middle-
level groups found expression during the period of 
Janata rule in the creation of the Mandal Commission, 
which drew up a report in 1982 suggesting a new set 
of quotas for the numerically strong so-called Other 
Backward Castes (OBCs) similar to those that the 
Constitution already guaranteed to Scheduled Castes 
and Scheduled Tribes. Although the Janata Party did 
not remain in power long enough to implement the 
provisions of the Commission's report, the decision to 
do so by a new National Front government in 1990 
touched off a wave of violent protest over large parts 
of India and contributed to the government's collapse 
shortly thereafter. 
Below the OBCs in India's social hierarchy are the 
Scheduled Castes, formerly untouchables, who com-
pose roughly a sixth of the nation's total population. 
Their struggle for equality before the law and for 
humane treatment by traditionally superior groups has 
138 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
been a difficult one, reminiscent in many ways of the 
American civil rights movement in respect to blacks. 
In some parts of India, especially Bihar, the peas-
antry�for whom the Scheduled Castes mainly work 
as landless laborers�have responded with incredible 
brutality to attempts by Scheduled Castes to better 
their lot. In other areas, most notably Maharashtra, 
large numbers of the group have adopted a new ethnic 
identity by conversion to Buddhism, employing a 
social dynamic comparable to that of the Black Mus-
lim movement among blacks in America. Other Hari-
jans have been converting to Islam. 
Hindu Nationalism 
Hindu ethnicity sank roots even before the turn of the 
present century. Within the Congress Party there 
emerged the powerful conservative voice of a Marathi 
Brahman, Bal Gangadhar Tilak, who perceived in the 
increasing Westernization of India's elite the seeds of 
the destruction of Hindu culture. He sought, some-
times violently, to oppose the British presence. No 
less conservative in some respects, but far more toler-
ant of non-Hindu perspectives, was Mohandas Gan-
dhi. Gandhi's commitment to nonviolence and his 
fruitful collaboration with the liberal and secular-
minded Jawaharlal Nehru lessened the following for 
Tilak's brand of Hindu nationalism for decades but 
could hardly extinguish its appeal. Even before Tilak's 
death in 1920, Hindu nationalism was institutionalized 
in various guises, beginning with the Hindu Mahas-
abha, founded in 1907 in part as a reaction to the cre-
ation of the Muslim League. Although never posing a 
serious challenge to Congress, the Mahasabha was 
particularly influential in the period before and just 
after partition in fomenting anti-Muslim activities and 
in giving credibility to Jinnalis aforementioned two-
nation theory. Also noteworthy is the militant and fas-
cistic Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (National Vol-
unteer Association), one of whose members 
assassinated Gandhi in 1948. Founded in 1925, it 
remains a potent force, especially in Maharashtra, the 
region of its inception. 
Despite their high visibility and local prominence, no 
Hindu nationalist party in the postindependence 
period even came close to gaining control over any 
state legislature, not to mention Parliament, until 
1990. The Bharatiya Jan Sangh, however, gained 
heightened respectability by being admitted into the 
hodgepodge anti-Congress Janata coalition that swept 
to power in 1977. The period 1990-91 witnessed a 
dramatic rise in the strength of the Bharatiya Janata 
Party (BJP), successor to the Jan Sangh. This was 
especially marked in India's conservative Hindi heart-
land. 
Some observers of the Indian political scene anticipate 
that the BM' will be able to form the next government, 
either alone or at the head of a new anti-Congress coa-
lition. The changed fortunes of the Hindu nationalists 
may be attributed to a variety of factors. Among them 
are the termination of the Nehru family dynasty, the 
decline in public confidence in the long-ruling and 
increasingly corrupt and scandal-ridden Congress 
Party, and the failure of any other ideologically based 
party to win the allegiance of a major segment of dis-
enchanted Congress supporters. No less important has 
been the BJP's ability to project the sense that it stands 
for the true India. It appeals mainly to the landed, 
albeit nonelite, segments of the rural population and to 
the lower middle class of the urban population. Nei-
ther of these groups has previously enjoyed a large 
share of political power over any sustained period. 
Implicit in the appeal of the BJP is a certain rejection 
of Western influences, along with a generous dose of 
anti-Islamic sentiment vis-a-vis both Pakistan's and 
India's own Muslim population. 
The BJP's cynical exploitation of popular Hindu emo-
tional sentiment in regard to the controversial destruc-
tion of a 16th-century mosque allegedly built over the 
site of Lord Rama's birth put the BJP at the center of 
public attention and was instrumental in bringing on 
the most serious wave of Hindu-Muslim communal 
violence since the period of partition. This led to the 
dismissal of BJP ministries in four states in December 
1992 and their replacement by President's Rule. (This 
is shown on figure 12.) Some commentators argue that 
the BJP leadership is more representative of the true 
India than was the Congress Party�as well as less 
corrupt�and anticipate that, once in power, the party 
will act with a considerable degree of responsibility 
and will restore stability to the nation. I am inclined to 
doubt that assessment.

Postscript 
In legislative assembly elections held in November 
1993, the BJP suffered dramatic losses in three of five 
states in which it was formerly the ruling party, 
including Uttar Predesh, India's most populous state. 
On the other hand, it bettered its formerly dominant 
position in Rajasthan and won a smashing victory in 
Delhi. To a considerable extent, BJP losses were 
reflected in Congress gains. Whether, as some observ-
ers suggest, the 1993 elections signal that the BJP tide 
has crested and begun to fall remains to be seen.

Summary of Discussion 
Discussant: Robert Stoddard 
I am going to try to achieve two things: first, integrate 
content with what Alex Murphy said yesterday about 
general principles through an illustration in South 
Asia, using Sri Lanka as an example and, second, 
build upon what Dr. Schwartzberg has said about the 
background of ethnic diversity in South Asia, but giv-
ing a slightly different prediction about India's politi-
cal future. 
The ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka is primarily between 
the Sri Lankan Tamils and the, mostly Sinhalese gov-
ernment. The Tamils want greater political control 
over their lives; therefore, they seek greater autonomy 
or even sovereignty over a specific territory. My com-
ments pertain to the controversy over the delineation 
of such an area, a territory I will call "the Tamil 
region." 
At first glance, it would seem that a map showing the 
spatial distribution of people according to their ethnic-
ity would provide a fairly objective method for draw-
ing boundaries. However, even so-called objective 
regionalization depends upon agreement about, at 
least, four conditions which involve fundamental geo-
graphic issues. These are: 
� The definition of the pertinent population. What 
constitutes membership in the ethnic group being 
regionalized is illustrated in Sri Lanka by the uncer-
tain status of those classified as Indian Tamils. 
Because the Indian Tamils have an uncertain citizen-
ship status, have been less politically active, and 
generally belong to a lower caste than the Sri Lan-
kan Tamils, they are usually omitted from the popu-
lation that defines the Tamil region. But such an 
omission is not universally accepted and, as I will 
presently show, the inclusion of Indian Tamils can 
make a difference. 
� The definition of ethnic territory. Territorial belong-
ingness is normally based upon the existence of a 
demographic majority. But in a census unit where no 
group exceeds 50 percent, a case can be made for 
defining territorial belongingness to the group hav-
ing only a plurality. In most administrative subdivi-
sions of Sri Lanka, one or another of the ethnic 
groups has a very large majority, so the potential for 
this kind of controversy is limited to only a few 
areas. But these few areas are the critical places of 
conflict and are where "ethnic cleansing" is most 
likely to occur. Even though intense fighting has 
taken place in the Tamil heartland of Jaffna, some of 
the severest suffering by noncombatants has 
occurred in the peripheral or frontier areas, where no 
ethnic group possesses a majority. 
� The size of the areal units. The real crux of the terri-
torial problem is one of scale because the homoge-
neity of a region depends upon the size of the areal 
unit that is being clustered to form a regional whole. 
� The decision about the necessity for regional conti-
guity. There is a strong argument for avoiding ethnic 
enclaves in any administrative unit. In the Sri Lan-
kan situation, it is difficult to achieve complete con-
tiguity because of the spatial distributions of the 
ethnic populations. 
Let us examine this regionalization task�that is, the 
objective delineation of a Tamil region�by looking at 
the distributions of ethnic populations at three areal 
scales. 
On the provincial level, eight of the nine Sri Lankan 
provinces have large majorities consisting of only a 
single ethnic group. Furthermore, their geographic 
arrangement does not violate the goal of contiguity 
(figure 13). In the Eastern Province, however, the larg-
est group has only a plurality. Sri Lankan Tamils, who 
have the plurality in this province, insist that it should 
be part of their region of control, even though it differs 
a little bit from the traditional historical lands. The 
government disagrees. 
If we look at the district level, the complexity of the 
territorial issue is even more evident. In over half the 
24 districts, the majority ethnic group exceeds 80 per-
cent of the population. In only three districts does the

percentage drop below 50 percent. However, the loca-
tion�and here we come into the geographic aspects 
that were emphasized by Dr. Murphy�of these three 
districts complicates the task of regionalization. Two 
of the plurality districts�Trincomalee and Amparai�
are in Eastern Province and present the same defini-
tional problem as produced by the larger provincial 
units. The third district, Nuwara Eliya, is located in 
the center of the country, where it is surrounded by 
Sinhalese majority districts. Furthermore, the ethnic 
population that holds the plurality is the Indian Tamil 
community. Therefore, if a definition of "Tamil popu-
lation" were to be expanded tp combine both the Sri 
Lankan and Indian Tamils, the resulting different eth-
nic map would produce a Tamil region having a non-
contiguous exclave. 
Minor civil divisions below the district level are too 
small for political autonomy. that does not mean, 
however, that these units cannot be used as a basis for 
a regionalization scheme. However, the spatial frag-
mentation of the Sri Lankan Tamils in the peripheral 
zone persists at this scale. In the 'Trincomalee District, 
the population residing along a narrow coastal sliver 
forms a plurality consisting of a third ethnic group�
the Moors. The geometric complexity of ethnic con-
centrations is partially solved if the Sri Lankan Tamils 
and Indian Tamils are considered as members of the 
same ethnic category because the plurality population 
of this coastal strip shifts to being Tamil. Although 
such a redefinition of the Tamil population tends to 
solve some of the problems of contiguity along the 
east coast, as noted above, it complicates the regional-
ization task in the central part of the country. 
Thus, it is evident that a major contributor to ethnic 
conflicts is the distributional pattern of contending 
populations. Also, this Sri Lankan situation reinforces 
the generalization made yesterday: the areas where 
atrocities are most likely to occur, and from which 
most refugees would originate, are the zones of ethnic 
transition between the regional core areas of the dif-
fering ethnic groups. 
Now, let me shift to the second topic which concerns 
India, where I would like to deal with a nonterritorial 
conflict. My own interests haye usually focused upon 
ethnoregionalism more than on the nonspatial inter-
class struggles for power. However, interclass strate-
gies have real implications for the Hindu nationalist 
movement. 
It is critical to note that we are dealing with two major 
perspectives on Indian nationalism, the secular and the 
Hindu. Indian secular nationalism is well illustrated 
by the leadership of Nehru, who expounded, prac-
ticed, and institutionalized the pluralistic society. 
From this perspective, the Indian nation-state is based 
upon a syncretic view of Indian culture and a federal 
system of government. All religions, all jatis, all lan-
guages, and all people within the territory of this 
country have equal opportunity under the law, accord-
ing to the Constitution. The laws of the land accom-
modate both the wishes of the majority, as expressed 
by free and democratic elections, and the rights of the 
minorities. 
In contrast, Hindu nationalists believe that the nation 
should be based not only on common culture but also 
upon the religion of Hinduism. The more extreme 
forms want to rule India as a Hindu state and rid the 
country of all non-Hindu persons and influences. The 
more benign forms of Hindu nationalism seek unity 
among the various castes and languages in India 
through the common heritage of living within a "Hin-
duized" land. 
From the perspective of the Hindu nationalists, Bud-
dhists, Jains, and Sikhs already share a more or less 
simliar sacred geography. Because of their origins, 
their holy lands are within the same Hinduized land. 
The Jews and the Parsis came from foreign areas, but, 
because these communities are small, they have not 
been a particular problem. On the other hand, Hindus 
view Christians and Muslims�with their doctrinaire 
ideas�as a problem. The nonacceptance of Muslims 
is especially strong because: 
� Muslims are associated with the invasions from 
circa 1000 to later than 1500. 
147 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
� Some Muslim leaders, insisting that Muslims belong 
to a separate nation, carved Pakistan from a "part of 
India." 
� The Indian Muslim population is large enough to 
make a significant difference. 
If the BJP were to gain national power, it is difficult to 
predict whether stability would be restored to the 
nation. But we can predict that, if the right wing of the 
Hindu nationalists should gain power, there would 
most likely be mass, even widespread, conflicts in 
areas where significant Muslim populations now live. 
A plausible scenario would be massive outmigrations 
similar to those that occurred during partition. A worst 
case scenario would be another war between India and 
Pakistan�this time with nuclear weapons. 
In spite of several conditions that can lead to conflict, 
there are strong reasons for believing that India will 
not erupt into major ethnic wars, with the possible 
exception of Kashmir. Other than Kashmir, there is 
strong evidence that India is not as ethnically volatile 
as many other regions in the world. First, note that the 
population of India exceeds all of Africa, all of Latin 
America, or all of Europe, none of which is in a single 
nation-state or single country. All these other regions 
are splintered into many states, and the people within 
each show little evidence of uniting politically. In con-
trast, even with all the diversity among the people of 
India, the nation has remained together for almost half 
a century. Furthermore, this has been accomplished 
within a mostly democratic environment again, some-
thing that has not been achieved in Third World coun-
tries in Africa or in Latin America. It also contrasts 
with the situation in Eastern Europe and the former 
Soviet Union, where ethnic feelings were suppressed 
by dictatorial governments. That success provides a 
basis for predicting that ethnic conflicts will not be 
more severe in India than elsewhere. 
A second reason for predicting fewer ethnic conflicts 
within India than in many other major world regions is 
based on the Indic culture. Maybe India's success is 
just a happenstance of outstanding secular leadership 
at the time of, and immediately after, independence 
and, therefore, will dissipate with time. Yet, secular 
nationalism does seem to have a firm foundation, 
namely the Indic culture, which has nurtured tolerance 
and has accommodated differences through the ages. 
The eclectic and nonideological nature of Hinduism 
and the other indigenous religions of South Asia cer-
tainly provides a deeply ingrained cultural propensity 
for the acceptance of differences. It is true that 
throughout most of history the people of the subconti-
nent did not live in a single political unit and that the 
various regional states did engage in fighting, but 
most conflicts did not result from the kind of major 
ideological crusade that separates people for centuries 
and produces long-lasting hatreds. 
Certainly it is in the best interest of the United States, 
as the leader of the democratic world, to support the 
forces of pluralism in South Asia. 
General Discussion 
DR. GLADNEY: I am always, and I think everybody 
is, amazed that India is still together. You mentioned 
the term success in that regard. I wonder if you could 
talk a little bit more about why this is a success, par-
ticularly considering the poverty of India, the civil 
strife, the Hindu-Muslim clashes, and the separatists 
like the Kashmiris. Why is it that keeping the country 
together is successful? 
DR. STODDARD: Maybe the term "success" is a lit-
tle bit strong, especially if we define a successful state 
as one that eliminates poverty, as well as reducing 
civil strife. And, I do not deny that the Hindu-Muslim 
clashes are just as worrisome in India as religious con-
flicts in Northern Ireland, in the Caucasus, or in Leba-
non. Furthermore, half a century may be too short a 
time to declare full success. Moreover, the durability 
of India as a state may partly reflect the lack of a 
highly politicized populace. After all, the 67 percent 
of the population that resides in rural areas live a life 
that is pretty much circumscribed by their local envi-
ronment. Although there is a rising politicization, as 
expressed by the percentage of people who have voted 
in the recent elections, the stability of a peasant agrar-
ian economy or agrarian society probably goes a long 
way toward explaining the relative success.

QUESTION: Would you comment on the Kashmir sit-

DR. SCHWARTZBERG: I plan to work on Kashmir

alienated to a degree that will, preclude their reconcili-
ation with India. I cannot predict exactly the shape of 
the future of Kashmir, but I will predict that there will 
be a significant change in the situation there. 
I am more optimistic in the case of Punjab, a richer 
area and strategically much more important. There 
seem to be signs that India ha,s the Punjab situation

under control. However, the raid on the Golden Tem-
ple will not soon be forgotten, nor the many other 
human rights abuses that the Indian Government has 
committed in the name of quelling that insurrection. I 
believe, however, that the prospects for reconciliation 
exist, and many people who know Punjab better than I 
do say that, even at the worst of times, the majority of 
Sikhs were always moderate and that the extremists 
never represented the Sikh rank and file. 
One fundamental difference between Kashmir and the 
Punjab is that the dissociation of Punjab from India 
would probably let loose an unstoppable Balkaniza-
tion of India, while dissociation of Kashmir would not 
necessarily result in such an outcome.

The Demographic Backdrop to 
Ethnic Conflict: A Geographic 
Overview 
Gary Fuller 
Professor of Geography and 
Population Studies 
University of Hawaii 
Introduction 
Following the breakup of the former Soviet Union, 
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan strongly criticized 
US intelligence estimates that, he alleged, had ignored 
Soviet demographic and health statistics. Moynihan 
argued that any society that exhibited the symptoms of 
the USSR�which included rising overall mortality 
and a high incidence of alcoholism�could not be a 
legitimate economic or military threat to the United 
States. The criticism is unfair in one sense, since it 
does not require national health or sobriety to launch 
missiles. Nevertheless, Moynihan's observation about 
the role of demographic statistics in intelligence anal-
ysis is insightful. 
States sometimes go to great lengths to disguise data 
about their economies and societies, usually with the 
motive of misleading their enemies (and perhaps their 
own citizens as well). More commonly, however, 
accurate data are elusive because they are difficult and 
expensive to collect, analyze, and interpret. I once 
spent several months visiting arrizl collecting data from 
remote family planning clinics in Chile, and I was 
struck with how different the,situation at the clinics 
was compared with the officiel reports in Santiago. 
My experience is highly typical, I think, and is shared 
by most who have done field research. 
Demographic data are almost,always the best data that 
are available for a society. This is not to say that they 
are good; indeed, they are often very poor. I am only 
here advancing a comparative judgment. Govern-
ments collecting demographic data (whether censuses, 
vital registers, or surveys) can call upon an impressive 
body of international experience and knowledge con-
cerning the planning, execution, interpretation, and 
151 
adjustment of demographic data. Most such data, 
moreover, are not seen as threatening by governments. 
Certainly there are cases where certain population 
information is viewed as terribly dangerous (Lebanon 
or Iraq's religious compositions, for example), but, 
even when this is the case, other demographic data 
unrelated to policymakers' phobias may be unaf-
fected. Finally, censuses have to be conducted openly. 
Information about their quality and the nature of their 
biases is widely circulated in the demographic com-
munity, and sometimes "corrections" are advanced by 
demographers outside the country. The only effective 
way to keep demographic data secret is not to collect 
them. 
Demographic Indicators of Instability 
Consider also that certain demographic trends corre-
late highly with socioeconomic variables; were it not 
for this fact, demographic transition would be an 
arcane model of little interest to any but abstract theo-
rists. Thus, it requires only a small logical step to see 
that socioeconomic data and trends (perhaps closely 
guarded or disguised) are imbedded in demographic 
data that are open and aboveboard. Hungary offers an 
interesting example. As a former Warsaw Pact mem-
ber, Hungary was quite guarded in releasing social 
and economic data, but its population data are among 
the best in the world. 
I do not mean to imply either that censuses ought to 
replace electronic surveillance in the intelligence kit 
bag or that demographic data can entirely compensate 
for a lack of socioeconomic data. My point is that 
population data are a rich vein that is not mined suffi-
ciently and that academic researchers and intelligence 
analysts have the opportunity to use census data in 
creative ways that give new insight into societal 
tends. Perhaps because the data are easy to come by, 
their value is not fully appreciated. 
A comprehensive case for the value of the demo-
graphic perspective in assessing intelligence issues 
would require more space than I have available. I hope 
a few aspects of the "correlation" I mentioned earlier 
will suffice.

A society whose fertility begins to fall rapidly is 
undergoing a profound transformation. Most basically, 
it has begun to trust the permanence of lowered infant 
and childhood mortality, something that is hard to per-
ceive at the family level, and something that may 
require denial of firmly embedded beliefs. The society 
has otherwise begun to change its traditional way of 
life by moving away from rural, agrarian values and to 
embrace the smaller family norms associated with 
urbanization and economic development. 
Rostow's term "takeoff," which used to describe a 
stage in economic development, has been largely dis-
credited by other economists (although it is not clear 
whether this is because Rostow was overall simplistic 
or because he went to work for US President 
Johnson). "Takeoff," however, seems appropriate to 
describe certain changes in fertility and growth that 
change the "momentum of growth" from positive to 
negative. Brazil and Mexico are both at that point 
now, and, while any number of observers of different 
stripe continue to focus attention on the problems of 
severe poverty that haunt sectors or regions of both 
countries, the demographic picture is reasonably opti-
mistic. Rely on the pessimistic reports if you will, but 
the economic transformation of both societies is inher-
ent in their current demographic profiles. 
Infant mortality data offer a measure of societal well-
being that is highly sensitive to change. Public health 
authorities argue that the infant mortality rate is the 
best measure of the health of-a society, and, even if 
this is hyperbole, surely there is a high correlation 
between such mortality and the prosperity of a society. 
Overall mortality is also a valuable indicator. Mortal-
ity remained constant in Eastern Europe from the mid-
1960s until the late 1980s�and actually increased in 
the USSR during the same period�while mortality 
was falling in virtually all other countries. There is, 
indeed, good reason to suspect that these mortality 
trends have real meaning, just as Moynihan pointed 
out. 
Within the context of this discussion, demographic 
data should be considered as analogous to an air photo 
in which "signatures" of various kinds indicate a dan-
gerous ground truth. My initial investigations into this 
area have led me to some hypotheses about demo-
graphic processes that correlate strongly with societal 
troubles. It is important at the onset to understand that 
such correlation is modest at best with general popula-
tion growth. That, of course, is why so many extreme 
neo-Malthusians insist very loudly that you believe 
them; the ideology is strong, but the evidence is weak. 
I will limit my remarks here to a single case of ethnic 
strife, that of Sri Lanka's two postwar insurgencies.' 
The Youth Bulge in Sri Lanka 
As Professor Stoddard implied, if you look at the his-
torical or cultural context of the ongoing conflict in Sri 
Lanka, a complex situation emerges. Indeed, political 
scientists and analysts in the State Department and 
elsewhere have accounted for this in many ways. 
Many cite ancient animosities between Tamils and 
Sinhalese. 
The demographic data suggest another reason behind 
the conflict, however. Figure 14 shows the age struc-
ture of the two ethnic groups in Sri Lanka. Using Dal-
las Fernando's method of looking at the Sri Lankan 
population by revenue district, we are able to break 
down ethnic group data to determine age structure of 
the populations. This graph reflects two distinct demo-
graphic transitions�a leading transition for the Sinha-
lese, who predominantly live in the country's wet 
zone, and a lagging one for the Tamils, who live in the 
dry zone. It reveals a correlation between the incidents 
of conflict between the two ethnic groups and the pro-
portion of each population that is youthful (ages 15 to 
24)�those who are in demand of land, jobs, higher 
education, opportunity, and other kinds of resources in 
the society. 
When the British left Sri Lanka, they left these 
resources largely under Tamil control. After all, the 
Sinhalese had resisted British penetration, while the 
Tamils had worked in the civil service not only in Sri 
Lanka but elsewhere in the empire as well.

When the proportion of the Sinhalese population who 
were young adults reached 20 percent of the total pop-
ulation�what we term a youth bulge�the Sinhalese 
insurgency of 1970 occurred. Although other factors, 
which I do not mean to diminish, were behind the 
uprising, it is more than coincidental that the peak in 
that age group took place as conflict broke out. 
Indeed, a former US Ambassador to Sri Lanka told me 
that all the insurgents in the rebellion were under 24 
years old. 
The Tamil population shows a similar story. At the 
time of the Sinhalese insurgency, the percent of the 
Tamil population that was age 15 to 24 was low and, 
thereby, caused no problem. In response to the Sinha-
lese insurgency, the government made changes in the 
allocation of resources, jobs, land, and higher educa-
tional opportunities. So by the time the Tamil youth 
bulge occurred, numerous institutions and laws were 
in place that favored the Sinhalese rather than the 
Tamils. As such, the outbreak of a much more serious 
episode of violence took place coincident with the rise 
of the Tamil youth bulge. This bulge, incidentally, has 
lasted such a long time that it has become entrenched 
in the society. Even when it goes away�probably by 
1995�its effects are going to linger because of its 
longevity. 
Let me switch the venue to the case of India. My grad-
uate student, Joan Butler-Qazi, meticulously went 
through numerous Indian newspapers and other publi-
cations and came up with measures of violence for 
each of the country's districts. Then she correlated 
these measures of violence with the size of-the 15-to-
24 age cohort in 1981. The correlation for India as a 
whole was an R squared of 0.77.2 Here, the overall 
demographic variable is driving ethnic conflict gener-
ally. 
Conclusion 
We have also examined the youth bulge situation 
more broadly, not only as it relates to ethnic conflict. 
For South Korea, for example, we predicted flatly that 
youth riots would taper off and eventually disappear 
as a result of the shrinking of-a youth bulge.3 Finally, 
one tremendous advantage in using demographic vari-
ables for analyzing conflicts, including ethnic ones, is 
that often the data are quite easy to come by.

Ethnic Conflict and Population 
Displacement 
Martin Kenzer 
Associate Professor of Geography 
Florida Atlantic University 
Historical Review of Postwar Refugee Populations 
In large measure, today's so-called ethnically driven 
refugee populations are the extension of territorial 
conflicts that were waged immediately before or just 
after World War I. To one degree or another, that war 
partially resulted from particular territorial tensions 
released by the collapse of former empires. The same 
ethnic or territorial zones were then, again, suspended 
by the onset of World War II,' which was another eth-
nic contest that eventually foOd most of the world's 
peoples fighting either for or iagainst what often 
became known as ethnic virtue. During the war, how-
ever, the battle focused not on the individual ethnic 
groups that had been fighting one another for genera-
tions but on larger, national, territorial campaigns. 
When World War II ended, the focus quickly switched 
to the emerging superpowers�two foes who were 
able to stifle domestic ethnic conflicts by squaring off 
powerful armies against one another. Internal ethnic 
conflicts were squelched in order to amplify national 
unity and the projecting of a front. 
Also following World War II, it was believed that the 
world's refugee problem would soon disappear. Moti-
vated at the time by both geopolitical and humanitar-
ian concerns, the predominant powers�principally 
the victorious West�sought to accommodate the 
needs of the many and diverse dislocated groups. Sev-
eral local, regional, national, 1.nd international refugee 
relief and repatriation/resettlement agencies�many 
associated with the United Nations�were established 
to deal with the day-to-day needs of the then-homeless 
peoples and political refuge,es. These also promoted 
the eventual settlement of those peoples to either his-
torical or new homelands. The postwar New World 
Order architects, who were also the founders of the 
United Nations, generally perceived that these dis-
placed peoples and the refugees were a problem but 
did not see them as a symptom of the international 
geopolitical restructuring that they had themselves 
engineered. 
The common view of the various organizations that 
came into being after World War IT was that they 
would provide for the security and welfare of the 
uprooted only until the needs of the displaced were 
accommodated. It was fully believed after the war that 
agencies such as the UN High Commissioner for Ref-
ugees (UNHCR) would only exist for a short period 
because they would soon get everyone resettled and 
all problems would go away. Obviously, this proved to 
be erroneous. 
The Current Picture 
Recently, another empire, the former Soviet Union, 
has collapsed, and, once again, the world is experienc-
ing a wave of territorial/ethnic tensions. To one degree 
or another, almost all these tensions are expressions of 
dormant territorial hatreds that in some locales date 
back centuries. They have been inactive for decades 
because the two major superpowers have muffled 
them and/or used them to their own respective needs. 
Today, there are far more displaced peoples than there 
were at the end of World War II, and they are found on 
more continents. Forced migrations have increasingly 
come to dominate the patterns and processes involved 
in international population movements. Ironically and 
tragically, however, a majority of these people, despite 
their refugeelike experience, do not find themselves 
protected or cared for by national or international ref-
ugee relief agencies because they still do not fall 
under the legalistic, post�World War H definition of 
"refugee." 
155 
As officially defined, refugees are persons who have 
crossed a recognized political border and who have 
then registered with an official group, which most 
often is the UNHCR. If a person does not do that, the 
international community does not recognize him or 
her as a refugee. Today, many, even in the United 
Nations, argue that this definition has become increas-
ingly blurred. Indeed, the distinction between who is 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
and who is not a refugee is probably irrelevant, given 
the ever-expanding number of groups worldwide who 
are just as persecuted and uprooted as official refu-
gees. 
The problem of accurate accounting of refugees goes 
way beyond the definitional problem, however. Every 
day, we hear new figures about how many refugees are 
here or there. Refugee statistics are fraught with 
untruths and inaccuracies. Do not believe any of the 
figures you hear; they are all made up. Most of these 
figures are from thirdhand or fourthhand sources, 
many of whom are unreliable. There are vested 
groups�including the refugees themselves�who 
want those figures either inflated or deflated for their 
particular interests. The numbers only provide a rela-
tive approximation of how many are in one region vis-
a-vis another, and they change dramatically over time. 
Today, official recognized bona fide refugees�those 
who register with the UN after crossing an interna-
tional border�number over 17 million. Broken down 
regionally, they include: 
� In Africa, 5.7 million. This is so far below the actual 
number; it is not even close. Africa is one of the 
worst regions. 
� In Europe and North America, 3.4 million. Of 
course, this does not include what is going on in 
Georgia. 
� In Latin America, 107,700, primarily in Central 
America. 
� In East Asia and the Pacific, 399,000. 
� In the Middle East, 5.5 million. 
� In South and Central Asia, 2.3 million. 
More important than these numbers, however, are the 
50 million internally displaced people who are not 
recognized as refugees. These are the people who 
have never had any form of internationally recognized 
status and who are probably never going to attain 
nationhood. They are not counted. They are the 
majority of displaced peoples in the world. They do 
not consider themselves to be part of-any country and 
have no sense of belonging to an individual, extant 
country. That is the case whether we are talking about 
Georgia or Burma or Afghanistan. 
Meeting Refugee Needs 
In terms of who attends to refugees, it is quite telling 
to look at where the money comes from to support ref-
ugee aid. In absolute terms, the United States devotes 
the most money, while the European Community as a 
whole devotes the second-largest amount. I think a 
better way to look at this, however, is on a per capita 
basis. North European countries�notably, Norway�
give a disproportionate amount of money to the care 
and treatment of refugees. Using this criteria, the 
United States falls to about 10th or 11th place. 
There are strings attached to all this money. When a 
country donates money to the UN, it always attaches a 
string dictating where its aid can go. Aid from the 
United States and the European Community always 
goes to countries and regions where strong trade alli-
ances exist with the donor. 
In any case, the people with the power and the money 
are in the United States and Europe; they do not give 
money to Africa until conditions there get out of con-
trol. And often, the humanitarian situation in Africa is 
muted because many of-those affected are not, by def-
inition, real refugees because they have not crossed 
any international borders. As far as the displaced are 
concerned, however, when they leave their tribal or 
clan homeland, they have crossed a border; they do 
not need to go any farther than that. (Indeed, many 
Africans do not recognize international borders on 
their continent except as lines on the map.) As such, 
money is not earmarked for most African areas until 
conditions flare up to the extent that they become of 
international concern. This usually occurs only after 
the situation has already spiraled out of control.

Forced Migration and Ethnicity 
Lee Schwartz 
Office of the Geographer 
Department of State 
Introduction 
The main reason for deciding to speak on forced 
migration and ethnicity is because I recently 
addressed that topic at a conference�organized by 
the International Geographical Union's Commission 
on Population Geography in Ljubljana, Slovenia�
which focused on the topic of ethnicity and geogra-
phy. Obviously this is a topic that is of current concern 
not just in the United States but also in other areas of 
the world; indeed, one of the major causal factors�
and consequences�of forced migration in the world 
today is ethnic conflict. When I found out that Dr. 
Kenzer was going to speak on a similar topic, I 
thought I would attempt to organize my comments 
today more broadly in order to address also some 
related humanitarian issues; after all, this session is 
titled, "Perspectives on Demographic and Humanitar-
ian Issues." I think my role here today, therefore, will 
be to highlight a few of these perspectives, some of 
which have already been mentioned and others of 
which may be new. 
When dealing with the topic of forced migration�
particularly in trying to understand its ethnic compo-
nents�three themes come to mind. These are some-
what in line with what the current administration 
probably considers its priorities: 
� Human rights. From a global perspective, human 
rights with respect to migration are severely limited 
because little freedom of movement exists on an 
international scale. Both refugee movement and 
"free," or economic, migration are heavily con-
trolled by increasingly stringent regimes and quotas. 
� Democracy. We have heard about a lot of geo-
graphic concepts�such as national territoriality, 
regionalism, homeland, and frontier�at this confer-
ence. It is instructive to see how these might mani-
fest themselves in terms of democratic principles, 
157 
particularly concerning the right of self-determina-
tion in a world where the traditional state system is 
admittedly breaking up (if not down). Where do you 
draw boundaries? Which people get to determine on 
which territory lies the future of their own ethnic 
communities? Another factor to consider is access to 
power; when people are eliminated from access to 
power, it often is a causal factor of warfare, which 
tends to produce forced migrations. 
� Conflict resolution. I think Wade Hinkle yesterday 
raised a good point. Hindsight is 20/20, and geogra-
phers have been strong in terms of trying to under-
stand regions and relationships between ethnicity 
and territoriality, but geographic knowledge is not 
necessarily sufficient in terms of trying to come to a 
resolution of some conflict that has already begun. 
Most geographic analysis has not been predictive in 
terms of where conflict will break out. I think that 
geography and geographers can best contribute to an 
understanding of ethnic conflict by focusing not on 
conflict resolution but on preventing conflict exacer-
bation. 
Typology of Forced Migration 
My office director, Bill Wood, has developed a typol-
ogy of forced migration that we have applied to differ-
ent regions to help understand different causal 
components of forced migration (see figure 15). It is 
not necessarily important in this model to draw dis-
tinctions between refugees, forced migrants, and inter-
nally displaced persons, although when it comes to 
providing humanitarian aid or support, refugees are 
favored over both internally displaced persons and 
illegal immigrants, who tend to "disappear" and are 
not accorded rights in the countries in which they live. 
There is also an ethnic component to each of the three 
subsets shown on figure 15. It is strongest in the cate-
gory of political instability and civil unrest�largely 
governmental persecution. That is because this perse-
cution is often directed toward a particular ethnic 
group or may have consequences for specific ethnic 
groups. Ethnicity is a factor when looking at forced

migration, not just at the source but also at the destina-
tion as well. Whether a group is territorially concen-
trated or not, if its members move from one territory 
into another, they are changing the ethnic balance in 
two regions; it is a source-and-destination dynamic. 
During periods of economic decline, a high percent-
age of forcibly displaced persons are members of cer-
tain ethnic groups that are underprivileged or in the 
worst poverty-stricken regions. These are also often 
the first ones who are susceptible to famine or ecolog-
ical disasters. So the way to look at the ethnic dimen-
sion of people who have fled and need to be 
supported�whether they be forcibly displaced refu-
gees or internally displaced persons or illegal 
migrants�is in a typology such as that in figure 15, in 
which an ethnic component can be identified in each 
of the three subsets. 
Forced migration has traditionally been thought of as 
a process that produces refugees, who are defined as 
such because they cross international boundaries. It is 
quite clear, and every speaker has touched on the facts 
that increasing mobility and decentralization, devolu-
tion of political power, the breakdown of one-party 
state systems, and the rise of territoriality�be it 
regional or national�make it 'incumbent on us to 
increasingly think of forced migration processes at the 
intrastate level. It is a question of scale, I think, in 
terms of how we do our analysis. 
From the humanitarian perspective, the different cate-
gories and classifications for migrants not only tend to 
lose their importance but also can often infringe upon 
the civil rights of certain groups that are mobile. In 
many cases, those accorded refugee status are privi-
leged forced migrants. The new restrictive definitions 
and laws being imposed in Europe, for instance, have 
produced an upsurge in illegal migrants�many of 
whom are disenfranchised in the country in which 
they reside�most of whom are not counted. There are 
reports out of Bosnia that tens.,of thousands of Bos-
nian Muslims are still movinginto the rest of Europe. 
Now that the European refugee regime has become 
stricter, however, they have found ways to enter as 
illegal immigrants and never get counted. 
159 
Another important point to raise, which Dr. Kenzer 
touched on earlier, is that internally displaced people 
are not being accorded sufficient attention by the 
international community. With regard to humanitarian 
concerns, the internally displaced are often the most 
problematic. In these cases, many of the geographic 
concepts mentioned at this conference can be applied: 
the question of core and periphery relations, for 
instance�most of the internally displaced are located 
at the peripheries of states and are often the first to 
cross borders and become refugees. 
Crossing Boundaries 
In fact, many refugees were first internally displaced 
people before crossing an international border. What 
made them refugees is that they managed to cross 
such a border and were thereby accorded official refu-
gee status. Many internally displaced people can be 
considered to function as refugees, particularly 
because internecine conflict often leads to situations 
where borders within states begin to function more as 
international borders. Look at the situation in the Cau-
casus or with Gorno-Badalchshan in Tajilcistan, where 
the internal borders are functioning virtually as inter-
national ones with regard to population movements. In 
many cases, therefore, whether someone being forced 
to move is called an internally displaced person or a 
refugee is a moot point in terms of how the interna-
tional community needs to support them or deliver aid 
to them. 
We should also be thinking more about the changing 
nature of political boundaries. The international com-
munity is increasingly recognizing that the sacrosanct 
nature of these boundaries is not as strong as it once 
was. Although many members of the international 
community considered Serb and Croat discussions 
about territorial exchanges to be an anathema, there is 
nothing sacrosanct about these boundaries just 
because they have been in existence and have been 
fairly permanent for so long. We are definitely seeing 
grudging change in this direction. At the same time, 
we should not underestimate the state boundaries in 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 000123268

Africa, for instance. While they might not necessarily 
have a great deal of meaning to the local peoples, they 
have a tremendous impact in terms of how the interna-
tional community officially views various popula-
tions. 
Ethnicity and Identity 
Another concept related to forced migrations, which 
Dr. Knight referred to yesterday, is the primacy of 
identity and the inability of people to adjust quickly 
their primary identity. It is important to understand in 
this context the role of a catalyst or a trigger that 
might cause a nation either to latch more strongly onto 
a specific identity or to change its primary identity. 
Ethnicity in most of the world, in fact, is quite dor-
mant most of the time; it is only once ethnic forces are 
activated that they become politicized and can lead to 
conflict. We can try to understand ethnicity and the 
relationships between ethnic groups and regions, but 
that alone has little predictive value. That is why when 
addressing policy options�trying to be proactive as 
opposed to reactive�it is not enough to know a 
region and the nature of its ethnic groups. What might 
be a passive ethnicity can very quickly become acti-
vated if something is denied a particular group or if a 
group perceives a threat to its territorial homeland, 
language, culture, or religion. The interrelationship 
between ethnicity and territory is quite complex. 
I want to mention, briefly, the factor of warfare. War-
fare is quite obviously the major cause of forced 
migrations in terms of-generating ethnic populations 
on the move, and national territoriality is frequently 
the underlying cause of much of this fighting. What is 
important to understand about situations where territo-
riality acts as a catalyst to politicize ethnicity is that, 
even in warfare situations that are not based on ethnic 
conflict, groups are often dislocated because of their 
ethnicity. Warfare leads to ethnic-selective disloca-
tions when a particular region that has been overrun 
has a concentration of one ethnic group or contains 
groups that are economically vulnerable or culturally 
isolated. So that even when the cause of a conflict is 
not rooted in ethnicity, it can result in ethnic "modifi-
cation" of a region by selectivity of the forced 
migrants. 
Geography of Refugee Populations 
What can probably be agreed upon in trying to under-
stand ethnic conflict is the importance of scale and of 
having the appropriate approach to investigate events 
at the substate or intrastate level. I want to briefly 
present a few maps here to show how different scales 
might operate in terms of attempting to understand the 
ethnic components of forced migration. 
Africa is the most turbulent continent in terms of num-
bers of refugees (see figure 16). Most African refugees 
tend to be the economically deprived and, as a result, 
they do not move far across neighboring borders. The 
African continent is also where the largest number of 
internally displaced peoples exists; when they cannot 
cross the border, they tend to congregate along the 
fringes of states, often beyond the limits of central 
authorities. In Africa, there are three or four times as 
many displaced persons as refugees. 
In the former Soviet Union, there is a combination of 
short- and long-distance migration (see figure 17). 
Most of this movement is based on national conflict in 
the non-Slavic south. The economically able groups 
can move farther, often before the outbreak of vio-
lence. 
Bringing it down to a larger scale, within the states of 
Tajikistan and Georgia, for example, one gets below 
the ethnic and into the various historical and factional 
clan conflicts that are at the basis of groups attempting 
to reestablish historical regions by pushing people off 
territory and back from whence they came (see figure 
18).

Conclusion 
Let me conclude by noting one of the main problems 
of the international response to forced migrations with 
ethnic components. That is, that migration regimes are 
set up on a bilateral basis that impinge on multilateral 
responses to regional problems. Individual states are 
setting laws while the responses to refugee-producing 
crises�often related to ethnic conflict�are multilat-
eral. 
Further, the UN is increasingly finding it difficult to 
intervene in many countries; they do not have the full 
mandate to deal with the internally displaced. In con-
clusion, it is difficult for policymakers to do more than 
react to the latest refugee crises. By attempting to mit-
igate refugee flows by tailoring policies to react to 
events at local and regional levels, it will be easier to 
respond to, if not predict, ethnic conflict that disrupts 
the entire state. If that is done, governments will be 
able at least to reduce the trauma of forced migrants 
and refugees, if not eliminate the cause of their move-
ment altogether.

Summary of Discussion 
General Discussion 
DR. WDCMAN: While we often hear about high birth-
rates being major causes of nationalism, the reverse�
that is, where low fertility is one of the primary rea-
sons for rises in nationalism�is also important. In the 
former Soviet Union, for example, the rapid rise in 
Russian nationalism was very much tied to a sense of 
rapidly declining fertility. In Germany, the lowering of 
the birthrate is also one of the primary factors in the 
rise of the German national consciousness. Are there 
people doing work on the correlation between declin-
ing fertilities and the rise of ethnic national conscious-
ness? 
DR. FULLER: Yes, exactly along the lines you say 
and for exactly the reasons that you say. In fact, I can 
say that the people that are spOnsoring this conference 
have published a paper along exactly those lines. 
QUESTION: Why does the United States distinguish 
between ethnic and political refugees in the way they 
are treated? 
DR. SCHWARTZ: Frankly, in part to keep out people 
from coming in who are seen as potentially draining to 
the economy. This is a complicated issue, however. 
DR. DE BLIJ: The distinction between refugees is a 
holdover from the Communist period. The current 
definition of refugees is related to the political system 
they leave when they come here. 
DR. SCHWARTZ: The definitions come from the 
1951 UN convention and the 1967, protocol. The 1951 
convention was based on the post-World War II refu-
gee regime, while the 1967 protocol was attached onto 
that in order to deal with peoples from other areas of 
the world. Dr Kenzer, do you want to elaborate on 
that? 
165 
DR. ICENZER: You can sum it up in one word, poli-
tics. How can you say that Cubans are refugees and 
Haitians are not? It's a political issue. People do not 
want to hear that underlying our definitions for entry 
are issues of race and other things. 
DR. SCHWARTZ: There is still the distinction 
between economic migrants and political refugees. 
The United States does not have a category of an eco-
nomic refugee. 
DR. DE BLIJ: We do not. It's irrelevant. The defini-
tion of a refugee is someone from a Communist coun-
try. 
DR. KENZER: The distinction is becoming an impor-
tant issue. We are going to see refugees being cast in a 
different light; all emphasis is going to be on Central 
Americans and people beyond. 
DR. SCHWARTZ: A good test case would be Nicara-
gua, from where we once accepted political refugees 
but after the government changed, the departees 
became economic migrants. 
DR. DE BLLT: We also do not accept people from 
Communist China, but we do take people from Com-
munist Cuba. 
QUESTION: We do accept Chinese refugees; they are 
the ones who are allowed to have only one child. 
DR. DE BLU: You are right.

Ethnic Conflict: A Comparative 
Examination 
Thomas M. Poulsen 
Professor of Geography 
Portland State University 
The conventional political map of the world displays 
170 political geographic features that properly are 
termed sovereign states. They constitute the habitual 
framework for contemplating international affairs. 
Unfortunately, the conventional map can be a most 
misleading instrument in presenting the political 
geography of the world. The map depicts relative sizes 
and shapes of countries and the locations of their capi-
tal cities, but these are among their least significant 
qualities. Indeed, it should be noted that traditional 
political maps of the world typically distort the size of 
states because their customary Mercator projection 
creates great area disparities between tropical and 
polar regions. Although Greenland is about one-sev-
enth the size of South America, it actually appears 
larger on most political maps. 
Among features of a state critical to governmental 
functioning that are ignored on political maps are: 
� The territory really under effective control of the 
state's government. 
� The area of the state actually settled and productive. 
� The degree of centralization of governmental deci-
sionmaking and authority within the state. 
� The dependence of the given state upon another 
state. 
� Whether the state is a nation-state or a multination 
state. The last-named is the most pivotal. 
Nations 
A key element in understanding the modern world is 
to appreciate the fact that occupying space concur-
rently with states are more than 250 mutually exclu-
sive nations, and these have few outer limits that are 
coextensive with state boundaries. The term nation is 
a useful generalizing concept that can be applied to a 
variety of human groupings. At the simplest level, 
nations may be viewed as collective, subjective states 
of mind in which individuals habitually segregate 
other persons into "our folks" and "foreigners." Many 
of the world's ills are the result of conflicting national 
identities. However, nations can also be appreciated 
for some positive effects, including providing legiti-
macy to governmental actions and facilitating eco-
nomic interdependence through a climate of trust. 
The concept of nation is questioned by some because 
of the great diversity of circumstances the notion 
embraces, with resulting difficulties in definition and 
measurement. Unfortunately, although most national 
groups share a number of elements in common, each 
nation, like each state (and virtually every other phe-
nomenon studied by geography), ultimately is a 
unique entity. Questionnaires and other techniques 
that may effectively identify members of a nation in 
one region may prove inappropriate or erroneous 
when applied to groups in another area. The great 
diversity among nations does not make the concept 
any the less useful, however. Although some individu-
als may have a problem with the subjective quality of 
the abstraction, this does not mean that idea is errone-
ous or that nations do not exist because they cannot be 
measured. 
The advantage of thinking in terms of nations rather 
than the more diffuse "ethnic groups" is the political 
dimension inherent in the concept. The most impor-
tant common denominators distinguishing nations 
from tribes, castes, and other human groupings are 
collective self-awareness and a consensual political 
agenda. Members of a nation are conscious of that 
identity, and most believe that their interests are best 
served by having a state of their own. 
Numerous ethnic groups throughout the world do not 
satisfy these two criteria. Although anthropologists 
and other social scientists may identify common ele-
ments that stamp a given population group as distinc-
tive from its neighbors, a lack of group awareness of 
individuals beyond extended kinship patterns or 
166 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
shared religious beliefs and the absence of common 
political goals makes it more appropriate to designate 
such groups by the more neutral term peoples. Nations 
may be viewed as peoples who have become group 
conscious and politically activated. The process is a 
continuing one and now is occurring among Quechua-
speakers of the Oriente of Peru, galvanized by the 
Sender� Luminoso guerrillas. 
The commonly accepted starting point for the appear-
ance of-nations is the French Revolution. The inhabit-
ants of France not only transformed their state at the 
end of the 18th century, but also in a sense they 
became Frenchmen for the first time. Before that time 
few associated themselves with the Kingdom of 
France. Their identities were with family and locality 
and, at a higher level, with their true Christian faith. 
Following the Revolution they increasingly gained a 
sense of personal participation in a greater cultural-
political organism. They were manipulated by the 
Jacobins, dedicated believers in "the people," who 
denigrated traditional Catholicism and enthusiasti-
cally preached a new form of belonging that cele-
brated the interests of the "masses." This 
revolutionary system of beliefs took hold because tra-
ditional religion no longer was able to meet spiritual 
needs in the challenges of a rapidly changing society. 
Urbanization and industrialization presented difficult 
problems for individuals for whom traditional reli-
gious establishments had no answers. 
From the beginning, language proved a critical ele-
ment in national identity. To be French meant sharing 
of French culture, and this meant particularly the 
French language. Among proposals voiced in France's 
revolutionary parliament was expulsion of all Alsa-
tians across the country's "natural border" of the 
Rhine because they were "foreigners'; their vernacu-
lar was German, not French. 
The new ideas proved exciting and satisfying, and 
Napoleon's troops spread them across the territory 
they conquered. However, talk of "liberty, equality, 
and brotherhood" by enthusiastic French soldiers did 
not co-opt civilians speaking German, Italian, and 
other languages into becoming part of the new French 
nation. Although large numbers readily accepted the 
secular ideas of their occupiers, each linguistic group 
evolved a separate national identity. 
Language still plays a fundamental role in the identity 
of virtually all nations. Linguistic homogeneity is a 
characteristic of every national group, with the notable 
exception of the Swiss, and even there group tensions 
exist, particularly between the Italian-Swiss and the 
German-Swiss. One of the most common causes of 
ethnic tensions within a state is a group's opposition to 
perceived threats to its language. Attempts by Mag-
yars to impose Hungarian as a uniform language 
throughout their kingdom in the 1870s stimulated 
Croatian-speakers to become the nation of Croats. A 
century later, Croatian intellectuals again used a lin-
guistic threat as a national rallying symbol, decrying 
the degrading of the Croatian literary language by 
attempts of the Yugoslav regime to blend it with Ser-
bian vocabulary and usage to form an "artificial" 
Serbo-Croatian statewide language. 
Religious tradition also plays a role in the identities of 
most nations. The militancy of the Croatians about 
their literary language was a symptom of deeper divi-
sions among the South Slays based upon their differ-
ing religious heritages. Croatian culture has been 
bound up for more than a millenium with the Roman 
Catholic world, while Serbian traditions stem from an 
F-astern Orthodox inheritance. It should be stressed 
that religious dimensions of modern national identities 
need not derive from active worship but generally 
come from the shared values, customs, and images 
accumulating in a society from a common religious 
legacy. Avowedly atheistic members of the League of 
Yugoslav Communists, although speaking a common 
Serbo-Croatian language, remained always partitioned 
into distinctive bodies of Serbs, Croats, and Muslims, 
separated from each other by their respective religious 
cultures. A similar cultural disparity separates 
English-speaking Roman Catholic partisans of the 
Irish Revolutionary Army from Protestant supporters 
of the Ulster Defence Association. 
Thus, although a common language appears to be a 
major element of national identity, in itself it does not 
provide a sufficient base for identification with a 
nation. The French nation never managed to incorpo-
rate the adjacent French-speaking Belgian Walloons 
or the Swiss francophones of Geneva. Closer to home, 
although virtually all citizens of the United States and 
167

Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
two-thirds of Canadians exclusively speak English, 
they remain separate nations. There are 20 different 
nations in Latin America who speak Spanish and at 
least 17 different Arabic-speaking nations in the Mid-
dle East and North Africa. 
Since language appears to be an essential but not deci-
sive element in national identity, the question remains 
of what distinguishes Americans from Canadians, 
Germans from Austrians, or Uruguayans from Argen-
tineans. Certainly a key element is an association with 
a particular "homeland." This is the hallowed land of 
forefathers, whose legacy of monuments and struc-
tures are encountered every day. A number of other-
wise homogeneous and exclusive peoples have failed 
to forge themselves into nations because they lack dis-
tinctive territories of their own, including Gypsies in 
Europe and Parsees in India. 
Homeland is a key part of what the French political 
geographer Jean Gottman termed the "iconography" 
of nations. He included in the concept the sum total of 
"icons" shared by a given group, including their 
national symbols, perceptions of history, traditional 
myths, poetry, pastimes, and a host of other elements 
that otherwise can be termed little more than "trivia." 
To be a Canadian is to love ice hockey, to be senti-
mental about the song "0 Canada," and to resist the 
"colossus of the south." Americans share George 
Washington's mythic cherry tree and contact football. 
The traditions of Islam and the values of Buddhism 
are foreign to both groups, however much a minority 
of their individuals may treasure them. 
Iconographies are the products of inherited traditions, 
indoctrination in the education process, and mass 
media. They also are subject to change. Bing Crosby 
was once a significant element in the American ico-
nography; his place has been taken by Elvis Presley 
and Garth Brooks. 
Americans have difficulty in contemplating the notion 
of nationhood. Unlike Europeans, most of whom 
dwell within 100 miles of an international border, few 
Americans ever face challenges to their national iden-
tities. Also, our society is a multicultural one, some-
thing increasingly celebrated. Our principal ethnic 
minorities, Hispanics and African Americans, 
although manifesting characteristics that distinguish 
themselves from other Americans, have not forged 
separate nations as major minorities have done in 
most other countries. This is primarily because they 
are dispersed throughout the United States and thus 
lack a specific homeland in which they are a majority. 
Although Hispanic Americans have the potential to 
become a separate nation within this country through 
retention of their distinctive Spanish language, their 
religious traditions, and for many their association 
with Mexico, it should be noted that separatists among 
African Americans have always faced difficulties in 
attempting to mobilize political sentiments because 
their group shares with all other Americans a common 
language and religious-derived values and traditions, 
in addition to their scattered location. 
Part of the American iconography in recent years has 
been an increasing distrust by many of anything that 
smacks of "nationalism." This properly should not be 
seen as the same as "national identity." Nationalism 
refers to active political movements that play upon 
national group values, symbols, and prejudices. 
National identity is a passive shared state of mind that 
most individuals would consider a natural way of 
looking at things. When asked about their own 
national identity, many highly educated Americans 
would profess a lack of such. However, they cannot 
escape the fact that they are members of the American 
nation, living in a world of Babe Ruth, "we the peo-
ple," and "liberty and equality for all." Accustomed to 
life in a successful melting pot, Americans cannot 
understand why Serbs, Croats, and Muslims cannot be 
just Yugoslays or why Europe has had such difficulty 
uniting, now that 1992 has passed. However, it is 
ironic that some of the most avowedly nonnationalists 
or antinationalists in America opposed the North 
American Free Trade Association (NAFTA) because 
it will export "our" jobs to "those" Mexicans. 
Part of the minimal active awareness of national iden-
tity of Americans is the lack of a long history of 
English-speaking settlement in North America. Dis-
counting the structures of Native Americans who 
168

established impressive civilizations long before the 
advent of Europeans to the New World, the oldest 
buildings Americans see in their homeland are less 
than four centuries old, and on the West Coast they are 
barely 150 years old. In contrast, Europeans daily 
walk past cathedrals erected 1.0 centuries or more ago. 
European perceptions are of a national continuity with 
the forebears who constructed those buildings, even 
though the national identities to which they adhere are 
products primarily of the 19th century. 
Overlapping Patterns of States and Nations 
Lack of coincidence between the patterns of states and 
nations is a principal driving force in world affairs. 
Present configurations are a consequence of historical 
processes and events unique to each area. In many 
cases, including that of the Japanese and the Portu-
guese, the nation is clearly a product of an ancient 
state and coincides closely with it. In other instances, 
such as that of the Croatians oi Belarusians, the nation 
emerged despite strong efforts at suppression by state 
authorities. 
Although the vast majority of ptates feature single 
dominant nations, most also contain inconvenient 
other national groups. In many cases this asymmetry 
is the result of past state-building when petty units 
were melded together with no thought given to cul-
tural characteristics of inhabitants. A degree of homo-
geneity resulted from imposition of the ruler's 
religion, although language resisted assimilation. In 
other instances, the intermixture of groups in frontier 
zones between culture areas made impossible the 
drawing of boundary lines between new nation-states 
that did not include minorities. Thus, all the states 
formed in the East European "shatter zone" after 
World War I encompassed minorities approaching 20 
percent or more. Similarly, no ideal line could be 
drawn between Muslims and Hindus when indepen-
dence came to India and Pakistan and tragedy 
resulted�and continues in Kashmir�when a line was 
established. 
In surveying minority nations, a meaningful distinc-
tion rests between those that are self-contained and 
those that are "irredentist." The latter term is derived 
from an appellation applied by Italians to their "unre-
deemed" fellow nationals who lived outside the King-
dom of Italy. The concept has become a universal one 
applied to members of nations living outside the 
boundaries of a state dominated by people like them-
selves. Irredentist minorities pose particular problems 
to world peace because their causes may elicit active 
support from adjacent states governed by members of 
their nations. 
World Patterns of Nations and States 
The pattern of nation-and-state combinations differs 
from region to region around the world. Only a few 
states may be classed as pure nation-states lacking 
minority nations that seek autonomy or separation. 
Interestingly, France, which often is held out as the 
archetype of the nation-state, is not one of these. It 
embraces at least four minority nations that increas-
ingly seek recognition of their distinctive status and 
territories: the Corsicans, Bretons, Basques, and Occi-
tanians. 
More than three-quarters of the states of Europe are 
multinational, although this percentage has decreased 
in recent years with the divisions of Yugoslavia and 
Czechoslovalcia. However, newly independent Mace-
donia must deal with a 20-percent minority of Alba-
nians, and Slovakia must accommodate 10 percent of 
its citizens who are Magyars and 7 percent who are 
Ruthenians. 
The former Soviet Union held the dubious distinction 
of being the most diverse state in the world, with at 
least 30 groups that could be termed nations and more 
than 70 other peoples inhabiting its land space. The 
dominant Russians numbered barely half its total pop-
ulation. Despite the USSR's fragmentation, few of the 
Soviet successor countries can be termed nation-
states, as witnessed by Azerbaijan's problems with 
Armenians and Georgia's difficulties with Abkhazians 
and Ossetes. 
Despite the seeming homogeneity in religion and lan-
guage of the Middle East and North Africa, virtually 
none of the region's states are without minority prob-
lems. Several, including Lebanon, Turkey, Iran, and 
169 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Iraq, have endured violent ethnic strife in recent years. 
African states likewise are diverse, with clashes 
occurring particularly along the Sahelian fault zone 
between Arabic and Sub-Saharan cultures. For a vari-
ety of reasons, few nations have emerged south of the 
Sahara. Extreme tribal and linguistic diversity charac-
terizes most Sub-Saharan states. Nigeria contains 
more than 300 distinctive groups and Zaire more than 
200. 
Diversity also characterizes the states of South Asia. 
India long has encountered secessionist movements in 
its northeastern and northwestern wings, and it has 
mounting troubles with its Sikh and Dravidian minori-
ties. Pakistan already has lost Bangladesh and faces 
severe problems with Pathans, Sindhis, and Baluchis. 
Even a tiny state like Bhutan must contend with an 18-
percent regional minority of Nepalese. 
Although the states of mainland and insular Southeast 
Asia are typified by well-developed dominant nations, 
each contains numerous minorities, some of which 
now are evolving into true minority nations. Burma, 
Indonesia, and the Philippines endure continuing strife 
in their outer areas. In contrast, East Asian states are 
remarkably homogeneous and calm, with the notable 
exception of China. Although 92 percent of its popula-
tion may be considered members of the Chinese 
nation, the remaining 8 percent dominate more than 
60 percent of its total territory. 
The Anglo-American, Latin-American, and Australa-
sian states are notable for minimal minority problems. 
The chief exception is Quebecois separatism in Can-
ada. The indigenous population in many states of 
Latin America shows signs of restiveness, however, 
particularly in the Andean region and in Central. 
America. 
Factors Aggravating or Ameliorating 
Ethnic Conflict 
The currently escalating frictions among nations 
within states can be ascribed to a number of factors, 
including the increasing media avenues for promoting 
nationalist views and the post�Cold War drying up of 
superpower funds that often were used by client states 
to appease or suppress troublesome minorities. 
Although a number of political geographers have 
addressed questions of ethnicity, they have not come 
up with a viable theory that would allow identification 
of what circumstances escalate diversity into conflict 
or prediction of when and where such conflict is likely 
to occur. This is not to say that they have not devel-
oped interesting insights. One of the more useful theo-
retical concepts that have been developed in recent 
years is that of "core-periphery" relationships. In 
many states the capital city and its surrounding area 
dominate the economy, politics, and culture of a coun-
try. The American geographer Mark Jefferson 
observed this recurring regularity at the turn of the 
century and called it "The Law of the Primate City." 
In core-periphery theory, the metropolitan center 
exploits peripheral areas, a high proportion of which 
differ from the dominant area in ethnicity and stan-
dard of living. Although attractive for its seeming uni-
versality, core-periphery theory proves to be of little 
use as a guide to specific problems. While its premise 
fits many states, it runs counter to the situation in 
many others. Thus, the peripheral areas of Catalonia 
and the Basque region long have dominated the econ-
omy of Spain, and living standards in Alsace-Lorraine 
are higher than in most of the rest of France. 
Ethnic conflict is unpredictable. Each state situation 
constitutes a unique combination of differing groups, 
inherited traditions, and external circumstances. 
Although one may wish to see recurring regularities or 
scientific laws at work, there are simply too few cases 
that individually differ too much to permit an elabora-
tion of theory comparable to that of the physical sci-
ences. 
The unpredictability of-conflict perhaps is best seen in 
the internecine struggle in Somalia. Of all the states of 
Sub-Saharan Africa, internal strife would seem least 
likely to occur in that country due to its homogeneity 
in language and religion. However, Somalia's unique 
clan system has much in common with national diver-
sity in Europe and elsewhere, and warfare between 
clans came on the heels of the failure of a highly cen-
tralized, despotic regime. 
Despite the seeming impossibility of formulating a 
viable theory to examine potentials for ethnic conflict, 
170 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
a generalized framework is feasible. First, it is impor-
tant to distinguish between unstable group circum-
stances and triggering actions that lead to strife. 
Almost by definition, the presence of a minority 
nation constitutes an unstable situation. Identifying 
the presence of such nations is an essential first step. 
Next, it is important to consider possible elements that 
can set off conflict. Regimes control volatile internal 
situations through a variety of devices, ranging from 
totalitarian suppression to m6aningful autonomy. No 
matter how successful a policy may be, even in the 
long term, it will not satisfy all individuals. Extremists 
for a national cause can find ways to manipulate group 
opinion that is disaffected for: any reason. A dramatic 
change of circumstances can provide the extremists 
with strong levers. We recently witnessed the mobili-
zation of latent national antagonisms in Yugoslavia, 
despite more than four decades of universal indoctri-
nation of the population in the slogan of "brotherhood 
and unity." A disastrously deteriorating economy, a 
model of political change presented by a collapsing 
Soviet Union, and unwise actions by a federal army 
attempting to suppress autonomy allowed nationalist 
true believers to mobilize their nations. Once ignited, 
national passions fed upon themselves, each group's 
reactions engendering counteractions from the others. 
Virtually nobody remains a "Yugoslav" any more. 
Some Suggestions for American Policy in Dealing 
With Ethnic Conffict Abroad 
Political geography has evolved some truisms over the 
years that are useful for considering ethnic conflict. 
Among them are the following: 
� The present configuration of states is far from ideal 
and embodies tensions that have the potential to 
result in fragmentations and shifts of territory. 
Attempts to preserve the existing status quo in the 
name of peace can well exaCerbate unstable situa-
tions and even hasten conflict. It is unfortunate that 
the United States Government tacitly supported the 
Serbian-dominated regime's attempt to maintain 
intact the Yugoslav state in the face of escalating 
national minority demands for secession. A firm 
statement to the Yugoslav Government that the use 
of force to maintain unity was intolerable to the 
United States might have obviated the current 
conflicts in that tortured land and allowed a peaceful 
transition to separate states. 
� Maintenance of an unsatisfactory ethnic status quo 
is generally futile for a country and certainly can be 
costly in terms of transfer payments and policing. 
Although the United States sided with Gorbachev in 
attempting to preserve the Soviet Union intact, Rus-
sia's loss of its Central Asian territories was of long-
term benefit to the Russian people in stemming the 
outflow of funds to a region that has grave social 
and economic problems. 
� Gains or losses of territory generally affect only the 
local inhabitants of the areas involved, with little 
impact upon the overall economy and standards of 
living. Although difficult to believe, even the United 
States could cede Texas or California to Mexico and 
still maintain much the same well-being of its 
remaining inhabitants, whether or not NAFTA came, 
into existence. 
� Small independent states can flourish if they are 
willing to yield economic sovereignty to a broader 
common market. The inhabitants of 999-square-
mile Luxembourg have done quite well for them-
selves as part of Benelux and now the European 
Community. Communist Albania, in contrast, com-
mitted economic suicide by cutting ties to all neigh-
bors and potential partners. 
171 
� Allowing national groups to form states of their own 
does not inherently result in more intense national-
isms and potentials for greater international strife 
but, on the contrary, can have a sobering effect. 
Latvians and Slovaks are having second thoughts 
about their national quests for independence as they 
must now assume full responsibility for maintaining 
themselves. 
Above all, it is important to perceive states in terms of 
their total political geography. More specifically, it is 
the ethnic content of a state that is important, not its 
external boundaries. This was a principal fallacy of 
geopolitical thinking, which laid stress upon the 
geometry of states, their positions, sizes, and 
"resources," rather than upon their degrees of unity 
and the abilities of their governments to elicit support 
from inhabitants for "my country, right or wrong."

Summary of Discussion 
General Discussion 
QUESTION: Do you think that political arrangements 
have very little to do with the consolidation of nation-
alism of our nation states? 
DR. POULSEN: Geographers are concerned with 
things that give character to territory; we look at 
nations as one of the critical components of such. 
The way governments adjust their institutional 
arrangements to accommodate the national diversity is 
a question more properly in the province of a political 
scientist. Nevertheless, many geographers will agree 
that one of the most important characteristics of terri-
tory is the prevailing national identity in that territory. 
One cannot understand this section of the United 
States without knowing that English is the common 
language and that Americans share a lot of common 
images and values that help make the country go. 
Where You have diversity within the state, serious 
problems exist. I made a particular point of-distin-
guishing between nations and other groups; the caste 
system in India, for instance, is a very fundamental 
part of understanding India and really does not fit into 
this otherwise useful framework. 
DR. HONEY: I would suggest that our notion of the 
nation-state is really oversimplified and that we would 
be better off if we adopted Tilly's definition of the 
national state. There are few really national states, as 
you pointed out, and, where the countries are very 
strong, there are more national states than nation-
states. They clearly are very important actors and, in 
most states, they are not forcing people into a single 
form. Clearly, that is the case in the United States, in 
Britain, and in France. National identity is important, 
but it is not necessarily an identity that requires every-
body to be the same. As we look at the newer states of 
the world, the states that have been created after 
World War II, virtually none of them come anything 
close to the nation-state. They are national states. 
DR. POULSEN: Well, we obviously differ on this. 
One of the fundamental facts is that the world is parti-
tioned into states, and this cannot be ignored. The 
states are very significant in determining what is pro-
duced, how people do things, and the like. But at the 
same level, we have, in fact, national identities so that 
within a state there may be two quite different simul-
taneously operating systems based upon this identity. 
If we go the way of the anthropologist and look at 
every single grouping of people�and this is certainly 
a valid way of looking at things�we do not get to 
some of the big problems that generate conflict. The 
interrelationships between nations within states and 
also of national interests between states are the key 
ingredients in conflict.

Summary of Discussion 
Discussant: Marvin W. Mikesell 
In discussing nations and states, there are various 
terms that we can use: 
� Nation-state. An example is Iceland. 
� Multinational state. There are many examples; India 
would fit very well. 
� Multistate nation. "Germania," "Francophonia," and 
many others fit that category. 
� Nonstate nations. In this group we have Khalistan, 
Kurdistan, Palestine, and others. 1, 
� Nonnation states. Two unhappy examples would be 
Lebanon and Afghanistan; a happy example is the 
Vatican. 
It struck me that in all the presentations thus far we 
have been dealing with pathology rather than any kind 
of medicine or cure. In fact, in some cases, death cer-
tificates have even been written, but we have had very 
little in the way of looking for good examples of 
where accommodation has occurred rather than con-
flict. Part of the problem is that countries just do not 
learn from other countries on issues of minority rights, 
human rights, and questions of culture and nationality. 
This is surprising because legal codes are borrowed; 
entire constitutions are virtually plagiarized from one 
country to another. Yet it is rare to find one country 
saying to another country, "You seem to have a nice 
situation here; maybe we can learn from you." 
An interesting case would be Estonia. The Estonians 
are making terrible blunders in dealing with their Rus-
sian population. All they have to do is go to Helsinki 
and examine what Finland has done with its Swedish 
minority; it has anticipated their needs and, in a sense, 
treated a 10-percent minority as though it were a 
49-percent one. Finland has bilingual signs even 
where they are not needed for any functional reason. 
Now, if you tell an Estonian, "For Heaven's sake, get 
on a boat and go to Helsinki and learn something," he 
would say, "Well, it's a totally different situation. 
These Russians are occupiers. They're colonists." 
We also have examples of states than denounce mis-
treatment of minorities in neighboring states while 
seeming to be surprisingly indifferent to parallel cir-
cumstances within their own borders. Until quite 
recently, for example, the Turkish press bitterly 
denounced the treatment of the Turkish minority in 
Bulgaria. They were denied recognition and forced to 
change their names. If a Bulgarian Turk tried to regis-
ter a child or get a driver's license, he would immedi-
ately be told he must have a Bulgarian name. This 
effectively was nonrecognition of a minority that 
composed about 10 percent of Bulgaria's population, 
and the Turks were furious about this. At the same 
time, the Turks were treating their country's minority 
Kurds exactly the same way: not recognizing their 
language, refusing to register names, not even allow-
ing music with Kurdish lyrics on the radio. 
That is the problem: we do not have transfer of wis-
dom. We do not have people going into Finland from 
Bulgaria, Turkey, Sri Lanka, etc. to study what hap-
pened there since 1918. They could learn from it. 
Discussant: Mildred Berman 
One of the references to which I immediately turned 
when I was invited to come to this conference was 
Isaiah Bowman's The New World. That book has a 
very fine analysis of what led up to the ethnic prob-
lems that resulted in World War I, plus a lot of good 
maps. Bowman says, "But the world's people are fun-
damentally unlike, and the road to success passes 
through a wilderness of experiment." I think that is 
what we have been hearing these two days. 
I would like to address population, particularly fertil-
ity. Indonesia recently has been successful in cutting 
its fertility rate down to a little more than two children 
per woman. The Indonesians could get it down to 
175

Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
replacement level soon. This is encouraging, because 
Indonesia is the world's most populous Islamic nation. 
It is not a highly industrialized state, but the govern-
ment keeps pushing the idea publicly that small fami-
lies are happy families. I think that is worth 
considering in many parts of the world that are grow-
ing rapidly. 
General Discussion 
DR. WDCMAN: In light of a comment made by Pro-
fessor Mikesell, I agree that, in terms of conflict reso-
lution, the example of Finland is superb. Why did the 
Finns give such rights to the Swedes? Because they 
had been under Russian rule. A little earlier in history, 
when Rtsia took Finland from Sweden, it was anti-
Swedishism that became the symbolism in pro-Russi-
anism. 
What we need to look at in terms of conflict resolution 
is how reconciliation can take place. The reason 
Armenians still hate Turks is that there has never been 
reconciliation. Similarly there will be no ability for 
Bosnian Croats, Serbs, and Muslims to live together 
until reconciliation occurs. 
DR. MIKESELL: Another example of a government 
maintaining a keen awareness of minority-group 
needs would be that of the Netherlands. About 10 per-
cent of the country's population is Frisian, but only 
10 percent of the Frisians vote for the Frisian National 
Party. There is a Frisian academy; there are chairs in 
the language in Dutch universities. It is almost as 
though the government has said to the Frisians, "You 
are recognized. We would be pleased if you would 
engage in activities to promote your identity. We'll 
even subsidize it." 
Also, Switzerland recognized its Romansche-speakers 
before they clamored for recognition. This is partly 
because Mussolini considered Romansche to be an 
Italian dialect, and that frightened the Swiss. But we 
have so few other examples of that happening. I 
would say that treating a 10-percent minority as 
though it were a 49-percent minority works, but it 
requires extraordinary sophistication on behalf of the 
majority side. 
There are four core-applied questions that come to 
mind: 
� Under what circumstances do ethnic groups become 
politicized in the first place? 
� Under what circumstances do politicized groups 
come into conflict? 
� What circumstances aggravate or ameliorate con-
flict? 
� What are the implications of conflict for national/ 
international order? 
Those are, it seems to me, the strongest set of applied 
questions we should deal with. If there is a message 
related to those questions, each one of which could be 
addressed at some length, it seems to me, it is that we 
are not living in a simple world. I will avoid the ugly 
term complexification, but it seems to me that what 
continues to come across is that context matters, and 
context is a complicated array of things that come 
together. 
If there is a value to geography, it is not that it studies 
a particular thing but that it tries to look at how things 
come together and interact with core concepts like ter-
ritory, location, and environment. The key advantage 
of a geographical perspective is its ability to try to 
think about the relationships among and between phe-
nomena in places. This is where political science and 
geography really come together. Politics and power 
are expressed territorially, and looking at the relation-
ships among and between the territorial units and the 
expression of powers is critical to understanding the 
circumstances that lead to each of those four applied 
questions that I noted. 
DR. DE BLU: The examples that Dr. Mikesell men-
tioned of countries that were gracious to their minori-
ties were also countries that were relatively well off at 
the time they made those concessions. 
When Germany was thriving, the Turkish minority 
was welcome. When Germany had an economic 
recession, the Turkish minority became disliked.

There is some relationship to the well-being of a state 
that has chances of overcoming ethnic disrepair and 
the economic downturn that might presage it. This 
relates a little bit also to what Dr. Fuller said earlier. It 
might also mean that we ought to think twice before 
we use sanctions and economic destruction to achieve 
our aims in a foreign country. I still feel that, had sanc-
tions not been imposed on South Africa, the democra-
tization process might have taken longer but would 
have cost far fewer lives and have had a more satisfac-
tory outcome. 
DR. MIKESELL: I would say of all national policies, 
the one that is most likely to result in violence is non-
recognition; to say simply, "You don't exist. Your lan-
guage is merely a dialect. Your religion is a 
heterodoxy." It drives people crazy to be told that they 
do not exist. It hardly seems conceivable that Musso-
lini's policy toward South Tyrol would be the model 
that the world wants to emulate and, yet, this indeed is 
happening all the time. It is the redundancy of this 
pathology that I find so depressing. 
QUESTION: If this policy of nonrecognition is a key 
aggravating factor, can you identify the flip side of 
that? Can you put a name on a key ameliorating factor 
that is helping to contain that? 
DR. MIKESELL: That would involve cases where 
there seems to be accommodation, such as the extraor-
dinary examples of Finland, where a minority group 
was made a partner from the beginning. In this case, 
the Finns anticipated the needs of the Swedish minor-
ity, rather than waiting until the Swedes were shouting 
and demonstrating. Unfortunately, there are very few 
examples of this enlightened policy.

US Policy Perspectives: 
A Conceptual Approach 
Jon Gundersen 
US Department of State 
Americans are uncomfortable with ethnic politics. 
Why shy away from distinction based on race, reli-
gion, or nationality�at least in our public rhetoric. 
During the Cold War, ethnic conflicts were under-
standably ignored by Western policymakers. Forty 
plus years of finely crafted and cleared NATO talking 
points provided all the answers we seemed to need in 
a bipolar world. In a brave new Europe, without an 
identifiable enemy, we now have to think for a living. 
The ethnic killing fields of Bosnia confronted the 
West with a number of options�all of them unattrac-
tive. Compassion fatigue set in when our initial 
attempts to draw up convoluted ethnic maps were 
rejected and scenes of starving babies became all to 
commonplace on CNN. Was this fratricide not a 
uniquely Balkan curse, Europeans silently wondered? 
Could we not quarantine the carriers? This approach, 
of course, provided a convenient rationale for Western 
noninvolvement. It is also proved to be wishful and 
dangerous thinking. 
Setting aside the humanitarian rationale, there is a 
compelling strategic argument for Western engage-
ment. The nations of the East already perceive them-
selves in a political, economic, and security vacuum. 
Without a sense of being part of a larger community�
governed by accepted rules of behavior�neo-Com-
munist and ethnic nationalists may once again set the 
rules. Already the unprecedented flows of refugees 
from the East have spilled over even to prosperous 
avenues of Paris and Frankfurt. Xenophobia and eth-
nic politics have become forces to be reckoned with 
throughout the West. 
Ethnic conflict will be on the international agenda for 
the foreseeable future. This paper traces the historic 
and philosophical reasons why Americans have been 
so ill prepared to confront the issue and then suggests 
a conceptual framework to deal with ethnic conflict in 
Europe. First, it argues that we should look at the eth-
nic issue through the prism of individual and human 
rights, not group entitlements. Second, it calls for a 
Europe that is both more united and more autono-
mous. More autonomous in the sense that decisions 
are made�on a practical, not ideological basis�at 
the lowest possible administrative level. At the same 
time, autonomy can lead to anarchy and increased eth-
nic strife unless guided by universal, shared values. 
Therefore, the paper suggests ways to create civil 
societies in the East and to integrate these societies 
into a democratic family of nations. 
Ethnic Issues in Bipolar World 
Since the end of World War II, we viewed our policy 
in Europe through the optics of the Cold War. The pol-
icy of containment�with NATO as its operative man-
ifestation�aimed at providing collective defense 
against a real Soviet threat. In this regard, the policy 
was extraordinarily successful. We deployed our 
forces and accomplished our mission without a shot 
being fired. In the process, we helped build viable 
democracies and, ultimately, witnessed the systematic 
and systemic defeat of our main adversary. 
In a bipolar world, however, other issues, such as eth-
nic conflicts, were largely ignored by Western policy-
makers. In the West, the emphasis was on centrally 
organized solutions to security and economic prob-
lems; for example, NATO and the EC. While these 
organizations have fulfilled their primary Cold War 
missions of uniting Western Europe, they have tended 
to avoid, perhaps understandably, issues such as 
national identity, regional autonomy, and ethnic con-
flict. Few commentators were prepared, for example, 
for the anti-Brussels backlash following Maastrict. In 
the East, more ominously, long-simmering ethnic dis-
putes remained submerged or suppressed by totalitar-
ian regimes controlled by Moscow. There was no 
chance to resolve differences in an open and evolu-
tionary manner. Moreover, generations of Western 
diplomats, scholars, and journalists working out of 
Moscow�and Belgrade�rarely journeyed to the 
provinces. If they did, they were greeted by party loy-
alists who owed their positions to the central authori-
ties. In a sense, we tacitly accepted the Leninist 
imposed view of the new man shorn of ethnic identity.

The Return, Not the End, of History 
Western policymakers were thus ill prepared to antici-
pate the breakup of the Soviet empire or the disinte-
gration of Yugoslavia. We believed that a democratic 
Soviet Union could solve the messy nationality prob-
lems ignored or suppressed by czars and commissars 
for centuries. In August 1990; in his famous "Chicken 
Kiev" speech, President Bush cast his lot with the cen-
tral authorities in Moscow, dOding "suicidal nation-
alism" and averring that "democracy does not mean 
independence." Three weeks later Ukraine declared its 
independence; five months later the Soviet Union col-
lapsed. Later in that same year, Secretary of State 
Baker declared a "one Yugoslavia" policy, thereby, 
according to many, encouraging Milosovic to pursue a 
"one Serbia" policy. By the end of the year, the world 
had become all too familiar with the term "ethnic 
cleansing." Far from witnessing the "end of history," 
we are witnessing the "return of history," which all too 
often in Europe has been characterized by ethnic 
strife. 
Russians: "Can't Live With Them, Can't Live 
Without Them" 
We are also witnessing the geopolitical legacy of 
Stalin's ethnic policies. By reMoving ethnic minorities 
from their homelands and often replacing them with 
ethnic Russians, Stalin laid the basis for today's seem-
ingly irreconcilable tendencies of independence and 
interdependence. The former Soviet Republics all 
have economic and blood ties to their Russian big 
brothers. And they all resent it. 
Group Versus Individual Rights 
In addition to these historic reasons, Americans have 
another, perhaps more fundamental, reason for our 
inability to come to terms with ethnic conflict in 
Europe: we hold the individual, not the group, 
supreme. European nations have long recognized and 
promoted the concept of "group and ethnic rights," 
even if Europeans have as much difficulty in defining 
these rights as they have in coming up with an all-
European recipe for sausage. 
Americans intuitively approach this subject from a 
different perspective. Group rights, in our view, serve 
to delineate and emphasize differences among people 
and tend to separate rather than unite. From the time 
of our Declaration of Independence and Constitution, 
especially the Bill of Rights, we have held that indi-
vidual rights are primary and not subordinated to the 
rights of a particular group, some of whom may also 
belong to national minorities. Even in a politically 
correct age, many Americans are uncomfortable with 
distinctions based on race, religion, and nationality. 
American Ideals and European Solutions 
In practical terms, what principles guide the American 
policy maker in addressing the issue of ethnic conflict 
in Europe? Is the concept of individual rights applica-
ble to ethnic and minority issues Europe? Or is it too 
anachronistic and too American for dealing with 21st-
century Europe? Can we respect the right of individ-
ual and group self-determination and, at the same 
time, defend the territorial integrity of existing nation-
states? In other words, are the Helsinki Final Act prin-
ciples valid or even reconcilable in formulating our 
policy toward ethnic conflict? In a changing Europe, 
we will be increasingly confronted with uncomfort-
able choices. Without a conceptual context, we will be 
forced to rely on ad hoc solutions. 
It is perhaps easier to begin to answer some of these 
questions by identifying what should not be our pol-
icy. Many Europeans and Americans are ill at ease in 
this brave new world. They view the alleged stability 
of Cold War Europe with some nostalgia; some even 
seek solutions in monolithic ethnically pure states. 
Both of these remedies are false and dangerous. The 
Cold War resulted in the systematic suppression of the 
most basic human and national rights in much of 
Europe and a massive misuse of scarce resources. 
Solutions based on ethnic purity violate the most basic 
tenets of Judeo-Christian beliefs. They are particularly 
179 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
repugnant to a pluralistic society such as the United 
States. Ultimately, instability is not caused by demo-
cratically expressed claims by individuals and 
national communities but by the denial of these 
claims. 
The above solutions should be categorically rejected. 
Other policy prescriptions offer more traditional solu-
tions. In the name of stability, the Realpolitik school 
calls for working within the existing state system. The 
so-called Sonnenfeld Doctrine of the mid-1970s, in 
effect, accepted the status quo in Europe; that is, 
spheres of American and Soviet influence. The propo-
nents of this school emphasize Principles 3 and 4 of 
the Helsinki Final Act, respectively the inviolability of 
frontiers and respect for territorial integrity. What they 
fail to recall is that the Helsinki Final Act is a care-
fully balanced document based on centuries of sad 
European history. Using time-honored Jesuitical logic, 
the Helsinki drafters declared that "all principles are 
equal." The first Helsinki principle, for example, notes 
that "frontiers can be changed by peaceful means and 
agreement. Thus the United States recognized the 
peaceful unification of Germany in 1990 and the 
peaceful dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. 
The Wilsonian model, on the other hand, stresses the 
promotion of ethnic rights through national self-deter-
mination. It has certain academic allure. However, as 
much as European statesmen paid lipservice to this 
ideal at Versailles, it was more honored in the breech 
than the observance in the interwar period. Moreover, 
carried to its discouragingly logical conclusion, this 
model, like Russian nesting dolls, might well lead to a 
state structure composed of increasingly small (and 
untenable) states�Yugoslavia divided into five or six 
states; Bosnia divided into three states; or the Soviet 
Union divided into 15 states, Russia (or Georgia) 
divided into x states, ad infinitum. 
From Marx to Milosovic 
For many the collapse of the Soviet Union represented 
the ultimate triumph of Western liberal democracy. 
Marxist-Leninism had been thoroughly discredited 
as a method of-organizing society. Moreover, for the 
first time in over 400 years, no major power sought 
hegemony in Eastern Europe. With visions of a new 
Marshall Plan, the nations of Central and Eastern 
Europe and the former Soviet Union understandable, 
if naively, believed that the West would willingly open 
its doors�and coffers�to their former adversaries. 
Despite rhetorical sympathy, this has not been the 
case. Perhaps it was inevitable, but new (and age-old) 
problems�ethnic strife, ultranationalism, and mas-
sive migration�quickly replaced Soviet Commu-
nism as the primary threats to Europe. When the walls 
came down in the East, economic and other barriers 
were erected in the West. European governments, 
beset by recession, worried more about halting the 
westward flow of goods and people than about inte-
grating the economies of the East into the European 
Community. 
Adrift between East a�nd West, the countries of the 
former Warsaw Pact perceive themselves in a politi-
cal, economic, and security vacuum. And dema-
gogues, often seeking ethnic scapegoats, plow fertile 
fields of public discontent. Without a sense of being 
part of a larger community�governed by accepted 
rules of behavior�neo-Communist and ethnic nation-
alist may once again set the rules. 
The Nation-State and Ethnic Rights 
What type of state structure can best protect the ethnic 
groups of Europe? The European nation-state has 
been both the traditional protector and persecutor of 
indigenous ethnic groups. Historically, both Germany 
and Russia have assumed a special responsibility for 
their ethnic counterparts wherever they might live. 
(Even today, Germany grants automatic citizenship to 
all ethnic Germans.) These same nation-states, how-
ever, have a melancholy history regarding the treat-
ment of-other minority ethnic and religious groups. By 
the same token, the decline of the nation-state, partic-
ularly in the East, can also lead to increased ethnic 
tensions, as we have witnessed in the former Yugosla-
via. If the traditional nation-state system has often 
180 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
failed to protect ethnic minorities, the collapse of the 
nation-state has not offered an appealing alternative. 
Can Europe's ethnic problems be solved by redrawing 
state frontiers? National and ethnic identities existed 
for centuries before state borders were drawn and 
redrawn, usually by outside interests. What year 
would we use to define the nation-state structure in 
Europe? 1993? 1989? 1945? 1917? Clearly, there is no 
magic formula. While we should not encourage that 
ethnic conflict be solved by changing national bound-
aries, we should not exclude that these boundaries can 
be changed by peaceful means. As in the case of a 
reunified Germany, border changes can be counte-
nanced by the international community if they are 
accepted by all interested parties and accompanied by 
guarantees protecting individual rights and minority 
communities. 
A Kinder and Gentler Europe 
Is there an ideal�or even preferable�state structure 
for Europe today? Perhaps this is the wrong question. 
We should rather ask how Europe can best accommo-
date individual rights, as well as national and ethnic 
pluralism? Clearly, there are no simple answers. How-
ever, we might begin by contemplating a Europe that 
is both more united and less centralized. While the 
nation-state remains the most. significant unit in 
Europe today, its political role is increasingly being 
supplemented by both supernational and subnational 
units. This development is fraught not only with dan-
gers but also with opportunities for a kinder and gen-
tler Continent. 
A Europe, which respects individual and ethnic rights, 
can only be achieved on a deMocratic basis if there is 
grass roots involvement in the process. Logically, 
decisions are best made at the lowest possible level. 
Europeans have dubbed this concept�in the best 
Brussels bureaucratese�"subsidiarity'; Americans 
might call it "federalism." This very American 
approach can lead to practical, not ideological, solu-
tions to local problems from garbage collection to 
minority rights, from electing regional governments to 
establishing native-language schools. 
Autonomy can lead to anarchy, however, unless it is 
accompanied by rules of the road to guide the devel-
opment of a civil society in the East. Without an active 
partnership with the West, it is doubtful whether this 
model can flourish in nations unaccustomed to unre-
strained democracy. Thus, the process of devolution 
of power, particularly in the East, could exacerbate 
ethnic tensions and ultimately threaten democracy 
unless it is guided by institutions based on shared val-
ues. The only appropriate Western response is to inte-
grate the countries east of the Oder-Niesse line to the 
family of democratic nations. This must be done in the 
political sphere by supporting Rnstern reform and 
reformers, in the economic sphere by opening Western 
markets to Eastern goods and in the strategic sphere 
by opening Pastern Europe and eventually nations of 
the former Soviet Union into Western security struc-
tures. 
NATO: A New Mission 
The security of Europe is indivisible. Ethnic conflict, 
ultranationalism, or massive flows of refugees any-
where threaten stability everywhere, including the 
most advanced West European democracies. What 
happens in Central and Eastern Europe also has a 
direct bearing on the fate of the Newly Independent 
States (NIS)�and vice versa. Without the successful 
expansion of the democratic community of nations to 
the East, the stability of Europe cannot be guaranteed. 
A stable security framework, in the view of many 
Eastern democrats, is a precondition for building 
democracies and strong economies in their part of the 
world. While this argument can easily be turned 
around�building viable economies is the best way to 
ensure security�there is no doubt that this perception 
is widely shared. 
181 
Three times in this century the United States has been 
drawn into European wars (two hot, one cold). We 
have learned through painful history that the United 
States cannot remain indifferent to threats to European 
stability. The ethnic conflicts in the former Yugoslavia 
should serve as a poignant reminder that Europe is 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
still a dangerous place and that only one institution 
has the operational capabilities and habits of coopera-
tion to preserve peace and stability on the Continent in 
the post�Cold War era: NATO. 
To accomplish this mission, however, NATO must 
transform itself from an Alliance based on collective 
defense against an identifiable threat into an Alliance 
committed to projecting democracy, stability, and 
crisis management throughout the Continent. This 
cannot be done without engaging the nations to the 
East. The real and potential hotspots in Europe all lie 
in this area. If NATO does not deal with these nations, 
it will become increasingly irrelevant�a closed, 
chummy club without a mission or a message. Any 
new security structure, therefore, must be inclusive 
rather than exclusive; it should not lead to the redivi-
sion of Europe into blocs. 
Over time, therefore, NATO must be open to new 
members, largely to the Fast but also to include the 
neutral and nonaligned states of Europe. This 
approach�which has been called the "Partnership for 
Peace" program�would provide a framework within 
the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) for 
enhanced political and military cooperation. Under 
this rubric the militaries of East and West would plan, 
train, and exercise together. Active cooperation in this 
partnership could lay the foundation for full NATO 
membership. In short, future expansion should be evo-
lutionary, inclusive, and aimed at enhancing the stabil-
ity of Europe. 
Trade, Not Aid 
While the Soviet empire was fragmenting, West Euro-
pean officials smugly maintained that they had 
resolved their remaining differences at Maastricht. A 
united and prosperous European Community, they 
believed, could be protected from the economic and 
political instability in the East. The euphoria was short 
lived. Many Europeans now conclude the Maastricht 
Treaty was drafted "too soon and too quickly." Faced 
with depressed economies and weak governments, 
European polities, like their American brethren, seek 
national solutions to global problems. Western Europe 
threatens to define itself and its world role narrowly. 
Neither parochial nor EC-only solutions, however, 
address the unavoidable fact that the West cannot 
insulate itself from economic decline, ethnic strife, 
and political instability in the East. Their fates are 
intertwined. Ethnic minorities have perhaps most at 
stake in a stable and prosperous Europe. In times of 
recession, populist leaders seek scapegoats, most 
often ethnic minorities. Such conditions create eco-
nomic refugees throughout Europe. 
While Europeans must ultimately determine their own 
economic architecture, Americans have a large stake 
in the outcome. A successful Uruguay Round of the 
world trade talks, to a large degree, hinges on the ame-
nable conclusion of inter-European and US-EC nego-
tiations. It is in our mutual interest, therefore, to 
decrease trade barriers and to increase market access 
to our respective markets. 
European economic integration is of particular interest 
to the countries of Central and Eastern Europe and the 
NIS. Without an outlet for their products, many of the 
leaders of these countries will be tempted to return to 
the false stability and the failed statist policies of the 
past. Just as in the security field, American policy-
makers should seek to extend the zone of economic 
prosperity eastward. We should encourage the expan-
sion of the EC eastward. We should welcome the 
greater integration of the former East Bloc into the 
global trading system. We should lower or eliminate 
inefficient subsidies. In short, trade, not aid, is the best 
guarantee for a prosperous Europe. 
CSCE: Conscience of Europe 
The CSCE has recently been called the conscience of 
Europe. European statesmen from Vacel Havel to 
Margaret Thatcher to Andrey Sakharov have credited 
the 1975 Helsinki Final Act, the founding document 
of CSCE, for providing the intellectual basis for the 
demise of Communism. The CSCE has not always 
received such good press. In 1975 the Soviet leader-
ship believed that the Final Act legitimized the Soviet 
presence in Europe; that is, a sphere of influence. 
182 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
American critics, including Ronald Reagan, con-
curred; the West had sold out to Moscow. 
However, the leaders who founded the CSCE, perhaps 
unknowingly, began a process that would ultimately 
lead to the collapse of the Soviet Empire. By acknowl-
edging that certain principles are inherent and univer-
sal, Moscow, in effect, acknowledged limits to its 
power. It did not have the sovereign right to transgress 
the Helsinki principles either in its colonies or even in 
Mother Russia. Of course, this did not prevent succes-
sive Soviet leaders from ignoring these principles; 
they did, however, lose their intellectual cover. The 
CSCE, with its broad definition of security founded on 
human rights and democracy and its inclusive mem-
bership, helped win the Cold War. 
The CSCE can now help win the peace in Europe by 
establishing human rights norms, protecting ethnic 
minorities, and pursuing low-intensity conflict preven-
tion and peacekeeping activities. Helsinki's broad def-
inition of security also encompasses the conciliation 
and crisis management. To cope with existing and 
potential crises, largely fueled by ethnic conflicts, the 
CSCE has deployed monitor missions to Kosovo, Ser-
bia proper, and Macedonia to prevent a spillover from 
the Bosnian tragedy. It has also deployed or is consid-
ering deploying missions to deorgia, Estonia, and 
Moldova in the former Soviet Union. It has brought 
the parties of the Nagorno-Karabakh dispute to the 
table. 
We should build on these quiet successes. For 
instance, the CSCE High Commissioner on National 
Minorities now has the authority to provide "early 
warning" and, as appropriate, "early action" to 
national minority issues, which have "the potential to 
develop into a conflict." The CSCE can play a role 
that neither NATO, the EC, nor any other European 
institution can play in preventing Bosnia-like conflicts 
and, ultimately, in integrating Eastern Europe and the 
MS into a new Europe. 
Conclusion 
The United States is a nation of idea�not of blood, 
birth or creed. It has largely avoided ethnic strife 
because it has not attempted to build a state based on 
ethnic, racial, or religious homogeneity. If human 
rights and fundamental freedoms belong to the indi-
vidual, then group or collective rights can best be 
addressed through the protection of individual rights. 
As long as ethnicity is seen as the only basis for sort-
ing out human relations or creating nations, we will 
have ethnic conflict in Europe. Group rights can have 
no meaning if the basic human rights are ignored by 
ethnic zealots. 
The best way to address ethnic conflict in Europe is 
through a united, but decentralized, Europe governed 
by mutually accepted rules of behavior. The integra-
tion of Western Europe into institutions�NATO, the 
EC, and the CSCE�founded on fundamental human 
rights, has gone a long way to eliminating territorial 
disputes, irredentist claims, and ethnic grievances 
among and within its member states. We must now 
find creative ways to use these institutions to deal with 
emerging ethnic�and other subregional�tensions 
before they erupt into shooting conflicts. We must 
avoid the situation where every crisis presents a 
choice between inaction and military intervention. We 
must now extend these habits of cooperation to the 
Fast.

Ethnic Conflict and US Policy 
Wade Hinkle 
Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense 
for Policy Planning Department of Defense' 
My task in the next eight minutes is to discuss ethnic 
and national conflict and the US policy response to it. 
Let me tell you what a difficult task it will be; it took 
more than eight minutes for the conference coordina-
tors to describe to me what it was they wanted me to 
cover. Nevertheless, let me take a shot at it. 
Clearly, the last four years have been an exciting time 
to be a planner in defense and national security strat-
egy. I subscribe to what Dr. Gundersen said about the 
end of the Cold War being, in a military sense, the end 
of a very comfortable period of time, when the uni-
verse and its problems were well understood and well 
bounded. I think, however, that we have made some 
progress in the last four years in thinking through 
these issues in the perspective of US national security. 
I also think that Secretary of Defense Les Aspin made 
a good start in his conceptualization of this problem 
by talking about what he called the four dangers to US 
national security in the post�Cold War era: 
� The new nuclear danger Partly an artifact of the 
Cold War, this involves the security of the 30,000 to 
45,000 nuclear weapons that were present on former 
Soviet territory when the Soviet Union broke up. 
Also it involves the possibility of weapons of mass 
destruction proliferating throughout the world. 
� The danger to democracy. This is the possibility of a 
failure of reform in the former Soviet Union. 
� The new economic danger. The Clinton Administra-
tion believes that, without a robust and growing 
economy in the United States, the United States will 
not be strong domestically and will be unable to be 
an effective actor internationally. This danger also 
1 Dr. Hinkle has since left the government and is now a member of 
the Institute for Defense Analyses. 
involves an understanding that the notion of eco-
nomic prosperity abroad is an important component 
of US national security. 
� Ethnic and national conflict. Mr. Aspin clearly sees 
this as one of the principal challenges to US national 
security in the post�Cold War era. 
The United States is in the process of making substan-
tial reductions to its military forces and military bud-
get. By the time the reductions envisioned in the 
Clinton defense program have been implemented, we 
will have eliminated over 1 million people in uniform 
and another quarter of a million civilians from the 
Defense Department. We will have eliminated one-
quarter to one-third of our military forces, and defense 
spending by the end of 1997 will be down to below 
3.5 percent of gross domestic product�the lowest 
level since 1939. 
From the perspective of the defense planner, one of 
the main concerns in making reductions of that scale 
is the possibility that ethnic and national conflict may 
occur in ways that will challenge American and 
defense interests. Some debate has occurred in my 
field of conflict studies, about whether the demise of 
the Cold War has increased or decreased the possibil-
ity of ethnic and national conflict. 
George Kohn's database on conflict shows that there 
have been about three large-scale ethnic and national 
conflicts per year since 1945. This rate did not tail off 
as a result of the end of the Cold War. In terms of non-
state conflict, there have been about nine serious eth-
nically motivated coup attempts each year since 1987. 
But whether ethnic and national conflict is increasing 
or simply remaining at high levels, it clearly poses a 
danger not only to participants and nearby neighbors 
but also to us. This is either because the conflict is 
occurring in critical areas�as with the case in the 
Persian Gulf�or because some of the participants 
are gaining access to increasingly deadlier and more

far-reaching weapons and technology. So the Defense 
Department, and the US Government in general, has 
quite an interest in this phenomenon and is trying to 
understand it and construct a:,strategy to address it. 
In attempting to grapple with this issue, initial think-
ing on a Clinton national security strategy has focused 
on three elements:2 
� Engagement. The United States is committed to 
remaining engaged in international affairs. 
� Prevention. We want to prevent or contain the 
effects of ethnic conflict. We want to use all the ele-
ments of national power, development assistance, 
and trade assistance to prevent conflict, and, if that 
does not work, we want to act early to keep the con-
flict small. 
� Partnership. We want to expand the core group of 
like-minded democratic countries that we forged 
during the Cold War and have this group work as a

tional framework the elements of "engagement" and

partnership to either prevent or to contain conflict. 
We need to work together in a variety of multilateral 
and bilateral ways to marshal all those resources 
together as a partnership for addressing the issue. 
The government needs much more analysis to under-
stand in a robust way the phenomenon of ethnic and 
national conflict. We need academic researchers to 
turn toward applied robust, rigorous, and predictive 
research that we can bring inside the government in 
testable ways and see if we can motivate policy. We 
are not interested in sponsoring more original 
research; as Dr. Ted Gun wrote in his book on conflict 
a few years ago, there are 686 books on the theory of 
conflict�we do not want a 687th. What we want are 
robust, testable, applied research and models that we 
can bring inside the government. We take this problem 
seriously. It is a critical issue of US national security.

Summary of Discussion 
General Discussion 
QUESTION: In your studies of conflict resolution, 
can you give us some examples of effective outside 
intervention into situations of aggressive ethnic 
nationalism. The only good example I can think of is 
the tremendous commitment that was necessary to 
stop Nazi Germany, an aggressive ethnic nationalistic 
state. These kinds of examples are important as we 
think about getting into the situation in Bosnia. 
DR. FINKLE: My field is microstates, and I can tell 
you it worked pretty well in Grenada. But I take your 
point. That is why I think that the emphasis really 
should be on prevention, not intervention. That way, 
you can act more effectively at lower cost and not be 
in the position where you are dealing with interven-
tion. 
Imagine if Saddam Husayn had actually succeeded. 
Twenty years from now, he would have effective con-
trol of 45 percent of the world's oil reserves and 
would be industriously working to build nuclear 
weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. If we 
had the foresight in 1958 to act to facilitate a demo-
cratic transition in Iraq, however, we would not have 
needed the level of resources we used in Desert Storm, 
and the world might be a happier place. Even in 
Grenada, if we just had the foresight to spend a couple 
hundred thousand dollars to preempt the revolution of 
1979, we would have saved 108 American casualties 
in 1983. 
QUESTION: When there was a bipolar world, it was 
fairly easy to identify the strategic interests of the 
United States and the Soviet Union. How would the 
United States feel in regard to Russia resolving ethnic 
conflict in the former Soviet Union. 
DR. GUNDERSEN: We view the issue of conflict and 
peacekeeping in the former Soviet Union from the 
outlook of preventive diplomacy. We do not want to 
see a reenactment of the old view that there is a sphere 
of influence of Russia over the Soviet Union. As long 
as Russia's involvement in its former periphery is 
mandated by an international body�be it the UN or 
the Conference on Security and Cooperation in 
Europe�and as long as certain rules are followed and 
the interests of all the parties are taken into account, 
we are not, in principal, opposed to Russian involve-
ment. 
We also want to contain any ethnic difficulties before 
they spill over. In Tajildstan, more people are being 
killed every day than in Bosnia. We do not hear about 
it because CNN is not there, but certainly there are 
Iranian, Chinese, Turkish, and Russian interests in 
Tajildstan, so we cannot ignore the situation there. I 
think we should be a little more involved in preventive 
diplomacy there. We have limited funds, however, so 
it is difficult going between ends and means.

Concluding Comments: Implications for the 
United States and the International Community: 
Problems and Prospects 
Stanley D. Orunn 
Professor of Geography 
University of Kentucky 
During the past two days we have heard a number of 
formal presentations about ethnic conflict and national-
ism in various world regions. These examinations of 
ethnic and cultural composition and conflict, as well as 
the panel discussions, illustrate the ways geographers 
look at the world and how they envision contemporary 
and future worlds. In summarizing the conference, I 
would like to make the following observations: 
� We live in two different worlds. First, I would like to 
thank those individuals for organizing a conference 
devoted specifically to ethnic conflict, nationalism, 
and changing world order and for inviting academic 
geographers to share with members of the Intelli-
gence Community what they know�and do not 
know�about the current political world. I see this 
conference as serving many useful purposes, one 
being that while "we live in two different houses," 
we share much in common, especially our interests 
in being able to understand what is happening around 
the world�whether in regard to ethnic conflict, 
nationalism, or emerging democracies. It is impor-
tant that the avenues of communication and informa-
tion sharing between those in the university and 
government intelligence communities remain open. 
� How do we look at the world? How we look at the 
world reflects our backgrounds as well as our day-
by-day work experiences and assignments. These 
experiences are of utmost importance in helping us 
and others see how we look at our culture vis-a-vis 
others. 
The Dynamic Political World 
What Is the State of the World Political Map? 
At any time it is useful to remember the state of the 
world, or, better stated, the world political map. That 
map reflects constant dynamism in name changes�
border adjustments, political realignments, as well as 
flashpoints and conflict. There are a wide variety of 
states with varying degrees of stability and instability. 
It is important to keep in mind that world order and 
disorder can be viewed in a variety of contexts. While 
the term new political order may be in vogue this year, 
there is not just one order, but many. At various times 
and places on the world map, order or disorder can be 
observed at local, regional, and macroregional levels. 
We Live in Shared/Divided Spaces 
All humans live to some degree in "bounded spaces." 
Some of those may be spaces defined by majority pop-
ulations, others defined by outside powers. Within 
those bounded spaces, we often find people of varying 
ethnic, religious, linguistic, racial, or other heritages. 
The distribution of various groups often overlap. 
Those groups may live in harmony�sharing the same 
work, play, worship, and family spaces or they may be 
divided. 
We Live in Local and Global Worlds 
The world political map is much more complicated 
than the standard reference maps that depict close to 
200 political states. There are many scales at which 
groups and communities interact. Some interactions 
are local, others are global. It is important that those of 
us who analyze political development acknowledge 
these complexities. 
Are We "Prisoners" of Our Maps? 
In listening to the presenters the past several days and 
in the discussions among panel members and the audi-
ence, it seems that we may, in fact, be "prisoners" of 
our maps, especially the familiar political map of the 
world�which simplifies political space and rein-
forces the status quo. Do we still use time-honored 
Mercator projections, which distort the spaces in the 
high latitudes? Are the maps we use Europe centered, 
as if subtly conveying the notion that Europe is the 
most important region of the world? How do we look 
at polar areas, with maps that have such areas at the 
"top" and "bottom"? How do we look at the Pacific 
Rim countries, with maps splitting the Pacific Ocean 
187 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
at the left and right sides? Or do we have maps with 
the Pacific Ocean in the middle and the Asian and 
American landmasses at the left and right. Perhaps 
one of our difficulties is using old maps with old 
boundaries and names, which tend to convey mes-
sages of stability at global and regional levels. Do we 
regularly in our research, classroom, and lectures uti-
lize maps that portray boundary stability, ethnic har-
mony or complexity, or gradations of tyranny and 
democracy? Powerful messages are conveyed through 
maps and projections. As an instructor, I am reminded 
how more valuable the maps are in the State of the 
World Atlases�including the specialized ones on 
women, military, and environment�than are those in 
our textbooks and frequently used atlases. We would 
do well to develop other innovative maps for various 
users. 
Which Way Are We Looking as We Approach the 
Next Century? 
At this time it is useful to think about how we 
approach the study of the future. Are we looking back-
wards as we look ahead or do we look ahead without 
the burden of hindsight? The question might be simi-
lar to that raised above about map projections. Are we 
too frozen in our thinking to look at the dynamics 
occurring around us? Certainly the next 10 to 20 years 
will call for looking at the world differently than the 
past 10 to 20 years. Will we try to use models, theo-
ries, and policies from the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s�
many of which did not help us then�for the future? 
Or will we be willing to realize the need for working 
constantly with alternative systems and models that 
may be completely non-Western in logic, purpose, and 
design? The true test will be whether scholars, and 
those communities that rely on scholarly inquiry, will 
be able to be imaginative and creative in exploring the 
purposes and cross-purposes of what is being 
observed, written, and practiced. 
Major Issues Meriting Attention 
As a geographer interested in global politics, I identify 
six major areas that I think will be important within 
the next 20 years. They are the environment, religion, 
secularization, sports, territory, and information/com-
munication. 
How "Green" Is Your Thinking? 
Environmental questions are being raised in all areas 
of human livelihood. This includes making decisions 
about where crops will be grown as well as where 
industries will locate. Although there is much support 
for environmental thinking and policies, progress is 
not attained easily, in part because many people have 
difficulty seeing the need to incorporate green think-
ing into education, religion, politics, and economies. 
A true test is whether those who teach political geog-
raphy will successfully incorporate green thinking 
into spheres traditionally excluded from such thought. 
Religion as if Politics Mattered 
As the events of the past couple decades have demon-
strated, religion is an important element in our exami-
nation of foreign affairs. It is not only the rise of 
Islamic fundamentalism�again, a Western label�in 
the Middle East that illustrates the significance of this 
issue but also militancy in the name of religion in Ire-
land, Israel/Palestine, India, and Pakistan. Evangelical 
groups and liberation theologians have confronted the 
politics in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. In South 
Africa as well as in former Eastern Europe, the church 
at times has been active in pushing for political 
reforms. In many countries, those seeking political 
office are courted and supported by certain religious 
groups. The importance of religion as a component in 
the politics in many states and regions cannot be over-
looked. Leaders often look to the state-church or to 
important church leaders for support and encourage-
ment. To dismiss the growing importance of religion 
in emerging democracies, the blurring of church-state 
separateness in others, and the importance of the spiri-
tual dimension in human life is to neglect an important 
component of raison d' etre in many societies. Aca-
demics and policymakers would be wise to devote as 
much time to studying a society's religion as they do 
its economy in order to understand the decisions and 
actions of leaders, political parties, and citizen groups. 
The Rise of Secularization 
The rise of secularization in the world is not ques-
tioned. I do not see this emergence as a corollary to 
what I stated about religion above. But I observe there 
is a growth of a secular society, including emphasis on 
188 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
consumerism and, especially, 'American products; the 
demise of traditional institutions, including political 
ideology; and the rise of a "here and now" mentality 
that stresses individualism, the appearance of wealth, 
and a veneer of globalism in foods, clothing, music, 
and lifestyles. Secularization on the rise leads to a 
decline in traditional institutions, be they family and 
community, formal political parties, the role of the 
church, the functions of schools, or the importance of 
collective memories. 
Sports and Society: The New Ball Game 
One of the emerging forms of social identity in many 
countries is sports. Sports not'only represent outlets 
for a public's need for entertainment but also some-
thing deeper about society's need for identity and rep-
resentation. What started out during pretelevision days 
as teams of athletes who were paid to entertain local 
or regional audiences has now changed into national 
teams that somehow stand for and represent a city, a 
region, or even the state itself, As audiences follow 
favorite teams, more and more teams have been cre-
ated, further increasing local identity, regionalism, and 
national pride�all in the name of "friendly" competi-
tion. Nevertheless, more than one local conflict has 
emerged between fans of one national team fighting 
fans of another. The political geographer or policy 
consultant interested in understanding the seculariza-
tion of a society would be wise to ferret out the role 
sports play in the political identity of a group or soci-
ety. 
Land: Yours or Mine 
Land or territory was historically associated with the 
definition of the state. This raison d'etre was impor-
tant in conveying to those within the state that certain 
spaces gave the state and people identity. Those 
spaces were to be protected from outsiders, should 
they decide to enter. The past several centuries of 
Europeanizing the world conveys strongly the impor-
tance of land, territory, ownership, governance, and 
protection. Those spaces "on the ground" and on the 
map further gave legitimacy to strongly held views 
about ownership, symbolism, and identity. 
While many of the bounded spaces on the planet may 
seem static, there are dynamics linked to some spaces; 
That dynamism is associated with groups within those 
defined spaces who want their own spaces; in short, 
their own places to govern themselves. Those who 
support self-determination claim that they cannot be 
represented by majority populations in the bounded 
spaces who have little interest in minority group con-
cerns. Those minorities may be religious, ethnic, or 
linguistic. These "stateless" peoples believe that they 
have a legal claim to govern themselves; in some 
cases, they present historical claims to spaces that 
were previously taken from them by outsiders. 
It is not only the territory that is in question but also 
what is in and on that land. The land may contain 
places of historical settlements, ceremonial and burial 
grounds, and sites of sacred rivers, mountains, or for-
ests. These places may be an important part of the 
unwritten histories of minority and disenfranchised 
groups. The importance of land is not to be dimin-
ished as we approach the next century. It seems very 
likely that there will be emerging claims and counter-
claims to land and water spaces by competing groups 
now living in the same spaces. National and interna-
tional courts seem likely to be involved in the litiga-
tion efforts by unrepresented and underrepresented 
groups. 
Information and Communication 
Whether scholars and government offices and officers 
are or will be able to understand the role of the United 
States in the world community of states during the 
next few decades rests in large part on how much they 
understand about information and communications. 
These two areas of postindustrial society were not key 
20 to 40 years ago but are becoming more important 
each day. In the same way that leaders and practitio-
ners will need to know the role of environment, reli-
gion, and secularization, so they will need to grasp the 
realities of global information and communication. I 
have identified several crucial issues that relate to 
those with interests in ethnicity, conflict, social 
change, and political decisionmaldng: 
� The information blizzard. How do we decide what is 
important and what is not? With the volumes of 
information that cross our desks, deciding what is 
most and least important is crucial. One might well 
expect the information load to increase at least 
189 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
50 percent within the next decade as more informa-
tion is generated and stored but not necessarily ana-
lyzed or understood. Sometimes, I think "we don't 
know what we don't know." Such information gaps 
are especially apparent when working with new 
democracies, new ideologies, and problems related 
to human welfare. 
� How do we communicate? How we communicate is 
always a problem and will remain so far among 
those who attempt to understand global political 
changes. The introduction of faster and cheaper 
modes of communication�modems, FAX machines 
and e-mail�literally place more locations on the 
planet within easy reach of others that are con-
nected. It is important to know from where the infor-
mation comes and its credibility. 
� CNN and photographs. CNN, out of Atlanta, is 
replacing the standard news organizations and 
sources. This "global newspaper of the air" reaches 
all parts of the world. What viewers see are CNN's 
views of the world. Literally, we could say that "We 
are watching CNN and CNN is watching us." The 
second part of This instant television of the-world is 
the growing importance of images conveyed to glo-
bal audiences by CNN and other television net-
works. Photos are replacing words and speeches as 
the important elements in many international policy 
decisions. 
� Surveys and polls. One of the consequences of the 
information revolution is the increased use of polls 
and surveys at local, regional, and global levels. 
Those groups surveyed may have narrow or broad 
support among a state's population; for this reason, 
the geographic results of surveys and polls take on 
added meaning. The use of these surveys, whether 
designed and conducted fairly or manipulated, can 
form an important weapon on the part of the state to 
conduct specific policies in certain regions and with 
certain groups. 
Learning About Conflict and Cooperation 
Much of the discussion during the past few days has 
focused on ethnic conflict within states and regions. 
As we have learned, there are multiple causes of local 
and regional conflict, and conflict assumes different 
forms in different locations and political settings. 
There is no question that the geographies and politics 
of conflict�especially ethnic and racial conflict�will 
assume center stage in many regions during the next 
few decades. 
While we spend time and energy studying the causes 
and geographies of conflict, we also would be wise to 
investigate conflict resolution. That is, what are the 
alternatives to keep conflict? What are useful local 
and regional strategies that governments and other 
institutions�including religious, educational, and 
volunteer ones�might implement to conflict situa-
tions from emerging. Or, once conflict has surfaced, 
what can be done to lessen or resolve the conflict or 
prevent it from spreading. Much of the conflict resolu-
tion literature focuses on information�who knows 
what about another group. Understanding conflict and 
conflict resolution is best not left only to experts in the 
government or universities who study cultural, poli-
tics, and social change. It also must be an integral part 
of the educational system in early and middle school 
years. Just as one learns to hate and practice discrimi-
nation, so one can learn strategies to reduce conflict, 
hatred, and discrimination and see the benefits of rec-
onciliation. 
Looking Ahead 
In closing, I think it is important to train and retrain 
professionals for the future geopolitical worlds of the 
next 25 to 50 years. This entails an understanding and 
appreciation of the new global diversities that the 
planet's leaders and citizens will face. There are not 
one or two best solutions to problems, but potentially 
a host of alternatives. Somehow it is important to 
develop familiarity with various models and method-
ologies ranging from scenario writing to complex 
mathematical computer gaming. Specialists need to be 
constantly investigating creative alternatives to exist-
ing or anticipated problems. Being bold, creative, and 
imaginative are more important than being bound by 
disciplinary strategems, traditional solutions, and regi-
mented ideologies and philosophies. 
190

Finally, there is much discussion these days about 
inventing and reinventing institutions. These terms 
potentially could usher in new thinking in universities, 
governments, and the private sector. The major issues 
of the next 25 to 50 years will call for specialists 
trained differently than in the past and today. Already 
I have indicated that information, communication, 
environment, religion, conflict, and secularization 
need to be pervasive threads in learning and practice. 
Rather than delegating "x" subject to one discipline 
and "y" to another, those are best examined in trans-
disciplinary and interdisciplinary contexts. To accom-
plish this will most likely call for an overhaul of many 
of the ways we learn, conduct business, and solve 
problems. This is a challenge best met by transdisci-
plinarians and by specialists who look both backward 
and forward and have both local and global outlooks.

Summary of Discussion 
Discussant: Rex Honey 
I would like us to be able to understand history but not 
be trapped by it. One of the things that makes resolv-
ing some problems in Africa more likely than in Bos-
nia is that the Africans do not have the kind of written 
history that dates back several hundred years. As such, 
they cannot pinpoint who the villains were: the names 
of the groups have changed. 
We need to understand that oppressed people have 
legitimate grievances, and we need to make sure that 
we do not support oppressive regimes. 'With the Cold 
War over, the latter may not be as likely as it has been 
in the past. But we need to be a part of a forward-look-
ing movement that will establish institutions to help 
prevent problems and to respond to existing ones. 
In addition, we need to support human rights globally, 
not just in terms of individual rights but also in terms 
of cultural rights. This includes being able to study 
in your own language rather than in an alien one. If 
people see themselves as being treated justly, then 
existing problems will be lessened, and we will be 
able to prosper along with the people with whom we 
share this globe. 
Discussant: Harm J. de Blij 
I was born in the Netherlands, and I'm interested in 
the news of the day from there. Today, the news from 
Holland had two items relevant to our discussion. 
First, Curacao is considering holding a vote on whether 
to reenter the Kingdom of the Netherlands as a prov-
ince or a colony. Things are not going well economi-
cally in Curacao, and the island is seriously considering 
becoming the Martinique of the Netherlands' empire. 
Second, the Province of Zeeland discovered about a 
month ago that in 1648, when the seven states of the 
Netherlands signed a peace agreement with Spain, it 
did not sign the agreement. Although 7PP1and is now 
planning to sign the agreement and is inviting Spain 
to the signatory ceremony, the issue of paying the 
reparations that were not made three centuries ago 
has also been raised. Reparations are a serious issue 
because it is the objective of certain ethnic groups to 
raise the issue of who did wrong to whom and who 
should pay for that wrong. 
I would also like to make an observation on environ-
mental change as it relates to changes in the sociopo-
litical sphere. Although many people are sceptical of 
interlinkages, I want to suggest seriously that many of 
the problems that we are seeing in the world today, 
such as fragmentation, dislocation, migration, sunbelt 
movements, and other locational changes, are in part 
an instinctive human reaction to environmental 
change. I would refer you to a book by Jean Grove 
called The Little Ice Age. It may be that our behavior, 
including ethnic strife, has something to do with the 
deteriorating environments in which relations among 
groups are being played out. 
General Discussion 
DR. WIXMAN: An interesting point that came out 
particularly in this last session is that we talk about 
voluntarism on the part of the peoples involved. 
The falling apart of the Soviet Union will probably be 
followed by a restructuring, and what Estonians, 
ICazalchs, and Ukrainians can do voluntarily through 
mutual respect and independence is probably a lot bet-
ter than the situation when the Soviet Union was dom-
inated by the center. 
I think one of the keys to future stability is not to 
oppose the secessionist movements but to allow such 
movement. This almost invariably leads to better rela-
tions between the seceder and the parent state. 
DR. DE BLU: But the problem with that is, "where 
does the secessionist sequence end?" 
DR. WIXMAN: True. 
DR. DE BLIJ: Someone today talked about the neces-
sity of providing recognition. Well, the problem in 
the case of Bosnia was that recognition was given 
192 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
Approved for Release: 2018/06/01 C00123268 
prematurely. This then precipitated a concern on the 
part of Serbs who did not want to be a part of an inde-
pendent state in which, they felt, their human rights 
would be threatened. 
Take the case of Georgia. Georgia, which seceded 
from Russia, is now trying to ,stop Abkhazia from 
seceding. Where does it all end? This trouble comes 
with every secession. Unless there is some way in 
which that can be codified and stratified, it will be 
chaos. 
DR. HONEY: I agree with you. Virtually no state in 
Africa has an order that was determined by African 
peoples. Why should the peoples of Africa not have 
the same kind of self-determination that at least some 
non-Africans have enjoyed in other places? 
DR. WIXMAN: But what often happens when the 
secessionist movement is denied? Are we going to 
dictate that people live together in shotgun wedding 
relationships? Should we say to Croats, Muslims, and 
Serbs, "You must live together," when we would not 
do that ourselves? I agree that'there are perils of seces-
sionism, but the peril of not doing it, I think, is equally 
dangerous. 
Do we tell Moldova that it cannot become indepen-
dent from the Soviet Union because 12 percent of its 
population would be unhappy? Do we tell Georgia 
that it should not secede because 100,000 out of 6 mil-
lion people will be unhappy? I think countries need to 
be prepared for independence, not leap into it, but the 
lack of preparation is the problem. 
DR. DE BLIJ: May I make one other point? That 
relates to the issue of boundaries. In 1992 the United 
States went to the Baltic stated and talked about solv-
ing problems within existing borders. When this 
occurred, I cringed; just as pipelines and roads can be 
moved, boundaries, which are here to serve us, can be 
moved. If it is time to move them, let them be moved. 
You are never going to have total agreement on mov-
ing boundaries. In fact, hundreds of thousands of 
casualties occurred when Pakistan was separated from 
India. Nevertheless, this action probably saved mil-
lions of lives. All countries and all people should be 
able to argue about moving their boundaries. 
DR. MURPHY: Dr. de Blij's last comment, in a sense, 
touched on a point I wanted to make. When we think 
about the issue of potential fragmentation, what are 
we thinking about in terms of the units we end up 
with? I think our tendency is to think about conven-
tional units of sovereign states. 
One of the most remarkable things Dr. Williams 
alluded to yesterday was that, in Western Europe, the 
major threats are not seen as the regional secessionist 
movements. Why is that the case? It could well have 
something to do with the changing nature of sover-
eignty in Europe. It could also have to do with the fact 
that it is possible for someone in a region within a 
state to feel multiple layers of identity, some of which 
are attached to being a European. 
DR. HINKLE: We seem to be, in one sense, moving 
toward an international norm of the rule of law in gov-
erning intrastate relations, individual human rights, 
and collective group rights. It is going to be hard to 
reconcile that with the proposition that you cannot 
allow norms of international behavior to stand in the 
way of a rational adjustment of international bound-
aries just because it seems to balance out in terms of 
demographics or some other factor. 
DR. DE BLU: But we are trapped in such a boundary 
in South Africa. In that country, partition, even some 
sort of a temporary confederal arrangement, might 
ease the fears that are presently ripping the place 
apart. What is so great about keeping South Africa in 
one piece? It has no history of integration. It has 
always been a divided country. 
DR. HONEY: Dr. Gundersen said we should not ask 
for redrawn boundaries because such change would 
have to be agreed upon by all parties. Well, if it is 
democratic, what does that mean? Democratic can 
mean 50 percent plus one. 
DR. GUNDERSEN: I would just refer to the facts of 
the last two years. In alluding to the statement by 
former Secretary of State Baker on Yugoslavia and the 
statement by former President Bush on Kiev, I was 
saying that the United States was trapped in a certain 
east-west bipolar context.

Today, we have 53 states in Europe; there were 32 in 
1991. That is a major change. It is the largest change 
in Europe since 1917 or 1648, depending on how you 
look at it. It has been done largely without violence 
and largely within a relatively democratic context, and 
it has been agreed to by those states. The United 
States has recognized those states: the Czech Repub-
lic, Slovakia, the Baltic states, and the other states that 
have emerged from the former Soviet Union, as well 
as those from Yugoslavia. 
So it is possible to reconcile the idea of-accepting the 
concept of territorial integrity and that of peaceful 
changes of borders. It is difficult, but I do not see any 
major intellectual pitfall. I think US policy has cer-
tainly evolved over the last two years on this quest. 
DR. SCHWAR1ZBERG: One of the things that I 
think we can do is to try to empower the only interna-
tional organization that ought to have universal legiti-
macy�the United Nations. One of the UN's major 
organs, the Trusteeship Council, has virtually nothing 
to do any longer. There is no reason why the- Council 
should not be transformed into a Human Rights Coun-
cil and be run by a high commissioner for human 
rights, who would have greatly expanded powers. 
While very few nations are not guilty of some 
excesses in regard to human rights, some are much 
worse than others, and those are the ones that have to 
be tackled first. We need an agency with legitimacy to 
do that. 
The UN can do that. It will make mistakes to be sure, 
but we should get behind the UN and give it power to 
address global problems. Global problems require glo-
bal solutions. The UN ought to be the global instru-
ment.
