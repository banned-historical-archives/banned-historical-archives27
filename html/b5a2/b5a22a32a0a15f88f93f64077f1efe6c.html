 //BRAZIL:  BRAZIL'S RUSH TO RECOGNIZE THE POPULAR MOVEMENT FOR
 THE LIBERATION Of ANGOLA ON THE DAY THE AFRICAN TERRITORY BECAME
 INDEPENDE?!r REQUIRES MORE EXPLANATION THAN THE BRAZILIANS HAVE SO

 THEPPOLICY IMPLICIT IN THE INSTRUCTIONS GIVEN TO THE BRAZILIAN
 MISSION IN LUANDA WHEN IT WAS ESTABLISHED LAST JANUARY, WHICH WZRE
 TO OBSERVE EVENTS. CLOSELY, BUT TO STAY OUT OP DOMESTIC MATTERS.//V
 /IFOREIGH MINISTRY OFFICIALS CAN MAINTAIN THAT RECOGNITION
 DOES ROT MEAN APPROVAL AND THAT BRASILIA HAS, IN STRICT LEGAL TERPS..
 MERELY ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE MPLA IS IN DE FACTO CONTROL OF THE
 ANGOLAN CAPITAL.  THE F IR NZI  OF THIS SHAKY POSTURE, HOWEVER, WILL
 ALMOST CERTAINLY BE TESTED BY THE WARRING AFRICAN MOVEMENTS IN
 ACTIONS THAT COULD PROVE HIGHLY EMBARRASSING TO THE BRAZILIANS.  THE
 DIPLOMATIC GESTURE PROBABLY HAS ALREADY CAUSED SOME CHAGRIN AMONG
 ?C'NSERVATIVE BRAZILIAN MILITARY OFFICERS, WHO SEC THAT THEIR GOVERN-
 MENT IS VIRTUALLY ALONE INRRECOGNIZING A REGIME THAT OWES ITS
 EXISTENCE TO SOVIET AND CUBAN MILITARY SUPPORT.//Y

 LONG TERfl, THE ANGOLANS 'RILL RE?IE lBER ONLY THAT BRAZIL WAS AMONG THE
 FIRST TO RECOGNIZE THE NEW NATION.  FOREIGN MINISTER ANTONIO AZERED4
 DA SILVEIRA HAS SAID PRIVATELY THAT A MAJOR CONSIDERATION UZI TO SPUR
 THE ESTABLISHMENT OF RELATIONS BETWEEN BRAZIL AND MOZAMBIQUE--VIRICH
 FOLLOWED ON NOVEflBER IS.  ULTIMATELY THE BRAZILIANS SEEK TO EXPAND
 TRADE RELATIONS AND FORGE CLOSER DIPLOMATIC TIES WITH THE EflERGINs
 NATIONS OF PORTUGUESE AFRICA.   THESE ASPIRATIONS MAY PROVE TO BE
 OVERLY OPTIMISTIC DESPITE BRAZIL'S APPARENT EAGERNESS TO ERASE THE
 PAST.  BECAUSE OP BRAZIL'S HISTORICAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE AFRICAN
 SLAVE TRADE AND ITS TACIT SUPPORT Of PORTUGUESE FOREIGN POLICY, IT
 IS ONLY SLIGHTLY LESS RESENTED THAN THE PORTUGUESE THEMSELVES.

 .ENTRANCE EXAMINATIONS HAVE BEEN A PARTICULARLY CONTENTIOUS. ISSUE
 SINCE 1973, WHEN A COALITION OF PARTY LEFTISTS AND SOME MILITARY
 MEN OPPOSED THEIR USE AND FORCED PEKING TO PUT LESS EMPHASIS ON
 //CHINA'S INTELLECTUALS REPORTEDLY HAVE BEEN RELUCTANT TO HELP
 THE UNIVERSITIES IMPROVE THEIR CURRICULA FOR FEAR THAT' EDUCATIONAL
 POLICY WILL SUFFER YET ANOTHER REVERSAL. DESPITE THEIR MISGIVINGS,
 IT APPEARS THAT THE MAJORITY OF CHINA'S POLITICAL LEADERS ARE
 INTENT ON IMPROVING THE EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM AS THE FIRST STEP
 TOWARD MODERNIZING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY.//Y
 //ALTHOUGH PREMIER CHOU EN-LAI COMPLAINED AS EARLY AS LAST
 JANUARY-THAT THE CURRENT EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM IS NOT ADEQUATE FOR
 CHINA3'S ECONOMIC NEEDS, IT WAS APPARENTLY NOT UNTIL MAO'S APPROVAL
 OF CHANGES WAS MADE KNOWN IN JUNE THAT EDUCATORS BEGAN MAKING
 :4 IMPROVEMENTS. MAO'S RECENT STATEMENTS ON EDUCATION, HIS FIRST
 SINCE THE CULTURAL REVOLUTION, HAVE BEEN THE MISSING INGREDIENT
 IN THE LONG-STANDING EFFORTS OF PEOPLE LIKE CHOU EN-LAI AND
 TENG HSIAO-PING TO MAKE MUCH-NEEDED CHANGES IN THE UNIVERSITIES.

 EUROPEAN BRIEF 180-75Y
 1. PORTUGAL: INFORMED SOURCES IN LISBON SAY THE GOVERNMENT'S
 STRATEGY OF SUSPENDING ITS ACTIVITIES ON THURSDAY CONSTITUTES AN
 ULTIMATUM TO PRESIDENT COSTA GOMES TO FIRE SECURITY CHIEF OTELO DE
 CARVALHO AND ARMY CHIEF OF STAFF CARLOS FABIAO.Y
 THE CENTER-LEFT POPULAR DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS STATED THAT THE
 GOVERNMENTON'S ACTION WAS ENDORSED BY THEM, THE SOCIALISTS, AND
 THE "ANTUNES NINE" AND THAT THEIR DEMANDS ARE NOT NEGOTIABLE.',
 ALTHOUGH NO RESOLUTION OF THE DISPUTE IS ANTICIPATED FOR
 SEVERAL DAYS, DURENG WHICH TIME COSTA GOMES IS EXPECTED TO PROPOSE
 VARIOUS COMPROMISE SOLUTIONS, IN THE END IT IS HOPED THE PRESIDENT
 WILL BOW TO THE GOVERNMENT'S WISHES. IF HE FAILS TO GO ALONG, IT
 IS AVERRED, HE MAY BE REPLACED--BUT THE PLAN FOR ACCOMPLISHING-THIS IS
 NOT SPELLED OUT.'1'
 WHILE THE GOVERNMENT PROBABLY FEELS IT HAS NO VIABLE ALTERNATIVE
 SHORT OF O;,TRIGHT RESIGNATION OR CAPITULATION TO COMMUNIST DEMANDS
 FOR GREATER REPRESENTATION, ITS PRESENT COURSE DOES CONTAIN SOME IMIN
