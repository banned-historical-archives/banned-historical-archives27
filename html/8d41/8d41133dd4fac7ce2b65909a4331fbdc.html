 18 FEBRUARY 1970
 Western press reports on a Soviet-Cypriot agreement on the sale of army
 to Cyprus.  The last formal Soviet statement on Cyprus was a Soviet
 Government statement in November 1967 prompted by the tense Cypriot-
 Turkish relations.
 Prior to the current TASS statement, PRAVDA'a writer on Cypriot and
 Greek affairs, Bragin, had dealt in several articles with the "serious
 situation" resulting from the National Front's "subversive activity,"
 citing assessments by President Makarios, house president Kliridhio,
 and AKEL, the Cypriot communist party.  In a 30 January article he
 charged that Athens officers occupying command positions in the Cyyriot
 National Guard were playing an "extremely challenging and provoca&?ive
 role"; operating under directives of the Greek military junta, he said,
 they were waging an "unbridled campaign" against the "progressive
 forces" and the Cyprus Government.  According to Cyprus press reports,
 Bragin added, they were "slanderously attacking" Makarios and
 "threatening an Athena-style military putsch."  The terrorists,
 Bragin said, took these activities as instruction for action and
 exploded a bomb at the presidential palace as well as at the house of
 AKEL General Secretary Pr.paioannou.
 Bragin said the Cypriots were demanding that the government adopt more
 resolute measures to deal with the "criminal bands."  A commentary
 broadcast to Cyprus in Greek on 2 February and in Turkish on the 4th
 had welcomed approval of the preventive detention law by the House of
 Representatives the week before as e. "most important event" in the life
 if the republic.  The new law, ratified in response to the terrorist
 activities, was viewed as of "g'eat significance" for maintaining order
 and safeguarding the country's security.

 MOSCOW DENIES HOSTILE INTENT; TREATY ANNIVERSARY IGNORED
 As the 14 February anniversary--the 20th--of the Sino-Soviet treaty
 cC : ;.liance passed without notice by either aide for the fourth
 successive year, PRAVDA on the 15th carried an article by an
 original member of the Soviet negotiating twsm at the Peking talks
 denoune,ing Western speculation over a possible Soviet attack on
 China and reaffirming Moscow's peaceful intentions.  The PRAVDA
 article, by Soviet; sinologist S. 'i'ikhvinskiy, represents the most
 car,did expression of Mo3co,,'a ecncern over opportunities accruing
 to the United States to a,.quire leverage and maneuverability in the
 triangular power relationship as a result of Sino-Soviet tensions.
 The article interprets works such as Harrison Salisbury's recent
 book on a possible Sirio-Soviet war as being an appeal to Washington
 to normalize relations with the I'RC while also being addressed to
 anti-Soviet elements in Peking which may be receptive to U.S.
 overtures.
 On the date of the Sino-Soviet treaty anniversary the Moscow press
 carried a TASS report on a meetinf? of activists of the Soviet-
 Chinese Friendship Society who reminisced about Soviet missionary
 work during "Soviet-Chinese cooperation in various stages of the
 Chinese revolution."  While noting that speakers at the Moscow
 meeting stressed "the great significance of the friendship" between
 the two peoples, the report does not mention the treaty.
 Though the Tikhvinskiy article refers in general terms to Soviet
 uff:ort3 to normalize stat  relations with the PRC and to Chinese
 territorial claims, it does not mention the Peking talks, and
 PRAVDA does; not identify T'ikhvinskiy's association with the Soviet
 delegation.   In what mr;zr have been another of the leaks coming
 from each side, S;vict  Journalist Victor Louis, writing in the
 London EJENING NEWS c:,n 11 February, referred to new tension on
 the border and suggested that chief Soviet negotiator Kuznetsov
 may soon be recalled?     An 18 February article in the Polish paper
 ZYCIF WAlHSZAWY, devoted mainly to the Sino-U.S, ambassadorial
 talks in Warsaw, observes that no progress has been reported in the
 Sino-Soviet talks alter four months, and It  adds that this must be
 kept in mind when assessing the Warsaw talks. A Moscow broadcast in
 Mendarir on the 12th mentioned the Peking talks in citing a Hungarian
 paper as noting that the Chinese had temporarily suspended their
 anti-Soviet polemics at the time the talks opened but had subsequently
 resumed them,

 Peking has initiated no new attacks on the Soviets since its 9 February
 denunciation of Moscow's dealings with Bonn.  Another attack on the
 Soviet leadership did appear, however, in a 17 February NCNA summary
 of an article in the Albanian ZERI I POPULLIT assailing "the Soviht
 Brezhnev-Kosygin renegade cl:Lque."*  The PRC's observances over the
 weekend of the anniversary of the South Vietnameoe PLAF failed to
 attack the Soviets.
 HISTORICAL REVIEWS OF     Couched in terms of a denunciation of Harrison
 SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS     Salisbury's "War Between Russia and China" as
 an attempt to prevent the normalization of
 Sino-Soviet relations, the Tikhvinskiy PRAVDA artic1  -provides a
 historical review of Soviet relations with China in an effort to counter
 a picture of "age-old and irreconcilable" antagonism between the two
 giants on the Eurasian land mass. In rebuttal Tikhvinskiy portrays an
 unceasing Soviet struggle "to deliver China from the yoke of the
 imperialist powers," pointing to Soviet renunciation of "all unequal
 agreements and treaties at one time imported or, china by tsarism" and
 of "all the concessions, rights, and privileges obtained by the
 Russian bourgeoisie and bureaucracy,,"
 Using the attack on Salisbury'"s book to present Mogcow'-s position on the
 border dispute, Tikhvinskiy accuses Salisbury of falsifying the history
 of the carder question, repeating "the slanderous fabrications of Chinese
 nationalist propaganda on the supposed 'exploitation' of China by the
 Soviet Union, on certain 'territorial seizures' by the USSR in China, and
 on mythical Soviet claims to Chinese lands," and concurrently defending,
 the "chauvinist, hegemonist policy of the Chinese nationalists.' territorial
 claims on the Soviet Union and the MPR."  This.-sort of language has been
 absent from Soviet comment since a?;reement was reached to hold talks with
 the Chinese.
 Apart from these r`marks on the border dispute, Tikhvinskiy ignores the
 past decade of Sino-Soviet relations.   Accentuating the positive, he
 echoes themes struck in recent installments of a continuing Radio Moscow
 series in Mandarin, "Gl,,rious Chapters in the History of Soviet-Chinese
 Relations," when he recalls the decisive assistance rendered to the
 Chinese by the Soviets in defeating the Japanese during World War II and
 in liberating large areas of China.  Tikhvinskiy reminisces about the
 "holiday of fries-dship" which celebrated the arrival of the Soviet army
 in Port Arthur in .19.5.
 The 14 February installment in the historical series in Mandarin, while
 skirting the Sino-Soviet {treaty signed on that date 20 years earlier,
 emphasized Soviet asci::texree to the development of Manchuria, including

 LEADERSHIP       to "nationalist" elemc:nto in Peking who may be inclined
 to play realpolitik with the West against Moscow, also
 seems implicitly aimed at bolstering the position of what the Soviets cal.
 "internationalist" elements in Peking--those favorable to an accommodatic
 with Moscow.  This appears to be the point of Tikhvinskly's protestations
 of Moscow's peaceful intent and his rebuttal of those in the West attempt i .,;5
 "to intimidate the Chinese leaders with the bugbear of a Soviet threat cu;.
 to push the r9C into the arms of the United States."
 Tikhvinskiy avoids mentioning Mao, but a 17 F& r1tary TASS commentary
 repeatedly mentions Mao and the "Maoists" in picturing a "bitter strugglt
 for leadership within the CCP at a time of party reorganization.  The
 Maoists, TASS says, fear that rehabilitation of party cadres might lead
 to the restoration of party organs which could "again question the
 leadership of the Great Helmsman and his deputy."
 A 13 February commentary broad_.~.st in English to Asia. ever Moscow's
 pu.-pertedly unofficial Radio Peace and Progress represents the sharpest
 and most detailed portrayal of divisions at the top levels of the
 Chinese leadership to appear in Soviet media since the agreement to
 hold talks was announced.  The broadcast pictures a "bitter struggle" ove;
 China's future economic courses with Mao Tse-tung pressing a "reckless
 big leap policy" in opposition to "the realistic course of regulation" of
 the economy "backed by Chou En-lai."   Both antagonists, the broadcast st
 "have groups of influential fc1lowers."
 Chou has largely been spared in the virulent portraits of Mao and othe
 members of the Peking hierarchy that have appeared in Soviet propaganda i'
 recent years.  On the positive side, he was favored with a highly unusual
 fraternal gesture from Moscow when Brezhnev called him "Comrade" in a
 speech on 27 October, a week after the opening of the Sino-Soviet talks.
 A watershed in Soviet relations with China was the 27 November. 1966 PRAVD
 editorial article which introduced the anathema formula "Mao Tse-tung and
 his group."  A CPSU Central Committee resolution in August that year had

 PARTY UNITS OF CENTRAL ASIAN MILITARY DISTRICT CONFER
 Soviet radio and press reports indicate that the restructured political
 organs in the recently created Central Asian Military District near the
 Sinkiang border are beginning to function.*  The Alma Ata radio reported
 on 16 February that the first Komsomol Conference of the Central Asian
 Military District opened on that date and heard speeches by the
 secretaries of the Kazakh, Kirgiz, and Tadzhik Komsomol central
 committees.  Reports of the inaugural meeting of the new district's
 party conference on 3 February had not mentioned a Tadzhik representative,
 noting only that reports were delivered by the secretaries of the Kirgiz
 and Kazakh central committees.
 Marking the 3 February party meeting, an article in the 3 February issue
 of the Alma Ata KAZJJGISTANSKAYA PRAVDA by Major General K. A. Maksimov,
 chief of the district political directrrate, emphasized the importance
 of iicreasing the district forces' combat readiness in order to defend
 the Soviet Union's borders.  Citing the strength of the world communist
 movement, Maksimov warned that "no attempts by the Peking provocateurs
 will be able to undermine the unity and monolithic nature of the world
 communist movement."
 TASS CORRESPONDENTS REPORT MOCK NUCLEAR MISSILE ATTACK
 A detailed description of a mock airborne nuclear missile strike against
 "the enemy"--unnamed--is contained in an article by two TASS correspondents
 carried in three major central Asian newspapers, Tashkent's PRAVDA VOSTOKA
 and Dushanbe's KOMMUNIST TADZHIKISTANA on 11 February and Frunze's
 SOVETSKAYA KIRGIZIYA on the 15th.  Describing the thoughts and activities
 of the pilots of "modern combat vehicles equipped with the latest systems
 and with all manner of instruments," the article tells of avoiding contact
 with "the enemy" during the flight of "many hours" covering "many thousands
 of kilometers," of breaking through the air defense barriers and repelling
 the attacks of fighters and air defense missiles, of launching the nuclear
 missiles against a predetermined target, and of returning safely to home
 base.  Nothing of this kind has appeared in Soviet central media.
 *  The 13 November 1969 issue of the TRENDS documents initial Soviet
 reports indicating that the old Turkestan Military District was divided
 into a new, reduced Turkestan Military District and a Central Asian
 Military District with apparent headquarters in Alma Ata.

 PEKING CHARGES U.S. WITH POLICY OF HOSTILITY TOWARD PRC
 The alleged downing of a U.S. drone over the llairrarr Island area on
 10 February has been followed by the most direct.; charges of' U.S.
 hostility toward the PRC to appear in the strewn of continent; from
 Peking since the 20 January session of the Warsaw talks.  Comment
 in the wake of the incident claims that the drone flight was "new
 evidence" that the Nixon Administration is "stubbornly pursuing the
 policy of hostility" toward the PRC.  A similar note was struck
 in a 12 February NCNA report; on the U.S, foreign aid bill signed
 into law two days earlier; in this case Peking took military aid
 for Taiwan as evidence of U.S. hostility.
 Peking's propaganda on the alleged shootdown follows the lines tak.:n
 after the previous reported incident, on 28 October last year:   are
 original announcement on 11. February accompanied by a party Military
 Commission commendation of the unit said to be responsible (a naval
 air defense unit); a joint Commentator article in PEOPLE'S DAILY
 and LIBERATION ARMY DAILY; and reports from the area of the incident
 playing up themes of "igilance and war preparedness.  In one
 notable change, however, Commentator does not repeat a reference in
 last October's article to the Nixon Administration's "'talks' tricks,"
 thereby reinforcing other signs in recent comment, that Peking is
 studiously keeping the record open for the forthcoming Warsaw
 session.  As in the case of the previous incident, Commentator
 derides the Administration's professed desire for peace but fails
 to mention specific issues,
 An article in the "Worker-Peasant-Soldier Battlefield" column of
 NCNA's domestic service on 11. February seems to raise some sensitive
 issues in the course of an attack on the President's announcement
 regarding U.S. policy on CBW.   Charg;.ng that U.S. pledges not to
 be the first to use these weapons are a smokescreen for carying out
 further research and development, the article quotes Stalin as
 observing that. "diplomats of the bourgeoisie" appeal for peace and
 friendly relations when they are preparing for war.   At another
 point, making the standard charge that the President is pursuing
 "counterrevolutionary dual tactics," the article states that "the
 revolutionary people of the world will neither believe the 'good
 words' of imperialism nor be frightened by its threat."  A service

 STRATEGIC  ARMS
 MOSCOW CRITICIZES PRESIDENT THROUGH PROXY OF U,S1 COLUMNIST

 corrnvenLatoro, opeakiug on their own authority, tire not critical of
 President Nixon's peraonrt:L role Ln the decl13ion to extend the system.
 But IZVhUWIYA on 13 February attacks the President through the proxy
 of an American corruncrstator, publlals.Ltsg lengthy excerpts from a
 3 February Wr ihingtors POS'T' article by co,Lunu,tist Joseph Kraft pegged
 to the decision on the second phrase of Safeguard announced at the
 Preuldent'n 30 January press conference.  Where i:3ovIcL commentators
 habitually trace the decision to pressures from the ",nilitctry-
 industrial complex," IZsiFSTIYA's version of the Kraft article
 relates the decision to "the fundLmenLal 1'ore,.gn policy views" of
 the l'reaident and his adviser Henry Kissinger, concluding that the
 decision was "dictated by" the President's       pro1'ounu eoavictions."
 IZVE5TIYA's version of the Kraft article pictures the President as
 an inveterate foe of' communism.  The excerpts include the comment
 that, more and more people "are now inclined to an assessment of Nixon
 and Kissinger which can hardly be described as good.  `this assessment
 starts from the historical fact that Mr. Nixon and Mr. Kissinger
 have long been regarded as being among the convinced anticommuniits
 who advocate a tough line."  Kraft is further quoted as remarking
 that the President "in particular loves to flail his opponents foi-
 displayint; excessive softness toward communists" and as adding that
 both the President and Kissinger are now trying to use the threat
 of a flu  zer  buildup "of nuclear potential, and in particular the
 development of the ABM system, in order to force the Russians to
 meet them halfway" on the strategic arms limitation 'talks (SALT).
 The article's conclusion, according to IZVESTIYA, is that serious-
 minded people are apprehensive lest the extension of Safeguard
 complicate SALT to such an extent "that it will not be possible to
 achieve even a limited agreement."
 Kraft's article in the POST had examined at some length the U.S.
 rationale since 1967 for the development of an ABM system directed
 against China and the President's acceptance of the need for such
 a China-oriented system, but IZVESTIYA's excerpts mention China
 only once.  The IZVESTIYA version says that President Nixon may in
 fact believe "a new and dangerous threat" has arisen from China, but
 that few U.S. officials share this view.  Soviet media have
 axknowledged in the past that the U.S. ABM system has been developed

 GENEVA  DISARMAMENT  TALKS
 USSR URGES TREATIES ON (B WEAPONS, USE OF SEABED
 18 F1111UJA1 Y 1)'(0
 Moscow mradia welcome the reconvening on 1'( February of the 26-nation
 Geneva disarmament conference--in recouu since 30 October--in a low
 volume of propagunJu calling routinely for the conclusion or treaties
 outlawing chemical and bacteriological weapons and prrfithiting the
 placing of masu.-destruction weapons on the seabed.  Chief Soviet
 delegate Hoohchin in his opening remarks called these issues the
 "most important problems" facing the conferees,   and an IZVESTIYA
 article r.,viewed by 'L'ASS on the l'(th also underscores their Importance.
 Both louhchin and IZVESTIYA conclude that apart from these key questions,
 the conference must press forward with its work on a draft treaty on
 general and complete disarmament, the "main task" assigned it by the
 UN General Assembly.
 The `PASS account of the opening session briefly reports that chief
 U.S. negotiator Smith "submitted a summary of the United States' views
 on a number of problems and tasks facing the committee," but it does
 not elaborate.  Smith had in fact suggested that the conferees discuss
 chemical and bacteriological weapons separately, a tack which in the
 past has drawn fire in Soviet propaganda.
 A NEW TIMES commentary by NOVOSTI correspondent Beglov conveys a note
 of optimism about the talks.  As summarized by TASS on 11 February,
 the article notes that the Soviet-American talks on strategic arms
 limitation began in a "businesslike atmosphere" and concludes that
 these talks in Helsinki and Vienna "should be taken as fresh
 encouragement for further efforts within the framework of the
 disarmament committee."

 STOPH LETTER      't'here is no inuriediate reaction available from East
 Gcrrna.ri or Lovict media to West Gerrnr,n DPA reports on
 18 February that Chancellor Brandt is ready to meet GDR Premier Stoph
 in Last Berlin in the second or Lhird week of March, t'ollowing
 preparatory meetings by lower-level officials between 23 and 27 February.
 Stoph's 12 February letter to Brandt, publicized by GDR and Soviet
 media on the day it was sort, was notable principally for the urgency
 it attached to a meeting at the top level within one to two weeks.*
 Stoph argued that the meeting should take place "as soon as possible"
 because of its "urgency and funlumcntal importance," and he suggested
 that. Brandt and he meet in "the GDR capital, Berlin," on 19 or
 26 February for "direct negotiations."  These talks would seek "to
 bring about. p(:ernefu:]. coexistence rind a Lrenty settlement on normal
 relations between the GDR and the FRG on the basis of the generally
 recognized norms of' international law"--a stock GDR demand for years.
 Stoph's letter otherwise was devoted to listing standard GDR planks
 for a GDR-FRG treaty, references to the new GDR draft treaty proposed
 by Ulbricht on 18 December 1969, and recriminations against Brandt
 and his government for failing to respond to Ulbricht's December
 proposals.  Although acknowledging that Brandt:'s 22 January 1970
 letter expressed readiness to negotiate with the GDR "on the basis
 of equality of rights and nondiscrimination," Stoph argued that this
 *  The present Stoph proposal displays considerably more urgency than
 a similar suggestion on 19 September 1967.  At that time Stoph
 suggested that two state secretaries make technical preparations for
 talks; earlier proposals in May and July 1967 had suggested, respective-
 ly, that this be done by foreign ministers or simply "representatives"
 of the two governments.

 Warsaw's PAP carried a Bonn-datelined dispatch on the 13th reporting
 optimistically that Brandt would "express his readiness to co" to
 Berlin for talks, or possibly would propose a preparatory meeting
 at a lower level prior to a Brandt-Stoph meeting.  The report noted
 that rejection of the Stoph invitation "would undermine to a
 considerable degree the credibility of West German assurances on
 their readiness to negotiate."  Prague's RUDE PRAVO expressed similar
 views on the 14th, according to CTK, declaring that the talks "must
 be between heads of governments" and that Brandt's rejection of talks
 at that level "would mean a transparent obstruction and would show
 that it in only defensive diplomatic maneuvering aimed at misleading
 the public, rather than interest in achieving progress in mutual
 relations."  CTK also reported PRACE of the 111th as calling Brandt's
 reply to Stoph "a public test of the sincerity of the new elements
 of Brandt's eastern policy."
 SOVIET-FRG     Moscow's first comment on the Soviet-West German talks
 TALKS          on a renunciation-of-force treaty since their inception
 in early December comes in an Andreyev commentary
 broadcast for German listeners on the 17th.  Andreyev assails West
 Germany's CSU leader Strauss and the "neo-nazis" aligned with him for
 opposing the talks and denies their allegations of a "sellout" and a
 "so-called betrayal" by FRG spokesman Egon Bahr In Moscow.  The
 commentatcr insists that a "possible agreement" on reciprocal
 recognition of borders "does not involve any sellout" and asserts that
