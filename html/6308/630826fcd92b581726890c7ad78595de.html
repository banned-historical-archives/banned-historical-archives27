COMMUNIST CHINA 
THE PROBLEM 
To analyze Chinese Communist domestic developments and external relations 
during the period of the First Five Year Plan (1953-1957) , and to estimate prob-
able trends during the next five years. 
CONCLUSIONS 
1. We believe that the Chinese Commu-
nist ability to exercise firm and effective 
control of mainland China will continue. 
The leadership of the party continues to 
demonstrate cohesion and determination 
and, at the same time, a considerable 
degree of flexibility. It is supported by a 
party membership of about 13 million 
and controls a large and efficient military 
and public security apparatus. We be-
lieve that the death or incapacitation of 
Mao Tse-tung would not endanger the 
regime's control of the country, although 
it might complicate the achieving of some 
objectives and reduce the party's policy 
flexibility. (Paras. 43-45, 66-68) 
2. The regime apparently has made con-
siderable progress in its efforts to recast 
the traditional structure of Chinese so-
ciety in the Communist mold. It has col-
lectivized almost all the peasants and has 
virtually eliminated private ownership in 
industry and commerce. Although the 
Chinese people have viewed with favor 
some of the regime's achievements, the 
regime's stringent curtailment of con-
sumption and the constant pressures to 
conform and to work harder have pro-
voked much dissatisfaction and disillu-
sionment, especially among the peasants. 
The party's experiments during the past 
two years to gain wider popular support 
by admitting problems and encouraging 
their discussion?the "letting 100 flowers 
bloom and diverse thoughts contend" 
program ? has been sharply cut back. 
(Paras. 27-42) 
3. In its efforts to elicit a more positive 
popular response, the regime, because of 
its determination to achieve rapid indus-
trialization, will have little to offer in the 
way of material inducements. Dissatis-
factions and occasional popular outbursts 
will continue, especially among the peas-
antry and certain minority groups, but 
we believe the net effect on the regime's 
programs will be no more than a com-
plicating or retarding one. Most Chi-
nese, conscious of the regime's power and 
seeing no alternative, will probably con-
tinue to acquiesce in Communist rule. 
(Paras. 68-70)

4. The Chinese Communists achieved a 
high rate of economic growth during 
their First Five Year Plan (1953-57) , 
demonstrating their capability to mar-
shal resources for investment despite the 
backward nature of the economy. A vital 
factor in their economic program was the 
assistance rendered by the USSR in ex-
panded trade, credits, and technical aid. 
Starting from a very small base, the aver-
age annual rate of growth of industrial 
output was about 16 percent, but indus-
trial output at the end of 1957 was still 
small compared to the industrial output 
of Japan or the UK. Agricultural out-
put was adequate to meet basic needs, 
but its expansion fell far short of that in 
other sectors of the economy. (Paras. 
17-26) 
5. During the next five years, the regime 
will have to cope with difficult economic 
problems stemming from the forced pace 
of industrial development. However, the 
basic problem will continue to be the race 
between population growth and food pro-
duction. The Chinese population is now 
probably about 640 million and increasing 
at about 2.0-2.5 percent per year; agri-
cultural output during the next five years 
will, at best, probably not exceed the 3 
percent per annum increase achieved 
during the First Five Year Plan. In the 
event of a series of bad crop years and of 
widespread lack of cooperation among the 
peasants, the regime would face grave 
difficulties. However, even in these cir-
cumstances, the regime, because of its 
control apparatus, probably could main-
tain itself in power and, at the same time, 
maintain industrial growth, although at 
a reduced rate. (Paras. 54-57) 
6. We believe that Communist China dur-
ing the next five years will probably be 
2 
able to maintain a rate of economic 
growth roughly comparable to that of the 
past five years. By 1962 its Gross Nation-
al Product will probably be on the order of 
US $65-67 billion, as compared with US 
$46 billion in 1957. The contribution of 
the industrial sector will probably have 
increased to about 26 percent, as com-
pared to about 19 percent in 1957. (Paras. 
52, 53, and 59) 
7. Communist China's military power in 
the Far East will bulk even larger by 1962 
than it does at present. The army will 
probably be somewhat smaller, but it will 
be better equipped and more mobile. The 
air force and navy will have increased in 
size and effectiveness. The Chinese Com-
munist armament industry, with Soviet 
technological assistance, will probably be 
able to meet most, if not all, army re-
quirements for small arms, artillery, 
transport, and ammunition. Shipbuild-
ing and aircraft production will' probably 
have increased considerably. Neverthe-
less, Communist China will still be de-
pendent on the USSR for heavy and com-
plex military equipment and for many 
components. (Paras. 71-73) 
8. Although Communist China will al-
most certainly not have developed a mis-
sile or nuclear weapons production capa-
bility of its own by 1962, we believe that 
the Chinese Communists will press the 
USSR for such advanced weapons. By 
that time the USSR will probably have 
provided it with some varieties of missiles 
and other weapons adaptable to nuclear 
use, but with non-nuclear warheads. Un-
less barred by an effective international 
agreement, the USSR may introduce nu-
clear weapons into Communist China by 
1962, although they will almost certainly 
remain under Soviet control. In any

SECRET 
event, even though nuclear warheads 
were not deployed in Communist China, 
they would be readily available if Sino-
Soviet interests required them. (Para. 
74) 
9. Communist China will almost certain-
ly remain firmly aligned with the USSR. 
Peiping will continue to acknowledge 
Moscow as the leader of world Commu-
nism, but as Communist China grows in 
strength and stature, it will probably play 
an increasingly important role in the 
formulation of general Bloc policy. Al-
though there will almost certainly be 
some frictions, these are unlikely to im-
pair Sino-Soviet cooperation during the 
period of this estimate. (Paras. 75-83) 
10. In its efforts to reduce and eliminate 
Western influence in Asia, Communist 
China will probably proceed primarily by 
non-military means. Its foreign policy 
will probably display more initiative and 
assertiveness, while continuing to em-
phasize coexistence and a readiness to in-
crease economic and political relations 
with other states. Without compromis-
ing its stand on basic issues, Communist 
China will continue to portray itself as 
willing to reach a rapprochement with 
the US. At the same time, the Chinese 
Communists will almost certainly con-
tinue their subversive efforts throughout 
the Far East. They will almost certainly 
continue their efforts to undermine the 
will of the Nationalists on Taiwan, and to 
discredit them internationally. They will 
probably not resort to overt military ag-
gression as long as they believe it would 
involve them in military action with the 
US. Although their attitude towards the 
Offshore Islands may become more ag-
gressive, a decision to initiate military 
3 
action to seize these Islands would prob-
ably be contingent on an estimate that 
the US would not intervene militarily. 
(Paras. 88-90) 
11. Japan will continue to be one of Pei-
ping's most important targets, especially 
because there is a growing area of com-
petition between Communist China and 
Japan. Peiping will continue to seek to 
reduce conservative strength and US in-
fluence in Japan by exploiting Japanese 
fears of becoming involved in a nuclear 
war, any areas of friction with the US, 
and Japan's eagerness to expand trade 
with mainland China. In pursuit of 
these objectives, Communist China will 
continue to employ both conciliatory and 
tough tactics. Trade between Commu-
nist China and Japan will probably in-
crease, and Peiping will probably be able 
to gain at least quasi-diplomatic status 
for a trade mission in Japan. (Paras. 
93, 63) 
12. Assuming a general continuance of 
present Bloc and Western policies, we be-
lieve that intercourse between Commu-
nist China and the Free World will in-
crease considerably during the next five 
years. This trend will probably involve 
added diplomatic recognition of Peiping 
by a number of states, but will occur 
whether or not formal diplomatic ties are 
established. It will also involve greater 
difficulty in excluding Communist China 
from the UN. (Paras. 95-96) 
13. If Communist China continues its 
present international policy, we believe 
that its prestige in Asia will continue to 
grow during the next five years. This 
will occur whether or not additional coun-
tries recognize Communist China, or it is

admitted to the UN. But it does not 
necessarily follow that as a result of in-
creased prestige the Chinese Communists 
will be able to induce non-Communist 
Asian countries to adopt internal or ex-
ternal policies desired by Communist 
China. Communist China's future role 
in Asia will be determined to an impor-
tant extent by developments in five fields, 
in varying degrees beyond the control of 
the Chinese Communists: 
a. The course of events in the US-
USSR relationship and in the broad as-
pects of the cold war. 
b. Developments within the Bloc such 
as spectacular scientific achievements or 
major political upheavals. 
c. The extent to which local Commu-
nist parties, e.g., those in Indonesia, Laos, 
and India, gain or lose political strength. 
d. The extent to which the growth of

DISCUSSION 
I. INTRODUCTION 
14. The Chinese Communist regime during 
the period of its First Five Year Plan (1953-
1957) made considerable progress toward its 
long-run goal of transforming Communist 
China from a backward agricultural country 
into an industrialized nation. With assist-
ance from the USSR, the Chinese Communists 
have achieved a high rate of increase in their 
Gross National Product, and especially in the 
output of heavy industry. The imposition of 
Communist institutions on society has pro-
ceeded at a rapid rate as a result of the vir-
tual elimination of private enterprise in in-
dustry, commerce, and agriculture. These 
domestic achievements and the growing mili-
tary power of Communist China contributed 
to its increased impact abroad, both in the 
Free World and in the Communist Bloc. 
15. At the same time, the forced pace of 
change has created internal stresses and 
strains which are substantial and widespread. 
These stresses and strains have been produced 
by the rigidities and repressions which are 
essential features of Communist methods and 
programs and which hinder the development 
of general popular support for the regime. 
They were inevitable in view of the regime's 
efforts quickly to mold the Chinese into a 
disciplined Communist society. Tensions have 
also developed out of the intervention, at all 
levels of society and in all activities, of party 
workers who have the power to command, but 
who in most cases have inadequate training 
and experience in their duties of supervising 
the specific educational, social, or economic 
organization. Moreover, the regime's efforts 
to restrict consumption in order to increase 
investment have been felt particularly by the 
peasants, whose incentive to produce has been 
reduced. Nevertheless, as far as we can see, 
these tensions are not critical in the sense of 
threatening the position of the Communist 
leaders or of being likely to hamper produc-
tion to the extent of seriously limiting the 
further growth of the Chinese Communist 
economy. 
16. The Chinese Communists, after going 
through a period of pessimism engendered by 
the economic problems which came to a head 
in 1956, now appear confident that they can 
maintain a rapid rate of economic expansion

during the next five years. This confidence 
is tempered by the extent of popular criticism 
of the regime as revealed by the recent but 
short-lived experiment in relaxing controls on 
public discussion, by the evidence that there 
was a growing separation between the party 
and the people, and by the widespread peas-
ant dissatisfaction when collectivization failed 
to bring increased income. The regime's con-
fidence is also tempered by a more realistic 
appreciation of the magnitude of its basic 
problems, particularly that of agriculture. 
II. DEVELOPMENTS DURING THE PERIOD OF 
THE FIRST FIVE YEAR PLAN 
A. The Economy" 
17. The Chinese Communists, during the 
period of their First Five Year Plan, achieved 
a high rate of economic growth which com-
pares favorably with that of the Soviet Union 
in its First Five Year Plan (1928-1932). (See 
Figure 1.) This progress was achieved despite 
relatively crude and rudimentary planning, 
resulting from such factors as the limited 
technical personnel, the lack of reliable and 
comprehensive statistics, the backward state 
of the economy, and the rapid imposition of 
social change. Although the regime has made 
a pretense of proceeding according to an over-
all five year plan, it has actually operated 
from year to year on annual plans which have 
generally been aimed at correcting the ex-
cesses and defects of the previous year. Nev-
ertheless, the regime demonstrated its capa-
bility to control the economy sufficiently to 
limit consumption and to marshal resources 
See Appendix A for a more detailed discussion 
of the First Five Year Plan. 
2 Chinese Communist statistics upon which the 
data and analyses throughout this estimate are 
based are subject to the same reservations as 
those of other Bloc countries, but to a somewhat 
greater extent, in view of the inexperience on 
the part of the newly established Chinese Com-
munist statistical collection system. This inex-
perience probably accounts for the majority of 
such statistical defects as have been noted. Chi-
nese Communist statistics are the basis for the 
regime's planning and we believe are not, in 
general, misrepresented.

tem and major industrial and mining centers.

for investment, despite the backward nature 
of the economy and the necessity of obtaining 
the funds for investment largely from the 
agricultural sector, the output of which fluc-
tuated widely from year to year. 
18. Starting from a small base, the average 
annual rate of growth of industrial output 
during the period was high, probably about 16 
percent. This growth was uneven, exceeding 
30 percent in 1953 and 1956, but dropping 
sharply in 1955 and 1957. During the five 
year period, production of such basic items as 
steel more than tripled; while the output of 
coal, electric power, and cement more than 
doubled. Despite this considerable progress, 
the Chinese Communist industrial output at 
the end of 1957 was still small compared to 
that of Japan or the UK. (See Figure 2.) 
19. The increased industrial output was to an 
important degree obtained from the recon-
struction, expansion, and more intensive utili-
zation of existing plant, although a consid-
erable investment was made in new plant, 
much of which will come into production in 
1958-1962. The regime has directed about 56 
percent of total investment into the industrial 
sector and has favored heavy over light in-
dustry by about eight to one. Industry be-
came more diversified with the addition of 
new plant, and by the end of the period pro-
duction facilities for trucks, sea-going ships, 
aircraft, and more complicated machine tools 
were put into operation, although the Chi-
nese Communists are still dependent on for-
eign sources for many components. 
20. The growth of industrial output was re-
tarded by uneven development among various 
parts of the industrial sector, which resulted 
in serious imbalances. The most important 
of these was the failure of the output of raw 
materials to keep in phase with the expansion 
of manufacturing capacity, especially in the 
machine and equipment building industries. 
In some cases, however, the deficiencies of raw 
materials arose from the difficulties in devel-
oping natural resources; for example, the re-
gime has been unable to develop sufficient 
sources of crude oil and copper, accessible to 
existing rail lines, to meet requirements. The 
output of light industry, dependent largely on

agricultural raw materials, has not been suffi-
cient fully to utilize present plant capacity. 
21. Technical assistance from the Bloc has 
been of paramount importance to Communist 
China's industrialization. The major indus-
trial projects, accounting for about 40 percent 
of total industrial investment, were designed, 
supervised, and placed in initial operation by 
Soviet technicians. In addition, Bloc, largely 
Soviet, advisors and technicians have worked 
with virtually every ministry in the govern-
ment and with many individual enterprises. 
Technicians have provided on-the-job train-
ing for Chinese workers and some 7,000 Chi-
nese have been sent to the USSR for training. 
Soviet bloc technical data have been used on a 
large scale. 
22. The growth of agricultural output was 
adequate to meet basic needs, but its expan-
sion fell far short of that in other sectors of 
the economy. Serious natural calamities in 
1954 and 1956 and bumper crops in 1955 
caused wide fluctuations in output during the 
five year period. Moreover, production was 
adversely affected by the disruption and con-
fusion which accompanied the rapid collec-
tivization of agriculture in 1955 and 1956. 
Agricultural growth was also hampered as a 
direct result of the regime's decision to mini-
mize state investment in this sector and to 
depend on its ability to squeeze the bulk of 
agricultural investment funds directly from 
the earnings of the collectives. The large 
flood control and irrigation projects, under-
taken by the state, were not sufficiently ad-
vanced to increase materially the acreage un-
der irrigation, even though the amount spent 
exceeded the plan by 50 percent. Further-
more, State investment in the chemical in-
dustry was inadequate to increase substan-
tially the availability of chemical fertilizer. 
The increases in grain and cotton production 
that were achieved were largely the result of 
direct investment by the collectives in small 
irrigation projects which permitted an expan-
sion of double-cropping. 
23. Economic progress during the First Five 
Year Plan, to an important extent, was de-
pendent on the importation of vital ma-
chinery, equipment, and industrial raw mate-
rials. Bloc countries were Communist China's 
6 
major trading partners, accounting for nearly 
78 percent of total trade. There was some in-
crease in trade with non-Communist coun-
tries, but this increase was limited to some ex-
tent by Western trade controls. The Chinese 
Communists were able to maintain an import 
surplus over the period 1953-1957 as a whole. 
This was made possible by Soviet credits, 
largely of a military nature, which accounted 
for about 13 percent of total imports, and, to 
a lesser extent, by remittances from Overseas 
Chinese. However, during the period, balance 
of payments pressures increased. Despite a 
doubling of exports, imports rose by only one-
third, and the trade balance shifted from an 
import to an export surplus. This shift re-
sulted from the exhaustion of foreign credits, 
mounting foreign debt service, reduced Over-
seas Chinese remittances, reduced Soviet ex-
penditures in China after the force with-
drawal of 1955, and the Chinese Communist 
foreign aid program. (See Figure 3.) 
24. Despite this slim margin on which they 
have been operating, the Chinese Communists 
made a series of offers or grants of economic 
aid. The largest portion of Chinese Commu-
nist foreign aid has gone to other Communist 
countries: grants in goods and services of 
$325 million each to North Korea and North 
Vietnam, $40 million to Outer Mongolia, and 
$7.5 million to Hungary; and a loan of $25 
million to Hungary. In addition, to non-
Communist countries, Communist China 
has extended grants totalling $55 million, and 
has extended in late 1957 and early 1958 loans 
totalling an additional $32 million.4 Of the 
total of about $810 million in grants and 
loans, Bloc and non-Bloc, about $630 million 
had actually been expended by the end of 
1957.5 
Grants (in millions of US$): Cambodia, 22.4; 
Nepal, 12.6; Egypt, 4.7; Ceylon, 15.75. Loans ex-
tended (in millions of US$): Indonesia, 11.2; 
Burma, 4.2; Yemen, 16.3. 
5 The loans and grants to Bloc countries were in 
yuan currency to North Korea and North Viet-
nam and in rubles to Hungary. Yuan data have 
been converted into US dollar equivalents at the 
rate of 2.46 yuan per US $1 and rubles at 4 per 
US $1. The use of the yuan-dollar exchange 
rate may overstate considerably the value of aid 
to North Korea and North Vietnam.

25. The total increase in GNP during the past 
five years has probably been great enough to 
register an average annual growth in per 
capita output of five to six percent, even 
though the population expanded at an aver-
age annual rate of about two percent. About 
45 percent of the increase in output appar-
ently was channeled into investment or gov-
ernment purchases of goods and services. 
While the remainder was absorbed by an in-
crease in personal consumption, probably 
more than three-fifths of this increase went 
to the non-agricultural population, which 
comprised less than one-fifth of the popula-
tion. As a result, per capita consumption of 
the peasant population was probably improved 
little, if any. 
26. The fact that population growth has 
nearly kept pace with the increase in agricul-
tural output has become a matter of deep 
concern to the regime. During the past five 
years, the number of mouths to feed has prob-
ably increased by some 65 million and now 
totals about 640 million. As a result of im-
proved sanitation, hygiene and public health 
measures, better distribution of food, and the 
maintenance of peace within the country, the 
rate of increase of the population has prob-
ably risen somewhat over the period of the last 
five years, averaging about 2.2 percent. With 
an average annual increase in agricultural 
output during the past five years of about 
three percent, the margin of safety is very 
thin. In an effort to deal with this problem 
the regime is developing programs which it 
hopes will, in time, reduce the birth rate. 
B. Reorganization of the Chinese 
Society 
27. The regime apparently made considerable 
progress in its efforts to recast the traditional 
structure of Chinese society in the Commu-
nist mold. These efforts sprang from both 
Communist doctrine and from the pragmatic 
need to establish a high degree of organiza-
tion and control in order that a rela-
tively small group ? the Chinese Communist 
Party ? could dominate the vast Chinese 
population. 
7 
28. Before 1953, the power of the landlords 
and well-to-do peasants which had been domi-
nant in rural areas was virtually eliminated. 
Subordination of youth to their elders was 
weakened by placing the former in positions 
of responsibility. Women were given equal 
status in society. Through centralized con-
trol of all media of communications and a 
cadre network, the Communists weakened the 
clan and regional loyalties which still existed 
among many Chinese. The regime sought to 
convince all Chinese that the welfare of the 
individual and of the family must be subordi-
nated to the general good of the nation as a 
whole. 
29. Since 1953, the regime has intensified its 
efforts to reorganize traditional Chinese so-
ciety. By persuasion, pressure, and, in some 
instances, terror, the Communists increased 
their efforts to impose the Communist way of 
life on the intellectuals and the middle class. 
The most radical changes in the old ways of 
life during the past five years, however, re-
sulted from the regime's programs to socialize 
all forms of economic activity. The success 
of these programs was surprising because of 
the rapidity with which the millions of peas-
ants were shuffled into collective groupings 
and business enterprises were brought under 
government control. Moreover, there were 
relatively few outward manifestations of re-
sistance, at least initially. 
30. By the end of 1956, socialization had vir-
tually eliminated all private control of indus-
trial and commercial enterprises. The regime 
continued to utilize many former owners as 
managers and technicians, paying them liqui-
dation dividends which may be continued for 
a few more years. It has also introduced 
measures designed to increase party control 
of management and labor. 
31. By the end of 1957, the Chinese Commu-
nists claimed that 93 percent of peasant 
households were in collective farms, and that 
an additional four percent were in coopera-
tives. The remaining small fraction, except 
in Tibet and certain other. exempted areas, 
had been placed under the guidance of the 
nearest collective.

32. Although the organizational phase of col-
lectivization was quickly accomplished, the 
Communists have not realized the major bene-
fits which they had anticipated. Despite an 
increase in the output of major food crops, 
the government's 1956 collection declined, in 
part because many peasants discovered that 
even in collectives they could circumvent gov-
ernment controls, especially when the local 
cadres sided with the peasants. Agricultural 
output was also adversely affected by the dis-
locations which accompanied the actual or-
ganization of the collectives, and by the dif-
ficulties which were encountered in establish-
ing effective management of the larger agri-
cultural units. 
33. The Communists also had to cope with 
peasant disillusionment which became in-
creasingly apparent in 1957. Many peasants 
were unhappy because their incomes had not 
increased as promised, or because they had not 
been adequately remunerated for their con-
tribution of land and implements. In addi-
tion to evading government efforts to procure 
grain, substantial numbers of peasants with-
drew from collective farms, although most of 
them were forced to return. The higher 
urban incomes continued to attract large 
numbers of peasants into cities where unem-
ployment was already a critical problem. 
Strong measures have been taken to force 
these dissatisfied peasants to return home, 
but the problem still exists. 
C. Problems in Eliciting Popular 
Support 
34. The regime's progress in changing the 
form of Chinese society apparently was not 
matched in the realm of popular attitudes. 
The Chinese population as a whole appears to 
have ambivalent feelings toward the regime. 
The regime has had considerable success in 
its efforts to foster a sense of common identity 
in the population at large, in part because of 
the groundwork of nationalist sentiment 
which had been stimulated by Sun Yat-sen 
and the Kuomintang, and in part because of 
its own achievements. There has probably 
been a favorable response to specific programs 
such as public health and education which 
improve the lot of the individual, or road 
building, irrigation, and flood control which 
are visible community improvements. There 
has probably also been a favorable, but less 
general, response to developments which boost 
national pride such as the production of 
planes and trucks, bridging the Yangtze, and 
the increased world prestige of Communist 
China. 
35. But in most Chinese these effects have in 
varying degrees almost certainly been offset 
by negative reactions to other aspects of the 
regime. The intellectuals have been resentful 
of the pressures to conform and the restric-
tions on discussion. The urban workers have 
disliked the constant orders to produce more 
goods faster, the compulsory attendance at 
innumerable indoctrination meetings in their 
free time, and the shortages of consumer 
goods. The peasants have been dissatisfied 
with the failure of their personal incomes to 
rise in proportion to their increased output, 
and with the regimentation of the collective 
system. In general, the regime- has made lit-
tle progress in gaining popular acceptance of 
the Communist dogma or in substituting, as 
an incentive, the prospect of a future mil-
lenium in place of more food and clothing 
for the present generation. Moreover, the in-
tensification and centralization of control 
have probably caused previously diffused dis-
content to be directed against the regime. 
But regardless of dissatisfaction or resent-
ment, the Chinese are aware of the power of 
the regime and see no alternative; their re-
sponse to the regime is, for the most part, 
one of acquiescence. 
36. To elicit greater popular support for the 
regime and to improve the effectiveness of the 
party organization, the regime undertook a 
venturesome experiment in the spring of 1957. 
It admitted the existence of problems, re-
laxed restrictions on public discussion, and in-
vited criticism of the operations of the party 
and its programs. Although some elements 
within the party were apparently opposed to 
relaxing controls, Mao and other leaders 
seemed to see many advantages. Public criti-
cism, in their view, might provide a safety 
valve, give the people a greater sense of par-
ticipation in party affairs, and create the im-

pression that the regime was modifying its 
authoritarian procedures. They apparently 
feared that the party had become separated 
from the people, a weakness they believed had 
been a principal cause of the outbursts in 
Hungary and Poland. Moreover, public criti-
cism, they thought, would reveal to the lead-
ers the weaknesses in the operations of the 
party and provide the basis for corrective 
measures. They must also have estimated 
that rule by the Chinese Communist regime 
had been generally accepted and that criti-
cisms would be directed at the implementa-
tion of policy rather than at the basic char-
acter of the regime itself. 
37. This program grew out of a largely un-
successful effort in early 1956 to create a more 
positive response to its programs by a relaxa-
tion of domestic tensions and by promising an 
improvement in the harsh conditions of life. 
However, the promises and incentives directed 
initially to the intellectuals, and later ex-
tended to the peasants and workers, failed to 
evoke a significant response, and in the spring 
of 1957 Mao broadened the scope of the lib-
eralization policy. As part of the 1956 meas-
ures, intellectuals had been encouraged to de-
bate differences on non-political subjects; Mao 
now encouraged the population in general to 
participate in the greater freedom to discuss 
and extended the subjects of discussion to the 
operation of the party and its programs. At 
the same time he formalized his policy in a 
doctrinal statement which recognized that 
even in a Communist state there were contra-
dictions in outlook between the leaders and 
the people, and within and between various 
groups. But these contradictions, he insisted, 
were largely non-antagonistic because of the 
disappearance of exploitation of one class by 
another, and, therefore, could be resolved by 
discussion and persuasion, rather than by 
force. 
38. The extent and intensity of the criticism 
appears to have surprised the regime. It 
found that neither the Communist system, 
the party's monopoly of leadership, nor the 
Soviet orientation had been as fully accepted 
in China as it had apparently believed, espe-
cially among the very intellectuals it had 
courted. The regime's critics were numerous 
and came from many select groups, including 
even the party. Their criticisms almost cer-
tainly reflected the views of a body of opinion 
much larger than the regime has admitted. 
39. In June 1957 the regime reacted by ab-
ruptly cutting off criticism, and Mao's con-
tradictions formula was rewritten to point 
out clearly the categories of Communist 
truth which were above criticism. The re-
gime subsequently conducted an intensive 
campaign against its critics and has dismissed 
accused "rightists" from their positions. It 
has apparently not felt it necessary to imple-
ment its sometimes explicit threat of punish-
ing its critics on harsh "counter-revolu-
tionary" grounds, however, and the erring 
ones have been told that they will be given a 
chance to redeem themselves. To counteract 
the criticism, the regime also launched a 
massive campaign designed to convince the 
people of the superiority of the Communist 
system. 
40. Nevertheless, the regime did not disre-
gard all criticism, and has taken steps to im-
prove the operation of the party and its rela-
tions with the people generally. The regime 
has urged a continuation of public discussion, 
although, as might be expected, the response 
has been guarded and concerned largely with 
details of administration and production. 
The party also continued the "rectification" 
program which had been launched as part of 
Mao's original program and which seeks by 
persuasion and education to create conform-
ity, tighten discipline, correct errors, and re-
invigorate the party. 
41. One major source of difficulty within the 
party was that it had apparently grown too 
fast for proper indoctrination of members. 
Total party membership is at present about 
13 million. About two-thirds of its members 
had been recruited since 1949 and about two 
million since June 1956. As a result there 
were many who were free-riders, dead-wood, 
or "not steeled through labor." Traditional 
localist sentiments also still existed in the 
party, as exemplified by the many rural 
cadres who supported the grievances of the 
peasants rather than enforced edicts of the 
regime or who resented party personnel of

SECRET 
non-local origin. Moreover, the exercise of 
authority and the enjoyment of special privi-
leges led to a deterioration of the party's rela-
tions with the people. 
42. Although the main emphasis of rectifica-
tion has been upon reeducating members, a 
number of party officials and deputies to the 
National People's Congress have been dis-
missed from the party for "rightist" activi-
ties, and further dismissals of cadres for in-
competency or unreliability are probable. 
There has also been a wholesale transfer of 
party and government cadres to lower levels, 
particularly to rural areas where large num-
bers were assigned to agricultural collectives. 
This program seems to have had a number of 
objectives: strengthening of the party net-
work in the crucial agricultural field; re-
trenchment of non-productive personnel in 
party, government, and industrial organs; re-
duction of bureaucratic tendencies in these 
organs; inculcating members with an appre-
ciation of manual labor; and punishment of 
errant members. It probably was also in-
tended to meet criticisms of the material priv-
ileges enjoyed by party members. There are 
indications that many of those transferred re-
sented the shifts. 
D. The Regime's Ability to Control 
Mainland China 
43. We believe that the regime has the ability 
to exercise firm control of mainland China. 
Despite the fact that problems and weak-
nesses within the party have been revealed 
by the rectification program, the party re-
tains its basic elements of strength: a ruth-
less and resourceful leadership, a large mem-
bership organized to act as an instrument of 
control and policy implementation, and an in-
tention and ability to enforce a high degree of 
discipline and conformity. The party organi-
zation continues to be backed up by large and 
well-disciplined police, militia, and security 
organizations, supplemented by a network of 
informers and local "resident's committees" 
which provide surveillance over individual 
family groups. Party control is reinforced by 
mass organizations which mobilize various so-
cial and occupational groups in the popula-
10 
tion behind Communist programs and which 
serve as channels for propaganda and indoc-
trination. The authority of the party is fur-
ther enhanced by its control of all media of 
communication and of the distribution of the 
bulk of food supplies in urban areas, and by 
its success in corralling most peasants into 
collectives. 
44. Behind this control mechanism stand the 
large Chinese Communist military forces 
which are effectively under the control of the 
party. During the revolution the party and 
the army were, to a large extent, an integral 
unit. Military personnel and veterans con-
tinue to make up a large part of the party. 
The regime claims that about 75 percent of 
the rank and file of the armed forces are 
members of the Chinese Communist Party or 
of the Young Communist League, and all re-
ceive intense political indoctrination. Be-
cause of the close identity of the party and 
army in the past, many senior party members 
have a military background; thus the 1956 
enlargement of the Politburo and the Central 
Committee brought a significant number of 
such persons into the top levels of party lead-
ership. However, there is no indication that 
they form a military bloc within the party 
leadership, or that a military group with po-
litical ambitions has emerged within the 
armed forces. The party appears to be fully 
aware of the importance of maintaining con-
trol over the military and the military appears 
to accept the dominant role of the party. At 
the time Marshal Zhukov was ousted from his 
positions in the Soviet Union, Chinese Com-
munist military spokesmen publicly stated 
their support of a strong party role in the 
armed forces. 
45. The regime has been able to deal effec-
tively with sporadic outbursts of resistance 
which have for the most part been localized 
and poorly organized. Probably in part to 
demonstrate its power, the regime has carried 
out two nationwide drives against "counter-
revolutionaries." The security forces have 
also dealt with several student riots and dem-
onstrations against the regime, and with 
some civil disturbances growing out of peas-
ant resentment against collectives. There 
have been indications of continuing discon-

tent in minority areas, recently including de-
mands for genuine autonomy, but large-scale 
armed uprisings have been reported only in 
Tibet. Strong anti-Chinese sentiment in 
Tibet culminated in an outburst in 1956 and 
induced the regime to announce that the in-
troduction of social "reforms" into Tibet 
would be postponed for six years. Despite 
this concession, sporadic incidents continue 
in Tibet. 
E. Strengthening Its Military Establish-
ment 6'7 
46. The capabilities of the armed forces to 
fulfill their internal and external functions 
have increased significantly during the past 
several years. The Korean War gave great 
impetus to the development and moderniza-
tion of Communist China's armed forces and 
stimulated large-scale Soviet aid. Since the 
war, the trend has continued toward further 
modernization and a more balanced military 
establishment. 
47. Since 1954, ground force personnel and 
infantry division strength have remained at 
an estimated 2'/2 million men and 114 divi-
sions respectively. However, overall capabili-
ties have been increased by continued mod-
ernization. Anti-aircraft and anti-tank bat-
talions are now included in most' of the in-
fantry divisions, and a tank-assault gun regi-
ment has been added to at least 28 of the in-
fantry divisions. In 1955 the regime inaugu-
rated a new military conscription and reserve 
program which is now providing an army 
composed in the main of selected conscripts. 
The army's effectiveness in modern warfare, 
as a result of current training programs, has 
been considerably increased. In addition, the 
reserves will include, on a continuing basis, 
about two million men who will have under-
gone active military service within the pre-
vious three years. 
48. Since 1954, Communist China's combined 
air arm has increased from 65,200 to 87,000 
o See Annex B for more complete discussion. 
See maps for the disposition of ground forces 
and combat jet aircraft, and for the location of 
naval bases. 
11 
officers and men while total aircraft in opera-
tional units have increased from 1,580 to 
2,880. A more significant indicator of prog-
ress toward modernization is the increase 
from 850 to 2,280 jet aircraft, of which 1,835 
are fighters and 445 are light bombers. Com-
munist China has also developed an extensive 
radar detection system which covers the en-
tire coast and major inland industrial centers. 
This system has fair to good detection capa-
bility except for aircraft at low altitudes. Its 
high altitude GCI capability has not been ex-
panded to include all areas. 
49. The navy has gradually increased its over-
all strength to 55,000 and its general service 
personnel strength to 48,000 officers and men. 
This growth was accompanied by a substan-
tial increase in offensive and defensive capa-
bilities. Its major surface units include four 
destroyers, 16 submarines, four escort vessels, 
54 amphibious ships and 31 mine warfare ves-
sels, as well as a Naval Air Arm including 435 
combat aircraft. 
50. Although still dependent to a large degree 
upon the Soviet Union for heavy and complex 
equipment, aircraft, and many component 
and spare parts, Communist China has made 
progress in its effort to achieve military self-
sufficiency. It now produces small arms, mor-
tars through 160-mm, and artillery through 
122-mm howitzers. In addition, Communist 
China now has a number of airframe and air-
craft parts plants, including an aircraft as-
sembly plant at Mukden capable of series 
assembly of jet fighter aircraft. Mukden's 
monthly assembly capacity will probably 
reach 100 jet fighters by 1963. Communist 
China has a rapidly growing shipbuilding in-
dustry now assembling submarines and pro-
ducing hulls for escort vessels, submarine 
chasers, mine warfare vessels, and motor tor-
pedo boats. However, practically all arma-
ment for these vessels and a substantial part 
of components, equipment, and machinery is 
obtained from the Bloc. The Chinese Com-
munists continue to be handicapped by a 
shortage of technological skills in both the 
armed forces and the armaments industry. 
We believe that the country has no guided 
missiles or nuclear weapons and, at present, 
lacks the capability to produce them.

51. The high cost of maintaining such a 
large military establishment and of develop-
ing a munitions industry has been a heavy 
drain on Communist China's economy. The 
Chinese Communists have reduced the pro-
portion of expenditures budgeted as military 
from 26 percent in 1953 to 18 percent in 1957. 
However, this has not involved a significant 
decline in the absolute amount spent, and 
there has probably been an increase in invest-
ment in plants for producing military equip-
ment. 
III. PROBABLE TRENDS WITHIN COMMUNIST 
CHINA DURING THE NEXT FIVE YEARS 
52. We believe that during the next five years 
the Chinese Communists will continue to be 
able to exercise effective control of mainland 
China and will gain some success in further 
imposing Communist social institutions and 
patterns on the Chinese people. The regime 
will probably be able to maintain a rate of 
economic growth roughly comparable to that 
of the last five years, but this will necessitate 
continued stringent control of consumption, 
particularly in view of the increasing popula-
tion. Its efforts to gain increased popular 
support will be severely limited by its determi-
nation to maintain the pace of economic de-
velopment and social change. There will con-
tinue to be a widespread but fluctuating feel-
ing of dissatisfaction and discontent among 
the Chinese people which, while hampering 
somewhat the regime's programs, will prob-
ably not be translated into effective resistance. 
A. The Economy 
53. Although the Second Five Year Plan is 
still in process of formulation, the general 
outlines of this plan as announced in Septem-
ber 1956 appear to be the basis of the re-
gime's planning. These indications are suffi-
ciently clear to enable us to estimate that 
total output will probably increase by 7-8 per-
cent annually during the period of the Second 
Five Year Plan, or about as rapidly as in the 
First Five Year Plan. The increments to pro-
duction will probably cost more in terms of 
investment required, since gains from more 
intensive utilization of existing plants will be 
far less. However, investment during the 
Second Five Year Plan will probably continue 
to increase relative to total output. The em-
phasis will continue to be on industrial devel-
opment, and by 1962 the industrial sector 
will probably contribute nearly 26 percent of 
total gross product as against 18 percent in 
1957 and 13 percent in 1952. 
54. Agricultural Production. In their ap-
proach to the Second Five Year Plan, the Chi-
nese Communists have been forced to give 
greater priority to the expansion of agricul-
tural production in order to provide for the 
minimum consumption needs of its growing 
population, agricultural raw materials, espe-
cially cotton, for its expanding industry, and 
exports with which to repay loans and to 
finance the import of vital capital equipment. 
This greater priority for agriculture will in-
volve some reorientation of industrial devel-
opment, with a greater share of investment 
allotted to those heavy industries which pro-
vide fertilizers, agricultural chemicals, irriga-
tion equipment, and implements for agricul-
ture. For example, investment in the chem-
ical fertilizer industry will probably rise from 
one percent of total state investment in the 
First Five Year Plan to about three percent 
in the second plan period. 
55. The Chinese Communists have announced 
that, in 1958, 14 percent of the state's capital 
investment will be in agriculture, suggesting 
that such investment for the entire Second 
Five Year Plan may be as much as four times 
the amount allocated for this purpose during 
the First Five Year Plan when it amounted to 
only 7.8 percent of a smaller total investment. 
The state's investment in agriculture is used 
primarily on large-scale water conservation 
projects. However, direct investment by the 
collectives in irrigation and drainage facili-
ties, fertilizers, farm tools and machinery, 
livestock, and other production requisites will 
continue to provide the major source of funds 
for agricultural development. Such invest-
ment, and the related technological improve-
ments, are considered by the regime to be the 
most effective way of immediately increasing 
agricultural production.

SECRET 13 
56. In September 1956 the regime set 1962 
agricultural goals at 250 million tons of grain 
and 2.4 million tons of cotton, but in 1957, 
recognizing that these goals were far too am-
bitious, it lowered the targets to 240 million 
tons of grain and 2.15 million tons of cotton, 
while increasing substantially the proposed 
agricultural development effort. However, we 
believe that these goals are still too optimistic, 
in view of the limited amount of fertilizers 
that will be available and the modest pro-
posed increases in both irrigated areas and 
sown area obtained through reclamation and 
multiple cropping. Between 1957 and 1962 
grain production will probably only rise from 
185 million tons to 215 million tons and cotton 
from 1.64 million tons to 2 million tons. About 
one-fourth of these production increases are 
expected to result from increased application 
of chemical fertilizer. 
57. The above estimates imply a rate of in-
crease of agricultural production of about 
three percent annually. This increase would 
provide a small margin over the probable an-
nual increase of population of 2.0-2.5 percent. 
However, a number of contingencies could re-
move this margin. A major imponderable is 
the willingness of the peasants to maintain 
their efforts to produce under collectivization. 
Weather and its effect on crops are also un-
predictable. Finally, we cannot completely 
discount the possibility that the present rate 
of population growth might increase. Under 
the worst combination of these contingen-
cies for the Chinese Communists ? a series 
of bad crop years, peasant apathy, and 
a rising rate of population growth ? the 
regime would face grave difficulties. How-
ever, with its internal security system and 
its control of food distribution the regime 
could almost certainly maintain itself in 
power. Furthermore, other stopgap measures 
open to Peiping would include loans or aid 
from the Soviet Bloc, and a reduction in ex-
ports and some increase in imports of agricul-
tural products. At the same time, the regime 
would have sufficient production capacity in 
heavy industry and construction to enable it 
to maintain industrial growth, though at a 
reduced rate. 
58. Ensuring a food supply for its enormous 
and growing population will be Communist 
China's number one economic problem for the 
indefinite future. Arable land is relatively 
limited, and by far the major share of the 
land area is too high, dry, or hilly to be culti-
vated. At present about 11 percent of the 
land is under cultivation. Marginal lands 
could be brought under cultivation and double 
cropping extended through heavy investment 
and modern techniques which would increase 
the sown area by possibly half. With a gen-
erous water supply and a long growing season 
in the most important farm areas, yields can 
be raised through improvements in flood con-
trol, irrigation, pest control, crop types, and 
fertilization. In the long run and with more 
investment, we believe the Chinese Commu-
nists can probably double agricultural output. 
However, present population growth, if unal-
tered, would double the population in 28 to 35 
years, making difficult any improvement in 
living standards even if all agricultural po-
tentials were realized. 
59. Industrial Production. No finalized Sec-
ond Five Year Plan has been prepared, but 
the preliminary proposals put before the 
Eighth Congress of the Chinese Communist 
Party in September, 1956, provided for an in-
crease in gross value of industrial production 
of about 86 percent during the Second Plan, 
compared to a rise of about 115 percent 
achieved during the First Plan. Heavy in-
dustry will continue to receive priority. Al-
though there is evidence of considerable 
change in the individual industral goals, the 
attainment of the overall industrial goal, as 
proposed, appears likely in view of the pros-
pective level of industrial investment. (See 
Table 1.) 
60. An increasing proportion of heavy indus-
trial investment will be in new industrial areas 
in northern Manchuria and in north-central 
and northwest China, based upon the location 
of raw materials and upon strategic consider-
ations. Increased production during the Sec-
ond Plan will rely greatly on completion of 
new capacity, much of which was started dur-
ing the First Plan. In contrast with the First 
Five Year Plan, in which emphasis was on 
large scale plants, significant proportions of

the increased output of iron, steel, and coal 
will come from newly constructed or renovated 
small and medium size units. To the extent 
that this program is implemented, it will pro-
vide more employment, conserve scarce capi-
tal, and require less machinery imports. 
61. The variety of products made by Chinese 
industry will continue to increase rapidly, but 
there will continue to be shortages, especially 
in chemical fertilizers and crude oil. During 
the Second Five Year Plan, the machine 
building industry will probably be able to sup-
ply at least 70 percent of machinery require-
ments, compared to about 60 percent in the 
First Five Year Plan. In addition to the pri-
ority development of the chemical fertilizer 
and machinery industries, it is expected that 
increased attention will be given to merchant 
shipbuilding, copper, and crude oil. Even if 
the regime achieves its crude oil targets, how-
ever, in 1962 it will still be heavily dependent 
on imports to meet its rapidly increasing re-
quirements. 
62. Shortages of trained technicians and sci-
entists will continue to exist. In an effort to 
solve this problem, the regime plans to have 
one third of the 500,000 students, who will 
graduate from colleges and universities dur-
ing the next five years, go into teaching in all 
fields. Of those who will not go into teaching, 
one half will be engineers, a third will be in 
medicine, science, agriculture, or forestry, 
and about a sixth in law, the social sciences, 
and other fields. During this period the re-
gime also plans to double its present enroll-
ment in primary and middle schools. Even 
if these goals are met by 1962, however, the 
regime will still be far short of the highly 
trained personnel needed in the scientific and 
technical fields. 
63. Foreign Trade. Total exports in the Sec-
ond Five Year Plan are estimated at 32.0 bil-
lion yuan, and imports at 29.2 billion yuan. 
This compares with 23.3 and 25.2 billion yuan, 
respectively, during the First Five Year Plan.

China's trade will continue to be with the 
other Bloc countries, especially the Soviet 
Union. However, the proportion of total trade 
with the non-Communist world will probably 
increase in the Second Five Year Plan, ex-
panding from about 22 percent to possibly 30 
percent of total trade. We believe that the 
most important elements of this increase will 
be an expansion of Communist China's ex-
ports of iron ore and coal to Japan and con-
sumers goods to South and Southeast Asia, 
and imports of fertilizers, industrial equip-
ment, and steel from Japan and capital goods 
from Western Europe. Communist China will 
probably increase the use of its growing mer-
chant marine in international trade. 
64. The maintenance of the present level of 
multilateral trade controls will complicate 
Chinese Communist economic and military 
development by creating import problems, in-
creasing costs, and reducing flexibility. Fur-
thermore, present unilateral US financial con-
trols will deny Communist China an impor-
tant export market, as well as reduce dollar 
remittances. 
65. The Chinese Communists apparently are 
going ahead with their Second Five Year Plan 
with no provision for new long term credits 
from the USSR. Communist China will have 
to finance through exports the imports re-
quired for industrialization, as well as to re-
pay Soviet credits advanced during the First 
Five Year Plan and to finance their own aid 
program ? both of which total an estimated 
3.0 billion yuan. With their present capabili-
ties, the Chinese Communists can probably 
carry out their planned industrial develop-
ment without further Soviet credits. How-
ever, in the event of serious economic diffi-
culties, the Chinese might seek and obtain 
some assistance on credit from the USSR. 
B. The Party 
66. The party will probably continue to face 
difficulties in maintaining vigor, flexibility, 
and internal discipline. The strains created 
by recent massive shifts of cadres to lower 
levels and the difficulty of absorbing the high 
post-1949 membership will continue. Difficul-
ties that will inevitably arise in formulating 
15 
the regime's program will almost certainly 
create policy differences at various party 
levels. Although these problems may force 
the party occasionally to resort to repressive 
measures, in the main the regime will prob-
ably be able, through periodic rectification 
programs, to resolve intra-party conflicts by 
discussion, persuasion, and administrative 
disciplinary procedures. Moreover, we believe 
that the party will retain a significant degree 
of flexibility in its policies. 
67. These problems would be aggravated by 
the death or incapacitation of Mao. Should a 
succession question arise in the next five years, 
party authority would probably initially pass 
to a group, with Liu Shao-chi, Chou En-lai, 
Teng Hsiao-ping, and Ch'en Yun as its most 
likely members, and with Chu Teh as titular 
head of state. Policy disagreements and 
power rivalries would probably sharpen in the 
absence of Mao. The temptation to occupy 
his position would be great, and could lead 
to a struggle for dominance within the party. 
We believe that such a struggle would com-
plicate the achieving of certain of the regime's 
objectives and reduce its policy flexibility, but 
would not threaten the regime's ability to 
control the country. 
C. Popular Attitudes 
68. We see little prospect that popular discon-
tent can or will be translated into organized 
and active resistance in the near future. Un-
rest will probably continue at about its pres-
ent level, and sporadic cases of isolated, small-
scale active resistance will probably occur, 
particularly in rural and ethnic minority 
areas. Reactions to the increasing pressures 
of austerity and industrialization may, at 
times, cause the regime to clamp down, but 
the Chinese Communist leadership, while cap-
italizing on the people's recognition of the 
regime's willingness to utilize severely repres-
sive measures if necessary, will probably avoid 
widespread or systematic use of terroristic 
methods. There will continue to be much 
dissatisfaction, but we believe the net effect 
on the regime's programs will be no more 
than a complicating or retarding one. Al-
though the regime will continue to seek

SECRET 16 
greater positive support, it will have limited 
success because of its determination to carry 
out its economic and social programs. The 
response of the bulk of the Chinese people to 
the regime will probably remain one of acqui-
escence. 
69. The regime will continue to have prob-
lems with intellectuals. The outspoken criti-
cisms which came from the universities in the 
spring of 1957 showed the regime that its 
efforts at indoctrination failed to force many 
students and professors into accepting the 
Communist way. The problems of winning 
the student generation will be made more dif-
ficult by the shortage of facilities for higher 
education, the limited urban employment op-
portunities for graduates, and the need to 
sharpen disciplinary measures and political 
controls over students. Furthermore, the re-
gime will probably continue to force great 
numbers of middle school graduates to accept 
long-term agricultural assignments in the 
countryside. 
70. The peasants will almost certainly con-
tinue to give the regime trouble. The regime 
recognizes that a major problem during the 
Second Five Year Period will be to improve 
the management of the collective farms and 
to obtain from the peasants a greater accept-
ance of the collective system. The regime 
will probably be able to keep the peasants in 
line by enforcement of tighter controls, and, 
in good crop years, by allowing some increases 
in consumption. 
D. The Military Establishment 
71. Communist China's military capability 
will almost certainly continue to improve over 
the next five years. Although the army will 
probably be reduced in size, it will be equipped 
with newer and better weapons, and will be 
more mobile and better trained than at pres-
ent. The air force and navy will increase in 
size and effectiveness. Although the armed 
forces will be somewhat better balanced, the 
concept of a large ground army will still pre-
vail. The Chinese Communists will probably 
maintain a large standing army which, in 
addition to its offensive and defensive mis-
sions, will provide the basic force for con-
trolling mainland China and will continue to 
have an intimidating effect in Asia. 
72. By 1962 the combined air forces will prob-
ably have about 3,600 aircraft, an increase of 
more than 700. The Chinese Communists 
probably will have completed converting their 
fighters and light bombers to jets, and may by 
that time have some jet medium bombers. 
The navy will probably continue its rapid 
development, with principal emphasis on im-
proved defense capability within home waters. 
There will probably be a significant increase 
in submarine strength, and the probable re-
placement of overage ships will increase the 
navy's operating effectiveness. 
73. The armaments industry will increase in 
size and efficiency, but during the period of 
this estimate, Communist China will continue 
to be heavily dependent upon the Soviet Union 
for many kinds of heavy and complex military 
equipment and for technological assistance. 
During 1958-1962 it will probably be able to 
meet armed force needs for small arms and 
for nearly all artillery, transport, and ammu-
nition, but will still be unable to meet the 
needs for armored fighting vehicles and more 
complex fire control systems. The shipbuild-
ing industry will also continue its rapid ex-
pansion. Domestic aircraft production will 
probably increase considerably, but Commu-
nist China will continue to be dependent on 
the USSR for many components. 
74. Although Communist China will almost 
certainly not have developed a missile or nu-
clear weapons production capability of its own 
by 1962 because of the continuing shortage of 
technicians and the demands of other mili-
tary and economic programs upon its limited 
resources, we believe that the Chinese Com-
munists will press the USSR for such advanced 
weapons. It is probable that during the next 
five years the USSR will provide the Chinese 
Communists with some varieties of missiles 
and other weapons adaptable to nuclear use, 
but with conventional warheads. The Chi-
nese Communist and Soviet views on the in-
troduction of nuclear warheads 8 into Com-
munist China are less certain. Unless barred 
by an effective international agreement, the 
Including bombs.

USSR may introduce nuclear weapons into 
Communist China by 1962, although they will 
almost certainly remain under Soviet control. 
In any event, even though nuclear warheads 
were not deployed in Communist China, they 
would be readily available if Sino-Soviet in-
terests required them. 
IV. COMMUNIST CHINA'S EXTERNAL 
RELATIONS 
A. With the Bloc 
75. Communist China's close relations with 
the USSR are based on mutual objectives, re-
liance on Soviet military power and economic 
support, a common ideology, and a conviction 
that Bloc unity is essential in the face of a 
common enemy. In the Chinese Communist 
view, unity is crucial to the expulsion of West-
ern, particularly US, influence from Asia and 
Africa, and to the ultimate achievement of 
economic and military superiority over the 
West. The Chinese Communists appear to 
accept the Soviet Union as the head of the 
Bloc because of its experience and leadership 
in the doctrinal, economic and technological 
fields, and because of its military power. They 
have supported Soviet policy on all interna-
tional questions. Communist China has in 
turn sought and gained Bloc acceptance as 
the second major Communist power and, 
probably, as a participant with the Soviet 
Union in the formulation of general Bloc 
policy. 
76. The Chinese Communists insist that the 
strength and unity of the Bloc against the 
West must be maintained and that the essen-
tial Communist character of each Bloc state 
be preserved. To the extent that it will con-
tribute to, or is compatible with, these over-
riding considerations, the Chinese Commu-
nists favor flexibility in intra-Bloc relations, 
desiring particularly that the Chinese party 
have a wide area of doctrinal and policy ini-
tiative. Although there have been differences 
in the emphasis which the Chinese Commu-
nists have placed on various aspects of intra-
Bloc relations over the past two years, their 
basic concept of intra-Bloc relations has re-
mained: the USSR is the head of the socialist 
camp and the member states should at all 
17 
times place the interests of unity among the 
Socialist countries above everything else; but 
the USSR should, in turn, refrain from ex-
cessive intervention in the internal affairs of 
each Communist state. These views of unity 
and diversity were substantially reflected in 
the Moscow 40th Anniversary communique, 
probably of joint Sino-Soviet authorship. 
77. Close Sino-Soviet alignment does not ap-
pear to have been affected by the cessation of 
Soviet credits, although the Chinese Commu-
nists may have hoped for new credits or for 
more lenient repayment terms on past credits. 
Whatever the nature of the Peiping-Moscow 
discussions on this subject, the Chinese Com-
munists appear to have accommodated them-
selves to the situation, and in 1957 they al-
tered their planning for the Second Five Year 
Plan to take account of reduced estimates of 
import availabilities. The Soviet Union is 
still extending technical assistance and has 
concluded a long-term agreement which is 
believed to provide for an increased level of 
Sino-Soviet trade, including the bulk of the 
essential import needs of Communist China's 
industrial development program. Moreover, 
the Chinese Communists probably believe that 
the USSR remains a source of aid in the 
event of a serious crisis. 
78. Sino-Soviet relations as they concern 
guidance to the Asian Communist parties ap-
pear to have been governed by a mutually 
acceptable division of responsibilities and a 
willingness to cooperate. Despite occasional 
differences of nuance in the statements of 
Asian Communist parties, we have little evi-
dence of any Sino-Soviet disagreement on the 
character of Communist activities in Asia. 
Communist leaders of North Korea and North 
Vietnam, as well as those in non-Communist 
Asian countries, visit both Moscow and Pei-
ping for consultation. The policy line, as 
given in newspapers and radio broadcasts of 
both countries, varies little if any. 
79. With respect to the border areas, the 
USSR and Communist China apparently have 
overcome, or at least suppressed, their his-
torical conflict of interests, and in Sinkiang 
and Outer Mongolia are cooperating in de-
velopment programs. The Soviet Union is

SECRET 
building the portion of the trans-Sinkiang 
rail line from the Soviet line in Kazakhistan 
to Wusu in Sinkiang Province, and the Chi-
nese Communists have accepted Soviet tech-
nicians in the area to assist in its develop-
ment. The USSR, by constructing the trans-
Mongolian railroad to China, has facilitated 
increased Chinese Communist cultural and 
economic relations with Outer Mongolia. 
80. During the five year period of the esti-
mate, it does not appear likely that there will 
be any appreciable change either in the firm-
ness of the Sino-Soviet relationship or in 
China's status and role therein. Though 
there will almost certainly be frictions, Com-
munist China and the USSR will probably be 
able to work out satisfactory solutions to prob-
lems arising out of China's status in the Bloc, 
its economic relations with the USSR, and the 
division of Communist responsibilities in Asia. 
Nevertheless, because of Communist China's 
growing stature and strength, it is possible 
that problems may arise which would be diffi-
cult to resolve. 
81. A source of disagreement may be Commu-
nist China's possible desire to exert greater 
influence on general Bloc policy, both internal 
and external. Because of the immense value 
of the Sino-Soviet alliance to both partners, 
Soviet and Chinese Communist leaders al-
most certainly will consider that they must 
meet certain of each other's requests, be care-
ful not to offend each other's sensibilities, and 
defer, at times, to the other partner. Al-
though the Soviet leaders will almost certainly 
be apprehensive lest a strengthened China 
seriously challenge the USSR for Communist 
primacy at some distant date, there is no evi-
dence that this is affecting present policy. 
External policy disagreements, if any, would 
be more likely to occur with respect to areas 
where the interests of one party might be con-
siderably greater, such as the Taiwan straits, 
or where they differed as to the risks involved 
in undertaking a specific action. 
82. With respect to high level Soviet negotia-
tions with the West, the Chinese Communists 
probably feel that it would be inadvisable at 
present to press for the introduction of topics 
which are of primary interest to Communist 
18 
China and which would require its presence, 
e.g., entrance into the UN and the acquisition 
of Taiwan. It is possible, however, that dif-
ferences between Peiping and Moscow may 
arise in the future with respect to the sub-
stance or the mechanics of negotiations with 
the West. 
83. Sino-Soviet cohesion would probably not 
be significantly affected by a Soviet-Western 
detente, or by Communist China's entry into 
the UN or recognition by the US. Communist 
China would probably welcome a Soviet-West-
ern detente because its leaders would believe 
that this would increase Communist oppor-
tunities in Asia. They would probably also 
welcome a limitation of armaments agree-
ment which convinced them that they could 
safely reduce their expenditures for arms, al-
though they would probably take the position 
that they would not be bound to any agree-
ment in which they did not formally partici-
pate as the representative of China. The 
USSR would almost certainly welcome Com-
munist China's representation in the UN and 
its recognition by the US, although the So-
viet leaders might have some misgivings that 
these developments might reduce somewhat 
Peiping's political dependence on the USSR. 
B. Relations with the Non-Communist 
World 
84. Communist China's leaders appear to 
view the present world position of the Sino-
Soviet Bloc with considerable confidence. 
They seem convinced that the world balance 
of power has shifted to the Bloc and that the 
"East Wind" is prevailing over the West. Chi-
nese Communist optimism is based on a view 
of history that assumes that Communism will 
ultimately triumph and on specific develop-
ments such as recent Soviet weapons ad-
vances, Communist gains in the Near East 
and Africa, and the rapid economic growth of 
the Bloc. While the Chinese Communists 
probably do not consider that the West has 
suffered any decisive defeat in the Far East 
since the French were forced out of Indochina, 
they appear confident that the trend in Asia

non-Communist Asia," dated 3 December 1957.

Declassified and Approved For Release 2013/08/21 : CIA-RDP79R01012A011400020001-4 
SECRET 
is running against the West. Peiping almost 
certainly considers the growth of Communist 
political strength and influence in Indonesia 
and of neutralism and anti-American feeling 
in some Asian countries as indications of this 
trend. 
85. In a period of less than a decade, Peiping's 
leaders have seen their country become the 
strongest Asian power and achieve substantial 
progress in making its impact felt in Asia 
and the world. They are cognizant of grow-
ing pressure in the Free World for expanded 
economic and political relations with Pei-
ping. Communist China is not handicapped 
by Asian racial antagonisms against the white 
man and it can claim common experience with 
the former colonial areas. The Chinese Com-
munists almost certainly believe their eco-
nomic progress can be used in their efforts 
to convince the underdeveloped Asian coun-
tries that Communism is the best way for-
ward. 
86. The Chinese Communists have given no 
indications of undue impatience in the pursuit 
of their objectives in Asia. They appear aware 
of the many problems of internal develop-
ment facing Communist China, the continu-
ing need to adjust and reconcile intra-Bloc 
relations, and the suspicions of Communist 
China which exist in much of Asia. Most 
importantly, they almost certainly consider 
the presence of US influence and military 
forces in Asia to be the major obstacle in their 
path. They almost certainly estimate that 
any attempt to speed up the process of com-
munizing Asia by military aggression would 
involve serious risk of war with the US, but 
at the same time probably believe that over 
the long run the US will not be able effec-
tively to counter the forces which they con-
sider to be working to the advantage of Com-
munist China. 
87. Given these views, Communist China ap-
pears to be directing its energies toward the 
intermediate objective of weakening the posi-
tion and influence of the US in Asia. To this 
end it is seeking to induce Asian countries 
to adopt a policy of friendship toward the 
Bloc, to strengthen, and if possible bring to 
power, indigenous Communist movements 
19 
without the use of external force, and to un-
dermine the will of the Nationalists on Tai-
wan to resist. Since Indochina, the prin-
cipal thrust of Communist China's policy has 
been reasonableness and peaceful coexistence, 
though it has been adamant on certain basic 
issues, particularly Taiwan. 
88. We believe that Communist China will 
continue essentially the outlines of its present 
flexible course in Asia, though displaying 
more assertiveness and a heightened readiness 
to take advantage of opportune situations. 
It will probably intensify its efforts to con-
vince other nations of its peacefulness and 
reasonableness, and even of its willingness 
for a rapprochement with the US, believing 
that an apparent readiness to make conces-
sions will add significantly to Free World 
pressures to accept Communist China as a 
member of the community of nations and to 
bring about a change in US policy. 
89. Communist China will continue to seek 
admission to the UN and the expansion of 
economic and political relations with most 
states. It will probably make additional of-
fers of economic assistance to other Asian 
countries. At the same time, it will continue 
its subversive efforts throughout the Far East. 
In its propaganda overtures, it will attempt 
to create an exaggerated impression of its eco-
nomic growth, and, while stressing its peace-
ful intentions, will do nothing to dim its grow-
ing reputation in Asia as a military power. 
In relations with Asian states its military 
power will be an operating but silent factor. 
It will probably not resort to overt military 
aggression which it believes would involve it 
in military action with the US. 
90. Peiping is probably concerned that, as an 
unwanted by-product of peaceful coexistence, 
there is a growing acceptance of a "two-
Chinas" concept. The Chinese Communists 
will continue their efforts to disabuse the 
world, and especially other Asian leaders, of 
any idea that Communist China will renounce 
its intention to gain control of Taiwan. They 
will almost certainly not resort to military 
action to seize Taiwan, so long as this would 
involve risk of war with the US. They will 
almost certainly continue their present efforts

SECRET 
to undermine Nationalist will and to discredit 
the Republic of China abroad. The possibil-
ity cannot be excluded that the Chinese Com-
munists will adopt a more aggressive policy 
toward the Offshore Islands, in part because 
of intense irritation and a sense of affront, 
in part to emphasize their determination to 
destroy the Nationalist government, and in 
part to test US intentions in the Taiwan area. 
If they should become convinced that the US 
would not intervene militarily, they would 
seek to capture these islands by military ac-
tion. 
91. The Chinese Communists will probably 
complete the announced withdrawal of their 
forces from Korea in order to bring pressure 
on the US to do the same, to enhance Commu-
nist China's chances for UN entry, and to 
support Moscow's efforts to create Free World 
pressures for summit negotiations and dis-
engagement schemes. However, Peiping will 
almost certainly maintain its military forces 
in a position to reintervene rapidly in case of 
a resumption of hostilities. The Chinese Com-
munists, in concert with the Soviet Union, 
will probably encourage the North Korean re-
gime to build covert strength in South Korea 
and to press for the reestablishment of cul-
tural and economic contacts across the armi-
stice line. The Chinese Communists will 
probably publicly support North Korean pres-
sure for nationwide elections under "neutral" 
supervision, but will continue to oppose direct 
UN supervision. The Chinese Communists 
will almost certainly not agree to unification 
on terms which they estimate would lead to 
an anti-Communist Korea. 
92. Peiping's objectives in Vietnam will simi-
larly be to strengthen the Communist regime 
in the north while attempting to undermine 
the government in the south. Peiping will 
continue to support Communist agitation for 
nation-wide elections under conditions that 
would favor the Communists. The Chinese 
Communists may believe that should South 
Vietnam be deprived of President Diem's 
leadership, the Communists might gain suffi-
cient strength to seize control from within. 
93. Japan will continue to be one of Peiping's 
most important targets, especially because 
20 
there is a growing area of competition between 
Communist China and Japan. Chinese 
Communist policies will be directed toward 
reducing the degree of cooperation between 
Japan and the US, particularly in the mili-
tary field, toward undermining the Japanese 
government's anti-Communist position, to-
ward destroying the friendly relations between 
Japan and the GRC, and toward increas-
ing the influence in Japan of left-wing ele-
ments, e.g., left-wing Socialists, and the Japa-
nese Communist Party. Peiping will continue 
to exploit Japan's desire for peace, its fears 
of becoming involved in a nuclear war, any 
areas of friction with the US, and Japan's 
eagerness to expand trade with mainland 
China. Peiping will probably be able to gain 
at least quasi-diplomatic status for a Chinese 
Communist trade mission. In pursuit of these 
objectives, Communist China will continue to 
employ both conciliatory and tough tactics. 
94. Although the majority of the Overseas 
Chinese will probably continue to seek to 
avoid entanglement in the political activities 
of both Communist and Nationalist China, 
Peiping will nevertheless continue its efforts 
to use the Overseas Chinese as instruments 
for both overt and covert activities. At the 
same time, these communities will continue to 
be a source of friction between Peiping and the 
host governments. The nature and effective-
ness of Chinese Communist policy towards 
Overseas Chinese will continue to vary from 
country to country, but there are indications 
that Peiping will increase its efforts to allay 
Southeast Asian suspicions by emphasizing 
in its propaganda the responsibilities of the 
Overseas Chinese to the host country. 
95. Assuming no significant change in the 
basic policies of the Bloc or of the West, in 
particular the US, we believe that intercourse 
between Communist China and the Free 
World will increase considerably during the 
next five years. This will come about for a 
number of reasons, including a growing belief 
that normal relations with Communist China 
should be established, a hope that such rela-
tions would reduce tensions in Asia, and a 
desire to exploit what many see as a major 
trading potential. For these reasons, addi-

tional countries will probably recognize Com-
munist China, possibly including Canada, 
New Zealand, Belgium, France, and Japan. 
96. It is probable that the US will experience 
more difficulty in seeking to exclude Commu-
nist China from the UN. Moreover, the effect 
of the UN's censure in generating opposition 
to Communist China will probably decrease 
with the passage of time and with the with-
drawal of Chinese Communist troops from 
Korea. Should Communist China gain a seat 
in the UN, it would be taken, in Asia espe-
cially, as a mark of international acceptance 
of Communist China, and many of the coun-
tries not already recognizing Peiping would 
probably do so. Particularly in Asia, com-
mercial and other forms of intercourse with 
Communist China would almost certainly in-
crease substantially. Communist China's op-
portunities in Asian countries for subversion, 
for influencing the Overseas Chinese, and for 
giving covert support to indigenous Commu-
nist parties would increase. 
97. If Communist China continues its present 
international policy, we believe that its pres-
tige in Asia will continue to grow during the 
next five years. This will occur whether or 
not additional countries recognize Commu-
nist China, or it is admitted to the UN. But 
it does not necessarily follow that as a result 
21 
of increased prestige the Chinese Communists 
will be able to induce non-Communist Asian 
countries to adopt internal or external policies 
desired by Communist China. Communist 
China's future role in Asia will be determined 
to an important extent by developments in 
five fields, in varying degrees beyond the con-
trol of the Chinese Communists: 
a. The course of events in the US-USSR re-
lationship and in the broad aspects of the cold 
war. 
b. Developments within the Bloc such as 
spectacular scientific achievements or major 
political upheavals. 
c. The extent to which local Communist 
parties, e.g., those in Indonesia, Laos, and 
India, gain or lose political strength. 
d. The extent to which the growth of Com-
munist China's power gives rise to increased 
apprehensions among Asian governments as 
to Communist China's future intentions and 
thus causes them to take increasingly effec-
tive measures at least to counter their own 
internal Communists. 
e. The extent to which the US has the confi-
dence and trust of non-Communist Asian gov-
ernments, and in turn helps these govern-
ments not only to resist the Communists, but 
also to meet their national aspirations.

Year Plan 1953-1957. Gross National Product 
increased at an average annual rate of about 
7-8 percent,2 which compared favorably with 
recent rates of a little over three percent in 
India, eight percent in Japan, and seven per-
cent in the Soviet Union. While the average 
rate of growth was fairly rapid, increases from 
year to year were uneven, in large part because 
agricultural output, which provides about 50 
percent of total national income and the raw 
materials that determine the output of light 
industry, depends upon uncertain weather 
conditions. (See Figure 4 for Gross National 
Product, by sector of origin.) 
A2. To achieve this rate of growth, total in-
vestment averaged 17 percent of the GNP for 
the five year period, a proportion roughly com-
parable to that in the US. Investment in 
capital construction accounted for about 58 
percent of gross investment during the five 
year period; of total investment in capital con-
struction 56 percent went into industry, 19 
percent into transportation and communica-
tions, and only about 8 percent into agricul-
ture. Nevertheless, over 50 percent of total 
investment funds were derived directly or in-
directly from agricultural output. 
A3. Communist China's budget revenues rose 
sharply up to 1954 as the regime consolidated 
1Chinese Communist statistics upon which the 
data and analyses throughout this estimate are 
based are subject to the same reservations as 
those of other Bloc countries, but to a somewhat 
greater extent, in view of the inexperience on 
the part of the newly established Chinese Com-
munist statistical collection system. This inex-
perience probably accounts for the majority of 
such statistical defects as have been noted. Chi-
nese Communist statistics are the basis for the 
regime's planning and we believe are not, in 
general, misrepresented. 
its controls over the economy, but have since 
risen more gradually and, as a proportion of 
the GNP, actually declined slightly from 29 to 
27 percent between 1954 and 1957. The re-
gime's fiscal policies have been to maximize 
revenues and to tailor its expenditures to its 
expected receipts. The regime's flexible con-
trol over expenditures has generally main-
tained budgetary balance and economic sta-
bility, except in 1956 when the government 
resorted to currency issue to cover a budget 
deficit. However, a surplus in state revenues 
was reestablished in 1957, largely as a result 
of a cutback in investment. (See Figure 5 
for state revenues and expenditures.) 
Industrial Production 
A4. During the First Five Year Plan, Com-
munist China, with substantial Soviet assist-
ance, made considerable progress in laying 
the foundations for industrialization. Start-
ing from a small base, the gross value of in-
dustrial output increased about 133 percent, 
with heavy industry increasing more than 
200 percent and light industry some 85 per-
cent. Although the average annual rate of 
growth of industrial output during the period 
was high (16.5 percent) , it was uneven, being 
reduced to 7 percent in 1957, which was a year 
of consolidation and rebuilding of inventories 
after the overambitious construction activity 
of 1956. 
However, in international comparisons, account 
should be taken of Communist China's price 
structure, which in terms of world prices over-
values industrial manufactures ? the fastest 
growing sector ? and thus overstates the rate 
of growth. If Communist China's industrial 
manufactures were re-valued at world market 
prices, the rate of growth would drop to 6-7 
percent.
