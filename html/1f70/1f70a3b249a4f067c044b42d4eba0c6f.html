 China: Deng Under Pressure
 Summary
 Conflict within the Chinese leadership has become increasingly
 evident since the ouster of Hu Yaobang in January. Although some
 clashes probably have been over patronage and policy issues, we believe
 Deng Xiaoping's conservative rivals, most notably Peng Zhen, are trying to
 challenge Deng's authority and primacy. Conservative inroads, particularly
 within the party's propaganda department, and the current stalemate over
 economic reforms suggest that Deng's power has eroded. We are less
 sure, however, whether this represents a temporary setback for Deng or a
 more fundamental shift in the balance of power. Much depends on a key
 unknown--whether Deng still commands the loyalty of his traditional allies
 among party elders and the military. Although Deng and Zhao Ziyang
 appear to have taken the offensive recently, stressing the importance of
 moving ahead with reform, we may not be able to gauge the strength of
 the conservative and reform camps until the results are in from this
 summer's preparatory meetings for the October party congress.
 This memorandum was prepared by           :::]Office of East Asian Analysis.
 Information available as of 5 June 1987 was used in its preparation. Comments and
 queries are welcome and may be directed to the Chief, Political Assessments Branch,

 An Embattled Deng?
 Since January, Deng in our judgment has been acting as if he is on the defensive.
 He may feel vulnerable not only for having sponsored the now disgraced Hu Yaobang as
 party chief, but perhaps even more for his own longstanding record of ideological
 pragmatism--probably an easier target for his rivals than his policies, which have been
 formally endorsed by the Central Committee. Indeed, Deng and his allies have gone to
 extraordinary lengths over the past several months to polish Deng's orthodox ideological
 credentials and, by extension, to distance him from Hu's alleged ideological deviations:
 ? A new, revised edition of Deng's "Build Socialism With Chinese
 Characteristics"--selections from his speeches and inscriptions--contains
 criticism of Hu for inattention to ideology. -
 ? Party leaders, including Acting General Secretary Zhao Ziyang and party elder
 Wang Zhen, have gone out of their way to note Deng's long espousal of
 conservative themes.
 ? The propaganda treatment of Deng's book and others of his works has been
 unusually obsequious and reminiscent of the cult of Mao Zedong.
 Deng's meetings with an unusually broad array of foreign dignitaries seem an
 attempt to rally support and counter the growing conservative voice in the media.   He
 has commented extensively on current Chinese politics during talks with visitors who, in
 ordinary times, would never have rated an audience. Deng seems determined to remind
 the public that he is still in charge and to make sure that special points he wants to
 make either get into the official press or into the classified media summaries for
 cadres: I
 ? In March, Deng used a meeting with Canada's governor general to put political
 structural reform--a key point of contention last summer between reformers and
 conservatives--back on the agenda.
 ?  In an April meeting with the President of Gambia, Deng pointedly omitted
 referring to China's effort against bourgeois liberalism while summarizing China's
 policies as "opening up and reform." He has repeated this formulation on several
 occasions.
 New China News Agency foreign press summaries such as Cankao Ziliao ("Reference
 Material") and Cankao Xiaoxi ("Reference News") contain both edited and unabridged
 articles and are compiled for official use. Chinese leaders frequently demonstrate a
 thorough knowledge of Hong Kong and Western media coverage of China, which
 almost certainly is acquired from classified press materials and like publications.

 ? Deng has used sessions with the Gambians and other delegations to reminisce
 about his experiences during the Cultural Revolution era, perhaps in part to
 soothe anxious foreign investors by again disavowing Cultural Revolution - style
 movements, but also to warn his rivals against the hazards of open political
 warfare.
 ? In remarks that the official press did not publicize, Deng told a visiting Spanish
 official that, contrary to the emphasis on China's current effort against rightist
 phenomena, the "main struggle" should be against the leftist trend and "nostalgic
 leftists" within the party.
 ? Deng noted ambiguously to Bulgarian party chief Zhivkov that "old fighters have
 their strong points and problems.  .   they may even be involved in disputes and
 complications." Such problems, Deng allowed, should be solved "when we are
 still alive." He may have been referring to problems between China and the
 Soviet Bloc, or among Chinese themselves.
 Recent remarks by Zhao clearly allude to top-level infighting. On 17 May, the
 Beijing-controlled Wen Wei Po of Hong Kong summarized Zhao's speech to a recent
 unidentified conference, where the acting party chief railed against "certain comrades"
 who attack the reforms under the guise of protecting ideological purity. Zhao reportedly
 pointed out that deepening the drive against bourgeois liberalism did not mean
 organizing a Mao-style mass campaign and creating a tense political atmosphere,
 remarks that were echoed in sharply worded People's Daily editorials of 17 and 22 May.
 Signs of Conservative Strength
 If Deng seems on the defensive, it may be because China's more orthodox
 leaders are engaged in a full court press to weaken Deng and his allies while seeking
 support for themselves. An example is the March session of the National People's
 Congress, where Peng Zhen and the NPC Standing Committee--a conservative
 bastion--sidetracked a vital enterprise management reform and, by so doing, also
 prevented an important measure to regulate enterprise bankruptcy from going into
 effect. The annual NPC session in fact was dominated by Peng and his conservative
 allies and to us seemed deliberately stage-managed to undermine the authority of Zhao
 and the reforms--and, implicitly, Deng:
 ? Zhao's report on the work of the government was criticized from the floor, and
 the final version incorporated criticisms of the government for inattention to
 grain production and ideological work.
 ? The NPC endorsed only "in principle" a reform that would allow villages a
 measure of self-government and referred it to Peng's Standing Committee for
 final review.

 ? A Hu Yaobang protege was ousted as Minister of Public Security and was
 replaced by a provincial official who                           once served as
 Peng Zhen's secretary.
 ? After the close of the NPC, a group of People's Delegates in Tianjin sharply
 criticized construction projects under the authority of Mayor Li Ruihuan, a
 reformer who has been mentioned as a possible successor to Zhao Ziyang.
 Another group in Sichuan criticized the provincial party committee, led by a Zhao
 protege, for a "lack of drive" in effecting economic retrenchment.
 The State Education Commission, headed by Vice Premier Li Peng--widely
 reported to be a conservative favorite--also has been unusually active in advancing an
 orthodox point of view.  In April and May the commission sponsored forums on
 ideological work. Sharing the dais with archconservatives Hu Qiaomu and Deng Liqun, Li
 delivered an "important speech" at the May session, according to Chinese press
 accounts. The commission also promulgated regulations that for the first time since the
 Cultural Revolution require students to spend time working in factories or the
 countryside. This is at once a distinctly conservative response to last year's student
 demonstrations and a retreat from the longstanding reformist emphasis on academic
 Moreover, the official media have had a distinctly conservative cast since Hu
 Yaobang's ouster and have vigorously pushed orthodox economic and political themes
 while assiduously promoting the visibility of conservative leaders. All but eclipsed by
 Deng and Hu 6 months ago, prominent old-guard figures are now able to get their every
 public appearance and utterance replayed in the daily press. Meanwhile, ideologues led
 by Politburo member Hu Qiaomu, Secretariat member Deng Liqun, and the new
 propaganda chief Wang Renzhi apparently are presiding over an attempted consolidation
 of conservative influence in the party's propaganda organs:
 ? Wang chaired a convocation of orthdox propagandists in January, where
 participants aired grievances against reformers for controlling access to the
 media. He attended and blessed a similar session in April that, according to the
 Hong Kong press, worked out a battle plan to purge the Chinese media. Such
 plans seem to accord with tough new party directives--leaked to Hong Kong
 journalists--but run counter to Deng's efforts to contain the antibourgeois
 liberalism drive.
 ? A recently established State Media and Publications Office led by Du Daozheng,
 the conservative former editor of Guangming Ribao, apparently will be the
 executive arm of the literary offensive. According to Du, the office has authority
 to shut down publications and discipline editorial staff.
 Conservatives have also asserted their control in ongoing party affairs. For
 example, a party circular issued in early February passed down rural rectification
 guidelines established by old-guard leader Bo Yibo that redirected the campaign away

 from promoting economic reform as mandated by Hu toward comfortably conservative
 lines. Bo, whose remarks--issued as Central Document 3 of 1987--were the first official
 account of Hu Yaobang's mistakes, has taken a prominent hand in day-to-day affairs
 since Hu's fall.                                  at least until recently he has headed
 the team in charge of personnel work for the 13th Party Congress.
 Recent leadership changes publicized in Hong Kong's Communist press may also
 work to advance orthodox interests. Deng and Zhao almost certainly had to approve the
 transfer of State Planning Commission chief Song Ping to the party Organization
 Department, but the appointment places a septuagenarian in the conservative mold as
 head of personnel work just when the leadership is deliberating organizational moves
 before the party congress. Vice Premier Yao Yilin, a longtime disciple of Chen Yun, will
 serve as acting planning minister and will return that post to Politburo standing for the
 first time since 1982, when Yao last led the commission.
 Key Uncertainties
 Despite the obvious increase in conservative influence, it is much less clear
 whether conservative leaders--Peng Zhen, Chen Yun, Hu Qiaomu, Bo Yibo, Deng
 Liqun--are acting in concert or even have a common set of goals. We suspect the
 more hardline ideologues like Hu Qiaomu and Deng Liqun are attempting to curb the
 power of Deng and his reform allies in order to block policies they regard as politically
 destabilizing or anathema to Marxism-Leninism. Others--who perhaps include Wang
 Zhen--seem determined to resist Deng's repeated efforts to push them into retirement
 and may only be trying to protect their own positions and to advance their proteges at
 the party congress. In contrast, we think Peng Zhen (and perhaps Bo Yibo) is trying to
 mount a challenge to Deng's primacy
 Pang Zhen has clearly been the most active and visible of conservative leaders
 since Hu Yaobang's downfall. He has used a variety of forums to air his views, and has
 done so in a way that we interpret as a proffering of leadership credentials. He
 2 Wang, a longtime ally of Deng, seems to have taken a middle course since January.
 He has been in the forefront of senior leaders attacking the trend toward bourgeois
 liberalism but has also grouped Deng with Mao as author of "classic Marxist" writings
 on art and literature.

 particularly has exploited the National Peoples Congress as a personal megaphone.
 Peng has frequently spoken and published on ideological topics, attempting in our view
 to upstage Deng as a theorist. Peng frequently uses his articles to remind readers of
 his ties to Mao and other party patriarchs:
 ? Peng held a highly publicized press conference that was the media event of the
 NPC session. He praised Deng--disingenuously, in our view--as China's "idea
 man" and sole indispensable elder on the Politburo Standing Committee, while
 disavowing any ambition to sit on that body. Peng went on to volunteer that, if a
 vote were taken then, he "could only elect Deng." Significantly, he omitted
 mentioning Zhao.
 ? In a pointed bit of political symbolism, Peng left Beijing immediately after the
 NPC for the old Jiangxi revolutionary base area, where he invoked the traditions
 of Chinese Communism.
 ? From Jiangxi, Peng journeyed to the Shenzhen and Xiamen Special Economic
 Zones, where he alluded to criticism of the SEZs but gave his own guarded
 approval to the open door activities there.
 Although conservative party elders may agree that Deng has grown too powerful
 and must be reined in, we remain skeptical in the absence of stronger evidence that
 they are cooperating in more than a loose fashion. Indeed, given their disparate
 interests, we believe Deng may yet be able to play them off against each other and
 defuse any threat. Much depends, however, on Deng's ability to command the loyalty of
 the military and such longtime allies as Yang Shangkun, Xi Zhongxun, and Wang Zhen,
 whose support has lent legitimacy to Deng's reform efforts and helped keep other old
 We believe Deng continues to have the backing of the military and his old
 cronies, but he almost certainly is concerned about the possibility of defections from the
 ranks of his veteran supporters. Evidence of their wavering loyalt  is sketchy and
 contradictory.                                                          Peng is said to
 have mobilized the support of senior military officials--including Yang
 Shangkun--against Deng at the Beidaihe meetings last summer. The Hong Kong paper
 Cheng Ming, citing official sources, ran a similiar story in January, lending some
 credence to this story. Yang, however, has loyally supported Deng and Zhao in public
 since January, and reformers seemed intent that Yang establish credentials as a leader
 of international stature during his May visit to the United States. Moreover, another
 recent report in Asiaweek, which claims to have inside sources in Beijing, says that
 Deng in a show of strength recently took over from Bo Yibo the "Committee of Nine" in
 charge of personnel changes at the 13th Party Congress.
 The depth of Peng Zhen's and other party elders' strength in the party and
 bureaucracy is equally unclear at present. These leaders of course have long possessed
 networks of supporters. Since 1978, however, most conspicuous personnel movements
 have involved the promotion of reformists that would seem to give Deng and his allies a

 decided edge as the party congress approaches. Indeed, aside from the recent push in
 the propaganda and security departments--it is unclear whether the new personnel chief
 is a staunch traditionalist--conservative personnel gains have either been unobtrusive or
 Given the fluidity of the present situation, however, we may not be able to
 accurately gauge the balance between the conservative and reform camps until after
 this summer's preparatory meetings for the October party congress. At such meetings,
 Deng has always played for strategically placed appointments of key allies in high posts
 in the party and government. Decisions on personnel matters, including the choice of a
 successor to Zhao Ziyang as premier, therefore probably will offer the best indicators of
 Deng's and his rivals' political strength.
