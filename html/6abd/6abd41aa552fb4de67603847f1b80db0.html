 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD -SENATE                                 17069
 repealing the so-called anti-alien land law,
 the State's congressional delegation urged
 today in a bipartisan, joint statement.
 All legally admitted immigrants are en-
 titled to be free to purchase land Senators
 WARREN G. MAGNUSON and HENRY M. JACK-
 SON,  Congresswoman  CATHERINE  MAY,  and
 Congressmen DON MAGNUSON, THOMAS PELLY,
 THOR C.  TOLLEFSON, JACK WESTLAND, and
 WALT HORAN declared.
 They pointed out that the 1959 Wash-
 ington Legislature had unanimously voted
 to place the constitutional amendment be-
 fore the people.
 In their joint statement, lawmakers said:
 "We feel that the resident Japanese aliens
 who contributed so much to the develop-
 ment of our State and of our country, and
 whose native-born American citizen sons
 fought so courageously in both the Euro-
 pean and the Pacific Theaters of World War
 II in spite of bigotry and persecution, were
 not only treated unfairly by this law which
 will be repealed by an affirmative vote, but
 they also earned the right to dignity and
 decency."
 Washington's representatives in the Sen-
 ate and the House said they "urge the re-
 peal of this antiquated statute that can no
 longer be used against those against whom
 it was directed because of corrective national
 legislation on the subject."
 Their statement concluded: "for fair play,
 for equality, for justice, as Americans and
 citizens of the State of Washington, join us
 in voting 'yes' on Senate Joint Resolution
 4 on November 8."
 AUTHORIZATIONS   FOR   SELECT
 COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS
 TO  SUBMIT  REPORTS    SUBSE-
 QUENT TO ADJOURNMENT
 Mr. SPARKMAN.    Mr. President, on
 behalf of the Senator from Minnesota
 [Mr. HUMPHREYI, chairman of the Sub-
 committee on Retailing, Distribution, and
 Fair Trade Practices, I ask unanimous
 consent that the Select Committee on
 Small Business be authorized, during the
 adjournment of the 2d session of the
 86th.Congress, to file with the Secretary
 of the Senate a report entitled "Dual Dis-
 tribution in the Automotive Tire Indus-
 try," and that the report be printed
 along with any individual, supplemental
 or minority views.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 Mr. SPARKMAN.  Mr. President, on
 behalf of the Senator from Florida [Mr.
 SMATHERS], chairman of the Subcommit-
 tee on Government Procurement, I ask
 unanimous consent that the Select Com-
 mittee on Small Business be authorized,
 during the adjournment of the 2d ses-
 sion of the 86th Congress, to file with
 the Secretary of the Senate a report
 entitled  "Government  Procurement,
 1960," and that the report be printed
 along with any individual, supplemental,
 or minority views.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 NATIONAL EMPLOY THE PHYSICAL-
 LY  HANDICAPPED  WEEK-PAUL
 STRACHEN
 Mr. SPARKMAN. Mr. President, yes-
 terday the Post Office Department issued
 a stamp commemorating the National
 Employ the  Physically Handicapped
 Week.  I am delighted to see the Post
 Office Department take this action giv-
 ing recognition to the program of em-
 ployment of the physically handicapped,
 and the dedication of a week each year
 to that program. I take special pride in
 it because I was the author of the reso-
 lution that established the National Em-
 ploy the Handicapped Week, and it has
 been continued in good fashion since.
 At the time the resolution was agreed
 to, a man in Washington, who was him-
 self physically handicapped, headed an
 organization that worked very hard for
 the physically handicapped.  He was on
 the brink of death at one time, and it
 was believed that he would never be able
 to survive. However, he pulled through.
 Many Senators and Representatives will
 recall the man to whom I refer. He is
 Paul Strachen.
 Paul has left Washington and is now
 living in Florida.  I believe no one had
 more to do with initiating, working for,
 pushing through, and bringing to final
 fruition the movement to show some
 interest in the employment of physically
 handicapped persons  than did  Paul
 Strachen. I believe it is only fitting that
 on the occasion that this commemora-
 tive stamp is issued we should remem-
 ber the very fine, efficient and effective
 work that was done by Paul Strachen.
 He deserves a great deal of credit for
 what has been accomplished over the
 years..
 A great deal has been accomplished.
 Physically handicapped people who in
 former  days  would  not  have  been
 thought of in connection with gainful
 employment have been employed by the
 thousands throughout the. country. We
 owe a great deal to Paul Strachen. I
 wish to take this opportunity to pay
 tribute to him.
 I thank the Senator from Connecticut.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, will
 the Senator yield?
 Mr. DODD.  I yield.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 suggest the absence of a quorum, with
 the proviso that the Senator from Con-
 necticut will not lose the floor.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.  The clerk
 will call the roll.
 The legislative clerk proceeded to call
 the roll.
 Mr. MANSFIELD.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent that the order
 for the quorum call be rescinded.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without
 objection, it is so ordered.
 ENFORCEMENT OF THE BILATERAL
 AIR  AGREEMENTS-STATEMENT
 BY SENATOR MAGNUSON
 Mr. MAGNUSON.  Mr. President, I
 ask unanimous consent to have printed
 in the body of the RECORD a statement I
 sent today to the State Department and
 to the Civil Aeronautics Board.
 There being no objection, the state-
 ment was ordered to be printed in the
 RECORD, as follows:
 STATEMENT BY SENATOR MAGNUSON
 I want to commend the Department of
 State and the CAB for taking what I under-
 stand to be a step recommended by the
 Senate Committee on Interstate and Foreign
 Commerce in its report on International Air
 Agreements in 1956.  Our committee calledy?
 on the executive branch to enforce the bi!
 lateral air agreements. It has taken a long
 time and the action is long overdue but we
 are glad to see that some action is finally -
 being taken.
 I have reference to the report in the Avia-
 tion Daily for August 29, 1960, which indi-
 cates that the United States has initiated
 capacity  consultations  with  the  Scandi-
 navian governments.  The purpose of these
 talks will be to review the, operations of the
 Scandinavian   airlines to  and  from   the
 United States to see whether they conform
 to what is justified in the international air
 agreements.
 Unless prompt, vigorous, and effective ac-
 tion is taken by our Government, our air-
 lines will be driven from the skies.
 We do not threaten the legitimate opera-
 tions of foreign airlines.  There is enough
 traffic for all-if each operates in conformity
 with its solemn international air agreements.
 But when a few operate in excess of what
 is authorized-they threaten the livelihood
 of our airmen and the continued efficiency
 of our national flag lines.
 Since the  Interstate and Foreign Com-
 merce Committee urged that the State De-
 partment and the CAB enforce the agree-
 ments more than 4 years ago, we wish them
 success on this precedent-making occasion,
 when for the first time in our aviation his-
 tory, our Government has initiated capacity
 negotiations.
 [From Aviation Daily, Aug. 29, 1960]
 LIMITS URGED ON SAS TRAFFIC To
 UNITED STATES
 American-flag carriers are urging that the
 U.S. delegation to the upcoming Scandina-
 vian bilateral talks adopt specific limitations
 on traffic which SAS will be allowed to carry
 out of New York and Los Angeles.  ATA
 President S. G. Tipton has told the CAB that
 U.S. negotiators should realize that "there is
 no possibility of getting the Scandinavians
 to agree to anything."
 Tipton, who told the CAB that he spoke
 for all V.S. carriers except Ponagra, said, "No
 matter how politely and carefully, in the last
 analysis the Scandinavians are probably go-
 ing to have to be told what changes they
 must make in their scheduling policy.  Un-
 less the U.S. team goes to Copenhagen in this
 frame of mind, the whole consultation will
 not only be futile but it will be seriously
 damaging to the posture of the U.S. in other
 capacity consultations which must inevit-
 ably follow in the near future."
 This is the first indication- that the SAS
 negotiations are the first of a series to be
 held with foreign governments on capacity
 restriction.  Some clue as to who the other
 airlines are is contained in an ATA table of
 "Fifth freedom operators."   "Bermuda-type"
 operators says ATA, are those that carry
 mostly their - own nationals or U.S. citizens
 traveling to or from the foreign flag carrier's
 own country.
 ATA lists the transatlantic airlines, to-
 gether with  the percentage  of legitimate
 "Bermuda-type" traffic carrieds, as "TWA, 95
 percent; PAA, 93 percent; Lufthansa, 76 per-
 cent; Irish, 73 percent; BOAC, 72 percent;
 Air France, 62 percent; Swissair, 50 percent;
 Alitalia, 47 percent; SAS, 47 percent; Sabena,
 33 percent; KLM,, 31 percent."  Comment-
 ing on these figures, ATA says "the SAS ca-
 pacity Is not primarily tailored to fit the
 traffic flow between the United States and
 the three Scandinavian countries."
 The United States should require SAS to
 cut its on-season schedules in half and its
 off-season schedules by two-thirds, Tipton
 says.  The recommended U.S. position as-
 sumes that SAS will retain 50 percent of the
 total air traffic between the U.S. and Scandi-
 navia.  "This is generous because it means
 that the U.S. flag carrier will carry substan-
 tially less than 50 percent-the balance go-

 ate.  I Joined my colleague the distin-
 guished Senator from South Dakota [Mr.
 MUNDT] in the belief that once the Sen-
 ate had acted on the measure the House
 would promptly take parallel action.
 It is encouraging that the majority
 leader, who is confronted with so many
 competing demands from so many sides,
 has nevertheless decided to bring the
 Freedom Commission bill before the Sen-
 ate today.  His action in doing so is a
 tribute to his vision and to the bipartisan
 spirit which he has always manifested on
 basic issues of foreign policy.
 The Freedom Commission bill seeks to
 rectify what many of us consider to be
 the gravest deficiency in our national de-
 fense.
 There are some who say that if we
 wish to be secure we must be prepared
 to spend more for defense purposes-and
 I agree with this view.
 There are others who say that if we
 are to react intelligently to the Com-
 munist menace we must improve our
 policy-planning machinery-and I agree
 with that view.
 And there are still others who say that
 if we wish to compete with our Com-
 munist opponents for the minds of men
 we must improve our society and grant
 the full measure of liberty to all Ameri-
 cans-and I agree. I am in most hearty
 agreement with all these views.
 However, Mr. President, we could do
 all of these things and still lose the 'cold
 war-if we fail to recognize the total na-
 ture of the cold war, if we continue to
 fight it as amateurs against professionals,
 if we fail to give the representatives of
 the free world the same kind of intensive,
 broad spectrum  training  which  the
 Kremlin provides for its adherents in
 every part of the world where it is still
 seeking to obtain power.
 When I addressed the Senate last Fri-
 day I referred to the successes the Com-
 munists have had in such countries as
 Cuba, Iraq, Japan, and Guinea, and I
 pointed out that in every case these suc-
 cesses could be traced back principally
 to two things.
 First of all, the Communists have
 learned the art of total warfare. They
 have learned how to combine the po-
 litical, the economic, the psychological,
 the organizational, and the cultural into
 a single, integrated strategy of conflict.
 Second,  the  Communists maintain
 scores of specialized training establish-
 ments, where they teach the art of total
 political warfare to revolutionary re-
 cruits from all parts of the world.
 So long as the Communists have this
 advantage in strategic understanding,
 in training; and In organization, the free
 world will be helpless against them.
 We could make no more fatal mistake
 than to underestimate the power of a
 'single Communist professional, schooled
 in the tactics and strategy of subversion.
 Among the several  thousand men
 whom Castro had with him in the moun-
 tains, no more than several score, prob-
 ably less than a score, were Moscow-
 trained Communists.  But that handful
 of trained men were able to subvert a
 .Popular revolution and to give the Krem-
 lin effective control in Cuba today.
 American missionaries returning from
 the Congo were agreed that. the violence
 August 30
 which broke out throughout that country
 immediately independence was declared
 was too well organized and too well syn-
 chronized to have been accidental or
 spontaneous.  No precise arithmetical
 estimate may ever be available to us.
 However, I am convinced that in a coun-
 try like the Congo, 50 trained agitators,
 distributed at key posts, would be quite
 capable of turning over the entire coun-
 try to rape, mayhem, and chaos.
 In his remarks before the Veterans of
 Foreign Wars in Detroit last February 22,
 Mr. Allen W. Dulles, Director of the Cen-
 tral Intelligence Agency, made some pro-
 found observations. I shall quote a few
 paragraphs:
 Maybe many people in this country will
 be taught a new lesson in communism be-
 cause Khrushchev, right at our doorstep, is
 applying his methods and techniques.  He
 is  perverting  a  revolutionary movement
 which initially had the support of some
 estimable people but which now' is in the
 throes of a Communist takeover.  Cuba is
 not the only country, though it is the one
 nearest to us, where such a process is under-
 way.
 Are we alerted fully to this kind of danger,
 and are we prepared to do all that we can
 to see that this development does not occur
 in a dozen or more countries elsewhere in
 the world?
 This, today, Is the major element of the
 Soviet scheme for world domination.  We
 must understand it.  We must analyze it,
 and through a well coordinated program of
 education and of action, protect ourselves
 against it.
 Mr. President, in my judgment, the
 free world does not lack dedication. Of
 this I am utterly convinced.  Neverthe-
 less, so long as we have not developed
 the science of counteraction to the Com-
 munist conspiracy, so long as we do not
 have cold war professionals who have
 received intensive training in this sci-
 ence, just so long shall we remain help-
 less to cope with situations like those
 which exist in Cuba and the Congo.
 The purpose of the Freedom Academy,
 under the Freedom Commission, is to
 fill, or attempt to fill, this gap in our
 defenses.  By bringing together under
 one roof the best' brains we have in our
 country for this purpose we shall be
 creating the kind of research facilities
 which have made possible our nuclear
 development program and our space ex-
 ploration.  In those fields we brought
 together the best talent available and
 put them to work, we provided them
 with facilities and equipment with which
 to work, and they have been and are
 producing results that could never have
 been achieved without a concentration
 of brains and effort.
 At the same time as they engaged in
 the basic task of research, the Freedom
 Academy people would impart their
 knowledge and understanding to Amer-
 icans and to the nationals of other free
 countries who come to the Academy for
 special training.
 Mr. President, think how important
 that can be.
 We must never permit ourselves to
 become fatalists about Communist prog-
 ress.  If we ever become fatalists about
 Communist progress, we shall be lost.
 The Communists can be defeated. As I
 said on Friday, it is not enough to out-

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 SAS credit for`"i. na fide'rtopovers as being
 equal to 10 percent of their, third and fourth
 freedom traffic. This generous allowance re-
 sults In a i gure'24 "percent greater than the
 number of SAS 72-hour stopovers," SAS
 should also be allowed 30 percent of its total
 traffic for intermediate and transitir.Lg fifth
 freedom passengers,_ sag the ATA, "even
 though siich traffic of the U.8.-flag airlines
 on comparable transatlantic sectors probably
 comprises, less than b'percent of their total."
 This proposed SAS limitation, says Tipton,
 "is not intended to suggest that either 70
 or 90 percent is the correct figure for world-
 wide application.  There is no such magic
 figure.  We only say that these figures are
 reasonable for the sectors iind.er discussion
 here."   Tipton also points out that "It is
 extremely important to recognize the marked
 seasonal peaks and valleys  of the trans-
 Atlantic market, i.e., to have one set, of fig-
 ores and conclusions for the. on season
 and another for the off season."
 The importance of the United  States-
 'Scandinavian talks is emphasized by Tip-
 ton.  "From the airline standpoint, this is
 the first. capacity consultation undertaken
 'by our Government; the degree to which it
 Is successful is certain to influence the at-
 'titude of our Government officials toward
 the similar consultations which must be held
 in the near future with the other countries
 which. are also Major violators of the Ber-
 muda capacity  principles," he told CAB
 Chairman Whitney Gillilland last week.
 "It must be recognized that the Scan-
 dinavianswill use every Instrument of prop-
 aganda and po itical resistance at their com-
 mand.  As inthe.case of Dutcl} propaganda,
 the Scan,Ainavians are trying to strengthen
 their position by claiming publicly that the
 U.S.-flag airlines are seeking to drive them
 OR the, Atlantic.  We trust that the officials
 of our Government at all levels are convinced
 that the opposite is true.  Our carriers are
 not opposing the right of the Scandinavians
 to compete on equal terms for the traffic be-
 tween the Lfnited States 'and 4Candinavia.
 "It is the Scandinavians and other fifth
 freedom Operators with low wage costs who
 would be pleased to drive the high-wage cost
 U.S.-flag operators off the International air
 routes-or at least to bring about such a
 heavy burden of subsidy on the American
 taxpayers  as to weaken U.S.-flag efforts.
 Still worse, their continued assertion, of their
 demand to operate untrammeled by the Ber-
 muda capacity provisions simply puts the

 hem or "outspend them. We must
 outthink them and outmaneuver them,
 and this can be done with brains. It can
 only be done on "the intellectual level,
 and at no other`level. In my 3udgment,
 only in that way will the struggle against
 communism ever' be brought, to a suc
 cessful concigsion._
 Day after day, in this body and in the
 House, men and women of high intention
 have been: saying that this is a struggle
 for the hearts and minds of men.. In-
 deed, it is. 'but while wehave talked in
 theseterms, what have we actually done
 to win the.hearts and minds of men?
 I do not ' suggest that the Freedom
 Academy would be a cure-all. I offer it
 as one suggestion,' made by the distin-
 guished Senator from South Dakota
 IMr. MUNDT!and,the distinguished Cen-
 ator from tll riois TMr. t ouaLASI. They
 have proposed a plan,which is positive,
 bomething which should be tried. If this
 is a battle for the hearts and minds of
 I11en, let us get into the battle on that
 level.
 Let us start thinking, and let us get
 our best minds tlinking. _ -Let us place
 them in touch with each other. tet us
 provide them with a repository of the
 thinking of free people afl over the world.
 Let them exchange Ideas and. expose
 themselves to the thinking of others.
 Let tl?em analyzethis knowledge, put the
 bits and pieces together, and ' come up
 with a carefully thought-out plan of
 counteraction to the Communist con-
 spiracy.
 Already many battles have been won
 against the Communists.' I think we are
 inclined tq Overlook that fact,  Let us
 roinenlber the experience of the people in
 the Tabor unions of the Nation.  The
 great trade unions and great labor unions
 .have met the threat' of communism
 head on in their own organizations. In
 -instance after instance, labor has over-
 come communism. I cite that as a first-
 class example of the position that the
 battle against communism can be won.
 It has been done. It has been done by
 means' of brains, organization, and dedi-
 cation.
 The leaders of the American labor
 movement did noCoutspend the Commu-
 nists'            they did not outgun
 them. But they outthou ht them and
 outfought them. Today, the influence of
 communism In the ' labor unions is so
 small as to amount to very little.
 Mr. -President, that Is the kind of ef-
 fort we are talking about. That Is the
 kind of task in which we suggest a F`ree-
 dom Institute can help so much.
 Mr. MUNDT.  Mr. President, will the
 Senator yield?
 Mr. DODD.  l am happy to yield to
 the distinguished' Senator from South
 Dakota, who is a coauthor of the bill,
 d wlio has done so much to bring this
 atter beore,the Sente
 Mr, MUNDT.  I thank -the Senator
 from Connecticut,  I asked him to yield
 so that I might substantiate what he has
 said in his words of,commendation con-
 cernjing what has been done in the6'Amer-
 lean labor union movement to rid its
 which we are now speaking, and one of
 the great crusaders for such legislation,
 Is. Mr. Arthur G. McDowell, a prominent
 labor union official in the United States,
 who, in addition to holding a responsible
 position in the trade union movement,
 has been made secretary of the Coun-
 c 11 Against Communist Aggression.
 Arthur McDowell has been a real tower
 of strength in pushing the proposed leg-
 islation to the point where it is today,
 and where it appears we shall have an
 opportunity to vote upon it.
 Even though there remain only a
 few days-or perhaps only 1 day-in
 which the House can take action, I am
 confident that as a result of the type of
 support that has been generated from
 all over the Nation, in insisting that this
 Congress do something effective in this
 area, it will be possible for the Congress
 to act expeditiously, so this measure can
 be enacted into law at this session of
 Congress.
 Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator from
 South Dakota. I know of none who have
 done more or who are more intelligent
 in their attitude to the menace of com-
 munism than are our labor organiza-
 tions. In my opinion, they have been far
 ahead of any other segment of our society
 on this score.  The Senator from South
 Dakota is quite correct in what he says
 about Mr. McDowell; and I think we
 could easily name 100 or 200 other labor
 leaders who have been outstanding in
 this regard.
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio.  Mr. President,
 will the Senator from Connecticut yield
 to me?
 The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. BUR-
 rack In the chair).  Does the Senator
 from Connecticut yield to the Senator
 from Ohio?
 Mr. DODD. I am glad to yield.
 Mr, YOUNG of Ohio.  Let me say to
 the distinguished Senator from Connec-
 ticut, who is my personal friend, that I
 am puzzled about two aspects of the bill.
 Upon reading the report, I note that
 the bill proposes the creation of a Free-
 dom Commission which would establish
 a Freedom Academy, which would have
 the responsibility for training Ameri-
 cans, and selecting foreign students and
 training them, also, to better understand
 the nature of the international Commu-
 nist conspiracy and to develop effective
 methods of combating it.
 And the bill includes various provi-
 sions in regard to how the Commission
 and the Academy would function.
 In the report it is stated that the De-
 partment of Justice is wholly in accord
 with the view that it is most desirable
 to develop throughout the world greater
 awareness of the operations of Commu-
 nism and the methods of combating it.
 But there are two aspects of this pro-
 posal that are puzzling to me.  First I
 shall state them, and then I shall ask
 the Senator from Connecticut to com-
 ment on them.
 First of all, I wonder how it is that
 this proposal was not handled by the
 Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in-
 stead of by the Judiciary Committee.
 In addition, I 'note that the report
 states that'the Department of Justice is
 '17071
 unable to recommend enactment of this
 bill. In short, to be blunt about the mat-
 ter, it would seem that the Department
 of Justice is opposed to the bill.
 So I should like to have the Senator
 state his views on both of those points.
 Mr. DODD. Let me take them up one
 at a time, if I may.
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. Certainly.
 Mr. DODD.  As to the jurisdictional
 question, I do not know the complete
 answer.  I understand that the Pa iia-
 nientarlan-or                                                                                                   someone  other  than
 Senators, at any rate---handles the ref-
 erence of measures to the Senate com-
 mittees.                                                                                                 The Freedom Commission bill
 was referred to the Judiciary Committee
 in April 1959.
 We held hearings for 3 days, and
 heard approximately 20 or 30 wit-
 nesses-rather distinguished witnesses,
 I think it fair to say.  All of them fa-
 vored the proposal.  No one appeared
 in opposition to it.
 So with respect to the jurisdictional
 question, I can only say that the bill
 was referred to the Judiciary Commit-
 tee-and properly so, I suppose, because
 this  subject  concerns the  Judiciary
 Committee. As a matter of fact, I think
 it will concern many other Senate com-
 mittes.  Certainly, it will concern the
 Foreign Relations Committee.  I sup-
 pose it will concern the Committee on
 Labor and Public Welfare, and also the
 Appropriations Committee, and perhaps
 others.  Any undertaking of this kind
 will inevitably involve several of our
 committees, and I think it is good that
 this is so.
 Originally, It was proposed that a
 joint committee be established, and that
 it, in turn, supervise the establishment
 and  functioning  of  the  proposed
 Academy.
 Mr. MAGNUSON. Mr. President, will
 the Senator from Connecticut yield?
 Mr. DODD.` I yield.
 Mr. MAGNUSON.  Just now I was
 discussing the bill with the Senator
 from Arkansas [Mr. FULSRIGHT].  Let
 me ask whether printed copies of the
 hearings are available.
 Mr. DODD. Yes. I believe they have
 been distributed.
 Mr. MAGNUSON.  There is none on
 our desks.
 Mr. DODD.  I am afraid I do not
 know what the machinery for their dis-
 tribution is.
 Mr. President, in my answer to the
 question asked by the distinguished
 Senator from Ohio in regard to the mat-
 ter of jurisdiction, I mentioned the For-
 eign Relations Committee and also the
 Committee on Labor and Public Wet=
 fare.  Obviously, I should also mention
 the Committee on Government Opera-
 tions.                                                                                               My understanding is that the
 Foreign Relations Committee probably
 would also have a great deal to say about
 the. operations of the Commission and
 the Academy, once they became opera-
 tional. I assume, also, that the Foreign
 Relations Committee would wish to make
 recommendations; and I assume that
 after the operations got underway, it
 would make suggestions for their im-
 provement.

 That is, about. all I pan say in regard
 to the question of jurisdiction,.
 I am not an expert on the, subject of
 committee jurisdiction, and I do not
 know the .precise answer. But I do know
 that thisproposal seems to be a good
 one.  I have,no personal pride in the
 measure, for, unfortunately, I am not
 either the author or a coauthor of this
 Proposal.  It was authored by others.
 It was brought to my_attention only be-
 Cause of my .membership of the commit-
 tee, _ . I believe the Senate rules were not
 violated. when. the measure was referred
 for consideration to the Judiciary Com-
 mittee.
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio. As I read the
 bill and the report, I judged that the
 proposal deals completely and _ exten-
 sively With the foreign relations of our
 country. 86 ,1 wondered why the meas-
 ure was not handled by the Foreign Re-
 latiuns Committee. I _ thank. the, Senator
 for answering me on that point.  Evi-
 dently we are all somewhat puzzled that
 it should be handled, .by other commit-
 tees..
 Mr. DODD, I do not, agree it deals ex-
 elusively with matters within the juris-
 diction of that committee, I. think we
 have much to do to educate our, people
 oil this issue, and in a sense, I suppose,
 all these matters are foreign relations
 matters. So. ''much of what, we, do is so.
 We do not. live by ourselves at all.
 Mr. FULBRIGHT. If the Senator will
 ~ield,I would like to say for the RECORD
 that I believe the bill should have gone to
 the Foreign Relations Committee. It is
 primarily, I believe, intended to affect
 our foreign relations.  I think the De-
 partment of State should be permitted to
 testify upon it.
 "Would the Senator from Connecticut
 tell me Whether or not the Department
 of State appeared in connection with
 *is bill and expressed its support of it?
 :Mr. DODD. I do not see any record
 'f the Department of State as such. I
 do recall the names that appear in the
 list of the contents in_ the hearings are
 those of men who are well, informed on
 the subject. But Ido not see anyone
 m eciflcally representing the, State De-
 tment listed.
 - FULBRIgHT. It seen Mr,                       to me,
 under the Standing Rules of the Senate,
 ' which provide, among other things, that
 relations of the United States with for-
 eign nations generally are within the
 jurisdiction of the :Foreign ,.Relations
 Committee, that this bill is primarily in
 thatyf'ield.
 .I grant there are many bills which of
 feet various establishments of our activ-
 ities and are not exclusively in one or
 another field; but I think, on the general
 principles which applye to this question,
 that the one which , predominates has

 understanding of the struggle we are, in, The best answer I can give to that is
 of what, great moment is it that the, bill to quote very briefly from the testimony
 was sent to the judiciary Committee in-    of Mr. C. D. Jackson, whose name is cer-
 stead of to the Committee on Labor and                                                             tainly known to all of us.  He was a
 Public Welfare, or the Committee on

 tee on Foreign Relations?
 Is not the really important thing that
 we should get on with the business and
 get it started and get it underway? Then
 several other great committees of the
 Senate can bring all their interest to
 bear upon the program. They can keep
 an eye on it and they can have much to

 me to be the most important point.  I

 think I am resorting to a technicality.
 Mr. DODD.  Oh, no.
 Mr. YOUNG of Ohio.  But the fact is
 that I have been trying to obtain a copy
 of the hearings. I have a copy of the
 bill. ? I have a copy of the report.  How-
 ,ever, I have not as yet, after efforts late
 this afternoon and early evening, secured
 a copy of the hearings.
 If the Senator from Connecticut has
 a copy of the hearings, may I ask
 whether a representative from the De-
 partment of Justice' testified before the
 committee as I observe from the report?
 This statement carries great weight with
 'me, I may say to the Senator from
 Connecticut.  It states:
 'Accordingly, the Department of Justice is
 unable to recommendenactment of this bill.
 I construe that statement-to mean
 that, in reality, the' Department of
 Justice is opposed to the enactment of
 He added another sentence:
 It is only by uniting the study and teach-
 ing of these elements in one place and
 one time that the challenge can be fully
 comprehended and adequate responses gen-
 erated.
 That is the best answer, I think, to
 those who contend that the facilities are
 already available.  I think there are sev-
 eral places where one can learn some
 phase of the matter, but I do not know
 of a place where it can be learned whole.
 Mr. Jackson is an expert, and he ought
 to know better than I.
 As the Senator from Ohio knows, the
 committee in its report made a state-
 ment, after hearing all of the witnesses
 and reviewing the matter not summarily
 or hastily:
 No concentrated, systematic effort is be-
 lug made to develop an integrated, opera-

 MOUNT. A. PQ4TaITIcAL COU:ITEBSTRATF.GY AS
 M4SSiirE AS THE ENF..IVIY,'s
 Five years ago'T submitted a memorandum
 to the;White H9use sketching a program for
 a political offensive against world comrnu-?
 nism. "For Moscow," it said, "the real alter-.
 native to a nuclear showdown is not peace
 but political-psychological  warefare  of  a
 magnitude to weaken,, demoralize, chip away
 and ultimately take over what remains of
 the free world," The memorandum therefore
 urged that we renounce all delusions of easy
 solutions and compromises; that Instead we
 mount a political counterstrategy as massive,
 asintensive, and as clear about its ultimate
 goals as the strategy of the enemy himself.
 Events in the intervening years and in-
 tensified. Communist pressures today have, if
 anything, fortified this point of view.  The
 essence of my proposed program, for which ]:
 claim no originality, was-and still is-ann
 unequivocal decision to fight the so-called.
 cold war With 'a will and on a scale for com-
 plete victory.
 The decision would have .to be colnmuni-
 cated to the entire world.as boldly and ener-
 getically as the Communists communicate
 their intentionp.  Our message to human-.
 kind must be, that America has decided, irre
 vocably, to win the'cold war and thereby to
 cancel out the destructive power of Soviet-
 based communism. A national, commitmenj;
 of this scope, I submit, would be consistent
 with American instincts and experience, a,
 restatement of historic purposes In contem-
 porary terms.
 'The nature of those purposes has been.
 sufficiently defined by the editors in the in-
 troductory article to this series. It is explicit
 in basic American documents, beginning with.
 the Declaration of Independence, of which.
 Thomas Jefferson could say, "We are acting;
 for all mankind."
 It Is implicit in thee widespread asser-
 tion-presented by some as an accusation
 that our foreign policies have been "idealis-
 tic."  Through the generations Americans
 have always thought of themselves as being
 in the vanguard of freedom. They cherished
 the image of their country as the citadel of
 democracy and morality and a living defi-
 an0e to depotism anywhere.
 The Rockefeller Bros. Fund report on U.S.
 foreign policy-prepared by a panel of which
 'I was a member and published last year-
 put it this way: "The United States at its
 best has always seen its national life as an
 experiment  in  liberty * * ^ [Americans]

 were, in` some measure, bound up with their
 success.  *'0 s..  Whenever   [the   United
 States] has wielded effective power in the

 have played a vital part in its decisions.
 Whenever, on the contrary, the United States
 has tried to act without moral conviction,

 17.075
 In the debate on National Purpose we find
 at least one area of virtually unanimous
 agreement.  It Is that sheer survival, in the
 elementary physical sense, is not enough. A
 nation which thinks and acts exclusively for
 self-preservation cannot, in the present-day
 world preserve itself.  The posture, even if it
 were desired and desirable, has been turned
 into an anachronism by the surge of science
 and technology.  The world has become too
 small for physical, economic or political iso-
 lationism.  The polarization of forces duel-
 ing for supremacy has gone too far to permit
 the survival of an island of humanism in a
 sea of dehumanized totalitarianism.  No sin-
 gle nation can survive unless the civilization
 of which it is part survives.
 Our civilization, too, cannot remain iso-
 lated, confined to a delimited segment of the
 earth and indifferent to the humanity be-
 yond those limits.   The world cannot be
 frozen in its present patterns. In this period
 of great flux and of intermeshed revolutions,
 static, and passive arrangements are doomed
 to disruption.  If the area of freedom is not
 expanded, then assuredly it will continue to
 contract.
 Despite this, "survival of the free world"-
 side by side with an unfree world-has been
 and remains the maximum goal of Western
 diplomacy.  Not the weakening and eventual
 defeat of communism but a lasting accom-
 modation seems to mark the farthest reach
 of hope.  It is scarcely a vision to inspire
 confidence or zeal, and in any case it is
 utterly  utopian,  because  two  parties  are
 needed to make an accommodation.
 The best analysis of Communist strategy
 that I know is in a recent book called "Pro-
 tracted Conflict," by Dr. Robert Strausz-Hupe
 of the University of Pennsylvania and three
 associates.  The book's title is a phrase used
 by Mao Tse-tung.  The Communist plan, say
 the authors, is protracted in time and space
 and in the limitless variety of its techniques
 and weapons, and the weapons can even in-
 clude "the final and total knockout punch."
 Short of surrender, the authors see for our
 world no alternative but a many-sided, con=
 tinuous, long-range counteroffensive.
 Such a policy would reject all illusions of
 an enduring truce, let alone a negotiated di-
 vision of the globe.  The historic contest will
 be with us for a long, long time.  We may
 delay, maneuver, bargain and compromise,
 but it will be so much flailing of water unless
 all such moves become for us-as they have
 always been for the enemy-calculated hold-
 ing actions geared to long-range objectives,
 means not ends, tactics not strategy.
 RISKS  AND SACRIFICES CANNOT BE EVADED  BY
 PIECEMEAL SURRENDERS
 Whatever we do or fail to do in the years
 and decades ahead, we shall be forced to take
 great risks and make great sacrifices. These
 cannot be evaded even by piecemeal sur-
 renders.                                                                                                                     In fact, if Americans and other
 free peoples are to understand and accept
 these costs and exertions, there must be some
 rational relation between the magnitude of
 the goal and the magnitude of the burdens It
 imposes.
 This means that in,the conflict with com-
 munism we must become the dynamic chal-
 lenger rather than remain the inert target of
 challenge.  Only then can freedom regain
 the initiative.  Only then will we have a
 global goal to match that of communism,
 and the incentive to apply the full weight of
 our  brains, energies and resources to its
 achievement.  The great decision, once made
 and communicated to all concerned, will dic-
 tate its appropriate program of policy and
 action. The strategy will shape the necessary
 tactics.
 Even the things we are now doing and
 must continue, to do will become more rele-
 vant  and  more  effective when geared to
 a conscious ultimate goal. ' Military and
 economic aid to our allies, to underde-

 FAVOR OF THE SAFE, THE COMPROMISING?
 This is why expediency and appeasement,
 solutions that condemn other peoples to en-
 slavement, failure to react to international
 crimes, violate the deepest instincts of the
 American people.  Why is there such a per-
 vasive skepticism about our historic pur-
 poses and such a widespread search for sub-
 stitutes?    Why the shrinking from lofty
 goals for all mankind in favor of the safe,
 the compromising, or mere survival?
 The easy answer-that it is all due to the
 advent of terrible new weapons-will hardly
 do.  The calendar refutes it:  The retreat
 began before those weapons were forged and
 grew more panicky during the time when
 America had a monopoly on the atom bomb.
 It was precisely In the years before Soviet
 Russia produced the bomb that communism
 scored its greatest gains, and it did so almost
 always by the default of the free world.
 The Soviet advantages were not military and
 technological but political and psychological.
 The true answer, as I see it, is.related to
 the ever-rising costs of idealism in terms of
 the  sacrifices  and  the  hazards  involved.
 The trouble is not that the older purposes
 have become irrelevant but that they have
 become too relevant.    I mean that the time
 when America could serve passively as an
 example or inspiration to other nations has
 run out.  Today, professions of principle
 have serious consequences: they must be
 implemented in policy and action.  To say
 it in slang, the time has come to put up or
 shut up.
 As far as the contest with communism is
 concerned we had "shut up," quite literally.
 We had curbed our tongues for fear of of-
 fending the delicate sensibilities of those
 who daily offend us.  Few democratic lead-
 ers dare to speak as uninhibitedly about the
 coming doom of the Communist empire as
 Khrushchev and Mao Tse-tung regularly
 speak about our impending doom.  Our op-
 ponents defy, denounce and challenge, while
 we plead and propitiate.  We have left the
 vocabularly of confidence and victory to the
 other side, contenting ourselves with such
 solacing and temporizing words as accom-
 modations, modus vivendi, relaxed tensions
 and coexistence.
 This semantic timidity, of course, is merely
 a symptom and a minor one.  The all-encom-
 passing malady is a loss of nerve, marked by
 depleted self-esteem and purpose.   It has
 impelled us, whenever we have been faced
 with a choice of interpretations on some as-
 pect of the Communist affliction, to choose
 the more agreeable one, the one more con-
 ducive to complacency and less likely to tax
 our courage.  With  rare  exceptions  the
 choice has turned out to be the wrong and
 often the disastrous one, regardless of the
 political parties in power in this country
 and in the free world.
 Thus in the 1930's we eagerly found assur-
 ance in Stalin's talk about "socialism in one
 country." Later we relaxed in the cozy con-
 viction that the Chinese Communists were
 simply "agrarian reformers."  We prefer to
 believe in the "evolution" of communism,
 though there has not been the slightest revi-
 sion of ultimate Communist goals.  We seek
 a comforting answer to our prayers in ten-
 sions between Moscow and Peking, though
 these are strictly within the framework of
 their unshakable alliance against the West,
 no more significant than Anglo-American
 tension within our alliance.
 A familiar gambit is to list communism as
 just one item in a long inventory of prob-
 lems. But if the Sino-Soviet bloc wins world
 dominion, the other problems willcease
 to matter : they will have been solved for the
 free world in aboutthe way that death
 solves aif bodily ills.

 fitted to pass without our throwing the
 limelight ,on Red imperialism and ori the
 principles of 'self-determination.
 Thus the Communist world, rather than
 euri; would tend increasingly to become the
 principal battlefield of ideological and politi-
 cal conflict. The immunity their world has
 `so'long enjoyed would be shattered.
 A bill, to establish a Freedom Academy for
 ttaining ' cold-war specialists-what 'a Life
 editorial called a, political' West Point-is
 before t"o_ngress.  Whatever the merits or
 demerits of this, particular hill, it is 'in line
 port of many writers and editorial is
 and commentators. I hold in my hand
 a very recent endorsement published in
 the San Diego Union of Sunday, August
 21, 1960. It is entitled "The Anatomy.of
 Cold War." The subhead reads: "Only
 by knowing communism, its goals and
 tactics, can Americans avert conquest
 by infiltration."
 Does anyone dispute that? Does any-
 one believe that we can win these wars
 by not understanding communism, by
 not being trained in how communism
 operates and what it proposes to do?
 Can anyone here tonight point to any
 place in America where one can go to
 get that education, that training, and
 that background?
 Where can the young career officer
 go-for example, the agricultural atta-
 che who is heading for Pakistan? Where
 will he go to learn? Not'about agricul-
 ture; he knows that.  He has attended
 the State college. He has been an ex-
 tension agent. He knows about agricul-
 ture.  He goes to Pakistan as an agri-
 cultural attache because he is a soldier
 in the cold war. Where will he learn
 the major lesson? Where will he learn
 about communism? Where will he learn
 about what the Communists plan in that
 particular area of the world?  Where
 will he learn to fortify himself, equip
 himself, and train himself, so that he can
 be an effective leader in the cold war?
 It is not enough that he goes to Pakistan
 to teach something about agriculture.
 We squander pretty much the cost of
 sending people overseas until and unless
 they are fully trained to do the job. The
 bill provides that opportunity. That is
 why the proposed legislation has at-
 tracted bipartisan support and national
 acclaim from every walk of life.
 Americans feel that time is late al-
 ready to train people in government to
 do the job in the cold war that they are
 supposed to do.
 Someone will say, "Let us send it to
 another committee. Let it die. We will
 be back in another 4 months.  Then
 hearings can be held."
 That will be 6 months.  Then it can
 find a place on the calendar, and that
 will be 9 months.  How do we know
 Khrushchev will wait?  What will the
 Communists be doing in the meantime?
 How much longer can we delay becom-
 ing equipped to fight a war which is
 raging white hot now?  Every day we
 delay increases the danger. Every week
 we delay increases the cost.  Every
 month we delay increases the probability
 of a hot war, unless we successfully con-
 clude victories in the cold war.
 "The Anatomy of Cold War," pub-
 lished by objective writers in the San
 Diego Union, is a most persuasive argu-
 ment for the legislation which I hope
 the Senate will adopt with unanimity
 tonight.  It lists specifically the weak-
 nesses in our present approach. It bills
 persuasively the arguments for doing
 something effective to remove those
 weaknesses now.
 Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
 sent that the entire article be printed at

 with a commitment to victory. Various pro-
 posals have been made for setting up a
 liberation  force,  a volunteer  formation
 drawn largely from among refugees from
 captives nations and ready to serve in emer-
 gencies.  That, too, is in line with a strategy
 for victory. Official and private agencies of
 other kinds would be generated by focused
 strategic thinking in offensive rather than
 defensive terms.  And" a new department of
 Cabinet rank could and should be estab-
 lished to plan and coordinate all cold-war
 activities.
 WE WOULD  HAVE TO EMBRACE THE GRIM  BUT
 INSPIRING REALITIES OF OUR EPOCH
 Certainly this new approach would call
 for substantial sacrifices in material terms.
 But the notion that it would require a deep
 cut in American living standards under-
 estimates the wealth and productive genius
 of our country.  The more demanding sac-
 rifices, indeed, would be in the psychological
 and moral domains.  Our people, in short,
 would have to renounce complacency, eu-
 phoria, and illusion; they would have, to
 embrace the grim but inspiring realities of
 our epoch.
 The ultimate rise of a world order under
 law is dictated by the logic of devastating
 weaponry, the conquest of space, and modern
 communications.  What remains to be set-
 tled is whether it will be an order rooted in
 freedom or in universal tyranny.
 I do not doubt that we have what it takes
 to assure that it will be an order that we
 may cherish.  The Western concepts of open
 societies, of liberty under law, of govern-
 ment by the consent of the governed, of the
 supremacy of the Individual rather than the
 State-these are far closer to the natural
 aspirations of man than the anthill concepts
 of communism.  In any equal propaganda
 contest, what these Western concepts have
 brought in human well-being will become
 obvious and irresistible to the majority of
 mankind.
 In my 1955 memorandum to the White
 House I wrote: "Once that decision is made,
 some of the means for implementing it will
 become self-evident: others will be explored
 and developed under the impetus of a clear-
 cut goal.  Agreement on the problem must
 come before  agreement on the solution."
 But Abraham Lincoln said it better a cen-
 tury ago: "Determine that the thing can
 and shall be done, and then we shall find
 the way."
 Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, the pro-
 posed legislation would fill the most glar-
 ing gap in our whole cold war technique,
 and would provide a basis and the ma-
 chinery arid the manpower to train those
 who represent America abroad in the
 business that they are sent to do, effec-
 tively to promote America's interest in
 the cold war.
 We would not send a soldier to fight
 a battle ill prepared and untrained, with-
 out any concept of what his job was.
 Still, we send all over the world to rep-
 resent us people from the bureaus and
 agencies of various institutions of the
 Government who are skilled in their
 particular pursuits, but who have never
 had an opportunity to be trained in the
 machinations of communism, and what
 it actually means, and what they can
 expect as they find Communist opera-
 tives all over these areas of the world.
 We wonder why, In spite of our ex-
 penditures and our sacrifices, victories
 come all too infrequently for our side
 in the cold war.
 The proposed legislation has excited
 the Imagination and attracted the sup-

 way grdered to) a printed m the.R.ECORD,
 as follows:
 (Only by knowing communism, its goals
 and tactics, can Americans avert conquest
 by infiltration.)
 The cold war is more than A political
 phrase.  It's a reality, and potentially de-
 cisive skirinishesare being fought right now,
 today, this moment.  It's as close as a short
 jet run, measured in geographic terms. Cuba
 is only 90 miles from the United States.
 Since the admission of Alaska,, the Soviet
 Union itself is less than 50 miles from our
 own borders.  Open the  ole'by subsonic jet,
 Moscow is 7 hours to New York or Detroit.
 San Francisco is 30 minutes' missile time
 from Kamchatka Peninsula.  San Diego is 20
 minutes from a missile-bearing submarine
 800 miles at sea.
 But the important characteristic of the
 cold war is not the physical threat, great as
 that may be.
 What is important is that this war could
 be won without a single shot.  It could be
 won by encirclement-to the point where the
 United States is helpless.  It could be won
 by nibbling at our own strength and that
 of our allies-to the point where we and they
 are exhausted.  It could be won by the in-
 visible softening attack-to the point where
 an entire nation is brainwashed into believ-
 ing surrender is proper and regimentation is
 good.
 The maps on the first page [not printed
 in REcosD], and this have been prepared to
 emphasize the scope and significance  of
 Communist victories and inroads around the
 world in relation to our own land.. A cabinet
 shakeup in Africa, a general riot in any
 country along the Mediterranean, an up-
 swing In Communist activity  in Rio                     or
 Buenos Aires Is an alarm signal that Ameri-
 cans cannot ignore.
 But, again, the Communist threat, like
 disease, knows no international boundaries.
 Itean-and is intended to-take Its toll from
 within. "Withbi" means "within the United
 States as well as within our alliances."
 Three, facts are  vita{ to understanding
 Communist strategy. If you don't recognize
 them, much that happens in today's world
 will appear all but inexplicable.
 Fact No. 1 lathe nature of the Communist's
 prime target. It is not any geographical area.
 It is the human mind.  Communist dogma
 acknowledges that the only lasting conquest
 is the conquest of the human spirit.  If you
 conquer a man's spirit, you don't have to
 fight with him physically.
 Fact No. 2 is the nature of, the Communists'
 political tactics.  Perhaps of all the things
 about the gold war, this is the most difficult
 for the average American to realize, for most
 of us have been reared in a climate of Anglo-
 Saxon and },roman law, melded with Ameri
 can frontier and British Victorian cancepto
 of fairness, "playing the game."  The Com-
 munist does not achieve, his objectives by
 normal partisan politics. No Marxist believes
 in nor accepts open debate and free elections.
 When the Communist pays lipservice to
 democracy and "people's republics," he is in-
 dulging in an ironic twist of words.  Com-
 munist dogma has no abiding faith in the
 people.  It states repeatedly that a "prole-
 tarian" elite mpst make, decisions for, the
 people.  What Americans and western allies
 understand as,  n,~titutional and democratic
 processes are regarded by the Communist as
 u   alirxtyi , , .
 palism.is permuting a display purporting'
 'to be a popular choice only after the election,
 the-cabinet change, the court ruling has been.
 rigged. The Communist only bets on a sure
 tl}ing, and, his tactics are designed to bring
 that  sure  thing  about.  Method  doesn't
 matter.
 Fact No. 3 is the nature of Communist       However, it Is not new; it is not un-
 timing.                                                   The Communists are playing for              expected.  If there was any question,

 i1?r.   ATING.  Anyone who has at-
 tended ,an international conference. at
 which `representatives of'the Communist
 .countries are present understands the
 .point which the Senator from South
 Dakota is making. All ofthe representa-
 -fives of the Communist countries are ex-
 traordinarily well prepared to back, up
 the policies enunciated by theCoznmu-
 fist bloc.  T hey are all exceptionally
 The distinguished Senator from South
 Dakota rightly stresses the need forthor-
 ough training afid indoctrination on the
 part of those teachers who will instruct
 our young people as to the meaning of
 c.omzaunlsm, In ley Judgment 'it is very
 Important that this be taught to our
 young people in -addition to American
 history and other key subjects relevant
 to.the history and meaning of democracy.
 I do not think enough American history is
 presently being taught in our schools. I
 believe that in addition the meaning of
 communism should be taught in our
 schools.  This should be done by those
 .who know the subject well and have been
 properly instructed in it, rather than by
 persons who have taken It up as a side-
 line.
 I believe that by presenting this bill to
 us, the Senator from South Dakota has
 performed an important service.
 Mr, MUNDT. I thank the Senator
 from New York for his very profound,
 interesting,  and  effective  comments.
 Certainly. what he has said is borne out
 by everyone who has attended an in-
 ternational conference at which Com-
 munists have been present.                                                               The Com-
 munists send their best ;trained people
 there; and every one of them who at
 tends'such conferences, whether he be
 a smiling Mikoyan or a scowling Gro-
 myko, goes there knowing full well what
 he seeks to do. When the Russian farm-
 ers came to this country, I suspect that
 some of them had had experience on
 farms, but I feel sure that all of them
 had had thorough instruction in a train-
 ing school in the Lenin Institute, so that
 they knew the Communist line, the Com-
 munist propaganda approach, the Com-
 munist attack on Christianity, and the
 Communist  attack  upon  capitalism.
 They came here prepared, equipped, and
 ready to try to pick flaws in our system
 and to try to advance arguments in be-
 half of the system they represent.
 On the other hand, when Americans
 are sent to Ililssia, whom do we send?
 We send good Americans, but not one
 of them in a hundred is as well informed
 about communism as the most stupid
 emissary from Russia is informed about
 our way of life before he ever leaves his
 homeland.
 Mr. President, if one is unprepared,
 howcan he win in such a fight? With-
 out thorough preparation it is impossible
 to win a tennis match or a. baseball game
 or a fisticuffs match, or the contests at
 the Olympics which now are being held
 in `Rome.  One can do well only when
 lie is well equipped, understanding, and
 knowledgeable;  and  the  Communist
 countries take great pains to send such
 well-trained representatives to our coun-
 try to represent them.
 The,. pending measure provides for
 machinery of that kind-by calling for
 the establishment of a Freedom. Com-
 mission, which, in turn, will establish a
 Freedom Academy, where those who are
 presently in the service of our Govern-
 ,ment will be trained to represent us in
 the future.  They, will receive training
 in regard to the things they need to
 know in order to be ."able. to fight effec-
 tively in the cold war and to represent
 us well.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, at-
 er consultation with the distinguished
 minority le~ad~er, the Senator from ` fill
 nois [Mr. bIRKSENI, I 'send to'the desk"a
 proposed unanimous-consent agreement,
 and ask particularly that the Senator
 from South Dakota [Mr. MuNDTI, the
 Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dose],
 and the Senator from Arkansas [Mr.
 FULBRIGHT] listen to its reading.
 The  PRESIDING  OFFICER. The
 proposed agreement will be read.
 The, proposed agreement was read, as
 follows:
 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT
 Ordered,  That, effective on Wednesday,
 August 31, 1960, at the conclusion of routine
 morning business, during the further con-
 sideration of the bill (S. 1689) to create the
 Freedom Commission for the development of
 the science of counteraction to the world
 Communist conspiracy and for the training
 and development of leaders in a total politi-
 cal war, debate on any amendment, motion,
 - or appeal, 'except a motion  to lay on the
 table, shall be limited to one-half hour, to
 be equally divided and controlled by the
 mover of any such amendment or motion
 and the majority leader: Provided, That in
 the event the majority leader is in favor of
 any such amendment or motion, the time in
 opposition thereto shall be controlled by the
 minority leader or some Senator designated
 by him: Provided further, That no amend-
 ment that is not germane to the provisions
 of the said bill shall be received.
 Ordered further, That on the question of
 the final passage of the said-bill debate shall
 be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided
 and controlled, respectively, by the majority
 and minority leaders: Provided, That the
 said leaders, or either of them, may, from
 the time under their control on the, passage
 of the said bill, allot additional time to any
 Senator  during  the  consideration  of  any
 amendment, motion, or appeal.
 The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there
 objection to the proposed agreement?
 Mr. MUNDT. Mr. President, reserving
 the right to object-and let me say that
 I desire to ask some questions, for pur-
 poses of clarification-I wish to state,
 speaking as one Senator who is vitally
 interested in' this proposed legislation,
 that it is my purpose to cooperate in ev-
 ery possible way to expedite the prompt
 taking of action on the bill, and I am
 very hopeful that we can shorten the
 time allowed for its further considera-
 tion to such an extent-if that will be
 agreeable to the Senate-that we may be
 able to act on this measure tonight, so
 that If it is passed tonight by the Sen-
 ate-as I hope and as I believe it will
 be-the House will have that much ad-
 ditional time in which to act on the bill.
 That is important, because the House al-
 ready Is confronted with a crowded
 agenda.
 Mr. MANSFIELD. We could shorten
 the time limitation proposed, if that is
 desired. ]But in view of the fact that the
 American Bar Association is holding its
 annual meeting in this city, quite a num-
 ber of Senators are not in the Chamber
 at the moment. So we thought the pro-
 posed agreement, as read at the desk,
 would be one way to speed up the fur-
 ther consideration of the bill and the
 taking of action on it.
 Mr. MLJNDT. At what time. is It pro-
 posed that the Senate convene tomor-
 row?

 Near East that. goes far beyond the mat-
 ter of a quarrel between the Israelis and
 the Arabs in that part of the world.
 It is so explosive, and the power
 balance is so delicate, that an explosion
 of the kind we read of yesterday in
 Jordan may infect the rest of the world
 with its consequences.  It could even
 trigger the much larger explosion we all
 fear.  For that reason it is no longer
 simply a refugee question in an Isolated
 portion of the globe, but it is one which
 affects all the peoples of the world and
 concerns all governments.
 The question must now be approached
 as one of world-shaking proportions
 rather than one of dealing with unfortu-
 nate human beings in a narrow part of
 the world.
 Mr. GORE.  I agree with the Senator.
 Does the Senator share with me the feel-
 ing that this is a dangerous world tinder-
 box?
 Mr. McGEE.  It is dangerous beyond
 the control of the leaders of any one
 government in that area.  Whereas it
 was viewed as a personal quarrel, it in
 fact became much like the dropping of
 a pebble in the lake-the ripples kept
 spreading out further and further.  As
 a result, with the concern of the Soviet
 Union in. one part of that portion of the
 world and the concern of the non-Com-
 munist countries in the other part,
 there was a delicate balance which could
 be easily disturbed and fearfully dis-
 rupted, to the point of open warfare. of
 much greater magnitude than we have
 been witnessing between Israel and the
 Arabs.
 Mr. GORE.  I thank my friend.
 The Palestinian refugee question is,
 of course, but one of the many problems
 which plague the Middle East.  It is a
 question upon which the position of both
 sides is strongly influenced by emotions.
 To many, it operates as a psychological
 block to progress on all other issues. In
 my opinion, it represents the key with
 which the door to other solutions may be
 unlocked.  I am convinced that unless
 and until this, one of the great human
 tragedies of our time, is satisfactorily
 resolved, little progress can be made in
 bringing about political stability and
 improving economic conditions in the
 Middle East.
 Unless at least a beginning can be
 made at resolving the refugee problem,
 we can but anticipate a succession of in-
 cidents such as the recent occurrence in
 Jordan, increased unrest, the hurling of
 charge and countercharge, and the con-
 stant danger of the outbreak of armed
 hostilities.
 Mr. McGEE.  Mr. President, will my
 colleague again yield?
 Mr. GORE.  I gladly yield.
 Mr. McGEE.  Speaking for myself, I
 think I share the view with the Senator
 that the single most important impres-
 sion, next to the explosive capability of
 that situation, was how much a settle-
 ment in that part of the world depended
 upon the resolution of the refugee ques-
 tion.
 Mr. GORE.  Even an approach to a
 settlement.
 Mr. McGEE. One could not get the
 opposing factions to sit down to talk
 about water, about the Suez, or about
 many other difficult questions affecting
 boundary lines which concern them, be-
 cause there was a psychological block
 which stemmed from, the bitterness, the
 hatred, and the deterioration resulting
 from the entife refugee question.
 As the Senator has said so well, it was
 our opinion that unless and until the
 refugee issue could be removed, we
 could not approach rationally a useful
 discussion of the other questions.
 Mr. GORE.  I thank the Senator.  As
 the Senator will recall, it was only after
 long negotiation and persuasion that we
 obtained the assent of the two leaders to
 whom I have referred to negotiate with
 an intermediary on the refugee problem
 as separate and apart from the eco-
 nomic, the political, the geographic, and
 the many other questions which per-
 meate this troubled area.
 Mr. McGEE.  I think it was impres-
 sive that in these discussions to which
 the Senator referred, the political sensi-
 tivity on both sides on the question of
 the refugees was such that most of the
 leaders In those regions dared not ap-
 pear to be discussing the problem.  It
 was very delicate, because it had been
 brought home to them in the minds of
 the people on both sides.  The bias, the
 prejudice, the emotions were so deeply
 rooted that this problem has become
 what we might call a political hot
 potato.  Unless  the  blindness  which
 passions evoke can be eased, a useful
 negotiation on the other matters cannot
 be had, because, in my judgment, it will
 not focus upon the problem which, if
 solved, has the greatest chance to do
 the most good.  I refer, of course, to re-
 lieving the refugee pressure.
 Mr. GORE.       We have discussed this
 problem with many people, and we have
 seen it with our own eyes.
 I reached the conclusion, which I am
 sure the distinguished junior Senator
 from Wyoming shares, that if the human
 tragedy could be separated from the
 other problems and dealt with apart, if
 we could obtain an agreement to begin
 treating this as an identifiable separate
 problem, great progress could be made.
 When, separately, Premier Ben-Gurion
 and President Nasser acceded to our
 earnest entreaty in this regard, I felt
 greatly encouraged, and I know my col-
 league felt greatly encouraged.
 I do not know with what vigor these
 discussions were pursued by the State
 Department. As the able Senator knows,
 our discussions were reported to the State
 Department in detail.
 As the 86th Congress draws to a close,
 and particularly In view of the outbreak
 of violence in Jordan, I feel it incumbent
 upon me publicly to express my regret
 that the administration has not success-
 fully prosecuted a program of action de-
 signed to break the stalemate and to
 bring about a peaceful solution of politi-
 cal and economic controversy in this area
 which lies at the crossroads of the world.
 Mr. President, the stakes in the Middle
 East are high.  Nowhere is the challenge
 to freedom and democracy more acute.
 Nowhere are the demands on free world
 leadership more exacting.
 If the United States is to discharge its
 responsibilities for leadership, it must
 act in a manner commensurate with the
 task before it. Here is a task which de-
 mands to the fullest the prestige, the
 power, and the Influence of the office of
 the President of the United States. The
 settlement of the controversy in the Mid-
 dle East has not been, and cannot be,
 successfully accomplished by relegating
 it to the category of problems for the
 attention of officials at secondary levels
 of government.  A downgrading of the
 problem can but make its solution un-
 attainable,
 On August 27, in a message to the
 Zionist Organization of America, meet-
 ing in New York City,. Vice President
 NixoN stated:
 The time has come when we should try
 to bring about an overall settlement of the
 Palestine question in all its aspects.
 I do not argue the question that "the
 time has come."  In fact, the need for
 leadership and action has been with us
 throughout the years of the Eisenhower
 administration.
 I am genuinely concerned, Mr. Presi-
 dent, with the manner in which Vice
 President NixoN Proposes, If elected, to
 bring about the solution, the need for
 which he now recognizes as being acute.
 I quote from his message, as follows:
 For that reason, I intend if elected Presi-
 dent to give this problem the highest prior._
 ity by assigning primary responsibility for
 directing negotiations in this field to a man
 who has so magnificently demonstrated at
 the United Nations that he is one of the
 skilled diplomats of our times-my running
 mate, Henry Cabot Lodge.
 Now, it Is not my purpose today, Mr.
 President, to belittle or otherwise char-
 acterize the abilities of Mr. Lodge in the
 field of diplomacy. It Is to be noted that
 he has been an active participant in the
 formulation  and  Implementation  of
 Middle East policies which have proven
 singularly ineffective.  He is identified
 with policies which led us to the incon-
 gruous position of siding with the Soviet
 Union and against Great Britain, France,
 and Israel in the United Nations.  He
 is a part of a record characterized by
 reaction rather than action, by unsuc-
 cessful rather than successful policies.
 Now, Mr. Lodge's relative qualifica-
 tions for the office he seeks are an ap-
 propriate  subject  for  discussion.   I
 shall, however, reserve that subject for
 some other occasion.
 Of far greater importance than any
 question of Mr. Lodge's individual abil-
 ity as a diplomat is the announcement
 of Mr. NIXON, if elected, as to how he
 proposes to discharge the constitutional
 responsibilities of the Presidency in the
 conduct of U.S. foreign policy, especially,
 I should say, in the Middle East.
 Under the Constitution, there can be
 but one person upon whom rests the
 "primary responsibility" for U.S. foreign
 policy.  That person Is not the Vice
 President, but the President.  All the
 world so understands it.
 Mr. NixoN proposes, if elected, to turn
 over to his Vice President the "primary
 responsibility" for bringing about a so-
 lution  to  the  Palestinian  problem.
 Whether or not other problems such as
 that of Berlin and Germany would also
 be turned over to Mr. Lodge,'or to some-
 one else, is unclear.
