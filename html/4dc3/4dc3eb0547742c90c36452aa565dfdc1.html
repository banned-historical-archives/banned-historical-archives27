THE THEORY AND PRACTICE OF COMMUNISM IN 1971 
Part 1?A 
TUESDAY, MARCH 23, 1971 
U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, 
COMMITTEE ON INTERNAL SECURITY, 
Washington, D.C. 
PUBLIC HEARINGS 
The Committee on Internal Security met, pursuant to call, at 
10:05 a.m., in room 311, Cannon House Office Building, Washington, 
D.C., Hon. Richard H. Ichord, chairman, presiding. 
Committee members present: Representatives Richard H. Ichord 
of Missouri, Claude Pepper of Florida, Richardson Preyer of North 
Carolina, Robert F. Drinan of Massachusetts, John M. Ashbrook of 
Ohio, Roger H. Zion of Indiana, Fletcher Thompson of Georgia, and 
John G. Schmitz of California. 
Staff members present: Donald G. Sanders, chief counsel, and 
Richard L. Schultz, associate chief counsel. 
The CHAIRMAN. The committee will come to order. 
The committee last year held hearings during the 91st Congress for 
the purpose of updating its information on the theory of communism 
and also to gain insight relative to the functioning of communism in 
actual practice. 
In those hearings recent defectors from the Soviet Union, Cuba, 
and Czechoslovakia furnished testimony concerning life under com-
munist domination. They were followed by an academician's views 
concerning the current theoretical aspects of the international com-
munist movement. 
This morning the committee meets in the first of a series of hearings 
which we anticipate will extend over the next several days to continue 
the committee inquiry into the theory and practice of communism. 
We will hear testimony from witnesses from Asia, Europe, and the 
United States. I would direct that the resolution authorizing these 
hearings be placed in the record following my remarks. 
The Communist Party, U.S.A. (CPUSA), founded in 1919, just 
2 years after the Bolshevik revolution in Russia, has appealed to .a 
wide-rangin and diverse membership over the years. But its basic 
ideology, guided by the teachings of Marx and Lenin, appears to have 
never waivered. The CPUSA is an integral part of the international 
communist movement. It is a tightly knit and a highly disciplined 
group that has conducted an intensive propaganda campaign against 
the United States Government ever since it was founded.

Approved For Release 2002/01/22 : CIA-RDP73600296R000100080001-2

In these hearings we are particularly concerned with the need for 
updating information relative to the oversight responsibilities of the 
House Committee on Internal Security, as well as determining the 
necessity for any remedial legislation by Congress. Certainly we would 
be remiss if we confined our examination to reading an interpretation 
of the Daily World, Pravda, or other communist publications. Accord-
ingly, we seek firsthand information about the experiences of people 
who by choice have succeeded in casting off the shackles of communist 
domination and, at the risk of losing their lives as well as their property, 
have gone to extreme lengths in search of freedom. 
In addition to the testimony of these individuals, we will also 
receive the testimony of academicians knowledgeable in Marxist-
Leninist-Maoist doctrines, both in relation to the CPIJSA and to the 
common goal in statements sought by the international communist 
movement. - 
Our witnesses today and through next week will include recent 
defectors from Red China and East Berlin, who will present testimony 
describing life under communist rule. We will also receive testimony 
again from prominent academicians concerning the theoretical aspects 
of Marxism-Leninism as interpreted by Mao Tse-tung and the satellite 
countries of Eastern Europe. 
In addition? the committee will hear witnesses who have been in 
recent attendance at the Center for Marxist Education in New York, 
and thus we may be able to gain a penetrating and current view of the 
activities and teachings of the CPUSA within our own country. 
I direct at this time that the resolution authorizing these hearings 
be included in the record. 
(The resolution referred to follows:) 
RESOLVED, That the Committee on Internal Security, or any subcommittee 
thereof appointed for such purpose, conduct investigation and hearings, at such 
time and places as the Chairman may determine, to receive testimony and evidence 
illustrative of the Communist ideology, RS character and objectives, as applied by 
Communist organizations, their agents, members, and affiliates. 
The CHAIRMAN. Whom do you have as your first witness, Mr. 
Counsel? 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Professor Richard K. Diao Mr. Chairman. 
The CHAIRMAN. Prior to the swearing of 7..\r. Dian, may I make two 
announcements. 
First, we are very happy to have with us today, as guests of the 
Chair, 22 young journalists representing high school newspapers in 
the District of Columbia area. I personally have invited the buddino-
young journalists, and the staff has been instructed to admit them with 
the proper press credentials. 
The second announcement concerns action of the committee upon. 
the bills, both to repeal and amend title II, the so-called Detention 
Act of the Internal Security Act of 1950. As I announced some 2 
weeks ago, all of the transcripts have been furnished the committee. 
I do not think it would be necessary for the committee to hear testi-
mony on these bills again. We heard some 30 or 40 witnesses last 
year, some 1,000 pages of testimony. I hope that the committee will 
be able to act upon these bills without the necessity of further hearings. 
A bill was reported to the Rules Committee (luring the last session, 
but not in thne to be acted upon by the Congress. So the Chair has

provided the members with notice of the meeting tomorrow at 9 
o'clock, prior to continuation of these hearings, for the purpose of 
taking action upon such legislation. 
Mr. Diao, would you first rise and be sworn, please? 
Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give 
before this committee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing 
but the truth, so help you God? 
Mr. DIAO. I do. 
The CHAIRMAN. Please be seated. It is a pleasure to welcome you 
to the committee. 
You may proceed, Mr. Counsel. 
TESTIMONY OF RICHARD K. DIAO 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Diao has prepared a narrative 
statement which I would like to offer for inclusion in the record. 
I would like permission for Professor Diao to proceed at his own 
pace in a summary opening statement. 
The CHAIRMAN. Proceed. And, Mr. Diao, would you lean into the 
mike, please, so that we will be certain to hear you up here? 
(Mr. Diao's prepared statement follows:) 
STATEMENT OF PROFESSOR RICHARD K. DIA? 
My name is Richard K. Diao. I was born April 29, 1924, in Chengtu, China: 
I graduated from the National Central University, Department of Economics, 
in Chungking, China, in 1946, with a B.A. degree. In 1947 I came to the United 
States, and attended the University of Illinois, Department of Economics, Grad-
uate School, at Urbana, Illinois. I graduated in 1948 with a Master's degree. In 
1948-1949 I attended the Columbia University in New York City. From 1949-
1950 I attended the Graduate School of Business Administration of New York 
University, New York City, as a candidate for a Ph. D. I did not complete my 
studies for my Ph. D. and returned to China in 1950, prompted by glowing reports 
of prosperity and opportunity in my native country. I was accompanied by my 
fiancee, Eva Hsu, born August 5, 1927, in Shanghai, China. She had been attending 
Mary Crest College in Davenport, Iowa. We were engaged in New York City 
on June 16, 1950 and married in Peking on December 16, 1950. We have a daughter 
18, and a son, 14. 
From 1950 until 1951 I worked at the Ministry of Finance in Peking, China, 
as a researcher. From 1951 to 1952 I was a researcher for the Government Ad-
ministrative Council's Committee on Financial and Economic Affairs in Peking. 
From 1952 to 1953 I was Associate Professor of Public Finance at the Central 
Institute of Finance and Economics, Peking, China. From 1953 to 1958 I was 
Associate Professor and Deputy Head of Teaching and Research in the Depart-
ment of Finance at the Central Academy for Financial Cadres in Peking. In 
1957, during the program known as the "Hundred Flower Movement", the Party 
encouraged criticism by non-Party members. They promised that no punishment 
would be given to those who criticized the Party and the government, but that 
this would be used to improve their work. However, after I criticized the Party I 
was subjected to considerable harassment, I was labeled a "rightist" and enemy 
of the State. I was accused of being a U.S. spy, since the State Department had 
paid for my transportation back to China through the ECA fund then available 
to all Chinese students in this country after the communist take over of mainland 
China. In the meantime, my three brothers, two sisters and parents were all still 
living in the United States. My father' a retired Lt. General of the Republic of 
China, has since died in New York, in 1956. 
In April of 1958 I was sent to the Military 850th State Farm at Heilungkiang 
as a laborer to undergo thought reform. This camp was located in what is called 
the "Chinese Siberia" in the remote northeastern part of the country. It was only 
20 miles from where the Sino-Soviet border incident occurred in 1969. I stayed 
in this camp for two years and ten months. I feel that the treatment at this camp 
was more inhuman than what I had heard of the concentration camps of the Nazis.

We worked at hard labor 14-16 hours per day, 7 days a week with very little food 
in bitter cold. At one time they worked us 10 days and nights with only a one 
hour nap in the snow covered and frozen ground after midnight. We built rail-
roads, roads, dams, but mostly we dug and built drainage canals. Most of this 
area is very swampy. Many people at the camp died from exhaustion and mal-
nutrition. 
In addition to landlords and rich peasants, there are three types of persons 
designated as anti-government in China; 1) counter-revolutionaries; 2) rightists; 
3) bad elements. There were some in each category in this camp. Due to the poor 
condition of the persons in the camp, we were finally released in December 1960 
and returned to Peking where I remained about one month. 
At the end of 1960, I was then sent to Shansi province in China to the Shansi 
College of Finance and Economics. At the college my job was to prepare lectures 
for others to give since I no longer could be trusted to deliver lectures, but most, 
of the time I was still assigned to do manual work in the countryside, which in-
cluded the cleaning of public toilets. In addition, I had to report each week 
without failure about my thought and deeds to a Party member who was as-
signed to "help" me and also to submit, through this man, a written report to 
the Party Committee every month. At this time, my wife who had worked at 
the Ministry of Public Health in Peking for some 10 years was also transferred 
to Shansi province to teach at a medical college. We began to plan how we could 
escape from China. Writing to one of my brothers in New York giving him a 
hint that we wished to come out, it was hoped that he would write me a letter 
claiming that my mother had come to Hong Kong hoping to see us once more 
before she died. Using this as a ruse and with a good record of hard work after 
I got out of the Labor camp, they finally let me and my son go to Hong Kong. 
I made up my mind that once there I would never return to China. For almost 
two years my wife attempted to get an exit permit and finally on the pretext of 
talking me into returning to China or at least to bring my son back to China, 
she was permitted to bring my daughter with her to visit me in Hong Kong. 
After our reunion I joined Union Research Institute in Hong Kong as a Senior 
Researcher and Head of Research Department in Finance and Economics. My 
wife also obtained a position as a Mandarine Chinese teacher in the New Asia 
Yale-in-China Language Center of the Chinese University of Hong Kong. Through 
much legal maneuvering and the help of many friends, we were finally able to 
come to the United States and arrived in New York on the 23rd of October, 1966. 
From 1966 until 1969 I was a Research Associate with the East Asian Institute, 
Columbia University, New York City. 
While in Peking I found that many of the persons with whom I had associated 
in the United States prior to my return to China were in reality communists. 
Looking back, I suppose that in those days I was very much pro-New China. 
I have never joined the Communist Party and after seeing China as it is I know 
I never shall. 
My main reasons for leaving China were the knowledge that the Socialist system 
will never work in China or anywhere else. There was a constant fear of being 
arrested for something. Each knock on the door, each visit to a superior, especially 
during the political movements held the threat of being detained for something. 
I never knew when I went to work in the morning if I would come home that night. 
There is absolutely no freedom of thought and absolutely no consideration of an 
individual as a human being. 
In discussing the economy of China prior to the Great Leap Forward, the situa-
tion in China was quite good. People had enough to eat, but during 1959-1961 the 
situation was terrible. People had barely enough to eat. Everything was rationed 
according to categories. The highest category was the Army and heavy labor. 
Ordinary people received 15 kilograms of grain and 2 oz. of edible oil per month. 
Meat or fish was rationed to a few oz. once every several months. While I had had 
no experience under the Japanese occupation of China, persons that I have known 
say that things were much worse during this time in China than it was under the 
Japanese control. People hoarded their food and feared that others would steal it. 
The fixed prices were not very high but there was just no food available. Clothes 
also were very difficult to obtain. Each person was rationed to a few yards of cloth 
per year. If you bought socks or handkerchiefs you had to surrender a certain 
amount of cloth ration tickets. This applied to Communist Party members as 
well as those who were not Party members. Soldiers were given the best ration. 
Their rations on clothes and for food were the highest together with the highest 
officers in the Party and Government. Before 1958 things were much better. At

that time the so-called higher intellectuals, which included myself, received more 
meat and rice and we also had the privilege of not standing in line to do our 
shopping. We had a card which allowed us to go to the front of the line each time. 
This was only from 1956 until 1958. During the bad years the higher intellectuals 
did receive more cigarettes and more oil than other people, but by that time I 
had been branded as a "rightist" and I did not receive this. 
From the latter half of 1962 on, things began to get better. At that time you 
could buy extra food on the "free market". Some of the peasants in the country 
had extra vegetables or eggs or food grains and could bring it to the "free market" 
in the city where they would sell it. Prices here to be determined simply by supply 
and demand were extremely high but while the "free market" was officially 
illegal, the Party and Government turned their back on these transactions. At 
that time the Party had lost some control over the people. Later on, I understand 
the "free market" was closed down. I believe that the countryside was worse off 
in the bad days than the cities. Peking and Shanghai were show places and were 
always somewhat better than the rest of the country. Many persons died of mal-
nutrition. Frequently they would become so ill and so weak that the slightest 
cold or illness would kill them. 
In China everyone must work. When we first returned to China from the United 
States we were given our choice of work, the area where we thought we could do 
the most. However, once we selected a job we were not allowed to change unless 
the Party decided to transfer us. Most of the rest of the people are assigned by the 
Party to the job where they are needed. You can request a transfer to another 
job but very seldom are these requests granted. At this time you are also subject 
to criticism because they would ask you why you questioned the wisdom of the 
Party in assigning you a job. Generally speaking they put you in a job where they 
need you. If you decided that you did not want to work or would not work, then 
you have two choices; 1) you can die without food; 2) you are subject to arrest 
as a bad element for not contributing your part to the state. The crime of being 
a counter-revolutionist covers nearly everything in China, from being a thief, to 
not working or engaging in financial transactions not authorized by the authorities. 
During 1959-1961 things were very bad. Many people resorted to stealing?not 
money but food. You could buy nothing with money, but food coupons and 
clothes were stolen very frequently. China has since imported substantial amounts 
of wheat every year from Australia, New Zealand and Canada and still continues 
to do so. During the bad years, the Party and Government encouraged people 
who had friends outside of China to ask for food packages. I had a sister-in-law, 
for example, in Hong Kong, who sent me packages. I received butter, milk, choco-
late, etc., which enabled me to effect a speedy recovery from my poor condition 
resulting from the Labor camp. 
To take care of discipline in the country, I believe there is a large network of 
Labor Camps throughout mainland China. Most of these are in the northeast 
and northwest. The land where I was in the remote northeast had never been 
farmed and there was almost no population living there except the demobilized 
soldiers from the Korean War. The land is very fertile but it is mostly swamp. 
The soil was black and rich and it did not need to be fertilized, but it was mostly 
covered with water. We dug and built drainage ditches but the water would still 
come back. There were many Russian built tractors there but they just stood 
idle most of the time as they could not be used in that mud. The growing season 
was only 120 days long and the rest of the time it is bitter cold. The coldest 
weather is in the forties or even fifties below zero. 
Since 1950 all of the large land holdings of the landlords were taken away and 
distributed to the poor peasants. The land was not owned by the peasants but 
they were told that they would be able to use it. The state retained ownership. 
After 1953, and especially after 1956, the Agricultural Cooperative Movement 
assumed close control of the land. During the hardship years around 1959 very 
small pieces of land next to the houses which had been seized by the Peoples 
Communes during the Great Leap Forward were given back to the peasants to 
raise vegetables, for their own use or to enable them to sell it in the "free market". 
I understand that during the recent Cultural Revolution that all these private 
plots were again taken back by the communes. As far as owning homes, it was a 
very difficult situation. Before 1958 some people did own their own. After that 
they were all taken by the state. They were reimbursed by the state only in the 
form of so-called "fixed interest" which was calculated at a price decided upon by 
the state. When you owned your own house you were required to keep it repaired 
and the Government assigned you tenants if they thought that you had too

6 
much room. People were so hard pressed to keep up the taxes and repairs that 
they were glad to give the houses to the state in order to be rid of the troubles. 
Generally speaking, each family is allowed one or two rooms, though it depends 
upon their size and the interpretation of the authorities in the area in which 
you were living. Sometimes you had a community kitchen and sometimes you 
had a stove outside the house and you did your cooking outside. Bathrooms are 
always communal. 
When I was Associate Professor at the Central Academy For Financial Cadres 
in Peking I had a quite nice apartment with two rooms, plus kitchen and bathroom. 
We used one room for our bedroom and the other for the children and as a living 
room. I even had a maid. At that time this was alright with the Party and Gov-
ernment as it cut down on unemployment in the countryside and enabled both 
husband and wife to work. Later this practice was considered a bourgeois, capitalist 
practice. The maids were all forced to resign and work in street factories or on 
farms in the countryside. This is one of the big problems with the Chinese Govern-
ment, it keeps changing from year to year, no one ever knows what is right. What 
is right one year is bad the next. They are always changing. 
There is almost no religion in China anymore except among the older people. 
It makes no difference which religion is involved, whether it is Christian, Buddhist 
or what. It is all bad as far as the Party is concerned. Of all the religions, I believe 
the Catholic was persecuted the most because the Party and Government felt 
they had closer ties to the West. All members of the Communist Party are not 
allowed to have any religion. The younger persons are discouraged from having 
any religion as well. Most of the churches and temples have been converted to 
schools, hospitals, or warehouses. Only in the big cities like Peking and Shanghai 
are a few churches and temples still operating as a sort of window dressing for 
foreign visitors. When the Premier of Ceylon visited China some years ago, for 
example, the Mayor of Shanghai and the protocol officials from Peking went to 
the temple with her for worship but this was only a propaganda move. 
Everyone who has reached the age of 18 years may vote in China if they are 
not a convicted criminal. If you don't vote they question you as to the reasons. 
To vote you go to the voting place and pick up your ballot. You go into a voting 
booth, mark the ballot, and drop it in the ballot box. All the nominees have been 
screened by the Party and match exactly the number of posts to be filled and thus 
all are elected. You just don't have any choice. To avoid trouble, people just vote 
for the candidates listed. In China there are 8 so-called "democratic parties" 
besides the Communist Party but all take their guidance from Chairman Mao and 
the Communist Party. Having this many parties helps to present a picture of 
democratic government to the peoples of the world. It is not possible for one of 
these parties to become stronger than the Communist Party. There is no compe-
tition between them and the Communist Party. If any party begins to gather any 
strength and to challenge the Communist Party all the other parties are directed 
to move against it. There is one thing I might mention, concerning voting. Since 
China still has many illiterate persons the voting place has someone to read the 
ballot to you so that you can mark it. This means that it is possible that this 
individual does the voting, and the voter is never aware of whom he voted for. 
There are no campaigns for elections such as there are in the United States. There 
are meetings where the Party will tell you about the candidates. In China the 
people are so naive and so interested in avoiding any trouble that they do as they 
are told. 
In China, as in all the rest of the Communist countries, there are labor unions. 
Back before the Communists seized power they controlled the labor unions and 
struck against the Nationalist Government. After the Communists took over the 
situation was changed. Now there are no strikes. The union speaks to the worker 
for the state. In Western countries the union speaks to the management for the 
workers. The function in China is to see that the workers work and that their 
welfare is provided for. They arrange vacations and pensions. They arrange for 
labor heroes and give political incentive for more work. They act as agents of 
the Party in all the factories and their main function is to give the workers 
ideological indoctrination. 
As far as schooling in China goes, you can go or not as you wish. There are not 
enough schools in the country if everyone had to go to school. Most of the city 
dwellers send their children to school but in the countryside most of the children 
must work. If you want to go to school you can. If you don't want to go you don't 
have to. School is free. There is no charge for tuition, books, or supplies. At the 
university the students have two kinds of scholarships, known as Peoples' Scholar-
ships or Aid Type A and Type B. Type A is a basic scholarship. When you are 
Approved For Release 2002/01/22 : CIA-RDP73600296R000100080001-2 
Approved For Release 2002/01/22 : CIA-RDP73600296R000100080001-2 
7 
accepted at the university it provides some money to cover food and clothes. Type 
B provides more money. This is for the poorer families. In all universities- all 
students live on campus because of the many extracurricular activities in which 
they must engage. This is also a way the Party has of separating them from the 
influence of their families and the rest of the population. A student can go to 
college or university for four years to study, liberal arts or social sciences, 5 years 
for engineering or applied sciences and 8 years for medicine. The Government pays 
for all of this. in China there is no degree offered. 
In China children under 16 usually belong to the Young Pioneers and then 
from 16 to 25 many of them belong to the Communist Youth League. Being a 
member of the Communist Youth League does not necessarily make you a member 
of the Communist Party, but you have a better chance to join if you are a member 
of the Communist Youth League. The Young Pioneers, on the other hand, are 
somewhat like Boy Scouts and attract children by interesting programs along the 
Party defined lines. All children from the very young of kindergarten are taught 
that "no matter how good your parents are they are not as good as Chairman 
Mao," and that they should prepare themselves to become good communists. 
If you wish to travel, from one area in China to another, you must have per-
mission. Each individual has an identity card issued by his employing agency or 
his school or his factory. You must check out at wherever you work and then 
you must check in with the police at your destination. If you are a farmer you 
must obtain a pass from your brigade or commune. This is for travel inside 
China. Travel outside of China is always discouraged and is hence very difficult 
to arrange. 
In China we were never allowed to contact foreigners directly. Even if you 
speak their language you must use an official interpreter. This applies to every 
foreigner and especially to those from the West. It applied to contact with the 
Russians too but of course not many Chinese people speak Russian, though at 
one time everyone was encouraged to study Russian at school or through radio. 
It was very fashionable to study Russian in the 1950s. 
After the Sino-Soviet split-up in 19.59 they no longer wanted people to learn 
Russian. Now, I have heard that a person cannot take Russian at all. Any 
foreigner visiting China today is prepared for in advance. Everyone who will have 
contact with him is provided with a paper giving the foreigner's background, 
political feelings, and the questions that he might ask, and what the answers 
should be. Some foreigners realize that the information they are receiving is all 
planted propaganda and try to evade their interpreters and guides. This is not 
really possible because in the area of the hotels used by the foreigners, all the taxi 
drivers and shop keepers are part of the show. Also the people don't dare to speak 
up, because the foreigners soon leave and then the Party looks at you as an enemy 
of the state. All foreign embassies have a guard who acts to protect the embassy 
and also to keep people from visiting the embassy. If an embassy wants to hire a 
Chinese as a cook or a driver or a clerk or something, the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs will take care of placing the individual. This enables them to carefully - 
select someone to do their bidding. 
There is very little anti-semitisin in China because there are almost no Jews. 
At one time back before the Communists came into power, there were a number 
of Jews in some of the large cities as merchants but they are all gone now. 
If you are arrested in China and brought to trial, you will be given a Government 
appointed defense lawyer. This presents problems for a defense counsel. First, 
they often arrest people without any basis, almost anyone can be arrested for 
anything. It can conic at any time. They can just confine you to your office until 
you write down your confession. If you don't know what to confess to they will 
tell you. They use three shifts for interrogation-8 hours each?while you sit 
there until you confess to something. The defense counsel usually advises his 
client to confess. He cannot justify any crime you may have committed against 
the state, therefore there is no real defense. If he did try to defend an accused he 
would probably be the next one on trial himself. These trials are really public 
shows. They usc the trial to demonstrate to others what happens to enemies of 
the state so in effect it acts as a control method. It is not really a trial as we know 
it here but a show of public punishment. The prosecution is not even required to 
furnish any proof that a crime has been committed. Of course, many of the arrests 
are not brought to trial at all. The offender is punished with no public hearing. 
I have been asked often whether China has a secret police. Yes, they do. They 
call it Public Security. It is similar to the Soviet Secret Police. From my observa-
tions, however, in China the power of the secret police is not as great as in Russia. 
In China, especially today, the Army is the most powerful of all of the branches 
Approved For Release 2002/01/22: CIA-RDP73600296R000100080001-2 
Approved For Release 2002/01/22 : CIA-RDP73600296R000100080001-2 
8 
of the hierarchy. I think the Army also has a Secret Police of its own. In China 
so many people are informers for the authorities of one sort or another even 
though they are not directly linked with the secret police that there is a saying 
that if you don't need an answer, don't ask a question and never trust anybody 
even your own kin. It is hard to tell who is a Secret Police source. As a result you 
never ask your friends any questions. You comment on the weather and that's 
about all. 
According to the Chinese constitution they say that they have almost every 
right that people have here in the United States, but they don't exist. There are 
no rights. The only rights are those of the Party to rule in any manner that they 
see fit. 
Mr. DrAo. Since I have prepared a written statement, there is no 
need to go over it again. I would like to brief a few points. 
I was born and grew up in Yunnan Province, China. I came to this 
country in 1947 as a graduate student. I earned, in 1948, a master's 
degree from the University of Illinois and then I transferred to 
Columbia University and New York University as a candidate for 
Ph. D., but. I did riot finish. Rather, I returned to China. 
I met my wife in Chicago when we attended a meeting sponsored 
by the Chinese Student Christian Association, and were engaged in 
New York City in June 1950 and married in Peking in December 1950 
after we returned there. We have a daughter 18 and a son 14. 
This decision to return to China was prompted by communist 
propaganda, especially that of the communistic government, and a 
new government crisis. We hoped that we could contribute ourselves 
to the construction of our country. However, after return, we gradually 
discovered that the real situation was very disappointing and we 
realized that communism is nothing but a dictatorship which rules 
over people to satisfy the dictator's ambitions. 
(At this point Mr. Thompson entered the hearing room.) 
Mr. DIAO. At first we were treated quite well because the com-
munists were in great need of educated people. I was given a job in 
the Ministry of Finance in Peking, and then the Committee on Finance 
and Economic Affairs of the Government Administration Council. 
But due to my family and educational background and also my rela-
tives abroad, I was regarded not suitable for a highly sensitive position 
in the Government. So I was transferred to teach at college. 
There were numerous political movements, one after one, but I was 
not attacked until 1957, when the so-called "Hundred Flowers Move-
ment" started. The communist party encouraged people, especially 
intellectuals outside the communist party, to criticize the party and 
the Government, and they promised there would be no punishment. 
So I (lid. But I was branded as a bourgeois. That means the enemy of 
the state. So, after numerous strike meetings and harassment, I was 
sent to a labor camp in a remote part of the country near the Sino-
Soviet border. 
I stayed in this camp for 2 years and 10 months. I feel that the 
treatment at this camp was more inhuman than what I had heard 
of the concentration camps of the Nazis. The work hours were ex-
tremely long, averaging 14 to 16 hours per day, 7 days a week, with 
very little food, and in the bitter cold weather. 
Almost everybody was sick, and I saw many of my fellow victims 
die. And I myself fell to the ground twice, but I was to survive. 
In December 1960, we all were released from the camp. I was 
transferred to Shansi Province to a college there. Although my job 
was teaching, I was not allowed to give lectures to students. Rather, 
Approved For Release 2002/01/22 : CIA-RDP73600296R000100080001-2 
Approved For Release 2002/01/22 :9CIA-RDP731300296R000100080001-2 
I was asked to prepare lectures for others to give. Most of the time I 
was still assigned to manual work in the countryside. In addition, 
I had to report each week about my thoughts and deeds to a party 
member who was assigned to help me, and also to submit a written 
report to the party committee every month. 
At this time my wife, who had worked at the Ministry of Public 
Health in Peking for some 10 years, was also transferred to Shansi 
Province. So at this time we began to plan how we could escape from 
China. With the help of my relatives?that means my brother in the 
States and also my sister in Hong Kong?we made up a story that 
my mother had come to Hong Kong hopin_g to see us. So it took about 
4 months to get the permission to go to Hong Kong, but I was sup-
posed to return to China by the end of the year. 
So when the time was up, I excused myself from not returning to 
China on the grounds of sickness and that I was supposed to have a 
major operation on cancer. I asked my wife to come to Hong Kong 
to take care of me, but at this time the communist authorities refused 
to grant my wife permission. Instead, they asked me to go back. She 
begged the authorities almost every day with tears and finally she 
got a permission to go to Hong Kong to visit me on the pretext to 
talk me into going back to China. 
After she got out, I started to work in a research institute in Hong 
Kong and also she taught in the Center of the Chinese University of 
Hong Kong. We stayed in Hong Kong almost 4 years and finally we 
got permission from the State Department to return to the States. 
We arrived in New York on 23d of October 1966. From then until 
1969 I was a research associate at the East Asian Institute, Columbia 
University. 
Our main reason for leaving China was to seek freedom because, 
from our experience, we realized the socialist-communist system would 
never work in China or anywhere else. 
Mr. ScHuurz. Professor Diao, were you a member of the commu-
nist party? 
MT. DIAO. No, I was not. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. I am wondering, now you have just told us that you 
left the United States to return to China after you had obtained a 
master's degree, and they welcomed you with open arms at first. And 
subsequently you complied with their Hundred Flowers program 
i 
which was, n effect, requesting criticism of the Government. May 
I ask you, what criticism did you make? 
Mr. DIAO. I made my criticism on several occasions. First, there 
was in the Ministry of Finance a meeting for the higher intellectuals. 
At that occasion, I criticized the party about the school where I 
taught. I urged that the party hook up the school to the Ministry of 
Higher Education because their leaders in the Ministry of Finance 
did not know how to run a school. 
Afterwards, in the school meetings I criticized the party because 
it did not trust intellectuals. I urged the party to give more freedom 
to the people. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Your criticism, then, was lack of intellectual freedom 
within the school? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes. 
Mr. ScHuurz. What was the real purpose of the Hundred Flowers 
program?

Mr. DIAO. I think it was promoted by the Hungarian incident. 
According to Mao Tse-tung, he wanted to give the people limited 
freedom to express their opinion to prevent a revolution in China. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you actually believe that your criticism of the 
Government would go unpunished? 
Mr. DIAO. No, I didn't believe they would punish at first. I thought 
the criticism would be used to improve the Government work. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Arid for this criticism, then, you were sent to a 
labor camp? 
. MT. DIAO. Yes, correct. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. How many other people went with you to this 
labor camp, and who went? 
Mr. DIAO. I don't know the exact number because the camp was 
formed after the mode. of the army. In our company it consisted of a 
little bit more than 100 persons, who came from several Ministries 
in Peking: the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 
the Ministryof Foreign Trade. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Now to understand, these are all Government 
officials who were sent to the labor camp? 
MT. DIAO. Yes. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Why was this? Were they also people who had 
criticized the Government? 
Mr. Duo. They sent us there to undergo thought reform through 
labor. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. You mentioned that you worked 14 to 16 hours a 
day. What did you do? 
Mr. DIAO. We did various hard works. We built a railroad, a road, 
a house, farm work. But most of the time we dug ditches, because 
the water was too high there and they wanted to drain it out so the 
land could be utilized. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. I can understand the punitive nature of the hard 
work, but did you also in your thought reform process attend classes 
or attend lectures which would change your philosophical belief? 
Mr. Duo. For more than 2 years we didn't have study classes at 
all, mainly work in the field. But only in the later part, when everybody 
was sick, were we allowed 3 to 4 hours a day to attend study. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Then were you required to write papers or discuss? 
Mr. DIAO. No, we just were in group discussion. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you study books, too, and manuals? 
Mr. MAO. No books, all the materials issued by the communist 
party central committee. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. You mentioned that you were considered a rightist. 
What other types of people are considered anti-Government? 
Mr. DIAO. There are categories: the workers and the peasants, and 
the counterrevolutionary rightists, and that is the one, the so-called 
bad elements. That means that there are no grounds for anything; 
they can brand you as a bad enemy. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Was your labor camp that you were confined in 
similar to the type of imprisonment that a criminal would have? 
Mr. DTAO. Quite similar, but there is a big difference because the 
real criminals were guarded by the soldiers, who carried a shotgun; 
also, they beat them badly. I think their conditions were worse than 
ours.

Mr. SCHULTZ. What did your wife and family do while you were 
gone this 2 years and 10 months? 
Mr. DIAO. When I was away in Manchuria, my wife was sent to a 
people's commune down to the south of Shansi Province to do farm 
work there for one year. Our children, my son was then not quite 2 
years old, was living in a nursery school and my daughter was entrusted 
to a relative in Peking. So my family was scattered in four different 
places. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Then you subsequently got together after you were 
released from the labor camp and all lived in the Shansi Province? 
Mr. DIAO. Right. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you receive any special treatment in the labor 
camp because you were an educated man and in a high Government 
position? 
Mr. DIAO. No. We were treated just the same. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. All the people were treated the same. Would you 
describe for us the economy of China prior to the "Great Leap For-
ward" movement? 
(At this point Mr. Zion entered the hearing room.) 
Mr. DIAO. Prior to the so-called "Great Leap Forward," things 
were quite good: people had enough to eat, they have clothes, they 
have a decent life. But the situation was getting worse in the start of 
the "Great Leap Forward" in 1959. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. What is the "Great Leap Forward"? What is that 
movement? 
Mr. DIAO. That was the plan of Mao Tse-tung to make China 
stronger within a short limit. The slogan was to catch and bypass 
Britain within 15 years. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. How effective was this program? 
Mr. DIAO. I think it was a failure completely. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Were there any privileged people who got more food 
than others? 
Mr. DIAO. Only the high officials of the party and the Government. 
They got a special treatment. But before the "Great Leap Forward" 
we, as the higher intellectuals, received more food than other people. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you receive any special privileges during this 
period? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes. During the 1956 to '57, as a higher intellectual we 
received these privileges and we also had a card to entitle us to shop 
at the head of the lines. 
Mr. Scriuurz. In other words, you could go to the head of the 
grocery lines? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. What was the availability of food products in the 
stores? Did you have a great selection of food products? 
Mr. DIAO. Before the "Great Leap Forward" there was quite a 
selection, but not after the "Great Leap Forward". 
Mr. SCHULTZ. How about the prices. Did you experience any black 
market in China? 
Mr. MAO. Yes, during the bad years we had a so-called free market. 
It is in fact, a black market.

opposed to the cities? Is there any difference?

Mr. DIAO. There was not very much difference, but in that time a 
peasant could get more food by his own vegetables, and things like 
that. Probably it was better than most of the people in the city. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. What is the working situation in China? Must 
everyone work? 
Mr. DIAO. The party considers working as the right, also the 
obligation of the people. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Are they allowed to change their jobs if they want to? 
Mr. DIAO. No, not by free will. It was assigned by the party, by 
the Government. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. They were assigned to a specific job to do. How about 
the location? 
Mr. DIAO. It includes the location. You cannot transfer by yourself 
from one to another; you have to clear with the party or the authorities. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Do they have labor unions in China? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes, there were labor unions in China. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, the staff has done a careful study of 
the constitution of the countries whose former citizens will testify 
before us this week. My intention is to display a chart on which we 
have noted those rights specifically and unequivocally guaranteed by 
the constitutions of the respective countries. I will ask each witness 
if he personally experienced these riOts during the time he lived under 
the constitution, and I will ask him only at this time about those 
rights specifically mentioned in the constitution of the country. 
If he states he did not experience this right fully and completely, 
I will ask him to cross out the question on the chart, and a member 
of the staff will mark this on the display screen. 
The CHAIRMAN. Proceed. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Professor Diao, I believe I gave you a copy of this 
chart you have in front of you. I would like to go through these 
various freedoms that are specifically spelled out in the Constitution 
of China. I will start with the first one, the freedom of speech. Did 
you have complete freedom of speech under the Constitution? 
Mr. DIAO. No, absolutely. 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Counsel, that is designated the Old Constitu-
tion of 1954. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Yes, sir; the constitution under which Mr. Diao lived. 
The CHAIRMAN. Proceed. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. What curtailment was made on freedom of speech? 
Mr. DIAO. A good example is my case. The party encouraged you 
to express yourself, but [when] I did, I was branded as a rightist. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Could you talk freely among your neighbors and 
friends? 
Mr. DIAO. No, we dared not, because the party encouraged every-
body to report others. You couldn't trust your neighbors nor your 
own relatives. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Mr. Diao, I will move to the next one. How about 
freedom of the press? 
Mr. DIAO. No, all the news articles were arranged by the party. 
You cannot write anything to be accepted by the newspapers and 
the magazines. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you have freedom of assembly? 
Mr. DIAO. NO.

Mr. SCHULTZ. Are there any demonstrations that are allowed at all? 
Mr. Duo. Yes, there were demonstrations, but of a different 
nature. They were planned by the party. Like an anti-U.S. imperialism 
and the others, all were planned by the party. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. How about freedom of correspondence? Do you write 
to people in China? Are you free to correspond with them and they 
with you? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes, we had limited freedom in this category because they 
have a huge population. They cannot investigate and check every 
letter. But they do check letters; if you get something wrong, they 
just select it. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. To your knowledge, did you live under mail censorship 
in China? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you have freedom of religion? 
Mr. DIAO. No, we didn't have freedom of religion because the party 
said the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion, but there was 
also freedom against religion. So in China, except the very old genera-
tion there is no religion at all. 
Mr. ScHuvrz. Did you have the freedom to engage in cultural 
pursuits? 
Mr. DIAO. No, I don't think so. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Could you give us an example? 
Mr. DIAO. Because when I talked in the colleges, the lectures were 
prepared in collective manner. We have to accept the point of view 
beforehand, submit our points of view beforehand to the party com-
mittee, and then after that we followed the lines. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Dia you have freedom to travel within China and 
without? 
Mr. DIAO. In China, I think that there was limited freedom to 
travel, but you have to get permission from your organization, the 
school. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Were you issued an identification card of any sort 
that you had to keep with you? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes, everybody had an identification card issued by 
the various agencies, the school, the government agency, or the 
commune. So whenever you want to travel, you have to clear it with 
the authorities. For instance, when I was in Taiwan I wanted to go 
to Peking to visit relatives there, and I had to ask permission from 
the authorities. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. You have already commented on your freedom of 
education, but I would like for you to state it positively for us. Did 
you have freedom of education? 
Mr. DIAO. No, because whether or not you can attend higher 
education must be cleared by the party. You cannot choose your educa-
tion by your free will. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Does the party prescribe the textbooks that will be 
used in the schools? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Are the teachers required to be members of the 
communist party? 
Mr. DIAO. No, teachers were not required to be communist mem-
bers, but if you were a communist party member you would get 
more chance to be promoted.

Mr. SCHULTZ. In other words, it might be detrimental to their 
career if they were not a communist party member? 
Mr. DIAO. Right. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you feel, or did you experience that you had. 
freedom to emigrate? 
Mr. MAO. Absolutely not. There were only two ways to get out of 
China. One is just illegal that is only available to those people on the 
borders, but not for us in the north part of China. We had to ask 
permission to go. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Now skip over to the last item, the freedom of secret 
ballot. This is specifically provided in your Constitution. 
Mr. DIAO. It is difficult to tell. If you can vote, you go to the booth 
and nobody sees you. But for those -)eople who cannot write and read 
to vote for this person, and even Eiough they have a kind of secret 
ballot, you didn't have any chance for choice, because all the nominees 
and the candidates were fixed by the party, one for each position. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. You mentioned before having to have an identifica-
tion card and permission to travel. One specific item in the Constitu-
tion provides for the freedom to change residence? 
Mr. DIAO. No, absolutely not, because if you change your residence 
on your own, you could not get food rations. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Professor Diao, what must one do to be successful in 
China today? 
Mr. DIAO. I bop. your pardon, sir. 
MT. SCHULTZ. beg
must an. individual do to be successful in 
China today? 
Mr. MAO. Follow the line of Mao Tse-tung. I say follow the line 
of Mao Tse-tung, that means follow the line of the party. Because 
before the cultural revolution, the slogan was: Listen to the party. 
But now, if you listen to the news out here you will get in trouble. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Are the students in China treated as a privileged 
class? 
Mr. DIAO. No, I don't think so. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. You were at Columbia University during the trouble 
there after you returned from China. Will you compare the Red 
Guard activities in China with the student uprisings in our country? 
Mr. DIAO. On the surface it is quite similar, but inside it is different 
because the Red Guard was run by the army and the Mao factions. 
But here, I don't know whether it was influenced by some organization 
or not. But it seems to me they are very much like communists 
Mr. SCHULTZ. How much information of world affairs outside of 
China is made available to the Chinese population? 
Mr. DIAO. Very little. Only the higher intellectuals in the Academy 
of Sciences have the priority to look at some magazines or news-
papers published outside of China. In Government and from a certain 
rank, like a second chief in the Government or a lecturer in the 
university, they have special published newspapers inside newspapers. 
The party selects some items from outside publications, like the 
New York Times and The Washington Post, and like that. But these 
items are selected to suit their interests. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. From your observations, do you think that China 
desires to increase its contact with other nations? 
Mr. DTA?. During the 1950's they did. In that time, they wanted to 
make contact with other countries. But afterwards they were: turned

down by the United States, so they want to be doing things by 
themselves. But after the "Cultural Revolution," from the evidence 
available recently, they are trying to improve their relations with 
outsiders. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. How much influence does the army in China have 
on the national policy? 
Mr. DIAO. I think before the "Cultural Revolution" the army 
was quite controlled by the party; but after the "Cultural Revolu-
tion,' the influence of the army is getting stronger and stronger. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Has China stopped their teaching of Russian in 
the schools? 
Mr. DIAO. Only in the early 1950's there was very little with Russia 
at that time. But after the dispute with Russia they are not allowed 
to learn Russian. Now they are shifted to learn English. 
Mr. Scirmirz. They are now learning English? 
Mr. DIAO. Now they are learning English. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. What is the reason for the change? 
Mr. DIAO. I don't know, but I presume they want to learn more 
about the Western countries and get more technical materials and 
information from the Western countries because they couldn't get 
this information from Russia. 
Mr. Sciruurz. Mr. Chairman, in view of the extensive statement 
that Professor Diao has submitted this might be a good time to have 
inquiry from the committee members, if you desire. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much, Mr. Diao, for your appear-
ance this morning. 
The Chinese people have made many very significant contributions 
to the development and the growth of this Nation and as I stated to a 
representative of an American-Chinese welfare organization the other 
day, I only wish that all Americans were making an equivalent con-
tribution to the strength of this country as the Chinese people. We 
greatly appreciate your appearance today. 
Are you now a citizen of the United States? 
Mr. DIAO. Now I am not, but I have applied for the citizenship. 
The CHAIRMAN. You have initiated the naturalization process, 
you have put that into operation? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes. 
The CHAIRMAN. Now, you say in 1957 the party invited criticism 
from nonparty members. You made criticism in response to that 
invitation and then your troubles began. Were you ever a member of 
the, party?MT. DIAO. NO, I Nillts not. 
The CHAIRMAN. Wouldn't it have been to your advantage to have 
become a member of the party? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes; if you were a party member you got more privi-
leges. But it was very difficult to get in the party after 1949. Besides, 
I intended not to get into the party. 
The CHAIRMAN. Why did you not intend to go into the party? 
Mr. DIAO. Because from my own experience I looked at the party 
activity, no matter whether it is the Nationalist Party or the com-
munist party; the communist party assumed very tight control of 
their party members. You have to study, you have to get into the 
so-called party life every week.

The CHAIRMAN. You say that you left China on the pretense of 
visiting your mother in Hong Kong. What year was that? 
Mr. DIAO. It was '62. 
The CHAIRMAN. And you stayed in Hong Kong? 
Mr. DIAO. Until 1966. 
The CHAIRMAN. You came to this country in 1966. Why do you 
say that socialism will not work in China, Mr. Diao? 
Mr. DIAO. From my experience, their system will never work be-
cause their system is designed for the leaders, the dictatorship, to 
conquer the world but not consider the people. From my knowledge 
about the Soviet Union after the revolution for so many years they 
still have to turn to the right, to allow the people to get more freedom. 
So do the European countries. 
The CHAIRMAN. What year did you return to China? 
Mr. DIAO. 1950. 
The CHAIRMAN. You were there from 1950 until 1962. Were you 
in Shanghai during any period of that time? I observed that you 
mentioned Shanghai in your testimony. 
Mr. DIAO. Only on my way back to Peking, I stayed in Shanghai 
for 1 month in 1950. 
The CHAIRMAN. Did you have occasion to be in the International 
Settlement?
Mr. DIAO. No. 
The CHAIRMAN .?what used to be called the International Settlement 
in Shanghai? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes, it used to be there, but now it is open for Chinese. 
The CHAIRMAN. I am very interested, Mr. Diao, in your discussion 
about how elections are held in China. Last year we had a young 
refugee from Russia who lived in Moscow, and he compared the way 
elections were conducted in Russia with the way they were conducted 
in the United States. There, he said, you didn't have the opportunity 
to vote for anyone, you only had the opportunity to vote against, 
because only one name appeared on the ballot for any one election. 
He also mentioned that instead of voting your ballot behind the closed 
curtain, you voted it out on the table before a commissar. 
I didn't quite understand your testimony in regard to elections. Do 
they have more than one name on the ballot in China? You seemed 
to indicate that the voter in China might have a choice, that there 
might be more than one name on the ballot. Is that true? 
Mr. DIAO. No, there is only one name for one post. If they have 
two positions, they have two names. 
The CHAIRMAN. That would be different positions, but there would 
only be one name for each post or each office? 
Mr. DIAO. That is right. 
The CHAIRMAN. Then you can only vote against? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes, the party said if you wish, you can vote no for 
this person, to write down your own person. But there was no use, 
and people would not do that because probably they would get in 
trouble. 
The CHAIRMAN. How do you vote the ballot? Did you have occa-
sion to vote in China? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes, I did. 
The CHAIRMAN. In what city?

Mr. DIAO. In Peking. 
The CHAIRMAN. HOW do you vote? Do you vote secretly Or in the 
open? 
Mr. DIAO. The booth is the spot. You went into the booth to vote, 
but if you cannot read you have to ask somebody to vote for you. 
That person was assigned by the party. 
The CHAIRMAN. You also mentioned in your statement unions 
used by the Chinese workers. How are the unions organized? Are 
you intimately familiar with the organization of unions? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes, I was a member of the teachers union in China. 
The CHAIRMAN. Unions, then, are organized along craft lines? 
Mr. DIA o. Yes. There are many, many unions, according to different 
trades. But the main function of the trade union in China is to help 
the party to give political education for their members. 
The CHAIRMAN. I believe the refugee from Russia?I believe it was 
his testimony?pointed out that unions operate quite differently in 
Russia. Instead of representing the people and communicating with 
employers and with the Government as they do in the United States, 
there they operate as a means of communicating from the Government 
to the people. Do you essentially have the same type of union 
organization in China? 
Mr. DIA O. Yes I think the trade union in China was more in the 
position of the Yes,
because the Government is the em-
ployer. They try to act as agents of the Government and party, not 
members of the union themselves. 
The CHAIRMAN. What about your court system? Is the court system 
run by a civilian or run by the army in China? 
Mr. DIA O. Normally run by civilians, but the judge, the prosecuting 
attorneys were transferred from the army. 
The CHAIRMAN. Did the army also have a system of courts? 
Mr. DIA 0. Yes, they have their own system of courts within the 
army. 
The CHAIRMAN. But they don't try civilians in their system? 
Mr. DIA O. Usually not. Only in the beginning of the regime under 
the so-called military control, at that time there was a military code. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
The gentleman from Ohio. 
Mr. ASHBROOK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
As you indicated in your opening statement, these hearings are for 
the purpose of updating our committee information on the theory of 
communism and, as you pointed out, to gain insight relative to the 
functioning of communism in actual practice. 
Along that line, Professor Diao, I was most interested in reading 
your statement. On the first page you indicate that you came to the 
United States in 1947, attended the University of Illinois Department 
of Economics Graduate School at Urbana. You further said you 
graduated in 1948 with a master's degree and in 1948 and '49 you 
attended the Columbia University in New York City where, from 
1949 to 1950, you attended the Graduate School of Business Admin-
istration of New York University, evidently pursuing a course of 
studies to get a Ph. D., but you did not finish it. You returned to 
China in 1950.

On page 3, then, you indicate, "In Peking, I found that many of the 
persons with whom I had associated in the United States prior to my 
return to China were in reality communists." 
am not going to ask for any names at this point; as a matter of 
fact, 1 would be very careful and urge you to refrain from the use of 
any names. I would be most interested in some further enlightenment 
on this particular subject. Since you limited the number of associations 
you had, on page 1, to the University of Illinois and Columbia Univer-
sity in New York, am I to gain the impression that these people you are 
referring to were Americans that you associated with during this time 
of study? 
DIAO. No, I was not referring to the university, but rather to 
Chinese Student Christian Association. Because of the way I met the 
students of course, our fellow students from China many of them 
returned to China. Then I found they were communist members. 
Mr. ASHBROOK. When they returned to China? 
Mr. DIAO. Before that, but I found out after I returned to China. 
Mr. ASHBROOK. So most of the people you are referring to are either 
Americans of Chinese ancestry or Chinese citizens who were in the 
United States at the time, who later returned, as you did, to China 
and you then subsequently found that they were indeed communists 
while back in China. Would this be all of the people, or were there 
some who were Americans? 
DIAO. No, only Chinese, not Americans. 
Mr. ASHBROOK. What particular line were they promoting at that 
time? In any interest in the theory of communism, I am sure you, 
the student, recognize that at any particular time there is a com-
munist line that is being promoted. After you left in 1950, it was the 
germ warfare line, then it was McCarthyism, and at the present 
day it seems to be the line that we have a repressive society. But at 
any given time there is a reasonably consistent communist line, and 
in the period from 1947 to '50, which you would have particular 
knowledge about, what was the particular line that the members of 
the Chinese Student Christian Association then in the United States 
were promoting at that particular time? Do you recall? 
Mr. DIAO. Of course, this association was the Christian Association 
founded quite a long time ago. But during that time, after World 
War IT, some members were sent by the communist party, I think. 
So during that time they started a movement to urge the Chinese 
students to return to China to contribute themselves for a new 
Mr. ASHBROOK. It sounds like they recruited you, too. 
Mr. DIAO. That, was correct, because I thought this was a new 
China and also the communist trend to be run by a coalition govern-
ment and to give the people a new democracy. So I think I was fooled 
by this kind of propaganda at that time. 
Mr. AS ['BROOK. On page 8 you indicate, "There is almost no 
religion in China anymore except among the older people," and then 
you go on to indicate the facts as you know them regarding religion 
and the practice of religion in communist China. 
Would it be your impression now in retrospect that the use of the 
word "Christian" in the association at that time was for propaganda 
purposes, or was it actually the Christian Association of Chinese 
students?

Mr. DIA?. I think both. For the communist party members, they 
wanted to use this association to attract propaganda; but for the most 
of the members who joined that and attended that association, they 
didn't know, like myself. We went just to do Christian work. 
Mr. ASHBROOK. Again, this strikes at the heart of the communist 
practice. We recognize, as you pointed out, the difference between 
what might be thought of the leaders and what might be the principles 
or motives of those they attract. We know in every case, regardless of 
the communist leadership involved, that these are always good people, 
well-meaning people, who are attracted. 
Talking specifically of your knowledge of the people who were the 
leaders of the Chinese Students Christian Association, could you 
honestly tell us at this point whether any of them were in fact Christian, 
or were they communist party functionaries merely using the name 
as an appeal to people like yourself to get you back to China? We are 
talking about the leaders, not about the people who were attracted by 
their propaganda. 
Mr. DIAO. It is still difficult to determine the leaders because those 
communist members were behind the scene. They didn't assume the 
leadership jobs. For instance, I was the cochairman of the New York 
chapter at that time, and I was not a- communist member. But those 
behind the scenes were communist members. 
Mr. ASHBROOK. What you are saying in effect I don't want to 
misinterpret your statement?what you are saying in effect is that 
although many people were attracted, such as yourself, and put in a 
leadership position, even at that time there wasn't the inclination on 
the part of the communist organizers to allow other than the patty 
members to promote the program, or to be its hard-core organizers. Is 
that correct? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes. Because they want to use the outsiders to attract 
the other people because it is more useful for them to put the members 
in the positions where they assume leadership by themselves. Besides, 
I think this is the way to try to avoid attention by the authorities, the 
FBI or someone. If they were very active, they would probably get 
caught. 
Mr. ASHBROOK, I tPillk this is most interesting, because, even with 
the passage of 23 years, it is interesting to see th.at you were attracted 
to the communist cause, in effect, by what might be considered a 
front group at that time professing to be a student Christian asso-
ciation, but in reality nothing more than an arm of the Chinese Corn 
munist Party. Just as in this day and age I think we see, as time goes 
by, that not many things change. The issue might change, the line 
might change, the front organization might change, but there is still 
the effort, as there was then, to set up a front, set up an organization 
to tie into what might be popular at that moment and to exploit as 
many people as possible. 
I guess you, in your testimony, indicate that you are a hvmg wit-
ness to that type of exploitation. I have one question, because r know 
all of the other members have something to say. You indicated, in 
your discussion about the freedom of the press, that there was not 
any substantial press freedom in China. Other testimony has in.di-
cated that, despite the repressive brutality in the Soviet Union, there 
is still in that country what might be referred to as an underground

press. In some cases it is little more than papers that are printed by 
intellectuals, circulated among themselves. But whatever you want to 
call it, there is an effort in the Soviet Union among certain classes of 
people, particularly the intellectuals, to circulate within the confines 
of their own abilities in that country, some truth and some of their 
own personal thinking. 
Is there any movement of this type that you have been able to see 
within Red China? 
Mr. DIAO. To my knowledge, I don't think so, because I think 
that political control in China is much tighter than the Soviet Union 
and the European countries. 
Mr. ASHBROOK. Thank you, Professor. That is all the questions 
I have at this time. 
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from North Carolina. 
Mr. PREYER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
Thank you, Mr. Diao, for your testimony. You have described 
very vividly in your statement the hardships of life in China now. 
I would like to ask, in view of those hardships, is there any chance 
that there will be a change from within the Government of China 
at this time? That is, is there any chance that the people will over-
throw the present Government, or is there any chance that excessive 
unrest among the people through strikes, such as we saw in Eastern 
Poland, will bring about changes in that Government? 
Mr. DIAO. I think the chance is very little for the people to over-
throw the Government or the party because the communist controls, 
both the organization and the ideology, are very tight. Everybody is 
isolated; they cannot communicate with others. But I think there 
will be more chance for themselves to change to the revolutions, 
especially after the days of Mao. 
Mr. PREYER. I gather you are saying that you don't feel that 
from the people putting outside pressure on the Government that 
there will be changes, but that the Government itself may revise its 
theory and practice of government. 
When you travel in Eastern Europe, for example, you find people 
saying things are very hard, "We can't find housing, we don't have 
enough food, and we can't buy automobiles," etc. But then they say, 
"It's much better than it was." Is this the attitude of most people 
in China, that no matter how bad things are now, things are much 
better than they were before the present government took over? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes. I think the party and the Government want people 
to believe that, even though the situation is very bad now, it is still 
better than before and than in some other countries. But the Chinese 
people are so naive to listen to this kind of pressuring because they 
didn't know anything about the outside world. They believe that. 
Even though, during the bad years in 1960, I heard quite many peas-
ants complaining about the situation, but during that time the intel-
lectuals, they are not to speak their own opinions, but the peasants 
did. 
Mr. PREYER. You mentioned in your statement hardship years 
around 1959 and 1960. Have things improved since those hardship 
years in a substantial way? In other words, what I am getting at, 
are the people generally satisfied with their Government in the sense 
that they are saying things are bad, but they used to be much worse?

21 
Or is there so much unrest that there is actually a chance of some 
change in the government? 
Mr. DIAO. During that time there was quite a great change, because 
the people's dissatisfaction with the Government was getting stronger 
during that time, the bad years. But later on, from the latter part of 
1962, the situation was getting a little bit better, so the people since 
were more satisfied. 
Mr. PREYER. I gather from what you are saying?and I won't go 
into this any further?that though conditions are bad, terrible by 
our standards, we would make a mistake to think that the people are 
on the verge of an uprising, that their attitude is that things are better? 
Mr. DIAO. Because the people didn't have any choice. If there is 
available to choose between certain kinds of governments or systems, 
the people would be against the communist party, because now they 
don't have this choice. 
MT. PREYER. Thank you, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Indiana. 
Mr. ZION. We have particularly appreciated your testimony here 
this morning. There is an increasing dialogue in this country to admit 
Red China to the United Nations and also to increase dialogue, to 
associate with people in communist China. I wonder if you care to 
comment on what centers of influence exist there. 
I have two questions, really: No. 1, with whom would we be com-
municating, would it be Chou En-lai, Mao, the army, the party as 
such, the Red Guards? 
I understand there are two Red Guards; we have one that is pro-
army and one antiarmy. Just who are the influential groups in China 
today, sir? 
Mr. DIAO. I think it is very difficult to get with Peking, even 
though Peking is getting more stable right now after the cultural 
revolution. 
Mr. ZION. You say Peking is getting more influence now. When 
you refer to Peking, what particular group or individual do you refer 
to? 
Mr. DIAO. Peking is Mao because Mao is still there. Even after the 
"Cultural Revolution" I think they have quite a problem within China. 
So it is very difficult at this moment to begin a dialogue with Peking. 
Mr. ZION. Mao, of course, is getting on in years. Do you anticipate 
that some other group within China might be growing in power? 
My question, of course, gets to the point: If we, in fact, wanted to 
carry on meaningful dialogue in Red China, who would be the people 
we would contact now and who potentially would be the groups in 
power or influence? 
I am well aware of the fact that in Red China, as well as many 
other countries, many groups are not "simpatico" one with the other. 
Can we anticipate that someone actually does speak for Red China 
now, someone or some group; and if so, who is it, and if not, who poten-
tially would be a group that would represent the fooling of the majority 
of the people, or at least would hold the authority over the majority 
of the people? 
Mr. DIAO. Through the new constitution of Mao, he has picked 
his successor, but I think after Mao's death there would be quite a 
change. Probably some now leaders will emerge to take over after a 
short period, after the so-called "collective leadership."

So it is very difficult to tell whom to begin dialogue with. Chou has 
the impression, to intellectuals, of being much more moderate than 
Mao. But Chou En-lai is very aged right now, and how long he lives 
is in doubt. 
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Massachusetts. 
Mr. DRINAN. Thank you, Mr. Diao, for coming. 
What is your present employment? 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Professor Diao would prefer not to discuss his present 
employment. 
Mr. DRINAN. Is there any reason for that? 
The CHAIRMAN. I think perhaps we should have a conference off 
the record. 
Mr. Counsel, come forward, please. 
(Discussion off the record.) 
The CHAIRMAN. Proceed, the gentleman from Massachusetts. 
Mr. DRINAN. The chairman has ruled that since an agreement 
apparently was made by counsel with you about your present employ-
ment, the question need not be answered by you. 
How did you come in contact, sir, With the counsel of this committee? 
Mr. DIAO. The committee approached me. 
Mr. DRINAN. Have you ever testified about this subject before any 
Federal or State body before? 
Mr. DENO. No, this is my first time. 
Mr. DRINAN. What would you suggest, sir, in view of your testi-
mony, as to what this committee can do? This is a Committee on 
Internal Security, with 47 full-time employees, with a budget of some 
one-half million dollars. What would you suggest as constructive work 
for this committee, in view of your testimony? 
The CHAIRMAN. I think, gentleman from Massachusetts, that 
would be outside the competence of this witness. The gentleman from 
Massachusetts is a member of this committee. I think the gentleman 
from Massachusetts is capable of making suggestions for the work of 
the committee. As the gentleman well knows, the Chair will give him 
ample opportunity to present his views. But I don't think it is neces-
sary to ask this witness to comment upon that question; it is definitely 
outside his competence. 
Mr. DRINAN. That is all, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Georgia. 
Mr. THOMPSON. nail m  you, Mr. Chairman. 
What is the status of the family in China today, under communism 
today, as opposed to the status of the family before the communists 
took over? 
Mr.ThAo. There was quite Et change. Before the communists took 
over, the people were in favor of the family; they stayed together and. 
they were loyal to their family more than others. But now the coin-
m.unists try to break down this concept. They teach the children from 
very young, kindergarten or nursery school, that Chairman Mao and 
the party are better than anybody else; you have to listen to your 
party, not your parents. 
Mr. THOMPSON. Are the families kept together as a whole, or at an 
early age are sometimes the children moved into special schools and 
special training away from the parents? 
Mr. DIAO. They use a kind of organization, the Young Pioneers, 
like Boy Scouts. They attract the children into this organization and

23 
they have meetings every week. On the weekends they go on trips 
to do activities in groups. So they try to avoid the children staying 
in the family. 
During the "Great Leap Forward," they even went a step further 
they separated the husbands and the wives and the children. 
Mr. THOMPSON. They separated the husband and wife? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes, the husbands and wives were organized into 
different brigades after the model of the army, and they don't allow 
the two to stay together. 
Mr. THOMPSON. How was that received? How did people accept 
the separation of husband and wife and the breaking down of the 
family? 
Mr. DIA O. The people did not like this idea at all, so in the night 
the wives and husbands wanted to be together and they went to the 
nursery schools to look for their children because they didn't believe 
the children were in good hands. 
Mr. THOMPSON. Is there any apparent resistance to the party's 
attempt to eliminate religion? Perhaps I am putting words in your 
mouth, but from the testimony I drew the conclusion that religion 
is not in favor in China. Do the people seem to resent the fact that 
there is an official policy against organized religion? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes, I think there is an official policy against religion, 
because the party always teaches the people to not take on the religion 
because they think the religion, no matter what it is, it is reactionary, 
according to Marxism. 
Mr. THOMPSON. If a person were a member of?a Buddhist or a 
Catholic, could he become a member of the communist party? 
Mr. DIAO. NO. 
Mr. THOMPSON. In other words, if he is a member of organized 
religion he could not be a member of the communist party? 
Mr. 151A?. If he is a party member, he would be expelled. 
Mr. THOMPSON. Approximately what is the size of the Communist 
Party in China as related to the total population of China? Do you 
have an idea as to the number? 
Mr. DIAO. I don't have that exact figure. Of course, the Chinese 
Communist Party is one of the largest in the world of its kind, but 
compared to the huge population in China, it is still the minority of 
the population. 
Mr. THOMPSON. In your statement you mentioned there were eight 
other parties in China. Could you tell us briefly what role these parties 
play? Do you jeopardize your future in China if you belong to one of 
these eight parties other than the communist party, or are they in 
effect puppets of the communist parrty? 
Mr. DIAO. These so-called "democratic" parties have been estab-
lished before the communist takeover, and they attended the political 
conference in 1949 to prepare the establishment of the communist 
regime. So these eight so-called "democratic" parties take up the gun 
of the communist party and the sword of Mao Tse-tung as the 
guidelines. So in fact they are acting as an agent for the communist 
party or a front organization for the party. 
Mr. THOMPSON. SO, in effect, they are "front" parties for the Com-
munist Party in China? 
Mr. DIA O. That is right.

Mr. THOMPSON. What is the position of the army as related to the 
partyin China? Now, during the "Cultural Revolution" we heard a great 
deal that the army was becoming more dominant than the party. Are 
your army leaders party members also, or are some of your top army 
leaders nonparty members? 
Mr. DIAO. I think all the army leaders, commanders, political 
commissioners are all communist party members. Even in the 
Government, the higher ranked leaders are communist party mem-
bers. Of course, they are allowed a certain position to the so-called 
"democratic" party members, but this is just a figurehead. 
Mr. THOMPSON. You also mentioned a little bit about the public 
defender system. Is there a trial by jury in China? If a person is 
accused of a crime, is he entitled as a matter of right to have a trial by 
jury? 
Mr. DIAO. Not necessarily- entitled to a trial because many of the 
people have secret trials by the party. But when the party considers a 
certain case as worthwhile for publicity, then they go to trial and are 
assigned a counsel for the defendant. But actually this counselor or 
the lawyer could not defend for the defense. 
Mr. THOMPSON. Why could he not defend for the defense? 
Mr. DIAO. Since this case almost always involved counterrevolu-
tionaries, in China nobody can defend a counterrevolutionary; 
otherwise, probably you will be next. So the function of this appointed 
lawyer or counselor actually acted as the prosecutor for the State and 
tried to convince the defense to admit to its crime. 
Mr. THOMPSON. What would happen if a defense counsel attempted 
to defend a counterrevolutionary?in other words, if he took his side 
and actively advocated that he was not guilty or he had a right to 
engage in the actions which he was doing?what would happen to the 
defense attorney if he took the side of a counterrevolutionary? 
Mr. DIAO. He would definitely get [into] trouble. Either he would 
be branded as a rightist or a counterrevolutionary and sent to the 
labor camp. 
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from California. 
Mr. SCHMITZ. Thank you for your testimony. 
I would like to ask you a question that pertains to the relationship 
of Nationalist China to the people on mainland China. What is the 
attitude of the average person on mainland China toward the Chinese 
Government in Taiwan? Do they look at them for hope, do they 
regard them as the true Government of China, or what is the attitude? 
Mr. Dim). Of course not, I think the Nationalist Government 
and the people in Taiwan are very much against the communist 
party in mainland China. 
Mr. SCEIMITZ. I meant what was the attitude of the people on 
mainland China toward the government on Taiwan? 
Mr. DIAO. Because they were told by the Government that people 
in the Government in Taiwan are in the category of a reactionary and 
an agent of the U.S. imperialism, and they will liberate Taiwan's 
human labor, but not by force; probably through some peaceful 
method approach. 
Mr. SCHMITZ. Last week, shall we say, the bridges were beginning 
to be built to China, and our citizens, according to a news report, are 
now allowed on a limited basis to go to Red China. Would you care to 
comment on that?

Mr. DIAO. I would rather doubt this measure, whether this measure 
has its effect on Peking, at least not very much. Because it is not on the 
American side whether to allow certain people to travel to China but 
it is on China's side, they refuse to give a visa to the Americans. So 
far, there are only three persons among some 1,000 Americans. 
Mr. SCHMITZ. In other words, you feel they will still make sure that 
those Americans who do come to China are those Americans who will 
give some benefit to mainland China? 
Mr. DIAO. Yes. I think they will still refuse to allow the Americans 
to go to China, at least for this period. 
Every foreigner when he comes to visit China was well prepared by 
the party to give the kind of outside questions and their purposes. So 
suppose the people in China who might contact this fellow?they have 
the kind of ideas and questions beforehand. I think communist China 
would not allow foreigners to travel freely in China. 
Mr. SCHMITZ. One last question: I don't know what your activities 
in this country have been since you have been back here, but you must 
have run across the attitude of our young people. In the latter part of 
last week I had a young man in my office who, in the course of the 
conversation, made what I consider a typical comment by our students, 
and that is that the people of China, referring to Chma in general, 
mainland China, are better off now than they were under the previous 
regime. Would you care to comment on that? 
Mr. DIAO. I think because they are youngsters they don't know 
anything about the real China. When I was in Columbia in 1966-67, 
when the trouble started there, the students wanted to set up a kind 
of people's commune in Columbia University, because they thought 
this kind of organization has been set up in Peking University in 
Peking. 
I had a chance to talk with several of the students, I said, "Do you 
know what kind of organization is that; do you think it was really 
run by the students themselves?" 
They said they do, they do believe that, because they were told that. 
I said, "It is not true, because it was run by the party, not by the 
students." So I think that most of the students are just very naive and 
ignorant about the real thing happening in China. They thought the 
regime was better than the old regime, but actually it is not. 
The CHAIRMAN. I thank the gentleman from California. 
Professor Ditto, I have heard what I consider some very prepos-
terous stories coming out of China, apparently in an effort to build up 
a personality cult around Mao Tse-tung. For example, I remember one 
story that I read about or heard, concerning a young doctor who was 
attempting to administer medical assistance to a child who, I believe, 
had its arm severed, and he called upon the "Thoughts" of Mao 
Tse-tung and received the inspiration and the knowledge to success-
fully administer medical treatment. 
Another story I have heard, about the Chinese pilot coming up 
against enemy planes and calling upon the "Thoughts" of Mao 
Tse-tung for the inspiration and the knowledge ?for shooting down 
successfully the enemy planes. 
Are those propaganda efforts actually promoted in China, or were 
they promoted while you were there?

26 
DIAO. Yes. When I was there this kind of stories was promoted 
by the party, but not so like right now because now they are saying 
Mao Tse-tung is not a person. They want him as a god in China. 
The party and the people treat Mao Tse-tung not like a person, 
because he is a god of China. 
When everything is impossible, you try to look for a solution from 
the "Thoughts" of Mao Tse-ting, his "red book," and even if a 
person is dying, a doctor can read a few sentences from Mao Tse-tung 
and the patient will be healed. I don't believe this kind of story, but 
that is going on, stronger and stronger. 
The CHAIRMAN. Gentlemen, are there any further questions of 
Professor Diao? 
(At this point Mr. Drinan and Mr. Thompson left the hearing 
room.) 
The CHAIRMAN. Counsel, do you have any further questions? 
Mr. SCHULTZ. No, I don't. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you very much for being here. 
Call your next witness. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Our next witness is Daina Palena, and she requests 
that her appearance not be on television, for fear of harm to her 
family in Latvia. 
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair will announce that this is the first time 
the proceedings of this hearing have been broadcast or televised, due 
to the rules of the House. However, the rules have been changed; 
televising and broadcasting of the hearings are now permitted. 
But the specific House rules do provide that the witness does have 
the right to request that he not be televised or broadcast. Therefore, in 
accordance with that rule, the Chair will have to acquiesce in the 
request of the next witness. So I would instruct the representatives of 
television and of radio to now please turn off your equipment. 
Did the request also apply to radio, Mr. Counsel? The Chair has no 
alternative except to acquiesce in the request, under the rules. I think 
perhaps you should contact her about radio. If she has no complaint 
against radio, we will let the recording proceed. 
Do you have your next witness here, Mr. Counsel? 
The witness has also objected to being on radio. Therefore, it will be 
necessary to turn off the recording equipment. 
Call your next witness. 
Mr. Scutum. Miss Daina Palena. 
Mr. Chairman, Miss Palena understands English very well, but was 
reluctant to try to testify in English. 
The CHAIRMAN. Will you please be seated.

Mr. Interpreter, do you solemnly swear that you will truly and 
accurately interpret the questions put to the witness and properly 
interpret the answers given throughout this testimony? 
Mr. SMITS. I do so swear.

TESTIMONY OF DAINA PALENA, AS INTERPRETED BY 
RUDOLPH SMITS 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Mr. Chairman, before questioning the witness, I 
would like to state briefly the history of Latvia and ask her if it is 
-correct. 
During the past 800 years, Latvia has been a free country for only 
20 years. The country was ruled successively by German, Polish, and 
Russian regimes until the end of World War I, when an independent 
republic was proclaimed. 
Despite a 1920 pact whereby the Soviet Union agreed to respect 
Latvian sovereignty, the country was again occupied by Soviet troops 
in 1940, a communist regime was installed, and the country was in-
corporated into the Soviet Union as the 15th republic of the U.S.S.R. 
Latvia was occupied by Germany from 1941 to 1945, and again 
returned to Russian rule after World War II. 
Is that substantially correct, Miss Palena? 
Miss. PALENA. Yes. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Would you state your full name or the record,: 
Miss PALENA. My name is Daina Paleria. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Where were you born? , 
Miss PALENA. I am born on 15 January in Sigulda, Latvia. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you attend school? 
Mr. SMITS. I attended elementary school in Latvia and also 
in-
completed attendance of high school.. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Were you a member of the communist. party youth 
group? 
MT. SMITS. NO. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Do you know what Komsomol is? . 
Mr. SMITS. I was a member of the Young Communist League for 
only 1 year because, for the most case, young people are forced to join 
this organization. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. What is the purpose of Komsomol? 
Mr. Smims. The purpose of the Young Communist League is to 
train future members of the party and make them conscientious sup-
porters of communism. 
(At this point Mr. Drinan and Mr. Thompson returned to the 
hearing room.) 
Mr. Scifuraz. Subsequent to leaving high school, did you seek 
additional educational training? 
Mr. SMITS. I joined the Riga Technical School, after completion of 
which I got a position as a telegraph-telephone operator. 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Counsel, at that point, the witness is not being 
televised; could we have someone turn off the lights? 
Proceed. 
Mr. Scurnirz. Subsequent to the training to become a telegraph 
operator, did you become gainfully employed? 
Mr. Smrrs. After completing these courses, I worked. for more than 
3Tyears. I was compelled to work by and for the Government. because 
the Government paid me while I was attending these courses.

Mr. SMITS. I worked as a telegraph and telephone operator. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Following this occupation, did you then seek another 
occupation? 
Mr. SMITS. After this, I got a position in the Fishing Administration. 
Mr. Scum,Tz. What type of job did you have? 
Mr. SMITS. I got a position on board ship as a stewardess. 
Mr. Scitunrz. How many other women were on board this ship? 
Mr. SMITS. Usually from seven to 10 or more. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Where did tins ship travel? 
Mr. SMITS. Usually this ship traveled from the North to South 
Atlantic. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. What countries did you visit? 
Mr. SMITS. Usually the ship stopped at the countries of Africa and 
Canada. Personally I was able to visit the Canary Islands and Canada. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. What type of ship was this? 
Mr. SMITS. This was a fishing ship, a fishing trawler. 
Mr. Smimirz. While you were on board this ship, were you required 
to attend political classes? 
1\4r. SMITS. We usually had political information courses two or 
three times a month. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Were you required to be a member of the communist 
party for your employment on this ship? 
Mr. SMITS. No, that was not imperative. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. You mentioned that you visited Africa and Canada. 
Were you allowed to go ashore? 
Mr. SMITS. Yes, we were allowed to go ashore in groups. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Were you allowed to visit with the residents of the 
country you were visiting? 
Mr. SMITS. Not without a permit. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Who would issue the permit? 
Mr. SMITS. Only the ship's captain could give that. 
Mr. Scutum. Now if 1 understand correctly, when you went 
ashore, you went ashore in groups, and you had to have a permit from 
the ship's captain to speak to or have discussions with the natives of 
the country you were visiting? 
Mr. SMITS. Not quite. We were allowed to ask directions, prices, 
and so on, but we were not allowed to get into political discussions 
with the natives. 
Mr. Scnunmz. I would like to offer her statement in the record 
following the testimony. 
The CHAIRMAN. is there any objection to the statement being 
inserted in the record following the witness' testimony? 
If not, the statement will be admitted into the record. 
Will you proceed. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Will you describe the circumstances surrounding 
your coming to the United States? 
Mr. SMITS. I was taken ill on board ship and with the aid of a 
Coast Guard helicopter I was taken to Staten Island. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. When did you first decide you wanted to stay in 
the United States? 
Mr. SMITS. A few days after regaining consciousness, I decided not 
to return.

Mr. SCHULTZ. Why did you decide not to go back to Latvia? 
Mr. SMITS. First of all, because I would have lost my previous 
employment. I might have been able to get a position, but at the 
present time there is a very critical situation in regard to housing in 
Latvia. And consequently, I would never have been able to get 
abroad anymore. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Are you in touch with your friends and family in 
Latvia at this time, or in correspondence? 
Mr. SMITS. I correspond only with my closest relatives but not 
with my friends, since that could have serious consequences for them. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Have you been able to send packages or any items to 
your friends or family since you have been here in the United States? 
Mr. SMITS. Yes, I did send parcels, but I don't know whether they 
received them or will receive them. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Is mail censored in Latvia? 
Mr. SMITS. Yes. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Miss Paella, I direct your attention to the items 
listed on the page and as appears on the screen. I would like to go 
down the items listed specifically in the Latvian Socialist Republic 
Constitution of 1940 and ask if you can identify for us those items 
which you experienced. 
Mr. SMITS. How would you want that expressed? 
The CHAIRMAN. I think you had better put the questions to her 
and let the interpreter relay the questions. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you have freedom of speech? 
Mr. Swum. No. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you have complete freedom of press? 
Mr. SMITS. No. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you have freedom of assembly? 
Mr. SMITS. Partially. 
A4r. SCHULTZ. Could you give us an example of the partial freedom 
for demonstration? Could you criticize the Government in a demon-
stration? 
Mr. SMITS. No never. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. No,
you have freedom of correspondence, freedom 
of writing? 
Mr. SMITS. Yes. 
Mr. Scinnzrz. Did you have freedom of religion? 
Mr. SMITS. No. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you have freedom of education? 
Mr. SMITS. Yes, complete. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you have freedom of the secret ballot? 
Mr. SMITS. Hew Shall I explain it? 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did they have elections? 
Mr. SMITS. Yes. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Could you vote without anyone else's knowing how 
you voted? 
Mr. SMITS. No. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. I may have misunderstood, but I thought you said 
you had complete freedom in education.

Miss PALENA. Yes. 
MT. SMITS. Yes. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Were the teachers allowed to teach from any book 
they so desired? 
Mr. SMITS. Of course not. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. The communist party controlled the textbooks in 
the school? 
Mr. SMITS. All methods of education were controlled by the 
Ministry of Education. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Then I did understand incorrectly. You did not have 
freedom of education? 
Mr. SMITS. I would just like to explain that anyone who wanted to 
go and study or have an education could do so; that is the way I 
wanted to explain it. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Can you describe for us the living conditions in 
Latvia concerning the availability and quality of food? 
Mr. SMITS. It varied from time to time; sometimes there was a 
shortage of food. When Khrushchev was our leader, there was a 
shortage of white bread, and very frequently we had to stand in line 
for food. 
I would like further to explain, however, I cannot complain of the 
circumstances in Latvia; because very many people from White 
Russia, neighboring White Russia, came to Latvia for bread and 
food. 
Sctrunmz. Where did you buy the dress that you are wearing? 
SMITS. I bought this suit in Latvia in a special seamen's store. 
Ir. SCHULTZ. Can anyone shop there, or only seamen? 
v1r. SMITS. Only seamen, upon presentation of their documents. 
Ir. SCHULTZ. How much did that suit cost? 
\ Ir. Siurrs. It cost about 125 rubles in Soviet money. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. How does that compare with money of this country, 
if you know? 
ill withdraw the question. 
Mr. SMITS. Roughly $92. 
Mr. ScHunm.z. How much were you paid each week or month while 
you were on board ship? 
Nit.. SMITS. Every month I received 200 rubles. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. SO your snit cost you approximately a half month's 
Pay? 
Mr. SMITS. We received a salary plus the so-called bonus which 
they gave us as a supplementary payment. 
Mr. Senuurz. Are all prices set by the Government? 
Mr. SMITS. Yes. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Is there any unemployment in Latvia? 
Mr. SMITS. No, anyone can work who wants to. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. You mentioned that after high school you attended 
a specialized school of training for the purpose of becoming a tele-
graph operator, and that subsequent to that, you went to work on a 
boat. 
Does the law require that everyone work in Latvia? 
Mr. SMITS. It is the honorable obligation of every Soviet citizen 
to work. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you have a choice in your study in preparing for 
a job, and also a choice for going to work on the fishing boat?

Mr. SMITS. Yes, but on board ship I was placed in a position where 
I was most needed. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. What happens to people that don't work?. 
Mr. SMITS. They are considered parasites, and of course they are 
compelled to work, because no one will pay them if they do not. And 
in the Soviet Union there is a law that specifies that he who shall not 
work shall not eat. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Do they have labor camps in Latvia? 
Mr. Smrrs. I am not informed whether such exists, 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Would you describe for us your houSe where you lived 
in Latvia? 
Mr. Slum's. When I lived with my parents, we had one room and a 
kitchen; that was all. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Was that one room and a kitchen for three people? 
Mr. SMITS. We were five people. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you own your own home? 
? Mr. SMITS. No, that was an apartment owned by the Government. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Do the people of Latvia have the right to own their 
own home, and do they own their homes? 
Mr. SMITS. They are allowed to own their homes, but if it exceeds 
a certain square feet then the property is confiscated. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Who owns the factories and businesses in Latvia? 
Mr. SmiTs. All industry and commerce belongs to the State. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. How are the workers paid? Is there an incentive 
program? 
Mr. SMITS. Their salary depends on the level of their education and 
from their category. - 
In regard to the question of housing, I would like to explain what 
conditions people live in. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Go ahead. 
Mr. Smrrs. Many people live in basement apartments and in con-
verted garages. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. How much rent would they pay for these basement 
apartments? 
Mr. Simms. The rent in general in the Soviet Union is not high. 
The only thing is, if I personally rent a room or a bed space. 
(At this point Mr. Ashbrook left the hearing room.) 
Mr. Sonuurz. Then it is expensive? 
Mr. SMITS. For instance, from my salary of 155 rubles I have to 
pay 10 rubles a month for my bed space. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Would you describe for us the educational system 
for students from high school up through college? 
Mr. SMITS. We are given a certain subject that we have to take, 
and if we choose a certain profession we have to follow that program 
as defined. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Is school mandatory up through any certain grade 
or age? 
Mr. SMITS. In the Soviet Union, education both in elementary 
school and in high school is mandatory. 
Mr. Son-min. Do you have a selection of courses? Could you 
study music, for instance, if you wanted to? 
Mr. SMITS. Yes, Of course.

Mr. Set-1mm. You mentioned having elections in Latvia. Does the 
party designate the candidate? 
Mr. SMITS. Only the party. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Can you vote "no"? 
Mr. SMITS. Of course not. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Would you describe the t'reedom to travel in Latvia, 
or outside the country? 
Mr. SMITS. 1 can freely travel throughout Latvia and throughout 
the Soviet Union, but if I want to travel abroad I have to have a 
special permit. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Who would issue this permit? The party? 
Mr. SMITS. 1 don't really know. 
Mr. Scumzrz. Can you tell us how the Latvian history is taught 
in the Latvian schools, before the Russians came and after? 
Mr. SMITS. They taught us that Lativa had become a backward 
uountry and was exploited by the bourgeoisie, and that is the reason 
why the working people and the common people were struggling for 
a better future. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. What are your observations about living in this 
country? 
Mr. SMITS. My observations and conclusions are that people live 
in far better conditions here. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Could she discuss freely with her relatives and 
neighbors ideas about the Government or her own personal philoso-
phies while living in Latvia? 
Mr. Slum's. Of course, with my close relatives and close friends 
whom I could trust I could carry on such discussions, but relative 
strangers would not get into such discussions at all. 
My. SCHULTZ. To what extent does religion prevail in Latvia? 
Mr. SMITS. On the surface it appears that there, is a freedom of 
religion, but from my personal observations I have noticed that many 
churches have either been converted to museums or simply abandoned 
altogether. 
The CHAIRMAN. Let me intervene at this point, Mr. Counsel. 
How long do you expect your questioning to continue? 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Just a couple of minutes. 
The CuAiumAN. Proceed, and I will then let the members question. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Would you describe for us if there are trade unions 
in Latvia? 
Mr. Smirs. Yes, there are trade unions in Latvia, and most workers 
are members of them and they pay their dues. 
Mr. Scnuurz. Just one final question: How does the citizen of 
Latvia show his concern or discontent for the communist party, 
if he feels that way? 
Mr. SMITS. Of course, they can't express themselves, but they are 
indifferent to slogans, to speeches, and so on. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. That would conclude my questioning, Mr. Chairman, 
and I ask that the full detailed statement be entered in the record. 
The CHAIRMAN. That has been done, Mr. Counsel.

STATEMENT. OF DA1NA PALENA 
My name is Daina Palona. I was born January 13, 1945, in Sigulda, Latvia: 
I attended primary school and two years of high school, but did not complete 
high school in Latvia. I then went to a technical school in Riga, Latvia, to study? 
to be a telegraph operator. I worked more than three years near Riga and then 
applied to go aboard a ship as a member of the crew. I remained on a ship for two 
and one-half (2) years. I decided that I would like to work on a ship because this 
would give me an opportunity to travel abroad, which I otherwise would not have. 
When I decided to apply for this position, they checked my background. I was 
cleared by Komsomol and by the labor union. This took approximately two 
months. While on the ship I traveled all over the Atlantic; however, did not go to 
any West European country. We did stop in Africa and in Canada. I did not 
belong to the Communist Party. I was a member of Komsomol for one year but 
left as I had been forced to join against my wishes. I was a member of the Pioneers, 
a young youth group. While on the ship I worked in the kitchen and as a waitress: 
I held a seaman's passport. On the ship we did have a political officer and were 
required to attend political classes two or three times each month. Studies con-
sisted of Marxism and Leninism and the story of the revolution and economics in 
Soviet Russia. When we visited countries such as Canada we were allowed to go 
ashore in groups, and we were to remain with these groups. We were not supposed 
to discuss anything with the people of the country we visited. We could ask 
directions, prices, etc., but were not to engage in discussion with them. 
On April 8, 1970, I took an overdose of sleeping-tablets for reasons of my own. 
I became very ill; the doctor on the ship thought I had appendicitis or something 
and feeling that I would die, radioed for help. At that time we were several hun-
dred miles south of New York, and a helicopter from the United States came to 
the ship and took me to a hospital on the mainland. Approximately 10 days later, 
when I came out of the coma, and recovered my memory; I decided that I did 
not wish to return to Latvia. I told this to the doctor, and several days later I was 
visited by a representative of the Soviet Embassy. I told him that I did not wish 
to return home to Latvia. The ship involved was a Soviet trawler, and we were 
engaged in fishing. To the best of my knowledge this was the only purpose of the 
ship. We repeatedly took our catch to a mother ship when our ship became filled, 
and then we returned to fishing. While aboard the ship, I did not have any inten-
tion of escaping to the United States. I knew nothing about the United States, 
and it was only after I awoke in the hospital that I decided I should never go back 
for several reasons: first, I would not be allowed to retain my job on the ship; 
secondly, I would never again get a chance to go abroad; and thirdly it would 
be very difficult for Inc to find a place to live; and mostly I don't want to live 
under Russian rule and suppression as everyone does in Latvia. I want to be free 
and to have rights as an individual. 
Concerning conditions in Latvia, food is always in somewhat short supply, 
and very expensive. For example, a kilogram of butter?that is, 2.2 lbs.?costs 
approximately 3 rubles, 50 kopeks. Earlier, it was only 2 rubles, 80 kopeks. As 
a telegraph operator, I made 35 rubles per month. All prices are set by the govern-
ment, that is, they are the same in all the stores. Most of the food available was 
produced in Latvia; however, some of it was imported from other sections of the 
Soviet Union, Poland, Germany, and Czechoslovakia. 
There is no unemployment in Latvia. You have to work in order to live. The 
law requires that a person work. Everyone has a job. If you cannot work because 
you are physically disabled, you can be taken care of by the state, but it is very 
difficult. My mother was unable to work; she was sick and old and had to receive 
a pension. It was very difficult to obtain this. She had to find people Who could 
testify that she had worked before, and how well she had worked. This was up to 
her to find these people. In Latvia we do not have any welfare system such as I 
see here in the United States. I know of no forced labor camps in Latvia; however, 
most of the people who are sent to labor camps work in the Soviet Union?Siheria, 
and other sections of Russia. 
I lived with my parents until I went to work. At that time I had to find my 
own place to live. Housing is very difficult to obtain in Latvia. Frequently several 
families live in one room. If one is not married, you have to share a room with 
many other persons who may be strangers. The family rooms in the older homes 
have only one kitchen and one bathroom for several rooms, each one having 
several families. I have never lived in the newer apartments, but they are also

34 
very crowded. If you formerly owned your own home, and the government de-
cided that you have too much room, they can put other people in your house to 
live. All new property is owned by the state. All factories are owned by the state. 
No one even dreams of owning one. A person can own only a small plot of ground 
to raise vegetables on. The only privately owned homes are those which have 
been owned for many, many years. Rent of an apartment is not high, but often 
you must pay a sum of money to obtain such an apartment. Sometimes this 
runs as high as several thousand rubles. For the single person, you would pay 
mavbe 5 to 10 rubles for bed space in a dormitory-type system. 
Almost no one owns an automobile in Latvia. If you could save enough money 
to buy one, it would take years to obtain it. Quite a few people have radios or 
television sets in Latvia, however. On the radio we Can listen to stations all over 
Europe. I have listened to the BBC from England, the Voice of America, as well 
as German stations. Most of the TV sets are made in Russia. In Riga we can 
receive stations in Riga and in Leningrad. I do not remember exactly how many 
stations,?I believe two or three?but it has been many years since I had occasion 
to listen to the TV. It used to be prohibited at one time to listen to the BBC or 
Voice of-Ainerica on the radio. However, this is no longer true. 
In Latvia, nearly all teachers in schools are members of the Communist Party. 
All books must be approved by the Education Ministry. The only foreign books 
available are non-political ones. Schooling is required of all children through 
eight years of prirnary school and three years of high school. High school used to 
be mandatory for only two years. Russians still only have to go two years to 
high school. There is no tuition in school. This also includes the university. The 
only charges are-for books and supplies. Some students in the university receive 
some money from the government to attend school. For example, while I was 
attending the technical school, I received 20 rubles per month from the govern-
ment. I believe that a student can attend school up to four years at the university. 
Then unless he especially skilled in a particular subject, he must leave school 
and find a job. As I said before, there is no unemployment, and the government 
will find-him a job. 
should like to comment on elections and political activities in Latvia. 
All citizens who are not criminals can vote at 1S years of age. To vote, you go to 
the voting place, pick up your ballot, and drop it in the ballot box. You can mark 
it or not, as you wish. It makes iio difference. Very few people mark their ballots, 
as the government has already decided who will be elected. For the most part, 
people are not interested in who wins an election. The government knows who is 
best for the 'people in this system, and there is only one political party?the 
Communist Party. Most people want only enough to eat and a place to live. If 
they have this, they are satisfied. Elections in Latvia are not like elections in this 
country. I do not know of any difficulties in elections in Latvia. Even if a person 
tore up his ballot, I don't think anything would happen to him. Someone would 
probably ask him why he did this, and would talk to him about it, but that is all I 
think would happen. 
While in Latvia everyone belongs to a trade union; the function of these unions 
is to speak to the workers for the government. They arrange for vacations, pay-
ment when you are sick, and a pension when you can no longer work. They are 
never involved in strikes, as I see here in this country. Any strikers in Latvia would 
go to jail or to a labor camp in Russia. I might also say that in Latvia the govern-
ment decides what work you will do, because they know where they can best use 
your skills. If you do not like your job, you can ask to be given another one, and 
if your reasons are good enough, they may move you. This is how I went to work 
on the ship. They must have needed waitresses, so I was given the job. I was not 
used as a radio operator on the ship, because I had not been trained in that type 
of work. 
I have not seen the Latvian constitution, but I am sure that they have one 
since the laws and rights of the people must be based upon something. I noticed 
that in Latvia the trials of persons for crimes are never mentioned in the papers, 
or on the radio, as it is in this country. In Latvia we have a security or secret 
police which watches the people to enable the government to understand what 
they are thinking. I think they also investigate smuggling, etc. They wear civilian 
clothing and are composed of both Latvians and Russians. The only time I know 
or heard of them arresting someone was someone arrested for smuggling literature 
into the country. 
Religion is prohibited for all party members, and children are taught that there 
is no God. Some people still go to church, but they are mostly the older people. 
Most Latvians, I believe, belonged to the Lutheran church. There are now quite

a few Jews in Latvia. Many came from Russia after the war. The Russians do 
not like them, and most Latvians also dislike them. 
- When it comes to travel, ? any Latvihn can travel All over Russia-without' a 
permit. We all have passports which are alto - mi identity card. This..passport 
cannot be used outside of Latvia:or .Russia. I had a seaman's passport, which I 
still have. It was sent with my other documents to the hospital. 
I notice that here in the United -States there is frequent student dissent Or 
demonstrations. We never have that in Latvia. A student can do it, of course, 
but since it is illegal he would have.to think of the consecnienceS. He would_ be 
tried and sent to jail or a corrective labor camp. I can remember. one Latvian 
leader who spoke out against the system. Hc. was exiled to Siberia and has 'net 
yet returned. The newspapers never mention these. matters. They do talk a great 
deal about foreign spies, however, and everyone is cautioned to be on the lookout 
for them. 
Latvian history as it is taught in the schools tells us that Latvia before. the 
. Russians came was very bad. The people were very poor and the leaders were all 
fascists. I found this very interesting, now that I am free to read the history of 
Latvia as it really was. This proves to me that the Russians change history as it 
is taught to suit their own needs. We are taught that we are Latvians and Soviet 
citizens. 
Most people in Latvia just don't care about politics or anything else except a 
place to live and enough food to eat. Now that I am in this country, I feel very 
different. Here I am no longer afraid to talk to people about -how I feel about 
things, because I know that they will not run to the police. I do not worry about 
living conditions, and having enough to eat. I think that people here should be 
very happy, but they don't know how things are in other places. Hero theyhave 
so many opportunities. Nobody controls you, watches what you are doing, or 
where you are going. It is almost another world. Here some people have almost 
too much freedom. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you, Miss Palena, for your appearance here 
this morning. 
I doubt if you are aware of it, but immediately after the story hit 
the press concerning your removal from the Russian fishing ship, a 
young Latvian from my district, whose name is Lyins Bergmanis, 
called me and asked that I contact the appropriate executive officials 
to make certain that you did receive asylum in this country. He-was 
very much concerned about what would happen to you if you were 
not granted asylum. I was very happy to contact the executive officials 
and very glad to learn that you were granted asylum. 
Mr. SMITS. I would like to express my sincere thanks to the United 
States Government, and also to the doctors who saved my life, for 
all the efforts they have ,done. 
The CHAIRMAN. Mr. Bergmanis happened to reside in a village 
nearby where she lived in Latvia. 
Mr. SMITS. That is very pleasant. 
The CHAIRMAN. My question is this: What does she think would 
have happened to her if she had not been granted asylum? 
Mr. Smims. In case I had not been granted asylum, I would Mune-
?diately have been arrested and given over to trial. 
The CHAIRMAN. Trial for what? 
Mr. SMITS. A trial that I had been a 'traitor to my native country 
and that I had contacted our enemies. 
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Indiana, do you have ?any 
?questions? ? 
Mr. ZION. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. 
-Miss Palena, thank you so much for your testimony, and we are 
very pleased to have you here. 
You mentioned in your statement that you were forced to join the 
Komsomol. As I understand, that is the Young Communist League. 
Is that correct?

Mr. SMITS. YeS. 
Mr. ZION. What sort of pressure is put on a young student to join 
an organization such as that? 
Mr. SMITS, When I attended the technical school, the secretary of 
the Young Communist League came into our class and put a pile of 
application blanks on the table and said everyone has to fill out these 
application blanks and sign them up to a certain date. No one is asked 
whether they believe in the ideology of the league or not. 
Mr. ZION. Do you have any idea what might have happened had 
you not signed the application? 
Mr. SMITS. I don't think anything would have happened because 
some actually did refuse to sign and nothing happened to them. 
Mr. ZION. When you were in an American hospital here, you 
mentioned that you were visited by representatives of the Soviet 
Union. Was there any implied or any specific pressure put upon you 
to return to some satellite of the Soviet Union? 
(At this point Mr. Drinan left the hearing room.) 
Mr. SMITS. Of course, I would have had to return to my own country, 
and they did try to persuade me to go back. 
Mr. ZION. What methods of persuasion did they use? 
Mr. SMITS. First of all, they wanted to have me transferred to 
another hospital where my fellow Latvians could not have attended 
me, and only members?I would have been completely isolated, and 
only members of the Soviet Embassy would have been able to visit me. 
Mr. ZION. I thank the lady for her cooperation. 
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Georgia. 
(At this point Mr. Preyer left the hearing room.) 
Mr. TEIOMPSON. You were speaking of the housing situation in 
Latvia, and you gave in your statement that one of the reasons that 
you would not want to return is that you find it difficult to obtain a 
place to live. 
Would it be more difficult because of the fact that you had been 
taken to a hospital in the United States, or was that just that it would 
be difficult, period? 
Mr. SMITS. That is a problem in general in Latvia, housing. 
Mr. THOMPSON. SO it relates to just housing in general, and not 
because of the fact that you had been in the United States? 
Mr. SMITS. This is just one of the elements of why I remained here. 
I would rather explain in detail why I decided to remain. 
Mr. THOMPSON. Since you have made the decision to remain here, 
have you had any communications with your family back in Latvia? 
Mr. SMITS. I correspond regularly with them. 
Mr. TnomrsoN. Does there appear to be any censorship in the 
correspondence? 
Mr. SMITS. Definitely censorship. 
Mr. THOMPSON. Do you know whether or not your .family is in a 
precarious position because of the fact that you have elected to 
remain here in the United States? - 
Mr. Sivirrs. They themselves_ are not threatened because the decision 
was mine, purely personally, and I did it without getting in contact 
with them about it.

the Voiceof America or the BBC or Radio Free Europe? 
Mr. SMITS. Yes, you can receive that with any radio set there. 
Mr. THOMPSON. Would you have any knowledge, since you have 
elected to remain in the United States, whether there has been any 
attempt to remove the freedom they have of 'having a radio? 
Mr. SMITS. In the earlier years it was Strictly forbidden to listen to 
broadcasts from abroad. But people disregarded that prohibition and 
did it on the QT, and even now they do it. 
Mr. THOMPSON. The point I am getting around to making is that 
recall, of course, the incidents in the news when you were flown by 
helicopter to the hospital. Did your family hear over the BBC or 
Radio Free Europe or Radio America that you had been flown to a 
hospital here, and did they communicate that to you by letter? 
Mr. SMITS. I don't really know because it stands to reason we 
cannot ask or answer such questions in letters. But I assume that 
they did know about it because if they didn't hear it on the radio, 
the neighbors would have and would have told them. 
Mr. Tnomps ON. That is all. 
The CHAIRMAN. Thank you. 
The gentleman from California. 
Mr. Scmurrz. In this country we have a youth movement which is; 
marked by perhaps an amine criticim of what they call the repression 
in the United States and an undue sympathy with the communist, 
systems. 
My question is: If you have been hare long enough to have observed 
this, would you care to pass on a message to the young people of this, 
country who fall into that category? 
Mr. SMITS. I have not lived here long enough to be able to delve. 
deeply enough into all of these problems. But one thing I can say is. 
that they don't know, the American youth does not know, what. 
communism means and what it means to live under a communist.. 
regime. They don't know how the laws there are applied. These slogans, 
and speeches may sound beautiful on the surface, but there is some-
thing much deeper below it. 
r.NI  S C IIMI'T Z. Th itIik you. 
The CHAIRMAN. Are there any further questions of :Miss Palena? 
Thank you again, Miss Palena, for your appearance here today. 
and thank you, '7Vitr. Smits. 
Mr. Smits, we did have you identified by name, but I think we. 
should have perhaps some further identifications as to your qualitica,--
tions to interpret. What is your present position? 
Mr. Smits. I am. a library information system.s specialist in the 
Library of Congress. 
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair wishes to announce that Some of the? 
young journalists, the editors of the high. school newspapers, have 
requested the opportunity to meet with me. I will be happy to do so, 
immediately upon adjournment M the room of the (thief counsel. I 
will be happy to answer any questions that you might have.

Mr. BLEY. Villa Park in Illinois. 
Mr. ScifULTZ. How long have you been in the United States? 
Mr. B1EY. I immigrated to the United States in 1961. 
Mr. ScHunrz. Where were you born? 
Mr. BLEY. I was born in Bitterfeld, which is now East Germany. 
Mr. SCHriurz. How long did you live in Germany? 
Mr. linny. In East Germany, up until 1955; 1961 I came to the 
Tilited States. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Would you describe for us briefly the living condi-
tions in East Germany in 1955? 
Mr. BLEY. In 1945 we were conquered by the Russians, which was a 
horror. In 1948 the East German Republic, communist republic, was 
established with strict laws. There was no private ownership allowed 
any more. People got arrested. Farmers got arrested. It was actually 
like, a dictatorship and I didn't. see any future for myself, and so I left. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. What was your occupation at that time? 
Mr. Bun-. I was world n9: as a toolmaker. 
Mr. Sc EITTLTZ. Where did you work? 
Mr. BLEY. In a factory which my uncle had still owned at. this time. 
It was confiscated in 1955. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Was it. in 1955 that you decided to leave East 
Germany ? 
Mr. Brxy. Yes. 
r. SciirTnTz. How did you leave East Germany? 
Mr. BLEY. Well, I took a train to East Berlin and crossed over to 
West Berlin. About 2,000 to 3,000 people just (lid the same thing every 
day. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. There were no restrictions on travel at that time? 
Mr. BLEY. There were checks by the communist police and people 
got dragged out, got arrested; not too many escaped. Quite a few got 
. through. I was one of the lucky ones. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Did you have to make extensive preparations to leave? 
Mr. BLEY. No, not at all. I left one day, just with a small suitcase. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. When did you come to the United States? 
Mr. BLEY. June .1, 1961. 
Mr. Scutum. Would you describe for us briefly what you have done 
since you have been in the United States? 
Mr. BLEY. I came, my wife, Marlis, and myself, on June 1, 1961. 
We lived with a friend who was our sponsor for 4 weeks. We got an 
apartment in Chicago. I started work as a toolmaker. I changed jobs, 
hut T always had one goal, to get my own business started. 
Instead of going to luxury, I bought some machine tools and opened 
up a little shop, a part-time. business in a garage, which worked out. 
very good, and through changing jobs, various jobs, I got into a posi-
tion in 1966 and started in full-time business. 
MT. SCHULTZ. Do you have a full-time business today? 
Mr. BLEY. Yes, sir. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Is this a successful business? 
Mr. BLEY. Yes, we have 17 employees now. 
Arr. SCHULTZ. Could you explain for us how the development of this 
business came about in the United States and what you perceive it 
might have been in East Germany?

Mr. BLEy. It would have been impossible in East Germany. There 
are no new businesses established at all. Everything is Government 
controlled. The best you can do is get as a manager of a branch of a 
state-owned factory. That is the best you can do. 
Now in this country you just go ahead. Either you succeed or you 
go under. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Mr. Bley, you, the latter part of 1970, assisted your 
brother Karl in coming to this country. Could you tell us a little about 
your preparations for this escape of your brother ? 
Mr. BLEy.. Yes, because T lived myself under communism. I had a 
younger brother left back there who couldn't leave because the Berlin 
wall was put up in 1961, and I knew how he felt about getting out, 
being a free man. 
So he took a trip to Cuba in 1968, and I knew he was going to Cuba 
to escape, to try something. So I went to Miami and tried to help him, 
but there was no way out. I didn't even know which way the boat was 
going. I couldn't help Karl. Karl couldn't escape. 
He went back and wrote a letter which way he was going. It sur-
prised me when I heard he was going right by the American shores, 
by Miami, by Key West, and I mentioned to him that he might try 
the same thing again. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Could you describe for us generally the plans that 
you set up in Miami to assist your brother? 
Mr. BLEY. Yes. The original plan was to have airplane surveillance 
to spot the V oetkerfreundRchaft, the ship that Karl would be on, as it 
was coming through the Bahamas and down to Cuba. Then we were 
going to (ref, the boats close to the communist ship. Ken Agnew was 
the pilot of the plane. Then Karl would jump and we would pick him 
up. That was the original plan. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. When did you actually fish your brother out of the 
ocean? 
Mr. BLEy. November 27, 1970, 7 :45 a.m. 
Mr. SCHTLTZ. Mr. Bley, I show you a photograph. Would you de-
scribe to the committee who the people are an the date or the time 
interval involved in the photograph ? ' 
Mr. BLEy. Yes. On the left is myself as we are planning the escape. 
Bob Lowe is in the center of the picture and the pilot, Ken Agnew, 
who was taking care of air reconnaissance. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Could you tell us the circumstances surrounding this 
second photograph? 2 
Mr. Bim. This picture was taken 1 day after the escape with all 
the people involved, like Ken Agnew, who was piloting one plane; 
Goon-To Butler, another plane; myself; and my wife. 
When I picked Karl out of the, ocean, three others saw the oppor-
tunity and they jumped. They are Dr. Peter Rost, Dr. Manfred Kupfer, 
and Dr. Reinhold Kupfer. 
Mr. SCHULTZ. I understand, Mr. Bley, that the doctors that you just 
mentioned were not part of the escape plans of your brother Karl? 
Mr. BLEy. No, they didn't know anything about it. It is just the 
urge for freedom of those people, and I think that at least 25 percent 
on the boat would go if they had the chance.

Mr. SCHULTZ.. Mr. Chairman, we have a detailed statement for Erich, 
which I ask be included in the record. ? ' 
We also have a 2-minute film which was made of the escape. I would 
like to ask that it be, shown at this time. 
The CHAIRMAN. The statement has been furnished to the members 
of the committee, has it not, Mr. Counsel? 
Mr. ?SciiimTz?. Yes, sir. 
The CHAIRMAN. There being no objection, the statement will be in-
cluded in the record. 
(The statement follows:) 
STATEMENT OF ERICH BLEY 
My name is Erich Bley. I was born June 28, 1934 in Bitterfeld, East Germany. 
I grew tip in Magdeburg, East Germany, which ib located approximately 60 
miles southwest Of Berlin. My occupation was that Of toolmaker, and I had also 
been' attending engineering school at the time of my escape from East GerLaany. 
Un October 29, 1955, I escaped via Berlin to'. West Germany. My escape was 
relatively easy at that time, because there was an almost free- flow of traffic 
between the various sectors. 
Walter Ulbricht was already running the East German state with an iron 
and- bloody fist, although 'Wilhelm Pieek was the official leader of the country. 
The standard of living in East Germany during the 50's was much lower than 
it is now. The economy, however, was controlled in the same manner then as it 
is at this time. The state had been in the process of taking over private industry 
since J948. 
All factories, except some very small ones, were oiled by the state. They had 
such, high taxes lev!ed on them that the owners were unable to pay them. Con-
sequently; the state took part ownership of the factory as payment for these taxes. 
This allowed the .state to control production and activities. In cases where the 
state met with opposition, arrests were made. 
TTnemployment did not exist in East Germany. Private employers had to pay 
lower wages to their employees and the state lured their employees away. There 
was no punishment for not working by sending people to forced labor camps in 
1955. These camps were reserved for those convicted of other crimes. One, who 
did not work, just didn't. eat. 
There was and still is a marked difference between labor unions in East Ger-
many and in the United States. For one thing, there was no strike privilege. 
Also. they were not interested in obtaining wage increases or retirement benefits 
or such. 
In the 50's there were still privately owned farms. However, these were soon 
consolidated into LPG's?Litudwittschaftliche Produktions Gemeinschaft (Agri-
cultural Production Combine). 
The housing shortage was acute in 1955. New apartments were available to 
party members only. Private home ownership was difficult, since the cost of .re-
pairs and taxes made It a great burden. The home I lived in with my parents 
and brothers had been in our family for over 200 years. Our quarterly -taxes 
amounted to about 250 Marks, which was very high when. one considers that the 
average monthly wage was 350 to 400 Marks. 
Consumer goods at that time were extremely difficult to obtain. Very little 
was being imported from Eastern European countries, because they did not have 
anything of their Own. Nothing at all came from the West. A skilled worker 
earned 500 Mark-per' month. The price of a snit was 1,000 Marks; a bicycle 
cost 700 Marks; one pound of butter 20 Marks; one pound of coffee 40 marks. 
In East Germany the entire economic system was dictated by the party. The 
party- decided what was to be produced, in what quantities, and how the labor 
force of tile country was to be utilized. The party also decided what kind of Work 
a person was to do; this depended on the need for certain kinds of jobs at the 
time. 
Schooling was mandatory for all children in the state from pre-school up to 10 
years of grammar school and high school. In the eases of mothers working in 
industry, there were day care centers for children from 2 to 4 years of age. The 
factory nurseries and subsequent schools did a thorough job of educating their

43 
charges to Communism. At 4 years of age a child entered kindergarten, which was 
followed by 10 years of grammar -school,. Attendance at a university Was free for 
those who could qualify to work toward an education which would be beneficial 
to the state. The curriculum, all textbooks, as well as research conducted at the 
universities bad to be approved by the state. There was absolutely no intellectual 
freedom. - 
Court cases were processed swiftly and the press was not invited to attend any 
trials, except very important ones which were held in Berlin. Local political 
hearings, which resulted in numerous jail sentences, were held behind closed 
doors. Defense attorneys could be retained, and if a defendant did not have the 
necessary funds; such an attorney was appointed. When the charge was an offense 
against the state, which- the Ministry for State Security brought against the de-
fendant, this was an impossible situation for a lawyer to appeal. Informants for 
the secret police were planted everywhere: in major railroad stations, factories, 
clubs, etc. 
Everyone in East Germany required an identity document. This had to accom-
pany him everywhere and was, in fact, his passport for travel throughout East 
Germany. 
East Germany had no army in 1955, only the Volkspolizei (People's Police), 
which was like an army. There was no draft law at that time, and joining was 
"voluntary." This meant that if you did not join, you could not go to college. 
The election process in East Germany was mainly for propaganda. There were 
several political parties; however, all were dominated by the Socialist Unity 
Party (SED), the former Communist Party of Germany. In an election, there 
was one ballot with one person listed for each position. After picking up your 
ballot, you could go into a booth to mark it. However, persons entering these 
booths were subject to suspicion, because the ballots were to be dropped into the 
ballot box unmarked. There was no reason to mark the ballot, because the govern-
ment had already chosen the candidates they Wanted to win. 
The East German government considered the church "our most organized 
enemy." Attending the denomination of one's choice only reaped reprisals, such 
as depriving a person of job opportunities. Persons who belonged to Jehovah's 
Witnesses sect were especially persecuted. They were arrested, because that faith 
is outlawed. 
Before the Berlin wall was built, between 2,000 and 3,000 persons escaped from 
East Germany every day. In 1955 there were no minefields or barbed wire at the 
border. However, guards did patrol the area constantly. People could move fairly 
easily from East to West Berlin and vice versa. However, if there was the slight-
est suspicion that someone was planning to escape from East Germany, that 
Person was arrested. 
There were no visiting privileges into eastern countries, but some permits were 
granted to persons who desired to travel to the West. Most visitors remained 
in the West. 
Since my brother, Karl Heinz, was old enough, I have tried to help him es-
cape from East Germany. In 1968 we tried to arrange his escape, and planned 
how it actually was to be carried out. Definite plans for the escape were final-
ized in the summer of 1970. 
On November 27, 1970, 1 fished my brother; Karl Heinz, out of the water 
after a wild chase. I saw a laughing, happy face, his arms were stretched out 
to the line I had thrown to him. We also picked up three other men who had 
taken their chances and jumped to freedom. 
I feel that helping my brother escape was my biggest accomplishment. We 
have defeated Communism in our own private way. 
After immigrating to the United States in 1961, I worked for various small 
companies. I always had one goal in mina, to start my own business. In 1962, 
my wife and I bought our own home. The lot was big enough to erect a work-
shop building on it. 
While working 2 jobs most of the time and sacrificing our private luxury, 
building our own furniture, I bought a used 13 x 36" lathe, then a drill press, 
and later a small milling machine. By this time I was working for Motorola. 
Inc. in Franklin Park, Illinois, as a toolmaker. After one year I was promoted 
to foreman for the night shift, which allowed me time during the day to hustle 
for work. 
I wish to point out that all of this would have been impossible under East 
German dictatorship. Even in West Germany it would have been more difficult, 
because of economic conditions.

After one year in supervision at Motorola, I was promoted to design work 
in the Engineering Department. After another year, in 1966, my part time busi-
ness had increased to a level where I had to quit my job with Motorola in 
order to concentrate on a promising business. 
We expanded and bought more machines and tools. My wife was my sales-
man. With a sample case she got some more accounts, Continental Can and 
Ilorg-Warner. 
With business increasing we had to move out of our backyard shop and 
rented an 1800 foot space in Elk Grove, Illinois. As we moved in with 2 employees 
and a few machines, the place looked empty. We were building special machin-
ery tools and fixtures. Three years later, in 1969, the place was overcrowded 
with equipment and employees. We had to move out and I bought the 5000 foot 
building in which we are now located, at 690 Greenleaf, Elk Grove, Illinois. 
As of now, we are a group of 15 working here. In addition to building special 
ma chine.s, I have developed our own product. This is a patented mechanical hy-
draulic Arbor Press which will be introduced at the Philadelphia SME Show 
next month. 
I would like to point, out that credit for the fast growth of our company can-
not only be given to our efforts, but also to the tremendous opportunities which 
this country has to offer. 
Our example should be a lesson to those who are denouncing their country. 
The CHAIRMAN. There being no objection, you may proceed with 
the showing of the film. 
(At this point the film was shown.) 
Mr. SCHULTZ. Mr. Bley, if you would like to make comments while 
this is on, please do so. 
Mr. Br,Ey. This picture was taken just before the jump. Karl jumped 
off the second deck in the rear. 
The CHAIRMAN. Can you tell us who took the picture, Mr. Bley ? 
Mr. Bir,. The picture was taken by Ken Agnew, who was piloting 
the, plane. Karl jumped off the second deck on the right side. There 
are all kinds of people there. 
This is right after the pick up. That is Karl in the red shirt in the 
boat and the three others. It was a most joyous group.
