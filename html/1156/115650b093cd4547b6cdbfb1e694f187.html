 OF IMMEDIATE INTEREST
 MIDDLE EAST. DEVELOPMENTS
 Jordan:   Political
 Egypt and Syria,  together
 with antimonarchical Jordanian
 nationalist groups inside and
 outside of Jordan,             have launched
 an.all-out attack on King Hus-
 sain.   Cairo and Damascus radio
 broadcasts as well as agent and
 fedayeen actions from Syria are
 aimed at instigating demonstra-
 tions and strikes.   Egypt and
 Syria hope to develop a situa-
 tion in which the king will be
 compelled to use force to main-
 tain order, thus alienating him
 and his loyal troops from the
 bulk of the West Jordan and
 urban population.
 King Hussain met this chal-
 lenge on 24-25 April by appoint-
 ing a new cabinet,  nominally
 headed by a Ibrahim Hashim, a
 73-year-old elder statesman. The
 real leader of the cabinet., how-
 ever,          is Samir Rifai, deputy
 prime minister and foreign min-
 ister, a relatively forceful
 pro-Western politician
 The king has de-
 clared martial law throughout
 the country, imposed a curfew
 in major towns, and decreed the
 dissolution of all political
 parties.
 The latest developments
 were precipitated by the. king's
 appointment of a council of
 army officers to investigate
 loyalty in the army, and by his
 replacement of nationalist. of-
 ficers with Bedouin officers
 loyal to the crown.   These moves
 and the arrest of   several
 antimonarchical "free officers"
 led to the flight of the newly
 appointed army chief of staff,

 Two infantry brigades and
 the all-important armored bri-
 gade are located in the vicin-

 from Amman.   The fighting per-

 mostly loyal to the king.   Two

 the political loyalty of these
 units and their officers is un-
 certain.   The artillery brigade
 is split among the four in-
 fantry brigades.
 Additional forces in West
 Jordan are 7,600 men of the
 frontier corps deployed along
 the armistice line,  and up to
 18,000 men in national guard
 units.   These force: are an
 organized militia
 equipped primarily
 with small arms.
 Their loyalty to the
 king is questionable.
 Saudi Arabia

 troops in Jordan
 west of Amman near
 the Jordan River.
 An additional 4,000
 Saudi troops are de-
 ployed adjacent to
 the Aqaba area in
 northwest Saudi
 Arabia.
 A Syrian  ar-
 mored brigade of
 3,000 men is located
 at Mafraq, north of
 Amman near the Syr-
 ian border.                 While

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 25 April 1957
 paramilitary Nahal personnel,
 with at least one-year train-
 ing, in border settlements.        In
 its present status of limited
 mobilization, Israel has four
 of its 23 brigades at full
 strength--at Eilat,  Beersheba,
 Tel Aviv and Haifa.   Israel
 could mobilize about 200,000
 men within 48 hours, however.
 On 24 April the American army
 attache in Tel Aviv reported
 signs of limited mobilization.
 Israeli chief of staff Moshe
 Dayan is reported to have cut
 short his European vacation to
 return to Israel on 25 April.
 Cairo's amended declara-
 tion on the operation of the
 Suez Canal, sent to UN Secre-
 tary General Hammarskjold for
 deposit as an international
 instrument, contains some ad-
 justments in language but no
 essential changes from the
 statement issued in March.
 Egypt remains the sole author-
 ity on the operation of the
 canal and the sole collector of
 tolls in authorized currencies.
 Lip service is paid the
 "six principles" of last Octo-
 ber in the covering letter from
 Egypt to the UN; the Egyptians
 balked at including anything
 about these principles in the
 text of the declaration, since
 Nasr said he feared a trap and
 asserted that Egypt's interpre-
 tation of the principles clearly
 differed from that of Britain or
 France.
 The Egyptians have insisted
 that they genuinely recognize
 the necessity of establishing
 confidence among the users and
 the need to work in co-operation
 with maritime interests.   They
 are loath, however,  to engage
 in any government-to-govern-
 went negotiations, on the ground
 that such meetings on canal
 operations might derogate from
 Egyptian sovereignty.   Private
 commercial interests would al-
 so presumably be much easier
 to deal with.
 Behind Egypt's reluctance
 to extend recognition to any
 kind of users' association in-
 volving government representa-
 tion, there almost certainly lies
 primarily an implicit commit-
 ment that Egypt would enter a
 multilateral international con-
 ference on the canal only if
 the Soviet Union were included.
 Meanwhile, the first Brit-
 ish- and American-flag vessels
 have passed through the canal;
 the level of canal operations
 has remained low, however, with
 fewer than 20 ships per day
 making the trip compared to be-
 tween 30 and 45 before hostil-
 ities.   The American report to
 the Security Council, scheduled
 for :26 April, may well be the
 signal for a substantial in-
 crease in the use of the canal,
 despite the French government's
 attempts to maintain a boycott.
 With vessels of major mari-
 time nations again using the
 canal,  the Israelis are faced
 with a decision as to when, if,
 and how they may implement their
 claim that Israeli-flag vessels
 as well as non-Israeli vessels
 headed to or from Israel pass
 through the canal on an equal
 basis with non-Israeli shipping.
 The Egyptian declaration, con-
 trary to an impression given
 by press reports,  does not pro-
 vide a means for putting this
 question up to the jurisdiction
 of the International Court of
 Justice.   Only differences be-
 tween parties to the Constan-
 tinople Convention of 1888 are
 to be so handled.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 25 April 1957
 The Israeli press has con-
 tinued to exhibit concern that
 Israel's interests have been
 ignored in the big-power nego-
 tiations on the canal problem
 and to threaten a dramatic
 move to bring these interests
 again to world attention.
 While there have been no
 recent reports that the Israelis
 are preparing a specific ship
 to send to the canal, the Is-
 raeli merchant marine has a
 number of older vessels avail-
 able which it might be willing
 to risk in such a maneuver, and
 such a vessel could appear at
 the canal entrance with little
 or no warning if the Israelis
 chose,
 Aqaba
 At the same time,  the Is-
 raelis' interest in the Aqaba
 question has become still more
 active as a result of Arab at-
 tempts to deny Iranian oil to
 Israeli, purchasers.   Although
 the 'Shah ::of Iran  cannot  .
 legally  control:;the     sales:
 of the international consortium
 which markets the vast bulk of
 Iranian production, he and the
 .Arabs probably can put effective
 pressure on its members.
 The issue is critical for
 Israel inasmuch as the pipe-
 line from Eilat to Beersheba is
 completed and operating.   The
 oil discharged at Eilat earlier
 this month by the American-flag
 tanker Kern Hills has been put
 through the pipe.; as.a: .test ? run;
 it was expected to arrive at
 Beersheba, the present northern
 terminus of the 8-inch line,
 on 24 April.   The Kern Hills
 was originally to arrive back
 in Eilat from its second trip
 to Iran on 30 April; but the
 subsequent international com-
 plications seem lik            ay
 its:voyage.
 MOSCOW'S COEXISTENCE CAMPAIGN
 Public statements by So-
 viet leaders last week and
 private overtures to Western
 diplomats suggest that Moscow
 believes it has succeeded in
 stabilizing the situation in
 Eastern Europe and now is in
 a position to return to the
 general foreign policy line
 laid down at last year's party
 congress.
 Khrushchev struck the key-
 note with his remark at a public
 reception on 15 April that "the
 Hungarian situation was a rather
 sharp affair...but things now
 are settling down."  In a fare-
 well conversation with Ambas-
 sador Bohlen on 17-April, Khru-
 shchev and Bulganin expressed
 optimism in regard to relaxa-
 tion of international tension
 and improvement of relations
 with the West.
 Soviet officials have taken
 the same line in recent talks
 with British and French diplo-
 mats.   During the new British
 ambassador's first call on Bul-
 ganirt,   the Soviet premier de-
 plored the absence of contact
 between high-level Soviet and
 British leaders.   He asserted
 that the USSR wishes to return
 to the type of relations that
 existed at the time of the Bul-
 ganin-Khrushchev visit to Lon-
 don in April 1956.   In a 20
 April letter to Prime Minister
 Macmillan, Bulganin made a major
 bid for a return to the "Geneva.
 spirit" in Anglo-Soviet rela-
 tions, and asserted that "tran-
 sient considerations" should not
 prevail over the fundamental
 interests of the two countries.

 Paris;,  the counselor of the

 the USSR was not overly enthu-

 even contemplate withdrawing
 support from him "under certain
 circumstances."  He added that
 the USSR might take a c-dncilia-
 tory line regarding Suez and
 Middle East problems generally
 if France would show a more un-

 official revealed that the same

 The new British ambassador
 in Moscow told Ambassador Bohlen
 on 15 April that Gromyko and
 Bulganin recently had revealed
 the apparent desire of the USSR
 for Soviet-British discussions

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 .GREEK-TURKISH RELATIONS CONTINUE TENSE
 Relations between Greece
 and Turkey, exacerbated by the
 arrival in Athens of Archbishop
 Makarios, remain in a state of
 high tension.   Provocative in-
 cidents then were avoided by
 extraordinary security precau-
 tions by the governments of .
 both countries.  However, there
 are increasing indications that
 the Turks may be contemplating
 drastic action against the
 Greek community in Istanbul.
 The Greek Orthodox Patriarchate
 of Constantinople is less secure
 of continued existence now than
 at any time since 1925, when
 the patriarch was expelled and
 forced to flee to Greece.
 The congratulatory invita-
 tion of Governor Harriman to
 Makarios to visit New York has
 raised a new storm in Turkey.
 Most Turks do not understand
 the American federal system,
 and the invitation has been
 generally viewed as a statement
 of official American policy
 favoring the Greek case regard-
 ing Cyprus.
 Turks,
 who formerly thought the United
 States supported Turkey's posi-
 tion, may now revert to their
 basic conviction that the United
 States will always back Chris-
 tians against Moslems.
 The American embassy be-
 lieves there is a growing feel-
 ing in Ankara that action against
 the patriarchate would give
 tangible evidence of the inten-
 sity of Turkish feeling as well
 as satisfy the popular demand
 for dramatic action on the part
 of the government.
 Greek officials are increas-
 ingly concerned over the Turkish-
 attitude toward the patriarchate,
 and fear that its expulsion from
 Istanbul would enable the Moscow
 patriarchate to assume the lead-
 ership of the entire Eastern
 Orthodox Church.  The American
 consul general in Istahbul be-
 lieves Athenagoras and his Holy
 Synod would resist any move
 toward expelling them and might
 ask for foreign assistance, pre-
 sumably from the World Council
 of Churches, the Anglican Com-
 munion, and interested govern-
 ments.
 Makarios probably still
 aims at the eventual union of
 Cyprus with Greece, although the
 Greek government apparently is
 trying to influence him to accept
 eventually an internationally
 guaranteed independent status
 for Cyprus.  Makarios is
 expected soon to go to London,
 where the British may invite him
 to discuss informally the pros-
 pects for negotiations on self-
 government for Cyprus between
 the British and representatives
 of all the island's communities.

 25 April 1957
 The deadlock between Dja-
 karta and disaffected provinces
 continues in Indonesia despite
 a drive by government officials
 to restore national unity and
 to carry out President Sukarno's
 concept of government.
 Sukarno gave a major ad-
 dress on 17 April in Central
 Java in which he defended and
 further spelled out his ideas
 for a national advisory council
 and a national planning board.
 Sukarno has again offered to
 head the advisory council and
 personally appoint its members,
 who will be both "functional"
 and regional representatives.
 The national planning board,
 as explained by Sukarno, would
 be a vast new bureaucracy which
 could absorb the energies and
 criticisms of provincial lead-
 ers.
 Prime Minister Djuanda is
 touring Central and South Suma-
 tra for talks with provincial
 officials, which he hopes will
 lay the basis for a reconcilia-
 tion with Djakarta.   The minis-
 ter          of the newly formed Depart-
 ment of Regional Affairs has
 told the press that the prov-
 inces do indeed have legitimate
 economic grievances and that
 the return of former vice presi-
 dent Hatta to the government is
 a "psychological necessity."
 The army chief of staff,
 General Nasution, will preside
 at a three-day national con-
 ference in Djakarta beginning on
 26 April which will include
 both military and civil offi-
 cials from disaffected areas
 and will discuss measures to
 be taken under the state of
 war and siege.   Meanwhile, he
 has designated his deputy chief
 of staff, ' Colonel Subroto--who
 is highly regarded in the dis-
 affected areas and who may have
 obstructed some of Nasution's
 reorganizational efforts--as
 head of a military mission to
 Peiping.   He appears also to
 be :Laying plans for a counter-
 coup in East Indonesia which,
 if successful, would restore
 at 'Least half that area to
 Djakarta's direct administration.
 The non-Javanese provinces--
 particularly Sumatra--show no
 sign of surrendering to Dja-
 Kart:a.   On the eve of Djuanda's
 visit to Sumatra, Central Suma-
 tran leaders were commemorating
 their 20 December coup and had
 sent; congratulations to other
 disaffected provinces.   Presi-
 dent Sukarno, who heretofore has
 not been directly blamed for the
 errors of Djakarta, now has been
 charged by the Central Sumatran
 governing council with the chief
 responsibility for the "totally
 unacceptable" new cabinet.   Lt.
 Col. Hussein, who controls Cen-
 tral Sumatra and who ignored the
 last army conference in Djakarta,
 will attend the 26 April meeting.
 His chief objective, however,
 reportedly is to contact disaf-
 fected commanders from Borneo
 and East Indonesia, who will also
 be present.
 Britain and Yemen have
 agreed to a meeting of local
 representatives on 9 May at
 Mukeiras on the Aden-Yemen bor-
 der to discuss restoration of
 peaceful conditions, but these
 talks are not likely to do
 much to solve the long-standing
 border dispute.
 Britain, suspicious of
 Yeme'ri   aims, has already rein-
 forced its troops in Aden with
 an armored car squadron and
 apparently does not expect to
 achieve more than a detente by
 these talks.  Though London had
 indicated in January that it

 IRANIAN-SOVIET ECONOMIC RELATIONS
 A three-year trade agree-

 discussions have been held on
 a civil air agreement and on
 offers of economic assistance.
 The Iranians have thus far not
 agreed to any Soviet assistance

 The new trade agreement
 calls for yearly increases in
 the volume of exchange covering
 a wider range of goods than

 is to export lead and zinc ores,
 and several agricultural prod-

 other commodities.
 In further discussion, Iran
 reportedly agreed "in principle"
 to the establishment of direct

 be worked out in the near future.
 While Tehran also is reported

 first proposed during the
 Shah's visit to the USSR in the
 summer of 1956.      Other projects
 for which the USSR has offered
 assistance are steel mills,
 the development of rail facili-
 ties in Julfa on the USSR-
 Iranian border, and port in-
 stallations in Pahlevi on the
 Caspian Sea.   Soviet negotia-
 tors claim the enlargement of
 the capacity of both ports of
 entry would facilitate han-
 dling of increased Iranian
 Soviet exchanges of goods, as
 well as the transit of goods
 between Iran and Europe.   Te-
 hran may not be able to delay
 indefinitely acceptance of
 Soviet assistance for some of
 these projects which require
 joint development.
 Soviet uneasiness over
 the prospect of American
 economic assistance to Poland
 became apparent on 19 April
 in an emphatic statement by
 Khrushchev that Western "aid"
 to Poland was designed to split
 the bloc and place Poland "in
 bondage to capitalist coun-
 tries."  He declared further
 that the bloc would furnish
 assistance to its own members,
 probably to encourage Poland
 to tie its economy more closely
 to the bloc and to counteract
 the impact of an American loan.
 The strong position taken
 by Khrushchev may mean that
 the Kremlin will try to keep
 Poland from accepting further
 Western credits, although it
 will probably not interfere
 with current negotiations with
 the United States.
 Soviet fears that Western
 assistance to Poland threatens
 the stability of the Soviet
 position in East Germany
 The USSR and Iran have been
 negotiating a transit agreement
 which would provide for the
 transit across Soviet territory
 of goods to and from Europe.
 The Iranians have objected to
 the presently prohibitive Soviet
 railroad rates and the Soviet
 conditions giving preferential
 rates to European countries hav-
 ing commercial agreements with
 the USSR.   Soviet negotiators
 will probably ask for reciprocal
 rights which the Iranians feel
 they could not refuse.   While
 Tehran will strive to maintain
 regular relations with the USSR,
 Iranian officials continue to be
 influenced by American advice
 and will proceed with caution
 on :individual Soviet proposals.

 the West:   "Don't test us as you
 did in Hungary and try another

 you start we will rap your

 Basic Soviet suspicions of
 Western economic influence,
 aroused by the Marshall Plan
 in 1.947, caused Molotov to can-
 cel abruptly Czech and Polish
 plans to accept Western aid
 at that time.   These suspicions
 were demonstrated again recently
 by Khrushchev's remark that Tito
 was not receiving credits from
 the West "because of his blue
 eyes"--a remark which closely
 parallels his comment last
 week. to Polish premier Cyrankie-
 wicz that the latter was being
 wooed as a bride, but not
 because he was young.
 The Poles have sought to
 quiet Soviet fears with re-

 of economic relations between
 Poland and the United States"
 and have denied that there are
 any political overtones in
 the negotiations.   This is in
 line with Gomulka's statement
 on 11 January that Poland
 "would accept a loan from any
 country provided the conditions
 under which the loan is granted
 are exclusively of a business
 nature."
 Recent grants of credit
 by Satellite countries to
 Poland, presumably made at the
 instance of the Kremlin, ap-

 offset the impact of American
 aid and to tighten Poland's
 economic ties with the bloc.
 Poland signed a mutually ad-

 Germany on 17 April which calls
 for  a  long-term East German
 credit of $100,000,000, at 1,5
 percent, to cover manufacturing
 costs of brown coal mining
 equipment.
 It has also signed a long-
 term credit agreement with
 Czechoslovakia under which
 Warsaw is to receive $27,500,000
 worth of machinery and indus-
 trial installations.   The
 credits give further substance
 to Khrushchev's position that
 bloc members can find the as-

 seek it there.                (Con-    25X1

 SOVIET-YUGOSLAV RELATIONS
 Soviet leaders made a
 number of conciliatory gestures
 toward Yugoslavia during talks
 with Albanian leaders last
 week.  On 15 April, Khrushchev,
 using Tito's own formula for
 improving relations, said that
 the Soviet government and party
 wanted to concentrate not on
 differences but on "what brings
 the people of our two countries
 together in the struggle for
 socialism."
 Numerous statements by
 Khrushchev also continue to
 make plain that economic aid
 and even high-level trade
 depend on"fraternal" relations
 with Moscow.   He has said that
 the USSR extended aid to Yugo-
 slavia and Poland only so they
 would not "have to rely on the
 capitalists.."
 Yugoslav leaders in speeches
 on 18 April to the executive
 committee of the Yugoslav mass
 people's organization clearly
 showed that they rejected the
 Soviet gestures of good will.
 President Tito specifically
 noted that while Khrushchev's
 statements stressing the need
 to improve relations had
 "aroused a spark of hope" of
 a change in the Soviet attitude,
 they had been contradicted by
 statements of other Soviet
 leaders which directly attacked
 the Yugoslav position.   Neither
 he nor Vice President Rankovic
 mentioned the possibility of
 developing good "party" rela-.
 tions in the future, discussing
 only their hopes for an eventual
 improvement in relations be-.
 tween the two states.
 While Tito is intent on
 preventing a complete break
 between Yugoslavia and the
 Eastern European Satellites, he
 will undoubtedly insist on a
 real. change in Soviet attitude
 toward Yugoslavia and the Satel-
 lites before any reconciliation
 can take place.   The Yugoslavs
 are hoping to prove both abroad

 PEIPING WELCOMES JAPANESE SOCIALIST DELEGATION
 Peiping's lavish treatment
 of the Japanese Socialist dele-
 gation visiting Communist China
 since 12 April marks a new ef-
 fort to put increased strain
 on ties between Tokyo and Wash-
 ington.   The mission is certain
 to intensify pressures in Ja-
 pan for diplomatic relations
 with Peiping.
 A joint statement issued
 on 22 April declared that the
 "time is now ripe" for a Sino-
 Japanese peace treaty,  called
 for increased cultural, techni-
 cal and economic interchange,
 and urged that existing unof-
 ficial agreements between the
 two nations be converted to
 official ones "as soon as pos-
 sible."
 Mao told his visitors that
 Communist China was ready to
 consider conclusion of a non-
 aggression pact with Tokyo when
 Japan "becomes completely in-
 dependent from the United
 States."  He declared that dip-
 lomatic relations between Ja-
 pan and Communist China should
 be restored "at the earliest
 possible date."
 Peiping apparently will
 not press for terms which Tokyo
 could reject as unrealistic at
 this time.   The Chinese Commu-
 nists indicated they were not
 demanding immediate abrogation
 of Japan's security treaty with
 the United States as a condi-
 tion for a Sino-Japanese pact,
 nor were they calling for a
 rupture of diplomatic relations
 between Tokyo and Taipei.   Pei-
 ping's stress on the need for
 Japanese "independence" and
 closer ties with mainland China
 appears intended to advance
 the Chinese Communist campaign
 for closer de facto relations
 with Japan by exploiting the
 present trend of Japanese pub-
 lic opinion.
 Conservative Japanese lead-
 ers are concerned that the So-
 cialists might monopolize pub-
 lic attention on this popular
 issue.   To offset possible So-
 cialist gains in this regard,
 the Kishi government has rushed
 preparations to send a Diet
 repatriation delegation to Pei-
 ping to investigate the status
 of approximately 40,000 missing
 Japanese nationals.
 Minister of International
 Trade and Industry Mizuta has
 publicly stated the government
 intends to grant "considerable

 Communists in permitting them
 to establish a trade mission
 in Tokyo.   This will probably
 include Japan's waiving of
 fingerprint requirements and
 the granting of some diplomatic
 privileges.
 Mizuta also indicated the
 Japanese government would sub-
 sidize the establishment of a
 quasi-official trade mission in
 Peiping.   In addition he noted
 that the government planned to
 give "positive" guidance in
 the coming private trade talks
 with Peiping.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 25 April 1957
 Chou En-lai's 15 April
 statement to the Socialist mis-
 sion on the status of Taiwan in
 relation to the restoration of
 Sino-Japanese diplomatic ties
 was widely reported in the
 Japanese press.  Most papers
 noted that Peiping appeared
 more "realistic" than in the
 past.  Mao Tse-tung's offer
 to conclude a nonaggression
 pact with Tokyo when Japan
 becomes "completely independ-
 ent" will stimulate additional
 pressure for Japan to pursue a
 more independent course in
 foreign relations.
 Prime Minister Kishi has
 declared that now is not the
 time to recognize the Peiping
 regime.  Both he and his govern-
 ment, however, insist that
 special restrictions on trade
 with Communist China must be
 eliminated and he will press
 strongly for an equalization
 of the emba                 oc
 nations.
 COMMUNIST CHINA STRESSES SMALL LOCAL INDUSTRIES
 Communist: China.'?s economic
 policy makers appear to have
 concluded on the basis of their
 recent economic difficulties
 that it is not wise, at least
 for the next few years, to con-
 centrate too heavily on large,
 complex industrial installations.
 Instead they are trying to stim-
 ulate efforts to restore and
 create large numbers of small-
 scale facilities featuring a
 simpler technology and a greater
 geographical dispersion.   In
 adopting this course, Peiping
 has not, however, abandoned its
 ,dtive. for rapid industrializa-
 tion.  Construction of large-
 scale industrial projects is to
 continue within certain limita-
 tions.
 The Ministry of Metallurgi-
 cal Industry announced on 4
 April that during the Second
 and Third Five-Year Plans (1958-
 1967)., small- and medium-sized
 metallurgical plants are to be
 emphasized in order to stretch
 construction funds, obtain
 quick financial and physical
 returns and improve the
 geographical balance of the
 overconcentrated metallurgical
 industry.  The ministry noted
 that capital investment in the
 three big iron and steel plants
 at Anshan, Paotow and Wuhan
 will be limited so that more
 small and medium plants can be
 built.
 Some of the rolling equip-
 ment formerly earmarked for
 Anshan will go to equip small
 plants in other places.  Plans
 still call for the large-scale
 development of the three centers
 and they will certainly continue
 to supply the overwhelming
 majority of China's iron and
 steel needs.  The new local
 plants are probably designed
 to relieve the large inte-
 grated complexes of the need
 to supply small-scale local

 industrial needs for the simpler
 forms of steel mill products.
 The State Council, in an
 effort to relieve the coal
 shortage, directed on 12 April
 that small coal pits be restored
 and new ones opened.  Under
 the directive, counties, cities
 and agricultural producer co-
 operatives may operate small
 collieries to meet their own
 needs. On 22 April, the National
 Economic Commission decided to
 invest this year about $16,000,-
 000 in small plants designed to
 produce 400,000 tons of pig
 iron per year and $24,000,000
 in smaller coal pits producing
 4,200,000 tons of coal.
 Chinese industry has been
 hampered by shortages of money
 and raw materials and by trans-
 port tie-ups, aggravated by
 the speed-up in the construction
 program in 1956.   Building small
 installations in more locali-
 ties will probably ease some
 shortages and give limited re-
 lief to the overloaded trans-
 portation system.                                                                   The less

 PEIPING CONCERNED OVER DECLINE IN POPULAR MORALE
 Signs of a decline in the

 stated that "almost everyone"
 feels he is not eating as
 much or  as well as he would

 are also in short supply, and
 Peiping has found it necessary
 to promise that light industry
 will. this year be allocated a
 slightly increased proportion
 of investment funds, although
 heavy industry will still re-
 ceive priority.
 Commenting on popular at-
 titudes in China, the second-
 ranking officer of the Dutch
 embassy in Peiping recently
 reported a "lack of enthusiasm"
 and slow working habits among
 urban workers.  The departing
 counselor of the British em-
 bassy in Peiping has reported
 a "hardening of outlook" in
 the past year.  People now
 show a tendency, he said, to
 make "more critical judgments"
 of the Communists.

 out much success.  The Commu-
 nists-acknowledge that land-
 lords, rich peasants, and some
 middle peasants are "grumbling"
 about their decreased incomes'
 after joining the collectives.
 They further admit that peasant
 living standards are much below
 urban levels.   But they insist
 that the incomes of workers
 and peasants generally have
 been rising at "more or less"
 the same rate.
 In the universities, the
 "unhealthy tendencies" first
 admitted by Peiping last fall
 have come in for renewed cen-
 sure.  The press has cited
 cases of students who defy
 school regulations, decline
 to participate in political
 activities, are addicted to
 dancing, and fail to make the
 proper distinction between
 "friends" and "enemies" in their
 discussion of developments in
 Hungary.
 The signs of alienation of
 the populace from the party have
 occasioned two major addresses
 by Mao Tse-tung in recent months
 on the subject of "contradic-'
 tions" between the people and
 the leadership.  Peiping's view
 is apparently that the situation
 is a matter of some concern, but
 that it has not yet,'reached
 proportions requiring the re-
 turn to a new terror.   Commu-
 nists are warned against antago-
 nizing the people by "commandism"
 and bureaucratic practices.
 The "confused" populace is to
 be reindoctrinated along the line
 that people and leaders under
 Communism have an identity
 rather than a conflict of in-
 terests.  For'the moment at
 least, the propaganda organs
 rather than the public security
 apparatus of the state are to
 bear the brunt of the contest
 against Doyular disaffection.
 Leaders of the comparative-
 ly wealthy Overseas Chinese
 community of over 300,000 per-
 sons in the Philippines, tradi-
 tionally an important source
 of election campaign funds, are
 reported determined to obtain
 maximum benefits from their con-
 tributions this year.   With a
 large number of politicians
 entering the presidential race,
 Chinese financial backing may
 have an important bearing on
 both the party nominations and
 the outcome of the November
 voting.
 Early in the present cam-
 paign, leaders of the Federation
 of Chinese Chambers of Commerce

 COMMUNIST REPRESENTATION IN THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT
 The Indian Communist Party
 doubled its percentage of the
 popular vote in the recent na-
 tional elections and increased
 its representation in parliament
 and in eight of the 13 state
 assemblies.  However, the party
 is not in a position to affect
 the nature of legislation ex-
 cept in Kerala State, where it
 controls the government, and
 possibly in Orissa State, where
 it holds the balance of power
 between the Congress Party and
 the rightist Ganatantra Parishad
 party.
 Although the Communists
 enlarged their representation
 both in parliament-and in the
 states in the 1957 elections,
 their gain in seats does not
 correspond to the increase in
 the popular vote.   The party
 and its allies now hold 29 out
 of 488 parliamentary seats for
 which elections have been held,
 a gain of roughly 25 percent
 over the 1952 total of 23.  The
 present    Communist parliamen-
 tary group is probably a more
 cohesive one, however, since 27
 are apparently Communist Party
 members, whereas in 1952 only
 16 belonged to the party.
 A comparison of the Commu-
 nist position in the 13 state
 assemblies immediately before
 and after the 1957 elections in-
 dicates that the .party lost
 seats in Andhra, Madras, and the
 Punjab, maintained its position
 in Mysore and Rajasthan, and
 gained strength in the remaining
 eight states,   Kerala is the
 only state where the party has
 a firm foothold.  In. two of

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 25 April 1957
 Communist influence appears
 to be increasing among organized
 labor in Peru primarily because
 the Communists' chief opponents
 in the labor field--the leftist
 but non-Communist APRA--have
 been prevented by political con-
 siderations from pressing for
 labor gains.  Early this year
 the Communists recaptured two
 key labor bases which APRA had
 won in 1956 and gained another
 federation long controlled by
 APRA.  The Communists have re-
 portedly succeeded in a recent
 attempt to organize miners at
 Toquepala   in southern Peru,
 where American companies are in-
 vesting $200,000,000 in new cop-
 per exploitation, and they ap-
 pear to be having considerable
 success at the American-owned
 mines in central congress.
 The miners' congress spon-
 sored by ORIT,  the inter-Amer-
 ican anti-Communist labor organ-
 ization,  and recently-scheduled
 for 25 April, may provide a test
 of Communist and APRA influence
 among the miners.  The Commu-'
 nits will probably exploit
 APRA's commitment to oppose vis-
 its by congress delegates to
 certain American-owned mining
 installations where housing is
 substandard and to prevent crit-
 icism of health conditions at
 mines and smelters.
 SECRET
 Bolivia
 In Bolivia, Juan Lechin,
 long Bolivia's dominant labor
 leader and a key figure in the
 government party, is apparently
 losing influence.  He is re-
 ported discouraged because he
 realizes that support of the
 government's anti-inflation
 program is essential even
 though it sharply curtails his
 maneuvering for patronage and
 labor gains.
 The government party form-
 erly controlled 94 of the 104
 labor unions in La Paz, but
 reportedly lost control of 20
 of these to orthodox Communists
 or Trotskyites in recent months.
 An extreme leftist secretary
 general gained control of the
 railway federation, and third
 largest labor group in Bolivia,
 in April.
 A key test of pro-Com-
 munist strength in Bolivian
 labor will come at the second
 national congress of the Bo-
 livian Workers' Central on 18
 May,       Any marked decline in
 Juan Lechin's dominance is
 likely to result in irrespon-
 sible agitation by the Workers'
 Central--the most powerful
 pressure group in Bolivia.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 25 April 1957
 THE STABILITY OF THE EAST GERMAN GOVERNMENT
 Discontent among intel-
 lectuals, students, farmers and
 workers in East Germany con-
 tinues to be the most serious
 .problem facing the East German
 Communists.   The survival of
 the present leadership depends
 on support from the USSR, and
 this support in turn hinges on
 the regime's ability to hold
 in check the various dissident
 elements.   Stalinist party boss
 Walter Ulbricht is determined
 to take tough measures, which
 will probably be successful in
 the absence of a leader around
 whom critics of. the regime
 could gather.
 Party Factionalism
 Although there are some
 differences on specific policy
 questions among the party lead-
 ership, as well as widespread
 opposition sentiment through-
 out the country, there is no
 German Gomulka with the con-
 victions, will or following to
 challenge successfully the
 Stalinist Ulbricht for control
 of the party.
 Most reports of differences
 within the Socialist Unity (Com-
 munist) Party (SED) leadership
 indicate that the disputes have
 been concerned largely with
 matters of economic policy.
 Economic technicians like Deputy
 Premiers Heinrich Rau, Fritz
 Selbmann, and Fred Oelssner
 have frequently found them-
 selves in conflict with the
 group interested primarily in
 maintaining the purity of Com-
 munist Soviet-style ideology.
 The creation on 11 April of an
 economic council to co-ordinate
 the direction of the country's
 economy appears to be a victory
 for the economists, who frequent-
 ly oppose Ulbricht on practical
 grounds.
 Although Ulbricht is un-
 popular, both inside and out-
 side the party, the opposition
 has no hard-core group; it lacks
 cohesion and its composition
 appears to shift depending on
 .the issues involved.
 Ferment Among Intellectuals
 A ferment of new and liberal
 ideas among intellectuals and
 students has grown steadily
 since de-Stalinization began
 following the Soviet 20th party
 congress in Moscow in February
 1956.   It increased sharply
 after the "Polish October" and
 the Hungarian revolutions, when
 most intellectuals, along with
 other elements of the popula-
 tion,  rejected the SED's ex-
 planations of those events.
 Thus the 30th plenary
 meeting of the SED central com-
 mittee held from 30 January to
 1 February 1957 placed primary
 emphasis on overcoming the
 ideological deviations which
 admittedly had reached dangerous
 proportions in high party circles.
 as well as among the intelli-
 gentsia.   References by party
 officials to "certain experi-
 ments in Poland" and "differences
 of opinion" with the Polish
 Communist Party substantiate
 reports that SED leaders regard
 Poland as a major source of
 heretical and deviationist ideas
 in East Germany.   The "Yugo-
 slav example" and the thesis of
 a "special German path" to so-
 cialism, both of which have

 considerable appeal to some
 East German Communists, were
 also attacked and categorically
 rejected by the party leader-
 ship.
 The trial in March of Pro-
 fessor Wolfgang Harich of Hum-
 boldt University was an obvious
 attempt by the regime to intimi-
 date East German intellectuals
 and liberals.   The court stated
 on 9 March that Harich and his
 associates were imprisoned for
 active conspiracy against the
 state; in fact they were im-
 prisoned for holding ideologi-
 cal views of their own which
 differed from those of the party
 leadership.   The entire affair
 may boomerang, however, since
 it provides dissident groups
 with a martyr and a focus which
 they have hitherto lacked.
 In a long memorandum to
 party members written before
 his arrest last November, Harich
 disclosed radical reformist
 ideas the East German intel-
 lectuals espoused and the pro-
 found bitterness and resentment
 they held toward the regime.
 Although professing loyalty to
 Marxism-Leninism and disclaiming
 any intention to become rene-
 gades,  the Harich group pro-
 claimed its complete alienation
 from the Ulbricht leadership
 and its intention to liberate
 East German Communism from "Sta-
 linism and dogmatism and to re-
 store its basis of humanist non-
 dogmatic thought."
 Experience had shown him,
 Harich declared, that reform of
 the SED was impossible without
 the overthrow of the Ulbricht
 leadership.   He had attempted
 without success to present his
 ideas for party reform to party
 leaders in the hope of effect-
 ing the development of democ
 racy within the SED in an open,
 legal fashion,   "But we are
 ready also to use the method of
 faction and conspiracy if forced
 to it," Harich declared.
 Harich denied that the

 bring socialism to West Germany.
 He also charged the Soviet Union
 with exploiting the "People's
 Democracies" and said that its
 political system is an impedi-
 ment to further progress through-
 out the Soviet bloc.
 Farmers and Workers Restive
 The restiveness of workers
 and farmers is also a matter of
 serious concern to the regime..
 Here) the problem is largely
 economic.   Workers' hours are
 long, wages are low, food prices
 are high, and consumer goods
 are scarce; farmers' delivery
 quotas are high, prices for
 produce are low, and the pres-
 sures for collectivization are
 highly unpopular.
 The regime has been forced
 to cut back its economic goals
 for 1957, and critical shortages
 of coal, coke, iron ore, non-
 ferrous metals, and foodstuffs
 jeopardize the fulfillment of
 even the reduced plans.   Although
 the Soviet Union has promised
 to shore up the shaky East Ger-
 man economy, party and govern-
 ment, officials have warned that
 significant economic improve-
 ments must not be expected this
 year.   The end of food ration-
 ing, promised for the spring
 of 1957, almost certainly will
 not be realized.
 Security Forces
 The regime is continuing
 its efforts to create effec-
 tive, reliable armed and secu-
 rity, forces capable of control
 ling dissident elements and sup-
 pressing any outbreaks of anti-
 regime violence.   East German
 forces, themselves of question-
 able reliability, would not
 alone be able to maintain the
 regime in power. They should
 be able to do so, however, with
 the support of Soviet troops
 stationed in the country.

 capita agricultural production
 over the next few years probably
 will improve but slightly.
 Programs After Stalin
 During the quarter century
 preceding Stalin's death, Soviet
 agriculture remained virtually
 stagnant while industry grew
 rapidly.   In 1953, agriculture
 still suffered from low yields
 and insufficient machinery, and
 absorbed a large, relatively un-
 skilled labor force.  The na-
 tional diet remained monotonous,
 and contained little meat, milk
 and fruit.  Finally recognizing
 the critical imbalance in the
 economy, the post-Stalin regime
 in its first months raised the
 priority of agriculture in the
 economy.
 The new leaders enlarged
 the sown area of the country
 about 25 percent, primarily by
 developing virgin lands in Si-
 beria and Kazakhstan.   Even be-
 fore completing this operation
 the government launched a pro-
 gram to multiply more than six
 times the area in corn.  These
 programs were aimed at-greatly
 increasing supplies of feed for
 livestock, while maintaining a
 satisfactory level of grain pro-
 duction for bread.
 To raise efficiency in
 production, the new regime has
 provided greater incentives to
 agricultural workers.  Between
 1952 and 1956 state payments
 for agricultural products in-
 creased two and one-half times.
 The total cash income of the
 peasants for labor performed on
 the collective farms more than
 doubled during this time, and
 peasant income from private
 plots appears to have remained
 stable.  Benefits for state
 farmers have also grown con-
 siderably.
 These post-Stalin programs
 and their supporting industrial
 and construction activities have
 been expensive, with the result
 that agriculture has received
 a bigger share of state invest-
 ments since 1953.  This modi-
 SECRET
 fication of the traditional in-
 vestment pattern is to continue
 through 1960.  The programs are
 also costly in terms of man-
 power, which is becoming tighter
 in industry.  From 1954 through
 1956 the agricultural labor
 force actually increased in
 number, reversing the trend of
 many years.
 Organizational changes
 undertaken since 1953 have been
 largely in the management field
 and have had little effect on
 the basic agrarian structure,
 although the state's control
 over the peasant has increased
 somewhat.  Broad supervisory
 powers over collective farms
 have been conferred on Machine
 Tractor Stations, strengthening
 their position as "the command
 posts of the party in the coun-
 trysidee"  At least one third
 of the collective farms have re-
 ceived new managers who, for
 the most part,, are party mem-
 bers, from the cities.  Some of
 the detailed planning, such as
 deciding the local crop planting
 pattern, has been shifted from
 Moscow to regional jurisdictions
 and even to farms themselves.
 It is doubtful if this has ap-
 preciably improved agricultural
 administration.
 Present Situation
 In 1956 the vastly ex-
 panded sown area, together with
 extremely favorable weather in
 the new lands areas, led to a
 record-breaking grain harvest

 Khrushchev has been awarded
 highest honors as originator of
 the successful new lands pro-
 gram.   The government hopes
 this year's crop will be as
 good as that in 1956 and that
 there will be a great increase
 in livestock products.   Speeches
 at a series of recent regional
 agricultural conferences have
 not set forth any new agricul-
 tural programs, but have ex-  .
 pressed confidence in existing
 policies and organizations.
 Looking Ahead
 The regime probably will
 not be satisfied, however, with
 future prospects if  it is look-
 ing at realities rather than
 the wholly unrealistic 1960
 targets.   The substantial ad-
 vances in 1956 will probably be
 followed by slower production
 gains in the next few years and
 almost certainly by some years
 in which production will be be-
 low 1956..  Grain production
 should tend to level off, al-
 though meat and milk production
 should rise.   Agricultural out-
 put may rise by  roughly 30 per-
 cent from 1955 to 1960, well
 below the 1960 goal of 70 per-
 cent, although these figures
 are not strictly comparable.
 In per capita terms, output
 wil]L improve but slightly.
 The means of achieving this
 rise will continue to be quite
 costly both in men and money.
 With the new lands expansion
 program practically completed,
 the regime is now relying on
 further incentives, on large
 capital investments, and on or-
 ganizational measures to in-
 crease yields and to improve
 aninal husbandry.   To pay for
 this, investments in the Sixth
 Five-Year Plan are to be double
 that of the previous plan.
 Furthermore, it is unlikely that

 a premium on releas-

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY.
 25 April 1957
 DISSENSION IN THE JAPANESE COMMUNIST PARTY
 Personal rivalries among
 top leaders, disputes about
 tactics, and general confusion
 and resentment over Moscow's
 direction have created serious
 dissension within the Japanese
 Communist Party.   Party leaders
 acknowledge that there is
 growing indifference among
 members toward party activities,
 and supporters of expelled
 central committeeman Shigeo
 Shida reportedly are working
 to establish a "Racial Com-
 munist Party."   A major split
 seems unlikely in the near
 future,  however, and the recent
 re-establishment of the Soviet
 diplomatic staff in Tokyo prob-
 ably will be followed by meas-
 ures designed to strengthen
 the party's organization and
 effectiveness.
 Since its founding in 1922,
 the party has been hampered by
 factional struggle and by
 numerous revisions of policy
 which, since 1950 alone, have
 resulted in shifts from parlia-
 mentary to violent tactics
 and back again.
 The.party has existed
 legally only since 1945, having,
 been suppressed by the Japanese
 government prior to that time.
 It was during this five-
 year period, and particularly
 from 1950 to 1952, that Shigeo
 Shida became a dominant leader
 in the underground,. directing
 a major portion of the violent
 activities in which the party
 engaged.   It was during this
 period also that struggles for
 party leadership were intensi-
 fied and several top officials
 expelled.
 The international Communist
 shift from violent to peaceful
 tactics in 1955 had a devastat-
 ing effect from which the Japa-
 nese party has not yet recovered.
 Underground leaders surfaced
 and the policy advocated by
 Shida was denounced as "extreme
 left-wing adventurism."  Leaders
 who supported the new peace
 line and several of Shida's
 purged rivals who were restored
 to party rank increased their
 power positions at Shida's
 expense.
 During 1956, it became
 evident that Shida, although
 he had severed contacts with
 parity headquarters, was

 endeavoring to recover his lost
 strength, promoting a movement
 against the "collective leader-
 ship" of Sanzo Nozaka, Yoshio
 Shiga and Kenji Miyamoto..
 Much of Shida's strength is
 believed to have been drawn
 from the regional party levels
 and below..   The central com-
 mittee, with.the twofold pur-
 pose of stopping  this move-
 ment and of gaining more popu-
 lar support by disclaiming
 the tactics of violence with
 which Shida was identified,
 expelled him from the party
 in September 1956.
 Effects of Soviet Policies
 Perhaps more widespread
 in its effect on the party as
 a whole is the confusion,.re-
 sentment and indifference to
 party activities which the
 twists in Soviet government and
 party policies have engendered,
 SECRET
 particularly among rank-and-
 file Japanese members.   The
 practice of the party collec-
 tive leadership to accept,
 without satisfactory explana-
 tion and.guidance, the Soviet
 position on reversion to peace-
 ful tactics, the return of the
 southern Kuril Islands to Japan,
 and the suppression of the
 Hungarian revolt has weakened
 internal discipline and caused
 considerable criticism of party
 leaders.
 Those rank-and-file members
 who are dissatisfied with Mos-
 cow's direction, but who also
 would not support Shida's move-
 ment for a separate party, ap-
 pear to be disorganized and
 leaderless and therefore not
 in a position to challenge
 seriously the party leadership.
 While the present membership
 of the party is estimated at
 80,000 to 90,000, the number
 of reliable party workers prob-
 ably is considerably less.
 The seventh national con-
 vention of the party, the first
 to be held since 1947, is ten=
 tAtivelyscheduled. to be con-
 vened this summer.   It has been
 postponed several times since
 early 1956, probably because
 of the desire by party leaders
 to avoid an open challenge to
 their control and policy.   These
 leaders, especially Kenji Miya-
 moto, may now feel strong
 enough to weather the conven-
 tion and successfully overcome
 any challenge without seriously
 dividing the party.
 Activities of the recently
 re-established Soviet diplomatic
 mission in Tokyo suggest the
 mission will provide increased
 direction, discipline and
 financing for the party in an
 effort to transform it into the
 type of disciplined, properly
 by Moscow.
