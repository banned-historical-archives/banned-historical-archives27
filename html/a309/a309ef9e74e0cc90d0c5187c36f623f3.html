 Soviet and Chinese comment on the fourth anniversary of
 the Sino-Soviet treaty of friendship and alliance provided
 further evidence of variance between Moscow and Peiping on a
 possibly significant point, since doctrinal differences are
 sometimes the first signs of disagreement among Communists.
 Chinese propaganda continued to assert, as it has since
 last October, that the Peiping regime is in the stage of
 "transition to socialism."  Soviet propaganda this month
 reprinted this assertion, attributing it to Mao Tse-tung,
 but continued to avoid originating comment which would
 sanction the Chinese claim.
 There is an apparent parallel between this Soviet be-
 havior and Moscow's position between 1949 and 1951, when
 Chinese spokesmen were asserting that "Mao's road" was a
 "model" for other Asian Communist movements and Soviet
 media tended to ignore or minimize the Chinese line.
 Inasmuch as the Chinese explicitly state that their "tran-
 sition to socialism" is being made possible by Soviet aid,
 Moscow may wish to discourage excessive Chinese hopes.
 Peiping's national construction program has already been
 cut back, in part by an apparent failure to obtain as much
 Soviet aid as desired, and in part by poor planning and dis-
 appointing food crops.
 In China, the party politburo, reporting to the first
 plenary session of the central committee since 1950, em-
 phasized the need to "strengthen party unity."  It left
 obscure whether chairman Mao Tse-tung will stage a public
 purge of party leaders or follow his past practice of
 quietly demoting those in his disfavor.
 Vice Chairman Liu Shao-chi, who read the politburo
 report in Mao's absence, made clear that the "reorganization"
 of the party, under way since 1951, will extend into the
 leadership.  Arguing that "imperialism" will seek agents
 inside the party like Beria and Chang Kuo-tao, a leader ex-
 pelled in 1938, Liu specified that factionalism in the party
 was the "greatest danger."  Be went on to assert that some
 Chinese Communist leaders stillfail to understand the
 importance of "collective leadership" and regard their own
 regional or departmental commands as an "individual inher-
 itance or independent kingdom."

 The plenary session approved the convening of a party
 conference during 1954 to discuss Peiping's national con-
 struction plan and "other relevant questions."  This con-
 ference might be a national congress, which is supposed to
 be held every three years to elect a new central committee
 but in fact has not met since 1945.  A new election would
 be expected to confirm the rise of several new leaders in
 recent years and to formalize the fall from power of some
 of the eight central committee members whose status has
 been in doubt for some time.

 SIGNIFICANCE OF THE BERLIN CONFERENCE FOR SOVIET POLICY
 Soviet policy at Berlin indicated no intention to retreat
 from positions of strength in Europe in order to achieve the
 strategic objective of weakening the western alliance.  The
 agreement on a conference to discuss Korea and Indochina appar-
 ently reflects a decision by Moscow that its greatest chance
 for diplomatic success lies in Asia.
 In consenting to the Geneva conference, Molotov abandoned
 two key points on which he had been adamant from the beginning
 of the open sessions in Berlin.   The first was the demand. that
 Communist China be accorded great-power status at a five-power
 conference.  The second was that this conference should discuss
 measures for reducing international tension without regard to
 geographical area.
 Molotov's decision on China was apparently based on a
 realization that in the effort to block French ratification of
 EDC and forestall greater American intervention in Indochina,
 the USSR would have to offer something more tangible to France
 than the possibility of negotiating a settlement of the Indo-
 china war through a five-power conference at some uncertain
 future date.  The USSR probably anticipated, however, that
 once a date was set, the French government would neither submit
 EDC to a final test in parliament nor try seriously to break
 the military stalemate in Indochina until after the conference.
 Moscow's concept of the role of an international confer-
 ence in settling the Indochina war has been kept vague and
 obscure.   Early in the Berlin conference, Molotov said that
 such a conference could play "the part of a mediator in
 questions which interest us and also in questions where its
 role of mediator can prove useful."   Moscow may have decided
 that the only way to forestall an expanded war is to open
 negotiations for a truce.
 In order to draw the western powers into negotiations on
 Indochina, Moscow has no choice but to agree to their demands
 that the Korean question be given top priority in any discus-
 sion on Far East issues.   The formula for the Geneva meeting

 Approved Forelease 2004/061fACC1ffbP79-009274 00200140001-6
 avoids a basic issue which caused the deadlock at Panmunjom--
 the status of the USSR at a Korean political conference.  Mos-
 cow had consistently rejected the United Nations' recommenda-
 tions on the composition of the conference and had insisted
 on participating as a neutral along with four other Asian
 neutrals, rather than sitting on the Communist side of the
 table.
 Molotov's consent to a discussion of Korea at Geneva does
 not indicate any greater readiness to negotiate seriously for
 a final settlement.   The Communists apparently are still
 satisfied to maintain the present division of Korea.
 The inflexibility of the Soviet proposals on Germany
 again clearly reveals that the USSR cannot afford, or believes
 it unnecessary, to withdraw from East Germany.  Molotov repeated
 his familiar plan for a provisional government to conduct
 elections free from four-power control or "monopolist" in-
 fluence.  He demanded simultaneous negotiations on a peace
 treaty, and submitted a draft with only minor changes from
 that first proposed by the Soviet Union in March 1952.   Only
 Molotov's proposal for troop withdrawal within six months
 was new, but its importance was nullified by provisions to
 retain small contingents and to return troops to Germany
 whenever they were needed for security.
 The Soviet plan for European security, although apparently
 conceived as a grand gesture, failed to lure Western Europe
 away from EDC and NATO.   It marked a change in attitude in
 that for the first time the USSR dropped the bilateral approach
 based on the wartime treaties with Britain and France and
 suggested a multilateral security system.   It is consistent
 with the recent Soviet diplomatic campaign to convince Western
 Europe that it could best achieve security in alliance with
 the USSR and without American participation,  Molotov ha.--,
 since indicated that he will push his "European security"
 proposal, but the Soviet Union appears seriously to exaggerate
 the appeal in Western Europe of any plan calling for American
 withdrawal.
 Molotov described EDC as the primary bar to a settlement
 in Austria.   He said that it was EDC which threatened to
 revive German militarism and bring about the danger of an
 Anschluss, requiring the continued protective occupation
 of Austria after a treaty is signed.   Molotov conceded that
 this occupation should be reconsidered again no later than

 next year, but rejected an Austrian proposal that it end in
 June 1955.  He further demanded a prohibition on Austrian
 participation in military alliances, and later conceded that
 this could take the form of an Austrian declaration attached
 to the treaty.
 The Kremlin apparently did not believe it necessary to
 offer an Austrian settlement at Berlin to prove to the ,hest
 its desire to lessen international tensions.  Austria is to
 remain a chip in a play for larger stakes.   The Kremlin
 apparently calculated that it could afford to maintain the
 status quo in Europe while it turned attention to Asian
 matters which offered greater potential for dividing the
 Western allies.

 FRENCH POLICY ON INDOCHINA BETWEEN BERLIN AND GENEVA
 The scheduling of the Geneva conference, which consider-
 ably enhances the prestige of the Laniel?government, will
 probably afford only temporary relief from the rising pressure
 to end the Indochina war.
 The French press and public are increasingly pessimistic
 over the military stalemate.  The government was able to stave
 off the effects of the recent unfavorable news from Indochina
 only because of the hope that the Berlin conference might lead
 to a solution.  General Navarre has been obliged to give first
 consideration to political factors at home, and the outright
 defeatism expressed by the chiefs of staff of the French army
 and air force on their recent trip to I-ndochina indicates that
 the public's feeling of frustration is now echoed by the military.
 The Laniel cabinet has been sharply divided and Defense Minis-
 ter Pleven, who is returning Lhis week from a personal inspection
 of the Indochina situation, has favored a build-up in Europe
 over increased efforts in Indochina.  Pleven's report and the
 ensuing cabinet discussions may indicate next week how government
 thinking is evolving.   Apparently only evident Communist unwill-
 ingness to seek a settlement at Geneva can win support for a
 prolonged military effort, and even then some assurance of
 victory will be imperative.
 Navarre stated publicly on 19 February that American-directed
 training of the Vietnamese forces is unthinkable, and Paris,
 largely for fear of giving a pretext for Chinese intervention,
 still firmly rebuffs any suggestion that American troops may be
 necessary.   That the latter position may change, however, if the
 Geneva conference removes any hope of a negotiated peace with
 the Chinese or the Viet Minh, is suggested by the remark made
 last week to the American consul in Hanoi by the French secretary
 of state for the army, Pierre de Chevigne.
 Stating that the alternatives in Indochina are now a nego-
 tiated settlement or a "total war" beyond France's capacity to
 fight, De Chevigne hinted that he would not be averse to inter-
 nationalizing the war.  He did not elaborate, but negotiations
 could be tantamount to capitualtion and his statement may thus
 foreshadow a French request for UN intervention.   It is more
 likely, however, that the United States would first be asked
 to furnish troops.

 MIDDLE EAST REACTION TO THE PROPOSED TURKISH-PAKISTANI PACT
 The announcement by Turkey and Pakistan on 19 February that
 they intend to negotiate a treaty of cooperation, open to other
 countries, caused no strong reaction in the Middle East, largely
 because it had been anticipated in widely circulated news stories.
 Allegations are freely being made in Middle East press comment,
 however, that the whole affair is an American arrangement.   When
 the formal agreement is announced, additional unfriendly comment
 may be expected.
 In Pakistan, the pact with Turkey is considered primarily
 a device for obtaining American arms, and the principal reaction,
 official and public, seems to be relief that the way is open now
 for military aid to become a reality.   On 22 February public
 announcement was made in Karachi that Pakistan was requesting
 military assistance from the United States.   Military and politi-
 cal circles, however, will probably be disappointed over the
 size of the contemplated American assistance -- tentatively
 placed at $20,000,000 -- unless assured that the amount is only
 a beginning.
 Announcement of the coming pact was anticlimactic in India,
 where the peak of emotional response had passed with earlier re-
 ports.   Nehru's public utterances on the subject were mile, and
 he contented himself with characterizing the developments as "a
 step which adds to world fears and tensions."  The secretary
 general of the Ministry of External Affairs stated that the agree-
 ment would not improve Indo-Turkish relations.                   Although India
 will continue to view a pact and any military aid to Pakistan as
 inimical to its plans for expanding influence in the Near East,
 it is unlikely to be able to affect developments.
 The Afghan ambassador in Washington stated that Afghanistan
 would wish to adhere to such an association if and when it set-
 tles its differences with Pakistan, the most serious of which is
 the Pushtoonistan problem.   Kabul will probably not adhere to a
 pact in the near future, however, because of fear of the pressure
 which might be applied by the Soviet Union.   In any event, it
 would probably demand an American guarantee of its borders as a
 condition.
 Although Iran apparently approves cooperation between Tur-
 key and Pakistan,  the foreign minister was noncommittal when
 notified, except to indicate pleasure that other states could
 join the pact later.   Iran is unlikely seriously to consider

 joining a regional defense arrangement now, although it may take
 this occasion to press for more military aid.  Any Iranian deci-
 sion to join such an organization would require a major policy
 change, and Tehran would probably demand unusually strong Ameri-
 can assurances of economic, financial, and military support.
 Arab reception of the cooperation agreement and aid to
 Pakistan has been mixed.  Prime Minister Jamali of Iraq indicated
 great sympathy for the purpose of the pact and welcomed enthusi-
 astically an invitation to join, but popular opinion seems un-
 favorable.
 Syria may bolster previous hostile comments with references
 to Western imperialism and the need for Arab solidarity.   Saudi
 Arabia is known to be opposed to the pact but so far has been
 officially silent.  There have been no significant comments from
 Lebanon and Jordan.
 Egyptian reaction has been decidedly negative.   The pact
 is interpreted as defection to the West and as a Western effort
 to break Arab unity.  The minister of war stated that it would
 not be in the interest of Egypt or any Arab country to join the
 agreement before the Arab countries gain their full freedom.
 The government-controlled newspaper Al Misri denounced the agree-
 ment editorially and warned Iraq ago nsTning it.   The news-
 paper concluded that all Arabs should cooperate to defeat the
 American efforts to undermine their front.
 Israel is strongly opposed to any Middle East defense ar-
 rangement which would strengthen the Arab states, and ha  ex-
 pressed concern over the possible inclusion of Iraq in the
 Turkish-Pakistani pact.   The Israeli minister at Ankara asked
 for assurances that Turkey would not furnish Iraq with arms.   If
 Iraq ultimately joins with Turkey and Pakistan, Israel will prob-
 ably ask the West for firm assurances that the balance of power
 will be kept intact between it and the Arab states.

 "NORMALIZATION" BRINGS NO BASIC CHANGE
 IN YUGOSLAV-SOVIET RELATIONS
 Relations between Yugoslavia and the Soviet bloc have been
 partially "normalized" since Stalin's death, but there is no
 reliable information to support stories of an imminent rap-
 prochement.                                   Doubts about Yugoslavia's future orientation have
 been abetted by the Trieste crisis and the purge of Vice Pres-
 ident Djilas, but neither provides indications of any basic
 change in Belgrade's international position.
 The trend to normalization,  initiated by the Soviet Union,
 has so far included the resumption of normal diplomatic repre-
 sentation, the virtual cessation of border incidents, accords
 on certain Danube River problems, and a Yugoslav-Bulgarian
 railroad agreement.
 The volume of anti-Tito propaganda from the Orbit is
 smaller and the tone somewhat less venomous than prior to
 Stalin's death, but Tito and his regime continue to be attacked
 as "exploiters and Western flunkeys.,"   The trade embargo con-
 tinues, although Belgrade recently expressed willingness to
 resume limited trade if the Orbit will make major concessions.
 The USSR's policy toward Yugoslavia appears to be a part
 of the effort to reduce tension between East and West,   I.
 does not appear to envisage a specific attempt to bring Belgrade
 back into the Orbit, although it has included some maneuvers
 designed to arouse Western suspicions of the Belgrade regime,
 There is no reliable evidence to contradict repeated state-
 ments by Yugoslav leaders that they would welcome normal re-
 lations, but would refuse to return to the pre-1948 basis    They
 have stated that Moscow has been forced to change its methods
 to some extent as a result of internal crises.   They maintain
 there is no proof that this is anything more than a tactical
 shift in Soviet policy, which, however, should be exploited.
 The Anglo-American decision to hand over Zone A of Trieste
 to Italian administration struck the Yugoslav leaders as a
 "diktat," and their reaction was strictly in character.   The
 lack of consultation  prior to the act shook their confidence
 in Western intentions, but it is doubtful that the attitude
 of the top leaders such as Tito and Kardelj was permanently
 changed.   The West's subsequent retreat from implementing the
 8 October declaration and its willingness to negotiate,  further-
 more, helped restore the previous Yugoslav attitude of cautious,
 hardheaded cooperation,

 Djilas' removal as a right-wing deviationist from the
 top of the Yugoslav hierarchy provided no evidence that he
 was purged because he was too outspokenly anti-Soviet and
 hence a barrier to closer relations with the Orbit.  An
 intensified campaign inside Yugoslavia against Western in-
 fluences, particularly the United States information programs
 and the church following his ouster may, however, complicate
 relations with the West.
 Mutual suspicions remain the fundamental obstacle to any
 rapprochement.  Yugoslav leaders probably continue to believe
 that Moscow's eventual aim is to substitute a more amenable
 regime in Belgrade and to re-establish its old domination of
 the relationship.   The original fight was over the entire
 system of Soviet operations, and not just a personal quarrel
 of Tito's with Stalin.  The Yugoslavs assert, and probably
 believe, that the USSR has made no fundamental shift in policy.
 The Kremlin, on the other hand, must inevitably have strong
 suspicions that the Tito group, which displayed independent
 tendencies long before the break in June 1948, would not be
 amenable to control or persuasion when its interests conflicted
 with those of the USSR.
 While both sides would obtain some ideological advantages
 in a rapprochement, these do not outweigh the dangers.  From
 Moscow's viewpoint, a rapprochement would eliminate or at least
 obscure the challenge of a major deviationist theory and ex-
 ample.                      It would also discourage Western acceptance of any fu-
 ture potential deviationists from the Orbit and thus dampen the
 hopes of any Communists so inclined.
 These gains might be offset, to the Kremlin, by the un-
 settling impact throughout the Communist world of the idea that
 a regime could break from the USSR's control and later return
 in good standing.  Repercussions in the Orbit would probably
 be less that they would have been a few years ago, because
 Moscow has since tightened its control and purged most of the
 Communist leaders in Eastern Europe with nationalistic tend-
 encies.   Moscow must always guard, however, against a revival
 of such tendencies in the Orbit.
 For Belgrade, a rapprochement would be one way of removing
 the country from exposure to Western ideological concepts.   This
 gain would probably be outweighed for Tito, however, by the loss
 of the regime's independence and world prestige and its self-
 proclaimed role of "trailblazer" to the "socialist future."

 The question is thus finally reduced for the USSR to a
 consideration of how to offer sufficient guarantees of future
 good intentions to overcome Tito's fears, and large enough
 grants of autonomy to satisfy his desire for independence.
 Any Soviet proposals that were sufficient even to interest Tito
 would involve a very large concession by Moscow and would be,
 in effect, a basic change in its strategy.  To date, the gremlin
 has shown no evidence of adopting such a policy in order to
 expand its empire.

 ADENAUER'S PRESENT POSITION ON THE SAAR CONTROVERSY
 Chancellor Adenauer appears ready to resume negotiations
 with France for a Saar settlement, but insists on some assurance
 of early French action on the EDC treaty before he publicly
 commits himself to the concessions he is prepared to make (see
 map, p.  17).   Failure of the two governments to conclude an
 agreement within the next few months would cost the West what
 may be its last chance to establish the EDC.
 When the French-German bilateral talks on the Saar were
 suspended in mid-December because of the French presidential
 elections and the impending Berlin conference, the most trouble-
 some political differences had been largely resolved.   Left for
 discussion, however, were questions relating to the future status
 of the Saar economy, the duration of the agreement envisaged, and
 the designation of an international body to administer Saar ex-
 ternal affairs.   Early this year, however, a special committee
 of the Council of Europe produced a plan for a settlement which
 may serve as a basis for reaching agreement on the remaining
 issues when the bilateral talks resume.
 The council's present plan, a revision of that drawn up by
 the Van der Goes committee last September, offers some concessions
 to the Bonn government by lifting restrictions on West German
 business activities in the Saar and by transferring the mines
 from French control to local direction.   The French-Saar customs
 and currency union is to be maintained, however, pending the
 creation of a common European currency and market, and the present
 French-Saar conventions are to be replaced by a single treaty of
 economic cooperation between the two countries.  The terms of
 these agreements are to be permanent and they are to be reaffirm-
 ed in the German peace treaty when it is finally negotiated.
 This plan had been favorably received, with some minor
 reservations, by Chancellor Adenauer, but on 5 February he in-
 structed his delegates to withdraw their support.  This manuever
 was dictated by his preference for secret bilateral talks in
 which he can secure some additional concessions while concealing
 his own from the Bundestag until French EDC ratification seems
 imminent.   The chancellor is unwilling to antagonize certain
 minor coalition party leaders who are hostile to the Saar's
 permanent loss to Germany, and whose support he now needs as
 both houses of parliament act on the constitutional amendment
 legalizing German rearmament.

 Approved For$@lease 2004/0(P79-009270200140001-6
 The economic portions of the council's plan go far toward
 meeting France's demands that its special economic status in
 the Saar be maintained until there is sufficient progress toward
 an integrated European economy to make this unnecessary.   Owing
 to the uncertain political situation in Paris, however, there
 is no assurance that the government will accept the viewpoint
 of its representatives on the council.
 There are indications that Chancellor Adenauer is anxious
 .to speed agreement on a set of principles for a final settlement,
 and bilateral discussions will almost certainly take place in
 March.   At that time, he is expected to pose the additional
 condition that the Saar agreement not become effective until EDC
 is finally ratified by its last signatory power.  Among other
 things, he will probably ask that the Coal-Steel Community and
 not the Council of Europe, as provided in the council's plan,
 supervise Saar external affairs until the European Political
 Community begins to function.
 Since none of these points directly affects present French-
 Saar economic relationships, they should be generally acceptable
 to France as long as the settlement is permanent, a point which
 Adenauer will probably be forced to concede.
 Adenauer's commitment to the Bonn and Paris treaties as the
 method of restoring Germany's sovereignty almost forces him to
 adopt a conciliatory position toward a Saar settlement.   jince
 such a settlement involves the permanent loss of the Saar   how-
 ever, domestic political considerations force him to seek French
 assurances of early EDC ratification which he can point to as
 a compensating advance toward the unification of Western Europe.
 The French government's ability to give such assurances
 remains problematical.   There is general agreement in Paris that
 a Saar settlement is an indispensable precondition for assembly
 action, and Foreign Minister Bidault has now reportedly written
 Adenauer suggesting the resumption of French-German negotiations.
 But such complicating factors as the recent course of the Indo-
 china war and the forthcoming Geneva conference make it somewhat
 harder for the government to give Adenauer the promises he seeks.
