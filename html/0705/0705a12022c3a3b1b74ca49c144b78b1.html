		     	the  Third  Plenary  Session?    	What  is  it  that  stands  in  the  way  of  some  of  the

  _		  	of  some  cadres  and  soldiers  toward  the  party  line,  programs,  and  policies  be

		    	problems  is  not  too  profound  or  not  tao  clear,  Xiang  Zhonghua,  political  commissar

		     	experience  has  shown  that  this  series  of  programs  and  policies  entirely  accord  with
		     	China's  circumstances  and  have  been  fully  supported  by  the  masses  of  people.    	The
		     	huge  changes  and  progress  made  in  China  during  t:ie  past  2 years,   	and  the  presently
		     	very  good  political  and  economic  situation  are  the  result  of  implementation  of  the
		     	line,  ~~rograms,   	and  policies  since  the  Third  Plenary  Session.
		     	The  Spirit  of  the  Present  Central  Work  Conference  and  the  Overall  Guiding  Thought
		     	of  the  Third  Plenary  Session  Are  Synonymous
		     	While  stu~lying  the  spirit  of  the  Central  Work  ConfErence,  some  cadres  and  soldiers
		     	supposed  that  Central  Work  Conference  changes  in  programs  of  the  Third  Plenary
		     	Session  amounted  to  correction  of  "deviations"  of  some  policies  since  the  Third
		     	Plenary  Session.    	How  should  this  question  be  viewed?    	Political  commissar  Xiang
   	-		  	noted  in  this  speech  that  it  is  necessary  to  affirm,   	first  of  all,   	that  since  the
		     	time  of  the  Third  Plenary  Session  up  until  the  present,   	there  have  been  no  changes
		     	in  the  overall  guiding  thought  of  the  party's  seeking  truth  in  facts,   	and  thoroughly
		     	correcting  leftist  errors.    	Beginning  with  the  realities  of  the  state  of  the  nation,
  _		  	and  hidden  dangers  currently  existing  in  the  economy,   	this  Central  Work  Conference
		     	decided  on  further  readjustment  of  the  national  economy,  deciding  to  get  rid  of
		     	tentative  plans  and  sub~ectively  high  criteria  not  geared  to  actual  circumstances,
		     	so  that  the  country's  economy  can  gradually  divest  itself  of  the   	fetters  of  leftist
		    	mistakes,  and  L-ake  the  path  of  steady  and  healthy  development.    	This  is  precisely
		    	what  the  guiding  thought  of  the  Third  Plenary  Session  sought  to  accomplish,   	and  it
		     	is  also  a  continuation  of  the  policy  of  "readjustment,   	consolidation,   	restructuring,
		     	and  improvement."    	However,   	as  with  everything  where  changes  occur  in  development,
		    	programs  and  policies  since  the  Third  Plenary  Session  have,   	in  t:he  course  of  their
		     	implementation,   	been  subject  to  enrichment,   	to  perfection,   	and  to  development.
		    	Nothing  is  immutable.    	We  cannot  use  a  static  concept  tc~  view  changes  ~.n  policies.
  �		  	He  said  that  since  the  Third  Plenary  Session,  party  programs  and  policies  have
		     	developed,   	first  of  all,   	under  constant  eradication  of  various  disturbances.    	These
		     	included  the  disturbance  of  the  two  "whatevers,"  the  disturbance  of  the  liberaliza-
		     	tion  trend  of  thought,  and  the  sabotage  of  elements  who  crave  nothing  short  of
		    	nationwide  chaos.    	It  was   	the  elimination  of  these  "l~ftist"  right  disturbances
		     	that  tested  the  correctness  of  the  progra~ns  of  the  Third  Plenary  Session,   	and
   	.		  	enriched  and  developed  the  actual  content  of  .*.he  Third  Plenary  Session's  programs.
		    	Acting  in  accordance  with  current  realities,   	and  while  emphasizing  the  surmounting
		    	of  leftist  mistakes,   	this  Central  Work  Conference,  pointed  to  real  planning  weak-
		    	nesses,   	conducted  necessary  criticism  and  struggle  against  tendencies   	to  cancel  out
		     	or  oppose  the  party  leadership,   	ar.td  struck  firm  blows  against  anti-party  and  anti-
		     	socialist  activities  and  against  criminal  activities.    	This  was  only  as  it  should
		    	be.    	This  not  only  signifies  no  change  in  the  programs  of  the  Third  Plenary  Session,
		    	but  also  happens  to  support,   	as  well,   	the  Third  Plenary  Session's  principle  of
		    	seeking  truth  in  facts,   	and  supports  the  direction  and  objectives  set  by  the  Third
		    	Plenary  Session.    	Second,   	as  a  result  of  changes  in  development  of  the  objective
		    	situation,   	the  party's  policies  also  require  commensurate  readjustment  and  augmen-
		     	tation.
  ~		  	The  Third  Plenary  Session's  two  documents  on  the  development  of  agriculture,   	for
		    	example,   	have  been  shown  to  be  effective  in  practice.    	But  faced  with  a  developing
		    	situation,   	the  C^ntral  Co~nittee  last  year  additionally  issued  document  number  75

		 	the  "gang  of  four,"  and  before  and  after  the  Third  Plenary  Session  and  after  having
		 	found  the  crux  of  the  problem.    	In  other  words,   	to  sunpose  that  today's  specific	   	~

																							 	.
		 	Why  is   	it   	that  some  comrades  are  unable  to  proper].y  understand  the  line,   	the  programs;
		 	and  the  policies  of  the  Third  Plenary  Session?    	Political  Co~issar  Xiang  said,   	I
		 	agree  with  the  views  of  many  comrades   	at  this  political  work  conference.    	Looked
		 	at  in  ternu^  of  ideological  understanding,   	there  are  two  principal  impediments:    	One
		 	is   	the  effects  of  the  erroneous  leftist  ideology.    	For  the  past  20  years,   	the  mis--
		 	takes  our  party  has  made  have  been  largely  "leftist"  mistakes.    	For  a  long  time,
		 	all  of  us  have  lived  and  worked  under  the  guidance  of  "leftist"  ideology,  and  have�
		 	studied  and  propagandized  what  is  embodied  in  "leftism"  as  the  correct  line.    	To	 	"
		 	one  degree  or  another,   	"leftist"  ideology  has  left  an  imprint  in  our  brains.    	Now,     	�
		 	some  comrades  are  still  filled  with  misgivings  and  vacillate  in  indecision  about
		 	the  Third  Plenary  Session  as  the  result  of  the  mischief  caused  by  the  "leftist"
		 	thing.    	For  exampie,   	as  soon  as  a  shift  in  work  emphasis  comes  up,  some  comrades
		 	suppose  abandonment  of  class  struggle  is  meant;   	as  soon  as  talk  turns  to  emancipa=     	'
		 	tion  of  the  mentality,   	they  suppose  this  means   	the  four  fundamental  principles  are
			not  wanted;   	and  as  soon  as  the  need  for  adequate  appraisal  of  the  effects  of  leftist~'
		 	ideology  is  raised,   	eradication  of  the  influence  of  "leftist"  mistakes  remains  an
		 	arduous  task.    	Then  there  is  capitalist  liberalism,  anarchy,   	and  extremism.    	This
		 	is  a  very  powerful  centrifugal  force  and  a  corrodent.    	Today  there  actually  exists
  _	     	in  the  armed  forces  a  minority  of  people  who  are  wavering  politically  about  the
		 	four  fundamental  principles,  and  who  ideologically  believe  in  "everyman  for  himself
		 	and  the  devil  take  the  hindmost,"  and  "money  is  omnipotent,"  and  such  capitalist  `
			articles  of  faith.    	Organizationally,   	they  want  only  democracy  and  freedom  rather
		 	than  organizational  discipline,   	and  some  have  even  progressed  to  opportunism  and
			profiteering,   	corruption  and  larceny,   	and  smuggling  of  people  out  of  the  c~untry.
		 	Such  people  must  inevitably  be  ideologically  incompatible  with  the  party  line,  its		'
			programs,   	and  policies,   	and  their  actions  must  inevitably  encroach  upon  the  welfare
			of  the  majority  of  people,   	and  cannot  be  countenanced  by  party  discipline,  milita~ty    	-
			discipline,   	and  the  laws  of  the  land.    	Commissar  Xiang  noted  that  those  two
			erroneous  ideologies  differ  in  outward  form,   	and  they  likewi~e  impede  our'true	     	~
			undei-standing  and  implementation  of  the  line,   	programs,  and  policies  of  the  party.     	�

		    	How  can  the  muddled  understanding  and  erroneous  ideology  toward  the  party's  line,
		    	its  programs  and  policies  that  is  reflected  by  some  cadres  and  soldiers  be  given

		    	about  policies,  persevere  in  "tfiree  not-ism,"  let  e~~eryone  speak  what  is  on  his
		    	mind  and  speak  what  is  in  his  heart,  after  which  he  should  be  led  through  a  point
		    	by  point  solution  to  problems.    	When  it  comes  to  ideological  understanding,  people
		    	cannot  be  gagged,   	cannot  be  coerced,   	and  can  even  less  be  "scared  into  submission."
		    	Nowadays  some  comrades  pit  political  conform~ty  against  democratic  expression,   	and
		    	dare  not  express  doubts  that  are  in  their  minds.    	It  should  be  realized  that  ideo-
		    	logical  conformity  is  the  foundation  for  political  conformity,   	and  so  it  is  neces-
		    	sary  to  place  principal  efforts  on  raising  the  consciousnesses  of  cadres  and
		    	soldiers,   	and  then  to  do  a  good  job  of  political  ideology.    	Commi~sar  Xiang  noted
		    	that  gathering  from  currently  reported  circumstances,   	the  problems  with  most
		    	comrades  are  problems  of  ideological  understanding,   	and  those  who  stand  in  a  posi-
		    	tion  of  opposition  to  the  party's  line,  programs,   	and  policies  are  extremely  few.
  -		  	We  must  strictly  distinguish  problems  of  ideological  understanding  from  political
		    	problems,   	and  unite  maintenance  of  unanimity  with  the  CCP  Central  Committee  and
		    	carrying  forward  democracy  within  the  party,   	so  that,   	through  study,   	everyone  will
		    	be  truly  uplifted  ideologically.    	Naturally,   	statements  and  actions  that  evidence
		    	real  opposition  to  the  party  and  to  socialism,  we  urlll  not  be  soft  on,   	and  we  shall

		     	IMPORTANCE  OF  COMPULSORY  MILITARY  SERVICE  DISCUSSED
		    	Guangzhou  ZI~ADTSHI  BAO  in  Chinese  7  Jan  81  p  4
		     	~Article:    	"Important  Significance  of  China's  Institution  of  a  System  of  Compulsory
		    	Military  Service"]
		     	~Excerpt~    	China's  Current  Military  Service  System  ~
		    	With  the  founding  of  the  Chinese  People's  Republic,  our  army  was   	the  national
 _		  	armed  force.    	Internally  it  was  responsible  for  consolidation  of  the  dictatorship
		    	of  the  proletariat,   	for  consolidation  of  the  fruits  of  victory  of  the  people's
		     	revolution,  and  for  suppressing  resistance  by  all  counterrevolutionary  elements.
		    	Externaliy,   	it  was  responsible  for  defense  against  imperialist  aggression  and
		     	subversion,   	for  safeguarding  the  socialist  revolution  and  socialist  construction,
		     	for  protecting  the  sovereignty  and   	territorial  integrity  of  the  nation,  and  for
		    	maintaining  wprld  peace.    	Its  new  duties  were  at  once  both  formidable  and
		     	glorious,   	requiring  that  we  have  not  only  a  powerful  army,  but  also  a  powerful
		    	air  force  and  navy,  and  requiring  not  only  that  we  have  powerful  forces  on  duty,
		    	but  also  powerfut  forces  in  reserve.    	However,  because  of  the  lack  of  a  fixed
		     	period  of  recruitment  and  a  retirement  system,  a  voluntary  military  service  system
		     	could  not  meet  the  requirements  of  the  new  era.   	Since  we  had  built  a  nation  for
		     	the  people,   	everyone  had  responsibility  for  safeguarding  his  own  country,  ar.d
		     	everyone  should  take  up  this  responsibility  for  safeguarding  the  motherland.
		     	Therefore,   	when  the  Chinese  People's  Republic  was  founded,   	it  was  decided  "to
		     	mak~  ready  for  the  institution  of  a  system  of  compulsory  military  service  at  the
		     	proper  time."    	At  the  Second  Session  of  the  First  National  People's  Congress  on
		     	30  July  1955,   	the  "Military  Service  Law  of  the  Chinese  People's  Republic"  was
		     	discussed,   	promulgated,  and  put  into  effect  on  the  same  day  by  the  chairman  of
		     	the  Chinese  People's  Republic.    	The  "Military  Service  Law  of  the  Chinese  People's
		     	Republic"  was  a  law  for  the  performance  of  military  service  under  which  the
		     	Chinese  people  could  consolidate  their  awn  national  defense  and  safeguard  their
		     	own  welfare.    	It  stipulated  that  all  citizens  fully  18  years  of  age  have  a  duty
  -		   	to  perform  mili~ary  service.    	Beginning  in  1955,   	China  instituted  compulsor~
		    	military  service.    	The  First  Session  of  the  Fifth  National  People's  Congress
		     	Standing  Committee  held  on  5  March  1978  discussed  and  approved  ~~Decisiona  of
		     	Problems  in  the  Military  Service  System"  put  forward  by  the  State  Council,
		     	deciding  ~o  change  China's  compulsory  military  service  system  into  a  combined
		     	compulsory  and  volunteer  military  service  system  for  longterm  service  in  the
		     	armed  forces.    	This  is  China.'s  existing  military  service  system.

			 	In  the  20-odd  years  during  which  a  system  of  compulsory  military  service  has  been

			 	1.    	Institution  of  a  system  of  compulsory  military  service  is  for  the  purposes

			 	country  and  for  everybody  fairly  and  sensibly  to  undertake  military  duties.
			 	Ours   	is  a  country  that  belor.~s   	to  the  people  themselves.    	The  people  are  the
			 	masters  of  the  country,  %.~nd  the  security  of  the  country  depends  on  defense  by
			 	the  people  as  a  whole.    	However,  would  it  be  workable  for  everyone  to  be  a
			 	soldier?    	No.    	Our  mili.tary  personnel  meet  a  fixed  numerical  quota,  and  were
			 	this  numerical  quota  ra  be  exceeded,  both  the  state  and   	the  people  would  bear
			 	an  unconsciona.lly  heavy  burden.    	'I'here  are  also  certain  requirements  for  being
			 	a  soldier,  and  if  one  does  not  meet  these  requirements,   	it  would  impair  fulfill-
			 	ment  of  missions.    	Consequently,   	from  among  the  large  numbers  of  youths  who
			 	annually  rush  to  register,   	the  state  can  select  only  a  relatively~few  outstati.�:~g
			 	ones   	to  enter  military  service.    	Each  year  a  group  is  inducted,  and  a  group  is
			 	retired,   	so  that  the  broad  masses  of  youths  who  meet  age  requirements  have  oppor-
			 	tunity  to  perform  their  duty.     	This  way  is  both  relatively  fair  and  alsu  rela-
			 	tively  sensible.   	During  the  period  of  service,  one  can  both  perform  one's  duty
			 	and  learn  military  techniques,   	improve  ideological  consciousness  and  cultural
			 	levels,  and  be  severely  tempered  by  life  in  the  armed  forces.
			 	2.    	Compulsory  military  service  can  accumulate  for  the  country  large  numbers  of
			 	reservists  who  have  undergone  training,  assuring  that  such  war  suddenly  break
				out,   	our  military  forces  could  steadily  enlarge  and  replenish  soldiers  with  the
			 	elements  of  training.    	There  are  numerous  points  of  difference  between  modern
				warfare  and  the  warfare  of   	the  past.    	One  is  the  large  scale  and  the  suddenness

		  	of  the  outbreak  of  fighting,   	frequently  requiring  mobilization  of  several  million
		  	in  the  armed  forces.    	Without  a  large  number  of  reservists,  victory  in  war  would
		  	be  difficult  to  attain.    	Second  is  the  suddenness  of  modern  warfare,  with
		  	hosCilities  breaking  out  at  once,  possibly  on  any  given  morning.    	Unless  one  ia
		  	able  to  assure  rapid  mobilization  of  a  large  number  of  trained  troops,   	the  country
		  	may  suffer  severe  destruction,  and  great  lossQS  of  people's   	lives  and  property  ma.y
		  	ensue.    	Third  is  the  large-scale  use  of  all  kinds  of  modern  new  weapons  and  equip-
		  	ment,  and  scientific  techniques,   	things  such  as  new  types  of  aircraft,   	large  gun~,
		  	tanks,  naval  vessels,  military  electronic  technology,  rocket  technlogy,   	laser
		  	techr~ology,   	etc.    	Unless  advance  training  has  been  given  the  troops,  once  war
		  	breaks  out,   	it  is  not  possible  to  master  well  the  use  of  advanced  weapons  and
		  	technical  equipment.    	In  order  to  meet  these  characteristics  of  modern  warfare,
		  	we  must  have  planned  accumulation  of  large  numbers  of  troops  who  have  ander~,one
		  	training.    	With  compulsory  military  service,   	call-ups  at  fixed  time3  and  retire-
		  	ments  at  fixed  times  permit  annual  induction  of  a  certain  numher  of  youths  into
		  	the  armed  forces  where  they  are  given  military  and  politi~;al  traini.ng  and  readied
		  	for  combat.    	Annua~ly,  as  well,  a  group  of  strenuously  trained  ~;arriors  who  ha.ve
		  	completed  their  periods  of  militar.y  service,  retire  from  active  service  to  become
		  	national  reservists.    	In  the  more  than  20  years  since  institution  of  compulsory
		  	military  service,   	China  has  accumulated  rather  abundant  reservists.    	When  needed
		  	by  the  country,   	these  reservists  can  be  sent  in  an  endless  stream  as  replacements
		  	in  military  units  or  be  rapidly  organized  into  newly  created  combat  units  and
		  	local  military  forces;   	so  that  aggressors  will  sink  in  a  boundless  ocean  of
		  	people's  war.    	For  example,  during  the  period  of  self-defense  counterattack  on
		  	the  Sino-Vietnam  border,   	in  order  to  respond  to  the  call  of  the  motherland  for
		  	call-up  of  forces  in  wa.rtime,  and  to  assure  full  strength  of  uuits,  in  Yulin
		  	Prefecture  in  Guangxi  Province  alone,  4.267  retired  servicemen  below  25  years
		  	of  age  registered  for  induction,  pex~nitting  units  to  replenish  their  strength  at
		  	once,   	increase  their  combat  ca~abilities,  and  assure  completion  of  combat  missions.
		  	3.    	The  system  of  compulsory  militaxy  service  can  also  save  manpower  and  material
  -			resources  in  norma.l  times  for  use  in  strengthening  the  building  of  the  national
		  	economy.    	China.  today  is  still  rather  poar,  and  its  economy  is  insufficiently  well
 =			developed.    	We  want  to  ha.sten  the  speed  of  economic  construction,  and  make  China
		  	a  modern  agricultural,   	industrial  power  with  modern  national  defense,  and  modern
		  	science  and  technology  in  this  century.    	This  is  a  glorious  mission  that  history
		  	has  bestowed  upon  us.    	Military  expenditures  are  a  very  large  figure.    	Military
 _			personnel  mostly  do  not  create  material  wealth  for  society,  but  rather  consume
		  	ma.terial  wealth.    	If  the  amount  is  excessive  and  military  expenditures  too  great,
		  	this  holds  back  the  building  of  the  national  economy.    	Therefore,  we  must  correctly
		  	handle  the  relationship  between  the  buildup  in  national  defense  and  the  buildup  of
		  	the  economy,    	whereby  the  number  of  people  in  the  armed  forces  are  at  the  optimum
		  	level  so  that  military  spending  as  a  proportion  of  national  disbursements  is  kept
		  	in  proper  balance.    	Institution  of  a  system  of  compulsory  military  service  is  a
		  	fine  way  ~f  achieving  this.    	This  is  because,  when  the  country  has  such  a  system,
		  	in  normal  times  it  can  maintain  the  number  of  troops  at  a  relatively  low  level
		  	and  conserve  a  certain  amount  of  military  expenditures.    	In  this  way  the  country
		  	can.  use  the  manpower,   	material  and  financial  resources  thus  saved  in  building  the
		  	economy  to  hasten  the  pace  of  the  four  modernizations  construction,  so  as   	to
		  	realize  the  four  modernizations  at  an  early  time.

			 	In  summary,  a  system  of  compulsory  military  service  not  only  enhances  China's
			 	defense  force  needs,  but  also  enhances  needs  for  construction  of  the  national
			 	economy,    	It  also  accords  with  the  longterm  interests  of  the  country  and  the
   	_		    	people,  and  accords  with  the  present  interests  of  the  country  and  the  people.
			 	Thus,  it  ~ray  be  said  that  a  system  of  compulsory  military  service  is  commensurate
   	_		    	with  the  advanced  and  sensible  system  of  mi.litary  service  of  China's  cur.rent  situ-

		    	are  preparing  to  pass   	their  eighth  night  here.
		    	Eight  days  ago,  our  guards  discovered  frequent  border  activities  by  Vietnamese
		    	secret  service  units  who  were  vainly  attempting  to  ~abotage  the  Naxi  hydroelectric
		    	power  station  on  the  border.    	This  hydropower  station  supplies  electricity  to

		   	[Article  by  Hao  Sheng   	[6787  6115]:    	"Atomic  Bombs  Should  Be  Made,  But  Hand  Grenades
		  	Should  Not  Be  Tossed  Aside"]
		   	[TextJ    	A  combat  training  section  chief  who  fought  in  the  Self-defense  Counterattack
  -			Operation  said  it  this  way:		In  this  fight,  hand  grenades  and  satchel  charges  were
		  	used  to  good  effect,  but  proportionately  speaking,  what  killed  and  wounded  the  enemy
		  	most  was  the  various  kinds  of  guns  and  autowatic  weapons."    	There�ore,   	he  concluded,
		   	"attention  to  armaments,   	doing  a  good  job  of   	training,  and  keeping  ones  eyes  only
		   	on  hand  grenades  will  not  do;   	it  is  necessary  to  look  ahead."
		   	Hand  grenades  have  their  place.    	Without  going  into  the  war  year~  of  the  past,   	they
		   	demonstrated  their  power  in  the  recent  Sino-Vietnamese  border  self-def ense  counter-
		   	attack  operations.    	It  would  not  be  fair  to  ignore  the  function  of  hand  grenades.
		   	However,  hand  grenades  are  only  hand  grenades  after  all,   	and  to  exaggerate  their
  ,		 	power  would  be  improper  as  well.
		   	While  basing  onself  on  what  one  has,   	look  toward  developments.    	Our  armed  forces
		   	are  presently  in  a  period  of  historical  transition  of  millet  plus  infantry  rifles,
		   	and  aircraft  plus  large  guns  to  conventional  weapons  plus  speeial  weapons.    	Our
		   	method  is:    	thorough  training  in  the  weapons  we  p4ssess,   	study  of  science  and
		   	culture,   	and  further  combine  men  and  weapons  in  order  to  create  conditions  for
		   	mastery  of  newer  equipment.    	If  we  simply  grumble  about  the  modernization  of  arms
		   	and  equipment  and  put  aside  existing  arm~  and  equipment  and  not  train  with  them,   	or
		   	if  we  do  not  study  the  modern  military  science  that  faces  us,  when  the  enemy  comes
		   	what  weapons  will  be  used  to  annihilate  him?    	When  new  equipment  comes  into  our
		   	hands,   	what  skills  will  we  possess  to  put  them  to  use?
		   	If  one  bases  himself  on  the  equipment  in  his  possession  on  the  one  hand  while
  "		 	hastening  the  modernization  of  weapons  and  equipment  on  the  other,  will  that  render
		   	him  unable  to  make  a  decision?    	It  will  not.    	The  relationship  between  the  two  is
		   	one  of  particular  things  improving  as  tlie  general  situation  improves.    	In  handling
		   	the  development  of  weapons  and  equipment,   	the  proper  attitude  should  be  firm  con-
		   	viction  that  victory  is  entirely  attainable  through  the  use  of  weapons  and
		   	equipment  in  ones  po:,,:,~ssion,  while  resolving  gradually  to  improve  weapons  and
		   	equipment,   	steadily  modernizing  them.    	To  use  a  common  saying  to  express  the  idea:

		  	[Article:    	"Be  a  Qualified  Commander"]
		  	[Text]    	People  praise  Comrade  Shan  Da   	[1472  1129]   	as  "a  truly  outstanding  commander
		  	and  a  qualif ied  commander."    	Comrade  5han  Da  deserves  such  praise.
		  	An  outstanding  and  qualified  commander  must  po:~sess  at  least  two  qualities:
		  	resourcefulness  and  courage.    	Resourcefulness  and  courage  on  the  battlefield  are
  -	     	qualities  discussed  in  ancient  and  modern  times  in  both  China  and  abroad.    	Sun  Zi
		  	placed  resourcefulness  and  courage  as  the  two  ma.jor  attributes  to  be  cultivated  by
		  	commanders.    	The  "Book  of  History"  said,  "When  a  person  is  valiant  and  clever,  he
  -	     	may  act,    	placing  resourcefulness  and  courage  on  an  equal  plain.    	Marx  and  Engles
		  	said,   	"There  are  two  kinds  of  bravery:    	surpassing  bravery,  and  bravery  lacking  in
		  	intelligence."    	("Collected  Works  of  Marx  and  Engels,"  Vol  6,  p  359),  which  more		.
		  	clearly  emphasizes  the  unity  of  resourcefulness  and  courage.    	To  possess  courage
		  	without  resourcefulness  is  to  be  a  clumsy,   	death-defying  bungler,  which  we  do  not
  -	     	need.    	To  possess  courage  without  resourcefulness,  when  the  guns  sound,  one  will  be
		  	at  a  loss  about  what  to  do.    	Naturally,   	if  one  cannot  put  his  resourcefulness  to
		  	use,  he  will  sustain  defeat.    	Only  with  a  combination  of  courage  and  resourcefuln~~ss
		  	can  one  command  forces,  overcome  the  enemy,  and  attain  victory.    	Shan  Da  advanced
		  	bravely,   	charged  and  shattered  the  enemy's  positions,   	judged  the  hour  and  sized
		  	up  the  situation,  and  acted  flexibly  just  as  a  commander  possessed  of  resourceful-
		  	ness  and  courage  should.    	Troops  have  heartfelt  confidence  in  such  a  commander  and
		  	will  resolutely  obey  his  commands  and  listen  to  his  directions  with  heartfelt
		  	admiration.    	Thus  it  becomes  possible  to  have  confidence  from  top  to bottom,   	to  be
		  	of  one  heart  and  one  mind,  and  to  march  together  to  win  victory  in  battle.
		  	Courage  is  one  thing  and  resourcefulness  is  another.    	Put  the  two  together  and
		  	only  then  is  victory  possible.    	For  many  years  Lin  Biao  and  the  "gang  of  four"
		  	mad~  a  mess  of   	this  truth.    	They  distorted  the  spirit  of  bravery,   	threw  tactical
		  	thinking  into  confusion,  and  "criticized"  the  accurate  saying  that  a"superbly
		  	skilled  person  has  great  courage."    	This  was  extremely  damagining  to  the  training
  -			of  our  cadres,   	particularly  to  improving  c~mmand  skills  within  the  armed  forces.
		  	One  ma.y  often  hear  the  following  said  among  some  grassroots  level  cadres:    	"When
		  	we're  fighting,   	if  superiors  want  us  to  attack,  we  attack;   	if  they  want  us  to
		  	defend,  we  defend.    	All  we  have  to  do  is  obey  orders  and  listen  to  commands."    	By

		     	r~sponsibilities,  and  scope  of  command.    	"Ingenuity  in  application  is  a  matter  for
		     	the  person  taking  action."    	In  the  application  of  tactics,   	each  echelon  has  its
		     	own  ingenious  ways.    	If  one  is  not  versed  in  the  command  techniques  of  one's  own
		     	echelon,  when  higher  authorities  orders  that  you  attack,  you  will  be  unable  to
		     	strike  w;th  irresistable  force,  and  if  they  order  ~ou  to  defend,  you  will  be  hard
		  	~  put  to  really  hold  fast.    	For  units  as  large  as  regiments  or  armies,  when  commands
		     	are  bad,   	the  mission  cannot  be  accompli5hed.    	In  the  person  oi  a  commander,   	issuing
		     	commands  and  receiving  commands  have  always  been  closely  related.    	If  you  cannot
  _		  	command,  you  may  not  be  able  to  follow  commands  reliably,   	either,  and  may  become~
		     	like  a  storeyed  house  built  on  a  sandy  beach.    	When  superior  authority  commanded
		     	Shan  Da  to  lead  a  dagger  platoon  in  an  attack  on  certain  high  ground,  had  he  not
		    	understood  the  command  or  blindly  issued  a  command,   	the  high  ground  would  not  have
		    	been  taken  and  the  combat  intentions  of  superior  authority  would  not  be  fulfilled.
		     	In  that  case,  no  matter		  	steadfastly  he  "listened  to  commands,"  would  become
		     	a  hollow  phrase,  would  it  not?
		    	Cadre  training  is  the  key  point,  but  af ter  many  years  of  saying  this,   	it  is  still
		    	just  a  point  without  being  the  key  point.    	There  is  a  tendency  in  this  that  is
		     	deserving  of  attention,  namely  supposijg  that  techniques  are  firm  guidance  but
		     	that  tactics  are  soft  guidance,  and  consequently  emphasizing  techniques  while
		     	slighting  tactics.    	Techniques  are  the  foundation  for  tactics.    	When  Shan  Da  was
		     	on  the  battlefield,  because  he  was  able  to  fire  rocket  launchers,  was  able  to  use
  _		  	walkie-talkies,   	and  could  sight  targets  for  the  artillery,  he  was  able  to  handle
		     	tactical  command  with  ease  and  proficiency.    	In  this  sense,   	emphasis  on  technique
		     	cannot  be  considered  wrong.    	Tactics  are  the  assurance  that  techniques  will  play
		     	their  full  role.    	During  this  combat,  use  of  small  groups  against  dispersed  forces
		     	and  the  searching  out  of  forces  in  concealment  demonstrated  the  power  of  correct
		    	utilization  and  variation  of  tactics.    	Unless  tactics  have  a  built  in  system  for
		    	changing  as  the  enemy  changes,   	or  changing  ahead  of  the  enemy,   	then  even  though
		    	one  may  be  superior  in  rifles  and  guns,   	not  all  of  them  may  be  able  to  be  used,
		    	coordination  may  be  bad,   	and  one  may  mistakenly  injure  one's  own  troops,    	There-
		     	fore,   	to  slight  tactics  is  unreasonable.    	As  far  as  our  own  commanders  are  concerned,
		    	a  general  knowledge  of  all  kinds  of  weapons,   	their  requirements  for  use,  and  their
		    	combat  capabilities  is  essential,   	but  the  key  still  lies  in  the  study  of  tactics
		    	and  striving  to  master  command  techniques  for  one's  own  echelon  of  organizatio~:.
		    	If  one  were  to  say  soldiers  are  "courageous  and  technical,"  then  commanders  must
		    	be  "courageous  and  tactical."    	The  problem  now  is  that  leadership  comrades  in  some
		    	units  are  a  little  "partial."    	They  are  interested  only  in  things  such  as  the  number
		    	of  points  or  the  number  of  ineters,  but  are  unable  to  become  interested  in  the
		     	tactical  training  of  cadres.    	Some  f eel  that  "the  study  of  formations  is  not
		    	agreeable,   	and  the  study  of  tactics  is  not  something  people  are  good  at."    	Under
		     	the  influence  of  such  a  mentality,   	even  if  some  tactical  training  is  given,   	it  is,
		    	"the  squads  attack  bim  bam;  platoons  attack  for  5  minutes;   	companies  attack  in  a
		    	big  uproar."    	Quality  is  not  high.    	A  rapid  end  to  this  state  of  affairs  may  be
		    	said  to  be  an  urgent  matter  of  the  moment  in  the  reform  of  training.
		    	Insufficient  att~ntion  to  the  study  of  strategy  and  tactics,  and  insufficient
		    	attention  to  improving  the  standards  for  command  are  related  to  the  failure  of

	     	some  of  our  comrades  to  divorce  themselves  from  the  fetters  of  a  single  branch  of
			service  mental  concept,   	and  accustomed  attitudes.    	Fighting  armies  are  presently  in
			a  historical   	stage   	of  change  from  single  branches  of  service  to  combined  forces:
	     	As  both  the  enemy  and  our  own  weapons  and  equipment  develop,    	there  will  be  great
			changes,   	as  well,   	in  the  style  of  warfare.    	In  order  to  adapt  to  these  changes,
			troop  training  and  combat  must  see  great  changes.    	When  tables  of  equipment,
			education,   	training,  and  command  organization  are  shown  to  be  unsuitable,  and  when
			new  problems  appear,   	they  must  be  rapidly  studied  and  solved.    	When  we  speak  of
			being  a  qualified  commander,   	their  term  "qualif ied"  means  a  process  of  constantly
			moving  forward  as  circumstances  change.    	Thoseformerly qualified  for  combat  cominand
			may  be  still  qualif ied  for  combat  command  today,  or  they  may  not  be  qualified.    	Those
			who  went  through  the  recent  self-defense  counterattack  combat  can  see  this  problem
			very  clearly  can't  they?    	At  the  1975  enlarged  Military  Aff airs  Committee  meeting,
			deputy  chairman  Deng  Xiaoping  spoke  very  descriptively:    	To  be  a  company  coim.~ander
			today  is  not  the  same  as  being  a  company  commander  in  the  past.    	The  company
 -	     	commander  of   	the  past  would  pick  up  his  Mauser  pistol  and   	'charge'!    	It's  not  that
			easy  now,  and  it  is  different  than  it  used  to  be.    	The  company  commander's  needs
		 	for  information  are  much  greater  than  formerly.    	When  war  breaks  out  and  you  have
		 	several  tanks  and  an  artillery  company  attached  to  your  unit,  how  will  you  command
		 	them!    	The  talk  here  is  about  a  company  commander,  and  the  question  is  to  a  company
		 	commander.    	But  it  would  also  not  hurt  for  our  battalion  commanders,  regimental
		 	commanders,   	or  even  our  divisional  or  army  commanders  to  ask  themselves:    	Are  my
		 	commanders  qualified  or  not?    	When  a  new  war  comes,  what  kind  of  an  answer  will  I
		 	be  able  to  give?

		     	[Article  by  Correspondent  Luo  Tongsong   	[5012  0681   	2646]:    	"Navy  Intensifies
		    	Headquarters  Training  for  All  Echelons  of  Senior  Off icers  To  Meet  Requirements  of
		    	Modern  Naval  War  and  To  Increase  Organization  and  Command  Capabilities"]
		     	[Text]    	Recently  the  navy  conducted  an  examination  and  summarization  of  this  year's
		    	headquarters  training  for  senior  officers,   	and  set  f orth  the  future  direction  and
		    	requirements  of  training.
		    	During  recent  years  substantial  transfers  of  personnel  in  combat  units  of  various
  _		  	naval  forces  have  taken  place,  and  some  staff  off icers  are  not  well-versed  in
		    	wartime  command  work.    	In  a  situation  of  constant  development  of  naval  techniques
		    	and  equipment,   	in  particular,   	in  which  electronic  confrontation  has  become  a  major
		     	technique  of  naval  war,  and  in  which  guided  missiles   	are  gradually  becoming  ma~or
		     	strike  weapons,   	greater  demands  are  placed  on  headquarters  work.    	Not  only  to  staff
		    	pe~sonnel  urgently  require  improvement  of   	their  prof essional  abilities,  but  even
		     	those  staff  personnel  in  position  for  a  rather  long  period  of  tfine  who  possess
		     	rather  strong  professional  skills  also  require  constant  understanding  of  new  cir-
		     	cumstances  and  study  of  new  problems  in  order  to  meet  the  requirements  of  modern
		     	naval  war.
 -		   	Beginning  this  year,   	senior  officers  and  leadership  organizations  in  the  navy  will
		     	devote  strict  attention  to  senior  officer  headquarters  training.    	Navy  leadership
		     	organizations  have  set  up  professional  military  training  units  for  the  participation
		     	of  senior  naval  officers  and  large  unit  leadership  comrades  for  the  purpose  of
		     	exploring  the  characteristics  of  future  naval  combat,  as  well  as  the  guiding  combat
		     	mentality  and  the  tactical  and  strategic  principles   	f or  our  own  forces.    	As  of  now,
		     	10  courses  have  been  set  up  requiring  72  r.ours  of   	study.    	Headquarters  is  operating
		     	three  staff  off icer  training  classes  for  the  study  of  general  information  about
		     	naval  branches,  navigation,  and  staff  functions.    	During  August,   	two  short  training
		     	courses  were  organized  on  the  subject  of  "Military  Applications  of  Overall  Planning
		     	Methods"  in  which  more  than  300  professional  cadres  were  training.    	At  the  instiga-
		     	tion  of  naval  leadership  organizations,   	all  f leets,   	bases,  detachments,  and  garrison
		     	districts  are  also  giving  serious  attention  to  senior  officers  headquarters  training.
		     	During  the  first  half  of   	the  year,  units  abave  the  d ivision  level  in  the  North  Sea
 -		   	Fleet  ran  a  total  of   	i0  staff  training  courses.    	The  South  China  Sea  Fleet  organized

	     	China  Sea  Fleet  convened  leadershtp  cadre  exercise  meetings  for  above  division  level
			in  which  exercise  experiences  were  summarized  and  exchanged  and  chart  work  done.
 -	    	Units  at  certain  bases  of   	the  East  China  Sea  Fleet  organized  staff  personnel  for
			group  training  more  than  40  times,  with  more  than  1,430  people  participating  in
			the  training.
			In  the  course  of  the  senior  officer  headquarters  training,   	each  echelan  was  at  some
			pains  to  closely  approximate  actual  combat.    	Some  units  combined  the  craracteristics
			of  their  naval  area  with  tasks  handed  them  by  superior  authorities  to  conduct
			diligent  study  and  exercise  training.    	Some  units  organized  airmen,   	submarines,
  -	    	destroyers,   	guided  missile  boats,   	and  other  surface  craft  to  participate  in
			combined  exercises  to  train  combat  units  under  various  complex  circumstances,
			and  to  put  into  practice  organizational  and  command  capabilities.
			In  the  course  of  training,  all  units  also  lay  great  stress  on  major  training  points..,:
			The  number  one  characteristic  of  modern  naval  warfare  is  speed.    	"Targeting,"
			"calculating,"  and  "commanding"  must  be  done  quickly  and  accurately.    	This  is  a
			masterly  ski'1   	that  staff  personnel  must  prepare.    	In  the  training  process  for  each
			unit,   	staff   	~ersonnel  were  required  quickly,  accurately,   	and  in  a  minimum  amount
			of   	time  to  p"lot  the  foe's  p~sition  relative  to  our  own.    	Some  units  also  required
			rapidly  calculating  the  time,  direction,  and  speed  of  attack  of  four  or  five  assault_
			groups.

			The  serious  attention  given  sen.~.or  off icer  headquarters  training  by  the  navy  made
			a11  echelons of headquarters  and  staff  personnel  well-versed  in  combat  operations,
			and  increased  their  combat  professional  levels.    	A  certain  base  made  spot  examina-
			tion  of  the  chief  and  deputy  chief  of  staff,  and  of  35  section  chiefs  and  staff
			personnel  of  a  division  level  unit  in  which  the  problem  was  attack  on  an  enemy	     	,
			cruiser  formation.    	Examination  results  showed  overall  evaluation  of  proficiency  at
			better  than  good.    	Some  comrades  said  that  the  correlation  of  the  enemy  situation
			and  repeated  exerctses  gave  training  a  quality  of  realism.    	A  month's  concentrated   	;

			 	Motherland"]
			  	~Text~    	The  responsibilities  we  shoulder  are  lofty;   	the  obligations  to  the  mother-
			 	land  that  we  fulfill  are  glorious,  and  both  th~  motherland  and  the  people  hold
			 	extremely  great  expectations  of  us.    	Consequently,  we  must  overcome  impure  motives
			 	for  entering  military  service,  establish  a  correct  attitude  of  military  service,
			 	and  wholeheartedly  fulfill  the  glorious  obligation  of  defending  the  motherland.
			 	In  order  to  defend  the  motherland,   	comrades  consciously  submit  to  the  needs  of  the
			 	motherland,   	coming  from  everywhere  including  cities,  rural  villages,   	industrial
  "		     	plants,  and  schools   	to  ~oin  the  armed  forces.    	Some  comrades  give  up  opportunities
			 	to  go  into  industrial  plants  or  attend  university,  and  some  give  up  substantial
  -		     	wage  income  and  comfortable  living  conditions  to  enter  military  units  to  fulfill
			 	obligations  amply  demonstrating  a  patriotic  awareness,  which  is  praiseworthy.
			 	However,  as  the  result  of  a  lack  of  awareness  on  the  part  of  some  of  our  comrades
			 	about  becoming  soldiers  to  fulfill  obligations,  after  they  become  soldiers,   	they
			 	frequently  are  unable  to  handle  the  interrelationship  between  individual  weliare
			 	and  fulfillment  of  obligations  to  the  people,  and  feel  they  have  suffered  as  a
			 	result  of  being  a  soldier.    	Everyone  knows  that  certain  rights  ~nd  certain  ob liga-
			 	tions  are  mutually  complementary.    	If  in  earlier  times  the  people  of  the  entire
			 	country  ha.d  not  undertaken  and  obligation  to  resist  the  Japanese  and  fight  the
			 	Chiang  Ka.i-shek  bandits,   	what  right  would  the  people  have  today  to  be  masters  in
			 	their  own  house.    	Unless  we  undertake  our  obligation  to  defend  the  motherland
			 	today  and  safeguard  the  four  modernizations,  what  right  will  we  have  in  future  to
			 	enjoy  the  well-being  of  a"comfortable  family?"    	In  taking  responsibility  for  the
			 	defense  of  our  motherland  and  the  obligation  to  safeguard  the  four  modernizations,
			 	our  armed   	forces  are  representing  the  fundamental  welfare  of  the  working  people,
			 	which  ramifies  to  the  well-being  of  posterity.   	Consequently,   	from  the  day  that  we
			 	become  soldiers,   	we  should  unconditionally  subordinate  our  individua.l  welfares
			 	to  the  welfare  of   	the  revolution.    	During  Spring  and  Autumn  Times,   	Sima  Rangju,  a
			 	general,   	said:    	"kYhen  you  receive  orders,  forget  your  families;  when  you  face
			 	military  regimentation  forget  your  relatives,  and  when  you  fee~  anxious  at  the
			 	sound  of  the  rolling  battle  drums,   	forget  your  own  safety."    	If  the  ancients  could
		     	.be  this  way  about  the  country,  we  should  be  possessed  of  ar.  even  greater  spirit
			 	of  self-sacrifi~e.

			Some  comrad~s  enter  military   	service  to  find  individual  opportunities  for  them-
			se1T!es.    	Their  way  of   	thinking  is,    	First  year  as  a  soldier,   	second  year  in  the
			party,  and  third  year  get  a  discharge  and  enter  a  plant."    	Otherwise  they  `hink
			of  driving  motor  vehilcles,  b ecoming  a  health  worker,  or  learning  a  technique  of
			some  kind  to  catch  hold  of  an  "iron  ricebowl."    	Thus,   	they  become  soldiers,  not
			to  fulfill  obligations,  but  rather  to  parlay  their  situation  into  going  into  a
			city  to  find  a  job.    	Comrade:   	should  think  that  every  year  the  armed  forces  call
			up  large  numbers  of  youths  f rom  rural  villages  to  enter  military  service,  while
			at  the  same  time  a   	large  numb er  of  old  soldiers  retire.    	In  the  current  situation
			in  which  China's  productivi ty  is  fairly  backward,   	if  everyone  goes  into  the  city
		 	or  ;oes  into  an  industrial  p lant,  how  much  of  an  increase  of  people  eating
		 	commo4ity  grain  will  occur  in  the  citzes?    	How  can  the  country  stand  it?    	Unless     	~
		 	rural  youths  return  to  rural  villages,   	on  whom  will  the  modernization  of  agricul-
		 	ture  depend  for  its  fulfillment?    	If  everybody  in  the  armed  forces  would  like  to
		 	do  technical  work,  who  will   	do  the  non-technical  work,  and  how  will  combat  and
		 	other  tasks  be  completed?    	Therefore,  when  we  become  soldiers,  we  must  establish
		 	a  concept  of  fulfillment  of   	obligations,  and  not  have  as  our  goal  the  finding  of
		 	opportunities  for  ourselves.    	Our  "opportunity"  lies  not  in  going  into  cities  but
		 	in  remaining  in  rural  villages,  and  neither  does  iC  lie  in  becoming  an  industrial   	,

		 	some  particular  work,   	but  ra ther  in  making  a  contribution  to  the  modernization
		 	of  the  country  no  matter  wha t  work  we  may  do.    	Some  comrades  haqe  the  right  idea  '
		 	when  fihey  say  that  revolutionary  work  contains  all  trades  and  professions,   	each
		 	possessing  its  own  leading  authority,  and  each  having  a  future.    	So  long  as  during
		 	our  period  of  military  servi ce  we  strive  to  learn  the  skill  of  serving  the  people  .
		 	and  improve  our  competence,   	no  matter  where  we  ma.y  go  in  the  future,   	there  will
		 	be  bright  prospects.    	When  p roductivity  decrea.ses,   	family  economic  income  must
		 	inevitably  decrease  as  we11,   	and  livelihood  becomes  somewhat  impaired.    	However,
		 	the  more  wealthy  the  country  becomes,  and  the  more  the  four  modernizations  develop;
  -	     	the  more  our  personal  welfa re  can  be  realized.    	One  cannot  suppose  on  this  account
		 	that  to  become  a  soldier  is   	to  get  the  worst  of  things.    	Combat  hero  Liang  Yingrui;'
		  	[2733  5391  3843~   	said  it  well:    	"Without   	trees,  where  would  fruit  come  from~  and
		 	without  a  country.,  where  wou ld  the  family  come  from?"    	We  otten  speak  of  "protec-
		 	ting  the  family  and  defending  the  country."
  ~	     	This  concisely  and  clearly  explains  the  inevitable  relationship  between  protectin~~
		  	the  country  and  protecting  the  family.    	When  we  become  a  soldier  today  it  is  not:   	'
		  	just  to  protect  the  millions  upon  millions  of  parents,  brothers,   	and  sisters,   	it`...
		 	is  also  for  the  purpose  of  p rotecr.ing  one's  own  parents,  brothers  and  sisters.
		  	It  is  not  only  to  protect  the  fami.lies  of  others,  but  also  to  protect  one's  own     	Y
		  	family.    	In  this  sense,  how  can  we  get  the  worst  of  things  when  we  become  soldiers,~

			 	for  the  people,   	the  families  of  numerous  ma.rtyrs  sent  the  younger  brothers  and
			 	younger  sisters  of  the  martyrs  to  military  units  to  take  up  the  ~.~ms   	left  by  the
			 	mQrtyrs.    	If  one  says  tha.t  to  be  a  soldier  is  to  get  the  worst  of   	things,  why  then
			 	did  they  keep  on  taking  the  worst  of  things  and  go  looking  for  the  worst  of  thinga?
  -		    	Qn  the  contrary,   	they  not  only  had  no  sense  of  getting  the  worst  of  things,  but
			 	felt  exalted.		We  should  learn  from  the  revolutiona.ry  martyrs,   	and  correctly
			 	handle  the  relationship  between  the  welfare  of  the  revolution  and  personal  welfare.
			 	We  should  also  realize  that  the  party  and  government  as  well  as   	the  broad  masses
			 	of  people  are  exceptionally  solicitous  about  the  livelihood  of  the  families  of
			 	soldiers,  have  taken  a  series  of  ineasures,  and  have  exerted  very  great  efforts
			 	to  look  after  them  and  give  them  preferential  treatment.    	After  rural  villages
			 	implemented  the  party's  economic  policies  and  instituted  systems   	of  responsibility
			 	for  production,   	the  CCP  Central  Committee  and  government  departments  at  all
			 	echelons  adapted  to  the  new  situation,  adopting  various  measures   	to  assure  that
			 	the  livelihood  of  dependents  of  military  martyrs  would  be  no  longer  than  tha.t  of
			 	local  co~une  members  at  the  medium  level.    	The  "CCP  Central  Commi ttee  Decisions
			 	on  Some  Questions  Concerning  the  Acceleration  of  Agricultural  Development"  clearly
			 	stipulated  tha.t  once  rural  villages  have  instituted  systems  of  responsibility  for
				production,   	"as  the  collective  economy  develops,  collective  welfare  endeavors
			 	should  gradually  be  undertaken  whereby  the  old  and  the  infirm,   	orphans  and  wi.dows,
			 	disabled  commune  members,  and  disabled  military  men,  and  the  fauii lies  of  martyrs
			 	receive  greater  assurance  of  their  livelihoods."    	Each  province,   	municipality  and
				autonomous  regions  has  done  a  lot  of  work  in  the  implementation  c~f  party  policies
			 	on  special  care  for disabled  servicemen,  and  for  family  members  of   	revolutiona.ry
				martyrs  and  servicemen.    	At  the  Third  Session  of  the  Fifth  National  People's
			 	Congress,  numerous  delegates  referred  to  the  issue  of  supporting  the  armed  forces
				and  giving  special  care  to   	their  dependents.    	In  the  course  of  discussions,   	some
				made  speeches  saying  that  "effective  measures  should  be  taken  to  resolve  hardships
  _		    	in  the  families  of  soldiers,  and  that  just  as  during  the  period  of  the  Red  Army,
			 	the  livelihood  of  the  families  of  soldiers  should  be  no  lower  than  it  had  been
				before  the  soldier  entered  the  armed  forces."    	In  actual  fact,   	every  jurisdiction
				is  in  prqcess  of  implementating  special  care  policies  in  accordance  with  instruc-
				tions  from  the  Central  Committee.    	Some  of  our  military  units  have  also  received
				numerous  notices  in  the  wail  of  preferential  workpoints  and  cash  assistance.    	Of
				course,   	the  families  of  some  comrades  continue  to  suffer  hardships   	in  their  lives
  _		    	and  we  should  believe  that  on  this  issue  the  party  and  the  government  wi11  gradu-
				ally  help  find  solutions.
				Some  urban  comrades  who  entered  military  service  had  formerly  intended  to  enter
				~iniversity  or  take  up  an  occupation.    	Now  they  have  answered  the  call  to  enter
  -		    	the  armed  forces.    	Their  thoughts  had  been  "first  to  college  and   	then  to  work,
				but  never  becoming  a  soldier."    	They  regarded  soldiering  as  a  course  of  last
				resort,  and  this  view  is  also  a  wrong  one.    	Unless  it  is  corrected,  it  may  easily
 _		    	produce  an  attitude  of  simply  muddling  through  in  one  way  or  another  for  the  three

		    	The  question  is  now  that   	they  are  soldiers,  is   	that  worse  than  going  to  college
		    	or  taking  up  an  occupation.    	We  say  that  being  a  soldier  is  the  fulfillment  of  an
		    	obligati~n  and  not  the  selection  of  a  profession.   	It  is  different  from  taking  up
		    	an  occupation  or  going  to  college.    	The  people  of  the  motherland  have  confidence
		     	in  us,  and  have  handed  us  the  guns.    	It  is  incumbent  upon  us  earnestly  and	     	.
		     	conscientiously  to  fulfill  our  obligation  and  tak~~  up  the  heavy  burden  the  people:
		    	have  given  us.    	This  glorious  position  also  provides  us  a  fine  opportunity  to,.t.~_
		     	temger  ourselves.     	After  several  years  of  tempering,  improvement  in  our  ideol-:   	:
		     	ogical  consciousness,   	further  strengthening  of  our  will,  and  increase  in  our.
  =		   	cultural  knowledge  and  some  specialized  knowledge  will  create  better  conditions~.~
		     	for  our  future  employment.    	If  you  lackadaisically  muddle  through  a  few  years  in...
		     	the  armed  forces,  neither  striving  to  learn  nor  assiduously  tempering  yourself,
		    	but  rather  throwing  your  youth  away  for  nothing,  without  making  any  progress  so   	'
 _		   	that  you  possess  no  skills   	to  take  up  future  employment,  you  can  only  blam^  your
		     	own  incorrect  attitude.
		     	Still  other  comrades   	figure  that  they  will  first  become  soldiers  when  they  go  inCo
		     	the  armed  forces,  and   	then  become  cadres  with  some  official  position,   	figuring
		     	that   	this  is  fulfillment  of  their  obligations  as  soldiers.    	Nowadays,   	in  order  to
		     	improve  the  military  and  political  quality  of  cadres,  our  armed  forces  ha.ve  changed
		     	the  system  of  selecting  cadres   	directly  from  among  company  level  soldiers,   	reQuir-
		     	ing   	that  they  undergo   	training  in  military  schools.    	Some  cadres  that   	their  desire
		     	to  be  a  cadre  is  a  good  one,  and  that  all  they  have  to  do  is  strive  to  learn
		     	military  ma.tters,  politics  and  culture  and  meet  other  requirements.    	Then  af ter..-.
		     	testing    	shows  them  qualified,   	they  will  be  able  to  enter  a  military  school  for
		     	further    	preparation  and  become  a  cadre.    	But  this  is  a  matter  of  future  develop-
		     	ment.    	For  the  moment,  most  important  is  fulfillment  of  obligations,  and  being  a'
		     	good  soldier.    	This   	is  to  say  that  conscripts  do  not  necessarily  have  no  chance.~
		     	of  entering  military  schools  for  study  to  become  cadres,  but  neither  does  it  meaa
		     	that  you  will  be  promoted  to  cadre  simply  because  you  have  become  a  soldier.		.
		     	If  one  holds  to  the  idea  of  becoming  a  soldier  in  order  to  become  a  cadre,   	it  may
		     	be  very  difficu?t  for  one  to  become  an  "official,"  because  if  you  are  thinking.~only
		     	of  yourself,  and  calculating  everything  in  terms  of  becoming  an  official,  you
		     	cannot  consciously  fulfill  your  obligations.    	And  if  you  cannot  do  a  good  job  of!
		     	being  a  compulsory  suldier,  how  can  ~ou  expect  to  be  a  cadre?				     	�
		     	Still  other  comrades  have  rather  simple  ideas.    	They  are  not  concerned  with  working
		     	or  not  working,  or  whether  they  have  a  lot  of  money  or  little;  all  they  care  about
		     	is   	traveling  around,   	seeing  everything  possible,  and  hoping  with  all  their  hearts
		     	to  go  to  a  large  city.    	This  is,   	in  fact,  unrealistic.    	Where  military  forces:;~~~
		     	garrisoned,  and  the  duties   	they  perform  are  the  result  of  consid~ration  of  the:..~
		     	overall  situation  and  the  needs   	for  combat  preparedness.    	When  we  become  soldiers,
		     	we  may  possibly  go  to  a  bustling  city,  or  possibly  to  somewhat  out-of-the-way  rural
		     	village,  or  possibly  to  an  uninhabited  island  or  border  area.    	None  of  this  can
		     	be  changed   	to  suit  our  individual  wills.    	It  mu~t  also  be  realized  at  the  same    	,
		     	time  that  we  are  carrying  out  lofty  and  glorious  responsibilities,  and  we  canao~t-~
		     	think  only  of  light  tasks,  but.,rather  must  be  mentally  prepared  to  sweat  a.'great

		     	to  shed  blood  in  resolute  fulfillment  of  the  heavy  trust  of  the  peopl~`of  the
		     	motherland.    	Being  a  soldier  cannot  be  regarded  as  something  that  is  nice  and:    	~
		     	relaxed  and  a  lot  of  fun.    	Of  course,  depending  on  mission  requirements,  movement

			 	But  the  "horizon"  of  hoping  to  be  sent   	to  a  large  city,  is  too  narrow  a  one.
			 	Strictly  Require  Oneself  To  Be  an  Outstanding  Conscript
			 	It  is  by  no  means  strange  that  among  comrades  who  strictly  require  themselves  to
			 	be  outstanding  draftees   	that  there  is   	this  or  that  kind  of  petty  concern.    	Bef~re
			 	they  have  understood  the  ~neaning  of  fulfilling  their  obligations  as  soldiers,    	it
			 	is  difficult  for  some  comrades  not  to  have  this  or  that  idea.    	But  once  we  under-
			 	stand  the  rationale  for  fulfillment  of  obligations  as  soldiers,  we  should   	rid
			 	ourselves  of  those  petty  concerns,  and   	earnestly  fulfill  our  obligations  as  fully
			 	as  possible.    	It  must  be  acknowledged   	tha t  in  the  fulfillment  of  obligations  as
  ~		    	soldiers,   	some  matters  of  individual  welfare  must  be  temporarily  shelved.
			 	In  terms  of  the  iuanediate,   	one  might  say  this  is  a  hardship.    	But  hardhip  of  this
			 	kind  is  for  the  fundamental  welfare  of  the  people,   	and  is  entirely  appropriate.
			 	The  loftiness  of  responsibility  and  the  gl~ry  of  duty  of  a  people's  soldier  lie
			 	precisely  in  making  this  kind  of  sacrifice.    	Moreover,   	every  youth  of  age  must
			 	encounter  a  similar  problem.    	In  long  range   	terms,   	fulfillment  of  obligations  as
				a  soldier,   	safeguarding  the  security  of  the  motherland,  and  defending  the  building
			 	of  the  four  modernizations  is,  at  once,   	also  safeguarding  the  peacPful  work  of
			 	one's  own  parents,  brothers  and  sister s.    	Is  it  not  true  that  our  generation  is
				able  to  grow  up  in  health  because  during  the  past  more  than  20  years  group  after
				group  of  youths  became  soldiers  and  carried  out  their  obligations,   	guaranteeing
			 	the  security  of  the  motherland  and  creating  for  us  a  peaceful  environment  in  which
  _		    	smooth  growth  was  possible?    	Today  when  we  fulfill  our  obligations,   	the  young
				children  also  benefit.    	As  far  as   	our  working  people  are  concerned,   	if  we  depart
				from  the  security  of  the  country,   	the   	independence  of  our  people  and  the  prosperity
				of   	the  motherland,   	there  will  be  no  individual  or  family  well-being,  and  that  wi11
				indeed  be  great  suffering.    	Furthermore,  we  should  also  realize  that  even  though
				everyone  fulfills  obligations,   	the  government  still  gives  our  families  needed
				material  care  and  glorious  political   	treatment.    	For  comrades,  all  clothing,   	food
				and  housing  needs  are  provided  for,  f or  some  better  than  before  they  became
  -		    	soldiers.    	During  their  period  of  military  service,   	comrades  can  also  become
  -		    	steeled,  can  study  various  techniques,   	and  can  increase  their  knowledge,  creating
				valuable  conditions  for  their  future  growth.    	We  must  not  overlook  this,  being
				concerned  only  with  hardships  and  not  about  benefits.
				In  summary,  we  must  combine  individual  welfare  and  the  overall  welfare,  and  ur~iL-y
				immediate  welfare  and  the  longterm  welfare,  bearing  firmly  in  mind  the  great   	trust
  -		    	of  the  motherland  and  the  people,   	never  forgetting  that  one  is  a  glorious  soldier
				of  the  people  being  tempered  in  the  great  furnace  of  the  revolution,   	fulfilling
				one's  duty  and  fulfilling  one's  responsibilities  in  standing  guard  and  of  doing
				sentry  duty  for  the  motherland,  and  fulfilling  the  various  missions   	that  the
				party  and  the  people  have  handed  us.    	In  launching  a  movement  for  striving  to  be

		     	to  the  front  as  a  major  target  of  attaclc.    	In  World  War  II,  one  of  the  major
		     	reasons  for  Germany's  defeat  was  that  its  rear  was  not  consolidated.    	The  German
		     	force's  battle  line  was  wide  and  long,   	and  the  rear  areas  were  weakly  defended
   	-		  	with  no  attention  being  given  to  their  defense.    	The  Soviet  forces  used  this  weak-
		     	ness  of  the  German  forces  t~  organize  various  kinds  of  small  force  units  to  attack
		     	the  German  force's  rear  supply  lines,   	finally  making  it  impossible  for  German  army
		     	logistics  to  continue  to  support  the  war,   	and  being  wiped  out  in  the  end.    	Apart
		     	from  the  political  reasons  for  Napoleon's  defeat  on  his  distant  march  into  Russia,
		     	another  reason  was  a  lack  of  precautionary  defense  of  his  supply  lines,  which
  _		  	consequently  sustained  attack  and  destruction  at  the  hands  of  the  Russian  forces.
  ,		   	From  this  may  be  seen  that  in  order  to  take  full  and  timely  advantage  of  the  role
		     	of  various  supply  techniques  and  comba~  materials  in  modern  warfare,  and  to  assure
		     	uninterrupted  supply  to  combat  forces  by  rear  area  supply,  a  rather  strong
		     	logistics  defense  force  is  needed.
		     	How  can  logistics  defense  forces  be  strengthened.    	A  look  at  the  situation  of
		     	China's  forces  today  shows  only  four  ways  of  doing  the  job:
		     	Building  a  logistics  defense  unit.    	From  the  time  of  founding  up  until  the  present
  -		   	time,  China's  armed  forces  have  r~ever  had  a  specialized  lugistics  defense  unit.
		     	Along  with  the  need  to  modernize  China's  armed  =orces  will  come  security  functions,
		     	personnel  assignments  and  an  organizational  structure  on  behalf  of  logistic5  in
		     	the  armed  forces.    	Today  when  we  propose  the  establishment  of  defense  units,
		     	platoons,   	and  organizations  within  the  table  of  organization  of  logistics,   	it  is
		     	because  of   	the  changes  in  our  own  forces  and  the  situation  existing  in  the  armed	   	~
		     	forces  of  numerous  countries.    	The  United  States  armed  forces,  for  example,   	give
		     	serious  attention  to  strengthening  of  logistics  defense  forces.    	The  United  States
		     	Army  National  Guard  established  the  139  Rear  Area  Combat  Center  in  Raleigh,  North
		     	Carolina  in  1973.    	It  was  organized  from  among  toops  of  the  30th  Armored  Infantry

		    	given  them,   	our  railroad  troops,   	engineers,   	and  linemen  could  become  a  strong

		    	rear  area  logistics  tactical  and  technical  training  rear  area  logistics  defense
		    	furces  should  undergo  diversified  special  knowledge  training,  and  while  undergoing

		    	which  each  person  should  be  required  to  thoroughly  master  his  own  weapon  and  be
  -		 	able  to  use  terrain  features  in  defensive  combat.    	Logistics  personnel  training  and
		    	defense  forces  training  should  have  a  different  emphasis,  and  content  of   	training,
		    	courses,  and  times  should  be  of  suitable  proportions.
		    	Organizing  Militia  to  Do  Defense  Work.    	Countless  times  during  the  revolutionary
		    	war  and  during  the  more  recent  defensive  counterattack  combat  against  Vietnam,
		    	militia  have  supported  the  front  lines  and  guarded  the  rear,  making  great  contribu-
		    	tions  in  both  and  demonstrating  the  great  power  of  people's  war.    	However,  because
  -		 	modern  wars  of  the  future  will  be  conducted  in  three  dimensions  with  battlefield
		    	conditions  being  complex  and  ever  changing,   	f or  militia  to  undertake  the  arduous
		    	task  of  defending  rear  area  logistics,   	they  must  be  thoroughly  organized  and
		    	rationally  used.    	The  main  matters  that  must  be  given  attention  are  as  follows:
  -		  	(1)    	When  militia  participate  in  wartime  rear  area  logistics  defense,   	they  must
		    	be  organized  su�ficiently  well  in  advance  with  emergency  training  being  given  them
		    	on  top  of   	their  regular  training,   	so  that  they  will  understand  their  duties,  and
		    	be  familiar  with  the  organizational  structure  and  personnel.    	Under  ordinary  cir-
		    	cumstances,  militia  should  not  be  permitted  to  carxy  out  their  duties  alone.    	The
		    	militia  organization  also  should  not  be  made  large,   	for  when  the  military  organ-
		    	izations  become  large,   	it  presents  a  large  target  and  becomes  prone  to  enemy
		    	attack.    	Most  militia  organizations  should  consist  of  small  platoons  exercisit;,,
		    	their  duties.    	These  small  platoons  should  operate  in  conjunction  with  defense
		    	forces  or  be  organized  and  led  by  persons  from  main  force  units.    	All  militia
  .		  	platoons  should  operate  under  the  overall  organization  and  command  of  rear  area
  -		  	logistics  defense  units,   	platoons   	(or  teams).
		    	(2)    	Participation  of  militia  in  defense  work  should  be  permitted  only  after
		    	selection.    	Depending  on  the  quality  of  military  and  political  training  and  the
		    	health  of  common  militiamen  and  grassroots  cadre  militiamen,  militia  platoons  or
		    	teams  should  be  organized  to  undertake  different  kinds  of  defense  tasks.    	Militia

				It  will  be  a  major  force  in  carrying  out  various  kinds  of  marine  security  for  the
		     	army  and  the  airforce.    	Because  of  the  development  and  renewal  of  equipment  of  the
				army  boat  units,   	the  "Army  Boat  Ma.nagement  System"  promulgated  by  the  General
		     	Logistics  Department  in  1960  is  no  lon.ger  suitable.    	Following  investigation  and
				~tudy  by  the  three  departments,  summarization  of  30  years  of  practical  experiences
		     	by  army  boat  units,   	and  absorption  of  advanced  experiences  of  the  navy  and  ather
   	_		   	technical  branches  of  service,   	the  "Chinese  People's  Liberation  Army  Army  boat

		     	[Text]    	It  is  said  nowadays  that  the  armed  forces  will  be  mechanized  and  modernized,
  -		   	so  mules  and  horses  have  become  an  antiquated  means  of  transportation  with  little
		     	use.    	Consequently,   	in  some  units,  mules  and  horses  have  no.t  been  a  matter  of  con-
		     	cern  for  a  long  time;   	their  feeding  and  care  has  been  careless,   	and  they  are  with-

		     	the  use  of  military  horses  directly  involved  in  combat  with  combattant  units,  a
		     	large  number  of  civilian  horses  were  used  to  support  the  front,   	transporting

		     	to  mare  than  one-third  the  total  amount  of  goods  transported.    	During  fighting  in
		     	the  direction  of  Caobinh,   	in  particular,  as  our  forces  advanced  to  the  Banong  area,
		     	tlza  enemy  put  up  a  lite  and  death  struggle,   	suddenly  dynamicing  the  d~w  of  a  reser-
		     	voir  and  sending  a  torrent  of  water  to  cover  the  highways.    	Motor  vehicles  could
		    	not  pass,   	and  under  these  circumstances,   	commanders  actively  or~anized  mules  and
		    	horses  for  transport,  actually  transporting  case  after  case  of  war  material  to  the
  _		   	front  lines   	to  assure  victory  in  the  battle.    	These  facts  strongly  attest  to  tY~
		     	continuing  important  function  and  position  of  mules  and  horses  in  modern  warfare.
 -		   	Considering  that  any  future  war  in  our  region  will  be  i*~  mountains,  hills,   	and
		     	forest  areas,  and  be  limited  by  the  topography  and  the  roads,   	in  situations  where
		     	transportation  of  materials  by  motor  vehicles  would  be  very  difficult,   	in  order  to
		    	maintain  the  mobility  of  forces  and  supply  logistical  materials,   	it  would  be
		    	necessary  to  make  the  most  of  the  role  of  mules  and  horses.    	As  Deputy  Chairman  Ye
		    	Jianying  said:    	"In  future  wars,  both  plains  and  mountain  areas  will  be  battle-
		     	fields,  but  in  holding  out  for  long  periods  of  time,  mountair?  areas  will  be  impor-
		    	tant.    	Consequently,  mules  and  horses  cannot  be  neglected.    	Motor  vehicles,  mules
		    	and  horses  are  two  legs  to  walk  on."
		    	Additionally,   	it  is  necessary  to  realize  that  China  is  still  very  poor,  and  that
		    	science  and  technology  is  not  developed.    	In  order  to  further  readjust  the  national
 -		   	economy,   	it  is  not  possible  to  allocate  more  funds   	to  replace  the  equipment  of  the

		    	armed  forces.    	Therefore,  a  process  will  be  required  to  mechanize  and  modernize
		    	China's  armed  forces.    	We  must  base  ourselves  upon  the  use  of  inferior  equipment
		    	tn  win  victory  over  enemies  with  superior  equipment.    	Mules  and horses  continue  to
		    	be  a  major  combat  force  and  cannot  be  suddenly  abolished.    	In  the  case  of  the  two
		    	super  powers,   	the  United  States  and  the  Soviet  Union,   	despite  their  possession
		    	of  the  world's  most  advanced  transportation  equipment,   	for  the  defense  of  their
		    	own  soil,   	they  still  maintain  a  certain  number  of  military  horses.    	Therefore,  we
		    	must  keep  our  eyes  on  the  overall  situation  on  the  one  hand,   	think  of  the  future,
		    	and  actively  improve  upon  our  antiquated  weapons  and  equipment.    	On  the  other  hand,
		    	it  is  also  necessary  to  face  current  realities  and  do  a  better  job  of  military
		    	horse  work.    	Every  echelon  of  leadership  should  take  this  task  firmly  in  hand,
		    	place  it  on  their  agendas,   	discuss  it  several  times  each  year,  make  all  ot�`  efforts
		    	several  times  each  year,  build  up  a  corps  of  military  pack  train  drivers,   	intensify
		    	training  with  military  horses,  be  conscientious  about  prevention  and  treatment  of  ;
		    	military  horse  illnesses,   	do  a  good  job  of  military  horse  material  supply,  and		~
  _		  	assure  that  every  military  horse  is  plump  and  sturdy,   	able  to  pack  supplies  and
 -		  	fit  to  travel.    	In  this  way,  when  fighting  breaks  out,  victory  will  be  more  secure`.
