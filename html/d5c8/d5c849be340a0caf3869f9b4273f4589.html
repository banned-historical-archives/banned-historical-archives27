 CHINA:   A PERSPECTIVE ON THE SPIRITUAL POLLUTION CAMPAIGN
 Summary
 China's  two-month old   campaign against  "spiritual
 pollution"--a  codephrase     deriding liberalizing  trends  in
 ideology--has  begun  to wind down,  although  the   concern for
 ideological conformity  and. social   control that triggered  the
 campaign has not abated.   We    believe the  campaign is  being reined
 in primarily because it had become ?a  vehicle for     attacking
 elements  of the reform program--such  as  the    agricultural
 responsibility system--and had.aroused foreign speculation that
 it might  adversely affect China's  open-door policy.   '`Because  the
 campaign  exacerbated a  longstanding dispute within  the party  over
 the role of ideology  in  society,  we believe  the issue will emerge
 The confusion  generated  by the  spiritual   pollution issue and
 by  the   contradictory  guidance emanating from Beijing suggests
 that   some political   jockeying occurred within    the Politburo over
 the scope and   targets 'of the  campaign.   We  do not believe  the
 situation  verged on  a major power strugFle,   but  available
 evidence  does  suggest  that  strains and disagreements  developed
 during    the  course of the campaign, contributing  to  confusion  at
 lower levels'.   General Secretary Hu Yaobang at  times   appeared  to
 be  a  target  of damaging criticism for.tolerating spiritual
 pollution,     but was nonetheless instrumental  in  curtailing  the
 excesses of  the  campaign.    Insofar           as  any light has  been shed on
 Chinese leadership dynamics,  we believe  the    campaign has
 underscored  the potential constraining forces       that party  and army
 conservatives  can have on  the reform program  and On              the political
 conduct  of Deng's  successors.
 This memorandum was prepared  by members of the Domestic
 Policy Branch,  Office of East Asian Analysis,       Directorate of

 Origins of the campaignl
 Although the spiritual pollution issue--in various forms--
 has been debated in China for years, we are not certain why Deng
 chose to highlight the issue in his speech to the 2nd Plenum of
 the 12th Central Committee in mid-October.   That Deng himself has
 been concerned with the question of "liberalism" and unorthodox
 ideas among writers and artists is clear from his key speeches
 over the last five years.   Furthermore, the issue involves very
 fundamental  philosophical problems that have plagued party
 ideologues ever since the fall of the Gang of Four, namely how to
 manage the contradiction between promoting material progress
 through economic reform and maintaining ideological orthodoxy and
 tight social.controls.   Chinese-leaders also want to avoid a
 Polish-style situation and to combat the cynicism that has
 afflicted the Darty and the society at large regarding'"Communist
 For Deng and his old guard Politburo colleagues, the
 solution seems to be to reiterate orthodox Marxist concepts, to
 maintain party domination of intellectual  life,  and to shut off
 debate when it affects the party's prestige or legitimacy.
 Although Deng has been associated in the past with,advbcacyof a      25X1
 writers and artists to observe the party's boundaries.
 We believe the fact that his warnings were ignored not only
 affronted Deng personally but exposed him to criticism from party
 conservatives.   Deng is also concerned that well-Known party
 theoreticians, such as former propaganda chief Zhou Yang and two
 senior-editors of the People's Daily, have promoted heterodox
 ideas in major speeches and articles.   Borrowing freely from
 "bourgeois" philosophers, they discussed~Marx's "humanism" and
 personal "alienation" caused by the party in a socialist
 society.   These ideas evidently were perceived as threatening by
 the party elders, because they contributed to a loss of faith in
 Deng's'speech-to the October 1983 plenum can therefore be
 seen as a continuation of his battle against "liberalism" and
 tolerance for heretical thinking in the party's propaganda
 apparatus.   He defined the problem in broad terms:   spiritual
 pollution consists not only of spreading "decadent and declining
 ideas of the bourgeoisie," but also of losing faith in socialism

 pollution campaign.

 Lack of Guidance Leads to Problems
 We do not know whether Deng intended that hi.s remarks should
 become the basis for a nationwide ideological campaign, or
 whether that decision was made by other leaders.   That the
 campaign got under way within,a week of the plenum suggests it
 was planned in advance.   That different leaders seemed to take
 the movement in different directions suggests it was not well-
 organized enough 'to prevent distortion for other objectives.   The
 campaign against spiritual pollution moved ahead rapidly in late
 October, with State Chairman Li'Xiannian, NPC Chairman Peng Zhen,
 and military leader Wang Zhen raising the issue in major?
 speeches.   Wang in particular seemed to alter the tone of the
 debate by linking spiritual pollution to an "antirightist"
 theme.   He told an audience of ideological workers in Nanjing
 that they needed to undergo a purge.
 The campaign hit its peak in early November, when a few
 writers publicly admitted the existence of the problem within
 their. ranks, Zhou Yang made a guarded self-criticism for speeches
 and articles he authored on "alienation in socialism," and Hu
 Jiwei  and Wang Ruoshui--the two "liberal" editors of Pe_o lp e's
 Daily--were sacked.   On 8 November, the spiritual pollution issue
 was added to an otherwise nondescript editorial on.rural
 concerns,  implying that it was a serious problem in the
 countryside, requiring party action.   On 12 November, the
 People's Daily printed a vitriolic commentary, entitled
 "Eliminating Spiritual Pollution Is Also a Kind of. Emancipation
 of the Mind," which implicitly attacked many reform policies and
 contained oblique criticisms of Hu Yaobang and perhaps even Deng
 himself.   The commentary also seemed to nuestinn      a's
 association with the United States.
 Some members of the party and other influential non-party
 leaders apparently viewed these developments with alarm, and began
 to make their misgivings known to the party leadership.   They
 raised fears that the campaign would degenerate into a reckless
 "anti-rightist"                         one in 1957, and would disrupt
 practical work.
 Reports from around the country also related serious
 excesses carried out in the name of eliminating spiritual
 pollution.   The China Youth League, for example, complained that
 some cadre had criticized youth for wearing colorful clothes and
 stylish.hairdos, or for reading Western classical  literature.
 Local cadre, many of them Cultural Revolution holdovers, took
 advantage of uncertain guidelines to attack any and all things
 that smacked of liberalism, including established party
 policies.   In the military, things went even further.   Soldiers
 were charged with spiritual pollution for complaining about army
 food, putting up pictures of their ai         ds,  and smoking
 filter-tipped cigarettes.

 Efforts to rein in the spiritual pollution campaign began as
 early as 16 November, with the publication in People's Daily of a
 commentator's article that took a moderate approach to the issue,
 urging caution and avoidance of the extreme methods typical of
 the Cultural Revolution era.   In its tone and page placement, the
 article resembled an authoritative editorial.   That it was only a
 commentary,  and therefore less authoritative, suggests that the
 prlvdng may not have been    full a             on   he question of
 providing guidance.for.the campaign-.                                          25X1
 The campaign sputtered on, and efforts to bring it under
 control were-piecemeal.   On 8 December, Propaganda Department
 head Deng Liqun told an audience of propaganda workers,that the
 spiritual pollution campaign was not to be ca~ried'but in the
 countryside, reversing the earlier editorial.    Subsequently,
 scientists, foreign trade workers,  and nonparty leaders were told
 that the campaign would not be permitted to interfere with their
 During this period, Hu Yaobang's views on spiritual
 pollution found their way into the media.   Hu, whose silence on
 the campaign may have been a sign of reservations about it, told
 Chinese students in Japan that the campaign should be confined
 strictly.to ideology and to literature and art.   His remarks were
 picked up by the Workers'  Daily on 12 December-but were ignored
 The party finally issued a form of authoritative guidance on
 23 December.   A speech by PLA General Political Department
 director Yu Qiuli, delivered at the end of November, was
 republished in the People's Daily with an editorial note that the
 party leadership found the speech "excellent, comprehensive,  and
 completely in,line.with the realities."   Yu attacked local
 excesses and set out strict guidelines for implementing. the
 campaign:   only those things specified by the Central Committee
 are to be criticized as spiritual pollution, and only in a
 restrained and prescribed manner.
 2Deng Liqun had made another important speech on 28
 November,  laying out "ten clear lines of demarcation" for the
 campaign.   The speech was not published. in full, however.

 The People's Daily New Year's Day editorial, usually a
 programmatic description of the work to be done in the ensuing
 year, made scant mention of spiritual pollution and insisted
 repeatedly that "economic construction" was the party's prime
 task; "under no circumstances should this task be interfered with
 or undermined."   Later in the month, US Embassy sources were told
 that the spiritual pollution campaign was essentially' over.
 A Damage Assessment                                                      25X1
 We believe that the issue of spiritual pollution is very
 important within the party-and that it will  arise again in the
 course of rectification,  as well  as in routine guidance of
 literary work.   The issue also involves the party's commitment to
 reform.   It is remarkable how quickly local officials, presumably
 opposed to reformist methods,  if not goals, made use of the
 campaign to attack even successful reform policies.   The hyper-
 sensitivity of cadre to shifts in the political  line from Beijing
 is a reminder that support for r f rm am on   leftist local
 officials is tenuous at best.                                          25X1
 It is less clear that the minimal guidance given,the
 campaign and its confused course reflect divisions within the
 central  leadership.   The evidence thus far is merely
 suggestive:
 -- Postponement of a work conference to discuss ideological
 issues from December to the spring of 1984.
 -- Reversal of the 8 November editorial;
 --.The month-long delay in publi~hinP Yu Qiuli's speech
 providing guidance to the PLA  and the relative lack of
 publicity for Deng Liqun's speech limiting the campaign.
 -- A National Peoples Congress Standing Committee meeting in
 early-December discussed the spiritual pollution issue for
 several days but was unable to issue, an official  statement
 because the issue was "complex and its solution will be
 The coincidence of the campaign with renewed criticism of Hu
 Yaobang is another factor:suggesting it has been internally
 divisive.   Hu's close association with some of the writers under
 attack, his month-long silence on the conduct of the campaign and
 the selective editing of his comments in early December all
 suggest. to us that he was a target ofthe controversy.   Moreover,

 party, as did the Bai Hua affair,  although the issue is
 strikingly similar.   Yu's?guidance suggests Deng's speech was

 he was implicitly attacked in some of the early November
 commentaries.   At the same time, Hu's leadership style was
 reportedly being criticized by several senior Politburo
 members.   We believe that Hu's reputation and leadership
 credibility were damaged by these events, though not
 irreparably.   Hu seems to have been instrumental  in efforts to
 We do not believe that the campaign issue should be read as
 a major factional breakdown or power struggle at the top.
 Nonetheless, the campaign seems to have created strains and
 exposed differences in approach between leaders apparently
 willing to tolerate some intellectual ferment--such as Hu--and
 more conservative leaders who will brook no challenge to accepted,
 dogma, particularly on the issue of the party's ideological
 mandate.   There may also be a generational element to the
 disagreements, with elders seeking ideological unity and
 "successors" stressing the need to get on with .practical economic
 work.   Despite their differences, the leadership reached a
 consensus that the campaign had been ineffective and needed to be
 restricted. The curtailment of the campaign suggests that,  in the
 press. their efforts for a,party purge and economic reform.
 In our view, the spir.itual pollution campaign exacerbated        25X1
 ideological divisions within the party.   For that reason, we do
 not believe the spiritual pollution campaign is over.  The'debate
 in fact,  has continued within the press, albeit in a more
 controlled and limited fashion.   It is clear that major
 differences of view still exist in the party over. ideological
 questions.  The planned Central Committee meeting on ideology
 this spring will provide an opportunity to raise spiritual
 pollution again, and we expect the co.ntrotversy to continue.
 We believe that the inept way in which the party has handled   25X1
 the spiritual pollution issue probably has damaged its already
 tattered reputation among China's intellectuals and disaffected
 youth.                                 the campaign caused at least some     25X1
 intellectua s to pull away from involvement in party affairs.
 Literature and art production dropped off sharply, with writers
 .fearful of publishing anythin        that mi ht later be attacked as

 Intellectual Pollution," an early reference to problems
 criticized in subsequent propaganda.

 ideology."
 12 Oct     Communique of 2nd Plenum and publication of rectification
 "Decision."  Communique mentions onlyDeng/Chen speeches on
 ideological work, notes a meeting will beheld to make-

 of bourgeois ideology" but doesn't adopt "spiritual pollution"
 rhetoric.
 15 Oct     Liberation Army Daily (LAD) editorial asks party members to
 "dare to struggle against.acts that cause spiritual
 pollution."

 at the 10th National Trade Union Conference.
 21 Oct     Peng Zhen makes speech to forum of important non-party
 personages and provides first open media discussion on
 contents of Deng's speech to 2nd plenum:  says Deng's themes
 were rectification and spiritual pollution.

 Cultural Revolution.
 Guan min  Ribao (GMRB), party newspaper aimed at
 Intel ectua s, Commentator, "Elimination of Spiritual

 hard-line piece, makes an imprecise connection between crimes
 of the young and spiritual pollutants.
 16 Nov     PD front page commentator, entitled "Build Spiritual
 Civilization, Oppose Spiritual Pollution," looks just like the
 long awaited.editorial--but isn't.  Takes a relatively

 demarcation in eliminating spiritual pollution.  Speech is
 mentioned in press, but full text is not published.

 2 Dec       3rd Session of the 6th NPC Standing Committee publishes
 comments from 5 plenary meetings (from 29 Nov to 2 Dec) at
 which spiritual pollution is discussed.  Secretariat member
 .Chen Pixian notes some are shocked by drive to eliminate
 spiritual pollution, and asks "what's wrong with a little
 shock?"
 A front page "short commentary" in PD, "Eliminate Spiritual
 Pollution, Draw Clear Distinctions," hits the now familiar
 themes--make careful demarcation, don't disrupt the economy.
 8 Dec     Xinhua radio alerts listeners to pay attention for important
 commentary:  "'Eliminate Spiritual Pollution' Should Not Be
 Mentioned in the Countryside."  Hence the only PD editorial of
 the drive is reversed.  Report goes on to cite excesses of
 cadre who felt licensed by the editorial of one month earlier.
 NPC Standing Committee meeting ends, declines to issue a
 decision on eliminating spiritual pollution despite spending 7
 days on it.  Peng Zhen says, "It is all right not to make a
 decision for the time being."
 9 Dec     Deng Liqun again, at a forum on 'ideological and political work
 in enterprises:  "We should firmly focus on economic
 construction and must not waver on this question."  Explains
 that the Central Committee decided the drive against spiritual
 pollution was inappropriate in rural areas.
 9 Dec     A front page PD Commentator--"Encourage the Peasants to Go All
 Out to Become Well-Off Through Hard Work"--backs up Central
 Committee decision to stop the spiritual pollution campaign in
 the countryside, once again discusses the erroneous criticisms
 leveled at wealthy peasants.
 12 Dec    Gongren Ribao (Workers' Daily) quotes Hu Yaobang in a front.
 page commentator:  "Spiritual Pollution chiefly refers.to the
 remarks and works of a very small number of people in
 theoretical circles and in the fields of literature and art
 that are harmful to the building of the four modernizations
 and to the stability and unity of the country."
 13 Dec    GMRB summarizes the Gongren Ribao commentator and edits out
 Hu's remarks.
 23 Dec    Xinhua broadcasts excerpts from Yu Qiuli's 30 November speech,
 which bears the imprimatur of the Central Committee:
 "excellent, comprehensive, and completely in line with the
 realities in various localities and departments."
 GMRB publishes Deng Liqun speech of 4 June 83, "Propaganda
 Workers Must Maintain a Clear Head."  Obviously revised,

 26. Dec    Mao's birthday commemorated with a full turnout of the
 leadership at the Mao Mausoleum, a PD editorial, and on the
 25th, a long remembrance by Hu Yaobang.
 Cultural figure Lin Mohan, writing in Honggi (pp. 33-35),
 notes that "to eliminate spiritual pollution requires
 destruction."  Notes that some writers have stopped writing to
 protest the drive against spiritual pollution.
 28 Dec     In GMRB front pager, commentator Shi Youxin calls combating
 spiritual pollution "a vital content of party
 rectification."  Shi denies that the struggle is winding down,
 says it is long-term, necessary project.
 31 Dec     The PD'New Year's editorial subordinates spiritual pollution--
 and everything else on the agenda, rectification included--to
 economic construction.' Spiritual pollution is given hardly
 any space..
 9 Jan      Zhang Xiaotian, author of "Boundless Grass Over the Plain,"
 offers a cowering self-criticism in PD (p. 7).
 10 Jan     Banyuetan Commentator, "Prospects for 1984," almost skips
 mention of spiritual pollution.  Drive is indeed winding down,
 despite Shi Youxin's protestations.
