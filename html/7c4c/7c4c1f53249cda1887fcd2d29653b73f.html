 THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDONESIA
 PROBLEM
 To analyze the structure of the Communist Party of
 Indonesia (Partai Komunis Indonesia - PKI), its components
 and its affiliated organizations, and to depict briefly the
 PKI's position in Indonesian affairs and its relations with
 other Communist parties.
 SCOPE AND LIMITATIONS
 Although much of the information on the PKI is available
 in open source materials, intelligence gaps remain on low
 echelon units of the PKI, front organizations of the PKI and
 relations of the PKI with other Communist parties.   Available
 covert source materials only partially fill these gaps.
 No attempt has been made to assess the PKI's position in
 the international Communist movement,  nor to compare its
 development and doctrines with those of parties in other
 countries.

 THE COMMUNIST PARTY Of INDONESIA (PKI)
 S UMMA R-Y
 The Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), the only Communist
 party in Southeast Asia actively supporting a non-Communist
 government, has grown rapidly in recent years and is now working
 to increase its parliamentary position in the republic's first
 national elections, to be held in September 1955.  While not
 threatening the present Indonesia (Yovernment, the PKI is a strong
 nucleus in the Communist attempt to capture control of Southeast
 Asia.
 The government of Premier.  All Sastroamidioio is non-Communist,
 but it is leftist and at present willingly accepts the support of
 the Communists.  Without support from the PKI's 17 votes the
 government coalition would barely control Parliament.   Estimates
 are that the PKI may increase its present 7.2 per cent of the
 Parliament seats to 20-3555 per cent in the September elections.
 However, the Masjumi (Indonesian Moslem Council) is expected to
 increase its 18.3 per cent to 40-60 per cent, while the PNI
 (Indonesian Nationalist Party), present leader of the government
 coalition may take only 15-25 per cent.   The PNI holds 18.3 per
 cent of the seats in the present provisional Parliament.
 The PKI dates its history from 1920.   It has had periods of
 successes and depression, including two unsuccessful attempts at
 rebellion, in 1926 and 1.948.   Tt is now on the upswing.   In the
 past two years membership claims  (considered substantially correct)
 have risen from 126,000 to about 500,000. In addition,more than
 1,000,000 members belong to PKI-affiliated front organizations,
 the largest of which is SOBST, the principal labor federation in
 Indonesia.   In preparation for the parliamentary elections, the
 PKI is endeavoring to persuade all front organization members to
 join the party.
 The party program follows the traditional Communist lines,
 emphasizing the elimination of colonialism, imperialism and
 feudalism, while advocating the formation of a "people's
 democracy" and eventually a socialist state.   The usual pronounce-
 ments against foreign capital, for nationalization of certain
 enterprises and for land reform also are frequent.
 The PKI has undergone several  changes recently, both in
 structure and in leadership.   The party organization below the
 national level has been revised to parallel the subnational
 organization of the Indonesian Republic, in preparation for the
 national elections.   A long leadership struggle has been resolved
 and the party is firmly in the hands of D. N. Aidit and his
 followers.  Aidit is believed to be favored by Moscow above
 Alimin, his predecessor and a disciple of Mao, although little
 is known of PKI relations with other Communist parties.

 THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDONESIA
 I.   HISTORY OF THE PARTY  1/
 Two Communist parties are active in Indonesia, the
 4ationalist Proletarian Party (Partai Murba) and the Communist
 Party of Indonesia (Partai Komunis Indonesia - PKI).   The
 PKI is far stronger and more important than the Proletarian
 Party, which split from the original movement in its early
 years.   The PKI was organized in 1920, although Communism in
 Indonesia antedates the PKI by six years.
 The Pre-Independence Period, 1914-45
 1.   Formation of the Party
 The Communist Party of Indonesia, which carried several
 other names before becoming the Partai Komunis Indonesia, is
 one of the oldest Communist parties in the world.   Its roots
 go back to 1914, when H. J. F. M. Sneevliet, a Dutch engineer,
 founded the Social Democratic Association of the Indies
 (Indische Sociaal-Democratische Vereniging - ISDV), a Communist-
 controlled organization.   Sneevliet had broken away from the
 Dutch Democratic Labor Party (SDAP) with the radical "Tribunist"
 group in 1909.   This group was to become the Communist Party of
 the Netherlands.
 In its early days the ISDV was almost entirely Dutch.   It
 was composed of orthodox Socialists, Marxists and revisionists.
 Since the primary purpose of the movement was to gain a foothold
 in Indonesia and win Indonesian support, doctrinary differences
 were overlooked by the early members of the ISDV.
 As was the Viet Minh movement in Indochina, Communism in
 Indonesia was implanted on the basis of nationalism.   The
 Communists had three major talking points:   (1)  Indonesia was
 still a colony with little or no self-government;  (2) big busi-
 ness in the islands was in the hands of European traders; and (3)
 the middle class of Indonesia was composed primarily of Chinese
 merchants,   The Indonesians, at the bottom of the economic totem
 pole, proved willing supporters of a movement which appeared to
 be aimed at building their economic position and bolstering their
 national ego.   The ISDV formed a mass organization called the
 Sarekat Islam (Islamic Union) to broaden the nationalist base of
 the Communist movement.   By 1919 the Union had a membership of
 2,500,000.   One early Indonesian leader, Mangunkusumo, said of
 the Communist movement at that time::
 Communist as well as nationalist feels that the
 present direction of the state. whereby matters

 of state are decided and acted on beyond, over,
 and yet without us, must be changed.  We are
 oriented towards revolution.  And it is on this
 platform that nationalist and communist find one
 another.  We can perhaps differ in the choice of
 means by which to win the sovereignty of the
 people, but we do not yet quarrel with each other
 on that account; we can stand sympathetically in
 regard to one another.
 In 1918 Sneevliet attempted to establish Russian-style
 soviets in the Army and Navy and among merchant seamen.   This
 action resulted in his expulsion from the country in late 1918.
 He settled in China, where in 1920 he was put In charge of the
 Communist International's Far Eastern Bureau, established upon
 his proposal at the Second Comintern Congress.  At that congress
 Sneevliet represented the Indonesian Communist movement, which
 in May 1920 had changed its name from the ISDV to Perserikatan
 Komunis d:L Indonesia (Indonesia Communist Union).  Although the
 name is s:Lightly different, the PKI dates its history from this
 group.  While Sneevliet was in China, Semaun became the leading
 spokesman for the movement within Indonesia.
 Communist influence was centered largely In the growing
 trade union movement, which had its headquarters in Semarang.   In
 1923 the more conservative religious-nationalist elements of the
 Sarekat Islam, fearing Communist domination of the movement,
 brought about a split in the organization.   The Sarekat Islam
 was too weak to carry the nationalist movement on its own and
 shortly thereafter disbanded.   This left the Perserikatan
 Komunis di Indonesia as the remaining nationalist movement in
 the country.   It was still very weak in 1923, when the last
 remaining Dutch elements left the party.   The Communist party
 of the Netherlands was having its own difficulties at the time
 and was unable to give any support to the weak colonial party.
 The next few years saw the almost complete disintegration of
 the Indonesian Communist movement.   In 1925 the premature out-
 break of a general strike in East Java failed and led to strong
 repressive measures by the colonial government.   Communist
 leaders were given the choice of going to prison or leaving the
 country; most of them choosing to leave.
 a.   Party Split
 The strike followed a period of shifting Communist policy
 on the resective roles of the peasant and proletariat classes
 in the pec leis revolution.   Indonesian Communists had shifted
 to a policy of proletarian revolution in 1924, only to receive
 instructions from the Comintern to again include the peasants in
 their plans.
 Additional friction arose over the role of "bourgeois
 nationalist movements."  Tan Malaka, the Comintern representa-
 tive for Southeast Asia, favored their use while other
 Indonesian Communist leaders opposed them.   This dispute led
 to an eventual split in the party (1928) that has never been

 healed and is currently manifested  .n the existence of two
 Communist parties--the late Tan Malaka's Partai Mu.rba
 (Proletarian Party) and the orthodox Marxist party, the PKI,
 b.  Abortive Revolution, November 1926
 In November 1926 the Communists launched an abortive
 revolution.   The major outbreak was in Bantam (now Banten)
 Residency at the western end of Java.  Additional outbreaks
 occurred in Priangan Residency in southwestern Java, but these
 were quickly squashed.   The Bantam outbreaks lasted for several
 weeks, before order was restored.   In January 1927 there were
 additional incidents in the Minangkabau region of Sumatra's west
 coast.  Like the Bantam affair they were quieted only after
 several weeks and with military support to local police units.
 Many Communists believed the revolution had no hope of
 success,  However, Semaun stated, "We believe that it would be
 better to die fighting than to die without fighting."  /  Waves
 of arrests followed the abortive revolts; the PKI was outlawed
 and its effectiveness virtually destroyed.   It was not a reality
 in the nationalist movement for the remainder of the colonial
 period.   At the Sixth Comintern Congress in 1928 exiled PKI
 leaders were instructed to take all measures to bring about the
 party's return to legal status.   This was an impossible task in
 the face of Dutch opposition and strength.
 It was at this congress that the break between Tan Malaka
 and the PKI became complete.   Tan MaLaka was labeled a Trotskyite
 and blamed for the failure of the 1926-27 revolution.
 3.   PKI Activity in Exile
 In the late 1920's and earl~y 19;J0's the chief' base of
 Indonesian Communism was in the Netherlands.   Two major Indonesian
 groups were active there:   some of the exiled Communist leaders
 and a group of students banded together in a movement of
 Marxists and nationalists called the Indonesian Association
 (Perhimpunan Indonesia - Pli),   Bolstered by statements of the
 Dutch Communist Party advocating Indonesian independence, the
 PKI and the PI joined forces in an accord in December 1926
 signed by Semaun of the PKI and Hatta (now Indonesian vice-
 president) of the PI,   This accord recognized the leadership of
 the PI in the movement for independence.
 In the following years the Ell maintained direct contact with
 the Comintern through Semaun and indirect contact through the
 League Against Imperialism.   The League was founded as an inter-
 national organization in 1926 by Willy Munzenberg of the German
 Communist Party, and Hatta became a member of its executive
 organization.   PI affiliation with the League lasted until 1929,
 when a split between the League and the Comintern became
 permanent.
 The Indonesian Communists received a strong impetus when
 the Dutch Communists succeeded in electing an Indonesian Communist
 living in the Netherlands, Rustam Effendi,  to the Dutch Parliament
 in 1933.

 The tide turned however, in 1935, with tie Comintern
 announcement of the Popular Front doctrine.   The Dutch Communist
 Party interpreted this to mean that they should no longer demand
 immediate independence for Indonesia.   They thus denied
 Indonesian nationalists and Communists their chief source of
 support.  A reversal of this policy with the implementation of
 the Nazi-Soviet pact in 1939 increased Indonesian disillusion-
 ment with what they saw as an opportunistic approach to
 Indonesian independence by the Comintern.
 4.         Underground PKI and World War II
 In 1935 Musso, an Indonesian member of the Comintern's
 Executive Committee, was sent back to Indonesia, where he organ-
 ized an underground PKI movement under the leadership of Pamudju,
 Djokosudjono and Achmadsumadi, the last two now members of the
 PKI Central Committee.  Musso stayed in Indonesia less than a
 year and returned to Europe; the underground movement remained
 quiet while building strength.   Probably in accordance with the
 Popular Front policy, some of the members of the illegal PKI
 joined a "bourgeois nationalist movement" in the anti-Fascist front
 Gerindo (Gerakan Indonesia, Indonesian Movement), a left-wing
 nationalist movement of the 1930's.   PKI influence in this group
 was noticeable.
 With the Japanese invasion of Indonesia in 1941 most
 nationalists saw the possibility of converting resistance to
 the Japanese into an independence movement.   Under the Japanese
 occupation many of the PKI members joined underground movements,
 notably one led by Amir Sjarifuddin, and the Communists did make
 inroads into the youth movement during the war.   In general, the
 Communists cooperated with the Dutch but remained weak during
 World War II,
 B.    Postwar Period to Madiun Affair, 1945-46
 1.  The Postwar PKI
 Adherence to the "popular front doctrine" in the later war
 years and the first months of the postwar period proved to be a
 major tactical error for the PKI.   Obeying that doctrine, most of
 the PKI leaders had joined other nationalist parties.  The only
 well organized party in August 1945.zwhen Indonesia proclaimed it-
 self an independent republic, was under the command of Subardjo,
 a follower of Tan Malaka.  By 21 October 1945, when the PKI was
 re-formed, the "bourgeois nationalist parties" were already well
 in control of the country.   It has been speculated that had
 there been an organized PKI during the war, Indonesia might have
 followed the path of Vietnam.
 The new PKI of 1945 was not led by members of the wartime
 underground, but by Mohammed Jussuf, head of the wartime
 Djojobojo Party.  His inefficient leadership and his non-associa-
 tion with the underground weakened the movement and led many to
 join other parties.

 The party suffered a blow when, on the heels of Dutch
 announcements that Hatta and Sukarno, Indonesian nationalists
 who helped in formation of and led the new republic, were
 Japanese collaborators, the Russian, Dutch and exiled Indonesian
 leaders denounced the new republic as a fascist state.   This
 feeling persisted for several months.   Australian Communists were
 the first to favor the new republic; by the end of the year the
 exiled leaders also took a stand in favor of the revolutionaries.
 Because of wartime cooperation between these leaders and the
 Dutch Government, the government flew them back to Indonesia with-
 out cost.   To the chagrin of The Hague, however, they ceased
 cooperating with the Netherlands as soon as they returned to
 Indonesia.
 About this time the Soviet Union changed its attitude
 towards the new republic and supported it in the United Nations.
 This action probably was taken as a part of the effort to offset
 western influence in Asia.
 2.   Common Front Against the Duch
 By the spring of 1946 many of the exiled PKI leaders had
 returned to Indonesia.  Disagreeing with Jussuf, who they felt
 was deviating from the PKI line,  the;;  denounced him at a meeting
 in March and purged him from the party.   In late April a party
 conference set up a new executive committee under Sardjono, who
 had just arrived from Australia.    The party issued a manifesto
 supporting the Indonesian Republic and opposing the Dutch, which
 ended with the following statement:   "As the first step in
 achieving this goal   he formation of a socialist society9 the
 PKI joins in the defense of the Republic of Indonesia, while at
 the same time it wishes to strengthen the Republic through the
 propagation of a national front to resist fascist-reactionary
 colonial attempts."   /  This stand against colonialism indicated
 the complete shift to an anti-Dutch position from the PKI's war-
 time collaboration with the Netherlands.
 Shortly after this action the PKI joined with then Defense
 Minister Amir Sjarifuddin in a common front against the Dutch,
 omitting the nationalist Communist organization of Tan Malaka.
 Sardjono, a leftist leader, became the head of the new coalition.
 On 12 October 1946 Alimin, a former PKI leader who fled in
 1926 to avoid arrest, returned to Indonesia and assumed joint
 leadership of the party with Sardjono.   Alimin had spent 10 years
 of his exile in China with Mao Tse-tung and was the only PKI
 leader to have had extensive contact with Chinese Communists.
 In November 1946 the Indonesian Government consented to the
 Linggadjati Agreement with the Dutch, temporarily ending
 hostilities.   At the time, the agreement was strongly opposed by
 the rightists elements and leftist-nationalists who were joined
 in the formation of the Benteng Republik (Republican Fortress).
 The PKI, however, supported the government on the basis that it
 would give the republic a "breathing space" during which to
 consolidate itself.   This decision apparently was made with the
 approval of Moscow,

 3.    The Sajap Kiri
 With the Partai Sosialis (Socialist Party) and the Partai
 Buruh Indonesia (Labor Party of Indonesia) tae PKI formed the
 Sajap Kiri (Left-wing), an alliance supporting republican govern-
 ment.   Part of the Socialist Party and Labor Party since have
 merged with the PKI,   President Sukarno, to assure passage of the
 Linggadjati Agreement in Parliament and to make the composition
 of that provisional parliament (the KNIP) more nearly
 representative, increased KNIP membership to give the Sajap Kiri
 and the Benteng Republik each 105 seats.   Previously the Sajap
 Kiri held 43 seats to 80 for the Benteng Republik bloc.   The
 representation of the PKI itself was raised from 1 seat to 35
 seats.   The Working Committee of the KNIP, which assumed most of
 the powers of the larger body, was reorganized to give a strong
 ma jorit;fir to the Sajap Kiri.
 In the following period the PKI concent:^ated on building its
 parliamentary strength and made no effort to secure power in the
 executive branch of the government.   Outside the government the
 party centered its strength in the Central O:^ganization of Trade
 Unions :"or All Indonesia (Sentral Organisasi Buruh Seluruh
 Indonesia - SOBSI), the largest labor federation in the country.
 Throughout this period the PKI maintained a policy of supporting
 the government.  At the January 1947 party conference it kept
 the nationalist line and called for cooperation of "all anti-
 coloniaL and anti-semicolonial foreign groups and states."  1
 Also ca:Lled for were democratic freedoms, land for poor and
 middle income peasants, collective bargaining and anti-trust laws.
 The main drawback to PKI policy was its compete support of the
 government, even on unpopular measures, which left it extremely
 vulnerable when changes occurred in the administration.
 Although offered cabinet positions on several occasions, the
 PKI refused, giving as its reason:
 As followers of Marxism-Leninism..,we are conscious
 of the fact that Indonesia is constantly threatened by
 the cannons of the great capitalist states (England and
 America).   On the one side America in principle does not
 approve of Netherlands colonial rule, as that would be
 detrimental to America; but on the other hand America
 would also not be in accord with a 100% independent
 Indonesian republic, if in it there were a tendency which
 would be considered by America as a "cell of Moscow."  It
 is thus clear that participation by the PKI in the cabinet
 would not be tactful and would have as its consequence
 that our republic would be weakened.  We shall support
 the government but not run behind it.   It is now the duty
 of the PKI to exercise control on the political leader-
 ship of the government.  1
 The, major break in Sajap Kiri ranks came in June 1947 during
 the third Sjahrir government, when Sajap Kiri shifted to attack of
 that government's policy. That month Sjahrir- made several
 important concessions to the Dutch to stave off an offensive
 planned by the Dutch, who accused Indonesia cf violating the truce
 agreements.   These concessions were attacked by the Sajap Kiri
 and the Sjahrir Government fell.  Efforts to persuade Sjahrir
 to reorganize a new cabinet failed and Sjarifuddin became the new
 premier, heading a cabinet-further to the left than any of the
 other Sajap Kiri governments.

 4.    The People's Democratic Front
 During this period Zhdanov of the Communist Party of the
 Soviet Union announced the two-camps doctrine and declared
 Indonesia part of the democratic camp.  Acceptance of this two-camps
 doctrine placed the Communists in a difficult situation when the
 SJarifuddin government fell on 31 January 1948, because the PKI's
 position was definitely committed.   The reason most often given
 for the fall of this government was its support for acceptance of
 the Renville Agreement with the Dutch.  It is believed, however,
 that many groups feared SJarifuddin's growing power and brought
 about the collapse of the government, a belief supported by the
 acceptance of the agreement by the succeeding rightist government
 of Premier Hatta.
 When Sukarno appointed Hatta he made the new cabinet
 directly responsible to himself, rendering leftist strength in
 the parliament useless.  Demands of the Sajap Kiri for a role in
 the new government were refused and they joined the opposition.
 At this the less radical SJahrir faction split from the Socialist
 Party and formed the Indonesian Socialist Party (Partai Sosialis
 Indonisa - PSI).   The PSI took with it many of the Socialist
 members of the parliament; and its Working Committee.
 These efforts brought a need for a revision of the leftists'
 position.   In February 1948 the parties of the Sajap Kiri re-
 organized into the Peoples Democratic Front (Front Demokrasi
 Rakjat - FDR).   The program of the new group called for a repudia-
 tion of the Renville and Linggadjati agreements, the cessation of
 all negotiations with the Dutch as long as their forces were
 present in Indonesia and the nationalization without compensation
 of foreign-owned properties.   Although this program was aimed
 primarily at the "imperialist enemies," it was also in opposition
 to the program of the Hatta government, further deepening the
 breach between the left and the right.
 During the next few months two major events took place to
 further strain relations.   On 22 May the Hatta government rejected
 a Soviet offer to exchange ambassadors.   The PKI interpreted this
 to mean that Hatta was a servant of the Americans.   On the heels
 of this the FDR adopted a "National Program" designed to fit the
 aims of all Indonesian political parties and called for a "national
 government" to put it into effect.   They asked for representation
 in such a government.  When Hatta accepted the program on 27 July
 the cabinet decided that it was unnecessary to make any re-
 arrangement of cabinet posts and the PKI was not offered any
 position.
 5>    MussoTs "New Road for Indonesia"
 August 1948 marked the return to Indonesia of Musso, founder
 of the illegal PKI, who had spent more than a decade in Russia.
 With him he brought instructions and criticisms from Moscow.
 Assuming leadership of the PKI, he announced a new policy, known
 as the Musso Corrections or as the DJalan Baru untuk Indonesia
 (The New Road for Indonesia).  8/  T  s program Is still    e guide
 for t!ie`PKI   Among the po nts in the Musso's program were:
 (1)  Endorsement of the Zhdanov doctrine.
 (2)  Ban on negotiations with the Dutch as long as Dutch
 troops remained in Indonesia.

 (3)    Close cooperation with the Dutch Communist Party.
 (4)        Promotion of the Indonesian revolution as a bourgeois-
 democratic revolution rather than a socialist
 revolution.
 (5)        Preservation of controlled capital until such time as
 a socialist state could be formed.
 (6)        "Land for those who work it"fithe pocr peasants to be
 given land, the middle Mass peasants to retain theirs
 and the land of the rich to be confiscated, with the
 provision that they may keep some if' they supported
 the revolution.
 (7)        Support for the revolution from the peasants, workers
 and petty bourgoisie, with the leadership in the hands
 of the proletariat.
 (8)        Attainment of democratic rights for the workers and a
 voice in the control of production.
 (9)        Democratization of the army, removing the corrupt
 elements and replacing them with members of the working
 class.
 Musso, under his so-called "Gottwald Plan," called for peace-
 ful establishment of a national government under the National
 Program, rather than overthrow of the government.   Seeking a
 "united :Front from above" he criticized the FDR for sponsoring
 anti-government strikes and urged national unity against the Dutch.
 Musso and the other left-wing parties invited the right-wing
 parties to negotiate for a united front.  Fearing growing left-
 wing strength, the right refused, and demobilization of military
 units suspected of Communist sympathies was begun.   This move led
 indirectly to the Madiun Affair, also referred to as an incident,
 rebellion, uprising or provocation, depending on the writer and
 his political inclination.
 6.    Madiun Affair, September 1948
 In September 1948 leftist unit commanders around Madiun and
 Solo refused to accept the demobilization order and raised the
 red flag in rebellion.  At the time most of the PKI leaders,
 including Musso, were away on a speaking tour and may not have
 been aware of the events taking place--many not until they were
 arrested.  Faced with a fait accompli the leaders could do
 nothing but give full support to the "uprising, although it is
 generally believed they had no prior knowledge of it.   Few units
 outside the immediate area joined the rebellion, and many
 completely disassociated themselves from it.  During the course
 of the affair, which lasted a few months, several key PKI
 leaders were killed, including Musso, Sjarift.ddin and Setiadiit.
 The party suffered in the eyes of the people and for a short time
 sank into oblivion.
 Marty versions of this affair have been given.   The party's
 official. explanation, which appeared in the pro-Communist Sin Po,
 a Chines-owned Indonesian language daily, on 10 February 'I`ll,
 almost two and a half years later, is particulary interesting:

 The Madiun action was a culmination of the
 provocative program of the imperialist group carried
 out through the medium of the Sukarno-Hatta government.
 This provocation was aimed at overthrowing an anti-
 imperialist national revolution, particularly for the
 destruction of its armed strength.   This aim was success-
 ful when a general assault was made on the people and
 anti-imperialist troops.   This action was beneficial to
 the imperialist group as manifested by the fact that
 immediately after the outbreak of the Madiun armed
 clash the Dutch Government offered armed aid to the
 Sukarno-Hatta Government following a negotiation made
 by the Dutch Government with America.
 The accusation that the coup in Madiun was aimed
 at establishing another Soviet regime in Madiun was not
 true, because the Mad .un affair was only:
 (a)  an incident between two official armed
 forces which was followed by a temporary appointment of
 a regional head of government in Madiun on September 18,
 1948, who also recognized the Central Government of
 Jogjakarta.   This appointment of a head of government
 was approved by military and civil authorities in Madiun.
 (b)  an armed resistance by the people and the
 army, because they were anti-imperialist, took place
 after President Sukarno made a speech on the night of
 September 19, 1948,  calling for a general assault,
 seizures and arbitrary murders.
 (c)  this resistance was brought to perfection by
 rallying the people's energy and by the establishment
 of a "Pemerintah Front Nasional" (National Front
 Government) in Madiu.n which was followed by other
 territories in East; and Central Java.
 It is clear that all accusations to brand the PKI
 as a rebel were contrary to fact and groundless.  At that
 time the PKI, under the immediate leadership of Musso
 as Secretary General of the Central Committee of the PKI
 was engaged in the implementation of their August 1948
 resolution to find a new road for the Republic of
 Indonesia-
 (a)                                   a fifth PKI congress was to be held early in
 October 1948;
 (b)   the PKI congress on September 19, 1948, in
 Kediri and following it a congress of the Socialist
 Party were in process;
 (c)   Musso and Amir Sjarifuddin, who were in
 Purwodadi on September 18, 1948, intended to continue
 their trip to Kedu and Banjurras;
 (d)   it was planned to establish a "Front Persatuan
 Nasional"   (Unified National Front   of all branches of
 the FDR (Peoples Democratic Front .

 Besides the above, considering that:
 (a)  the central Committee and the Eeadquarters
 of the PKI were seated in Jogjakarta  and. that until
 its last meeting on September 17, 1948, the PKI had
 never planned or decided to carry out a rebellion;
 (b)  the committee of the PKI section in
 Jogjakarta held a meeting on September 18, 1948;
 (c)  a Railway Laborers Conference was held
 on September 18, 1948, in Jogjakarta whose leader-
 ship was largely made up of members of the FDR.
 (d)  the existence of FDR representatives in
 the Working Committee of the KNIP who continued
 their duties in Jogjakarta until September 19, 1948.
 The above are clear evidences that it was entirely
 impossible for the PKI or Musso and others to have
 drawn up a plan and decided to excite an incident in
 Madiun.
 Opportunist Fault
 The success of the provocative program of the
 Sukarno-Hatta Government led to;
 (a)  the dispersion of the anti-impe:rialist
 national union which was backed by the PKI based on
 a national program which had been approved by all
 people's parties and organizations;
 '(b)  the collapse of the strength of the
 above anti-imperialist national revolution owing to
 the murder of 36,000 men who formed the backbone in
 our revolution.  This occurrence permitted the Dutch
 invasion for their second colonial war and the surrender
 of the Sukarno-Hatta Government to the Dutch.
 The provocative program of the Sukarno-Hatta
 Government and opportunistic weaknesses of the PKI in
 the party organization and in the political field at
 this time brought the party to the lowest point of its
 strength.  This was corrected and improved accord-
 ing to the August 1948 revolution.  Because of this
 party weakness the PKI was not able to surmount the
 provocation of Sukarno-Hatta Government.
 In September 1954 the PKI issued a pamphlet, Buku Putih
 Tentang Peristiwa Madiun (White Book on the Mad.iun Incident),
 w ich largely repeated the statements made in 1.951, placing the
 blame on the Hatta government.  The one significant difference
 is that Sukarno, who in recent years has been more favorably dis-
 posed towards the PKI, is not mentioned with Hatta as the villain
 of the plot.   10/

 C.     The Post-Madiun Period 1949--1953
 1.   Party Difficulties
 The year after the Madiun Affair, 1949, was a black year for
 the PKI.   Party unity was disrupted and most of the country
 labeled the party a betrayer of the Indonesian revolution against
 Dutch imperialism.   The year was marked, however, by one event
 which was later to be an important factor in the growth of the
 party--the victory of Mao Tse-tung in China
 In August 1950, Wang Yen-shu, an Indonesian-born Chinese,
 returned to Djakarta as the first ambassador of the Chinese
 Peoples Republic (CPR).   He launched a program of violent attacks
 on the US and made pro-Communist speeches, many aimed at
 Indonesia's 2,000,000 Chinese residents.   The severity of his
 program antagonized the government, which in turn staged a routd-
 up of leading Communists in August 1951, using violations of a
 government no-strike order as grounds for arrests.  Many of the
 leaders escaped to Red China, where they were given asylum.   In-
 cluded in this group were such leaders as Alimin, Aidit and
 r,ukman.   The situation became calmer the following year;  rela-
 tions between the CPR and Indonesia were improved and Ambassador
 Wang was recalled.
 Alimin returned to Indonesia and reassumed the party leader-
 ship he had lost to Musso in 1948.   He was a strong believer to
 Maoist tactics and philosophy,  launching a program not favored by
 many of the younger leaders of the party such as Aidit.   The
 younger leaders rebuked Alimin for his policy in 1951, marking
 the start of his descent, which was to end in October 1953 with
 removal from the chairmanship of the party and the Politburo,
 and,iin March 1954, from the Central Committee as well.
 2.   National Program
 During these years,  1950 and 1951,  the party staged a mild
 comeback.  Besides increasing membership it consolidated its
 control over SOBSI and in peasant and youth groups.   In March
 1951 the party, in an attempt to establish a united front,  iss,ied
 a 12-point "National Program" which called for:
 1.   Repeal of the Round Table Agreement between the
 Netherlands and Indonesia;
 2.   Institution of a broad democracy;
 3.   Setting in motion of an independent foreign policy;
 4.   Prohibition of the use of the atom bomb,  condemnation
 of American aggression, and effectuation of a
 policy of peace;
 5.   Removal of foreign military forces from the country,,
 and making effective the people's defense;
 6.   Nationalization of important industries and help
 to national enterprises;
 7.   Land for those who work it;

 Cooperation with the PNI
 In this period the Indonesian Nationalist Party (Partai
 Nasional Indonesia - PNI) came under the control of its younger,
 more radical faction, setting the stage for a cooperation between
 the PNI and the PKI that still exists under the Indonesian
 administration of Premier Ali Sastroamidjojo,  The PNI had strong
 support among government officials but was weak in mass organiza-
 tion and discipline, two areas in which the PKI was strong.  They
 thus complemented each other.  Their alliance was the beginning
 of the kind of united front desired by the PKI.
 By 1952 the party was far along the road to regaining its
 lost strength, and even toward surpassing it.   Party membership
 increased from less than 10,000 to more than 125,000 in a period
 of six months.  Membership in front organizations also increased.
 Even more important, however, is the political strength gained
 by the party through its support of the Sastroamidjojo govern-
 ment, a PNI-led coalition.  While not holding any cabinet posts,
 (though some cabinet members are communist sympathizers), the PKI
 is an important cog in the parliamentary machinery of Indonesia.
 Without the 17 PKI votes (out of 231), the government coalition
 is barely in control of the parliament.   The defection of a
 single splinter component to the opposition could swing the balance
 were it not for PKI delegation, fourth largest in Parliament,
 There is still some question about the extent of control the
 party exercises over the government, but a close correlation
 between the government position and the PKI position on many
 matters is discernible.
 In October 1953 several changes took place in the party,
 notably the end of nominal leadership of the party by Alimin, the
 leading believer in Maoist doctrine.
 D.    October 1953 to the Present
 1.   Central Committee Meeting, October 1953
 A plenary session of the PKI Central Committee (CCPKI) was
 held in Djakarta, 6-8 October 1953.   The chief purposes of the
 meeting were to write the "Draft Program" of the party for
 consideration by the entire membership at the party congress in
 March 1954 and to make additional arrangements for that conference.
 This meeting of the CCPKI became one of the milestones in PKI
 history.
 Five major events took place:  (1) election of a new Central
 Committee; (2) criticism of and action against Central Committee
 member Tan Ling Djie;  (3) reading of the General Report of the
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 CCPKI; (4) pronouncei.,iert of the "Draft Program"; and, (5) comple-
 tion of arrangements for the Fifth Party Congress in March 1954.
 a.    Membership Changes
 Six men were dropped from the Central Committee:   Supardan,
 Tan Ling DJie, Tjugito, Djaetun, Utarjo and Mud:Lgdo,   The first
 two also had been on the Politburo; Sudisman replaced them.
 Alimin was dropped from the Politburo, being replaced by Njoto,
 but was retained i>i the Central Committee.  With these changes
 the Politburo was composed of the five present incumbents:   Aidit,
 Lukman, Njoto, Saki.rman and. Sudisman e   The ney_ members of the
 Central Committee were. -Pardede, Adjitorop, Djokosudjono, Zailani,
 Wikana and Ba.chtarudd.L r},  Wikana and Alimin were later dropped
 at the party congre.a and were replaced by Nursuhud and Supit.
 In addition,to removal from the Central Committee, Tan Ling
 Djie was censured, in a resolution approved at the party congress,
 for actions described as "subjectivism, dogmatism and empiricism,
 causing the Party to make mistakes on the right and left, with
 results similar to Trotskyism"  11   Dogmatism and empiricism
 were described as being two kinds of subjectivism.  The report
 stated:
 Dogmatism and empiricism are two opposite extremes.
 Both trends are equally one-sided.   The dogmatist puts
 everything on the basis of book-learning and several
 theoretical axioms.   They fail to see the living, develop-
 ing, and altering process.  They render the theories
 inert by denying them any connection with practice and with
 the masses.
 On the other hand, the empiricist toils like
 crazy without any knowledge as to what exactly has
 necessitated the work he does.  He fails to know which
 way is best in which to attain ends.  He puts practice
 in a shadow of darkness as he proceeds unguided by
 any theories.  He discards theories as trivialities,   12
 The report does not explain, however, how one can be both a
 dogmatist and an empiricist at the same time-depending only on
 theories yet discarding theory.
 b,    General Report and Draft Program
 The General Report of the Central Committee was announced as
 a report of the political situation and an explanation of' the
 subjects mentioned  Ai the "Draft Program,"  It was basically a
 rehashing of party hJ_story and the events of the day,
 More important was the pronouncement of the "Draft Program,"
 The program called fog a united national front based on an
 alliance of labor and the farmers led by the working classes.
 The 3o-point program, divided into 5 categories, is still the
 basic program of the PKI.   A new "Peoples Democratic Government"
 was asked to carry out. this program:   1
 TO OBTAIN NATIONAL FREEDOM
 1.    Release Indonesia from the Dutch-Indonesian Union,
 Send the Dutch Military Mission and the Dutch

 Table Conference treaty, and establish diplomatic
 relations with the Netherlands based on terms
 of full equality and advantageous tD both sides.
 2.    Seize and nationalize all factories, banks,

 Republic and send back the Dutch army and
 civil employees from West Irian.
 IN THE FIELD OF STRUCTURE OF THE STATE
 4.    Accomplish the sovereignty of the people.   This
 means giving all authority to the people.
 The greatest authority must be in the hands
 of representatives chosen by the people, who,
 at any time, can be withdrawn according to a
 decision of the majority of their electors.
 5.    All citizens who have reached the age of 18
 years have the right to choose and to be chosen
 for Parliament, without regard to wealth, sex,
 tribe (as D awa, Sunda, Minangkabau, Minahasa,
 Ambon, etc.) or religious belief.   Organize a
 balanced representation system in the elections.
 6.     Election of local democratic administrations
 with broad autonomy.   Abolish the system of
 local aristocratic government.

 unions, the freedom of movement and to choose
 employment, guarantee the right of all
 nationalities to obtain an equal salary for
 the same work.

 peasants; organize a system of peasant land
 ownership,  that means the individual owner-
 ship of the I_ar_d.   The foreign and the
 Indonesian landlords'  lands which have been
 seized, as well as the uncultivated lands,
 should be divided among farmers except those
 which are not meant to be divided as,  for
 instance, plantations employing modern
 techniques.   These lands and forest-lands
 should be controlled by the government.
 Lands should be given to each member of the
 peasants'  family.
 15.    Lands and other properties of rich peasants
 are not seized;  lands and other properties
 of middle-peasants wil_ be protected by the

 system and in building new ones.
 19.    To carry out with the force and instruments
 of the government the resettlement of a part

 cultivatable land which is not yet open.
 *Pologoro is another form of corvee,  or forced unpaid labor,
 originated by the Spaniards in the Philippines.   It is also called
 polo.

 30.      To cancel all treaties and agreements made
 between Indonesia and other countries that
 damage freedom and the peaceful atmosphere
 of Indonesia.
 The program was one that would appeal to most Indonesians.
 The only group that would suffer from its implementation would
 be the Dutch and other foreign businessmen, wealthy landlords and
 the money-lenders (mostly the Chinese in the rural areas); few
 Indonesians could take exception with the demands listed.   Thus
 it fulfills the chief aim of the party, presenting a program that
 appeals to the broad base of the population.   One of the demands
 is no longer a main issue since the Dutch-Indonesian Union is in
 the process of dissolving by mutual agreement.
 The program is reminiscent of the "people's democracies,"
 with modified socialism as the first step toward realization of a
 Communist state, an announced aim of the PKI.
 2.    March 195+ Congress
 The program was approved at the March 195)4 Congress of the
 PKI.    Other actions taken at that meeting included the dropping
 of Alimin and Wikana from the Central Committee and approval of
 the report on Tan Ling Djie.   In addition the congress approved
 several changes in the party's constitution (the text is given in
 Appendix A).   For the most part the congress was a rubber stamp
 of the Central Committee decisions of October 1953.
 3.
 Preparation for 1955 National Elections
 The major party activity in 1955 has been preparation for
 the national elections, which, after several re-schedulings, are
 now slated for 29 September 1955.   The party has organized
 election action committees to carry out propaganda objectives.
 It is seeking a place on all regional election committees and
 has protested the organization of any on which it is not
 represented.   The PKI succeeded in obtaining approval of the
 party symbol, the hammer and sickle, not only for themselves but
 for non-party candidates as well, but the action was success-
 fully opposed by other parties and rescinded.
 To date no national elections have been held in the Indonesian
 Republic.   The few municipal elections which have been held have
 not been true tests of party strength because party platforms were
 not primary issues.   Forecasts of the 1955 election results by
 Indonesian political figures have varied widely according to,.the
 affialition of the forecaster.   A concensus of opinion of foreign
 observers--based on such factors as registration in rural and
 urban areas, extent of campaigning in specific areas, traditional
 Moslem conservatism in the rural sections, varying popularity of
 party leaders and scattered samplings of opinion by individual
 reporters--estimates the probable composition of the future
 Parliament as follows.,
 Masjumi (Indonesian Moslem Council):   40-60 per cent
 (now holds 43 seats, 18.3 per cent)

 PKI (Communist Party of Indonesia):   20-35 per cent
 (now holds 17 seats, 7.2 per cent)
 PNI (Indonesian Nationalist Party):   15-25 per cent
 (now holds 42 seats, 18.2 per cent)
 PIR (Greater Indonesian Union):   10-15 per cent
 (now holds 22 seats, 9.3 per cent)
 PSI (Indonesian Socialist Party):   5-10 per cent
 (now holds 15 seats, 6.4 per cent)
 Other parties:   scattered seats
 (now hold 96 seats, 40.6 per cent)
 The number of seats in Parliament, based on the population, will
 be increased from 235 to 266.
 The Constituent Assembly's 532 seats are to be filled by
 elections in December 1955.
 Reports have circulated that the two top men in the party,
 Aidit and Lukman, would be candidates for president and vice-
 president of the Republic.   14/  Although it seems unlikely that
 their strength will be sufficTent to form the post-election
 government;, it is likely that in the event of EL  coalition led by
 the PNI the Communists will be represented in the cabinet.
 Despite close rapport between the PNI and PKI, a recent
 occurrence shows that the PKI's ability to flout Indonesian law
 is limited.   In late 1954 Aidit made a speech '_n which he
 attacked Vice-president Hatta.   He was brought to trial and
 sentenced in late March 1955 to three months in prison for in-
 sulting the vice-president.

 II.   ORGANIZATION OF THE PARTY
 The 1954 constitution of the PKI outlines a complete party
 structure ranging from the central party machinery to the
 smallest cell.       In accordance with traditional Communist Party
 organization, it is based on the doctrine of "democratic
 centralism" spelled out in Article 18 of the PKI Constitution:
 The structural organization of the Party is
 based on the principle of democratic centralism,
 that is,     centralism based on democracy and democracy
 under centralized leadership.
 a.   All leading Party bodies from the lowest
 to the highest must be elected,
 b.   All leading Party bodies must at designated
 times report to the Party organization which elected
 them.
 c.   Each Party member must obey the decisions
 of the Party organization to which he belongs; the
 minority must obey the majority; the lower Party
 organizations must obey the higher, and all parts
 of the Party organization must obey the Central
 Committee.
 The purpose of this principle is twofold:   first, to give
 all party members ostensible participation in the party,
 permitting them to vote for officers and to review their work, and,
 second,  to solidify party discipline by spelling out the chain
 of command.   The control, however, is from above, the higher
 echelons ordering the results by stating who may be elected.
 Following the regional structure of the Indonesian Republic
 almost exactly,  the Constitution designates,  in Article 20,  the
 level of party organization that is to exist in each area.     Within
 each such party unit the general meeting of the group (the
 National Party Congress at the central level; the Party Conference
 at province, section, subsection and large resort** levels; and
 the General Membership Meeting at the smaller resort level) is the
 supreme authority of the unit.   Since a full membership meeting
 of all but the very smallest units would be too unwieldy to
 carry on the functions of the unit, each group elects a govern-
 ing body to carry out these duties, with a periodic review by the
 full membership in accordance with the basic principle
 *  Organization charts are given in Appendix D.
 ** Resort is the Indonesian term for the local units which are
 equivalent to cells in most Communist parties.   The distinction
 between the large resort and the resort is discussed later.

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 of demacratic centralism.   These governing bodies are the resort
 committee (recom) or great-re's'ort committee (recom besar), sub-
 section committee (subsecom), section committee (secom), provin-
 cial committee (provcom) and the PKI Central Committee (CC),
 increasing in rank in the order named.   The party units are known
 by their committee names.   While these committees are responsible
 for the over-all affairs of their respective units, they also
 select, from within their group, a still smaller unit to direct
 the affairs of the party component.  At the national level this
 group is called the Politburo; at other levels the Daily
 Council (Dewan Harlan).   The secretariats of these bodies are
 the chief functioning authorities of the party units, charged
 with the operation of day-to-day affairs of the unit.   The
 enlarged meeting of the Central Committee, including front
 organization representatives, is called the Pleno.   Similar units
 exist at the lower levels.
 A.    Central organization
 1,  National Party Congress
 The Constitution of the Party (Article 32) provides for the
 convening of the National Party Congress every four years,
 subject to advancement or delay by a decision of the Central
 Committee.  A legal quorum for the Congress is representation of
 more than half the party membership.   If party units representing
 more than half the party members request the convening of the
 Congress, the Central Committee must comply?  The Fifth National
 Party Congress was held in March 1954.
 The responsibilities and powers of the Congress (Article 33)
 include the election of members and candidate members of the
 Central. Committee, formation of policy and program, review of
 the constitution and amendment and validation of reports of the
 Central Committee and other party organizat'_ons.  Between party
 congresses the seat of authority rests with the Central Committee.
 2,.   Central Committee, Politburo and Secretariat
 a..   Organization and Functions
 The Constitution sets no specific figure for the size of the
 Central. Committee, but the number for the past few years, despite
 several. changes in membership, has remained constant at 13.
 Three candidate members provide replacements for Central
 Committee members who die, resign or are removed by the National
 Party Conference--a body, smaller than the National Party Congress,
 which may be convened between Party Congresses, by the Central
 Committee, to discuss important questions.   This conference may
 not, however, elect at one time members and candidates exceeding
 one-fifth of the total number of candidates and members.  Under
 the current set-up with a total of 16, the Conference would be
 limited. to three changes of personnel.   The Party Congress may
 select any PKI member to fill a vacancy in the Central Committee.
 Recent changes in the make-up of the members-hip of the Central
 Committee and the Politburo will be discussed in Section b below.)
 The Central Committee selects from its numbers the Politburo
 (currently numbering five) to conduct the day-to-day business of
 the party.   It also elects the secretary-g.erLeral of the party and

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 two deputies, who comprise the secretariat of the party and
 concurrently serve as the secretariat of the Central Committee
 and the chairrnan and vice-chairmen of the Politburo.   The
 Constitution (Article 37) provides for the establishment by the
 Central Committee of such departments as are required for proper
 functioning of the party.   Suggested departments include:
 organization, agit-prop, labor, farming, youth, women, represen-
 tation; science and culture and economy (see Section 3., below,
 for a further analysis).   These departments function under the
 leadership and supervision of the Politburo.  Another article
 of the Constitution (Article 35) charges the Central Committee
 with the responsibilities of dealing with other political parties
 and of alloting party personnel and finances.
 In intra-party affairs it is noteworthy that, despite the
 well-planned chain of command through subsecom-secom-provcom, it
 is not uncommon for the Central Committee to contact a secom or
 subsecom directly and vice versa.   Information copies of the
 correspondence in question is usually sent to the intervening
 levels of command.
 Two of the most important departments under the jurisdiction
 of the Central Committee are the Agit-Prop Department and the
 Organization Department.   These departments, as do almost all of
 the Central Committee's departments, have counterpart divisions
 at the lower echelons.   The Agit-Prop Department has two chief
 responsibilities, propaganda dissemination outside the party and
 the maintenance of the "correct line" within the party.   So
 important is this body that it has been headed by a Politburo
 member in recent years.   A report of October 1953 listed Sakirman
 as head of this department, but an early 1954 report lists D.N.
 Aidit, the secretary-general of the party, as being in charge of
 Agit-Prop activities, with Bachtaruddin, another Central Committee
 member, as his assistant.   15
 The functions of the Organization Department include
 responsibility for personnel and membership, document security
 and general administration.   Sudisman, a member of the Politburo,
 has been reported to be the chief of this department.   16    The
 Organization Department also has been likened to the con rot
 commissions, the disciplinary organization of other Communist
 parties, despite the designation of a Central Control Commission
 in Chapter Eight of the Party Constitution (same chapter in both
 the 1951 and 1954 constitution).   No reports mentioning the
 existence of a control commission have been received.   The 1953
 report that mentioned Sud.isman as head of the Organization
 Department also stated that there was no control commission in
 the PKI and that the Organization Department performed this
 function.   17   No other confirmation has been received, however.
 b.   Recent Membership Changes
 Information of May 1952 and May 1953 lists a Politburo of
 six members;  since October 1953 the number has been five.   The
 Party Constitution does not stipulate any number of members.   The
 following lists indicate the changes in Politburo membership
 in the past two years.

 During the period of the first two Politmburgs listed AJJ.mi.n
 was its head; during the last two Aidit has been secretary-general,,
 and Lukman and Njoto his deputies, ranking in the order named.
 The removal of Alimin, Tan Ling Due and Supardan from the Politburo
 in 1953 was the culmination of a factional dispute that had existed
 for some time.  While Tan and Supardan were dropped from the
 Central Committee in October, also, Alimin, probably out of
 deference to his past leadership, was not removed from'the com-
 mittee until the Congress of March 1954, although he was dropped
 from the Politburo.   The points of contention between the two
 factions are believed to be the campaign against the Darul Islam
 (DI), the dissident militant Moslem group in Indonesia, and
 support of the Ali Sastroamidjojo cabinet, which is still in
 power.  A report of late 1953 summarized their positions as
 follows:
 Anti-Darul Islam Campaign--The Alimin position
 was that the PKI should not wage a campaign against
 the DI lest it alienate the Moslem masses.   He felt
 that a possible resurgence of counter-revolutionary
 strength could force the PKI to retreat to the
 mountains where it would vitally need local support.
 Aidit agreed that the PKI needed strength among the
 masses, but claimed that since the DI was terrorizing
 the people, PKI opposition to the DI put the PKI on
 the same side as the masses of people.
 On support of the Cabinet--Alimin interpreted PKI
 support of the Sastroamidjojo Cabinet as a tactical
 move; Aidit contended that the PKI's support was sincere. 22
 In September 1953 Aidit issued a directive explaining how
 support of the cabinet, a policy opposed by Alimin, fitted into
 PKI tactics and strategy.   The changes in the Politburo are
 considered by some to orient the PKI more directly towards Moscow
 than towards Peiping.
 Support of Aidit's views by the rest of the Central Committee
 forced the removal of Alimin and his two chief supporters, Tan and
 Supardan, from the Politburo.  None were removed from the party
 and Supardan still represents the PKI in Parliament.   Tan was
 removed from the Central Committee for other reasons, as well.
 At the March Congress a long report was issued on the crime of
 Tan Lind; Djie-ism; described as "subjectivism, dogmatism and
 empiricism, causing the party to make-mistakes on the right and
 left, with results similar to Trotskyism." 2=f  This action was
 merely a rubber-stamping of the line pursuee at the Central
 Committee meeting in October 1953, which tool: action against
 Alimin and Supardan as well.   Though not,s-pecifioally'stat6d it is
 believed that some of the criticism directed against Tan was also
 intended for Alimin, 2

 The new hierarchy of the party definitely is a swing towards
 youth.   The three top men, Aidit, Lukman and Njoto are 32, 35 and
 30, respectively. 25    They represent a new core that rose in the
 party after the Madiun Affair of 1948.   They also represent
 leading supporters of the Leninist-Stalinist wing of the party.
 In November 1952 Aidit and Njoto went to Prague to WFTU head-
 quarters.   They remained in Europe until May 1953 and attended
 the funerals of both Stalin and Gottwald.   They have since
 pledged support to Malenkov. 2/
 Changes in the Central Committee have been more numerous.
 The Central Committee, for the past; few years, has consisted of
 13 men. For the past year or so a certain pattern in the
 functional breakdown of the Central Committee appears to have
 been developing.   Each member of a three man secretariat has an
 additional departmental function under his jurisdiction.   Four
 other men have a solely departmental function and six men super-
 vise party activities in a given area of Indonesia.   The candidate
 members also fit into the functional pattern.   One of them,
 Anwar Kadir, assists committee member Nursuhud in party activi-
 t.es in Central Sumatra. 27    (The Anwar Kadir who is a leading
 -1-gure in the Celebes/Moluccas Provincial Committee, is another
 man.)        The other two candidate members, A.Z. Anwar and
 Siswojo are in charge of the Provincial Committees in West and
 Central Java respectively, which are under the general super-
 vision of Sakirman. 22/
 The following lists show the composition of the Central
 Committee for the past few years,      indicating the rise and decline
 of certain leaders in the party;

 The lists show two major periods of change.   In October 1953
 six members were changed in a reorganization of the Central Com-
 mittee, as a result of the Aidit faction's gaining control.   In
 March 1954, at the Party Congress, two more changes were made in
 the committee.  Alimin was dropped because of the open factional
 dispute with Aidit, and a strong supporter, Wikana, suffered the
 same fate.   The current functional breakdown of the Central Com-
 mittee is as follows:
 *Sudisman was known to be a member of the Central Committee and
 Politburo at this time.  Anwar might have been only a candidate
 member.

 Borneo (Recent reports show him as
 head of activitiel3 in the Celebes and
 the Moluccas.  No information has been
 received to show whether he still
 directs affairs in Borneo.) 35
 The apparent designation of a fixed number,  (six) of the
 Central Committee members as area supervisors appears to be
 confirmed by the changes that took place when the two new members
 were elected in March 1954.  Both new men, Supit and Nursuhud,
 were made area supervisors.  One replaced Wikana, who was an area
 supervisor.   To make room for the other one among the area super-
 visors, Zailani was moved up to assist Sudisman.   Except for
 Sakirman and Perdede the area supervisors were all among the most
 recent additions to the Central Committee.  There are precedents
 for this promoting of members from the area supervisor status.
 Aidit was, in August 1952, supervisor for Sumatra, then became
 first secretary of the party and later secretary-general.    to
 Njotd was supervisor for East Java in August; 1952, moved up 3
 head the Action Committee in May 1953 and took his present posi-
 tion in October 1953. 37    If the Action Committee is a stepping
 stone Into the Politburo, then Achmadsumadi may be expected to
 be the next member of the Politburo.
 Although one Central Committee member is given responsibility
 for labor and peasant affairs, representatives of these elements
 of Indonesian society also exist in the PKI Central Committee Pleno.

 3.   The Pleno
 Pleno, as used in Indonesian Communist Party, means the
 plenary or enlarged central committee,  consisting of the members
 of the Central Committee and representatives from the front
 organizations,  or, at lower echelons of the party down to the
 subsecom level,  full meetings of those party units.
 Some confusion has existed over the use of the term.   The
 word pleno in the Indonesian language means "plenary."   It is
 used frequently in the Party Constitution to refer to meetings
 of both the Central Committee and lower echelons.   For example:
 Article 36.   A Pleno of the Central Committee
 shall be held at least every half year. However, the
 Politburo may extend or shorten this time depending on
 conditions.   Candidates for membership on the Central
 Committee may attend the Pleno of the Central Committee
 and may express their ideas, but they do not have the
 right of decisive vote.
 One report from Surabaya referred to a unit of this kind as the
 "Executive Committee for Front Organizations." 38/  Another
 Surabaya report used the term Plero for this kind of unit and
 added parenthetically, as if the Indonesian equivalent, Badan
 Pelaksana, which means "executive body."   This is the only time
 this   as   term has been used in available materials.  39/
 Although these bodies do not appear to have been given a
 legal status in the Constitution,  there is little doubt that they
 do exist and that they do play an important role in PKI affairs.
 The pleno is the only place in the party structure providing for
 front organization representation as such,* and apparently the
 party policy relevant to these fronts is put forth and in-
 structions to these groups is issued in the Central Committee
 Pleno.   The membership of the Pleno is as follows;  4

 Responsibility in Pleno
 Formerly head of East
 Java PKI; reported moved
 to Djakarta because he
 is an outstanding
 theoretician
 Whether the three candidate members of the Central Committee
 have any functions on the Pleno is qot known.   Of the Pleno
 membership, 12 are representatives in the Indonesian Parliament.
 One, Sumardi, was in Parliament until recently replaced by
 Lukman.   Of the 12 representatives, 9 are PKI representatives,
 Aidit, Lukman, Njoto,  Sakirman, Achmadsumadi, Pardede, Djaetun,
 Suwarti and Tjugito; 2 are SOBSI representatives, D okosudjono
 and Werdojo; and Sardjono is a BTI representative. '42/
 The one major front organization that is not directly
 represented on the Pleno is PERBEPBSI, the Communist veterans
 organization and militia.   It conceivably could fall under
 Achmadsumadi's Action Command although they are reported to be
 under the jurisdiction of Sakirman. 43/  The Party Constitution
 in Article 30 suggests the formation of a Culture Department.
 Its existence has not been reported, however.
 4.   Clandestine Party Organization
 No information is available or the existence or nature of an
 underground party, a structure found in other Communist parties.
 One small clue may exist in a reference to Kasim Werdojo as a
 secret member of the PKI Central Committee. )+9/  He formally
 joined the party, according to reports, in laTe 1954.  Werdojo
 is a high official of SOBSI and. one of its representatives in the
 Indonesian Parliament.   SOBSI would be a logical cover organiza-
 tion for the parallel underground structure, but there is no
 other evidence that it serves such a purpose.
 5.   Representation in Parliament
 As of May 1955 no election for Parliament had been had in
 the Republic of Indonesia.   The present body of 231 members
 consists of original appointees, provisionally named by the
 nationalist leaders after expulsion of the Dutch, or replace-
 ments because of death, :resignation or transfer of party alle-
 giance.   The PKI fraction of 17 is the fourth largest group in
 Parliament.   Two PKI affiliates, BTI and SOBSI, also are repre-
 sented in that body.   Originally each had three representatives
 but, because of switchs in party allegiance the representation
 of each is currently two.
 The first elections are scheduled for September 1955, after
 postponments.   All parties are eagerly preparing for them.   The
 PKI is gradually placing all members of its Central Committee in
 the present Parliament, before the October 1953 reorganization of
 the Central Committee most of the committee members held
 Parliament seats.   The recent appointments to Parliament take
 the Central Committee changes  into account, giving the following
 delegation:

 Thus, of the PKI delegation, four are members of the PKI
 Politburo and three others are Central Committee members.
 Central Committee members who do not hold seats in the PKI
 parliamentary delegation are Sudisman (the only Politburo man
 not in Parliament), Zailani, Supit, Adjitorop, Nurusuhud and
 DJokosudJono, although Djokosudjono heads the SOBSI delegation
 in Parliament.
 SOBSI and the BTI, both represented in the PKI Central

 Sumardi and Djaetun of the Pleno were recently replaced in
 the PKI delegation by Lukman and Bachtaruddin.   Other recent
 changes included Aidit for Ngadiman and Njoto for Abdullah
 Aidit, a non-party man who voted with the party and was
 considered a replacement for Tengku Jusuf Mudadalam, who switched
 .to the PNI.
 Of the other members of the PKI fraction, Supardan,
 Utarjo, Tjugito, Mudigdo and the recently replaced Djaetun were
 formerly members of the Central Committee.
 Four PKI members hold chairmanships or vice-chairmanships
 in Parliament:   Supardan is chairman of the Finance Committee;
 Sakirman, lst vice-chairman of the Economic Affairs Committee;
 Sutardjo, 2nd vice-chairman of the Defense Committee; and Mrs.
 Mudigdo, 2nd vice-chairman of the Justice and Security
 Committee. 41/
 The cabinet crisis of October-November 1954 brought a PKI
 request that Njoto be made minister of internal affairs and
 Sakirman minister of communications or of public works in the
 new cabinet.  Although not expecting these appointments, the PKI
 has used this method to inform the premier that he needs PKI
 support and that rewards for such support are expected. 45
 Zmd
 B.    Subnational Organization
 Below the national level the PKI organization closely
 resembles the regional organization of the Republic.   Article 20
 of the Party Constitution defines the level of party organization
 in each area from the province and city down to the factory and
 school.
 The highest subnational organization is the provincial
 party with its provincial party conference and provincial
 committee (Provcom).  A recent reorganization by the National
 Parliament dividing Kalimantan (Borneo) into three provinces
 was shortly followed by a similar reorganization in the PKI
 provincial structure.   The Republic's provincial breakdown is as
 follows:   Sumatera Utara (North Sumatra), Sumatera Tengah (Central
 Sumatra), Sumatera Selatan (South Sumatra)  Djakarta Raja
 (Greater Djakarta), Djawa Barat (Wes; Javaj, Djawa Tengah (Middle
 Java), Djawa Timur (East Java), Sulawesi (Celebes), Maluku
 luccas), Kalimantan Barat (West Borneo), Kalimantan Timur
 Nast EBorneo) and Kalimantan Selatan (South Borneo) and the Nusa
 Tenggara (Southeast Islands), formerly called the Sunda Ketjil
 or Lesser Sundas,   There is also an area with a special status--
 Daerah Istimewa Jogjakarta (Special area of Jogjakarta).

 The party conforms to these provincial divisions with the
 exception of a single provincial party's serving both Sulawesi
 and Maluku and Nusa Tenggara's partition between Djawa Timur
 and Sulawesi/Maluku.   On the basis of the current trend, the unit
 may be expected to split to conform as soon as it is large enough.
 Conformation is not out of patriotism but in preparation for
 the 1955 general elections.  Jogjakarta, while not given a status
 equivalent to a province, which it has in the national structure,
 is given a somewhat different treatment within Djawa Tengah, in
 that Jogjakarta City and all regencies are secoms under Djawa
 Tengah :Provcom.
 Below the provincial level the 1954 Amended Party Constitu-
 tion made many changes.  Article 20 provides for a section
 party, a section party conference and a section committee (Secom)
 in regencies(kabupaten) and large cities (kota besar).   Prior to
 the change a regency was scheduled for only a subsection party,
 etc., the next lower level. The newer system had not been fully
 adhered to, and investigation indicates that it was planned as
 an intermediary step to the present organization.   The interme-
 diary steps are worth examining as the process of converting to
 the new organization is slow and not all changes have been
 reported as yet.  Between the province and.the regency in
 Indonesia is a level called a residency.   As of late 1953 and
 early 1954 Sumatra's three provinces and Middle Java had a Secom
 for each residency, with a subsecom for each regency.   Scattered
 areas in East Java followed this pattern.  Recent reports show
 the breaking up of these units into secoms for each regency with,
 on occasions, a corresponding increase in stature of sub-organiza-
 tions.  The party units in Borneo, which was only recently
 divided. into three provinces, also are beginning to make similar
 adjustments.  So marked is the party's pattern of conforming to
 its constitution that one may estimate the status of areas for
 which information has not been received.   Appendix B is a list of
 reported data on the provcom, secom and sub-secom structure of
 the PKI.
 Next in rank below the secom, as mentioned, is the subsecom.
 Paragraph e of Article 20 provides for subsecoms for subdistricts
 (ketjamatan) and small cities (kota ketjil)..  The subsecom is
 further subdivided into resorts (the equivalent of a cell).
 Paragraph f of the same article provides for resort parties,
 resort meetings and resort committees (Recorns) in factories, mines,
 villages, businesses, offices and schools.   There are two kinds
 of recoms, the recom and the recom besar (G:^eat recom), the
 difference being one of size not status.   The recom is considered
 the basic unit of party structure.  A recom may, however, be sub-
 divided into grup, or a recom besar into a ~3ub-resort committee
 (subsecom).
 The terminology used to describe the various levels of
 organization were changed at a meeting of the Central Committee
 in October 1953.   A comparative list of old and new terminology
 follows:

 The highest level of authority at the province, section,
 subsection or large resort level is the respective party
 conference.   At the resort level the equivalent is the resort
 meeting.   Based on the principle of "democratic centralism,"
 each echelon is under the jurisdiction and control of the next
 higher echelon.
 The highest authority of the party province (Provinsi
 Partai)  is the party provincial conference (Konferensi Provinsi
 Partai  .    The Constitution requires that it meet every six months.
 The period of time between conferences may, however, be
 shortened or extended by a decision of the provincial committee
 (provcom).   The party provincial conference elects the provcom,
 daily council (Dewan Harian) and secretariat of the provincial
 ,arty for a period of two years.   The daily council and secre-
 tariat of the party province are equivalent to the Central
 Committee's Politburo and Secretariat, with the provcom the
 provincial counterpart of the Central Committee.   The full
 provcom is required to meet every three months.   Corresponding
 to the departments at Central Committee level, the provcom has
 divisions (Bagian) for labor, agit-prop, etc.   These are
 represented in the provcom pleno. L7/
 The provcom is the direct lirk in the chain of command
 between the national party organization and the lower-echelons
 under its jurisdiction.   Through the party provincial conference
 it hears, discusses and validates reports of lower echelon units
 and directs their activities. !8/  Although the secoms and other
 lower groups are directly under the province,  they often deal
 directly with the Central Committee.   The provcom also is
 charged with the supervision of party fractions in non-party
 organizations.
 Fees, dues and other financial support received by subor-
 dinate units are channeled through the provcom en route to the
 Central Committee.   The provcom retains 90 per cent and passes
 the remaining 10 per cent on to the Central Committee.   The
 provcom then determines its financial needs and those of the
 sections,  subsections and resorts under its  jurisdiction and
 distributes the money accordingly.  )49/
 The provcom also is permitted, under special conditions, to
 accept new party members after the usual period of candidacy. 50/
 The importance of the provcoTp is emphasized by the fact
 that some provcom leaders are on the Central Committee--
 Adjitorop, Bachtaruddin, Nursuhud, Perdede and Supit--and the
 provcom (or its predecessor set-up, the KCC) has proved a
 stepping-stone to the Central Committee for others.   The change
 in October 1953 from KCC to provcoms was made to provide more on-
 the-spot supervision of areas than was possible under the old
 organization.

 2.   The Section
 In addition to the section organizations for every regency
 and large city, called for by the Constitution, there is a
 section committee (rather than subsection) for each subdistrict
 (ketjamatan) of Greater Djakarta, which has a status in both
 party and national framework equivalent to that of a province,
 The organization of the party section (Seksi Partai), party
 section conference (Konferensi Seksi Partai) and section
 committee (Secom) is similar to the provincial organization.   The
 period between meetings of the party section conference is
 prescribed as four months subject to changes by the secom.   Their
 responsibilities and functions are the same on a lower level, as
 their provincial counterparts.   The secom, daily council and
 secretariat are elected for two years.   Secom meetings are re-
 quired every two months. 52
 Although the chain of command below the secom is the sub-
 secom and recom (or recom besar), the subsecom has no juris-
 diction over several matters, giving the secom direct control of
 certain resort activities.  Approval of the formation of new
 recom and recom besar must be given by the secom, rather than the
 subsecom. 53   The secom also has the responsibility for vali-
 dating can  date members' advancement to full party membership,
 and expulsion of members from the party needs secom approval. 5~+
 The secom and higher echelons may accept members into the party
 without a period of candidacy.
 To assist the secom in its work are a series of divisions
 similar to those of the provcom.  Some of these division heads
 and secom leaders have moved on to higher positions, another
 indication of the road to top party posts.
 3.   The Subsection
 Article 20 of the Part           Constitution provides for a party
 subsection (Subseksi Partai , party subsection conference
 (Konferensi Subseksi Partai       and subsection committee (subsecom)
 for each subdistrict (ketiamatan) and small city (kota ketjil).
 Progress toward this goal is slow but steady.
 The party subsection conference meets every two months,
 subject to changes by the subsecom.  The conference elects the
 committee to serve for one year.  The daily council and

 secretariat also are elected and serve in the same capacities
 as their counterparts at higher levels.   The subsecom is assisted
 by divisions, following the pattern at higher levels. 55/
 The subsecom is responsible for and supervises the activi-
 ties of all recom, recom besar and party fractions in non-party
 organizations within its ;jurisdiction.   On certain activities,
 however, the subsecom cannot rule, as outlined in the previous
 section.
 4.   The Resort and Great Resort
 The 1954 Amended Constitution provided for the first time
 for two kinds of party resort units:   the resort committee (recom)
 for the party resort, and the great resort committee (recom
 besar) for the party great resort (resort besar).   The two units
 are equal in rank in the party organization, the difference
 being chiefly in size.   A recom besar is formed when the number
 of members or candidates exceeds 100.   The recom besar may be
 s'abdivided into subresort committees (subrecoms), while the resort
 may be divided into grup (groups).   The full membership meeting
 of the great resort is called a conference;  of the resort, a
 meeting.   These are the only differences between the two organiza-
 tions.
 Article 20 of the Constitution provides;
 f.   For a factory, mine, village,   enterprise,
 office or school there shall be a Party Resort, a
 Resort Meeting and a Resort Committee (Recom) or Party
 Great Resort,  Party Great Resort Conference and a
 Great Resort Committee (Recom Besar). The resort is
 divided into Groups, which consist of, at the most, 7
 (seven) persons who work and live close by.
 On occasion the abbreviations RP and RL are used.   An RP is
 a resort pabrik, or factory resort; an RL is a resort lokal, or
 village resort.   Either is correctly called a resort, and its
 committee a recom.
 Party resorts may be formed with less than seven members,
 but such resorts do not form a recom, merely electing a   chief
 and deputy chief.   The recom and recom besar are elected by a
 plenary meeting of their organizations and serve for six months.
 The size of the recom may vary from three to seven members.
 Unlike units of higher echelons, the resort does not elect a
 daily council or secretariat, the recom itself being small enough
 to direct day-to-day activities. 56/
 The Constitution,  in Chapter VI, refers to the resort as
 the "basic unit" of the party.   In the parlance of other
 Communist parties this would be a cell or club.   As the basic
 unit and the one in closest contact with the masses,  the resort
 is charged with a great share of the responsibility for indoctri-
 nating the people, winning converts and maintaining the party line
 before the public.   Every party member, regardless of rank,
 belongs to a resort.   This requirement is largely to assist the
 party in disciplinary action.   Article 49 lists the following
 responsibilities:
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 The Party Resort must endeavor to create close
 unity between the Party and the masses of people.
 Responsibilities of the Party Resort are as follows:
 a.   Conduct propaganda and organizational
 activities among the masses to clarify the ideas of
 the party and the decisions of higher party organiza-
 tions.
 b.   Study the feelings and aims of the masses
 and report such immediately to higher party organiza-
 tions; study the economic, political anc: cultural
 lives of the people; and organize the masses to solve
 their problems themselves.
 c.   Recruit new members, collect party dues,
 supervise and examine the reports of party members
 and: see that party discipline is maintained by
 members.
 d.   Educate Party members and organize in-
 struction for them.
 Although the resort is directly under t1..e subsection in
 party organization, some of its functions, including the forma-
 tion of new resorts, are supervised by the section (see II.,B,2).
 C.    Membership
 1.  Numerical Strength
 Estimates of the size of the PKI membership place it between
 100,000 and 500,000.   The lower number is close to the figure
 given by D.N. Aidit, the party secretary-general, at the March
 195+ Party Congress.   His figure was 126,671 members and candi-
 dates.  He did not give a date for this figure, but it is
 believed to be as of early 1953. 51/  Other reports state that
 the party gave 126,000 as its mem ership figure in 1952. 58
 Still others have placed the membership at 1CO,000 exclud ng
 candidate members.   A party membership of 10C,000 members and
 26,000 candidates would be a ratio of one car..didate for every
 four members, a ratio that may or may not continue.   Indirect
 confirmation of the figure of 100,000 members is to be found in
 a January 1953 Central Committee directive or.. party finances.
 The report states, "In order to buy ourselves a publishing firm,
 at least 1,500,000 rupiahs about $130,00 would be required,
 which would mean an average of 15 rupiahs from every member,"
 indicating 100,000 members. 59
 A more recent statement in November 1954, attributed to
 Perlis Pardede of the Politburo, claimed 500,000 members.   This
 figure may be indicative of recent party growth. 60   A report
 of September 195+ spoke of recent rapid strides to en in the
 expansion of party membership.   It stated:   "During the past
 year, the Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI) has increased its
 membership throughout Indonesia by 125 percent.   Prior to the
 Ali Cabinet, each full member of the PKI was required to have
 under his supervision only two candidate members; now each member
 must have six candidates." 61    (Note the ratio of four candi-
 dates per member above.)  Language difficulties and party

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 double-talk have often confused statements of membership
 increase, and it is not certain whether the intended figure was
 125,000 or 225,000.  With the formula of six candidates to one
 member the party has a potential strength of 875,000 if the
 membership figure of 125,000 is used, or 1,575,000 if 225,000 is
 taken as the base.  Whichever membership figure is used, the
 required increase in number of candidates per member would make
 large membership gains, even by November 1954, a possibility,
 lending some credence to Pardede's claims.
 Other reports have spoken of party growth in various parts
 of the country, but they cannot be properly evaluated without
 more statistics.   It is known that the party has been strength-
 ened in the Djakarta area and some of the remoter portions of
 Java and Sumatra.   It is also developing in areas where there was
 little or no activity before--Celebes, Borneo, Nusa Tenggara and
 the Moluccas.
 In addition to party members and candidates, many others,
 numbering in perhaps the millions, are sympathetic to and support
 the party.   They include many front organizations,  such as the
 labor organization SOBSI, which claims a membership of more than
 2,000,000.   It is therefore conceivable that the assets of the
 PKI could reach potentially a strength of 2,000,000 or more. 62
 2.   Membership Rules and Procedures
 There are two classes of membership in the PKI  members,
 (anggota) and candidate-members (tjalon-anggota).    These candi-
 dates should not be confused with the three Central Committee
 candidates, who are highly-ranked, full members of the party.)
 Provisions relating to admission to candidacy or to full member-
 ship, as well as rules for expulsion and the rights and responsi-
 bilities of members are discussed in Chapter II of the 1954
 Party Constitution.   Two major changes were made from previous
 rules on membership, one requiring new members to be Indonesian
 citizens the other, minor changes in expulsion procedures.
 a.  Admission to Membership or Candidacy
 Article 5 of the Constitution states:
 Anyone can become a member who is a citizen and
 has attained the age of 18 who agrees to the Program
 and Constitution of the Party,  joins and actively
 participates in a Party organization, obeys Party
 decisions, pays initiation fees and Party dues,
 attends meetings and classes of the Party, and reads
 Party literature.
 Candidates for party membership must be nominated by a
 party member who is required to furnish accurate biographical
 information and accurate information on the candidate's ideology
 and character.  Before presenting the nomination the member must
 have furnished the prospective candidate information on the
 Party Constitution and policies.   Prior to confirmation of a
 candidacy the responsible party committee appoints a group of
 officials to interview and exchange views with the prospective
 candidate. 63/

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 The length of candidacy varies with the social status of
 the applicant and his ability to comply with the provisions for
 membership.   The following rules, relevant to the period of
 candidacy and membership eligibility, are given in Article 8 of
 the Party Constitution:
 Party members are admitted only on an individual
 basis in accordance with the provisions for member-
 ship as stipulated below:
 a.  Workers, farm workers, poor farmers, poor
 city dwellers or soldiers can only be accepted for
 membership upon the recommendation of two Party members,
 and after a decision of a general meeting of the
 Group and the Resort with validation by the Secom
 and after a period of candidacy of 6 months.
 b.  Middle class farmers, officials, intellec-
 tuals and independent workers (doctors, lawyers, etc.),
 can become Party members upon the recommendation of
 two Party members, one of whom must have been a
 member for more than one year continuously, and after
 a decision of a general meeting of the croup and
 Resort which has been approved by the Secom, and after
 having been a candidate for one year.
 c.  A person belonging to any social circle
 other than those stipulated in "a" and "b" above can
 become a member of the Party only upon the recommenda-
 tion of two Party members, one of whom rust have
 been a Party member for more than three years
 continuously, and after a general meeting of the
 Group and Resort and approval of the Secom, and after
 having been a candidate for two years.
 d.  Ordinary members of other political parties
 who have left those parties and desire to enter our
 Party, can become members only upon the recommenda-
 tion of two members of the Party, one of whom has been
 a member for over three years continuously, and after
 the decision of general meetings of the Group and
 Resort which has been approved by the Secom.
 Members of other political parties who have been
 local (daerah) officials, but who have left their
 parties and desire to enter our Party, must be
 recommended by two members, one of whom must have
 been a Party member for more than five years
 continuously.   The nomination of such persons must
 be accepted by the Group and Resort and approved by
 the Provcom.
 Officials of other parties who have occupied
 high national positions but who have left their
 parties and desire to enter our Party must be
 approved by the Central Committee.   For all the
 above groups, a candidacy period of two years is
 required.

 Because of the closer ties of' the bourgeois elements
 (paragraph b) to the capitalist world, the party requires a
 longer period of candidacy and indoctrination for them than
 for the proletarian and agrarian classes (paragraph a)--
 following the principles established by Lenin for the gradual
 integration of all persons into a Communist society.   The
 grouping of the proletariat with the agrarian class follows
 the practice in the people's democracies of China and the
 satellites.   Because the strength of the movement in these
 countries is predominantly agrarian, the Communists have set
 aside temporarily the principle of "dictatorship of the
 proletariat" and have substituted a united front of proletarian
 and agrarian classes led by the proletariat.
 A candidate member has the same rights and responsi-
 bilities as a member except that he is not permitted to vote
 for officers or on policy matters.   The time of candidacy is
 calculated from the date of confirmation of application for
 candidacy, and the length may be shortened or extended by the
 appropriate party committee, depending on the candidate's
 fulfillment of the provisions for membership.   Candidacy also
 rcxay be revoked before full membership is granted if these pro-
 visions are not fulfilled.   Candidates, as well as members who
 change their place of residence, may become candidates or
 members of the new place by presenting a letter of information
 from the party committee of his former place of residence. 6U/
 b.   Expulsion or Termination of Membership
 Voluntary termination of membership or candidacy may be
 achieved only after reasons are submitted to the head of the
 group who in turn passes it on to the recom.   At a meeting of the
 recom the member's or candidate's name is stricken from the rolls
 and the action is reported to the subsecom.
 A member may be automatically dropped from the party
 register if, for a period of six months:
 he has not taken Fart in party life;
 he has not undertaken any party work;
 he has failed to pay dues without a valid reason.
 He is dropped at a meeting of the group,  then a meetino/f
 the resort which sends it on to the Subsecom for approval.     5/
 At the resort meeting the member or candidate in question must be
 present and must be given an opportunity to defend himself.
 Secom approval is necessary for expulsion even though, under
 special conditions, the subsecom may take preliminary action.
 The vote to expel a member must be by a two-thirds majority of
 those entitled to vote and must be at a full committee meeting. 66
 c.  Oath of Membership
 The oath of the party is taken by every member-
 I ... declare my agreement with the program
 and Constitution of the Party, and hereby declare
 my readiness to become a full/or candidate member
 37

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 of the PKI.   I swear to fulfill all my Party responsi-
 bilities, to guard the unity of the Party; to carry
 out the decisions of the Party to become an example
 to others in the struggle for our nation and people;
 to strengthen the relation between the Party and
 the masses; to strive to deepen my awareness of and
 to master the principles of Marx-Leninism; to be
 strai.ghtfoward and honest towards the Party; to
 observe Party discipline and to keep watch on the
 Party's safety.   This is my declaration and oath to
 the Communist Party of Indonesia, the Party that I
 look to with respect and love.
 The oath is taken twice by a party member, once when he
 becomes a candidate member and again when he becomes a full
 member, as prescribed in Article 4 of the Constitution.
 1.   Party Dues
 Party dues, on a sliding scale based on a member's monthly
 income, are prescribed in Chapter IX of the Party Constitution.
 Dues range from half a rupiah (less than five cents) for those
 earning less than 150 rupiahs per month (about $13), to one and a
 half per cent of gross monthly income for those earning more
 than 650 rupiahs (a little less than $60).   In addition, a member
 is required to pay such other assessments and dues as the party
 may prescribe.
 Another source of party revenue discussed in the Constitu-
 tion is in Article 60:
 A. party member who receives a position of profit
 in the name of the party is responsible to turn over
 to the party all profits therefrom and he shall re-
 ceive an honorarium according to arrangements estab-
 lished by the Party.
 Whether this provision applies to salaries of elected or ap-
 pointed officials, such as members of Parliament or regional
 officials, is not known.
 Article 61 of the Party Constitution provides that the
 provcom retains 90 per cent of all dues and other income, and
 that it turns over the remaining 10 per cent to the Central
 Committee.   The Provcom allots the nine-tenths it retains to
 cover its own financial needs and those of the secoms, subsecoms
 and recoms.
 2.   Financial Problems
 Numerous party appeals for additional funds and many reports
 of financial difficulties, indicate that dues, fees and income
 from special sales (of postcards, etc.) are insufficient to meet
 the financial needs of the PKI.   The cry for more revenue extends
 from the Central Committee down to the recom.   The usual
 complaint f:^om above is that the recoms are not collecting all
 38
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 they are supposed to collect.   Occasional statements also have
 accused units of withholding part of their funds.
 Reports of the financial difficulties of various party
 organs, notably Harian Rakjat, are frequent. 67/  Every special
 function--from party congress to a trip by a member of the
 Central Committee has necessitated collection of additional
 funds,  from contributions,  sale of pictures and assessments. 68/
 Instructions stress the need for obtaining capital from
 non-party members.   The purpose is two-fold:  to win new members
 and to supplement the limited resources of party members, which
 the party feels it can assess at almost any time.
 No known statute prescribes the contributions from affil-
 iated front organizations.   From time to time specific contribu-
 tions for special purposes have been reported from these groups,
 but no evidence of any regular transmittal of funds, although
 probably such an arrangement existE.   Some examples of previous
 financial support,  including that of front groups, are as
 follows:
 1.   In connection with a visit to Njoto of the Politburo
 to Sumatra in April 1954 a report said:
 On 31 March 19;4 the Seksi Comite
 (SC) of the Partai Komunis Indonesia East
 Coast Sumatra called a meeting to discuss
 funds for the expenses of the forth-
 coming visit of Njoto, member of the PKI
 Politburo.   Jusuf Adjitorop,  of the North
 Sumatra Provincial Committee, announced
 that anticipated expenses of the visit
 would be R15,000,  of which Sentral
 Organisasi Buruh Selu.ruh Indonesia (SOBSI)
 /The labor federation affiliated with the
 PKI7 would be held responsible for raising
 R17,000, and such groups as farmer
 organizations, the World Peace Committee,
 and Pemuda Rakjat /the Communist youth
 group7 the balance.   As of 3 April only
 R4,000 had been contributed, and letters
 were sent to each resort committee in
 East Coast Sumatra ordering a contribution
 of R100 each. 69/
 2.   In November 1953, R200,000 was obtained for the
 erection of a new headquarters building.   Half of
 this came from the Chung Hlia Ch'iao T'uan Tsung
 Hui,  the leading pro-Communist federation of
 Chinese societies.   Another R50,000 came from
 SOBSI and the rest from private donations. 70/
 In addition to these sources,  it also has been suggested that
 the PKI receives funds from the Chinese Communist Embassy, either
 directly or through such organizations as the Chung Hua Ch'iao
 T'uan Tsung Hui and others. 71/  Funds from the USSR and other
 places also have been rumored These have not been confirmed.
 Nevertheless,  the PKI faces a chronic financial problem.   This
 is one of the motives behind the ceaseless drive for many new
 members, a drive which has been criticized as drawing too many
 insecure members into the party.

 3.   Party Salaries
 Few party personnel receive salaries from the PKI.   At the
 Central Committee and Provincial Committee level (and probably in
 some of the lower echelons) a few, called "fulltimers," receive a
 regular stipend from the party.   In the Central Committee offices
 16 such recipients are listed as receiving from R300 to R950.
 The period covered was not specified, but is believed to be a
 year.   Those known to have received such remuneration include
 Pak A?.mu, Olohan Hutapea (the former head of the East Java
 Provcom, brought to Djakarta because of his strong theoretical.
 knowledge; a member of the CCPKI Pleno), D.N. Aidit (the part
 secretary-general), Hadi, Sudisman (a member of the Politburo),
 Rachmad, Zain and Achmadsumadi (a member of' the Central Committee).
 Eight typists and couriers also receive a regular salary.
 Members receiving a salary through some other party means, such
 as representing the party in Parliament, turn over that salary
 to the party or relinquish their fulltimers salary. 72/
 E,    Training
 Party training is a continuous process, starting with the
 first application for membership and ending only when one either
 leaves the party or reaches the highest party positions.
 Training is carried on at all party levels and in party-affil-
 iated front organizations.   It may consist of general training in
 party doctrine, affairs and discipline or of special training,
 such as in agitation and propaganda.   Special training is also
 given for special events as the forthcoming general elections.
 Typical of instructions for the new applicant was a booklet
 prepared by the Central Committee in 1952 which was given to
 each new applicant for retention.   The booklet was called
 Konstitusi Partai Komunis Indonesia (Constitution of the
 Communist Party of Indonesia) and consisted of 43 pages divided
 into six sections:
 1.   Pendjelasan tentang Kedudukan Konstitusi
 (Explanation of the Constitutional Position)
 2.   Program Umum PKI (General Program of the PKI)
 3.   Konstitusi PKI (Constitution of the PKI)
 he 1951 Constitutio7
 4.   Pendjelasan Penglaksanaan Fasal 4 Konstitusi
 (Explanation of the Realization of Article 4
 of the Constitution)
 5.   Program PKI untuk Pemerintah Nasional Koalisi
 (PKI Program for the National Coalition Government)
 6.   Sembojan Perdjuangan (Slogans for the Struggle) 73
 The Article 4 of the 1951 Constitution is virtually the same as
 Article 8 in the new Party Constitution (see Appendix A), dealing
 with the membership requirements for the various elements of the
 nation, such as farmers, workers and small businessmen.   A new
 booklet has probably been issued based on the 1954 Constitution.

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 The applicant is required to study the booklet and be able
 to discuss it and answer questions about it.   It is the minimum
 of information that every party member is expected to know.
 Training on these aspects does not end at this point.   Even
 members of several years are expected to attend lectures and
 discussion groups on these subjects and to reinforce their
 knowledge by reading other standard Communist literature.   High
 on the list are the works of Marx, Engels, Stalin, Lenin, Mao
 Tse-tung, Liu Shao-chi and Musso's Djalan Baru (New Road).   Other
 books mentioned specifically in the Draft Program of the PKI,
 adopted at the Central Committee meeting of 6-8 October 1953,
 included the following? 74/
 Lenin's Left-Wing Communism, an Infantile Disease
 Stalin's History of the soviet Communist Party and
 Socialist Economic Questions in the USSR
 Malenkov's Report to the 19th Congress on the
 Activities of the Central Committee of
 the Communist Party of the Soviet Union
 Mao Tse-tung's On Contradiction
 Members also are required to have a fair knowledge of world
 history and some knowledge of political science.   A list of 163
 questions on these subjects was given party members in North
 Sumatra well in advance of the actual examination time.   A
 leader of the North Sumatra PKI stated that "the questions were
 not just a test of facts, but also of the  'revolutionary spirit'"
 and would enable him "to tell who the true Communists in his
 organization were."   Few were expected to achieve satisfactory
 grades in the examination, even with the advance preparation; low
 grades would emphasize the need for additional training.   The
 questions are so pinpointed that probably few Western scholars
 other than history or political science specialists could
 achieve a high grade without extensive research. 75/
 As part of their training all members and candidates are
 required to read the three major party organs, the daily Harian
 ak at (Peoples Daily), the monthly Bintang Merah (Red Star) and
 the PKI Bulletin.   Members are supposed to hold discussions on
 items appearing in these publications. 76/
 Because of the rapid growth of the party and the shortage
 of trained leaders, much emphasis is placed on the training of
 party cadres.   Typical of this training is a program under way
 in Djakarta Raja Provcom.   Training courses are held in each
 secom and subsecom and at provcom level.   To the provcom classes
 are sent representatives of each sub-unit,  usually two or three
 of the key personnel,  to receive instruction from high officials
 of the provcom.   Classes are held from three to six hours a week
 and last for several months.   The personnel attending these
 classes are then expected to conduct classes at their own
 echelons to pass on the teachings of the leaders to the member-
 ship at large. 77
 The party leaders are continually stating that more training
 is required or that training is behind schedule.   They urge con-
 tinued study and intensive training of cadres for the formation
 of new units.   Currently training for the scheduled elections is
 high on the agenda.

 F.   Press
 The PKI uses the printed word extensively -;o retain and gain
 support.  Besides the many leaflets on individual subjects and
 the translations of works of the past and present leaders of
 international Communist thinking, the party publishes newspapers
 and periodicals to aid its cause.  As mentioned, some of these,
 notably Harian Rak at and Bintang Merah, are required reading.
 The party has other publications, some national and some local.
 Production of the key publications, including translations of
 foreign writers, is controlled by the Ja asan Pembaruan (Modern
 Institute) in Djakarta, established in September 1952, Djaetun,
 the institute's managing director, 78/ is editor of Bintanz
 Merah, its representative on the CCPYI Pleno and a former member
 of both the Central Committee and the PKI fraction in Parliament.
 The staff of directors also includes Aidit, Lukman and Njoto of
 the Politburo and Pardede of the Central Committee.   The
 Institute reportedly is housed in the headquarters building of
 the Central Committee. 79/
 Below are 11 publications attributable to the PKI or PKI-
 sponsored front organizations.   The list is not complete.   The
 publications are given in alphabetical order rather than in order
 of importance.
 1.  Analisa (Analysis).  A November 1953 report referred to
 Analisa as a new pro-Communist weekly in Djakarta.   The editor
 is Daniel Abdullah, a Communist and formerly chief editor of the
 Menara Buruh on the island of Bangka. 80/
 2.  Bebas (Be Liberated).  Reports of a publication by this
 name were made as early as September 1952, when it was reported
 to be suffering financial difficulties and that subscriptions
 and advertisements were not sufficient to meet; publishing costs. 81
 Two weeks later R2,000 reportedly were needed in three days to
 purchase issue number six from the printers. E/  A report of
 December 1952 mentioned that issue number nine was not published
 because of lack of funds and that the PKI owed the printer
 R7,000. E/  In February 1954 a report noted that the PKI of
 North Su7matra would start publishing Bebas about mid-March.
 Whether this is to be a continuation of the previous publication
 or an entirely new one of the same name is not clear. 84/
 3.  Bendera Buruh (Labor's Flag).   Published in Djakarta on
 an irregular basis by SOBSI, Bendera Buruh is sold primarily to
 PKI members.  A July 1953 report stated that of 6,000 copies
 printed at that time, about half remained unsold.   The editor of
 the publication is Sugiri, duputy secretary of the SOBSI
 Information Bureau. 85/
 4.   Bintang Merah (Red Star).   Supposedly a monthly,
 although often two issues are combined, Bintang,Merah is one of
 the leading PKI publications and is required reading for all
 members.   In it appear articles by key PKI men as well as
 pronouncements of the party line and policies.   The March-April
 1954 issue carried the proceedings of the Party Congress and a
 full text of the revised Party Constitution.  Djaetun is the
 editor.  A July 1953 report lists 8,000 copies sold of a total
 printing of 11,000 on prior issues.   In the spring of 1953 the

 periodical received R25,000 for the publication of New China,
 a publication for the Chinese minority in Indonesia.-$6/
 5.   Harian Berita Indonesia (Indonesia News Daily).   The
 PKI reportedly bought this paper in the name of Tachsin, the
 chief editor. 8/
 6.   Harlan Rak at (People's Daily).   Although a Communist
 paper for several years, it was reportedly purchased by the
 Communists on 1 October 1953.   The corporate shares were taken
 by the PKI, Ja asan Pembaruan, the Estate Workers Federation of
 the Republic of Indonesia  Sarikat Buruh Perkebunan Republik
 Indonesia - SARBUPRI) and the Railway Workers Union (Sarikat
 Buruh Kereta Api - SBK4).  The paper also has been reported as
 owned by the weekly Sunday Courier.   The last two are important
 Communist labor organizations in Indonesia.  88/  Although re-
 quired reading for all PKI members as the lea in  party organ,
 its paid circulation is reportedly only between 6,000 and 12,000,
 and the paper is almost constantly in financial difficulties.
 Only the support of Siauw Giok-tjoan, a wealthy Indonesian Chinese
 and former editor of the paper, and contributions such as funds
 reported from the Chinese Communist Embassy in Djakarta and the
 Soviet Embassy in Bangkok, keep the paper from folding. L q/  The
 estimated monthly deficit is about R5,000.   Siauw, who resigned
 to take active part in Communist affairs affecting the Chinese
 community, reportedly is scheduled to become the editor of a
 Chinese language edition of the paper.   An April 1955 edition of
 the paper lists Njoto, Supeno and Naiboho as editors and Niaboho
 as the "responsible" editor.   H. Olena was the paper's repre-
 sentative in the CCPKI Pleno in 1953. 90
 7.   Lukisan (Art).   Published monthly in Medan, Lukisan
 covers such fields as drama, films, art and sports.   Its first
 issue of 10,000 was non-political.   Its staff is largely made
 up of PKI members and members of Communist front groups.   The
 editor-in-chief is B. Siagian; editors are B. Harahap and Tamas
 Anwar.   All three are PKT members. 91/
 8.   Pendorong (Stimulus).   First published in Medan in
 September 1952, this paper has fluctuated through several stages
 of control between Abdul Xarim MS and the accepted leader of
 the North Sumatra PKI, Adjitorop.   Its estimated circulation is
 3,000. 92 Recent financial support has come from SARBUPRI, and
 it is possible that SARBUPRI may take over publication. 93/
 9.    PKI Bulletin.   Three tho.-isand copies of the Bulletin are
 sold to PKI units as required reading for all PKI members.   No
 definite publication schedule has been reported. 94/
 10.   Sunday Courier.   This weekly is published and sold in
 West Java.  A July 1953 estimate put the circulation at 5,500 of
 7,000 (copies sold).   The paper has been reported the owner of
 liar Ian Rak at. 95
 11.   Zaman Baru (New Season).   Zaman Baru is published as a
 weekly in Surabaya by the Peoples Cultural League (Lembaga
 Kebudajaan Rekjat - LEKRA), a communist front organization.   The
 weekly is available in Java and Sumatra and in July 1953 its
 circulation was reported as 5,000. 96/

 III,   FRONT ORGANIZATIONS*
 The PKI, in its endeavor to win converts and support from
 all sectors of the population, has organized special groups to
 appeal to these sectors.   The front organizations are affiliated
 with the PKI and most have representatives on the plenos of the
 party at all levels, which coordinate party and front group
 activities.   In addition PKT party fractions in all major front
 groups at both the national and local level ensure control and
 direction from above.   In preparation for the forthcoming
 elections members of the front organizations are being encour-
 aged to join the PKI itself.
 The composition of the party fraction in the organizations,
 or the extent of its influence, is not always known to members
 of the host organization, particularly if the organization is
 not under party control or is not usually associated with the PKI.
 The most important of the front groups are in the fields of
 labor, agriculture, veterans affairs, youth, culture and peace.
 A.    Central Organization of Trade Unions for all Indonesia
 fSentral Organisasi Buruh Seluruh Indonesia - SOBSI)
 SOBSI is the largest and most powerful of the PKI front
 organizations.   It is the largest labor federation in Indonesia
 and is composed of 37 vertical unions and 139 local unions
 directly affiliated with the central organization. 97/  Member-
 ship estimates and claims range from 800,000 to more than 2,500,000.
 The most commonly accepted figure is slightly less than 1,000,000.
 SOBSI is a member of the Communist-controlled World Federation
 of Trade Unions (WFTU) and is usually represented at WFTU con-
 ferences. 98
 Among the most important components of SOBSI are:
 SARBUPRI (Sarikat Buruh Perkebunan Republik
 Indonesia, Union of Estate Workers
 of the Republic of Indonesia)
 SBKA (Sarikat Buruh Kereta Api, Railroad
 Workers Union)
 SBPP (Sarikat Buruh Pelabuhan dan Pelajaran,
 Dockworkers and Sailors Union)
 SBKI (Sarikat Buruh Kendaaran Indonesia,,
 Transport Workers of Indonesia)
 PERBUM (Persatuan Buruh Minjak, Oil Workers
 Union)

 Wei WrT000
 Of these SARBUPRI is by far the largest and strongest with
 a membership of approximately 300,000. 99/
 The leadership of SOBSI is vested in the Sentral Biro
 (Central Bureau), with Secretary-General Njono and Deputy
 Secretary-General Munir as the key figures. 100     Both are
 members of the CCPKI Pleno.  Djokosudjono an   erdojo, the SOBSI
 representatives in Parliament, also are members of the CCPKI
 Pleno, 101/ and Djokosudjono is a member of the CCPKI as well. 102
 SOBSI was formed at a preparatory conference in November
 1946 and formalized at the first SOBSI congress, Malang, May
 1947. 103   Although the organization originally contained ele-
 ments of-most political sentiments, SOBSI is now completely under
 Communist control.   Its history is one of an active tool of the
 Communists.  Because of its strength in key fields of the
 Indonesian economy, SOBSI has been able to effectively disrupt
 that economy through strikes.   The union played a minor role in
 the Madiun Affair in 1948 and in the early 1950's engaged in a
 series of strikes in violation of a government ban.   It was the
 1951 series of strikes that caused several Commurist leaders to
 be arrested and others, such as Aidit and Lukman, to flee. 104
 Since goverrments more friendly to the Communists have been In
 power there have been very few SOBSI strikes--a situation likely
 to be reversed if the anti-Communists win the next election.
 Although SOBSI itself has not always been in good financial
 condition, it has been an important source of funds for the
 PKI.  105   To this end it collects funds from its own members
 and mem er crganizations and also from such other front groups
 as the Indonesian Women's Movement. 106    In the past SOBSI has
 received in addition financial assistance from pro-Communist
 Chinese organizations. 107   Expenses of the second SOBSI
 congress, held in January 1955, made special appE!als for funds
 necessary.   The devices used by the PKI, the selling of cards
 and pictures of party and national figures also are used by
 SOBSI. 108/
 The second congress of SOBSI was held in Djakarta 9-23
 January 1955.  At the congress it was stated that SOBSI itself
 would not put up candidates in the 1955 elections but would
 support the candidates of the PKI, some of whom may be SOBSI
 officials.   To bolster election strength all SOBSI members were
 urged to join the PKI.   In addition to the usual Communist
 resolutions condemning capitalism in general and the West in
 particular, SOBSI asked for wage increases and restoration of
 cute in the government workers' traditional Moslem New Year
 bonuses. ldSf The following seven decisions, not publically
 announced;,Arere reported also reached at the January meeting:
 1.   SOBSI will endeavor to avoid strikes and violence
 during the tenure in office of the Ali-Arifin
 cabinet.
 2.   In its propaganda to SOBSI members and the
 public concerning the general elections, SOBSI
 will support PKI candidates and attempt to dis-
 credit candidates of opposition parties.

 3.   SOBSI will instruct all branches that SOBSI
 members should follow the teachings of local PKI
 cadre courses.
 4.   If after the coming elections the PKI is
 unable to secure a part in the government, SOBSI
 branches will hold as many strikes and present
 as many claims as possible against industries
 and firms.
 5.   SOBSI will follow the policies of the WFTU
 and obey its decisions.
 6.   SOBSI will be more active on behalf of the
 peace movement.
 7.   In the event of war between the Communists
 and the Capitalists, SCBSI wi11 call strikes in
 all foreign-owned enterprises. 110/
 The role of SOBSI in Indonesian Communism is second only
 to that of the PKI.   With increasing PKI fractions in SOBSI
 unions, and increased co-membership in SOBSI and PKI by both
 leaders and members, it may soon be difficult to draw a clear
 line of demarcation between the two units.
 B.     Union of Former Armed Combatants of Indonesia (Persatuan
 Bekas Pedjuang Bersendjata Seluruh Indonesia - PERBEPBSI)
 A PKI front organization rapidly growing in size and
 importance,  the Union of Former Armed Combatants of Indonesia
 (PERBEPBSI) reportedly had a membership of 205,000 in November
 1954. 111    The organization, according to its revised by-laws
 of 195T,-is composed of "157 former combatant organizations
 throughout Indonesia and was formed between 23 and 30 December
 1951 with the charter of the organization." 112    It is directed
 by the Dewan Pimpinan Pusat (Central Governing council), which
 is headed by General Chairman Supardi, First Deputy Chairman
 K. Utomo and Second Deputy Chairman S. Mustaman. 113
 PERBEPBSI is composed mostly of veterans of the anti-Dutch
 wars.    General Sudirman, late chief' of staff of the Indonesian
 Army and national hero of these wars, is considered to be the
 organization's hero and in honor of him the group refers to
 itself as "Sons of Sudirman." 114/  There have been many reports
 that the organization is an ac  ve armed force.   One' report of
 late October 1954 states that it has cached materiel for 50,000
 men and that Iwa Kusumasumantri, the pro-Communist minister of
 defense, has promised additional materiel support. 115/.
 In its early days PERBEPBSI posed as an organization of
 veterans seeking economic and other aid for veterans.  Working
 through a government bureau similar to the Veterans Administration
 in the United States, PERBEPBSI was able to secure funds to set
 up many of its members in businesses which served the double
 purpose of earning money for the individuals and the organization,
 and acting as subsidiary overt organs of PERBEPBSI.  116/ Some
 financial assistance also has been received from pro-75mmunist
 Chinese groups. 117/

 Finances have been a source of internal struggle, and many
 leaders have been accused of embezzling organization funds for
 personal use. 118    Strict disciplinary procedures, however, have
 quelled most oe internal friction.
 In its activities the organization supports the PKI.   It
 advocates the PKI "line."  Supporting PKI demands for action
 against the Darul Islam, PERBEPBSI has offered military aid to
 the Indonesian government for such action.   It also has offered
 to keep order during the forthcoming elections. 119
 PKI control of PERBEPBSI is maintained through a PKI
 fraction directly under the supervision of Sakirman of the PKI
 Politburo.  Members of this element include PERBEPBSI General
 Chairman Supardi, First Deputy Chairman Utomo, S. Utarjo,
 Mohammed Amin and Mohammed Said. 120   Individual sub-units of
 PERBEPBSI also are controlled by      fractions under the secoms
 and provcoms. 121
 C.    Indonesian Farmers Union (Barisan Tani Indonesia - BTI)
 The chief PKI front organization for work among the peasant
 classes of Indonesia is the Barisan Tani Indonesia (BTI), formed
 shortly after World War II as a non-partisan organization, it has
 undergone many changes--groups breaking away and other joining.
 In September 1953 another large peasant organization, the
 Indonesian Peasants Foundation (Rukun Tani Indonesia - RTI)
 merged with the BTI to form a single large Communist front group.
 At the "fusion congress," as the September 1953; conference was
 called, some non-Communist elements were expelled. 122
 The leading figures in the BTI--which has made membership
 claims varying from 150,000 to 350,000--are Sardiono, the
 secretary--general; Hartojo and Subroto, deputy secretaries-
 general; and S.M. Tarigan, who holds a post in the Indonesian
 Ministry of Agrarian Affairs. 123   Sardjono a--so represents
 the BTI on the CCPKI Pleno.   2
 The organization's principal aim is to win peasant support
 for PKI agrarian policies.  For this purpose the BTI is organ-
 izing units throughout the country, giving special attention to
 such predominantly agricultural areas as North Sumatra, East Java
 and Borneo.  So extensive is the organization of the BTI that it
 has a representation in the Indonesian Parliament--currently
 Sardjono and Subroto.  Tauchid, who was expelled at the time of
 the RTI-BTI merger, formerly represented the BTI, giving it
 three seats.  After his expulsion he kept his seat but switched
 his affiliation to the Gerakan Tani Indonesia, a rival group. 125
 The ]3TI is actively preparing for the forthcoming elections.
 Many BTI officials were originally listed under the hammer-and-
 sickle emblem, which at first designated PKI and non-party
 candidates but later was limited to the PKI.   PKI fractions
 within the BTI have been active in recent months in attempting
 to persuade all BTI members to join the PKI as well. 126
 Because of the importance of the agrarian population, the
 BTI has become one of the most important front groups of the PKI.

 D.    People's Youth (Pemuda Rakjat)
 Shortly after the end of World War II a leftist youth
 group was formed under the name of Socialist Youth of Indonesia
 (Pemuda Sosialis Indonesia - PESINDO).   At its third conference
 in November 1950 the name was changed to People's Youth (Pemuda
 Rakjat).   This organization is the link representing Indonesian
 youth in the chain of Communist front organizations.   Its rules
 limit membership to youth of both sexes between the ages of
 14 and 30. 127/
 The Pemuda Rakjat states its aims in the same terms as
 do Communist youth groups throughout the world--peace, anti-
 fascism, anti-colonialism,  promotion of the rights of youth.   It
 is a member of the World .Federation of Democratic Youth (WFDY),
 having taken over the membership of the Badan Kongres Pemuda
 (Organization of Youth Congresses) in 1951. 128/  Since then
 Pemuda Rakjat has had representatives at all  mi portant con-
 ferences of the WFDY and the International Union of Students
 'IUS).  129    In December 1953 Sukatno,  secretary-general of
 Pemuda   a jat, was named a member of the Executive Council of
 the WFDY and Baharuddir, assistant secretary-general, was named
 to the WFDY General Council.  130/  Hamzah Surjono is the
 permanent Pemuda Rakjat delege#e to the WFDY Secretariat in
 Budapest. 131/
 In all its activities the Pemuda Rakjat works closely with
 the PKI and other Communist front groups, such as SOBSI and the
 BTI,   In late 1953 Setiadi,  then secretary-general,  reportedly
 represented Pemuda Rakjat on the 1CPKI Pleno.   Possibly Sukatno,
 current secretary-general,  is now sitting on the Pleno in his
 place.  132/
 There is no accurate information on membership of the Pemuda
 Rakjat.   Estimates have ranged from 15,000 to 150,000.  133   Most
 reliable estimates are closer to the lower figure.  Branc es are
 spread throughout the country, and in the past the organization
 has acted for the PKI in areas where no organized PKI unit
 existed.   It is among the most important PKI front organizations.
 E.    Indonesian Women's Movement (Gerakan Wanita Indonesia -
 GERWANI)
 The leading pro-Communist women's organization in Indonesia
 was formed in 1950 as the Public-Spirited Indonesian Women's
 Movement (Gerakan Wanita Indonesia Serban - GERWIS).   It dropped
 the words "Public-Spirited" at a March 1954 congress of the
 organization.  134/  Although at its start its membership was
 only about 2,0D  or 3,000, estimates place current strength at
 more than 25,000. 135/
 The organization is directed by its Central Executive
 Council (Dewan Pimpinan Pusat - DPP).   Mrs.  S.K.  Trimurti was
 listed as general chairman in May of 1954, and Mrs. Umi Sardjono
 as chairman. 136/  Both women have been active and prominent in
 the movement s nce its inception.   Other prominent figures
 include Mrs. Suharti and Mrs. Mudigdo.  Mrs. Mudigdo is a member
 of the PKI fraction in the Indonesian Parliament, a former
 member of the PKI Central Committee and is the mother of Mrs.
 D.N.  Aidit, wife of the PKI secretary-general.

 GERWANI is affiliated with the international Communist
 front organization for women's groups, the Women's International
 Democratic Federation (WIDF). 137/  In association with this
 membership GERWANI has invited-3e-legates from other" member
 organizaticns to its congress in Indonesia and has in turn been
 invited to send representatives abroad to other national
 congresses as well as to WIDF functions. 138/
 GERWANI participates in all PKI activities.   It runs a
 cadre course for PKI women and contributes to the party
 coffers. 1=;     Its financial situation, however, has not always
 been satis'3actory.   In September 1953 GERWANI failed to contri-
 bute her usual monthly sum of R25,000 to the SOBSI treasury for
 eventual turnover to the PKI and asked for financial assistance
 from the General Association of Overseas Chinese Groups (Chung
 Hua Ch'iao T'uan Tsung Hui - CHCTTH), the leading pro-Communist
 Chinese federation in the country and often financial rescuer
 of the PKI and its affiliated groups. 140/  The only subsequent
 report on' GERWANI finances was in Marc1 ?954, i'; discussed the
 necessity of raising funds for the congress held at the end of
 the month because of GERWANI financial difficulties.
 Current activities include support of the PKI in all its
 activities and running candidates for both the Indonesian
 Parliament and the Constituent Assembly under tie PKI symbol. 141/
 F.    People's Cultural League (Lembaga Kebudajaan Rakjat - LEKRA)
 Available reports on the People's Cultural League do not
 show a date of formation, but it is known to have existed before
 February 1951.   LEKRA is the cultural front organization of the
 PKI devoted ostensibly to the propagation and preservation of
 the culture of the nation, but in fact primarily to art,  litera-
 ture and culture of a leftist nature.   Among the media used for
 the dissemination of LEKRA material are the Zam.an Baru and the
 Harian Rak'~at, for which LEKRA composes a cultural page once a
 week. 172/
 LEKRA is active in other Communist front activities also.
 It sent a nine-member delegation to Bucharest in July 1953 for
 the Third World Youth Congress. 1431  In August 1954 it joined
 with Communist front groups in Medan to form a Committee for the
 Protection of the Rights of Youth.   The founding meeting was
 held inpERBEPBSI headquarters in Medan. 144/
 Officials of LEKRA reported in mid-1952 were: 145
 Chairman - Hardjito
 Secretary - M. Hamid
 Treasurer - Sobron Aidit
 (brother of D.N. Aidit,
 PKI secretary-general)
 A June 1953 report listed the following councillors of the
 organization, probably supplementing to the above list rather
 than replacing it:. 146

 This report stated that the councillors of the organization have
 direct access to LIANG Shang-yuan, cultural attache of the
 Chinese Communist Embassy in Djakarta, who would provide an
 excellent channel for Chinese Communist propaganda to the
 Indonesian people.
 Although LEKRA is one of the smaller front groups and
 perhaps less known than most of the other fronts, it is an
 important cog in the PKI machinery.
 G.    Committee for World Peace (Komite Perdamaian Dunia)
 The Indonesian Committee for World Peace, an affiliate of
 the World Peace Council (WPC), is also known by such other names
 as the Indonesian Peace Council and the Komite Pembela Perdamaian
 Dunia untuk Indonesia (Indonesian Committee for the Defense of
 World Peace).   It was established F July 1950 as an outgrowth of
 several smaller local peace groups in the country, 147/ which it
 now serves as headquarters.   Its earliest office was-That of a
 SOBSI-affiliated union and its meetings were held in the SOBSI
 headquarters building in Djakarta.   The first officers of the
 group were Islan and Mrs. Kartowijono.  148/
 The Committee for World Peace is one of the many PKI front
 groups.   In the Central Committee Pleno it is represented by
 Njoto, a member of the Politburo.  149/  The Djakarta branch is
 headed by Aidit and Sudisman, also--Politburo members, an indica-
 tion of the i  ortance the PKI gives to this phase of front
 activity.  1507
 The committee is severely handicapped by a shortage of
 funds.   In an effort to broaden the base of support it was re-
 organized with several non-Communists in key positions, in-
 cluding members of the cabinet, members of Parliament and other
 leading officials such as the mayor of Djakarta. 151
 In January 1954 the committee held its first national con-
 ference in Djakarta, inviting members of the World Peace
 Council.  152/  It sent delegates to the meeting of Asian-Pacific
 secretary-generals of the World Peace Council in Peiping in April
 1954 and to the WPC executive session in Vienna in January
 1955. 153    The 1955 session launched a campaign to obtain sig-
 natures on petitions to outlaw atomic war preparations.   A dele-
 gation headed by the committee's chairman, Purbodiningrat, was
 to attend the Helsinki meeting of the World Peace Council in June
 1955.
 The current leadership of the Committee for World Peace is

 Chairman Purbodiningrat is a university crofessor and,
 before the hammer-and-sickle was dropped as a symbol for non-
 party candidates, appeared on the candidate raster for PKI and
 non-party candidates. 155
 The Committee for World Peace is one of the smaller and
 more poorly organized front groups of the PKI, but nevertheless
 an important front.
 H.    Indonesian Citizenship Conference Organization (Badan
 Permusjawaratan Kewarganegaraan Indonesia - BAPERKI)
 The organization meeting of BAPERKI took place on 13 March
 195+ in the Hsin Ming Hui Building in Djakarta.   Under the
 temporary chairmanship of Thio Thiam Tjong of the Chinese
 Democratic Party of Indonesia (Partai Demokra'; Tionghoa
 Indonesia - PDTI), the meeting was called to :?orm an organization
 to carry out work that the PDTI had been unable to do in its six
 years of existence.   The BAPERKI Constitution described its aims:
 1.   To promote a nation-wide campaign for
 Indonesian Chinese to become legal Indonesian citizens.
 2.   To promote the principles of democracy and
 the rights of man.
 3.   To promote the feeling of equality and equal
 opportunity among citizens regardless of extraction,
 cultural background, customs and religion. 156/
 The organization was declared open to all, but was primarily
 aimed at the more than 2,500,000 Chinese residents of Indonesia.
 Despite the tone of its stated goals, the organization is but a
 tool of the PKI.   Evidence of Communist control can be found in
 the affiliations of many of the officers, notably of Chairman
 Siauw Giok-tjhan and Treasurer Ang Jan-goan. 157/  Siauw was
 formerly the editor of the Harian Rakjat, theWI daily, and its
 leading financial backer.   Ang is affiliated with the leading
 pro-Communist Chinese organizations in Djakarta. 158
 BAPERKI announced that it would enter candidates for the
 1955 parliamentary elections in an effort to obtain full citizen-
 ship for Indonesian Chinese.   In preparation, as well as to
 propagate its aims, BAPERKI is establishing branches through-
 out Indonesia. 159/
 Six months after the organization of BAPERKI an official of
 the Indonesian Ministry of Interior reported--y stated that the
 organization was losing strength and was no :.onger a significant
 political force.   The validity of this statement has not been
 confirmed. 160

 IV.   RELATIONS WITH OTHER COMMUNIST GROUPS
 Since the PKI's early relations with Dutch Communist groups
 (see Part I), the Indonesian party has had contact with other
 Communist parties throughout the world and with international
 Communist organizations.   The previous chapter has discussed
 to some extent PKI front organizations' membership in world-wide
 Communist counterparts.
 While there is no doubt that contact exists between the
 PKI and other parties, reports of the immediate channel for the
 PKI's directions from the world Communist hierarchy and of its
 paths of communication vary widely.
 A.    The USSR
 Two recent statements by PKI leaders portray opposite views
 on relations between the PKI and Russia.   On 21 February 1955,
 in an article in Harian Rak at, PKI Deputy Secretary-General
 Njoto.stated, "We will remain in allegiance to the Soviet
 Union....   Socialism without proletarian dictatorship is just
 nonsense." 161    Four days later in Keng Po PKI Secretary-
 General Aid                           stated, "The Indonesian Communist Party does not
 follow in Moscow's steps.   It follows a nationalist policy....the
 Communist Party agrees with the Parliamentary system."   He also
 said that he could not see any possibility of war between
 Indonesia and the Soviet Union. 162/  While it would appear that
 there is considerable disagreement-between the two statements,
 some background information serves to clear the air.   At the
 time Aidit was still on trial for insulting Vice-President Hatta,
 a charge on which he was convicted.   Moreover, Njoto's statement
 had caused some furor in the local anti-Communist and neutralist
 press.   Aidit's statement appears, therefore, to have been made
 (a) to calm the furor caused by Njoto's statement and (b) to
 give Aidit the appearance of being a nationalist first and a
 Communist second.   In actuality there seems to be little doubt
 of PKI allegiance to Moscow.
 PKI contact with-Russian and international Communism has
 a long history.   When some of the early PKI leaders were forced
 to flee Indonesia in the 1920's, several went to Moscow.   One
 of them, Semaun, is still there as an employee of Radio
 Moscow. 163   Musso was also in Moscow for many years, serving
 for a period as a member of one of the Comintern's executive
 bodies.  When he returned to Indonesia in 1948 he came from
 Moscow, with a new program for the PKI as well as instructions
 and criticisms from above.   Significantly, he arrived one month
 before the Madiun Affair. 164
 Until 1954 there was no Soviet Embassy in Indonesia.   Since
 Indonesian leaders did not travel much in Europe (although many
 minor officials attended various front meetings and Aidit and
 Njoto were in Europe for a short time in 1953, other channels
 of communication were necessary.   Four major channels have been
 suggested and possibly all were in use at one time or another:
 (1) the Australian Communist Party;  (2) the Soviet Embassy in
 Bangkok;  (3) the Chinese Communist Embassy in Djakarta and (4)
 George Afrin, TASS correspondent.   In the past such international

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 front organizations as WFTU and the World Peace Council have
 served as instruction channels and may also serve the same
 function for the PKI.
 The Soviet Embassy in Bangkok and George Afrin seem to be
 the most probable points of contact.   There is little to support
 the Australian channel.   The Chinese Communist Embassy's role
 would depend on any Sino-Soviet agreement on a sphere of influ-
 ence in Indonesia or the entire Far East.   The Peiping Embassy
 undoubtedly has a green light from Moscow in dealing with the
 overseas Chinese in Indonesia.   Its jurisdiction over the PKI,
 however, is doubtful.   Conjectures were made when Aidit took
 control of the PKI from Alimin that it was the result of a
 struggle between Moscow and Peiping oriented groups, the Peiping
 faction losing.
 Since 1 September 1954 an official Soviet diplomatic mission
 has been in Indonesia.
 1.   Contact through the Australian Communist Party
 Reportedly there has been long contact between the
 Australian and Indonesian Communist Parties, although little
 tangible evidence is available.   Laurie Aarcns, the second
 highest figure man in the Australian Communist Party, was an
 honored guest and speaker at the PKI Congress of March 1954 and
 mentioned the long friendship of the two parties. 165    In
 response M.H. Lukman, who holds the same position  n the PKI,
 attended the Australian party congress in October 1954. 166
 Other evidence of close contact between the two parties I's scanty
 except for occasional travelers, and no evidence that the
 Australian party was being used to pass instructions to the PKI
 from Moscow exists.  Analysts who believe that it was the link
 usually speculate that it was used to prevent the Chinese
 Communists from seizing direct control of the PKI.
 2.   Contact through the Soviet Embassy in Bangkok
 The Soviet Embassy in Bangkok appears to be one of the most
 logical channels for the PKI before the opening of the Russian
 Embassy in Djakarta; it was the nearest official Russian instal-
 lation to Djakarta, and entry into and exit from Thailand are not
 difficult.   In May 1954 Soffian Nur, a PKI leader and active
 organizer of PERBEPBSI, was reported traveling to Bangkok to
 contact the Soviet Embassy there.   He also was described as a
 means of PKI contact with the Malayan Communist Party and as an
 alleged member of that party.  He is reported to have used the
 name of Lubis in Singapore and to have been an unofficial TASS
 representative in Indonesia. 167    The latter statement is
 significant in view of specula  on that George Arifin, TASS
 correspondent, was also an official contact man.
 Contact through the Chinese Communist Embassy
 in Djakarta
 Conjectures on the use of the Chinese Communist Embassy in
 Djakarta as a channel of communication are based on four points:
 (1) Alirlin, former head of the PKI, spent several years in
 54

 Peiping and was an admirer of Mao and of Chinese Communist
 methods;   2  Aidit and Lukman fled to Peiping to avoid arrest
 in 1951;  (3) Formal contact between the PKI and the Chinese
 Embassy has been carried on at Politburo level; and (4) funds
 to aid the PKI and its various front groups have come from pro-
 Communist Chinese organizations in ")Jakarta and, reportedly,
 directly or indirectly from the embassy.
 These points show a close relationship between the PKI
 and the Chinese Communists, although they do not necessarily
 indicate a channel of communications or a chain of command.
 4.   Contact through a TASS Correspondent
 George Afrin has been the leading TASS correspondent in
 Indonesia almost continuously since the end of World War II.   He
 has made trips home to Russia but he has always returned.   He
 has kept in close contact with PKI and front group leaders, and
 his profession has facilitated his traveling throughout Indonesia
 and the Far East.  Observers of Indonesian affairs have strongly
 suspected that he was the main channel of communications before
 the opening of the Soviet Embassy. 168/  One American correspond-
 ent who spent many years in Indonesia said that most newsmen in
 Indonesia considered Afrin to be the channel.  169
 B,    Communist Party of China and Indonesian Chinese
 Official contact between the PKI and the Chinese Communist
 Embassy and pro-Communist Chinese organizations in Indonesia
 is carried on by Sudisman, a member of the PKI Politburo. 170
 Significantly, Sudisman is also the treasurer of the PKI a_nCT_
 these Chinese organizations are an important source of revenue
 for the party. 171
 Since the Communist victory in China much of the propaganda
 material arriving in Indonesia has come from Peiping, not only
 for the use of the overseas Chinese but for Indonesians as well.
 In the field of mass organizations, Peiping is the Far East
 headquarters for some of the world-wide Communist organizations,
 such as WFTU and the World Peace Committee.
 Through all these channels, and through PKI leaders who
 visited China,  Peiping has been endeavoring to influence the PKI.
 It is not clear, as yet, whether the ouster of Alimin will
 greatly affect relations between the PKI and Peiping.   Nor is
 it clear how the opening of the Soviet Embassy in Djakarta may
 affect relations.  Relations between Peiping and the overseas
 Chinese are still close and probably will remain so.   Through
 such organizations as BAPERKI Peiping may be able to enter and
 influence the PKI via the back door.
 C.    Philippine Communist Party (PKP)
 There have been reports that the PKI maintained contact
 with Luis Taruc,  the recently convicted leader of the Philippine
 Communist Party (PKP).   One report stated that this contact was
 maintained through Zailani of the PKI Central Committee.  172/

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 Others have stated that contact is made through the open mails
 via Medan or via courier through Borneo.   Although Indonesian
 mail is censored, a PKI man in the post office is believed to be
 intercepting PKI mail before censorship. 17/    The PKI is not
 believed to be giving any directions to tfie PKP, although it may
 have served as a courier for someone else.
 D.    Malayan Communist Party (MCP)
 Several different versions of the method used to maintain
 contact between the PKI and the Malayan Communist Party (MCP)
 have been reported.   One late 1954 report was that the only
 contact is through Sarwono S. Sutardjo, a PKI member of the
 Indonesian Parliament.   His chief point of contact was said to
 be a Malay named Mustafa who was given a position in the
 Indonesian attorney general's office through the intercession of
 SutardJo. 174
 Most of the other reported mail and courier contacts between
 the PKI and MCP pass through Medan, including the same mail
 channels mentioned for the PKP.  175   Chinese and Malayan
 couriers reportedly operate between Medan and Malaya. LL 6/
 Nur, of PERBEPBSI, has been reported to be one courier
 and a member of the MCP, allegedly under the alias of Lubis. 177
 PERBEPBSI also has been reported working closely with the Malayan
 Races Liberation Army (MRLA), the Communist army of Malaya. 178
 E.    Other Foreign Communist Parties
 The usual Communist amenities are exchanged between the PKI
 and other foreign Communist groups.  On the occasion of
 congresses, liberation days, birthdays or deaths of leaders, the
 traditional messages of greetings or condolences are sent.   The
 issue of Bintang Merah for the March 1954 party congress con-
 tained several pages of greetings from Communist parties in the
 free world and behind the Iron Curtain.  Delegates also have been
 exchanged for such affairs in the past.  In general, friendly
 relationships are maintained with every party meeting the approval
 of the Cominform.
 F.    Partai Murba
 T:me Partai Murba (Proletarian Party), often called a
 Trotskyite or a national Communist party, which grew out of a
 split between Tan Malaka and the PKI, is one of the few Communist
 parties in the world not on friendly terms with the PKI.
 Although many attempts have been made to heal the rift, partic-
 ularly since the death of Tan Malaka, these have not been suc-
 cessful.
 The bitterness and rivalry between the two parties has led
 to exchange of many strong propaganda attacks.   The two most
 common charges are that (1) the other party is sabotaging the
 revolution and (2) that the other party is pro-Dutch--the two
 severest charges that one Indonesian Communist can levy against
 anothe:fw.   In April 1954 the Partai Murba, led by Kobarsih, a
 Partai Murba member of Parliament, made the following criticism
 of the PKI:

 1.   The PKI is not opposing fascism, imperi-
 alism and capitalism since it has joined the Partai
 Nasional Indonesia (PNI) in supporting the present
 government.
 2.   Since the PKI has thus compromised with
 capitalism and imperialism, it has disqualified
 itself as the true representative of the proletarian
 masses.
 3.   The PKI is playing politics for its own
 interest to the detriment of the proletarian move-
 ment.
 4.   The PKI is anti-religious.
 5.   Partai Murba asks why the PKI does not
 include patriotism and liberty in its united front
 slogan of communism, socialism and nationalism.  179/
 Kobarsih also attacked the PKI as "genuine imperialists
 utilizing Communist slogans to brink back Dutch imperial powers
 to Indonesia." 180   The Murba charge opened with the statement:
 In connection with the efforts of certain parties
 to equate the Murba Party with the PKI, presently
 led by Aidit, and to protect the good name of the
 Murba Party, it is stated that:   the Murba Party's
 policy is a policy which is consistently revo-
 lutionary and that continuously and fully opposes
 every policy of opportunism s-ich as Linggadjati,
 Renville, RTC* and any other policy which compro-
 mises with imperialism-capitalism.  181/
 These attacks and the attitudes of the current leaders make
 it unlikely that the two parties will resolve their differences
 for some time.   Partai Murba is by far the weaker party and any
 merger would be an absorption of Murba by the PKI.
 *The Linggadjati, Renville and Round Table Conference agreements
 were three agreements between the Netherlands and Indonesia to
 end hostilities and establish the Dutch-Indonesian Union.

 APPENDIX A
 CONSTITUTION OF THE COMMUNIST PARTY OF INDONESIA (PKI) 182
 The Indonesian Communist Party (PKI) is the best organized
 front line and highest form of class organization of the Indo-
 nesian proletariat.   The PKI represents the interests of the
 Indonesian nation and People.   In its present stage, it fights
 for the establishment of a People's Democracy system in Indonesia,
 while its further aim is the realization of a Socialist society
 as the first step toward a Communist Society in Indonesia.
 The entire work of PKI is based upon the theories of Marx,
 Engels,  Lenin, Stalin and the Thoughts of Mao Tse-tung and the
 Great Corrections of Musso.  The PKI fights against every thought
 that is not critical,  and opposes dogmatism and empiricism.
 Based on dialectical materialism and Marx's historical material-
 ism, the PKI critically accepts the teachings of Indonesian
 history as well as foreign history and opposes the views of world
 idealism or mechanical materialism.
 Since Indonesia is a semi-colony and semi-feudal;  since the
 generating forces of the Indonesian Revolution are the laboring
 class,    the peasantry,  the petty bourgeoisie and other democratic
 elements which suffer under imperialism; since there is already
 a Communist Party in Indonesia, which has become increasingly
 stronger and more influential; and because of the present
 international conditions; all these determine that the Indo-
 nesian Revolution, in its present stage, is a new type bourgeois-
 democratic revolution or a bourgeois-democratic revolution in
 a period of imperialism and of world proletarian revolution.
 The Indonesian Revolution in its present stage is a People''s
 Democracy revolution,  that is,  the revolution of the masses of
 the people, under the leadership of the proletariat, and is
 directed against imperialism,  feudalism and the bourgeois
 comprador class.   The Indonesian Revolution has many allies
 within the country and abroad.   Therefore,  the duties of the
 PKI at the present stage are:    at home--to organize and unite
 labor,  the peasantry,  the intellectuals, small traders,  national
 entrepeneurs,  citizens of foreign descent,  all national clans
 (tribes) and all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal elements;
 externally--to be united with the international proletariat,
 with all oppressed nations,  subject nations, and nations, which
 consider us their equals, which love national freedom,    democracy
 and world peace.  All these are for the advancement of Indonesia
 from a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country to a free country,
 that is, democratic prosperous and progressive, to replace the
 government of feudal lords and compradors with a people's
 government,  a People's Democracy government.   A People's
 Democracy government is a government which bases itself on the
 masses,  a united national front government that is formed on
 the basis of the alliance between labor and the peasantry
 under the leadership of the laboring class.    In view of the
 backwardness of our country,  this People'"s Democracy govern-
 ment will not be a dictatorship of the proletariat, but a
 dictatorship of the people.   It will not carry out socialist
 changes, but will carry out democratic changes.   A People's
 Democracy government is a government which is able to unite
 all anti-feudal and anti-imperialist forces,  and which is able
 to give lands at no cost to the peasantry,  to guarantee demo-

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 cratic rights and freedom of religion to the people; it is a
 government, which is able to defend national industries and
 commerce against foreign competition, and able to raise the
 material living standard of labor and abolish unemployment.
 In short, a People's Democracy government is a People's govern-
 ment that is able to guarantee national freedom and development
 through democracy and progress.
 Further, when the Indonesian Revolution which is charac-
 teristically national and democratic has already fully achieved
 its victory, PKI's duty will then be to take the necessary
 steps to realize the system of socialism as the first step
 towards a Communist order in Indonesia, in ac,lordance with the
 needs of social and economic developments in Indonesia and in
 accordance with the wishes of the Indoneisan People.
 Semi-colonial and semi-feudal Indonesia is a vast group
 of islands with an unequally distributed large population,
 which consists of several clans with different stages of
 social progress.  On one hand, the masses of Indonesian People,
 especially the laboring class and the peasantry, have a heroic
 revolutionary tradition; on the other, there are very great
 obstacles that hamper revolutionary progress.   These factors
 determine the uneven developments of the Indonesian Revolution,
 cause the revolution to take a longer period of time and cause
 it to have strange characteristics.
 The herioc struggle of the Indonesian People has been
 demonstrated in their resistance against Dutch rule in the
 Bantam War, Timor War, Tondano War, Diponegoro War, Ambon War,
 Buginese War, Bondjol War, Palembang War, Bandjar War, Achin
 War, Batak War, Lombok War and others, the people's uprising
 of 1926, the "Seven Provinces" revolt, the reoistance against
 Japanese fascism, among others in Blitar and Singaparna and
 the resi:3tance against the Madiun provocation.  The August
 1945 Revolution and the fights against the Dutch colonial wars
 are the pinnacle of a heroic struggle which established a very
 extensive and intensive revolutionary tradition upon the entire
 People of Indonesia.  But the August 1945 Revolution was a
 failure, primarily because the mass of the'millions of peasants
 had not been awakened and drawn into the revolution, and also
 due to the betrayal by the comprador bourgeoisie.  The laboring
 class at that time was not conscious enough of its role as
 leader of the revolution -- the Communist Par-;y of Indonesia
 as a proletarian class party had already lost its freedom in
 the fields of politics:, ideology and organiza,;ion.  The PKI at
 that time did not sufficiently understand the particular
 character of the Indonesian Revolution and did not sufficiently
 understand the facts of the united national front.
 The work of the Party is now hard and unique.         The problems
 that we directly and at once come face to face with are the
 the problem of fostering a united national front based on an
 alliance of labor and the peasantry and the problem of building
 up the Party.  Therefore, work among laborers and peasants is
 the most important and basic form of activity of the Party.
 Party members must lead actions which directly concern the
 interest of the masses, continuously, untiringly and system-
 atically give explanations to the public (laborers, peasants,
 soldiers,  intellectuals,  small businessmen,  national entrepeneurs
 and other democratic groups) so that they can be separated from
 the comprador bourgeoisie and landlords, which are closely
 connected with the imperialist powers.   The Party wounds
 resulting from past Party mistakes and from the Madiun provoca-
 tion must; be quickly healed, so that the Party may be able to

 Approved For Release 1999/08/24: CIA-RDP78-02646R000300150001-8
 continue to keep its independence in the fields of politics,
 ideology and organization, order that it may realize the lead-
 ing role of the labor class  in the united national front, and
 to be able to strengthen the united national front in general.
 Keeping in mind the particular characteristics of the Indonesian
 Revolution,  the PKI,  in the long course of the revolution, must
 possess sufficient courage, toughness,  experience and skill in
 the mobilization and organization of the millions of people,
 must be able to overcome all difficulties and obstacles and
 keep itself away from possible trouble so that it can advance
 towards its aims,  and, at the same time,  it must relentlessly
 steel its own ranks.
 In the revolutionary struggle, the PKI must endeavor to
 become the hub of all revolutionary mass organizations.  The
 PKI must also carry out a fight which knows no mercy against
 activities inside and outside the Party,   that are aimed at
 destroying the revolution by dividing the unity of the working
 class and the alliance between the revolutionary classes.
 For the growth of the Party and the strength of the In-
 donesian Revolution, the PKI must carry out a merciless fight
 inside and outside the Party against"leftist opportunism" and
 "rightist opportunism".   A struggle that consumes a long period
 of time can generate the danger that the theoretically weak
 and characterless members may resort to politics of capitula-
 tion and adventurism.   Experiences in the Indonesian Revolution
 show that the diseases of opportunism,  capitulation and
 adventurism are dangerous enemies of the revolution.   In order
 that it may stay stable and strong,  the PKI must carry out a
 positive struggle that knows no mercy toward these dangerous
 elements, and those who do not want to correct their mistakes
 must be expelled from the Party.
 The PKI may not conceal mistakes and shortcomings in its
 work.   It must continuously check on its mistakes and short-
 comings by the exercise of strict; criticism and self-criticism,
 in which manner it can make timely corrections and can educate
 its members and cadres.   The PKI opposes arrogance,  self-
 rightiousness toward mistakes and fear of criticism and self-
 criticism.
 The Indonesian Communists must  sacrifice all their
 energies and thoughts to serve the People.   They must establish
 extensive contacts with the masses of labor and peasantry and
 all the other revolutionary people and devote continuous atten-
 tion to strengthen and spread out these contacts.   Every Party
 member must understand that the interests of the Party are the
 same as those of the People,  and that responsibility to the
 Party is the same as responsibility to the People.   Every Party
 member must pay the closest attention to the voice of the People,
 understand their urgent needs and help them organize themselves
 to fight for their needs.   Every Party member must constantly
 be prepared to learn from the masses of the People, and at the
 same time be tirelessly and constantly prepared to educate the
 People in the revolutionary spirit to awaken and advance their
 consciousness.  The PKI must be convinced that it is dangerous
 to be separated from the People.   It must constantly watch,
 prevent and overcome the existence of tailism,  commandoism,
 closed door  olitics, politics of isolationism,  "Bapakism"
 (paternalism),  individualsim,  liberalism, bureaucracy,  intrigue,
 cliquism and militarism;  all of which alienate the Party from
 the masses.

 The PKI is organized on the basis of democratic central-
 ism as a united and militant organization, steeled with disci-
 pline that is based on consciousness, which applies to all its
 members
 The strength of the PKI lies in its strong solidarity,
 its unity of will and its unity of action.  No action can be
 tolerated which deviates from the Constitution and the Program
 of the Party, the tampering with Party discipline, and allows
 for autonomyism, factionalism or hypocrisy.  The PKI must
 constantly guarantee that any member who undermines the Party
 Constitution, the Party's Program and discipline is at once
 expelled from the Party.
 The PKI hopes that every member works actively and is
 prepared to sacrifice militantly for the realization of the
 program and decisions of the Party to achieve freedom and
 prosperity for the Indonesian nation and People.
