CHINESE COMMUNIST CAPABILITIES AND PROBABLE 
COURSES OF ACTION THROUGH 1960 
THE PROBLEM 
To estimate: (a) the political, economic, and military strengths and weak-
nesses of Communist China; (b) Sino-Soviet relations; and (c) Chinese Commu-
nist courses of action through 1960. 
CONCLUSIONS 
1: The Chinese Communists have firmly 
established their control throughout 
mainland China, and are energetically 
attempting to reorganize economic and 
social institutions and build military 
power along the lines of the Soviet model. 
With Soviet help, the armed forces have 
been greatly strengthened and to a large 
extent modernized, and economic output 
has for the most part reached or sur-
passed previous peaks. As a result of its 
achievements and growing power, Com-
munist China's prestige and influence in 
Asia have greatly increased. (Paras. 
10-12) 
2. The Chinese Communist regime is 
determined to convert its primarily agri-
cultural economy into an industrialized 
Soviet-style state. To this end it has 
scheduled large investments over the 
next few years and, to mobilize resources 
for the program, has taken measures to 
restrain consumption and to step up its 
program for socializing agriculture. In 
pursuit of its goals, the government will 
encounter serious problems in the lack of 
trained personnel, in peasant resistance 
to government control, and in growing 
apathy or opposition among the people to 
the regime's austerity measures. More-
over, as Peiping confronts these problems 
and attempts to deal with the difficulties 
of socialization, shifts in the influence of 
leaders may occur and purges may be 
expected, especially at lower levels. How-
ever, we believe that Peiping's control 
apparatus will be adequate to maintain 
the stability of the regime. (Paras. 29-
30, 33-34, 45, 94) 
3. We estimate that by 1957 the Chinese 
Communists will attain many of the goals 
of their first Five Year Plan, which 
emphasizes heavy industry, though there 
will be shortfalls in steel, pig iron, trucks, 
petroleum products, and food crops. (See 
table and note on page 12.) They will 
probably not be able to develop cer-
tain of their planned capacities. The 
gross value of industrial output will prob-
ably increase about 75 percent during the

Plan period as against the goal of 98 per-
cent. By 1960 the Chinese Communist 
industrial base, which in 1952 was less 
than one-third that of Japan and pro-
duced only a limited range of manufac-
tured goods, will have greatly expanded, 
though production in key industries will 
still be well below that of Japan in 1954. 
Communist China will still require con-
siderable Bloc assistance to meet its 
economic needs. We believe that agricul-
tural output will increase by about 10 
percent instead of the 23 percent planned 
by the Chinese Communists but that this 
will not necessarily affect their industrial 
goals. However, should agricultural out-
put fail to make this limited increase, 
industrial goals will almost certainly be 
adversely affected. (Paras. 42, 59, 92, and 
Chart II, page 9.) 
4. Communist China, with extensive So-
viet aid, will have further strengthened 
and modernized its armed forces by 1960. 
In the absence of extensive US counter-
action, Peiping will retain the capability 
to overrun South Korea, Taiwan, and 
mainland Southeast Asia. However, 
Communist China will still suffer from 
military weaknesses, particularly air de-
fense deficiencies and lack of an adequate 
indigenous armaments base. We have 
no evidence that Communist China pos-
sesses any nuclear weapons, and it has 
only a primitive nuclear research capa-
bility. However, if the USSR were to 
provide the necessary equipment and 
technicians, the Chinese Communists 
could in a short time achieve the capa-
bility to use nuclear weapons. (Paras. 
91, 93) 
5. The relationship between Communist 
China and the USSR has become one of 
an alliance bound together not only by 
NO0014' 2 
ideological ties, but by common hostility 
to the US, military interdependence, and 
the mutual advantages of concerted dip-
lomatic and "revolutionary" activities. 
Peiping's military and economic depend-
ence on the USSR will cause it to con-
tinue to give Moscow's views great 
weight on major questions of global pol-
icy. However, Peiping's tactical position 
in many areas gives it considerable poten-
tial for influencing Moscow. Although 
potential conflicts of interest exist, we 
believe that common objectives and mu-
tual advantage, and Peiping's continuing 
dependence on Moscow, will serve to pre-
vent any significant weakening of Sino-
Soviet ties at least through 1960. (Paras. 
95, 98-100, 102-103) 
6. Chinese Communist foreign policy will 
continue to be focused on gaining control 
of Taiwan, reducing Western (and espe-
cially US) influence in Asia, and extend-
ing their own in the area. Peiping will 
continue to pursue policies emphasizing 
political rather than military action as 
long as its objectives are acceptably 
served by this means. The major factor 
in this consideration will be their esti-
mate of the risk of US military counter-
action; thus Communist China will 
probably emphasize political action over 
the next two or three years. The Com-
munists may again resort to military 
action at any time they estimate that 
the benefits to be obtained will outweigh 
the military consequences of such action. 
In behalf of the joint Sino-Soviet policy 
of "competitive coexistence with the capi-
talist bloc," Peiping is likely to play up to 
neutralist and nationalist sentiment in 
Asia, manipulate the Indochina and Tai-
wan issues to divide the West, and exploit 
such vulnerable situations as ROK-Japa-

nese and Indian-Pakistani tensions to 
win further Asian support for the Bloc. 
The Chinese Communists will probably 
endeavor to have their approach to inter-
national problems characterized as 
conciliatory and flexible, but Bloc policy 
will probably permit no major concessions 
to the West and its Asian allies. At times, 
in fact, Peiping will probably assert its 
power ostentatiously, but within the gen-
eral limits of Bloc strategy, in order to 
reaffirm its particular claims and preten-
sions. (Paras. 105-106, 112-113) 
7. The Chinese Communists will prob-
ably continue their buildup in the area 
opposite Taiwan and the offshore islands 
in order to increase pressure on the US 
and Nationalist positions. They probably 
do not intend to attack Taiwan so long 
as the US maintains its commitments to 
the Nationalists, but they may expect to 
induce a gradual erosion of the Nation-
alist position. Moreover, unless Peiping 
comes to believe that it can obtain the 
offshore islands by negotiation, it will 
almost certainly conduct probing opera-
tions against them. If the Chinese Com-
munists became convinced that the US 
would not assist in defense of the islands 
with its own forces, or react in strength 
elsewhere, they probably would attempt 
to seize them. Should Peiping's forces 
successfully occupy the Nationalist-held 
offshore islands without incurring US 
military retaliation, there would be an 
intensification of the campaign to obtain 
Taiwan. (Para. 119) 
8. Peiping will continue its efforts, in con-
junction with the Hanoi regime, to ex-
pand Communist influence and control 
in South Vietnam by attempting to dis-
credit and undermine the authority of 
the Diem government through propa-
ganda and diplomacy. Even if the Viet 
Minh are delayed in extending their con-
trol over South Vietnam, Peiping will 
probably not encourage the Viet Minh to 
renew open hostilities. However, at some 
point Peiping probably will encourage 
increased Viet Minh guerrilla activity in 
South Vietnam. Actions beyond that 
phase would probably depend upon the 
effectiveness of Diem's counteraction and 
the response of the US and the SEATO 
powers. (Para. 121) 
9. The possibility of a Communist-ini-
tiated war in the Taiwan Straits, Viet-
nam, Laos, and even Korea will continue 
to exist. Moreover, Peiping would almost 
certainly react with force if Communist 
control of North Korea or North Vietnam 
were seriously threatened. It would al-
most certainly retaliate to any sharp in-
crease in the level of Nationalist attacks 
against the mainland. (Para. 116) 
DISCUSSION 
10. The basic objectives of the Chinese Com-
munists appear to be: (a) to develop a Soviet-
style state in China with a strong industrial 
economy and a modern military establish-
ment; (b) to eliminate Western (and espe-
cially US) influence and power and to achieve 
dominance in East Asia; (c) to establish con-
trol over Taiwan and other areas which they 
regard as traditionally Chinese; (d) to achieve 
recognition as a major world power; and (e) 
in general, to promote the goals of interna-
tional communism. 
11. Since its formal establishment in Peiping 
in 1949, the Communist regime has shown 
flexibility, skill, and ruthless determination

siomedbadogrsok 
and has made significant progress toward the 
achievement of its goals. Its authority is 
firmly established and its control effective 
throughout the mainland area. War-torn and 
neglected industry and communications were 
largely rehabilitated by 1952, production in 
most important sectors has reached or sur-
passed prewar peaks, and socialization on the 
Soviet model is well advanced in all fields 
except agriculture and retail trade. The 
armed forces have made great progress in 
the evolution from lightly armed formations 
to well-organized regular units with modern 
Soviet equipment. 
12. The regime has also greatly enhanced the 
influence and prestige of Communist China 
in Asia. Its power and ability to influence 
Asian developments were demonstrated in 
Korea and Indochina. Its stature among 
Asian states has been enhanced by its skillful 
diplomacy at Bandung and by the establish-
ment of contact with the US on the ambassa-
dorial level. Strong pressures have developed 
in the Free World for a reduction of controls 
on trade with Communist China and for its 
entry into the UN. Meanwhile, the Sino-Soviet 
alliance has given Peiping considerable stra-
tegic security and access to the material re-
sources of the Bloc, both of which have greatly 
reduced Peiping's vulnerability to non-Com-
munist pressures. 
13. However, during the period of this esti-
mate Peiping almost certainly will not sus-
tain the momentum of its first five years. The 
Chinese Communists have only recently come 
to grips with the basic problems involved in 
the creation of a socialized national economy, 
and these will be difficult to resolve even with 
the benefit of Soviet experience. 
I. DOMESTIC PROBLEMS 
14. The Chinese Communists define the pres-
ent stage of their internal development as 
"the transition to socialism." While they are 
relying on Soviet experience, their tactics con-
tinue to be modified by Chinese Communist 
experience and by flexibility toward groups 
which they regard as basically hostile. Pei-
ping has sought to utilize the party's monop-
oly of power and the state's direct control of 
4 
economic key points to coerce the remaining 
private producers of goods and services into 
accepting socialist economic forms. Periods 
of pressure and social change have been fol-
lowed by brief respites. This tactic of "ten-
sion and release" has been applied in recent 
years both to unnerve the populace and to 
destroy whatever cohesiveness and independ-
ent leadership the intellectuals, private entre-
preneurs, and well-to-do peasants may have 
possessed. 
Political Situation 
15. The government of Communist China has 
recently been reorganized, with control fur-
ther centralized in Peiping. Although the 
constitution of September 1954 vests formal 
governmental responsibility in the National 
Peoples' Congress, this body is primarily a 
forum for publicizing already decided policy. 
Between the infrequent sessions of the Con-
gress, most of its functions are exercised by 
its Standing Committee. The Standing Com-
mittee has nominal supervision over the State 
Council, which in turn directs all the central 
government ministries, including the Ministry 
of Defense, and supervises the operation of 
provincial and local governments and the gov-
ernments of "autonomous" minority areas. 
(See Chart I, page 5.) 
16. Party Leadership. The Chinese Commu-
nist party dominates and controls the gov-
ernment structure. Although we have little 
information on the distribution of power with-
in the party, the supremacy of party chair-
man Mao Tse-tung appears absolute. Mao is 
Chairman of the party Politburo and of the 
Secretariat of the Central Committee, as well 
as formal head of the government. 
17. Mao's position under the new constitution 
requires a less active role in the formal direc-
tion of governmental affairs, and important 
areas of influence appear to have been dele-
gated to other leaders. Liu Shao-chi, who 
ranks next to Mao in the party hierarchy, 
seems to control the party organization; Chou 
En-lai, who ranks third in the Politburo, has 
become the dominant figure in government 
administration and foreign affairs; and Chen

executive and appointive powers. 
Official Communist commentators have described Mao's 
office as being a "symbolic" one, and have stated that 
the chairman and the standing committee constitute a 
"collective head of state?suggesting that the formal 
rank of Liu Shao-chi in the governmental hierarchy is 
virtually equal to that of Mao.

Yun seems to have the largest role in economic 
affairs. Although Chu Teh is a venerated 
military leader and Vice Chairman of the 
"Peoples Republic of China," he is nearly 70, 
and Peng Te-huai, newly appointed as Minis-
ter of Defense, has assumed active leadership 
of the armed forces. 
18. The first high-level party purge since 1938 
took place during 1954 when Kao Kang, state 
planning chief and sixth-ranking member of 
the Politburo, and Jao Shu-shih, party or-
ganizational chief, were removed from the 
party and imprisoned together with a num-
ber of their associates. Kao's death has since 
been announced, but Jao's fate is unknown. 
Kao and Jao had both been veteran members 
of the Central Committee and had been the 
ranking party leaders in Northeast and East 
China respectively until 1953. 
19. While the actual details of the Kao-Jao 
affair still remain shrouded in mystery, the 
chief reason for the purge was probably an 
effort by Kao, Jao, and their supporters to 
broaden their own power. Despite official de-
nials, some differences over issues of domestic 
policy may have been involved. Kao and Jao 
may also have attempted to make common 
cause with some of the military leaders, but 
apparently with little success, since no rank-
ing military men have yet been involved in 
their disgrace. 
20. In any event, there is no evidence that 
the purges have had any lasting effect on the 
stability of the inner core of party leadership 
or its ability to control the party. Simul-
taneously with the purge announcement in 
April 1955, the party announced a new con-
trol commission to check on party discipline. 
As the regime confronts the problems of so-
cialization, shifts in the influence of leaders 
may occur and purges may be expected, espe-
cially at lower levels. 
21. The question of Mao's successor will grow 
in importance since Mao is now 62 and pos-
sibly in poor health. It is doubtful if any 
individual in the event of Mao's death would 
be in a position for some time to assume 
the full authority held by him, and an effort 
would probably be made to establish some sort 
of collective leadership. 
6 
22. Liu and Chou would probably be in the 
best positions to bid for pre-eminence. Liu, 
second only to Mao in formal party listings, 
is known as a theorist whose attention has 
been largely focused on internal party mat-
ters. Chou has had a broader range of expe-
rience and contacts and has a reputation for 
tactical elasticity. However, their expressed 
views on major policies have not been in con-
flict. Barring any major setbacks to the re-
gime, the differing backgrounds of these and 
other leaders appear more likely to serve as 
complementary forces in implementing agreed 
policy than as causes of serious conflict. 
23. Although the prestige of the army and 
the role of its leaders remain great, the direct 
role of the army in planning and policy has 
been steadily curtailed, particularly since the 
dissolution of the regional governments in 
1952-1954. The newly created National De-
fense Council appears to be largely an ad-
visory body less powerful than its predecessor, 
the People's Revolutionary Military Council. 
Control of most of the internal security forces 
has been taken away from the armed forces 
and placed under the Minister of Public Se-
curity. There appears to be increasing inte-
gration of the civil and military elements of 
the government. 
24. There isArm evidence of actual conflict 
between professional military leaders and the 
primarily political group. It is possible that 
there may have been some sympathy among 
military commanders for the alleged belief of 
Kao Kang that "the party was created by the 
army" and that those with party experience 
in the old revolutionary base areas should 
take precedence over nonmilitary leaders. 
However, the high party status of many mili-
tary commanders gives them a vested interest 
in the regime, and the long established sys-
tem of political officers within the army pro-
vides a constant check on the activities of 
military leaders. We believe that there is 
little prospect of differences which would 
seriously affect the cohesion or stability of 
the regime during the period of this estimate. 
25. The Chinese Communist Party, with a 
membership of over eight million or 1.33 per-
cent of the population, is substantially smaller 
4212101mo,t.

in proportion to population than Communist 
parties in other Bloc countries. Although 
there is no shortage of potential members, 
there is a serious problem in quality and po-
litical reliability. An eight-year program of 
systematic political indoctrination was ini-
tiated in 1955 for some five million party 
members and nonparty intellectuals. Despite 
these efforts to improve the quality of the 
party, governmental efficiency will continue 
to be hampered by low levels of literacy and 
by friction between old revolutionaries and 
new bureaucrats. 
26. Popular attitudes and support. Tight con-
trol and a series of repressive campaigns since 
1951 have dissipated some of the support the 
regime initially enjoyed, leaving much of the 
populace disillusioned or disaffected. Dis-
content mounted during 1954 and civil dis-
obedience at the local level increased. Official 
announcements allege that there were 364,604 
cases of "subversion" and "economic sabotage" 
from February 1954 to May 1955. These ac-
tivities occurred in both urban and rural 
areas throughout Communist China. The 
principal causes appear to have been local 
food shortages resulting from the floods and 
droughts of 1954, the pushing of grain col-
lection and agricultural socialization, and the 
forced austerity program. Discontent seems 
to be particularly marked among the peas-
antry, and at least one open "peasant revolt" 
is admitted to have taken place in April 1955. 
27. Communist efforts to remold the tradi-
tional Chinese social system have also met 
with considerable resistance. Their attempts 
to destroy family proprietorship and family 
cohesion have generated widespread resent-
ment. The regime has slackened its efforts 
to enforce its marriage law, and reform of the 
family is now being attempted primarily by 
the indoctrination of youth. 
28. Chinese intellectuals, many of whom have 
been educated in the West or exposed to 
Western thought, also pose a serious problem 
to the regime, which is still dependent on 
their skills. The campaign to obtain their 
conformity was accelerated in May 1955 when 
Hu Feng, a writer who pressed for greater 
freedom of expression, was accused of leading 
a vast conspiracy against the state. Abject 
confessions by intellectuals were published 
and mass meetings were organized to de-
nounce and expunge "the remnants of Hu 
Feng thought" in such widely diverse fields as 
medicine and plant management. 
29. At present, popular discontent is too spo-
radic and disorganized to pose a serious threat 
to the stability of the Peiping regime. The 
recent emphasis on security and the height-
ening of vigilance during the past year may 
have been partly intended to provide a ra-
tionale for continued austerity and stringent 
economic controls by creating an atmosphere 
of fear and tension. The regime now has a 
large and effective control system, including 
an internal security force of about 500,000 
men in addition to the army. At the local 
level, a system of "security defense commit-
tees," "urban residents' committees," and 
other mass organizations provides additional 
controls which extend into every street and 
small community. As the process of socializa-
tion progresses over the next five years, popu-
lar discontent, particularly in rural areas, is 
almost sure to increase. However, the regime 
will almost certainly be able to repress such 
discontent. 
The Economy 
30. The Peiping regime has stated that the 
creation of a modern, industrialized economy 
will, despite maximum efforts, require the rest 
of the century. It regards this development 
as essential to the transformation of Com-
munist China into a great power. To this 
end, it is seeking to create an economy which 
will eventually be capable of providing a full 
range of military and capital goods, and which 
would reduce Communist China's dependence 
on the USSR. The Chinese Communists be-
gan in 1951 to develop a Five Year Plan for 
channeling their resources to the development 
of industry, especially heavy industry. 
31. The years 1950-1952 were a rehabilitation 
period during which the regime was able to 
obtain with relatively small investments a 
substantial increase in output and generally 
to raise production levels to or above pre-
Communist peaks. However, even after the 
-vigtowm,

COW IDL" " 
rehabilitation period the industrial base re-
mained extremely small. In 1952 Communist 
China produced no trucks, tractors, automo-
biles, or airplanes; only an insignificant num-
ber of such important items as locomotives, 
electric motors, and turbines; and only a small 
number of the simplest types of machine tools. 
Its output in the basic steel and electric power 
industries was only about one-sixth that of 
Japan. Moreover, while the Chinese Commu-
nists have tremendous human resources and 
substantial power and mineral resources with 
which to build a strong industrial base, the 
quality and utility of these resources are lim-
ited. Some 80 percent of the people are illit-
erate and about 80 percent are peasants or 
live in backward rural communities. Com-
munist China has one of the greatest land 
areas in the world, but only about 10 percent 
is under cultivation and almost all the re-
mainder is unsuitable for cultivation. It has 
substantial mineral resources, but since many 
are of poorer grades or in areas distant from 
railroads and industrial centers, their devel-
opment and processing will be very costly. 
32. Finally, the regime is faced with the seri-
ous long term problem of stretching its limited 
resources to meet the requirements for capital 
investment and the minimum needs of a pop-
ulation which is growing at a rate estimated 
to be at least 1.5 percent annually. In mid-
1953 the population was recorded at 582.6 
million in an official census, and it will prob-
ably total some 650 million by 1960. 
33. The Five Year Plan. In mid-1955 the 
regime, after considerable delay,. adopted a 
comprehensive Five Year Plan (1953-1957). 
(See Chart II, page 9, for major goals.) The 
Plan is fairly rudimentary, modifications have 
been introduced since its publication, and fur-
ther modifications can probably be expected. 
Even though the Russians have given exten-
sive technical assistance, the Chinese Commu-
nists admittedly have encountered great diffi-
culties in drafting their plan. Its delayed an-
nouncement was officially attributed to the 
lack of resource data, difficulties in the collec-
tion of statistics, lack of skilled personnel, and 
inexperience in handling the problems arising 
out of rapid development. 
8 
34. The Plan calls for a total state economic 
and social expenditure of 76.64 billion yuan 
($32.8 billion) .1 Funds for capital construc-
tion, i.e. investment in fixed assets, amount to 
42.7 billion yuan ($18.1 billion) and are to be

35. The main investment effort is being made 
in heavy industry. To support the industrial 
program, the regime plans substantial ex-
penditures on transportation and, to a lesser 
extent, on health, education, and other social 
projects. To achieve its goals in the other ma-
jor sectors - agriculture, light industry, and 
trade - the regime apparently plans to rely 
chiefly on organizational changes and, in the 
case of agriculture, on stimulated investment 
by the peasant and the cooperatives. 
36. Basic to the fulfillment of program goals 
will be the regime's ability to control the dis-
position of Communist China's economic re-
sources, particularly those in agriculture. To 
this end, the "transition to socialism" has been 
entered into aggressively. State-controlled 
cooperatives in agriculture, trade, and credit 
have been organized, and most of modern

industry2 has been nationalized. A hard line 
has been adopted toward the consumer, and 
strict control measures, including forced grain 
procurement, control of cotton production, 
and food rationing have been instituted. 
37. The regime appears to have based its in-
vestment plan on a realistic appraisal of its 
control of mainland economic resources and 
of the availability of Soviet credits. Between 
1950 and 1955 it appears that GNP increased 
by over one-half in constant prices, while 
budgetary revenues more than tripled and 
reached one-third of the GNP. The most sub-
stantial increases in revenues reflected "prof-
its" from nationalized enterprises. However, 
the regime's future program through 1960 
appears to contemplate a much slower rise in 
the GNP and budgetary revenues, though they 
will continue to increase relative to GNP, will 
do so at a slower rate. (See Chart III, page 
11.) 
38. According to Chinese Communist budget 
data, defense and economic construction have 
accounted for about 70 percent of total ex-
penditures each year. However, the propor-
tion devoted to each of these categories has 
been almost exactly reversed during the past 
five years. In 1950, defense accounted for 42 
percent and economic construction 26 per-
cent; in 1955 defense accounted for 24 percent 
and economic construction 48 percent. De-
spite the percentage decline, budgeted military 
expenditures in 1955 were at the highest level 
since the regime gained power. The main-
tenance of military expenditures at the cur-
rent proportion of the budget would appear to 
be consistent with the planned rate of eco-
nomic growth. 
39. The industrial outlook. During the first 
Five Year Plan, the Chinese Communists plan 
to concentrate on developing the capacity and 
production of heavy industry. Consumer 
goods industries are to receive only about 11 
percent of the total industrial capital con-
"Modern industry" is used by the Chinese Corn-
munists to mean factory and mine production, 
largely exclusive of the output of handicraft in-
dustries. 
10 
struction funds. The 156 industrial projects 
for which the Soviets have announced that 
they will supply equipment and technical 
guidance constitute, in cost, nearly half of the 
industrialization program. Almost all are in 
heavy industry and have been assigned top 
priorities in the supply of domestic resources. 
While planned targets in other sectors may 
undergo subsequent major revisions, this por-
tion of the Plan is the least likely to be 
changed substantially. 
40. Although most of these 156 projects will 
not be completed during the first Five Year 
Plan, and some of the most important will 
not be completed until after 1960, the follow-
ing descriptions of certain planned major 
developments in heavy industry are given for 
illustrative purposes. The heavy industry 
program calls for major construction in the 
Anshan iron and steel complex and the ini-
tiation of construction of large iron and steel 
combines in the Wuhan area in central China, 
and at Paotou in Inner Mongolia. Only the 
first stage of development of the latter two 
projects will have been completed by 1962. 
By 1957 the Chinese Communists also plan to 
complete their first aluminum plant (except 
for a small pilot plant built by the National-
ists) and to double power generating capacity 
over 1952. 
41. We believe the Communist control of the 
industrial sector of the economy is sufficiently 
well developed to insure that whatever re-
sources are available will be directed to heavy 
industrial projects. About 60 percent of in-
dustrial output comes from nationalized in-
dustries, and the regime directly controls 
another 20 percent through cooperatives or 
joint public-private .industries. Through the 
placing of orders, control of banking, raw ma-
terial allocation, and product distribution, the 
government effectively controls the output of 
the remaining privately owned sector. Only 
in the case of the individual handicraft enter-
prises, which engage about 10 million people 
full-time, has the extension of state control 
been delayed. During the period of this esti-
mate, the regime will almost certainly further 
extend its control over industry.

ESTIMATED CHINESE COMMUNIST PRODUCTION OF SELECTED COMMODITIES 
FOR 1954, 1957, AND 1960 
NOTE: The figures in this table should be used with caution. The estimates are subject to varying mar-
gins of error, some of which might be considerable. The 1954 estimates for certain of these commodities 
should probably be regarded as a maximum, particularly for pig iron and crude steel, with respect to 
which production in the quantities stated is predicated on maximum utilization of all possible facilities. 
The estimated production of industrial products, as projected for 1957 and 1960, depends upon construction 
or improvement of capacity, the assimilation of advanced techniques by the Chinese Communists, the 
continuance of Soviet Bloc aid, and continued importation of capital goods from the West at approximately 
present levels. 
With the exception of pig iron, steel, trucks, and food crops, our estimates of 1957 production are of the 
approximate order of magnitude of the Chinese Communists' goals. With respect to crude oil and gaso-
line, while production estimates are presently under revision, we believe that the Communist goals are 
overly optimistic. The specific goals of the Five Year Plan are given in parentheses.

42. We believe that the Chinese Communists 
will not achieve some of the specific industrial 
goals of the Five Year Plan, particularly in 
pig iron, crude steel, trucks, crude oil and 
gasoline, and advance machine fabricating. 
They will probably not be able to develop cer-
tain of their planned capacities. The regime 
has not been able to maintain the planned

lit 
rate of investment in fixed assets, and 48 per-
cent remains to be made in the last two years 
of the Plan period. Furthermore, unit costs 
for new plant construction have been exceed-
ing estimates, and further sharp economies 
will have to be effected if planned investment 
is to prove adequate to realize construction 
goals. Moreover, because of a probable over-
statement of output of light industries in 
1953-1954, we believe that the planned rate 
of increase of production in light industry is 
inadequate to realize the planned level of out-
put of consumer goods in 1957. Unless the 
regime is successful in increasing the produc-
tion of cotton and other commercial crops, 
it will probably also fall short of some of its 
consumer goods industry goals. We believe 
that the gross value of industrial output will 
increase about 75 percent during the first Five 
Year Plan rather than 98 percent as planned 
by the Communists. 
43. The growth of output has, in many in-
dustries, been accompanied by high costs of 
production, deterioration of quality, and a 
limited range of products, resulting in high 
prices for industrial goods, shoddy merchan-
dise, and overproduction combined with 
shortages in various industrial lines. These 
conditions reflect the deficiencies existing in 
skills, plant, and materials at current levels 
of production, and the limited flexibility of 
Chinese Communist industrial output. In 
view of the present official pressure to expand 
the volume of output, we believe problems of 
waste will continue to plague the regime for 
many years to come. 
44. Manpower problems. The labor force is 
believed to total around 300 million, which 
would include around 95 percent of the males, 
and 65 percent of the females over 14 years 
of age. The nonfarm labor force numbers 
only about 60 million, of whom approximately 
4 million are government employees, 3 million 
are in the army and security services, 19 mil-
lion are employed by business and industrial 
enterprises, and the remainder are self-em-
ployed in trade, services, and handicraft in-
dustries. Some 16 million of the nonfarm 
labor force are directly employed by the State 
in the military, government administration, 
13 
and economic enterprises. The regime claims 
that 5.9 million of the factory workers are 
currently employed in the industrial sector, 
an increase of more than 4 million since 1949. 
45. Despite such basic problems as control of 
its huge population and of underemployment, 
the regime's most pressing manpower prob-
lem is a shortage of trained managerial and 
technical personnel. The Communists tend 
to complicate this problem by seeking to in-
sure political reliability as well as technical 
competence in their trained personnel. 
46. The Chinese Communists are continuing 
their efforts to overcome shortages of trained 
personnel by employing many thousands of 
Soviet advisors and technicians. Many of 
these teach in universities and in training pro-
grams connected with factories or with specific 
development projects. Under the Five Year 
Plan, Peiping is sending 10,000 students and 
11,300 skilled workers to the USSR for train-
ing. Most important, the regime has sought 
to expand the educational system and concen-
trate student interest in technical subjects. 
The speed-up has produced poorly trained 
engineers, and there are still too few qualified 
secondary school graduates to satisfy the 
needs of the economy and the growing capac-
ity of higher educational facilities. Peiping 
now recognizes the need for more thorough 
training, and has adopted the Soviet five-year 
curriculum in most technical fields beyond 
the secondary school level. 
47. Although at both secondary and higher 
levels of education a considerable percentage 
of graduates will be drained off to staff the 
expanding educational system, large numbers 
of reasonably well qualified graduates will 
eventually be available to help the regime 
carry out its programs. We estimate that by 
1960 Communist China will have 750,000-
800,000 college graduates, an increase of more 
than 450,000-500,000 over 1952. The recent 
development and planned expansion of the 
educational system may be seen in the follow-
ing estimated enrollment figures, derived in 
large part from Chinese Communist an-
nouncements:

48. Scientific research activity in Communist 
China is at a very low level. The basic policy 
for utilizing Communist China's limited po-
tential in the scientific field has been to con-
centrate on training and on technical activity 
related to industrial expansion. While re-
search activity will probably increase slowly, 
scientific research and development will prob-
ably not make a very significant contribution 
to the Communist Chinese effort to attain 
economic and military self-sufficiency during 
the period of this estimate. 
49. Despite the expansion in education, Com-
munist China will continue during the period 
of this estimate to experience deficiencies in 
skilled labor and management and in trained 
technicians. These deficiencies will be re-
flected in errors, waste, and losses in produc-
tion, and will be a limiting factor in Chinese 
Communist progress toward Plan goals. How-
ever, it is unlikely that the shortage of skilled 
personnel will cause a major setback in the 
program. 
50. Agricultural outlook. Around 250 million 
acres, some 10 percent of Communist China's 
land area, is under cultivation. Although the 
Chinese Communists claim that another 10 
percent of their land is arable, this figure is al-
most certainly too high. In any event, the 
bulk of such land would require extensive irri-
gation or would be relatively unproductive be-
cause of short growing seasons, poor soils, or 
low rainfall. Counting double-cropped acre-
age, the total area under crops is the equiva-
lent of 330 million acres, of which 300 million 
acres are in basic food crops and 30 million 
acres are in technical and other miscellaneous 
14 
crops. In addition Communist China has 
large grazing areas which are not efficiently 
utilized, and extensive fresh water fishing and 
coastal fishing grounds. Communist China 
has largely been deforested. However, the 
timber reserves in northern Manchuria and 
Inner Mongolia are believed to be adequate 
to meet requirements beyond the period of 
this estimate, although their remoteness pre-
sents difficult transport problems. 
51. In the crop year 1954-1955, we estimate 
that the Chinese Communists produced about 
158 million tons of basic food crops and about 
1 million tons of cotton, as against Chinese 
Communist claims of 170 and 1.1 million tons 
respectively. These crops plus fish, livestock, 
and other technical or commercial products, 
provided the Chinese people with a bare sub-
sistence standard of living, and the bulk of 
the raw fibers for the domestic production of 
clothing. Nevertheless, the Chinese Commu-
nists exported about $1 billion worth of agri-
cultural commodities which accounted for 
about two-thirds of total Chinese Communist 
exports in 1954. 
52. The regime was faced with a tremendous 
problem in establishing control over the mil-
lions of individual peasants. Since agricul-
tural products directly or indirectly provide 
the major source of capital, the regime has to 
obtain a maximum contribution from the 
peasant to support its industrialization pro-
gram. 
53. During the period while it was still con-
solidating its control, the regime sought to 
maximize its take from the peasant primarily 
by taxes and marketing policies. In 1953, the 
regime increased its pressure on the peasants. 
Compulsory sales to the state were imposed, 
accompanied by a continuation of a nation-
wide campaign to form mutual-aid teams in 
order to pool labor and equipment on a sea-
sonal basis. By the end of the year about 
one-half of the 110 million peasant households 
had been organized into such groups. These 
teams were presented to the peasants as a 
method for increasing output by mutual self-
help, but to the regime they represented the 
first step toward agricultural socialization.

*Veni=k047*4' 15 
54. Pressure on the peasants increased still 
further in 1954 and in the spring of 1955. 
Compulsory sales quotas went up. Mass or-
ganization of small producers cooperatives 
(in which land, equipment, and labor are uti-
lized collectively though private land owner-
ship is retained) began, and by the spring of 
1955 the Communists announced that some 
15 percent of peasant households had been 
organized into 670,000 cooperatives. However, 
there was some uncertainty in agricultural 
policy. Thus in 1955, the regime, as a result 
of peasant resentment to increased forced 
sales in a poor crop year, fixed the quota at 
the 1954 level for a three-year period. At the 
same time, some 20,000 of the new coopera-
tives were disbanded because of poor adminis-
tration, too hasty organization, or member 
noncooperation. 
55. The period of ambiguity in agricultural 
policy was apparently ended in July 1955, 
when Mao called for accelerated socialization 
and castigated those who had urged a slower 
pace. He attributed the difficulties in sociali-
zation to errors in implementation. He urged 
reliance on energetic leadership to induce 
peasant cooperation and recommended the 
dispatch of several thousand cadres from the 
administrative centers to supervise rural 
cadres in setting up cooperatives. 
56. Mao outlined a time-table under which 
half of the rural population would be organ-
ized in cooperatives by the spring of 1958. 
Some of the cooperatives are to be consolidated 
into larger units by this time. All of the farm 
population is to be integrated into at least 
small cooperatives by 1960. Mao stated, how-
ever, that agriculture would not be fully col-
lectivized until the mid-1970's. 
57. The regime has probably accepted the po-
litical and economic risks of relatively rapid 
socialization in agriculture both because of 
doctrinal compulsions and because of the 
practical need to control production sufficient-
ly to meet industrial raw material, export, and 
urban consumption requirements. Taxes and 
forced sales imposed on individual peasants 
apparently could not -perform this task. The 
regime appears to believe that, contrary to 
Soviet and Satellite experience, socialization 
can be accomplished without adverse effects 
on production. 
58. The Five Year Plan calls for a minimum 
of central government investment in agricul-
ture. Only about 1 billion yuan or 2 percent 
of capital construction will be allocated direct-
ly to agriculture, with some portion of another 
6.6 billion yuan having indirect benefits to 
agriculture through flood control, reclama-
tion, and other projects. The largest invest-
ment in agriculture wil be by the peasants 
themselves. The Plan calculates peasant in-
vestment for the five-year period at 10 billion 
yuan for new tools, replacement of fixed assets, 
and expendable assets such as seeds and fer-
tilizers. The regime intends to undertake 
such low cost programs as the distribution of 
disease resistant seeds, insect control, double 
cropping, planting of high yield crops, and ex-
panding the use of natural fertilizers. In 
addition, the regime intends to manufacture 
new-type farm implements, to increase sup-
plies of chemical fertilizers, and to make 
modest increases in acreage under cultivation 
and irrigation. 
59. We believe that the Chinese Communists 
will not achieve their major agricultural goals, 
particularly in basic food crops. Although 
the regime is planning to achieve a 23 percent 
increase in total agricultural production dur-
ing the Five Year Plan period, we believe it 
will be doing well to exceed a 10 percent in-
crease. In basic food crops, we believe the 
Chinese Communists will increase production 
over the Plan period by about 6-8 percent 
rather than the 18 percent they are seeking. 
This failure to achieve planned goals will be 
the result of a number of factors the most 
important of which are: the regime will prob-
ably not be able to insure that the peasants 
make the investment expected of them; gov-
ernment investment will be probably inade-
quate; and the collectivization program will 
probably have a depressing effect on produc-
tion. 
60. The estimated increase in food output ap-
proximates the estimated population growth, 
but since agricultural exports constitute less 
than 3 percent of total farm output, the re-
rnairinrnrrl A

gime can probably meet its export goals, the 
proceeds of which are vital to the industrial 
program, though this might require further 
squeezing of domestic subsistence levels. 
Therefore, failure of the regime to achieve its 
agricultural production goals by the margin 
indicated will not necessarily affect its in-
dustrial goals. However, the regime will be 
handicapped by its inability to employ ma-
terial incentives to obtain planned increases 
in productivity and continuing rapid urban 
growth, where costs and standards of living 
are higher, may make it difficult to restrain 
rises in consumption. Moreover, should farm 
output fail to make the limited increases we 
have estimated, industrial goals would almost 
certainly be adversely affected. 
61. Outlook in. transport facilities. Commu-
nist China lacks country-wide modern trans-
port facilities. A rail net exists in the indus-
trial areas of Northeast China and railroads 
extend to almost all other industrially de-
veloped sections of the country. In most other 
areas, primitive forms of transport are relied 
upon to meet distribution needs. A rough 
measure of the state of transport facilities in 
Communist China is apparent from a com-
parison with India:

62. However, Chinese Communist railroads, 
on which the industrial sector of the economy 
primarily depends, apparently have been able 
to meet the growing military and economic 
requirements. Based on estimated produc-
tion figures3 and estimates of percentages of 
production carried by rail, we believe that ap-
proximately 144 million tons of such bulk 
commodities as coal, construction materials, 
food crops, timber, and ferrous metals would

have been moved by rail in 1954. In addition 
to the foregoing, the railroads almost cer-
tainly transported substantial quantities of 
other goods such as machinery, military 
equipment, POL, and consumers goods. It 
should be noted that large quantities of heavy 
bulk cargo, such as coal, were moved relatively 
short distances.4 
63. Existing rail facilities were used to near 
maximum capacity. The Chinese Commu-
nists have apparently attained a considerably 
higher level of car utilization than is current 
in US practice and slightly above that attained 
by the USSR. In so doing, rolling stock was 
probably overloaded and undermaintained, 
with reserves apparently cut to a minimum, 
although the Communists have increased the 
capacity of rolling stock repair and manufac-
turing facilities. 
64. The Chinese Communists claim that the 
extensive inland water system carried 20 mil-
lion tons in 1954 by modern waterway trans-
port exclusive of junks. It is estimated that 
river junks carried a large portion of the 
nation's total freight in 1954, particularly in 
the Yangtze and Pearl River systems. Inland 
waterways, although not fully exploited, are 
a major transport facility for bulk traffic. 
Only a small portion of the rudimentary road 
net is of all-weather type. Roads provide im-
portant support for the area opposite Taiwan 
and the main support for economic develop-
ment in the northwest. Civil air transport is 
The Director of Intelligence, USAF, and the 
Deputy Director for Intelligence, The Joint Staff, 
do not believe that there is sufficient intelligence 
to estimate with accuracy the tonnage carried 
by Chinese Communist railroads. Fragmentary 
and often ambiguous Chinese Communist an-
nouncements indicate that the railroads origin-
ated tonnages as high as 150 to 180 million 
metric tons in 1954. However, rail operational 
intelligence as interpreted by the Director of 
Intelligence, USAF, and the Deputy Director for 
Intelligence, The Joint Staff, indicates a capaci-
ty in terms of freight cars, locomotives, and 
other facilities sufficient only to originate a 
tonnage of about half this figure or about 80 
million Metric tons. Until better intelligence 
is available, we believe it can only be estimated 
that the actual tonnage originated in 1954 was 
somewhere between these wide extremes.

largely limited to flights between Peiping and 
and a few other cities; the civil air fleet com-
prises some 50 light transports. 
65. The Chinese Communist merchant fleet is 
small and relatively obsolete, and Communist 
China must rely on foreign flag shipping to 
carry all of its overseas trade as well as a 
small but strategically important portion of 
its seaborne coastal freight. Coastal shipping, 
including both inshore junk traffic and ocean-
going freighters, provides the cheapest method 
for moving bulk cargoes between the major 
ports of Dairen, Tientsin, Shanghai, and Can-
ton. However, because of Chinese Nationalist 
operations, all coastal freighters calling at 
ports from Swatow north to Wenchow are of 
non-Communist registry. In the Yellow Sea 
area coastal shipping offers an alternate 
transport facility to ease the pressure on the 
single rail connection between Manchuria and 
North China. Along the southeast coast it is 
the principal means of transport. It is esti-
mated that Chinese Communist registered 
ocean-going coastal shipping (over 1,000 
GRT) carried approximately 87 percent and 
foreign flag shipping engaged in coastal trade 
carried about 13 percent of a total of 6.3 mil-
lion metric tons in 1954. We are unable to 
estimate the tonnage carried by the inshore 
junk traffic.

66. The first Five Year Plan allocates 7 billion 
yuan, or 16 percent of the total investment in 
fixed assets, for transportation, with the ma-
jor share going to railroads. Some 5,800 kilo-
meters of new trunk and branch rail line are 
scheduled for construction during the Five 
Year Plan. (See Map 1, for major projects.) 
In addition, approximately the same amount 
of trackage is scheduled for logging lines, 
spurs, yards, and double tracking. A con-
siderable proportion of this construction was 
probably motivated by strategic as well as eco-
nomic considerations. In addition, the Plan 
calls for a total production of 550 locomotives 
and 33,000 freight cars during the five year 
period. 
67. Plan goals for production of freight cars 
are probably realizable, though there may be 
some shortfall in the locomotive program. 
This production of rolling stock, and the ex-
tent of trackage expansion that is likely to 
be attainable, will probably, unless a substan-
tial proportion of these facilities is diverted 
for purely military purposes, be adequate, or 
nearly so, to support the Chinese Communist 
development program. The Trans-Mongolian 
railroad, with a capacity when fully operative 
of about 2.7 million metric tons each way per 
year, which will probably, go into operation 
early in 1956, will also lessen Communist 
China's present dependence on seaborne trade. 
However, even with this new line the inter-
ruption of seaborne trade would reCluce Com-
munist China's foreign trade sufficiently to

68. Foreign trade and Soviet assistance. 
Communist China is dependent on imports for 
essential elements of its industrial and mili-
tary programs. Fifteen percent, or $2.75 bil-
lion, of capital construction expenditures un-
der the Five Year Plan are allocated for im-
ports of machinery and equipment, while 
expanding industrial output is increasing im-
port needs for raw materials and other pro-
duction requisites. However, except for grants 
and credits supplied by the Soviet Bloc, Com-
munist China's ability to obtain such goods 
is presently limited by its dependence on agri-
cultural exports. Agricultural commodities 
accounted for about two-thirds of total Chi-

nese Communist exports in 1954. Chinese 
Communist ability to trade is also adversely 
affected by the complete closure of the US 
market and by lesser restrictions maintained 
by other Free World countries on exports to 
Communist China. Finally, Bloc markets are 
apparently having difficulties absorbing cer-
tain Chinese Communist exports. 
69. The Chinese Communists announced that 
their total foreign trade in 1954 amounted to 
the equivalent of roughly $3.4 billion. Al-
though they claim that their foreign trade was 
"fundamentally in balance," we believe there 
was probably an excess of imports covered by 
Soviet Bloc credits. While the nature of such 
imports and Soviet property acquired by such 
credits in 1954 is not known, there are indica-
tions that the total value could have been as 
high as $400 to $500 million. 
70. Communist China's trade became increas-
ingly oriented toward the Bloc in 1954. Trade 
with the Asian and European Satellites in-
creased significantly over 1953 levels and re-
mained at approximately the same level with 
the USSR, excluding that covered by Soviet 
credits. Even after taking into account Satel-
lite resales of Chinese Communist goods to 
non-Bloc countries, the Bloc still accounted 
for about three-fourths of Communist China's 
trade. 
71. In 1954 the value of Chinese Communist 
total trade with the Free World was greater 
than in 1952 and probably approximately the 
same as in 1953. However, there were sharp 
increases in trade with Japan and Pakistan. 
The recorded exports of the principal non-
Communist countries to Communist China in 
1954 were:

TOTAL   
272 
The tonnage of Free World exports to Com-
munist China has increased steadily from 
497,000 tons in 1952 to 692,000 in 1953, and to 
858,000 tons in 1954. 
72. The Chinese Communists have stated that 
their foreign trade in 1954 totalled over 9 mil-
lion tons. We believe that this is an incom-
plete figure, and that the total may have 
amounted to between 10 and 11 million tons. 
About 5.1 million tons moved by sea compared 
to 4.8 million tons in 1953. Almost all of Com-
munist China's trade with the non-Commu-
nist countries, and about 25 percent of its 
trade with Bloc countries, was carried by sea. 
The bulk of Communist China's trade with the 
Bloc was carried overland. 
73. To meet requirements of the Five Year 
Plan, the Chinese Communists propose to in-
crease total foreign trade by 65 percent during 
the period, primarily through expanded ex-
ports of minerals, handicraft products, and 
agricultural products. It is estimated that 
Communist China could readily expand its 
exports of coking coal and iron ore (e.g., to 
Japan) without substantial new investment. 
However, Communist China may have trouble 
marketing increased quantities of handicraft 
and higher priced agricultural products to 
Bloc countries because there is a question of 
the ability of the latter to absorb such in-
creases or profitably to re-export them. The 
decline of Chinese Communist exports to the 
Free World has stimulated Free World produc-
tion and use of substitutes for some traditional 
Chinese Communist products. 
74. Although increased trade with the Free 
World would almost certainly develop if pres-
ent trade controls were relaxed to the level 
maintained with the European Bloc, such in-
creases would probably not constitute a sub-
stantial reorientation of Chinese Communist 
trade. Such a relaxation of trade controls, if 
it included those of the US, would not greatly 
increase Communist China's ability to secure 
commodities not now available through trans-
shipment, but would permit an increase in 
exports to markets not now open and would 
reduce import costs on certain items. We be-
lieve that such a relaxation of controls could 
increase Communist China's annual import

capabilities by about $150 million, of which 
about two-thirds would be-due to the reduction 
of US controls. The total of $150 million is 
roughly equal to about a quarter of Commu-
nist China's imports of capital goods, includ-
ing iron and steel, and about 5 to 10 percent 
of the adjusted value of Communist China's 
capital investment program in 1955. To that 
extent, the buildup of Communist China's 
economic and military potential could be ac-
celerated. There would also be a reduction 
in internal Bloc transport costs, amounting to 
approximately $100 million equivalent. It is 
impossible for us to allocate such savings as 
between Communist China and the other Bloc 
countries. A relaxation of controls would in-
crease flexibility in planning, procurement, 
and shipment. However, it probably would 
not result in any significant changes in Com-
munist China's basic foreign or domestic poli-
cies. 
75. Peiping has exploited the issue of trade 
controls to divide the US from its allies and 
has charged that US insistence on controls is 
responsible for economic difficulties in Japan, 
Thailand, the Philippines, and other Asian 
countries. If controls were relaxed, Peiping 
would continue its propaganda campaign 
? against the US, but would seek to expand 
trade contacts with other Asian states, espe-
cially Japan, and would continue to use trade 
as a means of penetration and trade offers as 
an instrument for political warfare.5 
76. An increase in trade controls on Commu-
nist China alone would probably increase the 
volume of transshipped goods but would not 
appreciably retard Communist China's in-
ternal development. However, if all Western 
countries now applying controls were to apply 
an embargo on Chinese imports similar to 
that now observed by the US, Communist 
China would lose markets now taking almost 
20 percent of total exports. Since Bloc mar-
kets are .not believed to be readily expandable, 
it is probable that Communist China's import 
' capabilities would be reduced proportionately, 
The political effects of reducing trade controls 
are considered in SNIE 100-56, "Political Effects 
of a Relaxation of Controls on Trade with Com-
munist China,? 17 January 1956. 
unless Soviet Bloc credits were increased. 
Such a reduction in export earnings would 
probably significantly retard Communist 
China's internal development. 
77. Soviet credits have been an important 
factor in helping Communist China obtain im-
ports. The value of announced Soviet eco-
nomic aid totals $430 million, made up of a 
$300 million credit extended during 1950-1954 
for rehabilitation and reconstruction, and a 
$130 million credit extended in 1954. In addi-
tion, Chinese Communist budget announce-
ments since 1950 have indicated that other 
Soviet credits have been given to Communist 
China. In 1954, the amount appears to have 
been $400 million. In 1955, the amount ap-
parently was larger, with the major portion 
earmarked for military purchases. 
Military Situation 
78. The power of the Chinese Communist re-
gime is based on the strength of its armed 
forces and its great reservoir of potential mili-
tary manpower. Since the end of the Korean 
War, Communist China has strengthened and 
to a large extent modernized its military 
establishment. However, it continues to de-
pend on the USSR for heavy armaments, com-
plex equipment, POL, and almost all naval 
and air equipment. 
79. Army. The Chinese Communist army 
consists of about 2,500,000 men organized in 
115 infantry, 22 artillery, 4 cavalry, 3 armored, 
and 1 to 3 airborne divisions, as well as other 
miscellaneous units. Approximately 40 per-
cent of army strength is located in North and 
Northeast China and Korea, and another 40 
percent in East and Central South China, 
with relatively few troops in the interior. (See 
Map 2.) 
80. Substantial improvements in organiza-
tion, equipment, and training have been made 
since the end of the Korean War. Actual 
strength of most infantry divisions is esti-
mated at 15,000 men, and division organiza-
tion includes an artillery regiment of 36 field 
pieces. Tank regiments are believed to be 
organic to the army troops of 2 of the 37 
armies and to 16 of the 115 infantry divisions.

Standard armored division equipment in-
cludes 80 medium tanks, 8 heavy tanks, and 
8 self-propelled guns. Twelve of the artillery 
divisions are field artillery, standard equip-
ment of which includes 108 pieces of calibers 
up to 152 mm. However, the amount of 
equipment actually present in armored and 
artillery units is believed to be somewhat less 
than TO&E. 
81. General army morale is believed to be 
high because of increased professionalization 
and ideological indoctrination as well as the 
privileged social status accorded the soldier. 
The adoption of universal conscription in July 
1955 will probably increase service morale by 
fixing the terms of service and rationalizing 
induction methods. However, a significant in-
crease in general popular disaffection, par-
ticularly among the peasants, might adversely 
affect the morale of many servicemen. 
82. The numerical strength of the Chinese 
Communist army will probably not increase 
through 1960 unless the Chinese Communists 
feel themselves faced with imminent large-
scale war. However, beginning in 1958, the 
conscription law will increase the body of 
trained reserves by requiring reserve duty of 
most of the estimated 450,000-600,000 troops 
to be discharged annually and an unspecified 
number of men under 40 with no previous 
service. 
83. By 1960 the army is expected to have com-
pleted the process of incorporating a tank 
regiment and increased artillery and heavy 
weapons into each infantry division. Stand-
ardization of light weapons of Chinese Com-
munist manufacture and heavy armaments of 
Soviet manufacture will be virtually complete. 
84. Chinese Communist vulnerability to air 
attack has caused them to place considerable 
emphasis on antiaircraft defense. Most com-
bat divisions now include antiaircraft battal-
ions for local protection. Five antiaircraft 
divisions and some 19 independent antiair-
craft regiments have been identified. Fire 
control equipment, especially radar, appears 
to be in short supply. With expected increases 
in equipment and further training during the 
period of this estimate, the Chinese Commu-
nists will probably develop a substantial anti-
aircraft capability. 
85. Air Forces. Chinese Communist air (in-
cluding naval air) forces have an estimated 
total strength of 2,270 planes (including 1,485 
jets) and about 80,000 personnel. Through 
1960 the principal offensive air weapon will 
be the jet light bomber force, which presently 
consists of an estimated 310 BEAGLES and 
which will probably reach approximately 
590 by 1960. Although presently stationed 
mainly in bases near Korea and Taiwan, this 
bomber force could be redeployed so as to 
reach any target in Asia north of the Malay 
Peninsula and the southern Philippines. (See 
Map 2.) It is handicapped by lack of combat 
experience and fighter escort capability. Com-
munist China has only 10 piston medium 
bombers (BULLS) , and is expected to have no 
more than 60 by 1960. These could reach 
targets as far away as Guam and Singapore. 
It will probably not acquire its first jet 
medium bombers before 1960. 
86. Communist China's air defense capability 
lies mainly in its estimated 1,175 jet fighters, 
and its core of combat veteran pilots. This 
force is considered combat-ready under visual 
operating conditions. Replacement of the few 
remaining piston fighters with Soviet jets 
should be completed by mid-1956, and the de-
velopment of an all-weather force will prob-
ably begin shortly thereafter. Some 570 all-
weather fighters may be added to the air force 
by mid-1960. Total fighter strength will prob-
ably reach a peak of about 1,600 jet fighters 
in mid-1958. Despite difficulties in construc-
tion and supply, Communist China has great-
ly improved its base structure in the coastal 
area opposite Taiwan. 
87. Navy. With the aid and technical advice 
of the USSR, the Chinese Communist navy 
has reached a present modest strength of 4 
destroyers, 13 submarines, 50 patrol escorts 
and gunboats, 118 motor torpedo boats, 13 
mining vessels, and 56 amphibious craft. A 
number of small Soviet vessels may recently 
have been delivered to the Chinese Commu-
nists along with the transfer of Port Arthur.

88. Although there are indications that the 
USSR may have recently helped the Chinese 
Communists launch an accelerated program 
of naval construction, the development of the 
navy through 1960 will probably continue to 
depend primarily on material received from 
the USSR. The Chinese Communists will 
continue to possess sufficient air and naval 
strength to control the air and sea spaces 
necessary for amphibious operations in the 
Taiwan Straits and offshore island areas pro-
vided the US does not intervene. They will 
develop a capability for medium range sub-
marine operations and will probably further 
develop their mine warfare and surface capa-
bilities for conducting defensive operations in 
coastal waters. These factors, coupled with 
existing air power, will probably give them 
during the period of this estimate a significant 
capability to oppose hostile forces operating 
in coastal waters. 
89. Naval air force strength (included in 
paragraph 85) is 185 planes and 4,700 per-
sonnel. The development of Chinese Com-
munist naval aviation has recently received 
considerable emphasis, probably reflecting a 
need to perform standard naval missions such 
as support of amphibious landings, antisub-
marine patrol, convoy escort, search and 
rescue, reconnaissance, and mining. It is also 
possible that, following the Soviet pattern, the 
defense of certain coastal areas and bases is 
assigned to naval air. In any event, it is 
known that re-equipment of the naval air 
force with jet aircraft is being given high pri-
ority. 
90. The Chinese Communists have sufficient 
conventional amphibious type ships to provide 
lift for 35,000 to 45,000 troops with some 
armor, supporting weapons, and limited trans-
portation, or a maximum of 70,000 lightly 
armed infantry troops. As of mid-1955 the 
Chinese Communist merchant marine in-
cluded 111 vessels (1,000 GRT upward) total-
ling 278,000 gross tons with an estimated car-
go capacity of 417,000 long tons. Utilization 
of this shipping could provide additional lift 
for about 200,000 troops. However, consider-
ing the special problems of phasing, control, 
and protection of forces peculiar to an am-
phibious operation and the necessity for logis-
tic resupply and reinforcement lift capacity, it 
is estimated that a Chinese Communist initial 
assault force would be limited to 75,000-100,-
000 troops. 
91. Nuclear capabilities. We have no evi-
dence that Communist China possesses any 
nuclear weapons, and it has only a primitive 
nuclear research capability. However, if the 
USSR were to provide the necessary equip-
ment and technicians, the Chinese Commu-
nists could in a short time achieve the capa-
bility to use nuclear weapons. A recent Soviet 
pledge to supply a 6,500 kilowatt nuclear re-
actor, a laboratory for handling radioactive 
materials, and an unspecified number of 25 
Mev cyclotrons to Communist China in the 
next few years and to train Chinese Commu-
nist atomic scientists could, if carried out, 
lead to a small Chinese Communist nuclear 
research program by 1960. This aid appears 
to be of most use in such fields as medicine 
and biology, and additional Soviet assistance 
of a different nature and on a scale much 
larger than announced would be required to 
initiate a nuclear weapons or power program. 
Communist China in 1960 
92. Through 1960, the Chinese Communist 
economy, barring such unforeseen contingen-
cies as a major war or a series of natural 
disasters, will probably have continued to ex-
pand, although at a lower rate than during 
the ,first Five Year Plan. The bulk of modern 
industry will probably be state-owned and 
most peasants will be in some form of cooper-
ative. From 1952-1960 Communist China 
will probably have about tripled its electric 
power output, more than doubled its coal pro-
duction, and increased the value of its ma-
chine industry some two and one-half times. 
However, even with these substantial in-
creases, Communist China's industrial base 
will remain small. Crude steel production 
probably will not be more than 5 million tons, 
or some 2.8 million tons below Japan's 1954 
leve1.6 Its estimated electric power output of 
about 21 billion KWH will be 39 billion KWH 
below the 1954 Japanese output. Moreover,

AforioNV 
at best the rate of increase of agricultural 
production will only approximate the growth 
of population. Under these circumstances, 
the regime will continue to have great diffi-
culty in meeting its increasing investment and 
export requirements. Finally, continued de-
pendence on the sources outside Communist 
China for a wide range of complex industrial 
items and a shortage of skilled technicians 
will complicate planned economic develop-
ments. 
93. The Chinese Communists will have greatly 
increased their military capabilities. Against 
indigenous military forces, Peiping will re-
main capable of overrunning South Korea, 
Taiwan and the offshore islands, and main-
land Southeast Asia. However, Communist 
China will still suffer from military weak-
nesses, particularly air defense deficiencies 
and lack of an adequate indigenous arma-
ments base. Chinese Communist dependence 
on the USSR for vehicles, POL, and almost all 
complex military equipment will continue 
through 1960. Communist China will prob-
ably be self-sufficient only in light weapons 
and individual equipment. 
94. The control system will be under increas-
ing pressure. In particular, increased de-
mands for food will conflict with the regime's 
program to develop large reserves and to in-
crease exports of foodstuffs and the acreage 
devoted to industrial crops. Although the re-
gime might make some modifications of its 
investment program in the event of a series 
of bad crop years to increase the availability 
of consumption goods, it probably would not 
make major concessions. Its control mechan-
ism will probably be adequate to enforce prog-
ress toward its economic goals, but the re-
gime will probably have to resort to purges 
and to terror, particularly against the peas-
ants. Popular support for the regime is like-
ly to decline further among peasants and in-
tellectuals, and the party itself may lose much 
of the esprit that characterized the revolution-
ary period. 
II. SINO-SOVIET RELATIONS 
95. During the past five years the relationship 
between Communist China and the USSR has 
Declassified and Approved For Release 
22 
become a concert of interest and action in 
which a substantial degree of mutual depend-
ence has developed. The two allies are linked 
not only by ideological bonds, but by common 
hostility to the US, by a military interdepend-
ence involving Communist China's manpower 
and strategic location and the USSR's indus-
trial and technical capabilities, and by the 
mutual advantages of concerted diplomatic 
and "revolutionary" activities. While we be-
lieve that policies of mutual concern are 
mutually determined, Peiping's dependence on 
Moscow for arms, industrial resources, and 
technical assistance will cause it to continue 
to give Moscow's views great weight on major 
questions of global policy. But Peiping's tac-
tical position in many areas probably gives it 
considerable potential for influencing Moscow. 
96. From the beginning, the Chinese Commu-
nist regime escaped Satellite status both be-
cause of the size and remoteness of China and 
because the regime rose to power primarily 
through its own efforts. The Communist 
Chinese role in the Korean War gave Commu-
nist China additional bargaining strength in 
dealing with the USSR. 
97. Since late 1950 Soviet writers have ac-
corded Mao special honor for his contributions 
to the "treasury of Marxism-Leninism" in the 
field of strategy and tactics for revolutions 
in "colonial and semicolonial" countries. 
There were indications in the late summer of 
1954 of unusual Soviet solicitousness towards 
the Chinese Communists in Malenkov's public 
reference to the "new situation in Asia" cre-
ated by the emergence of Communist China, 
and in the unprecedented visit to Peiping 
of Khrushchev and Bulganin. Communist 
China's stature in the Bloc was further en-
hanced by Molotov's subsequent reference in 
February 1955 to the "world camp of socialism 
and democracy" as "headed by the USSR ? 
or more correctly said ? headed by the Soviet 
Union and the Chinese People's Republic." 
98. Traditional Sino-Russian territorial rival-
ries along their 1,400-mile common border are 
a potential source of friction between the al-
lies. Since the 18th century, China has re-
garded Tannu Tuva and Outer Mongolia as 
Chinese territory. Although the Chinese Corn-

munists now appear to have accepted Soviet 
control of these areas, they may still be ap-
prehensive about Soviet influence in Sinkiang 
and possibly about the recent Soviet interest 
In developing previously neglected regions 
adjacent to Sinkiang and Manchuria. How-
ever, the well-publicized Soviet withdrawal 
from Dairen and Port Arthur indicates that 
the Soviet leadership has taken steps to reduce 
Chinese Communist sensitivity in the border 
areas. 
99. Sino-Soviet economic relations are anoth-
er area of potential friction. There have prob-
ably been disagreements over the level of So-
viet aid to Communist China's industrializa-
tion, and the Chinese Communists have al-
most certainly pressed for much greater aid 
than the USSR is willing to grant. 
100. Although there is no evidence of serious 
friction or lack of coordination in Chinese 
Communist and Soviet relations with other 
Communist parties in Asia, there is a latent 
possibility of strains developing in these rela-
tions. In North Korea the Chinese Commu-
nists increased their influence during the 
Korean War, but Soviet-trained figures still 
hold the most important positions. In North 
Vietnam, geographic proximity has fostered 
Chinese Communist influence, and the volume 
of Chinese Communist propaganda support 
and projected aid exceeds that of the USSR. 
Chinese Communist influence on Japanese 
Communism may also have increased with 
the recent return of some Japanese Commu-
nist leaders from Communist China. The 
Chinese Communists apparently control the 
Malayan Communist Party, but their influ-
ence on the Indonesian Communist Party may 
be offset by long established channels leading 
to Moscow. 
101. The intensity of the "liberate Taiwan" 
movement in Communist China on a number 
of occasions may have created apprehensions 
among Soviet leaders. Chinese Communist 
willingness since the Bandung Conference to 
use diplomatic tactics to further their objec-
tives in Taiwan probably indicates that this 
possible difference of emphasis is not now a 
serious source of Sino-Soviet friction. 
102. During the period of this estimate, Com-
munist China's power and its potential for 
pursuing courses of action which could con-
flict with Soviet interests or desires will 
probably increase. Communist China will 
probably exert an increasing influence on 
Asian opinion independent of that exercised 
by the USSR. The growth in Chinese Com-
munist prestige might encourage some Chi-
nese Communist leaders to attempt to extend 
Chinese influence over other Asian Communist 
parties beyond the point desired by the USSR. 
However, no major differences of interest in 
Asia seem likely to develop during the period 
of this estimate. 
103. For a considerable time to come mutual 
advantage, the existence of common enemies, 
and a single ideology will almost certainly pre-
vail over lesser considerations to preserve close 
Sino-Soviet ties which will probably continue 
to be relatively impervious to outside manipu-
lation. Peiping probably believes that its alli-
ance with the USSR prevented UN forces from 
broadening the Korean War and restrains the 
US from action against the mainland. The 
Chinese Communists will almost certainly feel 
the need for continued protection until their 
own power in the Far East is much further 
developed. 
104. Therefore, at least through 1960, Peiping 
will almost certainly adhere to the alliance. 
A lessening of East-West tensions would prob-
ably not significantly affect Peiping's estimate 
of the continued need for the alliance, and 
might ease pressure in Sino-Soviet economic 
and military negotiations. A heightening of 
tensions could create new problems for the 
alliance, but would strengthen Peiping's de-
sire for solidarity, unless the USSR proved 
unwilling to insure the security of the Peiping 
regime. 
III. PROBABLE CHINESE COMMUNIST 
COURSES OF ACTION IN ASIA 
105. In pursuit of its basic foreign policy aims, 
Peiping will, during the next five years, prob-
ably concentrate on eliminating the Nation-
alist government and gaining control of all 
Nationalist-held territory, eliminating West-
ern (and especially US) influence and power 
in Asia, extending its own influence in the

area, and achieving acceptance as the legiti-
mate government of China. The Chinese 
Communists probably believe that time is on 
their side. This conviction is based on a belief 
both in the ultimate victory of the world Com-
munist movement and in the power of China 
under strong central government. Leninist 
doctrine and their own interpretation of re-
cent events have probably convinced them 
that flexibility and even tactical retreats will 
not seriously compromise their long term 
prospects. 
The Chinese Communist Estimate of 
the Situation 
106. The primary factor in determining the 
manner in which Peiping will pursue its for-
eign policy objectives is its estimate of prob-
able US actions and reactions. It probably 
considers the ultimate US objective in Asia to 
be the elimination of the Chinese Communist 
regime, but probably estimates that the US 
does not intend, unprovoked, to attack Com-
munist China within the next several years. 
107. Peiping almost certainly estimates that 
open aggression on its part against either Tai-
wan or the ROK would lead to strong US 
counteraction, probably including action 
against mainland China and possibly includ-
ing the use of nuclear weapons. It probably 
further estimates that an overt Chinese Com-
munist attack on any other non-Communist 
Asian state would also entail risk of US mili-
tary- counteraction against the China main-
land. It probably also estimates that an overt 
attack by the Viet Minh against any of the 
Indochinese states might result in at least 
local US military reaction, with such reaction 
particularly likely in the case of South Viet-
nam. The Chinese Communists probably also 
estimate that US military capabilities for the 
concentration and effective application of 
force in the areas of Korea, Taiwan, Indo-
china, and even the China mainland are still 
superior to their own. However, there almost 
certainly remain twilight areas in which they 
are uncertain as to the intention or the ability 
of the US to react, as in the event of attacks 
on the Nationalist offshore islands or intensi-
fied subversive efforts in non-Communist 
states. 
108. Moreover, the Chinese Communists prob-
ably estimate that they have certain advan-
tages over the US in any primarily political 
struggle in Asia. They almost certainly be-
lieve that the prestige of Communist China in 
Asia will increase along with the military and 
economic strength of their regime. They 
probably estimate that the indigenous Com-
munist parties and, to a lesser extent, the 
12,000,000 overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia 
provide them with unique instruments for un-
dermining non-Communist governments. In 
their view differences among the non-Com-
munist powers on Asian policy will make it 
difficult for the US to take effective measures 
against Communist expansion conducted 
through measures short of overt aggression. 
Moreover, they probably estimate that anti-
colonial, neutralist, and nationalist sentiment 
will continue to aid their efforts to discredit 
US motives in Asia. They probably also esti-
mate that American diplomacy is complicated 
by commitments in other areas and by ex-
ternal and internal political pressures which 
make it less flexible than their own. 
109. At the same time, the Chinese Commu-
nists may recognize that serious obstacles 
exist to the extension of their power: (a) in 
most non-Communist states in Asia, nation-
alism is the dominant force and most leaders 
of these states recognize the threat of a domes-
tic Communist movement to their independ-
ence; (b) despite occasional well-publicized 
offers of technical and material aid, Chinese 
Communist capital resources are insufficient 
to help these countries gratify their desires for 
industrial development; and (c) less impor-
tantly, in several of these same countries, 
the influential local Chinese community is 
still regarded with envy and suspicion. 
110. The Chinese Communists are probably 
not as concerned with the present strength 
of SEATO as with the future possibility of an 
expanded and strengthened anti-Communist 
bloc in Asia. Their apprehensions on this 
score probably center on Japan, in their view 
the only Asian power which might signifi-
cantly augment anti-Communist power in 
Asia during the period of this estimate. The 
Chinese Communists probably also view India

as a rival for Asian leadership. They prob-
ably also estimate that India would resent a 
substantial extension of Communist influence 
in South and Southeast Asia and be alienated 
by overt Chinese Communist aggression in 
these areas. Peiping apparently feels that an 
attitude of outward respect for the positions 
of Japan, India, and other Asian powers will 
encourage their passivity and a tendency to 
think in terms of Asian solidarity. It appears 
to believe that such ostentatious maneuvers 
as mutual declarations of fealty to "the five 
principles" are likely to help allay Asian dis-
trust of Peiping's motives. 
111. In Communist China's view the probable 
basic hostility of France, the Netherlands, 
Portugal, and probably even the UK is un-
likely to be effectively manifested because of 
their political and military weaknesses and, 
to a lesser degree, because of their desire for 
trade with Communist China. Chinese Com-
munist hostility to these countries has there-
fore been subordinated to hostility to the US. 
The Chinese Communist regime probably esti-
mates that so long as it exercises restraint 
toward these countries, they can be of con-
siderable value to it, both in trade and in 
inducing the US to modify its policies in the 
Far East. 
Main Lines of Chinese Communist 
Foreign Policy 
112. During the period of this estimate, Pei-
ping will almost certainly wish to avoid serious 
military involvement with the US. For this 
7 The "five principles," first subscribed to by Chou 
and Nehru in April 1954 as the general principles 
governing Sino-Indian relations, were defined as 
"mutual respect for each other's territorial in-
tegrity and sovereignty, nonaggression, non-
interference in each other's internal affairs, 
equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful co-
existence." Although reportedly inserted at 
Nehru's insistence, the principles are standard 
Communist cliches, closely resembling those used 
in Soviet treaties both with Nationalist China in 
1945 and with Communist China in 1950. Since 
mid-1954, the principles have been major slogans 
of Peking diplomacy and have been subscribed to 
by U Nu of Burma and Ali Sastroamidjojo 'of 
Indonesia in joint communiques with Chou as 
well as by Ho Chi Minh and the USSR. 
25 
reason, we believe that Peiping is unlikely to 
initiate open hostilities with its own forces, 
except perhaps against the offshore islands. 
Peiping probably would also be unlikely to en-
courage the North Koreans or the Viet Minh to 
undertake large-scale military action because 
it would probably estimate that such action 
could not be carried out without ultimate 
large-scale involvement of Communist China 
with the US. However, during the period 
Peiping will probably encourage expanded 
guerrilla activity in Indochina. Although 
Peiping will probably continue to sanction 
other guerrilla movements now in existence it 
is unlikely, at least in the early part of the 
period, to provide the support necessary for 
large-scale expansion of these activities. 
113. Although the Communists may again re-
sort to military action whenever they estimate 
that the benefits will outweigh the military 
disadvantages of such action, Peiping will 
continue to pursue policies emphasizing po-
litical rather than military action as long as 
its objectives are acceptably served by this 
means. The major factor in this considera-
tion will be their estimate of the risk of 
US military counteraction; thus Communist 
China will probably emphasize political action 
over the next two or three years. In collabo-
ration with the USSR, Communist China will 
pursue a policy of "competitive coexistence 
with the capitalist bloc." The Chinese Com-
munists will endeavor to have their approach 
to international problems characterized as 
conciliatory and flexible, but joint Sino-Soviet 
policy will in fact permit no major concessions 
to the West. Moreover, both parties may feel 
that the development of occasional crisis situ-
ations would weaken the diplomatic position 
of the US and strengthen neutralism, without 
seriously prejudicing their own "coexistence" 
posture. Communist China will also be under 
some pressure, more so than the USSR, to 
manufacture crises in its external affairs to 
provide a pretext for imposing new production 
and austerity drives at home. For these rea-
sons, we believe that although Peiping will 
continue to profess support for the "five prin-
ciples" there will be times when it will assert 
its power ostentatiously, but within the gen-

eral limits of Bloc strategy, in order to re-
affirm its particular claims and pretensions. 
114. By 1960, if Communist China follows a 
course of political rather than military action, 
most non-Communist countries will probably 
have recognized Peiping and established nor-
mal economic relations with Communist 
China, and it will:probably have been accepted 
into the community of nations as the major 
Asian power. In this situation, its position 
in the Sino-Soviet Bloc will have been en-
hanced and the Chinese Communists will 
probably have a greater degree of flexibility 
in their relationship with the Soviet Union. 
115. Peiping's diplomatic activities on behalf 
of the Bloc policy of "competitive coexistence" 
will be concentrated in Asia and the Middle 
East, where there is a disposition to accept 
Communist China as a "former victim of 
imperialist and capitalist oppression." Com-
munist China's role in this effort will be to 
play up to neutralist and nationalist senti-
ment in Asia; to manipulate the Indochina 
and Taiwan issues to divide the West; and to 
exploit vulnerable aspects of intra-Asian rela-
tions such as ROK-Japanese and Indian-Paki-
stani tensions. The Chinese Communists will 
almost certainly continue their efforts to dis-
credit US actions and motives throughout 
Asia, insisting that US policy is disguised 
colonialism and is directed toward a war in 
which "Asians will be used to fight Asians." 
In particular, they will attempt to frustrate 
US efforts to develop a basis for military co-
operation among free Asian, states. Peiping 
will emphasize the advantages of technical 
and economic assistance from Communist 
countries as well as "mutual self-help" among 
underdeveloped countries. They will also seek 
a reduction in Western military, commercial, 
and other privileges in the area. Chinese 
Communist propaganda on these themes will 
seek primarily to keep anti-Communist Asians 
on the defensive over the issues of "colonial-
ism" while the base for future Communist 
advances is strengthened. Communist China 
will encourage wherever possible the forma-
tion of popular-front type governments in 
which the Communist influence would be sig-
nificant and the Chinese Communist pattern 
26 
of anticolonial "people's democracy" studied 
and admired. While to the US Peiping policy 
may appear uncompromising, to many Asian 
states it may appear conciliatory and flexible. 
116. The possibility of a Communist-initiated 
war in the Taiwan Straits, Vietnam. Laos, 
and even Korea will continue to exist. More-
over, Peiping would almost certainly react 
with force if Communist control of North 
Korea or North Vietnam were seriously threat-
ened. They would almost certainly retaliate 
to any sharp increase in the level of National-
ist attacks against the mainland. 
Specific Courses of Action 
117. Taiwan. Peiping is committed to the 
"liberation" of all Nationalist-held territory, 
and defines the Taiwan issue as an internal 
one in which foreign interference will not be 
tolerated. For the period of this estimate, 
however, Chinese Communist courses of ac-
tion toward the offshore islands and Taiwan 
will be determined largely by their estimate 
of US reactions. 
118. Since the Bandung Conference in April 
1955, the Chinese Communists have attempted 
to advance their claims to Nationalist-held 
territories more by diplomacy than by military 
action. However, Peiping has emphasized 
that its current willingness to take over Tai-
wan "peacefully, if possible," should not be 
interpreted as an abandonment of its basic 
objective. Chinese Communist efforts will be 
concentrated on reducing morale within the 
Chinese National government and within the 
mainland Chinese community on Taiwan, in 
the expectation that Nationalist leaders may 
ultimately be induced to negotiate with Pei-
ping over Taiwan's assimilation into Commu-
nist China. The Chinese Communists will al-
so continue trying to force US agreement to a 
bilateral or multilateral conference, at which 
their object would be to induce the removal of 
US military protection from Taiwan. 
119. The Chinese Communists will probably 
continue their buildup in the area opposite 
Taiwan and the offshore islands in order to 
increase pressure on the US and to weaken 
morale on Taiwan. While the Chinese Com-

munists probably do not intend to attack Tai-
wan so long as the US maintains its commit-
ments to the Nationalists, they will almost 
certainly conduct probing operations against 
the offshore islands. If the Chinese became 
convinced that the US would not assist in the 
defense of these islands with its own forces, 
they probably would attempt to seize them. 
Should Peiping's forces successfully occupy 
the Nationalist-held offshore islands without 
incurring US military retaliation, there would 
be an intensification of the campaign to ob-
tain Taiwan. 
120. Indochina. We believe that the imme-
diate Chinese Communist objective in Indo-
china was secured at Geneva when the Viet 
Minh were granted full control of North Viet-
nam. Peiping may have believed that it also 
received an implied commitment for the de-
livery of South Vietnam in July 1956, and that 
in any event conditions had been created 
which would make it difficult for the US to 
intervene. However, we believe that the Chi-
nese Communists now estimate that the US 
would make a strong effort to frustrate an 
extension of Communist control to the south. 
121. In conjunction with the Hanoi regime, 
Peiping will continue its efforts to expand 
Communist influence and control in South 
Vietnam. Through coercion, subversion, and 
propaganda the two Communist regimes will 
attempt to discredit and undermine the au-
thority of the Diem government, and to em-
barrass that government and the US on the 
question of nationwide elections. In addition, 
the Chinese Communists will continue diplo-
matic efforts to isolate the Diem government 
from the Western nations and the Asian 
neutrals. Even if the Viet Minh are delayed 
in achieving a settlement, by elections or 
otherwise, favorable to the extension of their 
control over all of Vietnam, the Chinese Com-
munists probably will not encourage the Viet 
Minh to renew open hostilities. However, at 
some point they probably will encourage in-
creased Viet Minh guerrilla activity in South 
Vietnam. Their actions beyond that phase 
would probably depend on the effectiveness of 
Diem's counteraction and the response of the 
US and the SEATO powers.

27 
122. In Cambodia and Laos, the Chinese Com-
munists will combine pressure and induce-
ments to encourage neutralist sentiment, to 
weaken ties with the West, and to stimulate 
subversion of the free governments. We be-
lieve that if the Pathet Lao position were 
threatened by Royal Government action, Pei-
ping would encourage the Viet Minh to assist 
the Pathet Lao to the extent necessary to pre-
serve the Pathet position. It is less likely 
that the Chinese Communists will encourage 
the Pathet Lao to undertake aggressive mili-
tary action outside of their present group-
ment area, at least while the International 
Control Commission remains in being and in 
the absence of greater evidence of popular 
support for the Pathet Lao within Laos. 
Should South Vietnam fall to the Viet Minh, 
Communist support for subversion and para-
military operations in Laos and Cambodia 
would almost certainly be increased. 
123. Korea. The Chinese Communists, in 
common with the USSR, hope to secure a with-
drawal of UN forces from Korea and a reduc-
tion of US influence there and eventually to 
subvert the ROK. As a means of putting 
pressure on the US to withdraw its troops, the 
Bloc will probably urge new negotiations on 
unification and "relaxation of tensions." To 
further this end, there may be additional with-
drawals of Chinese Communist forces. The 
Communists will almost certainly refuse any 
settlement in Korea which endangers Commu-
nist control of North Korea or fails to offer 
better prospects than at present for eventual 
Communist control of all Korea. 
124. Japan. Communist China seeks to fore-
stall the re-emergence of Japan as a major 
military and political power in Asia and, in 
the short run, to weaken Japan's links with 
the US by exploiting US-Japanese policy dif-
ference. Peiping's tactics will probably con-
tinue to rely upon the manipulation of domes-
tic opposition to the policies of the Japanese 
conservatives, the inducements of Sino-Japa-
nese trade, and the application of direct pres-
sures upon the Japanese government. Com-
munist China will probably be able to increase 
semiofficial contact with Japan through trade 
and cultural missions and will probably step 
up its campaign to normalize relations.

125. Communist China will probably continue 
to support the current line of the Japanese 
Communist Party in avoiding acts of violence 
and working for a popular front. However, 
should any Japanese government undertake 
an extensive rearmament program or reverse 
the present policy of permitting the expansion 
of unofficial relations with Peiping, Commu-
nist China might publicly revert to the posi-
tion that Japan is a major threat to peace 
and launch a campaign of threats and intimi-
dation designed to reinforce leftist opposition 
within Japan. 
126. India. Although Communist China al-
most certainly regards India as a rival, it will, 
at least during the next two or three years, 
probably seek to encourage India's present 
neutralist stand, which has furthered the aims 
of Sino-Soviet diplomacy by bolstering neu-
tralist sentiment generally throughout Asia 
and the Middle East. Thus, Communist China 
will stress those interests it shares with India, 
and will probably keep its attempts to expand 
its influence in the Indo-Tibetan border area 
just short of the point where the Indian gov-
ernment's antagonism could no longer be con-
cealed. 
127. Burma. In the next two or three years 
it will probably be Peiping's minimum ob-
jective to prevent Burma from abandoning 
its present neutral position. Beyond that, 
Communist China will be working to distort 
Burma's neutrality, by encouraging tighter 
Burmese bonds with Communist nations. The 
threat of its military power will continue to 
reinforce Communist China's diplomatic cam-
paign emphasizing offers of friendship and 
peaceful cooperation. Peiping will almost 
certainly attempt to exploit Burma's financial 
28 
and economic problems to bring about closer 
Burmese-Chinese Communist ties. Moreover, 
the Chinese Communists will retain their 
capabilities for subverting the minority peo-
ples along Burma's eastern frontier. 
128. Indonesia. The Indonesian Communist 
Party (PKI) is the strongest indigenous Com-
munist party in non-Communist Asia and the 
Chinese Communists probably estimate that 
its capabilities will continue to be maximized 
by emphasizing a "peaceful" attitude to-
ward the Indonesian government. Commu-
nist China will probably continue its efforts 
to enhance the chances of PKI participation 
in a national front government by itself ap-
pearing to support Indonesian nationalist 
objectives. Even if the PKI were excluded 
from the new government which will come 
into office in the spring of 1956, the Indo-
nesian Communists would probably be en-
couraged by the Chinese Communists to con-
tinue working for a popular front primarily 
by penetration, propaganda, and organiza-
tional work. 
129. Malaya. Communist China probably 
hopes, by encouraging Malayan nationalism, 
to force a British withdrawal from Malaya 
under conditions that would increase local 
Communist prestige. Peiping probably esti-
mates that its capability to achieve this end 
is enhanced by the continued colonial status 
of the area, and in Singapore by the predomi-
nant overseas Chinese population. Peiping 
will almost certainly continue to encourage 
Malayan Communists to work for popular 
front governments, to extend control over 
Chinese youth and the labor movement, and 
to maintain their guerrilla organization.
