 PRC 25TH ANNIVERSARY:  CHOU EN-LAI REAPPEARS, STRESSES UNITY
 The celebration of the PRC's 25th anniversary was highlighted
 by the reappearance of the ailing Chou En-lai whose toast at the
 30 September "grand reception" he hosted was his first public
 speech since late May. The anniversary was also marked by
 parties and cultural events in Peking's parks on 1 October.
 In his toast at the reception on the 30th, Chou emphasized that
 current policies, including the campaign against Lin and
 Confucius, must continue, but h' stressed the need for unity
 both within China and among the peoples of the world.   Chou
 singled out as the major achievements of the past quarter-century
 the victories over Liu Shao-chi and Lin Piao and the "imperialist
 and social-imperialist blockade."
 The traditional PEOPLE'S DAILY-RED FLAG-LIBERATION ARMY DAILY
 joint editorial this year concentrated on domestic affairs,
 sounding themes noted by Chou in citing the need for unity but
 warning that line struggles within the party "will continue
 for a long time to come."  While the editorial called for
 continuing the movement to criticize Lin and Confucius,  it
 hinted strongly that current restraints on mass activism will
 continue.   It directed organizations where "mass investigations
 have beef, more or less completed" to devote their main attention
 to study and criticism, recommending that they read Mao and
 the Marxist classics.   Recent media criticism of Lin's military
 record was reiterated by the editorial, which said that "especially
 for the present" study and criticism should concentrate on Mao's
 military writings and Lin's military line.   As in previous such
 editorials since Lin's purge, the PLA was assigned no specific
 cavil tasks but was told to "thoroughly implement" Mao's military
 line.
 The editorial did not give details on economic progress since
 1949, but claimed that socialist construction was "briskly
 advancing" and that a "fairly complete system of industry and
 of national economy as a whole based on socialist agriculture"
 was forming.   A number of more specific economic advances were
 claimed in NCNA articles related to National Day.   The editorial
 called for fulfilling the yearly economic plan and the fourth
 five-year plan, which is scheduled for completion next year.
 Unlike last year, the editorial did not call for preparations
 for the next,fourth National People's Congress.

 As it had last year, Peking's joint editorial all but ignored
 foreign affairs, restricting comment to a brief review of the
 present "excellent" international situation, characterized by
 "great disorder" in which the United States and the Soviet
 Union are beset by difficulties while the third world is
 advancing.   The editorial revived Peking's usual pledge to
 liberate Taiwan, which had been omitted  last year,
 LEADERSHIP       China's ailing leaders came out in nearly full
 APPEARANCES      fc:ce for the festivities, with only Mao and
 old Marshal Liu Po-cheng failing to appear in
 either Peking or the provinces.   Of China's five vice chairmen,
 only Chou and Wang Hung-wen had appeared in public since the
 31 July Army Day reception.   The most surprising appearance
 was that of Kang Sheng, who attended the 30 September reception
 in a wheelchair.   Except for his reported attendance at last
 year's party congress, Kang Sheng had been out of sight for more
 than three years.   Vice Chairman Li Te-sheng, who was under
 heavy poster attack last spring and who failed to appear on
 Army Day, showed up in his Liaoning provincial base.  Yeh Chien-yang
 attended both the reception and the festivities in the parks on
 the lit.   NCNA on 1 October reported the appearance of all
 provincially based Politburo members in either Peking or their
 provinces,   Tachai leader Chen Yurg-kuei attended festivities
 in Peking, as did alternate Politburo member Wu Kuei-hsien.
 As with Army Day, several newly rehabilitated former PRC leaders
 reappeared, most notably Hsiao Hua, former chief of the PLA
 General Political Department who was purged in 196','.   Hsiao and
 former Acting Chief of the General Staff Yang Cherg-wu, who appeared
 on Army Day, were the most prominent PLA figures purged when
 the cultural revolution began devouring  its own.  Neither has
 apparently been given a new post,each being listed by NCNA merely
 as "present at the reception."  A number of other purged leaders
 were also listed in this category, including Fu Chung-pi, the
 only member of Yang's alleged clique not   to appear on Army Day.
 Other former leaders appearing included several government
 ministers, former Northeast Bureau chief Sung Jen-chiung, and
 former provincial first secretaries Ouyarg Chin of Heilungkiang
 and Lin Tieh of Hopeh.
 Several non-Politburo provincial leaders also showed up in Peking
 for the celebrations, led by Lanchow Military Region Commander
 Han Hsien-chu, who had made no public appearances since January
 and who seems to be under attack for allowing a subordinate to
 publish a pamphlet in 1971 praising Lin Piao's military genius.

 Another provincial leader thought to be under attack, I-lei.lungkiang
 chief Wang Chia-tao, alto nut- in a Peking appearance.   Wang has
 been out of public view sinctc.in    spring and was criticized in
 posters.   Shansi first secretary Hs:ieh Cher.-hua also showed up,
 listed--like Han and Wang--as a member of the Central Committee.
 Hsieh had made no previous appearances this year and has apparently
 been criticized for allowing the production of the opera "Three
 Trips to Taoyuan," which was attacked throughout China last
 spring.  A fourth leader whose presence in Peking seems directly
 related to provincial squabbles is Mao Yuan-hsin, who may be
 involved in investigations into the status of Li Te-sheng.   Mao,
 long rumored to be the Chairman's nephew, has been a party secretary
 in Liaoning since December 1972 and was a Red Guard activist
 there during the cultural revolution.   He has not appeared publicly
 since last January, when he attended a New Year's rally just
 a_.ter Li 's arrival in Liaoning. Liaoning party Standing Committee
 member Chang Shu-te also attended the reception, according to
 NCNA, which placed him with Mao as "also present" near the bottom
 of its lengthy namelist.
 FOREIGN GUESTS      Foreign guests in Peking for the celebration
 AT RECEPTIONS       attended the "grand reception" Ind the festivites
 in the Peking parks.   Most prominent among the
 guests not usually based in Peking was DRV Politburo member Hoang
 Van Hoan, not previously reported present in Peking.  Visitors of
 Chinese ancestry were treated somewhat differently this year than
 in the past.   The traditional PRC State Council party on the 30th
 was attended this year by "Overseas Chinese and foreigners of
 Chinese origin." but "compatriots" from Taiwan, 1-long Kong and
 Macao who h~.:.. .-  _-nded in past years were not reported present.
 Unlike past  r,     i.  , only low-level PRC officials attended the
 State Counc.   '?':c i.or:. and there was no report of speeches.

 MOSCOW COMMENT      Initial. Soviet comment on the 25th PRC
 anniversary has followed Moscow's recent
 line stressing Soviet determination to rebuff ideological
 deviation and the "splittist" policies of the Maoist leadership
 while highlighting longstanding protestations of Soviet desire
 to normalize state relations.   The usual greetings message
 from the USSR Supreme Soviet and Council of Ministers for
 the first time in recent years did not list the "Chairman of
 the PRC" among its recipiants.  Addressed to the Chinese NPC
 and the PRC State Council,  the greetings pointed out past Soviet
 aid for China, professed friendship for the Chinese people, and
 attempted to underline Moscow's desire for ncrmalized relations
 by citing recent Soviet: proposals for treaties with the PRC on
 the non-use of force and nonaggression.   TASS summaries of
 commentaries on the anniversary i_n PRAVDA and IZVESTIYA have
 taken a similar approach, predictably pointing out that Peking
 remains intransigent in the face of the Soviet initiatives.
 PRAVDA commentator Andrey Krushinskiy may have been hinting at
 enhanced Soviet interest in an international communist conference
 when he noted, in reference to Brezhnev's report to the 24th
 CPSU Congress, that Moscow would continue to denounce Maoist
 policies and would work for the "cohesion of the socialist
 countries and the world communist movement on a Marxist-Leninist
 basis"--formulas absent from his commentary on the date last
 year.   As he had last year, Krushinskiy went on to cite Brezhnev
 remarks to underscore Moscow's continuing commitment to normalize
 state relations.
 HANOI OBSERVANCE      This year's DRV treatment of PRC National
 Day followed the pattern of 1973.   The occasion
 was observed in Hanoi with the standard grand meeting, a Chinese
 embassy reception, and leader greetings.  Pharr Van,Dong led DRV
 officials at the 1 October PRC embassy reception, providing a
 slightly lower-level representatic, than last year, when Truong
 Chinh led the turnout.   As in 1973, this year's DRV leaders'
 message noted the Marxist-Leninist and proletarian internationalist
 basis of Vietnamese-Chinese solidarity and praised the willingness
 of the Chinese to fulfill their "internationalist duty" in supporting
 Vietnam.   The greetings this year were more effusive than in 1973,
 :noting China's "wholehearted support and great, all-round and
 effective assistance..  .    ."

 "10SCOW SEES 'IMPERIALIST PLOT" IN WESTERN OIL PRICE MOVES
 Soviet media have  in stereotyped fashion portrayed the current U.S .?-led
 western efforts to deal with rising oil prices, inflation, and other
 economic :ills as an "imperialist plot" against the oil-pro,luci.n  state,,;
 and the Third World.  :loscow has for the most part ignored tho ''oil
 weapon" argument voiced prominently following the Arab-Israeli war
 last October, and  instead has endorsed the defense of higher oil prices
 on economic grounds advanced by spokesmen for iiembers of the Organ:irati'on
 of Petroleum Exporting Countries.   While backing the oil producers,
 Moscow at the same time has accorded circumspect treatment to major U.S.
 statements on the oil issue by President Ford and Secretary Kissinger.
 As in the past, i'toscow's treatment of the oil issues in L-roadcasts
 to Arab audiences--in contrast to general TASS reports and other radio
 beamings--has reflected markedly harsher treatment of the U.S. role,
 going as far as directly linking "U.S. leaders" and what 'loscow calls
 "an extensive campaign of blackmail and pressure" against OPEC states.
 To rea.;sure Soviet consumers and :[oscow's oil-dependent allies, 'loscow
 has recently reiterated that the USSR itself has enormous petroleum
 and energy reserves and that no shortage is likely because of planned
 "socialist'' exploitation.
 TREATMENT OF          TASS provided only sketchy reportage on 1':;
 LORD, KISSINGER       General Assembly speeches on the oil price issue
 by President Ford and Secretary Kissinger, President
 Ford's 23 September major address at the Detroit World Energy Conference,
 and also his address to the 30 September opening of the International
 Monetary Fund and World Bank meeting.   For example, TASS noted simply
 that President Ford's Detroit speech "contained a warning' to OPEC
 countries that had  increased oil prices, without further details.
 Secretary Kissinger's TTt? statement received similar treatment.   However,
 negative reaction to these speeches by Arab and OPEC leaders was replayed
 at length, indirectly revealing alleged U.S.  threats of "retaliatory
 measures" including the use of food deliveries as ar, ''instrument of
 policy" and playing up "indignation" and "shock" in the Arab world.
 At the same time, Moscow Arabic-language broadcasts have openly attri-
 buted to President Ford, quoting Arab press sources, warnings on the
 oil question and U.S. proposals revealing an intention to "set up a
 bloc hostile to the interests" of the OPEC members.   A 30 September
 Arabic commentary on M4oscow's "unofficial" Radio Peace and Progress

 typically was more outspoken,  claiming that "feverish attempts"
 were being made to overcome the Western economic crisis and that
 the United States "has threatened" to halt economic aid and end food
 supplies to countries raising  oil prices or reducing oil production.
 The commentary's explanation for the current oil price concern
 reflected the view--also reiterated recently by Soviet oil commentator
 Rachkov--that OPEC countries were forced to review and raise oil
 prices because of Western in.flz,tion and actions by "international
 monopolies" to fan the flames  of the energy crisis and extract
 "exhorbitant profits" from it.   The solution to the energy crisis,
 according to Radio Peace and Progress, lies not in "political pressure
 and intimidation" against developing countries but in "stripping
 monopolies of their power" and establishing international economic
 cooperation "based on equality."
 U.S. ECONOMIC,      iloscow described as a "failure" the 26-27 September
 OIL MEETINGS        Camp David conference of the Western "Big Five"
 finance and foreign ministers of the United States,
 Britain, France, West Germany and Japan.   'LASS reports on 30 September
 noted that the "Big Five" "failed to solve a single pressing economic
 problem" at their conference, which revealed "serious differences" and
 `'acute contradictions" among the participants.   The secrecy surrounding
 the session, TASS noted, stemmed from the participants' belief that
 such a forum "rightly" might be regarded as "an imperialist plot against
 the oil-producing countries."   TASS noted that various press reports
 described recent pronouncements by "highly placed U.S. officials"--
 an obvious reference to President Ford and Kissinger--as couched in
 "particularly harsh tones.`
 A 2 October TASS report on the  Washington International 'Ionetary Fund
 conference noted "tile danger of a prolonged, serious economic recession"
 was the main topic for the session, which it said displayed "profound
 disagreements between the imperialist states and the developing countries."
 President Ford's opening speech to the PTT, '1oscow radio noted on the
 1st, stressed that "serious and complex" pi.oblems faced the Western
 countr_es.
 Commenting on recent U.S. statements on energy and the new I'T,  session,
 TASS commentator Kiselev on the 27th described at some length the
 "broad campaign of pressure" on oil-producing countries launched by
 "U.S. leaders"' speeches at the UN General Assembly.  He noted that
 this envisaged not only reducing foodstuff supplies to Arab OPEC
 members and ending U.S. assistance, but also forming a "united front"
 of oil-importing states, plans for the diplomatic and political
 "isolation" of oil-exporting countries and depriving them of Third
 World countries' support by enticing the latter with increased foodstuff

 supplies, as well as plans for recyL'ing OPEC oil revenues back
 to oil-importing nations.   Kiselev ch,   -1 '_~ doctrinaire terms
 that once more "imperialist circles" sou,...,                     own
 economic difficulties "at the expe?.se of peoples        _ ..Leer countries"
 who were "exercising their sovereign right in freely disposing of
 their natural riches."
 Rachkov, in a 17 September Moscow Arabic-language commentary, had
 defended the 13 September OPEC action to raise oil taxes by 30 cents
 a barrel as a "self-defense" action aimed at oil companies, not at
 consumers, in order to reduce the "huge profits of the monopolies
 themselves," and in that sense called the tax a "special fine imposed
 by the developing countries on imperialism" for its failure to over-
 come chronic inflation problems.   Rachkov stressed that "there is
 no doubt's that the solidarity of the oil-rich Arab countries and
 other OPEC members with the other developing countries "struggling
 against imperialism and suffering poverty and backwardness" will
 help find a "useful way" to dispose of OPEC oil revenues linked to
 the "common struggle against imperialism and neocolonialism."
 Atypical in recent Moscow output was a 7 September Moscow commentary
 broad:ast to Arab listeners which raised the "oil  weapon" issue and
 the L.S.-Israeli relationship in remarking on alegeclly increased
 "Israeli intrigues" aimed at increasing 'Middle East tension.  Noting
 expanded U.S.-Israeli cooperation and Congressional approval of aid
 to Israel, the commentary stressed that Israel had to rely on the
 United States for oil for its "war machine," and that because some
 Arab countries supplied oil to the United States, "a hole is being
 drilled in the barrier of Arab boycott of Israel."
 OIL MONOPOLIES'         Moscow Arabic-language commentaries on 1 October
 CONSPIRACY CHARGE       revived an alleged linkage between U.S. oil
 policy and the Arab-Israeli conflict in a
 new context.   Quoting French press reports, one commentator charged
 that a recent Teheran meeting, headed by former CIA director and now
 Ambassador to Iran Helms, had discussed a "campaign of intimidation"
 against the oil-producing ;fiddle East countries and that the U.S.
 oil monopolies had become more active as part of this campaign.   This
 proved, the commentator added, that the Arab states faced a  "nEu!
 conspiracy" by oil monopolies seeking to undermine Arab unity, halt
 economic consolidation among the Arabs, and force them to yield
 to "monopolist capital."  Another Moscow Arabic commentary the same
 day pegged to the same "conspiracy" theory cited Arab press reports
 alleging there was a link between U.S. oil policy and ''attempts by
 Zionist circles in the West to obstruct the settling of the 'fiddle East
 issue."

 USSR's "potential oil resources" were-greater than those of any other
 country and that "in a year's time" the Soviet Union would
 be the "world's biggest: oil producer."  Another Moscow foreign-
 language commentary on the 21st claimed that the USSR ranked first
 in the world in natural gas and coal deposits, and these were
 being developed by a comprehensive approach which "only socialism
 can adopt," in contrast to the crisis-ridden capitalistic system.

 ARAB - ISRAELI  I SSUE
 USSR PLAYS DOWN SPLIT IN PALESTINIAN RANKS, PROMOTES PLO
 Moscow has provided only limited comment  thus far on the
 26 September announcement by the Popular Front for the Liberation
 of Palestine (PFLP) that it had decided to withdraw from the
 Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and would continue its
 armed conflict with Israel outside the PLO.  On 27 September
 TASS and Moscow radio's Arabic service carried a brief,  identical
 report on the PFLP announcement, which as the only explanation
 for the decision noted part of a statement by the PFLP that it
 could not accept current PLO political policy.  Moscow omitted
 the PFLP spokesman's denunciation of the PLO leadership for
 seeking a negotiated "surrender settlement" through political
 cooperation with Egypt's President Sadat and through alleged
 U.S.-PLO contacts.  Moscow avoided original comment on the
 development, but it cast the PFLP decision in a critical light
 by citing the Lebanese press to the effect that the decision
 "at this present stage" would hinder the PLO in its task of
 restoring the Palestinians' legitimate rights.
 Moscow's handling probably reflects mixed  feelings over the PFLP
 decision.   On the one hand,  this highly visible display of
 Palestinian disarray occurred at a time when Moscow has been
 advocating Palestinian representation at the Geneva conference
 and supporting discussion of the Palestinian issue--as  a separate
 political issue and not merely a refugee problem--at the current
 session of the UN General Assembly.   The public display of
 strong disagreement among the Palestinians themselves as to
 which organization and approach best serve Palestinian interests
 undoubtedly causes problems for the Moscow media in continuing
 public support.
 On the other hand,  the fact of the Palestinians' disagreement may
 cause Moscow less problem than its timing.   In the past Moscow
 has strongly criticized the PFLP and its leader, George Habash,
 as irresponsible extremists who oppose a peaceful resolution of
 the Middle East conflict and who foster disunity in the
 Palestinian movement.  A 14 August article in LITERATURNAYA
 GAZETA denounced Habash for his "logic, obviously adopted from
 Peking, that peace and socialism are incompatible" and implied
 he was serving Palestinian enemies through his "pseud.o- revolution-
 arinesslarded with Maoist demagogy."   PFLP withdrawal from the--
 by contrast--more moderate and responsible PLO may therefore be
 viewed by Moscow as likely to facilitate the PLO's efforts to
 gain increased international political support.

 Soviet. media references to Palestinian affairs since the PFLP's
 withdrawal indicate Mosro;,i is continuing, as in the past, to
 support the PLO.  The references have not, however, suggested
 any significant increase in that support.               Moscow radio,, for
 example, in a brcadcast to Arab listeners on 30 September
 reported without comment a remark attributed to the leader of
 a U.S. Communist Party delegation in Lebanon that American
 communists "view the PLO as the sole legitimate representative
 of the Palestine Arab people."  The broadcast added that the
 delegation had been invited by the "DPFLP [Democratic Popular
 Front for the Liberation of Palestine], one of the main organiza-
 tions in the Palestinian resistance movement and a member of the
 PLO."  In another Arabic-service broadcast on 30 September,
 Moscow was probably alluding to the PLO-PFLP split when it urged
 all Arab states to unite in a common front in order to support
 the "Palestinian Arab people and their legitimate representatives."

 CYPRUS
 BREZHNEV, GROMYKO REGISTER MOSCOW'S GROWING CONCERN
 Recent statements by both Brezhnev and Gromyko follow the pattern
 of Soviet comment early in September which began to level thinly
 veiled criticism at Turkish policy toward Cyprus.   Discussion
 of Cyprus comprised a major portion of a 25 September Brezhnev
 speech at a dinner for visiting Hungarian First Secretary Kadar.
 And Gromyko in his 24 September address to the UN General
 Assembly stressed that Moscow considers the Cyprus crisis to
 be of international importance.
 Both leaders reiterated the need to remove the issue from NATO
 hands and promoted the Soviet Union's 22 August proposal for an
 enlarged conference on Cyprus within the UN framework.   Both
 Gromyko and Brezhnev seemed to suggest concern that international
 interest could wane now that military warfare has stopped and
 Turkey is concentrating on establishing an "autonomous administration"
 In the area occupied by Turkish troops.   Gromyko took issue with
 those who are "of the impression that this is an event of local
 significance."
 Brezhnev's speech on the 25th was clearly designed to focus attention
 on the Cyprus situation.   Following a discussion of Soviet-Hungarian
 relations, he made only a few remarks about socialist unity and
 relations with the United States and then concentrated primarily on
 Cyprus.   BrEzhnev also brought out the need for concern about Cyprus
 in implying that the future of the island is not totally unrelated
 to the future of Europe.   He noted that "events in Cyprus persistently
 remind one of the fact that if we want a lasting peace in Europe we
 still have to struggle for its effectively."  But Brezhnev stopped
 short of directly linFing Cyprus to European detente, in line with
 the Soviet position at the European security talks that European
 and Mediterranean security problems can be dealt with separately.
 Moscow has consistently opposed Yugoslavia's position that the two
 are interrelated, in order to avoid getting the security talks
 involved with issues that could postpone reaching its major
 objectives at the CSCE calks.
 Brezhnev's criticism of Turkey's role--and Greece's--in the crisis
 was transparent.  While Gromyko referred to Turkey only in the
 most oblique terms, Brezhnev noted that "two NATO member countries"
 were responsible for th^ bloodshed on Cyprus.   He went further in
 registering ":.mall wo;_der" that Greece subsequently withdrew its
 military forces from NATO after its "public and new leadership"
 saw that NATO is "least of all. concerned" with protecting small
 countries.

 Moscow has also carried reports on U.S. Congressional votes
 cutting off military aid to Turkey and on Greek Foreign Minister
 Mavros' 1 October speech at the National Press Club.  TASS reported
 Senator Eagleton as defending the'military aid cut-off by saying
 that Ankara had used U.S. weapons "not for defense but for other
 purposesf   and it opened its report on Mavros' remarks by attributing
 to him the statement that "Turkey's armed intrusion into Cyprus
 has created a very dangerous situation jeopardizing world peace."
 Neither Brezhnev nor Gromyko referred directly to partition,
 restating only Moscow's standard call for r-   oration of "lui epenclence,
 sovereignty and territorial integrity" an,    it withdrawal of
 foreign troops.   Moscow media, however, have acknowledged that
 partitioning is taking place.   NEW TIMES pointed out on the 27th
 that Cyprus is already "aci:ually split in half . . , as a result of
 the interference of foreign troops."

 KADAR VISIT REFLECTS IMPROVED MOSCOW-BUDAPEST CLIMATE
 The speeches by First Secretary Kadar and his Soviet hosts, as well
 as the final communique on the Hungarian leader's 25-30 September
 visit to the USSR, reflected a warmer atmosphere than had prevailed
 during Brezhnev's November 1972 visit to Budapest although there
 are indications that some Soviet-Hungarian problems remain.*  in
 contrast to the strained atmosphere during his visit to Hungary
 two years ago, Brezhnev in a 25 September. Kremlin dinner speech
 had warm praise for Kadar, who,  in his remarks, repeatedly lauded
 Brezhnev and underscored Hungary's long-standing indebtedness to
 the USSR and solidarity with the Soviet bloc.
 The visit produced no Soviet endorsement of Budapest's New
 Economic Management system or any indication that the USSR had
 agreed to make long-range commitments for deliveries of essential
 raw materials for Hungarian industry--a :tong-standing bone of
 contention which had antedated Brezhnev's 1972 visit.   On the score
 of communist unity, Kadar specifically endorsed international
 party conferences, while Brezhnev and Suslov in their speeches
 avoided direct reference to the subject.   Peking was not explicitly
 mentioned in the major pronouncements during Kadar's visit.
 The CPSU had hosted a visit from another prominent Hungarian party
 figure immediately before Kadar's trip to the USSR:   TASS on
 5 September raported a meeting in Moscow between Brezhnev and
 MSZMP Politburo member and secretary Karoly Nemeth, who has been
 conjectured as a possible alternative to Kadar as Hungarian party
 first secretary.   The report explained only that Nemeth was
 visiting Moscow "at the invitation of the CPSU Central Committee"
 and said the "warm, f rie,adly" talks had dealt with CPSU-MSZMP
 cooperation and international topics.   Nemeth was also a member
 of Kadar's party-Government delegation on the present visit.
 BILATERAL RELATIONS       The present visit was the third bilateral
 meeting this year between Brezhnev and
 Kadar, who also had bilateral talks at the Warsaw Pact Political Con-
 sultative Committee meeting in the Polish capital in April and in the
 *  Brezhnev's visit to hungary two years ago had been marked by
 a cool reception given him when he delivered a major speech in
 the Csepel works, a speech which omitted the customary tribute
 to his host, Kadar.   See the TRENDS of 6 December 1972, pages 12-15.

 Crimea on 5 August.   The Soviet leader observed the amenities
 in his 25 September Kremlin dinner. EEpeeci> in  toasting Kadar as
 "the seasoned revolutionary, prominent figure of the inter
 -
 national communist movement, and loyal  friend                                            of the Soviet
 Union and the party of Lenin."   In response, Kadar praised
 Brezhnev as an "outsLand:inf; militant of the  international
 communist movement, who rightly conmirinds sincere respect and
 appreciation throughout the world."  In his speech at a friend-
 ship rally at the Kirov plant in Leningrad on the 27th, attended
 by Suslov though not by Brezhnev, Kadar added further praise
 for the Soviet leader as "that great friend of our people, out-
 standing exponent of the international communist and workers
 movement and consistent militant for the cause of peace."
 Suslov, at the Kirov plant rally, coupled his tribute to Kadar
 with an assurance to the effect that "the CPSU does not and
 could not pursue a policy toward fraternal Hungary any other
 than" one aimed at strengthening friendship and cooperation.
 The joint communique on Kadar's visit goes beyond the one two
 years ago when it specifies "complete" mutual understanding as
 well as mutual satisfaction over the "high level of development"
 of fraternal bilateral ties.   (The 1972 document had merely
 noted the need for "further development of all-round fraternal
 cooperation" between the two parties and states.)   But the
 current communique recorded only generalized Soviet approval for
 Hungary's socialist construction,  ignoring the specifics of the
 New Economic Management system instituted by the Hungarians at
 the start of 1968.   The MSZMP, at its November 1973 plenum, had
 modified some of the decentralized planning and market economy
 features of the system objected to by Moscow, while insisting
 that the essential elements of the system were still valid.
 Moscow's dissatisfaction with the system had accounted for the
 failure of Premier Foci(,  in March 1972,  to secure long-range
 Soviet commitments for raw material deliveries to Budapest.
 Fock at that time took the unprecedented step of publicly
 revealing this disagreement in an airport interview on his
 return from Moscow.   The 30 September communique merely voiced
 satisfaction with progress in Soviet-Hungarian economic coopera-
 tion, goods turnover, and coordination of five-year economic
 plans.   The document tied the Hungarians firmly to the CEMA
 long-range economic integration program, as well as to the
 "coordinated" foreign policy of the socialist ccmmunity.
 Unlike the speeches during Brezhnev's 1972 visit to Budapest,
 those during Kadar's current visit showed little defensiveness
 on the state of relations between the two countries.   Kadar did

 the llungarlan party had broken away from the old methods.
 It has clone away with the former faults and settled
 its account with the traitors and has overcome the:
 grave situation.   The dreams of :International. and
 domestic reaction, who had become brazenly bold,
 were shattered.   Today in Hungary, a stable workers
 regime, enjoying the support of  the entire people,
 is in power.  A socialist society  is being built
 and the Ilungar. ian People's Republic, alongside the
 Soviet Union, stands as an unshakable member of  the
 Warsaw Pact, the CEMA community,  . .  .  the world
 socialist system.
 COMMUNIST UNITY     The communique on Kadar's visit reflected
 Moscow's continued reluctance to explicitly
 endorse the proposed European and world conferences of communist
 parties.   Thus it noted that the two parties "attach great
 importance to collective forms of work" by communist parties
 "both in the regional and in the global framework" and confirm
 their readiness to support "practical steps" in this direction.
 Kadar in his Kremlin dinner speech on the 25th had said his
 party considered it useful to "convoke regional" party
 conferences and "gradually to prepare for a new world conference."
 Two days later, in Leningrad, the Hungarian leader registered a
 more direct call to "start preparations" for a new world conclave
 and to "prepare now and then convene" an all-European party
 conference.   Kadar had been one of the initial supporters of a
 new world conference, calling for such a gathering during a visit
 to Budapest by Bulgaria's Zhivkov on 3 December 1973.   Soviet
 broadcasts on 26 and 27 September dealing with Kadar's remarks on
 the communist movement duly included, respectively, his Moscow
 and Leningrad appeals for new party conferences.   However,  a PASS
 report on the 30th focusing on passages in the communique dealing
 with the communist movement omitted the document's veiled
 reference to regional and global collective work by communist
 parties.
 The communique put the CPSU and MSZMP on record as waging
 uncompromising struggle against "every manifestation of anticommunism,
 nationalism,  and chauvinism, against right and left opportunism."

 was in line with the pattern generally followed at the recent
 round of 30th liberation anniversary observances in Warsaw
 in July,  Bucharest in August, and Sofia in September.  At
 these meetings, attended by Brezhnev, Kosygin, and Podgornyy,
 respectively, only Zhivkov had explicitly denounced "the
 Maoists."  A Moscow radio commentary broadcast in Romanian
 on the 28th recalled Zhivkov's 8 September attack on the
 Maoists as a preface to highlighting Kadar's call on the
 25th for gradual preparations for a new world conference.
 MOSCOW BELATEDLY NOTES YUGOSLAV TRIAL OF PRO-SOVIET GROUP
 Moscow's belated first public mention on 27 September of the
 arrest and trial of a pro-Soviet group in Yugoslavia--revealed
 by Tito on 12 September--provided few details and predictably
 avoided the issue of Soviet involvement in the affair.  The
 acknowledgment, by TASS commentator Vladimir Goncharov, was
 transmitted by TASS, broadcast by Moscow radio,  to Yugoslav
 among other audiences, and published in PRAVDA.
 The thrust of Goncharov's article was clearly to discredit
 Western press reports about Soviet troops massing to invade
 Yugoslavia.   The pro-Soviet group itself was given only minor
 attention, Goncharov noting after a lengthy diatribe against rumors
 about Soviet military intentions that "in order to thicken this
 new anti-Soviet concoction, these gentlemen go so far as to make
 wild fabrications alleging that the Soviet Union is preparing to
 'invade Yugoslavia'  in connection with the discovery in the
 country of .  .  . a 'pro-Soviet plot,' no less!"  Avoiding details
 about the incident, Goncharov reported only that the group
 "opposed the existing system in the country" and that "double-dyed
 anti-Soviets" have interpreted the arrest and trial of the group
 "to their liking .  . . ."
 Despite the use of such terms as "fabrications" and "malicious
 inventions," Goncharov refrained from categorically denying
 Soviet involvement with the group.   At the same time he referred
 to Soviet-Yugoslav relations in low-key fashion, pointing out
 that Western press speculation was directed against the "good"
 and "friendly" relations between the two countries.
 Prior to Moscow's acknowledgment of the affair only bloc maverick
 Romania had mentioned it, having promptly reported Tito's
 12 September speech.   But on 28 September, the day after the
 Soviet commentary, Budapest's party daily NEPSZABADSAG carried an

 editorial article which concentrated on .squelching rumors about
 Warsaw Paut involvement and seemed to appeal to Belgrade to
 forget the affair.   Unlike the Moscow comment, however,  it
 dealt directly with the issue of the pro-Soviet group, including
 a mention of the "fabrication" that the group had received
 support from the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and Hungary.
 NEPSZABADSAG, like TASS commentator Goncharov, criticized the Western
 press for "putting a sensation-mongering and tendentious slant on
 the matter" in order to "poison" relations with Belgrade.   In
 quoting from "the paper of our Yugoslav sister party, KOMUNIST"
 that "part of the foreign press regarded the arrest as a good
 opportunity for creating a sensation and to make much ado over
 the matter," NEPSZABADSAG seemed to imply that both parties had
 agreed in principle at least that a continued public discussion
 would not be beneficial.
 In what appeared to be an almost formal appeal to Belgrade to bury
 the issue, NEPSZABADSAG emphasized the "extensive cooperation"
 between the two countries and parties, which it said "we trust,
 will continue to develop in the future;' adding that "it lies in
 the interests of both parties and both peoples to reject the
 fabrications intended to disturb our relations.  .  .    ."
 Peking has also mentioned the affair for the first time, NCNA on
 the 27th quoting TANJUG on details of the case and selectively
 quoting Western press reports to indicate strong Soviet involvement.

 CUBA
 CASTRO ASSAILS PRESIDENT FORD ON CIA, U.S. OIL POLICY
 Premier Castro, speaking on a 28 September Cuban anniversary
 that coincided with the visit of U.S. Senators Javits and Pell,
 delivered one of his harshest statements on the United States
 in recent years.  Not unexpectedly, Castro used his first public
 address since President Ford's 16 September, remarks and later
 speeches on two sensitive topics--the CIA and U.S. economic
 relations with underdeveloped nations--to launch strong criticism
 of the President and denounce the U.S,  role in Chile and U.S.
 policy toward oil-producing countries.* In contrast, Soviet
 handling of Castro's speech eliminated all references to U.S.
 policy toward oil-producing states and gave only brier attention
 to Castro's attack on the CIA.
 CASTRO ON FORD      Speaking on the 14th anniversary of the founding
 DEFENSE OF CIA    of the Cuban Committees for the Defense of the
 Revolution, Castro declared that President
 Ford's defense of CIA activities in Chile was an arrogant expression
 of U.S. willingness "to intervene by any means, regardless of how
 illegal, dirty, or criminal," in Latin American affairs.   Castro
 said that the world had reacted indignantly to the "full and
 confessed confirmation" of U.S. Government participation in the
 events "which ended with the overthrow and death" of President
 Allende.
 One day before he met with visiting Senators Javits and Pell, the
 Cuban leader blasted U.S. "acts of aggression" in Latin America
 and gave a list of supposed offenses directed against Cuba and
 other Latin countries.   He then asked rhetorically, "What does
 the shameless OAS have to say about this?"  Speaking in his usual
 vein, he called the OAS "prostituted" and urged Latins _o abandon
 it in favor of a regional organization, such as the Organization
 of African  Units, which would exclude the United States.
 ATTACK ON U.S.      Reflecting earlier Cuban press comments on the
 OIL STRATEGY        President's and Secretary Kissinger's recent
 speeches on the oil price issue, Castro held
 the United States responsible for worldwide inflation and defended

 methods of large  L rruisnat i ona 1. companies.                   Cas'*ro quoted portions
 of. President. Ford's speech .it  the Detroit World Energy Conference
 and asserted that U.S, strategy aimed at dividing the nations
 of the Third World and isolating  the oil producers.   Castro
 insisted that   L was "unjust" to blame OPEC for inflation,  because
 the responsibility "fundamentally  rests with the United States
 itself," as a result of its "society of consumption" and vast
 expenditures in Vietnam.   He noted that Cuba, "with the generous
 aid of the Soviet Union," had not  suffered any energy crisis and
 stood ready to bark the "nonalined countries" if they joined in
 an emphatic answer to the "Eli eats  and pressures" of the United
 Stares.   Castro encouraged oil-exporting nations to avoid
 investing their revenues in capitalist countries,.
 Castro, who has been courting Venezuelan President Perez since
 the latter's i.nauguraLion this year gave special support to Perez'
 rejection of President Ford's oil  thesis.  Since Venezuela made
 public  a letter in which Perez voiced his objections to Ford's
 UN speech, the Cuban press has lauded Perez for his defiance of
 "what appears to be a return to the big stick policy."  Castro
 continued this -line in his speech, noting that the Venezuelan
 government had responded "vigorously and with dignity" to Ford's
 speeches.   The Cuban leader promised to continue his backing for
 the Venezuelan position and vowed  that "Venezuela will not be alone
 in this hemisphere as Cuba was."
 Castro did not mention the U.S. senatorial visit.   Cuban coverage
 of it had been light uatil the broadcast of a "Letter from Freddy"
 on October. 1.>',  In what was called the first of a t,Jo-part report,
 "Freddy" devoted most of his space to praising Castro's speech
 but added "the talks appear to have been fruitful" and predicted
 that they "will be repeated on a large scale."  Several short
 Soviet reports on the weekend visit of Javits and Pell to Cuba
 seemed to offer mild encouragement  to such contacts.  Admitting
 that the trip was undertaken "despite the opinion of the State
 Department," a TASS report on the 27th concluded that this was
 the "first real step to normalize:  relations" between the two
 nations.   The visit, the Moscow domestic radio noted on the 28th,
 was "proof of growing feelings" in congress and public opinion in
 favor of "abrogating the policy of boycotting Cuba--a policy that has
 failed. "
 *  The Freddy letters, fictious reports supposedly sent from a Cuban
 expatriate now living in the United Stales, are -  -ievice used by
 commentator Guido Garcia Inclan to treat sensitive topics.

 OF CASTRO SPEECH      to Cuba in January have given cautious
 indications of Soviet support for the
 "ntrmalization" of U.S.-Cuban relations, gave slight coverage
 to Castro's speech.   The only available Soviet reaction thua

 Castro "stressed the need for united action" by petroleum producers
 and underdeveloped countries.  However, nothing was said of

 V I ETNAM
 DRV REVEALS HIGH-LEVEL AGRICULTURAL CONFERENCE HELD IN AUGUST
 Hanoi media have belatedly publicized an eight-day "lowland and
 midland" agricultural conference that began on 5 August in one
 of the DRV's top rice-producing provinces.   According to the
 initial 28 September Hanoi radio report, the conference was
 sponsored by the party Secretariat and heard addresses by First
 Secretary Le Duan, Premier Pham Van Dong, and VWP Central Committee
 Secretaries To Fluu and Hoang Anh.   The leaders' speeches confirmed
 the regime's continuing preoccupation with increasing farm out-
 put and disclosed plans for a movement to reorganize agriculture
 and improve its lower-level management.   Also on the 28th, Hat:oi
 radio broadcast excerpts from a 16 September Central Committee
 Secretariat directive, which had been discussed in draft form at
 the conference, detailing the provisions of North Vietnam's latest
 approach to its agricultural problems.
 The holding of the conference in the delta province of Thai
 Binh--touted in the report as "the first five-ton province"--and
 the leadoff assertion in the report that the fifth month-spring
 crop has been "highly successful" seem calculated to inspire
 and encourage even further successes in inrre sing food production.
 Hanoi has only recently been claiming a "highly" successful harvest
 for its fifth month-spring crop.  Earlier reports, possibly because
 al)  the statistics were not yet compiled, were more cautious.   For
 example, the 16 September NHAN DAN editorial on spring crop preparations
 reported the latest harvest as only "fairly successful."
 Subsequent Hanoi broadcasts of what appear to be texts of the
 speeches by Le Duan and Hoang Anh are not available in translation as
 of this writing, but it is clear from summary versions that the
 primary concern is food production and the feeding of the people;
 at the same time the stated intent of the new movement is to
 advance agriculture toward the ultimate goal of large-scale
 socialist production.   The order of agricultural priorities was
 made clear by Le Duan in his closing day address to the conference.
 He declared the country must "strive to meet the people's require-
 ments in grain and foodstuffs; rapidly accelerate production of
 export goods; and meet industry's demands for raw material and
 labor."  These latest goals show little change, allowing for war-
 time exigencies, from those enunciated  by the 19th VWP plenum
 held in 1971.   Thus, the 19th plenum resolution called for
 agriculture to "provide a full supply of grain and food products to

 meet the needs of the army and people; provide a supply of raw
 materials for industry and produce many agricultural products
 for exportation in exchange for materials, equipment, and
 machinery;.and provide a full supply of manpower for combat,
 combat support, industry, and other sectors."
 Former Central Agricultural Commission Chairman Hoang Anh's
 important role at the conference suggests he remains as one of
 the regime's top agricultural spokesmen.  Although Anh was
 relieved of his position as head of the Agricultural Commission
 in a broad reorganization of the government in late April,
 he has continued to carry out many of the duties associated
 with his former post and on at least one occasion he was again
 identified, perhaps by mistake, as the chairman of the
 Agricultural Commission--in a 27 July NHAN DAN account of a
 message from the commission on the 10th-month rice crop.*
 The directive--"on the reorganization of agricultural production
 and gradual improvement of agricultural management"--enumerated
 the many shortcomings facing agriculture, admitting that there
 has been a slowness in even recognizing the problems that need
 to be solved.  Measures planned to reorganize agriculture as called
 for in the directive are discussed in terms of the roles played
 by cooperatives, villages, districts, provinces and central level
 branches, and party organizations.
 The directive recalled plans--first announced by Vice Premier Le
 Thanh Nghi in his National Assembly speech last February aht: again
 by National Assembly Standing Committee Chairman Truong Chinh at
 the youth conference the same month--to hold in 1974 a nationwide
 congress of peasant members of agricultural cooperatives to "discuss
 and adopt" a statute on high-level cooperatives.  In what may be an
 indication that the original plans for the congress have been
 watered down, the directive only vaguely called for "promoting"
 the congress, without specifying when it would be held or at what
 level.  While the directive did mentiun the statute in this game
 context, it failed to provide any details on is future ad,ption,
 merely asking that its implementation be discussed in coordination
 with the reorganization of management and production.

 SUPPLEMENTARY  ARTICLE
 HANOI, PEKING, THAI CP DIVERGE ON THAILAND ISSUES
 Almost a year after the installation of the Thai civilian govern-
 ment led by Prime Minister Sanya Thammasak, comment from Hanoi,
 Peking and Thai Communist Party media reflects divergent attitudes
 tcward the regime and its ties with the United States.   During the
 Indochina war the two communist states and the Thai CP had
 assumed a virtual united front and were uniformly critical of
 Bangkok and its links with Washington.   This unanimity has
 disappeared under the impact of the Sino-U.S. rapprochement, the
 peace agreements in Vietnam and Laos, the gradual reduction of
 U.S. military forces in Thailand, and '-he re' urn of civilian rule
 to Bangkok.
 Presently only Hanoi shows acute sensitivity over the U.S. military
 presence in Thailand and close Bangkok-Washington cooperation in
 Southeast Asia, viewing U.S.-T'Zai "collusion" as a direct threat
 to Indochina.   By contrast, with the improvement of Sino-U.S.
 relations over the past two years, Peking media now largely ignore
 the U.S. presence and refrain from linking Thailand to the
 situation in Indochina.  At the same time, Peki.ng's corresponding
 desire to improve bilateral Thai-PRC relations has been reflected
 in a drastic reduction in Chinese criticism of Bangkok's internal
 policies.   The Thai CP clandestine radio station based in China--
 the "Voice of the People of Thailand"--has continued to  criticize
 the Thai Government and the presence of U.S. military forces, but
 has played down the relationship of those forces to Indochina.
 HANOI       For a brief period after the January 1973 Paris agreement
 on Vietnam, Hanoi appeared willing to moderate its
 traditionally hostile attitude toward the Thanom Kittikhachon
 military government in Bangkok.   Evidence of a more favorable
 climate on both sides for accommodation surfaced when D RV and PRO
 delegations to the Joint Military Commission cordially met with
 Thai officials during a stopover in Bangkok on 28 January 1973
 en route to their posts in Saigon.   Hanoi media, while not
 publicizing the stopover, began treating Thailand and the Thanom
 government less critically than in the past.   Thus, whereas a
 12 January 1973 Hanoi radio commentary on U.S. bases in Thailand
 ?'hid assailed Thanom personally as a "vile U.S. lackey," only a
 month later a 15 February QUAN DOI NHAN DAN commentary on Secretary
 Kissinger's visit in Bangkok used such neutral terms as
 "Kittikhachon, Thailand's leader" and "Thai authorities"  in
 referring to the Bangkok government.

 A harsher Hanoi attitude toward Bangkok reemerged only after the
 transfer of U.S. command headquarters from South Vietnam to
 Thailand, when it was apparent that Thailand would continue to
 play a major role in the U.S. commitment in Southeast Asia.
 Thus, a 22 April Hanoi radio commentary deplored evidence of
 Thai cooperation with the United States and criticized the
 "reactionary Thai ruling clique," and North Vietnamese media in
 the following days resumed attacking Bangkok leaders by name.
 The reduced U.S. profile in Indochina following the 15 August
 1973 halt to bombing in Cambodia and the concurrent U.S.-Thai
 agreement on the initial stage of U.S. military withdrawal brought
 no moderation to Hanoi's invective.   A 27 August NHAN DAN
 commentary pegged to the U.S. withdrawal announcement questioned
 Washington's intentions and accused the "Thanom Kittikhachon
 reactionary administration" of tailing after the United States
 in a futile effort to make the Nixon Doctrine succeed in
 Southeast Asia.
 Hanoi welcomed the overthrow of the Thanom government in October
 1973 but was cautious about public evaluation of the new civilian
 administration under Eanya, seeming to adopt a wait-and-see
 attitude toward the latter's promises to improve relations with
 Indochinese countries.  After several months of restraint, a
 12 May 1974 NHAN DAN article finally voiced Hanoi's negative
 assessment of the Sanya regime and charged that it had failed
 to follow through on its announced interiLions to improve relations.
 The article, attributed to "Observer," particularly condemned the
 continued U.S. military presence in Thailand, Bangkok allegations
 about a DRV threat to Thai security, and .3angkok's policies
 toward Vietnamese nationals in Thailand.   Specifying conditions
 for establishing "friendly relations" with Thailand, Observer
 asserted that Bangkok must "stop its collusion" with Washington
 against Vietnam, refrain fi)m slandering DRV intentions toward
 Thailand, and release Vietnar,iese residents in Thailand who had
 been "illegally detained."
 The Observer article did not include a U.S. withdrawal from
 Thailand among its conditions for improved DRV-Thai relations,
 but tea demand for a U.S. pullout has 1'en repeatedly voiced
 in authoritative Hanoi statements.  Hanoi's intention to pressure
 Bangkok on this question was underlined in a 7 September 1974
 DRV Foreign Ministry spokesman's statement that interpreted
 recently proposed Thai legislation to expand Bangkok's control
 over U.S. forces as a plot to legalize the U.S. military presence.
 The bill's sponsor, former foreign minister Thanat Khoman--an

 independent-minded legislator whose views are frequently cited
 favorably in Thai communist broadcasts--was pointedly criticized
 by accompanying Hanoi comment. The spokesman's statement
 supported the Thai people's struggle for complete U.S. withdrawal
 and said that an end to Thai Government involvement in U.S.
 moves against Indochinese countries remained "a basic condition"
 for the establishment of friendly DRV-Thai relations.
 PEKING      Peking began to moderate criticism of the U.S.
 military presence in Thailand almost a year before the
 Paris peace agreement, reflecting the changes in Sino-U.S.
 relations at the time of President Nixon's February 1972 visit
 to China.   The Chinese had previously ,joined the Vietnamese in
 condemning U.S.  forces in Thailand and the use of Thai-based
 planes in Indochina, but by early 1972 Peking's increasingly
 sanguine view of the Nixon Doctrine in Asia resulted in a marked
 decline in such criticism.   There was no comparable moderation in
 PRC criticism of the Bangkok government until August 1972, when
 Peking media abandoned previous abusive attacks on the
 "Thanom-Praphat clique."   In September and October 1972 Peking
 took its first step toward improving bilateral PRC-Thai relations
 by welcoming official Thai envoys to China.
 Peking's new line was clearly demonstrated in its comment on the
 30th anniversary of the Thai CP on 1 December 1972.   Departing
 from past practice, Chinese media did not publicize the PRC
 leaders' message of greetings on the occasion.   The message itself,
 as carried by VOPT, seemed calculated to minimize Peking's long-
 standing identification with the Thai insurgency.   The message
 generally praised the Thai party for its "great contribution to
 the liberation struggle" in Thailand but did not mention the Thai
 Government, instead referring to "local reactionaries."   It
 conspicuously avoided associating the Chinese with the strategy
 of people's war 'a Thailand and did not mention Chinese support.
 Following the signing of the Paris agreement, Peking media have
 occa-ionally noted the U.S. military presence in Thailand but have
 exhibited none or Hanoi's concern about it.   Thus, Peking media
 reports on the August 1973 U.S.-Thai agreement on the first stage
 of U.S. military withdrawals did not echo Vietnamese skepticism
 about the move or cite reports that the United States planned to
 retain a permanent residual force.
 Peking's general caution in its treatment of Bangkok authorities
 continued after the assumption of power by Sanya in October 1973.
 However, Chinese media have shown somewhat less restraint than

 2 OCTOBER 1974
 during Thanom's rule.  Since the change in the Thai Government,
 NCNA has carried more reports on fighting and urban unrest in
 Thailand and has given somewhat more attention to the Thai CP.
 Most recently, for example, NCNA matked the 7 August anniversary
 of the Thai insurrection--an anniversary ignored by Peking media
 in the previous year--with accounts of VOPT comment dwelling
 upon insurgent battle successes.   NCNA duly noted the comment's
 focus on armed struggle as the proper route to liberation but
 omitted references to the United States and mentioned the Sanya
 government only once.
 THAI CP      The Voice of the People of Thailand broadcasts have
 never reflected any moderatioi- of the Thai CP's
 hostility toward the authorities in Bangkok., despite the change
 in the stance of the Thai communists' Chinese mentors.   The
 party has also continued to criticize the U.S. military presence
 in Thailand as an affront to Thai sovereignty, although since
 the Vietnam peace agreement it has paid less attention to the
 relationship of these forces to Indochina.
 Thai CP propaganda after the change of government in October 1973
 dismissed the Sanya regime as basically the same "reactionary
 clique" that had ruled Thailand for years.   The communists have
 also continued to call for armed struggle to seize power, although
 the increased importance of the mass movements that brought the
 downfall of the Thanem administration has been recognized in
 expanded VOPT comment encouraging urban political movements,
 demonstrations, and strikes.
 The party's more favorable assessment of political trends in Thai
 cities has also given a more optimistic cast to its view of the
 overall situation in Thailand.   Thus, while Thai CP comment in
 1972 on the 7 August anniversary of their insurrection underlined
 the difficulties facing their struggle,  this year the VOPT
 editorial on the anniversary dwelt upon the achievements of the
 political struggle in the past year and characterized the
 insurgents' situation as "excellent."
