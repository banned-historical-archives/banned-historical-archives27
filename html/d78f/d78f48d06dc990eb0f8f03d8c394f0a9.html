 THE CIA
 An Old Salt Opens Up the Pickle Factory
 No one knows whether CIA spooks
 wind up in heaven or hell when they
 die, but wherever they are, they must
 be rattling their bones in protest. Bare-
 ly a decade ago, almost no high officials
 in Washington talked directly about the
 Central Intelligence Agency. It was
 obliquely referred to as "the pickle fac-
 tory" or "our friends" or "across the
 river" or, more openly, "the agency" or
 the company." When the CIA's $46 mil-
 lion headquarters opened along George
 Washington Memorial Parkway in sub-
 urban Langley, Va., in 1961, the decep-
 tive highway sign said only BPR, for Bu-
 reau of Public Roads. Even Soviet KGB
 agents laughed at that. Finally the sign
 was changed to read: CIA. Now candor
 has gone further. For the first time, a
 photographer-from  TIM[--has been
 allowed to take some pictures of the peo-
 ple and operations inside the pickle fac-
 tory. Guided public tours of Langley
 may soon be held, if only on Saturdays,
 but agents unready to come in out of
 the cold will be warned to stay out of
 sight to avoid a happenchance recog-
 nition by touring friends.
 Visitors will find that Langley looks
 much like other airport-modern Gov-
 ernment office buildings. It has more
 guards than most (including some be-
 hind thick glass walls on the executive
 floor), more desktop boxes with various-
 colored covers to conceal their contents,
 more plastic wastebaskets whose con-
 tents are for burning, more locked cab-
 inets, steel vaults and restricted areas.

 Information: a resource
 that's helping us manage our
 other resources better.
 World population is increasing at more than 200,000 every day. It is
 expected to double in the next 25 years. Where will the a:adIt Iona I food coigne from?
 What of the other resources needed to sustain economic growth and provide a
 better life for the individual on this shrinking planet?
 The supply of many of our resources is finite, an our rate of use, alarming.
 For example, consumption of mineral resources has be,--n soaring throughout the
 world. This country alone has consumed more minerals, nd mineral fuels it the last
 30 years than all of mankind used in all previous histor%.
 Finding new deposits or these finite resources--and, where possible, de-
 veloping alternate sources-must obviously go hand in hand with more careful
 management of what we consume. Supplies of repli: fishable resources--food,
 fibers, timber-can fortunately be expanded by human effort, but the required scale
 of increase poses an awesome challenge.
 Most critical of all, the sustaining resources or life itself-air, water and
 land-must be protected from mounting dangers in our ever more crowded, more
 industrialized world.
 In the struggle to manage our resources more effectively, information is
 proving to be an immensely valuable ally. Thanks to rapidly advancing information
 technology, it has become a vita resource in its own right.
 Information is the essence of IBM's business: providing products to record
 it, process it, communicate it, store it, and retrieve it.
 Computers are being used in the effort to locate new sources of oil, gas and
 minerals. They are being used to explore ways to ap_)ly solar and geothermal
 energy, to maximize hydroelectric power output and tc, reduce energy consump-
 tion in buildings without sacrificing comfort or safety.
 Computers are processing information about so it chemistry, climate, pest
 resistance and plant genetics-helping in [he campaign t:n produce more abundant
 food crops. They are aiding in smog control, investigating ozone depletion, con-
 tributing to improved water purification.
 There are many other examples. All, like these, have been made possible
 by innovation in information technology.
 Clearly, better management through modern information technology is
 only part of the solution to our resource problems. But it is an important part.
 IBM will continue to advance technology in many areas to develop better
 ways to help people use the vital and productive resource called information.

 The agency, hurt by revelations of
 its abuses of power both abroad and at
 home, is on a much needed public re-
 lations campaign. Of greater signifi-
 cance, the CIA is sailing on more open
 waters under its new director, Admiral
 Stansfield Turner, 53. As he told TIME
 Correspondents  Strobe  Talbott  and
 Bruce Nelan in an interview, "We op-
 erate well when the public is well in-
 formed. The information we have which
 need not be classified should be in the
 public domain. The public has paid to
 get it_"
 In Turner's view, the CIA is indeed
 like a company. He says that it has
 "a product"-international information
 and analysis-which it should share
 with its "customers": the nation's mil-
 itary strategists, its civilian policymak-
 ers, headed by the President, and, at
 least in some instances, all Americans.
 Explains Turner: "I think we need to
 sell our product to our customers more,
 and I think we need to expand our ser-
 vice to other customers-including the
 public."
 The notion that public relations is a
 legitimate CIA function worries many
 oldtimers. Though the agency has al-
 ways had a p.r. official of some sort, it
 did not formally admit so, and he was
 rarely helpful to the press. But as the
 CIA was drawn into public controversies,
 the office became more professional and

 more open. Now p.r. is expanding to an
 18-member staff under Herbert E. Hetu,
 a retired Navy captain.
 Turner readily recognizes that all
 the new salesmanship will be useless un-
 less the CIA improves its product. And
 while the CIA's shrouded world of spies
 and its secret efforts to influence polit-
 ical events abroad have been widely crit-
 icized, its more basic function of sup-
 plying reliable intelligence has been
 faulty too. TIME's Talbott and Nelan

 Competing Daily. But papers are
 a CIA staple. Each day the agency pro-
 vides two classified intelligence summa-
 ries. one. called the "President's Daily
 Brief," goes to only five people: Carter.
 Vice President Walter Mondale, Vance,
 Secretary of Defense Harold Brown and
 National Security Adviser Zbigniew
 Brzezinski. The other, the "National In-
 telligence Daily," omits a few superse-
 cret items and circulates to about 100
 high officials. Ye-: at the White House,
 a competing daily intelligence summary
 from the State Department's Bureau of
 Intelligence and Research (INR) is con-
 sidered superior. The INR staff was
 shaped and honed by former Secretary
 of State Henry Kissinger, and is de-
 scribed by one White House staff mem-
 ber as "leaner and more self-confident"
 than the CIA.
 The CIA also contributes heavily to
 periodic papers called "National Intel-
 ligence Estimates," which attempt to
 pull together the expertise of all the U.S.
 intelligence-gathering agencies, includ-
 ing those in the rr ilitary services, on spe-
 cific topics. The agencies' main aim has
 been to assess Soviet strategic capabil-
 ities and, more significant, Russia's in-
 tentions. These reports were read crit:

 ically by.Kissinger, who sometimes pen-
 ciled in the margin "flabby" or "bureau-
 cratic bullshit." They are still held in
 low esteem at the White House.
 Aware of these failings, Turner,
 whose two-hat job as CIA chief and di-
 rector of Central Intelligence gives him
 leadership of the entire intelligence
 community, has recruited two top as-
 sistants for tough assignments:
 - Robert Bowie, a Harvard political
 scientist and director of State Depart-
 ment policy planning under President
 Eisenhower, will concentrate on over-
 hauling and improving the "National
 Intelligence Estimates."
 - Robert  ("Rusty")  Williams, a
 management consultant and longtime
 friend of Turner's, will review and rec-
 ommend. changes in the agency's direc-
 torate of operations, the much criticized
 unit that carries out covert operations.
 Yet it is Turner's promise to make
 greater public use of CIA expertise that
 is the most striking change. The first
 such move was the declassification of
 the CIA's assessment of worldwide oil
 and gas reserves. Agency veterans fear
 that making studies public may reveal
 their secret information-gathering tech-
 niques and sources. But Deputy Direc-
 tor Henry Knoche, a CIA career man
 and its second-ranking official, argues
 that "there are ways of more adroitly
 writing our reports so we don't give away
 sources and methods, but can impart our
 conclusions." Turner believes too much
 secrecy makes it harder to keep the sig-
 nificant secrets. Says he: "The less we
 classify, the better off we are in protect-
 ing what we have to protect."
 There is one CIA weakness for which
 Turner has no ready solution: detecting
 and countering the efforts of foreign in-
 telligence agents to acquire U.S. secrets.
 The weakness stems in part from a
 shake-up in which veteran counterspies
 were replaced. The shifts took place be-
 fore Turner arrived, but Knoche be-
 lieves such work requires a periodic
 turnover of agents who will go all-out for
 a time and then take on other duties. Ex-
 plains Knoche: "The work by its nature
 -where you constantly have to build
 negative or paranoid assumptions-can
 almost guarantee a form of illness."
 Overall Czar. Another problem is
 the prohibition against CIA investiga-
 tions of spying within the U.S. By law,
 that is an FBI duty. "The textbooks
 say the two agencies shall consult,"
 says Knoche, "but the relationships of
 people involved at the working level
 may differ. We may keep book on a So-
 viet intelligence operative in Geneva,
 but the minute he transfers, say, to the
 Soviet U.N. mission in New York, we
 notify the FBI, and then it's over to
 them. But the guy following it in New
 York may not get himself sexed up
 about it at all." Yet Knoche concedes
 that giving one unit control of both in-
 ternal security and counterintelligence
 abroad "would be too much power for
 one department."
 No proposal is in the works for that
 'We Have to Be More Intelligent'
 Even when he is in mufti, his erect
 military bearing is obvious. And as Ad-
 miral Stanfield Turner passes military
 men in the CIA's spacious corridors, they
 often salute automatically. When he de-
 scends from his seventh-floor office in a
 private, key-operated elevator and steps
 into his, sedan, the chauffeur calls him
 "Admiral" rather than "Director." Tur-
 ner likes it that way. After 34 years in the
 Navy, he is all salt.
 The admiral and his wife Patricia
 are living in an officer's house at the
 Washington Navy Yard. He plays tennis
 at 6:45 a.m. twice a week on Navy courts
 with a neighbor, Vice Admiral Robert
 Monroe. He jogs in the evening with his
 golden retriever Hornblower, occasion-
 ally plays squash at the Pentagon.
 Some veteran CIA hands complain
 that the naval invasion of CIA has gone
 too far. Turner's executive assistant, two
 special assistants, his speechwriter and
 his staff schedulemakers are all on active
 Navy duty. His public affairs chief is a
 retired Navy captain. In what even an
 aide says was a mistake, Turner brought
 in his son Geoffrey, 29, a Navy lieuten-
 ant, to work temporarily at the CIA until
 School in Monterey, Calif., this fall. Tur-
 ner points out that Geoffrey is not re-
 placing anyone at the CIA and gets only
 his regular Navy pay. The admiral sees
 the assignment as a chance "to have a
 little fun, with a father and son having
 something in common to talk about and
 share."
 While much attention has centered
 on Turner's Annapolis ties with Presi-
 dent Carter, the two were not friends
 there and. met only once between their
 graduation in 1946 and his selection by
 Carter as CIA director. Turner is, howev-
 er, working to develop a closer relation-
 ship. Although CIA directors have al-
 ways carried the extra title of director of
 Central Intelligence, Turner is the first
 to use an office away from Langley for
 his broader D.C.I. duties. This second
 rack for his second hat is a suite of five
 rooms in the Old Executive Office Build-
 ing next to the White House. He spends
 at least a fourth of his working hours
 there and sees Carter alone for a half-
 hour every Tuesday and Friday. He also
 sits in on Monday Cabinet meetings.
 Turner bristles at the suggestion that
 he should have resigned from the Navy
 in taking the ern post. To have done so,
 kind of centralized authority. But the
 creation of an-overall intelligence czar
 with Cabinet-level status is being con-
 sidered favorably. This intelligence boss
 would supervise the budgets of all the in-
 telligence agencies, including those in
 the military.
 A parallel proposal is being worked
 out by a Senate subcommittee under
 Kentucky's Walter Huddleston. The
 plan would also: create a National Secu-
 rity Council subcommittee to review
 proposals for covert operations, ban the
 hiring of outsiders to conduct illegal acts
 abroad (such as burglaries and antigov-
 ernment protests), prohibit political as-
 sassinations and require the FBI to secure
 federal court orders before conducting
 surveillance of suspected spies.
 Congress and the White House must
 still work out how much control the new
 czar should have over military intelli-
 gence officials. A gentlemanly argument
 is developing between Turner and De-
 fense Secretary Brown over this. But
 some trends are clear. The director of
 Central Intelligence will be strength-
 ened; his control over budgets, assign-
 ments and the collection of information
 will be tightened; and he almost certain-
 ly will be Admiral Stansfield Turner.
 he says, "would have been a charade,"
 since an officer can return to active duty
 later. Apparently in line to become the
 intelligence czar, he scoffs at the notion
 that he is merely waiting for the job of
 Chief of Naval Operations or Chairman
 of the Joint Chiefs to open up. "Ridicu-
 lous!" he says. "I can do as much here for
 the good of the country as I can in any
 military assignment." And why? Says
 he: "Thirty years ago, we were hands-
 down the predominant military power.
 We were a totally independent econom-
 ic power. We were the dominant power
 in the political sphere. Today we aren't
 predominant to that degree or anything
 like it. That isn't necessarily bad, but it
 means we have to be more intelligent."

 THE ADMINiSTItATION
 Jimmy Battles the Barons
 Democrat Jimmy Carter and the
 Democratic Congress appear to be head-
 ed for collision. Chief issue: determined
 to balance the budget by the end of his
 first term, Carter, the fiscal conserva-
 tive. is clipping away at congressional
 spending.
 1 he more liberal Congress is on the
 verge of passing three bills that could ex-
 ce;d his spending plans by $3.5 billion
 and he may well veto one or more of
 th.-m. Paying no heed to the Presidents
 pr)test that various dams, canals and ir-
 ril ation projects are too costly and en-
 vironmentally damaging, the House re-
 stored 17 of the 18 projects on his final
 hip list; the Senate is expected to restore
 more than half. The White House seems
 to be virtually itching to veto the waste-
 fu  measure when it reaches Carter's
 de;k. Says a presidential aide: "There's
 nc? way Congress can win on that one.
 Even it' they should override him. 'ie
 wins." Democratic Senator James
 Ahourezk agrees because "the Congress
 is mistakenly held in such low regard
 by the public."
 Carter's reaction to the other b lls
 is less certain. He wants lower farm pr-;,:e
 supports than Congress: $2.90 per  u.
 or wheat. v. $3 voted by a House crrn-
 mittee and 5.3.10 by the Senate. If tie
 Senate levels prevail, a veto is possih e.
 and it would probably not be overr:d--
 dcn. The $61.3 billion labor and heal Ii,
 education and welfare bill, which pro-
 vides $2.1  billion more than Carer
 wants to spend. is a closer call. If ,ie
 President vetoes it. he will look Iikc a
 fllnthearted conservative to many I h-
 erals. The White House is divided c,,, -,r
 what to do. Issues Coordinator Stu 1 ,z-
 enstat is urging the President to sign t lie
 bill, but Bert Lance, the budget chief is
 Rosalynn Takes a Message Home
 Wherever she went, she listened
 ca'el'ully--and urged heads of state and
 their minions to express themselves free-
 ly. "You can be blunt," she would say.
 "'Co ahead, that's what I'm here for."
 Throughout her 13-day tour of Latin
 America and the Caribbean, Rosalynn
 Carter managed to establish a frank rap-
 po -t with her hosts. She achieved her
 goal of convincing top leaders that Pres-
 id(nt Carter wants to improve long-

 neglected relations with Latin nation',.
 Like leaders of other governments
 along the tour- Venezuela's Preside it
 Carlos Andras Perez said he was "pleas-
 antly surprised" by the "extraordinary
 woman." Brazilian officials gave their
 poised and well-briefed visitor hi::.h
 marks for her meetings with President
 Ernesto Geisel. Said one diplomat: "TIis
 lady knows w hat she's talking about. S sae
 asks the right questions and has the rie ht
 answers. There's no fooling arounc,
 Speaking her mind, the First Lady r_-
 emphas,zed to Geisel her husband's co r-
 cern about nuclear proliferation. T':e
 Brazilians resent Carter's opposition o
 telling him to draw the line to help con-
 trol inflation.
 Rejecting these  measures would
 bring still more trouble for other Carter
 proposals, notably his call for a consum-
 er protection agency and registration o1'
 voters on Election Day; passage of both
 seems doubtful. Farther down the road.
 Congress could sanotage the foreign aid
 bill and a Panarra Canal treaty. Last
 week the House 'w'ays and Means Corn-
 mittee sliced up Carter's much herald-
 ed program to ease the fuel crisis, and
 that provoked the President to publicly
 criticize Congress isee ENERGY).
 Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd
 complains that tle President's energy
 program "was not thought out." lie also
 feels that Carter states lofty goals, then
 fails to follow thrcugh: that he is trying
 too much without knowing enough. As
 Byrd told TIME Correspondent Neil
 MacNeil, "He's getting good on-the-job
 training, but he has so little experience
 that there may not be time to learn
 enough."
 While Carter'. energy program is
 their plans to buy comprehensive nu-
 clear fuel facilities abroad.
 Rosalynn clearly established the
 point that her husband is determined to
 make the encouragement of human
 rights a key part of his foreign policy de-
 spite the danger of exacerbating rela-
 tions with some countries. In Recife.
 Brazil, Rosalynn met with two Amer-
 ican missionaries --the Rev. Lawrence
 Rosebaugh,  42,  a  Roman Catholic
 priest, and Thomas Tapuano, 24. a Men-
 nonite worker-who had been jailed on
 trumped-up charges and mistreated for
 four days. "I have listened to their ex-
 perience," she said later, "and I sym-
 pathize with them." She added, as she
 had at all her stops, "I have a personal
 message to take back to Jimmy."
