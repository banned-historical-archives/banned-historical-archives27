CONGRESSIONAL RECORD sENAft 
rather the conclusion reached before the 
ban Ivaa:even 4?11Siderect 
ali,?rt, we must see the 'treaty for 
What it a VerY limited agreement. It 
has two important advantages that out-
weigh the, to my Mind, hypothetical and 
neVer siOcessfully proved disadfantages. 
These are, first!, the end' to radioactive 
fallout. Although this menace may in-
? deed be  exaggerated, there seems -little 
doubt that increased radioactivity in the 
atmosphere could eventually have a se-
rious eteet. NO one can be certain that 
? additional cancers Or birth deformities 
have not resultid 'from higher levels of 
fallout. The fact of the matter is that 
as long as we do not know precisely what 
causes a' birth deformity or what makes 
-a Caneer grow,"it is the better part of 
? wisdom to end the contamination of the 
air that has, by Statistical study, at least, 
Contributed to them. 
Recent studies have very clearly pin-
pointed the increased incidence of child-
hood Cancer in cases of prebirth X-rays. 
Although we do not know nearly asmuch 
as we W6uld like to about birth deformi-
ties, and in fact about the 'Many and 
subtle ways in which radiation Can affect 
living a,nd future generations, the fact 
rernains that no one has, been able to 
show any benefits from a general in-
crease in radiation levels, and medical 
studies are indicating, with increasing 
Impact, the possible dangers. 
So look upon this as the first basis 
for support of the treaty. 
Secondly, the treaty is important in 
hampering?though not, of course, fully 
preventing the proliferation of nuclear 
weapoms?atmospheric' testing on the 
part of other nations. Although this 
treaty clearly does not prevent other na-
tions frop proceeding if they are ready 
to undertake underground tests the in-
Convenience and expense may well apply 
a brake, a brake which would be in the 
interest of the Soviet Union as well as 
the United States. In short, the treaty 
represents a limited effort to reduce what 
has been one of the most conspicuous, if 
perhaps not actually one of the most se-
rious, threats to world peace in the post-
war decade. It is a limited vehicle to 
achieve a limited, but certainly desirable, 
result. 
For that reason, I believe it would be 
a very Serious mistake to attach to the 
treaty any of the reservations or under-
, - 
standings that have been proposed to 
date. there is, nothing I personally 
would welcome more, and nothing I feel 
would be more in the national 'interest 
at this :time, than the withdrawal by 
their sponsors of each and every one of 
these reservations or understandings. 
One 9.,f the.Understandings, for in-
stance, provides that U.S. participation 
in, the treaty does not involve any degree 
of recognition of the East German Gov-
erxiineht; What, about North Korea and 
North Vitriarn, if they should ever desire 
to acc'R ? What about Outer Mongo-
lia, which we do not recognize but which 
has aCeeded? should they not also be-
, 
specifically mentioned? To raise this 
Issue formally as an understanding to 
the treaty adds nothing substantive to 
?Ur deterrninagons East Germany, 
but it might well confuse the situation 
with regard to other countries. And a 
vote of rejection of such an understand-
ing would cloud the East German issue. 
Another understanding, with regard 
to U.S. right of withdrawal immediately 
in the event of Soviet violation, has been 
thoroughly clarified by the Secretary 
of State. We would abrogate the treaty, 
we have made itclear, if the Soviets 
. ? 
cheat. 
Another understanding With regard to 
peaceful nuclear explosions brings a 
wholly new element into the actual 
'treaty, and in my view could open a loop-
hole for Soviet and other testing that We 
might later regret. In any case, in my 
judgment, it deserves a lot more stud'Y 
and attention before being incorporated 
in this document:s-
The issu.e of use of nuclear weapons in 
the case of armed. hostilities bas simi-
larly been clarified beyond doubt. 
Also, the desire to insure that any and 
all amendments to this treaty be sub-
mitted to the Senate is important and 
worthwhile. Such a requirement is basic 
constitutional law. The President and 
Secretary of State have already assured 
the Senate they would comply with such 
a requirement. If the Senate voted to 
add specific language to this treaty to 
that end, it might seriously imply that 
amendments could be made to other 
treaties, in which such language does not 
appear, without the advice and consent 
of the Senate. If the Senate voted not 
to add specific language, it would leave 
the issue as regards this particular 
treaty, up in the air. It is my hope, 
therefore, that the assurances of the 
President will be accepted and no effort 
made to complicate the situation by such 
an amendment of the resolution of rati-
fication. - 
Every one of these points has been 
answered satisfactorily time and again 
by the President, the Secretary of State, 
and the Secretary of Defense. To in-
clude them in the treaty would add noth-
ing but confusion and ill feeling for other 
signatories. To vote not to include them 
might leave these very questions up in 
the air. It seems to me it would be very 
unwise for the Senate to be put in the 
position of having to vote on any of these 
points, which to my mind are perfectly 
clear now and would only be confused 
by a Senate vote. 
Another reservation recently intro-
duced would require that the treaty not 
come into effect until all the delinquent 
Soviet assessments to the United Na-
tions are paid: Nothing, it seems to me 
could be more extraneous to the subject 
matter of the treaty,? and in fact, no 
More 'germane than would be a-feierVa: 
tion postponing the effective date of the 
treaty until the United States balances 
its budget. Needless to say, I favor a 
balanced budget for the United States, 
and for the United Nations, and I favor 
all nations paying their debts and obli-
gations, but I do not see what that really 
has to do with a limited test ban agree-
ment. 
Certainly we are right to be concerned 
about Soviet delinquency, in We United 
Nations and todo everything we appro-
priately can to encourage them to pay 
)003-7 
- 
*6715 
up. Soviet actions in this session of the 
United Nations, including the question 
of paying their share, will be a good test 
of how much the Soviets really mean in 
their new peace offensive. It will be a 
good indication of what we can expect in 
the future, but it is no test at all of the 
validity of a ban on atmospheric nu-
clear explosions. It would be extremely 
unfortunate if the Senate were to me-
ander down this byway and lose sight of 
what we are really here to ratify and 
secure. ? 
Finally, with respect to the reservation 
that Soviet Military personnel be re-
quired to- leave Cuba before the treaty 
comes into effect, I doubt there is any 
Member of Congress that has for so long 
expressed greater concern than I have 
over the Cuban situation. If I thought 
such a reservation would encourage the 
Soviets to withdraw from Cuba, I would 
back it, but I am not such an optimist 
as to believe that this is a constructive 
move toward getting the Russians out 
of the Caribbean. 
They are going to leave Cuba, and 
other points only when we make things 
so tough for them, by economic and po-
litical and other pressures that it does 
not pay them to remain there any 
longer. We are not going to talk them 
out of Cuba?any more than we talked 
them out by passing a tough resolution 
last September, a resolution to which the 
Soviets paid no attention and which the 
executive branch has largely ignored. 
It is surprising to me that anyone in 
this country expects mere negotiations 
to get the Russians out of Cuba. It is 
even more surprising that those who ad-
vocate this course?at least among my 
constituents?are the same people who 
warn that we cannot trust the Russians 
in any treaty. If that is so, I do not see 
any value whatsoever in bringing in ad-
ditional complication into the treaty 
which we would not expect the Russians 
to abide by and in which it would be a 
lot harder to discover and confirm cheat-
ing than in some purely scientific area 
such as nuclear fallout. 
In my view, it would be a most serious 
mistake for the Senate to accept any of 
the unnecessary or extraneous proposals 
that have been offered as additions to 
the resolution of ratification. 
With the clear understanding then 
that this treaty is a limited commitment, 
that it does not even bind the United 
States to further negotiations of any 
sort on any issue that we would not oth-
erwise wish to discuss, and that it is 
interpreted by the United States in ac-
cordance with the points that are made 
in the report of the Senate Foreign Re-
lations Committee, I support the treaty. 
What the treaty provides is in our in-
terest and that of the whole free world. 
What it does not provide, both good or 
bad, should not be the object of present 
decisions, and should not be brought 
into the discussion to mislead or alarm 
our citizens.

CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
Senate that the treaty should be voted 
up or down on its merits, with no ex-
traneous Inaterial being attached to it, 
by way of reservations, which are printed 
and are lying on our desks. 
My recollection is that approximately 
2 years ago the distinguished Senator 
from New York was one Of the success-
ful sponsors of an amendment to Pend-
ing legislation with respect to interdict-
ing trade with Cuba. Cuba remaips a 
problem. The question before the Sen-
ate is whether an agreenient to prohibit 
testing by way of nuclear explosions, ex-
cept underground, is in the interest of 
the American people and in the interest 
of the people of the world. 
I comenend the Senator for stressing 
the fact that in his opinion, and in my 
opinion, the treaty merits the support of 
the Senate and of the people of this 
country, but that no extraneous mate-
rial ought to be attached to it When the 
Senate votes on it next Tuesday. I hope 
it will vote overwhelmingly in favor of 
it. I congratulate the Senator for the 
Points he has znade. 
Mr. KEATING. I thank the Senator 
for his statement. It is extremely im-
portant not to complicate the situation 
by attaching reservations or amend-
ments which might or might not re-
quire renegotiation, but certainly would 
require notice to the other signatories to 
the treaty. 
People have written to me to ask, 
"Why do you want to be for a treaty 
that helps the Soviet Union?" 
That is not the question. The ques-
tion is, Does it help the United States? 
Does it help to prevent the continued 
Pollution of the atmosphere? Does it 
help to prevent the proliferation of nu-
clear weapons by other countries? Cer-
tainly its ratification is in the interest 
of the people of both nations. If, inci-
dentally, it also helps the Soviet 'Union, 
certainly we should not be against it for 
that reason. I do not believe that the 
fact that it provides incidental benefits 
for the Soviet Union should be a basis 
for opposing the treaty. 
Mr. KUCIIEL. The Senator is correct. 
Human beings, black or white, free or 
slave, whether they live in America or on 
the other side of the Iron Curtain, 
breathe the same air. 
Competent scientists who testified be-
fore the 'committee stated that at one 
point in the testing of nuclear explo-
sions in the atmosphere the danger to 
mankind becomes inevitable, regardless 
of the level at which that point is 
reached. 
In my opinion, the Senator is also com-
pletely correct with respect to the prob-
lem of the proliferation of nuclear na-
tions, about which we read in the press 
several Weeks ago. The Senator from 
New York made some cornMents in the 
Senate to the effect that the United Arab 
Republic, having obtained some scien-
tific brainpower, was on its way to cre-
ating a rocket arsenal, one step away 
from being a nuclear power in the Mid-
dle East. Think of the hazard to the 
peace of the world that would opcur from 
countries in the Middle East being nu-
clear powers. Such an event could 
plunge the whole world into an abyss. 
As the Senator from New York speaks 
In support of the test ban treaty, on 
which the Senate will vote next Tuesday, 
what a wonderful thing it is that 100 na-
tions all arotind the globe, in every hemi-
sphere, have said, "We want to join in 
this agreement." 
The Senator's points are well taken. 
In my judgment, he speaks with impec-
cable logic. 
Mr. KEATING. I am grateful to the 
Senator from California. 
ANNIVERSARY OF 1962 CUBA 
RESOLUTION 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. President, I 
should like to refresh the memory of 
Senators that today Marks an anniver-
sary. One year ago today the Senate 
passed, with only one dissenting vote, a 
resolution expressing the determination 
of the Congress and the country with re-
gard to the presence of a Soviet military 
establishment in Cuba. The resolution 
was signed by the President on October 
3, 1962. 
The controlling language of the reso-
lution after the preamble provided as 
follows?and I stress that it was adopted 
with only one vote against it: 
Resolved by the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America 
in Congress assembled, That the United 
States is determined--
(a) to prevent by whatever means may be 
necessary including the use of arms, the 
Marxist-Leninist regime in Cuba from ex-
tending, by force or the threat of force, its 
aggressive or subversive activities to any part 
of this hemisphere; 
(b) to prevent in Cuba the creation or use 
of an externally supported military capabil-
ity endangering the security of the United 
States; and 
(c) to work with the Organization of 
American States alici with freedom-loving 
Cubans to support the aspirations of the 
Cuban people for self-determination. 
We all remember that the resolution 
was worded with great care. A number 
of resolutions were introduced, but this 
is the one that was adopted. It was 
the expression of determination by the 
United States in formal language stated 
by Congress. , 
Now, a year later, the Marxist-Leninist 
regime in Cuba has extended its sub-
versive activities to every corner of the 
hemisphere and is working 24 hciurs a 
day in the effort to overthrow existing 
governments throughout Latin America. 
That relates to paragraph (a) . 
Although there is no threat to the ter-
ritory of the United States itself right 
now, there is a very real threat to our 
continued hemispheric security in the ef-
forts Castroist forces are making to over-
turn the Governments of Venezuela, 
Peru, and Colombia and to infiltrate 
through the Jagan regime in British 
Guiana directly into Brazil. Surely the 
threat to U.S. security is just as real and 
a great deal closer than the threat in 
South Vietnam, where we are spending 
$1 V2 million a day to defeat communism. 
As to paragraph (c), it is true that 
the United States has worked with the 
Organization of American States. 
_ 
Instead of working with freedom-lov-
ing Cubans to achieve self-determination 
September 20 
for Cuba we have thwarted their efforts 
at many points. A State Department 
spokesman, in fact, recently told the 
,American Legion Convention,. in Miami, 
.that the Cuba question was basically 
one that had to be solved by the 
Cubans?ignoring the thousands of So-
viets in Cuba who are forcibly keeping 
the Cubans from doing just that. 
In short, not one point of this resolu-
tion, which was debated and favorably 
reported by two Senate committees--the 
Committee on Foreign Relations and the 
Committee on?Armed Services held joint 
hearings?passed with near unanimous 
approval by both Houses of C'ongress, 
has been effectively implemented in the 
last year. Today, I year from that time, 
the resolution is virtually unimple-
mented, except for the fact that the 
United States has been working with the 
Organization of American States. 
Meanwhile there is mounting evidence 
of Latin American concern over the 
Castro regime and over Castro's delib-
erate campaign to incite insurrection 
and violence in other countries. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed, following my re-
marks, a series of newspaper articles 
written by reliable reporters to docu-
ment this trend of the increase in the 
inciting of insurrection and violence in 
other Latin American countries. _ 
There being no objection, the articles 
were ordered to be printed in the Recoaa 
, (See. exhibit I.) 
Mr. KEATING. Mr. President, the 
memories of some of us are short. The 
resolution passed by the Senate exactly 
a year ago today should serve to remind 
us all of the very wide gap that still ex 
ists between our objectives, our stated 
policies, our adopted resolution, arid the 
hard realities in Cuba. There is still, as 
there was last fall, a pressing need to en-
force policies we have already eriu:neik 
ated, before we find not only a COMMUk 
nist Cuba, but also a Communist Guiana, 
a Communist Haiti, a Communist Brazil, 
a Communist Colombia, a Communist 
Venezuela, or other Communist countries 
on our very doorsteps.

PEAR OF MILITARY COTJP ALARMS VENEZUELANS 
(By George Matanson) 
CARACAS, September 19.?The threat of an 
imminent military uprising hangs heavily 
over Venezuela. People in the streets talk 
of little ylse and Caracas publications are 
expressing their concern with banner head-
lines. 
Terrorist activity has mounted steadily in 
recent weeks. The armed forces, angered 
at the Government's apparent inability to 
halt the attacks, is widely believed to be 
planning to take matters into its own 
hands., 
This view was bolstered today when the 
pro-Castro terrorists attacked an American-
owned factory in downtown Caracas. 
Six men armed with submachineguns, 
who identified themselves as members of 
the Armed Forces of National Liberation 
(PALM, destroyed by fire the plant and 
warehouses of the Du Pont Co. in an area 
ringed by other business houses.

The more aggressive tone of the Cuban 
,statements, he contended, was "a direct re-
sult" of what he termed Washington's "poi-
icy of subversion and harassment" against 
Cuba. 
Many Latin American representatives here, 
especially those from the nations of Central 
America and the Caribbean area, which are 
most exposed to Cuban propaganda, are 
eager to determine if the new situation poses 
any threat to their security that may require 
collective action by the inter-American 
system. 
Daniel Oduber QuirOs, Foreign Minister of 
Costa Rica, suggested that the heads of the 
Latin American delegations meet during the 
Assembly session to discuss Communist sub-

Cuba. 
One difficulty the inter-American system

been the absence of substantial evidence that

REBELS URGED TO CONTINUE 
Ill a recent speech, the Cuban Premier 
urged the Venezuelan rebels to continue their

CARACAS: TERROR STEP-UP TRACED 
" (By Bertram B. Johansson) 
The extent to Which Venezuelan Castro-
Communist terrorists have taken matters 
intci their own hands is demonstrated by 
their executing four of their own number 
recently in disciplinary sessions in the hills. 
The men were executed by the,pro-,,gom-
niinliat triatin-arrimitierirlia-s" aft& they ITC 
tried to? desert, aecording to a fifth guerrilla: 
who escapedand "repOrted theThie-cittioThd"to 
officials at Barquisinieto. 
A Venezuelan nevre--agency said the fifth 
guerrilla told -authorities the four men were 
" ? .,,.. 
lined "up before a firing squad in the moun-
tains of Lara State about 2 weeks ago. 
The executions coincide with a marked 
Increase in terroristic violence in several 
areas of Venezuela, aimed at three targets: 
1. The downfall of the Betancourt gov-
ernment before It leaves office constitution-
ally early next year. 
2. Prevention of the December 1 presiden-
tial elections which would insure constitu-
tional succession in the Presidency for the 
first time in decades. 
PUBLICITY SOUGHT 
3. Laying the groundwork for a develop-
ment of chaos in Venezuela in which, as in 
Cuba, Communists would be ready to step in 
or take advantage of any openings that might 
develop toward a greater concentration of 
power in Castro-Communist hands. 
Within the past few days Castro-Commu-
nist fomenters of violence attacked the home 
of a presidential guard captain, killing one 
soldier and wounding another; attacked a 
Maracaibo police post; and perpetrated two 
bomb blasts at east coast oil pipelines. 
Last week the terrorists catured Alfredo di 
Stefano, an international soccer star, and 
h-ehl-hirn for '56-hours before releasing him. 
Through such stunts, stealing valuable 
French paintings recently, and hijacking 
ships, the terrorists seek to obtain maximum 
publicity ,for their cause and to embarrass 
Vehezuelan police forces. 
? The problem of the Venezuelan police is 
that they are not highly trained. Most of 
them had to be changed when the Marcos 
Perez Jimenez dictatorship fell, and it is only 
in recent months that professional police in-
structors have been teaching Caracas police 
in crime detection and prevention methods. 
Leader of the Castro-Communist terrorists 
has now been identified by the Interior Min-
istry as Maximo Canales, a Cuban Commu-
nist, who engineered the spectacular hijack-
ing of the Venezuelan freighter Ansocitegui 
last February. 
Venezuelan authorities consider the most 
recent flurry of violence and terrorism as a 
sign of desperation, but Caracas citizens are 
concerned about the apparent ineffectiveness 
of police to handle these political juvenile 
delinquents.

? THE MEANING or AGUILLA KEY 
(By Seymour Freidin) 
The arrogant Castro Cuban raid on a little

It involves a future Soviet technique aimed 
at all underdeveloped areas and tempting

_Actually, it is based on the most mammoth

carefully, plotted cogently, the Russian aim 
is to pick off the immense potential in the

They cannot achieve?so they have ap-

kets with the euphemism of competitive co-
existence. In short, their policymakers have 
decided that the vast and cumbersome So-
viety heavy industrial machine cannot com-
pete with that of the United States. There-
fore, the answer is planned upheaval, di-
rected by highly skilled agents who build up 
the apparatus for a takeover in a given ter-

16718 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD --- SENATE 
Nobody, including the dedicated men in-
volved, can pretend to say whether their un-
emotional, surgical presentations can affect 
the present course of U.S. policy. This is an 
epoch, somewhat schizoid, in which the quest 
for power accommodation with the Russians 
has become obsessive. The plangent bells 
of caution keep the pace, at least outwardly, 
rather dignified and measured. 
Soviet policy isn't deferred by our ap-
proach. It has been ina.de up and imple-
mented abroad for some time now. Let's get 
down to a few cases, as the men who make 
these assessments would say dryly. Take 
the wretched episode at Aguilla Key. Castro 
gunboats sealed off and invaded the heat-
seared British-administered islet. 
Our planes watched. Under orders, they 
did nothing. Onto Aguilla Key stormed a 
landing party. Their comrades trained anti-
aircraft guns on watching U S. aircraft. 
They even sent in a helicopter from one of 
the little warships. 
So, 19 exiles from Cuba were forcibly re-
patria.ted after a bald invasion of foreign 
territory. The incident?so melancholy in 
Its utter insensitivity to human dignity and 
right--was Soviet conceived. The U.S.S.R., 
around the world, never ceases to try and 
bring back citizens who fled and want no 
More of the Soviet system. 
The act at Aguilla Key, while successful 
from the Soviet operational point of view, 
was small potatoes. It proved one most use-
ful point, though, to the vast and recast 
Soviet intelligence methods: that Cuba un-
der its present regime is of untold value as a 
jurnping-off spot for Latin America. 
The biggest, proportionately, Soviet intelli-
gence operation abroad is in Cuba today. 
Access is easier and more direct, as a result, 
with Soviet missions throughout Latin Amer-
ica. Every Russian mission in Latin America 
today is headed by a highly experienced in-
telligence officer. 
The grim, old joke that the chauffeur in a 
Russian Embassy really ran the show has 
long since been interred with Stalin. In-
stead of using intelligence agents in covert 
and lower echelon levels, deliberate Soviet 
decision has placed them in No. 1 spots. 
And not just in Latin America. This, is 
now true in most of Asia and Africa. The 
objective is the same: seizing by subversion 
the regimes and, thereby, the markets of new 
countries. An underground apparatus and 
disaffected, ambitious politicians are all pay-
dirt in the targets marked out by Soviet 
policy. 
Some ultrasophisticated people may say, 
loftily, that it doesn't sound very new. Well, 
it is and had better be recognized, because 
the Russians never before used intelligence 
operations on such a high level to strike for 
a given objective. 
Maybe this remark from a highly gifted 
man, who holds glittering Credentials, has a 
little impact: 
"It's a life-and-death competition for the 
markets," he said, dry-smoking a filter ciga-
rette. "There ought to be a lot more said 
about it. But that's not up to me." 
Obviously, it's up to the top to see and 
shed some light on this deadly phase of co-
existence.

JAGAN CALLS CONFERENCE TURNING POINT - 
(By Bertram B. Johansson) 
British Guiana's Prime Minister Cheddi 
Jagan, with a wide-ranging amblvalenee, is 
warning Britain his colony must soon obtain 
independence?or else. 
The self-admitted Marxist Prime Minister 
told a press conference this past weekend 
that the territory conference expected to be 
held in London in October?where British 
Guiana independence may be considered?
will determine whether the colony goes "a 
la Khrushchev, a la Mao Tse-tung, a la 
Castro, or .a la Jagan." 
CVBAN INCLUDED 
Prime Minister Jagan is already showing a 
great attachment for Cuba's Premier Fidel 
Castro, who last week said the duty of rev-
olutionaries is to 'make" revolution all over 
Latin America. 
Mr. Jagan told a press conference in 
Georgetown Saturday it was unrealistic for 
West Indian leaders to think of Caribbean 
unity without including Cuba, the biggest 
--country in the region. "Such a large area 
cannot be ignored for long," he said. 
On July 24, the Jagan government bor-
rowed $1,700,000 from the Guiana Import-
Export Corp., a business concern which 
recently has done a brisk trade with Cuba 
and other Communist countries. 
Government officials, according to Reuters, 
refused to comment on the purpose of the 
loan, as have officers of the corporation, 
which is dominated by Marxist Prime Minis-
ter jagan's People's Progressive Party. 
Sir Ralph Grey, British Guiana Governor, 
inspected the balance sheets of the corpora-
tion to ascertain its financial position after 
the Jagan government ignored his suggestion 
it first await possible British Government 
aid 
SOVIET GOODS IMPORTED 
During the recent 11-week general strike 
staged by the Labor Confederaticin against a 
bill Mr. Jagan was trying to push through 
Parliament, the Prime Minister began im-
porting Soviet oil from Cuba, on Soviet tank-
ers, and Cuban rice. Much propaganda was 
made about the commodities saving British 
Guiana from chaos. 
During the strike, two Cuban student or-
ganizers, of the type that have been deported 
from several Latin American countries, were 
extremely active In the Georgetown area 
among student groups. 
Just as the strike was ending, 18 more 
Cubans, identified as aviation experts and 
technicians arrived to render what was 
termed assistance to widen activity of Brit-
ish Guiana Airways, which is alleged to have 
one 7-passenger plane. 
There is concern in Washington circles 
about the possibility British Guiana may 
become a sluice gate for Castroite subversive 
traffic into South America and the rest of 
the hemisphere. 
Havana radio has announced British 
Guiana has given landing rights to Cuban 
planes The announcement followed shortly 
after the United States had complained to 
Britain about Cuban planes unloading po-
tential subversive agents in the British-
owned Grand Cayman Islands, 200 miles 
south of Cuba, for transfer to other air-
lines proceeding to Latin American points.

CASTRO PLEDGES SOVIET STJPPORT FOR REVOLTS 
IN LATIN AMERICA 
HAVANA, July 26.?Premier Fidel Castro 
called today for Cuban-style revolutions in 
Latin America. 
"What has happened in Cuba could hap-
pen exactly the same way in many Latin 
American countries," he told a mass rally in 
Havana on the 10th anniversary of the at-
tack on the Mowcada Barracks that ulti-
mately put him into power in 1959. 
He asserted that "all peoples who do what 
Cuba has done will have the support of the 
Soviet Union and " Socialist [Communist] 
countries." 
"Mare and better things which have been 
done in Cuba, can be done in Latin America," 
he added. "A million workers and peasants 
look to Cuba for hope and encouragement." 
PEACE IS RULED OUT 
Premier Castro asserted that Latin Ameri-
can revolutionaries insisted that "revolution 
could not be made by peaceful means." 
He stressed that the way to revolution 
Septembe7?20 
"will not be opened by itself" and that revo-
lutionaries themselves must open the way. 
"Revolutionaries must not only learn 
theory," he advised. The Cuban. leader at-
tacked the United States-sponsored Alliance 
for Progress program of aid to Latin America, 
calling it "an aggressive instrument against 
Cuba destined to fail from the beginning." 
He mentioned insistently Argentina, Peru, 
Colombia, and Guatemala as countries ripe 
for revolution. He described as a farce the 
recent election In Argentina and sent "a fra-
ternal message of admiration to Venezuelan 
patriots who are fighting against reaction." 
Dr. Castro called President Romulo Betan-
court of Venezuela "an imperialistic puppet" 
and predicted victory for the pro-Castro 
forces in Venezuela "sooner or later, as in 
Algeria." 
He proclaimed also "our fraternal salute" 
for pro-Castro groups in Guatemala. 
However, Dr. Castro denied?as he has in 
the past?that Cuba was exporting its revo-
lution. 
In the case of Venezuela, he asserted, 
"when patriots needed money and arms they 
took them away from the soldiers and im-
perialists." 
He added that ideas cannot be stopped and 
that Cuba was a "source of light for Latin 
American Indians and peasants." 
UNITED STATES ACCUSED OF RENEGING 
MIAMI, July 26.?Premier Fidel Castro 
charged today that the United States, had 
reneged in the deal to obtain the freedom of 
the Bay of Pigs invasion prisoners. 
"We accuse the American Government of 
not complying with its agreement and that 
it owes us $10 million," the Cuban Premier 
told a mass rally in Havana. 
Dr. Castro said in a broadcast heard here 
that the price agreed upon for the more than 
1,000 prisoners taken in the 1961 invasion 
was $53 million but that only $43 million in 
goods had been paid. 
The final installment was delivered to 
Cuba last month by the American Red Cross. 
The U.S. Government approved the deal but 
slid not sponsor it.

COLOMBIA RIVALS VENEZUELA AS CASTRO 
TARGET 
Colombia appears to be rivaling Venezuela 
as an embattled target of Castro-Communist 
subversion, judging by increasing guerrilla 
activity in that Andean country. 
On July 15, a group of Colombians who 
had recently returned from indoctrination 
courses in Cuba launched guerrilla attacks 
at Jamundi and El Cerrito, Department of 
Valle. A Colombian Army patrol engaged 
the guerrillas, killed five and wounded two, 
and confiscated considerable material of a 
revealing character. 
Included in the confiscated matter were 
"Che" Guevara's guerrilla warfare manual; 
S mimeographed "10- Commandments of 
Guerrilla Warfare" abbreviated from the 
manual; instructions for making bombs 
capable of destroying bridges and trains; 
and a rubber stamp with the legend, "Chief 
of Staff of the Revolutionary-Army. Victory 
or Death." Also found were Cuban news-
papers; Colombian pro-Castro magazines; a 
book called "We Organize the Revolution in 
Colombia," by the Communist Party head, 
Gilberto Viera White; and maps of western 
Colombia and other regions (where new 
guerrilla actions are evidently planned ).

June 18 at the dedication of a new ffeet of

There have been reports, also, that French-

forces with Cru-ban exiles in destroying the 
Dilvalier dictatorship and then taking on 
Cuba, using Haiti as a base. 
Ever since the Cuban leader's return from 
his 40-day trip in the Soviet 'anion, he has 
displayed new confidence In his "secure" 
position. 
His June 4 radio and television interview 
in Havana, texts of which are not available, 
are most revealing of this confidence of 
complete Soviet backing, his assertion that 
Cuba was the victor In the October 1962, 
missile confrontation, his conviction of the 
economic superiority of the Socialist camp, 
and his high impression of Premier Khru-
shchev as a political and economic genius. 
Referring to the possibility of talks with 
the United States to "normalize" Cuban-
United States relations, Premier Castro says 
he will accept no preconditions to the talks 
but would set several himself, because, after 
all, he asserted, the United States was the 
loser in October and November. 
"They [the United States] prepared sub-
versions," he said in his June 4 interviews, 
"and we combated them. We crushed them.

CUBA SHIPS ARMS FOR LATIN REVOLTS 
(By Hal Hendrix) 
Communist Cuba has established a secret 
weapons arsenal in Matanzas Province and 
is exporting surplus U.S. arms from it to 
guerrilla forces in Central and South Amer-
ica, President Kennedy has been advised in a 
hard intelligence report. 
Weeks of probing, including undetected 
cloak-and-dagger surveillance of one recent 
shipment of weapons smuggled from Cuba 
into Nicaragua, went into preparation of the 
report, the Miami News learned yesterday. 
The highly classified document, written 
especially for President Kennedy, pinpointed 
clandestine movements of rifles, pistols, and 
automatic weapons and ammunition from 
four Cuban dispersal centers to nine Latin 
American nations?Nicaragua, Honduras, 
Venezuela, Brazil, Colombia, Peru, Ecuador, 
Paraguay, and Bolivia. 
Accompanying the smuggled arms have 
been hundreds of copies of a manual written 
by Maj. Ernesto (Che) Guevara, entitled "La 
Guerra de Guerrillas," a handbook on Com-
munist-style guerrilla warfare. 
The Argentine-born Guevara is a key strat-
egist for international communism in Cuba. 
The presidential intelligence report noted 
that the arsenal in Matanzas was set up last 
February on orders of Guevara. 
Its sole mission was to serve as a collection 
center and reconditioning depot for surplus 
U.S.-made weapons in Cuba, and shipping 
point for Latin American subversion. 
Since the depot-arsenal began operations 
nearly all the U.S.-made weapons and am-
munition Fidel Castro Inherited from the 
Batista regime have' been moved into the 
facility for reconditioning and packing for 
shipment to pro-Castro elements abroad. 
ALSO GET BRIT/SH,, DOMINICAN GUNS 
Along with the U.S. armaments, the Castro 
forces have _rounded up all available weap-
? ons . of Dzitlsil manufacture and rifles from

lninican Republic and processed them 
?through the closely guarded arsenal. 
Batista's armed forces operated almost en-
tirely with U.S.-made weapons. During 
Castro's 2-year hit-and-run guerrilla war 
against the Batista forces, most of his rebel 
arms also carne from the United States. 
When the Batista regime was toppled, his 
weapons warehouses are reported to have 
contained about 9,000 M-1 Garand rifles, 
2,500 Thompson submachineguns, 1,500 
carbines, 8,000 automatic pistols (.45 caliber) , 
1,000 Dominican San Cristobal rifles and a 
relatively small number of British Enfield 
rifles. 
Cuba got the U.S. weapons under hemis-
pheric mutual defense pacts, supervised by 
the Inter-American Defense Board, 
The United States formerly maintained a 
military mission in Cuba to instruct the 
armed forces in uses of the armaments. The 
mission was withdrawn at Castro's request 
shortly after he came to power in Jan-
uary 1959. 
Until Castro received large shipments of 
rifles from Belgium in 1959 and subsequent 
heavy supplies of Soviet bloc arms, particu-
larly automatic weapons from Czechoslo-
vakia, the U.S. weapons that fell in is 
hands were used by his armed forces and 
early militia units. 
Cuba's military muscle now has been 
standardized with all Soviet and Czech fire-
power, functioning under a Czech-style 
table of organization created late last year 
with the guidance of an imported Spanish-
born Communist military strategist, "Gen." 
Enrique Lister. ' 
NEXT TO ARSENAL FOR INSPECTION 
Upon completion of the standardization, 
Castro and Guevara ordered all "foreign" 
weapons delivered to the new Matanzas Ar-
senal for "repairs, inspection, and storage." 
The word "foreign" in Cuba today is syn-
onymous with the United States. 
The storage phase of the directive has been 
brief, according to the intelligence findings. 
From the arsenal-depot the revitalized 
U.S. Weapons are shipped directly to other 
Latin America points or moved first to 
terminals in Havana, Cienfuegos and Santi-
ago. 
Oceangoing launches are the principal 
means of transportation for the weapons 
destined for Castro's subversive agent. 
Some have gone by air. 
Shipments usually are small, sometimes 
packed carefully among general cargo and 
hidden between bags of exported sugars 
U.S. Navy destroyers and destroyer es-
corts still maintain an arms smuggling pa-
trol off the Caribbean coast of Central Amer-
ica. 
Some of Castro's smuggling boats are 
known to have eluded the patrol. A few oth-
ers have been allowed to "escape" for sur-
veillance purposes. 
Last month U.S. intelligence agents ob-
served one .shipment of. U.S. weapons from 
Cuba secreted into a secluded Pacific coast 
area of Nicaragua. 
A. Cuban ship in the 3,500-ton class, work-
ing its way down Mexican west coast ports 
with general cargo, one dark night slipped 
into the Gulf of Fonesca, g deepwater 
harbor which touches the coasts of Hon-
duras, El Salvador, and Nicaragua. 
Three small motorboats drifted alongside 
the Cuban ship and boxes were lowered into 
them. The shipments weighed close to a ton. 
Each small boat eased away bearing loads 
weighing between 600 and 700 pounds. 
Manning the small unlighted boats were 
fishermen from the tiny Salvadorean island 
of Meanguera, where the Cuban packages 
were hidden until colleagues set up transfer 
of the weapons to the Nicaraguan coastal 
town of Chinandega. 
Once in Chinandega the shipment was 
taken over by about 20 men who smuggled 
it into the mountains for distribution to 
peasant supporters. 
Intelligence sources learned that this par-
ticular shipment, typical of others reaching 
the Central American area from the Matan-
zas Arsenal, was about 100 U.S. M-1 rifles, a 
small number of .45-caliber automatic pistols 
and subma,chineguns, a substantial number 
of boxes of .30- and .45-caliber ammunition, 
and an undetermined number of cases of 
grenades. 
In Central America, as elsewhere along the 
Castro subversion path, the idea appears to 
be that the U.S.-made weapons provide an 
almost perfect cover from detection by Latin 
American authorities. 
Smuggling of Cuba's Czech-made arms 
would be a certain giveaway to the source of 
supply. 
On the Caribbean side of the Central 
American coastline, the report notes that the 
most probable relay point for the Cuban 
smuggling is a tiny key near the island of 
Cozumel, just south of the eastern tip of 
Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. 
PERT/ INFILTRATED WITH SMALL ARMS 
U.S. intelligence also has gathered informa-
tion about clandestine shipments of small 
arms into Peru recently by way of Bolivia 
and Brazil smuggling networks. 
Close study is being given to reports reach-
ing the intelligence analysts that occasional 
small arms shipments are being delivered by 
Soviet bloc ships putting in at Mexican, 
Colombian, Ecuadoran and Brazilian ports 
and at Georgetown, British Guiana, after 
sailing from Havana. 
So far there has not been a hard confirma-
tion of the Soviet involvement. 
The violent but short-lived rebellion 
against the Venezuelan Government of 
President Romulo Betancourt last month at 
Carupano was linked to Castro's spreading 
subversion operations. 
It is believed by Venezuelan and United 
States intelligence that the weapons used by 
the pro-Castro-Communist forces against the 
Betancourt regime probably came from the 
Matanzas arsenal. The anti-Betancourt 
forces were well stocked with U.S.-made 
weapons. 
Guerrilla forces operating in southern and 
eastern Venezuela also are believed to have 
been supplied with armaments from Castro's 
"surplus" stockpile. 
Some of the weapons are said to have been 
smuggled into Venezuela from Cuba by way 
of British Guiana, whose Premier Cheddi ,Ja-
gan is an ardent supporter of Castro and 
Communist Cuba. 
Also linked to the Cuban arms exporting 
activities are guerrilla fighters harassing 
the backlands of Colombia.

CASTRO THESIS: REDS TUG AMERICAS 
(By Bertram B. Johansson) 
An increasing Communist threat to Latin 
America is ominously indicated as an end 
result of Premier Fidel Castro's visit to the 
Soviet Union, now coming to a close. 
Texts of speeches and communiques now 
available disclose specifically how the two 
Communist countries intend to support so-
called national liberation movements in 
Latin America. 
An examination of Premier Castro's 
speeches in the Soviet Union indicates he 
has been completely won over to the thesis, 
If he had not been before, that communism 
is in the ascendancy in the world today and 
that capitalism's decay is inevitable. 
Soviet Premier Nikita S. Khrushchev, 
dilating on. the theme, promised military 
weapons to such "liberation" movements. 
In his May 23 speech in Moscow, the So-
viet Premier said that "the Soviet Union 
and all socialist countries see their interna-
tional duty in rendering all-out support and 
comprehensive help to the national libera-
tion movement. 
ATTEMPTS REPORTED 
"What does it mean to render help to the 
national liberation movement?" Premier 
Khrushchev asks proceeding then to answer 
his own question. 
"It means, first of all, to struggle against 
the- interference of imperialism in the in-
ternal affairs of peoples of the liberated 
countries, to lend all-out support, including 
supply of arms, to the peoples who are -waging 
a just struggle against the foreign. yoke. 
Second, it means to oppose any. form of neo-
colonialism, to help the peoples of the young 
states develop the economy of their coun-
tries, to lend all-out support to these coun-
tries in the international arena." 
As an indication this has already begun, 
there have been three reports by correspond:-
ents on the scene in the Dominican Republic 
of insistent and persistent attempts by 
Communists to infiltrate the democratically 
oriented government of President Bosch. 
One correspondent asserts that some of 
these attempts may, indeed, have already 
succeeded, though others report that right-
ists have been supporting Communist strikes 
and then charging the Bosch government 
has been too tolerant of such strikes. 
STRIKE CALLED 
In Peru this month, a group of young 
revolutionaries, including Javier Heraud 
Perez, a promising poet from a wealthy 
family, who had all been trained in Cuba 
in subversive guerrilla techniques, infiltrated 
back into Peru with weapons, funds, and 
guerrilla supplies. 
When they attempted to shoot their way 
through a hotel lobby in the jungle village 
of Puerto Maldonado near the Bolivian bor-
der, two were killed and the others captured 
and killed in the next few days. 
In British Guiana where Marxist Prime 
Minister Cheddi Jagan has attempted to 
rush through legislation giving the govern-
ment the power to choose labor unions that 
would negotiate with employers, democrati-
cally oriented labor unions have caned a 
general strike which now enters its seventh 
week. 
PRISONER ESCAPES 
Thus far, Prime Minister Jagan has shown 
no signs of yielding on the issue. Garbage 
has begun to pile up in the streets of George-
town, the mails are going awry, foodstuffs 
are in short supply, and the British Ma-
rines are on hand to head off torrid riots 
such as occurred there last year. 
In Caracas, Venezuela, where Communist 
terrorists have carried on a campaign to 
destroy confidence in the Betancourt gov-
ernment, another instance of what police 
have to deal with occurred Tuesday. 
Winston Bermudez Machado, a pro-Com-
munist student, held for stealing 3500,000 
worth of French impressionist paintings 
from a French Government exhibit in Ca-
racas, obtained permission to enter a court-
house bathroom, before his trial, disguised 
himself there as a woman, and camly walked 
out past his guards to freedom.

CASTRO STIRS REVOLUTION 
HAVANA.---Cuba's leaders are predicting 
that all Latin America will fall under the 
red banner of communism before long. For 
one, they believe the days of President Betan-
court of Venezuela are numbered. 
But their course of action has run into 
resistance from other Latin-American Com-
munists who prefer peaceful coexistence for 
the moment. 
In the words of the Cuban leaders, the 
times call for action, not theories. As Pre-
mier Fidel Castro's newspaper Revolucien 
put it:

Mier Casti-o, urging more action and less talk 
in the drive for revolution. He also asked 
his admirers' to "cre-ate subjective conditions" 
which would trigger the upheavals in Latin

MarxiscLeidiiist 'theoreticians claim the

overthrow their exploiters and establish a 
dictatorsh:IP of the proletariat. These creeds 
were developed in the days of the European 
industrial rev-ohition, giving little or no 
thought to Latin America. 
There being no large proletariat in Latin 
America, the shortest-way to a Red future is 
revolution, Cuban leaders feel. 
..  
_ iii:riMOrrwr ASSAILED 
Most followers Of Premier Castro appear 
confident President Betancourt soon will fall. 
The armed forays of the "National Liberation 
Front" of Venezuela are prominently fea-
tured in the Havana press. The reader is 
left wondering what keeps President Betan-
court in power. 
Deputy Premier Raul Castro has said "the 
Cuban revolution is the revolution of 200 
illion Latin Americans." 
What Quba is doing to export revolution 
In Latin America was indicated in a state-
ment by John A. McCone, head of the U.S. 
Central Intelligence Agency, made public in 
Washington last week. Mr. McCone said 
from 1,000 to 1,500 went to Cuba in 1962 for 
training as guerrillas and more went this 
year. Mr. McCone said most came from 
Venezuela, Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador, Argen-
tina, and Bolivia. 
Many Western diplomats believe the Cuban 
leaders have told Communist parties in Latin 
America:- either -share Havana's revolution 
view and- count on Cuban support or fall 
back oh Pearroaar - coexistence and lose Pre-
mier Castle's favor. 
Premier Casifro-has already censured some 
unnamed- P-artieg who ignored his "Second 
Declaration of Havana," a document de-
scribed as the "Castro-Coriimunist manifesto 
of the Americas." 
A diplomat illustrated it this way; "The 
future of the Chban revolution depends on 
the fact that Cuba, 'first socialist country in 
the Americas, doe's not becoriie the last one.'" 
.? 
_op:Tx:ton fmcno&T_ED 
Another one said that although voicing ad-
miration for his Movement, not many Latin 
American Communist Parties feel like follow-
- ing the Castro example. They prefer to live 
in peaceful coexistence with other parties, 
frequently forming "popular fronts." 
? It was noted last week that while Brazilian 
Peasant League leader, Francisco JuliAo, said 
? there was "no other exit but armed struggle" 
? in Latin America, Luis Prestes, secretary of 
Brazil's Communist Party, also in Havana at

to Red guerrillas, according to Scripps-How-

datelined Georgetown, British Guiana, said 
18 known airfields were receiving the hard-
ware from Cuba, and many more are scat-
tered in recondite jungle areas. American 
submachineguns, issued to Batista forces in 
1958, showed up in the recent disturbances 
in British Guiana. They could only come 
from Cuba. This is precisely what President 
Kennedy said that the United States would

he is, tolerating. 
TRIBUTE TO SENATOR KEATING 
Mr. JORDAN of Idaho. Mr. President,

Mr. KEATING. I yield. 
Mr. JORDAN of Idaho. I congratu-
late the distinguished junior Senator 
from New 'York for his clear, c-on?cise 
statement in support of the ratification 
of the treaty. 
I also wish to congratulate him on the 
anniversary, today, of the passage by 
Congress of the joint resolution on Cuba. 
We are all aware of the- diligence and 
persistence with which the junior Sena-
tor from New York pursued this subject 
until the purpose was accomplished. 
I also wish to commend him? for ably 
filling the role of Chaplain yesterday 
morning, when he opened the Senate 
with prayer. The Senator from New 
York is an outstanding and worthwhile 
statesman. 
Mr. KEATING. I am most grateful to 
my dear colleague for his kind remarks. 
They mean much to me. 
-there was a 'relaxation, and an attempt 
was made to discourage ships of the free 
world from trading with Cuba. I must 
suggest rt has been a serious attempt, 
with some progress Made on the part of 
the administration, the Department of 
State, and the President. In many cases, 
the contracts for delivery had previously 
been made, and the ships were making 
deliveries. 
The United States has notified the gov-
ernments of the free world which allow 
their ships to enter Cuba that those ships 
would not be allowed to enter American 
ports and discharge or load American 
cargo. 
This has had an effect on some nations 
and on some of the ships that had been 
entering Cuba. However, it does not 
affect all of them, because in many cases 
the ships do not come, or do not care to 
come, to United States ports. Some na-
tions have joined with the United States 
in the attempt to discourage shipping to 
Cuba, and there has been a gradual en-
closure of maritime activities into and 
out of the island by the nations of the 
free world, although not sufficient, so far 
as I personally am concerned, in accord-
ance with my views. In all fairness, 
however. I must say that some progress 
has been made. 
In many cases, the nations involved 
have little or no control over the ships 
that may be flying their flags. Some-
time a ship may fly the flag of Panama, 
of Greece, or of another country, yet 
never touch any of the ports of the coun-
try whose flag they fly or the country 
in which the ship is registered. So there 
are complexities. 
However, I am hopeful that the na-
tions of the free world will continue their 
efforts to discourage such shipping to 
the point where there will be a complete 
economic blockade, with perhaps only 
the rare exception of a shipment of medi-
cal supplies or similar shipments. 
Some of the unions and union leaders, 
'whom I mentioned in previous remarks 
concerning agreements that have been 
made for future relations in the mari-
time industry, have been urging their 
fellow workers in other parts of the world 
not to load ships destined for Cuba. 
There have been some memorable exam-
ples of refusal to load such ships. 
Nevertheless, the practice is still occur-
ring. 
Occasionally, I have placed in the 
RECoRD, when the information has been 
made available to me, lists of ships from 
the free world that have been plying 
into and out of Cuba. I have listed the 
names of the ships, their gross tonnage, 
and the flags they fly. This information 
has been supplied not only for the benefit 
of Congress and the American people, 
but also for the benefit of representatives 
of those countries in-Washington. Our 
hope has been that much more might be 
done to improve the situation than is 
being done. 
Today I wish to place in the RECORD 
a list of free world and Polish-flag ships 
that have entered and departed from 
Cuba since January 1, 1963. The list 
contains the names of the ships, their 
tonnage, and their flag registry. 
FOREIGN SHIPMENTS TO CUBA 
Mr. MAGNUSON. Mr. President, I 
have spoken several times since the be-
ginning of this session of Congress about 
our problems in this hemisphere as they 
relate to shipments to the island of Cuba. 
At one time, the U.S. Government en-
forced a strong blockade, following the

not more than 75 widely-scattered pages 
are devoted to reasons why we should 
appfove this treaty. All the rest deal 
with refuting, examining, explaining 
away, and delineating the many disad-
vantages that could accrue to this co1l-
1 try. This fact alone is quite significant. 
1 We have had no problem of finding out 
what the treaty does not do; the problem 
has been in pinpointing just what it does 
do. 
Here is my list of the things its pro-
ponents say it does: 
First. The treaty will help contain the 
spread of nuclear weapons. 
Second. The treaty will help slow 
down the arms race between the United 
States and the Soviet Union. 
Third. The treaty will ease tension in 
the world and create a better atmosphere 
that would be conducive to the estab-
lishment of peace, in contrast to a nu-
clear war; or?as stated differently by 
some proponents, but essentially the 
same thing?the treaty will open up new 
paths toward future agreements between 
the free world and the Communist world. 
Fourth. The treaty must be approved 
by the Senate, because its rejection at 
this point would cause world opinion to 
turn violently against the United States. 
"It is practically impossible to find this 
reason Stated in plain language by any 
backers of the treaty. But, in my opin-
ion, it is one of the most important of all 
the threads which run throughout all the 
proponents' thinking. 
Fifth. The treaty will reduce the ra-
dioactive pollution of the planet. 
Mr. President, let us examine, one by 
one, the five points-put forward by the 
proponents. 
I ask my colleagues to bear in mind 
that each time I shall quote a statement 
in regard to these five points, it will be 
a statement made by a proponent of the 
treaty. If I had wanted to refute these 
five points, I could have found many 
statements to do that. I could have 
turned to what the distinguished senior 
Senator from Georgia [Mr. RUSSELL] 
has said. As the highly respected and 
eminently capable chairman of the 
-Armed Services Committee for many 
years, his opinion in U.S. military mat-
ters is seldom challenged. Or I could 
have quoted another great Senator, 
the junior Senator from Mississippi [Mr. 
SrEmus], who, as chairman of the Pre-
paredness Investigating Subcommittee, 
has for many months been holding hear-
ings on the whole realm of a test ban 
treaty. Also, I could have leaned on the 
many sound statements made by a mem-
ber of my own political party, the Senator 
from Arizona [Mr. GOLD WATER], who, as 
a major general in the Air Force Reserve, 
is also knowledgeable in such matters. 
I did not do this. 
My intent is to be as objective as pos-
sible. So I turned to the testimony of 
high-ranking officials, competent scien-
tists, and dedicated military leaders who, 
I knew, favored this test ban treaty. 
I wanted to see what they thought the 
treaty really would do?what they listed 
on the "pro" side of the ledger. I shall 
now proceed to state what some of these 
proponents say in reference to the five 
things the treaty is purported to do:

THE NUCLEAR TEST BAN TREATY 
The Senate resumed the consideratio 
o Exectitive M (88th cong, 1st sess.) , 
the treaty banning nuclear weapon testa 
in the atmosphere, in outer _space, and 
Underwater. 
Mr. JORDAN of Idaho, IVIr. Presi-
dent, I rise today to take myself out of 
the ranks of the "uncommitted," with 
reference to the question of Senate ap-
proval of the test ban treaty, and to 
? 811110AnCe that I intend to vote "nay" on 
? this question. 
I take this position with great reluc-
tance, because I have sincerely hoped 
that in good conscience I could support 
the treaty. No one is more eager than 
I for aselaxatiim of word tensions and 
for a stap?howcver srnallz.--toward peace 
with honor. And I would gladly vote 
for approval of this treaty if it provided 
for adequate inspection.. 
, 
EVQ.11 though the vote, as always, will 
be determined by the yeas and nays, 
the 0914;its and the uncertainties and the 
hopes and the prayers do not lend them-
selves to a clearcut decision. All we can 
hope for is that the weight of the deci-
sion will best be borne by each Senator 
as his own conscience dictates, Even 
though this issue divides 1.1s, our ,common 
objective is an enduring peace. . 
-,'er gtere th 9 14 a week the senate has 
? been paged m.dehate on the question 
of Senate apprlOvai of this treaty?per-
haps the most important and far-reach-
ing question to be before this ,body since 
World War IL: Both the proponents 
and the opponents of the treaity have 
4 
been heard; many speeches have been 
made, and many pledges, either for or 
against the treaty, have been given. 
Many Senators who have taken the 
Senate floor to speak either for or against 
the treaty have eminently more knowl-
edge than I have about the present mili-
tary posture of our country, how it com-
pares with that of the Soviet Union, and 
the effect the treaty could have on its 
future. 
Not having served on any Senate com-
mittee which dealt directly with the 
treaty, I found myself in a position com-
parable in many ways to that of a lay-
man who would be called upon to make 
a decision as to how to cast his vote. To 
compensate for this, I have done what 
I am sure all other Senators have done?
read all the testimony available to me; 
spoken at length with men such as Am-
bassador Averell Harriman, an avid sup-
porter of treaty; and talked as much as 
possible with men such as Dr. Edward 
Teller, a dedicated and sincere opponent 
of the treaty in its present form. 
Because I always like to approach a 
problem positively, I began making a 
list of all the reasons why this country 
should, with the advice And consent of 
the Senate, become a party to this treaty. 
That was?and still is?an almost im-
possible job, although not for the reason 
some may think?namely, that the list 
is long and involved with many ex-
planations. On the contrary, the list 
is extremely short; and the advantages 
involved almost defy definition in plain 
English, and are qualified time after 
time. For the most part, even those who 
espouse these reasons seem to have grave 
doubts about their credibility. 
My list was gleaned primarily from 
the testimony given before the Foreign 
Relations Committee. Incidentally, I 
would venture to guess that out of some 
1010 pages of testimony and statements,

16724 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
The first argument gf the proponents 
is that the treaty wilr help contain the 
spread of nuclear weapons. 
Mr. President, let us examine the rec-
ord. 
?peeretary Rusk said: 
We cannot guarantee it. Most of the coun-
tries with the capacity and the incentive to 
develop nuclear weapons over the next dec-
ade or so have already announced that they 
will accept the self-denying ordinanee of the 
treaty. These countries do not include, by 
the way, mainland China or France. 
Mr. Rusk was evidently not completely 
convinced. 
Secretary McNamara said: 
The treaty does not cover the subject of 
proliferation. That is clear. The treaty re-
lates to nuclear tests and certain prohibited 
environments. 
If the treaty does not cover the sub-
ject of proliferation of nuclear weapons, 
how could it even begin to deal effeo-
tively -with this problem? 
General LeMay said, in answer to a 
question about what influence the treaty 
would have on the stoppage of 'a prolif-
eration of nuclear weapons: 
I think it possibly would, among the 
countries that have no serious programs on 
them. I don't think it is going to stop the 
Chinese from going on with their program. 
Certainly it is not going to stop the French 
from going on with their program. 
So I believe this interpretation to be 
something less than wholehearted sup-
port on a most significant point. 
Other articulate proponents of the 
treaty have said they believed. the role 
of the treaty in inhibiting proliferation 
has been generally overestimated. They 
have pointed out that most of the coun-
tries who,,have signed the test ban have 
neither the capacity nor the desire to de-
velop nuclear weapons. 
My conclusion on this point had to be 
that if, indeed, the treaty would have 
any effect on the further proliferation of 
nuclear weapons, such an effect would 
be so small as to be almost negligible?
so small that the proponents had not 
been able to support the statement be-
yond reatonable doubt. 
The second argument of the propo-
nents is that the treaty will help slow 
down the arms race between the United 
States and the Soviet Union. 
Mr. President, if that is true, this in-
deed would be an admirable objective. 
Secretary Rusk said: 
This treaty itself does not reduce weapons 
In being or prevent their further production. 
This treaty is aimed only' at the question 
of nuclear explosions. I regret Myself that 
it has not been possible to make greater 
headway in some actual physical- disarma-
ment measures consistent with our own 
security. 
But this treaty is not a step In that di-
rection?this treaty is not itself dealing with 
that problem. It may turn, out -to be one 
small step that opens up some possibili-
ties in this field but that has not yet become 
apparent. 
Secretary McNamara said, in almost 
the same breath when he was talking 
about more money for defense and the 
continued military preparedness of our 
country: 
This treaty ? ? ? will not reduce the 
existing stockpiles of nuclear weapons. It 
will not halt the production of nuclear 
weapons. It Will not prevent qualitative 
weapons improvement of many kinds. 
The testimony on this point leaves 
little more than a slender hope. 
The third argument of tie proponents 
is that the treaty will ease tensfon in 
the world and create a better atmosphere 
that would be conducive to the estab-
lishment of peace in contrast to a nu-
clear war; or, stated differently by some 
proponents, this treaty will open up new 
paths toward future agreements between 
the pee world and the Communist world. 
Secretary Rusk, this Nation's highest 
ranking diplomat, said: 
If it should work to reduce those tensions, 
as I think that it well might, and if it makes 
it possible to consider additional points of 
agreement carefully considered and thought-
fully worked out on both sides, then I think 
that there could be a reduction in the real 
danger of nuelear war. BUt I do want to 
say, sir, that we are not over the divide on 
this, and anything that we say on this could 
be wrong tomorrow morning at 9 o'clock. 
Again, later in his testimony, he said: 
But I might have misled the committee a 
little bit in my earlier remarks, because 
when I said that I thought they [the Rus-
sians] were ready to explore the possibility 
of agreement on other points, that still is 
subject to the great reservation: On what 
terms. 
And I must say that I do not see ahead of 
us in the immediate future agreements on 
some of these major and dangerous Issues 
on terms that -could really be agreed by the 
two sides ? ? la 
The gap is very wide. 
General LeMay, in answer to whether 
or not we would be closer to or further 
from nuclear war if the treaty were not 
ratified, said: 
I don't think we are any farther or any 
closer to a nuclear war with or without the 
test ban treaty. 
Later, the general continued: 
If it leads to additional steps to reduce 
tension, then I think you would have to say 
that we withdraw from the possibilities of 
war. 
But in itself alone, I don't think it is 
enough of weight to say it has changed the 
situation at all. 
Again, I find the testimony hanging on 
a thread of hope. 
We do not create the tensions. The 
Soviets do. They have taken not even 
one small step to relax tensions. It is 
even possible that, under the treaty, ten-
sions might be increased rather than 
diminished. Are we not pledged to con-
tinue the perfection of our weapons sys-
tem under limitations imposed on us by 
the treaty?not knowing when or where 
other signers?or nonsigners?will, by 
their deceit or aggression, force us to 
withdraw? 
The fourth point of the proponents is 
as follows: This treaty must be ratified 
by the Senate because its rejection at 
this point would cause world opinion to 
turn violently against the United States. 
Secretary Rusk said: 
I think there would be very great regret 
If this treaty were to collapse. 
But, on the other hand, where we are 
dealing with a security matter that goes to 
the life of our own country, I do not believe 
September 20 
that world opinion can play a decisive role. 
We must do what has to be done, and I be-
lieve that the rest of the world will under-
stand. ? * ? 
I think that there would be general un-
derstanding, even if with great regret, there 
would be general understanding if we came 
to the conclusion that this treaty was not 
working and that our security required us 
to resume testing. 
General Wheeler, in response to a 
question as to whether or not his deci-
sion to back the treaty had been influ-
enced by the fact the treaty had already 
been signed, said: 
It undoubtedly introduces a new factor. 
CM the other hand, insofar as affecting the 
overall military security of the United 
States, it has no bearing whatsoever. And 
the primary concern of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff is to point out dangers to our security--
those which are acceptable, and those which 
are not. 
In later testimony; he took a slightly 
different tack: 
I would agree that world opinion has built 
up to the point where there would be very 
sizable political implications if the United 
States were to dash these hopes. I am not 
prePared to say exactly what the effect of 
those political implications or the political 
effect would be, but I do not think it would 
be good. 
General LeMay had a somewhat dif-
ferent opinion about 'the importance of 
what the rest of the world thought re-
garding ratification. This evidently had 
colored his own ultimate decision on the 
test ban treaty. At this point, so that it 
cannot be said that I am quoting the 
general out of context in any way, I 
would like to repeat a dialog between 
him and the able Senator from South 
Carolina [Mr. THURMOND] : 
Senator THURMOND. Thank you, Mx. Chair-
man. 
General LeMay, Senator GOLDWATER asked 
a question similar to one I propounded in 
the Preparedness Subcommittee. That is 
this: If the proposed treaty had not already 
been signed, but was being considered in a 
proposal stage, would you recommend that 
the United States sign the treaty? 
General LEMAY. I haven't given any 
thought to the subject. Senator. I maid I 
would?I thought I would not be in favor of 
it. But I wouldn't even want to give an 
unqualifieff "No" until I spent some time on 
It. Certainly this was a factor that influ-
enced me in recommending that we ratify it. 
How much weight I would give to it?I would 
want to spend a considerable amount of 
time on this, and I have not done so. 
Senator THURMOND. I believe your answer 
In the subcommittee, and I quote, was this: 
"I think that if we were in a proposal stage 
that I would not recommend?that I would 
recommend against it." 
That is correct, is it not? 
General LEMAY. I think I would. That is 
correct. 
I do not like the suggestion of outside 
pressures. My feelings on this are ex-
pressed for me much better than 1 my-
self can do by a recent column written 
by David Lawrence entitled "Too Late 
for Senate To Advise." 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have this article included in the 
RECORD at this point in my remarks. 
There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows:

The cepAtitution gays the President "shall 
have power, by and with the advice and 
consent Of MO Senate, to Make treaties." 
There is no evidence that the text of the 
limited Unclear_ test ban treaty signed in 
Moscow recently was ever submitted in ad-
vance to the Senate so that it eould tender 
its adviCe before the document was signed. 
There_ is no evidence, either, that the text 
was sliown to all the members of the Joint 
Chiefs of Staff before It was initialed and 
then signed at Moscow. Gen. Curtis LeMay, 
Chief of the U.S. Air Force, told a Senate 
-conifinttee usterday, that "I think I would 
have been Against" the treaty if it had not 
already been signed. He added that "the fact 
-that It rigs. beep signed had an effect on 
Me, yes," 'because "there might be some po-
litical disadvantage if we don't ratify it." 
? This frar* observatti indicates clearly 
that, once the signature of the executive 
' branch of the Government has been affixed 
? to it treaty, there itreally no opportunity to 
render at/74.M The Senate, for instance, can 
only ratify or reject._ There is no chance to 
? amend or inwlify the terms except by a new 
negotiation, which, of course, is difficult and 
ten impractical. 
Bo Senator- HaRay OoLowArza, of Arizona, 
Republican, was right in his speech last 
Priciay. night at the University of Wisconsin 
When he Characterized the support of the 
Joint Chiefs_ for the nuclear treaty as a 
political evaluation, ?He said: _

tion of their own report. It flatly says: 
'There are military disadvantages to the

"The mention of risks, I say, Is a con-
scientious military evaluation. The decision 
that the risks...are acceptable is not. It is an 
echo of a State Department evaluation and 
not of one that ...necessarily sounds very 
deeply the real evaluations of our profes-
sional railitari men," 
The Oftichtl Staternent of the. Joint Chiefs 
of Staff says pointedly that the risks inherent 
in the treaty an be accepted "if adequate 
safeguards are established." Now the de-
bate has begun as to what the "safeguards" 
- ere argi Where the responsibility for provid-
ing them is to be placed. General LeMay 
testined that po one Ilas said as yet what

committees have asked._ that the administra-

Chairman Of the Armed Services Committee,

T-
SENATE 
, test ban negotiations, General LeMay testi-
fied that he wa.S.Slarprised at the administra-
tion's speed in hastening the final agreement 
-toward the end. As for voicing objections, 
General LeMay declared that once the pact 
was initialed or about to be, he doubted very 
much "that any of us would have gone to 
the President at that stage of the game." 
Secretary of State Rusk, at a news confer-
ence last Friday, was asked whether there 
wasn't "an unresolved difference in this 
Government" on the treaty, and he replied: 
"I'm not sure that I would call such a 
difference unresolved. After all, the execu-
tive branch is headed by the President of the 
United States." 
This is tantamount to saying that, despite 
the military expertness of the members of 
the Joint Chiefs in their respective fields, 
they can be and are overruled by the Presi-
dent and by his civilian advisers who _can 
place political experimentalism in interna-
tional affairs above the necessary safeguards 
against nuclear advances by an adversary 
state. 
The Senate is today presented with a 
"take it or leave it" proposition. The upper 
House of Congress, which is a joint partner 
with the President in treatymaking, wasn't 
afforded an opportunity to give its advice 
before the treaty was signed. Now the treaty 
will have to be ratified, or else the Senate 
will be placed In the position of taking full 
responsibility for the consequences in the 
field of diplomacy. If, on the other hand, 
Russia chooses to cheat or abrogate?as Gen-
eral LeMay says might happen?it will be 
too. late to argue about political factors or 
net military disadvantages of a treaty which 
may have put the United States behind in 
the nucelar-arms race. 
Mr. JORDAN of Idaho. The next 
point of the proponents is as follows: 
This treaty will reduce the radioactive 
pollution of the planet. 
This consideration weights heavily on 
my mind and conscience. This is the 
real purpose of the test ban treaty, at 
least as far as our country and the free 
world is concerned. 
Mr. President, I want the record clear 
on this one point. For many years I 
have been concerned about the question 
of fallout, as have people all over the 
world. One thought I have always had 
in mind is this: It is bad enough that we 
might possibly endanger the lives of our 
own future generations here in America 
with our atmospheric nuclear testing, 
but what is worse is the fact that we, at 
the same time, could be endangering the 
lives of future generations in other coun-
tries which have no control over what 
the United States does. Somehow, this 
has never seemed quite fair to me, and it 
still does not seem equitable. 
This is quite a consideration to weigh 
on any pair of scales?even if itis being 
balanced against all the risks involved 
in our entering into this test ban treaty. 
I agree that the most compelling argu-
ment of the proponents is this conten-
tion that radioactive fallout will be re-
duced by the treaty. With six grand-
children under 7 years of age, how could 
I fail to be moved by this argument? I 
readily admit a deep and abiding con- s 
cern on this issue. 
1tyf_ .211e rpzenLatign?usx-,anci_ it_is 
very grave?is is. 
In order to obtain a temporary relief 
from fallout, are we jeopardizing theS 
16725 
perfection of a weapons system that will 
pre-vent the surprise attack? 
Are we jeopardizing the perfection of 
a weapons system that all the world will 
recognize as one which could survive 
such an attack to retaliate with the com-
plete annihilation of our attacker? 
The essence of the Preparedness In-
vestigating Subcommittee interim report 
is very significant. It is: 
No safeguards can provide the benefits of 
testing where testing Is not permitted, nor 
can they assure that this Nation will ac-
quire the highest quality weapons systems 
of which it is capable when the means for 
achieving that objective are denied. 
Mr. President, on Wednesday of last 
week, after we had listened to the dis-
tinguished minority leader [Mr. DIRK-
SEN] make a most persuasive and, as al-
ways, eloquent speech, in favor of rati-
fication, the Senat*Or from Nebraska [Mr. 
CrixTis] posed this question to the Sen-
ator from Illinois: 
The Senator asked, would "it not be 
possible for another Senator to attend 
the same meetings, hear the sam(testi-
mony, read the same documents, possess 
an equal sincerity of purpose, and yet ar-
rive at a different conclusion from that 
reached by" another Senator? 
The distinguished Senator from Illi-
nois answered thusly: 
Absolutely. That is what makes the world 
the great world that it is. We can listen to 
testimony, come to different conclusions 
about it, and do so honestly and sincerely. 
During this week, a great deal of the 
debate here in the Senate has centered 
on this one situation?that two Senators 
can take the same facts and come up 
with opposite conclusions. The positions 
taken by the seven members of the Pre-
paredness Investigating Subcommittee 
are examples of this situation. Three of 
those seven Senators have declared 
against the treaty; three others have de-
clared in favor of it; and if my facts are 
still accurate, the seventh is still un-
committed. 
In all the testimony that has been 
heard and in all the speeches that have 
been made?
First. No responsible official has based 
his recommendations on the view that 
basic Soviet purposes have changed. To 
the contrary, we have heard constant 
references to statements by Khrushchev 
that he will bury us, and even the Presi-
dent has warned that this treaty should 
in no way make us think that the goal 
of communism has changed. 
Genuine fear has been expressed that 
the so-called rift between the Soviet Un-
ion and Red China may be, by and large, 
a hoax. As our beloved minority leader 
said earlier when the treaty was first ini-
tialed in Moscow, "What has IChrushchey 
done besides smile?" He has not with-
drawn his troops from Cuba; he has not 
relaxed the Berlin situation; he has not 
made concessions toward free elections in 
atellite countries like Hungary and 
Poland. 
Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. President, will the 
Senator yield? 
Mr. JORDAN of Idaho. I yield to the 
enator from Wyoming.

that the Soviet Government can be

Joint Chiefs are on record as seeing net 
military disadvantages?but in the long 
run none so serious as to render the 
treaty unacceptable. 
How disadvantageous does a disadvan-
tage have to be before it is "unaccept-

Mr. JORDAN of Idaho. I am happy

Mr. RUSSELL. I shall be compelled 
to leave the Chamber soon. If the Sen-
ator will permit, I wish to extend to him 
my hearty commendations on his de-
cision and on his very able explanation 
of his reasons for reaching that de-
cision. 
It takes a high degree of moral and 
political courage to breast the stampede 
which is taking place in this country 
today, led by practically all the leaders 
of both political parties who are na-
tionally known. 
It not only is led by those officials and 
former officials whose names are recog-
nized in every household, but it has the 
support of most of the commentators, 
columnists, and newspaper editorialists 
of the great metropolitan press. 
I share the Senator's feeling when he 
says he hopes events will prove that he 
is in error. I hope and pray that the 
future will show that I have been in 
error in taking the position that has 
placed me with the small group with 
which the Senator from Idaho has 
alined himself today. 
I could not but be concernevith the 
fact that yesterday in the United Nations 
Mr. Gromyko again brought forth his 
program for disarmament, with self-in-
spection, reducing and finally abolishing 
all nuclear weapons, without suggesting 
any way of inspection to establish per-
formance. The Russians have not 
changed their position. We become ex-
hausted and gradually accept theirs. 
It is sad to reflect that in 1946 we had 
a complete monopoly in atomic material 
and nuclear weapons, and we offered all 
of those weapons, the results of all of 
the great expenditures we had incurred 
in their production into the bands of an 
international agency, if the other nations 
of the earth would agree not to make 
atomic weapons and would agree to a 
system of inspection.

The Senator knows that the preamble 
to the treaty calls for total demobiliza-

is contained in the preamble itself. 
I am discouraged by the prospect of 
our entering into such a treaty, with no 
safeguards of the kind that should be

I commend the Senator for the very 
able address he has delivered. He has

this treaty as one small step towar 
fulfillment of a universal hope for even 
ual arms control and, peace. 
This hope has been nourished by lead 
ers of both parties through two admin 
istrations. 
This hope was expressed in both 196 
party platforms. 
As stated in the Democratic platform 
"A fragile power balance sustained b 
mutual nuclear terror does not?const 
hate peace." 
Our platform declared it a primal 
task "to develop responsible propose 
that will help break the deadlock on arm 
control," and that "such proposals shoul 
include means for ending nuclear test 
under workable safeguards." 
Scientists advise us that atmospheri 
surface, and underwater tests?whic 
are those tests included in the treaty?
can now readily be detected. 
The Republican platform states spe 
cifically, and I quote: 
We advocate an early agreement by al 
nations to forego nuclear tests in the atmos 
phere, and the suspension of other tests a 
verification techniques permit. 
Failure to ratify the treaty would, as 
the Baltimore Evening Sun stated Mon 
day in a lead editorial "be a repudiatio 
of hope that it is within the power o 
this generation to bring about a limi 
talon or control of armaments." 
Mr. President, such hope does exist. 
Eighty-five nations have to date signed 
the treaty. Three of these nations, th 
United States, Great Britain, and Sovie 
Russia are nuclear powers. Eighty-two 
of the nations do not have nuclear weap-
ons and have no expectation of becoming 
nuclear powers. Yet these 82 nations 
have the hope, and they must also have 
faith, that the 3 nations which do 
have vast arsenals of nuclear weapons 
either in inventory or available, will 
abide to the provisions of the treaty, at 
least during the immediate future. 
Otherwise there would have been no 
reason for them to sign the treaty. The 
treaty itself, as long as it is observed, will 
bring a respite from the fears and dread 
that will increasingly afflict the peoples 
of the world if atmospheric and under-
water testing are continued. 
Two nations which have not signed the 
treaty have aspirations to become nu-
clear powers, Red China and France. 
France already has made a small begin-
ning in the field. Red China has not yet of the Armed Services Pre aredn  
vestigating ,$ubcommittee. I have stud-
ied all of the President's messages, and 
have followed the speeches Senators 
f have made and the debate on this very, 
very important matter. 
While I have long advocated a mora-
torium on atmospheric nuclear testing, 
and while I have been favorably inclined 
toward the treaty from the time when it 
was first negotiated, I have withheld 
final judgment until I have carefully 
studied all the evidence and all the views 
of our Nation's most knowledgeable 
persons. 
In arriving at my decision, I have been 
mpei led by one paramount considera-
ion, and one consideration only: Is this 
reaty in the best interests of America? 
Many factors?military, diplomatic, 
conomic, scientific, sociological, med-

sider self-protection,

- nation will inevitably add to the danger-
ous pollution and add to the cumulative 
0 threat against the health of peoples 
throughout the world. Underwater nu-
clear explosions pose a similar threat to 
y pollution of the oceans. 
I- A nuclear war, we are told, could ex-
terminate the human race. 
w Unchecked nuclear testing

d Mr. President, I shall vote for ratifi-
s cation of this treaty as a step to uphold 
our Nation's just influence on the world. 
C, I waited to digest every bit of testi-
h mony before speaking on this matter bt-
fore committees. 
I wanted to be sure that this would not 
- in any way weaken our defense, now or 
in the future. 
We need to be the strongest military 
- power in the world?this is our great 
s weapon against communism. 
Mr. FONG. Mr. President, I regret 
very much that I was not present in the 
- Chamber to hear the entire speech of the 
n distinguished Senator from Idaho [Mr. 
f JORDAN] who spoke against approval of 
- the test ban treaty. I was able to hear 
only the conclusion of his remarks. I 
felt that it was very well reasoned.. 
Although I have some misgivings about 
e the test ban treaty, I do not have as 
t many misgivings about it as does the 
distinguished and able Senator from 
Idaho; and I will vote for approval of 
the treaty. 
I hope that the many misgivings of the 
Senator from Idaho will not materialize; 
for, if they do, we may find ourselves in 
, serious difficulty. 
Although I disagree with the distin-
guished and able Senator from Idaho, I 
respect him for his very sincere stand 
and for the excellent reasons he has ad-
vanced for the position he has taken. 
Mr. President, for the past few weeks 
I have carefully studied all aspects of the 
treaty suspending thermonuclear testing 
in the atmosphere, in outer space, and 
underwater. 
I have read carefully the extensive 
testimony before the Foreign Relations 
Committee, and also the Committee's re-
port,. I have also read the interim report 
ess In-
could in 
slow sui-
achieved a nuclear device. 
Red China and France have isolated 
themselves from the world accord in ap-
proving this initial step in the cause o 
peace; from the consensus of world-opin-
ion. 
The United States will be similarly 
isolated if this treaty is not ratified. 
inev-ltaoly the good relations which 
we have developed throughout the free 
world, in diplomacy, in trade, in edu-
cational and economic development, 
would in some degree be replaced by 
misgiVings and apprehension. 
Our failure to agree to this treaty 
could not Vat provide an incentive to our 
principal competitor in the nuclear field t 
to resume testing. It would further speed t 
Red China's effort to develop nuclear 
weapons of her own, and in my opinion e 
September 20 
ical, and others?enter into the decision 
as to what constitues the best interests 
of America. After evaluating all these 
factors and after weighing their relative 
importance, each Senator must rendes 
his own judgment and must make his 
own decision in the light of his knowl-
edge, his own experience, and his back-
ground. 
As a representative of our Nation's 
mid-Pacific Island State, whose people 
are, perhaps more than the citizens of 
any other State, acutely sensitive to the 
frightening. dangers of nuclear holocaust 
and the increase of radioactive fallout, 
I have long been deeply concerned that 
means be devised to halt atmospheric 
and underwater nuclear tests. 
It was in the Pacific basin, in 1945, 
that two atomic bombs were dropped?
the first, on the inhabitants of the city 
of Hiroshima; the second, on Nagasaki. 
Because of our geographical proximity 
to, and our close cultural relationships 
with, the people of these two cities, the 
swath of destruction and the terrible 
toll of lives caused by these two atomic 
bombs left an indelible imprint on the 
people of Hawaii. 
Since then, more than 100 thermonu-
clear devices have been tested near 
Hawaii. Between 1946 and 1962, in the 
Bikini, Eniwetok, Johnston, and Christ-
mas Island areas, the United States con-
ducted a series of 92 thermonuclear ex-
plosions in the atmosphere and 6 ther-
monuclear explosions under water. In 
addition, between 1953 and 1958 the 
British tested 21 thermonuclear de-
vices?all of them in the atmosphere?in 
their South Pacific proving grounds. Al-
together, 118 thermonuclear devices 
were tested in the air or under water 
between 1946 and 1962, in the South Pa-
cific area near Hawaii. 
As a result of these Pacific tests and 
tests conducted by other nations during 
the same time, worldwide radioactive 
fallout has increased. 
During the 1954 experimental high-
yield detonations, when a 15-megaton 
device was exploded on the ground at the 
Bikini testsite, unexpected shifts in the 
Pacific wind patters caused heavy radio-
active fallout to irradiate the inhabited 
Marshall Island atolls, just a few hun-
dred miles downwind from the detona-
tion. Two hundred and sixty-seven Mar-
shallese were seriously injured by nearly 
fatal doses of radiation exposure. For-
tunately, all 267 survived, although the 
long-term ill effects will not be known 
for several generations. 
But 23 fishermen aboard the Japanese 
fishing trawler Lucky Dragon were not so 
fortunate. The vessel accidentally sailed 
within 100 miles of the thermonuclear 
explosion. As a result of the heavy fall-
out which blanketed the vessel, all 23 of 
the Japanese fishermen suffered serious 
injuries, and were hospitalized. One 
fisherman died as a result of irradiation. 
The 1954 test resulted in other eco-
nomic and social dislocations, First, the 
injured Marshallese could not be re-
turned to their home islands until radia-
tion subsided?over 3 years later. Sec-
ond, the Japanese seafood market sof 
fered a sharp depression, after it became 
known that 16,500 pounds of tuna and 
Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP65B00383R000100200003-7 
199-3 CO 
shark aboard the ,Lucky Dragon had been 
exposed to radioactive fallout. 
Then, on August 1, 1958, the first high-
altitude America,n test of a missile carry-
ing a thermonuclear warhead of undis-
closed megaton range was launched from 
the Johnston Island area, just 800 miles 
east southeast of Honolulu, Detonated 
at night, without forewarning or prean-
nouncetneht, the missile exploded in a 
fireball so intense and brilliant that it 
alarmed and thoroughly frightened the 
people of Hawaii, when it bathed the en-
tire State in light as bright as daylight. 
During the United States 1962 test 
series, on July 0, Hawaii was again 
bathed in awesome light, when a 110,-
000-pound Thor booster rocket, with a 
thermonuclear warhead capable of an 
explosive force of between 1 and 2 mil-
lion tons of TNT was launched, at night, 
from Johnston Island. 
In addition to ;these detonations, the 
Russians have been test-firing their long-
range Missiles into the Pacific. Some of 
these missiles, launched from the area 
of the Aral Sea, near Iran, landed in an 
impact area southwest of Honolulu?
only 1,200 miles away. 
The destruction of Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, the thermonuclear tests con-
ducted at our back door, the Marshallese 
and Lucky_Dragon fallout casualties, the 
two fireball explosions bathing Hawaii, in 
the night, in awesome nuclear light, the 
Soviet test-firing of missiles into the 
Pacific, and the increase in radioactive 
fallout in our atmosphere?all these have 
Made the people of Hawaii acutely sensi-
tive to the dangers of radioactive fallout, 
and have given them an understanding 
Of the vast, destructive power of ther-
Monuclear explosions. 
We in Hawaii also know that, with 
Our vital and strategic military instal-
lations at pearl Harbor Naval Base and 
Shipyard, Schofield Barracks, Hickam 
Field, Kaneohe Air Base, and with many 
other military establishments, Hawaii?
like nany other 'important areas else-
where in the United States?is a-primary 
target for enemy missiles with thermo-
nuclear *arIA'ads. 
Acutely sensitive as we are to these 
dangers, *e in Hawaii are also acutely 
mindful that American superiority in 
thermonuclear weapons and delivery 
systems has successfully deterred nu-
clear war. I am Confident that the peo-
ple of Hawaii strongly support the 
President and the Congress in their de-
termination to Maintain nuclear supe-
riority. 
Nevertheless, it is most natural that 
the people of Hawaii, like their fellow 
Americans everywhere, desire a lessening 
of radioactiVe fallout', and hope that, 
someday, mankind will be delivered from 
the threat of a nuclear holocaust. 
Mr. President (Mr. MCGOVERN in the 
chair), it is clear to all that this limited 
teSt tll'ea,tY will not lessen the clanger 
'of UjidleAr, wax:. t ut it is also clear that 
this united test 1ntreaty will lessen
radioactive fallout. 
According to the Atomic Energy Corn-
?mission and the Federal- Radiation 
Council, radioactive fallout is composed 
Oi three primary chemical elements--
13trontium 90; a deadly radioactive ele-
, 
NGR-ESSIONAL WORD ?sRNA 
ment, which is highly, injurious to bone 
and bone marrow; cesium 137, another 
fallout product, which can cause serious 
genetic damage; and iodine 131, a radio-
active element which attacks the 
thyroid. 
Figures released by the Atomic Energy 
Commission, the federal Radiation 
Council, the U.S. Weather Bureau, and 
the Agriculture Department, who have 
conducted joint studies of radioactive 
fallout, estimate that the fallout levels 
of these produCts of thermonuclear fis-
sion would increase about 90 percent 
over 1963 levels by 195, if thermonuclear 
testing were continued at 1962 rates. 
The same Federal agencies have esti-
mated that the accumulated deposition 
of strontium 90 in -Hawaii is now well 
over 100 millicuries per square mile. A 
millicurie is a measurement showing the 
degree of human exposure to beta and 
gamma radiation. The deposition of 
cesium 137 in Hawaii is about 170 milli-
curies per square mile. These figures 
are far above the natural levels for Ha-
waii but are not considered dangerous 
by experts in the Atomic Energy Com-
mission. They show, however, that 
Hawaii is one of the prime fallout areas 
in the world. They also reflect a steep 
escalation of radiation fallout since the 
1962 American tests and the heavy Rus-
sian testing of many high-yield thermo-
nuclear devices in 1961 and 1962. 
The precise level at which fallout ra-
diation is injurious to human life is a 
question not yet settled. Studies are 
still being conducted by scientists the 
world over to determine whether or not 
the threshold of injury to human life 
can be pinpointed. 
The noted scientists who prepared the 
1962 report of the United Nations Scien-
tific Committee on the Effects of Atomic 
Radiation expressed their deep appre-
hension of the somatic and genetic dam-
age growing out of the fallout from tests 
already conducted. The overwhelming 
weight of the world's scientific opinion 
has also expressed this deep concern. 
These scientists point out that the 
devastating effects of fallout on human 
life "may not be fully manifested for 
several decades in the case of somatic 
disease, and for many generations in the 
case of genetic damage.? 
Dr. Herman J. Miller, winner of the 
Nobel Prize in 1946 or discovering that 
X-rays cause changes in our genes, has 
figured that the fallout radiation re-
sulting from aboveground testing of a 
single 100-megaton bomb would be like-
ly to induce more than 100,000 cases Of 
leukemia, bone cancer, and? other fatal 
illnesses to the present world population 
and a million harmful mutations in the 
next generation. 
If this were true, it would be a stag-
gering toll, especially considering that it 
does not even take into account the 
threat of damage to the genetic integrity 
of the human lamily,through...the_gen-
erations to come. - - 
The possibility that susrienSion Of at-
mospheric thermonuclee:r testing would 
greatly diminish this hazard renders 
ratification of the treaty an affirmative 
gain of the most significant consequences 
to the human race. 
Tg 16729 
Apart from genetic considerations, the 
reduction of radioactive fallout from the 
suspension of atmospheric thermonu-
clear testing would still render ratifica-
4011 of the treaty an affirmative gain, 
since we1CI3Owlrom our experiences with 
the casualties ,of Hiroshima, Nagasaki, 
the,. Marshall Jslands and the Lucky 
Dragon that an overdose of radioactive 
fallout is harmful to human health. 
I have no illusions about the limita-
tions and risks of the treaty. Nor have 
I any illusions as to the trustworthiness 
of its chief cosigner, the Soviet Union, 
whose long history of treaty violations 
hardly evokes our faith and trust. Our 
approach to the Soviet Union is imbued 
with caution, wariness and watchfulness. 
The treaty is not a panacea to the 
problems of the cold war. It will not 
patch up American-Soviet differences. 
It will no;, end the threat of Communist 
aggression. It will not necessarily usher 
In a new era of lasting world peace. 
It will not even bring about a com-
plete cessation of atmospheric or under-
water thermonuclear testing. Nonsigna-
tory nations such as France will not be 
bound by the treaty. Under the terms of 
the treaty, underground testing is per-
mitted and is expected to continue. 
The weight of military, scientific, and 
diplomatic authority, balancing the risks 
against the benefits to be gained from the 
treaty, favors ratification. Some mili-
tary authorities have urged strong safe-
guards so as to render the military risk 
acceptable. 
Senate ratification of the treaty will 
not, we are assured, bring on a euphoric 
relaxation of our defensive strength and 
our vigilance. 
Our Nation's Commander in Chief, the 
President, has issued a list of safeguards 
to protect America against the risks in-
volved in the treaty. 
Our "posture of readiness" will be 
maintained and indeed strengthened. 
We will carry forward a vigorous pro-
gram of underground testing and con-
tinue to maintain strong weapons labo-
ratories. 
The United States would withdraw 
from the treaty if our interests are seri-
ously jeopardized. 
Our detection facilities for possible 
clandestine violations of the treaty will 
be "expanded and improved." 
The treaty does not alter our relation-
ship with regimes we do not recognize. 
It "in no way limits the authority of 
the Commander in Chief to use nuclear 
weapons of the defense of the United 
States and its allies" if the situation so 
required. 
We will "take all the? necessary steps 
to safeguard our national security," in-
cluding the resumption of atmospheric 
testing, if the treaty is violated. 
These safeguards, we are assured, will 
render acceptable the risks that first, the 
alleged Soviet lead in knowledge of radia-
tion and blackout effects on communica-
tions and rnisifie control -systems may be 
widened; second, our lead in tactical nu-
clear weapon technology may be wiped 
out by the Soviets; third, we will not 
have a chance to test the effectiveness of

develop; and fourth, the Soviets may

have superior know-how to immobilize 
the delivery capability of our missile sites 
and systems. 
I aro satisfied that, in the light of all 
these firm assurances, America's defense 
posture and military strength will be 
maintained and our security safe-
guarded. 
With these assurances, I support the 
treaty because I believe it will help safe-
guard the people of the world against 
harmful radioactive fallout. 
I support the treaty because it forbids 
the testing of thermonuclear devices in 
the atmosphere, in outer space, and un-
der water. 
I support the treaty because, on bal-
anCe, it is good for my country, good 
for my State, and good for all the people 
of the world. 
This is surely a far cry from settling 
East-West tensions. But to me, it may 
be a tentative first step to the easing of 
world tensions. Though it dces nothing 
to inhibit the manufacture of thermonu-
clear, weapons, the treaty is an impera-
tive preliminary step without which we 
could not go on to anything else. 
The limited test ban is in a sense an 
experiment in trust which might produce 
sufficient mutual confidence to lead 
eventually to a total ban on all forms of 
thermonuclear testing with adequate in-
spection and other safeguards, and we 
hope some day to a limitation of the 
thermonuclear arms race. 
Because I believe the treaty will les-
sen thermonuclear radioactive fallout 
and May prove to be a faint step toward 
the road to peace for the common good 
of the world, I am willing to give it that 
chance. 
Mr. SPARKMAN. Mr. President, I 
commend the able Senator from Hawaii 
for a fine and forceful presentation. He 
has made one of the best, most concise 
presentations heard during the course of 
the debate. 
Mr. FONG. I thank the Senator from 
Alabama. 
Mr. SPARKMAN. Mr. President, I 
suggest the absence of a quorum. 
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The 
clerk will call the roll. 
The legislative clerk proceeded to call 
the roll. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, I ask unanimous consent that fur-
ther proceedings under the quorum call 
may be dispensed with. 
The PRESIDING Otee'ICER. Without 
objection, it is so ordered. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. Mr. Presi-
dent, when the nuclear test ban treaty 
was ordered favorably reported to the 
Senate by the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee on August 29, I cast the single 
vote against reporting the treaty'. 
I do not want my lone vote at that 
time nor my subsequent expressions on 
the subject to convey any sense of disre-
spect for the other members of the For-
eign Relations Committee. 
On the contrary, I have the greatest 
admiration for my fellow committee 
members. I feel privileged to serve on 
this important committee with truly out-
standing Members of the Senate under 
the distinguished leadership of the Sen-
ator from Arkansas [Mr. Fonearona]. I 
believe the decisions of the committee 
members in favor of this treaty have 
been motivated, without exception, by 
deep and sincere convictions that what 
they have done is right. However, my 
respect for their position does not alter 
the course I feel I must take. 
This is a decision that could spell our 
doom. If that is overly pesimistic, then 
et me go a step further and say that this 
Is one of a very few mistakes which al-
most certainly would mean the end of 
our independence as a nation, the end 
of freedom as we have known it, and the 
end of the lives of most of us. 
To show the problem, it is necessary for 
me to work from certain assumptions to 
their conclusions. 
Suppose that the Soviets in their last 
series of tests were able to assure them-
selves that they have the information 
necessary to mount an attack on this 
country which could destroy much of our 
offensive capabilities and so disorganize 
our retaliatory power that better than 80 
percent of our offensive power could 
never be hurled at our opponent. 
Suppose that our adversary has ac-
quired the information which would en-
able him to devise and construct almost 
foolproof defenses against our bombers 
and our missiles. 
Suppose further that he knows that we 
do not have the information, the knowl-
edge that we need to offer more than 
moderately effective resistance to his at-
tack and that we are badly lacking in the 
means to penetrate his defenses, as a re-
sult of our inability to test our offensive 
weapons against the kind of defenses 
that they will encounter. 
We know that our adversary plans to 
control and dominate this planet. 
Then suppose our adversary signed a 
treaty with us which would preclude us 
from testing our radar against the black-
outs which would result from atomic ex-
plosions created by our own defensive 
missiles as well as those created by our 
enemy's missiles. 
Suppose the treaty would prevent us 
from determining what the atomic ex-
plosions would do to our communications 
on which our continued defense as well 
as much of our retaliation would depend. 
Let us suppose further that our adver-
sary had learned hoarhe could prevent 
us from striking back from our missiles 
presently resting in hardened sites, pos-
sibly by blasting the area near the sites 
sufficiently close with atomic weapons. 
Let us suppose that our adversary 
could effectively predict the positions of a 
substantial portion of our Polaris sub-
marines, and depend upon limiting the 
damage to be expected from such sub-
marine missiles as he could not destroy 
.in home ports or elsewhere. 
Then would not the following course 
be logical: First, he would develop his 
weapons and produce them in large num-
bers. This would take several years. 
Second, he would break the test ban to 
be sure that they worked. Third, he 
would embark upon a course of inter-
national conduct which would compel us 
to gradually surrender to his overwhelm-
ing poWer or start a war which we could 
not hope to win if we permited him to 
strike first. In the latter event, would 
he not plan to strike you the moment, he 
concluded that we had elected that we 
would rather take our chances fighting 
than surrender? 
It is my judgment that each of the 
assumptions that I have made cannot be 
dismissed. Some of them are already 
true. Others are reasonable probabili-
ties. 
Thus far, this Nation has been safe 
because it has been so strong that it 
could face any showdown with a confi-
dence that we could rain so much more 
destruction upon an enemy than he could 
hurl at us that only a madman would 
persist in engaging our Nation in an 
allout war. 
This overwhelming pre ponderanc e 
has preserved large and small nations 
in the era which we choose to call the 
Pax America, or the era of world peace 
protected by 'America. Since Nagasaki, 
atomic weapons have not been used for 
purposes of warfare. They have been 
used only to maintain peace and as a 
threat to potential aggressors. . 
But the balance is shifting. The So-
viets have gone ahead in space. They 
are abreast of us in atomic weapons. 
Under the proposed treaty, the Soviets 
could continue underground testing in 
areas of relatively small nuclear explo-
sions where we feel we are ahead. We 
would be barred from testing in the high-
yield ranges where they are ahead. 
We fear that the Russians have 
learned much that we do not know in 
testing atomic weapons and the effects 
of explosions on the radar, the communi-
cations, and the warheads themselves 
which would be a part of an intercon-
tinental ballistic missile system on the 
one hand and as the various components 
of an effective defensive antiballistic 
missile on the other hand. 
If this should prove true, then time is 
running out on us rapidly. If Russia is 
ahead of us in the knowledge necessary 
for both the offense and the defense of 
tomorrow, then this treaty may prove to 
be national suicide. 
Under this treaty, America will be pre-
vented from building an efficient missile 
defense. It is said that we can design 
? around our areas of ignorance. This IS 
like planning to kill elephants with sticks 
because a treaty prevents us from devel-
oping an elephant gun. 
Under this treaty, America will be pre-
vented from developing weapons as large 
as the Soviets'. It is said that we do not 
need them. That is like saying that we 
do not need large cannons, because two 
smaller shells can do what one large one 
will do. 
Under this treaty, we will be prevented 
from testing weapons that we already 
have in inventory, weapons that may 
prove to be billions of dollars of goose 
feathers so far as our offensive power is 
concerned. 
Let it be remembered that during the 
first year of World War II the Americans 
were fighting with torpedoes that would 
not work, while the Japanese were fight-
ing with torpedoes that did work. They 
sank most of our Pacific Fleet with tor-
pedoes that had been tested against 
ships, while we bounced harmlessly 
against Japanese hulls torpedoes that

When I voted for the Disarmam

ger. 
A man like William Foster is a ha 
headed, practical person, but his vie 
are necessarily affected by the o 
worlders, Quakers, and "peace-at-an 
price" tyl5es who gravitate toward su 
an agency. If these people cannot ma 
an impression on Bill Foster, then th 
will impress at least some persons in t 
Senate, the House, the White House, t 
great universities, the press, or at so 
ther point where they may influence o 
ational decisions. I fear that these pe 
le are making headway in all,sof the 
laces?the Congress, the White Hou 
he universities, the press. The Pent 
on can properly be expected to be t 
ast bastion to fall prey to the siren so

ortress is held at the White House. T 
resident is the Commander-in-Chie

nd the brass who run the Pentagon. 
Now the so-called military support 
his treaty should be measured again

be- an officer on active duty will sometimes 
give a confidential friend an answer 
t to which utterly devastates the logic of the 
ma- executive decision; however, he will not 
rn- do that in public. 
eve Those whom the President chooses for 
ar- his Chiefs of Staff have always appeared 
to me to move from a sense of duty to 
ent support the President's decision as their 
an- own once he has made it. In fact, it 
has always appeared to me that this was 
rd- the unwritten code of general officers. 
WS Now when Curtis LeMay stated that 
ne- he would not have recommended signing 
Y- this test ban treaty, it seemed to me as 
ch one who has been on committees hear-
ke ing such men testify for 15 years, that 
ey General LeMay was going as far as the 
he rules of the game would permit even 
he with the so-called clearance that had 
me been granted by the executive. 
ur When General Power, Chief of the

se, that he would not advise ratification of 
a- a treaty signed by the President, he was 
he all but turning in his uniform and offer-
ng ing to sacrifice himself for national sur-
at vival as he saw it. That. is what this 
he testimony- meant to me, regardless of 
f. what kind of clearance this man was 
ns supposed to have. 
Before anyone leaps to the conclusion 
of that General LeMay adviaes this treaty, 
st let him note that the Secretary of the 
of Air Force cancelled the Secretary's ac-
t, ceptance at a mere social event given by

Many of our people are worried abou 
pollution in the atmosphere. This wor 
ried me greatly until I learned that 
have been _exposed to radiation all my 
life as a result ,of cosmic rays, mineral 
deposits, X-rays, phosphorescent wrist-
Watches, television tubes, and other such 
devices, 
If a person is hying in Denver, he is

than at yvItaLingtgon, In the State of

1,00 percent more radiation than in 
Washington, and nobody ever thought 
Much about it. 
The explosions of nuclear devices by 
411 nations have increased radiation by

border, not to nse troops of Chiang 
? Kai-shek, to dismiss General MacArthur, 
? were all debatable, to say the least, from 
the military point of view. 
? 
It should be noted that concerning our 
strategy in Korea hardly a word of criti-
cism?none comes to my mind?came to 
Lt the surface from an officer on active duty, 
? save General MacArthur himself who 
was being relieved of command and who 
felt such deep resentment and disagree-
t ment that he was willing to risk court 
- martial if the President had dared to go 
I so far with a popular national idol. 
When General MacArthur closed his 
speech before the joint session of Con-
gress, there was not a -dry eye in the 
.military, yet not a responsible officer in 
charge of the Military Establishment 
rose to criticize the President nor the 
restraints that had been imposed upon 
General MacArthur. 
In the thousands of pages of testimony 
that occurred during the investigation, 
the Joint Chiefs backed the President 
implicitly and other officers were no more 
critical than merely to point out that, 
when military and political decisions Are 
eneral Power recommended and as 
General LeMay said he would have rec-
ommended except for the fact that the 
executive had already approved the 
treaty. 
No, the fact is that for these officers 
to have gone any farther against this 
treaty would have required that they 
consider offering their resignations first, 
no matter what kind of clearance they 
were supposed to have had. 
If this Nation should perish, it will be 
because we will not listen to these men 
who have gone as far as their positions 
and circumstances will permit to advise 
us to rely upon the best weapons we can 
acquire and to let nothing prevent us 
from being best in weaponry if we care 
to survive. 
In the past these men have advised 
that we proceed with missiles while 
others were dragging their feet. They 
have advised even faster, better aircraft, 
better equipment. Had we listened to 
them, we would have been in far better 
shape to face every crisis from the first 
Berlin blockade to the Cuban threat 
today. 
Some years ago, I served on the Select 
Committee on Disarmament and on the 
Disarmament Subcommittee of the Com-
mittee of Foreign Relations. These were 
forerunners to the Disarmament Agency, 
and, in some respects, forerunners of this 
treaty. Let me say that my colleague, 
the Senator from Minnesota [Mr. 
HUMPHREY], is as devoted a patriot as 
any man in this Chamber, although our 
views on this treaty are as different as 
night and clay. He was chairman of

that select committee and that subcom-
mittee. , 
When we were serving on the Disarma-
ment Committee, the Joint Chiefs told us 
that, if we wanted to disarm, we should 
arm first because their resources had 
been cut back until they had nothing 
that they could afford to give up. This 
was under the Eisenhower administra-
tion. 
Subsequently, we did proceed to arm 
this ctruntry under President Kennedy. 
Today we are in position to talk disarma-
ment because we are very strong. But 
we should not talk disarmament without 
foolproof inspection. Until our adver-
sary is ready to disarm and let us inspect 
to see for ourselves, we should continue 
to build and maintain great strength. 
This is the only way that we will ever 
have an honorable peace with freedom. 
However long it takes, this we must in-
sist upon. 
Now. Mr. President, one of the biggest 
dangers in this treaty, in my opinion, 
is the fact that Red China is not bound 
by it. t think that the distinguished 
Senator from Georgia IMr. BUSsELL) 
and many others have Indicated their 
great apprehension over this fact. 
All have indicated the fear that in 
years to come Russia will use Chinese 
territory to conduct clandestine tests in 
the atmosphere. It is all too easy for 
some to discount this possibility at this 
Particular time because of the alleged 
poor relations between Russia and China. 
But who is to say that these relations 
might not take a very sudden turn for 
the better?just as they took a sudden 
turn for the worse during these past 
3 or 4 months. Who is to say that Mao 
Tse-tung, who is well into his seventies, 
might not die the very next week after 
nekt and that his successor might not 
bring China back under Russia's wing. 
Or who is to say that in any number of 
ways China and Russia might not sud-
denly become true allies once more?
even under their present leadership. 
I remember only too well, Mr. Presi-
dent, the conclusion on this very sub-
ject reached only 3 or 4 years ago by the 
Subcommittee on Disarmament of the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. I 
arid Several others who are still members 
of the Foreign Relations Committee 
served on that subcommittee, which in 
a number of ways led us to establish the 
present Disarmament Agency. 
For some time we studied the matter 
of nuclear test bans and came up with 
numerous conclusions on this subject 
and others-
Einring_that period, in August 1953-5 
years ago?my friend from Minnesota 
brought to us a document warning that 
no disarmament agreement- with Rus-
sia would be In this Nation's interest un-
les e subscribed to fully by Communist 
China The possibility of Communist 
perftdY by way 'of using China as a tool 
or 45 Volfer for a Russian operation was 
specifically spelled out In the subcom-
tratee's report rt reads as follows: 
dOilinitinist China is still a formidable 
Military power and every indication is that 
thlit power is being augmented. As the sub-
oarchnittee has evaluated events in the area 
of China and within China itself which are 
directly related to disarmament, it has con-
eluded that there is a real -possibility that 
the exclusion of China from a first step dis-
armament agreement might provide the 
Soviet Union a significant loophole through 
which to evade such an agreement. Obvi-
ously, whether this loophole would exist 
would depend on the nature of the agree-
ment. The subconunittee notes in this con-
nection that an agreement which involved 
the suspension of nuclear weapons tests with 
inapection and which did not include inspec-
tion in Communist China might present an 
opportunity for evasions on the part of the 
Soviet bloc. The United States must not 
contemplate signing a disarmament agree-
ment which would permit its security to be 
jeopardized. The subcommittee is of the 
opinion, -therefore, that greater attention 
must be paid to the question of including 
Communist China in any disarmament 
agreement which would provide for the sus-
pension of nuclear weapons tests with in-
spection. 
This subcommittee included a number 
of the Senators who voted to favorably 
report this measure to the Senate. 
Now we are presented a treaty that 
drops the requirement of inspection. I 
am advised that it will be impossible to 
prove cheating under all circumstances, 
even in Russia or at sea. For example, 
when an explosion occurs in the south 
Pacific, how will anyone know who cre-
ated that explosion at sea? No one ex-
cept those who were there would know. 
The south Pacific is the high sea; it is 
available to everyone. The treaty cer-
tainly does not block the cheating with 
China as the cover. 
If we make this treaty minus Inspec-
tion, I predict that we will never per-
suade Russia to agree to foolproof in-
spection in all other respects. This will 
be the precedent. It will be said among 
Communists that if we will agree to a 
treaty so clearly against our security 
interests as this one, we will eventually 
seal off whatever chance we have of pre-
vailing on this earth by agreeing to dis-
arm under circumstances wherein our 
adversary will remain armed to the 
teeth. 
In the Cuban crisis, only last year, 
these selfsame ComMunista?in fact, 
one of them also initialed this treaty?
lied to us about missiles in Cuba until 
they were almost in position to blast us 
from this planet with Cuba as the base 
before we finally moved. Even now we 
do not know whether the missiles are in 
Cuba or not. The inspection to which 
Russia agreed at the showdown never 
came to pass because our leadership 
softened Its resolve when the immediate 
crisis passed. 
I respect our 'President as a person,- a 
former naval officer, -a former Senator, 
and as an able Chief Executive. He says 
that this treaty enables all people to be 
free from fears of radioactive fallout. I 
say that you had better be worried about 
the fallout from' the bombs aimed at you 
If you are lucky enough to escape the 
blast, more than the infinitesimal 
amount of radiation from tests con-
ducted under conditions carefully ar-
ranged to protect life and health. Inso-
far as this treaty frees you from fear, it 
is a sense of false security. 
Our President says this treaty fur-
nishes a small hope that war can be 
averted. I say that this treaty dashes 
that hope in that it will shift the relative 
power of the two great protagonists in 
favor of the one which refuses to re-
nounce world domination under police 
state rule as the only answer. 
This treaty will help to shift military 
superiority from the law-abiding God-
fearing, peace-loving, truthtelling Gov-
ernment that is the United States. 
This treaty will serve to retard the de-
velopment of our defenses and our 
offensive power. This treaty will limit 
but slightly the development of the mili-
tary might of our adversary arid he will 
cheat whenever he finds the restraint to 
be important. 
This treaty will result in a stronger 
Communist military power compared to 
that of the United States and the free 
world. This treaty will hasten the day 
when Soviet Russia and Communist 
China will be ready to risk war with us. 
Many years ago, Patrick Henry said: 
Gentlemen may cry peace, peace, but there 
is no peace.-What is It that gentlemen wish? 
What would they have? Is life so dear, or 
peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the 
price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, 
Almighty God. I know not what course 
others may take, but, as for me, give me 
liberty, or give Me death. 
Many of the arguments that have been 
made for this treaty would place our 
lives, our safety, our hope for better 
health and cleaner air ahead of our love 
of liberty. This treaty would do just 
that. I do not care to survive to a day 
when this Nation is no longer free, and 
I am prepared to pay the price of a free 
America whatever that price may be. 
The price of preparedness is small in-
deed compared to the consequences of 
defeat. 
This treaty should be rejected and I 
shall so vote. 
Mr. 'THURMOND. Mr. :President, 
will the Senator yield? 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana, I yield. 
Mr. THURMOND. I presume the 
Senator from Louisiana has read in the 
news today that Mr. Gromy:ko, the man 
who initialed the treaty on behalf of the 
U.S.S.R., the man who was at the White 
House and talked to President Kennedy 
last fall concerning the missiles in Cuba, 
and denied there were any missiles 
there, at the very time President Ken-
nedy had pictures in his desk showing 
they were there, is now stating that he 
wants to have a disarmament meeting 
with the President in Moscow next year. 
I presume the Senator read those news 
accounts. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. What the 
Russians have in mind for us, in my 
judgment, is exactly what they had last 
tine. Mr. Grornyko is going to meet the 
President and propose that -the United 
States and Russia both disarm, on a 
self-inspection basis. That is a fine 
proposal for one nation that does not 
believe in truth to make to another na-
tion that does. If this country Made 
such an agreement, we would be bound 
to disarm. Mr. Gromyko went before 
President Kennedy and said, "You can 
depend on it, Mr. President, that there 
are no Russian missiles in Cuba"?at 
the very time the President had in his 
desk pictures of missiles in Cuba. If we 
do business with those people, and dis-
arm, all they have to do is lie to us that

hearty commendations to him. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. I thank the 
Senator. I appreciate his compliment. 
I listened with _great interest to the 
speech or the Senator from South Caro-
lina. The Senator brought to me much 
good, solid thought, knowledge, and in-
formation that he had learned, both as 
a general in the armed services and as 
a member of the Armed Services Corn-
Mittee, when he 'spelled out, in chapter 
and verse, Information that was not be-

when it Vbted on the question?not that 
It would have' changed the votes, but the 
information the senator had made avail-

why the 'treaty -should not be ratified. 
' I said so at the time. 
r. 'TITURMOND. I thank the Sen-
ator. r congratulate him for his cour-
, age in being the only member of the 
Foreign Relations Committee to vote 
against rePOrling the treaty favorably 
to the Senate floor. Since that time the 
Senator from Ohio Mr: LAuSenE3 has 
given earnest study and consideration 
? to this matter, and I was pleased to learn 
Yesterday that he has decided to vote 
against the treaty. I likewise commend 
him for his dedicated study and his cour-
a,ge in deciding to stand with our small 
band of opponents. 
Mr. LO of Louisiana. As the Sen-
ator wellInows, at the time the Foreign 
Relations Committee met, it did not have 
,available to it the information that was 
presented to "the? Preparedness Investi-
gating Subcommittee of the Committee 
on Arm-ea Services. The Senator from 
South Carolina is a member of the Pre-
paredness Investigating Subcommittee. 
He is also a member of the Committee 
that the Senator from Ohio would have 
voted just as the Senator from Louisi-
ana said he would have voted if that in-
formation had been made available to 
him. I regret that the Foreign Rela-
tions Committee acted before the Sena-
tor from Ohio and other members of the 
committee had the opportunity to study 
the report of the Preparedness Subcom-
mittee. I also believe that the Senator 
from Ohio or another member of the 
committee requested that General Power 
be allowed to testify before the Foreign 
Relations Committee, and that that re-
quest was denied. 
I am sorry that General Power was not 
permitted to appear before the commit-
tee, because he is the one man who would 
have to press the button to have the 
bombers take off and have the missiles 
fired in the event an exchange should 
occur. He has been giving a great deal 
of attention to this subject as chairman 
of the strategic targeting group. He is 
an expert on nuclear weapons and an 
expert oil planes, including bombers. 
Merely because he is a military man in-
duces some people to feel that perhaps 
he is not a scientist, and therefore should 
not go into these matters, or that he 
does not know anything about these sub-
jects. He does. General Power has giv-
en a great deal of attention and study 
to these matters. No one could have 
heard the testimony of General Power 
before the Preparedness Subcommittee 
and not be convinced that he knows what 
he is talking about?that this dedicated 
officer knows his job and the enemy we 
face in the cold war. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. I do not 
know whether General Power requested 
that he be heard before the Foreign Re-
lations Committee. 
Mr. THURMOND. He did not request 
that he be heard, but I believe the Sena-
tor from Ohio or another member of the 
Foreign Relations Committee told me 
that he had requested that General Pow-
er lae allowed to appear before the com-
Mittee. 
Services Committee and the predecessor 
committee from the day he came to the 
Senate, probably 24 or 26 years ago. 
Many consider him to be the best 
qualified man to be President. 
I supported him for President at the 
Democratic Convention, but refused to 
walk out of the convention when a ma-
jority of the Louisiana delegation wanted 
to walk out, on the theory that we came 
to support a Senator from Georgia, and 
that we should remain and fight for him. 
In the opinion of former President 
Truman he was the best qualified man 
to be President of the United States. 
When he made the compelling case 
against the treaty that he made, I was 
left with no alternative but to vote to 
reject the treaty, as he had said he was 
left in no doubt about rejecting the 
treaty, because it fails to protect the sur-
vival of this country. 
The treaty could be the key to our 
destruction, or our demise as an inde-
pendent nation. I cannot vote for it 
knowing that that might be the result. 
Mr. THURMOND. The announce-
ment by Mr. Gromyko, which was pub-
lished in the papers today, bears out the 
prediction of the Senator from Louisiana, 
the senior Senator from Georgia [Mr. 
RUSSELL], and other Senators that the 
nuclear test ban treaty is the first step 
to disarmament. 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. The prophet-
ic judgment of the Senator from Geor-
gia [Mr. RUSSELL] about the treaty being 
a step that is in the wrong direction 
from the standpoint of this Nation's in-
terest, included a prediction by the Sena-
tor from Georgia that some other nation, 
among the community of nations, would 
propose that now that we have agreed 
to cease atmospheric testing and testing 
In space and testing under water, we 
should now agree to stop all underground 
testing. 
Today, within a week of when the 
Senator from Georgia made his speech, 
a delegate from Brazil in the United Na-
tions has proposed that the smaller na-
tions should take the lead in seeking to 
make us agree that we will not do any 
underground testing.

difference between them is as to what 
the best way is of destroying us. 
Mr. THURMOND. Does not the Sen-
ator from Louisiana feel that the only 
thing that has prevented a war with 
Russia since World War II, in view of 
her goal of world domination and en-
slavement, has been the overwhelming 
nuclear power of the United States? 
Mr. LONG of Louisiana. It is my 
judgment that that is what has main-
tained the peace. Some may disagree 
with me, of course. They say the Rus-
sians do not want war. I am sure they do 
not want war, provided it fits in with 
their terms, which means that they 
would dominate the world, including the 
United States. There is no doubt in my 
mind that it has been the nuclear deter-
rent of the United States which has been 
maintaining the peace over the years 
since World War II. Incidentally, Win-
ston Churchill, one of the greatest 
statesmen of our time, at Fulton, Mo., 
made that statement a few years ago, 
on the occasion of his visit to President 
Truman. 
Mr. THURMOND. I thank the Sen-
ator. 
Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. President, 
the Senate will soon act to fulfill an im-
portant constitutional responsibility 
which it shares with the President of 
the United States. We have been asked 
by the President to approve ratification 
?of the test ban treaty, and thus to share 
with him this responsibility. The Con-
stitution requires, for the ratification of 
any treaty, the advice of the Senate and 
the consent of two-thirds of the Senators 
who are present and voting. In a for-
mal sense, it ts the Members of the Sen-
ate who offer the advice to the Presi-
dent; but, in a broader sense, the Sen-
ate is the medium through which the 
whole country should be expected to give 
Its advice. 
In the same manner, the vote of the 
Senate will be the means by which the 
country will give its consent. 
Oftentimes, the advice given in regard 
to a treaty is highly technical, and the 
consent which is given involves a limited 
or confined scientific or rational judg-
ment. But the advice and consent with 
reference to this particular treaty in-
volve much more than that. They in-
volve our advice based on the general 
judgment of the Senate and?if the Sen-
ate speaks for the country?the judg-
ment of the people of this country. So 
our decision also involves a moral com-
mitment, in connection with which we 
rely on the intellect and the will of 
people of this land when we act either 
to affirm or to reject the treaty?as a 
result of which we shall be subject to 
the interpretation of historical judgment 
as to the movement of events in the year 
1963. 
Mr. President, neither advice nor the 
consent of the Senate on matters as 
serious as those involved in this test ban 
treaty should be given lightly. The Sen-
ate has proceeded most cautiously and 
most carefully. It has sought the ad-
vice of representatives of the President, 
principally the Secretary of State. It 
has sought the advice of the Joint Chiefs 
of Staff and of other military experts. 
It has sought the advice of former Presi-
dents and former public officials expe-
rienced in international affairs. It has 
sought the advice of scientists and his-
torians, and has heard, from the general 
public. 
In considering the test ban treaty, the 
Senate has conducted a thorough re-
view of our military policy and our for-
eign policy, and has considered both our 
strength and our weaknesses. It has 
examined carefully the language of the 
treaty itself, and has attempted to weigh 
the immediate implications and the im-
mediate significance of the treaty. 
The Senate has also judged the treaty 
against the background of history and 
the movemnt of history, and has consid-
ered both the discouraging record of the 
past and the risks and the uncertainties 
of the future. 
Most treaties are instruments of lim-
ited objective and also limited achieve-
ment. Sometimes their declared pur-
poses are relatively limited and almost 
trivial. Sometimes their declared pur-
poses have expressed hopes beyond the 
reasonable expectations of prudent men. 
Some treaties have been formed and 
drawn in good faith; and others have 
been designed to deceive. Some treaties 
have been signed and ratified as instru-
ments of mutual defense; others, as a 
seal of mutual aggression. The record 
of performance on treaties is as mixed as 
the history of mankind. 
This test ban treaty is one of limited 
objectives. The heart of it is the agree-
ment that each of the parties will under-
take the following: 
1. Prohibit, to prevent, and not to carry 
out any nuclear weapon test explosion, or. 
any other nuclear explosion at any place 
under its jurisdiction or control; 
(a) In the atmosphere, beyond its limits, 
Including outer space, or underwater, in-
cluding territorial waters or high seas; or 
(b) In any other environment if such ex-
plosion causes radioactive debris to be pre-
sent outside the territorial limits of the 
State under whose jurisdiction or control 
such explosion is conducted. It is under-
stood, in this connection, that the provisions 
of this subparagraph are without prejudice 
to the conclusion of a treaty resulting in the 
permanent banning of all nuclear test ex-
plosions, including all such explosions un-
derground, the conclusions of which, as the 
parties have stated in the preamble to this 
treaty, they seek to achieve. 
2. Each of the parties to this treaty under-
takes furthermore to refrain from causing, 
encouraging, or in any way participating 
in, the carrying out of any nuclear weapon 
test explosion, or any other nuclear explo-
sion anywhere, which would take place in 
any of the environments described, or have 
the effect referred to in paragraph 1 of this 
article. 
The rest of the articles of the treaty 
deal with procedures for ratification, the 
admission of additional signatories, and 
within?in article IV?the conditions 
and terms under which,the parties may 
repudiate and withdraw from the treaty 
arrangement. 
Some Senators have criticized the 
treaty because it will not establish uni-
versal peace and full victory for the 
United States and for the free world. 
These are some of the questions that 
have been asked about it: 
September 20 
First. Will the treaty get the Russian 
troops out of Cuba? 
Second. Will the treaty rid Cuba of 
the despotism of Communist domina-
tion? 
Third. Will the treaty stop the sabo-
tage in Venezuela? 
Fourth. Will the treaty eliminate the 
Communist subversion and espionage in 
Peru and Ecuador? 
Fifth. Will the treaty stop Communist 
agitation in Africa? 
Sixth. Will the treaty free any of the 
people now enslaved in eastern European 
countries? How many? 
Seventh. Will the treaty tear down 
the Berlin wall, so that more people May 
express with their feet their antagonism 
to Communist despotism? 
Eighth. Will the treaty cause the So-
viets to abandon their espionage rings 
in any free world nation? 
Ninth. Will the treaty end the con-
stant irritations on the Korean truce 
line, or prevent future killings of Ameri-
can troops? 
Tenth. Will the treaty prevent the 
shelling of Quemoy and Matsu in the 
future? 
Eleventh. Will the treaty cause the 
Communists to cease their attacks on 
non-Communists in Laos, or to mitigate 
their efforts to take over that country? 
Twelfth. Will the treaty cause the 
North Vietnamese and the Chinese to 
cease trying to take over Vietnam? 
These are questions to which answers 
have been demanded. 
Obviously, the answers must be in the 
negative. One could recite a long list of 
other questions. Some persons would 
seem to demand that the treaty somehow 
solve all the problems which face the 
United States, both at home and abroad. 
This would be to demand much more of 
this treaty?or any treaty?than anyone 
has a right to demand. 
Some Senators have charged that the 
treaty is the first step in a series which 
may lead to general and complete dis-
armament, involving total surrender of 
the sovereignty of the United States, 
This, too, of course, is to charge more 
or to promise more or to prophesy more 
than is warranted by the limited text 
of the treaty itself. 
In dealing with the test ban treaty, 
we cannot act upon the fears and the 
apprehensions of some Members of the 
Senate or of any Member of the Senate, 
because to do so would preclude action 
by the Senate on this issue, as well as on 
most of the other controversial issues 
which come before this body. 
We cannot act on the basis of the 
prophecies?for many things said about 
the treaty have been in the area of proph-
ecy, even though the speakers have 
denied that they possess prophetic gifts. 
The record of treaties in relation to 
their stated objectives is a mixed one, 
We cannot expect absolute certainty of 
success, even with reference to the lim-
ited objectives set forth in this treaty. 
On the other hand, we should not be 
wholly pessimistic--by assuming that the 
terms of the treaty will in no way be re-
spected or honored. 
A treaty is an instrument of foreign 
policy and?like all such instruments?

It operates -without the full support of 
power that can be used when the full sov-
ereignty of one's Country is being exer-
cised. . 
The declarations of the administration 
and the very record made in the course 
of the Senate committees' inquiries have 
demonstrated clearly that no one is be-
ing falsely optimistic about the possibil-
ities of 'the treaty. On the other hand, 
the possible good that may come from 
the treaty has not been exaggerated. 
No pile can know with absolute cer-
tainty what interests motivated the So-
viet T,inion in signing the test ban treaty 
M this time, although some have sug-
gested rather strongly what that motiva-
tion may be. We do not have any guar-
antee that the Soviet Union will not 
break the treaty, even without cause, in 
the futtire. We are not proceeding, how-
ever, as though we had these absolute 
guarantees. There are no intentions on 
the part of the United States to proceed 
with any kind of unilateral disarmament, 
once the treaty is signed. We have been 
aseUred by the Joint Chiefs of Staff that 
although testing in tlip atniosphere 
wallet -be useful in developing.' our mili-
tary power, the restrictions which the 
treaty would Set up would not be such as 
to prevent adequate development of our 
defenses. 
We retain our freedom to continue 
Underground tests without violation of 
the treaty, and we intend to pursue such 
testing. 
We, are free-.and are resolved to re-
Main prepared to do so?to resume nu-
clear, testing in the atmosphere if the 
treat* is Violated. 
We shall go On continuing to improve 
our stern and methods for detecting all 
kinds of nuclear testing, and to develop 
our own anti-ballistic-missile program. 
There is every reason to believe that 
Our nuclear laboratory facilities will con-
tinue to develop and attract the best sci-
entists in the free world. 
The treaty would ban certain forms of 
testing but it will not outlaw use of nu-
clear weapons. It Involves no compro-
mise in the ideological war with commu-
nism, nor does it bear upon the general 
cold war with communism, does it 
bear directly upon the limited small wars 
between Communists And anti-Commu-
nists that go on today. 
It does not change the fact that both 
we and the Soviet Union have a stockpile 
of wielear weapons. It may prevent 
some nations from entering the nuclear 
arITIS race, but it has not yet been ac-
cepted by Frahm and Red China, the two 
nations, which are pressing the hardest 
in the effort to develop their own nuclear 
weapons. 
The treaty cannot properly be de-
scribed as a step forward, nor as a step 
backward, but rather as a kind of halt. 
It is enough to judge the treaty for 
what it clearly it?an agreement to pro-
hibit nuclear weapons testing in the at-
mosphere, outer space and under water. 
This is an achievement to be judged in 
fts GIvri right. It may turn out to be the 
first of many steps toward tl4p objectives 
of peace and justice. Whether it will or 
not remains unknown. 
If the treaty is honored, in my opinion, 
It should open the possibility of further 
action to reduce the threat of nuclear 
war or to limit the use of nuclear 
weapons. 
It is a fact- that agreements and un-
derstandings regarding poison gas seem 
to have been successful in the 20th cen-
tury. In any case,-this destructive power 
has not been used, whatever the reason 
may be. 
Leaving out all consideration of the 
use of nuclear weapons in time of war, 
the limited consideralion of the con-
tamination of the environment by radio-
active materials alone is one deserving 
serious international attention. 
The testing of nuclear weapons brings 
risks to all the people of the world. The 
uninvolved and uncommitted citizens of 
the other nations, as well as those citi-
zens of the major powers producing and 
controlling nuclear arms. It creates 
risks not only for people living, but risks 
for those who are yet unborn. The ef-
fects on the health of citizens and the 
genetic effects of radioactive materials 
are not fully known or understood. But 
It is generally known and' accepted that 
radioactive materials can cause a serious 
hazard to health and to life. 
Because the dangers both in war and 
In peace arising from nuclear power are 
great, we must be willing to take some 
limited risks within prudential -limits. 
This test ban treaty involves limited 
risks. Its ratification is dictated by pru-
dent consideration. It should therefore 
be ratified by the Senate. 
Mr. JOHNSTON. Mr. President, the 
debate on the test ban treaty has now 
been in progress In the Senate for 2 
weeks. 
I have listened with utmost care to 
the intense debate that has been waged 
in the U.S. Senate over, whether or not 
we should ratify the test ban treaty. 
This treaty ratification has given me 
great concern because Of, the, charges 
and countercharges concerning the pos-
sible effect that this treaty might have 
upon the security of our Nation. As in 
most matters which have come before 
this body, this treaty has received 
neither unanimous approval nor objec-
tion by the Senate. As in most proposals 
that I have faced in the Senate during 
my 19 years of service, the contents of 
this treaty are not unanimously accept-
able to me. There are weaknesses in the 
treaty which I disapprove of but there 
are many strong points?points upon 
which the very future of civilized life 
as wp know it on this planet may hinge. 
We ought to realize that any amend-
ment to the treaty ?would necessitate ne-
gotiation of a new treaty by all of the 89 
countries that have already signed the 
treaty. 
Whether we realize it or not, the test 
ban treaty debate is one of three great 
debates of our century. The first great 
debate concerned the involvement of the 
United States in the League of Nations. 
The second great debate of the 20th cen-
tury concerned our participation in the 
United Nations. 
/ look back to the years following the 
creation of the League of Nations, when 
16735 
the United States as the most powerful 
nation on earth stood outside of the 
League, voiceless and helpless to stop the 
world from spinning recklessly into 
-World War II, even after thousands of 
Americans had died in World War I, the 
war to end all wars. We were powerless-
ly isolated, because of the failure of the 
U.S. Senate to endorse Woodrow Wil-
son's program to make the United States 
a part of the League of Nations. 
We saved no money; we saved no face; 
and we saved no lives. We merely weak-
ened our Nation instead of providing it 
with security as some Senators had 
hoped. When World War II came, we 
found ourselves again playing the role of 
savior of the free world?a job we were 
pitifully unprepared to do. -World War 
II bitterly taught us the lessons of the 
futility of isolation. As a result we be-
came a part of the United Nations, per-
haps reluctantly because of the possi-
bilities of losing our national identity in 
a world organization. Again, in that 
great debate, the security of our Nation 
versus the hopes of peace became the 
Issue. This fear of losing the identity of 
the United States in the bigness of a 
world organization still remains with 
many of us, but we would not withdraw 
the United States from the United Na-
tions, because there still remains the 
hope that we can find lasting peace 
through this organization. 
Today, we distrust the Russians, and 
rightfully so. However, we cannot mor-
ally permit this distrust to move us into 
a new form of isolation. We recognize 
Russia and the Communist world as the 
arch enemy of democracy and freedom. 
But we would smash into a thousand 
pieces the hopes of humanity for peace if 
we should reject this treaty. Our Nation 
and the world cannot afford another 
mistake like we made after World War I. 
Mr. President, on the one hand there 
is the threat of nuclear extinction for the 
great mass of our people as well as our 
enemy, and quite possibly the entire 
world, if we reject this treaty and move 
Into an unbridled nuclear armaments 
race. 
In this connection, there are also in-
creased hazards to the earth's popula-
tion, not only to people who are living to-
day but also to unborn generations. 
-Medical science is practically unani-
mous in the opinion that additional ra-
diation from continued atmospheric nu-
clear testing will cause significant human 
suffering as a result, with increased risks 
of cancer and other physical deformities 
and mental deficiencies. It has been es-
timated that 50,000 children, as of this 
date,-will be born into the world with 
gross mental or physical defects because 
a)f the genetic damage of fallout from nu-
clear tests. These defects will include 
such things as muscular dystrophy, can-
cer, blindness, dwarfism, and other major 
deformities. Unlimited and continuous 
nuclear testing in the atmosphere ob-
viously will increase these threats to our 
civilization. 
On the other hand, there is the possi-
bility, if this treaty is ratified, that our 
onemies_wollid not act in .P.Pd faith and 
'Would violate the treaty, possibly giving 
them a military advantage over ns.

167,36 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE September 20 
These points constitute the very essence' 
Of this debate. It has been stated by the 
scientists that any nuclear test which 
amounts to anything would be known a 
few minutes thereafter. Little harm 
could be done by at least entering into 
the agreement at this time. 
We must profit from the lessons and 
experience our past has given us and ac-
cordingly our answer to the world must 
be ratification of this treaty. If we reject 
It now, we are saying that we have given 
up all hope for peace and we are telling 
the world it must look forward only to 
an endless dark age of told war and ever-
threatening nuclear attack. 
If possible, I should like to get rid 
of the cold war?or at least a part of it. 
I want nci accusing finger of history 
pointing at this Senate and at me to 
say that we failed humanity because we 
? rejected this treaty. Our faith in our-
selves and in God Almighty must be 
greater than this fear or there will never 
be peace, and we shall never rid our-
selves of the cold war. 
We have lived with the cold war and 
within the shadow of H-bomb attacks 
for nearly 20 years, fruitlessly edging 
toward another world war. This treaty 
essentially changes nothing except to 
open the door of possibility for just and 
lasting peace. 
As a nation we must continue to be 
prepared for any eventuality and to do 
anything necessary to preserve our 
? Nation. 
? We must remain prepared at all times. 
In this connection, we must accept the 
word of our Joint Chiefs of Staff who 
have stated that we will not be weak-
ened by the signing of this treaty. 
In addition, the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
and the Secretary of Defense have as-
sured the Nation that we would be pre-
pared to resume testing should the So-
viets violate the treaty, and 'they have 
stated that the United States would be 
Able to detect any violations having any 
significance or any military 'Value. If 
we cannot accept their authority on this 
Subject, what can we depend upon in our 
military setup? In all of this, we owe 
It to the Creator of mankind and the 
world to do everything in our power to 
bring peace on earth. This treaty is 
within our power. This treaty contains 
the hopes for world peace and the way 
to achieve this without sacrificing our 
honor and freedom. 
Mr. President, this is why I have no 
other choice except to vote for the ratifi-
cation of this treaty. I do so without 
fear and without apology. The world 
must emerge from the night of distrust 
and into the light of peace. I want the 
United States of America to boldly and 
fearlessly lead the way, by signing and 
becoming a part of the peace treaty now 
before the Senate. 
Mr. SPARKMAN. Mr. President, I 
commend the Senator for a clear, con-
cise, and positive statement. It is a 
wonderful contribution. I commend the 
Senator for it. 
Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank the Sena-
tor. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. Mr. President, will 
the Senator yield? 
Mr. JOHNSTON. I yield. 
Mr. MANSFIELD. I commend the 
distinguished senior Senator from South 
California for the speech he has made 
this afternoon. It was to the point. I 
think the Senator made his position 
quite clear and quite understandable. 
Mr. JOHNSTON. I thank both the 
Senator from Alabama and the majority 
leader for the remarks they have made. 
After studying the problem, this is the 
only way I can cast my vote 
Mr. THURMOND. Mr. President, the 
Young Americans for Freedom, which is 
one of the finest and most patriotic 
organizations in the United States, has 
presented to me, for the Senate, a peti-
tion which bears the names of about 
15,000 people, from every State in the 
Union, who are opposed to ratification of 
the nuclear test ban treaty by the Senate. 
I should just like to read what the 
petition states: 
Young Americans for Freedom, the Na-
tion's largest conservative youth organiza-
tion in the land, has presented this petition: 
"Whereas the U.S.S.R. has broken 50 or 
52 major treaties cr agreements with the 
United States; and 
"Whereas no scientific evidence has been 
produced which assures the United States of 
detecting nuclear tests in the atmosphere 
by the U.S.S.R.; and 
"Whereas history has recorded that dis-
armament proceedings by the United States 
have encouraged the enemy to increase ag-
gression; and 
"Whereas the treaty will maintain the 
Communist U.S.S.R. superiority in the field 
of multhnegaton weapons and antimissile 
weapons; and 
"Whereas any agreement between the So-
viet Union, Great Britain, and the United 
States will imply our trust in the Com-
munist leadership, thus rendering our anti-
Communist efforts worthless; and 
"Whereas scientific evidence concludes that 
radioactive fallout from testing is not a 
danger in the immediate or foreseeable fu-
ture: 'rheref ore be it 
"Resolved, That the undersigned petition 
the U.S. Senate to defeitt President Ken-
nedy's nuclear test ban treaty with the Union 
of Soviet Socialist Republics." 
FAlowing that petition are the names 
of the various persons who signet, from 
various States. As I have stated, there 
are petitions signed by persons f rom 
every State in the Nation. 
I take this opportunity to commend 
the Young Americans for Freedom for 
their activity. in this connection. I had 
the pleasure of addressing the Young 
Americans for Freedom last spring. 
There must have been 18,000 to 20,000 
of them present in New York City at that 
time. 
It is most encouraging to find that 
thousands of young people on our college 
campuses and elsewhere are standing 
so strongly for freedom and the preser-
vation of a national defense posture to 
insure the maintenance of our freedoms 
in this country. After all, Mr. President, 
the future of our country belongs to our 
young people of today. 
I feel that this organization is render-
ing America a great service, and I am 
proud that the high caliber membership 
contained in the organization has seen 
fit to oppose the nuclear test ban treaty, 
even though it may not be the popular 
thing to do, and even though the propa-
ganda of all the networks and most of 
the news media in the United States?
not all, but most of them, and most of 
the larger ones, are taking a contrary 
position. 
Again, I commend the Young Ameri-
cans for Freedom. I congratulate them 
for the great service they are rendering 
to our country; and I especially com-
mend them for obtaining this petition 
against the nuclear test ban treaty. 
. Mr. COOPER. Mr. President, several 
weeks ago, after the conclusion of the 
hearings on the test ban treaty, I stated 
that I intended to vote for its ratifica-
tion. The debate throughout the hear-
ings, which I attended, in the testimony, 
and on the floor of the Senate has been 
comprehensive and, it seems to me, has. 
examined every argument that can be 
adduced for or against the treaty. In 
speaking today, I do not intend to dwell 
In detail On these arguments but, rather, 
state the conclusions which lead me to 
vote for ratification of the treaty. 
? I know that the treaty represents the 
culmination of efforts that have been 
made in various forms since World War 
beginningjn a very broad way under 
the adminiselttion of President Truman. 
Under the administration of President; 
Eisenhower negotiations were aimed di-
rectly toward a ban upon nuclear tests.. 
These efforts have been continued under 
the administration of President Ken-, 
nedy. The result of all these negotia-
tions and efforts is manifested in the 
treaty before the Senate. 
I am glad also that this effort has been 
truly nonpartisan. The effort has been 
made by Democratic and Republican ad-
Ministrations and Members of both par-
ties, and in particular, Senators who 
serve on important committees,, such as 
the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy., 
the Foreign Relations Committee, and 
the Armed Services Committee, have 
made great contributions. 
The minority leader of the Senate, 
Senator DnitcsEN, and the ranking mem-
ber of the Republican Party in the Sen-
ate, Senator AIKEN, have referred in. 
their speeches favoring the treaty to the 
provision of the Republican platform of 
1960 expressing the position of the party 
on this subject. This part of the plank 
reads: 
We are similarly ready to negotiate and 
to institute realistic methods and safeguards 
for disarmament, and for the suspension of 
nuclear- tests. We advocate an early agree-
ment by all nations to forego nuclear tests 
in the atmosphere, and the suspension of 
other tests as verification techniques-pertnit. 
We support the President in any decision he 
may make to reevaluate the question of re-
sumption of underground nuclear explosions 
testing, if the Geneva Conference fain to 
produce a satisfactory agreement. We have 
deep concern about the mounting nue:Lear 
arms race. This concern leads us to seek 
disarmament and nuclear agreeme:nts. And. 
an equal concern to protect all peoples from 
nuclear danger, leads us to insist that such 
agreements have adequate safeguards. 
I had the honor to serve as the chair-
Man of the subcommittee on foreign pol-
icy of the platform committee, at the 1960 
onvention. Our subcommittee con-
sulted with leaders at the convention.. I 
talked to Secretary of State Herter to 
make certain that this plank represented 
the policy of President Eisenhower's ad-
Approved For Release 2007/01/20: CIA-RDP65B00383R000100200003-7

ministration. 'I consulted with President 
,Eisenhower by telephone about certain of 
its clauses. Our subcommittee then ap-
proved this section of the platform, and 
It was adopted by the full platform corn-
.rnittee and the convention. 
I point these facts out not to say that 
the circumstances under Which we 
- adopted our plank at Chicago in 1960 
were the same as today, or that the 
treaty before us is in exact accord, nor 
to attempt to say what the Position of 
President Eisenhower or former Secre-
tary ?of tate Herter would be on this 
treaty?but simply to point out that the 
administration of President Eisenhower 
and the Republican Party had as their 
policy negotiations toward a safeguarded 
ban Oki nuclear testing. 
? In examining the treaty, I felt that it 
was my prime responsibility to determine 
Its effect upon_ the security of our coun-
try. Even the fact that many nations 
have acceded to the treaty cannot di-
minish this duty, for only the United 
? States has the power to protect its people 
and its free institutiOns. 
Today I have no doubt that certain 
risks attend the ratification of the treaty. 
I do not believe that such risks can be 
removed by reservations, understandings, 
or interpretations of the treaty. The 
risks lie either in the provisions of the 
treaty itself or in external facts regard-
_ 
Ing the relative nuclear capabilities of 
the United States and the Soviet Union. 
There is a risk that the Soviet Union 
? may breach the treaty by clandestine 
:testing. If it does, the testimony has 
indicated that any significant tests would 
be discovered, The United States could 
immediately abrogate the treaty, whether 
the breach of the Soviet Union was di-
rect or indirect, through the agency of 
'other countries, 
Article IV provides that "if any extra-
ordinary events related to the subject 
matter of this treaty" jeopardize the 
supreme interest of this country, 'we 
could withdraw after 3 months' notice. 
I would go further. It is my belief that 
If any event occurred which, in the 
opinion of the President or Congress, 
'threatened the security of the United 
States, the United States would have 
the right under international law, and 
the duty under the obligation of self-de-
fense, to abrogate the treaty immediately on the basis of the testimony that they 
- and take whatever steps might be neces- are?then I believe the true test of this 
sary for our security. The chief risk of treaty lies ahead. For its true and ex-
plicit purpose, in my view, is that it looks 
forward to two things. One is the ac-
complishment of further agreements 
which will reduce the extension of the 
nuclear arms race, such as an enforce-
able ban Qi1 Underground testing. This, 
of course, would be the necessary step 
along the route toward nuclear disarma-
ment by all countries. The second pur-
pose, it seems to me, is to create an at-
mosphere of some trust, in which the 
United States and the Soviet lJnion can

testified categorically that our recent 
tests provide information comparable to 
that of the Soviet Union with respect to 
communications blackout and anti-bal-
listic-missile systems. 
Other leading scientists, such as Dr. 
York and Dr. Kistiakov,rsky of President 
Eisenhower's administration supported 
Dr. Brown, and testified that the United 
States possesses superior nuclear power 
and can maintain this power. 
I also heard the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 
including General LeMay, in closed ses-
sion, hold that the risks were manageable 
if we maintain our ,scientific a,r,id military 
capabilities, and, while raising the 
question of the risks, as they should do, 
they approved the treaty. 
President Kennedy, in his message to 
the Senate on August 8, made this state-
ment: 
According to a comprehensive report pre-
pared by the responsible agencies of govern-
ment for the National Security Council, the 
tests conducted by both the Soviet Union 
and the United States since President Eisen-
hower first proposed this kind of treaty in 
1959 have not resulted in any substantial 
alteration in the strategic balance. 
I believe that the ultimate issue is 
whether it is a greater risk not to take 
this first step, whose chief purpose is to 
secure settlements of the situations in the 
world which create the danger of war, 
and to break the cycle of the nuclear 
arms race which overshadows the world, 
and if not halted may destroy it. Presi-
dent Kennedy has called the treaty a first 
Step toward agreements which would 
tend to prevent the possibility of a nu-
clear war. President Eisenhower, in his 
recent letter to the Foreign Relations 
Committee, said: 
But the greatest anticipated advantage is 
the hope?almost universally held by the 
earth's populations?that the consummation 
and meticulous implementation of the 
agreement might open the way to better re-
lations between the cold war opponents and, 
by small steps, bring about enforceable 
agreements for the reduction of the costly 
armaments race and progress toward the rule 
of law in the world. These promises and 
these hopes represent the major portion of 
advantages of the treaty. 
If we agree that the risks which we 
assume in ratifying this treaty are man-
ageable?and I have made up my mind 
the treaty, as such witnesses as Dr. Teller 
and General Power testified, and which 
has been argued forcefully by respected 
Members of the Senate, is that the Soviet 
Union has acquired from recent testing 
Information not available to the United 
States, information which enables it to 
develop an anti-ballistic-missile system, 
or systems, which could neutralize our 
cominunications and thus render useless 
our "second strike," which is the deter-
rent against any Soviet nuclear aggres-
Soviet troops in Cuba is an extension of 
the status quo which Khrushchev has 
contended should be maintained in East-
ern Europe. It is the first extension of 
Soviet force in the Western Hemisphere. 
It gives authority to Castro's regime, and 
support to subversion and aggression in 
the hemisphere. Its danger will continue 
until the Soviet military presence is 
ended. , 
I give these examples to reinforce my 
statement that the true test is ahead. 
If the Soviet Union will not, after the 
ratification of this treaty, make any ad-
vances toward a just settlement of these 
situations of confrontation, such as Ber-
lin and Cuba, if it Will not come to any 
agreement upon an enforceable ban on 
underground testing, then our country 
will have the duty to inquire again as to 
the purposes of this treaty and whether 
it benefits our security or the security of 
the world. And after a reasonable time, 
If no advances toward true settlements 
are made, then I believe it would be the 
duty of the United States to take what-
ever action our security demanded. We 
cannot know whether these advances to-
ward settlements, toward nuclear dis-
armament, are possible unless we take 
this first step. 
Mr. President, risks are inherent in 
the ratification of the treaty, but they 
are risks which the President and most 
of our military and scientific leaders, 
charged with responsibility, have told 
us categorically are manageable and are 
less dangerous than the failure to ratify 
the treaty. 
As long as our issues with Russia re-
main unresolved, we shall have to live 
in an armed state under the threat of 
war. lare,kave never thought very much 
about managing our own lives, our gov-
ernment, and our industrial economy 
during a long period of such danger, for 
we have never lived on the brink of a 
thermonuclear war. 
Our system is distinguished from that 
of the Soviet Union, for we believe in a 
moral order. We must maintain "tour 
defenses, and we will protect at what-
ever cost necessary the security and free-
dom of our country. 
I belieVe this is a first step. The Sen-
ate must make the determination wheth-
er tip risks, not wholly known, are as 
great as the refusal to take the first 
step?a step which may lead to other 
agreements?a step which may lead to 
ending the nuclear arms race. For the 
nuclear arms race always holds the pos-
sibility of nuclear war, whether planned 
or by mistake, in which there would be 
no victor?only the destruction of man-
kind.

answers of the State Department's Legal 
Adviser apply equally to these which I 
now ask unanimous request be placed in 
the body of the RECORD at this point. 
There being no objection, the answers 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
ANSWERS BY THE GENERAL COUNSEL OF THE 
DEPARTMENT OF DEITINTSE TO LEGAL QUES-
worm RAISED EY THE WORDING OF THE NU-
CLEAR TEST BAN TREATY 
Question I: Could a 'party to the treaty 
carry out a nuclear explosion in the at-
mosphere above an uninhabited island not 
claimed by it and justify its action Upon the 
ground that the explosion did not occur at 
a place under its jurisdiction or contral? 
Answer: No. The words "at any place 
Under its jurisdiction or control" in the 
first paragraph of article I of the treaty 
apply only to that paragraph and are nec-
essary as a legal matter since a party to the 
treaty would have no authority to prohibit 
or to prevent nuclear explosions at places 
not under its jurisdiction or control and 
accordingly would not be able to fulfill any 
treaty obligation to prohibit or to prevent 
nuclear explosions at such places. It should 
be noted, however, that a party would be 
construed temporarily to have control over 
any place where it conducted a test, and 
therefore paragraph 1 would proltbit a party 
from conducting a test in the circumstances 
hypothesized. In any event, the second 
paragraph of article I prohibits a party, it-
self, from conducting a nuclear test in the 
three environments anywhere. 
Question 2: What nuclear explosions in 
outer space are banned by this paragraph 
in view of the fact that outer space, and 
partinularly the more remote regions there-
of, is not considered to be within the juris-
diction or control of any nation? If Russia 
explodes a nuclear device in outer space and 
We claim that such action is prohibited by 
this paragragh, are we placed in 4 position 
Where we must simultaneously admit that 
Russia has jurisdiction over or controls the 
particular region of outer space in Which the 
explosion occurs? 
Answer: No. As was the case in ques-
tion 1, a party is prohibited by paragraph 2 
from conducting tests in the three environ-
ments without regard to the question of 
"jurisdiction or control," and by paragraph 1 
by virtue of the temporary control. 
Question 3: Would a nuclear explosion 
Underwater in the middle of the Pacific 
Ocean be barred by this paragraph in view 
of the fact that the high seas are not con-
sidered by nations to be within the control 
or jurisdiction of any particular nation? 
Answer: Yes. Such a test would be barred 
by article I for the reasons given in answers 
land 2. 
Question 4: Does the ban on "any other 
nuclear explosion" prevent us from operate 
frig atomic energy plants for the produc-
tion of electricity, the steamship Savannah, 
or any attemic submarine, all of which are 
operated by means of controlled atomic 
explosions? 
Answer: No. Atomic energy reactors, which 
release energy slowly, do not produce a nu-
clear explosion within the meaning of the 
treaty. 
Question 5: Will we be branded as a vio-
lator of the treaty if we have an accidental 
explosien at one of our atomic energy plants? 
Answer: No. An accidental explosion of 
one of our atomic energy plants would not 
constitute a violation of the treaty; the treaty 
is aimed at intentional acts. 
Question 1: Does paragraph 2 apply to di-
rect acts of the parties or only to indirect 
acts of the parties? For example, does it 
apply to a nuclear explosion by Russia in 
the atmosphere above Russian soil or is it 
intended to apply only to such a situation 
as a nuclear explosion by the Communist 
Chinese regime in the atmosphere above 
Ciaina which iscaused, encouraged, or par-
ticipated in by Russia? 
Answer: Paragraph 2 of article I is in-
tended to bar a party from conducting tests 
itself in the three environments (direct acts) 
and from giving materials for use in nuclear 
weapons, or information relating to their 
design or manufacture to any other state 
whether or not a party, if that state was en-
gaged in, or proposed to engage in, nuclear 
weapons tests in the three environments (In-
direct acts). 
Question 2: If paragraph 2 does apply to 
direct acts of the parties, how do you resolve 
the conflict between its provisions, which 
are not limited by tbe phrase "at any place 
under its jurisdiction or control," and the 
provisions of paragraph 1, which are limited 
by such phrase? 
Answer: As shown by the answer to the 
preceding questions, there is no conflict be-
tween the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2. 
The two paragraphs overlap to some extent. 
The words "jurisdiction or control" do not 
limit paragraph 2 because paragraph 2 does 
not impose an obligation to prohibit or to 
prevent. 
us 
Question: If the United States decides to 
withdraw from the treaty because it has ir-
refutable evidence that Russia has violated 
It, would we not be compelled to wait 3 
months before resuming nuclear testing un-
less we were willing to risk being branded 
as treaty violators? 
Answer: It is clear under international law 
that the United States would not be com-
pelled by the treaty to wait 3 months before 
resuming nuclear testing if Russia violates 
the treaty. 
DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, 
Washington, September 19, 1963. 
Ron. MARGARET CHASE SMITH, 
U.S. Senate, 
Washington, D.C. 
DEAR SENATOR Sturm: As I explained to you 
over the telephone last evening, I am ex-
tremely sorry that I did not see your letter of 
September 10 relative to the 16 questions on 
the test band and I am particularly sorry 
that I did not see or sign the outgoing letter. 
I agree with the answers to your questions 
given by Secretary Rusk, and I am in full 
agreement with the ;statements made by the 
President in his letter to Senators MANSFIELD 
and DnucsEx?some of which deal with mat-
ters raised by your questions. Nevertheless, 
I would like to take this opportunity to offer 
some further comment on a few of the ques-
tions which you posed on September 9. 
Specifically, I refer to your questions 2, 9, 
and 11. 
Your second question WEA: "Are we reason-
ably confident and secure in the knowledge 
that our ballistic missile retaliatory second 
strike force will survive and operate in a 
nuclear environment?" This is of course a 
Very important matter. You have the infor-
mation concerning missile-site survivability 
contained in my earlier remarks, referred to 
by Secretary Rusk. I would like to add a few 
comments on the ability of our missiles to 
penetrate enemy defenses. 
Present penetration capability, as you 
know, depends-upon saturation of defenses?
upon numbers of weapons, decoy design, 
salvo techniques, and nuclear technology. 
The limited test ban Sreaty does not affect 
the first three of these factors. It is relevant 
only to the last of them. Ballistic missile 
reentry vehicles and Warheads are susceptible 
to both blast and radiation. The latter can 
be tested sufficiently underground. Although 
blast cannot' be tested underground, we have 
Information from which to extrapolate blest 
effect and, are able to build around uncer-
tainties. Furthermore, we have every rea-
son to believe that the Soviet Union has 
had no more experience in the testing of rele-
vant blast effects than have we. 
Because of the extremely large number of 
U.S. missiles and penetration aids available 
for saturating Soviet defense, I am confident 
that, in any event, sufficient U.S. striking 
power not only can survive attack but can 
penetrate to destroy the Soviet Union. 
In your ninth question, you asked: "Can 
we, in fact, maintain an adequate readiness 
to test in those prohibited environments in 
the event the treaty should suddenly be 
abrogated?" You are familiar with the testi-
mony on this point and, with Deputy Secre-
tary Oilpataie's letter to Senator RUSSELL, in 
which he dealt with the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff safeguard (c). I am convinced that 
we can maintain a state of readiness such 
that we will be ready to perform proof tests 
within 2 months, development tests within 
3 months, and (by a year from now) effects 
tests within 6 months. We are, now, im-
proving test support facilities, which include 
preparation and maintenance of off-conti-
nent support bases and test sites. We are 
obtaining diagnostic aircraft, instrumented 
ships and aircraft, weapon drop aircraft, and 
sampler and other support aircraft; and we 
are preparing operating bases on Johnston 
Island and in the Hawaiian area. Also, the 
Atomic Energy Commission and Department 
of Defense test organization is being kept 
strong and ready. 
Your 11th question was: "Will we be 
restrained from ever determining feasibility, 
developing and deploying any defense what-
ever against ballistic missile attack?" In my 
testimony, I addressed this point quite fully, 
but two points are worth repeating: First, 
we should bear in mind that, while an anti-
ballistic missile system might be very impor-
tant, it is unrealistic to expect any foresee-
able antiballistic missile system to be effec-
tive enough to save a nation from great harm 
in the event it is attacked. Second, the non-
nuclear_ aspects (capacity for decoy discrim-
ination, traffic-handling capacity, reaction 
speed, and missile performance) dominate 
the problem of developing an effective_ anti-
ballistic missile system. The nuclear aspects 
involved are warhead development and the 
nuclear effects problems of self-kill and 
blackout. The treaty, as you are aware, has 
no bearing on the nonnuclear features. War-
head development can continue through 
underground testing, and some of the impor-
tant questions of self-kill can also be re-
solved by underground testing. Questions 
relating to blast, as in the case of incoming 
warhead kill, referred to on the previous 
page, cannot be solved by underground tests, 
but we have information from which to ex-
trapolate blast effect and are able to build 
around uncertainties. And atmospheric test-
ing would be needed to provide either tide 
further understanding of the blackout phe-
nomenon?a phenomenon which has been 
probed in different ways, with what I believe 
to be comparable success, by both the United 
States and U.S.S.R. We believe that our 
latest atmospheric tests revealed the approx-
imate limits of the blackout problem. If the 
antiballistic missile problems unaffected by 
this treaty could be resolved, the uncertain-
ties caused by gaps in our understanding of 
blackout could be circumvented through 
conservative design. Those responsible for 
the UB. antiballistic missile program believe 
that the Nike?X system can be developed and 
deployed without further atmospheric test-
ing. Moreover, it .is their judgment and the 
judgment of those respensible for making 
intelligence estimates on Soviet capabilities 
that our efforts In developing an antiballistic 
missile system are comparable, if not su-
perior, to those of the Soviets.

superior scientific knowledge manifest-
ing itself in superior weapon design. 
The treaty will still permit further quan-
titative deployment of weapons systems, 
but its ratification will acknowledge So-
viet superiority in critically important 
areaS of nuclear technology having mili-
tary qualitative significance 
Question 4. The treaty will not pre-
vent the spread Secretary Rusk and Mr. 
William Foster said-that a comprehen-
sive ban would prevent the spread of 
nuclear weapons but it should have the 
effect of retarding the rate at which 
other nations, apart from France and 
Red China, might have otherwise ac-
quired a nuclear capability. 
Question 5. Secretary Rusk and Dr. 
Brown would view an explosion which, 
although within the legal letter of the 
treaty, releases most of its energy into 
the atmosphere as a treaty violation. 
"Underground" has not been sufficiently 
defined. 
Questions 6 and 7. The worry here is 
the fact that we cannot detect low kilo-
ton yields in the atmosphere. Accord-
ing to Dr. Teller, exposure of radars and 
communications devices and other elec-
tronic gear could upset the nuclear bal-
ance, although these are nonnuclear de-
vices, in discovering ways to make them 
operate efficiently in a nuclear environ-
ment, that is, overcoming blackout for 
example. 
Question 8. Question 8 is related to 
the definition of underground. If, as is 
contended, we will abrogate the treaty 
upon detecting a test which, though shal-
lowly buried and the radioactivity from 
which is confined to Soviet territorial 
boundaries, then there would be no need 
to differentiate. One can, however, vis-
ualize some heated arguments arising 
over the contention by the Soviets that 
they conformed to the letter of the treaty 
in whatever they did. Differentiation 
then, between shallow burial and atmos-
pheric, is important. 
Question 9. One can accept the data 
given as to time periods of readiness for 
different types of tests. The question is 
whether they are acceptable from the 
standpoint of national security in the 
face of another sudden abrogation by 
the Soviets. We are told that this is a 
large risk.

entists deteriorated tinder the mora-

of warhead froth decoy, traffic handling, 
reaction and radar blackout are prob-
lems which would be eliminated by this 
concept and it is one of the unresolved 
questions concerning the sophisticated 
nature of the Soviets recent tests and 
their sudden willingness to sign the 
treaty.

than just next year's planned test, more 
accurately answers the question. 
Question 14. Elsewhere in the debate 
other facts, figures, statistical studies and 
opinion have appeared. The truth of the 
matter is?we do not know. My question 
was designed to emphasize in the debate 
that the propagandized emotionalism on 
this point is so highly exaggerated. 
Question 15. Plowshare, despite claims 
to the contrary, is generally pro-
hibited by the treaty and the administra-
tion has admitted that it must be negoti-
ated out. Senator SPARKMAN properly 
introduced as part of his answer, Presi-
dent Kennedy's letter of September 10, 
1963. 
Question 16. The excerpt from the 
testimony of Secretary Husk appearing 
on page 7 of the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee report and the State Department 
answer are that the answer is no and 
that even when asserting privileges of 
participating and voting on amendments, 
and so forth, we would reserve the right 
to object. 
Mr. HICKENLOOPER. Mr. President, 
the proposed test ban treaty pending be-
fore the Senate is a remarkable docu-
ment; rernarkable not so much for what 
it does, but for the questionable hopes 
it may have aroused not only in this 
country, but throughout the world. 
At the outset, I want to point out that 
this proposed treaty is the outgrowth of 
some nuclear origins. I will try to point 
out later how it is different from the pro-
posals of the Eisenhower administra-
tion?but in any event the speed with 
which this document was accepted and 
signed can well promote inquiry. 
It is intriguing to consider why the 
Russians, after 4 or 5 years of adamant 
refusal to get down to business on any 
serious discussion of the basic principles 
involved in this proposed agreement, 
suddenly, early this past summer appar-
ently, sent word that they were ready to 
talk and we rushed a delegation to Mos-
cow, went through a few ceremonies, 
obligingly inserted the ; antiplowshare 
provision in the treaty and initialed It 
with very little, if any, negotiation. 
I sincerely regret that the President 
has seen fit in effect to claim executive 
privilege over the exchange of corre-
spondence between the United States 
and the U.S.S.R. preliminary to the sign-
ing of this treaty. Under the Constitu-

tion, the Senate is a coequal partner with 
the President in the act of making a 
treaty. 
Even if it should be acknowledged that 
the claim of executive privilege might 
properly lie in some areas of executive-
congressional relations, certainly it can 
not rationally be held to he in the field 
of treaties, where surely the Senate' is 
entitled to full access to all facts sur-
rounding the negotiation of a treaty, in-
cluding examination of pertinent docu-
ments, when called upon to carry out its 
constitutional duty of giving or with-
holding consent to the ratification of 
that treaty. 
The very act of exercise of executive 
privilege is bound to plant seeds of sus-
picion and mistrust in the mind of the 
public and to affect public confidence. 
I regret that the majority of the Senate 
Foreign Relations Committee chose not 
to support the effort of members, includ-
ing myself, to obtain this information 
regarding the test ban treaty in accord-
ance with the constitutional powers and 
prerogatives of the Senate. 
Although the treaty prohibits nuclear 
tests in the atmosphere, in outer space, 
and under water, and this is significant, 
the President of the United States found 
it necessary, when he submitted the 
treaty to the Senate, to emphasize what 
the treaty does not do. He said: 
It does not prohibit the United States and 
the Soviet Union from engaging in all nu-
clear tests; 
It will not halt the production or reduce 
the existing stockpiles of nuclear weapon's; 
It will not end the threat of nuclear war 
or outlaw the use of nuclear weapons; 
It cannot wholly prevent the spread of 
nuclear arms to nations not now possessing 
them; 
And finally he said: 
It does not assure world peace. 
Mr. President, I emphasize these neg-
ative aspects of the treaty because in 
the last 6 weeks the American people 
have been overwhelmed with state-
ments, official and otherwise, which have 
tended to blunt our critical faculties. 
Compared to the things the treaty 
does not do, its positive aspects are rath-
er thin. The treaty does, as the chair-
man of the Foreign Relations Commit-
tee stated recently, represent a small 
step. However, I am not sure that I 
agree with the distinguished chairman 
that the step is a positive one in the 
right direction. It does represent, 
however, some break with the past; and, 
as such, it may open possibilities in the 
future?some favorable, some perhaps 
unfavorable. 
THE HAZARDS OF' ACCEPTANCE 
Approval of this treaty by the U.S. 
Senate will subject the security of this 
Nation to political, scientific and mili-
tary hazards. Among the hazards 
which must not be overlooked are the 
following: 
First. There is the hazard that the 
Soviet Union, in its test series. of 1961 
and 1962 may have gained knowledge to 
enable the Soviet to make a great leap 
forward, either in the development of 
niultimegaton bombs or e creation of 
an effective antiballistic missile system. 
We do not know how much they may 
have learned and it is possible that the 
Soviet Union only seeks time to go into 
production on devices of military poten-
tial that may ultimately give the Soviet 
a preponderance of nuclear power. 
Second. There is the hazard of clan-
destine testing. Although American de-
tection devices are extremely good, the 
area of the Soviet is vast and techniques 
for secret prohibited testing may make 
it possible for the Soviet to increase its 
nuclear competence without our knowl-
edge. 
Third. There is the danger that the 
Soviet Union will overtake the United 
States in, nuclear developments by un-
derground testing which is permitted by 
the treaty. There is no doubt but that 
at the present time the United States 
is ahead in the field of underground test-
ing, but since the Soviet will be permit-
ted to test in this environment, it may 
be expected that in time they will learn 
as much in this area as we now know. 
Fourth. There is the danger of a vast 
ruse. Suspicious as I always am of So-
viet declarations of intent, there is al-
ways the passibility that the Soviet 
Union and Communist China have 
agreed to disagree?each to pursue its 
own path?the hard line by Peiping and 
the soft line by Moscow?with the assur-
ance that when the time is right the 
forces of international communism will 
coalesce to .the everlasting detriment of 
the free world. Certainly Soviet du-
plicity in the past gives us no reason in 
precedent to' believe that the word of 
Khrushchev is any more reliable than 
the word of Stalin. 
THE HAZARDS OF REJECTION 
One must balance against the hazards 
of accepting the treaty, the hazards of 
rejection. Both are speculative. And in 
the final analysis each Member of this 
body must reach his own judgment as to 
whether he believes the national security 
of this Nation justifies acceptance of this 
agreement. 
First. One of the hazards of rejection 
which bothers:, me greatly is the effect 
which Senate rejection would have upon 
our posture throughout the world. Once 
the President authorized Under Secre-
tary of State Harriman to sign this 
agreement on behalf of the United States 
it became most difficult for the Senate 
to express its independent judgment on 
the treaty. Certainly, rejection of the 
treaty at this point would dash the 
hopes--many of them unjustified I be-
lieve?of the more than 90 nations which 
have already indicated their willing-
ness to accept its terms. 
Second. There is the hazard that re-
jection of this treaty might tend to heal 
the rift which has opened between the 
Chinese Communists and the Russian 
Communists. If this rift is real, if it has 
substance, then rejection of the treaty 
might force Khrushchey to aline himself 
once again with Peiping and one-third 
of mankind would be drawn together in 
support of international communism. 
Third. A further hazard of rejection 
might be a consequence of developments 
within the Soviet Union itself. Undoubt-
edly, there are those in that society who 
believe that the United States is not will-
ing to risk nuclear war to defend its in-
September 20 
terest. We must not forget that it was 
only last October that under the cloak 
of a deliberate and calculated falsehood 
IChrushchey himself was willing to chal-
lenge us in Cuba and remains ever ready 
to exploit our weakness there. If K:hru-
shchev is not able to reach an agreement 
now on a nuclear test ban treaty, one 
result may well be to strengthen the 
hands of the most extreme elements in 
the Kremlin. 
Fourth. There is a hazard that nuclear 
weapons may be proliferated if we do not 
accept this treaty. At least eight non-
nuclear powers now have the capacity to 
develop weapons on their own. Rejection 
of this treaty might invite them to do 
so and thus multiply the chance of 
planned or accidental precipitation of 
nuclear exchanges. Certainly a rejec-
tion would necessitate the immediate re-
sumption of atmospheric tests by the nu-
clear powers. 
Mr. President, I have given careful 
consideration to the hazards that will 
face this Nation if we approve the treaty 
or if we reject it. On balance and in 
view of the whole spectrum of circum-
stances, it seems to me that we have no 
firm choices?that we must, even though 
with misgivings, consent to the treaty. 
I listened with greatest of care to the 
many witnesses who appeared before the 
joint conamittees holding hearings on 
the treaty. It was apparent to me that 
many of those witnesses were torn by 
strong doubt. The Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Joint 
Chiefs themselves, left me with the im-
pression that if the treaty were to be ac-
cepted or rejected solely upon the 'basis 
of its military implications, that they 
would have been forced to recommend its 
rejection. When they took into account, 
however, the political implications of the 
treaty, they were willing to accept the 
military dangers in the expectation of 
receiving overall political benefits for the 
United States. 
I am consenting to the treaty, although 
I am thoroughly convinced that the 
Kremlin will breach it if such breach 
seems to its advantage. As the moment 
I believe the Kremlin finds certain ad-
vantages in the treaty, but we should be 
under no misapprehension that this 
treaty will be anything but a scrap of 
paper at any moment it serves the inter-
est of the Soviet Union to so regard it. 
The second concern I have about the 
consequences of approving this treaty is 
that I fear a gradual erosion of our de-
termination to maintain our defenses in 4 
a state of readiness. In other words, we 
could be lulled into a false feeling of se-
curity and let our guard down. This 
Nation in the past has easily been lulled 
into a sense of false security. Indeed, 
our swings of public opinion are phe-
nomenal It is hard to believe that only 
a year ago when the Russians put mis-
siles in Cuba and the Chinese Commu-
nists attacked India, we were concerned 
that international communism might 
make war inevitable. And yet today we 
find in our country a wave of propagan-
da suggesting that we should have confi-
dence in the word of the very man who 
put missiles in Cuba a year ago, de-
stroyed the test moratorium in 1951, and

196$ CONGRESSIONAL RECORD? SENATE 16743 
refused to meet with Eisenhower a few 
years earlier, shortly after he had come 
to the Unite,a States allegedly to proffer 
a hand of friendship 
It is essential that: in subscribing to 
this treaty we do so, maintaining our-
selves in a constant state of readiness to 
renew tests, determined that we will con-
tinuously modernize our detection de-
vices, determined to keep our laboratories 
in operation, and that we proceed with 
an expanded program of underground 
testing. 
,A great __deal of misinformation has 
been bandied about concerning this three 
environment test ban treaty. One fre-
quent statement is that it is the same 
proposal which was submitted by Presi-
dent Eisenhower during his administra-
tion and which was endorsed by the Re-
publican Party in its platform of 060. 
This 18 definitely not true, Even without 
considering the changp of circumstances 
and Of the relative position of the world 
powers concerning nuclear technology 
between the date of the proposal of the 
Eisenhower administration and the pres-
ent, the proposals are dissimilar. 
To mention some,ef the differences, the 
Eisenhower proposal did not take into its 
purview nuclear testing in outer space 
Where techniques had not been developed 
to permit verification of violations; nor 
did that aclzninistration propose to en-
able the Seviet 'Union_ to veto each and 
every project by the United States or any 
other treaty-signatory for the peaceful 
use of atomic devices ,for such purposes 
as diverting hurricanes, digging chan-
nels and canals; in other words, the 
plowshare program. 
Again, the Republican platform in 
1960 stated: 
We are similarly ready to negotiate and to 
institute realistic methods and safeguards 
for disarmament and for the suspension of 
nuclear tests. We advocate an early agree-
ment by all nations to forgo nuclear tests 
In the atmosphere, under the suspension of 
other tests as verification techniques permit. 
We support the President in any decision he 
may make to reevaluate the question Of re-
sumption of underground nuclear explosives 
testing if. the Geneva Conference fails to 
produce a satisfactory agreement. We have 
deep concern about the mounting nuclear 
arms race. This ,concern leads us to seek 
disarmament and nucle_ar agreements. And 
An equal concern to protect all peoples from 
nuclear danger leads us to insist that such 
agreements have adequate safeguards. 
The present treaty bans nuclear 
weapon tests in outer space, an environ-
ment in which verification will be very 
difficult because, notwithstanding anti-
cipated and programed improvements in 
our verification system, the system will 
still possess both detection and identifi-
? cation thresholds below which clandes-
tine testing will be possible with low 
probability of detection. Furthermore, 
the draft of, the limited test ban treaty 
tabled in Geneva, August 27, 1962, by the 
.V.P.ItettS,14akexes1 United Kingdom dele-
gations prohiMted only nuclear weapon 
'tests and would have permitted explo-
sion of nuclear devices for peaceful pur-
poses; however, the present treaty, by 
-prohibiting all nuclear explosions in the 
three environments, prohibits in per-
petuity?unless amended?and amend-
inent would require the unanimous con-
sent of the three major originating 
powers, which would give the Russians a 
veto over any amendment which might 
be proposed to the treaty?many peace-
. .., 
ful uses of nuclear explosive devices 
where any radioactive debris can escape 
to another nation. TlUis, if the treaty is 
ratified, nuclear devices can be used only 
for the pursuit of war and death, and 
only in a most limited way for peaceful 
purposes. 
Although I am worried about the ex-
tension' of the test ban intii environ-
ments in which we have limited verifi-
cation capability at this time, I have 
great confidence in the ability of our 
scientists and technicians to develop ex-
peditiously systems which will prevent 
significant clandestine testing. How-
ever. I have very serious misgivings 
about the long-run Wisdom of agreeing 
to prohibit in perpetuity the most prom-
ising use of explosion of nuclear devices 
for peaceful purposes, which will fore-
close the plowshare program. I am con-
vinced that, if Russia really wants a 
treaty, then continued and persistent 
negotiation would have achieved an 
agreement which would have permitted 
peaceful use of "clean" nuclear explosive 
devices subject to reasonable controls, 
such as prior notice to the treaty signa-
tories and opportunity for observation, 
enabling science to explore fully the ex-
citing potentials of this nuclear age and 
enabling the world to exploit fully its 
economic and humanitarian possibilities. 
The failure to provide for this is in my 
opinion the greatest demonstrable de-
fect of the treaty. 
Ar,vIes AND CcasTSENT 
I should like now to discuss for a 
moment the question of advice and con-
sent in connection with the treaty. 
In recent years, Mr. President, we 
have witnessed a gradual erosion of an 
important article of the Constitution?
article 2, section 2. That section provides 
that the President shall have: 
Power, by and with the advice and con-
sent of the _Senate, to make treaties, pro-
vided two-thirds of the Senators present 
concw. 
Thus, it appears to be clear that the 
President has no "power" to make 
treaties prior to Senate action and it 
would therefore follow that he has no 
power to bind us in advance of authoriz-
ation by the Senate. 
However, as in the proposed test ban 
treaty now before us, we find that, from 
a practical standpoint, the President ne-
gotiates proposed treaties, and then sub-
mits them to the Senate for its advice 
and consent. Up to this point the docu-
ment is no more than a tentative execu-
tive agreement. ? 
? I submit that this procedure involves 
seeking the "consent" of the Senate, but 
It does not technically carry out the con-
Stitutional mandate to obtain the "ad-
vice" of the Senate. It is difficult indeed, 
if not impracticable, to advise after the 
act, especially under the circumstances 
which we face now when we have en-
couraged some 96 nations to sign the 
proposal before we have finalized it under 
our constitutional process. 
As a practical matter, when the Presi-
dent or one of his sagents signa a solemn 
instrument such as that now before us, 
it becomes most difficult for the Senate 
to do anything but gir its consent, espe-
cially under the pressures of domestic 
and worldwide propaganda that-. have 
been built up. The Senate in the case 
now before us is not' being asked to give 
its advice. The Senate as a practical 
matter can only consent to this treaty, 
or reject it. 
There was a time when Presidents seri-
ously sought-the "advice? of the Sen-
ate prior to the negotiation of treaties. 
This stihj ea is discussed in the Foreign 
Relations Committee report in 1946 on 
acceptance of the Compulsory jurisdic-
tion of the International Court?Senate 
Report No. 1835, 79th Congress 2d ses-
sion. 
At that time the constitutional ques-
tion was raised as to Whether?and I 
quote from the report: 
It is proper procedure to obtain the advice 
and consent of the Senate prior to deposit 
of the declaration by the President. 
The answer of the committee, which 
deserves the most careful consideration, 
is as follows: 
With respect to the second issue, the an-
swer may be found in the Constitution itself, 
Article 2, section 2, provides that the Presi-
dent shall have "power, by and with the ad-
vice and consent of the Senate, to make 
treaties, provided two-thirds of the Senators 
present concur.? It is evident that the ad-
vice and consent of the Senate is equally 
effective whether given before, during, or 
After the conclusion of the treaty. In fact, 
President Washintgon approached the Sen-
ate for its advice and consent prior to the 
negotiation of treaties, and this practice was 
followed on occasion by other Presidents. 
While the practice of prior consultations-with 
the Senate fell into disuse after 1816, a re-
cent precedent may be found in the conven-
tion of 1927, extending the General Claims 
Commission, United States and Mexico, of 
1923. The treaty was signed on August 16, 
1927, pursuant to a Senate resolution of Feb-
ruary 17, 1927. A similar example is the con-
vention of 1929, again extending the life of 
the Commission. The convention was signed 
on August 17, 1929, pursuant to the Senate 
resolution of May 25, 1929. 
I suggest, Mr. President, that the kinds 
of hazards involved in the negotiation 
and signing of treaties on such important 
subjects as that now before us makes it 
vitally important for the Senate, the 
President, and the scholars of this Nation 
to explore once again the feasibility of 
obtaining the advice and consent of the 
Senate prior to the signature of import-
ant treaties. 
It is not enough for the executive 
branch of this Government to come to 
the Senate with general drafts, of trea-
ties, and occasional consultations. The 
Senate and the Committee on Foreign 
Relations in particular need to partici-
pate more actively in the negotiations 
? as they near the point of consummation. 
It is my recollection that at the time 
the North Atlantic Treaty was being ne-
gotiated the Committee on Foreign Re-
lations had opportunity to go over semi-
final drafts, argcle by article, and that 
as a. result, of that Meticulous work a 
number of drafting changes were made 
in the treaty. The same was true with 
respect to the peace treaty with Japan. 
I cannot help but believe that had the 
,pending treaty been submitted to the

CONGRESSIONAL' RECORD ? SENATE 
Close scrutiny ,and unhurried dissection 
by the Committee on Foreign Relations 
prior to its finalization by the Executive, 
we would not now be cOnfronted with 
such ambiguous language as that which 
has created serious doubts as to whether 
the treaty may prohibit the use of nu-
clear weapons in the event of hostilities 
and other serious questions which have 
been stated. 
I believe the executive branch should 
take clear warning from the questions 
that have been raised during considera-
tion of this treaty. It Must rethink its 
approach to the Senate in connection 
with any future negotiations looking to-
ward any limitation upon the defensive 
arrnaments of this country. I seriously 
doubt if the necessary two-thirds vote 
Could be obtained for another treaty on 
this general subject if such treaty were 
negotiated in haste and submitted to the 
Senate on a take-it-or-leave-it basis, 
somewhat in the fashion of this treaty 
and the situation in which we find our-
, 
SelVes. 
There is no reason in law or in our 
Constitution why the Senate should not 
be asked formally to give its advice and 
consent to a draft treaty prior to the 
signing cerenionies,' Subh a practice in 
the case of our most important treaties 
may on occasion in the future save the 
President not only from the embarrass-
ment of repudiation?as happened in the 
case of the Treaty of Versailles?but it 
would protect this Nation from situations 
such as that with which we are now con-
fronted?situations in Which the mili-
tary, scientific, and political judgments 
of _the Senate are in danger of being 
Warped by the argument that all we can 
do is to advise and consent to ratification, 
or we will be repudiating the President, 
embarrassing the Nation, and compro-
mising our leaders*. 
In the last analysis, we probably find 
ourselves in a pOSition where we must 
accept this treaty with a certain degree 
of cautious hope, but at the same time 
with the determination and increased 
vigilance for our own security and that 
of the free world. The treaty itself pro-
vides no steps for the creation of in-
creased posture for peace or for dimin-
ishing the threat of war. I am not 
greatly worried about the suggestions 
that the treaty may bar us from using 
atomic Weapons in case our SecuritY is 
acUtely threatened, because I think it is 
inherent in tie sovereign rights of na-
tions to use whatever means are avail-
able for their protection in time of great 
danger. The administrative branch of 
our Government and the legislative 
branch are both committed to this phi-
losophy irrevocably. By the same token 
so Is the gremlin. 
I have little patience with the argu-
ment that we must make this treaty or 
that we must take various other steps 
to establish our devotion to the cause of 
'peace and freedom. 
The whole record of the United States 
Is one of continuous devotion of life and 
treasure to the cause of peace and free-
dom in the world. We gave much in 
World War I and it was our strength 
and sacrifice that preserved free institu-
tions in Europe and protected them else-
where. We asked nothing from that 
victory except a Peaceful world. 
We led in the ' disarmament confer-
ences of the 1920s; we constantly gave 
our good offices inthe interest of settling 
international disputes. The life and 
treasure which we expended in World 
War II and the More than $100 billion 
--of our substance Which we have poured 
out since to help troubled and groping 
nations reestablish themselves or move 
toward the forms of freedom surely can 
not be forgotten Or disregarded. 
Following World War II, when we 
were the sole pasessor of the atomic 
bomb and the means of production, we 
did what no other country, to my knowl-
edge, has done in the history of the 
world?we offered to turn over to the 
United Nations all atomic weapons, 
atomic materials and the means of proc-
essing them for international control, 
provided other countries would do the 
same. This was generally referred to 
as the Baruch Plan. I say this was 
unique because I know of no other time 
in history when a nation possessing the 
means and the weapons to conquer any 
or all other nations on earth, voluntarily 
offered to give uP this exclusive means 
in the interest of civilization and peace. 
We have constantly conferred, at-
tempted to negotiate and put forward 
countless fair and equitable proposals 
that would diminish the chances of war. 
We have proved over and over our 
sympathy with and devotion to peace 
and human betterment. 
On the other hand the Kremlin has 
constantly blocked every effort and re-
fused every realistic offer that would 
promote peace with reasonable and mu-
tual safeguards. Is it any wonder then 
that we want proof of good will by deeds 
on the part of international communism, 
and that we fear new promises which 
can, and no doubt will be, broken with 
the same cavalier attitude that we have 
seen so frequently in the past? It can-
not be argued persuasively that Pre-
inter Khrushchev is different from Stalin, 
because both hate been instruments of 
international connmunism and it is the 
voice of international communism that 
speaks through them, and it is the phi-
losophy of international communism 
which they implement and not the per-
sonal philosophy of either of them or 
any one man. 
If the policy of international commu-
nism says break the agreement, the pre-
viously given wbrd of the individual 
means nothing. 
There are many ways in which inter-
national communism could by deeds 
show its good faith. The Kremlin could 
keep its agreement for free elections in 
the Iron Curtain countries; it could re-
store freedom tp the Latvian States, 
which it aggressively took over not much 
more than a year after it had made 
solemn treaty agreements to respect 
their sovereignty and freedom. 
The Kremlin itould remove its heel of 
conquest from East Germany and by ac-
tion remove thei threats to Berlin and 
the peace of Furdpe. 
The Kremlin could cease its false 
propaganda and active' subversive 
threats in Africa, Latin America, and 
other areas of the world. 
September 20 
If the Kremlin really believed in the 
basic rights of the people it could with-
draw from the ;arena of international 
conquest and devote its energies and 
resources toward the betterment of the 
Russian people. 
They know that we would welcome, 
with rejoicing, news of this kind that 
would bring proof through deeds that 
they were sincere in their protestations 
for peace, but it is in the light of past 
experiences that we must examine our 
course and future and that we must ex-
plore and determine the vigilance which 
we must exercise. The world knows 
that we have no designs hostile to any 
other country, but I think the world also 
knows that until international commu-
nism alters it adamant course away from 
world dominion and by action adopts 
policies of genuine consideration and 
respect for the rights of others, that our 
own security and that of the free nations 
of the world must regrettably depend 
upon superior strength and realism. 
In closing I wish to recite a little story 
which was written to me the other day 
in a leter by a constituent from Iowa. 
He said that in dealing with the Russians 
we should always keep in mind the story 
of the hunter and the bear. 
The hunter went to the woods one 
day; and deep in the woods he saw a bear 
approaching. The hunter raised his 
gun and aimed it at the bear. The bear 
suddenly stopped and said, "Wait, hunt-
er. What do you want? We will nego-
tiate." The hunter said, "I want a fur 
coat." The bear said, "Good. I want 
a good meal. Let us negotiate." So 
they sat down and negotiated; and, 
after a while, the bear walked away. 
The hunter had his fur coat and the bear 
had a good meal. 
In our dealings with the Russians in 
the past too often the bear has walked 
away with a good meal and we have had 
a fur coat of sorts. It is a situation 
caused by naivete which should not be 
permitted to exist very long. We should 
beat in mind that we are dealing with a 
ruthless, expert group of manipulators 
to whom morals as we apply them do not 
appeal and by whom they are not ac-
cepted. 
We must bear in mind that our inter-
ests and those of the free world still must 
rely on our constant ability to defend 
ourselves and the interests of freedom 
under all circumstances. In accepting 
this treaty we must recall that it is the

I shall vote for the treaty because I

I shall vote for the treaty notwith en-

Kingdom propbsal of August 27, 1962, for a 
ban on nuclear tests in the atmosphere, 
outer space, and underwater. This proposal 
was substantially the same as that contained 
in the treaty now before the Senate. 
Hearings at which a three-environment 
ban was discussed with appropriate commit-
tees of the Senate, have occurred on frequent 
occasions beginning prior to the August 
27, 1962, proposals. Mr. William C. Foster, 
Director ,of the Arms Control and Disarma-
ment Agency appeared on July 23, 1962, be-
fore the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, 
and on July 25, 1062, before the Disarma-
ment Subcommittee of the Committee on 
Foreign Relations te dismiss the status of the 
nuclear test? ban negotiations )hen being 
conducted in Geneva at the Eighteen Nation 
Disarmament Conference. 
The Senate's advice was sought from the 
_outset. As stated by Mr. Foster to the Dis-
armament subcommittee: ' 
"The purpose of this meeting with you, 
Mr. Chairman, is to put before you before 
the decision has been inade some of the al-
ternatives which are being considered for 
recomMendation to the President for his de-
cision. And that decision has not yet been 
taken." 
Mr. Foster outlined four possible positions 
to both committees. One of these positions 
was to draft a treaty banning nuclear tests 
in the atmosphere, outer space and under-
water. Members of the committees discussed 
the advantages and disadvantages of this 
proposal with Mr. Foster at some length. 
On August 2, 1962, Ambassador Arthur H. 
Dean, U.S. representative to the Geneva 
Disafmainent Conference, accompanied by 
Mr. Foster appeared before the Joint Com-
mittee on Atornfe Energy and the Disarma-
ment Subcommittee of the Committee on 
Foreign Relations. The purpose of these 
appearances was to inform the committees 
'about the contents of Ambassador Dean's 
Instructions regarding the nuclear test ban 
prior to his return to the negotiations at 
Geneva. Both the comprehensive test ban 
proposals and those for a ban on tests in time still had not been agreed, and the out-
the atmosphere, outer space and underwater standing differences, as well as the nature 
were discussed. and effect of the agreed parts of the text,

for .a limited Unclear test ban: of August 27, 1962. The appropriate corn-
tied during these hearings. 
On March 11, 1963, the status of the test 
ban negotiations, including a ban on tests 
in the atmosphere, outer space and under-
water, was discussed with the Disarmament 
Subcommittee of the Committee on Foreign 
Relations by Secretary Rusk accompanied by 
Mr. Adrian S. Fisher, Deputy Director of the 
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. 
On May 7, 1963, hearings on the nuclear 
test ban before the Preparedness Investi-
gating Subcommittee of the Armed Services 
Committee were resumed with the appear-
ance of Mr. Foster. During succeeding 
months a long list of military and technical 
witnesses appeared before the subcommittee 
including representatives of the Arms Con-
trol and Disarmament Agency, the Atomic 
Energy Commission, the Defense Atomic 
Support Agency, the Air Force Technical 
Application Center, the AEC Weapons Labo-
ratories, and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The 
initial focus of these, hearings was upon the 
U.S. proposal for a comprehensive treaty 
banning all nuclear weapons tests. How-
ever, repeated discussions of a limited test 
ban were included, and the focus of the in-
vestigation was shifted to the limited treaty 
once it had been initiated in Moscow. 
As previously indicated, the specific series 
of negotiations, which finally achieved 
agreement on the limited treaty now be-
fore the Senate, began in Moscow on July 15, 
1963. Key Members of the Senate were ad-
vised informally of the status of the nego-
tiations and asked for advice during their 
course. On July 23 and 24, 1963, Secre-
tary Rusk, accompanied by Mr. Foster, ap-
peared before the Armed Services, the For-
eign Relations, and the Joint Atomic Energy 
Committees to report on the status of the 
negotiations and secure the advice of these 
present on the draft as it then stood. These 
hearings occurred prior to the initialing of 
the treaty by Under Secretary Harriman in 
Moscow on July 25. The draft treaty which 
was discussed with the committees at that 
16745 
mittees were also consulted before the 
treaty was initiated and before it was signed. 
In addition to formal hearings, numerous 
informal contacts with various Senators and 
their staffs on the subject of the nuclear 
test ban negotiations in general and a three-
environment ban in particular have occurred. 
A particular effort has been made to keep 
Senators who were members of the commit-
tees having an interest in arms control mat-
ters fully informed. In addition to individ-
ual contacts, a series of breakfasts specifical-
ly to discuss arms control and nuclear test 
ban matters were held. All members of 
the Armed Services, Foreign Relations and 
Joint Atomic Energy Committees were in-
vited to attend one or more of these break-
fast briefings. The views of Senators who 
have expressed an interest in the subject 
have also been sought on an informal basis. 
The only possible conclusion from the 
foregoing is that the advice of the Senate 
was repeatedly sought by the executive 
branch before and during the course of the 
negotiations which culminated in the treaty 
before the Senate.
