 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE        January 18, 1966
 HIS TROOPS ENTER GERMANY
 The next stage of the offensive came in
 October with the capture of Aachen and the
 bloody battle of the Hilrtgen Forest in No-
 vember.   The forest,  a major element in
 Hitler's Siegfried line defense, was one point
 where the German Army turned and fought
 after the headlong retreat that followed the
 Normandy breakout.
 From November 1944 to February        1945,
 General Hodges' 1st Army struggled to break
 the stubborn Wehrmacht resistance in the
 rugged,  snow-covered  forest.    Seventeen
 American divisions were committed against
 a Wehrmacht force nearly as large.  Seventy
 thousand  German  and  American    soldiers
 died in the woods.
 "It was one of the most bitterly contested
 areas in the European theater," Gen. Dwight
 D. Eisenhower wrote in his memoirs.
 Meanwhile, in mid-December 1944, Field
 Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt breached the
 Allied positions in what became known as
 the Battle of the Bulge.  After 2 weeks of
 bitter fighting in the Ardennes in freezing
 weather, the Germans' last-ditch offensive
 was thrown back and the 1st Army resumed
 Its offensive.
 On March 7, the let Army reached the
 Rhine through the ruins of Cologne.  Then
 elements of the 9th Armored Division cap-
 tured, intact, the Remagen Bridge over the
 Rhine, thus giving General Hodges a firm
 bridgehead on the east bank of the Rhine,
 without a bloody, contested crossing.
 The 1st Army then moved east and north
 with a circling movement, and after joining
 forces with the 9th Army, captured 300,000
 prisoners in the Ruhr.  The 1st Army then
 drove to the Elbe, where it made the first con-
 tact with Soviet troops, at Torgau.
 Born in Perry, Ga., on January 5, 1887,
 Courtney Hodges always wanted to be a mili-
 tary man.  He was elated, after finishing high
 school, to get an appointment to West Point,
 the U.S. Military Academy.  However, he had
 troubles with geometry and had to leave.
 After a year of clerking in a Georgia grocery
 store, he joined the Army in 1906 as a private.
 Three years later, now a sergeant, he en-
 tered a competitive examination and was
 commissioned a second lieutenant.  He served
 with General Pershing in Mexico from March
 1916 to February 1917.  In World War(I, he
 served as regimental commander with the 6th
 Infantry Regiment and fought in the St.
 Mihiel and Meuse-Argonne offensives.
 One source of great satisfaction to him was
 the fact that he returned to West Point as
 an instructor in the department of tactics in
 1920.  He was the first nongraduate to serve
 as an instructor.
 SERVED  IN  PHILIPPINES
 Between the wars he made several tours of
 duty at the Army's schools, including the
 War College in Washington.  A short while
 later he was assigned to the 7th Infantry at
 Vancouver Barracks in the State of Washing-
 ton.                      He next served in the Philippines and
 returned to the United States in 1938 to be-
 come assistant commandant and later coin-
 mandant at the Infantry School, Fort Ben-
 ning, Ga.
 In 1941, then a brigadier general, he was as-
 signed to the office of the chief of infantry
 in Washington.  He became acting chief, then
 chief of infantry.  In 1942 General Hodges
 activated the X Corps as a part of the 3d
 Army and later became 3d Army commander
 at Fort Sam Houston, Tex.  A year later he
 was ordered abroad as deputy commander to
 Gen. Omar N. Bradley, who was then com-
 mander of the lst Army.  On August 1, 1944,
 the general took over 1st Army as General
 Bradley was. put In command of the 12th
 Army group.  General Hodges became a full
 general on April 15, 1945.
 After World War IT, General Hodges came
 with the 1st Army headquarters to Governors
 Island. He retired here January 31, 1949, and
 moved to San Antonio.
 Mr. PROXMIRE.  Mr. President, I ask

 VIETNAM
 Mr. CLARK.  Mr. President, on the
 subject of Vietnam, yesterday I had oc-
 casion to question whether the news
 story in the New York Times suggesting
 that the President was going to impose
 a deadline on his peace drive was accu-

 e
 t ? th  f th
 d th
 Budget's recent phony economy move
 cutting back funds for the special milk
 program for schoolchildren-funds ap-
 propriated by Congress-I would like to
 examine the cutback's impact on one
 very important new society program.
 This Congress passed a revolutionary
 education bill last year-the Elementary
 and Secondary Education Act of 1965.
 The purpose of the act, and I quote, is to
 "provide financial assistance to local edu-
 cational agencies serving areas with con-
 centrations of children from low-income
 families to expand and improve their
 educational programs which contribute
 particularly to meeting the special educa-
 tional needs of educationally deprived
 children."
 Mr. President, this purpose is ill served
 by cutting back Federal funds for the
 special milk program.  Studies show that
 when the price of milk to schoolchildren
 is increased by even 1 cent, and such
 an increase will occur in some areas be-
 cause of the Federal cutback, it is the
 children of the poor who go without first.
 These are the very children which this
 Congress has done so much to help
 through the Elementary and Secondary
 Education Act of 1965.
 Some of my colleagues may say:. "What
 does drinking 1 or 2 half pints of
 milk a day have to do with good grades"?
 Not much, is my answer, when the child
 eats well at home.  But when the big
 meal of the day is eaten at school, when
 parents are too poor to afford milk for
 their children, then that extra half pint
 or two can make all the difference in the
 world in a child's ability to concentrate
 and learn.
 In the words of Earl Langkop, director
 of the Legislative Committee of the
 American School Food Service Associa-
 tion :

 Mr. Moyers denie
 story.  The White House said that no
 deadline had been set for ending Presi-
 dent Johnson's peace offensive.
 One gentleman representing the ad-
 ministration who does not seek anonym-
 ity and does not object to being quoted is
 Mr. Arthur Goldberg, U.S. Ambassador
 to the United Nations, who is quoted in
 today's New York Times as saying that
 the peace drive will reach fruition. Our
 Ambassador to the United Nations, for
 whom I have almost unbounded admira-
 tion, is quoted in this article as saying
 the U.S. offensive for peace in Vietnam is
 "bound to reach fruition:"  He said that
 the U.S. peace offensive begun by Presi-
 dent Johnson late last month had already
 succeeded in convincing the world that
 America wants peace.  He said:
 I am convinced that it is bound to reach
 fruition, if not now, then in time to come.
 He said that with patience peace can
 be attained if Americans endure the or-
 deal of patience.  The United States, he
 said, has not yet received a response from
 Hanoi on proposals to end the war in
 Vietnam.  In this respect, he said:
 We can still not report success or failure.
 I still believe that all efforts to reach
 success must continue.
 In this connection, James Reston;
 well-known associate editor for the New
 York Times, last night commented on
 our policy in Vietnam.  He asserted that
 the war in Vietnam should be pursued as
 one of limited objectives, and that the
 correct way was the middle way-and I
 think he is correct-which rules out in-
 tensification of the war, or peace on
 terms that would lose the country.
 Mr. Reston points out, as I have be-
 fore, that the United States can defend
 the perimeter of Saigon and the coastal
 areas where most of the people of South

 appropriations  should  be  made im-
 mediately.
 It is not my intention to substitute the
 direct loan program for the disaster loan
 program of section 7(b)  of the Small
 Business Act.  In fact, section 7(b) can-
 not apply to a situation such as existed
 in New York City, for it does not satisfy
 the disaster requirements of that section.
 However, it is generally agreed that sec-
 tion 7(a) is properly suited to meet the
 economic situation which existed in New
 York City.
 On January 5, 1966, I wrote to Mr.
 I )avis urging him to take immediate ac-
 tion to make direct loans under section
 7(a) available to the people of New York
 City out of any fund the agency might
 have or to seek additional appropriations
 when Congress reconvened.  The Admin-
 istration 2 days later made available the
 %;20 million previously mentioned.
 The SBA cannot be allowed to sit idly
 by and wait for these economic disas-
 ters  to  arise  elsewhere.              The  agency
 must be prepared to meet any future
 contingency. Yet, I am aware of no ac-
 Lion on the part of the SBA to seek
 ,supplemental appropriations  at  this
 time.  According, as another step in the
 continuing effort to strengthen the small
 business loan program, I have advised
 (lie President of the seriousness of the sit-
 uation and have asked his heln in the
 matter.
 I ask my colleagues to join with me
 in seeking prompt action by the Admin-
 istration in order to place the small busi-
 ness direct loan aarogram on its feet.
 ;5ARGENT  SHRIVER'S   IMPERISH-
 ABLE  CONTRIBUTION  TO  THE
 PEACE CORPS
 Mr. PROXMIRE.   Mr. President, the
 departure of Sargent Shriver from the
 Peace Corps is an appropriate time to re-
 mind the Senate of the remarkable con-
 tribution of this unusual man.
 If any American program has clearly
 planted the taproots of peace in the
 world, it is the Peace Corps.  Through-
 out the world and throughout America
 the Peace Corps is cheered as a happy
 combination of idealistic dedication and
 practical good sense.
 It has not only been established on the
 basic principle of winning peace by help-
 hlg people help themselves to a better
 life, but it has also been initiated and
 administered in a brilliant manner.
 This is where Sargent Shriver comes
 in.  How many beautiful and idealistic
 plans have foundered because of incom-
 petent, feeble, and uninspired adminis-
 tration.
 In an international world of jealous
 oompetition, featured by militant mili-
 tsrry competition, the Peace Corps might
 easily have become another casualty of
 the cold war and the cold heart.
 But under Sare':ent Shriver's policies of
 discriminating and enthusiastic recruit-
 ment, his determination not to let his
 men become involved in diplomatic or
 intelligence   activities   overseas-their
 only job being to help people help them-
 ^crives-the Peace Corps has become our
 r.  at international asset.
 As the Foreign Minister of Thailand
 said:
 This important idea, the most powerful
 idea in recent times, of a Peace Corp,,,. of
 youth mingling, living, working with youth--
 and that it should come from the mightiest
 Nation on earth, the United States.  Many of
 us who did not :snow about the United St.; tes
 thought of this great Nation, endowed with
 great material strength and many powerful
 weapons.   But :')ow many of us know that in
 the United States ideas and ideals are also
 powerful?
 Sargent Shriver has served his na-
 tion-and, indced, all mankind-well in
 the Peace Corps.  As he departs it, he
 richly  deserves  his  nation's  grateful
 thanks.
 DEATH OF GEN. COURTNEY HODGES
 Mr. PROXMIRE,       Mr. President, Gon.
 Courtney  Hodges  died  on Sunday       I
 happen to have followed closely Gen-
 eral Hodges' brilliant military career be-
 cause he was the cousin of my wife, the
 former Ellen Hodges.
 General Hodges, like so many of his
 close relatives, was a quiet, gentle person
 of strong character.  As the New York
 Times said in its obituary', he was a
 southern gentleman.
 General Hod:tes' career should insnire
 many Americans who encounter disap-
 pointments and setbacks in their lives.
 His dearest ambition was for a military
 career, and he enthusiastically accepted
 an appointment to West Point, but was
 forced to :Leave after a year, because of
 difficulties with the mysteries of geam-
 r,try.
 Lut Courtney Hodges refused to quit.
 Ile entered the Army as a private, and
 worked his way through the ranks to he-
 eome a general and commanding officer
 of the 1st Army in World War H.  He
 directed the brilliant campaign of that
 army from August 1, 1944, through some
 of the toughest fighting in World War
 If, juggling corps and divisions as he
 chased the enemy..  Paris fell to the 1st
 .Army, then it went across the Aisne and
 the Marne through Belgium.  Hodges'
 army was the first U.S. troops to enter
 Germany. It captured Aachen, won the
 bloody  battle  of the Hurt?,en Forest,
 marched through the ruins of Cologne,
 across  the     Rhine  over  the famous
 1Zenlagen Bridge, and then joined the tth
 Army, capturing 300,000 prisoners.
 General Hodr;'es retired as a full gen-
 eral in 1949.                                                                He has left his family and
 his Nation a proud legacy.
 I ask unanimous consent that an edi-
 toral on Courtney Hodges' career pub-
 lished in todays Washington Post, and
 an article from this morning's New York
 '.1`irnes be printed in the RECORD.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 and article were ordered to be prinked
 in the RECORD, as follows:
 [From the Washington          Post,
 Jan. .18, 19661
 COURTNEY HICKS HODGES
 G-en Courtney  H. Hodges, who died  )n
 Sunday at 79, will always occupy a pl:i.ce
 of high honor in the ranks of his countr.`s
 military heroes. Re assumed command of
 the :;cat 1st Army in August 1944, shoe Jy
 after the Normandy invasion, and led it to
 a, series of dazzling victories.   It was the
 first American force to enter Paris, the first
 to march on German soil, the first to cross
 the Rhine, and the first to make a juncture
 with the Russians at the Elbe.
 At  the  age  of  18  General  Hodges was
 dropped from West Point because of dif-
 ficulty with mathematics and told that he
 was not meant to be a soldier. Had he not
 ignored that judgment and enlisted in the
 Army as a private, the Nation would have
 lost one of its greatest infantry generals.
 Perhaps the most fitting tribute to Court-
 ney Hodges was paid by his wartime com-
 mander, Gen. Omar N. Bradley.
 In "A Soldier's Story," Bradley writes of
 General  Hodges  as  a  "spare,  soft-voiced
 Georgian without temper, drama. or visible
 emotion" who tended to be "left behind in
 the European headline sweepstakes."      Yet
 he emerges as "a general's general."    "Tor
 Hodges," Bradley  concludes,   "successfully
 blended dexterity and commonsense in such
 equal portions as to produce a magnificently
 balanced command.  I had implicit faith in
 his judgment, in his skill and restraint."

 SAN  ANTONIO,  TEx.,  January   16.-Gen.
 Courtney H. Hodges, commander of the 1st
 Army in its victorious drive through France
 and Germany in World War II, died today
 at  Brooke  General  Hospital,  He  was  79
 years old.
 A hospital spokesman said the retired gen-
 eral, who had lived here since 1949, died of a
 heart attack.
 He is survived by his widow, Mrs. Mildred
 Lee Hodges; two brothers and five sisters, all
 of Georgia.
 A  SOUTHERN  GENTLEMAN
 Courtney Hicks Hodges rose from a private
 to general, after dropping out of the U.S.
 Military Academy in 1905 because he had
 difficulty with geometry.  In more than 40
 years of military duty that included service
 with Gen. John J. Pershing in Mexico and
 as commander of the 1st Army in Europe in
 1944, General Hodges carved a distinguished
 career.
 He was a small, spry, quiet Southern gen-
 tleman who called his officers by their first
 names, but still remained rather  distant.
 "He isn't the kind of fellow who has a nick-
 name," a longtime associate once said.  "No-
 body ever calls him anything but Courtney."
 General  Hodges  was  neither     a back-
 slapper nor a seeker of publicity.                                                                                                                                 As a re-
 sult, he usually came off second best    in
 headlines, overshadowed by  such   colorful
 generals as George S. Patton, Jr., and Brit-
 ain's Bernard Law Montgomery.
 "Georgie and I were old friends," General
 Hodges once said.  "He had one job with his
 army; the lst had another.  We were a zonal
 army.    We just slugged.  Publicity?  Some
 people just naturally attract attention-- and
 all my friends tell. me I look more like a
 schoolteacher than a general."
 It was on August 1. 1944, 2 months after
 participating in the D-day landings in Eu-
 rope, that General Hodges took over the 1st
 Army.  His drive into Germany was one of
 the most dramatic campaigns of the war and
 an example of unorthodox leadership, as the
 general juggled ccrps and divisions while
 chasing the enemy.
 Paris fell to the Ist Army on August 2',5,
 1944.  Passing through and around the city,
 General  Hodges'  forces  moved  across  the
 Aisne and the Marne and reached the Bel-
 gian frontier on September 2.                                                                                                                                   They lib-
 erated Liege on the 8th, crossed Luxembourg
 and  reached  the  German  border    on  the
 11th-the first U.S. troops to enter Germany.

 January 18, 1966        CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - SENATE
 is going to be one of seeking negotiations
 for peace in Vietnam not on a bilateral
 arrangement between the United States
 and our enemies in this uncontitutional
 war, but on the basis of sitting down at
 a negotiating table with representatives
 of noncombatants at the head of that
 table representing the United Nations.
 Until that is done, I say to the Ambas-
 sador of the United States in the United
 Nations that I am not at all impressed
 by the discussion taking place behind the
 scenes in the United Nations. It is about
 time that we go to the United Nations
 directly on the issue of peace in Asia in
 accordance with the procedures set out
 in the charter.
 NATIONAL WILD RIVERS SYSTEM
 Mr. MORSE.  Mr. President, I an-
 nounce at this point that in respect to
 the debate which is to take place this
 afternoon in regard to the wild rivers
 bill, the Senator from Idaho and I have
 tentatively agreed to go along with a
 series of proposed amendments that will
 protect the objectives of the wild rivers
 bill and at the same time give my State
 the protection to which I think it is
 clearly entitled in respect to the matter
 of condemnation and exchange powers
 granted to the Secretaries.  Also as to
 the matter of encouraging the counties
 to develop a county zoning program we
 will suggest a proposed amendment.  I
 believe these amendments are vitally nec-
 essary to protect Federal interests as well
 as the interests of the people of Oregon
 in connection with sound public land
 policies in my State of Oregon.
 I hope that before the afternoon is
 over our proposed amendments will be
 approved by the Senate.
 I wish at this time to express my very
 deep appreciation to the Senator from
 Idaho for his fairness and willingness
 to accept amendments that will iron out
 in a fair and satisfactory manner the
 major objections I raised yesterday.
 I believe that the last thing that the
 Senator from Idaho said in debate last
 night, as the RECORD will show, was that
 he hoped that the Senator from Oregon
 and he could reach a conscionable com-
 promise. I believe we have one to offer
 this afternoon.
 OUR COMMITMENT IN VIETNAM
 Mr. LONG of Louisiana.  Mr. Presi-
 dent, I notice in today's press that it is
 the intention of the' President and the
 Secretary  of  Defense  to strengthen
 American forces in Vietnam.
 It seems to me-and I believe the ma-
 jority of Senators believe-that a part
 of a continuing struggle has been in
 existence  for 20  years,  and perhaps
 longer, if one considers it in a broader
 sense.
 We propose to see that those who do
 not want to be enslaved by Communist
 aggression or any other kind of aggres-
 sion are helped and supported when they
 seek to resist that type of aggression.  It
 is our feeling that to permit aggression
 to succeed in a place of this sort is to
 set the stage for a bigger fight some-
 where -else.
 Accordingly, when people seek to resist
 aggression and we give our commitment
 to help them, it seems important that
 the aggression should not be permitted
 to succeed, because to do so would mean
 an expansion, and in this case it would
 mean eventually the loss of southeast
 Asia, and eventually all of Asia, and
 eventually perhaps the loss of more than
 that.
 We believe that the best hope for an
 honorable and lasting peace in the world
 is the stopping of aggression in the areas
 where it starts.  That is what we are
 doing.
 It is important that in undertaking
 that task we not encourage the'aggres-
 sor by confronting him with less force
 than is needed to stop his aggression and
 throw it back. We are doing that. Per-
 haps we are not doing enough of it.
 I am pleased that the President is
 determined to see that our efforts will
 succeed. An honorable peace is what we
 seek. But we do not seek any peace that
 would permit enslavement of those who
 would like to be on the side of the free
 world, and we do not propose to nego-
 tiate any sort of peace that would per-
 mit those who fight for freedom on our
 side to be hunted down and slaughtered,
 as we have seen happen when commu-
 nism has taken over in other areas of
 the world.
 TRIBUTE TO EVERARD H. SMITH
 Mr. COTTON.  Mr. President, I desire
 to call the attention of the Senate to
 an editorial which  appeared in the
 Hampton (N.H.) Union for January 13,
 entitled "Two Trillion Dollars and Ever-
 ard H. Smith."
 I ask unanimous consent that the
 editorial may be printed in the RECORD
 at this point in my remarks.
 There being no objection, the editorial
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:
 Two TRILLION DOLLARS AND EVERARD H.
 SMITH
 Two trillion dollars is still beyond the
 comprehension of most of us and there aren't
 many people in these parts who ever heard
 of Everard H. Smith.
 Senators AIKEN and PROUTY could tell you
 who Smith Is.
 So could Senator NoRRIS COTTON.
 The late Senator Styles Bridges could
 have told you all about Smith just as he
 told you when he was alive that billions add
 up to trillions.
 Smith retired from his job down in Wash-
 ington the other day.
 The Washington newspapers carried his
 picture and a little story about him.  It is
 possible  that  some  newspaper  outside of
 Washington may have mentioned that Smith
 was getting through but we doubt it.   They
 wouldn't  know  Smith and  neither would
 they understand the importance of the work
 he has been doing under the dome of our
 National Capitol for 52 years.
 This Mr. Smith went to Washington in
 1913.  That was before we were barn.  He
 went to  work for  the  then  U.S. Senator
 Martin, of Virginia, who was chairman of
 the Appropriations Committee. Martin hired
 Smith  "to do some little  odds  and ends
 around the office for awhile." Smith stayed
 on to become chief clerk to the committee
 and in the course of 52 years handled ap-
 propriation bills totaling $2 trillion.
 Smith was one of the ablest public serv-
 vants we have ever known.  He occupied
 his high place and did his important work
 humbly.  He was respected by Senators of
 both political parties and it mattered not
 whether  the  chairman  of the  committee
 from time to time was Republican or Dem-
 ocrat,  the  chairman  leaned  heavily                                                                                                upon
 Smith and enjoyed Smith's allegiance.
 We have a thought that Everard H. Smith
 will find his way up Capitol Hill many times
 in the future sort of by force of habit. We
 hope this will be the case. But whether
 he is at home with his slippers and pipe
 or basking in the friendships of the Hill,
 we send to Everard from the winter beauty
 of New England our commendation and best
 wishes.
 Mr. COTTON.  Mr. President, this is
 a moving tribute to a loyal and dedicated
 public servant who gave 52 years of his
 life, as the writer suggests, in effective
 and yet unsung labor. As a member of
 the Senate Appropriations Committee, I
 share fully in this fine expression of com-
 mendation and good wishes.
 INDIANA COLLEGE STUDENTS SUP-
 PORT  ADMINISTRATION'S  POL-
 ICY
 Mr. BAYH.   Mr. President, college
 students of Indiana in large numbers
 recently have expressed strong approval
 of the administration's policies in Viet-
 nam.  A list signed by over 16,000 stu-
 dents certifying this support was pre-
 sented to Governor Branigin late in De-
 cember and a number of public rallies
 for the same purpose have been held on
 various campuses.
 Typical of the latter was a gathering
 at Purdue University just before the
 Christmas holidays where more than 700
 students and staff members assembled
 outdoors in freezing temperatures for an
 enthusiastic session.  Professors Ken-
 neth Kofmehl and James Dornan deliv-
 ered well-received talks stressing the
 soundness of present policy and the dan-
 gers of  appeasement.   In order that
 other Members of Congress may read the
 descriptions of this important rally, I ask
 unanimous consent that articles from
 the Purdue Exponent, Lafayette Courier-
 Journal, Indianapolis Star, Indianapolis
 News, and the New York Times be
 printed in the RECORD at this point in
 my remarks.
 There being no objection, the articles

 "'he Governor gave his complete support

 'or  frecdorr, of speech to work there must

 "We canno_. permit an articulate minority
 Ln cenvey Inc impression that they repre-
 ;;cnl, I:he VIP WS of all."
 I:n si tic rl iil, the administration's policy
 in Vietnam, Professor Kofinehl noted that
 the Chinese Conimu;rists  are looking next
 to  '['bollard  where  they have  announced
 ;upport    for  Thailand  Patriotic Front's ef-
 fbrt. to liberate Thailand.
 "We do Trot have to speculate about the
 plans of the Chinese Communists, they have
 obligingly provided us with a clear state-
 raeiit of  their                         plans     for  world  conquest.
 After Thailand  will  come other countries
 iii Asia, Africa, and Latin America until we
 ire surrounded by Communist countries and
 ripe for this treatment ourselves," exclaimed
 1'rotessor Kolmehl.
 i KIND                                    PREMISES
 'lie adnihiistration's policy in Vietnam
 is based on sound premises-  Appeasement
 led to a world war in which 40 million people
 died.  In executing current strategy, our ad-
 iidnutration has held out the carrot as well
 >> i t:sed the ::tick.
 ""'here is no guarantee that our policy will
 :succeed.   It. r.oquires wit and will to suc-
 ceed.  However, appeasement and peace at
 any price will surely fail and find us en-
 crircied and helpless," Professor Kofinehl de-
 ciarcd.

 Tai the enthusiastic applause of his stu-
 den? audien"e he challenged, "Yours has been
 characterized as the committed generation,
 the generation seeking involvement.                  What
 nobler cause is there fcr                   you  to commit
 yourselves to  than  freedom                    for ourselves
 and  other  freedom  loving                 peoples  of  the
 world?  Hence I urge you to support our ad-
 niiniatration's wise and brave effort to do
 this."
 Professor   Dornan  opened                      by  stating,
 "meetings  Of  this kind constitute an im--
 portarit part of the deoisionmaking process
 of a tree society."  He then switched to bit-
 ing reprimands of such groups "of the far left
 a:: 5 U.S., acid the Dubois, and the May ,t
 n. tovernent."
 '1"ion delving directly into the war in Viet-
 ram, Professor L)ornan said, "since 1917 and
 ,enin's rise to power in the Soviet Union,
 Communist nations have waged unremitting
 wax against, freedom at home, and pursued
 ri.nrelentlesslp   policies   of   expansionism
 abroad."   Dorian continued,       "the  war in
 Vietnam    m ty    well  be  the   most  decisive
 .truo[gle of She entire cold war period."
 Pi ui:easor ijornan concluded, "if we do not
 now raise the costs of guerrilla war, subver-?
 Sion, and indiroct aggression to such a level
 i,itat  the Chinese find such activities tin-
 protitable,  laten we can look for such con-
 !fir

 WALTER   LIPPMANN'S   ASTUTE
 ANALYSIS OF THE U.S. DILEMMA
 IN VIETNAM
 Mr. GRUENING.            Mr. President, in a
 series of recent articles, Mr. Walter Lipp-
 mann, in his usual astute manner, has
 penetratingly analyzed the bases for
 U.S. involvement in Vietnam and the fu-
 ture ahead if escalation in our military
 commitment takes place.
 Pointing out the hard decisions facing
 President Johnson, Mr. Lippmann stated
 on January 17, 1966, in Newsweek:
 A sine qua non for any possibility of
 bringing the undeclared war in Vietnam to
 the conference table is a continuation of
 the policy of not bombing North Vietnam.
 That policy should continue.
 I ask unanimous consent that there be
 printed at the conclusion of my remarks
 the following articles by Walter Lipp-
 mann: an article entitled "The Presi-
 dent in the Morass" which appeared in
 the Washington Post on January 4, 1966;
 an article entitled "The Mansfield Re-
 port" which apepared in the Washington
 Post on January 11, 1966; and, an article
 entitled "The Next Move," which ap-
 peared in the Washington Post on Janu-
 ary 6, 1966; and, an article entitled "The
 President's Hard Decision," which ap-
 peared in Newsweek on January 17, 1966,
 and "The Guns-Versus-Butter Stereo-
 type" which appeared in the Washington
 Post on January 18, 1966.
 There being no objection, the material
 was ordered to be printed in the RECORD,
 as follows:

 TODAY   AND   TOMORROW :   THE   MANSFIELD
 REPORT
 (By Walter Lippmanii)
 The return of Congress marks the end of
 the period in which the President has had
 the unquestioning support of some 60 to
 70 percent of the people.  It has always
 been remarkable, as in law and public mor-
 als it has been unseemly, that this country
 should be committed to a war which has
 never been explained except in resounding
 generalities, and has never been debated se-
 riously.  This  surreptitious  war  has  been
 feasible because the people are disposed to
 trust the President and to assume that in
 a question of war and peace in a distant
 continent he is in a position to know more
 than they do.
 But now there is a new element in the
 situation.  His conduct of the war has been
 tested for a year on the battlefields of south-
 east Asia.                    What the public has been told
 about the strategy and the prospects of this
 war is now being measured by the actual
 results, which the people are beginning to
 find out about.  The crucial turning point
 has come with the publication of the re-
 port which                    contains the findings  of  five
 Senators, led by Senator MANSFIELD and in-
 cluding Senators AIKEN, MUSKIE, BOGGS, and
 INOUYE.   Here for the first time we have a
 report on the war which is responsible, in-
 formed,                        and  trustworthy.  Except for the
 reports of a few enterprising and independ-
 ent newspapermen, the American public has
 had to depend on information made avail-
 able in official briefings in Saigon and Wash-
 ington.
 The contradictions between the briefings
 and the facts, as they. have gradually become
 visible, has undermined public confidence.
 The grim fact is that by conducting the war
 furtively there has developed, as Ambassa-
 dor Goldberg confessed only the other day,
 a crisis of credibility.  People do not know
 what to believe about what they hear from
 the White House, the State Department, the
 Pentagon, and the public relations officers
 in Saigon.  The only way to restore con-
 fidence in the truthfulness of officials is by
 subjecting the exercise to a thorough public
 debate.  For such a debate the Mansfield
 report-which  ought  to  have very  much
 wider publication than it has  yet had-
 supplies the material for opening the de-
 bate.
 The main proposition which needs to be
 debated, and denied by the administration
 if it can  deny  it,  is the  finding  of the
 Mansfield report that:
 "The large-scale introduction of U.S. forces
 and their entry into combat has blunted but
 not turned back the drive of the Vietcong.
 The latter have responded to the increased
 American role with a further strengthening
 of their forces by local recruitment in the
 south and reinforcements from the north
 and a general stepping up of military ac-
 tivity.  As a result the lines remain drawn
 in South Vietnam in substantially the same
 pattern as they were at the outset of the
 increased U.S. commitment."
 After a year of escalated war, the results
 have brought the Senators to this reasser-
 tion of the classical American doctrine about
 Asian wars:
 "If present trends continue, there is no
 assurance as to what ultimate increase in
 American military commitment will be re-
 quired before  the  conflict  is  terminated.
 For the fact is that under present terms of
 reference and as the war has evolved, the
 question is not one of applying increased
 U.S. pressure to a defined military situation,
 but rather of pressing against a military sit-
 uation which is, in effect, open ended."
 This is simply another statement, in the
 concrete terms of the war in southeast Asia,
 of the doctrine which has until recently been
 American military doctrine-that the United
 States should not engage in a land war on
 the  Asian  continent because  such a  war
 will be, as the Mansfield report calls it, open
 ended.  For there will always be more Asians
 in Asia than there can be Americans.
 Our people are coming to realize that the
 war is open ended, that no matter how many
 troops we put ashore there will always be
 enough troops on the other side to keep the
 war going.
 Since this means that a negotiated peace
 cannot be the kind of dictated peace which
 Senator DuocsEN is still dreaming about, the
 President is finding  himself under  heavy
 pressure to bomb and blockade Hanoi and
 Haiphong, and thus make a quick, clean end
 of it.  On the subject of victory through air
 power, the American people have been dan-
 gerously misinformed.
 I say dangerously because the advocates
 of bigger bombing do not seem to realize
 how vulnerable are Saigon and the other
 ports to reprisals.  In the congested cities
 and harbors which we hold there are the
 makings of another Pearl Harbor, and none
 of us should discount the danger.   There
 cannot be much doubt that this is one of
 the subjects that Mr. Shelepin has been dis-
 cussing in Hanoi.
 [From the Washington Post, Jan. 6, 19661
 TODAY AND TOMORROW: THE NEXT MOVE?
 (By Walter Lippmann)
 Through the fog of war which lies so heav-
 ily upon the scene, there may be discernible
 a certain amount of movement which holds
 some promise.  There is no certainty about
 it.  But, remembering Mr. Joseph Kraft's
 well-informed observation that communica-
 tions between Hanoi and Washington are
 clogged and slow, I think that the public re-
 action of Hanoi to the President's peace cam-
 paign which is just beginning to show above
 the surface, may at least indicate what the
 President might do next.
 There are no indications that Hanoi will
 suddenly announce that it is ready for a
 peace conference.  Nor is there any indica-
 tion that Hanoi will withdraw its troops in
 the south or suspend the infiltration of more
 troops.  We must expect that the Vietcong
 strength in the south will be maintained by
 Hanoi in a ratio suitable to successful guer-
 rilla warfare.  There may be a certain reduc-
 tion In the tempo of violence, at least while
 the pause in the bombing continues.  But
 there is nothing in the public record to indi-
 cate that a peace conference or a de facto
 truce is in sight.
 What seems to be in sight is a period of
 diplomatic exchanges, carried on publicly at
 arm's length, carried on privately through
 intermediaries,  and  masked  by  bellicose
 rhetoric to appease and put off the oppo-
 nents of a negotiated truce.                                                                                                                                    The most in-
 teresting evidence here Is, on our side, the
 letter  from  Ambassador  Goldberg to the
 Secretary General of the United Nations; on
 the other side, there is the editorial which
 was published on January 3 in the North
 Vietnamese newspaper, Nhan Dan.   This can
 be taken as an official commentary on the
 Johnson peace campaign.
 The commentary is deliberately ambiguous,
 as must be expected of a government which
 has to, maneuver between Peiping, Moscow,
 and Washington.  But through the ambigu-
 ity, the commentary can be read as a chal-
 lenge to the President to prove that he does
 not mean what Hanoi thinks he means on
 two cardinal points.  The commentary chal-
 lenges him to disprove that he means to es-
 tablish "a new type colony and military base
 of the United States and perpetuating the
 partition of Vietnam."
 He is asked to prove, second, that he is
 not asking "the Vietcong-South Vietnamese
 liberation forces-to lay down their arms
 * * * and be placed under the rule of the
 Saigon regime."
 The President has done well, I believe, to
 look beyond the angry language of the past
 and to proceed with the discussion of war
 aims and peace terms, which he has been
 offering since his Baltimore speech last April.
 He can assume that what Mr. Goldberg de-
 scribed as "discussions or negotiations with-
 out any prior conditions whatsoever" have
 actually started, not yet in the form of a
 conference but at long distance and, in part
 at least, publicly.
 If that is where we are, then the time has
 come to proceed from press conferences, brief-
 ings, and informal speeches to formal dip?
 lomatic notes.  The cardinal issues, as de-
 scribed by the Hanoi commentary, are, one,
 the conditions under which we shall with-
 draw our military forces from South Viet-
 nam-and, two, the conditions, if any, under
 which the Vietcong may participate In the
 government of the country.
 Because Ambassador Goldberg leaves our
 position on these two basic issues uncertain,
 further official definition of our war aims is
 called for.
 I do not know whether the administra-
 tion can agree within itself on such a defini-
 tion of its war aims.  But I think I do know
 that such a definition of our war aims on
 the two cardinal points is now indispensable
 to the maintenance of confidence at home
 and abroad.
 Whatever the first response in Hanoi, the
 act of clarifying and defining our aims is
 a necessary part of the effort to move the
 war from the battlefield to the conference
 table. Even if we assume, as we had better
 do,  that Hanoi will  reply scornfully,  the
 nub of the matter is that it should reply
 and thus find itself in a discussion about
 the shape of things to come.

 It has often been said in Washington dur-
 Ing the past year that we are listening, with
 our antenna  well  polished,  for  some re-
 sponse from. Hanoi, and that we have never
 had any response.  This official stance, that
 it takes two to discuss anything, overlooks
 the fact that a great power like the United
 States with its worldwide connections can
 i'orco discussions by beginning the discus-
 sions and making it increasingly impossible
 for the other party to break them off.
 If the President wants seriously to have
 discussions, he has made a good beginning
 with the Goldberg letter.  If he perseveres,
 he will not go very long unanswered.  In-
 deed, judging by the first reactions of Hanoi
 L,i the current peace campaign, there are
 reasons for chinking that the public discus-
 sions have begun and the task now is to con-

 ii,DAY AND 'L0MORR0W: THE PRESIDENT
 IN THE MORASS
 (Hy Walter Lippmann)
 There Is no reason to doubt that the Presi-
 elent is sincere in proclaiming to the whole
 world his desire to negotiate a peace in Viet-
 n.asn.  But sincerity is not the crux of the
 ri_i, tier.    The question is whether he recog-
 nises the strategic realities of the military
 situation      and  is  prepared to  negotiate  a
 truce which conforms with them.  It cannot;
 he it glorious truce.
 Ti' the President is not prepared to make
 his terms of peace consistent with the reality
 in southeast Asia, he is likely to find that
 our friends and our adversaries alike regard
 the whole spectacular business not as the
 action of a statesman but as the device of e.
 showman.
 heverthelcss. for the President the peace
 oifensive is a critical turning point.  It as
 not true, as so many suppose. that, it Peiping
 ad. Hanoi reject the offer to negotiate, the
 way will there tore be cleared and open for a
 ;encral escaiai,ion of the war.  The President
 ,,vill And that. while the planes will fly and
 the troops will march and Congress will vote
 the money. confidence in his leadership, both
 at home and abroad, will be deeply weakened
 unless he has defined his terms of peace.
 As seen through the murk of Secretary
 husk's on rind oil the record press confer-
 ences, the Johnson administration has no
 lirm and clear position on the central issues
 of the war.  I realize that industrious news-
 papermen have been able to glean a copse,
 Lion of remarks which relate to the central
 1,sues-such as, whether we are prepared to
 leave South Vietnam under any conditions
 which are in fact realizable in the foresee-
 able future, and whether we are in tact will-
 ing to negotiate a truce with the main aclver-
 :;ary in the field, the Vietcong.  If these cen-
 L;-a.1 points have been clarified by Mr. Harri-
 man and tike other emissaries, a great deal
 will have been accomplished. If they have
 ..ent  been elarilied, the effort is not sufli-
 atetltly serious to comport with the dignity
 0f a great power.  For a power like the United
 ;.;tastes  cannot lose face  by liquidating a
 miserable war.  But it can lose face by fool-
 top:c.rnund with it.
 Ti'. Johnson knows that he is in a very
 ;;rave crisis.  For as he admitted in his year-
 end remarks, his great domestic accomplish-
 tn.ants  are  icopardized  by  his  failure  to
 achieve peace in Vietnam.  It is worse than
 that.  lie is on the verge of making the kind
 cat rc.unous historical mistake which the Athe-
 nians made when they attacked Syracuse,
 which Napoleon and Hitler made when they
 ;iLLaaL=ed Russia.  He is on the verge of en-
 gaging this: cr,nnt:ry in a war which can grew
 into a great war lasting for many years and
 pior_iising no rational solution.
 'l:'lie President is in this predicament mai:i-
 ly because he has let himself be persuaded
 by very had advice.  The bad advice has been
 the argument that the expansion of Chinese
 communism will be halted or quickened by
 the outcome of the fighting in South Viet-
 nam.  The notion that revolutionary wars
 can be stopped by fighting it out in South
 Vietnam has been the cherished illusion of
 the President's two principal advisers.  Both
 Mr. Husk and Mr. McNamara hav'        commit-
 ted themselves to the fallacy that South
 Vietnam is the Armageddon of the conflict
 with communism.
 This misconceived war has in 'tact boom-
 eranged.  Its effect has been quite the op-
 posite from what it was. supposed t: be.  The
 country has been told that by Arriving our
 determination and our v: illingnes ; to fight,
 we are arousing resistance to the expansion
 of Chinese communism.
 But are we?  If China is to be contained
 it will have to be done not only by  ne United
 States but by the containing pow r of Asia;
 namely. Pakistan, India, Japan, aiad the So-
 viet Union.  Yet not one of these .;rent pow-
 ers of Asia is alined with us.  Quite the con-
 trary.   Our Vietnamese :sections hive driven
 the  most  powerful  of  all  the   c:ritaining
 states. the Soviet Union., into open o, "Position
 to or. and, if we escalate enough, will drive
 it into some kind of military oppo; 1tion.
 Certainly it is essential that (oinmunist
 China be contained until its revolutionary
 ardors have cooled and slie has se, Lied down
 to peaceable coexistence.  But a s, rious pol-
 icy of containing China would be,-.in with a
 realization that China is a contirr:satal land
 power in Asia and if she is to be contained,
 it will have to be done primarily b; the great
 powers of Asia, not by the United States
 alone.
 What is more, serious policy for containing
 China would respect the basic gc:)graphical
 facts-that China is a land pow,:r and we
 are a. sea power, that China is a, elephant
 and we are a whale.  Daring the past year
 or so China has had many failur,' a and one
 conspicuous success. Geography was the de-
 termining factor in all of them.  T'ce Chinese
 failed in Africa, which is across  I lie ocean
 and too iar away.    She  outblut ed herself
 ag =.. rst I?-.dia, which is also, in feet, too far
 away.   She had a humiliating  .etback in
 Indonesia. which is separated froru China by
 blue water arid is not 'wi;hin her reach.
 China's one great success has been that
 the, greatest sea power has becu ine bogged
 down In the morass of Indochina rnd would
 now be put to it to mount a counterrevolu-
 tionary effort anywhere else in this turbu-
 lent world.  It is no wonder then  hat China
 will do all that she can to prevent us from
 extricating ourselves from the r',orass.

 WALTER  ss'PMANN ON' TEE PRESIDI NT'S HARD
 ,Li,c:[SX,N
 After ins most recent trip to ::?nth Viet-
 nam, Secretary McNamara ventured to say
 that, as a result of our effort:, we have
 stepped losing the war.  Perhaps Ise was re-
 ferring to the fact that at the bi?;ginning of
 1965 not only had the thaigonese Army lost
 control of the countryside with th, exception
 of five or six cities, but the go's r iment in
 Saigon was disintegrating and c:s on the
 verge of making a deal with Hanoi
 During the past year there his been no
 sigm.ficant improvement in the nitary sit-
 uation.  once the American sole -ors retire,
 the villages which are recovered  from the
 Vietcong are quickly lost again.  '] hie balance
 of military power has not been  'hanged in
 our favor.  For as we have increa: cd our own
 arm's, the adversary has increased, his army,
 both by stepping up the infiltration from
 the north and by greater., recruiti;_ent in the
 south.  ''tie one real change has been that
 the government in Saigon is now a dictator-
 ship of four generals who are fully aware that
 personally they have every reasc:i to avoid
 a truce and to continue the war.
 Sc, the President finds himself no nearer,
 and almost certainly further away from, his
 avowed objectives in Vietnam.  He has been
 confronted with what he now describes, quite
 correctly, as "hard decisions." What are the
 hard decisions?  At bottom, the ]President
 has to choose between a bigger war and an.
 unattractive peace.  He must decide either
 to launch a big American war in Asia, a war
 which could easily be bigger than the Korean
 war because it could so quickly involve both
 China and the Soviet Union, or to cut our
 losses by reducing his political and military
 objectives.
 EXTEND THE WAR, OR SEITTLE FOR I E.SS?
 This is indeed a hard choice.  A long war
 mean:: heavy casualties.  It means the dis-
 ruption of the lives of another generation
 of young men.  It means that the Nation will
 be distracted from the attempt to solve it:;
 own problems-such as the problems of the
 cities and the problems of the Negroes and
 the problems of industrial peace.  It mean::
 once again, :for the fourth time in this cen-
 tury, that the Nation will turn its attention.
 from its own urgent affairs to a war abroad.
 It means also that this country will be di-
 verted from the development of the Amer.
 icas and from its vital national interests in
 Europe and Australasia.
 The other choice open to the President is
 also a hard one, especially for a proud man
 who wants to be universally popular.  For
 there is no disguising the fact that a nego.?
 tiated truce can be had only by settling for
 it good deal less than a victory, and this
 means that the President must expect to be
 denounced by many, and to have his pride
 wounded.  It takes great political strength
 and a high degree of moral courage for the
 head of a state to make the kind of peace
 which may now be possible in the Vietnamese
 mess.  General  Eisenhower,  the  victorious
 commander of the Allied armies, was able to
 make a settlement in Korea which Presiden.;
 Truman would never have dared to make.
 General Eisenhower had at that time an in-
 vulnerable prestige.
 An even more pertinent analogy is to be
 found in the way General de Gaulle liqui-
 dated the messy war in Algeria.  The Presi-
 dent would do well to study and ponder
 what happened, how General de Gaulle extri-
 cated France from a war which she had not
 lost but could not win, how he negotiated
 with his adversaries in the field, the Algerian
 counterpart of the Vietcong, and made with
 them a "peace of the brave," how he out-
 witted and defied the extremists it the risk
 of his life-and how, having devoted himself
 unflinchingly to the true interest of France,
 which was peace with Algeria., he won the
 gratitude and esteem of his countrymen, in-
 eluding almost all of those who voted against
 him In the recent election.
 PAYING TIIE PRICz
 Tho hard decision the President has to
 make is whether he can accept the political
 and psychological risks of dealing with Viet-
 nam as General Eisenhower dealt with Korea
 and  is General de Gaulle dealt with north
 Africa.  For President Johnson will have to
 pay a heavy price for the historical mistaka
 of involving, the United States in a land war
 against Asians in Asia.  The alternative to
 paying a price for peace is to pay the enor-
 mous price of a great war which threatens to
 expand into a world war.
 The President has made it quite clear that
 he realizes the hard choice which is before
 him.  Naturally enough, he Is locking_  for
 some easier way out of his dilemma_  If only
 he could find one.  But by his decisions in
 1964, .he rejected the warning by men in a
 position to know that there was  lot mimes
 time left to negotiate an arrangement.  He
 has come very near to locking and boltin
 the door.  He has raised the stakes so high
 that easy solutions are most improbable and
 only the hard choices remain.

 MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT
 A message in writing from the Presi-
 dent of the United States was communi-
 cated to the House by Mr. Geisler, ope
 LETTERS FOR VIETNAM PEACE
 (Mr. BROWN of California asked and
 was given permission to address the
 House for 1 minute and to revise and ex-
 tend his remarks.)
 Mr.  BROWN  of  California.  Mr.
 Speaker, during the month of December
 1965, I received some 526 letters from all
 over the Nation urging me to join with
 the President and with Senator ROBERT
 F. KENNEDY in a strong, continuing effort
 to seek negotiations for peace in Viet-
 nam.
 Most of the letters requested an exten-
 sion of the moratorium on the bombing
 of North Vietnam until such time as
 negotiations have actually begun-and,
 then, for an end to all warfare.  Many
 of the letters I received were copies of
 those sent to the President.  Some of the
 messages were on Christmas cards-sent
 before the holidays-asking for a Christ-
 mas cease-fire.
 These messages are almost all couched
 in a language of moderation and express
 praise of the President's efforts for a
 peaceful settlement.  Many of them are
 quite long and show the results of a great
 deal of time and thoughtfulness that
 went into well-planned suggestions.
 TUESDAY, JANUARY 18, 1966
 I am impressed, Mr. Speaker, with the
 general tone of temperance and con-
 structiveness embodied in this corre-
 spondence, and I am further impressed
 with the deep concern of many of our
 citizens for human beings on the other
 side of the world in Vietnam.  I am also
 personally grateful for the continuing
 efforts being made by President Johnson
 to effect a settlement of hostilities in
 southeastern Asia.
 CREATION OF A NUCLEAR NAVY
 (Mr. MORRIS asked and was given
 permission to address the House for 1
 minute, to revise and extend his re-
 marks, and to include an address by the
 Honorable CHET HOLIFIELD and a tele-
 gram from the President.)
 Mr. MORRIS.  Mr. Speaker, on Jan-
 uary 17, it was my privilege to be pres-
 ent at the keel-laying ceremony of our
 newest attack submarine, the U.S.S.
 Narwhal. This date also marked the 11th
 anniversary of the sailing of the world's
 first nuclear submarine, the U.S.S. Nauti-
 lus.
 On this occasion, my distinguished col-
 league, CHET HOLIFIELD, chairman of the
 Joint Committee on Atomic Energy, was
 the principal speaker.  It is with a great
 deal of pleasure that I rise to place in
 the RECORD the remarks made by Con-
 gressman HOLIFIELD, and have also re-
 quested permission to place in the REC-
 ORD a telegram from President Johnson-
 a former member of the Joint Commit-
 tee-which was sent to Congressman
 HOLIFIELD praising the creation of a nu-
 clear navy as an outstanding achieve-
 ment.
 I believe our country owes a debt of
 gratitude to the Congress and particu-
 larly to the Joint Committee for the con-
 sistent support the legislative branch
 gave to the then Capt. H. G. Rickover in
 his fight to keep our Navy second to
 none.  That fight is still going on and
 I would like to associate myself with
 the remarks made by CHET HOLIFIELD
 yesterday-particularly when he said:
 I hope the day will soon come when the
 executive  branch  will  accept  the  recom-
 mendation  of  the  Joint  Committee                                                                                 on
 Atomic Energy "that the United States adopt
 a policy of using nuclear propulsion in all
 future major surface warships," thus forging
 another link in the necessary chain from
 sail to coal, from coal to oil, and from oil
 to nuclear power.  In future years, may it not
 be said of our Nation's leaders that they
 valued dollars more highly than the lives
 of our fighting men and our national se-
 curity itself.
 I commend this speech to all of us as
 an example of foresightedness and dedi-
 cation to national security.  The Con-
 gress must continue the fight for a
 nuclear-powered Navy.
 The material referred to follows:
 ADDRESS BY CONGRESSMAN CHET HOLIFIELD AT
 KEEL    LAYING   CEREMONY    FOR    U.S.S.
 "NARWIIAL," SSN671, GROTON, CONN., JAN-
 UARY 17, 1966
 Eleven -years ago today the world's first
 nuclear powered ship, the attack submarine
 U.S.S. Nautilus, SSN571, sent her   famous
 message, "Underway on nuclear power." To-
 day we are here to lay the keel of our newest
 nuclear attack submarine, the U.S.S. Narwhal,
 SSN671.  This submarine is designed to be
 technically superior In military effectiveness
 to all previous attack submarines.
 I especially want to congratulate the em-
 ployees and management of Electric Boat for
 the prominent part they have played in our
 Nation's attainment of a  position of pre-
 eminence in the nuclear submarine field.
 Here the first one-the Nautilus-was laid
 down.  The first polaris submarine was also
 built in your yard in addition to the first
 ship of a number of new classes of nuclear
 submarines which have or are joining our
 nuclear fleet.  Another major first assigned
 to Electric Boat Is. the design and construc-
 tion of the first nuclear propelled oceano-
 graphic  research  submarine,  called  NR-I,
 which we look to as the vanguard of our
 advance into inner space.  The primary mis-
 sion of the NR-i vehicle is to determine as
 quickly as possible the feasibility of nuclear
 propulsion for this application.  Because of
 the vastly Increased endurance made pos-
 sible by nuclear power,                                                                                                                                  the capability of
 NRrl will be an order of magnitude greater
 than  any other  developed or planned  to
 date.
 Including the Nautilus, Congress has au-
 thorized 99 nuclear submarines.  So you can
 see we have been proceeding with a vigorous
 development and construction program for
 nuclear-powered submarines.  But it should
 be remembered that the necessary support
 for the nuclear submarine program had to be
 won by hard effort.  The history of the early
 years of the naval nuclear propulsion pro-
 gram was marked by a reluctance within the
 Defense Department to use nuclear power
 for. the propulsion of submarines.
 Now that we have 56 nuclear submarines
 at sea;
 Now that our Polaris-armed nuclear sub-
 marines stand their watchful guard hidden
 under the oceans of the world;
 Now that our attack nuclear submarines
 provide our Navy with an indispensable anti-
 submarine warfare capability;
 Now  that  our  nuclear-powered  surface
 warships  Enterprise  and  Bainbridge have
 been committed to combat in Vietnam-few
 remember that It was the Joint Committee
 on Atomic Energy that arranged to buy the
 nuclear power"plants for our first two nuclear
 submarines, the Nautilus and Seawolf, with
 Atomic Energy Commission funds, because
 the then Capt. H. G. Rickover was not able
 to get the necessary support in the Depart-
 ment of Defense for his project in the early
 1950's.
 Let us beware that history does not repeat
 itself.
 We must be alert to assure that the reluc-
 tance of the Department of Defense to invest
 in surface warships does not let our Navy
 lapse  into  obsolescence.   We  must  build
 modern warships for our future Navy-war-
 ships with the proven advantages of nuclear
 propulsion.

 CONGRESSIONAL, RECORD - HOUSE          January 18, 1936
 Those, of you who were here on that day in
 1952 when President Harry S. Truman laid
 the keel of the Nautilus will recall his warn-
 ing, and .I. quote:
 All national security  programs are ex.
 pensive and we might as well face up to it.
 "I think  lie efforts that are being made to
 affil the American neople of the idea, that
 ihere is come cutrate, bargain-counter route
 to national security are very dangerous.  The
 people of this country lia'-e faith and cour-
 :.r;e'and isai.riotism enough to do what is re-
 quired for our national survival.  They are
 willing Lo do what is necessary even though
 I fro way may he ]ring and hard.
 'The diflf'ulty is that the American people
 :ire gett.,ag all kinds of foolish advice from
 persons who ought to know better.
 "We may have to live in a half-peace, half-
 ?r con+lrtion for no long time to come.  We
 t iur:t Lay our plans accordingly.  If we are
 Ina ma.iui in peace we must be prepared to
 etcat al?rression.   And we must be prepared
 t, make  t 1w  long-term investment in na-
 tional security that this requires.-
 F. believe in getting a  dollar's worth of
 value for every defence dollar we spend, but
 tet  its not be beguiled into believing twat
 there  is  a   new  cutrate,  bargain-counter
 route to notional secur"~._   The factor; of
 to+lftary effectiveness in the protection  of
 :air Nation's security must always be domi-
 nant over the factors of cost.                           In southeast
 Asia today the United States is once again
 laoerl  with  the  hitter  reality  that  what
 -)Lints in war is military effectiveness--not
 ro;t effectiveness.
 Cost ciiertiveness studies have been cited
 by the Defense Department to support ';he
 contention   that the advantage of nuclear
 L>'''Opulson are  not particularly significant
 for surf tole warships.   These studies, how-
 ever, contain a fundamental weakness that
 makes  their  conclusions  wrong-they  ire
 based on false assumptions and do not place
 proper emphasis on military effectiveness.
 These cost-effectiveness studies were based
 011-
 The                             ar;;u!nnt.ion  that tankers and oilers
 needed to supply propulsion fuel for oil-fired
 warships. will operate unhampered by the
 creamy and :-uffer no losses;
 Cho assumption that the fuel oil nested
 to run our conventional surface warships will
 ise readily available wherever and whenever
 needed; and
 't'he assumption that no cost factor need
 he included in their studies for losses--- or
 protection of our propulsion fuel oil supply
 lines.
 '['best,.  ire  dangerous assumptions to use
 iii evaluating the cost and effectiveness of
 weapons of war.  Most of you remember, as I
 do, when the beaches along our Atlantic coast
 were soaked with oil from sunken tankers
 and our r.hility to provide fuel for our fight-
 ing forces was seriously threatened.  What
 price would Americans be willing to pay for
 nuclear  Dowered  warships  under circurn-
 sttnces bite those?
 ilongres; has been told b'l the Department
 o1 i)cfense that the choice we face is betwean
 a criven somber of conventional ships and a
 smaller number of nuclear ships for the same
 Lnt:l cost.   In  other words. to improve a
 weapon system, we are told that we mugrt re-
 duce the number of weapons to p ? ; for it.
 We in Congress do not accept this cutrate
 bargain-counter  reasoning.   I  might;  a.dd
 that the President In his message to the Con-
 gress last Wednesday did not espouse such
 ro:asoning when he said:
 "We will give our fighting men what they
 most have: Every gun and every dollar, and
 every dec_-sion-whatever the cost or what-
 ever the challenge."
 Our potential enemies may not use the
 same  cost  effectiveness  criteria  and thus
 may oppose us with the best weapons tech-
 nology can provide them.  This could create
 an intolerable peril to our nati, ;cal security.
 Chairman L. MEN:DE_, R,rvERS,  if the House
 Aimed  Services  Committee,  r-cently said,
 and I quote:
 "I am convinced, and I think it is fair to
 ray that the Congress is a body is convinced,
 that tin: Navy of the future mitt be nuclear
 powered.  There is :no reason wise our future
 aircraft; carriers, cruisers, frig: gas, and de-
 stroyer: cannot be )towered b;  niuclear en-
 ergy.                                                                             It is clear that co itin ,ng to build
 conventionally powered warshiI ; will, in the
 long run, be econcnaic:,,lly wash) ilt; it would
 be folio'ving a policy  of built--iu obsoles-
 cence."
 I fully agree with this stab rnont of my
 distinguished. colleague from  ~aiuth Caro
 lire c.  I , is time to tale advani 'y' of one of
 the fcww areas in technology w,aere we are
 t i  oificallntly ahead of our ant ::'ollists.  We
 should proceed with n. vigorot . orcgram to
 braild   nuclear  powered warshina  that can
 give the United  States an  in sprccedented
 naval force to maintain the freedom of the
 seas and improve our ability try :survive the
 half-peace, half-war condition a.:; President
 Truman so aptly called it.
 I have been privileged to be  . member of
 the  Joint   Congressional   Committee  on
 Atomic Energy since its incepi'on 20 years
 ago and have the honor of beinrr its current
 Chairman.    The Joint Committ.: o is charged,
 by law, with the responsibility for making
 continuing studies of problem:+ relating to
 the development, use, and control of atomic
 energy.   The  Committtee  has  historically
 played a creative role in fulfil;ing the de-
 clared statutory policy of the United States
 that the development, use, and  control of
 atomic energy shall be  directed so as to
 snake  the "maximum  contsibi. lion to the
 common defense arid security "
 The Joint Committee, from its inception,
 has been interested in and vig.,rously sup-
 ported  research  and                                                                                   development  in  the
 fic?d of naval nuclear propulsion: first, for
 submarines and then for surface warships.
 Two years ago, the Joint Committee on
 Atomic Energy made an exhaustive study
 of the subject of nuclear propulsion of sur-
 face warships.   We concluded that "each
 new warship the United States decides to
 build for our first-line naval striking force
 should be the best that our technology will
 allow and  should  therefore  have  nuclear
 propulsion, even if a somewhat higher cost
 is iincurred to pay for the increase in mili-
 tary capability."
 We printed for the public record a report
 of these hearings in December 1263.  In re-
 leasing this report, Chairman J inN O. PAS-
 TORE, the distinguished Senator from Rhode
 Island, said., and I quote:
 `"I'he Joint Committee believes that cost
 cutting is important but it must eliminate
 the fat and not cut to the marrow.
 "It is my earnest hope that we will never
 again be forced to go to war, but if we do,
 I want our equipment to be second to none."
 Nuclear propulsion has the fundamental
 advantage of permitting our warships to go
 anywhere in the world, to deliver their com-
 bat load and to return-all without logistic
 support.
 Oil-fired warships must be refueled every
 few days.  This requires a vulnerable world-
 wide distribution system to provide fuel oil
 for conventional ships.
 As the number of foreign nuclear subma-
 rines                                                                                   increases  and  as  the  :air  striking
 capabilities of  our  potential enemies   in-
 crease, the difficulty of providing this logistic
 support will surely increase.  Thu basic rea-
 son for developing nuclear power for surface
 warships is to reduce this logistic support-
 support which will be most difficult, if not
 impossible  under  some  circumstances,  to
 provide in wartime.  Nuclear propulsion in
 combat ships will free the striking forces of
 our Navy from the obvious restrictions of
 reliance on a worldwide propulsion fuel dis-
 tribution system.
 We must plan for times of crisis.  It is
 precisely in such situations that the superior
 mobility, maneuverability, and reliability of
 nit -lear warships will give the United St,'tcs
 an unequaled naval striking force.
 I s  the 4 years, fiscal yer.rs 10E10 through
 1It    suhsequent  to  authorization  of  the
 tl,r-^ nuclear powered surface ships now in
 thr fleet, the aircraft carrier Eiilerprise, he
 cruiser Long Beach, and the frigate B,an-
 .ri,Igo, the Department of Defense obtained
 authorization for  2   new  aircraft  carriers
 arct 1.0 now frigates, all of which should have
 b^r-i nu bear powered. If these 12 ships had
 b:rrt provid^.d uncle rr propulsion, we wo)xld
 unw  have in being or under construct eta
 three nuclear powe.rrd carrier t ck forces for
 nor Navy in-teed of the one we have.  How-
 - ver, of these 12 ships, only one, the frigate
 Tr; er,hjn to be completed this year will have
 r1i bear power.
 A-d the Truxtun will be nuclear powered
 only because of the initiative taken by the
 Congress ii years ago to authorize and app 'o-
 o,I,Ao the extra funds to change the U.S.S.
 Trr,.-tun from an oil-fired frigate to bo our
 fourth nuclear powered surface warship.
 Sat in the past 3 years, the :Department
 of Defense has not requested authorization
 for any surface warship  of      destroyer size
 or t'rger--nuclear or conventional..   The sur
 faco Navy is aging rapidly arid is even now
 fn.e:d with wido?pread obsolescence.   1.n the
 bats'  1950's  and  early  1960's    there  was  a
 vigorous warship construction program and
 the introduction of nuclear propulsion in
 501-iece warships.  However, this has been
 followed by a long period with no surface
 war- Irin  construction    of any kind.     IL  is
 clear that this cannot go on miich ioniser
 wit:rout the capability of the U.S. Navy sink-
 ing far below the needs of our national lie-
 curity.
 It:. was Congress who took the lead in forc-
 ing the shift to nuclear power in submarines.
 It was Congress who took the lead in dev^1-
 opiug nuclear propulsion for surface war-
 ships.  It was Congress who strongly sup-
 ported  the building of the  three nuclear
 surface warships now in the fleet which. have
 so ably demonstrated to the world the ob-
 vious capabilities of nuclear propulsion in
 war ;hips.
 Congress again took the initiative last year
 by authorizing construction of the fifth nu-
 clear-powered  surface  warship-,a  guided-
 missile frigate.  This ship was added to tine
 Defense Department authorization even
 though the Secretary of Defense had over-
 ruled a Navy proposal to build it.
 The  members  of  our Committee were
 pleased to see the strong endorsements for
 building more nuclear-powered surface war-
 ships, and specifically the new nuclear fri-
 ate, given by the House and Senate Armed
 Services and Appropriations Committees. It
 is clear from the legislative history of ti-is
 particular ship that it is the will of Con-
 gress that the  long-leadtime  items needed
 for construction of the nuclear frigate he
 procured in this fiscal year and that funds
 needed for its completion be included in the
 fiscal year 1967 appropriation.
 However, to date there have been no in-
 dications that the Department of Defense in_
 tends to pay any attention whatsoever to
 this clear expression of the will of' Congress.
 This, of course, will force us to consider what
 additional steps can be taken to insure that
 the Congress is not thwarted in its efforts to
 carry out its constitutional responsibility to
 the American People: "To provide and main-
 tain a Navy."  All thinking Americans know
 that the checks and balances in our form of
 government are intended to prevent the arbi-
 trary exercise of power by anyone of the
 three branches of Government.

 Four Chaplains Memorial Sunday
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. MARGARET CHASE SMITH
 OF MAINE
 IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES
 Tuesday, January 18, 1966
 Mrs. SMITH. Mr. President, I ask
 unanimous consent that a communica-
 tion of the director of public relations of
 the department of Maine of the Amer-
 ican Legion be placed in the RECORD be-
 cause of its timely reminder of the Four
 Chaplains Memorial Sunday on Feb-
 ruary 6, 1966.
 There being no objection, the com-
 munication was ordered to be printed in
 the RECORD, as follows:
 ORRINGTON, MAINE,
 January 2, 1966.
 FOUR CHAPLAINS MEMORIAL SUNDAY
 My FELLOW AMERICANS:                 On Sunday, Feb-
 ruary  6,  1966,  the Department of Maine,
 American Legion, will lead the statewide ob-
 servance of the Four Chaplains Memorial
 Sunday. We urge all Legion and auxiliary
 groups and the churches of Maine to join
 with us in this observance.
 The heroic story of the four chaplains-
 George  L.  Fox,                    Methodist;  Alexander  D.
 Goode, Jewish;   Johnny  P.    Washington,
 Catholic;  and  Clark V.  Poling, Reformed
 Church, is a legend in our time.  Four men
 of God who gave their lives to save others
 on  the sinking  troopship USS Dorchester
 in the North Atlantic on that icy February
 morning during World War II.      The ship,
 torpedoed by the enemy, was sinking when
 the four. chaplains removed their lifejackets,
 gave them to others, and then stood together
 on the sinking ship praying for their ship-
 mates.
 We urge you to contact all churches in
 your area requesting special observance dur-
 ing the Four Chaplains Memorial Sunday.
 Contact the clubs and organizations of your
 community and give leadership to a special
 effort to promote the observance of Four
 Chaplains Memorial Sunday.
 Legion post  commanders and  chaplains
 assisted by public relations officers should
 also contact local radio and television sta-
 tions seeking to stimulate interest in this
 observance.
 All posts, county and district organiza-
 tions are requested to hold a special Four
 Chaplains  Memorial  program  during  the
 month of February.
 In a time of crisis for our Nation there
 is a message of strength in. the story of the
 four  chaplains.  There  is  the courage of
 men of God and the living memorial of the
 sacrifices of all chaplains in the service of
 our Nation.
 Maine  and  the Nation       need  to be re-
 minded of the religious heritage and the
 courage and devotion of all people of good
 faith.  We can tell this story by our observ-
 ance of Four Chaplains Memorial Sunday
 and by the retelling of the story of the four
 men of God-Americans all-serving God
 and country.
 Let Sunday, February 6, 1966, be a banner
 day in the history of the Maine American
 Legion. Let it be a day of rededication to
 the principles of "for  God and country"
 Let the message of the four chaplains be
 told by all American Legion groups in Maine.
 Many thanks,
 DANIEL E. LAMBERT,
 Director' of                     Public  Relations,  the
 American Legion.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. EDWARD A. GARMATZ
 OF MARYLAND
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, January 18, 1966
 Mr. GARMATZ.  Mr. Speaker, at the
 present time the maritime situation is
 receiving widespread attention because
 of the maritime task force report re-
 cently released, the shortage of ships to
 carry supplies to Vietnam, and the short-
 age of licensed officers to man the ships.
 The matter of subsidies for shipbuild-
 ing and ship operations is a favorite sub-
 ject for criticism.  In this connection, I
 believe several recent articles in the
 Baltimore Sun by Mrs. Helen Delich
 Bentley, the paper's very able maritime
 editor, will be extremely helpful in shed-
 ding some light on this matter and wish
 to insert them in the Appendix:
 [From the Baltimore  (Md.)  Sun, Nov.  1,
 1965]
 WATERFRONT SIDELIGHTS
 (By Helen Delich Bentley, maritime editor of
 the Sun)
 NEW YORK, October 31.-A fellow maritime
 newspaper editor the other day asked wheth-
 er we had read "This Is Marad," a booklet
 published earlier this year by the Maritime
 Administration regarding its operations.
 We replied affirmatively and thought noth-
 ing more about it.  But our colleague pur-
 sued the matter with the comment, "Boy,
 you'd never think that the same person who
 put that out would put out the task force
 report or make all of the speeches he is
 making now."
 His reference was to Nicholas Johnson, the
 Maritime Administrator, whose photograph
 appears on the page containing the foreword
 to "This Is Marad."
 TASK FORCE REPORT
 The 31-year-old Administrator also is often
 referred to as the one whose thinking pro-
 duced most of the recently issued contro-
 versial recommendations of the interagency
 maritime task force as to how the American
 merchant marine should be reconstructed
 and operated in the future.'
 The last two paragraphs of the foreword
 read:
 "In good times and in bad, in peace and in
 war, the United States needs merchant ships
 to carry its trade, to contribute to its econ-
 omy, to protect its worldwide interests.  It is
 our job at the Maritime Administration to
 sec that the American people have that kind
 of merchant marine; but this responsibility
 can be adequately discharged only if the
 American people understand the role of the
 merchant marine in our national life.
 "I hope this booklet will help to promote
 such understanding."
 "FOR WAR AND PEACE"
 Under this title "For War and Peace," it
 states:
 "],Merchant ships perform a dual service.
 In peacetime they carry on the trade be-
 tween nations;  in war or national emer-
 gencies they serve either as an integral part
 or as an adjunct to the Armed Forces, carry-
 ing military goods and personnel or mate-
 rials  essential to  war  production  or  to
 sustain the civilian population.
 "In peacetime American merchant ships
 must compete in the open market against
 foreign shipping for the world's trade; in
 wartime they usually work directly for the
 Government.  To this dual role can be at-
 tributed the concern of the Nation for the
 adequacy of the merchant fleet."
 "DEMONSTRATED MANY TIMES"
 Under the heading of national security,
 the booklet says:
 "Since the founding of our Nation, the
 importance of a strong American merchant
 marine  has  been  forcibly  demonstrated
 many  times. * * * As  in  the  preceding
 centuries, the last 65 years have brought
 many occasions when the security of the
 Nation was dependent in large measure on
 the availability of a strong and active U.S.
 merchant marine."
 It cites instances from World War I and
 World War II when this country had to
 provide the  free world with most  of  its
 merchant ships, from Korea, the Suez Canal,
 and Lebanon.
 "IN EVENT OF  LIMITED WAR"
 And then it adds, "Although war strategy
 plans have changed with the introduction
 of new weapons, present Department of De-
 fense plans still call for the use of substan-
 tial numbers of merchant ships for purely
 military purposes in the event of a limited
 war."
 The last paragraph under that heading
 states:
 "There are separate but related needs for
 sustaining America's  defense  and  civilian
 economies in time of war.  The existence of
 a substantial, fast modern merchant fleet
 under the American flag is an essential ele-
 ment in any plan to meet these vital needs.
 "To deter aggression in threatened areas
 throughout the world, we have positioned
 men and equipment in many lands.  In 1963,
 1,340,000 tons of cargo to supply these forces
 were  carried  by  the U.S.-subsidized  lines
 alone."
 Under the heading "Economic Strength,"
 "This is Marad" says:
 "Less dramatic but fully important today
 is the contribution which a U.S. merchant
 fleet makes to the economic welfare of the
 country by assuring uninterrupted move-
 ment of the agricultural, manufactured and
 raw  materials  in  the  foreign  commerce
 which is necessary to the continued and
 ever-increasing prosperity of the country.

 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD - -APPENDIX       January 18; o~V)G
 "LARGEST TRADING NATION
 "The United States is the world's largest
 trading Nation, accounting for 15 percent of
 all world trade.  About 99 percent of th:s
 trade move:; by sea.
 "We depend upon a large variety of im1-?
 ported foods. raw materials and other prod--
 ucts to maintain our high standard of living,
 and to supply necessary elements of many
 of the manufactured exports which we in
 turn ship to other nations.
 "As  American  oceanborne  foreign com--
 merce increases during the next 20 years
 from its present level of about $30 billion to
 a projected level of nearly $60 billion, it is
 essential that we maintain ellective control
 over the rates and services of the shipping
 lines which will carry our trade.
 : ,OMESTT-C BENEFITS
 "1'ina.lly,  there  are substantial domestic
 economic benefits from the merchant marine.
 The maritime industry, including the mer-
 chant portion of the shipbuilding industry,
 generates snout $L5 billion in gross national
 product and pays about $75 million in Fed-
 oral and loyal taxes.  In addition, the 100,000
 maritime employees pay about $80 million
 in personal income taxes.
 "The  provision of shipping  services by
 U.S.-flag ships conserves about $800 million
 of our dollar exchange each year, thus aiding
 our balance-of-payments position.
 "It has been demonstrated that we can-
 not depend upon other countries to supply
 at all times the ships needed for the defense
 and trade of the United States.
 :111.8 AND SHIPBUILDING
 "We  must,  therefore,  maintain  enough
 ships, shipbuilding  capacity, experienced
 shipping companies,  and skilled workmen
 and seamen of our own to provide a U.S.
 merchant marine adequate to the demands
 of both wax acid peace."
 The above quotations-all from a booklet
 published earlier this year by the Maritime
 Administration-reflect the thinking of most
 people about the American merchant marine.
 As we noted earlier, these were made over
 the signature of the Administrator.
 The reason the President's Maritime Ad-
 visory Committee took such a strong stand
 against the task force report was its appar-
 ent initial. aim-of providing  a merchant
 marine only adequate to take care al  one
 initial emergency needs of this Nation.
 Tire justilication given in the task force
 report is that that proposal will give the N:I-
 Lion more ships than if the fleet continues
 on its present course.
 Neither of these two courses is the answer
 to the problem.  The answer should be :a
 merchant marine strong and large enough to
 take care (31 this country's military and coni-
 mercial needs.
 The situation right now is strong evidence
 that, despite the large numbers of ships In
 the reserve fleet, there is question whether
 the merchant fleet is adequate to do both
 even though Uncle Sam is involved in only
 a "brush fire" in southeast Asia.
 M:;TS  DECLARES  NEED
 The Military Sea Transportation Service
 let it be known last week that more ships
 are needed on this run and has called all the
 shipowners in for a conference Tuesday.
 ts;ven before this, MSTS has had to use
 foreign-flag ships to supplement the Aineri-
 ca.n vessels to Vietnam.  According to an af-
 fidavit submitted by Vice Adm. Glynn R.
 1),;naho, MS'I'S commander, 14 foreign ships
 were chartered between June 10 and Septem-
 ber8.
 Hince that time, at least two foreign ships
 have been chartered--with Maritime Admin-
 istration approval-to supplement the com-
 mercial operations of subsidized steamship
 lines on essential trade routes because they
 had so many bottoms serving Vietnam.
 MORE  CHARTERS  LIKELY
 And there have been indications that more
 foreign vessels may be chartered for this pur-
 pose--provided foreign ones can be obtained
 in view of the worldwide demand for mov-
 ing military supplies to southeast Asia, mov-
 ing  Canadian  wheat  to  Russia  and  Red
 China, as well as moving the regilar every-
 day cargoes.
 Certainly this would indicate that the U.S.
 active fleet at this time is not adequate to
 sustain America's defense and civilian econ-
 omies in time of peace, let alone war-the
 administration keeps emphasizing the Viet-
 nam situation is not a war, bu;, a brush
 fire and everything is being hat lied on a
 business-as-usual basis.
 CONDITION  OF  RESERVE  FL ET
 bere appears to be  onsideral:);e specu-
 lation about the condition of tie reserve
 fleet, whetner the remaning yes: cis are in
 condition to be broken out or w:;ether the
 costs will justify breaking them nut.
 An independent ship surveyor  who has
 visited most of the reserve fleets notes that
 the Liberty ships which are behg sold for
 scrap are in better condition than many of
 the Victory type being reactivate:;.
 He explained that the Liberty is a simple
 ship and there is not too much  electrical
 and electronic  work aboard  "t1. go  bad,"
 which means a minimum expense for reacti-
 vation,  This is not true of the Victories and
 C-2's.
 WAR MIGHT ABSORB COST
 Tf ships are as sorely needed  as MSTS
 would indicate, it seems the cost of breaking
 them out would be meaningless, would just
 be one of the items absorbed in the expendi-
 ture of the "brush fire" in Vietnam.
 Despite all  the pronouncements out of
 Washington that war strategy plans have
 changed, only last week the Na?: y Depart-
 ment said. 98 percent of the supp iLs moving
 to Vietnam are going by sea.
 This in itself should make seine of the
 detractors  of  the  merchant  m .rive  take
 notice.
 BOOKLET AND REPORT
 How can one justify the book et's words
 under the heading of "Economic Strength"
 and then turn around and say we can de-
 pend  on  foreign  ships  for  these  cargoes
 cited?
 That section emphasizes that merchant
 shipbuilding along with the rest of the mar-
 itime industry generates about tt1.5 billion
 in the gross national product, and yet the
 task force is calling for shipbuilding in for-
 eign yards hereafter.
 The booklet also states that i he Federal
 Government receives at least $130 million in
 taxes from the maritime industry and that
 American-flag ships conserve abou L $800 mil-
 lion of this country's dollar exchange, thus
 contributing to the balance of payments.
 FIGURES SEEM STILL VALe)
 f)o these figures no longer meal:: anything?
 is it no longer important to this country
 to be able to control rates?
 -'This  is  Marad"  states  that  the  high
 standard of living in the United States-
 "of which we are most proud"-makes it dif-
 iicult to provide and maintain a merchant
 heat competing in international trade with
 other nations---and, therefore, C:avernment
 assistance has been made available to offset
 these cost differentials.
 NOW CRITICAL OF HIGHER COSTS
 And yet the tone of the maritime admin-
 istrator hi recent statements has been criti-
 cal of the higher costs in the United States
 and anxious for the United States to have
 "truly competitive shipbuilding and ship-
 ping industries."
 Maybe the independent unnamed econo-
 mists who have persuaded Johnson that it
 would be better to build in foreign yards
 and lean toward foreign countries for this
 form of transportation could explain it alt
 better.
 My colleague and I are still confused.

 AROUND   THE   WATERFRONT:   JOHNSON   NOW
 ELABORATE IN TASK  FORCE ADVOCACY
 (By Helen Delich Bentley, maritime editor
 of the Sun)
 SAN        FRANCISCO,  December  12. --Nicholas
 Johnson, Maritime Administrator, has been
 arguing for the position of the controversial
 task force report.
 Johnson was one of four high Government
 officials who addressed the Maritime Trades
 Department of the AFL--CIO during its 3-day
 biennial convention here.
 In terms of rank, the four could be listed
 as follows:
 John  H.  Henning,  Under  Secretary  o,
 Labor.
 -
 Alan S. Boyd, Under Secretary of Coin
 merce for Transportation.
 George H. Hearn, one of five Commissioners
 on the Federal Maritime Commission.
 Nicholas Johnson, Maritime Administra-
 tor.
 OTHERS UNACCOMPANIED
 Henning made this trip unaccompanied by
 any member of his staff and held no press
 conference.
 Boyd likewise traveled without any aids
 and held no press conference although he
 had a frank and open discussion with th s
 press after his speech.   Although Boyd is
 chairman of the task force, he pulled: rio
 behind-the-scenes punches.
 Hearn also traveled alone without any aids
 and held no press conference.
 Nicholas Johnson had two men make the
 trip from Washington with him. although
 be has been loudly stressing Government
 economy.
 TWO JOHNSON AIDS
 One of those with Johnson, although not
 on the same plane, was Ivan Scott, who is
 being characterized as the "personal public
 relations" man for Johnson.
 Soott was employed as of December 1 and
 his first assignment was that of traveling t)
 the west coast to set up press conferences
 in each of the four areas visited by the Mari-
 time Administrator.  There already is a press
 information. center in the Maritime Admiu-
 istrat.ion.
 The other was George R. Griffiths, some-
 times described as the Maritime Administra-
 tion's liaison man with  the  military  Sea
 Transportation Service and other times as a
 special assistant to Johnson, of which there
 are increasing numbers.
 PRESS CONFERENCE OBJECTIONS
 At the press conference in San Francisco---
 the first of the four and the only one at-
 tended by this reporter-it was difficult to
 obtain direct answers from Johnson about
 the task force recommendations as differing
 from those of the President's Maritime Ad-
 visory Committee.
 Johnson also had several members Irons
 the local staff of the Maritime .Administration
 accompanying him a good part of the time he
 was in San Francisco, Portland, Seattle, and
 Los Angeles.
 This array undoubtedly was impressive to
 some persons.
 SOME DISSENTING  OWNERS
 For example, when he tried to impress upoaa
 the press that the Advisory Committee rec-
 ommendations were not accepted by three
 committee members, he failed to add, unto
 questioned, that two of the objectors were
 major foreign-flag shipowners.
 Johnson failed to say that the third, a
 banker, had. at first, refused to join the com-

 Hall said, "but never before one stood up
 and said publicly what they are going to do
 to us."
 Hall also in public accused Johnson of
 "deliberate misuse of statistics" and of jug-
 gling figures "to justify this lie" of how much
 the subsidy to individual seamen is in com-
 parison with that to farmers.
 Hall explained that when the Maritime
 Administration calculated  how  much  the
 operating  subsidy  payments  to   seamen
 amounted to, it divided only the number of
 men actually going to sea aboard the subsi-
 dized ships into the amount of the subsidy
 rather than taking into consideration the
 persons backing up that operation on shore,
 such as the office staffs and shipyard workers.
 MORE RECKONED FARMERS
 On the other hand, to lessen the agricul-
 ture amount, the Seafarers' official said, the
 Maritime        Administration  adds  up  every
 family member on any         10-acre plot that
 produced $50 worth In a year, plus 1.5 million
 retired farmers, several million farmers who
 receive no subsidy, to those` who are sub-
 sidized and actually earn their pay at farm-
 ing.
 Thus, the farm figure comes out to about
 $1,100 per person, while the seaman subsidy
 quoted by Johnson is $7,500 to $12,000 a man.
 If the shipping industry was given the
 same broad general description as that of
 agriculture,  Hall  asserted  the  figures per
 person would be identical because shipping
 would then be $1,190 per person.
 "SMALL-MINDED PEOPLE"
 "These small-minded people are killing off
 this industry," Hall declared.
 The description of a sneaking stumping
 tour applied to Johnson's trip did not come
 MANAGEMENT'S CHANCE TO ADD
 Now it will  be interesting to see what
 management does to match this performance
 or to uphold its "share" of putting the mari-
 time industry across to the general public.
 Never has the American shipping industry
 had the opportunity it now has nor is it
 likely to have it again if it flubs this time as
 it has done many times in the past.
 The stage was set by Nicholas Johnson, the
 youthful Maritime Administrator, in a speech
 last February 9 when he first said publicly
 that, as far as he was concerned, part of the
 industry was to be scuttled and the rest of
 it was to be revamped.
 A climax was reached October 7 when the
 contents of the Interagency maritime task
 force report were formally made public and
 found to be quite similar to the February 9
 Curtain raiser.
 Meanwhile, fortunately, functioning in an-
 other theater was a three-part cast-com-
 posed  of  public,  labor  and  management
 members-known as the President's Mari-
 time Advisory Committee with the assign-
 ment of developing a long-range program
 to improve the U.S. merchant marine.
 They did not like the contents of the task
 force presentation and drew up their own.
 -        CONTRASTS SEE SAME GOAL
 Each program now is being performed with
 a different view in mind, because the basic
 lines  are  so  different-such  as  building
 abroad,                    eliminating  cargo  preference and
 American-flag passenger ships.
 more critical and ships playing a large role
 there, shipping once again has the value of
 its contribution to defense being portrayed
 daily before the Nation.
 Thus the stage has been set so that the in-
 dustry has an opportunity such as it has not
 had for three decades.
 With knowledge of all this background,
 it was startling to hear that the west coast
 president of a subsidized steamship company
 remarked here Friday that, since his com-
 pany's ships were sailing chock-a-block full,
 he could not see any reason why his com-
 pany should contribute money toward any
 type of an advertising or promotion cam-
 paign now.
 It was particularly disheartening because
 there had been a bit of a reason to believe
 this man's eyes had been opened earlier in
 the week to the fact that the industry's con-
 tinued negligence of promotion, of better-un-
 derstanding, has contributed to its rather
 squeegy position today.
 Such narrow points of view are exactly
 what has been wrong with the American
 maritime industry for scores of years and ap-
 parently Is going to remain If his attitude
 Is an indication.
 When business has been at a peak, the
 American shipping industry has shrugged its
 shoulders and said it was pointless to put
 on a program of any kind because there was
 no need for it-business was good.
 MONEY LAGS WITH BUSINESS
 When business has slacked off and rides
 along at a low ebb with bludgeoning from
 every side, the industry declares it does not
 have the money then to do anything to offset
 It.
 The shipowners' and shipyards' inconsist-
 ency has helped box them into their present
 undesirable  position  and  sometimes  it  is
 difficult to sympathize with them.
 However,  both claim to have the same                 it would not be surprising if other top

 And while they are thinking along these
 lines, both management and labor should
 knock their heads together and be willing
 to improve labor relations in the industry
 so that part of the way the public thinks of
 them will recover.

 U.S. SUBSIDY PLANS COVER MANY AREAS-MER-
 CHANT MARINE NOT ALONE IN FEDERAL Ass-
 ;;I.:;TANCE
 (By Helen Delich Bentley. maritime editor
 of the Sun)
 bAN  FRANCISCO,  Dec.  23-The  merchant
 marine has been singled out for tremendous
 criticism about its subsidy in recent years,
 while the only other Government-assisted
 program referred to constantly is the farm
 subsidy.
 However, a recently published report pre-
 pared for the Joint Economic Committee of
 Congress reveals nine pages of listings of
 various grants made annually by Uncle Sam
 to all elements of the Nation's business and
 economic life.
 The introduction to chapter II, entitled
 "Scope of Studies,' begins" "A better under.,
 standing and appreciation of the sweeping,
 amorphous  character of subsidy programs
 may be gained by a mere listing of the vari-,
 ous  Federal  programs,  past  and  present..
 which, by one criterion or another, might be
 considered to partake of or involve an ele-
 ment of subsidy regardless of original intent
 of any particular program."
 .ISTED AS GRANTS
 Under the beading of "Grants to business
 firms and corporations to carry out specific
 objectives," it lists the following:
 Shipbuilding  differential  subsidy-Mari-
 time Administration;  shipbuilding subsidy
 for   fishing  vessels--Interior Department;
 ship-operating differential subsidy; subsidies
 to wartime producers of various raw mate-
 rials and consumer items to stimulate pro-
 duction without violating price ceilings; land
 grants and cash contributions for railroad
 construction;  Government subscriptions to
 railroad  securities;  subsidies  for  carrying
 mail--ship and civil air carriers; partial 5-
 nancing of plants to generate electricity from
 atomic fuels.
 In the chapter on transportation subsidies,
 it, discusses the assistance that has been given
 to the airliner, since 1925 and noted that
 today the subsidy payouts in air transporta-
 tion are devoted to the 14 local service car-
 riers  and  carriers  in Alaska and Hawaii.
 These amount to about $85 million a, year.
 "Aside  from  these  direct  subsidies,  all,
 carriers have also benefited from such varied
 governmental assistance as airport and air-.
 way facilities, other navigation aids, aero-?
 nautical  research  and  development     con-
 ducted                           under  governmental   auspices,    the
 safety regulations of the Civil Aeronautics
 Administration and the sale of surplus air-
 craft, available to both new and existing
 companies engaged in civil transport," the
 report said.
 WIDELY DEBATED
 On the matter of motor carriers, it noted
 that whether the extensive expenditures on
 highway and street improvement constituted
 a direct subsidy to the motor carrier indus-
 try has been widely debated.
 Representatives of the motor carrier indus-
 try have contended that through registra-
 tion. fees, gasoline taxes, and other charges
 which have gone into the construction of
 public roads, the industry has met all the
 costs properly attributable to it.   This is
 denied by railroad spokesmen."
 And in regard to railroads, the report con-
 tended that the total and net subsidies to
 railroads by Federal and State government
 are subject to some uncertainty.

 AROUND THE WATERFRONT: CONGR]:Ss HAS ITS
 CHANCE FOR MAJOR MARITIME CURES
 (By Helen Delich Bentley, maritme editor
 of the Sun)
 WASHINGTON, January 9.-Toda;'s opening
 of the 2d session of the 89th Congress brings
 with it a call for some major changes in the
 Nation's maritime legislation-changes de-
 pending, of course, on whether the adminis-
 tration pursues the course promia,d by some
 of its lesserlings.
 Whether much is done remains uncertain
 despite the two divergent reports on the
 American   merchant  marine  1 hat   have
 aroused everyone in and around the mari-
 time industry since last September.
 This is the first time in recent maritime
 history-the last 30 years-that there has
 been so much turmoil over the industry in
 the months preceding the opening of Con-
 gress.  It appears the path has been opened
 for major action.
 In addition to dependence upon the ad-
 ministration's bidding, there will be the de-
 sires of Congress itself-whether the com-
 mittees responsible for the merchant marine
 are prepared or are willing to take steps on
 their own.
 The House Merchant Marine an u Fisheries
 Committee will be headed by a new chair-
 man--EDWARD A. GARMATZ, a Mary; and Dem-
 ocrat.   Senator  MA.GNUSON,  Democrat,  of
 Washington, a former seaman, will continue
 as chairman of the Senate Commerce Com-
 Dlittee.
 This could be the first time in the last few
 years that these two committees work to-
 gether, inasmuch as MAGNUSON anal the late
 Representative Bonner, Democrat- of North
 Carolina, whorl GARMATZ succeed, did not
 get along well together.  Joining o; hands in
 this direction could be fruitful for lie indus-
 try and the program as a whole.
 GARMATZ walks in as chairman :at a time
 which affords him the opportunity, is a whole
 to do more for the industry than ::ny chair-
 man has had since the 1936 act was passed.
 He can also do his own constitu ents con-
 siderable good since they are so closely linked
 to the American maritime welfare-provided
 overall welfare is properly handled and GAR-
 MATZ has loyal persons working on it.
 Since the 1936 act was passed, most of the
 legislation has been geared toward the sub-
 sidized end of the industry, which today is
 the best part of the American merchant ma-
 rine.  The tramps and inriependencs did get
 the Cargo Preference Act, the trade-in-and-
 build program, and mortgage insurance when
 the Republicans were in power.
 It is the tramp or bulk-carrier segment of
 the merchant marine that has been cited by
 both reports  as requiring improvement at
 once.   Although legislation  was passed in
 1952 enabling bulk carriers to be built with
 subsidy assistance, the Maritime administra-
 tion has not approved any of the applications
 filed in recent years for the construction of
 such sorely needed vessels,
 Perhaps new legislation is not the complete
 answer.  Perhaps a thorough investigation
 as to why the administration has not paid
 any heed to congressional wishes concerning
 the merchant fleet might be more in order.
 The House Merchant Marine Committee
 has  never  been  considered  a particularly
 strong or important committee----primarily
 because the industry has never made itself
 recognized properly as a truly important in-
 dustry to the United States.
 Certainly over the years the industry has
 shied  away  from  making  the  committee
 members feel as if they actually had done a
 job and had more to do.
 Contributions to political campaigns from
 the shipping industry have always been con-
 sidered in the "niggardly" class in congres-
 sional circles.
 And now it has all come home---and the
 industry recognizes that, with the attitude
 of many administration officials, its future
 is dependent upon Congress.
 Regardless of any of the past or any per-
 sonal feelings, the congressional committees
 have a responsibility to the people of the
 United States to provide them with a strong
 American-flag  merchant  marine  and   a
 healthy maritime complex built around that
 fleet.
 It is on that premise they should act.
 CHANCE FOR HOUSE GROUP
 The House Merchant Marine Committee
 can become a very important one on Capitol
 Hill this year if the overall picture is prop-
 erly encompassed and presented.
 As the second session opens, there is not
 only the question of a new policy for the
 American merchant marine, with two diver-
 gent reports serving as background, but there
 also is the fact that this country has found
 itself in rather a peculiar position in try-
 ing to supply- ships to handle its own cargoes;
 to Vietnam--although the reserve fleets are,
 monumental in size.
 And then there is the matter of the U.S.S.
 Yarmouth Castle, the Panama-flag passenger
 ship operating out of Miami on a regular
 run to Nassau, which burned with 90 per-
 sons--mostly Americans-losing their lives.
 GOVERNMENT-AID CARGOES
 Still undecided is whether U.S.-flag ships
 are receiving: their share of Government-aid
 cargoes and, if not, why not.
 All of these and more are matters that
 should be taken up by the congressional
 committees  primarily  responsible  for  the
 American merchant marine this year-first
 determining the adequacy of that fleet and
 how an adequate fleet can be maintained for
 this country so that when Vietnams break
 out there is no problem as to availability of
 merchant ships for both military and com-
 mercial use.
 The committees might consider some way
 of finding out what is going on within the
 Maritime  Administration.   This  might  be
 something to consider as a permanent part
 of the committee staff work.
 MAY NEED MORE STAFF
 With the Yarmouth  Castle disaster,     the
 task force-Maritime Advisory Committee re-
 ports, and Vietnam, the House committee
 naturally must expand its staff to be able
 properly to handle all these matters.
 Representative GARMATZ months ago asked
 for an accounting of the ships in the reserve
 fleet.  As far as is known, he has never been
 given that information.  If the information
 was kept on record as it should be and should
 have been, the new chairman could have had
 the proper answer to his request within a
 matter of days.

 Yes, there is plenty to be done this year-
 and the merchant marine and maritime in-
 dustry is looking to Congress to lead the way.
 [From the Baltimore Sun, Jan. 12, 1986]
 MERCHANT  MARINE  OF UNITED  STATES
 THREATENED WITH OBLIVION
 (By Helen Delich Bentley, maritime editor
 of the Sun)
 WASHINGTON, January 11.-Commerce De-
 partment officials, it was learned today, have
 threatened subsidized shipowners that If they
 did not accept the interagency maritime task
 force report on a drastic new shipping policy,
 the  American  merchant marine  "will be
 budgeted into oblivion."
 This intimidation was made last month
 after Alan S. Boyd, Under Secretary of Com-
 merce  for             Transportation  and  task  force
 chairman, in San Francisco called for a "com-
 promise" on the two contradictory reports-
 that of the task force and the  other of
 the President's Maritime Advisory Commit-
 tee-on how the American-flag fleet should
 be rescued.
 NEITHER SIDE GETTING ANYWHERE
 Although Boyd was not present when the
 threat was made, two officials from his De-
 partment who presumably had authority to
 speak conducted the conference.  The gen-
 eral tone of the session was that the ship
 operators should go through the task force
 report, find what "you can swallow," and
 the rest "would be forced upon the industry."
 At the time of his call for a compromise,
 Boyd said before the maritime trades de-
 partment of the AFL-CIO that neither side
 was getting anywhere holding fast to its
 views, that the United States had become
 great because throughout history there had
 been compromises, and he felt it was im-
 portant  for  the  future  of  the  American
 merchant  marine that a  compromise be
 reached on the two policy reports.
 It was when industry officials went to
 the Commerce Department to find out what
 was meant by the call to compromise that
 the warning was given to them.
 The Commerce Department holds the key
 to the budget of, the subsidized segment of
 the American merchant marine now because
 the Maritime Administration is an agency
 of that Department.
 Therefore, whatever budget is sought by
 the Maritime Administration must then be
 fitted into the overall budget of the Com-
 merce Department before it goes on to the
 Bureau of the Budget.
 INDEPENDENT AGENCY SOUGHT
 It is because of this hold of the Commerce
 Department over the merchant marine that
 several bills were introduced in the 1st ses-
 sion of the 89th Congress to have the Mari-
 time Administration made an independent
 agency.  Those bills are expected to be acted
 upon this session.
 The Budget Bureau had representation on
 the task force, as did several other Govern-
 ment departments not considered friendly to
 the American merchant marine.  Among the
 controversial recommendations in that report
 are the building of American ships abroad;
 phasing out of all American ships from the
 passenger business;  revamping the entire
 system of subsidy payments; building new
 bulk carriers, but only five a year; and hold-
 ing down the amount of foreign commerce to
 be transported on American-flag ships to less
 than the present 9 percent.
 It also would have this country depend on
 foreign-flag ships for commercial purposes
 should all of the U.S.-flag vessels be used
 for military transportation.
 ELEVEN SHIPS RECOMMENDED
 Whether the reported cutback in new ship-
 building to be presented to Congress in the
 new budget is part of that threat cannot
 be determined yet.
 According to information available, the
 Budget Bureau is recommending that only 11
 new ships be built in fiscal 1967.  This is
 the lowest number since the replacement
 program got fully underway in fiscal 1958.
 It is said to be 4 less than what the
 Commerce Department called for and about
 10 or so less than what the Maritime Admin-
 istration called for.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 of
 HON. J. ARTHUR YOUNGER
 OF CALIFORNIA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, January 18, 1966
 Mr. YOUNGER.             Mr. Speaker, in the
 Sunday edition of the Washington Star
 of January 16, an article appeared which
 I am sure will be of interest to the read-
 ers of the CONGRESSIONAL RECORD.  Mary
 McGrory's column "Yellow Rose Calls
 White House" is an excellent piece of
 satire on the White House order to report
 the comings and goings and phone calls
 of White House employees. Her column
 follows :
 YELLOW  ROSE  CALLS  WHITE HOUSE
 (By Mary McGrory)
 Mr. MARVIN WATSON,
 Special Assistant to the President,
 The White House.
 DEAR MR. WATSON:  You know, of course,
 that  Press Secretary Bill  Moyers  has  ex-
 plained and defended your practice of keep-
 ing a record of incoming telephone calls at
 the White House on the grounds of "effi-
 ciency, economy, and security."
 Naturally all of us are for that, but as a
 patriotic American citizen I think I should
 tell you that you are barking up the wrong
 tree.
 Take my own case.  I show up on your lists
 as often as 20 times a day.  But that's only
 half the story.  What you need is the outgo-
 ing list.  You'll never see me there.
 No matter when I call or whom I call, he's
 "at a meeting" or "with the President"' or
 "has some people with him."  He's not spill-
 ing any state secrets to me, I can assure you.
 Maybe we should all take the hint that the
 President will tell us reporters anything he
 thinks we ought to know, which you have
 to admit is not much.  But we hear that a
 man's worth is gaged by the number of calls
 he gets, and he could lose his third telephone
 or even his job if he isn't in demand.
 So we keep dialing, and I personally have
 had many pleasant conversations with the
 secretaries over there.  I have learned that
 one of them is looking for an apartment on
 Connecticut Avenue and another is having
 trouble with her mother-in-law.   I don't
 think these constitute breaches of the na-
 tional security, and I hope you will agree.
 Incidentally, would you consider giving us
 reporters code names or numbers?  I have
 to spell my last name every time I call and it
 eats into my efficiency and also my morale.
 Could I be "Yellow Rose" or maybe 007?  Or
 are you saving that for Walter Lippmann?
 I want you to know that I have never
 descended to giving a fictitious name.  A col-
 league of mine, whom I shall not name, on
 his sixth try for McGeorge Bundy, said he
 was Alexel Kosygin, and had to spell it.
 Next week  he plans to  be "Alexander
 Kerensky," and the week after "Leon Trot-
 sky."                                                                 I think I have talked him out of using
 "Ho Chi Minh" on the grounds that it will
 start up a new flurry about "direct contact
 A169.
 .between  Hanoi  and  Washington," which,
 could cause a jamming of the White House
 switchboard.  I have pointed out to him
 that you people have enough to do checking
 up on each other, and he has promised to
 think it over.
 But to get back to my point of the incom-
 ing list not giving the big picture.  A week
 ago Tuesday, for instance, I show up as call-
 ing Joe Califano 10 times between 11 a.m.
 and 7 p.m. I forget what I wanted to ask
 him, but the thing is he should not be
 credited-nor should I be charged-with the
 last two.  I was merely trying to tell the
 secretary that my deadline had passed and
 that he should not bother to call back.  The
 first time, all his lines were busy, and the
 second time, I got through.
 The secretary promised to take my name
 off the list and she was as good as her word.
 I have not heard from him to this day.
 Also you should not be misled by those
 six calls I put in to Bill Moyers on Thursday.
 He does not spend his day on the horn chin-
 ning With me.  Actually, when I finally got
 him and asked him about the future of a
 prominent government official, he advised me
 not to write anything because the President
 will make a statement about it in a few days.
 I'm still waiting.
 Knowing Washington, you are naturally
 concerned that some people might just be
 calling up their White House acquaintance
 to scrounge some juicy morsel to drop into
 the conversation over a Georgetown dinner
 party.  Some of us, Mr. Watson, never get
 to Georgetown dinner parties.  We are sit-
 ting in our offices waiting for the White
 House to call back.
 A friend of mine went out recently and
 sat next to a White House aid who sees the
 President all day.  His conversation was con-
 fined to the adorable thing his 2 year old
 had said that morning.  His wife, during the
 ladies' hour, confided that she was going to
 name her next child Little Boy.
 So, Mr. Watson, I can tell you there's no
 need to worry. ? Indiscretion has been prac-
 tlcally wiped out in the executive branch.
 And your log of incoming calls would be out
 right down to a splinter if you could persuade
 your boss to hold regular press conferences.
 Sincerely yours,
 .As the Twig Is Bent-Safeguarding the
 Spiritual-Moral Well-being of Young
 Americans in Uniform

 There being no objection, the article

 as follows:
 As THE TWIG IS BENT
 (By Harry C. Archer, colonel, U.S. Army)
 Strange names Once ag.hin are spreading
 across American headlines and creeping into
 the American vocabulary:  Da Nang, Viet-
 cong, and the Ho Chi Mirilh Trail.  They are
 familiar because tens of thousands of our
 soldiers, airmen, and marines are pouring
 into beleagured Vietnam.  The buildup of
 combat forces there has brought increased
 draft: call and may lead to the mobilization
 of Reserve and National Guard unit;.
 'the demands of national security made
 upon the young men of our Nation are of
 obvious  and  direct  concern  to  parents,
 clergymen, civic leaders-indeed to all Amer-
 icans.
 The first though, of course, is for the physi-
 cal safety and well-being of these lads.                          No
 less important is the concern over the effects
 of military service upon their moral fiber.
 Will they be coarsened and corrupted?    Or
 will they emerge as self-reliant, better citi-
 zens?
 Asa soldier, a Regular Army officer, I have
 nay own views.  To illustrate, lot me present
 an imagined but not unbelievable case:
 The young  soldier  was not particularly
 drunk when he left the cafe.  Just happy.
 fie  had  had only a few  beers.  The  girl
 lounging  outside strolled up to him and
 struck a provocative pose. They chatted a
 few moments and then, with it shru.7, -the
 boy nodded and together they set off down
 the dimly lit street. '1'cn minutes later he
 was dead.  they had not meant to kill him,
 just rob Jilin.  But there had baen a scuffle,
 and now  the soldier was very, very dead,
 lying in a foul-smelling alley thousands of
 reviles from home and family.
 Would such an incident have happened if
 the boy had not been drafted into military
 .ervice? Of course that particular incident
 would not have occurred, but what about
 one like it?  Would he have been as likely
 to drift off in an alcoholic haze with some
 other such girl?  Was there, perhaps, some
 flaw in his character from earlier days, or
 did the Army cause him to follow this path?
 After all. everyone who has read "From
 ll:ere to Eternity" knows what the military
 services are like-sex-crazed, hard-drinking,
 profane, and completely controlled by sadis-
 tic sergeants and incompetent officers.  Such
 an environment is bound to corrupt.
 Balderdash.  Let me lay it on the line for
 you. parents of America.   With but a :few
 exceptions, the boy coming out of the mili-
 tary is  the same  basic product that you
 created. So you want it good, clean kid to
 conic home from the Army?  It is easy.  Just
 put a good, clean kid into the Army.
 1: n n not, being flippant. I have been in
 lie Arniv more than 20  years, and I have
 a;een the American serviceman at work and
 at play in the United St'ites and in nearly
 :30 foreign lands.  Some of them started us-
 ing narcotics while others started building
 in  orphanage.      One mail dealt in stolen
 black-market goods, and the Army dealt him
 :l di.shonora.file discharge.  Another from the
 rime platoon attended night school, receiv-
 ing a high school diploma with his hon.or-
 iblo discharge.
 What made the difference?  They were in
 ,be same army.  Could the difference lie in
 the moral training they received before they
 stile into the service?   If it were not so
 trite, I would answer my own question with
 ,teat old chestnut about "As the  twig is
 aeni,."   'oil second thought, I'll say it any-
 way.                      As the twig is bent, so grows the tree,
 aid you had better believe it.
 FOUR KEY FACTORS
 In the military, there appear to be four
 main factors that determine whether a twig
 will bend or grow straight-factors that de-
 termine how each young man will respond
 to the challenges of military life.  It should
 come as no surprise that all four are directly.
 connected with the home and community
 from which he calve.   The things which
 shape a lad's early life also tend to shape
 his career in uniform.
 Here are the four factors:
 Religion: The truly devout soldier is rarely
 in trouble.  Even those who have relaxed
 somewhat in their church attendance are
 good risks if they have a background of
 sound Christian or Jewish training.  Respect
 for the laws of God and man, as taught by
 the religious faiths, is the firmest founda-
 tion upon which to build a good :soldier and a
 good citizen.  The boys who take part in
 church activities and who have learned to
 seek their chaplain's guidance seldom see
 the inside of a military police .;tation.
 Family: The  products  of  unhappy  or
 broken homes have some tendency to have
 unhappy, broken military careers.  I do not
 mean that such a boy is an odds-on favorite
 to be a troublemaker.  The vast: majority of
 all soldiers serve honorably and well. Only
 a small handful is given dishonorable dis-
 charges.  I simply mean that a boy who grew
 up with the love and guidance of two well-
 adjusted parents has a better chance of a
 satisfying Career.
 .Education: The better the education, the
 better the soldier.  There is a direct, almost
 invariable connection.  The reasons are eas-
 ily understood.
 First, the well-educated soldier is assigned
 to better, more interesting duties.  Often he
 is selected to attend highly technical schools
 which not only, qualify him Ice promotion
 and better assignments but also, prepare him
 for good jobs in civilian life.  The educated
 soldier  knows that receiving    such oppor-
 tunities depends in part upon his personal
 conduct.
 Second, the better-schooled soldier has a
 clearer understanding of why he is in the
 Army, why there must be a draft.  If he is
 stationed in Europe, for example, he has
 some knowledge of American f'-reign policy
 and of why our Government believes that
 U.S. forces must be maintained there. Know-
 ing these things, he has a sense of purpose
 and accomplishment that is not fully shared
 by less fortunate fellows.
 Last, lie tends to associate with other well-
 educated soldiers.  As a group, they are the
 ones most frequently seen in the post library,
 the chapel, the education center, and the
 craft shop-and more rarely  seen  in  the
 nightclubs and bars that spawn disciplinary
 problems.
 The girl friend: If a boy has won the love
 or affection of a girl back home, he is more
 likely to be it good soldier.  If they are en-
 gaged, this influence is even :stronger.   A
 picture in the wallet, letters ending with little
 X's and O's-these are forces which never
 should  be underestimated.   The  boy who
 wants a particular girl to be proud of him
 knows she will not be proud if his service is
 dishonorable.  The lad in love is more apt
 to be economy minded.  He sacs his money
 for their future home, for gifts. or to squire
 the girl around when he returns home on
 leave.  Such a soldier will spend less money,
 hence less time, in the cabarets that fre-
 quently cluster about military installations.
 The letters from this all-ir,,portant girl
 are a factor in themselves.  If they are af-
 fectionate and chatty, speaking of familiar
 nieces and people, they are a strong link
 with all the more wholesome, desirable things
 in his life.
 This  matter  of  love  is   a  double-edged
 sword, however.  If the girl spurns him or
 turns to another, strange force's are some-
 times loosened.   While one boy might sit
 in his barracks to brood over his fate, an-
 other may embark upon a wave of rashness,
 turning to the consolation of alcohol or the
 arms of some other, too readily available
 girl.  Which course he follows is determined
 by other factors of religious training, home
 life, and education.
 Note that I have not mentioned such things
 as the soldier's race, social, or economic posi-
 tion,                                                                                                                                           his  national  origin,  or rural  versus
 urban background.     Perhaps statistical study
 would reveal that some of these are         im-
 portant, but in my experience they are not,
 Give me a religious, educated boy from a
 happy home with a wholesome girl in his
 heart, and I have a good soldier.  I do not
 care if he is black, white, or purple, rich or
 poor; he will serve honorably and well and
 will return to his community as it good man
 and a good citizen.
 FEAR OF CORRUPT INFLUENCES
 Why do so many people fear the effects
 of military service on their sons cir relatives?
 To my mind, the reasons are clear.  In the
 first place, there are the newspaper head-
 lines: "Soldier Rapes Teenager"; "Five Ma-
 rines  Killed  in  100-m.p.h.  Police                                                                                                                                        Chase."
 How often do you see headlines blaring,
 "Salesman Robs Bank" or "Bus Driver Slays
 Rival"? Rarely. And it is not because all
 salesmen and all bus drivers are above re-
 proach.
 Exceptions are made, of course, when. a
 civilian's crime is completely inconsistent
 with his occupation: "Choir Director Arrested
 in Opium Den" or "Bank President Charged
 With Shoplifting."  As a rule, however, civil
 occupations are not headlined.
 Why the difference?  I believe it is because
 of the uniform.  It provides a visible identity
 found in few other occupations.  Policemen
 also wear uniforms, and I can well picture a
 headline   proclaiming,   "Policeman Slays
 Wife," but I cannot imagine one announc-
 ing, "Grocer Killed in Three-Car Accident."
 In  short, I  believe  the headlines  give  a
 grossly distorted picture of the serviceman's
 standard of conduct.
 There is a second, more concrete reason
 for parents to fear the corrupting influence
 of military life. After all, Jimmy dad not
 smoke or use swear words before he went
 into the Army, and now he does both.  Proof
 positive.  Well, what would have happened
 to Jimmy if, instead of entering the Army,
 he had left home for the first time to attend
 some large university or to work for a con-
 struction company?   Would he then have
 been less likely to smoke and say dammit?
 No matter where he goes, a lad will pick up
 superficial signs of toughness when he goes
 out into the world of men. I do not believe
 military life is any worse or any better in
 this   regard   than   a   thousand   other
 occupations.
 OBLIGATIONS OF THE MILITARY
 It     may appear   that I wish  to absolve
 the military services of any responsibility
 for the conduct of our citizen-soldiers. That
 is not my desire nor is it the desire of ,,fly
 officer I know.  The service branches have
 a  deep  feeling of  obligation to  do their
 share in preserving and further developing
 the moral stamina of their men.     The rea-
 sons are both idealistic and practical.
 On the idealistic side, we in the services
 do not regard ourselves as being basicr,lly
 separate or different from the rest of the
 American community.  As children, we, too,
 played marbles, went fishing,  came home
 with bloody noses, and loved the smell of
 burning leaves.  Putting on a uniform did
 not mean that we suddenly became indiller-
 enb to all but the military aspects of Ameri-
 can life.  We are citizens as well as soldiers,
 and we feel civic as well as military obliga-
 tions.

 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. ABRAHAM J. MULTER
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, January 18, 1966
 Mr. MULTER.                    Mr. Speaker, I com-
 mend to the attention of our colleagues
 the following article  concerning the
 value of travel by the Members of the
 Congress.
 The article was written by the Hon-
 orable Douglas MacArthur II, the As-
 sistant Secretary of State for Congres-
 sional Relations and one of the most
 able men serving our Nation.
 The article appeared in the November
 1965 Department of State Newsletter and
 follows:
 MACARTHUR:  ON CONGRESSIONAL TRAVEL
 (By Douglas MacArthur II)
 I have long believed, and my present as-
 signment has confirmed me in that belief,
 that there are few areas in which the Depart-
 ment and the Foreign Service have greater
 opportunities for constructive accomplish-
 ment than in dealing with the Congress.
 During the postwar era, it has become in-
 creasingly apparent: that our foreign policy
 cannot be successfully executed without full
 congressional support; that the congressional
 role in foreign policy is growing in scope
 and complexity;  that this is a legitimate
 and necessary development in the conduct
 of a leadership foreign policy by a democ-
 racy;  -and  that the  demands  which  this
 growth  makes    on the Department are
 matched only by the demands it places on
 the Members of Congress themselves.
 Our function, of course, is not-and in-
 deed never was-to resist congressional par-
 ticipation in the policymaking process, but
 rather to welcome it and to help make it an
 efficient and mutually profitable one-for the
 Department and the Service, the Congress,
 and above all, for the American people whose
 interests we all serve.
 There are countless ways in which this
 is being done here in Washington, such as:
 increased briefings of Members and commit-
 tee staffs;  greater contact by Members of
 Congress with  the Diplomatic  Corps  and
 foreign visitors; assigning junior and mid-
 dle grade FSO's to brief tours of duty in
 congressional offices; and the heightened and
 encouraging  departmental  effectiveness in
 the handling of congressional correspond-
 ence.
 A major area of Immediate opportunity
 for increased understanding is the field of
 congressional travel. The misguided tend-
 ency to regard congressional travel duties
 as an annoying chore is, happily, a disappear-
 ing one.  Those of us who have had repeated
 opportunities to deal with traveling Members
 of Congress and their principal staff assist-
 ants have learned that congressional travel,
 if handled properly and with imagination,
 can be a great source of benefit to the De-
 partment as well as to the Congress.
 Perhaps even more important for our FSO's
 in the field, it presents a unique opportunity
 to acquaint Members in detail with the prob-
 lems we are facing abroad and thus engage
 their understanding and support.   At the
 same time it gives those in the field a new
 insight Into the concerns and worries of the
 American people and their elected Repre-
 sentatives in the field of foreign affairs.
 It is difficult to imagine people who have
 heavier demands on their time and energies
 than Members of our Congress.  They have
 their subcommittee work, their committee
 work, quorum calls, rollcalls, national prob-
 lems, the problems of their constituencies,
 and  a  seemingly  never-ending stream  of
 visitors from their home district or State.
 Many, of them simply do not have as much
 time as they would like when they are in
 Washington  to  devote  to  foreign affairs.
 When they travel abroad, on the other hand,
 they are free of many of these pressures and
 do have the time to focus on Important for-
 eign policy problems.
 Contrary to the impression given in some
 irresponsible quarters, congressional travel
 abroad is neither frivolous nor insignificant,
 and I for one would recommend that every
 Member travel as much as his schedule will
 permit.  It is a serious responsibility of their
 office enabling them to gather important ma-
 terial for further legislative work as well as
 deeper understanding of the great Issues of
 war and peace in a troubled world.  It is the
 occasion for them to observe at first hand
 how the Foreign Service functions and how,
 and why, our various programs overseas are
 working.   My  experience,  and  I am sure
 yours, has been that they are, almost with-
 out exception, eager to take advantage of
 this opportunity.
 It is thus vitally important that our of-
 ficers make the most of this chance to show
 the Service at its best as an effective and
 efficient instrument.  We can give Members
 first-hand experiences that they can draw
 upon in responding to their constituents'
 questions or criticisms about the Service as
 well as about programs and policies.
 The proper care and handling of congres-
 sional visitors is a task that demands the
 priority attention and best performance of
 everyone In the Service from the Chief of
 Mission right on down.  Nothing less than
 this will do.
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. CLAIR CALLAN
 OF NEBRASKA
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Tuesday, January 18, 1966
 Mr. CALLAN.                               Mr. Speaker, it is not
 often a Member of Congress has the
 opportunity and pleasure to discuss a
 concrete action program instituted by in-
 terested citizens because they saw a need
 and decided to meet it. I have that dis-
 tinct pleasure today, Mr. Speaker.
 A group of interested citizens of Lin-
 coln, Nebr., have for some time been con-
 cerned with the phenomenal increase in
 crime in the United States and have de-
 cided that citizen action is one of the
 few really long-term, effective methods
 available to counteract this national
 disease.
 Mr. Speaker, Lincoln, Nebr., is not
 faced with the massive increase in crime
 that has plagued other areas of the coun-
 try.  But any crime is too much and
 Lincoln is a growing city and planning
 for the future has always been one of its
 trademarks.
 The Lincoln Junior Chamber of Com-
 merce, led by a member of my human
 iresources committee, Mr. Ben Goble,
 has devised PAL which stands for people
 and law. An individual citizen may be-
 come a member for a small membership
 fee and participate in the activities of
 the organization-all of which are sup-
 ported by the dues and other donations.
 PAL will publish periodic bulletins on
 law enforcement, crime statistics, how
 the individual citizen may aid law en-
 forcement officials, and training pro-
 grams.  In addition, PAL will sponsor a
 monthly award to a local law enforce-
 ment official who has distinguished him-
 self as an officer and a citizen, sponsor
 a scholarship fund to be used by a stu-
 dent in the field of law, criminology or
 other related fields, and act as a resource
 group to promote the coordination and
 dissemination of information pertaining
 to law enforcement activities to schools,
 civic, service, and religious groups.
 I commend the idea to those in other
 areas who face far greater problems in
 the area of rising crime rates.

 SOURCE AND RELIABILITY OF THE ESrIMATEs
 aourcc of data
 information about the 1964 income of male
 civilian noninstitutional war veterans in the
 United States was derived from the Bureau
 of the Census' March 1965 Current Popula-
 tion Survey sample of approximately 25,000
 households.   The income distributions  by
 .ige were applied to the independent VA esti-
 mates by age of the male civilian noninsti-
 tutional war veteran population in the Unit-
 ed States to develop the income data pre-
 sented in this report.  Although income data
 are for the year 1964, the age refers to March
 1965.   (For details of the survey see "Con-
 sumer Income, Current Population Reports."
 series  P-60,  INTO.  47, Sept.  24,  1965,  U.S.

 Armed Forces during a war period (Spanish-

 institutional population excludes all mem-
 bers of the Armed Forces, and inme..tes of
 penal institutions, chronic disease hoF,pitals,
 nursing homes, and the like.
 Reliability of the estimates
 Since the estimates are based on a sample,
 they may differ somewhat from the figures
 that would have been obtained if a complete
 census had been taken using the same sched-
 ules, instructions, and enumerators.  As in
 any survey work, the results are sub;(eot to
 errors of response and of reporting, as well
 as being subject to sampling variability.
 The standard error is primarily a measure
 of sampling variability; that is, of the varia-

 tions that occur by chance because a sample
 rather than the whole of the population is
 surveyed.  As calculated for this report., the
 standard error also partially measures the ef-
 fects of response and enumeration errors but
 does not measure any systematic biases in
 the data.  The chances are about 68 out of
 100 that an estimate from the sample will
 differ from a complete census figure by less
 than one standard error.  The chances are
 about 95 out of 100 that the difference would
 be less than twice the standard error.  The
 following table shows the approximate s t:Ind-

 upon both the size of the percentage and
 the size of the class upon which the per-

 part of any committee, but at my own
 expense so that I could report to the peo-
 ple of the Seventh District of Alabama,
 the situation in Vietnam as I saw it from
 firsthand inspection.
 Upon my retur_, I issued a report to my
 constituents on Vietnam and, under per-
 mission to extend my remarks in the
 RECORD I would like t., include that re-
 port.              Of course, there have been later
 developments since my return from Viet-
 nam, including the massive peace drive
 launched  by  the  President  over  the
 Christmas period.
 I believe we should do all possible to
 seek a peaceful solution to the war in
 Vietnam and I find no fault in the ef-
 forts to do so. My concern is, that in our
 i? er. 'e desire for peace that we may set-
 tle for less than victory. I would hate to
 think that Vietnam will become another
 Korea and that 12 years from now we
 will still have thou, ands of American
 boys still stationed in those jungles to
 maintain a peace that is not really a
 peace, but rather : stalemate.  I would
 hate to think that we would get a peace
 in Vietnam by giving in to the Commu-
 nists as we did in Laos and permit a
 Communist takeover under th3 guise of
 a coalition go--ernment.
 We should be prepared to negotiate,
 but at the same time we should maintain
 our strength, our capacity for victory and
 make sure that the enemy knows we have
 that capacity and will use it if forced
 to d-) so by their failure to end their
 aggression.
 My report on Vietnam, which was re-
 leased in December, follows:
 SPECIAL  REPORT  ON  VIETNAM
 (By JIM MARTIN, Member of Congress)
 The cold war between the Communist con-
 spiracy and the free world has become a hot
 and blazing war in Vietnam.   Contrary to
 the statements of the pacifist and pro-Com-
 munist demonstrators, the war in South Viet-
 nam is not a civil war against a tyrannical
 government.  It is naked aggression of South
 Vietnam by Communist North Vietnam, en-
 couraged and supported by Red China and
 Soviet Russia.   I have just traveled more
 than 20,000 miles through all of Asia and
 into the Middle East for a firsthand investi-
 gation.  This report is based on conditions as
 I found them in my tours of the villages of
 Korea, Taiwan,   South Vietnam,  Thailand,
 and India; through briefings by our civilian
 and military leaders and through lengthy
 conversations with the businessmen, indus-
 trialists, political leaders, and the people of
 all the countries I visited.
 Any study of the war in Vietnam must be-
 gin with the stated creed of the communist
 leaders of Red China.  Mao Tse-tung, head
 of  the  Communist   Party  in  China,  has
 stated:
 "Every Communist must grasp the truths.
 Political power grows out of the barrel of a
 gun.  Whoever has an army has power, for
 war settles everything. The theory of war
 and strategy is the core of everything."
 Every action of Red China has been based
 on that creed.  They have attempted to stir
 up discontent and revolution in both Africa
 and Asia and where subversion did not work,
 they resorted to upright aggression as in
 Korea and now in Vietnam.   This is the
 enemy we face, and the Communist goal of
 world domination has never changed.  Even
 now the only differences between Red China
 and Soviet Russia is on how to accomplish
 the goal.  The Russian leaders believe the
 world can be subverted through subtle means
 while the Chinese leaders believe in the hard
 core Communist line of Lenin and Stalin,
 that the world must be conquered through
 war.
 My first impression in my travel through
 Asia was the lesson of Korea.  We may be
 making  the  same  mistake  in  Vietnam.
 Twelve years after the armistice in Korea,
 the United States still has 50,000 American
 soldiers there facing the Communist enemy
 eyeball to eyeball across the 38th parallel.
 Our military was prevented from winning the
 war in Korea because of political decisions
 which gave enemy forces a safe sanctuary in
 Chinese territory across the Yalu River and
 because they were prevented from bombing
 the supply lines leading into North Korea
 from Red China.
 Today, in Vietnam our military forces are
 facing many of the same restrictions.  We
 cannot win the war in Vietnam by sending
 American boys into the gristmill formed by
 the countless thousands of North Vietnamese
 and   Red  Chinese  which  can  be thrown
 against them from safe sanctuaries in Red
 China, Cambodia, and Laos.  It is clear to
 me, and I am convinced my views are shared
 by our generals and commanding officers in
 Vietnam, that we should win the war and
 then negotiate the political problems.
 We can win the war if we give the military
 the authority to win it.  First.  We should
 blockade the harbor at Hai Phong, mining it
 if necessary and warning all nations that no
 more  material  of war  will  be  permitted.
 Second.  We should authorize the Air Force
 to bomb strategic military targets such as
 the two railroads and mountain passes in
 North Vietnam which are direct routes for
 shipping war supplies into North Vietnam
 from China.  We should also bomb military
 airfields, actual missile sites wherever they
 are located even within the safe sanctuary
 around Hanoi.  Bombing targets should also
 include munitions factories as well as gaso-
 line and fuel storage tanks, all of which are
 now out of bounds for our Air Force within
 certain restricted areas.  Third.  We should
 make clear to any enemy troops threatening
 the South Vietnamese that there will be no
 sanctuary from which they may safely in-
 vade.  The United States has the potential
 forces to smash the Communist enemy in
 Vietnam, and we should assure our com-
 manding general there that he will be given
 whatever forces and supplies necessary to
 win. The military is ready-the American
 people are in support of a policy to win-it is
 up to the administration to give the word.
 CLEAR POLICY BACKED BY DEEDS IS NEEDED
 While the hot war is in Vietnam, we can-
 not isolate one single country in Asia.  The
 target of Red China is all of Asia, then Africa,
 and finally, the world.  Like it or not, the
 United States is looked to for leadership by
 those nations and those people who still hope
 to remain free.  From my conversations with
 people in all walks of life in the countries I
 visited, I find that the people of Asia are
 concerned about our intentions and our will-
 ingness to back our words with deeds.  They
 are not sure we will stick with them when the
 chips are down.  They are afraid of another
 stalemate such as Korea.  They are afraid we
 may withdraw our troops before the victory
 is won.  The statement by the S?cretary of
 Defense prior to the last election that "we
 will bring the boys home from Vietnam by
 Christmas," caused a shattering blow to the
 morale of the South Vietnamese.  Feeling
 that we were getting ready to pull out, many
 of the village chiefs and others in South
 Vietnam prepared to make peace with the
 Vietcong.  Sharing the belief that we would
 not stay, the Vietcong were able to consoli-
 date their hold on nearly 80 percent of the
 land and the people of South Vietnam.  In
 addition, American mothers were given the
 false hope that their boys would not have to
 fight.  We are paying in blood for this mis-
 take in judgment.
 A193
 .  We must make it clear that the United
 States stands with all those who want to
 be free and are determined to fight for their
 freedom.  Then we must show by deed, that
 is by force of arms and determination, that
 we are prepared to win the war in Vietnam
 and meet head on any future Communist
 aggression.
 TRIP NO EXPENSE TO GOVERNMENT
 In the months ahead I will report to you
 in greater detail on my tour of inspection.
 I would like to make two things clear.  This
 trip was made at my expense.  My adminis-
 trative assistant accompanied me and he,
 too, paid his own way-as did Mr. Wallace
 Malone of Dothan.  The trip was made with
 the encouragement of the Department of
 State and the commanding officers in the
 field because they feel it is most important
 that Members of Congress see at first hand
 actual conditions in Vietnam, the need for
 all-out effort, and the manner in which our
 troops are meeting the challenge.
 Job Corps Has Backer in Flint
 EXTENSION OF REMARKS
 OF
 HON. JOHN C. MACKIE
 OF MICHIGAN
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, January 13, 1966
 Mr. MACKIE.                                                       Mr. Speaker, the Office
 of Economic Opportunity's Job Corps
 program is starting to pay dividends.
 Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to
 read the following excellent story on one
 Job Corps graduate that appeared re-
 cently in the Flint, Mich., Journal.
 The tax dollars used to train Leonard
 Hamilton will, I am sure, be repaid a hun-
 dredfold in the years ahead. The money
 being spent on the war on poverty is one
 of the best investments America can
 make in its future:
 [From the Flint  (Mich.)  Journal, Dec. 26,
 19651
 JOB CORP HAS BACKER IN FLINT
 (By Herschel P. Fink)
 Six months ago Leonard Hamilton had
 trouble finding a job.
 He was 20 years old and had dropped out
 of school after the 10th grade.  For a while
 he worked as a janitor.  Then he found work
 clearing construction sites of weeds and pop
 bottles.  Sometimes he couldn't find work.
 Today, Hamilton sits at a draftsman's table
 in a brightly lighted office at Consumers
 Power Co.   He has a trade that he hopes
 will mean the start of a new life for him.
 The Job Corps, part of President John-
 son's  war on poverty,  gave Hamilton the
 chance to do something for himself.  He is
 the first graduate of a Job Corps camp to
 return to the Flint area.
 Since last May, about 30 area men, aged
 16 to 21, have gone to Job Corps camps
 around the country for training.   Many of
 them, like Hamilton, were high school drop-
 outs who found that thier lack of job skills
 made them virtually unemployable or suited
 only for menial labor.
 Hamilton looked at the Job Corps as "my
 last hope."  He heard about it while watch-
 ing television last April and applied at the
 Michigan Employment Security Commission's
 Flint office, 706 North Street.
 In June, he was assigned to the Gary Job
 Corps Center in San Marcos, Tex.
 At  the camp, Hamilton was allowed  to
 choose from a variety of skills being taught.
 He picked a drafting course.   Besides job

 "excellent in connection with his potential
 in the drafting field."

 was offered a job as an assistant instructor.
 "But I was in a hurry to get back and.

 Corps-one of the highest there-he quali-

 it imilton considers joining the Job Corps
 "one of the best things a boy can do if he
 wants to learn."
 Life at the Job Corps camp wasn't easy,
 he said, "but if you want to do something
 bad enough, you learn to take the bad with
 Lite good."
 Re emphasizes that a youth "has to want
 to learn, to profit from the Job Corps."
 Ile is happy about his decision to join.
 "When things get hard, you can't get un-
 skilled work.  But when you've got a trade,
 you don't have much to worry about."
 Hamilton doesn't plan to end his ediica-
 Lion with  his Job  Corps  graduation.  He
 hopes to take advantage of  a Consumers'
 program which will pay 75 percent of college
 tuition costs.  He wants to take classes at
 Flint Junior College.  Eventually, he would.

 ZION. RICHARD D. McCARTHY
 OF NEW YORK
 IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
 Thursday, January 13, 1966
 Vfr. MCCARTHY.  Mr. Speaker, one
 of America's great. soldier-statesmen is
 Gen. James M. Gavin.  A beribboned
 World  War II paratroop commander,
 General Gavin was a strong exponent of
 more aerial mobility for ground troops.
 This sky cavalry concept is now being
 used effectively by the United States in
 Vietnam.
 After distinguished service as our Am -
 bassador to France, General Gavin re-
 turned to the United States.  He is now
 president of that eminent research firm,
 Arthur L). Little, Inc., of Cambridge,
 Mass.
 in a letter appearing in the February
 1966 issue of Harper's magazine, the
 p    i, p
 no
 and  It  wi
 North Vietnam. troops into the South.
 I concur with the general's view of
 this matter.  Indeed, it was this convic-
 tion that motivated me to join recently
 with 16 of my House colleagues in writ-
 ing the President to express our vigorous
 opposition to those, including Richard
 Nixon and Barry Goldwater, woo have
 urged the United States to extend its
 bombings to the Hanoi area.
 General Gavin also makes tht: follow-
 ing vital point.  He said that the 190,000
 U.S. troops already in the Vietnam the-
 ater would suffice "if we should maintain
 enclaves on the coast, desist in our bomb-
 ing attacks on North Vietnam, lnd seek
 to find a solution through the United
 Nations or a conference in Geneva."
 This proposal is similar to one made
 some months ago and repeated since
 then  by  the  distinguished  Columnist
 Walter Lipprnann.
 And the Washington Post, in an edi-
 torial Sunday, January 16, took a similar
 approach:
 It is our purpose-
 The Post declared--
 to deny North Vietnam the fruits or it war of
 national liberation, and we can do that by
 successfully holding the areas now occupied
 and slowly and persistently enlarging them
 by  territorial  sweeps  instead  of  jungle
 pursuit.
 Under leave to extend my remarks and
 inclu.dc extraneous matter, I include here
 an Associated Press report on General
 Gavin's letter which appeared in the
 Washington Post of January 17, and the
 Post's editorial of January 16:
 [From the Washington (D.C.) Post, Jan. 17,
 191361
 GAVIN  SAYS  HANOI  BOMBING  Coin  BRING
 IN PEIi'ING UNITS
 NEW YoRK., January 16.-Gen. James M.
 Gavin declared today a massive buildup of
 U.S. forces                                 in Vietnam may prompt Red
 China to send troops there and reopen the
 Korean war as well.
 The 58-year-old former chief of U.S. Army
 research  and  development  suggested that
 America   concentrate  instead  on  holding
 major bases along the South Vietnam coast
 while diplomats seek an end to the fighting.
 In  a  letter  appearing  in   the February
 issue of Harper's magazine, Gavin said:
 "To increase the bombing and to bomb
 Hanoi-or  even Peiping-will  add to     our
 problems rather than detract from them,
 and it will not stop the penetrations of
 North Vietnam troops into the south.
 "Also, if we were to quadruple. for exam-
 ple, our combat forces there, we should then
 anticipate the intervention of Chinese 'vol-
 unteers' and the reopening of the Korean
 front.
 ESCALATION SEEN LIKELI
 "This seems to be the ultimate prospect
 of the course that we are now e,n."
 Gavin said the 190,000 U.S. troops already
 In the Vietnam theater would suffice "if we
 should maintain enclaves on the coast, de-
 sist in our bombing attacks on North Viet-
 nam, and seek to find a solution through
 the  United  Nations  or  a  conference  in
 He asserted that an attempt to make all
 of South Vietnam secure from the Commu-
 nists "would take many times as much force
 as we now have in Vietnam"--and risk a
 fresh outbreak of Red Chinese aggression in
 the Korean pattern.
 "I do not for a moment think that if we
 should  withdraw from Vietnam  the  next
 stop would be Waikiki," Gavin said.. "The
 Kra Peninsula, Thailand, and the Philip-
 pines can all be secured, although we ulti-
 mately might have heavy fighting on the
 northern frontiers of Thailand."
 Emphasizing that he spoke "solely from a
 military- technical point of view," Gavin re-
 called that he was Chief of U.S. Army plans
 and operations at the time of the French
 military disaster in Dicnbienphu.
 He said Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway, then
 Chief of Staff, "directed that we go into the
 situation quite thoroughly in case a decision
 should be made to send U.S. forces into the
 Hanoi delta."
 "The  more  we  studied  the  situation,"
 Gavin wrote, "the more we realized that we
 were, in fact, considering going to war with
 China, since she was supplying all the arms,
 ammunition, medical, and other supplies to
 Ho Chi Minh.
 "If we would be, in fact, fighting China,
 then we were fighting her in the wrong place
 on terms entirely to her advantage."
 Gavin said southeast Asia is no place to
 take on Red China in military combat.
 "Manchuria, with its vast industrial com-
 plex, coal, and iron ore, is the Ruhr -of China
 and the heart of its war-making capacity,"
 he said.  "There, rather than in southeast
 Asia, is where China should be engaged, if at
 ad!."
 SHOWDOWN NOT YET DUE
 Gavin added that if Red China continues
 aggression  and  arms  itself  with  nuclear
 weapons "the time may come when China
 will bring upon herself a nuclear war.   But
 that time is not here yet."
 Gavin, a paratroop commander in World
 War II, retired from the Army in 1958 be-
 cause of differences with the Eisenhower ad-
 ministration  over modernizing the                                                                                                                                                  Armed
 Forces.  He was a particularly strong expo-
 nent of more  aerial  mobility  for ground
 troops.
 Gavin called this "the sky cavalry concept,
 which we are now employing in South Viet-
 nam" and commented:
 "When I retired in 1958, I said that I would
 be happy to serve as a private in the Army if
 it were the kind of an Army that I wanted it,
 to be.
 "I think  it  is  that  kind  of  an  Army
 now. * * *"

 Jan. 16, 19661
 AFTER THE PAUSE
 The President very wisely has put no ter-
 minal date on his peace offensive or on the
 pause in air operations against the North
 while the peace efforts go forward.  Since
 there has  been  no known response from
 Hanoi, either affirmative or :negative, it is
 too early to say whether there will be any
 results. Sooner or later, if there are no ne-
 gotiations at all, consideration will have to
 be given to the next military moves.
 There is a powerful impulse in the Con-
 gress, in the country, and in some places in
 the executive department, for a resumption
 of air activity and for an initiation of full-
 scale warfare against the North to put it
 speedy end to a disagreeable war.  Powerful
 as this impulse is, and strong as the support
 may be for the use of more military muscle,
 it is to be hoped that the President will
 reject the counsels of those who wish to es-
 calate the 'war.  There is not much reason
 to believe that an unlimited air war would
 achieve  decisive results.   North  Vietnam
 does not present the kind of industrial tar-
