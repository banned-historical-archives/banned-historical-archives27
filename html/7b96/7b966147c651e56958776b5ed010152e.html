 INTRODUCTORY NOTE
 The reason for writing this paper is that Mao Tse-tung, who has
 dominated the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) for more than 40 years,
 may soon be totally incapacitated or dead, and that his degree of
 dominance has been such that his departure will profoundly affect the
 Chinese scene, regardless of whether violence is avoided.
 The enormous power and authority of the Chairman must somehow
 be divided-by agreement or through struggle-among a number of
 successors, This paper attempts to identify the key figures and
 contending factions.
 This paper is organized sequentially, considering factors and
 contingencies in three periods: prior to Mao's death, around the time of
 death, and after death (meaning, a few months). In the first period, the
 question of access to and influence on Mao arises. In the second period,
 there are at least three dramatic possibilities: an attempted coup in
 Peking, intervention by Military Region leaders outside Peking, and a
 Soviet attack. In the third period, power must be distributed, and there
 seem to be at least three inescapable policy-questions for those who
 share in it: their relationship to Mao's "thought," their attitude toward
 the "rehabilitation"  of leaders brought down in  the Cultural
 Revolution, and their management of the Chinese position in the Sino-
 Soviet-American triangle. (It is recognized that other controversial issues
 might be taken up on their merits or for factional advantage.)
 Throughout this paper,  the words  Leftist(s), Centrist(s), and
 Rightist(s) are used to indicate points on the Chinese political spectrum.
 These words do not imply fixed and predictable positions on every
 possible issue, but refer to apparent predilections. These designations are
 assigned to individuals and factions primarily in terms of apparent
 allegiance to and fervor for Mao's fundamental revolutionary vision.
 This revolutionary vision (put summarily) calls for the creation,
 through continuing "class struggle," of a completely politicized and
 selfless, ideologically-motivated man, and of an egalitarian and largely
 self-sufficient China, in which differences between mental and manual
 labor, industry and agriculture, the city and the countryside have been
 abolished. It also calls for the creation of Maoist-type Communist

 parties, responsive to the CCP, to take power in other countries; but this
 objective has increasingly conflicted with, and been subordinated to,
 Mao's intense nationalism and the need as he has seen it to protect
 China's national security against Soviet "social-imperialism."
 It is hoped that this presentation of selected factors and contingencies
 will be of some value to the reader in the months ahead, even though
 much of the paper is highly conjectural.

 PRINCIPAL JUDGMENTS
 Mao Tse-tung, 82, appears to be deteriorating rapidly, and China is
 probably already under some degree of "collective" leadership.
 Those with the greatest access to Mao, and in the best position to
 influence whatever decisions he is able to make in his last months,
 appear to be the Centrist Hua Kuo-feng, Mao's latest and current
 favorite, and the police figure Wang Tung-hsing, the head of Mao's
 personal bodyguard. Hua will probably bear the mark of Mao's favor
 into the post-Mao struggle, although this will not assure Hua's primacy
 in the successor leadership.
 DRAMATIC, BUT UNLIKELY, POSSIBILITIES
 There is a possibility-to be taken seriously-of a coup at the time of
 Mao's death. The passed-over and unpopular Leftists, fearful about
 their futures, or Rightist military leaders, fearful of the Leftists, might
 conspire with the most important figures of the physical security
 apparatus-the leaders of the Peking Military Region (MR) and of the
 smaller inner-core forces. However, the key security figures seem
 unlikely to cooperate in any coup. Moreover, any hypothetical group of
 conspirators would have to have the cooperation or assent of the main-
 force armies of the Peking MR (not just the MR commanders);
 otherwise the coup could be quickly reversed. A coup would carry a high
 risk of splitting the military forces of the MR, leading to armed clashes
 among them, in turn risking the spread of armed conflict throughout
 China. Almost all of the post-Mao leaders would probably wish to avoid
 this.
 Intervention in the succession process by leaders of the 10 MRs
 outside Peking seems most unlikely unless Peking itself is in a state of
 chaos and the conflict has spread further. While the Russians might
 offer-especially in a state of civil war-to provide substantial material
 support to a group of MR leaders whom they believed to be pro-Soviet,
 no such leaders can now be identified, and the central leaders are
 unlikely to allow the situation to deteriorate to the point that either the
 outlying MR leaders or the Russians would attempt to intervene.

 A Soviet attack on China at the time of Mao's death seems the least
 likely of the dramatic possibilities. There are too many obstacles to a
 meaningful military or political victory for the Russians. Beyond this,
 with Mao's death there will be a qualitatively new political situation for
 Moscow to try to exploit. The sensible course for the Russians, with their
 most implacable enemy departed, will be to talk, not fight.
 A TENSE "COLLECTIVE"
 Mao's successors, even if they have been working reasonably well
 together during Mao's deterioration, and even if they avoid violence at
 the time of Mao's, death, will still face a difficult problem in distributing
 power among themselves in the immediate post-Mao period. This will
 be especially true if the leaders decide to retire the post of Chairman,
 which would place Hua Kuo-feng on a collision course with the Leftist
 Chang Chun-chiao for the post of Secretary-General of the Party, then
 the Party's topmost position. (In a showdown in the Politburo, Hua
 would-seem likely to attract more votes and to have a better claim to the
 support of military and security forces.) The preferable course would
 seem to be to retain the Chairmanship, dividing power between Hua
 (continuing for a time as First Vice-Chairman) and Chang (continuing
 as Secretary-General).
 No one person, whatever his title, will be able to dominate the Party
 as Mao had. Nor, probably, can any single faction-whether Centrist,
 Rightist, Leftist, or other. The group that dominates will probably prove
 to be some combination of the strongest figures from all points of the
 political spectrum.
 In addition to the difficulty of calculating the perceptions of various
 leaders as to one another's strengths (especially, military/security
 support) too little is known of the personal character of the conjectured
 key figures to permit a confident judgment as to whether all or most of
 them would prove able to subordinate their serious differences with
 others, and their personal ambitions, to the common good. On balance,
 however, it seems likely that most of the key figures, acting from a sense
 of national interest, will be able to agree upon some form of "collective"
 leadership-one which, at least for a time, will conceal the extent of
 their differences.
 A POSSIBLE EQUITABLE ARRANGEMENT
 There is a possible distribution of power among the most important
 figures which would seem equitable to outside observers. The center-line

 in such a "collective" would run through the Center of the Chinese
 political spectrum-" moderate" in Chinese terms, although still more
 "revolutionary" than, say, the leadership of the Communist Party of the
 Soviet Union. The constellation would be:
 -The Centrist Hua Kuo-feng, c. 56, as the Party's principal
 officer;
 -The Leftist Chang Chun-chiao, c. 64, as next-ranking officer or
 Premier;
 -The Rightist old Marshal Yeh Chien-ying, 78, and the "wild
 card" Chen Hsi-lien, 63, remaining respectively Minister of
 Defense and Commander of the Peking MR, the principal
 figures of the Military Affairs Committee which controls and
 directs the armed forces;*
 -The Centrist Chi Teng-kuei, in his late 40s, remaining the Party's
 supervisor of organizational work and the other key figure (first
 political officer) of the Peking MR, and becoming the back-up
 for Hua or Chang in the Party or governmental structure;
 -Another "wild card," Wang Tung-hsing, 60, continuing in the
 role of director of the Party's political security apparatus (secret
 police);
 -Most of the above, plus one of the lesser Leftists-the now
 second-ranking Vice-Chairman, young Wang Hung-wen, about
 40, or Madame Mao, 61, or the propagandist Yao Wen-yuan,
 about 45-as composing the bulk of the Politburo Standing
 Committee, the core of Party power; and
 -The Rightist Chiao Kuan-hua, 64, the very able protege of Chou
 En-lai, continuing as Foreign Minister.
 CENTRIST POLICIES
 A centrist leadership of this kind would be expected to take Centrist
 positions on three inescapable policy-questions: the group's relationship
 to Mao's "thought," the concept of "rehabilitation," and the Sino-
 Soviet-American triangle.
 Mao's successors will almost certainly affirm their fidelity to his
 "thought," in the interest of continuity and because they have been so
 *The term "wild card" is used herein for a leader whose record does not permit his classification as Left,
 Center, or Right, but whose power is such that his support would be of great value to any classifiable
 contender. It may turn out that the "wild cards" make the critical difference in shaping the succession.

 intimately associated with his policies.  Some of the disruptive
 manifestations of Mao's "thought," however, can and very probably
 will be modified, but quietly, employing other aspects of the "thought"
 to justify this.
 Mao's policy of "rehabilitation"-of thousands of Party cadres,
 government functionaries, and military leaders brought down in the
 Cultural Revolution, many of whom are again in important posts-will
 probably be reaffirmed, although many will remain purged. Any
 attempt by Leftist leaders to reverse this policy would probably lead to
 their own downfall.
 Mao's successors may move to reduce the tension in the Sino-Soviet
 relationship, even in the immediate post-Mao period. For example,
 there seems a good chance that the Chinese will quietly modify their
 demands in the border dispute. This might be seen as having the
 additional advantage of inducing the US to move more rapidly toward
 "normalization" of relations with Peking.
 It is not expected, however, that the Chinese will adopt a policy of
 equidistance from the USSR and the US. The probability seems strong
 that the USSR will remain the "main enemy," and that Mao's
 successors will persist in the policy of attempting to use the US as a
 strategic counterweight to the USSR. If for no other reason than that
 Peking's exploration of the potential of the US connection has not yet
 been completed, almost any constellation of post-Mao leaders could be
 expected to continue the process of exploration, even while complaining
 that the pace of "normalization" of relations is too slow.

 THE DISCUSSION
 MAO'S DETERIORATION
 Mao Tse-tung, 82 last December, has appeared to
 be deteriorating rapidly since March of this year. He is
 already incapacitated to the point that he no longer
 makes even brief appearances, and he may become
 totally incapacitated, or die, within the next few
 months. (See photograph.)
 As of October 1975, Mao impressed perceptive
 foreign visitors as still clearly the dominant figure in
 China, and it was just at that time that Mao
 personally set in motion the process that was to
 culminate in the purge of Teng Hsiao-ping in 1976.
 Mao was still lucid in December and January, and was
 credibly reported to have personally nominated Hua
 Kuo-feng to replace Teng as Acting Premier in late
 January. On 23 February, he met for about an hour
 and 40 minutes with former President Nixon.
 Mao did not appear again until 17 March, at which
 time he gave a strong impression of diminished vigor.
 Nevertheless, he was credibly reported to be
 continuing to provide general instructions on the
 management of the anti-Teng campaign, and the
 rapid and severe 7 April response to the Tienanmen
 demonstrations of early April-including the purge of
 Teng and the appointments of Hua Kuo-feng (as First
 Vice-Chairman and Premier), both credibly attributed
 to Mao's initiative-looked as though Mao were still
 in command. *
 '"It may reasonably be asked why, if the terms Leftist, Centrist,
 and Rightist are meaningful, Mao named the Centrist Hua Kuo-
 feng to these key posts rather than elevating two Leftists (Wang
 Hung-wen and Chang Chun-chiao) who were hierarchically next in
 line for those posts-Leftists whose policy predilections had been
 closer to Mao's heart. The apparent answer is that Mao lacked
 confidence in the Leftists' ability to conduct China's affairs in the
 difficult period which Mao knew to lie ahead, and that he chose
 Hua as the ablest administrator for that period, the nearest thing to
 another Chou En-lai, who was not an ideologue at all but a manager
 and conciliator, and who nevertheless was the only one of Mao's
 principal lieutenants of the past 15 years to have remained in Mao's
 favor until his death. (See photograph on page 9.) Hua was a
 "compromise"-not one forced on Mao by other leaders, but in the
 sense that Hua was (as Mao saw it) a man like Chou, who could be
 relied upon to avoid the excesses repeatedly committed by the
 Leftists while not abandoning Mao's long-term objectives as a
 Rightist would. Mao stopped short of formally designating Hua as
 his successor, in the way that the Leftist Lin Piao had been
 designated.
 Mao appeared twice in April for brief conversations.
 In the second of these, he had a new English-language
 interpreter, the Harvard-educated Chi Chao-chu,
 suggesting at least the possibility of a need for someone
 quick-witted enough to `cover' for Mao on occasion,
 concealing possible gaps in Mao's comprehension and
 supplying plausible answers when Mao could not.
 Again in May Mao appeared twice briefly, looking
 very enfeebled. His head lolled, he was clearly
 partially paralyzed on his right side, and may have
 been partially paralyzed on his left.
 In mid-June Mao failed to meet with a visiting
 head-of-state, and a spokesman reportedly cited a
 "Central Committee" (or "Party Central," meaning
 Politburo Standing Committee) decision to put an end
 to Mao's audiences with foreign visitors, on grounds of

 questions as to the degree to which Mao could still
 dominate the Party leadership, and as to the degree to
 which China might already be under a "collective"
 leadership.
 Nevertheless, as of mid-August there was some
 reason to believe that Mao was still making decisions.
 The shift to a harder line (by various Chinese
 spokesmen, in talks with Americans) on the problem of
 Taiwan than Premier Hua Kuo-feng had been
 taking-actually, a counterproductive line-could
 probably have been imposed only by someone with
 greater authority than Hua, which narrows the field to
 just one man, Mao himself, who is known to have
 expressed impatience about this issue. Lacking
 evidence of Mao's total incapacitation, it must be
 presumed that Mao is still able to intervene effectively
 when he chooses to do so.
 Access and Influence: Various observers have noted
 the possibility that Mao will not soon die, but will
 linger on, continuing to deteriorate until he not only
 can no longer dominate the Party but cannot even take
 part in the decision-making process, so that he is
 simply being used by others acting in his name.
 There would seem to be at least two stages in such a
 decline. One would be that in which a deteriorated but
 still authoritative Mao is increasingly susceptible to
 the influence of the few other leaders who have access
 to him (perhaps the stage that we are in now), and the
 other would be that in which he would be simply a
 vegetable, like Lenin in his last months, allowing for a
 third possible stage in which the one condition would
 pass into the other.
 In recent months, those who have visibly had access
 to Mao are of course those who have appeared with
 him in his meetings with foreign visitors: First Vice-
 Chairman and Premier Hua Kuo-feng, Foreign
 Minister Chiao Kuan-hua, and Mao's interpreters and
 nurses. In his more private life, in which major
 decisions are made, there are probably at least two
 others: Madame Mao, who reportedly is again living
 with Mao and may still be the head of his personal
 secretariat (managing his mail and running his
 errands), and Wang Tung-hsing, the head of his
 personal bodyguard. * There are probably others who
 have access occasionally, including some or all of the
 other three active members (besides Mao and Hua) of
 the Politburo Standing Committee: the Leftists Chang
 Chun-chiao and (possibly) Wang Hung-wen-the two
 leaders passed over when Hua was named-and the
 Rightest old Marshal Yeh Chien-ying.
 Thus leading figures of the Center, Left, and Right
 all still have access.**
 "factional" leadership below Mao's level. These have not been
 factions in an extreme sense, barely distinguishable from
 conspiracies, but loosely-organized factions in the sense that Mao
 himself has approved: persons with common predilections who tend
 to offer Mao options which he himself has described as Left,
 Centrist, and Right. (In periods of Left turns or course-corrections,
 the Leftists, or "radicals," or ideologues have had the foremost roles;
 in periods of Right turns, the comparatively Rightist, "moderate,"
 pragmatic leaders.) At present, the principal figure in the
 management of China's affairs appears to be a Centrist. Although
 Mao has made the final decisions on large matters of policy and has
 manipulated his "factions," standing above them as the final
 arbiter, these factions have appeared to have special interests and
 have tended to manipulate the situation so as to advance these
 interests, sometimes at the expense of other groups, and in this sense
 can be said to have manipulated Mao himself.

 Cultural Revolution, restored to nominal position in 1969, died in limited favor in July 1976.
 Chou En-lai, the PRC's only Premier until 1976, Mao's first lieutenant in the period 1970=
 1976, died in favor in January 1976; now being indirectly denigrated in the anti-Teng
 campaign.
 Chen Yun, for many years the regime's foremost economic specialist, set aside in the
 early 1960s and criticized during the Cultural Revolution; still alive but inactive.
 Liu Shao-chi, Mao's first lieutenant from the early 1940s until 1965, at which time he
 was Mao's designated successor; in 1966, became the highest-ranking victim of the Cultural
 Revolution and the prime symbol of all opposition to Mao's policies; has made no
 appearance after that time, although may still be alive.
 Mao Tse-tung, the Chinese Communist Party's dominant figure for more than 40 years
 and its only Chairman since 1943, now ill and apparently dying; his present role in the Party's
 leadership, apart from his citation as the authority for every major policy, cannot be judged.
 Teng Hsiao-ping, Secretary-General of the Party and Liu Shao-chi's principal deputy in
 the period 1954-1966, purged with Liu in 1966; "rehabilitated" by Mao, and returned to
 power in 1974, in 1975 (with Chou's illness) was wielding power second only to Mao's; under
 attack as a "capitalist-roader" since February 1976, replaced at that time as Acting Premier,
 removed from all posts in April 1976.
 Lin Piao, distinguished as a military leader, succeeded Liu Shao-chi as Mao's first
 lieutenant in 1966, and in 1969 was designated in the Party Constitution as Mao's successor;
 clashed with Mao in 1969-1970, apparently planned a coup against Mao in 1971, was killed
 in a plane crash in Mongolia in September 1971 while fleeing from his imminent purge.

 Of these figures, Hua Kuo-feng is the nearest thing
 to a designated successor, named as Senior Vice-
 Chairman, the man in whom Mao in recent months
 has publicly and privately expressed the greatest
 confidence. He has been observed to have a close and
 warm personal relationship with Mao, and has one
 advantage none of the others has: he speaks Mao's
 language, Mao's native Hunanese,* Wang Tung-
 hsing has been the leader physically closest to Mao
 since about 1950, virtually a constant companion,
 even accompanying Mao on his travels (which
 Madame Mao does not); while Wang cannot
 Wang seems to be completely identified with Mao, to
 want what Mao wants; although Wang may turn out
 to have a mind of his own, a mind already busy
 making calculations as to what "factional" group in
 the leadership it would be most advantageous to
 himself to support, the presumption has to be that
 Wang is now a supporter of Mao's clearly-marked
 favorite, Hua.
 In sum, at all stages of Mao's hypothetical
 deterioration, it seems likely that Hua Kuo-feng,
 reinforced by Wang Tung-hsing, will have the greatest
 access to Mao and the greatest influence with him,
 and will be in the best position of any leader to act-or
 try to act-in Mao's name.
 Nevertheless, so long as Mao retains the loyalty of
 the physical and political security apparatuses, he can
 probably continue to make whatever changes he likes
 in the Party leadership, and some of those with access
 to him may be attempting to manipulate him into
 making some.
 It is not hard to imagine the passed-over and
 demoted Leftists endeavoring to persuade Mao that
 the realization of his revolutionary objectives can be
 accomplished only if the helm is in their hands.
 Neither is it hard to imagine the Centrist and
 Rightist leaders with access to Mao trying to bring
 Mao to believe that the Leftists still have too much
 potential for disruption, and should be deprived of
 *Hua is a native of Shansi in North China, but served for more
 than 20 years as a Party secretary in Hunan before Mao brought him
 to Peking in 1971.
 those important organizational posts which they still
 have.
 It is further possible that Hua Kuo-feng, now in line
 to succeed Mao, recognizing the importance of having
 a blindly loyal security chief and having doubts as to
 whether Wang Tung-hsing would give to him
 anything like the loyalty that Wang has given Mao,
 will attempt to transfer more and more of the overall
 security account into his own (Hug's) hands before
 Mao's death. Hua may regard some one of his own
 lieutenants as having precisely the qualities he requires
 in a security chief.
 The possibilities for exercising influence-' undue'
 influence-on Mao are of course many, too many to
 enumerate. On balance, one concludes that Hua will
 be able to survive as the most important figure after
 Mao himself, and that he will have Wang's support as
 Mao would wish, although one cannot count on it.*
 THREE DRAMATIC POSSIBILITIES
 There are some dramatic and highly disruptive
 contingencies that could occur on Mao's death. The
 most important of these are a coup employing military
 and security forces of the Peking MR, military
 intervention by some of the leaders of the 10 MRs
 outside Peking, and a Soviet attack on China. An
 attempted coup is a serious possibility; the other two
 seem most unlikely except in the event of a coup.
 An Attempted Coup: The possibility of a coup has
 to be taken seriously, because of the sharp differences
 among various leaders and because there. are forces in
 Peking which could probably bring off a coup, at least
 initially. The passed-over and unpopular Leftists,
 fearful about their futures, or Rightist military leaders,
 fearful of the Leftists, might conspire with the most
 important  figures  of the physical security
 apparatus-the leaders of the Peking MR and of the
 smaller inner-core forces--to seize their opponents and
 even the Centrist figures like Hua Kuo-feng who have
 kept the balance. The three key physical security
 figures, acting just by themselves, could probably carry
 *One obvious complicating factor, if Mao's deterioration is
 prolonged, is the credibility problem. That is, in the nature of the
 case it seems likely that the dwindling few like Hua and Wang who
 have access to Mao will have increasing difficulty in persuading the
 many who do not have access that (a) the outsiders are being told the
 full truth about Mao's instructions, and that (b) Mao is in any
 condition to formulate instructions which deserve respect and
 obedience.

 out a successful coup. The question of whether there
 will be an attempted coup at the time of Mao's death
 (no real possibility is seen before that time) is
 sometimes put in the form of: Who will be the first to
 learn of Mao's death? Who, that is, might have private
 knowledge of the death even for an hour or two, and
 might thereby be in a position to issue orders in Mao's
 name which would be accepted as proceeding from
 Mao and would be acted on?
 There seem only limited gains to be made by being
 the `first to know' of Mao's death, if indeed there is
 any `first.' The circumstances of Mao's last days may
 be such that other key figures, operating in teams, will
 be able to keep vigil around the clock, as is said to have
 been the case in the death of Stalin, in order to keep
 any one of them from having private knowledge. Even
 on the assumptions that this is not done and that
 Wang Tung-hsing himself is not on the scene, the
 bodyguard forces protecting Mao (as the Soviet police
 were protecting Stalin) could be expected to report at
 once to Wang.
 There is a hypothetical possibility that Wang, acting
 on his own or in concert with some principal to whom
 he had secretly pledged allegiance, could move
 swiftly-using only the forces responsive to
 himself-to effect the arrest of certain other Party
 leaders before the remaining leaders were even awake.
 But this scenario looks implausible. Wang's security
 forces would have to be perfectly responsive to him:
 that is, each of his deputies ordered to arrest one of the
 top leaders of the Party (and, necessarily, his entire
 family, and household staff, in order to keep the fact
 from being made known to other top figures) would
 have to be willing to take such extreme action without
 attempting to verify that the order did in fact come
 from Mao, and all of the blocks of arrests would have
 to be perfectly coordinated, carried out at the same
 moment at several different points in Peking, also in
 order to preserve secrecy and prevent the mobilization
 of stronger military forces by other leaders. *
 * In this connection, the failure of those who attempted the coup
 in Indonesia in 1965 to capture just one of the several key military
 leaders, on the eve of the coup, is instructive. Although all of the
 other key generals were successfully taken, the escape of just
 one-thus enabling the army to rally-was an important factor in
 the failure of the coup, ending with the capture and execution of the
 conspirators and the destruction of the Indonesian Communist
 Party. See "Indonesia 1965-The Coup that Backfired," December
 1968.
 One version of this scenario is that Wang and
 Madame Mao might act together (with Madame Mao
 informing Wang if she were the first to know), on
 behalf of the "Shanghai group''-the Leftists-with
 which she is affiliated. This presumes that Madame
 Mao has persuaded Wang, contrary to the visible
 evidence, that it was Mao's will to have these true
 "revolutionary successors" in fact succeed him.
 A somewhat more plausible form of a coup-more
 plausible than simultaneous arrests throughout
 Peking-would be one in which all of the top leaders
 are summoned to the deathbed of a dying or
 (unbeknownst to them) already dead Mao, at which
 time one faction is arrested by Wang's small security
 force on the scene, on behalf of some other faction. But
 it seems likely that those summoned would have
 alerted others, so that this could not be carried out in
 secret.
 In any case, there is the entire question of the
 morning after. Even if Wang and his principals were
 prepared to arrest and confine a number of the other
 top leaders (an action which might set loose all of the
 powerful forces in China making for instability and
 insurrection), they would have to have the cooperation
 or assent of other military forces in the Peking area,
 especially the main-force armies of the Peking MR;
 otherwise, the coup could be quickly reversed. And
 even if they did have the military's cooperation or
 assent, the military would be in a position to dominate
 the leadership emerging from the coup.* It is hard to
 believe that any of the civilian leaders-Left or
 Right-would willingly arrange  what would be in
 effect a military dictatorship.
 Those in the best position to carry out a coup would
 seem to be the three most important figures of the
 physical security apparatus acting together-Wang
 Tung-hsing at the inner core and Chen Hsi-lien and
 Chi Teng-kuei, respectively Commander and 1st
 Political Officer of the Peking MR, to whom the main-
 force armies of the MR would probably be responsive,
 at least initially. (See photograph.) These three, each
 of them perhaps acting in the belief that he would not
 otherwise hold high position in the post-Mao 25X1
 leadership

 (or even in the belief that he would

 otherwise be purged as a danger to other leaders), by
 acting together could probably easily dispose of the
 four principal Leftists, who do not command either
 regular or security forces. Wang, Chen, and Chi could
 probably p:revail against Hua Kuo-feng too, or against
 any other group,
 However, this hypothetical troika would also have
 to face the problem of the morning after, justifying
 their actions to the military forces they had employed
 in the coup and to military forces throughout China.
 They might be sufficiently persuasive to prevent a
 successful armed rebellion against themselves (another
 way in which a military dictatorship could come to
 power)-which is the reason for regarding a coup as
 more than a marginal possibility. But a coup even by
 these three key figures would seem to carry a high risk
 of splitting the military forces of the Peking MR,
 leading to armed clashes among elements of them, in
 turn risking the spread of armed conflict throughout
 China to a state of anarchy or civil war. This situation
 would carry the greatest risk of Soviet intervention, in
 the form of support of selected elements of the armed
 forces or of an outright Soviet attack. Those who are in
 the best position to carry out a coup-each of whom is
 on record as hard-line anti-Soviet-would probably be
 unwilling to accept such risks.
 Revolt oar the Regional Leaders: There has long been
 speculation that the MR leaders-often called the
 powerful MR leaders-might forcibly intervene in the
 succession process. Such speculation has perhaps been
 strengthened by the consideration that, of the several
 MR commanders who seemed to be-or possibly to
 be-in some degree of political trouble as of early 1975
 (at least one or two of whom seemed likely not to
 survive their prolonged examinations), not one has yet
 fallen*-as if Mao and. other leaders were afraid to
 move against any of them or were being blocked by
 central military leaders. (See map, facing.)
 It still seems to be the case, however, that the MR
 leaders are not very powerful outside of their military
 regions (and can be bypassed even within them). The
 purge of several of them in the Lin Piao affair, the
 mass transfer of MR commanders in 1973, the
 replacement of several career military men by career
 Party cadres in political officer posts, the removal of
 MR commanders from their most important political

 (and probably of main-force armies, although these
 changes are riot announced)-these and other actions
 have combined to return the MR leaders to what
 appear to be the subordinate positions which they had
 accepted without serious challenge in the years before
 the Cultural Revolution and continued to accept
 during the Cultural Revolution.
 The MR leaders outside Peking still do not appear to
 constitute a unified, purposive group. No single MR
 outside Peking could possibly conduct a successful
 offensive against the capital with its own resources. It
 would be very difficult (although not impossible) for
 the leaders of a group of MRs to conspire successfully,
 and equally difficult-owing to the controls all along
 the line-for them to bring their forces into action.
 There is still the marginal possibility of the use of
 bombers or missiles located in the various MRs being
 used against Peking. But the probability remains that
 the command-and-control system is secure, and it is
 hard to see `.Show such weapons could be employed
 effectively in any case.
 There also' remains the possibility of Soviet material
 support for a key MR (e.g., Shenyang) or a group of
 MRs, giving. those forces the capability for sustained
 operations which they do not now have, but this does
 not seem a serious possibility unless armed conflict in
 Peking itself spreads throughout China to a situation
 approaching that of civil war, and some elements of
 the contending forces make known to Moscow that
 they support a reconciliation with the USSR.
 Further, having come through the public
 demonstrations that surrounded the mass mourning for
 Chou En-lai and the changes in the leadership (at
 which time every MR lined up to proclaim its support
 of the changes), the central leadership is not likely to
 let any political campaign-e,g., the continuing anti-
 Teng campaign-get so out of control as to make it
 necessary to return the military to political power
 throughout China. Neither is Peking likely to alarm
 the MR leaders by threatening a large-scale purge of
 them.
 It still seems true that only the leaders of the Peking
 MR (discussed above in connection with a possible
 coup) have substantial capability to affect the shape of
 the succession, either by making their weight
 felt-without actual intervention-on the side of a
 contender or group of contenders or by sending their
 forces into action. To do the latter would, as noted
 above, incur substantial risk.
 Thus it still seems true, as it did in early 1975,* that
 the best course for the regional leaders in the period in
 which the succession is being shaped, and the course
 which most if not all of them are likely to follow, is to
 be passive, accepting whatever arrangements are
 worked out in Peking (just as they did in April). If they
 do refrain from attempting to interfere (simply voting
 or counselling as individuals when invited to do so),
 they are likely to continue to be substantially
 represented in the new Politburo, to have greater
 influence in the Politburo than they have thus far had,
 and, in most cases, to retain their present posts and
 powers-a better situation, in many respects, than to
 be caught up in the hazardous infighting in Peking.
 A Soviet Military Attack: Some observers have long
 believed that a Soviet attack on China at the time of
 Mao's death is a strong possibility, a possibility
 presumably enhanced by the Soviet observation in
 recent months that the leadership has failed to
 maintain its "unity and stability" and by the sound
 conclusion that it will not magically become unified
 by Mao's death. There is evidence that the Chinese
 themselves genuinely fear the possibility of a Soviet
 attack at that time.
 A case can be made for it: essentially, that the
 Russians have believed for years that the largest
 reservoir of pro-Soviet sentiment (or perhaps more
 precisely, of the least strong anti-Soviet sentiment) is to
 be found in the Chinese military; that some Chinese
 military leaders may intervene in the succession
 process in order to prevent the accession to power of
 the Leftist (and most anti-Soviet) group; and that
 those leaders would be willing to undertake joint
 operations with Soviet forces. In this connection, a
 possibly disaffected military leader, Li Te-sheng,
 removed from his post as a Vice-Chairman of the Party
 in January 1975 and severely criticized before and
 after, is still the Commander of the Shenyang MR, the
 Northeast area through which a Soviet ground attack
 would presumably come (as it did in 1945, against
 Japanese forces there), With or without Li Te-sheng
 (who is still a Politburo member, and would probably

 not care to exchange his high position for permanent
 status as a traitor, another Lin Piao), there is no doubt
 that Soviet forces could drive deep into the Northeast
 and force the Chinese back into their last recourse of
 "people's war."
 In 1969, when the level of Chinese provocation on
 the Sino-Soviet border was high, the Russians did
 indeed encourage, both publicly and privately, the
 view that they might attack China, by a nuclear strike
 or conventional means or both, and the Chinese were
 clearly alarmed by this. Moreover, in the years since,
 Soviet spokesmen have occasionally indicated that
 present Soviet policy toward China is the "softest"
 possible, that there are forces in the Soviet leadership
 which favor a much harsher policy, forces held in
 check by Brezhnev's sober coalition. But since 1969 the
 Chinese generally have refrained from military
 provocation, and the Russians have repeatedly
 disclaimed, again both publicly and privately, any
 intention to strike the Chinese in the absence of such
 provocation. It seems virtually certain that, at the time
 of the succession, the Chinese (who showed their
 alertness to the problem during the leadership changes
 in April) will take care not to offer any military
 provocation to the USSR, any case for the "hawks" in
 the Soviet leadership (who probably really do exist,
 and who probably do figure in Chinese calculations).
 The Soviet disclaimers can probably be accepted.
 There are sound military and political reasons for not
 attacking China at any time: e.g., the probability of
 bogging down huge forces for years in a land action,
 the stigma of first use of nuclear weapons and the
 inability of such weapons to distinguish between
 friends and enemies, the Chinese capability of a
 (limited) nuclear counter-strike, the impossibility of
 successful occupation of China for a prolonged period,
 the importance of not "freezing" Chinese hostility for
 decades or centuries to come, and so on.
 There are additional reasons for not intervening at
 the time of the succession: the possibility that a Soviet
 attack, far from increasing whatever disunity existed in
 the Chinese leadership, would draw the Chinese
 leaders together to act against what they would see as
 the worst of all situations, subordination to the USSR;
 their own ignorance of the Chinese leadership, their
 lack of evidence as to which Chinese leaders-the anti-
 Mao "patriots" they have spoken of-they might
 effectively intervene on behalf of (they seem genuinely
 not to know which of the current leaders, if elevated to
 supreme power by Soviet arms, might turn out to be
 reliably pro-Soviet-in the qualified sense that, say,
 Peng Te-huai was); and the lack of assurance, even if
 they see some combination of central and regional
 military leaders rising up against the civilian leaders at
 the time of the succession, that the group would be
 able to survive or if in power would be pro-Soviet. *
 As previously suggested, a state of civil war in China
 might seriously tempt the USSR to extend support to
 the most promising contenders, and this argument
 holds for the possibility of a Soviet attack as well. A
 Soviet attack seems most likely-that is, least
 unlikely-if military as well as political power is
 fragmented throughout China, so that Soviet military
 intervention would not appear so nakedly to be
 undertaken against "China." One good reason for
 regarding the possibility of a Soviet attack as marginal
 is that there seems only a marginal possibility that the
 Chinese leadership-however disunited and
 contentious-will allow the situation to deteriorate to
 a condition of civil war.
 Beyond this, the strongest reason for refraining from
 military intervention is that, with Mao's death, the
 Russians will have a qualitatively new situation to
 exploit, without incurring any stigma or risk. Their
 most implacable enemy will have departed, and the
 successor group is bound to feel insecure, more
 vulnerable to Soviet political initiatives. There are
 surely advantages to the Russians in reducing Chinese
 hostility if possible. The sensible course for the
 Russians, and the one that they are expected to follow,
 before, during, and at least for a time after the
 succession, will be to talk, not fight.
 No Commanding Figure or Faction: Assuming,
 then, that the three key figures of the physical security
 apparatus do not attempt a coup in the hours
 surrounding Mao's death, that there is no revolt by the
 MR leaders, and that there is no Soviet attack, Mao's
 successors-even if they have been working reasonably
 well as a "collective" during the period of Mao's

 deterioration-will still face a serious problem in
 distributing power among themselves in the
 immediate post-Mao period.
 First, will there be any single commanding figure?
 That is, is there any one of the successors to whom the
 others would "naturally" be expected to turn for
 leadership?
 If Chou En-lai were still alive and well, Chou would
 probably be that man, for most of the leadership (all
 but the hard Leftists); and, if he had lasted, Teng
 Hsiao-ping might conceivably have been in Chou's
 position. In their absence, no one seems to stand out,
 as having been a national-level leader for many years,
 as commanding great respect for his demonstrated
 achievements over the range of a leader's concern, and
 as being at the same time vigorous and vital,
 projecting the image of the new China.
 It is easier to eliminate candidates than to choose
 one. Of the current Vice-Chairmen, Wang Hung-wen
 is too young and unproven, leaving Hua Kuo-feng (the
 present First Vice-Chairman) and Yeh Chien-ying,
 who, although old and infirm and almost entirely a
 military man, can be regarded as a marginal candidate
 owing to his general popularity and to his prestige as
 the last of the Old Guard still active in the inner circle.
 (See photograph.) Of the other Leftists (besides
 Wang), Chiang Ching is female and is probably
 disliked by most other Party leaders, and Yao Wen-
 yuan is both young and unpopular and has been only
 a propagandist, leaving only Chang Chun-chiao of
 this group. Of the other Rightists (besides Yeh), Li
 Hsien-nien is also old and infirm, and Chiao Kuan-
 hua has not really been a leader, simply a specialist in
 foreign affairs-leaving only Yeh in this group. Of the
 other Centrists (besides Hua), Chi Teng-kuei is
 probably not well enough known, and Wu Te has not
 indicated a capacity for much greater responsibility
 than his present role in managing the affairs of the
 Peking municipality-leaving only Hua Kuo-feng as
 above. Of the two unclassifiable or "wild card"
 leaders, Wang Tung-hsing has been a very narrow
 security specialist, leaving only Chen Hsi-lien, a career
 military man, of this group, *
 *"Wild card" is a term used herein for a leader whose record does
 not permit him to be classified with any confidence as Left, Center,
 or Right, but whose power is such that his support would be of great
 value to the classifiable leaders who in general seem to be better
 candidates for the top Party posts.
 Of these four putative candidates-Hua, Yeh,
 Chang, and Chen, in order of current rank-to assume
 the Chairmanship immediately upon or very soon after
 Mao's death, assuming that Party leaders feel a need
 for another Chairman so soon, Hua Kuo-feng would
 seem to have the best chance. This conclusion rests on
 a judgment that most of Mao's successors, in the
 immediate post-Mao period, would find it easier to
 group temporarily around Mao's own choice as his
 principal successor than they would around anyone
 else, that Hua is better-qualified than Yeh, and that
 there would be less objection to the smooth, pleasant
 Hua than to either Chang or Chen.*
 *The Party Constitution does not provide for a First Vice-
 Chairman (a post which did not exist when it was written) to succeed
 to the Chairmanship automatically. It specifies instead that a
 plenary session of the Central Committee must elect the Chairman
 and other Party officers. But a decision by the "Central Committee"
 can be made very rapidly if necessary-as witness Hua's own
 appointment within two days of the Tienanmen rioting. Presumably
 the matter would come to a vote in the Politburo. In an honest (i.e.,
 uncoerced) balloting, the four demonstrable Leftists would
 constitute a small minority of the 16 full (voting) members, almost
 certainly unable to attract enough supporters from the other 12 to
 put their own man in the Chairmanship. In the unlikely event that
 both of the "wild cards" could be played by the Leftists-a credible
 threat of coordinated intervention on their behalf by military and
 security forces-sufficient "votes" might follow. In any event, the
 immediate distribution of power seems likely to depend heavily on
 the perception of the voters as to which contenders for high position
 have what degree of military/security support.

 Actually there seems a fair possibility that the Party
 will retire the post of Chairman. Mao has made even
 the post so awesome, the very word "Chairman" so
 inseparable from himself at the national level, that it
 may be retired out of respect for him. If so, presumably
 all of the Vice-Chairmanships would disappearat the
 same time, leaving Hua Kuo-feng with only the
 Premier's post and putting him on a collision course
 with Chang Chun-chiao for the Secretary-General's
 post, which would then be the Party's most important
 position.
 There seems a stronger possibility that the Party will
 operate for a. time, perhaps a prolonged period,
 without a Chairman, because, for the above reasons,
 no Party leader would feel comfortable in the post; but
 that the post itself will not be retired.* Hua could
 presumably remain First Vice-Chairman under such
 circumstances, and the de facto leader of the Party,
 much as the Military Affairs Committee (MAC) for
 years has been run by its senior Vice-Chairman. There
 would seem at a minimum a need for some one leader
 to be recognized as the senior figure, the man to
 convene the meetings (e.g., Politburo Standing
 Committee) necessary to convene other Party meetings
 (full Politburo, expanded Politburo, Central

 "Chairman" by redesignating the topmost post as that of General
 Secretary or First Secretary, but that would eliminate the post of

 Committee) in turn necessary to work out the
 distribution of power and to put the Central
 Committee's seal of approval on it, even if that man
 could not expect-as he could not-to dominate such
 meetings. To recognize the designated First Vice-
 Chairman, Hua, as that man would seem the least
 disruptive course.
 It would seem to make the best sense to name a new
 Chairman, after a suitable period of mourning in
 which Hua is recognized as the de facto Chairman.
 The Chairman's post would then be balanced by the
 Secretary-General's post, permitting both Hua and
 Chang to occupy key Party posts and thus allowing
 them to divide the power. Whatever the arrangement,
 no individual-Hua, Chang, or whoever-would be
 able to dominate the Party as Mao had.
 If there is no single commanding figure, neither does
 there seem to be the prospect of any one commanding
 faction.
 The Leftists do not appear to have the
 organizational strength. Chang Chun-chiao is the
 strongest figure in that group, but in recent years the
 Secretary-General's post has not seemed to be anything
 like as powerful as it once was (under Teng Hsiao-
 ping) and Chang does not seem to have a firm grip on
 the General Political Department (GPD), a grip
 maintained through his own proteges which would

 ensure its obedience to him in a Party crisis.* Wang
 Hung-wen may still be a Vice-Chairman of the MAC
 (as well as of the Party), but can act only with the
 consent of other MAC officers. Madame Mao has no
 power apart from Mao, and is simply a name to be
 exploited. Yao Wen-yuan has only some part of the
 propaganda apparatus, the equivalent of the old
 Propaganda Department. (See photograph.) In sum,
 the only way in which this group could take power
 would be in an alliance with opportunistic military
 leaders, who, first, would seem to have no good reason
 to ally with them, and, second, would dominate any
 such alliance (just as they would in a coup). It would
 not be surprising to see some members of this Leftist
 group excluded from the leadership after Mao's
 death. **
 The strength of the Rightists is probably
 concentrated in the military leaders-demonstrably in
 Yoh Chien-ying, who although old. and ailing will
 FOUR STRONG MEN: Chang Chun-chiao, Wang
 Tung-hsing, Hua Kuo-feng, Chen Hsi-lien
 probably be a key figure in the immediate post-Mao
 period, much as he was used to rally the military in the
 Lin Piao affair; and just possibly in Chen Hsi-lien,
 whose background and associations would seem to
 place him with the Rightists but who probably has to
 be regarded as Unclassified, i.e., as a "wild card" who
 might play himself in support of another leader at
 almost any point in the spectrum. The good will of the
 military will be extremely important to the non-
 military leaders, some of whom may be able to play
 military cards, but they will probably seek to avoid
 bringing the military into military action (the cards
 can be played simply by being shown in Politburo
 voting, or perhaps even by bluffing, by making a
 credible claim of support by military and security
 elements not directly represented in the Politburo
 meetings). While an effort by the military itself to
 impose a military dictatorship is of course conceivable,
 any military intervention seems more likely to be on
 behalf of whatever group of leaders whom the
 military-meaning that portion of the military in a
 position to intervene-believes to be best-disposed
 toward themselves. On the record, this group would
 certainly seem to be some combination of the Center
 and the Right, not the Left.*
 The strength of the Centrists is spread throughout
 the Party apparatus, the government machinery, and
 the security forces. But the group does not include
 military leaders in the sense of career military men,
 unless the "wild card" Chen Hsi-lien has already
 pledged his allegiance to it. This group appears to be
 in the same position vis-a-vis the military as the
 military are toward it: that is, they seem to need each
 other, neither as a group has both the military strength
 and the managerial skills to enable it to dominate and
 govern by itself.
 The two Unclassified or "wild card" leaders, Chen
 Hsi-lien and Wang Tung-hsing, constitute a
 significant group with just the two of them, by virtue
 of their control of military and security forces which
 can take swift action in crises. But they do not make a
 strong enough pair to dominate, by themselves, the

 militia would be no match for the PLA.

 post-Mao situation; they too would have to act in
 combination with key figures of other groups. * If both
 Chen and Wang are truly "wild cards," acting
 purposively together they would be a formidable
 combination, perhaps able to be the "king-makers" for
 any group of contenders of their choice; and
 separately, working for different contending groups,
 they might plunge the leadership into chaos.
 Unfortunately, there is no solid information on the
 state of their relationships with each other or with any
 other Party leader except Mao himself.**
 There.seems only one sense in which the immediate
 post-Mao leadership can be regarded as likely to be
 dominated by a small group. This would be some
 combination of the strongest figures of the Center,
 Left, Right, and Unclassified: namely, Hua Kuo-feng
 and Chi Teng-kuei of the Center; Chang Chun-chiao
 of the Left; Yeh Chien-ying of the Right; and Chen
 Hsi-lien and Wang Tung-hsing of the "wild cards."
 Most observers would add a seventh figure, Wang
 Hung-wen of the Left, and some would substitute or
 add another, the PLA's Chief-of-Staff when one is
 named, a probable Rightist (like the present acting
 chief).
 Further, little is known of the personal character of
 these conjectured key figures. The distribution of
 power would seem to depend heavily upon this factor
 as well as upon perceptions of one another's strengths:
 specifically, whether all or most of them would prove
 able to subordinate their serious differences with
 others, and their personal ambitions, to the general
 good, the appearance of stability and of national
 purpose. Perhaps they will prove unable to do so, even
 temporarily. On balance, however, it seems likely that
 most of the key figures, acting from a sense of national
 interest, will be able to agree upon some form of
 "collective" leadership, one which, at least for a time,
 will conceal the extent of their differences and the
 degree of tension among them.
 A Possible Equitable Distribution: There are serious
 observers of the Chinese scene who contend that any
 *Wang might be sub-classified as a very special kind of card, one
 permanently affixed to the Mao-card and to be discarded with it.

 Mao's man.
 speculation as to the shape of the post-Mao leadership
 is simply a waste of time, as too little can be set forth
 with sufficient confidence to be of value to the reader.
 Nevertheless, the effort must be made, if only because
 some constellations seem more likely than others.
 It has already been conceded that there are several
 serious contingencies in any assessment of the post-
 Mao situation: e.g., (a) that Mao will change his mind
 again and will once more upset the arrangements for
 the succession which he has made (this was always the
 principal contingency in calculating Teng Hsiao-
 ping's status, and, in the event, was the main factor);
 (b) that there will be a successful coup, perhaps led by
 key figures of the physical security apparatus; (c) that
 any such coup will be overturned by some
 combination of military forces in the Peking area,
 resulting in a de facto military dictatorship or armed
 conflict; (d) that main-force armies in other military
 regions will revolt against the national leadership (or
 lack of it) and plunge China into something like a civil
 war; (e) that the USSR will intervene, either in the
 form of supporting certain Chinese military forces or in
 the form of an attack on China by Soviet forces; and
 (f) that Chinese leaders are so divided and hostile that
 they will not care about an appearance of stability and
 will immediately engage in an all-out struggle for
 power upon Mao's death.
 If each of those six contingencies is arbitrarily
 assigned some substantial chance of coming to pass
 (the first three the highest, the other three the lowest),
 then the odds might already be almost even that some
 one of them will occur (even if the particular
 one cannot be foreseen), and the odds may therefore
 not be much better than even that anything very
 useful can be said about the shape of the post-Mao
 leadership in terms of particular leaders. If other, more
 remote contingencies are added (e.g., the assassination
 of Mao by a member of his personal staff or medical
 team, the sudden death of one or more of the principal
 actors in the succession, a Soviet attack or a Sino-
 Soviet reconciliation before Mao's departure, the
 revolt of the masses throughout China), then the odds
 might fall to less than even. So it seems best to offer a
 brief conjecture, to emphasize that this conjecture is
 highly conjectural, and to warn earnestly against
 betting heavily on it as a probable outcome.

 Hua becomes both Party Chairman and MAC
 Chairman (thus ranking Chang in the two most
 important hierarchies).
 -Chi Teng-kuei as Premier if Hua is both Party
 Chairman and MAC Chairman and wishes to
 prevent-and has enough support to prevent-
 Chang Chun-chiao from being both Premier and
 Secretary-General, or if in the absence of a
 Chairmanship Chang loses the contention for the
 Secretary-General's post and is not offered the post
 of Premier; and Chi in any case to have the
 responsibility  for supervising the  Party's
 organizational work,  probably remaining First
 Political Officer of the Peking MR as well.
 -Wang Tung-hsing to continue as the director of
 the Party's central political security department and
 of the Central Committee's General Office, inter
 alia continuing to supervise the security forces that
 protect the Party leaders.
 -Chiao Kuan-hua, the Chou En-lai protege who
 is clearly the best-qualified man for the job, to
 continue as Foreign Minister.
 Some such arrangements would provide the
 smoothest possible transition from the currently-
 existing situation and, on the assumption that Hua
 and Chang are not forced to compete for the Secretary-
 General's post, would reduce the possibility that any
 one of the seriously disruptive scenarios will in fact
 occur.  Secondary arrangements might reasonably
 include:
 -The naming of most of the above-cited primary
 leaders below Hua's level as Vice-Chairmen of the
 Party and as the core of the Politburo's Standing
 Committee and the naming of at least one of the
 three lesser Leftists (Wang Hung-wen, Madame
 Mao, Yao Wen-yuan) to the Standing Committee as
 well;
 -And the confirmation (re-election) of most
 members of the current Politburo, moving up one or
 two of the alternates who symbolize important
 groups (women, minorities, labor), adding a few key
 figures. from the many to choose among in the
 structures of power and the governmental
 machinery (e.g., a new Chief-of-Staff, a new
 Minister of Public Security, the head of the State
 Planning Commission, two or three promising
 provincial-level figures such as half of the above-
 named leaders themselves were until the 1970s).
 The contingencies which probably deserve
 emphasis, in offering one of these configurations as a
 moderately credible one for the immediate post-Mao
 period, seem to be the following:
 -That Mao before he dies will choose to do and
 will prove able to do what he pointedly did not do in
 naming Hua Kuo-feng First Vice-Chairman and
 Premier, i.e., to strengthen the Left organizationally
 at the expense of the Center and Right, in which
 case we might see Chang Chun-chiao in a position
 to be installed as Party Chairman (or as Secretary-
 General in the absence of a Chairman) with the
 support of leftist or opportunist military leaders,
 with Wang Hung-wen moved up to become the
 Party's Secretary-General and with both Madame
 Mao and Yao Wen-yuan added to the Politburo's
 Standing Committee, and Hua Kuo-feng being only
 the Premier (if that);
 -That Chen Hsi-lien will be perceived by other
 leaders, either before or after Mao's death, as
 potentially too powerful and ambitious, and that
 arrangements will be made to ease him out, in favor
 of some other military leader who would not have a
 strong personal following in the Peking MR and
 would be perceived as more docile;
 -That Wang Tung-hsing will similarly be
 regarded by other leaders as potentially too
 dangerous to all of them, with his control of the
 most sensitive personnel records (including records
 of positions taken at Party meetings) and his control
 of the bodyguard forces which constitute the
 innermost ring of security, that some part of the
 security apparatus will be successfully used against
 Wang in somewhat the same way that Beriya was
 taken, and that Hua (or whoever) will be able to
 place his own man (as Mao has done for so long) in
 the critically important post of director of the
 political security apparatus; and
 -That Wang Hung-wen (who has probably
 made himself an adversary of the military) will be
 seen by other leaders as thinking of himself as
 "another Mao," and that they will act together
 against him, excluding him entirely from the
 leadership.

 But none of these possibilities seems strong enough
 to shake the judgment that one of the configurations
 outlined earlier is the best possibility for the general
 shape of the immediate post-Mao leadership.
 If that is a more-or-less accurate picture, then, this
 would be a "collective" dominated in fact by a
 coalition of career Party cadres and career military
 men, in which the strongest single figure would be the
 Centrist Hua Kuo-feng, although he could not
 dominate the Party in anything like the way that Mao
 had done. Next in importance would probably be the
 non-extreme Leftist Chang Chun-chiao, and after that
 the military leaders Yeh and Chen, one a Rightist, one
 a "wild card" backing the Center. At the next level of
 power would be the Centrist Chi Teng-kuei and the
 "wild card" Wang Tung-hsing, the latter probably,
 like Chen Hsi-lien, backing the Center. The center line
 in this constellation, which would dominate the
 Politburo Standing Committee and would probably be
 replicated (with some rearrangement) in the MAC,
 would run in fact directly through the Center of the
 Chinese political spectrum as now perceived-
 "moderate" in Chinese terms, although still more
 "revolutionary" than, say, the leadership of the
 Communist Party of the Soviet Union. But one must
 reiterate another caveat here: while some such
 arrangement might hold for the immediate post-Mao
 period, it seems probable-owing to personal
 ambition, irreconcilable differences on policy, and the
 unpredictability of the "wild cards''-that it would
 prove unstable over the longer run.
 THREE INESCAPABLE POLICY-QUESTIONS
 of conspirators and more recently used privately by
 Chinese officials in the wake of Chou En-lai's death
 and Teng Hsiao-ping's purge: for tyranny instead of
 leadership, for placing himself above the Party, for
 egomania, for refusal to share power and for blaming
 others for his own mistakes, for falsifying history to
 protect himself, for treachery to faithful lieutenants,
 for the doctrinaire pursuit of illusory goals at immense
 human cost, for indifference to the welfare of the
 masses, and so on.
 But most members of the inner circle of the
 successors will owe their rise to high position to Mao's
 campaigns of the past decade, and most in fact to
 Mao's personal selection of them for preferment, and
 they cannot degrade him or his "thought" in the
 immediate post-Mao period without undermining
 themselves while they are still insecure. Despite their
 own mixed feelings, and the temptation to exploit the
 negative feelings about Mao that are now probably
 widespread in the Party and even in the "masses" that
 have been his constituency (Lin Piao had a good case,
 and there has been a marked increase in the
 willingness of Chinese, both officials and common
 men, to express anti-Mao sentiment in the past year,
 most strikingly in the Tienanmen rioting), it seems
 likely that most of the successors would agree that
 continuity must be maintained. The Leftists would
 certainly so contend, as otherwise they would have no
 legitimacy at all, The Centrists and Rightists might
 rejoice in the downfall of the Leftists, but they already
 have a stronger organizational position than do the
 Leftists (an advantage given them by Mao himself, as
 everyone is aware), and they do not need to discredit
 Mao in order to keep this advantage and if necessary
 to use it.
 A Centrist leadership of this kind would be expected
 to take Centrist positions on three inescapable policy-
 questions:  the group's relationship to Mao's
 "thought," the concept of "rehabilitation," and the
 Sino-Soviet-American triangle.
 The Relationship to Mao's "Thought": Mao's
 successors must immediately define in some fashion
 their relationship with the 40-plus years of Mao's
 leadership of the Party, the dominance of his person
 and his "thought."
 The successors have the option, of course, of
 denouncing and disowning Mao, in roughly the terms
 of the "571" document attributed to Lin Piao's group
 On the other hand, it seems most improbable that
 any individual or any single group of Mao's successors
 will be allowed to present himself or herself or
 themselves as the guardian or guardians of Mao's
 "thought." Among the current leaders, only Wang
 Hung-wen and Madame Mao seem conceivably to be
 inexperienced or simple-minded enough to try to do
 this, an effort which if undertaken would surely fail,
 whether in Party councils or in an appeal to the
 "masses." Probably neither will do so, but other
 leaders may nevertheless choose to get rid of
 both-judging (as noted above) that Wang does
 indeed think of himself as "another Mao" and that the

 very unpopular Madame Mao is not necessary for the
 preservation of continuity.
 Mao's posthumous immunity may not extend to
 some of his "socialist new things"-e.g., the mass
 study of Marxism-Leninism-Mao Thought (in which
 the Party and populace have been saturated for years),
 the three-in-one combination in which old, middle-
 aged and young people are given theoretically equal
 representation in leadership organs, the assignment of
 millions of cadres to "May 7th" schools for productive
 labor and reindoctrination, the creation and
 popularization of (Madame Mao's) "revolutionary"
 plays, the ?'open door" management of universities
 (e.g., admission only after at least two years of labor,
 continued labor while studying, direction by worker-
 peasant-soldier propaganda teams), and the dispatch
 of the great majority of educated youth-more than 12
 million so far-to the countryside to settle perma-
 nently. These policies are all controversial, and some
 will probably be modified, but it would seem that this
 could be done at a deliberate pace, without attacking
 either the "thought" embodied in the policies or the
 man himself.
 In sum, Mao is of course vulnerable, and some
 degrading of him in his Stalinist role will probably take
 place sooner or later-perhaps within a three-year
 period corresponding to that between Stalin's death
 and Khrushchev's "secret" speech. But this will
 probably not occur in the immediate post-Mao period.
 "Rehabilitation" or Reversal: A potentially highly
 disruptive issue, for the successors, is that of the
 "rehabilitation"-now an accomplished fact, but one
 which could be reversed-of thousands of Party
 cadres, government functionaries, and military leaders
 brought down in the Cultural Revolution, hundreds of
 whom are probably now in important positions again
 (including one member of the Politburo). Although
 this has been Mao's own policy since 1967, the year
 after the great purges began, an attempt to reverse it
 could be linked to a defense of the Cultural Revolution
 itself.
 The link has in fact already been made, in the anti-
 Teng campaign, with Mao leading the way. Teng has
 been charged-more or less credibly-with trying to
 return to the Good Old Days before the Cultural
 Revolution, with denigrating the Cultural Revolution
 ("the present is not as good as the past"), with
 attempting to reverse verdicts (inter alia, on those
 condemned), and with restoring to office discredited
 old cadres. There is no doubt that Teng was primarily
 or partially responsible--especially during 1975-for
 rehabilitating a large number of old cadres, including
 many of his old associates and proteges from his years
 (1954-1966) as the Party's Secretary-General.
 Any attempt to repurge the "rehabilitees" en masse
 would almost certainly come from the Leftists, who
 played leading roles in the purges, who rose at the
 expense of those purged, who felt threatened
 themselves by the return of such figures as Teng, and
 who would like to open up all those jobs for the young
 people who constitute their putative following (Wang
 Hung-wen has reportedly said this frankly, with respect
 to senior military positions held in part by
 rehabilitees). But Chang Chun-chiao, the most
 strongly-based and apparently least extreme Leftist,
 has himself been associated with the policy of
 rehabilitation, and even if the Leftists were to act as a
 group they would on this issue as on others be
 outgunned. Hua Kuo-feng, Chi Teng-kuei, and Wang
 Tung-hsing have all strongly associated themselves
 with the rehabilitation policy, and also, owing to their
 organizational positions, have probably played large
 roles in effecting the rehabilitations. The latter is
 almost certainly also true of the leading military men
 like Yeh Chien-ying and Chen Hsi-lien, who have
 helped to restore their old comrades (excluding the
 conspirators of the Lin Piao affair) throughout the
 military establishment and might be expected (Yeh
 certainly, Chen probably) to resist any attempt to
 change the current professionalism and conservative
 cast of the upper levels of the armed forces. *
 There is the outside possibility that the Leftists-or
 some of them-will attempt to bypass the rest of the
 Party leadership and appeal directly to the masses,
 much as Mao did in the Cultural Revolution. This
 would be a call to complete the Cultural Revolution,
 or to carry out another Cultural Revolution (Mao
 himself is the authority for the dictum that further
 Cultural Revolutions will be necessary periodically),
 and this time to sweep out all of the hidden supporters
 of Teng Hsiao-ping, meaning in effect the great
 majority of the rehabilitees.

 concept of the Cultural Revolution is the essence or
 culmination of Mao's "thought" (the highest form of
 "struggle"), and that the masses should therefore be
 given the opportunity to select those who will protect
 and preserve his "thought." (The likeliest carriers of
 this particular virulence look to be Wang Hung-wen
 and Yao Wen-yuan, who owe their rise wholly to the
 Cultural Revolution and who might believe that they
 have a strong base of support in the young.)
 But the problem for any such challenger-on either
 the issue of "rehabilitation" or the issue of the entire
 configuration of the succession-seems obvious: that
 the impetus for another Cultural Revolution could
 come only from a leader who was already in possession
 of something like Mao's power (otherwise, the Party
 already faithfully represents the masses), who could
 use the masses as a weapon against those unresponsive
 to himself personally as the embodiment of truth, and
 who among other things could completely control the
 propaganda apparatus employed to rouse the masses.
 There is no Leftist on the current scene who has
 anything like Mao's charisma, who could send the
 masses out into the streets on his or her behalf.
 Although two prominent Leftists, Chang and Yao, do
 seem to have the largest roles in directing the
 propaganda apparatus for Mao now, there is no way
 they can expect to keep these positions against the
 wishes of other Party leaders after Mao's death unless
 they also control the military establishment, and there
 seems virtually no prospect of that. Chang's GPD does
 not control the armed forces, it works for those who
 control them; while the GPD is a vital organ, and
 Chang might be able to use the GPD to support his
 own or another's candidacy for high position
 (redirecting the PLA's loyalty from Mao to someone
 else, even himself), in itself it seems clearly to be an
 insufficient vehicle for "king-making," and Chang
 himself needs the good will of the senior military men
 who appear to dominate the MAC, of which the GPD
 is the instrument.
 In sum,  the prospect of another Cultural
 Revolution, another mass campaign outside the
 The  Sino-Soviet-American  Triangle:  Another
 inescapable issue for Mao's successors in the
 immediate post-Mao period-as inescapable as that of
 defining their relationship to Mao himself-is that of
 the Chinese position in the Sino-Soviet-American
 triangle.* This is true not only because Peking's policy
 toward the USSR-and consequently its policy toward
 the US-has been so closely identified with Mao's
 personal intransigence toward the Soviets and his
 personal advocacy of the opening to the US, so that a
 qualitatively new situation will arise with his death,
 but because Moscow will not allow the successors to
 escape the issue. That is, with the menacing presence
 of half a million Soviet troops on the border as an
 incentive to Peking to negotiate, the Russians will
 almost certainly renew overtures to the Chinese for an
 improvement in relations, beginning with a border
 settlement,
 Almost all of those expected to be key figures in the
 succession have put themselves repeatedly on record as
 hard-line anti-Soviet, and in recent months, following
 the changes in the leadership, Chinese leaders have
 been at pains to reaffirm that their fundamental
 foreign policies-meaning those since 1969, when the
 USSR officially became the "main enemy" and the US
 began to emerge as a potential tacit ally against the
 USSR-will not change. But these leaders have had no
 choice, because Mao has continued to dominate the
 Party and has shown himself to be willing and able to
 continue to purge it, and any sign of a resolution less
 firm than Mao's would have served to remove the
 offender from leadership. (That was not, however, the
 reason for Teng Hsiao-ping's purge.)
 It has never been credible, a priori, that every
 member of a group as large as the Chinese leadership
 would feel the same degree of hostility to the USSR
 that Mao has felt; or even that every member of the
 insights he has drawn from their studies, PR 76 10006C, "The Chances
 of Sino-Soviet Reconciliation after Mao's Death," and PR 76

 topmost group of successors-the inner circle of a
 dozen or so-would feel so. Moreover, it has long
 seemed likely, in the nature of the case, even if every
 key figure of the succession were fully as hostile to the
 USSR as Mao has been, that considerations of national
 interest would lead to some sentiment among Mao's
 successors for an easing of the tension. Further, it has
 long seemed possible that some group in the successor
 leadership would try to exploit the Sino-Soviet-
 American issue for factional advantage, perhaps
 irrespective of its genuine views; just as Lin Piao
 opposed an improvement in relations with the US in
 part because his main rival for influence with Mao,
 Chou En-lai, favored such an improvement (and vice
 versa), so the Leftists and Rightists in China after
 Mao's death, although no longer competing for
 influence with Mao, might manipulate the issue
 against each other. The intelligence problems here
 have been to identify the "soft" figures (least hostile to
 the USSR) in the leadership, to calculate their weight
 in the succession, to determine how far they (or other
 leaders for other reasons) would be willing to go in
 order to ease tensions, and to assess the value of the
 Sino-Soviet-American issue as a counter in factional
 politics.
 There seems virtually no chance of a radical change
 in Chinese policy toward either the USSR or the US in
 the months following Mao's death. Just as they cannot
 repudiate Mao personally and the concept of his
 "thought" in general in the immediate post-Mao
 period without undermining themselves, so they
 cannot radically alter these particular policies without
 repudiating Mao. The anti-Soviet policy has been at
 the center of almost all of Mao's policies-meaning
 the policies of the Party as a whole- for more than a
 decade, even prior to the Cultural Revolution, and in
 recent years the (sharply qualified) pro-American
 policy has been a function of that policy; to repudiate
 that policy would thus bring into question'the entire
 fabric of Chinese policy. This would be true regardless
 of whether the immediate post-Mao succession were to
 be dominated by the Left, the Center, or the Right.
 However, ithere is some room for a very limited
 easing of the tension with the Soviets in the immediate
 post-Mao period, without giving the appearance of
 repudiating Mao himself, And the incentive will be
 greater than it has been; that is, those Soviet troops
 along the border will be worth something psychologi-
 cally to Moscow at the time of the succession, as
 Chinese fears of a Soviet attack at that time will (as the
 Chinese themselves have indicated) have increased.
 Although the Chinese cannot be expected to take the
 initiative to send a delegation to Moscow soon after
 Mao's death (a repudiation of Mao, a humiliation for
 themselves), it is conceivable that they would agree to
 a "summit" meeting in Peking, and in any case the
 border issue is not in fact central to the overall struggle
 against Soviet "social-imperialism."  The Chinese
 could recognize this by quietly withdrawing their
 demand for a withdrawal of Soviet troops from the
 border as a precondition for beginning serious talks
 (just as the Russians could quietly withdraw some part
 of the troops as a gesture of good faith), While the
 prospects for an early settlement of the border issue are
 small (the Chinese would have to agree to
 compensation for, rather than gain possession of, a
 disputed river island), a modest compromise on the
 matter of troop withdrawal would help to insure the
 Chinese against the possibility that these troops would
 actually be used.*
 Over the longer run, the situation looks more
 complicated. Ironically, the group likely to be the most
 uncompromisingly anti-Soviet, the Leftists, is likely
 also to be the most firmly anti-American, while the
 groups likely to be least anti-American, the Centrists
 and the Rightists, are likely also to be the least harshly
 anti-Soviet (although still clearly anti-Soviet).
 The  Russians themselves have regarded the
 Leftists-specifying Madame Mao and the three
 "Shanghai radicals" Chang Chun-chiao, Wang
 Hung-wen and Yao Wen-yuan-as the hard core of
 intransigent hostility to the USSR in the anticipated
 successor leadership, because the members of this
 group have seemed genuinely to share Mao's view of
 the need to persist in the struggle against "revisionism"
 on all fronts. On the other hand, although associating
 themselves nominally with the opening to the US
 while Mao lives,                                ll

 adherence to orthodox, fundamentalist, "revolution-

 equidistance from two absolute enemies (the policy
 favored by the "ultra-Leftist" Lin Piao), regardless of
 the strategic situation and considerations of national
 interest.
 The Russians entertained no hopes of Teng Hsiao-
 ping (who had been as intransigently anti-Soviet for
 many years as Mao could possibly have wished), but
 they were quick to express some hope for Hua Kuo-
 feng, of whose record of anti-Soviet pronouncements
 the appeared to be unaware
 Presuma y Hua s pu IT an priva e
 remarks in recent months have reduced if not
 extinguished those hopes, and the Russians have no
 ground for more than minimal hopes from others of
 the conjectured Centrist group. But, as earlier
 suggested, the Russians have had hope for years from
 elements of the Right, and in particular from Chinese
 military leaders, even though they have seemed
 genuinely unable to identify-since 1959-the pro-
 Soviet or the least anti-Soviet individuals in the
 military. The hope was stimulated by the Peng Te-
 huai affair of 1959, in which Defense Minister Peng
 frankly advocated an improvement in relations with
 the USSR, was fed by the Lin Piao affair of 1971
 (which implied that there were other "closet" anti-
 Maoists in the Chinese military leadership), and has
 been watered in recent years by certain features of the
 anti-Confucian campaign of 1974, the "Water
 Margin" campaign of 1975, and the anti-Teng
 campaign of 1976-in all of which the regime's
 propaganda has reflected Mao's continuing fear that
 he has not managed to extinguish pro-Soviet feeling
 (or anti-anti-Soviet feeling) in China, especially
 among the military. The Russians are probably right in
 believing  that for whatever combination  of
 reasons-pro-Soviet feeling, fear of the USSR,
 considerations of national or professional or factional
 interest-there  are  important elements of the
 professional military who do favor a substantial
 improvement in relations with the USSR (even though
 we too are unable to identify individuals as more than
 possibly feeling this way).
 It follows, then, that the happiest outcome for the
 Russians would probably be domination of the
 successor leadership by a Rightist faction in which the
 military would have a strong voice. * This outcome is
 unlikely, but the next best outcome, for Moscow,
 would seem to he the accession to dominance of a
 coalition of career Party cadres and career military
 men, on a Centrist balance, in which the military
 would also have a strong voice, inasmuch as the career
 Party cadres would depend for their survival upon
 retaining the military's good will. And this seems the
 most likely outcome, the arrangement with the best
 chance of c
 i
 t
 om
 ng
 o pass, even though it seems little
 more than an even-money bet.
 One variation of the `military dictatorship' scenario
 would be very awkward for the Russians to deal with.
 That would be an alliance between the Leftists and
 opportunistic military leaders, if the latter were to
 include Chen Hsi-lien and his personal following in
 the strategic Peking MR. That improbable union
 would coalesce those believed to be most anti-Soviet
 on one hand and least anti-Soviet on the other. The
 military would be expected to dominate the alliance,
 but the civilians might be formulating and carrying
 out its foreign policy. Perhaps fortunately for almost
 everyone, that scenario seems to have small chance of
 coming to pass,
 There does not seem to be any possible constellation
 of successors to Mao which would wish to restore the
 Sino-Soviet alliance of 1949-1953, returning the US to
 its place as the main enemy of both. The worst that the
 US has to fear is a Chinese policy of equidistance. * *
 The probability-because the prospect of either Leftist
 domination or a Leftist-military alliance is small-is
 that the USSR will remain the "main enemy," and
 that Mao's successors will continue to explore the
 possibility of effectively employing the US
 strategic counterweight to the USSR.
 The Sino-Soviet-American triangle can of course
 become an issue in factional politics, between those
 who genuinely favor (or would pretend to favor) a
 policy of equidistance, and those who genuinely favor
 *Russian officials sometimes express a sardonic hope that the
 Leftists will triumph and will then mismanage China into a state of
 collapse, but this does not seem to be their genuine calculation.
 **This is believed to be the policy-preference of the Leftists, but it
 would not be a net gain for the US$R, as the Leftists would be less
 inclined to improve relations with the USSR than would other
 factions or groupings. I.e., `what you make in St. Louis you lose in
 Detroit.'

 (or would pretend to favor) the greatest degree of
 improvement: in relations with the USSR. Although the
 former group would be expected to argue mainly on
 ideological grounds for a withdrawal from the US
 connection (the equal threats to the True Doctrine
 from "imperialism" and "social-imperialism" ), the
 two groups could employ similar pragmatic arguments
 to justify their opposed positions-arguments which
 have surfaced from time to time in various
 pronouncements and commentaries directed to
 different audiences. These would be:
 -that for many years, the determination of the
 US to resist Soviet advances has been declining;
 -that partly because of this, there has been a
 shift in the military balance of power in favor of the
 USSR, a shift which further erodes the US will to
 resist;
 -that in consequence, the US is betting heavily
 on the success of "detente" with the USSR, a
 detente which will prove to be an "illusion" for the
 US as the USSR will go on behaving as it always has,
 under cover of detente, but which will prove to be a
 disaster for China, as China will have no leverage on
 either;
 -that American relations with the USSR are far
 more important to the US than relations with China
 can possibly be, as China is no great military threat
 to the US, is of little value in deterring a Soviet
 attack on the US, and would not be of great value as
 an ally in war;
 -that it is not the US which is now deterring an
 attack on China, and that the US would do nothing
 for China in the event of a Soviet attack on China;
 -that as a practical matter, the principal US
 interest in China is in the border issue (i.e., keeping
 it unsettled), which `forces' the USSR to invest
 heavily in the China front and reduces the threat on
 the European front where the US strategic interest
 really lies;
 -that the US is determined to prevent Peking
 from taking over Taiwan;
 -and, in sum, that the US has simply been using
 China to get a better deal from Moscow.
 For one group, these arguments would add up to a
 policy of abandoning efforts to "normalize" relations
 with the US; for the other, to a policy of following the
 same course as the US and reducing tensions with the
 USSR as much as possible, beginning by accepting
 Soviet terms for a border settlement.
 While elements of the argument might be accepted
 by almost all of the key figures of the post-Mao
 leadership (the USSR is obviously a more important
 country at this time than is China, simply a regional
 power; and a genuine concern about the military
 balance and the current state of US resolve seems to
 come through Chinese statements to all audiences),
 and while the two positions may be put forward over
 the longer term, the argument as an argument does not
 seem worth much to either of the two possible groups
 at the extremes of the foreign policy range in a contest
 for position at the time of the succession. In other
 words, most of the key figures have accepted a
 different argument, so that, if one or the other of these
 two hypothetical groups has not already won the
 struggle for power but has to try to persuade other
 leaders to adopt its foreign policies, neither of them
 would be able to do it.
 Public and private statements by Chinese leaders,
 both in recent years and recent months, have seemed
 to make clear that those concerned with foreign policy,
 including most of those expected to be the key figures
 of the post-Mao leadership, have a picture of the Sino-
 Soviet-American triangle something like this:
 -that China must have a counterweight to the
 USSR under any circumstances (even if there is a
 substantial improvement in Sino-Soviet relations,
 and only a limited improvement is expected), and
 there is simply no alternative to the US;
 -that the US is still militarily powerful (almost as
 strong as the USSR), and means to remain so;
 -that the US does in fact help both to deter a
 Soviet attack on China and to resist Soviet efforts to
 establish "hegemony" in the Far East, and has
 declared its intention to continue to do so (cf.
 President Ford's remarks on this theme during his
 visit to Peking last December);
 -that the Soviet-American detente is in fact
 limited and precarious;

 Approved For Release 2004/07/08 : CIA-RDP79T00889A000800060001-5
 -that the US does indeed perceive China-with
 its land mass and huge population-as of value
 strategically, a value that can only increase with the
 increase of Chinese military power;
 -that normalization of relations with the US
 (full diplomatic relations) of course will require
 some time, and cannot be expected in the next few
 months;
 -that the Taiwan issue, while vexatious, is much
 less important than the strategic issue, and China
 can afford to "wait," as regards the annexation of
 Taiwan;
 -and that, in sum, Sino-American relations,
 while imperfect, are more-or-less satisfactory.
 In other words, to put the matter in minimal terms,
 the Chinese are far from having completed their
 exploration of the possibilities for a profitable
 relationship with the US, and it would be on the face
 of it absurd to close off those possibilities, or to move
 rapidly toward an accommodation with the USSR,
 without at least completing the process of exploration.
 Earlier calculations as to the distribution of power in
 the immediate post-Mao period (lasting at least for
 some months) were that the "collective" would
 probably be headed by the Centrist Hua Kuo-feng,
 who would probably retain Foreign Minister Chiao
 Kuan-hua. (See photograph.) Both Hua and Chiao
 have  associated themselves with  the above-
 summarized position in a credible fashion (i.e., it
 seems  to be what they genuinely believe,
 independently of Mao), and most of the others
 expected to be key figures in the post-Mao leadership
 are associated with it to some degree. Although a
 leadership completely dominated by the doctrinaire
 Leftists might choose to close off the opening to the US
 in the immediate post-Mao period, there seems little
 chance of such dominance. Any other constellation of
 post-Mao leaders, even a military dictatorship, could
 be expected to continue the process of exploration,
 even while continuing to complain (as are the current
 leaders) that the pace of "normalization" of Sino-
 American relations is too slow,*
 *The  three  standard  demands for "normalization"  will
 presumably continue (in this period) to be the severance of US
 diplomatic relations with Taipei, the withdrawal of US armed forces
 from Taiwan, and the abrogation of the US-ROC Mutual Defense
 Treaty of 1954.
