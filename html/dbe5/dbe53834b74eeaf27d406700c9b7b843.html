 THE MEN IN THE SING-SOVIET CONFRONTATION
 5 July 1963
 The delegates chosen by the Chinese and the
 Soviet parties for the bilateral talks--opening
 today--provide proof, if any more is needed, that
 the talks will be more bitterly acrimonious and less
 productive than any that have gone before.                Both
 parties are being represented by top-level, uncom-
 promising experts in dealing with hostile opponents.
 men in each delegation are highly skilled ointhe
 particularly nasty infighting that characterizes
 Communist party life, and they can be counted on
 by Khrushchev and Mao to convey forcefully the
 antagonism each feels for the other.
 The Chinese Team
 The selection of Teng
 Hsiao-ping and Peng Chen to head
 the Chinese Communist Party
 (CCP) delegation means that the
 Chinese are approaching the
 talks in a truculent, uncompro-
 mising mood.  Both these men
 at past conferences of Communist
 parties have demonstrated that
 they are tough, intelligent, and
 unrelievedly hostile to Soviet
 policies.  Both have had occa-
 sion to criticize Khrushchev to
 his face and are therefore prob-
 ablypersonally offensive to
 him.. .
 A review of recent activi-
 ties of the Chinese leadership
 suggests that Teng and Peng have
 been Mao's chief lieutenants
 in planning and executing strat-
 egy in the anti-Soviet contest.
 Since the Sino-Soviet dispute
 surfaced in 1960, they have
 tirelessly courted representa-
 tives of Communist parties and
 of Asian and African states,
 soliciting support for revolu-
 tionary Chinese views, attack-
 ing Soviet policies, and trying
 SECRET
 to undermine Soviet influence.
 In recent months, between infre-
 quent public appearances, they
 have probably been huddling with
 Mao to plan Chinese strategy
 and to help draft the voluminous
 polemical material Peiping has
 been issuing.
 Teng Hsiao-ping
 Teng Hsiao-ping, a hard-
 driving and aggressive man,
 appears to rank alongside Chou
 En-lai in third place in the
 Chinese Communist hierarchy.
 One of the youngest of the seven
 members of the politburo's
 standing committee, who form
 the inner circle of power in
 China, he now holds two key
 party positions which give him
 formidable power.  As a member
 of the standing committee, he
 helps formulate all major pol-
 icies; as head of the secre-
 tariat, he supervises their
 day-to-day implementation. In
 the latter role, he also con-
 trols important personnel ap-
 pointments and has often ex-
 ploited the power this gives
 to place his proteges. on the

 TYPICAL CHINESE VIEWS OF MOSCOW'S LINE
 TENG HSIAO-PING:
 "The Soviet party is opportunist and revisionist; it lacks
 any deep knowledge of Marxism; its ideas about disarm-
 ament are absurd; peaceful coexistence could mean no-
 thing, except as a tactical weapon to deceive the enemy;
 the Soviet idea of a division of labor among the countries
 of the socialist camp is wrong, and China must go her
 own way.  (From his speech on 14 November 1960 at the
 Moscow conference of 81 Communist parties)
 KANG SHENG:
 "Khrushchev's statements concerning Eisenhower's desire
 for peace resulted in deluding the people of the world."
 (Bucharest, 26 June 1960)
 LIU NING-I :
 "To sit down at the same table with imperialists means
 a betrayal of all mankind." (2 June 1960, commenting
 on the Soviet view that disarmament talks are necessary)

 secretariat and in other key
 positions.
 Teng's meteoric rise dates
 from 1954 and is linked with
 the purge that year of Kao Kang
 and Jao Shu-shih, regional lead-
 ers who attempted to seize su-
 preme power.   Probably as a re-
 ward for the part he played in
 exposing the conspiracy, he be-
 came secretary general and a
 politburo member in 1954.   When
 the standing committee was formed
 in 1956, Teng was on it.
 Since rising to eminence,
 Teng has been associated only
 with militant policies.   One of
 his chief and continuing concerns
 has been discipline in the party.
 He was an enthusiastic backer of
 the radical Leap Forward and com-
 mune movements.   He did not as-
 sociate himself with Mao's Hun-
 dred Flowers movement of early
 1957, which he probably regarded
 as dangerously liberal, nor has
 he made a major statement on
 domestic policy since the return
 to a moderate approach in late
 1960.
 Teng has been just as con-
 cerned about the loss of revolu-
 tionary momentum in the inter-
 national Communist movement as
 at home.   In November 1957 he
 accompanied Mao to Moscow, where
 he helped present a stiffened
 Chinese line at a meeting of
 Communist parties.   In May 1958,
 at China's most recent party con-
 gress, Teng blasted "modern re-
 visionism," the Chinese term for
 ideological backsliding.
 Teng played a key role at
 the second conference of the
 world's Communist parties, held
 at Moscow in November 1960,
 after the Sino-Soviet dispute
 had broken into the open.   Al-
 though Liu Shao-chi headed the
 Chinese delegation, Teng made
 the major speeches.   In addi-
 tion to the usual attacks on
 the USSR for being too soft in
 its policies toward the West
 and underdeveloped countries,
 Teng is reported to have de-
 fended Mao against Khrushchev's
 criticism of him for being an
 ivory-tower theorist, to have
 blamed Khrushchev for causing
 the deterioration of relations
 by insisting that other parties
 accept his dictatorship, and to
 have charged the Soviets with
 attempting to subvert the Chi-
 nese leadership.
 Since 1960 Teng has devoted
 much time to the task of solicit-
 ing support from foreign Commu-
 nists. In 1961 he led a CCP dele-
 gation to North Korea, which is
 now firmly in the Chinese camp.
 He has received representatives
 of many Communist parties which,
 if not already sympathetic to
 China, are believed to be sus-
 ceptible to Chinese arguments
 or to have factions that are sus-
 ceptible.   The recent growth of
 Chinese influence in the world
 movement may be attributed in
 part to Teng's persuasiveness.
 Peng Chen, a senior polit-
 buro member but not on the stand-
 ing committee, has a party back-
 ground and a radical leftist
 outlook very similar to Teng
 Hsiao-ping's.   Peng is on the
 secretariat.   He is also mayor

 of Peiping and first secretary
 of the Peiping party committee,
 but in recent years he has dele-
 gated much of the responsibility
 these positions entail in order
 to devote full time to problems
 of international communism.
 Peng has attended several
 international conferences where
 Soviet and Chinese delegates
 clashed.   He presented the Chi-
 nese line forcefully in June 1960
 at a Rumanian party congress in
 Bucharest, where he clashed bit-
 terly with Khrushchev after the
 Soviet leader had contemptuously
 criticized Mao.   There are re-
 ports that Peng accused Khru-
 shchev to his face of such things
 as betraying Marxism-Leninism
 and of thinking like a capital-
 ist because he lived like one.
 Peng was a member of the
 CCP delegation to the November
 1960 Moscow conference.   He was
 also in Chou En-lai's delegation
 to the 22nd Soviet party congress
 in 1961, and acted as delegation
 chief after Soviet attacks on
 Albania and the CCP caused Chou
 to leave prematurely.   Peng led
 delegations to North Korea and
 North Vietnam in 1962.   Out of
 the public eye from 24 April
 until 15 June, Peng may well
 have had a hand in drafting
 Peiping's 25-point letter of
 14 June attacking Soviet pol-
 icies.
 Other Members of
 The Chinese Delegation
 The five lower level members
 of the Chinese delegation are
 all party veterans and militant
 revolutionaries who have been
 SECRET
 active recently in international
 Communist affairs.
 Kang Sheng is a Russian-
 speaking specialist on intelli-
 gence matters and an outspoken
 participant in bloc meetings.
 He was the leading Chinese
 observer at a Warsaw Pact meet-
 ing in February 1960, backed up
 Peng Chen at Bucharest in June
 1960, was a member of the high-
 powered delegation at the Moscow
 conference of 81 Communist
 parties in November 1960, and
 accompanied Chou En-lai to the
 22nd Soviet congress in 1961.
 He is an alternate member of
 the politburo and a member of
 the secretariat.
 Yang Shang-kun was present
 on three occasions in early 1963
 when the Soviet ambassador to
 Peiping was summoned for prepara-
 tory talks on the forthcoming
 meeting.   Yang speaks Russian
 and attended the 1960 Moscow
 conference.   He has appeared
 with Mao at receptions for
 African  and Latin American
 visitors.   Only an alternate
 member of the secretariat,
 Yang's precise role is unclear.
 He may be a sort of personal
 aide to Mao Tse-tung.
 Wu Hsiu-chuan heads the
 CCP's international liaison de-
 partment, which is responsible
 for interparty relations.   Be-
 tween November 1962 and January
 1963 he ably represented Pei-
 ping at four Eastern European
 party congresses, where he was
 subjected to catcalls and harass-
 ment.   As China's last ambassa-
 dor to Yugoslavia, a post dropped

 eyewitness support to Chinese
 charges of Titoist "revision-
 ism."
 Liu Ning-i attended the
 1960 Moscow conference and has
 vigorously clashed with the So-
 viets at Communist-oriented
 meetings held outside the bloc.
 For example, at the Afro-Asian
 Solidarity Conference held in
 Moshi, Tanganyika, early this
 year, Liu Ning-i successfully
 persuaded the conferees to
 ignore Soviet advice and adopt
 uninhibited anticolonialist
 revolutions,
 Pan Tzu-li, ambassador to
 Moscow since last November,
 earned. a reputation for tough-
 ness during his tour as ambas-
 sador to India from 1956 through
 1962.   One of his more difficult
 responsibilities is to dissemi-
 nate, in defiance of Moscow's
 wishes., Chinese polemical tracts
 to Soviet audiences.   It was
 this action that caused the
 Soviets to declare five Chinese
 personae non gratae, thereby
 further straining state as well
 as party relations.
 The Chinese delegates will
 find themselves face to face
 with the most experienced and
 hard-headed spokesmen the Krem-
 lin can muster.    The four
 principal Soviet negotiators
 are all secretaries of the
 party central committee and
 thus members of the top leader-
 ship.   They, like the Chinese,
 have previously been the cen-
 tral figures in earlier direct
 meetings with their antagonists.
 Their specialties--ideology,
 propaganda, and liaison with
 other Communist parties--make
 it likely that they have played
 the major role in drafting
 ideological position papers
 and the Soviet party's increas-
 ingly vituperative answers to
 Chinese attacks.
 Mikhail Suslov
 The team is headed by
 Mikhail Suslov, member of the
 party presidium as well as the
 secretariat and long a leading
 authority on doctrine.   Now
 60, he is sparce, dour, taci-
 turn and, in the opinion of
 one Western observer, looks
 like "an embittered civil serv-
 ant passed. over for promotion."
 Despite his retiring and.
 generally lackluster nature,
 Suslov is one of the most power-
 ful men in the Soviet Union.
 He has been a central party
 secretary since 1947, longer
 than Khrushchev himself, and
 his principal concerns through-
 out this period. have been
 ideology and relations with
 foreign Communist parties.   In
 addition to his secretarial post,
 he served Stalin as head of the
 party's propaganda and agita-
 tion department (Agitprop) dur-
 ing 1947-1948, and later as
 chief editor  of  Pravda. Because
 his job was to push Stalin's
 policies and programs, he created
 the impression of being little
 more than a hard-lining sycophant.
 Suslov's performance since
 March 1953 indicates, however,
 that he was a Stalinist more
 of necessity than of convic-
 tion.   Particularly since the
 i onset of de-Stalinization at

 the 20th party congress in 1956,
 he has rendered invaluable
 services to the Khrushchev re-
 gime.   In 1956, for example.,
 he teamed up with Khrushchev
 to explain the denigration of
 Stalin to the befuddled satel-
 lite leaders who flocked to
 Moscow in the wake of the 20th
 congress.   A year later, he
 stood with Khrushchev against
 the "anti-party"  (and pro-Stalin)
 group in the presidium, and
 at the central committee plenum
 which followed, he helped to
 seal the fates of Malenkov,
 Molotov, and Kaganovich by
 manipulating the proceedings
 so that none of their supporters
 had a chance to be heard.
 In addition to his stand.
 against Stalin's "cult of per-
 sonality," he has repeatedly
 upheld those Moscow views which
 have stuck deepest in Peiping's
 craw:   the correctness of So-
 viet Marxist theory, the su-
 periority of the Soviet method.
 of building communism, and
 Khrushchev's doctrine of peace-
 ful coexistence with the West.
 Suslov was a principal spokes-
 man during the long and often
 acrimonious debates at the 1957
 and 1960 world Communist con-
 ferences in Moscow.   After the
 latter meeting he apparently
 took the rostrum at a good many
 party meetings in order to ex-
 plain the differences existing
 between the Soviet and Chinese
 parties.   Speaking in Peiping
 on the 10th anniversary of the
 Chinese People's Republic in
 September 1959--and immediately
 prior to Khrushchev's arrival
 there from the United States--
 Suslov reminded the Chinese that
 they are still "building social-
 ism," in contrast to the USSR,
 which had advanced to the higher
 stage of "full-scale construc-
 tion of a Communist society."
 Suslov's point of view
 in the Sino-Soviet polemic
 emerged most clearly from his
 speech to a national conference
 of social scientists in Febru-
 ary 1962.   Addressing himself
 to the Albanian party leader-
 ship--and thus indirectly to
 the Chinese--he attacked their
 "dogmatism" and accused them
 of hiding behind pseudorevolu-
 tionary leftist slogans, of
 being iinwilling or finable to
 evaluate the "new historical
 situation" and to apply Marx-
 ism-Leninism under changed con-
 ditions.   Branding the Albanian
 line as malicious, deviationist,
 slanderous and anti-Leninist,
 and overtly anti-Soviet, he
 stated that the Albanian leaders
 were deliberately undermining
 the unity of the world Communist
 movement.   It is safe to as-
 sume that Suslov took a similar
 position in his remarks--as
 yet unpublished--on the Sino-
 Soviet dispute at a closed ses-
 sion of the party plenum last
 month.
 Suslov will probably de-
 liver the general Soviet posi-
 tion and then rely on his three
 principal teammates for extrap-
 olation  and  debate on specific
 bones of contention.   Each has
 responsibility for supervising
 a key segment of Moscow's
 ideological activity in his
 day-to-day work as a central
 committee secretary.

 Yuri Andropov
 Yuri Andropov has been
 chief of the Soviet party's
 department for relations with
 bloc parties since 1957.   He
 is 49, a party careerist, and
 a representative of the younger
 professionals whom Khrushchev
 has brought into the leader-
 ship in increasing numbers.
 During 1941-51 he worked as
 a local-level official first
 in the youth organization (the
 Komsomol) and then in the party;
 he subsequently served for two
 years as head of a subsection
 in the party central apparatus
 and transferred to the diplo-
 matic corps in 1953.  Assigned
 to Budapest as%counselor of the
 embassy, he was named ambassa-
 dor to Hungary in 1954 and
 remained in that post until his
 transfer back to the party ap-
 paratus in 1957.   He was elected
 to the central committee sec-
 retariat at the 22nd party con-
 gress in November 1961.
 As the Moscow official
 in charge of relations with
 bloc parties, Andropov is in
 very frequent contact with satel-
 lite representatives who visit
 the Soviet capital; in addi-
 tion, he travels widely through-
 out the bloc, attending various
 party conferences, congresses,
 and celebrations.   His personal
 convictions are probably very
 similar to those of Khrushchev
 and Suslov.   At least the Al-
 banians see him as being firmly
 in the opposing camp; last
 October they described him in
 the press as a "known proponent
 of the sinister activities of
 Khrushchev and his group...."
 SECRET
 Soviet party relations with
 Communist parties outside the
 bloc are the responsibility of
 Boris Ponomarev, head of the
 central committee's "interna-
 tional department."  A historian
 by training, he has been one
 of the Soviet Union's most
 prolific writers on party his-
 tory; since assuming control
 of the international depart-
 ment after the 20th congress in
 1956, he has emerged as the
 chief ideological spokesman
 for Soviet foreign policy and
 as Khrushchev's principal ad-
 viser on the doctrinal aspects
 of international relations.
 Ponomarev is 58 and has
 been a professional Communist
 almost all his life.   He joined
 the party when he was 14,
 fought in the civil war, and
 has apparently been on the full-
 time party payroll ever since.
 He has worked in the central
 apparatus in Moscow since 1944
 and has been concerned with
 international Communist party
 liaison since at least 1950.
 Election as a candidate
 member of the central committee
 at the 19th party congress in
 1952 marked the beginning of
 Ponomarev's rise into the top
 hierarchy.   By 1955 he had im-
 pressed the Soviet Union's new
 leader sufficiently to be taken
 as an adviser when Khrushchev
 and Bulganin went to Yugoslavia.
 At the 20th congress, less than
 a year later, Ponomarev was
 elevated. to full central com-
 mittee membership and in addi-
 tion to his assignment as head

 SOVIET VIEWS OF PEIPING'S DEFIANCE
 MIKHAIL SUSLOV:
 "The present Albanian (i.e., Chinese) leaders, having slipped
 into a quagmire of nationalism, are ever more openly going
 over from dogmatic positions to those of an open struggle
 against the CPSU and the world communist movement.... Their
 political line has an undisguised anti-Soviet trend and is of a
 malicious, slanderous nature." (From a speech on 5 February
 1962 to Soviet social scientists)
 BORIS PONOMAREV:
 "Attempts . . . on the basis of quotations out of context and
 far-fetched designs, to teach the Communist parties, headed
 by their tempered Marxist-Leninist leaders, are not only ludi-
 crous but harmful." (in Pravda, 18 November 1962)
 LEONID ILICHEV:
 "The ideological struggle of our party on two fronts-- against
 revisionism and against dogmatism and sectarianism--is a
 struggle for a fundamentally correct solution of the questions of
 theory and practice, for a creative development of Marxism-
 Leninism.... We must therefore protect and develop it
 together, in a single rank; for if Communists disperse to their
 little national corners and each starts to blow his own national
 trumpet, without regard for the radical, fundamental principles
 of Marxist-Leninist doctrine, this will only hamper the final
 victory of Communism." (Address to the central committee on
 18 June 1963)                                             630701 sB

 of the international depart-
 ment, he was appointed to the
 editorial board of the party
 theoretical journal Kommunist.
 He was named a central comet -
 tee secretary at the 22nd party
 congress in November 1961.
 Ponomarev's duties have
 gained him wide experience in
 dealing with foreign parties.
 He has maintained extensive
 contacts with nonbloc Commu-
 nist leaders and has frequently
 visited. them abroad.   He is
 also reported by several sources
 to have played an important
 role in the polemics with Pei-
 ping; certainly a large part
 of his activity in this regard
 has involved angling for sup-
 port among foreign--and par-
 ticularly West European--Com-
 munists.
 The chief Soviet asset in
 give-and-take argumentation
 with the Chinese will probably
 be Leonid Ilichev, veteran
 propagandist-ideologist-journal-
 ist, chairman of the Soviet
 party's ideological commission
 and a strong proponent of the
 Khrushchev line.   Regarded by
 most Russian intellectuals as
 the "Soviet Goebbels," he is
 stubborn, hard-headed, quick-
 witted, and sharp-tongued.
 He has a marked. flair for de-
 bate and is a master of dead-
 pan sarcasm.

 He became deputy chief of Agit-
 prop in early 1948, editor of
 Pravda  in  1951, and a candidate
 member of the central commit-
 tee in 1952.
 Immediately thereafter,
 however, Ilichev went into
 political decline.  He was re-
 placed as Pravda chief and
 dropped from     a editorial
 board of Kommunist. He clearly
 had incurred  talIn's wrath.
 In the shake-up which fol-
 lowed Stalin's death, Ilichev
 received the relatively minor
 post of chief of the Foreign
 Ministry's press department.
 He held the job for five years,
 editing foreign news published
 in the USSR and handling press
 and public relations for Khru-
 shchev on his travels abroad;
 he has accompanied Khrushchev
 on almost all his foreign visits
 since 1954, including his trip
 to the United States in 1959.
 Ilichev performed well as
 press chief and by 1958 he was
 named to head the vast Soviet
 propaganda machine.  At the
 22nd party congress, he was
 elevated to membership on the
 party secretariat--perhaps
 as an understudy to Suslov--
 and was made chief of the party's
 ideological commission on its
 formation last November.
