 MEMORANDUM FOR THE RECORD
 SUBJECT:   Aspen Institute Traditional Executive
 Seminar 3-16 August 1986
 1.   From 3-16 August 1986, I attended the Aspen Institute for
 Humanistic  Studies'   Traditional  Executive  Seminar,    in  Aspen
 Colorado.   The  seminar was a  unique educational  experience from
 which I believe I derived considerable benefit.   I further believe
 that it has   enhanced my value to  the Agency as a  manager.   This
 memorandum will describe the Aspen Executive Seminar,   in general,
 and my seminar session, in particular.   Furthermore, I will try to
 reflect on the value of non-traditional management training,    such
 as the Aspen Seminar, to Agency senior managers.
 2.   The Aspen Institute course brochure     best sums up how the
 Institute sees its role:
 "Founded in 1950   as an outgrowth of   an international Goethe
 bicentennial      convocation   ,    the Institute   has   since offerred
 thousands of business executives a rare opportunity for reflection
 rediscovery of personal values  and examination of contemporary
 issues in the company of some of the best minds in the world.
 ...   To...highly placed professionals, fully engaged in their
 careers,    the     Aspen  Institute Executive       Seminars  offer the
 opportunity to      stand aside for  a moment  from the rush  of daily
 events,   to look at the world and its affairs,   and to probe their
 personal values and those of their institutions.
 Seminar content   is varied  ...   but has   a common   theme: a
 humanistic approach to  the major issues of  contemporary society,
 the     perennial search  for Goethe's   'few reasonable  words'    in a
 world of increasing change and complexity.
 Discussion and debate arise from  around the seminar table on
 topics  as widely     ranging  as   corporate culture,    personal and
 institutional ethics, and the use and abuse of power.
 Skilled moderators from many   different backgrounds guide the

 discussions not  towards consensus but  to deepened  awareness and
 appreciation  of  alternative  viewpoints.   The  objective is  to
 sharpen  the  thinking  processes needed  for  effective  decision
 making at senior levels of corporate management."
 3. The Aspen Institute largely  achieved those ambitious and
 "high sounding" goals in the case of my seminar session.   The core
 of the seminar was a large textbook of readings and two plays that
 provided  the focus  for the  seminar  discussion.  The  seventeen
 seminar participants  came from  varied backgrounds,    though most
 were executives  from corporations  or public  organizations (U.S.
 and foreign).    The moderator  was Professor  Sidney Hyman  Of the
 University of  Illinois,   who has wide experience  in Government,
 academia  and journalism,    and with  the  Aspen seminar program.
 Critical to encouraging the interaction  which makes or breaks the
 seminar is the intellectually stimulating and physically beautiful
 environment of the Institute and Aspen, in general.  The format of
 the two-week stay with the Institute is designed to encourage both
 reflection and dialogue among seminar  participants.  It does this
 by providing  both the necessary  time and the  special activities
 conducive to  an active  interchange.  I  will briefly  comment on
 these aspects of the seminar in the following paragraphs.
 4.   I have attached a   list of   the seminar readings  on the
 hardcopy version of this memo.   As one   can see from this list the
 focus is on classics and the "great thinkers." Of necessity,     most
 of     the   readings are  excerpts.    The  readings cluster  on  four
 critical   ideas:  equality,   freedom,    justice,    and  property.
 Writings from Aristotle, Plato, Machiavelli, deTocqueville,     Mill,
 Martin Luther King, Franklin D.    Roosevelt,  etc.   are all covered
 under  a   set  schedule and   are   packaged  in  themes.    Seminar
 participants are asked to read the material before arriving at the
 seminar.   In practice,   because of the  volume of the material and
 the busy   schedules of participants,    this is rarely  done.   Most
 reading  is  done  in  the afternoons,    late  evenings           or  early
 mornings. All participants did read the material, and read it very
 carefully at   that.   This is   essential for full   participation in
 discussions.  The  reading burden  was anywhere  from one-to-three
 hours per day. Two plays were also read, Durrenmatt's "The Visit,"
 and Sophocles'"Antigone." The former was used as a springboard for
 a mock trial, and the latter was actually presented by the seminar
 as well as discussed.  (The presentation of "Antigone" was a fairly
 elaborate outdoor production involving costumes, a musician,   etc.
 The play was read,   however,   and not memorized.   The extra effort
 that  went  into  this  production  was  organized  by  a   seminar
 participant who had experience as a producer of off-Broadway plays
 in New York.)
 5. A key benefit of the  Aspen experience is the discussions
 with fellow "seminarians." As can be   seen from the attached class
 list (distributed in hardcopy), they are a varied lot.  My seminar
 included the Mayor of Tel-Aviv,   Israel   and his wife; an English
 couple   from the   business world;    an American professor who   is
 teaching at   the Free  University of  Berlin (   this professor   is

 well-known  in  political  science  circles,    was  on  the  State
 Department Policy Planning Staff,   and was U.S.  Ambassador to the
 Cameroons at one time); an employee of the New York Stock Exchange
 who has written a  book on Ph.D's in the business  world;   and the
 director of a New York Times project to produce an oral history of
 the newspaper (this individual was also the daughter of the former
 publisher of the Times, Orvil Dreyfoos.)   In addition,   there were
 executives from Honeywell, AT&T,   Bell Laboratories,   etc.  Almost
 all these individuals were accompanied by spouses who either fully
 participated in the seminar or were auditors.   I was the only U.S.
 Government employee in my seminar.    A similar seminar was running
 simultaneously  and included  Ambassador Jack   Matlock,   a  senior
 member of the National Security  Council.  This other seminar also
 included Maj. Gen.  (retired) Robert Taylor III, who had worked for
 the CIA   (for the   old National Intelligence Programs   Evaluation
 Staff,  predecessor to   the Intelligence Community Staff)    in the
 late Sixties and early Seventies.
 6.    The seminar  occupies  about  three hours  each  morning
 (except   for   Sunday.)     Seminarians gather  in  one of  several
 well-designed    seminar rooms.  The    seminar  table  is  arranged
 octagonally with participants    sitting around the outside  and the
 moderator at the   head.   The room was light,   sunny and airy with
 attractive paintings. Auditors (both spouses and others) sit along
 the outside of   the room.   They are not allowed to participate in
 discussions.   Professor Hyman would lead off the seminar with some
 questions or observations on the readings and things would go from
 there.   Several participants were "resource people" (i.e.,   people
 who  were  specially invited  by  the  Institute.)    I  found   the
 material  particularly tough going  at  first.  The    seminar   was
 initially  stressful   because the  quality     and   level of   the
 discussions seemed (at least to me) quite high and one was under a
 strong self-imposed obligation to participate   or at least closely
 follow  the  back-and-forth. Some   of  the     resource  people  in
 particular had considerable background in the subject matter.    The
 discussions were never  dull and,   in fact,    were generally quite
 fascinating.    The  varied  backgrounds    and  accomplishments  of
 participants  contributed  significantly to the  quality  of  the
 dialogue.
 7.    The afternoons  and evenings were  devoted to  reading,
 special lectures,   preparation for the play,   "Antigone," and free
 time.    Because   the reading   burden was heavier the first week,
 that week was quite full.   The burden lessened the second week and
 there  was   a  reasonable  amount  of  time  for  discussion   with
 colleagues and relaxation.    It should be noted that Aspen is a very
 busy summer resort that has beautiful mountains,   generally lovely
 weather,     and 1500 or so music   students in residence  making for
 many entertainment alternatives.    (The Aspen Music Festival tent is
 within walking distance   of the Institute.)  The  Institute itself
 has many     things going on including  an Arms Control  Seminar with
 exceptionally prestigious  attendees (I will  take action     to make
 the list of   attendees available to the   Arms Control Staff---many
 attendees  were former  Agency  employees,    however,   no  current

 employees  were in  attendence,   to  my  knowledge.)     Generally
 speaking,  the Aspen  Institute campus is overrun  with political,
 governmental and corporate heavyweights, adding to the "headiness"
 of  the  experience.  (Examples   during   my  tenure  were   James
 Schlesinger,    Bud McFarlane,    Justice  Harry Blackmun,  Shirley
 Williams, of the U.K.   Social Democratic Party, etc.) The informal
 nature of the Institute,  plus the fact that everyone eats in the
 same dining hall, in casually assembled groups,  encourages active
 exchange.   In  addition to my  own seminar  group ,   there  was an
 active exchange with attendees at the other Executive Seminar that
 was ongoing at the same time.
 8. Administratively, the seminar was run almost perfectly. As
 mentioned above, the Aspen environment,   and the Institute grounds
 are lovely and  conducive to reflection.  The Aspen    staff is most
 willing to please and will go out  of their way to make one's stay
 valuable and enjoyable. Most seminarians stay at the Aspen Meadows
 Hotel   which   is adjacent   to   the Institute (the   $4000   tuition
 includes room   and board.)   The   hotel also has beautiful grounds
 (Aspen is surrounded  by mountains and the  views are spectacular)
 and provides adequate,   though unexciting meals.  The staff of the
 hotel was especially pleasant.   The  hotel caters to the Institute
 though they do outside business as well. At maximum, the Institute
 seemed to have four seminars ongoing (about 100 people) so neither
 crowding at the Institute nor the hotel were a problem.   The hotel
 also has an  active health facility which is  available to seminar
 participants (they are encouraged to participate.)
 9.   The  seminar leader,  Prof.   Sidney     Hyman,   is a man of
 considerable personal  accomplishment,   having been an  advisor to
 several  Presidents,   editor  of F.D.R.'s  papers,    author of  an
 important  book on  the  American Presidency  and  a biography    of
 Marriner Eccles,    first Chairman  of the  Federal Reserve   Board.
 Prof. Hyman with    his whole family participated fully  in all the
 group's activities including meals and extracurricular excursions.
 His  wide  experience  and his  unpretentious  manner    contributed
 directly to the success of the seminar.   He encouraged, valued and
 respected all opinions.   In this regard,  I would like to note the
 contribution of the participating spouses.  One, in particular,    a
 housewife, who hadn't been in the work world for many years,     was
 one of the stars of the seminar.
 10.   I had  no obvious problems due to my  CIA sponsorship at
 the seminar.    The staff was uniformly cordial and supportive.   My
 fellow seminarians,   several of whom were Foreign nationals (i.e.,
 Israel and the U.K.),   were all quite friendly.   Perhaps it was my
 imagination, but I perceived, if anything, an anti-Government bias
 more than any anti-CIA feeling.   Being  without a spouse also puts
 one at a slight disadvantage.    Most firms and sponsors apparently
 paid for participation of a spouse as well as an employee.
 11.   In   summary,   I   believe the   Aspen Seminar   was a  most
 valuable professional  and personal   experience (and  the personal

 Sanitized Copy Approved for Release 2011/07/13: CIA-RDP88G01332R001301470048-4
 and  professional,    in  my  judgment,    are  always  inextricably
 inter-related.).    Instead of  tired  management concepts,    Aspen
 encourages one to rethink personal values.  These values I believe
 are  fundamental to   the decision  making process  which is   never
 truly mechanistic but  value driven.   Though the  seminar probably
 could make a stronger effort to  explicitly relate the material to
 the current organizational environment, the indirect connection is
 obvious and straightforward.(I suggested at the seminar's end that
 an additional two-hour session each day  be devoted to linking the
 day's  readings  to  the  real   world.)    My  fellow  seminarians
 universally agreed  on the  value of the  experience.   Key  to the
 benefits were the  stimulating group of seminarians  assembled and
 the  unique Aspen  environment   (physical  and atmospheric.) The
 seminar is organized to encourage   interaction outside the seminar
 room  and to  provide the  time  and ambience   for reflection and
 discussion.
 12.     Based on  these very  positive  benefits,  I  strongly
 recommend the CIA  continue to participate in the   future.   Due to
 the cost   and time   involved,   I believe the seminar is ideally
 suited to senior managers who need the time and are intellectually
 ready for  a period of reflection  and introspection.   In  the OIT
 context,   we should send group chiefs or higher (preferably deputy
 directors or above.)   The seminar is also given at Wye Plantation,
 on the   Eastern Shore,    Maryland.   Aspen  most certainly has its
 charms  (cultural and recreational activities,  ideal facilities and
 ambience), but I believe Wye,  which is a self-contained facility,
 would probably be acceptable as well.   Though,  it, no doubt, would
 be against obscure Government regulations,     the sending of spouses
 should be considered.    It appeared to have  definite benefits for
 all parties.   A rental car would also  be a great asset  (though it
 technically is not required for participation in the seminar.)   It
 would provide a convenient way for  getting to and from town which
 is often  required during  a two-week stay   (the hotel,    which is
 about one mile  from downtown Aspen,  does   provide transportation
 upon request though this can often result in scheduling problems.)
 13. Finally,    the question  arises as   to whether   we could
 replicate this approach in CIA at an off-site facility (presumably
 at a  reduced cost.)    We could certainly arrange  access to  the
 seminar  readings   (or  comparable  readings) and  obtain   under
 contract a seminar leader (probably inexperienced.)  What we could
 not recreate  is the diverse student  body.   I believe the varied
 backgrounds,  nationalities,   and employers of the seminarians was
 an absolutely invaluable and crucial part of the experience. A CIA
 (or Community)   clone would lack this important element.  We would
 also  have  to   do  without the  intellectual atmosphere  of  the
 Institute. This,  too, would detract from the overall experience.
 14.   One   final footnote is in order:    I believe   we should
 consider  redesigning our classrooms like those at Aspen,      if at all
 possible.   Sitting  around the circumference      of an  octagonal (or
 similarly shaped) table encouraged discussion, allowed everyone to
 see the speakers,    and gave one the feeling      of interaction among

 peers.     I  think much of  our seminar-type training  would benefit
 from   this simple  change (if  we haven't  already redesigned  our
 classrooms accordingly since my last in-house training.)

 THE GENERAL AIMS OF THE EXECUTIVE SEMINAR PROGRAM
 The Aspen Institute Executive Seminar Program is designed to create
 an experience within which the participants can appraise and renew their
 personal values.   The Seminar provides for discussion of the great ideas
 of the past in relation to the values and thought of the present.   The
 readings have been selected to ensure close consideration of leading ideas
 from all periods.   Each participant also learns from the others--men and
 women of the finest qualities of mind and spirit from many walks of life.
 The Executive Seminar Program is intended to create tension between estab-
 lished  convictions and habits, and the new ideas introduced by the read-
 ings and by discussion with the other participants.   The total Program
 provides time and opportunity for reflection and informal discussion,
 combined with physical activity and relaxation.   Thus, the Program is
 designed to challenge the individual and to provide a setting for response.
