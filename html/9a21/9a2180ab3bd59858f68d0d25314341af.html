 The Kremlin's sensitivity to any notion that it will be
 negotiating from a position of weakness at the summit confer-
 ence was evident in party secretary Khrushchev's remarks at
 the 4 July reception of the American embassy in Moscow.               Soviet
 propaganda also shows continuing sensitivity to any discussion
 at Geneva of the status of the Satellites and to Western charges
 that the USSR intends to'avoid the German issue.   There are
 signs that the USSR will raise the question of pre-election
 discussions in Vietnam.

 will also avoid a flat rejection of the Geneva concept.

 The Soviet Union is expected at Geneva to seek agree-

 coexistence, and on the scheduling of a series of inter-
 national conferences on disarmament, Far Eastern issues,
 world trade, and European security.   Its most important
 new proposals are likely to relate to European security
 and to be designed to delay and limit the effectiveness
 of West German rearmament within NATO.
 DIFFERENCES ON THEORY BETWEEN MOSCOW AND PEIPING .  . .  .  .  Page 4
 The Chinese Communists since Stalin's death have been
 bolder in stating certain theories which diverge from tra-

 been trying to interpret their own position broadly enough
 to allow for the Chinese divergences.  Their' reluctance
 fully to accept Mao Tse-tung's formulations may reflect
 concern over the possibility that Peiping will emerge as
 a new doctrinal center in the Communist world.

 The     Greek Rally of Prime Minister Papagos, in power

 of a widespread desire for political change, dwindling
 popular support, and the ailing prime minister's loss of
 firm control.  A return to shifting, unstable coalition
 governments appears likely.  Greek orientation toward the
 West is not likely to be affected, but American influence
 might be reduced, and a future government would be likely
 to adopt a more independent attitude on foreign and domes-p
 tic problems.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 July 1955
 SUMMIT CONFERENCE DEVELOPMENTS
 In an apparent effort to
 demonstrate Soviet good will
 and strength on the eve of the
 Geneva conference, a large del-
 egation of Soviet Presidium
 members, including party secre-
 tary Khrushchev, appeared at
 the American embassy's Fourth
 of July reception,
 The purpose of Khrushchev's
 remarks at the reception evi-
 dently was to (1) re-emphasize
 publicly and impressively that
 the Soviet leadership is making
 a genuine effort to seek a
 detente, and (2) reverse the
 threat to the USSR's negotiat-
 ing position which would result
 from a conviction in the West
 that the recent Soviet initia-
 tives toward relaxing tensions
 stemmed from weakness?
 Soviet sensitivity to such
 Western speculation has been re-
 peatedly evidenced in propa-
 ganda and Moscow's recent con-
 ciliatory moves have apparently
 made it seem all the more im-
 portant to assert a position
 of strength.
 Khrushchev's remarks dealt
 primarily with Western comments
 about internal dissension and
 Soviet failures in industry and
 agriculture, which could not be
 refuted by the military parades
 and fly-by's recently used to
 demonstrate Soviet military
 strength.  His emphasis on
 Soviet strength and on the
 USSR's desire for a detente
 may have been intended to per-
 suade the United States, as
 well as non-Communist nations
 which might influence the
 Western negotiating position,
 that it is neces-sary to meet
 the Soviet Union halfway if
 any agreements are to be
 achieved.
 The Soviet press covered
 the press conferences of Secre-
 tary Dulles and President Eisen-
 hower on 28 and 29 June in a
 generally straightforward man-
 ner.  This treatment contrasts
 particularly with the strong
 attacks in the past on Dulles'
 statements relative to the four-
 power conference.  The quoting
 of Eisenhower's question whether
 the Soviet leader at Geneva
 would be able to make decisions
 binding on other leaders was
 most unusual.
 The President's remarks on
 the Satellite question, however,
 led to a sharper Pravda editorial
 which reflected Moscow's con-
 tinuing sensitivity to that
 issue.   Pravda approved the
 President's remarks on the need
 for following peaceful rather
 than provocative methods, but
 said that whether or not he so
 intended, the President's state-
 ment encouraged the course of
 interfering in the internal
 affairs of the People's Democ-
 racies  of Eastern Europe.
 TASS reacted sharply to
 Secretary Dulles' charge that
 the USSR apparently has lost in-
 terest in German. unification.
 It described unification as "an
 irresistible, historic tendency
 which sooner or later would find
 its way."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 July 1955
 There are increasing signs
 that the USSR will raise at
 least one Far Eastern issue--
 all-Vietnam elections--at
 Geneva.  This is the feeling of
 British and French observers in
 Saigon.  The Viet Minh is press-
 ing for the start of discus-
 sions between the two Vietnamese
 governments on 20 July con-
 cerning the 1956 elections.
 Chou En-lai gave public support
 to early negotiations during
 RECENT SOVIET BLOC
 MILITARY ACTIVITIES
 On several occasions since
 early April the Soviet Union has
 flaunted its armed strength,
 probably in an effort to im-
 press the West with the power
 of its military position.  At
 other times, however, military
 activity has seemed to support
 the Soviet diplomatic policy of
 "reasonableness" in internation-
 al affairs.
 Outside the public arena,
 the Communists continue to place
 great stress on increasing their
 military potential.

 tary coalition at Warsaw on 14
 Ho Chi Minh's Peiping visit and
 the question will certainly be
 discussed during Ho's trip to
 Moscow.
 If the USSR raises this
 issue at the summit conference,
 it is likely to charge that the
 United States is trying to block
 the Geneva agreement by influenc-
 ing the South Vietnam government
 to stall on discussions.   (See

 in propaganda as a counter to
 NATO.   The air show on 3 July,
 postponed from 19 June, was the
 largest public display of new

 On'the other hand, to sup-
 port its policy of "reasonable-
 ness," there are indications that
 the USSR is preparing to with-
 draw some of its occupation
 troops from Austria even before
 .the state treaty goes into ef-
 fect.. The first large group of
 Soviet troops is reportedly to
 be withdrawn to the Soviet "na-
 tional boundary" just prior to
 the summit conference. Other
 military displays of moderation
 include the well-publicized
 withdrawal of Soviet units
 from Port Arthur by the dead-
 line date of 31 May and the
 continued postponement of formal
 creation of an East German army.

 of regret, Molotov's action ap-

 the best of an unexpected situ-
 ation.
 Other recent bloc military
 developments, not publicly ad-
 vertised, show that despite
 current Soviet disarmament pro-
 posals, the Communists continue
 strenuous efforts to maximize
 their fighting capabilities.
 Recent improvement in of-
 fensive air power includes the
 doubling of Soviet jet light
 bomber strength in East Germany.
 Further development of Soviet
 air defense capabilities has
 been achieved by extensive air
 defense exercises and the intro-
 duction of all-weather fighters
 into Soviet units in East Ger-
 many beginning in April.
 Continuing stress on bloc
 naval power is indicated by the
 transfer of additional new cruis-
 ers                                                                             and destroyers from the
 landlocked  Baltic to the open
 waters of the Murmansk area in May.
 The reorganization, strength-
 ening and co-operation of bloc
 ground units also is progressing.
 Nearly 1,000 new-model medium
 tanks have arrived for Soviet
 divisions in Germany since Janu
 ary. This has resulted in an ac-
 tual augmentation in Soviet tank
 strength in Germany of about 25
 percent; and evidence of ..the re-
 organization of tank units indi-
 cates that the final augmentation
 is planned td. reach. about 65 percent.
 Artillery and transport are
 also being improved for these
 units. There are also preparations
 for unit expansion and equipment

 among Soviet and Satellite field
 units.

 NOTES AND COMMENTS
 Moscow Conference
 On.".toms for Peace"
 The Soviet-sponsored con-
 ference from 1 to 5 July on the,
 peaceful uses of atomic energy
 was attended on the first day
 by delegates from 17 of the 41
 invited countries.  All Sino-
 soviet bloc states except North
 Vietnam attended.   Nonbloc
 states were strongly represented
 by delegations from Egypt, Fin-
 land, India,.Israel, Japan,
 Sweden, and Yugoslavia.   There
 were indications from various
 sources that Switzerland, Nor-
 way, Iran, Austria, and the
 Netherlands would be represented
 at somo,?time during the con=
 ference.
 The presi-
 dent of; the Sov-
 iet Academy of
 Sciences said
 in ?`bis. Opening
 speech that the
 reports to be
 presented would
 not duplicate
 reports.sched-
 uled to be given
 at the UN-spon-
 sored atom con-
 ference at Gene-
 va opening on 8
 Augusta  He did
 not indicate,
 however, how the
 Moscow confer-
 ence would differ in emphasis
 or aim from the later one.  A
 four-column article in Pravda
 simply stated that the Moscow
 meetings would "contribute"to
 the Geneva meeting.
 The publicity given to
 the Moscow conference suggests
 that the USSR will achieve its
 aim of gaining a propaganda
 advantage before the August
 conference opens.  Moscow may
 also believe that the meeting
 it sponsored would offset
 gains made by the United States
 through bilateral atomic agree-
 ments and by President Eisen-
 hower's speech on 11 June
 offering reactors to various
 countries.
 It is probable that at
 least some of the scientists
 who attended the Moscow sessions
 will be shown the Soviet atom-
 driven power plant--probably
 located at Obninskoye--before
 their departure, in the hope
 that this will
 reduce the ef-
 fect of the
 American demon-
 strator reactor
 to be shown at
 the Geneva meet-
 ing,
 The scien-
 tists were shown
 a film entitled
 "The First in
 the World" about
 the Soviet power
 plant.   This is
 probably a good
 indicator of the
 type of propa
 ganda Moscow
 will promote be-
 fore and during the UN -spon-
 sored conference in August.
 The USSR will presumably  also
 use the participation of Com-
 munist China at the Moscow
 meetings as a precedent for
 seeking participation of
 Peiping in future international
 meetings on nuclear disarma-
 ment or on the use of nuclear
 energy for  peaceful purposes,

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 July 1955
 World Peace Assembly
 The World'-Peace Assembly,
 held in Helsinki from 22 to 29
 June, was used by. the USSR to
 air European security schemes
 it may offer at the summit con-
 ference.
 The unusual variety of solu-
 tions offered for achieving a
 peaceful Europe--creation of a
 collective security system re-
 placing the existing blocs,.less-
 ening of the military threat by
 Germany's leaving NATO, and Ger-
 man neutralization with an agree-
 ment as to Germany's armed
 strength--indicated that Moscow
 may have been testing European
 reaction and also maintaining
 its flexible position on a
 number of subjects it might
 raise in Geneva.
 The speakers, despite their
 attention to Germany and Euro-
 pean security, had little to say
 in detail about the problems of
 German reunification.  The
 assembly's concluding report
 did, however, link the unifica-
 tion issue with "this new under-
 standing of European security"
 which can be effected if the
 terms are such as.-to "preclude
 any possibility of a revival
 of German militarism and Ger-
 many's participation in any
 military alliance."
 The special "working com-
 mittee" created for debating
 the disarmament and atomic weap-
 ons                                 question issued a final
 report which linked nuclear weap-
 ons                                 with c  ventionai disarma-
 ment and.reiterated the disarma-
 ment provisions outlined by the
 USSR on 10 May.
 The signature campaign for
 the Vienna Appeal was mentioned
 only once, despite the great
 propaganda effort built around
 it for the past five months.
 This soft-pedaling may indicate
 a desire to avoid the obvious
 divergence which exists between
 the Vienna- Appeal's call for im-
 mediate abolition of nuclear weap-
 ons  and the more realistic and
 long-term approach to nuclear
 disarmament of the USSR's 10
 May proposals.
 Speeches during the course
 of the assembly referred to the
 "press of public opinion" rather
 than to the-vast number of signa-
 tures collected for the appeal.
 Earlier reports had indicated
 that the final results of the
 drive would be presented at
 Helsinki ------ the sole report was
 made by the Communist Chinese
 "peace partisan" Kuo Mo-jo, who
 referred to the numerical suc-
 cesses in China.  The first sta-
 tistics on the progress of the
 appeal-In the Soviet Union were
 not issued-until after the con-
 clusion of the Helsinki assembly.
 In reporting the proceed-
 ings of the conference, the Amer-
 ican embassy in Helsinki quoted
 Professor Joliot-Curie, French
 scientist--und chairman of the
 "peace movement," as stating
 flatly that "destruction of all
 life on our planet is within
 the range of technical possibil-
 ity."  Joliot-Curie made similar
 statements early this year,.which
 he had to modify to parallel the
 Soviet position that only the
 capitalist system would be de-
 stroyed by an atomic holocaust.
 Moscow's propaganda broadcast
 of this speech included only a
 reference to a "great destructive
 force" of nuclear weapons, "the'
 effect of which spreads over
 great distances and is preserved
 for a- long time."

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 July 1955
 Soviet Japanese Negotiations
 The seventh session of
 the Japanese-Soviet talks in
 London scheduled for 5 July
 was postponed for one week
 after Soviet chief negotiator
 Malik left London for consulta-
 tions in Moscow.
 Malik,  however, also  as'
 been the Soviet delegate to
 the disarmament talks in Lon-
 don and he may have been re-
 called to assist in preparing
 the Soviet position for the
 four-power Geneva meeting, as
 reported by the press.
 Reports from Austrians
 who returned from internment
 in the Soviet Union that from
 5,000 to 6,000 Japanese were
 in Soviet hands  last week in-
 creased popular indignation in
 Japan over Moscow's refusal to
 relax its position on repatria-
 tion.   As a result, demands
 for the immediate restoration
 of diplomatic relations, with
 territorial and other issues
 to be settled later, were soft-
 pedaled by the Hatoyama govern-
 ment.  The Japanese, however,
 still hope for an agreement
 with the USSR and anticipate a
 possible change in the Soviet
 position after the Geneva talks.
 The Formosa Straits --
 i ary and  o iti.ca
 The Chinese Communists
 continue to refrain from major
 military action in the Formosa
 Straits area.
 A new road is under con-
 struction which will link
 military positions on the Pei-
 ling Peninsula with the coastal
 road net running north from
 Foochow.   Supply of the penin-
 sula will be facilitated.
 There were indications
 this week of an additional
 transfer of Soviet naval vessels
 to the Chinese Communists.   Six
 minesweepers or patrol craft,
 accompanying a convoy of So-
 viet vessels en route to Japan,
 were detached from the convoy
 and continued south through
 the Tsushima Straits toward
 China.
 The apparent increase in
 Chinese Communist surface forces
 coincides with a. recent increase
 in jet bomber strength of the
 Chinese naval air force.
 BEAGLE (IL-28) jet
 g    bombers have been trans-
 ferred from the USSR to the

 late March.
 The Chinese Com-
 munist Party People's
 Daily on 2 July a-g  n
 enced "evasive"
 American statements
 on the prospects for
 direct Sino-American
 talks.   The newspaper
 also reaffirmed the
 Communist objection
 to Chinese Nationalist
 participation in any
 international confer-
 ence on Far Eastern
 issues.
 Contrary to Pei-
 ping's contention that
 it is the turn of the
 United States to make
 some concession to
 improve the atmosphere
 for either direct or
 international talks,
 Chou En-lai's inter-
 mediaries in approaches
 to Washington are ex-
 pected to tell him
 that progress is not
 likely to be made un-
 til Peiping releases
 others of the Ameri-
 cans detained in China.
 It would cost Peiping lit-
 tle to release any or all of the
 Americans, and it is not clear
 why the usually agile Chou has
 thus far moved so slowly.   He
 may believe that the relatives
 of some of the prisoners will
 yet be permitted to visit them,
 or might hope that the prisoners
 could be used for bargaining
 on some such issue as that of
 Chinese students in the United
 South Vietnam
 The Communists are intensi-
 fying their war of nerves de-
 signed to get the pre-election
 consultations specified at
 T U N G
 Chengh
 States whom Peiping wishes sent
 to Communist China, even against
 their will.
 The Communists might also
 calculate that limited military
 action in the Formosa Straits
 will increase tension and thus
 increase pressure on the United
 States for either direct talks
 or an international conference,
 without the need for further
 Communist concessions.

 While he will make clear that
 this position in no way indi-

 terms, he will also avoid a
 flat rejection of the Geneva

 are not satisfield with Diem's
 position, the USSR may raise.
 the issue at the summit con-:
 ference.
 The Viet Minh began giving
 propaganda treatment about a
 month ago to the necessity for
 strict observance of that part
 of the Geneva declaration
 which states that consultations
 between the competent authori-
 ties of the north and south
 will take place "from 20 July
 1955 onward."
 More recently two high
 Viet Minh officials, as well
 as the Soviet ambassador in
 Hanoi, are reported to have
 hinted at "violent action" in
 the south should the,consulta-
 tions be delayed.   In one case,
 this phrase was defined as a
 "popular uprising."  It is
 doubtful that there is enough
 pro-Viet Minh sentiment in the
 south to permit such threats
 to be carried out except on a
 very limited scale.
 Ho Chi Minh's visit to
 Peiping and Moscow is-well-
 timed to publicize the Commu-
 nist position on this point.
 He will arrive in Moscow about
 a week before the summit con-
 ference.   The USSR may try at
 the four-power conference to
 bring pressure on the United
 States, especially through
 Britain and France, to accept
 the Geneva timetable for elec-
 tions, and it may cite this
 problem as one of the reasons
 why a Far Eastern conference,
 with Peiping participating, is
 necessary.  Communist propa-
 ganda repeatedly has charged
 the United States with the
 intent to prevent Vietnam's
 unification.
 Meanwhile, two sticking
 points in Vietnamese relations
 with the French, the satis-
 factory resolution of which
 Diem had cited as prerequisite
 to a definition of a Vietnamese
 policy on elections, are
 apparently being cleared up.
 French officials in Paris
 report that Diem's special en-
 voy there agreed to a descrip-
 tion of the title and functions
 of Henri Hoppenot, the newly,
 designated senior French
 representative to be stationed
 in Saigon.  Hoppenot is ex-
 pected to leave Paris for
 Saigon in about a week.  The
 French also report that they
 have reached agreement with
 the Vietnamese on the general
 principles for-the transfer
 of the military command.
 Details of the transfer are
 to be settled later.
 Internally, Diem claims
 a complete victory over the
 Hoa Hao rebels.   The Vietnamese
 army has occupied the area
 formerly held by Ba Cut's
 forces.  Ba Cut's whereabouts
 is not known
 The Cao Dai sect, whose
 military commanders supported
 Diem during the spring crisis,
 is showing signs of restiveness.
 Cao Dai leaders were instru-
 mental in the formation of
 the Revolutionary Committee
 in late April and they see it
 as a device to protect their
 narrow sectarian interests.
 Two Cao Dai members of the
 committee on 5 July denounced
 most of Diem's cabinet as
 "traitors and enemies." They

 also demanded the immediate
 deposition of Bao Dai.         By
 staying ahead of Diem on
 popular issues of this
 nature, the Cao Dai hopes to
 win widespread popular sup-
 port.
 Cambodia
 The International Con-
 trol Commission in Cambodia
 is not expected to rule on
 whether the American-Cam-
 bodian military agreement
 is a violation of the Geneva
 terms until Nehru returns
 to New Delhi on 12 or 13
 July.   The Indians, rather
 than issuing a flat denun-
 ciation 3f the agreement,
 may press the United States
 to clarify certain points
 and to declare that it is
 purely defensive.
 Although Nehru's fi-
 nal position on this issue
 is not yet known, an In-
 dian Foreign Ministry offi-
 cial gave Ambassador Cooper
 the impression that India
 regarded the agreement as
 a Geneva violation.
 Cambodia's Prince
 Sihanouk told a Norwegian
 diplomat on 29 June that
 if the International Control
 Commission returns an un-
 favorable verdict on the
 military aid pact, he would
 take the issue before the
 Cambodian people and the Gene-
 va powers.   Some observers
 believe the prince actually
 would prefer the commission
 to return a negative report
 so that he would have an
 issue on which to attack
 and damage its reputation
 and lay the groundwork for
 challenging its supervision
 of the elections scheduled
 for 11 September.
 Three members of the
 Cambodian cabinet resigned
 on 30 June, after being
 given the alternative of
 leaving Prince Sihanouk's
 political "movement" or
 resigning.   Sihanouk's pri-
 mary objective in this
 maneuver is to dissociate
 his new party from the inef-
 fectual and increasingly
 unpopular government, but
 it is also possible that
 he wishes to avoid any
 further responsibility for
 the controversial militar
 aid agreement.

 Indonesian Crisis
 Indonesia's army-cabinet
 crisis, which developed on 27
 June over the installation of
 General Utoyo as the new chief
 of staff, appears about to
 become the subject of protracted
 negotiations.  Although the
 army continues united in its
 opposition to Utoyo and is
 reported to consider itself
 in a strong position, the
 collapse of the All cabinet
 appears less likely than it
 did a week ago.
 The cabinet on 2 July
 established a committee to
 deal with the situation and
 on 3 July senior army officers
 proposed an army-government=
 conference to settle the crisis.
 Debate on the motion of no
 confidence in the defense minis-
 ter, which began on 4 July, is
 scheduled to continue through
 22 July.   Two of the five inde-
 pendent members of parliament
 who introduced the motion

 Army leaders stated in
 their 3 July communique that
 the crisis should be solved
 in "accordance with the con-
 stitutional position of the
 army, which in normal times
 is subordinate to the govern-
 ment."  They demanded, however,
 that the problem of political
 versus technical leadership
 of the army be discussed and a
 line of separation between
 the two established.
 President Sukarno will
 be out of the country from
 12 July until 8 August on
 state visits and a pilgrimage
 to Mecca.   It is unlikely
 that any settlement will be
 reached during. his absence.

 has won 226 of the 268 seats
 contested in municipal and
 state elections in Malaya since
 1952.   It is the only organi-
 zation contesting all 52 seats.
 Its list of candidates, which
 highlights the country's multi-
 racial problem, includes 35
 Malays, 15 Chinese, and two
 Indians.
 The principal issues
 in the election are self-
 government and the continued
 enforcement of the state of
 emergency declared seven years
 ago..   All parties agree that
 self-government should come
 soon, preferably within four
 years and regardless of Commu-
 nist strength.   They also desire
 an early end of the emergency.
 The Alliance platform in-
 cludes an amnesty proposal under
 which Communists would be given
 the choice of becoming good
 Malayan citizens or being re-
 turned to their country of
 origin, which in many cases
 would be Communist China.
 A Communist bid for a
 negotiated settlement of the
 emergency, which was received
 in early June, was unanimously
 rejected on 23 June by the
 Operations Committee, a federal
 organization which includes
 ,Alliance representatives.
 Shortly thereafter, however,
 Alliance leaders announced they
 were willing to come to terms
 with the Communists.   Reactions
 to a second Communist bid, re-
 ceived by the Malayan Chinese
 Association, a member party of
 the Alliance, have not been
 reported.
 Anticipating Alliance pres-
 sure for a settlement after
 elections and aware that a re-
 buff of the Communist bid will
 stimulate already growing anti-
 British sentiment, British
 authorities are considering
 liberalizing the semiamnesty
 terms which already exist.
 Under present regulations,
 Communists who have committed
 no "major crimes" and who surren-
 der are rehabilitated by the
 government.   The British may try
 to incorporate in their new
 terms part of the Alliance am-
 nesty proposal which, however,
 the Communists have already
 stated is unacceptable.
 In addition to the diffi-
 culties involved in pressing
 military measures against the
 Communists while at the same
 time encouraging Malayan self-
 government, the British also

 front organization, the People's
 Action Party, which has strong
 support among student and labor
 groups, has kept the government
 off balance with a succession of
 strikes and student demands,
 accompanied in May by serious
 riots.  The People's Action
 Party had demanded the legali-
 zation of the Communist Party
 and may be expected to?seek
 acceptance of the Communist
 offer for negotiations.
 The American consul general
 in Singapore sees the distinct
 possibility that the People's
 Action Party will bring down the
 government by either parlia-
 mentary or violent means.   This
 would force the British to
 decide whether to permit the
 formation of-a People's Action-
 led government or to reinstitute
 direct colonial rule.
 Pakistan Constituent Assembly
 Convenes
 The new Constituent Assem-
 bly of Pakistan, which convened
 on 7 July, contains no clear-cut
 majority group as did its pred-
 ecessor.   The Moslem League,
 which formerly held 56 of the
 79 seats, now holds only 25.
 The next largest group is the
 United Front from East Pakistan
 with 16 seats, and the third
 is the Awami League, also repre-
 senting East Pakistan, with 12.
 Most of the delegates
 were not previously members of
 the assembly, and their views and
 personal loyalties are unknown.
 In the immediate future,
 the only firm focus of power
 in Pakistan will be Governor
 General Ghulam Mohammad and his
 three principal associates--
 Interior Minister Mirza, Finance
 Minister Chaucihuri Mohammad Ali,
 and Defense Minister Ayub.
 The governor general's ap-
 pointment on 5 July of M. A.
 Gurmani, prospective governor
 of the united West Pakistan prov-
 ince,  as temporary chairman of
 the Constituent Assembly sug-
 gests that Ghulam Mohammad hopes
 to see a coalition of Moslem
 Leaguers under Gurmani, Awami
 Leaguers under Suhrawardy, a
 few other defectors from the
 East Pakistani United Front,
 and a few Hindu minority dele-
 gates.
 If this is true, it would
 seriously weaken any hopes
 Prime Minister Mohammad Ali may
 have of leading a coalition of
 the Moslem League and the United
 Front.   It could also foreshadow
 his eventual removal from office.
 The precise nature of the
 groupings that will emerge in
 the assembly is still unclear,
 however.  The character of each
 grouping may vary not only with
 the success each faction leader
 has in increasing his following
 but also with the nature of each
 issue debated in the assembly.
 It therefore seems unlikely that

 The Cyprus Issue
 Britain's invitation.of
 30 June to Greece and Turkey
 for a general discussion of
 "eastern Mediterranean" prob-
 lems  is the first step toward
 a new approach to the Cyprus
 dispute since the British offer
 of a limited constitution in
 July 1954.
 Both Turkey and Greece
 have agreed to meet in London
 after the Big Four meeting.  By
 making the invitation publicly
 and in deliberately vague terms,
 Britain effectively forced an
 acceptance from Greece, which
 had pressed last summer for
 bilateral talks on Cyprus but
 was known to be reluctant to
 sit down with'Turkey on the
 subject.   At the same time,
 however, Britain has reversed
 its own previous stand that

 Pakistani eyes.
 Should Ghulam Mohammad do
 this, he would probably have much
 less public support and would
 experience much greater criticism
 than he did in October 1954.  Con-
 sidering his precarious state of
 health and the paucity of strong
 men capable of upnoiding his views,
 this weakening of central control
 might in the long run be accom-
 panied by a weakening of American
 influence in Pakistan or by such
 outspoken criticism of a pro-
 American oligarchic clique as to
 discredit the United States in
 Cyprus was a purely internal
 question.
 Britain appears primarily
 interested in trying to end the
 present impasse on the Cyprus
 problem.    In the present state
 of public opinion in Greece,
 Athens, like the Greek Cypriotes,
 insists that enosis--uni?n
 with Greece--is the only polit-
 ical  solution that can be con-
 sidered.   Britain to date has
 refused to entertain any sug-
 gestion that its sovereignty
 be surrendered.
 London probably now hopes
 that a breathing space can be
 obtained during which it could
 at least discuss the constitu-
 tional offer of last July with
 leading Cypriotes. It probably
 also hopes to deter Greece from

 In Algeria, mass arrests
 and military action in the rebel

 of the country have not stopped

 East Germans Seek Separate
 Talks on Trade and Highway Tolls
 While harassment tactics
 directed against West Berlin
 have continued at a low level,
 the East German government has
 broken the agreement it made on
 14 June to meet West German
 representatives in a joint dis-
 cussion of trade and highway
 toll questions and has called
 for separate talks on the two
 issues.
 At a meeting with West
 German trade officials on 1
 July, the representative of the
 East German Ministry of Foreign
 and Internal German trade urged
 resumption of trade talks but
 also said the bombing of the US
 Information Service and the dud
 bomb found at the residence of
 an American vice consul in Tunis
 were the acts of die-hard French
 elements.
 In reporting these inci-
 dents, the French-language press
 has made irresponsible accusa-

 and implied that the USIS bombing
 was designed to prevent the dis-
 tribution of "tendentious lit-

 Berlin's Mayor Ebert declared
 on 26 June that East Berlin
 municipal authorities will hold
 discussions only at the political

 Suhr has previously stated that
 political talks are out of the

 broke off transport talks by
 unilaterally issuing new lower
 toll rates on 10 June. They are

 The cabinet announced by

 July promises little in the
 way of positive achievement.
 It will probably serve merely
 as a caretaker government and
 may fall even before general
 elections now being considered
 for spring 1956.
 To preserve former premier
 Scelba's quadripartite arrange-

 Social Democrats, and Liberals
 in the cabinet with parliamen-

 ficed his reform program in a
 compromise with the rightist
 Christian Democrats who caused
 Scelba's downfall.  These
 offer of 12,000,000 marks an-

 West German experts to. be the
 Federal Republic's equitable
 share for maintaining the roads

 Bonn may be willing to pay
 as high as 18,000,000 marks an-

 press an interest in this line
 of negotiation.  Bonn officials
 may also attempt discussion of
 adjusting rail freight rates to
 Berlin to make them more competi-
 tive with truck rates, In ad-
 dition it is planned to inquire
 into East German needs for rail
 and truck spare parts, which are
 in critically short supply in
 East Germany.

 Support of the Social Demo-

 Saragat as vice premier and
 their representatives Vigorelli
 and Romita as ministers of

 Argentine Situation
 President Peron's highly
 conciliatory speech of 5 July
 appeared designed to propitiate
 both opposition and Peronista
 Party circles.   Unrest in these
 circles has been abetted by the
 unusual delay in announcing
 new cabinet members and by the
 behind-the-scenes power struggle
 in which military elements ap-
 pear still dominant.
 Peron's speech emphasized
 the need for an end to "polit-
 ical  strife" and for "coexist-
 ence with the opposition,"
 which, he said, was now voicing
 demands for "peace and under-
 standing among Argentines for
 the first time in many years."
 He absolved the traditional
 shipping interests.  As Segni's
 interior minister, he could
 compromise internal security
 by making profitable deals with
 the Communists. Gonella, a
 long-time education minister
 and devout churchman, can, as
 minister without portfolio in
 the cabinet, checkmate the
 activities of Rossi, the Social
 Democratic education minister
 appointed to appease the anti-
 clerical minor parties of the
 cabinet.
 Segni will present his cabi-

 of Deputies next week and to the
 Senate two weeks hence.   While

 Adds to Unrest in Ecuador
 President Velasco's han-

 strike, which began on 30 June
 in Ecuador, will probably
 aggravate existing political
 tension and stimulate the grow-

 Velasco, who has called
 the strike a "political attack
 against the regime," has been
 granted broad emergency powers
 by the Council of State.   He
 has called for dissolution of
 the railway union and has at-
 tacked the press for failing to
 condemn the strike movement and
 not supporting the government.

 to duty on 4 July, pending a

 were announced on 23 June is
 still not clear and other
 changes are rumored.   The re-
 placement of the controversial
 subsecretary of  press and

 reported demand of the military.
 Tension will probably
 continue until there is more
 public evidence that the govern-

 important political questions,
 such as the cabinet composi-

 in general, as well as the sta-

 in Ecuador, he should respect
 it.    They contend that many
 workers have gone without pay for
 four months.   The railway union
 is insisting on the payment of all
 back wages, the release of all

 an increase in the freight
 rate for gasoline.  This last
 demand is strongly opposed by
 the powerful chauffeurs' union
 and other labor organizations.

 PATTERNS AND PERSPECTIVES
 SOVIET OBJECTIVES AT THE SUMMIT CONFERENCE
 The Soviet Union is ex-
 pected at Geneva to seek agree-
 ment on a set of general prin-
 ciples of peace, security and
 coexistence, and on the sched-
 uling of a series of interna-
 tional conferences on disarma-
 ment, Far Eastern issues,
 world trade, and European secu-
 rity.   Its most important new.
 proposals are likely to relate
 to European security and to
 be designed to delay and limit
 the effectiveness of West
 German rearmament within NATO.
 Progress toward an improve-
 ment in international rela-
 tions could prove a twofold
 advantage for the USSR.   If
 Moscow is able to convince the
 non-Communist world that it
 sincerely desires to settle at
 least some outstanding issues,
 the West might relax its
 defense efforts.  This in turn
 would reduce the pressure on
 the Orbit for a military build-
 up and permit Soviet leaders
 to give more attention to
 domestic problems and to shift
 more resources to heavy indus-
 try and agriculture.
 Moscow's evident eagerness
 to appear conciliatory does
 not mean it is willing to
 appear to give in under Western
 pressure to prove its good
 faith.   Recent Soviet propa-
 ganda. on the Austrian settle-
 ment, the Adenauer invitation,
 the mission to Belgrade, and
 the Malik disarmament plan has
 sought to place the burden on
 the West to show what it is
 willing to do to end the cold
 war.
 This may indicate that the
 USSR will offer only a minimum
 of concessions at Geneva, sav-
 ing further offers for later,
 more detailed negotiations.
 In any case, Moscow apparently
 wants to avoid a stalemate at
 this time.
 Nevertheless, the USSR
 has stressed that it expects
 to be met halfway, and that
 it feels it will be negotiating
 from a position,of strength.
 The Geneva. Agenda
 Although there is general
 agreement that the agenda
 of the conference will be an
 open one, Moscow has made it
 clear what issues it thinks
 should command attention.
 Molotov told the foreign
 ministers at Vienna that the
 heads of government should dis-
 cuss disarmament, the atomic
 question, a five-power con-
 ference, and European security,
 as well as the general reduc-
 tion of tension.
 A TABS statement on
 agenda topics on 13 June, which
 has been reflected in propa-
 ganda since, included disarma-
 ment, the atomic questions,
 Asian and Far East peace and
 security, Communist China's
 "rights" in the UN, and Euro-
 pean_security.
 All the Far Eastern
 questions which Moscow and
 Peiping have identified as
 outstanding could obviously be
 included in the TABS category.
 The Communists presumably feel
 these questions should be dis-
 cussed at a later conference
 including Communist China.
 The Soviet disarmament
 plan as an agenda topic would
 cover a broad list of measures
 which Moscow states would en-
 gender the "trust between states"
 needed to make a disarmament
 program work, but not clear-
 ly  labeled as prerequisites

 to any progress on disarmament.
 The plan calls for a ban on
 war propaganda, troop with-
 drawal from Germany, the aban-
 donment of foreign bases, shar-
 ing of atomic energy for peace-
 ful purposes, settlement of Far
 gastern questions, and expan-
 sion of international economic
 and cultural relations.
 The omission of German uni-
 fication in the Soviet comments
 on the Geneva agenda suggests
 that Moscow wishes to avoid
 this question at the July con-
 ference and to leave it to
 representatives from the two
 German states or to later
 talks with Adenauer.
 Specific Soviet Objectives
 Moscow probably does not
 expect any major issues to be
 settled at Geneva.   It will
 probably seek a heads-of-
 government agreement on some
 basic principles and on the
 nature of future meetings to
 explore the details of issues.
 The USSR will presumably
 attempt to gain the maximum
 publicity for its proposals
 and to present them in as
 attractive a form as possible.
 It could be expected to use
 any agreement reached, however
 general, on peace, security,
 or coexistence as "proof" that
 the Vest was "forced" by pub-
 lic opinion to accept the prin-
 ciples Moscow has been so
 loudly proclaiming.
 Furthermore,  the USSR
 will probably seek agreement
 on other meetings on terms
 favorable to it.       A conference
 of five, six, or even ten or
 more powers, including Commu-
 nist China, would be intended
 to serve Moscow's purposes
 by enhancing Peiping's pres-
 tige and putting pressure on
 the United States to with-
 draw or modify its support of
 Nationalist China.  Peiping
 has frequently indicated that
 it would welcome such a con-
 ference.
 The Soviet leaders appar-
 ently hope the substantive pro-
 posals on the Far East can be
 postponed for a separate con-
 ference including Communist
 China.  They may, however,
 try at Geneva to define the Far
 Eastern problems to be.discussed
 at such a later conference or
 seek reaffirmation of previous
 agreements, such as that for
 elections in Indochina.
 On world disarmament, the
 USSR may seek agreement to
 make the plan presented by
 Malik on 10 May the "basis for
 discussion" in further sessions
 of the UN disarmament subcom-
 mittee.   It is not likely to
 offer any major changes in
 this plan at Geneva.
 Moscow will apparently
 also seek a world economic
 conference.   It presumably
 expects that such a conference
 would concentrate on the
 removal of restrictions on
 trade in strategic goods.
 The Soviet Union will prob-
 ably make new proposals on
 European security and try again
 to get agreement on a meeting,
 probably including both German
 states as well as all other
 European countries, to discuss
 its plan and any the West
 might care to present.
 European security is the
 issue on which important new
 Soviet proposals are most
 likely to be made at Geneva.
 A more promising plan than
 those offered in the past
 would seem necessary to induce
 the Western countries to agree
 to attend a European security
 conference in the future.
 European Security
 European security is a
 useful topic from Moscow's point
 of view because of the wide
 interest in the subject and
 because it can make proposals
 on this without necessarily
 endangering its control over
 East Germany.  Nevertheless, it

 will-be difficult for the USSR
 to devise a formula which has
 a wide appeal in Europe and
 which at the.same time serves
 the Soviet aim of undermining
 the American military position.
 To convince a great number of
 Europeans that the Americans
 should leave may require much
 greater evidence than Moscow
 is willing to offer of its
 willingness to pull back its
 ,forces and loosen its control
 in Eastern Europe.
 Moscow must make a choice
 between a security system which
 replaces NATO, WEU and the~War-
 saw organization and one which
 is simply an agreement between
 the existing blocs.
 An interbloc agreement
 would presumably give Moscow
 a voice in settling maximum
 arms limits for Western Europe
 and particularly Germany.   It
 would probably include explic-
 itly or implicitly a guarantee
 of the Satellite states against
 attack or subversion, which
 would be of some value to the
 USSR.  Moscow probably would
 also insist on a specific
 guarantee of the existing state
 frontiers.
 Such an agreement by it-
 self would be inadequate from
 Moscow's point of view, however,
 because it would leave American
 troops and bases in Europe
 and the Western defense system--
 including Vest Germany--funda-
 mentally unchanged.
 There can be no doubt that
 the USSR favors dissolution of
 the existing groupings as the
 best way of destroying the
 effectiveness of the Western
 defense system.  The original
 Molotov security plan presented
 in February 1954 would have
 abolished EDC and NATO, although
 it was later amended to permit
 the continuation of NATO--a
 NATO diluted.by the inclusion
 of the USSR.  The Warsaw pact
 provides for,its own dissolution
 if an all-European organization
 is set up.
 A third possibility would
 be a Soviet attempt to set up
 a series of small regional
 groupings, which would gradu-
 ally undermine NATO.  The firm-
 est evidence of such a tactic
 is a series of Soviet sugges-
 tions to Greek and Yugoslav
 officials favoring a Greek-
 Yugoslav-Turkish-Bulgarian
 entente.   Soviet approaches to
 Norwegian officials extolling
 the neutral belt concept could
 foreshadow an attempt to
 break Norway and Denmark away
 from NATO.  These peripheral
 erosion tactics, however,
 would not meet the heart of
 the Soviet problem--undermin-
 ing Germany's contribution to
 NATO.
 Troop Withdrawal
 Whatever form the Soviet
 plan for European security takes,
 it will be accompanied by a
 plan for troop withdrawal and
 abandonment of bases, already
 foreshadowed in Soviet pro-
 posals dating back to the
 Berlin conference early last
 year.  As a minimum this would
 involve the withdrawal of all
 except strictly limited con-
 tingents of occupation troops
 from Germany.  American troop
 withdrawal has a high priority
 among Soviet objectives, but
 it would have little European
 support unless matched by the
 USSR.  This would involve some
 risk for the USSR in East
 Germany, its extent depending
 on how many Soviet troops
 remained and whether any accom-
 panying security plan guaran-
 teed Soviet control of East
 Germany.
 To achieve American troop
 withdrawal and base abandon-
 ment in most or all of Europe,
 the USSR might offer troop
 withdrawal from the other
 Satellites.  However, it has
 never endorsed the plan orig-
 inated by a Communist meeting
 in Warsaw in February for
 Soviet troop withdrawal from
 Germany and Poland to match
 Western troop withdrawal from

 DIFFERENCES ON THEORY BETWEEN MOSCOW AND PEIPING
 The Chinese Communists
 since Stalin's death have been
 bolder in stating certain
 theories which diverge from
 traditional Soviet views. So-
 viet theorists have apparently
 been trying to interpret their
 own position broadly enough to
 allow for the Chinese diver-
 gences.  Their reluctance fully
 to accept Mao Tse-tung's formu-
 lations may reflect concern
 over the possibility that
 Peiping will emerge as a new
 doctrinal center in Asia.
 Differences in the Soviet
 and Chinese positions emerged
 when Peiping claimed in 1953
 that the task of "building
 socialism" in China was at
 hand.  Whereas Peiping announced
 this transition period in
 August 1953 and initiated a
 major propaganda campaign on
 this subject in October of that
 year, Moscow did not fully

 April 1954.

 disarmament issues are closely

 Moscow would insist that a limit

 also indicate that Moscow con-

 part of the Soviet disarmament
 plan--as essential to any agree-

 The Soviet delegation at

 with painting the attractive
 outlines of a European security
 plan in order to achieve a

 be saved for later.   Whatever
 the timing, Moscow will find it
 difficult to present a plan

 Eastern Europe to a greater
 extent than it desires.

 7 July 1955
 Soviet and Chinese Com-
 munist comment has consistently
 differed in treating two
 aspects of the "transition to
 socialism" question.         These
 are the nature of state power
 and the right of any Communist
 state to adopt a fundamentally
 different form of transition.
 Mao Tse-tung had in 1940
 rejected the "dictatorship of
 the proletariat" as a type of
 state inappropriate for "semi-
 colonial and colonial" coun-
 tries.   He had advocated
 instead a new transitional
 form, a "joint dictatorship
 of several revolutionary
 classes."  With the establish-
 ment of his government in 1949,
 he proclaimed a "people's
 democratic dictatorship"
 which preserved the fiction
 of multiclass government.
 This concept oz a postrevolu-
 tionary regime had no precedent
 in Soviet Communist theory.
 Since the proclamation of
 the "transition to socialism"
 in 1953, Chinese theorists have
 stated that the "people's demo-
 cratic dictatorship" is the Po-
 litical structure of the Chinese
 state necessary for advancing
 to socialism.  The Soviet view
 of the absolute necessity for
 the "dictatorship of the prole-
 tariat" as the state form for a
 "people's democracy" building
 socialism--a well-established
 principle of Soviet Communist
 theory--has not been discussed
 by'Chinese writers.
 Soviet theoretical dis-
 cussions, however, have asserted
 the inseparability of the concept
 of the dictatorship of the prole-
 tariat from the concept of the
 transition to socialism.  Recent
 Soviet comment, trying to evade
 rather than to solve the prob-
 lem, has blurred the distinction
 by expanding the definition of
 the dictatorship of the prole-
 tariat to include variant forms.
 Chinese Communist writers
 have claimed that the "method"
 as well as the form of China's
 transition would differ from
 that of the Soviet Union and
 the "people's democracies."
 One theorist explicitly asserted
 that Mao had "discovered" a new
 way for China's transition when
 he propounded'the theory of the
 "New Democracy."  This term re-
 ferred to the Chinese approach
 to both the political struc-
 ture and the economy in transi-
 tion.
 For their part, Soviet
 theorists, in discussing the
 forms of transition, have used
 a new formula which is vague
 enough to embrace Chinese devel-
 opment, without conceding that
 the Chinese are following an in-
 dependent road.
 They have insisted on the
 essential uniformity of the
 progress of all "people's
 democracies" toward socialism,
 that "in essence" the variations
 in forms are alike.  They strong-
 ly imply, however, that "all
 theories about the 'independent'
 roads of the historical develop-
 ment of the countries of people's
 democracy" are heresies, as the
 theory of the Soviet revolution
 is held to be the model for all
 socialist revolutions.
 There is no practical
 difference between the Chinese
 "people's democratic dictator-
 ship" and the orthodox Soviet
 "dictatorship of the proletar-
 iat"--power is as exclusively
 held by the Communist Party of
 China as by the Communist par-
 ties of the Soviet Union and
 its Satellites.
 The question, therefore,
 of What Peiping decided to call
 its regime may seem to be aca-
 demic.  However, Chinese Com-
 munist writers may have adhered
 to Mao's special views for two
 practical reasons!
 First, to increase Pei-
 ping's prestige as a seminal
 source of doctrinal interpreta-
 tion Among Communist movements
 in "backward noncapitalist"
 countries. "

 Second, to keep Mao's
 theories in circulation rather
 than to remain satisfied with
 tributes accorded him in the
 Soviet encyclopedia,
 The Chinese are apparently
 acting on the assumption that
 since Mao is one of the formu-
 lators of Marxist-Leninist doc-
 trine as applied to Asian con-
 ditions, his formulations can
 be used to increase Peiping's in-
 fluence among Asian Communists.
 The Kremlin is presumably
 anxious to preserve its position
 as the only effective source of
 Communist doctrine and guidance.
 At the present time, however,
 the Russians may not feel able
 to challenge Mao's theory
 .openly.
 Thus Soviet leaders may be
 working to limit the circulation
 of Mao's doctrine and at the
 same time to dissociate the
 Kremlin from it.  It may be, tob,
 that the Soviet ambassador to
 Peiping since December 1953,
 Pavel Yudin, an outstanding
 theorist and onetime editor of
 the Cominform journal, has
 been working to prevent
 further divergencies in Soviet
 and Chinese formulations.

 HUNGARIAN REGIME ATTEMPTING TO TIGHTEN CONTROLS
 Since the beginning of
 March, when the Hungarian
 Worker's Party central committee
 published its sharp attack on
 "rightist deviation," the Hun-
 garian regime has sought to
 mitigate the apathy and weak
 discipline which have been
 characteristic of the party
 membership during the past
 two years.
 The "orthodox" leadership
 under party first secretary
 Rakosi has laid the blame for
 political indifference and
 economic stagnation on"rightist"
 dependence on economic con-
 cessions to gain popular sup-
 port.   The promoters of this
 "liberal" policy are accused
 of having depreciated the
 leading position of the party
 and neglecting the traditional
 Socialist goals of industriali-
 zation and collectivization.
 By intensively propagandiz-
 ing these goals among the party
 rank and file and emphasizing
 class warfare, vigilance and
 the power of the regime to
 enforce labor discipline, the
 party leadership hopes to create
 new enthusiasm among party
 members and to strengthen its
 control over the population.
 The central committee is de-
 manding more active leadership
 by the party rank and file in
 enforcing its directives among
 all segments of the population.
 Party control over all
 mass organizations is being
 tightened.   Steps are being
 taken to transform the Patriotic
 People's Front, which was re-
 vitalized by former premier
 Nagy to gain broad nonparty
 support for the regime program,
 into an overt arm of the party.
 The leadership is also acting
 to strengthen party control
 over the youth movement, which
 the Nagy group is accused of
 having tried to wean away from
 the party, and is sending out

 thousands of activists to
 strengthen the party's ad-
 mittedly weak control in the
 villages.
 The regime is apparently
 again resorting to the threat
 of police terror to eliminate
 open expressions of opposition
 fostered by the "liberalism"
 of the past two years.  There
 has been a notable increase in
 the arrest of kulaks, and
 pressure against the church is
 increasing.   Draconic measures
 are apparently being prepared
 to eliminate widespread petty
 economic offenses.
 The American legation be-
 lieves that a "show trial"
 intended to implicate it in
 "'antiregime   activities" is
 imminent.   One purpose of such
 a trial would be to impress the
 population with the need for
 increased vigilance against
 both internal and external
 "enemies."
 Similarly, the regime is
 reintroducing harsh measures
 to-enforce strict fulfillment
 of crop delivery quotas by the
 peasants.   It has also renewed
 the collectivization drive--
 neglected since July 1953--for
 the expressed purpose of making
 the socialized sector of agri-
 culture predominant by 1960.
 The regime has proclaimed that
 it intends to depend on
 "political enlightenment and
 persuasion" to foster "volun-
 tary" collectivization, but it
 will have to resort to force
 in order to obtain its goals
 in the face of certain peasant
 resistance.
 A return to the pre-1953
 policy of intimidation and
 coercion will undoubtedly in-
 crease popular resistance,
 especially since recent Soviet
 moves have produced widespread
 hope for an easing of Communist
 controls in the near future.
 Worker and peasant resentment
 would result in a deepening of
 the economic crisis and the
 political chaos which the
 regime is seeking desperately
 to overcome.
 A number of Hungarian
 leaders, including Premier
 Hegedus, appear to recognize
 this and to hope to find a
 middle course of action.  They
 have emphasized that they
 'must not repeat the mistakes
 so often committed before
 June 1953."
 For practical reasons, in-
 tensive development of agricul-
 ture and a less ambitious
 program for development of
 heavy industry must continue
 to form the basis of the
 regime's economic policy as
 they have for the past two
 years.  However, construction
 of the ambitious socialist
 industrial complexes, which
 Nagy was accused of having
 abandoned, is now being con-
 tinued at a modest pace, and
 strong pressure is being
 exerted to force industrial
 workers to increase labor
 productivity and cut production
 costs.
 In an effort to gain popu-
 lar support for the regime's
 program, younger, locally
 trained leaders such as Premier
 Hegedus and Vice Premier Hidas
 will probably assume increasing
 predominance in the leadership.
 These younger men are not specifi-
 cally attached to' either the
 Nagy or Rakosi party cliques
 and so might be able to gain
 more active support from the
 party rank and file, which
 has been badly confused and
 demoralized by the vacillations
 in party policy caused by the
 struggle between these two
 groups.
 First Secretary Rakosi,
 whose party prestige and power
 were seriously challenged by
 his action against Nagy in
 March, may gradually take a
 less public part in the regime,
 although. he will probably con-
 tinue to exert considerable:
 influence from behind the
 scenes.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 July 1955
 Budapest is rife with ru-
 mors of impending changes.
 These stem primarily from the
 high level of excitement and
 hope engendered by the unex-
 pected Soviet moves in Austria
 and Yugoslavia.
 Speculation concerning the
 reduction of Rakosi's influence
 is as widespread in Budapest
 as it was last fall,.but there
 is no evidence to support rumors
 that he has lost the support
 of the Kremlin which has so
 often enabled him to weather
 periods of political crises in
 the past.
 In similar fashion, rumors
 that Hegedus' position is weak
 are based simply on his absence
 from the limelight since 8 June,
 and are not supported by fact.
 He is believed to be still in
 Moscow, where he attended a re-
 ception for Nehru on 9 June.
 His agricultural policy speech
 on 7 June has been quoted
 extensively by the Hungarian
 press as recently as 2 July.
 POLITICAL TRENDS IN GREECE
 The Greek Rally of Prime
 Minister Papagos, in power
 since November 1952, is grad-
 ually disintegrating because
 of a widespread desire for po-
 litical change, dwindling
 popular support, and the ailing
 prime minister's loss of firm
 control.
 There is a drift toward
 the usual Greek pattern of
 political instability, and a
 return to shifting, unstable
 coalition governments appears
 likely.
 The Rally, a political
 grouping brought together by
 Papagos in 1951, depends on
 his personal leadership to
 harmonize; its competing fac-
 tions.  Lacking such leader-
 ship from Papagos, the party
 may not be able to resist frag-
 mentation much longer.
 The Rally retains 212 of
 the 300 parliamentary seats,
 but large blocs are controlled
 by individual political leaders
 and, in the absence of firm
 control by Papagos, loyalties
 are not binding.  Newspaper
 publisher Dimitrios Lambrakis,
 who claims to control 40 depu-
 ties, has been promoting an
 alliance of the Liberal Party,
 the progressive Party, and the
 Rally faction led by Foreign
 Minister Stephanopoulos.
 The leading contender
 for succession to Papagos as
 leader of the Rally is Constan-
 tine Karamanlis, minister of
 public works.  He is reported
 to be favored by the palace,
 but he has few supporters among
 the professional politicians.
 The foreign minister and the
 defense minister are also bid-
 ding for the chance to succeed
 Papagos.
 The opposition is also
 wracked by dissension.  How-
 ever, it has two advantages:
 first,..it is able to attack
 without being vulnerable for
 recent political acts; second,
 it consists of tightly organized
 political machines.   The princi-
 pal urban centers are dominated
 by anti-Rally administrations,
 and instances of corruption
 among Rally mayors will proba-
 bly strengthen sentiment against
 that party.

 CURRENT INTELLIGENCE WEEKLY SUMMARY
 7 July 1955
 The newly created Liberal
 Democratic Union of Sophocles
 Venizelos is now the largest
 opposition party, with 24
 deputies.   It probably will
 gain further strength by defec-
 tions from the nearly moribund
 Progressive Union of the Center
 (EPEK) and the Liberals.   In
 new elections, Venizelos might
 also get informal support from
 the Communist-front United
 Democratic Left (EDA).
 National elections are not
 mandatory until November 1956,
 but the death or withdrawal of
 Papagos from active politics
 would bring about earlier elec-
 tions.   Sentiment for a change
 in the electoral law is becom-
 ing stronger. It is uncertain
 how far the trend will go away
 from the present majority sys-
 tem, which gives the party
 winning a plurality of the
 votes a disproportionately
 large number of seats.
 It is not likely that any
 new government will command a
 majority comparable to that
 won by the Rally in 1952.   The
 present trend suggests that
 no party will obtain a clear
 majority in the next election
 and that a coalition government
 of center and left-of-center
 groups will result.
 The political outlook is
 for intensified jockeying for
 position among the Rally fac-
 tions and in the opposition
 groups.   The Rally government
 will probably be followed by a
 less conservative coalition.
 Greek orientation toward
 the West is not likely to be
 affected, but American influence
 might be reduced and a future
 government would be likely to
 adopt a more independent atti-
 tude on foreign and domestic
 problems.
 Instability in Greece
 would throw an additional defense
 burden on Turkey, according to
 Menderes, who apparently fears
 that the Balkan alliance would
 be weakened and Greece would not
 be able to support NATO fully.
 The American embassy in Athens,
 however, points out that in
 periods of political insta-
 bility, Greece has managed to'
 maintain an adequate defense
 posture.
