 It is a function of the Strategic Warning Staff to conduct research into
 the methodology of strategic warning analysis.  This research report
 constitutes an effort to advance methodology by attempting to refine the
 contexts that provide meaning to conventional indicators during a crisis.  The
 basic approach herein is to test through case study the hypothesis that a
 government's behavior at various times in a crisis can be best predicted by
 researching and analyzing the process of policy management used by that
 nation.  While actual situations influence and vary the types, ti"n , and
 execution of moves, the underlying process continues to govern.
 This study illustrates that China's handling of it's Dutch-US problem in
 1980 and early 1981 conformed to its handling of a variety of past crises, as
 researched by certain academic authorities, most notably Alan S. Whiting in
 The Chinese Calculus of Deterrence.  In that respect, this study tends to
 verify the conclusion reached by Whiting and others that the Chinese
 government displays highly consistent behavioral patterns in managing foreign
 relations problems.  Beyond that, the analysis is compelling that a structured
 process is discernible and was applied against the Dutch, and, through them,
 the US.  Recognition and understanding of such a process constitute a
 potentially important breakthrough in warning analysis methodology that should
 facilitate earlier and less ambiguous warning of intentions and actions.
 This research report is the product of the Strategic Warning Staff and has
 not been coordinated with the rest of the intelligence community.  Comments
 were solicited and incorporated at the discretion of the Strategic Warning
 Staff.  The author of the report is                       Defense Intelligence
 Agency, to whom questions or comments should be addressed.

 Chinese Policy Management Methods: The Netherlands-US Case
 SUMMARY
 In contrast to the decade of the 1970's when Sino-Dutch relations rather
 languished, the 1980's began auspiciously.  A number of cabinet or sub-cabinet
 level visits occurred, prospects for increased cooperation seemed good,
 commerce was developing and Dutch Prime Minis77
 an Agt concluded a
 successful visit to China in November 1980. Precisely a month after the Prime Minister's visit, relations with China
 entered a deep freeze because of a Dutch cabinet decision to grant an export
 license to a shipyard constructing two submarines for Taiwan.  About six
 months after that decision, relations between the two were reduced to an
 exchange of bureaux d'affaires.  China also began taking other retaliatory

 The Chinese were caught off-guard by the apparent Dutch perfidy and
 brought the Dutch problem rapidly to a head.  The precision and regularity of
 Chinese actions, their speed and timing and the rapid movement of the incident
 suggest that management followed a standard format or procedure.  More
 importantly, China's overall management closely paralleled its handling of
 vastly different, more complex and more protracted crises in the past.  0
 Mid-way through the process Beijing began to stress that only outside
 influences could have made the Dutch act so uncharacteristically. Implicitly
 in the early stages of the problem, but more explicitly as it evolved, the
 Netherlands emerged as a pawn in a larger but different process of Chinese
 damage control, aimed at instructing other nations, most prominently the US,
 about the relationship of China's united front strategy to other enduring
 Chinese strategic interests.  In brief, the Netherlands episode was an

 By applying and extending research done by Alan S. Whiting and others
 with respect to past crises (1962 Taiwan Strait; 1961 Sino-Indian War;. 1967
 Chinese involvement in North Vietnam), it is possible to discern and describe
 at least two types of crisis that the Chinese perceive and the corresponding
 management mode for each crisis.  The Chinese apparently saw both the
 Netherlands and the US as reneging.on their commitments to "one China" by
 permitting or threatening to permit the sale of major new arms to Taiwan.
 Differences in the stage of government action and Chinese interests dictated
 different responses to each government.

 With respect to the Dutch, China faced abruptly an almost final adverse
 government action in the form of the export license. It reacted in a standard
 deterrent mode, seeking to prevent finalization of the license decision or
 obtain its reversal by threatening the costs that China would impose on the
 Netherlands if the action were not reversed. The deterrent strategy included
 three steps: damage assessment and control, delivery of an ultimatum, and
 execution of the threat.  China's ultimate execution of the threat evidenced
 the failure of this strategy at this st ugh there is some prospect that
 the submarines may never reach Taiwan.
 With respect to the US, China's concern stemmed largely from statements
 about Taiwan made during and since the US Presidential election campaign. The
 absence of any overt, adverse governmental act that genuinely nullified, as
 opposed to only threatened, prospects for achieving Chinese goals with the US
 (cooperation against the Soviets and for Chinese modernization) enabled China
 to commence an initiatory management mode.  The key aim was to bind the US
 firmly to what the Chinese consider US commitments to "one China" by means of
 demonstrations of the mutual advantages in the relationship and communication
 of the limit to the costs that China was prepared to sustain.  This mode also
 seems to have three phases which can be described as "cultivation," lock-in to

 DISCUSSION
 Although the Netherlands was one of the first European nations to
 recognize the Peoples Republic in 1950, it enjoyed little strategic importance
 for China, compared to other nations of Western Europe.  Ambassadors were
 exchanged in 1972, but even as late as 1978 a visit by Foreign Minister Huang
 Hua was analyzed as "pro forma."  The trend to improve relations in the 1980's
 came mostly at China's initiative as part of its effort to implement the
 united front strategy by encouraging NATO nations to stand firm against the
 USSR in an unpredictable era.
 Prospects for economic or other assistance from the Dutch were hamstrung
 by Dutch bewilderment over what large China could hope to obtain from small
 Holland.  Nevertheless, the Chinese leadership was prepared to leave no
 European stone unturned in seekina sources of low interest loans, project aid
 and technological advances.
 Prime Minister van Agt's 28 October to 4 November 1980 visit to China was
 the first ever by a Dutch prime minister.  Strategic issues apparently
 dominated discussions, van Agt received highest-level treatment and audiences,
 and the two countries signed agreements on economic and technical coopen
 and cultural cooperation.  Both sides considered the visit successful. r,atiO
 Damage Assessment and Control  (29 Nov 80 - 2 Jan 81)
 The turning point was 29 November when the export license was granted to
 Rijn-Schelde-Verolme (RSV), the Dutch shipbuilder, and made public.  A
 chronology of this phase follows.
 23-29 November 1980      News of the submarine negotiations appeared
 in the Netherlands press.
 29 November              The Netherlands government granted an export
 license to RSV for two submarines to be
 constructed for Taiwan.
 29 November 1980         China recalled a delegation to the Netherlands led by
 Vice Communications Minister Guo Jian.
 3 December 1980          China conveyed a strong diplomatic protest to the
 Netherlands over the 29 November decision.  The text
 was not published.  A strong response but no specific
 action was threatened.
 sources in Beijing were said to
 have leaked news o  the protest note to Agence France
 Presse, (AFP) Hong Kong.

 Two articles in China's English-language press were
 the first public references to the Dutch crisis; the
 Chinese protest was not mentioned.
 5 December 1980          Renmin Ribao published in Chinese a "reader's letter"
 regretting the Netherlands action.  This was the first
 propaganda move to inform the Chinese public of the
 crisis.
 18 December 1980         The Dutch Parliament approved the government decision
 by a margin of two votes.
 2 January 1981           China issued a second diplomatic protest threatening
 to recall its ambassador, send the Netherlands
 ambassador home, and to down rade relations to the
 level of charge d'affaires.
 An initial question for analysis is whether the Chinese were genuinely
 caught off guard or whether they feigned surprise in a charade whose outcome
 was foreordained so as to provide a lesson to Western countries.  The evidence
 argues strongly in favor of a measure of surprise.  RSV's negotiations with
 Taiwan began in mid-August 1980.  In the ensuing months, all sources disclosed
 no hint the Chinese knew of the contract negotiations before late November.
 Additionally, Dutch delegations visiting China between August and November
 1980 were well received and given suitably favorable publicity and
 treatment.  The most compelling evidence of Chinese surprise is a Xinhua wire
 article announcing the arrival in the Netherlands on 28 November of a Chinese
 delegation led by Vice Communications Minister Guo Jian, its reception by van
 Agt and the commencement of talks, all on the day before the fateful cabinet
 decision.  Although by this time China was aware of the news leaks and
 probably conveyed this to The Hague, the Dutch government had not yet acted
 publicly and  he Chinese Ministry of Communications marched along, business as
 The timing of the protest is also some evidence of surprise.  According
 to some authorities, the Chinese standard practice for protests after an
 unanticipated and unfavorable event is three days.  This note was delivered on
 the third working day after 29 November.  The lack of specificity in the 3
 November note might also be construed as evidence that China was genuinely
 caught off its guard.  The Dutch later contended that China's ambiguous
 reaction at this time implied no basis for interrupting normal government
 procedures.

 S   CONFIDENTIAL   ?
 An unsigned commentary published by Xinhua in English on 3 December 1980
 probably accurately reflected official attitudes. This stressed China's
 "shock" and perplexity at the Netherlands' grant of an export license.  It
 refrained from any hint of threatening action, but expressed the hope that the
 Netherlands government would reconsider.  China made its distress believable
 by recalling the Guo Jian mission.  Without additional leverage, however, this
 did not greatly impress the Dutch.
 During the month of December, numerous diplomatic forays apparently
 occurred, as reported in later articles on the crisis, but the details are not
 part of the intelligence or public record.  China's position was not
 belligerent, but it was confrontational. F--]
 China's aim at this stage seems to have been to clarify the state of
 relations by gradually narrowing Dutch maneuver room, while leaving avenues to
 avoid a showdown prematurely.  Before further moves, the Chinese
 needed to determine whether the export license was the product of a mixup, a
 struggle in the Dutch government, a deliberate change of policy, or other
 factors. Progression to the second phase of the policy management, for
 example, hinged upon the outcome of the 18 December Dutch Parliamentary
 debate.  Chinese press descriptions of opposed factions in the Dutch
 Parliament suggest careful scrutiny and a strong Chinese lobby against the
 license's approval.  The cabinet obtained Parliamentary approval on 18
 December, but by only two votes.
 One stray press report from the Netherlands was hardly noticed during
 this period, but later was used by Beijing.  Reuters broadcast on 4 December a
 statement by the Dutch Secretary General of Foreign Affairs that, prior to its
 decision, the cabinet sought a US opinion and obtained advice favoring the
 export license.  This press report supported an apparent Chinese refusal to
 accept that Holland would act so mendaciously unless some arcane influence
 lurked behind the scenes.  The Reuters report provided a useful explanation,
 but China did not begin to exploit it until after the damage control process
 was tried and failed.  At that point the external element also was portrayed
 as responsible for Dutch obstinancy.  Additional caution had to be factored
 into Chinese calculations of the problem.
 The Chinese Issue an Ultimatum   (2-19 Jan 81)
 China's 2 January protest threatening to downgrade relations unless the
 Dutch decision were reversed signaled the next, more intense phase of policy
 management.  This was conveyed precisely 30 days after the first note.
 2 January 1981          The second protest note was delivered.
 Early January           China's ambassador was recalled for consultations.  In
 fact, the ambassador was already on home leave.

 13 January               AFP reported the thrust of the 2 January protest, but
 not the actual content.
 14 January               A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman in a reply to a
 Xinhua reporter acknowledged the deteriorated state of
 affairs, the protests and that China was awaiting a
 reply from the Netherlands.
 16 January               The Netherlands cabinet met to reconsider the license
 decision in light of Chinese remonstrations but
 decided to let the license stand.
 17 January
 Items in the English and Chinese language press
 informed the public of the Netherlands decision; the 4
 December Reuters report is mentioned in one Xinhua
 wire service report for the first time.  China denied
 a claim by van Agt that he informally mentioned the
 deal in his October visit. F--]
 China escalated the crisis in direct fashion, communicating its final
 bargaining position to The Hague in the quite specific 2 January protest
 note.  This was risky because the Dutch might have reacted by totally breaking
 relations, ending any Chinese chance of reversing the export license. With
 only limited leverage against the Dutch, China had little recourse but to
 place its credibility at issue by threatening automatic retaliation unless the
 license were revoked.  The retaliation, however, was quite mild: a downgrading
 of but no break in relations.  This satisfied China's domestic requirement to
 react firmly, but without jeopardizing larger, cooperative interests with the
 West.
 China's threat achieved some success in that a shocked Dutch government,
 openly split between the Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade Ministries, agreed
 to reconsider.  Certainly protocol, the closeness of the 18 December vote in
 Parliament, and continuing opposition pressure also contributed to the second
 look.  The Netherlands decision on 16 January to abide by the earlier license
 grant probably came as no surprise to the Chinese.  The reconsideration seemed
 to serve mainly as a vehicle for uniting the Dutch government behind the
 policy position.  By its moves, China clarified the state of Dutch relations
 and set the stage for further escalation.
 At this point, the role of the Hong Kong Communist media began to assume
 importance as a vehicle for avoiding any mixup or misunderstanding of
 signals.  For example, a 12 January article briefly but carefully spelled out
 exactly what the Netherlands should expect.  It argued that since the Dutch
 decision involved a lengthy and gradual process committing the whole
 government, the Dutch should expect China to act on the same broad basis. F

 A supposed Dutch leak on 13 January of the main thrust of the 2 January
 note prompted further notice to the Chinese populace. Responding to a Xinhua
 correspondent's question, on 14 January a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman
 acknowledged the deterioration in relations but still did not make public the
 nature of China's threat.  After the 16 January Dutch decision was
 communicated, however, the press restraints were dropped.  Additionally, for
 the first time, allusion to the alleged role of the US behind the Dutch
 decision surfaced openly in commentaries on 17 January in Beijing.   While the
 issue was probably contrived, these further prepared domestic attitudes in
 China to expect the worst in Sino-Dutch relations, despite the earlier very
 favorable treatment of the Netherlands.
 Retaliation Begins   (19 Jan 81)
 The 2 January threat became fact, almost, on the 19th.  Significantly,
 the 19 January note was worded as a "request for negotiations" leading to the
 downgrading of diplomatic representation.  It reasoned that the Dutch export
 license to RSV had eroded the basis for ambassadorial relations and again
 expressed regret, more than outrage, at the turn of events.  By this formula,
 the Netherlands was accorded still another opportunity to avert a crisis.
 China was also clearly playing to the strong Dutch opposition to the license
 whose pressure could make a reversal by van Agt appear as an act of
 statesmanship and political acumen rather than retreat.  When a move by the
 Dutch Parliament to debate the license again emerged in late January, China
 was still not irreversibly committed to its threatened course of action.
 Additionally, "negotiations" still hinged on a Dutch reply.
 Although reported only in the Hong Kong Communist press, the Chinese also
 displayed their impressive ability to coordinate diplomacy with other official
 dealings.  The Chinese ambassador announced in Amsterdam that a number of
 scheduled official delegation visits, a sporting competition and a number of
 contracts would be canceled, including a contract with Shell Oil for offshore
 oil exploration.
 Although the Chinese were ready to act immediately upon learning of The
 Hague's 16 January decision, their response was delayed deliberately until the
 19th, the day before the US Presidential Inauguration.  This note laid bare
 the whole course of diplomacy and representations.  It also signaled that
 China's position on Taiwan would not be compromised by cooperation with the
 West against the USSR or assistance for modernization.  Still, China could be
 The theme of US blame for Dutch intransigence was explicit in a lengthy
 commentary to the domestic audience on 20 January that explained the course of
 events with the Netherlands.  Whereas this was published in Chinese, the US
 official denial of complicity on the 26th was only published in the English
 language media in Beijing.  The Chinese populace was left with the impression
 that the US was behind the Netherlands' action--an idea that remains available
 for future exploitation.

 Pause   (20 Jan - 20 Feb 81)
 During the next month, China paused to gauge the effects of its
 actions.  Such pauses seem to be an essential part of Chinese crisis
 management tactics and have occurred at a similar stage in most crises dating
 from the Korean War.  The 19 January note probably worked better than expected
 and as well as any crisis manager could hope.  The Dutch Parliament was
 galvanized; a storm of debate ensued in the Netherlands, while China banked
 its official fires.   The Second House approved an unprecedented motion to
 debate the license issue de novo.  The Hague did not respond to China's call
 for negotiations, nor did China press for them.
 3 February               Netherlands Parliament voted again, this time
 disapproving the export license.
 4 February              A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman again publicly
 called on the Netherlands cabinet to reverse the
 export license.
 11 February              The Netherlands cabinet met but deferred a decision on
 the export license.
 20 February              The Netherlands cabinet met again and reconfirmed its
 decision approving the export license--this was not
 communicated officially to China. F-]
 Despite the Netherlands Parliament's 3 February reversal by a wider
 margin than the earlier approval, the cabinet decided to honor its first
 decision.  The reasons cited were employment opportunities, the legal
 obligation of the first decision and trustworthiness of the Netherlands
 government's word.  A motion for a vote of no confidence in the government was
 still-born.
 Final Action   (20 Feb - 11 May 81)
 25 February              A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman complained that
 the Netherlands had failed to respond to China's 19
 January note and called for negotiations.
 26 February              The Netherlands' official reply was conveyed to China
 along with a request for negotiations of outstanding
 problems.

 27 February             China delivered a note informing the Netherlands
 of the official recall of the Chinese ambassador
 and requested the Netherlands to do likewise.  This
 note demanded the immediate commencement of
 negotiations to downgrade relations and was published
 the same day as transmitted.
 The Netherlands ambassador departed Beijing.
 Assistant Foreign Minister Song Zhiguang proposed that
 negotiations begin before the end of March since China
 still had no reply to its 19 January request.  A
 prompt answer was requested.
 2 April                 Xinhua noted that Prime Minister van Agt had completed
 a 30 March-2 April visit to the US.
 7 April                 Negotiations began.

 China unilaterally broke off negotiations because the
 Dutch wanted to retain an embassy without an
 ambassador instead of a bureau d'affaires.  China
 unilaterally reduced the level of its representation;
 the Dutch protested.
 The Dutch announced the official downgrading of their
 diplomatic representation in Beijing.
 The Netherlands evidently hoped the situation could still be retrieved
 through talks.  The longer it delayed, however, the greater became Chinese
 intractability--the Chinese considered the dilatory tactics as comooundina the
 of Chinese measures, as foretold in the 12 January Hong Kong press item,

 Why The Netherlands?
 The Netherlands was a minor star in the Chinese constellation, but it was
 assailed rapidly and firmly. Aside from purportedly violating its agreement
 to recognize only one China, the export license decision, coming within the
 same month as a successful visit by van Agt, was deemed an open affront by the
 Chinese.  The fact of Dutch action in the public domain compelled a
 corresponding Chinese response.  The Chinese leadership evidently also
 perceived the need for immediate action to correct a misunderstanding, or
 deliberate distortion, that Chinese needs and desire for Western cooperation
 implied weaknesses so great that the West could expect or pry concessions on
 the Taiwan issue.  Additionally, flexibility in dealing with Taiwan because of
 outside pressures could strengthen the arguments of those in Beijing who
 distrusted the US and disagreed with the Deng Xiaoping strategy.  Finally,
 arms sales to Taiwan were more intolerable than other transactions because
 they materially reinforced resistance to Beijing's development of a peaceful
 reconciliation program.  Persistent failure of this program also could have
 strong repercussions for the dominant leadership group.  In short, the whole
 structure of recent policies and the standing of their sponsors could be in
 jeopardy unless firm action were taken.  ~
 Success and Failure
 China's handling of the Dutch episode succeeded in having the license
 debated several times in the Netherlands and produced a substantial stiffening
 of the terms of the export license.  It failed to achieve its reversal.
 Beijing seems to have underestimated the attraction of a lucrative
 shipbuilding contract and simply could not accumulate sufficient costs to
 counter Dutch calculations that favored the export license.  The continuing
 retaliation measures suggest that the Chinese still hope for a later reversal
 or further modification of the export license, or intend a later escalation of
 the retaliation if necessary.
 Important people-to-people ties between the two countries have persisted,
 though at a low level.  They include student exchanges, sister city ties, and
 contacts under the economic and technical and cultural cooperation
 agreements.  Their continuation during the episode, despite China's very
 specific threat of retaliation, probably reassured the Dutch that the costs
 were tolerable--that China had pulled its punch.  In turn, lingering Chinese
 uncertainty about the US connection may have contributed to the decision to
 downgrade relations, but not break them.
 On the larger level, the Chinese emphatically broadcast their position on
 Taiwan as it related to other strategic issues.  NATO nations and the rest of
 the world were put on notice that governmental action as slight as the grant
 of an export license was subject to retaliation in some degree of severity,
 even if it meant jeopardizing prospects for aid and cooperation.  Commentaries
 in the Hong Kong Communist press stressed that greater governmental action in

 favor of Taiwan could expect more severe Chinese retaliation. and that larger
 nations would be treated less tolerantly than the Netherlands.  China's crisis
 managers also succeeded in obtaining an official denial by the US of
 encouragement to the Netherlands and a Belgian denial of alleged negotiations
 to sell F-1Q4,s  o Taiwan, though intelligence indicates such a sale had been
 discussed.
 The Chinese Policy Management Process
 The Chinese Foreign Ministry managed the Dutch problem, but the
 coordination, speed, consistency and precision of China's moves attest to
 high-level supervision.  Although top officials made no public statements, the
 issue itself was not one over which the top leadership could afford
 disagreement or divisiveness.  China's need, in this case, to use diplomatic
 notes to move the Dutch problem rapidly, brought      sharp relief what
 appears to be one of several management modes.
 Top-level management seems to have made one very important demand on the
 Foreign Ministry:  to bring the problem to a head before the US Presidential
 Inauguration.  This was essential to insure that the US understood the message
 China sought to convey by its treatment of the Dutch.  The use of a specific
 threat in the 2 January ultimatum helped achieve this goal.
 With respect to the Netherlands, China's behavior was reactive, deterrent
 and retaliatory.  In a number of instances, Chinese officials,  including Deng
 Xiaoping have described their government's actions in terms of steps, often
 three.  This crisis involved three recognizable steps which herein are termed
 damage assessment and control, ultimatum, and action.
 The first step was the 3 December note.  This served official notice of a
 serious problem, fostered clarification of the relative policy positions and
 began the process of narrowing the issues and actors.  It and actions outside
 diplomatic channels staked out the grounds for confrontation and reinforced
 China's distress, but without backing the Dutch into a corner.  0
 The ultimatum was conveyed 30 days later on 2 January. Given more time,
 the Chinese probably preferred a longer period of damage control with several
 escalatory sub-steps to improve chances for reversing the Dutch decision.  But
 the costs of a rupture with the Netherlands paled before the larger issues at
 stake, which the Chinese judged as time sensitive.  Additionally, the

 ?   CONFIDENTIAL   ?
 threatened action lowered the overall risks in any case.  Despite the press of
 time, the Chinese crisis managers adhered to a 30-day timetable before taking
 the next major step. Although this crisis was too brief to substantiate
 adequately the practice of using a regular schedule, academic research has
 established such a practice as generally     r ing the timing of Chinese moves
 in numerous crises since the Korean War.
 At some point the Dutch problem had to be linked to the US problem--the
 two modes of management needed a point of tangency and the ultimatum required
 a terminal point for the main movement.  This was 19 January, although the
 precise date probably was flexible and hinged upon a Dutch response to the 2
 January note.  F-]
 The action step began on 19 January, but final retaliation was still
 reversible.  As in past crises, the action step involved three sub-steps.  The
 19 January note started the action and preserved Chinese credibility, but
 without completely confining the Dutch.  There followed a pause in which China
 weighed prospects for an 11th hour change of mind in the Netherlands, refined
 and probably coordinated its own next measures, gauged the degree of severity
 necessary, and guaranteed the Netherlands was fully committed to its course of
 action and without further maneuver room.  The deliberations of the Dutch
 Parliament on 3 February and subsequent cabinet meeting on 20 February
 established the metes and bounds of this sub-step and the timing of the final
 retaliation, the last sub-step.  Thi    curred on 27 February, a week after
 The Hague made its final decision.
 The US Connection
 Action by the US Congress in 1980 and election campaign and post-
 campaign statements by officials in the new administration sent conflicting
 signals about the continuity of the US commitment to "one China" and a
 consistent signal that China had to begin a crisis management process anew.
 With the relationship in flux but no adverse action yet taken, the Chinese
 evidently judged that early concerted moves stood a good chance of retrieving
 a declining situation.
 With respect to the US, China's management mode was initiatory and
 persuasive, rather than reactive and deterrent.  In this mode at least three
 steps are recognizable.  These may be termed "cultivation," lock-in and
 The "cultivation" step included virtual debates in the Chinese press with
 China's detractors, vilification of the so-called "Taiwan lobby", grand
 treatment of visitors from the US, dispatch of emissaries to the US, and
 highly favorable publicity for China friends in the US Congress and academic -
 community.  It also included explanations of the advantages to the US of a
 consistent one China policy and a temporary phase shift to the deterrent mode
 in January 1981 when the rumor surfaced that the Taiwanese were officially

 The Dutch crisis played a critical role, too, in that it provided the
 essential signal of the cost limits that China was willing to sustain to
 achieve the desired broad US commitment.  At the same time, it conveyed
 continuing Chinese dedication to cooperation, moderation and the present
 definition of the "overall strategic situation."  International cooperation
 could be decoupled to some extent from the Taiwan issue, but only to the limit
 of the terms of the so-called agreement between the US and China.  The Chinese
 understood these as excluding major new arms agreements or other acts
 inconsistent with one China.  In this regard, Beijing's permission of external
 trade relations for mainland provinces also served to help demarcate the
 limits of acceptable dealings with Taiwan, China's maverick province.  ^
 The onset of the lock-in step with the new US administration was supposed
 to have been the visit by the US Secretary of State.  In this context, the
 visit was to cement the new administration's broad commitment to one China and
 the agreements of its predecessor.  The US President's press conference on 17
 June vitiated the strength of the lock-in effect, prompting the Chinese to
 term both it and subsequent consolidation measures as "conditional."  This was
 enunciated in an authoritative 18 June commentary.  Later, Vice Chairman Li
 Xiannian described the Secretary's visit    achieving "some progress," though
 generally the Chinese remained pleased.
 On a conditional basis, China moved ahead as if lock-in had occurred.  At
 the same time, it scheduled actions, such as the pending visit by Premier Zhao
 Ziyang, to try to reinforce the strength of the US commitment.  Other visits,
 mainly that scheduled in August 1981 by a high-level military delegation,
 would also begin a conditional consolidation phase, while reinforcing lock-in
 as well.  In both cases, these were probably intended to be well-planned and
 impressive displays of cooperation with the US designed to narrow the US
 ability to deny or caveat its "commitment" to the Beijing goovernment, upon
 which a return Chinese commitment was publicly predicated.  u
 An implicit conclusion to be drawn from the Dutch crisis, in this
 connection, is that the Chinese have probably already plotted out their next
 moves in the event the initiative mode fails to achieve the US commitment the
 Chinese seek.  A deterrent management mode, with the abrupt cancellation or
 even recall of high-level delegations, would probably ensue quickly were the
 US to take a firm, public action leading to a major new arms sale for
 Taiwan.

 Although the evidence is not clear, it is likely that the initiative mode
 also operates on a timetable.  The scheduling of high level visits seems to
 signal benchmarks for assessing how the process is working, whether to
 continue a course of action, and if not, which course of action to select,
 including the shift to the deterrent mode. 0
 Whereas Chinese handling of the Dutch disclosed a willingness to risk a
 complete break with the Dutch, the Dutch episode disclosed a very cautious
 approach with respect to the US.  This suggests that when operating in the
 deterrent mode the Chinese will take high risks.  On the other hand, in the
 intiatory mode, when good chances remain to achieve goals, the willingness to
 take risks is low.  Academic research has reached similar conclusions.
 A key factor in the initiatory mode is the Chinese assessment of the
 overall strategic situation.  As long as events are consistent with this world
 view, setbacks to policy can be absorbed and worked around.  Conversely, an
 excessive number of setbacks, or a very serious one, is likely to prompt a
 judgment of miscalculation, a reassessment of the world view, and a
 significant change in Chinese dealings.  For example. several Chinese press
 articles have hinted already that a return to self-reliance might be in order
 so as to reverse the impression of weakness generated by China's bid for
 Western aid.  An occasional comment has hinted that Western dealings increase
 Soviet ire and that modernization goals can be achieved more safely under a
 reduced threat of attack from the USSR through more normal dealings in
 selected areas.  A spate of major new arms sales to Taiwan, especially if led
 by the US, would also require considerable rethinking or at least fine tuning
 of the overall strategic situation.  A change of this magnitude would alter
 the tone and style of Chinese actions, but not the process of crisis
 management.
