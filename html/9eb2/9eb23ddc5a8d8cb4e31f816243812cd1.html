 SOUTH VIETNAM
 April 29, 1975
 The US has begun the emergency evacuation of remain-
 ing Americans from South Vietnam.  The effort encountered
 some problems initially.   The communist assault on Saigon
 has closed Tan Son Nhut airfield and led to panic and
 chaos throughout the capital area.
 The first US helicopters from a naval task force
 off the coast landed at Tan Son Nhut with a US marine
 security force shortly after 2 a.m. EDT.   The US commander
 of the evacuation operation reported that some Americans
 in downtown Saigon had been unable to reach an evacuation
 point, but later reporting indicates a large number of
 Americans had arrived at the US defense attache compound.
 According to a late report more than 2,000 people,
 including several hundred Americans, now have been safely
 evacuated.
 The evacuation of Americans from Can Tho has en-
 countered resistance from South Vietnamese forces.  The
 US consul general, together with 22 other Americans plus
 Filipinos and Vietnamese civilians, tried to flee down
 the Mekong by boat, but were attacked by South Vietnamese
 helicopter gunships.  Late reports indicate they too have
 been rescued.
 Communist forces began their attack early this morn-
 ing with massive artillery and rocket bombardments of
 Tan Son Nhut airfield.  Many South Vietnamese aircraft
 were destroyed on the ground, but others managed to take
 off despite the rubble and heavy groundfire.   Some air-
 craft participated in the defense of Saigon, while others
 flew to Can Tho.  A number of government aircraft and
 helicopters flew to US ships off the coast or to bases
 in Thailand.  At least three South Vietnamese aircraft
 were shot down over Saigon by SA-7 missiles.
 The communists followed the Tan Son Nhut assault with
 a spate of small attacks in the suburbs of the capital.

 Government units just northwest of Saigon abandoned
 their positions, and a number of government outposts
 were lost as the result of ground attacks.  North Viet-
 namese sappers also penetrated the southern edge of
 Saigon and attacked a large military communications
 site.
 North Vietnamese forces also launched large-scale
 attacks west and southwest of Saigon.  A large communist
 force supported by tanks attacked the South Vietnamese
 25th Division at Cu Chi
 He avy fig   ing
 as occurring a ong Rou e    sout west of Saigon, and the
 communist forces attacking in that area could reach Cho-
 lon and the outskirts of the capital within hours.
 The North Vietnamese assault on the capital came on
 the heels of the communist rejection yesterday of Presi-
 dent Minh's call for negotiations.  North Vietnamese and
 Viet C:ong media have characterized the new Saigon govern-
 ment as just another "reactionary administration" and
 reiterated earlier demands that the government adminis-
 trative structure "be abolished," its "war machine" dis-
 mantled and that the US leave immediately.
 In a desperate effort to meet some of these de-
 mands, the Minh government today requested that all
 American personnel leave the country within 24 hours and
 announced plans to overhaul the governmental apparatus
 and legalize the Communist Party.   In another desperate
 gesture of reconciliation Saigon Radio today referred to
 the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong as "our brothers
 of the other side."

 In his acceptance speech. two days ago, President
 Minh asked for a cease-fire in order to arrange a "po-
 litical solution within the framework of the Paris Agree-
 ment" and called upon the South Vietnamese military to
 "defend the remaining territory."  it now seems clear,
 however, that Hanoi has rejected the gradual transfer
 of power and negotiations on a co-equal governmental
 basis implied by Minh and is determined to accept
 nothing short of surrender.

 The Khmer communists have finally confirmed their
 intention to keep Prince Sihanouk on as nominal head of
 state.   In a communique broadcast by Phnom Penh radio
 yesterday to mark the completion of a "special national
 congress," Deputy Prime Minister Khieu Samphan--who him-
 self read the communique over the air--announced that the
 congress had "decided" that Sihanouk would remain on and
 that Penn Nouth would also be "allowed" to remain as
 prime minster.
 The announcement leaves little doubt about the
 severely circumscribed role that Sihanouk and Penn Nouth
 will play.   Samphan's reference to "thorough review and
 debate" suggests, however, that the decision to allow
 the Prince and Penn Nouth any role whatsoever was a
 bitter pill for some communist leaders to swallow.   In
 this regard, Samphan hinted that other non-communist
 figures--such as Foreign Minister Sarin Chak--may be on
 their way out by saying that they would be "rewarded
 according to their respective contributions and abilities."
 Samphan introduced a note of caution to the commu-
 nists' previously stated willingness to accept "all uncon-
 ditional aid."  He made allusions, instead, to "foreign
 interferences...under the form of humanitarianism."   At
 the same time, however, he spoke of "striving to develop
 unity with...people throughout the world," including
 "peace- and justice-loving Americans," and. again stressed
 a "nonaligned and neutral" foreign policy.
 In addition to the communique, Phnom Penh radio over
 the weekend broadcast its first postwar "editorial."
 A relatively new art form for communist propagandists,
 the editorial was noteworthy for its references to "the
 great Cambodian revolutionary organization" that achieved
 victory through its "clear-sighted and correct line."
 However oblique,  this is the first public acknowledgment
 of the dominant role played by the covert Khmer Communist
 Party.

 The US defense attache in Bangkok indicates that
 press reports of a Cambodian come unist buildup along the
 Thai border are exaggerated.   Although Thai officials have
 expressed anxiety over the proximity of Khmer communist
 forces to Thailand, there is no evidence to substantiate
 reports that the communists are massing troops along the
 border.   The Khmer communists reportedly are under instruc-
 tions not to cross into Thailand, except in cases of hot
 pursuit.   Communist forces are still attempting to conso-
 lidate their control, and alleged border violations   rte obabl
 involved the pursuit of fleeing Cambodian refugees

 NORTH KOREA - CHINA
 The  joint communique ending the visit of North
 Korean President Kim 11-song to Peking struck a moderate
 and restrained tone.
 The document was, in fact, remarkable in its routine
 treatment of the Korean reunification issue, which must
 have occupied a central place in bilateral discussions.
 China reaffirmed support for "peaceful reunification" of
 the peninsula on the basis of Kim's earlier five-point
 proposal.
 Unlike some of Kim's threatening rhetoric during the
 early stages of the visit, the communique barely criti-
 cized Seoul and the US.   The document briefly reiterated
 long-standing demands for a complete US troop withdrawal
 and the dismantling of the UN command, without spelling
 out a time frame for these actions.   The two sides termed
 recent developments in Indochina encouraging and of "far-
 reaching influence" on the world situation, but the commu-
 nique drew no direct link between Indochina and the situa-
 tion on the Korean peninsula.
 Although senior military officers were prominent
 on both sides during substantive talks and military assis-
 tance was almost certainly discussed, the communique
 omitted any mention of Chinese economic or military aid.
 If differences exist between Pyongyang and Peking on re-
 unification strategy, they were not apparent in the
 communique; it said the visit was a "complete success"
 and that the two reached "completely identical views on
 all. the questions discussed."  While the communique and
 the closing banquet speeches by Kim and Vice Premier Teng
 Hsiao-ping were all moderate in tone and lacked new sub-
 stance, new North Korean diplomatic initiatives or even
 contained and controlled military probes remain possible.
 China's view of developments in Korea is heavily in-
 fluenced by the effects they might have on Sino-US rela-
 tions, which remain important to Peking.

 USSR - MIDDLE EAST
 Syrian Foreign Minister Khaddam's visit to the USSR
 last week marked a continuation of Moscow's efforts to
 prepare for a resumption of the Geneva peace conference.
 The communique issued at the end of the visit on
 Friday, however, left unclear whether the Soviets made
 substantial progress on. Geneva with the Syrians, partic-
 ularly over the issue of representation for the Pales-
 tine Liberation Organization.  The Syrians are strong ad-
 vocates of early participation at Geneva by an independent
 PLO delegation.  The Soviets support the "equal" participa-
 tion of PLO representatives, but they have been ambiguous
 about. the timing of Palestinian attendance and have kept
 open the possibility that the PLO might attend as part of
 another delegation.
 The Palestinian issue will be discussed during the
 visit: to Moscow, which began yesterday, of a PLO delega-
 tion headed by Yasir Arafat.  Foreign Minister Gromyko
 also is apparently planning a trip to the Middle East
 next month to continue discussions on resuming the Geneva
 conference.
 The Syrian-Soviet communique was markedly warmer on
 bilateral issues than the one issued three days earlier
 after Egyptian Foreign Minister Fahmi's visit.   In what
 may be an effort to signal their continued displeasure
 with Cairo, the Soviets once again stated their commit-
 ment to building Syrian military strength and praised
 Syria's political policies.
 A four-day trip to Damascus by Soviet Deputy Defense
 Minister Kulikov coincided with Khaddam's stay in Moscow
 and may have been designed to underscore continuing Soviet
 military support at a time when Moscow was pressing Khad-
 dam on Geneva.  Kulikov met with :President Asad and Syr-
 ian military leaders and probably checked Damascus' use
 of Moscow's substantial military aid.
 Syria's dispute with Iraq over the Euphrates River
 ikel  discussed in Moscow.

 YUGOSLAVIA
 Moscow is assisting President Tito in his efforts
 to modernize the Yugoslav armed forces, despite strains
 in political relations during the  ast year
 On
 April 10, an attaches source saw a radar, probably the
 Low Blow--the tracking and missile-guidance radar for
 the SA-3--at a SAM site near the same airfield.   Excava-
 tions for an SA-3 site had been noted earlier near a
 site in northwestern Yugoslavia.
 Rehearsals for the Victory Day parade on May 9 in
 Belgrade have provided additional first-time sightings
 of modern Soviet weaponry there.   On April 24, army
 troops were observed carrying the SA-7 Grail surface-to-
 air missile, and on April 27 eight SA-6 Gainful surface-
 to-air launchers with missiles were seen.   More parade
 practices are scheduled for the next several days, and
 other items of advanced Soviet military equipment may
 thus be seen.
 The new arms probably were supplied under a large
 supplemental Soviet credit,  reportedly agreed on in De-
 cember 1973.   There are indications that Belgrade has
 also been provided with plans for manufacturing rocket
 munitions, and there are signs that Yugoslav rocket units
 are training at firing ranges in the USSR.

 cooperation and the appearance of this advanced military
 equipment suggest, however, that Moscow is continuing
 to play a major role in Yugoslav defense efforts.

 The French Arms Industry
 The French arms industry is booming.  Export orders
 reached a record high in 1974, and French armament and
 aeronautic manufacturers are optimistic that exports will
 continue to expand over the next several years.   We es-
 timate that French arms makers took orders last year for
 at least $2.5 billion from Third World nations, France's
 principal customers.   These orders put France about on a
 par with the Soviet Union, which is believed to have
 signed arms agreements for about $2.7 billion in 1974.
 US arms sales for the year ending in July 1974 totaled
 around $8 billion.
 The French government works hard for these sales be-
 cause of the positive effect they have on France's balance
 of payments and on domestic employment.   Money for addi-
 tional equipment to modernize the French armed forces is
 limited these days, so the arms industry is especially
 dependent on export sales to stay healthy.
 France can produce virtually all types of modern
 military equipment.   Since 1966, French arms manufac-
 turers have exported to some 30 countries nearly 700
 modern jet fighters, about 300 light and medium tanks,
 more than 1,100 armored personnel carriers, and some
 70 self-propelled artillery pieces.
 The French arms industry does have its limitations.
 It cannot rapidly supply customers with large quantities
 of major items such as tanks and aircraft.   France does
 not stockpile military equipment for later sale, and
 when major new sales are made, the items must be fitted
 into future production schedules.
 The Dassault-Breguet aircraft company avoids peaks
 and valleys in company employment by setting a fairly
 low production rate.   Dassault now has orders and options
 that will keep the plant running at its current rate--
 about 15 fighter aircraft a month--at least through 1977.
 This figure does not include any of the Mirage Fl orders

 from the Middle East that are pending or orders for the
 improved Fl/E multipurpose fighter, should this aircraft
 go into series production.   If Dassault needed to increase
 production at a future date, it probably could double the
 capacity of existing facilities by adding additional
 shifts of workers.
 Dassault is now clearing a backlog of orders for
 some 230 Mirage IIIs and Mirage 5s and is turning them
 out at a rate of 11 a month.   At this pace, the produc-
 tion run will last until about December 1976.   In addi-
 tion to Mirage IIIs and 5s, Dassault currently is pro-
 ducing about four Fls a month.   The output of Fls could
 be doubled or even tripled, once the Mirage III and 5 are
 phased out.   Dassault has export orders for at least 75,
 and perhaps, as many as 130 Fls.   Dassault still has about
 50 Fls to go on a French air force order of 105.
 If necessary to close a new contract, Dassault prob-
 ably would be willing to manipulate delivery schedules to
 provide a new customer with at least a few aircraft at
 an earlier date.   The company has been averaging about
 28 months from order to first delivery.

 A Better Position
 The French are now in a better export position on
 tanks than on aircraft.   The French army recently com-
 pleted supplying its units with AMX-30 tanks,, and, except
 for small numbers of replacements and spare parts, all
 AMX-30 tanks now being produced could be exported.
 France could probably turn out up to 35 a month, although
 production reportedly now stands at about 22 a month.
 Monthly production rates for other hardware vary
 sharply; in several items, production is well below
 plant capacity.   The US defense attache in Paris reported
 in February that Aerospatiale is tooling up to produce
 a new wire-guided, heavy antitank missile, the Hot.
 By next April, the company will be producing the missile
 at a rate of 50 a month.  The company plans to reach a
 capacity of 500 a month by August 1977.  Paris hopes to
 find as good an export market for this system as for
 other antitank missiles produced in France--the SS-11,
 SS-12, Entac, and Milan.
 Although the French have been willing in the past
 to slow the flow of equipment to their own forces in
 favor of foreign customers, manipulation of production
 and delivery rates could become difficult as more pro-
 duction is devoted to foreign consumers.  France could
 well get involved in having to choose between two coun-
 tries competing for preferred treatment in the delivery
 of airplanes or tanks.
 Paris would try to persuade the competing customers
 to apportion production.   Thus, the Turks are negotiating
 with France for the rapid delivery of a number of Fl
 fighters; the French have suggested that Ankara sound out
 Libya to see if Tripoli would agree to Turkey's getting
 first delivery of the planes.
 Another possible solution would be to license the
 production of French arms in foreign countries.

 April 29, 1975,
 ---More than 250 Mirage IIIs and 5s have already been
 assembled in Australia, Switzerland, and Belgium
 under French license.
 ---South Africa is assembling some of the 48 Fls it
 purchased from France.
 ---Pakistan is negotiating to assemble Mirage fighter
 aircraft.
 ---Spain is assembling AMX-30 tanks.
 Arab Buyers
 The French sell a wide range of arms in Western
 Europe and the US, but in recent years they have turned
 more to the Third World.  They have had success in Latin
 America because of US arms embargoes.   Since the Middle
 East war in the fall of 1973, they have been especially
 successful in selling arms to the Arabs, who placed
 orders worth nearly $2 billion last year.
 Using aggressive sales tactics, Dassault has kept
 its family of Mirage fighter planes at the forefront of
 these sales.  Despite French efforts to sell the Mirage
 Fl/E as the F-104 replacement aircraft in Western Europe,
 Dassault's prospects appear tied to the Third World,
 especially Arab markets.
 As sales of the Mirage III and 5 wind down,  interest
 in the Fl is rising.   Deliveries of Fls to Spain and
 South Africa have begun, and initial deliveries to Greece
 are scheduled in the next few months.   Arab purchasers
 will probably begin getting Fls sometime next year.
 In 1974, Kuwait ordered at least 16--and possibly
 as many as 36--F1s.    Major new sales of the Fl appear
 certain, following French agreement in January to provide
 Egypt with new militar  hardware.

 Libya is currently negotiating for 39 Fls, and Iraq has
 mentioned an interest in purchasing at least 50 Mirage
 jets.
 Egypt recently received the first 9 of 38 Mirage 5
 fighter-bombers purchased for Cairo by Saudi Arabia in
 1973.  The delivery schedule calls for three planes a
 month.  Egypt has also signed a contract for some 42
 Anglo-French Gazelle helicopters.  Delivery of these
 all-purpose, lightweight helicopters is scheduled to
 begin in the fall.
 France sold significant amounts of ground forces
 equipment to the Arab nations in 1974.   Important sales
 were 100' AMX-30 tanks to Saudi Arabia and 50 to Morocco.
 Abu Dhabi recently signed a contract for over 150 Panhard
 armored cars fitted with 90-mm. guns, plus enough armored
 personnel carriers for an infantry brigade and a smaller
 but unspecified number of armored personnel carriers
 fitted with 20-mm. guns.
 Bright Outlook
 Arab states also is bright.
 Sales of French naval equipment have not kept pace
 with air and ground forces equipment.   Nevertheless,
 France does have prospects, especially for fast missile
 patrol boats and electronics equipment.
