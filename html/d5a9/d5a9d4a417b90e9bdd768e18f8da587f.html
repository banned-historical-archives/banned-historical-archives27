Dear Mr. Dulles: 
Reference is made to your letter dated 
April 21, 1954, referring to my letter of 
April 5, 1954, and to Lieutenant General Cabell 's 
report of March 27, 1954. You requested that we 
continue to send you reports from the source 
referred to in these letters. 
Your attention is again directed to the 
last paragraph of Lieutenant General Cabell 's 
report of March 27, 1954, which characterizes 
the report from this source as either a "fabrication 
or the product of a paper mill, which conclusion 
has been applied to ma-ny similar disseminations in 
the past from apparently the same source." In 
view of this characterisation, I am still of the 
opinion that no useful purpose will be served by 
this Bureau's disseminating to your ,igency informa-
tion which is received from this source in the 
future.

I have your letter of 5 April 1954 in which you make 
reference to your letter of 16 March 1954, with enclosed intel-
ligence memorandum, and LA. General Cabell's report to you of 
27 March 1954, which was sent during my absence from Washington. 
The fact that we found certain of the statements in this 
particular report cif somewhat doubtful credibility does not imply 
that we womb!' henceforth desire to be cut off from the distribution 
of future reports from this particular agent which you might normally 
make. It has been our experience that useful agents often make reports 
of somewhat doubtful credibility, particularly when they are dealing 
with areas outside their direct field of knowledge. Also, occasionally, 
agents are used by the Soviet unwittingly to spread information which 
they desire us to believe. It is our practice, and I am sure it is 
yours, particularly in the Ca.. of agents who have proved their 
value, not to reach negative judgments on the basis of isolated 
disseminations. 
We would, therefore, appreciate it if you will kindly con-
tinue to *end us reports from this agent which relate to matters of 
foreign intelligence.

PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL 
VIA LIAISON 
The comments contained in the letter dated 
March 27, 1954, from Acting Director Lieutenant General C. P. 
Cabe11 relating to my letter of March 16, 1.9.54., and attach-
ment, have been reviewed. 
It is noted it is the conclusion of your Agency 
that the contents of the report submitted to you with my 
letter of March 16, 1954, is a fabrication or the product 
of a paper mill and that this same conclusion has been applied 
by your Agency to many similar reports from our same source in 
the past. 
As pointed out in my letter of 1iarch 16, the 
data was forwarded -to you for information and was obtained 
by an informant who has reported reliable information in 
the past. While this Bureau is not in a position to 
evaluate this information, I wish to advise that -this 
informant has also furnished considerable information 
concerning Soviet intelligence activities in the United 
States. In many instances this latter information has 
been corroborated through other sources and has been 
found to be accurate. 
It is believed that no useful purpose will ye 
served by this Bureau in making any future dissemination 
to your Agency of information received from this source.

IN REPLY, PLEASE REFER TO

March 16, 2954 
The following information was furnished by an informant 
who has given reliable information in the past. It purports to 
represent statement-kmade -.luring December, 1953, and January and 
February, 1954, by a Soviet official stationed in Europe who is 
believed to be attached to the Soviet Ministry of Internal 
Affairs (MYD). 
According to the informant, the Soviet official 
stated that some universities in Russia have more German than 
Russian students. After appropriate screening, the best German 
students are trainei and given important positions, but they 
are watched closely. Most of these students are electrical 
engineers, chemists, and physicists, and by the end of 1955 
there will be a million engineers in Russia. 
The official stated that Bulganin and Zhukov are not 
?educated technicians" and may be soon replaced. Zhukov is 
hated by Premier Malenkou. (Bulganin is believed to be N. A. 
Bulg_anin, Minister of Defense, and Zhukov is believed to be 
G. K, Zhukov, First Deputy Minister of Defense in Russia.) 
The official also reportedly stated that there is 
a "big fight" in the Soviet Union as to who will head the 
atomic work._ Nobody wants the job since Berta left so many 
"odds and ends." Everyone is refusing responsibility, both 
for the past and for the future. The Soviets have developed 
good "single pieces" but have not been able to get mass produc-
tion of atomic weapons. 
The informant reported that, according to the Soviet 
official, the Russians have an organi2ed campaign to win back 
Tito through utilization of other people in Yugoslavia. They 
are also locating Moslem priests in Yugoslavia who speak French 
and who are to be trained and sent to North Morocco. 
The official also stated that Mikoyan (probably A. I. 
Mdkoyan, Soviet Minister of Trade) is the last remaining live 
"real buddy" of Berta, and Malenkov has been unable to get 
anything on .him. Malenkov will tempt the English and French 
to trade with the USSR, and in that connection Mdkoyan will 
overpay for something and will be replaced by a Malenkov man.

The official stated that "Kousnetzoff," the Soviet 
Ambassador to China, had not been too successful. MAO Tse-tung 
(Chairn-can of the Central People 's Government of the People Is 
Republic of China) thinks he is better than Marx and Lenin. 
HO Chi-minh (leader of the Viet Minh in Indochina) prefers to 
be considered an oriental Lincoln. He and MAO hate each other. 
HO Chi-minh insists on being present at the forthcoming Geneva 
Conference of foreign Ministers, but CHOU En-Lai (Premier and 
Minister of foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China) 
will not let him attend because he believes that, if American 
Secretary of State Dulles in casual conversation compares 
HO Chi-minh with Lincoln, HO Chi-minh would "give everything" 
-to Dulles, and -the Americans and french would no longer need 
an army in Indochina. 
The informant also aluised that, according to -the 
Soviet official, Molotov was criticized by his superiors for 
his lack of success at -the Berlin Conference of foreign Ministers.

The Honorable .1. Edgar Hoover 
Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation 
Department of Justice 
Washington, D. C. 
Dear Mr.. Hoover: 
21 April 1954 
I have your letter of 5 April 1954 in which you make 
reference to your letter of /6 March 1954, with enclosed intel-
ligence memorandum, and Lt. General CabeU's report to you of 
27 March 1954, which was sent during my absence from Washington. 
The fact that we found certain of the statements in this 
particular report of somewhat doubtful credibility does not imply 
that we would henceforth desire to be cut off from the distribution 
of future reports from this particular agent which you might normally 
make. It has been our experience that useful agents often make reports 
of somewhat doubtful credibility, particularly when they are dealing 
with areas outside their direct field of knowledge. Also, occasionally, 
agents are used by the Soviet univittingly to spread information which 
they desire us to believe. It is our practice, and I aux sure it is 
yours. Particularly in the case of agents who have proved their 
value, not to reach negative judgments on the basis of isolated 
disseminations. 
We wouldtherefore, appreciate it if you will kindly con-
tinue to send us reports from this agent which relate to matters of 
foreign intelligence.

Dear Mr. 
The comments contained in the letter dated March 27, 
1954. from Acting Director Lieutenant General C. P. Cabell 
relating to my letter of March 16. 1954, and attachment, have 
been reviewed. 
It is noted it is the conclusion of your Agency that the 
contents of the report submitted to you with my letter of March 16, 
1954, is a fabrication or the product of a paper mill and that this 
same conclusion has been applied by your Agency to many similar 
reports fro in our same source in the past. 
As pointed out in my letter of March 16, the data was 
forwarded to you for information and was obtained by an informant 
who has reported reliable information in the past. While this Bureau 
is not in a position to evaluate this information, I wish to advise that 
this informant has also furnished considerable information concerning 
Soviet intelligence activities in the United States. In many instances 
this latter information has been corroborated through other sources 
and has been found to be accurate. 
It is believed that no usefill'ou'pose will be served by 
this Bureau in making any future dissemination to your Agency of 
information received from this source.

The following information was furnished by an informant 
iven reliable information in the past. It purports to 
statements made during December, 1953, and January and 
February, 1954, by a Soviet official stationed in Europe who is be-
lieved to be attached to the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs (MID). 
According the informant, the Soviet official stated that 
iversities in Russia have more German than Russian students. 
propriate screening, the best German students are trained 
n important positions, but they are watched closely. Most 
students are electrical engineers, chemists, and physicists, 
e end of 1955 there will be a million engineers in Russia. 
The official stated that Dulganin and Zbuicov are not 
"educ .ted technicians,'" and may be soon replaced. Zhukov is hated 
by Premier Malenkov. (Bulganin is believed to be N. A. Bolganin 
Minister of Defense. and Zhukov is believed to be G. K. ZIro)ov, 
First Deputy Minister of Defense in Russia.) 
The official also reportedly stated that there is a "big 
fight"in the Soviet Union as to who will head the atomic work. 
Nobody wants the job since Berta left so many "odds and ends." 
Everyone is refusing responsibility, both for the past and for the 
future, The Soviets have developed good "'tingle pieces" but have 
not been able to get mass production of atomic weapons. 
The Informant reported that, according to the Soviet 
official, the Russians have an organised compaign to win back 
Tito through utilisation of other people in Yugoslavia. They 
are also locating Moslem priests in Yugoslavia who speak French 
and who are to be trained and sent to North Morocco. 
The official also stated that Mikoyan (probably A. I. 
Soviet Minister of Trade) is the last remaining live 
dy" of Berta, and Malenkov has been unable to get 
n him. Malertkov will tempt the English and French 
to trade with the USSR, and in that connection Miltoyan will 
overpay for something and will be replaced by a Malenkov man,

The officiastatedl  that "Nousnetsoff, Soviet 
Ambassador to China, had not been too successful. MAO Tse-tang 
(Chairman of the Central People's Government of the People's 
Republic of China) thinks he is better than Marx and Lenin. 
HO Chi-minh (leader of the Viet Minh in Indochina) prefers to 
be considered an oriental Lincoln. He and MAO hate each other. 
HO Chi-minh insists on being present at the forthcoming Geneva 
Conference of Foreign Ministers, but CHOU En-Lai (Premier and 
Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China) 
will not let him attend because he believes that, if American 
Secretary of State Dulles in casual conversation compares 
HO Chi-171Mb. with Lincoln, HO Chi-rainh would "give everything" 
to Dulles, and the Americans and French would no longer need 
an army in Indochina. 
The informant also advised thataccording to the 
Soviet official, Molotov was criticised by his superiors for 
hie Lack of success at the Berlin Conference of rcirelgri Ministers.
