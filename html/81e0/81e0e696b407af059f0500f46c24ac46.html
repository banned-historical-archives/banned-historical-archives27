CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 2985 
balance the the budget by cutting down on what 
the President has asked for in foreign aid. 
Both parties have now worked themselves 
Into a jam which, considering the state of 
the world, is not an inspiring thing to look at. 
The Republicans have gotten themselves 
into a position where they must save on 
spending for native American needs?such 
as education and public facilities, almost 
certainly also the national defense. But the 
Republicans, as the great savers, are im-
plored by the President to spend abroad on 
foreign aid the sums they would like to 
spend here at home. 
The Democrats on the other hand have 
worked themselves into the embarrassing 
position where they, the party of Wilson, 
Roosevelt, Truman, and Stevenson, are 
threatening to save on foreign aid in order 
to spend more at home. 
Surely, there is something inherently ab-
surd in a situation where the Republicans 
are the globalists and the Democrats are the 
isolationists. Could such a topsy-turvy sit-
uation have developed if politicians in both 
parties had not forgotten the realities of our 
national needs while they play politics with 
the budget and with taxes? 
What has happened to all these earnest 
and patriotic men? They have become en-
tangled in a dogma which few of the Mem-
bers of Congress and none of the leaders in 
Washington have the courage to challenge. 
What is the dogma? Is it that the budget 
should be balanced? No. The budget 
should if possible be balanced, and if that is 
impossible, there should nevertheless be a 
serious attempt made to balance it. 
The dogma which confuses the whole sit-
uation and the position of both parties is 
that the budget must be balanced without 
raising the income tax rates. The crux of 
the matter is the acceptance by both sets 
'of political leaders of the dogma that the 
income tax rates of 1954 are sacrosanct. 
Once that dogma is accepted, the budget 
cannot be balanced except by two equally 
unacceptable methods. One is to balance 
it by taxes on consumption. This is some-
thing that Congress will not now do. The 
other method is to balance the budget at 
the expense of our national defense and of 
our foreign policy, and of our internal public 
needs and development. This is something 
that the country cannot afford to do. 
Here, having accepted the dogma about 
the 1954 income tax rates, we have locked 
ourselves in a room from which there is no 
decent exist. 
What is in prospect now, unless there is 
a revival of national leadership at both ends 
of Pennsylvania Avenue, is, first, a budget 
which does not balance because Congress 
and the President between them will not 
produce the taxes necessary to balance it; 
second, a budget which does not support 
our national interests at home and abroad, 
and will, therefore, have to be supplemented 
in the near future by extraordinary appro-
priations. 
While this is going on we shall have to pay 
the price of having neglected our national 
(By Walter Lippmann) needs because we were too soft and too 
The President's budget is now a football timid to tax ourselves enough. 
In a political scrimmage. Both parties are 
pretending that they are struggling to bal-
, - 
ance the budget. -In fact neither the admin- / STANDARDS OF FOREIGN LAN-
istration nor the Congress shows any sign GUAGE PROFICIENCY FOR THE 
of being willing to vote the taxes which are FOREIGN SERVICE 
absolutely essential if the budget is to be 
balanced. 
As of now, both parties regard as untouch-
able the income tax rates which were fixed 
in 1954, the date of the Eisenhower reduc-
tion of taxes. The President's budget plan, 
if we accept some rather fancy calculations, 
can be brought into balance?but only if 
Congress will raise postal rates and increase 
the gasoline taxes. As Congress is certain to 
reject the new taxes, the official theory ,of 
the Democrats seems to be that they can 
I look forward to his report, and hope 
that it will result in affirmative action 
by the Congress. 
Likewise, I believe that we should 
examine carefully the tax on capital 
gains, various excises, and tax treatment 
of different groups and individuals on the 
? 
basis of special distinctions. 
Mr. President, I do not wish to have it 
thought that because of my advocacy of 
the four tax proposals which I have just 
discussed that I have become a victim 
of the balanced-budget fetish. 
I do not believe that there is anything 
sacrosanct about any item now in the 
President's budget. Nor do I believe 
that a program outside the President's 
arbitrary framework is untouchable. 
The administration has created a mythi-
cal balanced budget which was achieved 
on paper a year and half before it was 
possible to actually balance the books?
and with heavy reliance on revenue 
measures not yet law, for example, the 
motor-fuels tax increase. 
Mr. President, I wish to emphasize the 
point that even the present budget, 
which has been sent to Congress by the 
White House, for $77 billion, cannot be 
regarded as balanced unless Congress 
increases motor fuel taxes and increases 
postal rates. Two of the bills which I 
have introduced today are intended to 
accomplish that purpose. Therefore, I 
believe it is wise that Members of the 
_ Senate recognize the basic, unassailable 
fact that we are not talking about a bal-
anced budget of even $77 billion unless 
two of the revenue measures which I 
have introduced here are enacted into 
law. 
The fundamental purpose of the 
budget is to weigh "opportunity costs," 
the price of giving up one thing so as 
to do something deemed of greater im-
portance, the division of resources be-
tween the public and the private sectors 
of the economy, between competing pro-
grams within the budgetary framework. 
The fact that a particular program 
has accumulated a hoary tradition of 
congressional support is no argument in 
itself for its continued Federal backing. 
The budgetary procedure is one of re-
view and allocation. It should not be 
stultified by habit or pressure. 
Nor do I wish to leave the impression 
that concern with the questions of in-
flation or deficit spending has caused me 
to lose sight of the problems of full em-
ployment and maximum growth which 
face us today. 
EMPLOYMENT, GROWTH GOALS VITAL 
In this session, as in the past, I urge 
enactment of a broader housing pro-
gram, liberalization of unemployment 
compensation, passage of a depressed 
areas bill to relieve those living in sec-
tions of chronic unemployment, increase 
and extension of the minimum wage law. 
I again support measures to provide Fed-
eral assistance to the States in classroom 
construction, extend Federal help offered 
airports, authorize construction of water 
control projects. All of these measures 
will have a beneficial effect on growth 
and employment and will tend to in-
crease tax revenues and aid in solving 
problems of stagnation which have ap-
peared in the "post-recession" economy. 
But while I recognize these facts, I 
am disturbed by the continued reluc-
tance to seek new revenue sources. In-
creasing concern is being shown as to 
placement of the public debt. There ex-
ists the possibility that debt monetiza-
tion may increase through the commer-
cial banking system more rapidly than 
economic growth, thus supplying a po-
tential source of inflation. 
Interest and service charges involved 
in bond financing add to the cost of the 
Program to be implemented. These costs 
benefit directly only the lenders. Inter-
est payments in fiscal year 1960 are esti-
mated at $8,096 million. In fiscal year 
1955 the figure was $6,438 million. In 
5 years interest costs increased over 20 
percent. Today interest payments rep-
resent 10.5 percent of total budget ex-
penditures?more than we will spend on 
all the Federal functions of commerce 
and housing, natural resources, and la-
bor and welfare. 
Mr. President, that proportion of GNP 
represented by nondefense expenditures 
by the Federal Government has declined 
every year since fiscal year 1954 with the 
exception of 1958 when special stimu-
latory measures were taken to aid the 
economy in recovering from the reces-
sion. I believe that if we are to effec-
tively provide the goods and services 
which our country needs, we must con-
sider increasing that share of resources 
allocated to the public sector through 
taxation. As Oliver Wendell Holmes 
once said: "Taxes are what we pay for 
civilized society." 
I share with Governor Nelson Rocke-
feller of New York the view that we 
should not shove off onto the backs of 
future generations our own burdens to-
day. They will have plenty of problems 
of their own. Are we self-sacrificing 
enough to meet the test of the 20th cen-
tury? This question is implicit in the 
revenue-raising measures I have intro-
duced in the Senate this afternoon. 
In his thoughtful syndicated column 
for March 5, Mr. Walter Lippmann has 
called for higher taxes in order to meet 
our ever-rising duties in our own land 
and in the world. This column appeared 
here in the Washington Post and Times-
Herald and in the Oregonian of Port-
land, Oreg. I ask unanimous consent, 
Mr. President, that it be printed in the 
RECORD with my remarks. 
\There being no objection, the article 
was ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
THE STULTTFYING DOGMA 
Mr. SALTONSTALL. Mr. President, 
last Monday I introduced for myself 
and the distinguished Senator from 
Montana [Mr. MANSFIELD] a bill (S. 
1243) dealing withloreign language pro-
ficiency standards and training for the 
Foreign Service of the United States. 
The bill also contains provisions de-
signed to facilitate recruitment for the 
Foreign Service. ,

2986 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
The United States has come of age in 
the past two decades. We have once 
and for all joined the world. America's 
detached and distant situation, as 
Washington called it in his Farewell 
Address, is gone like yesterday's snows. 
And gone with it is any possibility of 
following Washington's advice to steer 
clear of the foreign world. 
Largely because of the recentness of 
our advent to the position we now oc-
cupy in the world, our country is in a 
comparatively immature stage in pre-
paring its people for life as citizens of a 
leading international power. By and 
large American educational processes 
and family life are still inner directed 
relative to the rest of the world. There 
are, however, many developments in 
education which are turning our people 
more and more to an "outer directed" 
orientation vis-a-vis other nations and 
their people. 
Let me mention a few: 
In January 1948, Congress passed the 
U.S. Information and Educational Ex-
change?Smith-Mundt?Act, Public Law 
80-402, which gave the Government per-
manent authority to engage in world-
wide educational and cultural exchanges 
with the people of other countries. The 
semiannual reports of the Secretary of 
State and of the U.S. Advisory Commis-
sion on Educational Exchange contain 
a review of the manifold programs and 
activities under the act. 
Last year marked the 10th year of 
educational exchanges under the world 
renowned Fulbright Act, Public Law 
79-584. 
The program of university contracts 
abroad for technical assistance, admin-
istered by the International Cooperation 
Administration, has been in operation 
under the Mutual Security Act since 
1951. 
Title VI of the National Defense Edu-
cation Act of 1958, Public Law 85-864, 
established a program to -further the 
teaching of modern foreign languages 
not generally taught in this country and 
to provide for studies necessary for a 
full understanding of the areas in which 
such languages are commonly used. 
Several institutions in my State of 
Massachusetts are leaders in various 
fields of international studies. Among 
these are my own alma mater, Harvard 
University, which has a host of programs 
and activities at the undergraduate and 
graduate levels; the University of Massa-
chusetts, which is participating in fac-
ulty-exchange programs in Japan and 
Venezuela under ICA and USIA, respec-
tively; Tufts College and its Fletcher 
School of Diplomacy; Boston University, 
which has one of the Nation's leading 
African area studies programs; Massa-
chusetts Institute of Technology and its 
Center for International Studies, which 
has done excellent work under contract 
to the Foreign Relations Committee; 
Clark University, a leader in the study of 
geography; Newton College of the Sacred 
Heart, Mount Holyoke; Radcliffe, Smith, 
and Wellesley Colleges with well-estab-
lished international student-exchange 
programs; Brandeis University with its 
Wien international scholarship program, 
and its Mediterranean, Near Eastern, and 
Judaic. studies; Amherst College with its 
Merrill Center for Economics at which 
international summer seminars on major 
economic problems are held. 
Recently I have been corresponding 
with Father Vincent R. Dolbec, A.A., 
dean of the faculty of Assumption Col-
lege, about its newly proposed summer 
institutes in Russian and French lan-
guages and culture. The school has a 
proud reputation for its foreign-studies 
effort. 
Only a few days ago I conferred with 
Dr. Glenn A. Olds, president of Spring-
field College, and heard something of the 
promising new projects which ? he is 
planning there. 
Plainly, more and more is being done 
in America in the development of pro-
grams of international education, re-
search, and study, whose long-run effect 
will be felt throughout the fabric of our 
society in giving all our citizens an 
orientation consistent with ? the role in 
the world which our Nation must play. 
Similar influences stem from the con-
tinually expanding oversea operations 
of American business enterprises and the 
steadily increasing activities of our many 
nongovernmental, informal educational 
organizations. 
However, we would be deluding our-
selves if we failed to recognize that there 
is room for much more to be done. We 
are indeed fortunate that the chairman 
of the Committee on Foreign Relations, 
the distinguished Senator from Arkan-
sas (Mr. FULBRIGHT] , recognizes this.. 
The bill (S:1205) which he filed on Feb-
ruary 26, to amend the National Defense 
Education Act of 1958 to provide ad-
vanced training in foreign countries dur-
ing summer vacation for teachers of fort-
eign languages, is an imaginative and 
constructive proposal which deserves 
promp and favorable consideration by 
the Congress. 
. The educational activities which are 
going on and which are being planned 
in America are but a small proportion 
of all that will have to be done before 
the vast majority of our citizens will be 
globally oriented; before our young peo-
ple will come to regard an oversea ca-
reer with- the same interest and alacrity 
as they now view domestic careers. I 
commend to all Senators for study the 
hearing of the Foreign Relations Com-
mittee held February 18 at which Dean 
Harlan Cleveland, dean of the Maxwell 
Graduate School of Citizenship and Pub-
lic Affairs, Syracuse University, and two 
of his associates discussed in most stim-
ulating fashion the subject of the over-
sea Americans. 
During the course of the hearing, Dean 
Cleveland made the following observa-
tions in talking about the urgency of 
changing the attitudes of our citizens to 
make them more compatible with' the 
role of our Nation in the world: 
I am also painfully aware as an educator 
that there is a certain cycle in growing peo-
ple, as there is in other forms of agriculture, 
and that if we have an outstanding person-
nel, oversee personnel service, including the 
Foreign Service and other forms of oversea 
_ civilian service in a generation, we will have 
to operate with the greatest urgency today 
in growing the kinds of people that will have 
to make up that service. 
? ? ? 
March 5 
So the first thing is to put it on a long-
range basis, and the second thing is to estab-
lish enough training and education programs 
around the country to begin to produce a 
real pool of qualified people. 
I think there is much wisdom in these 
observations by Dean Cleveland. Per-
haps their principal significance is their 
implication for the Foreign Service of the 
United States and our other govern-
mental oversea operations, for they must 
recruit their personnel from the ranks 
of young men and women with the out-
looks and qualifications which today's 
American education and family life im-
part to them. Until time and hard work 
have wrought the transformation in out-
look and qualification of our citizens so 
as to create a real pool of first-rate over-
sea emissaries, it seems inevitable that 
there will have to be considerable orien-
tation and language training of Amer-
icans who are to serve in our Govern-
ment's oversea operations. 
The principal center for such training 
within the Government is the Foreign 
Service Institute, which is doing a fine 
job in its crucial work. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed at this point in my 
remarks two interesting, recent maga-
zine articles about the Foreign Service 
Institute. 
There being no objection, the articles 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the Reader's Digest, February 1959] 
OUR OVERSEAS TASK FORCE IN MUFTI 
(By John Stuart Martin) 
In a Japanese port, a brisk, Michigan-bred 
woman strides into a police station near the 
waterfront. She exchanges greetings with 
her good friend, the desk sergeant, and 
listens to what is troubling him this even-
ing: Some American seamen have wrecked a 
tavern and have been locked up. Riding 
herd On such cases has long been one of this 
lady's specialties as a I.S. consul charged 
with matters maritime. 
In New Delhi, India, a U.S. attach?ho 
can read and speak Hindi pores over stacks 
of Blitz, a virulently anti-American journal. 
His task: To find out the editor's grievances 
and then try to clear up his misconceptions. 
Somewhere in southeast Asia, a U.S. con-
sular official broadcasts a radio warning: 
"Attention, all American citizens. Atten-
tion. Call the U.S. consulate at once." 
With Red guerrillas approaching his area, he 
is preparing an emergency evacuation of 
American residents. 
' In the Foreign Service of the United States 
are about 4,500 such people, counting those 
on duty in State Department offices at home. 
Serving about 12 years abroad to 3 state-
side, they staff 278 Foreign Service posts in 
87 foreign lands. 
Their duties are of two basic kinds: Diplo-
matic?maintaining friendly relations with 
foreign governments; and consular?protect-
ing American lives, rights, trade, and prop-
erty throughout the world. Ranging in rank 
from ambassador down through minister to 
first, second, and third secretary, and from 
consul general to consul and vice consul, 
they are the unarmed custodians of our na-
tional honor and interest wherever our flag 
flies on a guest basis. 
The instruments they use are mainly psy-

Little Rock, juvenile delinquency, or Holly-
wood absurdities. 
Recently I went to Washington to learn 
what kind's of people are now entering our 
Foreign Service, and how the corps is being 
trained for its crucial work. I was aware of 
the criticism that has been directed' at our 
overseas representatives: That they are 
drawn from the most privileged groups, that 
their training prepares then!' to deal more 
with social amenities than with the realities 
of the cold war. 
I found that in the last few years the 
entire concept of ' foreign sevice has been 
revitalized, thanks to the potent stimulus of 
the Wriston report of 1954, the personnel-
policy study headed by Henry M. Wriston, 
then president of Brown University. Except 
at the very top, where the President still 
enjoys latitude in choosing Secretaries of 
State and Ambassadors as his personal rep-
resentatives, entry into the Foreign Service 
is no longer possible through influence or 
affluence. From the bottom up the corps 
Is entirely career, wide open, and highly 
competitive. 
More than 4,000 candidates annually take 
the tough entrance exams at 65 educational 
centers throughout the country. Only 
about 150 are selected. No college degree is 
required, but usually some 65 percent of the 
winners have not only B.A.'s but M.A.'s, and 
5 percent have Ph. D.'s. Average age is 26. 
Men outnumber women 15 to 1, but able 
women are prized. 
Those selected through the written exams 
are screened orally for an exacting combi-
nation of traits: leadership, mental and 
moral fiber, special flair for languages, skill 
in political analysis. The men and women 
finally chosen are a remarkable cross section 
of the country's young talent, and could 
almost certainly climb fast in other profes-
sions. In the Foreign Service their pay be-
gins at about $100 per week, and they know 
that 12 or 15 years must pass before that 
figure is doubled. The knowledge of their 
eliteness, plus the realization that they are 
performing a vital service, must be a large 
share of their reward. 
To the Foreign Service Institute, founded 
in 1946, is entrusted the job of turning these 
new recruits into accomplished diplomats. 
Operating today with a budget commensu-
rate with its importance in our national life, 
the Institute has become a highly profes-
sional college, where making friends and in-
fluencing people on a world scale is ap-
proached as a fine art. 
Now housed in new quarters a couple of 
miles up the Potomac from the Pentagon, 
the Foreign Service Institute is headed by 
Harold Boles Hoskins, 63, a sharp-witted 
former textile executive with years of for-
eign-trade experience. To its old basic-
training course for new Foreign Service offi-
cers there has been added a refresher course 
for promising midcareer people. Atop that, 
there is now a course for seniors who are 
eligible and needed to fill the highest For-
eign Service posts. 
The basic course for Foreign Service re-
cruits lasts 12 weeks. It teaches the Serv-
ice's history and its place among other Gov-
ernment agencies. Packed in tightly are 
lectures and seminars on large subjects like 
"Answering Criticisms of the United States 
Abroad," "Philosophy of World Labor 
Groups," Middle East problems, Communist 
strategy, international law. For the most 
part, however, the instruction deals with 
rules and tools: how Foreign Service posts 
operate, how to promote American trade, 
how to handle routine consular duties such 
as visas, admission of aliens, intelligence 
work. There are also field trips , to such 
government agencies as an immigration 
center, an Atomic Energy Commission lab-
oratory and the Agricultural Research Cen-
ter at Beltsville, Md.

Perhaps one or two expert linguists in a 
class of 25 will go abroad immediately; the 
rest will stay in Washington for a year or 
18 months, working at desk jobs in the 
State Department and continuing their 
language studies. For it has finally dawned 
on Washington that Americans are woefully 
clumpsy with the most potent peace tool 
of all: the ability to speak other peoples' 
languages. There is now a crash program 
in language learning throughout the For-
eign Service. Besides its Washington classes, 
the Institute runs language-study centers 
in Mexico City, Paris, Frankfurt, Beirut, 
Tokyo and Taichung (on Taiwan). Using 
texts and tapes from home and tutors hired 
locally, it gives extension courses to some 
2,700 U.S. employees at 158 overseas posts. 
On the institute faculty there are nearly 
200 instructors, half of whom are foreign-
born tutors in 22 languages. The school's 
corridors buzz at coffee breaks with conver-
sations in Burmese, Cambodian, Persian, 
and other exotic tongues. The course is 
probably the world's most intensive. The 
method used is "overlearning"?constant 
reiteration to achieve speech that is in-
stinctively correct. Hour after hour, in 
groups of six or less, the trainees sit in cu-
bicles with phonetic lesson sheets before 
them and learn, by repeating phrases after 
the tutor, to coordinate tongue, ear and 
brain in foreign patterns. They also prac-
tice "kinesics," the motions and gestures 
of head, hands and body proper to the 
language they are learning. 
In off hours the trainees have at their 
disposal an audio-tape practice room, nick-
named "Babel," containing three dozen 
booths, each with a two-track tape recorder. 
Turning on his machine, the student hears 
a tutor speak. He echoes the words into his 
then plays back both voices. Spotting 
his own mistakes, he can erase his track, then 
try over and over again. In the tape library 
are rolls containing courses in 43 languages. 
Wives are considered so important that, 
before posting abroad, they are invited to the 
Institute for coaching in foreign amenities?
dress, deportment, handling of servants. In 
charge of this program is Mrs. M. Williams 
Blake, a Foreign Service widow with ex-
perience in nine countries. 
For the Institute's mid-career course, 
promising officers of 10 or 12 years' service 
are picked, in groups of about 20, to be-
come higher-powered administrators, an-
alysts, negotiators. Each group is first se-
questered for a fortnight on an old Army 
post at Front Royal, Va., where they study 
typical problems a mission might face. Ex-
ample: What aspects. of U.S. life should an 
American contribution to an international 
trade fair stress? 
Back in Washington, the group plunges 
into sociology. Professor Marion J. Levy of 
Princeton, for one, expounds to them such 
subjects as the contrasting effects of West-
ernization on the old cultures and politics 
of China and Japan, and what lessons the 
contrast teaches about the modernization 
of underdeveloped countries today. 
Then, to learn the inside facts about our 
national policies and our present strength, 
the midcareerists are briefed by top Gov-
ernment brass. 
Gordon Gray, special assistant to the 
President for national security affairs, ex-
plains the workings of our highest, most 
secret policy body?the National Security 
Council. The Chiefs of the State Depart-
ment's Bureau of Intelligence and Research 
and of the Central Intelligence Agency set 
forth their techniques for studying our 
country's friends and foes. George Allen, 
boss of the United States Information 
Agency, lectures on good propaganda and 
bad. ("I don't like that phrase, 'selling 
ourselves.' One hard fact-is worth a gallon 
of hogwash.") 
A Congressman reports congressional tem-
peratures on foreign policy, and what deter-
mines them. Leading publicists interpret 
present-day U.S. culture and attitudes, 
which often startle Foreign Service officers 
after years abroad. The midcareerists may 
also hear authoritatively from industry, la-
bor, the pulpit and universities. 
The Institute's senior course, new last Sep-
tember, enrolls only a dozen Foreign Service 
officers of the three top ranks (average age, 
43) , plus maybe a half dozen seniors from 
other services, including the military. 
Among them are officers already serving or 
ready to serve as ambassador, minister, con-
sul general. Much of their 10-month course 
is devoted to advanced studies of foreign 
policy, and to preparing analytical reports on 
trips to U.S. labor and trade congresses, 
scientific conclaves, meetings of bar and 
medical associations, which bring them up to 
date on the climate of American society. 
"If we are to insure our future," Senator 
LEVERETT SALTONSTALL, Of MaSSRCIHISettS, 
said recently, "our Foreign Service officers 
would appear to be our most promising over-
seas task force." 
[From the Saturday Evening Post, Jan. 3, 
1959] 
SCHOOL FOR MODERN DIPLOMATS 
(By Henry F. and Katharine Pringle) 
Not very long ago, the typical young man 
who chose the United States Foreign Service 
as a career was a socialite, a graduate from 
an eastern seaboard college, had a private 
income and took pleasure in wearing striped 
pants. He limited his official and social con-
tacts mainly, to other diplomats. He spoke 
cultivated English and perhaps halting 
French or German. The mere notion of 
learning Arabic, Chinese, or Malayan would 
have filled him with well-bred distaste. 
Foreigners should, of course, speak English. 
Happily, much, of this has changed. Im-
portant in the evolution of our new, more 
practical style in diplomats is a unique 
school, the Foreign Service Institute, op-
erated by the State Department in Arlington, 
Va., where successful candidates for the 
Foreign Service come for training. The 
backgrounds of the students are varied. 
They come from every State in the Union, 
plus Hawaii. They are graduates of many 
different colleges, some quite small and ob-
scure. Many are ex-servicemen; some have 
had experience as businessmen, newspaper 
reporters, teachers, lawyers, and engineers. 
Ten percent of them are girls?a fact which 
would have caused yesterday's diplomat to 
choke on the olive in his martini. Before 
going abroad, all of them will, through an 
Intensive new method, learn to speak at 
least one foreign language. 
The primary purpose of the Foreign Service 
Institute is to prepare the people who repre-
sent the United States in foreign lands to do 
the best possible job. This requires a broad 
curriculum which is offered to an average 
enrollment of about 3,000 a year, including 
1,000 full-time and 2,000 part-time students. 
The full-time students include recently ap-
pointed Foreign Service officers who are un-
dergoing 3 months of basic training, followed 
by another 4 months of special language 
training if they need it. Usually there is a 
handful of senior officers, even an occasional 
ambassador, taking specialized training. In 
addition, the FSI is open to personnel of a 
number of Government agencies concerned 
with foreign affairs, such as the U.S. Informa-
tion Agency and the International Coopera-
tion Administration. Also among the stu-
dents, all voluntarily, are the wives of junior 
Foreign Service officers who want to learn 
something about the culture and customs of 
the strange posts for which they are soon to 
. depart?places such as Addis Ababa, Saigon, 
Kabul, or Taihoku. All stKlents: except the

wives, of course, draw full pay while they are 
going to school. 
The novice diplomats are instructed in 
everything from consular procedures to the 
most effective ways of answering foreigners' 
criticism of the United States. To the wives 
are unfolded the mysteries of diplomatic 
protocol. Informal meetings, limited to the 
ladies, are arranged with experienced wives 
who have served from Oslo to Cape Town. 
No questions are barred. At one such session 
was a bright-eyed girl with a blond pony tail. 
Not yet a wife, but a very earnest fiance, she 
was to be married to a junior officer just 
before he set out on his first assignment. 
"Looking ahead," she said, practically, if 
prematurely, "will I be, expected to go to 
official functions when I'm pregnant?" 
When the older wives stopped laughing, 
they told her that the answer depended 
somewhat on the post. She would certainly 
be welcome in most places, particularly in 
Latin America, where motherhood is warmly 
approved. On the other hand, the tribal 
taboos of a few African chiefs forbid receiving 
women in an expectant condition. 
Commonsense hints to the wives are given 
under the direction of Regina Olszewski 
Blake, widow of a Foreign Service officer, 
who, during the 16 years of her marriage, 
accompanied her husband to Warsaw, Basel, 
Tampico, Teheran, Rome and Dakar. A 
warmhearted, friendly and reassuring 
woman, she warns the youthful wives that 
their jobs abroad sometimes will be more 
difficult than those of their husbands, who 
will spend most of their working hours in 
the relatively American atmosphere of their 
offices. The wife is on her own in an alien 
land. She must manage the house, take 
care of the children, direct servants who 
often pretend to know more English than 
they really do, buy unfamiliar foods in 
crowded native markets and handle mechan-
ical breakdowns. Pointing up the need for 
resourcefulness, she tells the story of the 
wife at? a remote post who chewed vast 
quantities of gum in order to make plugs 
for leaks in the plumbing. 
Because the thirty to forty wives in any 
one class may be going to thirty or forty 
different posts out of the total of 278 the 
United States maintains around the world 
the general lectures cannot take up spe-
cific problems peculiar to one area. But 
Mrs. Blake keeps in her office a Post Guid-
ance file which all .wives are urged to con-
sult. Here, is detailed information, supplied 
by experienced Foreign Service wives on such 
?things as food problems and social customs 
in all parts of the world. And the new offi-
cers' wives are given personal briefings on 
practical problems in their future posts. If 
possible, Mrs. Blake arranges for a student 
who is going to, say, Afghanistan, to talk 
with a wife who has been there. In such a 
case the young wife may learn that she and 
her husband cannot expect to have Western-
style contacts with Afghan couples because 
the women there are kept in strict purdah?
seclusion. Questions about housekeeping 
get answered in these interviews. How 
long will a sheet last when washed on the 
rocks in Djakarta? About as long as when 
subjected to a Washington laundry, it ap-
pears. Is the water safe to drink in Teheran? 
Not unless it is from the Embassy's private 
water supply, as the city water system con-
sists of open jubes, or ditches, which also 
are used for washing clothes, bathing, and 
rinsing dishes. 
The wives' course is not limited to protocol 
and household hints. Along with secretaries, 
clerks, and men from other Government 
agencies assigned abroad, they may take a 
2-week orientation course in the funda-
mentals of American oversea missions. Mrs. 
Florence Finne, a slim, composed, and pretty 
Foreign Service officer, presides over these 
sessions, bringing in speakers from State 
and other departments to discuss their spe-
cialties. They explain the organization of 
Embassies and consulates. They outline 
Communist stategy and tactics. They take 
students through a quick survey of the 
American scene in politics, labor, art, agri-
culture, music, and architecture to make 
sure that representatives of the United 
States abroad will be able to talk intelli-
gently about their homeland. 
The Foreign Service Institute is tackling 
the serious challenge of language by spend-
ing 60 percent of its $5 million budget for 
the teaching of foreign tongues. The sys-
tem is called intensive or., sometimes the 
Army method. During World War II it was 
found useful for teaching Japanese and 
Pacific-area languages, which had been con-
sidered extremely difficult to learn. The FSI 
language classes are tough. 
At first, they purposely avoid teaching 
rules of grammar, and rely on long hours 
of drill until the new vocabulary and idiom 
are so well learned that the pupil thinks 
in the language. 
Under the new system an astonishing 
number of Foreign Service officers are mas-
tering not only Spanish, French, and German 
but also such tongues as Russian, Polish, 
Czech, Serbo-Croatian, Finnish, Greek, Turk-
ish, Arabic, Hindustani, Mandarin Chinese, 
Japanese, Burmese, and Korean. A few stu-
dents simply cannot adjust their vocal cords 
or curl their tongues in the right way. Once 
in a while a student, unable to stand the in-
tensive drill, collapses into hysterics and 
quits. But such failures are rare. 
This new emphasis on learning at least one 
foreign language well reflects a change in 
U.S. conception of diplomacy since World 
War II. The old idea was that our repre-
sentative abroad was a delegate from our 
Government to the foreign government. 
The modern conception is that he is also our 
representative to the people of the host na-
tion. It is no longer good enough for the 
Foreign Service officer to associate mainly 
with a few members of the foreign ministry. 
He has a, basic obligation to know the peo-
ple?something best achieved by talking 
with them in their own language. 
In November 1956, Secretary of State Dulles 
approved a new language policy for the For-
eign Service under which all officers would 
be expected to acquire a useful knowledge of 
at least one foreign language within 5 years 
or within the same period after appointment, 
and preferably fluency in a second language 
as well. Junior officers would not be pro-
moted until they had met the requirement. 
Exceptions would sometimes be made for 
senior officers or others whose post did not 
provide opportunities for language learning. 
It would hardly have been feasible to force 
the minority of political ambassadors to be-
come fluent before taking up their duties. 
But our Ambassador to Brazil, Ellis 0. Briggs, 
a career officer who already knew Spanish, 
volunteered to take 3 months of intensive 
training in Portuguese at the FSI. So did 
Mrs. Briggs. 
This past year the FSI had classes going 
full time in 27 different tongues. In charge 
of this rather staggering program is Howard 
E. Sollenberger, dean. of the School of Lan-
guages. He has been bilingual from child-
hood, having been raised in North China by 
missionary parents. Before joining the FSI, 
Sollenberger taught Chinese to workers of 
the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation 
Administration and prepared them for serv-
ice in the Far East. 
? Sollenberger has a staff of about 100 tutors 
or native speakers, some of them part time, 
and 20 full-time linguistic scientists?many 
of whom oversee classes in more than one 
language. The linguistic scientists worry the 
students as little as possible with textbook 
rules. People communicate by talking far 
more than by writing; besides, the way a 
language is written is often no key to the 
way it is spoken. 
March 5 
The new policy already is beginning to pay 
dividends. Take the case of a youthful con-
sul, Robert E. Barbour, assigned to Vietnam. 
Before going to his post he was sent to 
Georgetown University, in Washington, for 
his preliminary work in Vietnamese, and 
then went through several months' grind It 
at the PSI. When he reported to Ambas-
sador Elbridge Durbrow in Vietnam, he was 
instructed to spend his first 3 months in 
further concentration on the language. By 
the time the new American consulate opened 
at Hue, a seaport north of Saigon, the young 
man had made the acquaintance of all the 
provincial chiefs and other officials in his 
area. He invited 180 of them to the opening 
ceremonies, where he translated the Ambas-
sador's remarks and those of the Vietnamese 
representative. Durbrow reported to the 
State Department that the Vietnamese were 
deeply gratified by the new consul's fluency 
in their own language. 
Reading and writing are not ignored in 
the FBI's language classes. The importance 
of being able to read the language of the 
host country was demonstrated not long 
ago in Indonesia. Until an officer who 
could read the native papers in the original 
language was sent to Djakarta, the State 
Department had 'not been fully aware of 
their anti.American tone. The Embassy's 
Indonesian employees had been clipping 
and translating only the news and editorial 
items which, they thought, would please 
their American bosses. 
All this reflects the postwar American 
anxiety to make friends and influence peo-
ple abroad. The same spirit pervades the 
whole FSI curriculum. An anthropologist, 
D. Scott Gilbert, is on hand to impress on 
students the importance of understanding 
and respecting the cultures and customs of 
other peoples. Gilbert shares with Other 
institute lecturers a tendency to toss off 
high-flown anthropological terms, to cau-
tion against "ethnocentricism" and "culture 
shock." But the talks boil down to a very 
sensible warning not to go abroad with the 
set conviction that the American way of 
life is superior in all?ways to all others. 
Another name for the FSI might be 
School for Dos and Don'ts in the Foreign 
Service. These classifications are hammered 
into the young men and women from 9 
a.m. to 5:30 p.m., with case histories to 
underline the point. There was, for in-
stance, the brash junior officer who had 
been assigned to visa work in Manila. An 
attractive young Filipino girl came to the 
consulate to have her passport validated. 
The vice consul looked at her pretty face 
and legs and made a wisecrack. 
"I suppose you're going to the United 
States to snag yourself a rich husband?" 
The girl's father happened to be a promi-
nent official of the islands. She reported 
the vice consul's impertinence to papa, and 
within a couple of weeks the offending 
young man was on his way home, his For-
eign Service career at an end. 
Advice on how to make use of the cus-
toms of the country is given by experts 
such as William Barnes, former chief of the 
State Department's foreign-reporting staff. 
One morning last year Barnes concluded a 
solemn discussion of the problems of ob-
taining and analyzing economic data abroad 
with a story of his own experience in Fin-
land. One of the best ways to collect eco-
nomic information there, he had discovered, 
was to attend a sauna, or steam-bath 
party, with a group of Finnish bankers and 
industrialists. A sauna involves being par-
boiled, naked, at high temperature in a 
steam room, after which the participants 
plunge into the frigid waters of an adjoin-
ing lake. Thus stimulated, and still naked, 
the guests relax on a porch with their host 
and sip drinks. At this stage, said Barnes, 
they are likely to talk very frankly abdut 
their problems.

"Under the circumstances," he observed, 
"it is hard for them to play their cards close 
to their chests." 
How and how not to use an interpreter 
)is the subject of a hilarious PSI skit which 
acknowledges a debt to "The Teahouse of 
the August Moon." Performed regularly for 
: each new group of junior officers, the pur-
pose of the playlet is to dramatize the mis-
takes that an inexperienced Foreign Service 
officer might make. 
The scene is a seaport town on Okinawa. 
In a performance last fall, Richard Noss, 
of the language staff, played the role of a 
newly arrived American vice couiasul calling 
on the mayor. Two of the institute's tutors, 
Kiyanao Okami and Teruki Komatsu, repre-
sented the mayor and the vice consul's inter-
preter. The three scholars showed surprising 
histrionic talent. The vice consul was 
brusque and in a hurry. He told the inter-
preter to tell the mayor he had only fif-
teen minutes. 
"Express to the mayor some noble sen-
timents and all that," he said. "Keep it 
brief. Tell him three United States Senators 
are arriving next week and I'm in charge 
of the reception." 
An interminable conversation in Japa-
nese, the language used in Okinawa, ensued 
between Messrs. Okami and Komatsu, with 
much bowing and scraping, followed by this 
dialogue in English: . 
"Vrcz CONSUL. What was that all about? 
"INTERPRETER. He talk and talk a long 
time. 
"V*Icz CONSUL. I could see that. What 
did he say? Keep it short. 
"INTERPRETER. Mayor expressed apprecia-
tion of kind sentiments. Said he wished to 
discuss important matter?American air-
base expansion which robbing the farmers 
of their land. 
"VICE CONSUL. Oh, tell him all I want is 
to have him go to the airport to meet the 
Senators, to take some important people 
with him. Nanki-Poo! Funny costumes! All 
that kind of stuff." 
Okami and Komatsu engaged in another 
long exchange in Japanese. The interpreter 
then explained that the mayor was inviting 
the American official to his house for tea, 
to which the vice consul replied that he 
hated tea, "but I'll take a rain check." 
"Rain check?" asked the puzzled inter-
preter. This involved the vice consul in a 
long explanation of the rules applying to 
American baseball tickets. 
After the playlet ended, amid laughter, 
Noss summed up its lessons. The misunder-
standings were not merely funny, he warned. 
They might have been disastrous. The con-
sular officer should have addressed his re-
marks directly to the mayor, and not to the 
interpreter. He should have assumed that 
the Okinawan official understood some 
English, as he probably did. The vice consul 
should not have used American colloquial-
isms. And obviously he should not have 
ignored the expected formalities, nor rudely 
brushed aside the subjects which the mayor 
wished to raise. 
The Foreign Service Institute is without 
doubt? a livelier and more effective teaching 
agency today than it was a few year's ago. 
The school was established in March 1947. 
With the greatest expansion of the Service 
after World War II, it was essential to train 
large numbers of new officers to get along 
with foreign peoples and to report their 
activities accurately. But within the next 
few years the morale of the State Depart-
ment and of the Foreign Service slumped, 
due largely to the claim of the late Joseph 
R. McCarthy that Communists had infil-
trated. The Institute became something of 
a stepchild, badly housed on C Street at a 
short distance from the State Department. 
In March 1954, the Secretary of State 
appointed a distinguished committee, of 
which Henry M. Wriston, then president of 
RECORD ? SENATE 
Brown University, was chairman, to appraise 
the Department's personnel policies. Its re-
port was highly critical. The Foreign Service 
officer corps, it found, numbered only 1,285, 
the lowest strength in 5 years. Only 355 of-
ficers had been appointed to the beginning-
officer classification in the past 8 years. One 
remedy proposed by the committee was that 
Foreign Service officers should be recruited 
from all parts of the country, bringing the 
Service closer to g democratic ideal. 
Today there is no shortage df candidates. 
Last year nearly 340 new junionofficers were 
selected from among 6,500 hopefuls who took 
the examinations. Many are attracted by 
the lure of strange places, by an aura of 
glamour which still clings to the Foreign 
Service. They can be sure of fairly complete 
security and of salaries ranging from $4,730 
at the bottom to a top of $20,000, plus some 
expense allowances. 
In its criticisms of the Foreign Service, the 
Wriston report described the Foreign Serv-
ice Institute as having fallen into the "in-
tellectual doldrums." It had not measured 
up to the standards envisionedlay Congress, 
which had hoped for an institution compa-
rable to the Naval and Army War Colleges. 
In March 1955 Harold B. Hoskins was made 
Director of the PSI, and the Institute began 
a rapid emergence from obscurity. Hoskins, 
In his early sixties, is not an educator, but a 
businessman of wide experience. Born in 
Beirut, the son of missionaries, Hoskins' 
hobby for years has been the role of the 
United States in foreign affairs. He has often 
served the State Department as a consultant 
on Middle Eastern economic problems and 
gone on missions to Arab nations. His abil-
ity as a salesman, acquired during his indus-
trial career, has been of great value in ex-
plaining the FSI's budget to congressional 
committees. 
Congress has been fairly generous. Among 
other things,. the FSI no longer need apolo-
gize for its quarters, which are efficient, if 
not luxurious. Since the spring of 1957 the 
classrooms, offices, and auditorium have been 
housed in what used to be the lower-floor 
garage of Arlington Towers, one of the plush 
apartment developments on the outskirts of 
Washington. The space has been divided 
into two floors, and has a functional all-
glass front that extends for about a block 
along one wing of the building. This setting 
gives more of a government than a campus 
atmosphere to the school. 
The prestige of the Foreign Service Insti-
tute, which was quite low for a time in the 
eyes of State Department brass, gained 
ground in the last 3 years. Last September 
even Secretary Dulles took an hour out of 
his whirlwind schedule to inaugurate the 
first senior-officer course, the State Depart-
ment's equivalent of the Defense War Col-
lege. 
Hoskins and his assistants are constantly 
pondering what should be added, subtracted 
or modified to kep the FSI in tune with 
needs of the Foreign Service. They are now 
concerned that the courses for midcareer 
officers may not be stimulating enough in-
dependent thinking. They are worried about 
the area specialization courses, although the 
very fact that the Foreign Service now has 
some 400 specialists trained in Near and 
Far Eastern and Iron Curtain country lan-
guages and problems is encouraging. Should 
there be more economics taught at the FSI? 
More on international-labor movements? 
Most impartial observers of the FSI would 
probably agree that its intensive language 
training and its advice for living and working 
with other peoples are its major contribu-
tions to diplomacy in today's troubled world. 
The down-to-earth tutoring goes much 
deeper than protocol or the right clothes 
for Rangoon. The young Officers, their wives 
and clerical personnel are all* urged to keep 
up their hobbies abroad or develop some, for 
many doors to friendships will thereby be 
2989 
opened. They are told about the consul who 
was assigned to Lourenco Marques, the capi-
tal of Portuguese Mozambique. He was an 
avid amateur ornithologist and was delighted 
to find that few places in the world had so 
great a variety of strange birds as this out-
post. He made contacts with the local orni-
thologists and won their gratitude by giving 
his leisure time to helping out at the natu-
ral-history museum. Then there was the 
diplomat's wife who was a ham radio opera-
tor. When an earthquake tumbled buildings 
in Quito, Ecuador, and disrupted commu-
nications, she was able to send out messages 
and assist rescue expeditions. She was deco-
rated by the Ecuadoran Government for her 
services. 
The young people who will leave shortly 
for their first foreign posts are warned 
against yearning for London, Paris or one of 
the other great capitals. The work at a 
smaller embassy may be much more reward-
ing and important. They are also cautioned 
against being disappointed if they are as-
signed to consular work, as 60 percent of 
them are sure to be. The consul's job may 
not seem dashing, but it deals closely with 
people. 
"We've got an American dying here. What 
shall we do?" is one of the more troublesome 
inquiries a consul may have from a hotel or 
boardinghouse. In a case some years ago a 
lazy but imaginative consul in Indochina 
solved his problem by persuading an Ameri-
can at death's door to take out French citi-
zenship, "to avoid being a damned nuisance 
to me when you pop off." That sort of thing 
is frowned on these days. The consul is 
supposed to see that a fellow citizen felled by 
Illness has proper medical attention and, if 
the worst happens, to locate the deceased's 
relatives, perhaps arrange a funeral, or to 
settle his estate.. One consul found himself 
handling the sale of a large herd of cattle. 
Live Americans abroad, however, are even 
more of a problem than dead ones?at least 
to a consul. They may demand anything on 
earth, including funds to go home. The 
Foreign Service is trained to help as much as 
It can, but there are limits. That is why 
one of the most respected rules taught its 
students by the PSI is: "Never lend your own 
money." 
Mr. SALTONSTALL. Mr. President, 
the Foreign Service Institute offers what 
is perhaps the best intensive training in 
more foreign languages than is avail-
able in any other educational institu-
tion in the United States. 
The purpose of the bill (S. 1243) which 
I have introduced with the Senator from 
Montana [Mr. MANSFIELD] is in part to 
establish standards of foreign language 
proficiency for our Foreign Service and 
to assure utmost use of the Institute's 
facilities in achieving and maintaining 
such standards. 
While it is important to recognize that 
foreign language proficiency will not in 
and of itself assure high-caliber per-
formance of oversea service, it is hard 
to conceive of such service being effec-
tively rendered by Americans who are 
blind, mute and deaf to the language of 
people of the countries where they serve. 
Secretary of State Dulles wrote as fol-
lows in the 19th semiannual report to 
Congress on the international education 
exchange program: 
True communication among people of dif-
ferent cultures is greatly enhanced by the 
ability to speak and to read each others' 
language. 
Surely no one can disagree with this 
statement.

2990 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
In this connection, I am reminded of 
a statement by the great German poet, 
Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, who 
wrote: 
A man who is ignorant of foreign languages 
is ignorant of his own. 
Goethe's statement, probably made 
with only semantics in mind, has spe-
cial subtlety and wisdom as applied to 
the task of communication in our over-
sea representation. The same is true 
of a statement by Samuel Johnson, which 
all of us who travel from Washington 
by train have seen many times over the 
entrance to Union Station. 
He that would bring home the wealth of 
the Indies must carry the wealth of the 
Indies with him. So it is in traveling: a 
man must carry knowledge with him if he 
would bring home knowledge. 
The application of these statements 
to our people who go abroad is dramati-
cally illustrated in the much-publicized 
book "The Ugly American." This book 
has done much to focus public attention 
on the deficiencies in the international 
orientation of our people and the handi-
caps which these deficiencies impose on 
our oversea operations. 
Mr. President, I ask unanimous con-
sent to have printed in the RECORD some 
excerpts which I have made from the 
last chapter of "The Ugly American." 
There being no objection, the excerpts 
were ordered to be printed in the REC-
ORD, as follows: 
[Excerpts from ch. 22, "A Factual Epilog," 
of "The Ugly American," by William J. 
Lederer and Eugene Burdick] 
It would seem a simple fact of life that 
Ambassadors to at least the major nations 
should speak those languages. Yet in France, 
Italy, Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, 
Norway, and Turkey, our Ambassadors cannot 
speak the native tongue (although our Am-
bassador to Paris can speak German and our 
Ambassador to Berlin can speak French). In 
the whole of the Arabic world?nine na-
tions?only two Ambassadors have language 
qualifications. In Japan, Korea, Burma, 
Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia, and else-
where, our Ambassadors must speak and be 
spoken to through interpreters. In the en-
tire Communist world, only our Ambassador 
to Moscow can speak the native language. 
If Ambassadors were mere figureheads sur-
rounded by experienced, linguistically 
trained career diplomats, their inability to 
speak or read on the job would be little more 
than an insulting inconvenience to the local 
officials. * * * Unfortunately, Ambassadors 
are more than figureheads; they are in charge, 
and, like Sears, their misunderstandings can 
have grave consequences. Moreover, the ca-
reer men on their staffs are generally not 
linguistically trained for their jobs. * * ? 
In his masterful analysis of the Foreign 
Service, John Osborne states that the most 
important element in a good Foreign Service 
officer is the faculty of communication. 
Yet, as James Reston reported in the New 
York Times of March 18, 1958, "50 percent 
of the entire Foreign Service officer corps 
do not have a speaking knowledge of any 
foreign language. Seventy percent of the 
new men coming into the Foreign Service 
are in the same state." These figures rep-
resent those Who can speak no language 
other than their own?not even French, 
Spanish, German, or Italian. The number 
of Americans in the Foreign Service who can 
speak any of the more difficult languages is 
miniscule. 
In addition to our Foreign Service staffs, 
we have more than a million servicemen 
overseas. Only a handful can speak the 
language of the country in which they are 
stationed, and when difficult military and 
scientific data are involved this handful 
shrinks to almost zero. So be it, but that 
our trained representatives in Asia are little 
better qualified in languages is unacceptable. 
On the other hand, an estimated 9 out of 
10 Russians speak, read, and write the lan-
guage before the arrive on station. It is a 
prior requirement. The entire functioning 
staff of Russian Embassies in Asia is Rus-
sian, and all the Russians?the officials, 
stenographic help, telephone operators, 
chauffeurs, servants?speak and write the 
language of the host country. 
In the American Embassies the servants, 
the messengers, and the interpreters are 
locally hired. The telephone operator in al-
most every American mission and agency 
in Asia is an Asian. It is, of course, a 
maxim of espionage that one of the most 
useful agents is the planted employee. * * * 
Because we must rely on interpreters who 
are almost always non-Americans, our on-
the-spot information is both secondhand and 
subject to minor censorship and editing 
without our knowledge. The recent turmoil 
in Indonesia emphasized this handicap. We 
had to rely on native translators to interpret 
the press, the radio, and personal conversa-
, 
tion. Following Asian etiquette, by which 
one avoids telling one's employer of matters 
which would distress him, the interpreters 
gave our diplomats rose-tinted reports of 
local sentiment and events. Only after a 
dangerous delay did it seep through to our 
soundproofed representatives that Indonesia 
was in the grip of political upheaval. In 
Indochina our military and diplomatic mis-
sions could speak only to the French, whose 
view of the rebellion against them was one-
sided, to say the least. One of the authors 
seeking to hear the Vietnamese side of the 
question without using either a French 
or Vietnamese interpreter succeeded only 
through an American priest, who, like the 
Father Finian of our book, was fluent in 
the native tongue. Like the Russians, but 
unlike ourselves, the church realizes that 
its work in Asia cannot be done without close 
communication with Asians. 
Blockage of information itself is not the 
only penalty we pay. Think, for a moment, 
what it costs us whenever an official Ameri-
can representative demands that the native 
speak English or be not heard. The Rus-
sians make no such mistake. The sign on 
the Russian Embassy in Ceylon, for exam-
ple, identifies it in Sinhalese, Tamil, Eng-
lish, and Russian. The American Embassy 
is identified only in English. 
John Foster Dulles stated what was in 
our minds when we wrote the stories of 
Colonel Hillandale, the Ragtime Kid, and 
John Colvin, on the one hand, and of Sears 
and Swift and Joe Bing, on the other. He 
said, "Interpreters are no substitute. It is 
not possible to understand what is in the 
minds of other people without understand-
ing their language, and without understand-
ing their language it is impossible to be sure 
that they understand what is on our minds." 
* * 
Americans like Swift, who cannot speak 
the language, can have no more than an aca-
demic understanding of a country's customs, 
beliefs, religion, and humor. Restricted to 
communication with only that special, small, 
and usually well-to-do segment of the na-
tive population fluent in English, they re-
ceive a limited and often misleading picture 
of the nation about them. A recent Ameri-
can ambassador to Ceylon?an able, ex-
tremely popular diplomat?had an experi-
ence which pointed up this dilemma. He 
had become intimate with the leaders of the 
political party, in power, a group relict of 
colonial days composed largely of the rich 
and English-educated upper class. The am-
bassador apparently got all his information 
March 
from them, because he gave no warning to 
our State Department before the national 
istic political upheaval occurred which sud-
denly left his friends with but 8 of 101 seats 
in the government. 
On the other side of the ledger, we have 
told the seory of the ugly engineer and 
Colonel Hillandale who, speaking the lan-
guage, were able to go off into the country-2 
side and show the idea of America to the 
people. These characters are based on actual 
Americans known to the authors. There 
are others. like them; but by and large they 
are not beloved of the American officials in 
the various Asian' capitals, and are a wild 
exception to the rule. 
While a few Hillandales and the many 
Russians roam the barrios and the boon-
docks, most Americans are restricted, both 
by official tethers and by language barriers, 
to communion with each other. * * * 
* * ? * * 
Vice President NixoN, in his National Press 
Club speech on his tour of Latin America, 
said, "I could have concentrated on a whole 
round of cocktail parties and white-tie din-
ners. If we continue to concentrate on that 
area we can figure we will lose the battle." 
What our diplomats need to do, he said, is 
to get out and mingle with students, labor 
leaders, and opinion makers, who comprise 
the "wave of the future." 
? ? ? * 
In the stories of Major Wolchek and Major 
Monet, "The Iron of War" and "The Lesson 
of War," we have tried in fiction to describe 
a condition of avoidable ignorance. For 
years both we and OUT allies have put in 
much expensive effort trying to ferret out in 
advance the Communist plan for both tacti-
cal maneuvers and great conquests. Yet, 
during the struggle in Indochina the authors 
could find no American (or French) military 
or civilan official who had read, or even 
studied a precis of, the overall Communist 
operation plan contained in "The Selected 
Works of Mao Tse-Tung," published by 
Lawrence Wishart, Ltd., London, and Inter-
national Publishers in the United States. A 
four-volume edition was published in 1954 
but the basic material was available in print 
as early as 1934. (A useful shorter study is 
"The Organizational Weapon: A Study of 
Bolshevik Strategy and Tactics," by Philip 
Selznick, McGraw-Hill, 1952J 
In his remarkable work Mao, one of the 
brilliant tacticians of our time, analyzes 
almost every campaign and battle in which 
his Red Armies fought. He dissects every 
defeat (very few) and most victories, and he 
explains what they taught him. In doing so 
he lays down a pattern of strategy and tactics 
which the Communists of southeast ,Asia 
have followed undeviatingly. 
The battles which led to Dien Bien Phu 
were classic examples of the Mao pattern 
And yet our military missions advised, and 
the French went down to defeat, without 
having studied Mao's writings. 
Why our representatives abroad have not 
learned the languages they need or studied 
basic sources of information such as Mao' 
writings is a question which involves the 
entire American Nation. Whatever the rea-
sons, our overseas services attract far too fe 
of our brightest and best qualified college 
graduates. * * *

? ? ? ? ? 
Actually, the state in which we find our-
s elves is far from hopeless. We have the 
aterial and, above all, the human re-
s2urces to change our methods and to win. 
It is not the fault of the Government or its 
leaders or any political party that we have 
acted as we have. It is the temper of the 
whole Nation. If knowledge of the problem 
becomes widespread, and if the enthusiasm 
of the people can be aroused, then we can 
succeed. As Cordell Hull once said, "The 
Government of the United States is never 
far ahead of the American public; nor is it 
very far behind." 
Mr. SALTONSTALL. Mr. President, 
the bill which I have filed with the Sena-
tor from Montana [Mr. MANSFIELD] 
would insert in the Foreign Service Act 
of 1946 a statement of policy to govern 
the appointment of chiefs of mission 
and Foreign Service officers which could 
profitably be adopted by all Americans 
who go overseas. In a very real sense, 
any of us who goes abroad is represent-
ng the United States, regardless of our 
purpose. Whether such representation 
of our country will serve her well or ill 
will largely depend on the extent to 
hich we 'apply to ourselves the policy 
which the bill would prescribe for the 
ppointment of chiefs of mission and 
reign Service officers. 
Mr. President, the policy declaration ? 
ontained in section 1 of my bill reads 
follows: 
It is the policy of the Congress that chiefs 
f mission and Foreign Service officers ap-
pointed to serve the United states in foreign 
ountries shall have, to the maximum prac-
icable extent, among their qualifications a 
seful knowledge of the principal language 
3r dialect of the country in which they are 
o serve, and knowledge and understanding 
f the history, the culture, the economic, and 
olitical institutions, and the interests of 
uch country and its people. 
The responsible officials of the Depart-
ent of State have unquestionably, in 
y judgment, been working hard at the 
ask of improving the foreign language 
roficiency of our Foreign Service offi-
ers. Because of the limited funds for 
alaries and administrative and training 
xpenses which the Congress appropri-
tes to the State Department, the rate of 
rogress possible in this vital aspect of 
raining leaves much to be desired. Sec-
ion 2 of my bill would add to the Foreign 
ervice Act a new -section to establish 
e framework within which a more vig-
rous program of foreign language 
aining could be established, assuming. 
at the Congress appropriates the funds 
ecessary for its full implementation. 
Sections 3 and 4 of the bill would make 
gnificant additions to the authority of 
e Secretary of ttate in order further 
facilitate tapping to the full the ex-
llent training activities of the Foreign 
ervice Institute and to create incentives 
r all Foreign Service personnel to take 
dvantage of such activities. 
Mr. President, we must leave no stone 
nturned in our efforts to assure that 
ur Foreign Service personnel have the 
tmost in qualifications that institution-
ized training can give?especially in the 
eld of foreign languages. In addition 
) their ramified duties as representa-
tives of the United States, the people of 
our Foreign Service are our first line of 
defense and the strongest offensive force 
which our peace-loving society can 
muster. 
Mr. President, in closing, I ask unani-
mous consent to have printed in the REC-
ORD a number of articles relating to tne 
subjects I have discussed. 
There being no objection, the articles 
were ordered to be printed in the RECORD, 
as follows: 
[From the Neiv Bedford (Mass.) Standard-
Times, Jan. 21, 1959] ? ? 
SILENT SPOKESMEN ABROAD 
John B. Fisher, former administrative as-
sistant and chief political aid to Senator 
SALTONSTALL, Republican, Massachusetts, re-
cently returned from his fourth trip to the 
Middle East with some forthright criticism 
of the U.S. Foreign Service. 
A New Bedford audience heard Mr. Fisher 
direct particular attention to the language 
training of State Department representa-
tives abroad, which he described as so ele-
mentary as to be no training at all?in our 
embassies abroad fewer than five or six 
Americans in an Embassy can speak the 
language of the country ilrwhich they serve. 
In Belgrade, only 3 of 44 Americans can 
speak the Yugoslav national tongue. 
In Athens, only 6 of 79 Americans in the 
Foreign Service can speak modern Greek 
dialects fluently. 
In New Delhi, the United States has no 
personnel who can speak the several Indian 
dialects required for effective communica-
tion there. By contrast, the Russians have 
specific training courses in Moscow devoted 
exclusively to training diplomats for Indian 
service. 
As Mr. Fisher concluded on the basis of 
this unenviable record, "In other words, our 
spokesmen abroad can't speak?hence, are 
no spokesmen at all." 
This is a dangerous, if not tragic, situa-
tion in a world in which nations must 
know in precise detail what is going on 
virtually every minute. To be uninformed 
could mean failure to survive in the present 
East-West power struggle of the cold war. 
If, as Mr. Fisher declared, "the State De-
partment almost automatically rejects every 
proposal to improve our Foreign Service," 
Congress should embark upon a study of the 
situation, aimed at overriding and overhaul-
ing the State Department system. The pro-
gram for training Foreign Service officers 
should be broadened and intensified. 
With regard to language abilities of Amer-
icans in general, there is another approach 
that might be made, Dr. James Bryant 
Conant, president emeritus of Harvard, has 
been studying America's high schools for 
the last 2 years. Dr. Conant commented, 
"Almost without exception, I found a de-
plorable state of affairs in regard to foreign 
languages. Too many students with limited 
ability were studying a foreign language for 
2 years; too few able students were studying 
one language long enough." 
Americans mu,st devote earnest attention 
to this problem, all the way from the high 
school class to the level of the Secretary 
of State. To misunderstand or to be mis-
understood in the delicately balanced family 
of nations is riskier than ever these days. 
[From the Reading (Mass.) Chronicle, 
Feb. 5, 1959] 
OUR REPRESENTATIVES ABROAD 
Our foreign policy has many b,ngles. It 
is criticized by many who know very little 
about the actual situation in many of the 
countries involved. Then again, it is some-
times constructively criticized by someone 
with some real knowledge of foreign coun-
tries. 
2991 
"A little simple honesty in our relations 
abroad?a little old-fashioned patriotism at 
home:'?these words of wisdom were recently 
spoken by John B. Fisher, a partner in 
Joyce & Fisher Associates of Washington and 
Boston before a joint service clubs lunch-
eon in Washington. Fisher is a former ad-
ministrative assistant and chief political 
aid to Senator SALTONSTALL and has recently 
returned from his fourth trip to the Middle 
East in the past 12 months. He was em-
phatic in his criticism of the Department of 
State and of our Foreign Service in that 
part of the world. ? 
"East is East and West is West, but the 
twain have met?long since," said Fisher, "a 
fact of which our diplomatic representa-
tives abroad seem wholly unconscious. Our 
policies and practices in Greece, Turkey and 
Iran, for example, threaten disaster for us 
and for them. We seem to do even the right 
things in the wrong way. 
"I found our Department of State disliked 
and distrusted throughout this area. I 
found our Foreign Service personnel con-
sidered fearfully ill-equipped to deal with 
the people and problems among which they 
work. And this, I know from other travel-
lers abroad, is not an unusual situation. 
"Our Foreign Service is, on the whole, in-
adequate to America's vital needs abroad?
inadequate in its recruitment program, in 
the training of its personnel and in its pro-
tocol-ridden, ingrown operations in count-
less cities around the world. 
"The Department of State almost auto-
matically rejects every proposal to improve 
our Foreign Service. The dangerous impli-
cations of this are beyond description: 
"The recommendation that a Foreign Serv-
ice Academy be established comparable to 
West Point and Annapolis is dismissed for 
the most absurd of reasons. 
"The language training of our Foreign 
Service personnel is so elementary as to be 
no training at all?in our embassies in a 
dozen major capitals abroad fewer than five 
or six Americans on embassy duty can speak 
the language of the country in which they 
serve. 
"For example: In Belgrade, the capital of 
Yugoslavia, only 3 of 44 Americans on duty 
in that Embassy there can speak Serb-Croat, 
the Yugoslav national tongue; in Athens, 
not more than half a dozen of our 79 Amer-
icans in Foreign Service can speak modern 
Greek dialects fluently; in New Delhi, the 
capital of India, we have no personnel who 
can speak the several Indian dialects re-
quired for effective communication there, 
whereas the Russians are known to have 
specific training courses in Moscow for Indian 
service alone. 
"In other words, our spokesmen abroad 
can't speak?hence are no spokesmen at all. 
This is worse than a crime; it is a political 
blunder of the first magnitude?and we, as 
American citizens, are to blame for not in-
sisting on the very best representation 
abroad, in our own interest, in our own 
defense. 
"Most important of all, perhaps, is our 
Government's failure to make use of our able, 
well-informed businessmen in these nations.

AN AMBASSADOR NEEDS THE POWER OF SPEECH 
Senator SALTONSTALL, of Massachusetts, 
believes it is important for American officials 
in Foreign Service to speak the language of 
the country in which they are serving. He 
has introduced a bill to advance his idea. 
He would require that certain posts in cer-
tain countries be filled by Foreign Service 
officers who can speak the native tongue. 
This might seem elementary in diplomacy, 
aS it would in business. But Senator SAL-
TONSTALL had apparently read a recent story 
by James Reston of the New York Times.

CONGRESSIONAL 
It revealed that 50 percent of our. Foreign 
Service officers have no speaking knowledge 
of any foreign language. These are men and 
women, remember, who sought a lifetime 
career in diplomacy. Mr. Reston further 
disclosed that our Ambassador in Moscow, 
Llewellyn Thompson, is the only one we have 
in a Communist country who speaks the 
native language; that only two American 
Ambassadors in the nine Arab States speak 
Arabic; and that even in the West, we have 
Ambassadors in eight NATO countries who 
suffer from a similar handicap. 
Such language failure puts us at a severe 
disadvantage, by comparison with the Rus-
sians and all other leading nations. We are 
the only ones who do not demand language 
proficiency for Foreign Service. We are the 
ones, too, who are most likely to be thought 
arrogant and superior when we ignore the 
languages of other nations. 
The Saltonstall bill may start something 
of a revolution in our Foreign Service. The 
reform is painfully overdue. Daniel Defoe 
determined long ago that he would venture 
the injury of giving a woman more tongues 
than one. Our Foreign Service could hardly 
venture less, in sending men and women -out 
to represent us in the capitals of a troubled 
and sensitive world.

OUR TONGUETIED FOREIGN SERVICE 
(By Leon and Leila Poullada) 
An editorial in the October 1956 issue of 
the Journal, from which the title of this 
article is shamelessly borrowed, pointed up 
the need to develop adequate language skills 
in the Foreign Service: While the Depart-
nient has been making noteworthy progress 
in the matter of language and area training 
at the Foreign Service Institute more vigor-
ous efforts are required if we are really to 
untie the tongues of our Foreign Service em-
ployees. 
Language training programs can, like Gaul, 
be divided into three parts: 
1. Programs designed to arouse the interest 
of Foreign Service employees and their de-
pendents in languages: The Foreign Service 
Institute has done commendable work on 
programs of this type and they are gradually 
gaining momentum and popularity. No 
matter how well-conceived this type of pro-
gram may be, however, its limitations should 
be recognized. Its principal values lie in the 
psychological effect on the foreign population 
of having Americans sufficiently interested 
in their country to try to learn their lan-
guage, and the satisfaction the student feels 
in being able to communicate with servants, 
shop in the bazaar, and so forth. By its 
very nature, however, this type of general 
program cannot produce a corps of fluent 
language experts. 
2. Programs designed to meet the need for 
Foreign Service officers to acquire and retain 
fluent command of at least one world lan-
guage (French, Spanish, German, Russian, 
Arabic, Chinese) : It has been axiomatic in 
the diplomatic services of all countries (in-
cluding until recently our own) that anyone 
who aspired to enter the career ranks would 
come equipped with command of at least one 
world language. It is disturbing to learn 
from a recent survey that 50 percent of the 
officers in our Foreign Service are not ade-
quately equipped (even by their own self-
appraisal) in any world language. It also 
revealed that language deficiencies are largely 
concentrated in three groups of officers; 
(a) A few senior officers who have allowed 
their language skills to lapse; (b) officers, 
recently integrated under the Wriston pro-
gram, whose previous employment did not 
require foreign language proficiency; and (c) 
new entrants to the bottom ranks of the 
service who, under relaxed standards of 
admission, have been admitted on the under-
RECORD ? SENATE March 
standing that they will make up their lan-
guage deficiency within a stated period. 
It is interesting to contrast briefly the de-
ficiencies in language studies in the United 
States with the extensive programs report-
edly being carried on in the Soviet Union. 
In all South Asian countries where the writ-
ters have served, the number of Soviet diplo-
mats fluent in the local language has been 
impressive. A recent article in the New 
York Times revealed the full scope of the 
Soviet language effort. According to this 
article not only are foreign languages' a 
compulsory part of the curriculum in the 
elementary and secondary schools of the 
U.S.S.R. but a drag-net system of scholar-
ships brings the ablest language students 
into institutes of higher learning such as 
the National Institute of Foreign Languages, 
where they are subjected to a strenuous 5-
year course in which one or more foreign 
languages constitute the core of the curricu-
lum. It is from schools of this kind that 
the Soviet diplomatic service draws many of 
its officers and the results already observ-
able abroad are indeed impressive. 
However, the only forthright solution is 
for the Foreign Service to provide a com-
bination of adequate study facilities coupled 
with a system of sanctions and incentives. 
Taking into account the heavy work-load 
and social duties (also work) of most officers, 
the penalties for failure to acquire minimum 
language skills will have to be considerable 
to arouse the necessary individual effort. 
On the basis of experience both in learning 
and teaching languages, the writers have 
reluctantly concluded that Draconian meas-
ures will be needed to bring all officers in 
the Service up to the required mark. In the 
writers' opinion nothing less than a time 
limit for passing required examinations 
(given on a servicewide basis) coupled with 
loss of promotion eligibility for failure to 
pass, will achieve the desired results. Some 
measures in this direction have already been 
taken by the Department in recent instruc-
tions to the field such as that requiring 
efficiency reports to include specific state-
ments about the officers' efforts to improve 
his language ability. These measures will 
no doubt stimulate the more conscientious, 
but for the Service as a whole stiffer re-
quirements will be needed. 
So much for the stick approach. Any ef-
fective program of personnel management 
must also include the "carrot." In the long 
run, the latter will, of course, produce more 
lasting results. Incentives should therefore 
be devised for rewarding employees who 
achieve fluency in certain languages. The 
Foreign Service Institute should prepare a 
list which would include all the world lan-
guages plus other languages of importance 
to the Foreign Service in which an actual or 
potential sohrtage of fluent speakers exists. 
In the writers' opinion. Arabic and perhaps 
Chinese and Russian, should be considered 
world languages for this purpose?in addi-
tion to French, Spanish and German. No 
special incentive would be offered to For-
eign Service officers for fluency in only one of 
these world languages, since this should be 
considered a basic requirement for employ-
ment. But fluency in any additional lan-
guage on the list should receive special 
recognition. - 
What form should these incentives take? 
Two possibilities are suggested here. No 
doubt others can be devised. A number of 
European countries offer monetary "lan-
guage bonuses" to their diplomatic officers. 
The systems vary from country to country 
but the British method is fairly typical. 
Anyone who feels qualified, applies for an 
examination in the language of his choice. 
The test is both oral and written. Different 
tests are given for varying levels of proficien-
cy, additional cash bonuses being awarded 
for each examination successfully passed. 
The bonus is an increment to yearly salary 
usually averaging about 100 pounds. This is 
a permanent increment and is not lost wit 
promotion to a higher salary bracket. 
Thedepartment might do well- to investi-
gate, if it hasnot already done so, the various - 
incentive programs- of other countries and 
devise a suitable one for our Foreign Service. 
Perhaps a better incentive than money would; 
be to offer "language preference" points to-
wards promotion. This might work as fol-
lows: A separate language dossier could be 
prepared on each officer, listing the lan-
guages on which- he has successfully passed 
examinations and for which he is entitled to 
receive a certain number of promotion points. 
After selection boards have rated all eligible 
candidates on a, competitive basis without 
reference to language ability, the language 
dossiers would be handed to the boards and 
additional points would be awarded to those 
officers entitled to language Credit. Thus, of 
two officers originally rated at the same level, 
the one with superior language qualifications 
would earn preference for promotion. This 
would indeed be. a. powerful incentive and 
stimulus to serious language study. It would 
also spur officers to gain ever higher language 
proficiency since this would progressively en-
hance promotion opportunities throughout 
their entire career. A similar system could 
be worked out for the staff corps. Adminis-
trative details would admittedly present some 
difficulties but if, the need for developing lan-
guage skills is. as great as everyone seems to 
agree it is, the obstacle could be overcome. 
3. The Foreign Service also faces a critical 
shortage of language and area experts, par-
ticularly in the so-called exotic areas which 
have in recent times become increasingly im-
portant to the foreign relations of the United 
States. To improve the quantity and quality 
of language and area training will require 
a greater effort than has thus far been made. 
To be really, effective a language and area 
specialist should acquire a deep understand-
ing of the history, art, religion, social struc-
ture, and economy of the region. He mnst 
also have a. good command of the language. 
Unless he can converse with government 
officials, businessmen, merchants and leaders 
of religious and minority groups, and can at 
least read the local press in the vernacular, 
his specialized training will not pay full 
dividends. Measured by these standards, 
language and area specialization programs, 
in south Asia, at least, have in the past been 
indequate though we understand that greater 
emphasis is now being given to reading espe-
cially during the latter stages of specialist 
training. 
The problems involved in establishing an 
effective corps of language and area special-
ists are many and complex. To surmount 
them will, in the writers' opinion, require 
improved training programs. The following 
minimum considerations are suggested: (a) 
recognition of the special difficulties involved 
in the study of, the so-called exotic languages; 
(b) improvement of initial and follow-
through training programs; (c) improve-
ment of teaching methods; (d) provision of 
special incentives, 
It is a fact that- most of the exotic lan-
guages in which the Foreign Service is de-
ficient are languages which are not easily 
learned by Westerners in general or Amer-
icans in particular. The structure, syntax 
and the cultural concepts embedded in these 
languages are quite unfamiliar to the Amer-
ican student. Often the student is faced 
with a bewildering multiplicity of local lan-
guage variants and dialects. South Asia 
alone, according . to some linguists, offers 
17 major language groups and several hun-
dred variants. To be really effective in this 
area a south Asia language officer should know 
well at least three basic languages: Hindu-
stani (which is really two languages, Urdu 
and Hindi, with- a common spoken vocabu-
lary of perhaps 40 percent, but different roots 
and scripts), Bengali; and at least one south

idian language, probably Tamil (a Dravid-
n language of different ancestry from 
industani and Bengali which are Indo-
European). In addition to these three major 
'anguages, he would also find at least a basic 
"nowledge of Persian essential in Afghani-
tan and important in Pakistan as well as 
1 Muslim areas of India. 
In addition to multiple languages, the 
a'rea specialist is often confronted with dif-
ferent levels of speech within the same 
language. These exist in nearly all lan-
guages but rarely in so exaggerated a form 
as in the exotic ones. Within one language, 
different vocabularies and, forms are often 
matters of rigid social' prescription and wide 
variances are found in classical as against 
contemporary literature with still different 
forms used for official occasions, everyday 
polite speech and colloquial conversation. 
It is difficult to find equivalent examples 
in any Western language unless we hark 
back to Roman times and compare the 
classical Latin of Horace with the contem-
porary Vulgate and the still more common 
idiom of the plebeian masses. The language 
and area specialist must somehow command 
the major languages of his region and sort 
out the various speech levels for the proper 
social occasions and groups. 
Recognition of these special problems 
points the way to the improvements which 
should be made in language and area train-
ing. Perhaps the first and most important 
step is to gain acceptance for the concept 
hat once an officer is selected for language 
and area specialization he becomes part of 
a marked group whose needs and problems 
necessarily differ from those of other officers. 
outine administrative and personnel prac-
tices cannot meet these peculiar require-
ments. Special consideration will have to 
be given to this group with the Foreign 
Service Institute playing a more prominent 
and controlling role in such matters as 
assignments, tours of duty, advanced train-
ing details, etc. 
Until recently, initial training for most 
anguage and area specialists eonsisted of 
year's study at a university. Both area 
nd language studies had to be compressed , 
into this relatively short time. After the 
tudy tour, the specialist was largely on his 
awn. He often had to scramble by his own. 
,fforts for an assignment where his training 
could be put to use/ In some cases lack of 
acancies and shortage of personnel resulted 
n assignments to posts where his newly 
Icquired language was not generally spoken. 
ai many cases what had been learned be-
eme rusty from disuse and ground was lost 
nstead of gained. 
Then again there appeared to be no at-
empt at career planning for the language 
nd area specialist as such. There was, and 
till seems to be, no planned program of 
tssigrunents aimed at safeguarding and de-
'eloping the Government's initial invest-
ent in the specilized training. Assign-
. ents to future posts depended, and still 
io, on the vagaries of existing vacancies, 
osition classifications, coincidence of home-
eave and transfer schedules of officer re-
lacements and all the usual paraphernalia 
,f personnel redtape. Recently there have 
een signs of improvement. The initial 
raining period has been lengthened and is 
sually preceded by intensive language train-
ag at the Foreign Service Institute. Lan-
uage schools, such as the one for Arabic in 
eirut, have been set up in a country where 
he language is spoken to give the student 
ractical experience along with academic 
raining. A number of other improvements 
ave been instituted or are on the way. But 
auch more is needed. 
In the writers' opinion, an adequate train-
g program for a language and area spe-
ialist (particularly for south Asia) would 
ansist of a period of initial training and 
period of followthrough training. The 
itial training would include; 
1. Three months' full-time intensive lan-
guage training at the Foreign Service Insti-
tute. 
2. One full year of academic language and 
area studies at a university. 
3. Eighteen months of travel, residence, 
and study in the area, nine months of which 
could be at a university with a specific re-
search assignment to fulfill. 
4. Assignment to a post in the area where 
the language is widely spoken. 
This initial training period should be fol-
lowed by a 10-year planned program of as-
signments which would constitute the 
followthrough training. This career-plan-
ning phase should be started as soon as the 
officer is selected for training. Before he 
finishes his university assignment both the 
Department and he should know in a rather 
definite way what his assignments for the 
next 10 years will be. The objective of this 
plan would be to insure that this period of 
followup training will develop the language 
and area skill acquired during the initial 
training period. The career planning office 
recently established in the Department could 
make an excellent start by giving priority 
to planning the careers of language and area 
specialists in whom the Government already 
has a very substantial investment which 
should not be dissipated by haphazard as-
signments. To insure that future slots exist 
at the right time and place for language 
and area officers, would it not be possible 
to establish one or more unclassified positions 
at appropriate posts and in the Department? 
This would permit assignments in accord-
ance with career-planning needs rather than 
as dictated by the fortuitous existence of va-
cancies in the right grades at the right 
times. At present it is only rarely and by 
bare chance that the right officer and the 
right vacancy coincide. Only by creating 
extra positions not subject to rigid personnel 
classification can this difficulty be overcome. 
The actual duties of an officer occupying one 
of these positions would depend on his rank 
and special abilities. To establish such po-
sitions will require understanding and co-
operation from the personnel and budget 
offices in the Department and perhaps spe-
cial congressional action, but this or some 
similar plan is an indipensable step. . 
Another problem which requires more 
study than can be given to it in this article is 
the question of language teaching methods. 
This is a murky and somewhat controversial 
field in which one risks drawing down the 
wrath of the linguistic scientists who 'have 
strongly influenced language teaching since 
the last war. Not being linguistic scientists, 
the writers are not qualified to enter into the 
merits of this controversy from a scientific 
viewpoint. Our comments are simply based 
on actual field experience in learning and 
teaching languages and we are interested in 
the practical question: What actually pro-
duces the best results from the standpoint 
of the student? These observations have 
led us to conclude that the new teaching 
techniques have much to commend them 
and are especially effective for students who 
want a quick useful but not necessarily ac-
curate, command of a language. They are 
therefore better suited for general language 
programs than for training language and 
area specialists whose needs are of a different 
order. 
The new systems of language teaching have 
discarded traditional methods in favor of 
shortcut or direct teaching courses in which 
the primary emphasis is on the spoken lan-
guage. These lessons are often written in 
transliterative systems which employs so 
many diacritical marks to represent the 
strange sounds of the exotic language that 
in many cases it is just as easy to learn the 
foreign script as to learn the romanized 
transliteration. 
Language schools for missionaries in South 
Asia with many years of experience in lan-
guage teaching have long ago concluded that 
for students who careers are to be-1n the 
area, it is just as easy and ultimately far 
more fruitful, to teach the local scripts from 
the beginning. Their language tests are 
therefore written in the native alphabets. 
Progress at first may be slower but in the 
long run the ability to read fluently gives 
the student a deeper and broader knowledge 
of the language. This principle is perhaps 
even more applicable to the language and 
area specialist whose language needs are of 
the same long-range nature but even nittre 
demanding than those of the missionary. 
A similar argument can be made for the 
study of grammar. It is sometimes over-
looked that grammar 'itself is a short-cut to 
language. It can be learned empirically or 
inductively from numerous examples, but for 
many adult students it is much quicker to 
learn the rule which is the essence of the 
many instances and then apply it to indi-
vidual cases, rather than the other way 
around. A great deal depends, too, on the 
propensities of each student. It is the 
writers' feeling that these differences in sus-
ceptibility to various teaching methods have 
not been sufficiently recognized. Just as ed-
ucational psychologists now recognize that 
some students are eye-minded and some ear-
minded, experience in teaching languages 
shows that some students learn more readily 
by methods which side-step grammar and 
rely heavily on direct spoken exercises where-
as others can advance further and more 
quickly by learning the basic rules of the 
language and applying them to individual 
speech situations. 
As the reader may have guessed, this is a 
plea that the teaching methods now in gen-
eral use for the training of language and 
area specialists, be carefully reviewed. Not 
all traditional ways of learning a language 
are necessarily bad, any more than all the 
new methods are necessarily good. Perhaps 
the solution lies in a reasonable synthesis 
of the two systems which, after testing in 
the crucible of experience rather than in 
speech laboratories, would incorporate the 
best aspects of both. 
Lastly, the problem of providing adequate 
incentives to language and area specialists 
must be tackled. Judging from appeals 
which have been 'periodically circulated to 
the field, the Department encounters consid-
erable difficulty in attracting sufficient-num-
bers of candidates for language and area 
training. This has been especially true for 
those regions of the world, such as the 
Middle East and south Asia, where needs for 
specialists are growing. The reasons for the 
reluctance of Foreign Service officers to vol-
unteer for this training are clear. To the 
candidate for language and area training, 
many disadvantages and few advantages are 
visible. If he applies for this training he 
must take 1 or 2 years out of his regular' 
career while his colleagues in substantive 
assignments presumably enhance their 
chances for promotion. After his training 
he and his family have to look forward to a 
lifetime of service in a series of hardship 
posts with only occasional relief by assign-
ment to Washington, which to many in the 
Service, is just another hardship post. In 
spite of references in the precepts to selec-
tion boards there has been little in the per-
formances of past boards to indicate that the 
language and area specialist serving in 
Madras, Jidda, or Vientiane is viewed with 
any particular preference for promotion over 
his nonspecialist colleagues in Madrid, 
Buenos Aires, or Sydney. Furthermore, he 
may discover that prolonged service in one 
area will adversely affect his finances. He 
will find that his household appliances, 
- clothing, and car wear out much faster than 
they would in nonhardship areas and that 
cost-of-living allowances will seldom cover 
these added expenses. Not only must he re-
equip himself and his family more frequently 
but he will find this process is more expen-
sive than for his nonspecialist colleague. ?

An illustration will make this clear: Offi-
cer X, an area specialist, and officer Y, a 
nonspecialist, serving at Lahore are trans-
ferred. Following normal Foreign Service 
practice they order from the United States 
a car and other items needed to equip 
themselves at their next post. As an area 
specialist, X is transferred within his area 
to Bombay. As a nonarea specialist, Y is 
available for worldwide assignment and is 
transferred, let us say, to Rome. X at once 
finds that he must buy many, items for 
Bombay which Y does not need to purchase 
for Rome. But even worse, in accordance 
with Foreign Service Regulations, X must 
pay the difference between what it would 
have cost to ship his purchases Lahore-Bom-
bay and the actual shipping cost New York-
Bombay. 
All these considerations add up to rather 
powerful deterrents, even for those whose 
natural interests attract them to these un-
comfortable areas of the world. The lan-
guage and area specialist thus finds himself 
a member of a select group but one that 
is singled out for penalty more often than 
for privilege. This, of course, has its psy-
chological advantages in creating a certain 
?n and esprit de corps among the spe-
cialist group. The Marine Corps and the 
Foreign Legion have found it advantageous 
to elevate this masochism (latent to some 
extent in all men) to heights of heroism. 
But although this may have some appeal to 
the language and area candidate, the task 
of building a solid and effective corps of 
specialists will require powerful and pos-
itive incentives. 
These incentives should be both psycho-
logical and material. The former category 
could include some of the reforms suggested 
in this article such as effective initial train-
ing and a planned follow through series of 
assignments. The language and area officer 
should be given the feeling, supported by 
tangible evidence, that he belongs to a spe-
cially selected group over which the Depart-
ment, and particularly the F.S.I? maintain a 
vigilant eye. 
In the category of material incentives, the 
logical first step should be to remove or 
minimize some of the obvious ineauities 
which now accompany the mere fact of being 
a language and area specialist. In addition 
to correcting obviously discriminatory pro-
cedures, positive incentive, either in the 
form of pay increments or through some sys-
tem of promotion preference similar to that 
suggested for general language programs in 
the first part of this article, should be in-
stituted. In this case too, separate dossiers 
could be prepared on language and area spe-
cialists which would be handed to selection 
boards only after all eligible officers have been 
rated, so that as between two officers of 
equal ability, the language and area spe-
cialist would receive promotion preference. 
Incidentally, a specialist officer who was ex-
traordinarily gifted in language might thus 
earn a double promotion credit, one for his 
language and area specialization and one 
along with other officers who had success-
fully passed examinations in language listed 
for promotion credit. The languages of his 
area of specialty would, of course, not earn 
him credit in the general language incentive 
program. 
To sum up, the problem which faces the 
Foreign Service in its attempt to untie the 
tongues of its employees is a complex and 
difficult one. Different types of programs 
will be needed for the different groups that 
have to be reached: one for employees in-
terested only in acquiring a useful knowl-
edge of the local language; another for all 
officers who need to have a command of at 
least one world language; and again another 
for the particular needs of language and 
area specialists. The key to the solution of 
these problems lies in the formulation and 
institution of adequate training programs 
? and of incentive systems tailored to the re-
sults which the Department hopes to 
achieve.

February 1959]' 
FOREGN LANGUAGE: CHINK IN AMERICA'S 
ARMOR? 
(By Jacob Ornstein) 
"The United States is probably weaker in 
foreign language abilities than any major 
country in the world," declared Marion Fol-
som, former Secretary of Health, Education, 
and Welfare, before a Senate committee in 
January 1958.' He added, "If we are to gain 
and hold the confidence and good will of 
peoples around the world, we must be able 
to talk to them not in our language but in 
theirs." In recent months a growing number 
of statements of this kind by public leaders 
has caused thinking Americans to become 
more than a little concerned about the 
shocking state of our foreign language prep-
aration. 
In the pre-sputnik days warnings about 
the poor state of our linguistic preparedness 
were greeted by yawns, or at best, mild in-
terest. The Soviet satellites circling about 
the earth brought us face to face with 
some very disquieting facts. One of the 
most upsetting of these has been the news 
that of the 1,400 or so Soviet technical 
journals received by our libraries, less than 
50 have until now been regularly translated. 
Does it matter? In 1951 an article on 
contact relay networks appeared in the 
Journal Of the U.S.S.R. Academy of Sciences. 
So few of 'our scientists, read Russian that 
it was not noticed until 1955. In the opin-
ion of Dr. William Locke of the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology, this oversight 
cost us at least $200,000 in duplicated re-
search, not to mention the time-lag. 
A survey by the author published last 
year by the State Department's External Re-
search Staff _revealed that of our 1,800 or so 
colleges less than 180 were teaching Rus-
sian?to about 5,000 students. By contrast, 
in the U.S.S.R. an estimated 10 million Rus-
sians of all ages are busy mastering English. 
World War II left the United States in a 
position of leadership for which we were 
ill-prepared linguistically. Decades of neg-
lect had brought language training to its 
lowest level in our history. When Hitler in-
vaded Poland in 1939 about 20 colleges were 
teaching Russian, while an insignificant 
number offered the languages of Poland, 
Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and other stra-
tegic areas. The Armed Forces and the Gov-
ernment scrambled to set up emergency 
teaching programs where weary-eyed GI's 
raced against time to get a smattering of 
Japanese, Norwegian, Bulgarian, and some 
40 other tongues urgently needed to conduct 
the war on Our farfiung battlefronts. 
. The postwar period brought an aggrava-
tion of the language problem. The tasks of 
occupation and of dealing with new states 
created an unprecedented demand for lin-
guistic know-how. Since the end of the war 
at least 15 sovereign states have been born, 
many employing languages not offered by 
any American school. India alone has at 
least 100 dialects and 14 official tongues. Of 
these, Hindi, spoken by about 150 million 
persons, is taught by a mere half dozen 
American universities. 
Those whose stock answer to this problem 
is "Let 'em learn English" are simply blind 
to the international facts of life. The dan-
gers of linguistic ignorance are dramatically 
shown by a story which has become well-
known in Foreign Service circles. When the 
American Embassy was set up in a certain 
new Far Eastern State, we had not a single 
officer with competence in the language and 
had to hire local interpreters. Wishing to 
please their employers, they translated ev-
erything to sound very flattering to the 
United States. 
When we were able to train and send ou 
our own linguists, we were horrified to fin 
that anti-American sentiment was raging 
fiercely in that country. 
Secretary of State Dulles, in requesting ad-
ditional funds for language training at the 
85th Congress last year, pointecl'out that less 
than half of our Foreign Service officers had 
a practical sepaking and reading knowledge 
of French, German, or Spanish, while barely: 
25 percent of the incoming trainees had a 
working knowledge of these tongues. For 
this reason, he observed, the State Depart-
ment had been obliged to relax severely its 
language requirement in recruiting new offi-
cers. Perhaps the mos/ telling commentary 
on these figures has been provided by Secre-
tary Dulles himself when he asserted that 
"the effectiveness of our efforts to create a 
stable pattern of international relations 
hinges to an important degree on the estab-
lishment of understanding between peoples. 
Language can both aid and obstruct this 
vital understanding." 
While American high school students have 
been enrolled in driver education, basket-
weaving, and telephone techniques, the So-
viets have left no stone unturned to provide 
their citizens with the ordnance of foreign 
language. Writing in the New York Times, 
Mr. Theodore Shabad a few months ago de-
scribed the ambitious network of schools 
being established throughout the Soviet Un-
ion where at the tender age of 8 bright 
youngsters are launched on all-out programs 
of language mastery. In Moscow there are 
three schools where youngsters are getting 
their three R's exclusively in French, Ger-
man, or English. In Leningrad two elemen-
tary boarding schools put the children 
through their paces in Chinese and Hindi. 
Special schools have been established in the 
Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan to introduce 
youngsters to Chinese, Hindi, Arabic, and 
other languages. 
In vivid contrast to the intense Soviet lan-
guage drive, the linguistic picture in the 
United States is a depressing one. Accord-
ing to Modern Language Association figures, 
of the 24 major languages of the world, each 
spoken by more than 20 million persons, 
only Spanish and French are studied by an 
appreciable number of Americans. It is 
hardly any wonder, therefore, that of our 
representatives abroad perhaps 1 out of 40 
can speak effectively any language but 
English. , 
That this problem reared its ugly head as 
early as the Colonial Period is revealed by 
John Adams in a letter addressed to the 
Treasury Board. In it he commented: 
"I found myself in France ill-versed in the 
language, the laws, customs, and manners of 
the country, and had the mortification to 
find my colleagues little better informed 
than myself, vain as this may seem." 
Referring to Benjamin Franklin, he noted 
that the latter "spoke the language imper-
fectly and was able to write bad French." 
However, the language needs of. those earl 
diplomats appear trifling compared with 
those of today. At a conference in linguis 
tic needs in government, held by the U.S 
Office of Education in March, 1957, it was 
learned that a total of 106 foreign tongues 
are required for our government agencies 
and armed services. As our schools hay-
simply not been producing enough qualifie 
linguists, the services and many governmen 
agencies have been obliged to create special 
schools. At the Army Language School, for 
example, intensive training, lasting from 6 
to 15 months, is provided in 29 languages 
ranging from French to Vietnamese. 
Despite the acute need for Americans whc 
can speak languages, few students enrolled 
in college language courses go far enoug 
in their study to be able to carry on a simpl 
conversattion or read a newspaper editorial: 
worse yet, too few colleges provide course 
which give insight into the background o

areas other than Western Europe. The Con-
ference on Asian Affairs recently reported 
that fully forty percent of our colleges have, 
no courses on the Far East where over half 
the world's population resides. 
Condemning the short-sightedness of 
many of our universities, Dr. Grayson Kirk, 
president of Columbia University, last year 
stated, "We must make an effort to know 
more of the life and thought of the great 
Asian leaders who have had such profound 
influence on the lives of hundreds of millions 
of men and women. It will be a long time," 
he added, "before Asoka and Akbar and the 
Gupta Kings are commonplace terms along 
with Julius Caesar, Henry IV of France, and 
the Tudor Kings of England." 
The Modern Language Association of 
America, in a four-year study supported by 
the Rockefeller Foundation, has revealed 
facts and figures on language in our schools 
which give little reason for complacency. 
Surveying 971 American colleges and univer-
sities, the Association found that more than 
half of these schools offer no language other 
than French, Spanish, or German. It con-
cluded that three-quarters of the world's 
population speaks languages not taught in 
American universities. 
While the Soviets are busy courting the 
uncommitted neutrals through a never-
ending series of cultural, scientific missions, 
dance groups and sports teams?all well 
supplied with linguists?we have the doubt-
ful distinction of sending more tonguetied 
persons abroad than any other modern 
country. Unhappily, this is not limited to 
the average citizen who invests in a summer 
cruise, but applies to our intellectual and 
school leaders as well. Commenting on this, 
the distinguished teacher and writer, Henri 
Peyre, of Yale University, has written: 
"Americans have taken refuge in the easy 
but paralyzing prejudice?totally groundless, 
in fact?that they are not gifted for lan-
guages. * * They have been afflicted by 
shyness when confronted by the need to 
master another tongue and have cultivated 
inhibitions which a little courage would 
soon dispel. American scientists, scholars, 
and diplomats have thus done incalculable 
damage to the prestige of their country 
abroad, through their placid assumption 
that everyone should understand English." 
Is there any way out of the language 
muddle? Indeed, the situation has become 
so critical that Government leaders have 
decided to take action. Public Law 85-864, 
passed by the 85th Congress, authorizes $887 
million for a 4-year program of development 
in science, mathematics, and languages. 
The plan proposes some daring innova-
tions. It calls for a system of language 
institutes to be established at colleges for 
the purpose of providing language teachers 
and supervisors with training intended to 
improve the quality and effectiveness of in-
struction. In addition, the proposal pro-
vides for the development of foreign-lan-
guage training and service centers at selected 
institutions to furnish instruction in rare 
but strategic tongues rarely or never taught 
in the United States. 
This is certainly a step in the right direc-
tion. However, despite the merit of such a 
plan, it is still an emergency measure which 
does not attack the problem at the very core. 
The solution to our linguistic dilemma can 
come only through a thorough overhauling 
of our language teaching system. 
First of all, it is necessary to streamline 
our teaching methods. Most of the Nation's 
25,000 language instructors are capable and 
devoted individuals. Unfortunately, there 
are still a considerable number who teach 
a language by the well-known expedient of 
keeping one page ahead of the class. Else-
where, well qualified teachers find themselves 
hamstrung by a rigid program of study 
stressing grammatical analysis and transla-
No. 36-10 
tion of literary classics. This has resulted 
in drab, uninteresting instruction which has 
caused many generations of Americans tti 
abhor language study, recalled by them as a 
tortured exercise in the memorization of ir-
regular verbs and adjectives. 
Part and parcel of the improvement of 
teaching methods is the need for increased 
use of audiovisual aids and laboratories. 
Although no panacea for language problems, 
the use of magnetic tape recorders and other 
equipment in soundproof laboratories has 
proved to be a boon to the teaching of for-
eign languages, especially for the speaking 
and understanding phases. 
A sweeping change must be made with re-
gard to the age at which young Americans 
are introduced to foreign languages. In no 
Other civilized country is the mistake made 
of presenting a second language to the indi-
vidual so late in his school career. The 
findings of physiological, psychological, and 
linguistic researchers indicate clearly that 
by the age of 5 a child has mastered his own 
tongue and ? is ready to learn one or several 
foreign tongues. 
Fortunately, America is witnessing the de-
velopment of a vigorous trend?the move-
ment to introduce foreign languages in the 
elementary schools, known as FLES by edu-
cators. Sparked by Earl J. McGrath while he 
was U.S. Commissioner of Education in 1952, 
the movement has had a meteoric career. In 
5 years, the number of grade-school young-
sters has risen from insignificant numbers to 
some 300,000 junior linguists enrolled in 
French, Spanish, German, Italian, and other 
languages. Even so, at the present time, less ? 
than one youngster out of a hundred can 
get started in a foreign language at a time 
when he can learn it perfectly and effort-
lessly. 
In the modern program of language in-
struction which America so badly needs to-
day, the youngster would begin the study of a 
foreign language by the third grade and con-
tinue it through high school and into col-
lege, until he has a good speaking, writing, 
and reading knowledge. Let it be remem-
bered that a Soviet youngster who wishes to 
attend college must present at least 6 years 
of a modern language and that he `must 
usually continue it there for several years 
more. 
In addition to increasing the number of 
years that a foreign language is studied, it is 
essential that we expand greatly the range of 
languages taught in our schools. Most high 
schools and colleges are still offering the 
same languages which they taught 30 years 
ago. There is an urgent need to introduce 
important world languages like Russian, 
Polish, Czech, Chinese, Japanese, Indonesian, 
Arabic, Swahili, and others. 
Moreover, the language profession needs to 
be made much more attractive. Dr. H. B. 
Wells, president of Indiana University, has 
called attention to the declining number of 
students going into thelinguistic field. 
"Last year," he noted in 1957, "of the entire 
graduating class a mere 1.6 percent was spe-
cializing in languages, a mere drop in the 
bucket compared to our needs." It is, how-
ever, little wonder that present day youth is 
giving this field a cold shoulder, when incen-
tives are so poor. The training of a language 
teacher or translator requires from 7 to 10 
years. Consequently, many youngsters pre-
fer to go into fields where the training is less 
rigorous and rewards are greater. 
In the final analysis, there can be no last-
ing solution to the language problem until 
the general public is made aware of the 
linguistic problem and demands from its 
schools the type of language training suited 
for a jet-propelled world where borders are 
constantly shrinking. 
A start has been made in acquainting 
Americans at the grass roots with language 
problems. The U.S. Commission for UNESCO, 
2995 
in cooperation with the Modern Language 
Association, has, during the past few years 
held several hundred "citizen consultation" 
meetings intended to acquaint laymen and 
leaders in typical American communities 
with the facts and figures on our language 
snarl. Electrified into action, many indivi-
duals and civic groups have acted through 
their school boards and administrators to 
improve language facilities at the local level. 
Americans are beginning to wake up to our 
dangerous language lag?a weak chink in the 
Nation's armor. As a leader in the free 
world, the United States cannot afford to 
continue to be tonguetied in the world arena. 
Language?the verbal stuff of international 
communication?deserves a new deal in the 
American classroom.

FOREIGN .SERVICE WOES: A COMMENT ON IN-
ABILITY OF U.S. ENVOYS To TALK LANGUAGE 
OF NATIONS THEY'RE IN 
(By James Reston) 
WASHINGTON, March 18.?Sometimes a 
small incident tells more about the problems 
of U.S. foreign policy than a month's debate 
in the Senate. President Eisenhower's 
luncheon yesterday with the Advisory Com-
mittee of the Foreign Service Institute is a 
case in point. The purpose of the meeting 
was to discuss the sad state of language 
training in the Foreign Service, which is pri-
marily responsible for the administration of 
U.S. foreign policy at home and overseas. 
Actually, what it turned out to be was a 
briefing session, primarily by men outside 
the Government, for the President on just 
how poorly trained in languages his staff is. 
The facts are as follows: 
Fifty percent of the entire Foreign Service 
officer corps do not have a speaking knowl-
edge of any foreign language. 
Seventy percent of the new men coming 
into the Foreign Service are in the same 
state. 
Llewellyn E. Thompson, U.S. Ambassador 
in Moscow, is the only U.S. Ambassador in a 
Communist country who speaks the lan-
guage of the country to which he is assigned. 
In the nine Arabic-speaking countries, 
the only U.S. Ambassadors who speak Arabic 
are Raymond Hare in Egypt and Parker T. 
Hart in Jordan. 
In the non-English-speaking countries of 
the North Atlantic Treaty nations, the U.S. 
Ambassadors do not have a workable knowl-
edge of the language in Belgium, France, 
Germany, Iceland, the Netherlands, Portugal, 
Turkey, and Greece. 
Vinton Chapin, the Ambassador in Luxem-
bourg, is fluent in French; Val Peterson, in 
Copenhagen, claims a fair knowledge of 
Danish; Frances E. Willis, in Oslo, says she 
can speak fair Norwegian, and James D. 
Zellerbach, in Rome, says merely that he is 
studying Italian.' 
The same state of affairs, or worse, exists 
in the U.S. embassies of Asia, and naturally 
enough, the President was not only 
interested but 'enthusiastic about doing 
something about it. 
Those at the White House luncheon were 
Gen. Alfred M. Gruenther, of the Red Cross; 
Robert Calkins, of the Brookings Institu-
tion; Hamilton Fish Armstrong, editor of 
Foreign Affairs; Dr. Clyde K. Kluckhohn of 
the Peabody Museum; Charles E. Saltzman, 
former Assistant Secretary of State; and 
Henry M. Wriston, former president of 
Brown University. 
Also, for the administration, Under Sec-
retary of State Christian A. Herter; Deputy 
Under Secretary of State Loy Henderson; 
Gen. Robert Cutler, an assistant to the 
President; Harold B. Hoskins, director of 
the Foreign Service Institute; and the newly 
appointed Director of the Bureau of the 
Budget, Maurice H. Stans.

2996 CONGRESSIONAL RECORD ? SENATE 
It is the function of the Foreign Service 
Institute to provide language training for 
Foreign Service officers, but its funds have 
repeatedly been cut, with little or no effort 
by the President to do anything about it. 
Though he is responsible for the appoint. 
rnent of ambassadors, and though the For-
eign Service officers who head our embassies 
overseas are his personal representatives, the 
President's attitude was reported to be: 
''Why didn't somebody tell me about this?" 
He was sincerely disturbed, and even an-
gry, about the difficulty in getting adequate 
funds to provide the necessary language 
training; He observed that a former secre-
tary of his was recently given a 4-year 
training course at a university on Air Force 
funds, and he wondered why it was not pos-
sible to get even a few months' training 
for the men who were involved in one of 
the most lively periods of diplomatic ac-
tivity in recent years. 
REPRESENTATIVE ROONEY INVOLVED 
His visitors told him in plain and simple 
terms. The reason, as almost everybody fa-
miliar with the State Department's prob-
lems knows, is Representative JOHN J. 
ROONEY, Democrat, of the 14th District of 
New York (Kings County). 
Mr. ROONEY is chairman of the House Ap-
propriations subcommittee that presides 
over the State Department budget. He has 
been slashing that budget for years, is less 
than enthusiastie about giving ambassadors 
the necessary language training or repre-
sentation allowances, and is generally re-
garded, despite his obscurity, as one of the 
most powerful men in America, in a nega-
tive way, so far as U.S. foreign policy is con-
cerned. 
The President was interested in Mr. 
ROONEY and offered to do something about 
talking to him. He could not have been 
more sympathetic to the problems placed be-
fore him and his visitors came away con-
vinced that they had had a most useful 
luncheon. 
But at least some of them wondered why 
the language and training problem had not 
been discussed and dealt with at the highest 
level of the Government more than 5 years 
ago, or at least in 1956, when the embassies 
were filled with presidential appointees who 
could not speak the language of the coun-
tries to which they were assigned. 
[From the Christian Science Monitor, 
July 5, 19591 
WHERE AMERICA IS LAST 
Recently when some Americans were visit-
ing a school in Moscow a Russian girl of 
high school age arose and addressed the 
visitors in English. 
It was rather broken English, but it was 
intelligible. And one of the American 
visitors, Jenkins Lloyd Jones of the Tulsa 
Tribune, confessed to sadness that there 
was not a public school in the United States 
where a single pupil could welcome Russian 
visitors in the Russian language. 
While English is taught in most of the 
leading schools of Russia the Russian lan-
guage is taught in few public schools in the 
United States. 
A few weeks ago a convoy of three Russian 
airplanes landed at the capital city of one 
of the countries of the southwestern Pacific. 
Every one of the 125 visiting Russians was 
able to speak the native language. They 
had been trained in that language before 
they undertook their mission. But in the 
American Embassy in that island capital 
there was only one employee who could 
speak the native language, and he was a 
native of the island, an interpreter em-
ployed by the United States. 
It is unusual for an American Ambassador 
to be able to speak the language of the 
country to which he is assigned. This ig-
norance of foreign languages has its 
handicaps. To begin with it is a positive 
embarrassment, because an ability to speak 
many languages is considered\ the hallmark 
of an educated person in most of the world's 
capitals. 
Hence no matter how skilled the Ameri-
can representative may be in the language 
of his own country he is written down as 
ignorant when he shows his inability to 
speak another tongue. 
It has been argued for years that no one 
should be sent abroad to represent the 
United States officially unless he is able to 
speak the language of the country to which 
he is assigned. But nothing important has 
ever resulted from the argument. Primarily 
the United States is simply unable to find 
competent diplomats who are acquainted - 
with foreign languages. go we continue to 
send into the capitals and cultural centers 
of the world men who are unable to 
understand one word of the language they 
hear in councils or on the streets. 
Nothing corrective is likely to be done 
about this for a long time. You can imag-
ine what would happen to the American 
lawmaker who launched a movement to re-
quire the teaching of the Russian language 
in all American schools. Yet Russian 
speech is gradually becoming the court 
language of half the world (Daily Okla. 
homan.) 
IMPORTANCE OF THE RAILROAD 
INDUSTRY 
Mr. JOHNSTON of South Carolina. 
Mr. president, sometimes we are prone 
to forget and to neglect a word of tribute 
or praise to an industry?and to the men 
who are engaged in it?which plays so 
important a role in the lives of every one 
of us and which is so essentially a funda-
mental part of our progress and develop-
ment as a Nation. We are fortunate in 
the great and diversified types of our 
American industry. Our past develop-
ment has been possible because of the 
progress these industries have made 
through their growth and expansion. 
We owe them much for that. 
Our future progress may well depend 
upon the preservation and continued 
healthy existence of these vital indus-
tries. Too many of our citizens have 
their private funds invested in them for 
that investment to be neglected. Too 
many workers depend upon their con-
tinued employment in all our industries 
for us to allow any one to be the object 
of discriminatory practices or policies. 
In my opinion, one of the most vital 
of our industries today is our railroads. 
To neglect this segment of our economic 
system would indeed have dire and far-
reaching consequencies. Thousands of 
workers depend upon our great railway 
system for their employment?track-
workers, repairmen, engineers, brake-
men, conductors, station agents, office 
workers, and executives. So we must 
not overlook any of them when such a 
vital industry requires our thoughtful 
consideration for its future well-being. 
I have prepared a brief statement rel-
ative to this great industry, and I desire 
to have my statement incorporated in 
the RECORD. Later, I shall expand my 
remarks, for this vital and ingenious 
American enterprise deserves our most 
careful consideration. 
TRIBUTE TO A VITAL INDUSTRY 
For the past few years, I have become 
increasingly concerned about the physi-
Mccrch 5 
cal and financial condition of our great 
American railroad industry. I followed 
with much interest the hearings which 
were held last winter under the able 
leadership of our colleague, the Senator 
from Florida [Mr. SMATHERS1. I was 
much encouraged, of course, when the 
Congress, in August, enacted the Trans-
portation Act of 1958, and removed the 
onerous 3 percent excise tax on freight 
shipments. 
These two pieces of legislation were, of 
course, very helpful, and, in my opinion, 
constituted a good beginning. We must, 
however, continue to look for a complete 
solution to the still present problems of 
discriminatory regulation, subsidization, 
and excessive taxation?all of which still 
plague this great industry. The ulti-
mate solution of these problems can be 
accomplished only when the Congress 
acts to take into account the railroads' 
essentiality and importance to the econ-
omy of this country. 
More than $35. billion of private capi-
tal has been invested in an immense rail-
road plant of shops, signals, communica-
tions, and rolling stock. More than 2 
million freight and passenger cars weave 
in and out across the 220,000-mile net-
work of rails, and carry almost half of the 
Nation's intercity freight traffic and 
nearly one-third of its commercial pas-
senger load. 
The accomplishments of the railroads 
are staggering. In just a 60-minute 
period, more than 1,000 freight and pas-
senger trains start on scheduled runs all 
over the Nation, and the same number 
pull into terminals. More than 31/2 mil-
lion tons of goods will move some 20 
miles during the same hour. On the 
passenger side, trains will perform trans-
portation equivalent to carrying 3 mil-
lion people 1 Mile. Yet, even in the light 
of these facts, some persons think that 
the railroads are dying. 
Let me say a word about the human 
side of railroading. At the end of 1956, 
more than 1 million persons were reg-
ularly employed in our railroad indus-
try. Today, because of the problems 
which are still hanging around the necks 
of the railroads, and because of the 
recession, railroad employment has 
dropped to about 825,000 people, who 
receive about $5 billion a year in wages, 
Another half-million people work for 
companies which are directly dependent 
upon the $3 billion the railroad industry 
spends in an average year for materials, 
supplies, new plants, and equipment. 
Still more people?a million, in fact?
have invested, their savings in railroad 
stocks and bonds. 
What about the financial support the 
railroads give to local and State govern-
ments and to the Federal Government? 
More than $1 billion is paid by the in-
dustry in a normal year in the form of 
taxes which help the States build and 
maintain our schools and other impor-
tant projects. All of this makes Amer-
ica a better place in which to live. Some 
of the railroads' tax money even finds its 
way into the construction of highways, 
waterways, airways, and airports. This 
is a remarkable benefit to competing 
carriers. 
So this is a vital industry which 
reaches into Hometown, U.S.A. Hun-
