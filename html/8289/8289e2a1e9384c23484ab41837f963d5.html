 Since the National People's Congress last Jan-
 uary there have been several indications that Peking
 is conducting its affairs in almost normal fashion--
 i.e., similar to the way business was done prior to
 the Cultural Revolution.   Normality is a newsworthy
 item in China because abnormality has generally been
 the norm since.the mid-1960s.   The newly constituted
 government, ratified at the congress, seems to be
 the most important factor in the change in operating
 style.
 The first sign that things were returning to
 normal was a notice issued in early March by the
 State Council--China's cabinet--thanking those for-
 eign governments that had sent messages of concern
 regarding a major earthquake that hit the northeast
 province of Liaoning in February.   Foreign governments
 have sent such messages before, but if the State Coun-
 cil issued replies, they did so in secret.
 In mid-March, the standing committee of the Na-
 tional People's Congress, which meets when the full
 congress is not in session, held a meeting that ap-
 proved a proposal to grant amnesty to all remaining
 Nationalist "war criminals" still in custody.   The
 meeting also heard a report on the economic situation
 by chief economic planner Yu Chui-li and received a
 briefing on the earthquake relief program in Liaoning.
 In addition, the session approved several ambassadorial
 appointments, many of which were actually made last
 year.   In typically "abnormal" fashion, however, no
 details were released on any of these subjects except
 the amnesty decision.
 Peking announced on March 20   that preparatory
 meetings have been held to plan for the national con-
 gresses of China's major mass organizations--the Com-
 munist Youth League, the women's federation, and the

 trade unions.   The mass organizations were destroyed
 during the Cultural Revolution, but provincial-
 level units for the Youth League and the trade unions
 were established in every province by 1973.   The only
 step needed to complete the rebuilding process for
 these two groups was to re-establish the organiza-
 tions at the national level, but the political uncer-
 tainties of last year's anti-Confucius campaign prob-
 ably forced postponement of national congresses,  if
 indeed they were being planned.   As for the women's
 federation, provincial-level groups have been estab-
 lished in all but one province.                                Peking's announce-
 ment did not indicate when the three congresses would
 be held, noting only that they would be convened
 "after due preparation."
 The announcement made no mention of the peasants'
 association, another mass organization that is being
 rebuilt at a much slower pace.   Few provinces have
 established peasants' associations at the provincial
 level.   Before the Cultural Revolution, there was no
 national peasants'  association, and it is not clear
 whether Peking plans to establish one.   (UNCLASSIFIED)

 Factionalism in the Militia
 The campaign to improve social order by
 building up the urban militia has been successful
 in many areas, but recent reports indicate that
 the campaign has had the opposite effect in Chekiang
 and Yunnan provinces. Factional conflict, dating
 from the Cultural Revolution, has continued within
 the rebuilt militia units.
 Militia involvement in factional strife is an
 example of China's vexing problem of trying to
 balance so-called democratic rights.--such as the
 right to strike,  to put up posters,  and to criticize--
 with the need for order and unity. Since the Cultural
 Revolution,  the pendulum has too often swung in favor
 of "democracy" at the expense of production,  social
 order, and the implementation of central policies.
 Continued factionalism--politically and personally
 motivated--has necessitated the involvement of central
 leaders and the continued intervention of troops. It
 has also tended to undermine the authority if not the
 will of provincial leaders.
 the struggle
 for control over the urban militia intensified in
 several areas of Chekiang in mid-November. Violent
 clashes occurred frequently, and a number of people
 were killed. Warring factions reportedly stole
 weapons from the PLA,  and the limited stock of
 militia weapons may have been used.
 The situation was so serious that the central
 authorities summoned leaders from both provinces
 to Peking around the end of the year. Party
 vice chairman Wang Hung-wen reportedly emphasized
 to the provincial leaders that the role of the
 militia was to support the local party authorities
 and to maintain order. Factionalism was condemned.

 Wang was said to have underscored a recent order
 by Chairman Mao that in places with serious factional
 disputes, militia units should not be organized in
 a "hasty" manner. The militia headquarters in
 Hangchow, capital of Chekiang, and units in other
 cities in the province apparently fell into this
 category, because orders were issued by -Peking
 leaders to disband them. These instructions are also
 said to have been passed throughout the country as
 part of central directives two and eight.
 The party first secretary of Chekiang, Tan
 Chi-lung, was reportedly reluctant to carry out
 the orders. He may not have wanted to remove some
 militia leaders loyal to him, but he must also have
 been mindful that the decision could anger one of
 the factions. Tan had already been dragged out of
 a guesthouse by one group last month and taken to a
 struggle meeting--an experience he did not wish to
 repeat. Tan finally dissolved the militia headquarters
 however, after a telegram from Peking demanded action.
 still,                                         peace was not
 restored in Chekiang until  eng Hsiao-ping sent a di-
 vision of troops from the Peking Garrison in late Feb-
 ruary and made a personal visit in early March.   Teng
 is also said to have gone to Yunnan in early February
 for the same purpose.
 There is no guarantee that peace will be main-
 tained.  The militia in Wenchow, a coastal city in
 Chekiang, was praised by the provincial radio last
 May for preventing disturbances, but
 indicate that factional activity resume     is year.
 Problems with the militia in Chekiang and Yunnan
 demonstrate that institutions such as the militia
 cannot in themselves create unity. Continued faction-
 alism tends to frustrate the achievement of high-
 priority goals such as getting the military out of
 politics.   For example, recent broadcasts have called

 on the regular forces to work closely with the militia.
 The trend in domestic propaganda last year was to em-
 phasize that the urban militia was distinct from the
 regular PLA forces and operated under the direct com-
 mand of civilian municipal authorities. Most reported
 militia leaders have been civilians. The new first
 deputy commander of the Canton Militia Command, formed
 in mid-December, however,  is the Canton Garrison
 commander. Canton has been plagued by the economic
 demands of demobilized soldiers, and civilian munici-
 pal authorities apparently have turned to the garrison
 for help.
 The reported involvement of Teng Hsiao-ping,
 who has a well-earned reputation as a disciplinarian,
 may explain this adjustment in the expressed role
 of the PLA. Teng was recently named chief of staff
 and may have decided to increase the use of troops
 to restore order. Previous reports indicated that
 Wang Hung-wen had attempted to resolve factional
 rivalry in several provinces, including Chekiang and
 Yunnan, but his success obviously has been limited.
 Indeed, the persistent lack of unity doubtless
 helped to create the need to rehabilitate veterans
 such as Teng and to use the campaign to strengthen
 the proletarian dictatorship as a vehicle for en-
 hancing central control and improving social order.
 Nevertheless, the fact that "democratic" rights are
 written into the constitution, have been closely
 associated with Chairman Mao,  and are used as a
 political weapon by a variety of groups, will make
 a concerted crackdown on factionalism very difficult.

 Balance of Payments - The Ink is Red
 A record trade deficit in 1974 pushed China's
 balance of payments with the non-communist countries
 into the red for the first time since 1970.   Despite
 a sharp increase in the use of credits and other
 short-term borrowing, Peking was forced to draw down
 its reserves of gold and foreign currency by more
 than $350 million.
 The value of China's imports from the non-com-
 munist world increased by about 45 percent in 1974,
 while exports rose by only 20 percent, generating
 a trade deficit of almost $900 million  (see table).
 Foreign currency outlays for transportation services
 were more than $400 million.   In addition, China
 made $200 million worth of downpayments and payments
 for services under its whole plant import program
 and spent $70 million for aid to less developed
 countries.
 On the plus side, overseas remittances and bor-
 rowing from Chinese-controlled banks in Hong Kong
 brought in $375 million.   Peking received short- and
 medium-term credits worth $1.2 billion in 1974 for
 imports of grain and whole plant equipment.   Repay-
 ments of grain credits during the year, however,
 totaled $800 million.   Time deposits from Western
 banks and other financing, such as the clearing ac-
 count balance with Japan, provided perhaps $500 million.
 The crunch came in the second half of 1974 as the
 bulk of the repayments for short-term credits fell due
 and the growing world recession cut demand for China's
 exports.   Forced to sell gold to meet foreign exchange
 needs, the Chinese began taking additional measures to
 ease the foreign exchange shortage.   Contracts for
 grain and cotton were canceled, short-term credits were

 in Hong Kong to attract increased deposits.
 I)espite these problems, there is no crisis in
 China's balance of payments, and the situation should
 improve sharply this year.  Reserves are adequate,
 and Peking's credit rating is still excellent.   The
 import bill has been trimmed, and increased oil ex-
 ports will at least compensate for the decline in
 other exports.   Moreover, repayments on grain credits
 will be less than last year's.  More whole plant
 equipment will be imported under medium-term credits,
 but repayment of these credits will not begin until
 1976.   Peking may also slow its purchase of new plants,
 reducing   outlays for downpayrients.   (SECRET NO FOR-

 Soliciting Singapore
 Peking made it clear to Singapore Foreign
 Minister Rajaratnam during his stay in China in
 mid-March that the Chinese considered the visit
 an important step toward improving relations and
 that Peking saw no obstacles to the early estab-
 lishment of diplomatic relations.
 The Chinese apparently listened politely to
 Rajaratnam's explanations of Singapore's reluctance
 to establish diplomatic links now. Rajaratnam told
 the Chinese this was, at least in part, a result of
 "certain local impediments"--a formulation used for
 Singapore's sensitivities about the political loy-
 alties of its large ethnic Chinese population.
 In a statement to the press, Rajaratnam said
 that the Chinese, although anxious to establish
 diplomatic ties  "as soon as possible," now under-
 stand Singapore's position and are prepared to wait
 for "Singapore's convenience." Both Premier Chou En-
 lai and Foreign Minister Chiao Kuan-hua, however,
 attempted to play down Singapore's fears by assuring
 Rajaratnam that Peking had no designs on Singapore's
 ethnic Chinese population.
 a]ara nam claimed--that the real obstacle for
 ingapore was Indonesia's concern about the presence
 of a
 Chinese
 mission in Singapore, which Jakarta
 fears
 might
 be used as a base for subversive activi-
 ties
 against
 Indonesia.   Rajaratnam said his govern-
 ment
 had assured the Indonesians that Singapore would
 await
 Jakarta's lead on diplomatic ties with Peking.
 He said that might come within a year.
 Rajaratnam, who was invited to Peking last year
 by Foreign Minister Chiao, was the first Singapore

 More important, both sides have opened offi-

 The Chinese may now be prepared to enter into
 direct trade with Bangladesh.   This may be a pre-
 lude to establishment of diplomatic relations.  =
 Chinese of-
 ficials in Hong Kong early in Marc   ot fered to es-
 tablish trade links.   The officials expressed an
 interest in buying jute and invited Dacca to send a
 five-person delegation to the coming Canton Trade
 Fair.
 Until now China has been noncommittal toward
 the Bengalees on the question of trade, and this
 latest move undoubtedly is politically motivated.
 Not too long ago China claimed that it was self-
 sufficient in jute,  and it apparently has little
 need for the fibre.   Furthermore, when inviting the
 Bengalee delegation to the Canton fair, the Chinese
 officials strongly hinted that Peking wanted to
 discuss other matters besides trade.
 Peking and Dacca have been talking about dip-
 lomatic ties since the UN General Assembly session
 last September, but the Chinese have maintained that
 Bangladesh must first exchange ambassadors with Paki-
 stan before the path will be clear for Sino-Bengalee
 ties.  Peking adopted this position at Islamabad's
 urging.
 While the evidence is still tenuous, there may
 have been a recent shift in Pakistan's stand on this
 issue that may have prompted China to revise its own
 game plan.
 Prime Minister Bhutto now no longer opposes
 ~nese recognition of Bangladesh and has left the
 timing entirely up to Peking.

 Nevertheless,  Peking is still taking a
 cautious approach.   The Chinese have specified
 that the Bangalee delegation to the Canton fair--
 although it will be composed of officials from
 various government ministries--should be nonof-
 ficial.   The Chinese may be concerned about
 Bhutto again shifting ground on Sino-Bengalee
 relations but, more likely,  they are unsure
 about President Mijibur Rahman's staying power.
 If a new government should come to power in Dacca,
 China will want to be able to disclaim any support
 for the present group of leaders.   In fact,  the
 Chinese may delay establishing diplomatic relations
 until they are convinced that the situation in
 Bangladesh has become stable.   (SECRET NO FOREIGN

 Proposals To Restructure the Provinces
 There appears to have been an important debate
 within the top leadership over the past several
 years over the best way to organize the government
 below the national level.   Discussions seemed to
 intensify prior to the National People's Congress
 (NPC)--the body that would formally approve any
 such changes--but none of the proposed changes has
 yet been made.   The debate is now muted in the do-
 mestic media, but the proposals appear to have been
 seriously entertained and will probably surface
 again.
 There is sufficient evidence to describe in
 broad terms two basic proposals, but detail is lack-
 ing as to the specifics.   one line of argument appar-
 ently favored regional units, while another plan
 called for increasing the number of provinces while
 reducing them in size.   Paradoxically, these opposing
 views shared some of the same basic goals:   strength-
 ening the central government in the political and
 economic spheres and reducing the power of provincial
 authorities, especially the military.   For the most
 part, however,  the two proposals conflict.
 reported that the idea of
 combining provinces into regions was under serious
 consideration in the summer of 1973.
 that the State Planning Com-
 mission was working on a new system of regions that
 in some instances would involve merging several prove
 inces.                     added that the system would over-
 come  "provincialism," which had been an obstacle to
 economic planning, and that plans were being laid to
 merge local party and government units into a single
 body.

 did not mention any regional po-
 litical organizations, such as the party bureaus
 which existed prior to the Cultural Revolution, but
 some sort of party oversight organization would logi-
 cally accompany the establishment of regional economic
 organizations of the type described.   Thus, the plan
 seemed to raise the spectre of regional power centers
 and perhaps regional party bureaus of some type, and
 it could be expected to draw onposition from those
 who opposed such bodies during the Cultural Revolu-
 tion, quite possibly including Mao.
 Discussion of the plan to increase the number of
 provinces, which may have been spurred by the proposal
 to create regions, came to the fore last year.   Sev-
 eral sources reported that the figure of 50 provinces
 had been proposed.   In addition, a number of articles
 appeared in the domestic media supporting the pro-
 posal.   Arguing by the use of historic example, sev-
 eral articles described how the first Chin emperor
 undercut the power of the feudal princes by basing
 provincial administration on a revised system of "pre-
 fectures."       The modern day equivalent of princes would
 be regional military commanders and provincial leaders.
 one article, which appeared in the November 1974
 issue of the Shanghai journal Study and Criticism,
 referred to the proposal of a much praised legalist
 "to divide the vassal states into smaller fiefs to be
 granted to the descendants of the princes to curb
 their powers."   The article noted that the proposal
 was not put into effect and the princes, although ap-
 pointed by the ruler and thought to be extremely loyal
 to him, eventually became more committed to expanding
 their own power and prerogatives and overthrew the
 dynasty.
 This line of argument is strikingly similar to
 the theoretical underpinning of the current campaign

 to strengthen the proletarian dictatorship--the
 main danger of capitalist restoration comes from
 forces within the socialist society rather than
 class enemies,  foreign or domestic,  and precau-
 tions must be taken to prevent these potentially
 revisionist buds from blooming.   The campaign is
 being carried on in Mao's name and features the
 chairman's repetition of quotations from Marx which
 endorse this reasoning.   The logic, moreover, par-
 allels the theme of several Lo Szu-ting articles
 that seemed to call for the elimination of the threat
 posed by military political power on similar grounds.
 Whatever his current position, Mao may well have sup-
 ported the proposal to increase the number of prov-
 inces last year as a means to break the power of
 provincial military men.   If so, this is another in-
 stance of Mao not getting his way  (see annex).
 The preferences of other key leaders are more
 difficult to fix, although civilian moderates would
 probably tend to support the idea of creating re-
 gional authorities to strengthen economic planning
 and balance military region chiefs and would prob-
 ably be mindful of the threat to central government
 control posed by a proliferation of provinces.   The
 issues are by no means this clear-cut, however, and
 the battle lines certainly not as easily drawn.   Re-
 gional organizations,  for example, could be rivals
 to the central government much as the militar  re-
 gions seem to have become.   Moreover,
 - who reported that under the regime's ten year
 economic plan economic regions would be established
 as well as the number of provinces increased, may be
 reflecting a compromise proposal.
 Whether or not these proposals came close to
 being adopted, the existence of provinces and revolu-
 tionary committees was written into the government
 constitution adopted by the National People's Congress

 in January.   i+onetheless, the debate over the or-
 cganization question may have contributed to the
 long delay in convening the congress.   Furthermore,
 one or more of the issues will probably be revived
 soon.   In February,  for example, Peking changed
 the English translation of the Chinese term for
 the governmental level between the province and the
 county from "special district" to "prefecture."
 This may mean nothing, but since prefecture is the
 same term used in the historical articles, it leaves
 open the possibility that a new drive will be
 launched to abolish or reconfigure the provinces.

 Chinese Step Up Port Improvements
 Recent improvements to Chinese ports may
 have added over 45 million tons of cargo-han-
 dling capacity,  largely eliminating significant
 congestion.   During 1973 China invested twice
 as much in nine major ports as it had the year
 before.   Investment probably increased further
 in 1974.   Construction included addition of over
 12 berths, mechanization of loading and unload-
 ing points, dredging of harbors, and railroad
 trackage and roads to improve access.   At least
 80 percent of China's foreign trade moves by sea.
 Although all ports were improved, Peking
 emphasized those involved in handling petroleum
 shipments--Chin-huang-tao, Dairen, Huang-tao,
 and Chan-chiang.   Ch'in-huang-tao, at the end of
 the pipeline from the giant Ta-ch'ing oil fields,
 now has a new oil wharf accommodating 30,000-ton
 tankers and is readying another to take 70,000-ton
 tankers.   Dairen's port, which can handle tankers
 of up to 50,000 tons and has berths for four
 10,000-ton class ships, will add a sea berth for
 100,000-ton tankers in 1975, and one for 200,000-
 ton tankers later.   Dairen will be fed by a pipe-
 line from Ta-ch'ing that is nearing completion.
 At Huang-tao,  a new oil port near Tsingtao,
 a recently completed oil wharf probably will be
 able to accommodate 70,000-ton tankers.   And the
