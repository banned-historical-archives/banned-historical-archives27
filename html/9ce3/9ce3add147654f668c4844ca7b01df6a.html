 THE POSITIONS OF HANOI, PEKING, AND MOSCOW ON THE
 ISSUE OF VIETNAM NEGOTIATIONS:   1962 to 1966
 This working paper of the DDI/Research Staff sets
 forth the various positions taken by Hanoi, Peking, and
 Moscow on the matter of negotiating a settlement of the
 Vietnam war and analyzes the differences on this issue
 which have emerged between the three Communist states in
 the period between 1962 and 1966.  The North Vietnamese
 and Chinese leaders have been significantly more intran-
 sigent than the present Soviet leaders, but Hanoi?s
 acceptance of talks in principle (provided that Washington
 at least cease airstrikes and declare publicly a commit-
 ment to withdraw American force

 The North Vietnamese made it clear in 1962 that
 they did not intend to make concessions either to set
 up negotiations on Vietnam or in the course of any
 negotiations.   In their concept, only the U.S. would
 make concessions:   the U.S. would first agree to with-
 draw from the South, and in the subsequent negotiations
 the nature and,timing of the U.S. withdrawal would be
 worked out.   The North Vietnamese apparently calculated
 that real negotiations on the real issue--namely, the
 end of the Communist effort against the South--would
 create international pressure on them to make a conces-
 sion corresponding to the one they demanded of Washington.
 They were, therefore, careful to insist that negotiations
 on "reunification"--that is, the Communist military
 political effort against the South--could not be a subject
 of,a Geneva-type conference or DRV-U.S. bilateral negotia-
 tions.  They argued that "reunification" was strictly an
 "internal" matter of the Vietnamese themselves, and in
 this way tried to convince international opinion that
 Washington had no right to intervene.
 The immediate occasion of Hanoi's appeal for inter-
 national negotiations in 1962 was American "interference"
 in the form of the Military Advisory Command in Vietnam
 (MACV), and the bogus concept of a "neutral" South was
 advanced by Hanoi at the time to support its drive to
 create pressure on Washington to dismantle its military
 advisory command.  The Chinese agreed with the North
 Vietnamese that the MACV's presence should be attacked
 and eliminated.   Khrushchev, however, was unwilling to
 push hard on the matter and preferred to provide Hanoi
 with only perfunctory support,  in'the form of backing
 Hanoi's call for a conference to denounce the U.S. role
 in the South.   He not only refused to work actively for
 Hanoi (and Peking), but went so far as to rebuff the North
 Vietnamese, at the cost of exposing his policy of non-
 support to Chinese criticism.                              North Vietnamese militants
 (indirectly) and the Chinese (directly) rebuked Khru-
 shchev for standing aside, and by mid-1963, Moscow-Hanoi

 cooperation broke down significantly as Khrushchev took
 reprisals by withdrawing the small amount of political
 support he had given previously as a routine matter and,
 more importantly, by continuing to withhold valuable
 military aid.  Therefore, in the absence of Soviet influ-
 ence on Hanoi during Khrushchev's period of leadership,
 there was no real prospect for an international confer-
 ence on Vietnam.
 Prior to the fall of Khrushchev in October 1964,
 the North Vietnamese and Chinese leaders apparently had
 agreed on the need to continue the military effort in
 the South and provided important aid to Hanoi; they saw
 no real prospect for a Geneva-type conference.  They
 apparently held in reserve: their differences on whether
 to permit the U.S. to make a face-saving withdrawal (as
 Ho preferred or was willing to accept) or to subject the
 U.S. to a complete military disgrace (as Mao preferred,
 in order to prove his point about the efficacy of small
 wars against the U.S. military capability).  The North
 Vietnamese were aware that:some defeats had been imposed
 on French forces in 1953 and 1954 before those defeats
 and domestic political pressure impelled Paris to with-
 draw; they apparently viewed the precedent as being of
 some relevance to the current situation, the implication
 being that a total American military defeat would not
 be necessary togain their basic objective.   But Mao,
 with greater personal requirements and pretensions to
 international Communist leadership than Ito, demanded
 that the U.S. be forced out militarily.   At the same
 time, he and his lieutenants were careful not to provoke
 a U.S.  attack on China.
 As the new, post-Khrushchev leadership began to
 rebuild the bridge between Moscow and Hanoi which Khru-
 shchev had virtually destroyed, Soviet political influ-
 ence with the North Vietnamese increased; and by Febru-
 ary 1965, Ho was willing temporarily to acquiesce in
 Soviet maneuvers to convene an international conference
 on Vietnam.   Mao and Chou Bn-lai tried to make any con-
 ference an impossibility by demanding, in January 1965,
 that an actual American withdrawal--not just an agree-
 ment to withdraw--be made before negotiations; but the
 CIA-RDP79T00826A 03200010001-9
 App                                 -RDP79T00826A003 00010001-9
 North Vietnamese did not raise this precondition.   At
 first (February 1965), Ho did not try to sabotage the
 Soviet effort to attain a conference at which. Washington
 could be pressed to agree to withdraw American forces.
 But in March 1965, he shifted and opposed the Soviet
 maneuvering because he recognized that (1) the U.S. was
 unwilling to agree to depart and (2) the Soviet effort
 was creating international pressure for Hanoi to be
 less adamant.  Further, he was under considerable pressure
 from the Chinese, who were anxious to sabotage the Soviet
 effort by persuading Ho openly to attack the idea of a
 conference.   Following Ho ? s shift,  the Soviet leaders
 were reduced to demanding an end to the airstrikes as
 necessary for creating the proper atmosphere for a con-
 ference, while avoiding any real negotiating initiatives
 without the clear consent of the North Vietnamese.
 The cessations of bombing in May 1965 and in
 December-January 1966 failed to budge the North Viet-
 namese from their adamant opposition to negotiations,
 because the U.S. had not yielded to their basic demand:
 that Washington make a unilateral public pledge--prior
 to negotiations--to withdraw from the South and also (a
 theme introduced in summer 1965) provide some proof that
 it would do so.   An important political consideration
 in Hanoi's advancement of this line was the need for
 deception--that is, the need to commit Washington to a
 declaration of surrender while pretending that the demand
 for such a declaration was reasonable.  Euphemistic lan-
 guage was used to conceal the fact that the demand was
 simply for surrender.  The North Vietnamese did not,
 therefore, demand a "surrender" expressly, but rather
 called on Washington to "recognize" or "accept" the four
 points (as set forth on 8 April 1965).  Following Ameri-
 can military inputs in July 1965, Hanoi became even more
 unreasonable, and even more frequently demanded that
 the U.S. "carry out" or show by.-"actual deeds" that it
 recognized these points and would abide by them.   Further,
 toward the end of the second suspension of bombing, Ho
 went beyond the demand for proof of U.S. acceptance of
 the four points to the demand that Washington negotiate
 with the Liberation Front and stop bombing forever and
 "unconditionally."   In this way, Ho tried to deflect the

 appeals of Western and neutral leaders for the commence-
 ment of negotiations, and to neutralize the effects of
 the important American political weapon (the cessation
 of bombing) which had revealed Hanoi as the real recal-
 citrant opposed to negotiations.   In short, Hanoi's posi-
 tion since January 1966 has been more adamantly opposed
 to negotiations than it had seemed to be previously.
 As for the North Vietnamese estimate (in 1964) or
 later hope that they could win a military victory at some
 future date,  Hanoi, follozing  the significant American
 involvement in July 1965, began to talk more about an
 eventual political defeat of the U.S. than defeat by
 force of arms.-96-ginning in an important way in the fall
 of 1965, they have been stating privately that American
 public opinion would force the Administration in Washing-
 ton to decide on withdrawal, and they have also stated
 that if this Administration would not so decide, some
 future one will.   At the same time, they have insisted
 that they and the Viet' Cong will fight on, despite U.S.
 airstrikes, until that day.

 I.   SINO-VIETNAMESE AGREEMENT ON NATURE AND TIMING OF
 INTERNATIONAL NEGOTIATIONS AS KHRUSHCHEV STANDS
 ASIDE (February 1962 to October 1964)
 A.  The MACV:  Target of International Negotiations
 (February to July 1962)
 Hanoi and Peking urgently advanced the idea of in-
 ternational negotiations on Vietnam only after the estab-
 lishment of the Military   visory  ommand in Vietnam (MACV)
 in February 1962.  Prior to that time, the Communist
 appeal for negotiations was centered on an appeal for
 North-South contacts.  The ten-point program of the Lib-
 eration Front, as set forth on its foundizg'.day (20
 December 1960), held "peaceful reunification by stages
 on the basis of negotiations" to be a matter between the
 two zones, that is, an internal matter for Vietnamese
 alone.  Even these negotiations were viewed by Hanoi and
 Peking as a highly unlikely development, and the very
 idea of talks was in fact used as a cover under which the
 Viet Cong continued military and subversive operations.
 Pacifists and anti-Diemists in the South were the elements
 that Hanoi hoped to influence with negotiations appeals
 --appeals which strongly implied clandestine contacts
 between the Communists and those men willing to have a
 role in undercutting the stability of the Saigon govern-
 ment.
 Following the establishment of the MACV, however,
 the North Vietnamese, while retaining their basic posi-
 tion on North-South negotiations, added the demand for
 the convening of a 14-nation international conference
 on Vietnam.   They had no intention of negotiating an end
 to t-ie -  ghting---that is, they implicitly rejected the
 Western powers' concept of international talks as the
 means for settling disputes--and revealed their real
 goal:   to use the conference as the forum for increasing
 pressure on Washington to dissolve the military iylc ommnand.
 sub-
 Thus they made it clear that the only permissible
 ject for the conference was to find an "effective" way the
 to compel the U.S. to end its presence in the South.   A
 cease-fire was said to be an "internal" matter, which th
 Vietnamese would decide for themselves.

 unwilling to accept Soviet advice, or at least to hear
 the Soviet position.
 But the Chinese leaders were restrained by no such
 considerations of near-neutrality,  and they moved to
 maneuver Khrushchev into adiplomatic box.  They confronted
 him with the choice of either
 (1)   actively agitating for a conference,
 thereby injuring Soviet-American relations
 by championing the Hanoi-Liberation Front
 cause aggressively rather than perfunctorily,
 or
 (2)   avoiding moves toward a conference on
 Vietnam, thus damaging his relations with
 Hanoi by failing to put pressure on Washing-
 ton.

 Khrushchev acted on (2).*  The Chinese leaders were thus
 in a position to reinforce Hanoi's own awareness that the
 Soviet leader was not effectively supporting their Viet-
 nam enterprise, and the North Vietnamese became increas-
 ingly pessimistic about their ability to use him.   They
 were aware that he desired an Asian Communist ally against
 Mao, but they were gradually brought to recognize that
 he preferred to have his own way with Soviet-American rela-
 tions and would not pay the price for an ally in Hanoi--
 namely, all-out support for the North Vietnamese diplomatic
 game and the Viet Cong military effort.   In mid-March,
 following the departure of the Ponomarev delegation to
 Hanoi, the North Vietnamese urged Moscow (as well as London,
 the other Geneva co-chairman) to "proceed with consulta-
 tions" with countries concerned so as to find effective
 steps for defending peace in the Indochina area.        -
 Foreign Ministry note of 15 March 1962)
 Khrushchev, however, handled the matter in a cur-
 sory way within the confines of diplomatic propriety.
 He merely noted in his speech of 16 March the fact of
 American "interference" in the South.  Furthermore,  a
 Soviet Foreign Ministry note of 17 March stated merely
 that an end to the American presence was necessary in
 order to normalize the situation--a pro forma and un-
 inspired reiteration of what was at the time an urgent
 North Vietnamese demand.
 Although, on the one hand, Khrushchev had refused
 to apply pressure on Washington to convene a had not
 on Vietnam, on the other hand, he apparently   n
 pressed Ho to consider a cease-fire or an end to Hanoi's
 effort to take over the South by military force.   It is
 *In the spring o     62, he was already engaged in his
 major effort to deceive Washington about the Soviet in-
 tention to put strategic missiles in Cuba and he was
 careful not to alarm the U.S. by taking a hard line on
 Vietnam, which was at the time an area of only marginal
 importance to him.

 important to note that on the matter of "reunification"--
 that is, Vietnamese Communist action against Saigon's
 forces--the three Communist capitols agreed that it was
 purely an "internal" matter and, therefore, inadmissible
 as a subject for international talks.  Ho Chi Minh made
 the definitive statement when he declared in March that
 reunification "is an internal affair of the Vietnamese
 people," that "they will decide whether South Vietnam is
 to have a neutral regime or any other regime," and that
 "no other country has a right to interfere."   (Interview
 with the London Daily Express, broadcast from Hanoi on
 27 March 1962)  By _1mp ica?, on, the only permissible
 subject for international talks was the international
 matter of American "interference."  Hanoi's position on
 Geneva negotiations was, therefore, not a basis for dis-
 cussing a ceasefire.   In fact,  it was not a position for
 any "negotiations"--that is, for talks which might be
 undertaken to arrive at a compromise and agreement.   It
 was a demand for an American retreat:  mutual concessions
 were ruled out.  Even the concept of a neu  all' South
 was act                                     may 1962- Ho informed
 Sihanou
 that the creation of a "neutral" South would lead  o   e_
 formation of a bloc of neutrals, namely, Cambodia, Laos,
 Thailand, and Burma "with the ultimate result of forcing
 the closure of U.S. bases and the evacuation of U.S.
 forces from Southeast Asia."
 Ho's duplicitous concept of a bloc of -neutrals was
 later inserted into the Liberation Front's proposals of
 17 Jialy:   "South Vietnam is ready to form with Cambodia
 and Laos a neutral zone in which each country enjoys full
 sovereignty."  But negotiation was explicitly declared
 to be an "internal matter," and first on the list of neu-
 tralization proposals (which included a cease-fire and
 formation of a coalition government) was the demand that
 the MACV be dissolved and all American troops withdrawn
 from the South.
 During the summer of 1962, the North Vietnamese
 felt the need to work more actively to enlist Khrushchev's
 support for an anti-U.S. conference.  Pharr Van Dong on
 5 June demanded that the Geneva co-chairmen "draw serious

 conclusions regarding the American policy of military
 aggression in South Vietnam.               On that basis, they should
 hold ? consult at ions with the countries concerned so as to,
 find effective measures to put an immediate end to the
 U.S.  ~.mper 1a ist policy of aggression."   (emphasis sup
 plied, indicating Hanoi's awareness of Khrushchev's foot-
 dragging)  The North Vietnamese premier was openly critical
 of Great Britain, which "has not lived up to its posi-
 tion and obligations."  The charge cut in the direction
 of Khrushchev.  The North Vietnamese at the time were
 feeling the pinch of stepped up operations against the
 Viet Cong and hoped to influence the Soviet leader to
 reverse his desire to stand clear.  Ho may have tried to
 press Khrushchev for an initiative on an international
 meeting.  Reuters reported him in Moscow on 22 June; on
 28 June, the North Vietnamese ambassador in Peking was
 dispatched to Moscow,  apparently to participate in top
 level Soviet-DRV talks.
 Prior, to the meeting, Khrushchev had been reminded
 ,.,that the USSR is "a country having the initiative to-,con--
 vene the 1954 Geneva conference."   (Khan Dan editorial
 of 19 March 1962)   But he continued  o avid requesting
 such a conference of the British, recognizing that the
 Western powers would resist such a request.   Unlike his
 successors, he was willing to rebuff, the North Vietnamese
 on matters pertaining to real political and military
 assistance for the Vietnam war.   Unlike his successors,
 he was accorded increasing antipathy from men who had
 shown him less hostility than had the Chinese leaders and
 who had been willing to worsen their relations with the
 Chinese to gain Soviet support.   Thus by summer 1962, the
 North Vietnamese saw the handwriting on the wall--namely,
 Soviet as well as Western and neutral opposition to a
 Geneva conference on Vietnam.   Following the=} Soviet-DRY
 agreed with the idea
 of a 14-nation conference,   u    it would be "for
 later."  They had failed in their effort to budge the
 Soviet leader at a time when he was needed to generate
 international pressure on Washington to dissolve MACV.
 As for North-South negotiations, the-North Viet-
 namese revealed the actual meaning of the concept to be

 a process in which the Communists would talk with those
 elements in the South who agreed to surrender.  Ho and
 Dong                    "the situation is not ripe for nego-
 tiations           n                           to negotiate with the South, but only
 with people who agree to sit down at a table and want to
 talk."  That is, Diem was not prepared to talk- about what
 he would give Ho even if Ho were on the way to taking it.
 Ho's conclusion was to continue taking it.
 B. Laos-Type "Neutralization" Infeasible for Vietnam
 (August to October 1962)
 The North Vietnamese viewed the Laos agreement of
 July 1962 as a deterrent to American involvement in the
 Laos fighting, but they were anxious to reject it as
 analogous to the situation in Vietnam.   In Vietnam, they
 were determined to attain a military victory and were
 aware that Diem had refused negotiations,  insisting on a
 military victory himself.   Unlike Laos, there was no power-
 ful neutralist figure in Vietnam who had the forces to
 make negotiations a real consideration.  The Vietnamese
 Communists' real appraisal of the relevance of the Laos-
 type "neutralization" for the situation in South Vietnam
 was that it would become feasible only after military
 successes had smashed Saigon's ability and will to fight
 on.  The Laos-type settlement was discussed in a Viet
 Cong document which evaluated strategy in the South, posit-
 ing two possible developments which might lead to an
 American withdrawal:
 (1)   negotiations forced on the enemy,
 resulting in "a situation like that of
 Laos," or
 (2)   "the enemy may be obliged to recognize
 our sovereignty and independence, as happened
 in Algeria," and completely retreat.   (Docu-
 ment dated 25 September 1962)
 But the central point of the document was-that armed struggle
 must be intensified, and the prospect of negotiating a
 CIA-RDP79T00826A 03200010001-9
 Approved                              DP79T00826A0032 0010001-9
 settlement (or a "temporary compromise") was viewed as
 feasible only when, and if, the US-ARVN military effort
 were to-bog down.   Another Viet Cong document pointed
 out:
 ...we should not overlook the possibility
 of peaceful developments that will gradu-
 ally improve the revolutionary position.
 This possibility is at present very small,
 but the party must exert itself and develop
 it.  Nevertheless, because the U.S.-Diem
 clique will never willingly step down, our
 party must get ready to bring them down by
 force.   (Document of early October 1962)
 Both documents stressed the protracted and arduous nature
 of the military effort ahead.
 The North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong seemed to
 believe that the prospects for negotiating a U.S. with-
 drawal would be good only when the enemy was hard pressed.
 By contrast, they seemed to be more reluctant to consider
 negotiations when their own forces were hard pressed.
 Thus the two above-mentioned documents discussed the pros-
 pects of a political settlement in the event of Viet Cong
 military successes; they did not down dscusitarsettlemhnt did

 American forces were moved into the South in late 1962
 and new airstrike action was taken against the Viet Cong,
 Hanoi matched the American effort by increasing its Infil-
 tration into the South.                              That is, the North Vietnamese
 rejected the alternative:   reducing the size of the Com-
 munist forces (or standing pat with what was already in
 the field) and allowing the fighting to recede to a low
 boil.

 political support deprived him of leverage on Hanoi.   His
 foot-dragging was reflected in the performance of CPSU
 secretary Andropov in North Vietnam.      In his speech of
 16 January 1963, Andropov verbally supported Hanoi's
 demand "for an end to interference and the withdrawal of
 all U.S. troops" from the South, but he indicated that
 Soviet aid was intended for the DRV's "economy," and
 he did not refer to strengthening its military defenses.
 His effort to gain Hanoi's support in the Sino-Soviet
 dispute was not successful--Nhan Dan on 20 January de-
 clared North Vietnamese suppor  only for measures "aimed
 at strengthening solidarity within the international Com-
 munist movement and preventing a new world war."  Khru-
 shchev's attacks against the CCP by proxy at a series
 of Soviet bloc party' congresses clearly had further
 antagonized the militants among the North Vietnamese
 leaders, who were angered by his non-support.
 Le Duan led the militant attack.   In his speech
 of 13 March 1963 at the Nguyen Ai Quoc Party School, he
 implicitly rejected Khrushchev's emphasis on "economic
 and ideological struggles" by insisting that they "must
 serve the cause of the political struggle."  He declared
 revolutionary "violence" to be the "only way" to seize
 national power and criticized the "Yugoslav revisionists"
 for advocating a "road of class compromise," concluding
 with the demand that these revisionists should be
 "thoroughly exposed."
 Some North Vietnamese leaders apparently tried to
 stand clear of the proliferating Sin.o-Soviet polemic and
 the swing to the left within the Lao Dong Party.   Pham
 Van Dong, a moderate, did not criticize Khrushchev by
 implication and merely repeated the platitude that various
 Communist parties have "different opinions on certain
 questions."   (Report to the DRV National Assembly of 29
 April)  This difference in treatment of Khrushchev re-
 flected differences among the leaders in Hanoi.  There
 is some evidence that tensions were high.   Nhan Dan on
 11 February 1963 had alluded to an inner-party d spute:
 differences "may arise not only between Communist and
 workers parties, but also right among comrades within
 the same party."  Party first secretary Le Duan had also

 hinted that an argument had taken place, the issue ap-
 parently being whether "to persevere" Or "to retreat"
 in the South at a time when U.S. and ARVN forces had
 increased their military capability.   (Speech of 13
 March) *
 Le Duan's hard-line course for continued military
 struggle apparently was the view that prevailed, and it
 was the guideline for future policy.   Liu Shao-chi later
 indicated his satisfaction with Le Duan's hard-line when
 he stated in Hanoi on 12 May 1963 that emphasis on "sharp
 class struggle...was well said by Comrade Le Duan."
 This move closer to the Chinese position did not
 mean that the.North Vietnamese leadership had been pene-
 trated by CCP agents or that it had become the doctrinal
 captive of Liu Shao-chi and the hard-line leaders of the
 CCP.    (Liu, at the time, had come to Hanoi in May 1963
 to try to move the North Vietnamese still closer to his
 and Mao's policy of non-compromise with Khrushchev.)  Even
 the men usually depicted by foreign observers as pro-
 Chinese were independent of outside control, as witness
 the militant, Truong Chinh.   Truong Chinh personally
 praised Liu Shao-chi in a speech in Hanoi on 15 May, but
 made it clear that he would not accept Liu's position on
 the need to reject "a middle course" between the CPSU and
 the CCP.   He insisted that North Vietnam's progress is
 "inseparable" from the support of all other Communist
 parties, "particularly the CPSU and the CCP."   (Truon
 Chinh is also reported to have commented                            25X1
 in May that North Vietnam would build soc a Ism
 Qn  ine with its "own" position and national interests.)
 Ho Chi Minh himself strongly suggested to Liu that the
 North Vietnamese would not accept the entire CCP position
 in the dispute.   He stated publicly in Liu's presence on

 10 May that "The Vietnamese Workers Party highly appreciates
 all the efforts made by the fraternal parties  first of
 all the CPSU and the.CCP "  Ho also told                    25X1
 that he would not permit
 North Vietnam to become a victim o:i Chinese imperialism
 as in the past.
 Although the North Vietnamese refused to adopt the
 CCP position that CCP and CPSU relations could not be
 returned to a state Of cooperation, they were further
 angered by Khrushchev's move toward a degree of coopera-
 tion with Washington--signing of the tripartite partial
 test ban treaty in July.  They used the party journal
 (Hoc Tap,  issue of July 1963) to attack the Soviet lead-
 er--us ng the surrogate, "Tito"--for raising the unlikely
 prospect of a "world war with nuclear weapons" to con-
 ceal the real American plan to wage special wars and
 local wars; in this way, he hoped to avoid any "active"
 support for Communist-led small wars.   They insisted
 (using Hoc Tap) that negotiations with Western leaders
 must node used to ''foresake the revolutionary interests
 of nations" and that armed struggle is "the main way"
 to seize power.   On 15 July, a DRV Foreign Ministry
 statement implied that Khrushchev was not doing all he
 could.   It called on all governments to severely condemn
 the U.S. openly and to demand a withdrawal of American
 troops.  The statement requested the Geneva co-chairmen
 to "take every effective step to end the war."  The
 militants' irritation; with Khrushchev was also suggested
 when, on 2 September, Soviet deputy foreign minister
 Lapin, with some show 'of embarrassment,  asked the British
 ambassador in Moscow if he had received a DRV declaration
 of late August.   The clear implication was that the North
 Vietnamese had not provided Moscow with the usual prior
 knowledge of the content of a DRV declaration to the
 Geneva co-chairmen.
 This was only One of several indications of the
 breakdown in Hanoi-Moscow cooperation.   The North Viet-
 namese also pointed up the irrelevance of the partial
 test ban treaty to the: Communist effort in South Vietnam.
 When the American delegation "came smilingly with an ap-
 pearance of friendliness to Moscow," President Kennedy

 stated in the U.S. that America "will continue to give
 aid to Diem...and is determined to stay in?:South Vietnam."
 (Hoc Tap, August 1963)  The North Vietnamese were also
 impel ec to attack the UN inspection team to investigate
 the Buddhist problem in the South in early October,
 clearly angered by the failure of the Soviet UN delega-
 tion to raise any objection to its formation.   Khrushchev
 _-"Tito"" -was also criticized for depicting the South and
 the North as "two countries" in his "scheme to perpetuate
 the division of Vietnam."   (Khan Dan article of 10 October
 1963)
 In short, Hanoi's militants attacked Khrushchev's
 thinly veiled preference to avoid provoking Washington
 by real support of Hanoi.   In reprisal, Khrushchev took
 punitive action against the North Vietnamese by withdraw-
 ing the type of political support which previously he had
 given as a routine matter.   Polish members of ICC teams
 were                                                                25X1
 directed--ultimately from Moscow, no  ou      o avoid
 defending the North Vietnamese against charges of violat-
 ing the Geneva agreements.
 Parallel with their implicit criticism of Khru-
 shchev, the North Vietnamese sustained their distinction
 between internal talks and external pressure on the U.S.
 Negotiations was strictly an internal matter between
 "genuine representatives of the two zones," while the
 external matter pertained to the need for U.S. capitula-
 tion:
 Only by defeating U.S. aggression and form-
 ing a national coalition government in
 South Vietnam, as advocated in the Liberation
 Front program, can there be conditions
 to achieve peaceful reunification of
 the country.   (Pham Van Dong speech to
 the DRV National Assembly of 29 April
 1963)
 The order of priorities was clearly U.S. withdrawal first
 and internal negotiations later.  This order was set
 forward by the Liberation Front in a statement of 18
 July 1963:

 We hold that the South Vietnamese prob-
 lem cannot be settled without carrying
 out the Liberation Front program--that
 is, the US government must end its
 armed intervention and aggression in the
 South, dismantle the US military command
 in Saigon /MACV7, and withdraw-all troops,
 weapons, and war materiel of the US and
 its satellites from: the South.  Then the
 parties concerned in South Vietnam must
 stop fighting with each other so as to
 restore peace and security, with the un-
 derstanding that the South Vietnamese
 people will settle their own internal
 affairs, and a national, democratic, peace-
 ful, and neutralistcoalition govern-
 ment will be formed in South Vietnam.
 (emphasis supplied)
 By avoiding the issue of negotiations with the U.S. about
 a cease-fire, the Communists side-steppe   eman s, pri-
 marily from neutrals, that both sides should make conces-
 sions.                        They worked at the same time to create an impres-
 sion of reasonableness and to characterize the U.S. as in-
 transigent on the matter of "neutralization"--a concept
 they knew De Gaulle would accept as the pretext for induc-
 ing an American withdrawal.,
 D.        "Neutralization":   A Finesse For Expelling
 the U.S.  (June 1963 to March 1964)
 Pham Van Dong used the ambiguous concept of neutral-
 ization                         on 29 June 1963 in his talk with the French
 lelegate General, who was leaving Hanoi and was a convenient
 channel for conveying Hanoi:"s line to Paris.  De la Bois-
 siere described the concept; as the "Soviet solution"--
 which it had been at times 'in 1962 and 1963,-but at the
 time, Pham Van Dong was clearly aware that it was the
 French solution, too.  The departing Delegate General told
 American officials in Saigon that the DRV premier had in-
 sisted on some sort of arrangement to neutralize the country
 : CIA-RDP79T00826 003200010001-9
 App
 -'RDP79T00826A00320 010001-9
 as the only way the South could eject the Americans.
 Hanoi apparently hoped that De Gaulle would publicize
 this logic.  They were irritated, therefore, when De
 Gaulle on 29 August 1963 went beyond Hanoi's concept by
 implying that the North as well as the South should be
 neutralized.  They apparently viewed the French leader
 as having been deceptive with their own deceptive idea
 of a neutral South/
 Regarding negotiations, the North Vietnamese de-
 picted it as still a matter between the North and the
 South (rather than between the Communists and the Ameri-
 cans).  Even in the six "urgent demands" set forth by the
 Liberation Front on 8 November 1963 in an effort to erode
 the post-Diem authorities' will to resist, withdrawal
 was a key stipulation.   (Negotiations for a cease-fire
 was an internal matter, and the formation of a neutral
 zone with Cambodia and Laos was the justification for
 demanding the ouster of American forces.)*  It was clean,
 however, that neutralization would not be applied to the.
 North.

 would permit the Americans to retreat when they wanted
 to retreat :  when the time was "ripe," he said, Hanoi
 would be as flexible as it was now rigid.   At the time,
 in late 1963, the North Vietnamese acted to supply the
 Viet Cong, who were attacking in larger units, with more
 sophisticated weapons.
 On the doctrinal level, the North Vietnamese mili-
 tant line against international negotiations--that is,
 against talks between any Communist country and the U.S.--
 prevailed.  They probably: viewed Khrushchev's 31 December
 1963 letter to heads of state on settling border conflicts
 through negotiations as cutting partly in their direction.
 They attacked his preference for political talks along
 the lines of the overall Chinese polemical offensive.
 They did not rule out international discussions, but in-
 sisted,                        in a general doctrinal formulation, that such
 talks must not deprive Communists of their revolutionary
 goals:
 Unprincipled negotiations and compromise,
 which do not proceed from the interests
 of revolution and do not rely on mass
 struggle, can only endanger revolution and
 world peace.   In such cases, the greater
 good will we demonstrate for negotiations,
 the harder the imperialists will press
 us.  The more concessions we make, the
 more they will demand.   (Hoc Tap article
 of January 1964)
 In short, they insisted that international negotiations
 must not stand in the way of a revolutionary seizure of
 power.*
 ~n m      - e ruary     4, the Chinese implicitly criticized
 Khrushchev for trying "to strike disgraceful bargains"
 with the U.S. at the "expense" of the North Vietnamese
 and Viet Cong.   (Budapest speech of Chinese student

 However, the North Vietnamese continued to advocate
 national negotiations with anti-Saigon forces in the South
 as a possible way to induce the U.S. to withdraw.  They
 were even willing to softpedal publicity for armed struggle
 as the only possible way to obtain an American pullout;
 they had the Liberation Front breathe new life into the
 idea of talks among Vietnamese.   When, on 3 February 1964--
 following the coup in Saigon on 30 January--the Libera-
 tion Front issued: its statement proposing a "reasonable
 negotiated settlement," the Front made it clear that the
 negotiators would be anti-Saigon elements in the South.
 The role of Washington was not that of negotiator.  The
 Front's minimum program called for
 1.  The US imperialists to stop their war
 and withdraw all troops, weapons, and war
 ma erle  from South Vietnam.
 2.  The parties and forces in South Vietnam
 to negotiate with one another-to'-seek a reason-
 able measure for the country on the basis
 of peace, independence, and neutrality in
 South Vietnam, and on the principle that
 the South Vietnamese people solve their
 internal affairs in the spirit of placing
 national interests above all.   (emphasis
 supplied)
 Demand (1). implied that withdrawal was a precondition for
 settlement, but did not state this explicitly.  Demand
 (2) confined talks to the sphere of internal discussions.
 The North Vietnamese again tried to use the bogus
 idea of neutrality to serve as the pretext for a U.S. with-
 drawal.  They were angered by the implication of De Gaulle's
 position, namely, that neutralization was applicable to
 the North.  They complained:  why had "President, Johnson"
 (rea3_,__IMe Gaulle") raised "the question of neutralizing
 both zones of Vietnam, although he knows too well that
 our people will never accept the neutralization of North

 Mansfield's comments on neutralization as the true posi-
 tion of the Administration, and stated that when the
 Administration takes-:this position publicly, Hanoi will
 do "everything possible" to permit "a dignified with-
 drawal by the U.S. from South Vietnam.}  This apparently
 differed from the Chinese view which reflected Mao's
 desire to inflict a disastrous and clear-cut military
 defeat on all American forces in the South and a face-
 losing withdrawal.
 E.   Hanoi Says Military Successes Must Precede
 Talks (April - May 1964)
 But before withdrawal could become a lively pos-
 sibility, the North Vietnamese calculated that some
 defeats would have to be imposed on U.S. forces.   Some
 defeats had been imposed on French forces in 1953 and
 1954 before Paris agreed to.withdraw,  and the analogy
 was viewed as being relevant to the current situation
 in the South.
 Hanoi's rejection of any international talks before
 attaining a series of military successes in the South was
 strongly suggested in remarks made in April and May 1964.
 Writing in the theoretical journal Hoc Tap in April, Major
 General Hoang Van Thai stated that t-H-e M4 and 1962
 Geneva conferences were convened "only after" important
 military defeats had been administered to the enemy.   That
 is, negotiations could not be held when the enemy was
 still confident regarding his-over-all military position.
 General Giap made the definitive North Vietnamese state"
 ment on the situation which should prevail before talks
 with the U.S. could begin.  Giap declared on 13 April:

 way for the conclusion of the 1954

 Geneva agreements which established
 peace in Indochina...All negotiations

 forms against their perfidious designs.
 Only when the people's forces have grown
 in their struggle are the imperialists
 compelled to renounce their privileges
 and interests and recognize our legitimate
 rights.   (Interview with Wilfred Burchett,
 released on 9 May 1964)   (emphasis supplied)
 Giap indicated that this position was that of Ho Chi Minh.
 Giap claimed that "Washington is now looking for a way
 out," the implication having been that the U.S. was probing
 Hanoi's attitude toward talks.     "But the only possible
 way out, the only solution, our President Ho Chi Minh
 told you this morning."
 Giap's version of Hots position as well as that
 of the Liberation Front contained the unusual formulation
 that "The. prerequisite /Tor a settlement7 must be the
 complete withdrawal" of-American forces-and equipment.
 "Prerequisite" had not appeared in Hanoi's vocabulary
 because .'it.created the impression of unreasonable demands
 originating with the North Vietnamese.  Further,  it was
 anathema to the Soviet leaders, who preferred the usual
 Hanoi locutions which avoided any talk of prerequisites,
 preconditions, or prior pledges.*  Ho's main message to.
 Washington and'the West in the spring of 1964 was that
 even in the face of probable escalation of the war, Hanoi
 would not end its military effort in the South,
 ovt sans   v  y to Vietnamese Communist usage was
 indicated in the spring of 1963.  After TASS had reported
 that in an important article on Vietnam the chairman of
 the Liberation Front had declared that "The US must give
 a solemn undertaking to withdraw its armed forces.,.,"
 in Pravda's purported version (7 May 1963) this demand
 for a poor pledge was deleted.

 Ho also tried to indicate that the North Vietnamese
 were not completely helpless and, in the event of air-
 strikes against targets in the North, Vietnamese "both
 North and South" would fight together and fight harder.
 (Although Giap warned that an American attack "would be
 quite dangerous" for the U.S., he did not cite Chinese
 or Soviet support as a deterrent.)  To what degree were
 Khrushchev and Mao willing to support Hanoi's effort in
 the South?
 F.   Mao Increases Support for DRV as Khrushchev
 Stands Aside (January 1964 to August 1964)
 Hanoi's militants, while taking a hard line with
 Khrushchev, returned to the abandoned effort to move him
 toward real support in January 1964.  The Soviet leader
 was invited to end his footdragging at a time when a
 major Soviet deterrent statement was needed to warn the
 U.S. against beginning airstrikes over the North.  "We
 continue to call for ever more practical and vigorous
 support."   (Nguyen Van Vinh article in Hoc Tap of January
 1964)   At the same time, Le Duan's trip-To Moscow to
 gain Soviet aid apparently was a failure; the North
 Vietnamese continued to demand "practical" aid.  (Nhan
 Dan editorial of 15 February)  This editorial referred
 f-oa Soviet statement of support and went on to raise a
 plea:   "We clearly see that, transformed into practical
 deeds, this statement will be valuable."  But Khrushchev's
 apparent decision at the time was to persist in his policy
 of non-involvement.
 By contrast, Mao became increasingly involved,
 particularly following American actions to bolster Laotian
 and ARVN forces after the Communist offensive of mid-May

 1964.*  Mao apparently decided to review the Indochina
 military situation in the context of the clear demonstra-
 tion of U.S. determination.   In mid-June 1964, he and
 other Chinese leaders met at the "work conference" of the
 CCP Central Committee and apparently decided, among other
 thines. to increase looistic support for Hanoi.
 **Despite increasing involvement, the Chinese all along
 were careful to avoid identifying Peking in any direct
 military sense with Hanoi's defense effort.  They also
 were careful to avoid open commitments to defend North
 Vietnamese territory.  For example, when Lt. General
 Nguyen Van Vinh discussed a hypothetical "invasion" of
 the North by U.S. ground forces and then referred to the
 consequences--viz., that the U.S. "would have to cope
 not only with North Vietnam, but also with.China" (Hoc
 Tap article of January 1964)--the Chinese deleted the

 Despite their concern, which increased in the first
 half of 1964, the North Vietnamese neither backed off from
 their military-support role of the Viet Cong nor softened.
 their position that negotiations was a matter for Vietnamese
 alone.   U.S. troops must be "completely withdrawn from
 the South, and the people of the South must themselves
 decide their own affairs."   (DRV Foreign Ministry statement
 of 11 February 1964)*   Repeating their line of October
 1963, they stated their intention to persevere in "a
 long and hard struggle."   (Le Duc Tho article in Nhan
 Dan of 3 February and Ho Chi Minh interview of 29 F' biru-
 ary)   At the same time, they implied that Khrushchev
 should desist from his policy of denying Hanoi valuable
 military equipment:   "'We must strengthen the national
 defense forces of all socialist countries,  and not only
 that of one particular country."    (Pham Hung article in
 Hoc Tap of May 1964)  Nevertheless, Khrushchev held back
 ann3 mused to supply the North Vietnamese with any im-
 portant military aid.
 During the CCP Central Committee "work conference"
 in June, Khrushchev may have tried to warn Mao and the
 North Vietnamese that the USSR would not necessarily sup-
 port them in the event: of an enlarged war.   Pravda on 21
 June carried an article which warned that Ch nlia could not
 count on Soviet support.  The Chinese stated, through a
 Hong Kong channel, that this Soviet position encouraged
 rather than deterred Washington:
 ...such an indication /that the Sino-Soviet
 treaty was a dead letter7 by the CPSU
 leaders at a time when the U.3. is rat-

 "to relax tension in Asia, it is necessary for US im-
 perialism to get out of Asia and not for China to refrain
 from supporting the peoples in their struggle."   (People's

 people of Indochina and China and to

 (commentary of 14 July)
 .Khrushchev's non-support made it easy for the Chinese to
 disgrace him further in the view of the North Vietnamese
 by declaring that China always maintained that "it is an
 unshirkable proletarian an internationalist duty to safeguard
 the peace and security of the entire socialist camp, to
 protect all its members from imperialist aggression."
 (People's Daily editorial of 9 July)
 The North Vietnamese militants sustained their
 attack against Khrushchev.   An article by Le Chuong in the
 July 1964 issue of Hoc Tap stated that the policy of making
 concessions to the !.mss not the road to peace "nor
 is it the road to drive back aggression and enslavement
 by the U.S. imperialists in South Vietnam .... The libera-
 tion of South Vietnam can be settled only by force,"
 This hard-line criticism of Khrushchev's policy--or what
 the militants projected as being his policy--was similar
 to that of Le Duan, whose report to the Lao Dong Party
 Central Committee of December 1963 was published in
 February 1964 with implicit anti-Khrushchev thrusts.
 Khrushchev's "betrayal" (non-support) of Hanoi
 was made even clearer immediately following the 5 August

 non-support.        Privately, the Chinese complained that Khru-

 Cheng-chic said that if the U.S. were to escalate the

 Soviet support for this American attitude, inasmuch as
 neither government was "actively for it."  Mao made this

 by leaders who were anxious for a conference.  This new

 II. SINO-VIETNAMESE DISAGREEMENT ON NEGOTIATIONS AS
 KHRUSHCHEV IS REPLACED (October 1964 to April 1965)
 A.      Peking Departs from Hanoi?s View on Timing
 of International Negotiations (October 1964
 to January 1965)
 When,  in mid-October 1964, Khrushchev was brought
 down by a heterogeneous group, the majority of whom were
 more ideologically oriented than their predecessor, his
 policy of working for "normal"--i.e., doctrinally untainted--25X1-
 relations with the U. S.  (at the expense of Soviet influ-
 ence in Hanoi) was reappraised.  The new leaders appar-
 primary defect of Khrushchev s policy o  non-support was:
 it had exposed the CPSU to effective political attacks
 from the CCP.   And when, in December and January, they
 probed U.S.  intentions to determine the degree of escala-
 tion which Washington considered feasible and safe, they
 seem to have concluded that direct Soviet military involve-
 ment with U.S. forces was unlikely and, at the worst, a
 risk which could be controlled.   Moreover, they apparently
 believed that the U.S. wanted a way out.  They felt secure,
 therefore,  in trying to increase their influence (and
 reduce Chinese influence) with Ho by beginning a program
 of military and political support.
 Nevertheless, they retained the former basic Soviet
 preference--viz,, to have Ho end the war.  Thus they were
 enmeshed in a dilemma between increasing aid, which sus-
 tained Ho's desire and ability to keep fighting, and
 working for international negotiations, which undercut
 that desire.   They apparently believed that a marginal
 chance existed for resolving the dilemma by convincing
 Ho to negotiate an American withdrawal.
 All along, Peking and Hanoi apparently had agreed
 on the desirability of continuing the military effort
 and on the timing of international negotiations.  They
 apparently held in reserve their differences on whether

 to subject the U.S. to a total military disgrace (as Mao
 preferred) or to permit the U.S. to make a face-saving
 withdrawal (as Ho preferred or was willing to accept).
 When, however, the new Soviet leadership raised the pos-
 sibility of negotiating an American pullout, Peking
 acted to make this an impossibility.   So long as Khru-
 shchev was in power and continued to avoid involvement
 in Vietnam, refusing to pressure Washington to withdraw,
 the Chinese were not worried about the prospects of any
 international negotiations on Vietnam taking place.  But
 when Khrushchev's successors, starting in November 1964,
 began to rebuild the Moscow-Hanoi relationship which
 Khrushchev had almost completely destroyed, the Chinese
 began to reveal considerable sensitivity to the issue
 of negotiations.*  They feared that Moscow?s basic prefer-
 ence for talks would now be pressed upon Hanoi with a
 better chance of success, and began to fight a new hold-
 ing battle.  Their suspicion of Ho?s intentions increased
 as they  detected traces of flexibility in Hanoi's view
 of international negotiations.
 In the most extensive public discussion of precon-
 ditions for negotiations up to that time (December 1964),
 the North Vietnamese indicated that they were in a strong
 military and political position and stated that they would
 talk when the Americans were ready to withdraw.  They were
 looking for indications that the Americans were ready.**
 **They were looking for an indication that Washington
 had changed, or would be willing to change, the position
 set forth by Ambassador Lodge in his public statement in
 Paris on 18 August 1964:   the "first and absolute pre-
 requisite condition" for a conference would be the cessa-
 tion of Vietnamese Communist intrusions into the South.

 They stated that the U.S. "is not willing to enter into
 negotiations because 'it is in a losing position."   (Nhan
 Dan article of 5 December 1964)   The issue of American
 conditions for talks was openly and fully discussed for
 the first time in the'Nhan Dan editorial of 19 December.
 Noting that Dien Bien Piu-haft "forced the enemy to accept
 defeat," this important editorial complained that

 but are not intransigent....

 sovereignty, we are ready to talk peace
 with him.   (emphasis supple
 The North Vietnamese leaders indicated their view
 that the precedent of the 1954 French withdrawal could
 point the way to an eventual American pullout.   As the
 19 December editorial put it:
 We carried out a protracted war against
 the French-and even when we won great
 victory at Dien Bien Phu, we were prepared
 to hold peaceful negotiations with the
 French at the Geneva conference.   But we
 also realized that unless the Dien Bien Phu
 victory was woo, the French would not have
 gone to Geneva :for peaceful negotiations
 with us.   As for the U.S. aggressors,
 although they have been burnt to the
 eyebrows, they stubbornly maintain that
 their situation: is critical but has not
 yet come a cropper.   Talks by means of
 weapons must be continued more vigorously.

 withdrawal, and
 (2)   when Washington is prepared to do so,
 a total defeat of all American forces is
 not necessary; the withdrawal could be
 negotiated to save face for Washington.
 But the Chinese leaders moved to make (2) an impos-
 sibility by raising conditions which would prevent Wash-
 ington from ever moving toward talks.  First, aware of
 the Washington-Saigon position against ceding talks with
 representatives of the Liberation Front, the Chinese in
 late December 1964 greatly intensified the North Viet-
 namese effort to depict the Front as the only legitimate
 representative of the South Vietnamese.   Second, aware
 that Washington would not agree to withdraw   erican
 forces prior to receiving adequate guarantees from the
 Communist side, the Chinese made an actual American with-
 drawal a precondition for an international conference
 on Vietnam. TheTowing discussion will examine the
 two-pronged Chinese spoiling effort and will then turn
 to Moscow's political maneuvers to improve the prospects
 for negotiations.
 B.  Peking Helps to Upgrade the Role of the
 Liberation Front (December 1964)
 In late December, when Hanoi was celebrating three

 December 1960,*  Both in the nature and in the number of

 their comments, the Chinese exceeded the North Vietnamese
 in praise for the Front as the leader of the Southerners.
 Chen Yi made the strongest Peking statement of support
 for the Front up to that time.   Chen declared that the
 Front
 has now become the genuine representative
 of th 14 million South Vietnamese people,
 and the South Vietnam question can only
 be settled through negotiations without
 outside interference and in accordance
 with the program of the National Liberation
 Front and the desire of the South Viet-
 namese people.   There is no other way out.
 (Speech of 19 December 1964)   (emphasis
 supplied)
 Hanoi's VNA account of Chen's speech omitted this entire
 passage, which had upgraded the Front.  The North Viet-
 namese, anxious to maintain the fiction of the Front's
 autonomy, were careful to create the impression that they
 had played no directing role in upgrading the Front's
 status.   Moreover, they apparently hoped to sustain their
 pose of flexibility.  But the Chinese had no such require-

 the political status of the Front.

 Interposing the Front as a major force and there-
 fore as the legitimate negotiator for the Communist side
 in international talks was welcomed by the Chinese as a
 way to make such talks impossible.   In December 1964, they
 apparently welcomed any move from Hanoi to thrust the
 Front forward as a major political force.   An NCNA report
 of the 19 December reception in Peking described the
 Front as the "organizer and leader of victorious revolu-
 tionary struggle of the South Vietnamese" and then quoted
 the acting head of the Front's Peking office as claiming
 that'the Front was expanding daily and had formed "basic
 level units" in the countryside and the cities.   However,
 Hanoi's VNA version omitted both statements.   Only in
 the following months did Hanoi,  in statements attributed
 to North Vietnamese, exaggerate the role.of the Front
 publicly as Peking had started to do in December.   It
 was important,  in the view of the Chinese leaders, to
 publicize the Front as a negotiator at a time when the
 post-Khrushchev leadership was moving to influence Hanoi,
 if possible, to consider the possibility of negotiations
 with the U.S. and to probe Washington to determine its
 view on talks.
 C.  Peking Opposes Vietnam Negotiations Until
 After an American Withdrawal (January 1965)
 In addition to greatly increasing publicity for
 the Front, the Chinese leaders acted to spoil any real
 prospects for negotiations by introducing a precondition
 which Washington. could not accept.  This precondition
 was the demand that the U.S. withdraw its forces before
 talks could take place.  They were aware that the U.S.
 would reject a procedure in which the key matter to be
 negotiated had already been resolved before talks started.
 F'Is it your policy now  o
 insist upon the withdrawal o          US forces before participat-
 ing in a Geneva conference to discuss the international
 position of a unified Vietnam?"  Neither in private

 discussions or published materials had the Chinese pre-
 viously mentioned the tactic of withdrawal before holding
 an international conference.   It was a new ploy, almost
 certainly directed against Moscow and Hanoi:   the Soviet
 and the North Vietnamese did not refer to this Maoist
 position in private or public statements.  Their position
 was that there could be no final settlement without a
 U.S. withdrawal, but the start of negotiations would not
 require prior withdrawal.
 In his reply, Mao is quoted by Snow as having raised
 several possibilities.   By talking around the point, Mao
 partially concealed the new Chinese position among a range
 of four possibilities in order to avoid the appearance
 of increased intransigence:.   (Furthermore, by raising
 four possibilities, k Mao was ensuring his infallibility,
 inasmuch as he could hardly be proven wrong on all four.)
 Several possibilities should be mentioned.
 First, a conference might be held and US
 withdrawal would follow.   Second, the con-
 ference might be deferred until after withdrawal.   Third, a co nference n3   -be
 e~i Td 5ii  1Js troops might stay around Saigon,
 as in the case of Korea.            Finally,  the
 South Vietnamese Front might drive out
 the Americans without any conference or
 international agreement.   (emphasis sup-
 plied)
 It will be clear from the December 1964 upgrading of the
 Front and the Maoist downplaying of negotiations, that
 Mao really preferred that the final possibility would be
 attained.  But he was speaking in the context of a ques-
 tion on talks before or after a U.S. withdrawal.  That,
 faced with consideration of a conference,he preferred the
 position underscored in the nar-seave a have
 Mao had raised four
 Posse                                        war, but the Chinese
 "greatly prefer" the possibility of a U.S. "retreat first,
 followed by negotiations."  By contrast, Soviet and North
 Vietnamese demands for an American withdrawal  did not
 indicate when this was to take place.

 This interpretation--namely, that Mao had introduced
 a precondition which hardened the Chinese position--is
 supported by two versions of Chou En-lai's January 1965
 statement to Edgar Snow.   According to one version, Chou
 told Snow that
 The only precondition for an international
 conference is, as Chairman Mao Tse-tung
 has stated, the withdrawal of U. S. forces
 from Vietnam.   (Tokyo Ashai version of 27
 February 1965, evening e%   ion)
 According to a later version of Chou's remark, the Chinese
 desired a conference to be held "immediately" on Laos and
 Cambodia, but not on Vietnam.   Regarding Vietnam, the
 '.'prerequisite question,"  hou said, was withdrawal, not
 a conference:
 The present state of South Vietnam is
 not such as demands the immediate hold-
 ing of an international conference.  The
 biggest and most prerequisite question
 is the withdrawal of American forces.
 (Tokyo Ashai version, 7 March 1965, Weekly
 Issue)
 This second version in effect made withdrawal of American
 forces a precondition for holding any international nego-
 tiations on Vietnam.   It is close to the position "retreat
 rst   followed b  ne otiations."
 Taken together, the positions of Mao and Chou ap-
 parently were intended to undercut any Soviet move to
 use a Geneva conference on Laos as the venue for beginning
 talks on South Vietnam at a time when Hanoi had begun to
 discuss more extensively than ever before Washington's
 attitude toward Vietnam negotiations.

 D.   Moscow Suggests a"Way Out" For the U.S.
 (February 1965)
 Fragmentary reports suggest that Kosygin proposed
 to Chou and Chen Yi on 5 February that the matter of negotia-
 tions should be considered as the means for permittin
 Washington to withdraw with facg_,*_/_
 Chen Yi's own eliptical version of Kosygin's 5 February
 proposal was that China had been asked "to persuade North
 Vietnam to agree to negotiate peace...At that time,  I
 answered that the North Vietnamese people's struggle had
 been going on even before'the Chinese revolution, and that
 if China did as it was asked to, China would be laughed
 at for its cowardice."   (Interview with Japanese parlia-
 mentarians, Tokyo Shimbun  2 June 1965)  That is, Chen
 rejected the negoti Lions proposal and the suggestion
 that Peking apply pressure to Hanoi.   Yet another Chinese
 Communist version did not mention the matter of Kosygin's
 alleged request for applying pressure on Hanoi, but
 described his negotiations proposal:
 In the course of the exchange of opinions
 between China and the Soviet Union, Comrade
 Kosygin emphasized the necessity to help the

 U.S. "find a way out of Vietnam."           In com-
 plete earnest we pointed out at that time
 that since the American imperialists were
 stepping up their aggression against Viet-
 nam, this was no time to negotiate with
 the American aggressors, but rather to
 take up arms with a view to resisting
 them.  We hoped that you would not seek
 a way out for the U.S., nor make any
 settlement with them concerning the Viet-
 namese question.   At that time, Comrade
 Kosygin expressed agreement with our views
 and declared that the new Soviet leader-
 ship "would not bargain with others over
 this c uestion."
 The Chinese rebuff did not prevent Kosygin and the Soviet
 leadership from pressing on to explore the possibilities
 of a conference on Vietnam.
 In Hanoi, Kosygin probably broached the matter of
 an international conference with the North Vietnamese
 leaders.  On 7 February, he agreed with the "DRV Govern-
 ment" that a conference on Laos should be held, but went
 beyond this to state the position of the "Soviet Union"
 in support of the resolution of the Cairo nonaligned
 nations conference for the convocation of "a new interna-
 tional conference on Indochina with a view to the peaceful
 settlement of the questions which have arisen there."
 This careful distinction between Hanoi's desire for a
 conference on Laos and Moscow?.s support for a conference
 on "Indochina" (read "Vietnam") suggests that the North
 Vietnamese were reluctant to commit themselves to inter-
 national negotiations on the war in the South.   However,
 unlike the Chinese, they had not rejected it publicly.
 Hanoi's public position in February was noncommit-
 tal.  The new Soviet leadership was neither,: attacked nor
 directly supported in its effort to continue exploring
 the possibilities for convening a conference on Vietnam.
 The North Vietnamese attitude at the time seemed to be
 one of tacit acquiescence in the Soviet maneuvering.

 That Kosygin did not gain a clear-cut agreement to
 advocate an international conference is suggested-1-y--Two
 statements he made in: Hanoi following the 7 February at-
 tack on Pleiku.   (1)   He stated publicly that the Indochinese
 people's right to self-determination was "a basis...to
 normalize the situation in Southeast Asia," but did not
 declare that a conference would be the road to normaliza-
 tion.   (speech of 8 February)   (2)  He also stated publicly
 that unanimity of views had been reached with the North
 Vietnamese only on measures for strengthening "the defense
 potential of the DRV," while "frank talks" had taken
 place on many international problems.   (farewell speech
 of 10 February)   Failure to gain Hanoi's clear-cut con-
 currence is also suggested by the absence of any North
 Vietnamese comment, daring his visit, on the convening
 of a conference on Vietnam.   Further,  deputy foreign
 ministers Zorin and Lapin,  between 11 and 17 February,
 avoided replying to questions regarding Soviet su  or
 for a conference                                                  25X1
 On the other hand, that Kosygin had not been given
 a clear-cut rejection is suggested by Hanoi's subsequent
 pu  is  reatmen  rappeals for convening an international
 meeting.  Hanoi noted the French government statement of
 10 February which was paraphrased as declaring that "an
 international agreement must be signed" to eliminate inter-
 ference in Indochina,* Canadian Premier Pearson's statement
 of 10 February approving "the convening of ap international
 conference to peacefully solve the Indochina problem,"
 *On 10 February,     S promptly reported the French
 appeal and Indira Ghandi's call for a "14-nation con-
 ference on Indochina;"' on 16 February, Pravda publicized
 WPC President Bernal'scall for a conference; and on the
 17th,  a Pravda commentator noted French,-Canadian,  and
 Burmese proposals as well as the favorable attitude to-
 ward a political solution by certain "far-sighted" offi-
 cials in Washington.

 and the U Thant and Burmese statements declaring that the
 U.S. "must find a way other than the military one in South
 Vietnam." (Nhan Dan article of 14 February)
 This treatment suggests that at least some of the
 North Vietnamese leaders (i.e., the moderates) were will-
 ing to publicize the appeals of other governments for a
 conference following Kosygin's private proposal--certainly
 to Peking and probably to Hanoi--that there was a need
 to "find a way out of Vietnam" for the U.S.   That at least
 some of the North Vietnamese leaders acquiesced in Moscow's
 probes in a period of initial exploration is also suggested
 by the strong attack leveled at the British for opposing
 a conference.   Prime Minister Wilson was attacked because
 He was rash enough to say that the attacks
 against the DRV are unavoidable and the
 present moment is not yet convenient for
 the convening of a Geneva conference on
 Indochina,   (Nhan Dan article of 14 February)
 In short, the French,. Canadian, and Burmese proposals for
 a conference were implicitly favored while the British
 rejection was disparaged, Hanoi's. apparent intention being
 to sustain a degree of flexibility.
 By tolerating the probes of other governments, the
 North Vietnamese retained for themselves a degree of
 flexibility either to move toward an international con-
 ference (if the Russians could ever stimulate one) or
 away from a conference (if the Russians failed).   In
 either case, they would not appear anxious for negotia-
 tions,at"a time of increased American pressure--namely,
 the airstrikes against the North on 7, 8, and 11 February.
 The North,Vietnamese tactic of maintaining an ambiguous
 position probably was also designed to deflect Chinese
 Communist criticism,  inasmuch as they could later argue`
 that they had not explicitly agreed to Kosyg.n's proposal.
 That the Chinese in mid-February 1965 were uncertain
 and even distrustful of Hanoi's ambiguity is suggested
 by the statement of.the Chinese Communist editor of the
 Hong Kong Ta Kun  Pao.  When asked
 what Peking's attitude toward

 negotiations on Vietnam might be, he replied that Hanoi
 might be willing to engage in talks, but even if it were
 to do so, it could not speak for the Viet Cong.
 Hanoi's tacit acquielscence at the time apparently
 encouraged the Soviet leaders to propose, to Peking and
 Hanoi simultaneously, that a joint public appeal for an
 international conference should be made.  The Chinese
 later complained that following Kosygin's return to
 Moscow, the Soviet leaders.14behind the backs of Vietnam
 and China, actively engaged in international maneuvering
 for 'peace negotiations.'"  The Chinese did not support
 their charge that these machinations were undertaken with-
 out Hanoi's knowledge, and it is unlikely that the Soviet
 leaders would have continued to probe if Kosygin had been
 given a clear-cut "no" in Hanoi.  The Chinese complained
 that
 The most striking of all was the fact
 that on 16 February, the day after
 Comrade Kosygin's return to Moscow,
 the Soviet Government officially pro-
 posed to Vietnam and China to call for
 a new conference on Indochina, which
 in effect was tantamount to defending
 "unconditional negotiations" on the
 Vietnamese question.
 Upon Kosygin's return, the Soviet leaders may have decided
 to try to demonstrate to the North Vietnamese the detri-
 mental aspect of Chinese inflexibility on a matter requir-
 ing diplomatic maneuvering to help limit the degree of
 Washington's involvement in Vietnam.  They apparently
 believed that, at the very least, the whole matter of
 negotiations could create Peking-Hanoi tensions.  II

 plained privately in mid-March that "America" may try
 to "separate Peking from Hanoi with talk about confer-

 conference, but that it would' be unrealistic to convene
 one as desired by the Soviets, Indians, and Yugoslavs.

 This is the first known suggestion from a Chinese Communist
 source that the subject of an international conference
 could create Sino-Vietnamese differences.
 In the wake of American airstrikes (beginning on
 7 February), the Soviet leaders' room for political maneuver-
 ing was drastically reduced.  They were impelled to
 criticize Washington for air attacks on a bloc country
 while, at the same time, they were seeking some means for
 stimulating a desire among foreign governments for negotia-
 tions.  The two actions were incompatible.  Their private
 statements reflected their anger and frustration at being

 Hanoi's apparent equivocation probably reflected
 the North Vietnamese tactic of trying to secure a cessa-
 tion of U.S. airstrikes against the North by implying that
 the first precondition for any conference--which Hanoi
 did not rule out as a prospective development--must be
 an end to bombing.  The North Vietnaiiiese apparently found
 no reason to discourage Moscow's efforts to press Washing-
 ton to stop the airstrikes; they acquiesced, therefore,
 in Soviet maneuvers.   In the period between the time of
 the Soviet proposal to Hanoi and Peking that an appeal
 should be made for convening a conference on Vietnam (16
 February) and the time when the Chinese claim to have
 rejected the Soviet suggestion (27 February), Hanoi did
 not attack the concept'of an international conference
 or negotiations.
 The Chinese seem to have distorted the North Viet-
 namese policy of equivocation, of avoiding a flat "no"
 to Soviet efforts to eliminate airstrike cessation as a
 bargaining issue and to suggest that the airstrikes must
 be ended.   Although the Chinese later claimed that Hanoi
 had rejected the Soviet appeal of 16 February for a

 was a stronger word than the facts warranted.*  The
 anomalies are:

 to have rejected Moscow?s bid prior to

 E.   Peking Sustains Pressure on Hanoi Openly to
 Reject Negotiations (March 1966)
 Aware that the North Vietnamese accepted the idea
 of a conference in principle and concerned that the U. S.
 and USSR might move  ano1_    negotiate, the Chinese tried
 to impel Ho publicly to renounce negotiations.*  But
 Hanoi's equivocation had left the Soviets some (not much)
 leeway to try to deter the'U.S. from resuming the air-
 strikes against the North in late February.  When, on 26
 February, he tried to stimulate further  .nitiatives by
 other governments toward talks, Kosygin had spoken of a
 desire to solve the Indochina question "at a conference
 table" and went on to set forth a major precondition--e.g.,
 "An end to U.S. aggressive :act ions against the DRV is
 needed, first and foremost: to create conditions for the
 exploration of avenues leading to the normalization of
 the situation in Vietnam."   (An end to U.S. airstrikes
 against the North alone, rather than "first and foremost,"
 became the basic and only Soviet precondition for negotia-
 tions.)   Immunity from further U.S. strikes was precisely
 what Hanoi desired at the time, and the Chinese were alert
 nese concern was sustained by Secretary Rusk's state-
 ment that "political channels are open" and that "things
 could begin to move" if Viet Cong attacks were halted
 (25 February 1965) and Kosyygin's reference to a "normali-
 zation" of the situation (216 February 1965).

 to the Soviet effort simultaneously to end an embarrass-
 ment for Moscow and to ensure the sanctuary previously
 enjoyed by "socialist" North Vietnam.
 The Chinese rejection of the Soviet conference
 proposal on the 27th was followed by public (and probably
 private) hints to Hanoi that it should more directly,
 openly, and unequivocally attack the proposa  an  o#her
 negofIations _b_1 s  Tlie U. S. is trying "to gain at the
 negotiating table what it is unable to gain on the battle-
 field."   (Red Flag article of 27 February, broadcast in
 Vietnamese--an  oonly in Vietnamese--six times on 2 March)
 "We shall never succumb to the U.S. imperialists' bellicose
 blackmail.  No socialist country should."   (People's Daily
 editorial of 1 March)  These and subsequent CRiaese s a e-
 ments strongly suggested Chinese concern with Hanoi's
 position.  They point to the probability that the CCP
 claim of a North Vietnamese "rejection" of the Soviet
 conference proposal was a distortion.
 Two separate positions taken by Soviet-influenced
 Liberation Front officials, on the one hand, and a Chinese-
 influenced Liberation Front official, on the other hand,
 in early March point tin         '   distrust of North Viet-
 namese equivocation.                                                           the
 Chinese delegation at a preparatory meeting o     e   viet-
 oriented World Peace Council (WPC) held in Berlin in early
 March,  insisted that a WPC proposal declare that the U.S.
 must withdraw before negotiations could take place.   A
 marked difference was reported between the Chinese and
 Liberation Front delegates:  when the Chinese circulated
 a document attacking those who sought an accommodation
 with the U.S., the Front delegates did not support it.
 Unlike the Chinese, the Front delegates reportedly did
 not rule out the possibility of negotiations on some formula
 short of a complete prior U.S. withdrawal.   In Peking,
 however, the Chinese-influenced acting chief of the Front's
 permanent office, Nguyen Minh Phoung, directly attacked
 the idea of negotiations.  The Chinese insistence that
 the North Vietnamese openly attack the idea of interna-
 tional talks on Vietnam was suggested by different Peking
 and Hanoi treatment of the acting chief's press confer-
 ence of 8 March.   While NCNA (on 9 March) reported his

 statement that by advocating peaceful negotiations the
 U.S. was trying to "extricate" itself from failure in the
 South, VNA (also on the 9th) deleted this attack on negotia-
 tions from its version.   It is important to note that
 Peking, not Hanoi, took the initiative in making a state-
 ment on behalf of the Front, that it used the acting chief
 (in the absence of the chief of the permanent delegation
 to China), that it inaccurately depicted him as a South
 Vietnamese "leader," and that it publicized an attack
 on talks two days in advance of a formal Liberation Front
 central committee statement which avoided any reference
 to negotiations.  Peking's initiative at a time when the
 Front's central committee apparently was meeting (some-
 where in Vietnam) strongly suggests CCP interference in
 the affairs of the Hanoi-controlled front.*
 The North Vietnamese had tried to avoid an open
 and categorical rejection of international negotiations
 and, s mu  aneously, suggest to the Chinese that they
 would not be forced to negotiate or be misled by Moscow
 and Washington.   In their first substantive comment on
 the 2 March airstrikeslagainst the North, they stated
 that Vietnamese "will not be deceived" by President
 Johnson's alleged reference to talks and that the U.S.
 was wrong if it believed the strikes would lead to a
 "negotiated settlement."   (Nhan Dan editorial of 3 March)
 They followed up this commen ,-wIilch was partly intended
 to reassure Peking, by saying that "Nobody will be duped
 by the fallacious U.S. allegations" about a "measured
 expansion" and "trying to reach a negotiated settlement."
 nese were making an
 or  to establish "'a 'special relationship" with the
 Liberation Front.   Although the Chinese had not formally
 extended recognition to the Front, they nevertheless
 were treating the Front representative in Peking as if
 he were a duly accredited diplomat and, on ceremonial
 occasions, were ranking him for protocol purposes as
 an ambassador.

 they would not be duped.   For the first time in many
 months, they attacked "Tito" for his 2 March letter to
 President Johnson calling for negotiations without pre-
 conditions and then declared:
 There can be no question of negotiations
 with the U.S. imperialists when they
 openly declare and brazenly step up the
 aggressive war in South Vietnam and extend
 this war to North Vietnam.   (Nhan Dan
 article of 18 March)   (emphasis sup-
 plied)
 In attacking "Tito," the North Vietnamese were also im-
 plicitly rebuking the heads of state of the 17 non-aligned
 nations for their appeal of 15 March calling for negotia-
 tions without preconditions.*  This North Vietnamese

 formulation was remarkably ambivalent.   On the one hand,
 it differed from Soviet statements because it did not
 state that a halt toU.S. airstrikes was necessary to
 create conditions for negotiations,*  By failing to state
 precisely what was required before talks could begin,
 Hanoi avoided making a commitment to negotiate if air-
 strikes were to be suspended.   On the other hand,  it did
 not reject future negotiations and did not insist that
 a prior U.S. withdrawal was a precondition for talks.
 The Chinese apparently detected this ambivalence:   the
 entire formulation was omitted from Peking's version of
 the article as broadcast in Vietnamese on 20 March.
 In the wake of the 14-15 March airstrikes against
 the North, the Soviet leaders' loss of all room for maneu-
 vering was reflected in their actions and statements.  On
 15 March, they formally rejected London's proposal of 20
 February that Geneva conference countries be canvassed
 for their views on conditions for a peaceful settlement
 in Vietnam, and on the 16th, Gromyko,  in London, declared
 that the first step for the Geneva co-chairmen must be
 to denounce "U.S. aggression against Vietnam"--a clear

 F.             Liberation Front Insists on Withdrawal Before
 Negotiations (22 March 1965)
 By late March, the position taken by the Liberation
 Front on negotiations was even harder than Hai i?s tough-
 ened public stands  The reaction of the Front to the U.S
 airstrikes was the most dramatic of all Communist responses;
 it was formalized on 22 March by Front chairman Nguyen
 Huu Tho in a "five-point statement on the intensification
 and enlargement by the U.S." of the war in the South.
 The five points were,  in brief, a declaration of the Viet
 Cong's determination to prosecute the war without inter-
 ruption and for a long time.  They contained (1) a dis-
 torted review of U.S. policies toward Vietnam since 1954,
 (2) a reiteration of Viet Cong determination to fight on,
 the claim that the Viet Cong had taken three-fourths of
 the territory and controlled one-half of the population,
 the new hard position on negotiations, and the require-
 ment--sur ace  in  ecember      --hat the Front's "deci-
 sive voice" must be recognized before talks could take
 place,  (3) a commitment to "liberate" the South and
 unify the country, (4) a claim that the Front has the
 right to acquire outside aid,  including weapons and,  if
 necessary, foreign volunteers and southerners who had
 been regrouped in the North, and (5) an appeal to all
 southerners to unite and fight to win on all battlef ields0*
 Point 2 reflected the intransigent Chinese posi-
 tion on negotiations-,

 and as long as the Liberation Front--the

 have the decisive voice .   (emphasis

 This position went well beyond Hanoi's 18 March statement
 that negotiations were out of the question Wile the U.S.
 intensified the war in the South and against the North,
 inasmuch as it declared talks useless without (1) a prior
 U.S. withdrawal and (2) a decisive voice for the Front.
 It was strikingly similar to positions Peking had taken
 publicly and privately since December 1964.   In particular,
 it was similar to Liao Cteng-chih's 24 March statement
 that "negotiations" were' impossible without a prior with-
 drawal of U.S. troops.
 The Chinese, more than the North Vietnamese, acted
 quickly to exploit the Front's 22 March "five point" state-
 ment, stressing and quoting in its entirety the hard pas-
 sage on negotiations.   (People's Daily editorial of 25
 March).  Following President  o nson s 25 March statement,
 the Chinese again took the initiative and declared that
 "only" in the event of a ,withdrawal of U.S. troops could
 there be "any talk about a revival of the Geneva agree-
 ments and about a 'political settlement' on the basis
 of the agreements."*  (People's Daily Editorial of 29

 statement on the 23rd,  it did not initiate its own comment
 on it until 28 March,  at which time a Nhan Dan editorial
 praised it but avoided taking a stand for-or against
 negotiations.
 The question arises:   why was the Front statement
 significantly harder and more explicit on the matter of
 negotiations than the Nhan Dan editorial of 28 March?
 The reason may be Hanoi's desire to sustain the fiction
 of Front autonomy and to appear flexible in its own
 public stand.  This tactic permitted Hanoi to continue
 its game of convincing certain Western leaders and
 neutrals that Washington was the real recalcitrant on
 the. matter of international negotiations.
 Regarding the political status of the Front, Hanoi
 privately adopted the- and l nie of Peking and Front
 leaders, agreeing to interpose the Front as a negotiator.

 to be between the Liberation Front and the U.S. as the
 "parties directly involved."  By late March and early
 April, therefore, the North Vietnamese moved to upgrade
 the role of the Front as a legitimate negotiator in"any
 fu ure international talks on Vietnam.
 In effect, this move made negotiations even more
 remote,  inasmuch as Hanoi was clearly aware that Washing-
 ton would not accept the Front as the representative of
 the South.   The Chinese leaders worked actively to continue
 to make negotiations a  urel  hypothetical matter by inter-
 posing the Front.

 III.   HANOI FORMULATES VERBALLY ELASTIC POSITION BETWEEN
 THAT OF PEKING AND MOSCOW (April 1965 to September
 1966)
 A.   Hanoi Manipulates the Concept of Preconditions
 For Negotiations (April 1965)
 Responding to international pressure for neggt ia-
 tions, the North Vietnamese moved to formalize their posi-
 tion, fixing it in a mold of preconditions, which key
 leaders euphemistically called "points."  Ho Chi Minh
 personally set the mold in response to a question about
 "minimum conditions" for a solution.
 To settle the South Vietnam question,
 first of all the U.S. must withdraw
 from South Vietnam., let the South Viet-
 namese people decide their own affairs
 themselves, and stop their provocative
 attacks against the DRV.  The carrying
 out of these basic: points will Uring
 a Bout favorable conditions for a con-
 ference along the pattern of the 1954
 Geneva conference.  (emphasis sunolied)
 Clearly, this set forth a precondition, namely, that the
 U.S. must withdraw before; an international conference could
 be considered
 This was similar to the hard position set
 forth by Mao in January 1965 and reflected the stiffening
 which the North Vietnamese position had acquired since
 that time.
 But this formulation made Ho and his regime appear
 intransigent at a time when he was working to attract
 widespread international support for his effort against

 the South and the U.S. stand there.  The North Vietnamese
 apparently decided to introduce an element of flexibility,
 inasmuch as they believed it would be diplomatically
 stupid to insist on preconditions explicitly after the
 17 neutral nations (in early April  and  resident Johnson
 (on 7 April) had called for unconditional negotiations.
 Loosening the mold, Pham Van Dong,  in his speech of 8
 April, replying to President Johnson's address of 7 April,
 begged the entire question of explicit preconditions.
 That is, he was deliberately vague on the important
 matter of how and when negotiations could begin.   He
 declared that if the stand expounded in the four "points"
 is "recognized" as the basis for a solution, "favorable
 conditions will be created for peaceful settlement of
 the Vietnamese problem and it will be possible to consider
 reconvening an international conference on Vietnam."*
 This language was more tortured than Ho's and for good
 reason, as it was intended to conceal a contradiction.
 It was intended to provide the North Vietnamese with a
 pretext for arguing that, on the one hand, they had not
 established a U.S. withdrawal in fact as a precondition,
 while insisting that, on the other hand, before a confer-
 ence (or bilaterals) the U.S. must state publicly its
 pledge to withdraw (the time and procedure of withdrawal
 being a matter for the negotiations).
 After U.S. airstrikes against the North became a
 more permanent policy in April, the North Vietnamese had
 new evidence that Washington would not make a public
 statement, prior to a conference, agreeing to an eventual
 military departure.  They made it clear that they would
 engage in no talks before gaining such a U.S. public state-
 ment of surrender.  The exercise in flexibility, therefore,
 was primarily intended to shift the blame for opposing
 unconditional negotiations from Hanoi (the real recal-
 citrant) to Washington (the alleged recalcitrant) in the
 eyes of Western and neutral leaders.   Pham Van Dong

 personally tried to create the impression of sobriety and
 flexibility in talking to men whose goodwill was politi-
 cally important.
 The Chinese preferred Ho's formulation of 5 April
 --namely, that the U.S. must "carry out" a withdrawal--
 to Dong's formulation of8 April--namely, that the U.S.
 must publicly "recognize" the need to withdraw--prior to
 the possible convening of a conference on Vietnam.   Ho's

 tain a willingness to attend a conference in the future--
 that is, to accept the principle of a conference provided
 that the U.S. would publicly agree to retire (as the French
 had in 1954).  Accordingly, Chinese commentaries in April
 omitted, on occasion but'not always, the references which
 both Ho and Dong had made. to the possibility of a future
 conference on Vietnam, the implication being that Peking
 desired a total U.S. military defeat rather than a negotiated
 withdrawals some stage prior to such a defeat.   Chou

 his disagreement with Don g's formulation. 1                    -1

 Chou?s attacks on the idea of negotiations prior
 to withdrawal had capped a month of Chinese Communist
 maneuvering to sabotage any prospects for holding an in-
 ternational conference on Cambodia, at which a Vietnam
 settlement could be initially discussed.  The Chinese
 wrecking effort was important because the Soviet-inspired
 idea of such a conference was not attacked by Hanoi.   On
 3 April, Moscow had proposed a Cambodian conference and
 by 10 April Gromyko                                         25X1

 But Soviet enthusiasm began to wane in late April.
 The joint
 Soviet-French communique of 29 April merely noted the

 the problems of Indochina was said to be a return to the
 Geneva agreements of 1954 and 1962, which specified the
 "impermissibility of foreign interference" in the domestic
 affairs of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos.

 favorable answer to American peace initiatives would be
 forthcoming until Washington agreed to accept the Front
 as an equal "partner" in negotiations.  Finally, on 5 May,
 Hanoi made its first comment since the 17 April Soviet-
 Vietnamese communique on a Cambodian conference and in
 effect ruled out discussion on Vietnam at the conference.
 By late May 1965, the Soviets were reported as being
 completely disenchanted with the prospects of using the
 Cambodians as a vehicle for organizing a conference on

 Vietnamese (until Washington made a public pledge to with-

 C.         Moscow Reduced to Waiting for Initiative from
 Hanoi During May 1965 and January 1966 Air-
 Strike Suspensions
 1.   May 1965*
 Confronted by the hard $anoi position and the even
 harder Peking position, the Soviets were unwilling to
 press the North Vietnamese to moderate their stand, aware
 that if they did so they would be exposing themselves to
 an attack from the Chinese along the lines of "phoney"
 Soviet support.  The North Vietnamese did not discourage
 the Soviets in their line that cessation of airstrikes
 against the North was a-precondition for negotiations and
 they apparently acquiesced in the Soviet effort to create
 the impression that Hanoi might negotiate following a
 suspension.   However, the North Vietnamese did not commit
 themselves,nor did the'Russians commit them, to the
 proposition that cessation was the only precondition.
 Despite the remote prospect for negotiations if
 a suspension were to take place, the Chinese suspected
 that the Soviets had had tacit approval from:the North
 Vietnamese to press for suspension and indirectly criti-
 cized Hanoi for allowing Moscow leeway to press forward
 along this line.  Peking indirectly warned Hanoi and
 criticized Moscow as follows:   "To agree to enter into
 negotiations for a settlement of the Vietnam issue on the
 condition that the U.S. stops bombing North Vietnam is
 tantamount to admitting that the piratical bombing of
 the North is perfectly Justified and that the people in
 North Vietnam are totally wrong in supporting their fellow
 countrymen in the South...Would anyone with national self-

 such monstrously humiliating conditions?"   (People's
 Daily commentary of 12 May)   Hanoi implicitly  on 16 May)
 an explicitly (on 18 May) called the cessation a trick

 statement on the 18th repeated that the four "points"

 Despite hints that a suspension of airstrikes
 against the North might open the way for negotiations
 with Hanoi, the Soviet leaders, following the suspension
 of airstrikes in mid-May 1965, privately complained that
 their hands were tied.  That is, they were unwilling to
 argue with the North Vietnamese about the need for begin-
 ning discussions.  For example, just before the suspension
 started on 12 May 1965, politburo member Shelepin told
 several Western diplomats in Moscow that negotiations
 were impossible as long as U.S, airstrikes continued.
 But after Peking first and then Hanoi had denounced the
 suspension, the Soviet leaders indicated that they would
 not take the step of pressing for a favorable response
 from Hanoi at the cost of losing influence with the North
 Vietnamese.*  On 28 May, a Soviet United Nations official

 days" was insufficient for starting negotiations, and
 Premier Kosygin in late June responded with considerable

 North Vietnamese to do so. Kosygin argued that Moscow
 supported Hanoi's four "points" and that the U.S., there-
 fore, should withdraw, as there was nothing to negotiate.
 At about the same time,
 Moscow was im-
 pelled to wait for Peking or Hanoi to make the first move
 toward negotiations and that even if another country were
 to recommend a Geneva conference, the USSR would not sup-
 port it until the Chinese and North Vietnamese indicated
 a willingness to participate,
 e Soviets
 continued to indicate that they would not budge and,
 indeed, could not, budge the North Vietnamese from their
 position that a suspension of airstrikes was not the only
 precondition for negotiations,  inasmuch as the main one
 was the demand that Washington publicly declare a decision
 to withdraw.*  They insisted that they had no initiative.
 *The North Vietnamese indicated the crucial importance
 they assigned to an American pledge to withdraw.   "In order
 to strike back at the U.S. Government's words and actions,
 the Government of the DRV has already put forward its well-
 known four-point stand.  Of these, the first two are the
 most important.  The first /ithdrawai7 is a decisive
 point, but the second is also very important.  The U.S.
 imperialists think that only by carrying out the second
 point (making air raids against the North) they will be
 able to curb the revolutionary movement in the South..."

 Thus in late November, Gromyko told Senator Mansfield
 that the Russians "have not been authorized to negotiate.
 on this question"
 During and after the mid-May 1965 suspension of
 airstrikes, Hanoi continued to manipulate the concept of
 preconditions for negotiations to sustain an impression
 of reasonableness and, at the same time, demand a U.S.
 public pledge to withdraw.   As noted above, on 18 May
 the DRV representative in Paris had called for recogni-
 tion by Washington of the principles embodied in the
 four "points" apparently to counter the impression created
 by the suspension that the North Vietnamese were the real
 recalcitrants on the issue and to leave open the door to
 negotiations.   He had avoided using the word "precondi_
 tion"-a practice which marked Hanoi?s treatment of its
 position.   In late May, the DRV Foreign     ister refused
 to specify                                   whether the        25X1
 four "point911 were preconditions or ultimate goals for
 a final settlement after negotiations had started;  in late
 July  the DRV char g6 in Vientiane was reported to have
 told                                    that Washington was mis-
 interpre  ng one of Hanoi's con itions for negotiations
 because Hanoi was not masking withdrawal a "precondition"
 for negotiations, but rather a "commitment" for a pullout;
 in early September the Liberation Front re resentaive in
 Cambodia told                                        that Front       25X1

 A major consideration in Hanoi's effort to advance
 this line was to commit Washington to a statement of
 surrender without explicitly saying that such a statement
 in fact was tantamount to surrender.  Euphemistic language
 was used; the North Vietnamese demanded a "surrender" not
 in words, but in fact.  They called for Washington to
 "recognize" or "accept" the four "points" and, following
 the American inputs in July 1965, they more frequently
 than ever before demanded that Washington "carry out"
 or show by "actual deeds"' that it recognizes these points."
 For example, Ho himself :sidestepped a reporters' request

 that the "most correct solution" lay in implementation
 of the Geneva agreements and the "carrying out" by the

 Locked into this position
 of demanding a declaration of surrender, the North Viet-
 namese sustained their adamancy into December 1965, when
 I'n  i   with  anoi's private statements that the tim-
 ing of an American withdrawal could be the primary matter
 left for negotiations, the DRV Foreign Ministry's memoran-
 dum of its position (released on 23 September 1965) did
 not depict withdrawal as an immediate prerequisite.   (It
 did insist, however, that there cannot be "any negotia-
 tions" on the South Vietnam issue without the Liberation
 Front "having its decisive say.")

 a new and longer suspension, of airstrikes indicated that
 Washington was determined to increase pressure on Hanoi
 to make a concession--i.e., to agree to negotiate.   Hanoi
 was again provided with an opportunity to gain a permanent
 suspension and to demonstrate that complete conquest of
 the South was a goal that could be set aside and replaced
 by acceptance of a half-way station--i.e., consolidation
 of the North alone.
 2.  December 1965 to January 1966*
 The Soviet leaders continued to state privately
 that a suspension of airstrikes was necessary for any
 international negotiations, but were still not in a posi-
 tion to guarantee a positive response from the North Viet-
 namese.   When,  in mid-December 1965, Ambassador Dobrynin
 spoke with Harriman, he stated that Moscow believed the
 cessation of bombing for a long enough (not defined) period
 might lead to negotiations and implied that the Soviets
 would encourage the North Vietnamese.   Significantly, he
 avoided being specific about the precise action the Soviets
 would take and what made them believe that Hanoi would
 respond constructively.   Higher-level Soviet officials
 privately indicated that their hands were tied again--that
 is,  (just as in May 1965) that they would not apply pres-
 sure for negotiations on the North Vietnamese.  Thus 0
 Soviet deputy foreign minister Firyubin
 made     c ear                                               that
 the Soviet government wou     o nothing.   He sa             at
 Moscow had not been authorized by Hanoi to carry on any
 negotiations with the U.S.- and that the Soviet government
 would not do anything without the consent, agreement,
 and instructions of Hanoi.    He took a hard line on Wash-
 ington's 14-point proposal,.** saying that it was an
 _iFTfi-e secon  'a   trlkce suspension was maintained from
 24 December 1965 to 31 January 1966.

 "ultimatum."  Finally, he declared that "we have not
 received any response, reaction, or instructions from
 Vietnam yet."  Kos  in took an equally noncommittal line
 Ito indicate that Moscow had no desire
 to press the North Vietnamese, leaving that to Washington.
 He stated that Hanoi had to be satisfied that the U. S.
 genuinely desired peace and that for this to be accomplished,
 "the American authorities" should establish a direct line
 of communications with Hanoi.  That is, Kosygin had no
 real initiative in the matter, nor did his Soviet colleagues.
 TASS indirectly revealed this publicly when, in its 21
 January account of Japanese Foreign Minister Shiina's
 press conference, it noted that Shiina quoted Kosygin
 as having said that "theSoviet side naturally cannot
 'mediate' in any way in this conflict."
 The North Vietnamese responded to the suspension
 and the American 14-point proposal by raising a new and
 more precise stipulation'on airstrikes and a new public
 emphasis that Washington negotiate with the Liberation
 Front.   That is, they responded with greater admancy than
 in May 1965.
 Ho personally hardened the North Vietnamese posi-
 tion to a new degree of intransigence by demanding not
 only that Washington "recognize" the four "points" and
 "really prove it by concrete deeds," but, in addition,
 "completely end its bombings and all acts of war avainst
 the DRV."                                                         25X1
 This was the   rs  s gn that the North Vietnamese leaders
 were working out a harder position by adding a new detail
 and a new emphasis to Point One:   "The US government must
 completely and unconditionally end its bombings and all
 acts of war against   a TSB-"'--7u derrih ng medicates new
 phrase) As the North Vietnamese leaders deliberated during
 the bombing pause, they decided on yet another stipula-
 tion--namely, that the U.S. must negotiate with the Lib-
 eration Front.  The complete revised and hardened posi-
 tion was set forth in Ho's letter to heads of state of
 24 January 1966:

 If the U.S. really wants peace,  it must
 recognize the Liberation Front as the
 sole genuine representative of the people
 of South Vietnam and engage in negotia--
 tions with it.... If tae"-U.S  government
 really  inl's a peaceful settlement,  it

 DRV government and prove this by actual
 deeds; it must end unconditionally and

 This became the new basis, beyond the 8 April 1965 four
 points, for a final settlement.   However,  it did not rule
 out the start of negoo, aeons if the U.S. were to make
 a public declaraticin'-on'and actually begin one
 phase of that withdrawal process.
 By insisting on an "unconditional" suspension of
 airstrikes, the North Vietnamese clearly intended to
 extricate themselves from deep political embarrassment
 incurred during the December-January suspension and to
 neutralize this effective American political weapon by
 frantically insisting that bombing-cessation was not a
 bargaining  counter.

 "points" could lead to international discussion.   And
 publicly, a commentary in Quan Doi Nhan Dan of 19 July
 1966 stated that Hanoi would made na cconcessions" as
 the price for ending the airstrikes.
 While the North Vietnamese kept the door of negotia-
 tions open in the event that Washington at some future
 date would declare a willingness to withdraw, the Chinese
 tried to close the door and prevent such a future develop-
 ment.                             The Chinese were clearly pleased with Ho's letter
 to heads of state of 24 January 1966 indicating Hanoi's
 rejection of negotiations in the wake of the bombing sus-
 pension.  But they were alert to the fact that the North
 Vietnamese had not made actual withdrawal of U.S. forces
 a precondition for the- beginning of negotiations and that
 the Soviets would welcome an international conference.
 That a Geneva conference of the Geneva-agreement countries
 was always a political; possibility was a fact that con-
 stantly troubled the Chinese and when, on 7 July 1966,
 Prime Minister Ghandi proposed that the conference be re-
 convened, the Chinese again stressed troop withdrawal as
 a precondition.   Chou En-lai moved quickly to state that
 Mrs. Ghandi's proposal is designed to "sap the fighting
 will of the Vietnamese: people," adding that "unless
 American troops are withdrawn, the reconvening of the
 Geneva conference is entirely out of the question."
 (Speech at the Afro-Asian writers meeting on 9 July 1966)
 And when, on 16 July, the Soviet and Indian leaders
 declared in their joint communique in Moscow that air-
 strikes must be ended and that a solution could be found
 "only within the framework of the Geneva agreements,"
 the Chinese strongly emphasized their line on the in-
 validity of these agreements.  They "were long ago torn
 to shreds" by the U.S.   (People's Daily article of 18
 July).
 The Chinese blocking effort--that is, the move to
 close the door on any future negotiations regarding Viet-
 nam--was rationalized publicly as follows:
 The /16 July Soviet-Indian7 communique
 states that the; bombing o- the DRV should
 be stopped immediately and that the solu-
 tion of the problem of Vietnam can only

 be found within the framework of the 1954
 Geneva agreements on Indochina.   As every
 one knows, the core of the Vietnam ques-
 tion at present is absolutely not a matter
 of merely stopping the bombing of the DRV.
 To lay onesided stress on the stopping
 of bombing is precisely to cater to the
 needs of the US imperialist policy of
 blackmail.  The purpose of the American
 bombing of northern Vietnam is to make
 people beg it to show mercy, beg it to
 stop the bombing, and accept its terms
 for surrender.  One is trying to "force
 peace talks through bombing," while the
 other is saying that peace talks can be
 held once bombing is stopped.  This is
 a public performance of a duet with U.S.
 imperialism....
 It must be pointed out that U.S. imperial-
 ism long ago tore the Geneva agreements
 to shreds....In bombing northern Vietnam,
 moreover, the U.S. had completely broken
 the line of demarcation between southern
 and northern Vietnam.  Now the US bombing
 of the DRV capital spells the final burial
 of the Geneva agreements and the total
 liquidation of all the restrictions and
 limitations laid down in the Geneva agree-
 ments.   In these circumstances, whoever
 still attempts to use the Geneva agreements
 to tie the hands of the Vietnamese people,
 the Chinese people, and the revolutionary
 people of the world will never succeed.
 (Tao Chu speech of 22 July)
 That a future conference was the bone that stuck in the
 throat of the Chinese leaders was strongly suggested by
 the following statement:   "The Chinese people have always
 held that a conference table can never bring the oppressed
 nations.a. new world of independence and freedom."   (People's
 Daily editorial of 24 July)   (emphasis supplied)  By con-

 Geneva agreements as still valid and operative, leaving
 room for maneuvering toward a possible conference in the
 future.*  Ho's stress (letter to heads of state on 24
 January 1966) on the end of airstrikes was not duplicated

 initiative to sponsor negotiations for a settlement unless
 two conditions were fulfilled:   the "complete withdrawal"

 of the Front as the sole southern representative.   In
 this way, the Chinese leaders went beyond Hanoi's demand

 reflected further Chinese suspicion of Hanoi's attitude.**

 Hanoi Downgrades Prospect of Military, and

 (Fall 1965 to September 1966)
 The B-52 missions begun in mid-June 1965 and the
 U.S. inputs and participation in the fighting begun
 significantly in July 1965 apparently impelled the North
 Vietnamese to revise their contention (probably a genuine
 estimate) that they could win a military victory in the
 South.   In the fall of 1965, they began to speak more
 and more of political success

 1.  The Liberation Frontts Five Points
 The following are extracts from a statement issued
 by the Central Committee of the NFLSV on March 22, 1965:
 Facing the present situation of utmost gravity the
 NFLSV deems it necessary to reaffirm once again its iron-
 like and unswerving stand to carry through the war of
 resistance against the US imperialists.
 1.                                   The US imperialists are' the saboteurs
 of the Geneva Agreements, the most
 brazen warmonger and aggressor and
 the sworn enemy of the Vietnamese
 people.
 2.   The heroic South Vietnamese people are
 resolved to drive out the US imperial-
 ists in order to liberate South Vietnam,
 achieve an independent, democratic,
 peaceful and neutral South Vietnam,
 with a view to national reunification.
 (At present all negotiations are useless as long
 as the US imperialists do not withdraw all the troops,
 weapons and means of war of the US and its satellites
 from South Vietnam and destroy their military bases in
 South Vietnam; as long as the sacred rights of the South
 Vietnamese people--rights to independence and democracy--
 are still being sold by the Vietnamese traitors to the
 US imperialists; and as long as the NFLSV--true and only
 representative of 14 million South Vietnamese people--does
 not have the decisive voice.)
 3.   The valiant South Vietnamese people
 and the South Vietnam Liberation army
 are resolved to accomplish to the
 full their sacred duty to drive out the
 US imperialists so as to liberate
 South Vietnam and defend North Vietnam.

 4.   The South Vietnamese people express
 their profound gratitude for the whole-
 hearted support of the people of the
 world who cherish peace and justice
 and declare their readiness to receive
 all'atsistafice includin  weapons and
 all other; war materiels from their
 friends in the five continents.
 5.    To unite the whole people, to arm the
 whole people, continue to march forward
 heroically and be resolved to fight
 and defeat the US aggressors and the
 Vietnamese traitors.
 2.    North Vietnam's Four Points
 The following points were put forward by Prime
 Minister Pham Van Dong on April 8, 1965:
 It is the unswerving policy of the Government of
 the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) to strictly
 respect the 1954 Geneva Agreements of Vietnam, and to
 correctly implement their basic provisions as embodied
 in the following points:
 1.  Recognition of the basic national
 rights of the Vietnamese people:
 peace,  independence, sovereignty,
 unity and territorial integrity.
 According to the Geneva Agreements,
 the US Government must withdraw
 from South Vietnam all U  troops,
 military personnel and weapons of
 all kinds, dismantle all US military
 bases there, cancel its "military
 alliance" with South Vietnam.  It
 must end its policy of intervention
 and aggression in South Vietnam.
 According to the Geneva Agreements,
 the US Government must stop its acts

 Approv                                    9T00826AO0320001
 of war against North Vietnam, completely
 cease all encroachments on the terri-
 tory and sovereignty of the DRV.
 2.   Pending the peaceful reunification
 of Vietnam, while Vietnam is still
 temporarily divided into two zones,
 the military provisions for the
 1954 Geneva Agreements on Vietnam
 must be strictly respected:   the two
 zones must refrain from joining any
 military alliance with foreign coun-
 tries, there must be no foreign mili-
 tary bases, troops and military person-
 nel in their respective territory.
 3.   The internal affairs of South Vietnam
 must be settled by the South Vietnamese
 people themselves,  in accordance with
 the'programme of the NFLSV, without
 any foreign interference.
 4.   The peaceful reunification of Vietnam
 is to be settled by the Vietnamese
 people in both zones, without any
 foreign interference.
 This stand unquestionably enjoys the approval and
 support of all peace and justice-loving governments and
 peoples in the world.  The Government of the DRV is of
 the view that the above-expounded stand is the basis for
 the soundest political settlement of the Vietnam problem.
 If this basis is recognized, favourable conditions will
 be created for the peaceful settlement of the Vietnam
 problem,  and it will be possible to consider the reconven-
 ing of an international conference along the pattern of
 the 1954 Geneva Conference.  The Government of the DRV
 declares that any approach contrary to the above stand
 is inappropriate; any approach tending to secure a UN
 intervention in the Vietnam situation is also inappropriate
 because such approaches are basically at variance with
 the 1954 Geneva Agreements on Vietnam.

 3.    United States' 14' Points
 The following points, made by Vice-President Humphrey
 in the White House on January 3, 1966, were released by
 the State Department on January 7:
 The following statements are on the public record
 about elements which the US believes can go into peace
 in South East-Asia.
 1.  The Geneva:Agreements of 1954 and 1962
 are an adequate basis for peace in
 South-East Asia;
 2.  We would welcome a conference on South-
 East Asia or on any part thereof;
 3.  We would welcome "negotiations without
 preconditions" as the 17 non-aligned
 nations put it ;
 25XI
 4.  We would welcome unconditional discus-
 sions as President Johnson put it;
 5.  A cessation of hostilities could be
 the first order of business at a
 conference or could be the subject of
 preliminary discussions.
 6.  Hanoi's Four Points could be discussed
 along with other points which others
 might wish ;to propose;
 7.  We want no US bases in South-East Asia;
 8.  We do not desire to retain US troops in
 South Vietnam after peace is assured;
 9.  We support free elections in South Vietnam
 to give the South Vietnamese a govern-
 ment of their own choice;

 10.    The question of reunification of Vietnam
 should be determined by the Vietnamese
 through their own free decision;
 11.    The countries of South-East Asia can
 be non-aligned or neutral if that
 be their option;
 12.    We would much prefer to use our re-
 sources for the economic reconstruc-
 tion of South-East Asia than in war.
 If there is peace, North Vietnam
 could participate in a regional effort
 to which we would be prepared to
 contribute at least one billion dollars;
 13.   The President has said "The Vietcong
 would not have difficulty being
 represented and having their views
 represented if for a moment Hanoi
 decided she wanted to cease aggres-
 sion.   I don?t think that would be
 an insurmountable problem."
 14.   We have said publicly and privately
 that we could stop the bombing of
 North Vietnam as a step toward peace
 although there has not been the slight-
 est hint or suggestion from the other
 side as to what they would do if the
 bombing stopped.
 in other words, we have put everything into the
 basket of peace except the surrender of South Vietnam.
 4.  Ho Chi Minh's Letter of 24 January 1966 to Heads of
 States (Excerpt)
 If the United States really wants peace,  it
 must recognize the NFLSV as the sole genuine
 representative of the people of South Vietnam

 and engage in:negotiations with it....
 So long as the U.S. army of aggression
 still remains on our soil, our people
 will resolutely fight against it.   If
 the U.S. government really wants a peace-
 ful settlement, it must accept the
 four-point stand of the DRY government
 and prove this by actual deeds;  it must
 end unconditionally and for good all
 bombing raids and other war acts against
 the DRV.   Only in this way can a political
 solution to the Vietnam problem be
 envisaged.
