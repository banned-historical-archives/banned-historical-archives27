PERSIAN GULF: Situation Report 
Iran Plans Anti-US The Iranian Government is organizing massive anti-US 
Demonstrations demonstrations for tomorrow, the eighth anniversary of the seizure of 
the US Embassy in Tehran. Iranian Embassies reportedly are trying to 
organize demonstrations and propaganda campaigns protesting the  
US attacks on Iranian ships in the Persian Gulf.

The Gulf was quiet 25X1

Comment: It is not clear that Tehran has any specific plans for 
violence tomorrow but the demonstrations provide a potential cover 
for anti-US acts. There is no known link between the reported Iranian 
approach to Pakistani Shias and the planned demonstrations 
tomorrow. 
Beijing Denies US China refuted recent US statements accusing Beijing of continued 
Arms Sales Charges arms sales to Tehran in a radiobroadcast to Iran last Friday. The 
Farsi-language broadcast charged Washington with "turning the 
sharp edge of its sword" on Beijing and trying to sow discord 
between China and the Persian Gulf states in order to shift blame for 
Gulf tensions onto Beijing. Beijing described the US charges as 
complete fabrications and argued that any country can find channels 
to purchase arms for a price. 
Liberia Requests 
Tanker Protection 
Comment: This broadcast is China's first public reaction to stories 
that appeared in the US press last week on Chinese arms sales to 
Iran. It was strongly worded but carried no threat of retaliation for the 
US decision to postpone consideration of liberalization of COCOM 
restrictions on China. By limiting its response to a broadcast to Iran, 
Beijing probably hopes to avoid fueling the debate with Washington 
over the arms sales issue while reassurin7 Tehran that China is not 
bending to US pressure. 
Liberia on 30 October requested US protection for Liberian-flagged 
tankers sailing the Persian Gulf, according to the US Embassy.

"unprovoked attacks" and because some are US-owned they should 
be eligible for protection. 
Comment: This is Liberia's second request for protection in the Gulf. 
Of the 22 Liberian-flagged ships attacked in the Gulf this year, five are 
US-owned, including the Sungari, which was hit on 15 October by a 
Silkworm missile while docked at Kuwait's Sea Isle Terminal. Of the 
rest, six are Japanese owned, five British owned, and the remainder 
are owned by companies located in Norway, Austria, South Korea, 
and Bermuda. Ship attacks against Liberian-flagged ships represent 
about 14 percent of the total ship attacks this year.

Gorbachev Speaks Out on Soviet History 
On Forced Industrialization: 
In a single burst industrialization brought the country to a qualitatively new level.... Could a 
course have been chosen in those conditions other than that put forward by the party? ... No, 
it could not. At the same time the period also brought losses ... people were being persuaded 
of the universal effectiveness of strict centralization ... bureaucracy increased, a danger that 
Lenin warned about. 
On Collectivization: 
In that immense operation, a deviation from Leninist policy was committed.... It was carried 
out by administrative methods... and gross violations acquired a ubiquitous character. But, 
comrades, if we are to assess the importance of collectivization, overall, then in the final 
analysis it was a turning point of fundamental importance. 
On Stalin and the Purges: 
Many thousands were subjected to mass repressions.... We must see both Stalin's 
indisputable contribution ... and the gross political errors and arbitrariness permitted.... 
Sometimes it is said that Stalin did not know about the instances of lawlessness. Documents 
in our possession say that this is not so. The guilt of Stalin and those closest to him is 
immense and unpardonable. 
On Khrushchev: 
It required no little courage to criticize the cult of personality and its consequences and to 
restore socialist legality.... Attempts were made to overcome the bureaucratic methods of 
management based on command.... However, subjectivist errors were committed which 
hampered socialism's emergence ... and compromised progressive undertakings. 
On Brezhnev: 
During his latter years, the search for the way to achieve further progress was to a great 
extent held back by an adherence to customary formulas.... There was a buildup of negative 
process ... a precrisis situation was created.

USSR: Setback for Reformers 
The cautious approach to controversial historical questions that 
Soviet leader Gorbachev took in his speech yesterday marking 
the 70th anniversary of the Bolshevik Revolution apparently 
reflects the continuing precarious balance between reformers 
and conservatives in the leadership. Together with the political 
setback suffered by Moscow party leader Boris Yel'tsin, a close 
Gorbachev ally and strong advocate of reform, the speech 
indicates that conservatives led by "Second Secretary" Ligachev 
have succeeded at least temporarily in setting limits on the 
reform agenda. 
Gorbachev did not question the legitimacy of the main lines of policy 
under Stalin, although he did sharply criticize excess in carrying out 
these policies. Gorbachev endorsed Stalin's decision to curtail 
Lenin's New Economic Policy, which he assessed as appropriate for 
its time, in favor of rapid industrialization and collectivization of 
agriculture, claiming that there was no other way. He failed to make 
dramatic changes in the official evaluation of Stalin's most notable 
victims?Bukharin, Trotskiy, Zinoviev, and Kamenev. 
Comment: Gorbachev's speech does not provide the kind of 
historical and ideological framework that would legitimize frontal 
attacks on the political and economic system that Stalin created. One 
Soviet official noted that the speech represented the line of the 
Central Committee, not of Gorbachev, or even the Politburo. 
Gorbachev did go beyond Khrushchev's criticisms of Stalin in some 
respects. He charged Stalin with committing a "deviation" from 
Leninist principles by carrying the attack on "rich" peasants under 
collectivization so far that many ordinary peasants suffered as well. 
Moreover, Gorbachev emphasized repeatedly that even though 
many aspects of the Stalinist system were necessary under the 
circumstances of the time, it was a mistake to universalize 
now-inappropriate past social models in an attempt to deal with 
needs and demands of the country today. 
The reassessment of party history will apparently continue, giving 
reform advocates an opportunity to push for more thorough revisions 
of historical interpretations and rehabilitation of Stalin's victims. 
Gorbachev announced that the Politburo has mandated a review of 
Stalin's purge victims by a special commission and that another 
commission is drafting an outline of party history. Following the 
anniversary celebrations, party secretary and Politburo member 
Aleksandr Yakovlev, the most outspoken radical member of the 
leadership on historical questions, reportedly will attend a conference 
of historians and ideologists at the Marxism-Leninism Institute that is 
ex ected to debate'rose - ? revisions in the official party history.

MOZAMBIQUE: Mounting Civilian Casualties 
The most recent attack on a Mozambican convoy last week 
appears to be part of a RENAMO strategy in southern 
Mozambique and eastern Zimbabwe to disrupt transport links, 
create a climate of insecurity, and punish Maputo's military 
allies. 
Initial press and US Embassy reporting indicates that the insurgents 
attacked a military convoy escorting civilian vehicles on the country's 
main north-south highway about 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of 
Maputo. The US Ambassador, who visited the site, reported that 
about 80 vehicles had been destroyed and at least 200 civilians had 
been killed, either directly by RENAMO or in an ensuing firefight 
between the insurgents and government troops. RENAMO has 
acknowledged the attack but claims it was a purely military 
engagement. Earlier this month, a similar ambush on the same road 
resulted in the deaths of approximately 50 civilians, according to 
Embassy and press reports. 
Insurgent operations also have taken a heavy toll on Zimbabwean 
civilians since RENAMO began staging raids into easternZimbabwe 
last June, ro bolster 
border security, Harare is planning to add two new brigades to its 
47,000-man Army, Tanzania, 
Mozambique's other major military ally, recently decided to establish 
a quick-reaction force in order to respond to RENAMO operations 
close to its border, 
Comment: Violence by both parties against civilians has long been a 
part of the 11-year-old insurgency, but the most recent wave of 
civilian casualties coincides with an intensification of rebel operations 
in southern Mozambique, where RENAMO enjoys relatively little 
popular support and is likely to show less restraint. In addition, rebel 
military objectives, which include disrupting transport in the south, 
probably contribute to the rising toll of civilian casualties. 
Although Zimbabwe feels compelled to expand its Army because of 
the RENAMO threat, neither Harare nor Dar es Salaam can easily 
afford a major buildup of forces. Moreover, an increase in troop 
strength alone is not likely to improve their ability enough to protect 
civilians from RENAMO cross-border attacks

USSR-CHINA: Trying To Exploit Sino-US Tensions 
Soviet media have been defending China's positions on key issues 
of Sino-US contention as part of the USSR's effort to court Beijing. 
A Soviet radiobroadcast in Chinese last week denounced US 
"interference" in Chinese internal affairs, citing the US Senate's 
recent stand on Tibet. TASS in English on Monday reported a 
Chinese media commentary accusing the US of "groundlessly" 
threatening China for selling arms to Iran in order to deflect criticism 
of US involvement in the Persian Gulf. The Soviet party also sent 
greetings this week to the Chinese Party Congress for the first time 
since 1956. 
Comment: Moscow is trying to take advantage of current tensions in 
Sino-US relations?in much the same way as it has long tried to 
exploit US arms sales to Taiwan?by presenting the US as interfering 
in internal Asian affairs and by playing up Sino-Soviet convergence 
on issues such as disarmament, economic restructuring, and 
nuclear-free zones?including space. China has not responded to the 
USSR's media overtures and will not allow the Soviets to influence its 
relations with the US. 
CHINA: Foreign Exchange Reserves Up 
China's foreign exchange holdings reached $14 billion in September, 
more than $4 billion above January's record low, according to  
official Chinese statistics. 
Comment: Improved trade performance?exports were up 
24 percent and imports down 4 percent?has reduced China's trade 
deficit during the first nine months of the year to $2.7 billion, as 
compared with $9 billion for the same period in 1986. Trade resulted 
in a net increase in foreign reserves, however, if imports that did not 
require payment in foreign exchange are excluded. In addition, 
Beijing has probably earned additional foreign exchange from gold  
sales.

FRANCE: New Armed Forces Chief 
President Mitterrand's appointment of new armed forces and army 
chiefs will help the continuing development of French-US military 
relations. General Maurice Schmitt, current Army chief, will replace 
retiring Armed Forces chief General Jean Saulnier this month. 
General Secretariat for National Defense director General Gilbert 
Forray?Mitterrand's former military adviser and the organizer of 
France's Rapid Action Force?will replace Schmitt as Army head. 
Comment: Schmitt was in line for the promotion and is considered 
professionally well-rounded and a soldier's soldier. Forray's 
promotion, however, is a surprise, because he had served only three 
months at the General Secretariat?the Defense Ministry's analytical 
and coordinating body. Both men are well disposed toward the US 
and strongly committed to cooperating with NATO.

LEBANON-ISRAEL: Amal-Israeli Accord 
Shia Amal leader Nabih Barri has agreed to halt all attacks against 
Israel in return for a withdrawal of Israeli troops from several locations 
in southern Lebanon. key 
members of Amal's southern leadership are charged with enforcino  
the ban and arresting Amal and Hizballah violators. 
Comment: The agreement is probably intended to reduce immediate 
tensions between Israel and Amal, but it does not presage a total 
Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon. Amal's internal 
fragmentation, Israel's continuing occupation, and the growing 
Hizballah presence in the region undercut Barn's ability to guarantee 
security along the border with Israel. And without significant 
improvement in Amal's position?which is not likely?Israel will 
continue to keep a small military presence in southern Lebanon and 
to support its surrogate force, the Army of South Lebanon led by 
General Lahad. In response to the Amal-Israeli agreement, the PLO 
may shift several positions so that it can attack Israel without Amal 
interference.

ROMANIA: President's Son Appointed Governor 
President Ceausescu's youngest son Nicu, formerly head of the 
Communist youth organization, has been named First Secretary of 
one of Romania's 40 counties, according to press reports. He 
apparently remains a nonvoting candidate member of the Central 
Committee's Political Executive Committee. Many Romanians believe 
that Nicu, despite his reputation as a playboy, is being groomed to 
succeed his father. 
Comment: Nicu Ceausescu's new position probably is intended 
to give him administrative experience before he moves to a 
more important post in Bucharest. Although the President and 
his ambitious wife are intent on giving their 36-year-old son a 
high-ranking government sinecure at the very least, his evident lack of 
ability and his unpopularity within the party probably rule him out as a 
serious candidate for succession. The President's wife, however, 
probably hopes to prepare Nicu for a major government position 
should she manage to succeed her husband. 
SPAIN-FRANCE: ETA Counterfeiting 
In recent operations against members of the Basque extremist group 
ETA living in southern France near the Spanish border, French police 
seized $9.6 million in bogus US $100 notes and 60 printing plates and 
arrested two ETA suspects. Information obtained as a result of the 
arrests indicates that the Spanish Basque provinces may be 
inundated with counterfeit US bills. Police also found plates for 
producing local French Government stamps and false Spanish and 
French national identity cards. 
Comment: The apparent size of the counterfeiting activity and the 
ETA's technical expertise suggest a sophisticated operation. The 
counterfeiting scheme may support the high priority ETA has recently 
given to sabotaging the Spanish economy. ETA may also have turned 
to counterfeiting to make up a loss of extortion-derived revenues. The 
amount of counterfeit currency seized and the large number of 
printing plates indicate ETA may also be supplying other groups 
involved in counterfeiting.

CHINA: New Leaders Facing Old Problems 
Deng Xiaoping and his reformist allies gained much of what they 
wanted at the recent party congress and Central Committee 
Plenum. However, apparent compromises with orthodox party 
members and failure to resolve nettlesome questions may dilute 
Deng's apparent gains. The Politburo Standing Committee is 
evenly split between the party's reformist and orthodox wings, 
and the selection of a new premier remains at an impasse. 
Moreover, the reformers must still convert their gains into 
concrete policy?historically a more difficult task. 
The 13th National Party Congress that closed Sunday marked a 
symbolic changing of the guard, as Deng led the Long March 
generation off the Central Committee and into retirement. Deng, 
nevertheless, will remain an active player?in deference to his 
prestige and wisdom, according to a party press spokesman?and 
will continue as chairman of the party Military Commission. Many of 
Deng's more prominent rivals also will have a potentially powerful 
base in the party's Advisory Commission, where they can continue to 
score the shortcomings of China's reforms. 
The congress endorsed Premier Zhao's work report, which, while 
underscoring several pet concerns of orthodox party leaders, was 
strikingly straightforward and free of ideology. In principle, the 
congress sanctioned some of the most controversial reform 
experiments?private ownership, the sale of stock and payment of 
dividends, and the leasing of land. Zhao proposed, and the congress 
also accepted by its changes to the party constitution, the separation 
of party affairs from government and economic work  in the interest of 
greater efficiency and productivity. 
The Politburo named at yesterday's Central Committee Plenum has 
17 members?three less than its predecessor?and a strong plurality 
in favor of Deng's reform program. There are 10 holdovers, and the 
seven additions are seasoned national or provincial leaders. The 
former General Secretary, Hu Yaobang, stayed on?a rebuff to the 
traditionalists who forced his ouster in January.

Unanswered Questions 
Deng's reluctance to exit the political stage completely indicates his 
continuing concern with the fragility of his reforms, personnel 
arrangements, and his inability to install a younger leader as chairman 
of the Military Commission. The plenum named Zhao as First Vice 
Chairman of the Commission, almost certainly to pave the way for the 
reunification of the top party and military positions for the first time 
since 1981. It is not clear whether Zhao has a broad enough 
constituency within the military to sustain a bid for the post. 
The five-man Politburo Standing Committee, whose members on 
average are 14 years younger than their predecessors, poses a 
problem for reformers. Zhao appears to have only one unequivocal 
ally?Hu Yaobang's protege Hu QiIi?against traditionalist-leaning 
Vice Premiers Li Peng and Yao Yilin. Vice Premier Qiao Shi, who has 
ties to both camps, probably will be a swing vote on controversial 
decisions. 
Zhao stays on as Premier but, according to the Chinese press, has 
asked for a National People's Congress Standing Committee session 
later this year to name an acting premier. The premier traditionally 
has been a Politburo Standing Committee member, and Li Peng, the 
preferred candidate of the orthodox wing, seems well positioned for 
the job. Should Li get the nod, he and Zhao will have to work out the 
balance of power between the Politburo and the State Council under 
a new and ambiguous mandate to separate party and government 
work. Contention is likely should Li seek to impose a more orthodox 
25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
stamp on the State Council, its staff, and the reform program. 25X1 
Outlook 
Zhao's work report provides an ambitious reform agenda but is short 
on specifics of implementation. The need to sort out new political 
relationships and continuing economic problems?stagnating grain 
production, a widening budget deficit, industrial waste and 
inefficiency, and strong inflationary pressures fueled by excessive and 
often wasteful capital construction?indicate the reformers probably 
will not be able to MOVA aead very aggressively with their program.

ETHIOPIA: Facing Famine 
Ethiopia is threatened again by widespread famine. Although the 
government has contributed to initial relief efforts, its resources 
are severely limited. Prospects for averting a food crisis like that 
during 1984-85 are uncertain as donors' budgetary constraints, 
transportation shortages, and security problems increase. 
A food crisis as severe as that two years ago threatens to engulf 
Ethiopia as early as January. In September the government issued a 
preliminary request for 950,000 tons of emergency food for drought-
stricken areas. Continuing poor rainfall, however, has dashed hopes 
for substantial crop recovery, and harvest projections for next month 
in both affected and adjacent areas are bleak. The US Embassy 
reports that some 1.2 million tons of relief food might be required?as 
much as at the height of the previous famine. 
Getting food to people in their home districts before they migrate to 
cities, feeding camps, or across international borders again will be 
key to managing the crisis. Logistic problems are already appearing, 
however. A recent UN transport assessment warns of ill-equipped 
ports and truck shortages, particularly in the north, and Addis Ababa 
has balked at donor suggestions that it move 200 trucks there from 
the south, according to diplomatic reporting. The destruction by 
rebels of 23 trucks in a UN relief convoy in Eritrea late last month will 
aggravate the problem. 
The Government's Stance 
In contrast with its attempt to cover up the famine in 1984, the regime 
has clearly indicated it intends to deal openly and cooperate in relief 
efforts, according to diplomatic reporting. Early in August the 
government acknowledged that the drought had deepened and 
appealed for international aid. It pledged 50,000 tons of grain for 
relief feeding, bought another 100,000 tons on the international 
market, and?for the first time?sent officials into the countryside to 
appraise the crisis. 
Despite these moves, donors will be wary of abuses similar to those 
that occurred during the previous famine, when the regime 
involuntarily resettled hundreds of thousands of peasant farmers from 
depleted lands in the north to virgin lands in the south and west. The 
resettlement caused scores of deaths and diverted government 
resources from the relief effort. The regime halted the program in

October 1985 following international protests, but President Mengistu 
recently emphasized that resettlement remains key to his 
development strateqy and hinted at its resumption, according to the 
Embassy. 
Western donors and international organizations also await regime 
action on agricultural reforms. The EC and World Bank have 
proposed reforms to improve Ethiopia's agricultural pricing and 
marketing structures and to strengthen private markets, but Addis 
Ababa has stalled for three years; Western donors believe the delay 
has slowed the recovery and development of the rural sector. 
Although Ethiopia recently drafted reform plans along the lines 
suggested by the World Bank, there is no indication of whether or  
how they will be implemented, according to the Embassy. 
25X1 
25X1 
25X1 
Ethiopia's overall economic malaise severely limits its ability to pay 
for increased food imports. Rising debt-service payments and lower 
world prices for coffee, its main export, are draining reserves. As in 
1984-85, however, the government probably will maintain the flow of 
food to the armed forces and urban population in recognition of their 
importance to regime stability and the counterinsurgency effort. 
Other Stumblingblocks 
The unprecedented attack on the unescorted UN relief convoy 
portends growing security problems for the aid effort in two of the 
hardest hit provinces, Eritrea and Tigray.  
 The UN's refusal to meet rebel demands for 
advance notification of relief convoys and its reluctance to request 
government military escorts illustrate the donors' dilemma. Both of 
these steps would slow the delivery of food aid and risk politicizing 
relief operations, without reducing the threat to future convoys. Other 
options, such as airlifting food, would impose higher costs at a time of 
growing budgetary constraints. 
In 1988, unlike 1984-85, budgetary problems among donor countries 
are likely to seriously constrain relief efforts. Aid funds are being cut 
in most Western countries, and some donors have expressed concern 
about embarking on another protracted and costly relief program in 
Ethiopia, according to the Embassy. At the same time, humanitarian 
organizations, which implement most of the relief work in the field, 
also have reduced funding and are turning to the bilateral donors to 
make up the deficit.

Special Analysis 
KUWAIT: Oil Export Strategies 
Iran's Silkworm attacks on Kuwait's Sea Island oil-loading facility 
highlight the vulnerability of both the country's oil facilities and 
the tankers loading in Kuwaiti waters. Kuwait's diversification of 
its export system, along with its large foreign financial reserves 
and the steps Kuwait has taken to protect its oil exports reduce 
the economic impact of the limited Iranian attacks. 
Kuwait has greatly increased the use of oil shuttle operations in 
response to Iranian ship attacks. Nearly 80 percent of Kuwaiti crude 
exports?about 1.5 million barrels per day in September?are 
shuttled to Khawr Fakkan, well above the 20 percent earlier this year. 
Most petroleum products are shipped directly from Kuwait to their 
destinations. 
Use of Foreign-Flagged Ships 
Foreign flag tankers constitute the majority of the crude oil shuttle 
fleet. The Kuwait Oil Tanker Company primarily uses UK- and 
Liberian-flagged supertankers,. . The 
_  _ 
temporary loss of the US-ref lagged Bridgeton, damaged by an Iranian 
mine in July, had no impact  on Kuwaiti crude exports because of the 
availability of other tankers. 
The regime plans to increase product exports early next year from 
500,000 b/d to more than 600,000 b/d. US-reflagged tankers carry 
about 100,000 b/d, and Soviet-flagged chartered tankers carry 
another 30,000 b/d. Nearly 70 percent of Kuwait's liquefied petroleum 
gas exports of about 70,000 b/d are carried by US-ref lagged tankers. 
Options To Increase Protection 
If unescorted tankers stop loading at Kuwait, the Kuwait Oil Tanker 
Company could maintain almost all of its crude and product exports 
by using US- or UK-flagged tankers in a shuttle operation to Khawr 
Fakkan. The Bridgeton, along with several UK-reflagged or chartered 
supertankers, could deliver more than 600,000 b/d of crude to Khawr 
Fakkan. In addition, the Kuwait Oil Tanker Company could add the 
Maryland?a chartered, US-flagged supertanker.

Too Secret 
An expanded shuttle system is technically feasible but would create 
logistic problems if Kuwaiti production continues at current high 
levels. Loading delays associated with increased use of the North and 
South Piers would increase costs and put more tankers at risk from 
Silkworm missiles. Kuwait can continue to export up to 1 million b/d 
of crude oil from the North Pier facility, although draft restrictions  
there limit each tanker cargo to 250,000 tons or less. 
Kuwait is considering building an export pipeline to the Red Sea to 
increase the security of its oil exports. Government officials, however, 
have been reluctant to make a firm decision because of the cost. 
Construction would take at least two years and probably could not 
begin until late 1988. 
Outlook 
Kuwait's oil export facilities and refineries will continue to be 
vulnerable to Iranian missile attacks or sabotage. More than 
30 percent of Kuwait's population is Shia, many with strong ties to 
Tehran. Iranian-backed Kuwaiti Shias planted bombs at domestic oil 
facilities three times this year. So far, Kuwait has been the target of at 
least eight Silkworm missiles, and continued successful missile 
attacks on tankers and key facilities may limit Kuwaiti exports. 
Moreover, Tehran's unsuccessful attack on the Ra's al Khafji export 
facilities emphasizes Iranian resolve to strike Kuwaiti interests using a 
variety of tactics. 
Nonetheless, even the temporary loss of Kuwait's Sea Island export 
facility will not severely disable the country's export operations or the 
economy. The duplication built into Kuwait's export system reduces 
the likelihood of a complete disruption of exports. Other than shifting 
crude oil loading operations to its North Pier terminal, Kuwait is 
reactivating a single-mooring export buoy near the Sea Island with a 
capacity of about 500,000 b/d. Kuwait's three product export 
refineries have separate loading terminals. 
The regime has sufficient financial reserves to meet domestic 
expenditures and repair costs. Kuwait can also limit revenue loss by 
using alternate oil export facilities. In recent years investment income 
has surpassed oil export receipts as the primary source of 
government revenues.
