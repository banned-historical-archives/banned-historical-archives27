 China Emphasizes Moderation;
 Leadership Differences Remain
 F7              I
 The personnel appointments and policy statements
 approved by China's Fourth National People's Con-
 gress are clearly designed to stress moderation and
 continuity. The brevity of the congress, the first
 in a decade, and the initial secrecy in which it
 was held suggest, however, that leadership differ-
 ences have not yet been ironed out fully.
 The reappointment of Chou En-lai as premier,
 and the naming of his close ally, Yeh Chien-ying,
 to the sensitive post of defense minister, under-
 scores Chou's continuing power and prestige as a
 senior policy maker.
 Teng Hsiao-ping, elevated to the Politburo
 standing committee and named a vice chairman by the
 Central Committee plenum, which preceded the con-
 gress, appears to be Chou's logical successor.
 Chairman Mao Tse-tung, who attended neither
 the plenum nor the congress, has now been away from
 Peking for over six months.   Only once before has
 Mao been absent from the capital for a longer time,
 and that was immediately before the onset of the Cul-
 tural Revolution when, Mao complained later, he was
 being circumvented and ignored by political oppo-
 nents.

 If Mao has remained. in the countryside as a
 political gesture, it is likely that he is "sulk-
 ing in his tent" and has not been deliberately ex-
 cluded from the capital.
 The communique issued at the conclusion of
 the congress makes relatively little mention of Mao
 personally.   The guiding role of "Mao Tse-tung
 Thought," however, was written into the new consti-
 tution and the chairman of the party was designated
 commander of the armed forces.
 All of this suggests that the Chairman is still
 a very active force in Chinese politics.
 The congress approved a. list of 12 vice pre-
 miers, down from 15 before the Cultural Revolution.
 Teng Hsiao-ping heads the list, followed by Shang-
 hai party boss Chang Chun-chiao, who gave the re-
 port on the revision of the state constitution on
 behalf of the party Central Committee.  This assign-
 ment is another indication that Chang is acting in
 the post of party secretary general, although he has
 never been publicly identified in that role.
 Youthful party vice chairman Wang Hung-wen,
 who had given the report on the revision of the

 party constitution on behalf of the Central Commit-
 tee at the Tenth Party Congress in August 1973, did
 not gain a government post.
 Only a single military figure, Peking Military
 Region Commander Chen Hsi-lien, was included in the
 list of vice premiers.  This contrasts with four
 who served in this capacity before the Cultural
 Revolution.
 Li Te-sheng, who lost his job as head of the
 army's political department and was severely criti-
 cized last year, has been downgraded and is listed
 with the ordinary Politburo members.  Contrary to
 previous practice, the defense minister is not now
 a vice premier.  These changes indicate that the
 military has been further circumscribed in its
 political role.
 Even more striking is the downgrading of the
 political "left."   With the possible exception of
 Chang Chun-chiao, who rose to prominence during the
 Cultural Revolution but has long since seemed to
 have moderated his political views, no easily
 recognizable leftist was named vice premier.  The
 two most prominent leftists, Chiang Ching and Yao
 Wen-yuan, both of whom had claims to important
 government jobs, were passed over.
 There are now 29 ministries,  compared with
 the 40 that existed before the Cultural Revolution.
 Some 15 new ministers were appointed, 6 of whom
 held vice-ministerial rank before the Cultural
 Revolution.   Two former provincial leaders are now
 ministers and most of the other new ministerial
 appointees held high rank before the congress.
 Most ministers are veteran bureaucrats, a number
 of whom were severely criticized during the Cultural
 Revolution.

 The man in the sensitive job of minister of
 education falls into this category; he was secretary
 general of the State Council. before the Cultural
 Revolution.  Almost none of the ministers could be
 considered "youthful" or--with the possible excep-
 tion of the new minister of culture--"leftist."
 The position of state chairman, which had been
 held by the disgraced Liu Shao-chi and had figured
 prominently in the Lin Piao affair, has been abol-
 ished.   According to Chang Chun-chia's speech, this
 and other constitutional revisions were designed to
 strengthen the party's control over the state struc-
 ture.
 The new government constitution, which is less
 than one third the length of the old one, repeats
 the fundamentals of moderate economic policies.
 --In agriculture, the production brigade, the
 lowest of the three organizational levels within
 the commune, remains the basic accounting unit,
 as has been the case since the failure of the Great
 Leap Forward.
 --Private plots and individual non-collective
 labor are retained.
 --The constitution repeats the standard formu-
 lation that agriculture is the economic "base" and
 industry the "leading factor."
 Compromise is evident in articles that guaran-
 tee the right to criticize officials and policies
 through public debates and wall posters and state
 that revolutionary committees will remain as per-
 manent government bodies.  Both provisions appear
 to be sops to the political left.

 Chang Chun-chiao's speech did provide a hint
 that there may be friction ahead.   He noted that
 while state enterprises have the form of socialist
 ownership, in some cases leadership is not in the
 hands of real Marxists and the worker masses.  The
 implication of this phrase is not clear, but it
 may mean that new political attacks may develop
 as the "New Leap" economic campaign now a  arentl
 beginning gathers steam.

 The turnout in the provinces on New Year's
 was smaller and was reported in less detail than
 than on National Day, October lst
 in
 but generally
 keeping with the  ow- ey ce ebration last year.
 The highlight of the holiday was the identifica
 tion of two new provincial first secretaries,
 Chiang Wei-ching in Kiangsi and Liao Chih-kao
 in Fukien.
 Chiang and Liao are veteran civilian cadre
 with long experience in provincial administration,
 as are the three other provincial bosses appointed
 in the last year:   Chao Tzu-yang in Kwangtung, Pai
 Ju-ping in Shantung, and Peng Chung in Kiangsu.
 Both Chiang and Liao face a tough challenge in
 asserting their authority in their new provinces.

 reported in Kian s?
 4L semi ar situation exists
 in Fukien, where rival groups are split over loy-
 alty to the pre - Cultural Revolution first sec-
 retary, Yeh Fei, who was rehabilitated 17 months
 ago.
 Chiang's and Liao's status as rehabilitated
 former first secretaries may further complicate
 their positions.   Some figures who were purged
 during the Cultural Revolution apparently have
 had difficulty adjusting when returned to
 responsible positions.

 lesser posts and were only later promoted to the
 top spot.   Chiang and Liao are the first to go
 directly from Peking to a vacant first secretary-
 ship.   Peking will undoubtedly monitor their
 performances closely.
 The appointments in Kiangsi and Fukien leave
 only three provinces without a publicly designated
 leader:   Liaoning, Anhwei, and Hupeh.   Liaoning
 and Anhwei are closely associated with politburo
 member and party vice chairman Li Te-sheng.   Li,
 who is a military man, was heavily criticized
 during the anti-Confucius campaign, and for a
 time his political survival was in question.   He
 still apparently has powerful enemies in Peking,
 and his presence in Liaoning as Shenyang Military
 Region commander is probably complicating the
 appointment of a new civilian first secretary there.
 This is possibly true in Anhwei as well, where his
 associate Sung Pei-chang is the ranking party sec-
 retary and military man.  The badly factionalized
 politics in Hupeh are probably complicating that
 appointment.
 Accounts of holiday gatherings in other prov-
 inces were notably scanty.   The whereabouts--and
 fates--of Heilungkiang first secretary Wang
 Chia-tao, Shansi first secretary Hsieh Chen-hua,
 Canton Military Region political commissar Jen
 Ssu-Chung, and Lanchow Military Region commander
 Han Hsien-chu remain unclear, since both their
 home provinces and Peking failed to publish a de-
 tailed account of the local festivities.   The four
 senior military men were all under poster attack
 during the anti-Confucius campaign and were unex-
 pectedly present in Peking on National Day, possibly
 to answer to central authorities for their past con-
 duct.   Three other provincial personalities who were

 A New Accomplice for Lin Piao?
 Chen Hsi-lien, politburo member and commander
 of the politically sensitive Peking Military Region,
 was apparently criticized by historical analogy
 in several articles appearing in major domestic
 publications last fall.  The criticism points up
 the current effort to further reduce military polit-
 ical power in general and the influence of certain
 military region commanders in particular.
 Both these objectives became a major focus of
 the anti-Lin, anti-Confucius campaign last July.
 At that time, posters attacking Chen and politburo
 member Hsu Shih-vu, who now commands the Canton
 Military Region, began to appear with some frequency,
 while poster criticisms of other national and
 provincial leaders were on the wane.   Attacks against
 Chen and Hsu had not been prominent during the earlier
 wave of poster criticisms.   In the case of Hsu, the
 poster attacks have continued in his former bailiwick,
 Nanking.   The attacks against Chen and Hsu, and the
 continued stress on enhancing party control over the
 military in domestic media, appear to be part of a
 continuing tug of war between civilian moderates and
 certain regional commanders and their allies at the
 center.
 One of the themes of the anti-Chen articles
 is that Han Hsin, a "senior general" in the Han
 Dynasty who is clearly identified as a Lin Piao
 figure, plotted with a regional military commander
 named Chen Hsi.   This man's surname is the same
 character as that. of Chen Hsi-lien.   Moreover, one
 article notes that Chen Hsi commanded troops in the
 state of Chao, north of the capital.   Chen Hsi-lien,
 of course, commanded the Shenyang Military Region
 in northeast China for years before his rotation

 that the regional commander was in charge of the
 troops defending the border against the Huns (i.e.,
 the USSR), and that he conspired with the Huns
 through others to try to overthrow the government.
 Lin Piao stands accused of conspiring with the
 Soviets in an attempt to seize power, and the article
 seems designed to link Chen Hsi-lien with Lin's
 alleged plot.
 The charges, which appeared in October and
 November, are ominous enough by themselves.   They
 are further underscored, however, by an article in
 the November Red Flag by Lo Ssu-ting.   This article
 attacks, in the strongest terms, persons and groups
 during the Northern Sung period who wanted to capitu-
 late to the aggressors from the North.                                One group
 that received heavy fire was the "big landlord die-
 hards."  Many previous articles in the anti-Confu-
 cius campaign have established the parallel between
 the landlords or feudal princes and the military
 region commanders.
 The charge that Chen Hsi-lien conspired with
 Lin does not seem to have validity.   Chen was one
 of the first military leaders to reappear after the
 Lin affair, and he played a major role in the subsequent
 investigations.   Chen may well have favored a less
 intransigent stance toward the Soviets, however--
 after all, he bore responsibility for defending
 Manchuria against Soviet attacks.   In this event,
 his stance in this issue could now be the basis
 for an effort to undermine his position by linking
 him--however transparent the real evidence--to Lin.
 At the least, the effort to brand Chen a covert
 Lin supporter brings considerable pressure to bear
 against him, and this may have been the objective

 Like other civilian and military figures, Chen
 survived serious political charges in 1974.  Now that
 the National People's Congress has been held, it is
 likely that Peking will return to the problem of
 civil-military relations, and it would not be surprising
 to see the charges against Chen and others revived.
 While Chen was the only military man to be named a
 vice-premier--an honor that even the new Defense Mini-
 ster did not enjoy--his transfer from Shenyang, where
 he was seemingly immune, to Peking in December 1973

 China and Strauss:   Strange Bedfellows
 I                                I
 Peking is using the current visit. of promi-
 nent conservative German opposition leader Franz
 Josef Strauss to drive home strong Chinese views
 about German reunification, Moscow's threat to
 European security, and the need for European sol-
 idarity against the USSR.
 Strauss received unprecedented treatment in
 view of the unofficial nature of his visit and of
 his stature in German politics.
 The closest recent parallel to Strauss'  re-
 ception was the treatment, accorded former. British
 Prime Minister Heath in May 1974.   Heath, however,
 was a former head of government and the leader of
 the. opposition,  and his trip had been planned while
 he was still in office?   Strauss has not been a
 member of a German government for more than five
 years, and he is not regarded as a strong candidate
 for high office in the future.

 went so far as to hint at overlapping Peking-Bonn

 Strauss said that the continuing division of

 The Chinese have been unable to elicit public sup-

 Western Troubles Hurt Trade Balance
 Worldwide inflation is pushing up China's
 import costs while stagnation is cutting the demand
 for its exports.   China's deficit with the West
 in 1974 is estimated at $750 million.   The US and
 Japan caused most of the deficit--$700 million
 and $500 million, respectively.
 Peking has taken steps to reduce payments
 for imports.   Several contracts for foodstuffs,
 fertilizers, cotton, and steel were canceled or
 postponed before the Fall Canton Trade Fair.
 Peking ordered state-trading corporations to pur-
 chase only the most essential technology and
 equipment. at the fair.    Highest priority went to
 imports of petroleum, mining, and. food-processing
 equipment.   Since the fair, however, Peking has
 asked suppliers to speed up grain deliveries, re-
 flecting concern over a harvest that fell short of
 expectations.
 in addition to curtailing imports, China is
 attempting to switch from cash payments to short-
 term credits for some of its major commodity
 purchases.
 China is also trying to increase exports by
 lowering prices for its traditional products--
 silk, textiles, and handicraft goods.   The export
 drive, however, has come at a time when world
 demand for many of these products is declining.

 New Twist for an Old Slogan
 F77           I
 Chinese propaganda has contained vague refer-
 ences to a "new leap forward'
 he phrase calls to mind the frantic and
 destructive economic activity of the "Great Leap
 Forward" that so seriously set back economic de-
 velopment from 1958 to 1960.   There is no evidence
 that the new leap heralds a return to those earlier
 radical policies, but the appearance of the phrase
 has caused much speculation in China watching circles,
 it  as
 surfaced periodically in routine propaganda broad-
 casts from a number of different provinces,  suggest-
 ing that the phrase is part of some central docu-
 ment,   It has not been featured in the national
 media, however,  as would normally be expected. Even
 provincial references to the new leap have been
 sporadic and without elaboration.
 The new  leap forward" may be just a fresh
 slogan in the seven-month-old campaign to boost sag-
 ging worker morale and thereby increase production,
 The phrase generally is seen in.formulas calling on
 cadre to step up      ^uction "to welcome the new lea
 forward in l975.t
 do not seem to indicate that ra i
 ca  new economic policies are in the works, although
 some adjustments in current production plans are
 clearly being made.
 Other observers, however, have suggested that
 the new leap couLd be .a :Leftist initiative that may
 even culminate in a higher level of agriculture
 collectivization,; long resisted by Chinese peasants.
 A recent editorial in the Hunan provincial paper
 can be cited as evidence:   the editorial stressed

 working collective holdings in comparison to private
 plots, and responsibility for certain functions that
 can be better handled at higher levels--e?g,, water
 conservancy projects"-may be transferred from produc-

 A new and potentially significant aspect of
 Peking's continuing drive to reduce the power of
 provincial, military men has recently been revealed
 in provincial, circulars issued in conjunction with
 the annual "Love the Army and Cherish the People"
 campaign.   Civilian government and party organi-

 their mutual support under the overall principle
 i.   erences  have emerged in the   egree to which mili-
 tary regions have endorsed the subordination of mili-
 tary units to civilian party committees at corresponding
 levels, indicating that the idea has encountered re-
 sistance.
 within the military hierarchy were to remain
 unchanged, various military headquarters and units
 must "regard themselves as departments of military
 affairs of local p-3rt.y committees of the same
 level and consciously accept the leadership" of
 these committees.   Moreover, the circular spe-
 cifically stated that all field armies must accept
 the leadership of the provincial party committee.
 This was a new theme and suggested a move to make
 field armies, which are under the command of the
 military region, more responsive to the direction
 of civilian party authorities in the provinces in
 which the units ar.  sttat :ioned.

 The United Nations:   Disappointment
 The Chinese gave the recently concluded Gen-
 eral Assembly session ::Low marks and were particu-
 larly disappointed by the behavior of the Third
 World countries.   Although the poorer nations
 voted as a bloc more than ever before, they split
 ranks when it. came to support for the Chinese-
 backed resolutions on Korea and Cambodia--the
 most important items on the agenda as far as
 Peking was concerned.
 The General Assembly also took actions that
 diluted China's anti-Soviet efforts.   Although
 Peking co-sponsored resolutions affirming Pales-
 tinian rights and inviting the Palestine Libera-
 tion organization to participate in General As-
 sembly work as an observer, this stemmed from a
 desire to keep pace with Third World sentiment
 rather than genuine enthusiasm.   Indeed, the Chi-
 nese did not lobby at all for the resolutions.
 To Peking's dismay, Third World countries
 went along with several less important proposals
 backed by the Soviets.   On a, number of disarmament
 resolutions, China either had to go down to de-
 feat with the minority or acquiesce to popular
 opinion.   The only bright spot was the passage of
 a resolution calling for the establishment of a
 nuclear-free zone in South Asia, a move that would
 be in the interest of China. and Pakistan.   The

 Chiang Ching's pub-L_Lc activities tend to run
 in streaks.   She often punctuates periods of
 activity with unexplained absences.   Her return
 to view on January 2 after being out of sight for
 a month was, in its own unique way, characteristic.
 One important aspect of her re-emergence was
 unusual--she attended a banquet.   The affair was
 in honor of E. F. Hill, visiting Australian Com-
 munist Party head.   Previously, Madame Mao did not
 normally attend banquets for visiting dignitaries,
 but kept her name in the public eye by showing up
 at picture-taking sessions or cultural performances.
 The banquet for Hill was hosted jointly by
 Wang Hung-wen, Chang Chun-chiao, and Chiang Ching.
 Her presence at the banquet--like an earlier NCNA
 release in late September, which noted that Chiang
 had "entrusted" the Cultural Group under the State
 Council to give a soiree for Mrs. Marcos of the
 Philippines, and her mention along with Premier
 Chou by Vice Premier Li Hsien-nien in his banquet
 toast to Mrs. Marcos--suggested that she was
 attempting to gain a government post at the Na-
