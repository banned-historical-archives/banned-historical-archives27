 China:
 Military Options
 Against Vietnam
 Key Judgments   Beijing has the muscle to conduct a wide variety of military actions against
 Information available Vietnam but is not likely to undertake a "second lesson" unless severely
 as of 15 March 1984 provoked. Our judgment is based on the following factors:
 was used in this report.
 ? Cost. The February 1979 invasion of Vietnam was costly both in lives
 and resources. Beijing lost 20,000 killed or wounded and spent at least $1
 billion. Beijing today is committed to an ambitious economic moderniza-
 tion program and would be reluctant to initiate a prolonged. conflict that
 would drain China's coffers and have the potential to cause domestic
 political dissension.
 ? Vietnamese strength. We believe the massive expansion and qualitative
 improvements of the Vietnamese armed forces facing China are major
 deterrents to Chinese action. In 1979 China dictated the beginning and
 end of the conflict. In our view, because of Vietnam's new capabilities,
 the Chinese military could not guarantee a quick, contained lesson.
 ? Soviet presence. With a major Soviet naval and air presence at Cam
 Ranh Bay, China would probably avoid such actions as naval offensives
 against Vietnamese-held islands in the South China Sea.
 In lieu of a second lesson, Beijing uses "saber rattling" incidents-such as
 small-scale skirmishes and artillery barrages-to warn Hanoi against
 border provocations or assaults on Kampuchean resistance bases along the
 Thai border. "Saber rattling" provides a highly visible demonstration of
 Beijing's support for the Kampuchean resistance and the Thai Government
 and reminds Vietnam that Chinese military power is still potent. Moreover,
 it forces Vietnam to keep most of its forces deployed in the North and un-
 available for duty in Kampuchea.
 If Beijing believed, however, that its own or Thailand's national security
 were directly threatened, or the existence of the Kampuchean resistance
 was in jeopardy, we believe China would take stronger military action
 against Vietnam, probably a ground offensive. Large-unit ground attacks
 into Vietnam or Laos would be a measured escalation of the existing
 conflict whereas naval or airstrikes would be more likely to open the door
 to Vietnamese retaliation using newly acquired air-to-surface and surface-
 to-surface missiles. Moreover, there are still glaring deficiencies in Chinese
 air and naval forces that will take several years to overcome.

 We believe that short of a massive, and improbable, Chinese assault to take
 Hanoi, there is probably no military action Beijing can take that will force
 Vietnam to withdraw from Kampuchea. The best that Beijing can hope for
 is that through a combination of diplomatic and limited but persistent
 military pressure it can convince Hanoi that its interests are better served
 by a political settlement to the Kampuchean situation.

 Too Secret
 On 17 February 1979, after a three-month military
 buildup larger than the one that preceded China's
 entrance into the Korean war, China launched a short
 but bloody border war against Vietnam. Before the
 war China maintained only 150,000 troops within 400
 kilometers of the Sino-Vietnamese border. It rede-
 ployed 10 armies, some from as far away as 1,600
 kilometers drawn from six military regions for the
 attack         For 16 days, an estimated 500,000
 Chinese troops carried out an attack along the entire
 border designed to "teach Vietnam a lesson" for
 invading Kampuchea, for moving closer to Moscow,
 for attacking Chinese positions on the border, and for
 mistreating ethnic Chinese living in Vietnam.
 China's ground troops destroyed Vietnamese border
 fortifications, occupied three provincial capitals, and
 used a scorched earth policy to create a cordon
 sanitaire along the 1,200-km border. Hanoi had only
 100,000 troops in the three northern military regions
 and half of them were held in reserve in defensive
 positions near Hanoi.
 After Chinese forces seized the provincial capital of
 Lang Son-a battle in which both sides had heavy
 casualties-China's then PLA Chief of Staff Deng
 Xiaoping declared that Vietnam had been punished
 enough, and on 5 March Chinese forces began to
 withdraw. Chinese troops took 10 days to pull out,
 meanwhile destroying public works, blowing up
 bridges, and using artillery barrages to cover their
 withdrawal and to create a wasteland along the
 border. The lengthy pullback highlighted China's
 control of the situation and prevented Hanoi from
 credibly claiming it had chased the invaders back
 across the border.
 Even before the last Chinese soldiers had left Viet-
 nam, Hanoi began a massive buildup of its forces in
 the north. Divisions were recalled from Kampuchea
 and southern Vietnam, a general mobilization was
 decreed, and units previously assigned to economic

 construction activities were upgraded into main force
 divisions. Hanoi nearly doubled the size of its army     25X1
 throughout Indochina from 600,000 troops in early        25X1
 1979 to about 1.2 million troops by late 1981
 The Situation Today
 Beijing shows no signs of willingness to compromise      25X1
 with Hanoi and holds open the option of another
 limited war. In January, just after the leaders of the
 tripartite resistance coalition of Kampuchea visited
 Beijing, a senior Chinese Foreign Ministry official
 told a US diplomat that in response to an aggressive     25X1
 Vietnamese dry season offensive this year, China
 would be willing to increase diplomatic, economic,
 and military pressure on Vietnam and has not aban-
 doned the option of giving Vietnam a "second lesson."
 Last April, Beijing pounded Vietnamese positions
 near the Chinese border with long-range artillery and
 mortar barrages in retaliation for Vietnam's 1982-83
 dry season campaign in Kampuchea, which spilled
 over into Thailand. Despite talks aimed at improving
 relations between Moscow and Beijing, China's offi-
 cial news agency in November sharply criticized
 Moscow, calling Vietnam "a knife the Soviet Union
 has placed at the back of China" and accusing
 Moscow of forming a military alliance with the
 Vietnamese in order to forge another link in the
 military encirclement of China.
 Hanoi takes the Chinese threat seriously and keeps
 more than 60 percent of its ground forces as well as
 most of its newest Soviet weapons deployed against

 Beijing's troops in Kunming
 Military Region also went on an alert in reaction to
 new border fighting, according to Chinese press re-
 ports. China accused Hanoi of 35 border provocations
 during the New Year holiday alone
 The Military Balance, 1984
 Beijing's 270,000 troop strength within 400 kilome-
 ters of the border is approximately half that of the
 opposing force in northern Vietnam. This has fostered
 a belief that China has few military options it can
 exercise against Vietnam. Such assessments fail to
 take into account China's large reserves and its
 demonstrated ability to redeploy armies rapidly to the
 southern front. Hanoi's buildup in the north would
 increase the cost of another border-wide, ground'force
 assault such as the 1979 incursion, but Beijing could
 elect to use a variety of ground, air, and naval actions
 against the Vietnamese. Over the past five years,
 Beijing has upgraded its military capabilities in south
 China and in some ways, particularly naval opera-
 tions, has actually broadened its range of military
 options against Vietnam.
 If Beijing believed that its own or Thailand's national
 security or the existence of the Kampuchean resist-
 ance forces were seriously threatened, we believe
 China would take strong military action against Viet-
 nam. Beijing has assured resistance and Thai leaders
 that it will not allow Vietnam to reduce its forces
 along the northern border in order to increase striking
 power in Kampuchea. Moreover, the Chinese willing-
 ness to increase border tensions-both this and last
 year-even without a major threat to either the
 Kampuchean resistance or Thailand, is an indication
 of Beijing's deep commitment to trying to check
 Vietnam from consolidating its control in Indochina.
 Ground Force Options
 defense, that will take several years to overcome.
 of the existing conflict whereas naval or air strikes
 would be more likely to open the door to Vietnamese
 retaliation using its airpower and air-to-surface and
 surface-to-surface missiles. Finally, there are still
 glaring deficiencies in Chinese air and naval forces,
 particularly in the areas of ground- and sea-based air
 In our judgment, if Beijing exercised the option of a
 second lesson it would probably be in the form of a
 limited ground offensive. The PLA is still a conserva-
 tive, ground-oriented military force that has little
 experience or confidence in projecting power using its
 naval or air components. A border incursion into
 Vietnam or Laos would be only a measured escalation
 Beijing has the muscle to mount another massive
 ground assault comparable to 1979. There are 27
 ground combat divisions and an estimated 600,000
 ground, air, and naval troops in Kunming and
 Guangzhou Military Regions. Hanoi currently has 38
 ground combat divisions and upwards of 700,000
 ground, air, and naval troops in all of northern
 Vietnam but has few reserves available to augment
 this force (figure 2). Beijing, on the other hand, has an
 additional 1 million ground troops not committed to
 the Soviet front which it can dispatch to fight Viet-
 nam. Moreover, if Beijing were again to deploy to the

 south, maneuver divisions from the Wuhan strategic
 reserve, the Sichuan basin, and Kunming and
 Guangzhou Military Regions, as it did in the 1979
 conflict, it could attain an overall advantage of almost
 2 to 1 in main force combat troops and a similar edge
 assaults into Vietnam. Terrain, however, dictates use
 of only a few major corridors in the event of large-
 scale operations.
 Beijing also has at least one highly specialized recon-
 naissance unit on the Vietnamese front trained for
 long-range patrols behind enemy lines which could
 provide additional intelligence during a border as-

 Concentrated Border Attacks
 China is aware of the Vietnamese buildup and, in our
 view, recognizes the heavy costs of launching another
 border-wide offensive similar to the 1979 incursion.
 An option for Beijing would be to mass an invasion
 force at a single point on the border and thereby gain
 a decisive tactical advantage along a narrow front
 rather than the entire border. To maintain the ele-
 ment of surprise, smaller forces could be active along
 much of the border to mask the chosen objective from
 Vietnamese forces until the actual attack. Chinese
 forces could take a particular objective, for example
 the provincial capital of Lai Chau, protect their
 flanks, and then withdraw within a short period after
 once again proving Vietnam's vulnerability and ad-
 ministering another, albeit smaller, lesson.
 Improvements to the Chinese military infrastructure
 within the border area since 1979 enhance Beijing's
 ability to exercise this option. Five years ago, there
 were few major military installations along the fron-
 tier, and invading troops were housed in villages and
 could serve as staging areas for sizable reserve forces
 arriving from the north. In addition, vastly expanded

 Ground Attacks Into Laos
 An alternative to ground assaults along Vietnam's
 heavily fortified northern border is a Chinese incur-
 sion into Laos. Vietnam only has one division de-

 only one additional combat division-a total of about
 20,000 men-in the two military regions of northern
 Laos. We estimate that the Vietnamese could get
 support from about 20,000 Lao troops, but the Chi-
 nese could overwhelm the defenders by massing two
 main force armies (100,000 men) for an attack.
 Beijing could also count on Chinese-trained resistance
 forces in northern Laos to harass Vietnamese and Lao
 positions, to disrupt lines of communications, and to
 provide detailed intelligence on the defenders' troop
 strengths and dispositions. Since 1979, China has
 trained Lao resistance fighters at military installa-
 tions in southern Yunnan and sent them back to bases
 Vietnam is concerned about the possibility of a Chi-
 nese offensive through Laos and frequently conducts
 exercises simulating combat against such an attack.
 These exercises also test an increasingly complicated
 command structure in Laos that involves incorpora-
 tion of new equipment into the Lao Army inventory:
 Assaults into Laos offer both advantages and disad-
 vantages to Beijing. An offensive through Laos would
 allow for an easier withdrawal when the lesson ended
 because Vietnam lacks the reinforcements there to
 press a counterattack, and it would also offer Beijing
 the chance to focus world attention on the existence of
 an armed resistance movement in Laos. There are also
 some major drawbacks:
 ? An assault into Laos might be seen by the interna-
 tional community as an attack on a third country
 and a widening of the regional conflict.

 ? A Chinese attack could punish Vietnamese forces
 stationed in Laos but would offer no opportunity to
 hurt the Vietnamese economy unless Beijing's

 Saber Rattling
 The most likely Chinese ground force option is to
 initiate small-scale clashes and ground probes into
 northern Vietnam in response to Vietnamese provoca-
 tions along the Sino-Vietnamese frontier or a large
 Vietnamese offensive in Kampuchea that threatened
 Thailand. This alternative increases the tension along
 the border and is a highly visible demonstration of
 Chinese displeasure but limits the danger of escala-
 tion of the conflict. It also has the advantage of
 forcing Vietnam to keep most of its forces deployed in
 This is the option that Beijing exercised in a limited
 way in 1983 in response to a Vietnamese drive against
 resistance forces along the Thai border. In late March

 Fighter Attacks
 Beijing's best aircraft for tactical bombing strikes and
 ground attack operations is the A-5 fighter-bomber.
 Even though it is a short-range aircraft with a limited
 bomb load, it could be used effectively in bombing
 raids against targets near the Chinese border. The
 A-5s could take off from airfields near the border,
 attack, and return to Chinese airfields before Viet-
 namese fighter aircraft could intercept them.
 Beijing recognizes the utility of these aircraft and
 formed a regiment of 25 A-5 fighter-bombers in
 Guangzhou Military Region in March 1980. It is the
 first new ground attack regiment created since 1976
 and the only one in south China.
 Ground Support
 Training involving the A-5s in Guangzhou shows that
 the Chinese intend to use the fighter-bombers in two
 wartime missions: to strike preselected targets in
 tandem with bombers, and to support ground forces.
 In at least two large-scale exercises in Guangzhou
 since late 1981, A-5s working in conjunction with B-5
 (IL-28) light bombers flew multiple ground attack
 Bomber Strikes
 In May 1980, Beijing added B-6 (TU-16) medium
 bombers to the air division at Leiyang in Guangzhou
 Military Region, giving the Chinese the option to
 mount bombing runs deeper into Vietnam. These
 bombers can strike targets deep in Vietnamese territo-
 ry with larger bomb loads than either the A-5s or
 B-5s. However, the B-6's relatively slow speed, limited
 maneuverability, and ineffective electronic counter-
 measures would make it easy prey for supersonic
 fighter-interceptors and surface-to-air missiles.
 China would run the risk of high bomber losses if it
 attacked installations other than those close to the
 Chinese frontier. The Hanoi-Haiphong corridor pre-
 sents especially great dangers for B-6 bombers, as the

 area is protected by a sophisticated network of over-
 lapping SA-2 medium-to-high and SA-3 low-to-medi-
 um altitude missile sites. Moreover, Vietnam has
 received over 150 late-model MIG-21 fighter-inter-
 ceptors from the Soviet Union since the war, and
 nearly all are based near Hanoi. Vietnamese econom-
 ic and military targets along the border are, however,
 vulnerable to B-6 attacks. They are defended by only
 a few surface-to-air missile sites, and A-5s could
 attack the ground-based air defenses before the B-6s
 arrived. Although B-6s would be easy targets for
 Vietnamese supersonic interceptors, if the B-6s struck
 targets close to the Chinese frontier, they could be
 adequately defended by Chinese interceptor aircraft.
 Beijing is well aware of the improvement to Vietnam-
 ese airpower and has taken steps to bolster its own air
 defenses.
 In addition, fighter regiments from other
 military regions continue a policy begun in 1979 of
 rotating to airfields along the Sino-Vietnamese border
 for six months. These rotational assignments not only
 augment air strength in the region, but also give pilots
 experience in a combat environment and acquaint
 regiments with flying conditions in south China.
 We believe that the Chinese are more likely to
 consider the use of naval power in a "second lesson"
 than they were in the 1979 conflict. Two key factors
 underlie this judgment: first, there has been a signifi-
 cant increase in the capability of the South Sea Fleet

 to undertake offensive naval action; and second, Viet-
 namese naval weaknesses have not been fully re-
 dressed. We judge that the two types of naval actions
 that China would seriously consider are an amphibi-
 ous assault against Vietnamese-held islands in the
 South China Sea and the mining of Haiphong harbor.
 Amphibious Assault Against Vietnamese Islands
 Improvements to the South Sea Fleet's amphibious

 pared than ever for taking Vietnamese-held islands by
 With these capabilities, Beijing would have a com-

 two most likely targets, the Spratly Islands in the

 could assemble an assault force with a decisive nu-

 included half of the fleet's complement of destroyers,
 frigates, and subchasers, China would have a com-

 fenders. Beijing could gain a similar edge over the
 estimated 1,000 Vietnamese soldiers on Bach Long Vi

 The Emerging Marine Corps. Beijing has also created
 a dedicated amphibious force of Marines, with the
 South Sea Fleet leading the way, which greatly
 increases the likelihood of success in any amphibious
 assault operation. On 12 May 1982, Liberation Army
 Daily announced that tanks and armored vehicles of
 the Navy's "new force," the Marines, had taken part
 in an amphibious landing exercise in south China.
 Since then, we have noted
 that China is training a small force of
 marines in amphibious operations, probably on Hai-
 nan Island:

 The Paracels-Outpost in the South China Sea.
 China seized control over all of the Paracel Islands in
 January 1974 after a short naval battle with South
 Vietnamese gunboats and minor skirmishes with
 South Vietnamese ground forces on the islands. Bei-
 jing did little to bolster facilities on the Paracel
 Islands before the 1979 war but since then has
 improved its military presence there, which would
 enable the islands to be used in support of military
 operations in the South China Sea:
 y early 1982 the Chinese
 had built a new nava     ase and port on Duncan
 Island. The harbor is routinely used by submarine
 chasers, and it may be able to accommodate larger
 warships.
 ? In October 1983, two B-6 bombers overflew Malay-
 sian-occupied Swallow Reef in the Spratlys, this
 time with a frigate and replenishment oiler deploy-
 ing south of the Paracels to provide navigational
 assistance and air surveillance.
 Deficiencies of the South Sea Fleet. The South Sea
 Fleet's most serious weakness in projecting power is
 its lack of modern shipborne air defense systems. Any
 Chinese naval task force operating in the Spratlys, for
 example, would be out of range of China's land-based
 fighters and within striking distance of Vietnam's
 airpower. Although Hanoi's SU-22s and MIG-21s
 would be operating near the limits of their effective
 combat radius, they would pose a credible threat,
 using bombs and Soviet AS-7 tactical air-to-surface
 missiles against China's naval ships. At. present, South
 Sea Fleet warships have no surface-to-air missiles or
 other modern weapon systems for defense against
 fighter-bombers and air-to-surface missiles. Ground
 forces have shoulder-fired SA-7s but no mobile, tacti-
 cal, low-to-medium altitude SAMs to deploy after
 establishing shore positions.~
 Similar problems would be encountered in an assault
 on Vietnamese-held Bach Long Vi Island in the Gulf
 of Tonkin. Although Chinese fighterswould be avail-
 able to provide fleet air defense

 Beijing appears to be testing its newly improved naval
 capabilities in the South China Sea. Since late 1980,
 Beijing has paid more attention to the Spratly Islands,
 over which it claims sovereignty:

 to-surface cruise missiles at installations near Hai-
 phong. The Sepal has a range that covers the entire
 Gulf and half of Hainan Island and it could be used
 effectively against the Chinese fleet. Even if the
 Vietnamese Sepals were destroyed by Chinese air-
 strikes, a confrontation in the Gulf would almost
 certainly lead to a costly air war in which China's
 numerically superior airpower probably would wear
 down and eventually defeat the Vietnamese, but not
 before taking heavy losses.

 A second deficiency for the Chinese during any
 amphibious assault is the lack of adequate antisubma-
 rine warfare capabilities. Although the Chinese have
 made some minor improvements in the ASW equip-
 ment they acquired from the Soviets in the late 1950s,
 it remains of limited utility. Chinese sonars, in partic-
 ular, can detect targets only within short ranges. The
 Vietnamese Navy does not yet have any submarines,
 but four to six Soviet submarines usually are present
 in the South China Sea, including several diesel-
 powered torpedo-attack submarines and one or two
 nuclear-powered cruise missile submarines. They
 could conceivably support Hanoi in a Sino-Vietnam-
 ese naval conflict.
 Mining Vietnamese Harbors
 We believe that the mining of Vietnamese harbors
 would be a low-risk, high-impact military operation
 that is within the capabilities of the Chinese Navy.
 Haiphong harbor is the most attractive target, as over
 50 percent of Vietnam's merchant shipping and most
 arms imports come through the port. Even a tempo-
 rary closure would cause considerable economic dislo-
 cation and complicate the delivery of arms from the
 Soviet Union. Traffic could be rerouted to southern
 ports, but the delays could prove critical if there was
 fighting along the northern border.
 Mindful of Vietnam's well-developed air and coastal
 defenses around Haiphong, the Chinese would proba-
 bly use submarine-launched naval mines. China has
 over 100 R-class diesel attack submarines-22 in the
 South Sea Fleet-each of which can lay up to 36
 mines. China's submarine force could easily lay
 enough mines in one operation to close Haiphong to
 shipping. The United States, using a mine roughly
 equivalent to China's current mines, initially closed
 Haiphong in 1972 using only 50 mines. China pro-
 duces five varieties of naval mines ranging in weight
 from 200 to 1,100 kilograms. We believe the Chinese
 Navy has a large stock of naval mines.
 The Vietnamese Navy's ASW and minesweeping
 capabilities, though improving, are probably insuffi-
 cient to prevent China from mining Haiphong, and
 the Navy would be hard pressed to clear independent-
 ly the harbor once mines were laid. Hanoi's ASW
 force consists of four Petya-class light frigates and
 eight subchasers based at Da Nang, and 30 KA-25
 Hormone helicopters based at Haiphong. The Chinese
 would be most likely to mine the harbor at night since
 Hormone ASW helicopters are unable to operate
 effectively in submarine detection at night. All six of
 Vietnam's minesweepers would have to be used to
 reopen Haiphong, but Chinese submarines could
 probably keep the harbor closed by returning at night
 to lay more mines.
 Obstacles to Chinese Actions
 Vietnam's New Strength
 The expansion and qualitative improvements to the
 Vietnamese armed forces facing China are certainly
 major obstacles to a Chinese attack. In 1979 the
 Chinese were able to dictate the beginning and ending
 of the conflict. Today, Vietnam has-acquired new
 offensive weapons such as SU-22 fighter-bombers and
 AS-7 tactical air-to-surface missiles. They have also
 acquired Scud-B tactical surface-to-surface missiles
 that can strike Chinese airfields and cities from
 Kaiyuan in the west, to Nanning in Guangxi, to the
 west coast of Hainan Island. The Scud-B is an older
 Soviet system, and, while inaccurate, it can deliver a
 1,000-kilogram high-explosive or chemical warhead
 on targets as far as 300 kilometers from the launch
 position. In view of Vietnam's new strength, the
 Chinese military could not guarantee a quick, con-
 tained lesson.
 A Soviet Shadow
 With a major Soviet naval and air presence at Cam
 Ranh Bay, China would also have to weigh heavily
 the possibility of Soviet intervention in any future
 Sino-Vietnamese hostilities. We believe it is unlikely
 that the Soviets would intervene in a purely Sino-
 Vietnamese conflict, but the Soviets have sought to
 deter the Chinese before by dispatching warships to
 the South China Sea. During the 1979 war, a Kresta-
 II cruiser led a task force into the South China Sea
 and a Sverdlov cruiser moved into the East China
 Sea.                             the Soviets
 routinely maintain a complement of six surface com-
 batants in the South China Sea and last November
 expanded their air operations at Cam Ranh Bay by
 transferring nine Badger (TU-16) bomber aircraft
 from a base near Vladivostok.

 Too Secret
 We do not believe, however, that Soviet troop deploy-
 ments along the Sino-Soviet border are a major
 military deterrent to Chinese action against Vietnam.
 China in 1979 prepared for the possibility of Soviet
 retaliation along the northern frontier and placed
 troops on a high state of alert but was not deterred
 from attacking Vietnam. Today, China has strength-
 ened its northern defenses and is less vulnerable than
 in 1979 to Soviet pressure along their long land
 border.'
 Second Lesson Unlikely ...
 Although Beijing has the muscle to implement a wide
 variety of military options, we do not believe that
 China will undertake a major second lesson against
 Vietnam unless severely provoked. The 1979 invasion
 was costly both in terms of lives and resources as
 China lost 20,000 killed or wounded and had to raise
 its 1979 military budget by over 2 billion yuan to
 cover the cost of the war. Beijing today is committed
 to an ambitious program of economic modernization
 and would be reluctant to get involved in another
 prolonged conflict which would drain China's coffers
 and potentially cause domestic unrest.
 ... But the Tensions Remain
 Even without a new border war, Beijing exacts a high
 price from Vietnam for its domination of Indochina
 and its collusion with the Soviet Union, and has few
 incentives to defuse the tension:
 ? The harassment along the land border compels
 Hanoi to maintain a large standing army at a
 relatively high state of readiness along the Chinese
 frontier.
 ? Beijing's assistance to Kampuchean resistance
 groups has helped to mire Hanoi in a long and
 inconclusive antiguerrilla campaign in Kampuchea.
 ? China's increasing levels of material support and
 training for antigovernment insurgents in Laos of-
 fers the prospects of increasing the cost to the
 Vietnamese of their efforts to control Indochina.
 ? Mutual condemnation of Vietnam's takeover of
 Kampuchea has created new reasons to support
 Thailand and opened doors to improving relations
 with other Southeast Asian nations. Opposition to
 Vietnamese domination of Indochina as well as the
 growing Soviet naval presence at Cam Ranh Bay
 allows Beijing to point to a congruence of interest
 with US foreign policy in this part of East Asia.
 Nonetheless, the price Beijing exacts today through
 limited military activity is not sufficient to force
 Vietnam to withdraw from Kampuchea. Short of a
 massive, and improbable, Chinese assault to take
 Hanoi, there is probably no military action Beijing
 can take that will break Vietnam's resolve. The best
 that Beijing can hope for is that through a combina-
 tion of diplomatic and limited but persistent military
 pressure it can convince Hanoi that its interests are
 better served by a political settlement to the Kampu-
 chean situation.
 The hostility and diametrically opposed positions on
 Indochina point to a prolonged hostility between
 China and Vietnam. Beijing, over the last five years,
 has shown no willingness to accept Hanoi's many
 overtures for a reduction in tensions and continues to
 make a total Vietnamese withdrawal from Kampu-
 chea the precondition for any settlement. Vietnam, on
 the other hand, is unwilling to compromise its basic
 aim of controlling Indochina. We see no wavering on
 Moscow's part of its backing for the Vietnamese
 position, and thus we believe the impasse will contin-
