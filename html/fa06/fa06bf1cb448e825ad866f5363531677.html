 THIS IS UNEVALUATED INFORMATION
 A tendency is apparent, particularly in ;Tay Day comment, to make the fading anticorrupti0n
 drive the foundation upon which to build all plans and propat anua grog-ra uis.  Whether
 the drive was satisfactory or unsatisfactory, we cannot escape tho conclusion that it
 shook the economic and social structure to its foundations, and the deliberate effort
 to convince the Chinese people it has led to a sounder economy ai'.d a stronger regime
 creates a suspicion there may be some doubt even in the minds of the Communist
 administration.  Indications of disruption creep in despite efforts to hide them.
 State concerns work to revive private industry and get capital that had gone under-
 groz:L7.d back to work.  .say Day advice to workers mentioned the importance of ein,,;
 "rea.,onable" in wage and welfare demands, of "eliminating capitalists' worries," and
 of makirg friends with the capitalists, denounced so v-icioualy not long ago.  Workers
 were admonished to "recognize the administrative and hiring rightr; of private firms,"
 in spite. )f announced plans to place employment of construction workers under strict
 Goverruaent controls.  Under the rapidly expanding influence of the Youth Corps,
 thousands of experienced workers were lost through promotion of loyal anticorruption
 enthusiasts, and though propagandists talk only of increased off1 ciency, the loss. must
 be obvious where  "5 workers now do the work formerly done by ?L."
 Indications continue that the boasted price cuts are part of the desperate efforts
 of State trading companies to distribute goods, while announced wage raises in the
 Northeast show a need to placate the workers, who now are offered. special pay in
 "isolated job areas where the climate is unhealthful."  The :aid.den revival of refcreuces
 to USSR friendship, and the third acclaim in?2 weeks of Russian technicians on the
 Chinese-Changchun Railway, may indicate a now realization of the need for Soviet
 assistance.
 The resurgence of landlora influence in Yurina:: and Ki.an,:si, ;mere farmers "refuse,a
 to cooperate with the new regime," has spread to Sikar.g, anu special steps, including
 "distribution of loans: and seed," were nccess;ii^y before Yurnicui 1ucasants would plant new
 crops following killing frosts.   Special presoures on farmers with surplus gain were
 resorted to in getting food for East Chins famin,, victir7:s.   Food prokiuction defiuieucier,
 in Sinkiang were admitted, despite glowing p..,a;: reports of production miracles there by
 units of the People Es; Liberation Army.

 their enthusiasm for promotion of the anticorruption drive, with the Esinhai Equipment
 Company completing scheduled work on time and workers in the Minfeng Mills increasing
 production while catching tigers.  Sian said (May 3) that a Northwest official told the
 Northwest China Military and Administrative Committee that "The achievements of our
 activities during the past 5 months have been spectacular.  We should further strengthen
 the anticorruption drive in order to fulfill our norms for the current year."
