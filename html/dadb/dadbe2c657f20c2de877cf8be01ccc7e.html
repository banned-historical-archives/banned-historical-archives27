 MOSCOW INTENSIFIES EFFORTS TO DISCREDIT PEIPING'S POLICIES
 Over the past few weeks,
 the USSR has increased its ef-
 forts to create the impression
 that the majority of Communist
 parties endorse its denuncia-
 tion of Communist China's
 "splitting" activities within
 the world Communist movement.
 It seems to believe that by
 building a convincing public
 record of Chinese intransigence
 and obstructionism it can even-
 tually overcome the opposition
 of many of the parties to an in-
 ternational Communist conference.
 In a 3 June Izvestia edi-
 torial, Moscow leveled a blis-
 tering attack against the Chinese
 and warned them of the dangers
 of not consulting with the So-
 viet Union on major political
 and economic policies.   The
 editorial maintained that Pei-
 ping now is openly voicing its
 contempt for treaties concluded
 with "fraternal countries."   It
 implied that the Chinese no
 longer abide by the provision in
 the 1950 Sino-Soviet treaty of
 alliance that they will give the
 Soviet Union information on ques-
 tions of foreign policy.  Izvestia
 contrasted this alleged growing trend toward isolation with the
 "regular consultations" under-
 taken by members of the Warsaw
 Pact on all important interna-
 tional problems.
 The editorial also condemned
 Peiping's failure to coordinate
 economic policies with other
 Communist countries.   This ac-
 cusation, which by implication
 was also directed at the Ru-
 manians, was buttressed in a
 4 June Izvestia article which
 labeled as  a solutely imper-
 missible the uncoordinated
 steps of some members" of the
 ""socialist camp" in foreign
 trade.
 Pravda, too, has dramatized
 Peiping s subversive activities.
 It lashed out at the Chinese
 withdrawal from the bloc's theo-
 retical journal, Problems of
 Peace and Socialism, and criti-
 cized Peiping'~'s new journal,
 Revolution.  Other articles have
 made a serious effort to prove
 that the Chinese are "fractionists"
 and are providing political di-
 rection to anti-Soviet Communist
 party factions throughout the
 world.   Pravda went on to claim
 that a "majority of all parties
 from all areas of the world now
 want a world Communist confer-
 ence as soon as possible."
 The extensive bilateral
 consultations Soviet leaders
 have held over the past two
 weeks with high-level repre-
 sentatives from East Germany,
 Rumania, Bulgaria, and Yugo-
 slavia suggest that Moscow is
 concerned over the lack of uni-
 fied Eastern European support of
 its tactics against the Chinese.
 A senior Finnish Foreign Ministry
 official told the US Embassy that
 on the basis of Tito's remarks
 during his state visit to Fin-
 land, the "sole purpose" of his
 Leningrad meeting with Khru-
 shchev was to discuss tactics
 to be pursued in the dispute

 NEW EVIDENCE OF SOVIET-YUGOSLAV MILITARY COLLABORATION
 Reports that Yugoslavia
 will soon buy "liberal quanti-
 ties" of Soviet military equip-
 ment on long-term credit add to
 the growing evidence of closer
 Soviet-Yugoslav cooperation in
 military affairs.   Yugoslav De-
 fense Secretary Gosnjak and
 others deny, however, that these
 purchases signify agreement on
 matters other than procurement,
 and state that Yugoslavia has
 turned to the Soviets because
 equipment is not available from
 the West.
 The types of arms to be
 purchased have not been publicly
 specified
 Yugoslavia al-
 ready has at least 21 MIG-21s,
 as well as SU-100 self-propelled
 guns and T-54 tanks, and at
 least 14 surface-to-air missiles,
 18 self-propelled twin anti-
 aircraft guns, and 12 clusters
 of Snapper antitank missiles.
 Yugoslav-Soviet cooperation
 is also evidenced by the schedul-
 ing of an official Soviet naval
 visit to Yugoslav ports from 18
 to 25 June.   This is the first
 such visit since October 1957.
 In addition, Soviet Defense
 Minister Malinovsky recently
 spent a week in Yugoslavia. Al-
 though the specific topics dis-
 cussed are unknown, his delega-
 tion included the chief of naval
 intelligence, the leading mili-    25X1
 tary aid official on the General
 Staff, and a leading surface-to-
 air missile expert.
 Yugoslavia will prob
 ably stop short of jeopardizing                                                                       25X1

 its relations with the West by
 any such obvious move as a full
 re-equipment program using So-
 viet arms.   However, the USSR
 will probably seek to translate
 its position as Yugoslavia's
 major military supplier into
 some form of military or politi-
 cal gain.

 The people of Communist
 China, from housewives to gov-
 ernment officials, are now un-
 der strong pressure to spend
 several hours every week study-
 ing Mao Tse-tung's writings for
 spiritual guidance. While rev-
 erence for Mao's works is noth-
 ing new in China, this year's
 unprecedented campaign and Mao's
 increasingly imperious public
 behavior have brought the cult
 of his personality to a level
 which  approaches the sycophancy
 around Stalin during his last
 years.
 The cult of Mao, although
 practiced mainly for domestic
 reasons, serves external pur-
 poses also.   Peiping bases much
 of its claim for ideological
 leadership of the world Commu-
 nist movement on its assertion
 that Mao is the world's greatest
 living Marxist theoretician. To
 Afro-Asians, Mao is presented as
 a symbol of anti-imperialism,
 and his increasingly frequent
 receptions for their representa-
 tives are conducted with much
 pomp and ceremony.
 The drive to imbue people
 with "the thought of Mao" is ap-
 parently being undertaken in the
 belief that it will bolster the
 party's sagging prestige and in-
 crease the people's willingness
 to work hard for little  material
 return.   However, there are prob-
 ably many pragmatic Chinese, in-
 cluding most scientists and tech-
 nicians, who find it hard to
 swallow the demand that Mao's
 writings be studied as if they
 were divine scripture.
 The basic material used in
 the study campaign is  The Se-
 lected Works of Mao Tseiung,
 a four-volume coTT c  on a
 sermonizing essays with titles
 like "On Protracted War," "On
 Contradictions," and "On Prac-
 tice."  Written 15 to 30 years
 ago in a repetitious style and
 dogmatic manner, they abound in
 Maoist homilies:   for example,
 "knowledge comes from experience"
 and--the most famous Maoism of
 all--"power grows from the barrel
 of a gun."
 The "study Mao"  campaign
 is highly organized. In 1963,
 activists were given three-month
 courses in directing "study Mao"
 sessions in factories. By March
 1964, according to Peiping, the
 drive to learn from Mao was
 "sweeping the nation." In April
 the campaign was receiving in-
 tensive treatment in newspapers,
 radio, plays, study classes, and
 public speeches.   Although the
 People's Daily on 26 March in-
 structed party officials to be
 sure that participation was
 strictly "voluntary," such an
 injunction has little meaning
 in China, where social pressure
 for conformity is nearly over-
 powering.
 The campaign emphasizes the
 application of Mao's precepts to
 daily personal and work problems.
 Persons who merely memorize Mao's
 writings are sternly criticized.

 Chinese newspapers are full of
 homely examples of people, such
 as a vegetable vendor and a tele-
 phone operator, who studied Mao
 and now work more efficiently.
 A soldier wavering in his de-
 cision to re-enlist was stirred
 by Mao's words, "the world can
 only be improved through the
 barrel of a gun," and promptly
 signed up for another tour. Work-
 men at a Shanghai shipyard who
 were having trouble fitting a
 steam engine into the hull of a
 fishing boat were said to have
 solved the problem after studying
 Mao's principle of "concentrating
 on the main contradictions."
 Another story tells how a
 soldier absorbed in one of Mao's
 works  did not even look up when
 his troop train passed through
 his native village, which he had
 not seen in many years. Every-
 one is urged to be like this
 soldier, and carry one of Mao's
 works with him at all times to
 read in leisure moments.   And,
 according to Peiping, every house
 should have several conveniently
 placed sets of The Selected
 Works.   Although some
 letup in
 intensity may
 occur,

 Neutralist military forces
 in Laos suffered setbacks this
 week.      Elements under Kong Le
 have withdrawn from positions
 at Muong Kheung,  some ten miles
 north of the Plaine des Jarres,
 while Pathet Lao forces have ap-
 parently regained control of
 Phou Kout, a strategic hill
 guarding the approaches to the
 neutralist stronghold of Muong
 Soui, west of the Plaine.
 In Vientiane,  rightist
 elements appear more dissatis-
 fied than ever with Souvanna
 Phouma's performance as premier.
 They have long distrusted the
 idea of a new Geneva conference,
 which he supports, and are crit-
 ical of his recent statements
 opposing US overflights.  Gen-
 eral Phoumi has hinted that
 there is growing opposition to
 Souvanna within the government
 which could develop  into another
 move against him.  On 10 June
 Kong Le himself expressed frus-
 tration over Souvanna's failure
 to call for foreign aid in the
 face of the Communist advances.
 The neutralist commander told
 the press he wanted increased
 US support, specifically "more
 jet bombers and fighters to de-
 stroy all enemy positions." The
 Pathet Lao are also sharpening
 their criticism of Souvanna.
 They now call him a "traitor to
 Laos" who is beginning to "ex-
 terminate" the Laotian people.
 Diplomatic maneuvering over
 Laos centers on the question of
 a proper forum for internationl
 negotiations.   In a 6 June let-
 ter to the Chinese Communist
 foreign minister, Soviet Foreign
 Minister Gromyko again indicated
 Moscow's agreement to a  full
 14-nation "Geneva" conference on
 Laos.   He said that a 14-nation
 conference could be held in Cam-
 bodia, but added that all 14
 signatories of the 1962 Geneva
 accords must agree to such a
 decision.   The USSR has also en-
 dorsed the Polish proposal for
 six-power consultations, claim-
 ing that these would facilitate
 convening a larger conference
 later.  However, Chinese and
 Pathet Lao insistence that only
 a 14-nation conference is compe-
 tent to settle the Laos problem
 may increase Soviet caution in
 discussions with the UK on the
 Polish plan.
 Peiping's latest official
 statement on Laos, broadcast on
 9 June, reiterated its opposi-
 tion to any negotiations short
 of a full Geneva-type conference,
 which would give the Chinese a
 voice in the proceedings.  Pei-
 ping's displeasure with the Pol-
 ish proposal, implied in its 26
 May statement on Laos, was made
 more explicit.  While Peiping
 stresses the seriousness of the
 situation in Southeast Asia,
 probably in  an attempt to gener-
 ate pressure against US inter-
 vention,  it is apparently in no
 hurry to negotiate and foresees
 lengthy preliminary maneuvers
 before formal talks can start.

 Public disorders in South
 Korea have abated, but President
 Pak Chong-hui now probably faces
 a behind-the-scenes power strug-
 gle that could undermine his
 government.
 To placate his critics,
 Pak has promised to eliminate
 government corruption and punish
 officials guilty of irregulari-
 ties.  He has gradually eased
 restrictions on public activi-
 ties in Seoul, where martial law
 was declared on 3 June to halt
 student demonstrations.   Some
 political observers  fear, how-
 ever, that Pak will prolong mar-
 tial law to eliminate opponents
 of his regime.
 The resignation of Pak's
 strong man, Kim Chong-pil, as
 chairman of the ruling Democrat-
 ic-Republican  Party (DRP) has
 eased the immediate pressure on
 Pak from Kim's enemies both in
 and out of the government.   Kim
 has been the principal target of
 the student demonstrators, who
 are dissatisfied with their eco-
 nomic prospects and oppose a
 settlement normalizing relations

 with Japan.   The one student
 death caused by the demonstra-
 tions has not yet been picked
 up as a new cause.
 Kim is still not completely
 eliminated from the political
 scene, however, and probably will
 attempt to retain behind-the-

 tus.                                                               As a further complication,
 his apparent decline will touch
 off political infighting among
 other politicians hoping to replace
 him.
 The role of senior general
 officers in forcing Kim's ouster
 has increased the influence of
 military figures in politics,
 where they have not been prom-
 inent since Pak re-established
 civilian government last December.
 If the situation worsens, senior
 commanders may rally to Pak's
 support as they did last year to
 prevent the collapse of the
 former military government. Some
 officers, however, might unite
 with politicians to weaken Pak's
 control or even force him out.
 Shastri will supervise foreign

 Nehru did.

 TURKISH INTERVENTION ON CYPRUS DEFERRED
 The threatened Turkish in-
 tervention in Cyprus has been
 deferred.   The invasion forces,
 concentrated in the Iskenderun
 area of southern Turkey, have been
 placed in a more relaxed state
 of readiness.   They have par-
 ticipated in several amphibious
 exercises in recent weeks, how-
 ever, and presumably could
 rapidly carry out any new order
 to intervene.
 Many senior Turkish mili-
 tary and political leaders are
 bitterly disappointed at Prime
 Minister Inonu's acceptance of
 US advice against intervention
 and may exert pressure to re-
 verse his decision.   The Turk-
 ish press has criticized recent
 US actions and anti-US slogans
 --possibly the work of left-
 wing students--have appeared
 on the windows of US installa-
 tions in Ankara.   The press
 and the Turkish public appear
 convinced that the US is com-
 mitted to participate actively
 in obtaining a. "solution" of
 the Cyprus issue.
 Citing the latest Turkish
 threat, the Greek Cypriots early
 this week began to call publicly
 for an urgent meeting of the
 UN Security Council but on 11
 June announced that no formal
 request for a special meeting
 would be made at this time.
 Their motive seems to be to use
 the recent Turkish actions and
 militant speeches to build up
 a. case for eventually demanding
 that UN forces on Cyprus be given
 a broader mission than peace-
 keeping.   The Greek Cypriots
 want the UN troops to assist in
 quelling the Turkish Cypriot
 "rebellion" and to defend Cyprus
 against Turkish invasion.   The
 present UN mandate comes up for
 extension by the Security Council
 in mid-June.
 Greek Cypriot charges
 against Ankara will also be
 used to counter expected com-
 plaints from Turkey and the Turk-
 ish Cypriots regarding the Greek
 Cypriots' recent passage of their
 conscription bill and their an-
 nounced intention to import
 heavy arms.
 The Greek Cypriots have
 begun to draft men for military
 service under the new regulations.
 Rumors still circulate in Nicosia
 that Vice President Kuchuk is
 about to declare certain areas
 of Cyprus either independent or
 Turkish territory and to request
 immediate military assistance
 from Turkey.   Greek Cypriot
 forces have strengthened their
 positions, apparently in prepara-
 tion for a possible Turkish in-
 vasion and probably also for a
 quick attack on Turkish Cypriot
 positions if Kuchuk makes the
 anticipated announcement

 GENERAL STRIKE AGITATES NIGERIA
 A general strike over wage
 issues, starting on 1 June,
 crippled Nigeria's essential
 public services and took on dis-
 tinct political overtones before
 showing signs of crumbling un-
 der government pressure this
 week.   The strike occurred as
 Nigeria's parties were undergo-
 ing a major realignment in prep-
 aration  for the national elec-
 tions due this year.
 After a protracted period
 of delay and, apparently,  inde-
 cision,  federal authorities moved
 abruptly to break the strike.
 On 8 June Prime Minister Balewa
 told the workers bluntly that
 the government would not nego-
 tiate while the strike continued.
 A 48-hour back-to-work ultimatum
 was issued, and troops took over
 key installations in Lagos, the
 federal capital, and other cities.
 By 10 June,  some strikers were
 beginning to return to their
 jobs, although the major union
 leaders had not yet capitulated.
 The strike has subjected
 the federal coalition govern-
 ment--dominated by the conserva-
 tive Northern People's Congress
 (NPC)--to  heavy  new  strains.
 Michael Okpara, premier of south-
 ern Nigeria's Eastern Region and
 leader of the coalition's junior
 partner, the National Convention
 of Nigerian Citizens  (NCNC), has
 begun cautiously to take up the
 workers' cause.   Last week he
 announced that the NCNC has made
 an electoral alliance with the
 opposition party,  the Action
 Group  (AG), which has announced
 "unqualified" support for the
 strikers.
 Okpara is himself embroiled
 with the central government over
 last year's controversial census
 which favored the North.   Both
 the NCNC and the AG are southern-
 based parties, and their alliance
 can only intensify the already
 existing tensions between north-
 ern and southern Nigeria.
 Extremist elements have
 benefited greatly by the strike.
 Such elements in the trade unions
 and in the pro-Communist Social-
 ist Workers and Farmers Party
 have long planned to capitalize
 on growing social discontent to
 develop a national front and
 replace the present regime.   Al-
 though their political position
 is still weak, the strike has
 given them an excellent oppor-
 tunity to contrast the ostenta-
 tious manner of living of most
 high government officials with
 that of the average Nigerian and
 may have strengthened their num-
 bers.

 Two Congo Army (ANC) com-
 panies with some local police

 of the city and have rallied to
 their side a large group of trib-
 al enemies of the rebels. ANC
 commander General Mobutu visited
 Bukavu and organized the various

 /It seems unlikely
 that new equipment and reinforce-

 Premier Adoula has as yet
 been unable to obtain African
 troops from outside the Congo
 to help the ANC after the UN
 troops leave.   If the situation
 deteriorates rapidly,  he may be
 forced to appeal to Belgium for
 military assistance.
 The debacle in Kivu has
 warmed up political activity
 in Leopoldville.   A new politi-
 cal combination,  the African
 Democratic Committee (CDA), was
 formed last week.   It includes
 Minister of Defense Anany, four
 other cabinet ministers, and a
 leader of President Kasavubu's
 key Kongo Central Province ABAKO
 party.  The CDA hopes that Kasa-
 vubu will name one of its leaders
 to head the "transitional" gov-
 ernment which Kasavubu, following
 the recommendation of a consti-
 tutional commission,  is supposed
 to appoint this month to adminis-
 ter the country until new parlia-
 mentary elections.
 Both the CDA group and the
 slow-starting pro-Adoula Rally
 of Congolese Democrats are court-
 ing Katangan support.   The CDA
 in particular hopes to win over
 exiled Katangan leader Moise
 Tshombd.  Anany, who has been
 close to the Belgians, said re-
 cently that he would like to see
 Tshombd as head of the new gov-
 ernment.                                                                               Tshombd on 10 June
 indicated again he was "ready
 to serve"and hinted he would
 ally himself with the CDA. Bel-
 gian officials in Brussels con-
 tinue to promote the idea of a
 government of national reconcilia-
 tion, including both Katangans
 and members of the anti-Adoula
 exile group,  the Committee of
 National Liberation.                    25X1

 EEC COUNCIL OF MINISTERS MEETING
 Last week's meeting of the
 EEC Council of Ministers took
 some far-reaching decisions on
 the Common Market's grain prices
 and relations with Spain and
 Nigeria.
 German instransigence
 forced the Council to set mid-
 December as the new deadline
 for further consideration of
 whether or not to unify support
 prices for grains within the
 Community.   The postponement
 was opposed by the EEC Commis-
 sion, which asserts that re-
 fusal to agree on unified prices
 not only imperils the Community,
 but jeopardizes the Kennedy
 Round trade negotiations.   The
 Commission has sent a  letter to
 the Community's six chiefs of
 state deploring the Council de-
 cision and requesting reconsid-
 eration of the matter before 1
 August.
 There is no assurance that
 West Germany,  facing an election
 next year, will be any more
 agreeable in December to lower-
 ing its grain prices to the lev-
 els proposed by the Community.
 The Commission,  however,  intends
 to apply further pressure in
 Bonn while the elections are
 still far enough off to allow
 Chancellor Erhard some room for
 maneuver.
 Although the French have
 the most to gain from agreement
 on unified prices,  they finally
 agreed to the postponement.
 France may wish to let the Ger-
 mans set a precedent which would
 support the French thesis that
 important national interests
 should not be overridden by Com-
 munity decisions, a point of
 Europe
 view which endangers the Common
 Market treaty's majority-voting
 provision due to come into ef-
 fect on 1 January 1966..   In ad-
 dition, Paris is probably not
 unhappy that--to the extent the
 grain price issue delays the
 Kennedy Round--the blame will
 not be laid to France.
 On a more positive note,
 the Council finally decided to
 open talks with Spain and Ni-
 geria.   The Spanish question
 has been particularly thorny
 because of strong anti-Franco
 feeling in Italy and Benelux
 and resentment over Spanish
 threats of economic reprisal if
 the EEC rejects Spain's bid
 for negotiations.   The wording
 of the Council mandate to the
 Commission--calling for an ex-
 amination of "economic problems
 (for Spain)  resulting from the
 development of the EEC"--appears
 to fall short of the Spanish
 request for EEC association.
 Madrid,  nevertheless,  is report-
 edly pleased with the decision.
 The actual negotiations with
 Spain, however, are likely to
 be prolonged.
 France ended its opposition
 to Nigeria's requests for talks
 looking to some form of associa-
 tion with the EEC, but Paris
 will still have ample opportu-
 nity to throw up roadblocks to
 any final agreement.   The Com-
 mission's mandate to open talks
 about 15 July is partially qual-
 ified by the French reservation
 that any eventual arrangement
 not impair advantages currently
 enjoyed by the 18 African states
 now associated with the EEC.

 While chances now appear fairly
 good that the center-left coali-
 tion will hold together for at
 least a few more months, it will
 continue under severe pressures
 and may face new crises.
 Christian Democratic right-
 wingers remain opposed to most of
 the reforms, and intraparty fac-
 tionalism is building up as the
 party prepares for its congress
 late this month.   In addition,
 some Socialists--including Riccardo
 Lombardi, the influential editor
 of Avanti!--feel that the Christian

 Labor Party chief Harold Wil-
 son appears to have enhanced his
 standing as Britain's prospective
 prime minister during his visit
 to Moscow last week.   Press and
 public reaction in the UK has been
 favorable, and Wilson's visit is
 viewed as giving a further advan-
 tage to the Labor Party in the cur-
 rent pre-election period.   In Mos-
 cow Wilson sought to convey the im-
 pression that he was a responsible
 and imaginative world statesman
 fully abreast of events and better
 able than the present prime minis-
 ter to deal with the Soviet leaders.
 British political observers

 "scooped" Douglas-Home in arrang-
 ing talks with Khrushchev so soon
 after the latter's return from
 Cairo and in sounding out Soviet
 attitudes on the tense Southeast
 Asia situation.   Latest British

 its lead over the Conservatives.
 Luxembourg:   Prospects for
 the early formation of a durable
 coalition government seem to be
 poor.  The present regime, composed
 of the moderately conservative
 Christian Socialists  (PCS) and Demo-
 crats, came out of the 7 June elec-
 tions with only half of the 56 seats
 in parliament.  The Democrats,
 usually identified with business,
 were the big losers and conse-
 quently may be replaced in the
 coalition by the Socialists, who
 won 21 seats, only one less than
 the PCS.   In any event, any coali-
 tion excluding the Socialists
 would probably be fragile.  The 25X1
 Communist Party increased its

 abide by the coalition's reform

 Socialists will press for quick
 action on such specific reforms
 as urban renewal, regional legis-
 lation, and economic planning.

 CUBAN MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS
 Since the first of May, five
 Soviet passenger ships have left
 Cuba for the Soviet Union with
 more than 1,500 passengers on
 board.   Most of the passengers
 appear to be Soviet military per-
 sonnel.
 some may be dependents and Cubans.
 Two Soviet passenger ships ar-
 rived in Cuban ports on 7 June--
 one in Havana and one in Santiago
 de Cuba.
 All four SAM installations
 evacuated in late May have been
 relocated.   Three of the sites
 are within 13 nautical miles of
 Santa Clara in central Cuba, sub-
 stantially improving the defense
 of that important military area,   25X1
 but leaving the Central Naval Dis-
 trict Headquarters at Cienfuegos
 unprotected by SAM defenses. The
 fourth was moved less than a mile
 from its original emplacement at  25X1
 Mariel, west of Havana, probably
 because of local terrain conditions.
 BRITISH GUIANA'S PROSPECTS FOR COALITION GOVERNMENT REMOTE
 The chances that British
 Guiana's three political parties
 can form a coalition government
 are as dim as ever. A proposal
 made last week by Forbes Burnham,
 leader of the Peoples  National
 Congress (PNC), is so far unac-
 ceptable to the other two parties
 --Premier Jagan's Peoples  Pro-
 gressive Party (PPP)  and the United
 Force (UF)  led by Peter D'Aguiar.
 Burnham insists that Jagan call
 in all the arms in the country
 and establish a "national govern-
 ment." The ministries would be
 divided in the ratio of five for
 the PPP, five for the PNC, and
 two for the UF.   He also stresses
 that this government would last
 only until elections are held.
 D'Aguiar, who strongly dis-
 likes Jagan, has flatly refused-
 to participate.   Burnham has
 said he will not proceed with-
 out D'Aguiar and is not likely
 to get him to change his mind.

 TENSION IN ARGENTINA AS LABOR AGITATION
 Political tension contin-
 ues to rise in Argentina as the
 tempers of both employers and
 the general public are begin-
 ning to wear thin over the con-
 tinuing agitation by the Peron-
 ist-dominated General Confeder-
 ation of Labor (CGT).   Despite
 recent government concessions,
 the CGT has announced continu-.
 ation of its "battle plan"
 which heretofore has been high-
 lighted by a series of brief
 sit-down strikes, or "occupa-
 tions," at business establish-
 ments.
 The CGT central committee
 voted on 5 June to continue its
 plan until the government grants
 all of its wide-ranging polit-
 ical  and economic demands.
 BRAZIL'S EX-PRESIDENT KUBITSCHEK
 Brazilian President Cas-
 tello Branco, continuing his
 government's two-month-old
 "clean-up" campaign, signed
 decrees this week canceling the
 political rights of more than
 50 additional prominent politi-
 cians and labor leaders.   Among
 them was ex-President Juscelino
 Kubitschek, now a senator, who
 had been a major contender in
 the presidential election sched-
 uled for October 1965.   Others
 were the governor of Para State,
 Indicative of this polit-
 ical motivation is the fact that
 the CGT decision was made just
 as Congress was winding up action
 on two major CGT demands--a
 minimum wage law and a price
 ceiling on certain common com-
 modities.   The CGT has criti-
 cized both measures as inadequate
 and will try to exert pressure
 on the President, who will set
 the precise wage and price levels
 under the new law.
 LOSES POLITICAL RIGHTS
 several state deputies, and the
 mayor of Belem.
 Although reaction thus far
 to the move against Kubitschek
 has been mixed, public criticism
 has been relatively mild.   The
 government's relations with his
 large Social Democratic Party
 (PSD), however, have been put
 under some strain.   PSD congres-
 sional leaders have issued a
 statement of "solidarity" with
 Kubitschek and emphasized the

 party's independence of the gov-
 ernment bloc.
 Without support from the PSD,
 which holds 116 Of 409 seats in
 the Chamber of Deputies, the ad-
 ministration could have trouble
 putting through some of its major
 reform bills, despite the simpli-
 fied procedures available to the
 President under the "Institutional
 Act."  However, the absence of
 solid support for Kubitschek in
 the PSD and the lack of party dis-
 cipline would tend to offset ef-
 forts by the small hard core of
 Kubitschek followers to achieve
 unified opposition to the govern-
 ment.
 On the other hand, Castello
 Branco has strengthened his posi-
 tion among top military leaders,
 a number of whom had apparently
 been pressing him to nullify
 Kubitschek's political rights.
 They feared that Kubitschek's re-
 election to the presidency would

 olution is seeking to eliminate
 --corruption and Communist influ-
 ence in government.
 The government has not stated
 its reasons for the action against
 Kubitschek, but Castello Branco's
 chief civilian adviser told US
 Embassy officials that well-docu-
 mented justification exists and
 that no final decision had been

 Indications are that addi-

 of political rights will be is-

 expire on 15 June.     Castello                  25X1

 not plan to extend these powers
 beyond that date.
 COLOMBIAN GOVERNMENT MOVES AGAINST COMMUNIST ENCLAVE
 A campaign by the Colombian
 Government to eliminate the Commu-
 nist enclave called Marquetalia is
 going into its second month.   The
 first armed resistance was not en-
 countered until 5 June, but the
 tempo of the fighting is expected
 to increase in the days ahead.
 The Marquetalia Valley, be-
 tween the departments of Tolima and
 Huila, was "proclaimed" by the Com-
 munists in 1960 to be "The Independ-
 ent Republic of Marquetalia." It
 is one of the more recent of five
 regions in central Colombia to come
 under Communist control. Arms and
 ammunition, as well as drugs, cloth-
 ing, and some food are smuggled in-
 to Marquetalia from other parts of
 Colombia.
 The Colombian Communist Party
 (PCC) has protested the army's "in-
 terference" in Marquetalia from the
 beginning.   The protests erupted
 into violence on 7 June when a wave
 of bombings in major Colombian cit-
 ies left at least one person dead
 and several wounded.   Anonymous
 phone calls to newspapers asserted
 that the bombings were reprisals    25X1
 against the Marquetalia campaign
 and indicated that more violence
 would follow.
