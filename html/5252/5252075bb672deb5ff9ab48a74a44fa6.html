 MEXICO
 In a major shift of policy Mexican
 Secretary of National Patrimony Alejo
 announced on Tuesday that Mexico
 would join the Organization of Petroleum
 Exporting Countries as soon as it is in-
 vited and that the country's oil wealth is
 substantially greater than previous
 government statements had indicated.
 Mexico already is marketing its oil at
 OPEC price levels and probably will not
 be constrained in its production policy by
 OPEC membership. On the other hand, if
 Mexico follows through on Alejo's an-
 nouncement and is admitted to OPEC, it
 will be excluded from trade preferences
 under the US trade reform act of 1974.
 Of even greater significance is Alejo's
 statement that Mexican oil reserves
 probably are on the order of 30 to 60
 billion barrels. This would put Mexican
 reserves on a par with Kuwait's and
 roughly three times the proved reserves of
 the US, excluding Alaska.
 Mexico's announced figures are in line
 with our own current estimates of Mex-
 ican reserves. We expect, moreover, that
 with two more years of exploration, Mex-
 ico will confirm reserves at the 60 billion
 barrel level. This would assure a feasible
 production rate of 2.75 million barrels per
 day in 1980 and probably as much as 6
 million barrels per day by 1985.
 convince the international financial com-
 munity that its economic prospects are
 bright.  While the announcement will
 bolster the peso in the short run, the un-
 derlying pressures for devaluation will re-
 main.
 The announcement of its oil potential
 will probably result in domestic pressure
 on Mexico City to pursue a maximum
 development effort. Disaffected groups
 will now probably pressure the govern-
 ment to undertake massive oil-financed
 socio-economic programs. To finance in-
 itial expenditures on the highest priority
 projects and perhaps a 10 to 12 percent
 economic growth rate, Mexico would
 have to increase oil exports to an es-
 timated 4.0 to 4.5 million barrels per day
 by 1985-a level that is feasible given its
 oil potential.
 The election of a new Lebanese presi-
 dent, originally planned for May 1, was
 abruptly  postponed  late  last
 week-primarily at the insistence of leftist
 leader Kamal Jumblatt, who has been ac-
 cusing Syria of exerting unacceptable
 pressure on members of parliament to
 vote for its favored candidate, Ilyas
 Sarkis.
 The vote was rescheduled for May 8,
 but fighting in Beirut throughout most of
 the week and the continuing impasse
 between Jumblatt and Damascus may
 cause further delay.
 To underscore their defiance of the
 Syrians, Jumblatt's leftist forces launched
 a major offensive last weekend against
 Christian positions in Beirut's port dis-
 trict. Heavy fighting involving sharp ar-
 tillery duels had by midweek spread to
 adjacent Muslim neighborhoods and to
 Ashrafiyah, the Christians' only remain-
 ing stronghold in the capital.
 Although   the   Lebanese- Palestin-    25X1
 ian-Syrian truce committee finally an-
 nounced a new cease-fire on May 5,
 Jumblatt's show  of  force  has  left
 Lebanese politicians pessimistic about
 prospects for convening parliament.
 A group of uncommitted parliamentary
 deputies headed by speaker Kamal Asad
 searched all week for an alternative can-
 didate to Sarkis and Jumblatt's choice
 Raymond Edde, who faces stiff opposi-
 tion from Syria. The effort to strike a
 compromise failed, however, because the

 Syrians flatly rejected the idea of a "third
 choice" nomination.
 Palestinian chief Yasir Arafat-who
 has considerable leverage over both
 Jumblatt and the Syrians--holds the key
 to breaking the current impasse. Arafat
 strongly favors holding the elections on
 time.
 Although Arafat has only a slim
 chance of succeeding before the weekend,
 he may be able to win some concessions
 from Damascus that would induce
 Jumblatt to accept Sarkis.
 If Arafat fails, there is little hope for
 elections this week, and it is doubtful that
 the shaky cease-fire will hold up.

 USSR - MIDDLE EAST
 Moscow's latest bid to reverse setbacks
 to its position in the Middle East is a
 government statement, issued on April 28,
 that presses for reconvening of the Geneva
 conference.
 This extensive review of the Soviet posi-
 tion on a settlement is a reminder that the
 USSR has its own program for resolving
 the Middle East conflict. The Russians
 are concerned that abrogation of their
 treaty with Egypt and continued US
 diplomacy in the Middle East-this time
 Ambassador Brown's mission in
 Lebanon-have again conveyed an im-
 pression that Moscow is an outsider look-
 ing in.
 The statement seems timed to keep the
 Geneva forum prominent during dis-
 cussions next month regarding renewal of
 the UN observer force on the Golan
 Heights. The Soviets value their position
 as co-chairman with the US of the Geneva
 conference and have been disappointed
 when the focus of Middle  East
 deliberations has shifted to the UN.
 The moderately worded statement
 opens up the possibility of new Soviet
 flexibility regarding the conference. It
 calls for separating the Geneva talks into
 two stages-the first dealing with
 organizational and procedural problems
 and the second with  substantive issues.
 The Soviets, in effect, are now accepting
 the US proposal for a preliminary session,
 which they rejected late last year. This
 suggests they would be content with even
 a brief meeting as long as it puts Geneva
 back in the limelight.
 The text calls for PLO attendance at
 both stages of the conference, but omits
 earlier phraseology demanding PLO par-
 ticipation "from the very beginning" and
 "on an equal footing" with other parties.
 Soviet officials have privately confirmed
 that the new wording is another indication
 of their flexibility. They have also hinted
 that they would like the Arabs to develop
 a compromise formula that would make
 PLO participation more palatable to the
 US and Israel.
 The Soviets have told US officials that
 the document is not merely for propa-
 ganda purposes, but is an attempt to
 generate real progress toward a settle-
 ment. They have admitted, however, that
 because  of the Arabs'  preoccupation
 with Lebanon and the deadlock over the
 Palestinian  question,  prospects for
 RHODESIA   //  11 I
 Prime Minister Smith's government
 announced  new  military mobilization
 measures last weekend. When fully im-
 plemented they will improve Rhodesia's
 counterinsurgency capabilities, but will
 keep civilians away from vital jobs for
 prolonged periods. Reservists who have
 completed their national service in the
 territorial forces are to be called back to
 duty for an indefinite period. The govern-
 ment also extended the national service
 period for white Rhodesian youths from
 12 to 18 months.
 The  mobilization will probably be
 followed by new operations against the in-
 surgents along the Mozambique border.
 For the most part, Rhodesian forces have
 only been reacting to the guerrilla forays
 since the insurgency intensified in late
 January. An offensive may be intended as
 much to reassure white civilians as to dis-
 rupt  guerrilla  operations,  particularly
 since the insurgents reportedly plan to
 reduce their activities until the current dry
 season ends next fall.
 Tribal and personal rivalries persist
 among Rhodesian black nationalists. The
 factionalism is a serious obstacle to the
 nationalists' efforts over the long term to
 expand the insurgency against the Smith
 government.

 Since the collapse of Joshua Nkomo's
 talks with Smith last March, the rival ex-
 ternal- and internal-based wings of the
 African National Council have continued
 to squabble. Nkomo, the leader of the in-
 ternal faction, apparently has lost con-
 siderable support among Rhodesia's ur-
 ban black population. Bishop Muzorewa,
 the titular leader of the external wing,
 may have gained prestige among urban
 blacks, but his influence within his faction

 NIGERIA 1Z
 Dissension among Nigeria's military
 rulers appears to be growing amid reports
 that the country's reluctant head of state,
 Major General Obasanjo, is still actively
 seeking to resign.
 Several reports
 up
 Supreme Military Council has become ex-
 tremely bitter since the abortive coup last
 February and that the council is badly fac-
 tionalized.
 The fate of the hundred or so alleged
 coup plotters still in custody reportedly
 remains a significant issue in the council.
 The council is said to have received warn-
 ings from several officers that additional
 executions could lead to violence in the
 army.
 During the last two weeks, the Soviets
 entered the international grain market for
 the first time this year by purchasing
 almost 8 million tons of grain from the
 US, Canada, and Australia. Grain
 purchases for delivery from last year's
 crop have now reached 31.8 million tons,
 with another 5.2 million tons scheduled to
 come from this year's harvest.
 Moscow has ordered 4.9 million tons of
 corn and wheat from the US-2.7 million
 tons of corn are from last fall's crop and
 are scheduled for delivery between May
 and October. The Soviets have now ex-
 hausted 6.5 million tons of the 7-million
 ton limit imposed last fall on purchases
 from last year's crop. Purchases above
 this limit require US approval.
 The remaining US grain is from the
 1976 crop and is part of the 6 million tons
 the Soviets are committed to buy under
 the 5-year agreement signed last October.
 Delivery of this grain, as well as the 2
 million tons of wheat bought from
 Canada and I million tons of wheat from
 Australia, will begin after October 1.
 The purchases last week were probably
 prompted by attractive prices and by a
 desire to continue corn deliveries-which
 would have begun to fall off about
 May-during the summer months.

 Soviet grain prospects this year are un-
 certain. Winterkill was above normal, but
 a large spring grain crop could overcome
 these losses. Even with a bumper harvest,
 the USSR may buy substantial amounts
 beyond current commitments in order to
 replenish reserves and get the livestock
 program back on track after last year's

 ITALY       ~-    C

 Party leaders are beginning to plot
 campaign strategy following the collapse
 of the Moro government last week and
 President Leone's decision to dissolve
 parliament and hold an election on June
 20-21.
 Moro resigned on April 30 when it
 became-clear during parliamentary debate
 that his Christian Democratic minority
 government could not survive a vote of
 confidence. President Leone has asked
 him to stay on in caretaker status during
 the campaign.
 The Christian Democratic Party is
 divided and disoriented on the eve of the
 campaign. The Christian Democrats have
 spent most of the time since their party
 congress in March arguing among
 themselves over whether to opt for an ear-
 ly election. As a result, the party has yet
 to fill all of its leadership positions or to
 appoint a campaign manager.
 The Christian Democrats disagree
 among themselves,  moreover, on the
 question that will be at the center of cam-
 paign debate: the future role of the Com-
 munist Party. No Christian Democrats
 are calling  for actual  Communist
 membership in the government, but party
 secretary Zaccagnini and his allies seemed
 willing, during the maneuvering prior to
 Moro's collapse, to grant the Communists
 an indirect role in national policy making.
 Christian Democratic conservatives, led
 by party president Fanfani, will push,
 however, for a tough anti-Communist line
 in the campaign.
 The Lockheed scandal has become a
 problem of major proportions for the
 Christian  Democrats.  Since the
 allegations two weeks ago that a former
 Christian Democratic prime minister had
 accepted a bribe several years ago, the
 Lockheed affair has overshadowed most
 other issues in the media. Despite denials
 from the three Christian Democrats under
 suspicion, the case is generally portrayed
 as the most damaging evidence of Chris-
 tian Democratic corruption unearthed so
 far.
 The Communist and Socialist cam-
 paigns, by contrast, have already begun to
 take shape. While,the Communists and
 Socialists will be competing against each
 other, they are both likely to emphasize
 their  portrayal  of the  Christian
 Democrats as worn out, corrupt, and un-
 responsive to the country's needs after
 thirty years in power.
 The campaign is almost certain to
 produce  further  politically  motivated
 violence by left- and right-wing extremists
 who operate outside the regular political
 viewe  by an increasing number of
 Italians as the only party capable of
 restoring order, appear best positioned to

 FRANCE
 The French helicopter carrier Jeanne
 d'Arc was transferred from the Atlantic
 to the Mediterranean last week, possibly
 as a precaution because of continuing ten-
 sions in the eastern Mediterranean. Ac-
 cording to the commander of France's
 Atlantic squadron, the move was made
 for "operational reasons."
 The carrier, which recently completed a
 tour of duty in the Indian Ocean, was en
 route to the naval base at Brest when it
 was ordered to join the Mediterranean
 fleet. US military attaches in Paris report
 that the Jeanne d'Arc will remain in the

 USSR-CHINA
 The Soviets quickly protested the bomb
 explosion last week at the gates of their
 embassy in Peking, but they apparently
 are not planning to do much more. At
 least two Chinese guards were killed by
 the blast. A Soviet embassy officer in
 Peking said the explosion was apparently
 25X1 the work of "madmen." Although he
 blamed Chinese authorities for creating
 an atmosphere that encouraged such
 behavior, he absolved them of direct
 responsibility.
 Just before the incident, the Soviets had
 published in Pravda a lengthy account of
 all the efforts Moscow says it has made to
 improve relations with China. The ar-
 ticle-signed by I. Aleksandrov, a
 pseudonym indicating high-level spon-
 sorship-was very tough on the Chinese.
 It held out little hope for an improvement
 in Sino-Soviet relations until and unless
 China made concessions.
 The author went back to 1964 to but-
 tress his case that the USSR has been
 conciliatory.  He  reviewed  Soviet
 proposals for a summit, increased cultural
 and economic exchanges, and agreements
 on nonuse of force. Aleksandrov implied
 that Moscow had made its last offer and
 that any additional progress in
 Sino-Soviet relations would be up to the
 Chinese.
 The article said that the USSR was
 willing to resume high-level talks on a
 border settlement and eventually to make
 some territorial adjustments, but would
 not  consider  withdrawing  beforehand
 from territory the Chinese claim.
 Brief references in the article to recent
 political turbulence in Peking focus on
 "Mao and his group" as the "sole source"
 of China's anti-Sovietism. The author's
 message for China's moderates was that
 the USSR recognizes that not all Chinese
 are anti-Soviet and Moscow hopes things
 will improve after Mao goes.
 The events in China have given the
 Soviets fresh reasons for clearly
 delineating their own positions on
 Sino-Soviet relations. In late April, the
 head of the Soviet Foreign Ministry's
 China division, Mikhail Kapitsa, told
 Ambassador Stoessel that the Chinese
 developments were just one more episode
 in an intense struggle for power in Peking.
 He said Mao was behind the downfall of
 Teng Hsiao-ping and the designation of
 Hua  Kuo-feng as  premier.  Kapitsa
 suggested that Moscow is content to stand
 pat until the situation in Peking becomes
 CHINA   q~- J~
 In what appeared to be a calculated
 show of unity, all of the active, Peking-
 based Politburo members except Chair-
 man Mao appeared in the capital for May
 Day festivities. Radio Peking listed them
 in their usual order of rank, indicating no
 changes in the leadership hierarchy.
 This was the first time since Teng
 Hsiao-ping's fall that leading moderates
 Chu Te, Yeh Chien-ying, and Li Hsien-
 nien-all  staunch  supporters  of
 Teng-had appeared with leftists in the
 leadership. All three appeared individ-
 ually on previous occasions.
 In keeping with past May Day prac-
 tices, the leaders broke up into small
 groups to attend celebrations in Peking's
 parks. Each group was composed of a
 careful mix of moderate and leftist
 leaders.
 Heightened security procedures, in the
 wake of the Peking demonstrations of
 April 5, made this a less festive May Day
 than usual. Peking's failure to issue a
 comprehensive name list of party, govern-
 ment, and military leaders in attendance
 may have been designed to obscure the
 absence of some lesser officials, such as
 the minister of education, who may have
 fallen victim to the anti-Teng campaign.

 In a departure from their usual practice the Soviets have
 appointed a civilian, Politburo member Dmitry Ustinov, as
 defense minister. The speed with which they acted to replace the
 late Marshal Grechko suggests that they were anxious to avoid
 politicking over the post.
 5Jef - 5-S
 USSR: Ustinov as Defense Minister
 The prompt appointment o  Party
 Secretary Dmitry Ustinov as minister of
 defense-announced  only  hours after
 Marshal Grechko's ashes had been in-
 terred in the Kremlin wall-suggests that
 the Soviet leadership was anxious to head
 off any politicking over the selection of
 Grechko's successor.
 The choice of Ustinov, a civilian, is
 almost certain to provoke an adverse
 reaction among elements of the high com-
 mand opposed to the idea that a non-
 professional should hold the top post in
 the ministry. Ustinov may have been less
 objectionable to individual members of
 the high command, however, than one or
 another of the potential military can-
 didates would have been.
 As a civilian, Ustinov, will probably
 have a somewhat different outlook on
 defense matters than would a professional
 soldier. His background in the armaments
 field and in industry may facilitate a
 better integration of strategic planning
 with resource allocation, research and
 development, armaments programming,
 and national mobilization than would be
 possible under a career military man.
 The appointment of Ustinov carries one
 step further the trend evident during the
 last several years in the creation of
 positions at the deputy minister level for
 new technology and for systems analysis.
 Although the full implications are not
 clear, the changes have probably enabled
 the ministry to assume a larger role in the
 management of the defense effort-a
 preserve of the General Staff in the past.
 In fact, Ustinov may decide to concen-
 trate on resource management, while
 delegating to subordinates-primarily the
 General Staff and the force com-
 manders-much of the direct supervision
 previous defense ministers have exercised
 over operational matters. Ustinov's lack
 of experience in military operational
 matters will make it necessary in any case
 for him to rely heavily on military
 professionals for their operational judg-
 ment.
 Because he is unencumbered by service
 loyalties, Ustinov may be expected to
 weigh more impartially the claims on
 resources and the advice on defense
 matters offered by the various members
 of the high command. He might tend to
 favor modern strategic weapons, but this
 would not necessarily work to the advan-
 tage of the Strategic Rocket Forces; Usti-
 nov might be more favorably disposed
 toward the navy's submarines equipped
 with SLBMs or other nuclear missiles.
 Ustinov's appointment will probably
 not affect the Soviet position on SALT or
 M BFR negotiations. His views on SALT,
 in which he has been involved, are
 probably as tough. as were Grechko's, and
 Ustinov will probably be careful to avoid
 offending the military under him by show-
 ing any signs of softness on MBFR.
 The appointment of Ustinov has also
 allowed the Soviet leadership to sidestep
 the question of whether a military
 successor to Marshal Grechko should in-
 herit his Politburo seat. It is uncertain
 whether  Ustinov's expected departure
 from the Party Secretariat will result in
 the addition of a new face to that body or
 the elevation of a "junior" party secretary
 to the Politburo as a candidate or full
 member,
 General Kulikov, the chief of the
 General Staff, could still succeed Ustinov
 at a later date, Unlike most professional
 soldiers at the top of the military
 hierarchy, Kulikov, who is only 55, would
 still be relatively young even if Ustinov

 Defense Minister Ustinov (in uniform) appears with senior Politburo members at the Lenin
 Mausoleum during May Day celebrations;
 were to serve as minister for several years.
 The other top military leaders-Marshal
 Yakubovsky and Generals Tolubko,
 Sokolov, and Pavlovsky-are in their 60s,
 and their chances for the top post will
 diminish as Ustinov's term continues.
 For the moment, however, Ustinov's
 appointment means that the military have
 been left without one of their own on the
 Politburo. Although Ustinov has an ex-
 tensive background in defense production
 and has been promoted one grade from
 his wartime rank to General of the Army,
 he is not a professional soldier and has not
 had any command experience. He is much
 more akin to KGB Chairman Andropov
 than to Foreign Minister Gromyko-both
 of whom became Politburo full members
 with Marshal Grechko in April 1973.
 Consequently, Ustinov's appointment
 could create a number of problems for the
 nation's system of command and control
 over its armed forces. Part of the solution,
 in addition to the delegation of command
 responsibility downward within the
 ministry, may be to have Brezhnev, or his
 successor, acquire some formal command
 authority over the armed forces in
 peacetime.
 To date, Brezhnev has been the leader

 arrangement has probably been accept-
 able to both the political leadership and
 the military hierarchy while a professional
 soldier headed the Defense Ministry, but
 Ustinov's appointment may prompt the
 military to argue even more strongly for
 the creation of a unified military-political
 command with Brezhnev, or his successor,

 It will be another bad year for the Brazilian economy.
 Inflation is again on the rise, in spite of government efforts to
 contain it, and foreign exchange reserves are falling. In real
 terms. there will be little economic growth.
 6 ~-72--
 BraziL? Economy Facing Another Bad Year
 The  Brazilian economy is having
 another difficult year because of import
 constraints and tight credit forced on it by
 the energy crisis and by the subsequent
 world recession.  Foreign exchange
 reserves continue to decline, inflation is
 again on the rise, and there will probably
 be little real economic growth this year.
 These trends, which have alarmed
 Finance Minister Simonsen in particular,
 will prompt the government to maintain
 tight economic controls at least during the
 rest of this year, although it may relax
 them somewhat as municipal elections ap-
 proach next fall.
 Import Controls
 Brazilian authorities have relied heavily
 on direct import controls to cope with per-
 sistent  balance-of-payments  deficits.
 Tariffs have been increased sharply on
 many goods, and a one-year, non-
 interest-bearing deposit with the Central
 Bank equaling 100 percent of imported
 value is now required for nearly half of the
 country's total imports. Public in-
 stitutions have been ordered to cut im-
 ports 25 percent this year. Many con-
 sumer imports are prohibited. Finally, the
 Bank of Brazil has been given broad
 authority to deny import licenses.
 Brasilia continues to consider a major
 devaluation, but it would prefer to avoid
 one despite evidence that some major ex-
 ports-notably soybeans-are hurt by the
 prevailing exchange rate.  "Small"
 devaluations have been stepped up, but
 Finance Minister Simonsen
 they reflect increased domestic inflation
 rather than a fundamental adjustment.
 A major devaluation would have a large
 inflationary impact. The authorities also
 fear that the exchange-rate losses suffered
 by Brazilian borrowers abroad would in-
 hibit further borrowing and reduce the
 vital inflow of foreign capital. As a partial
 alternative to devaluation, new export
 subsidies are being considered.
 Impact on Domestic Economy
 Brasilia is trying to restrain domestic
 economic activity by classic fiscal and
 monetary means. The federal budget has
 been kept in balance or in surplus for the
 past few years despite the repeated use of
 tax cuts to stimulate selected industries.
 Growth in the money supply greatly ex-
 SECRET
 ceeded target levels last year because of
 emergency credits to farmers, as well as
 those to bankers which overcame a li-
 quidity crisis in the commercial paper
 market. Much of this excess liquidity has
 now been eliminated.
 Central Bank operations have been
 cautious. Commercial bank reserve re-
 quirements have been raised, as have the
 rates at which they can borrow from the
 Central Bank. Interest rates and yields on
 treasury bills have risen to record levels.
 Import restraints have yet to have their
 full impact on the domestic economy.
 Inventories thus far have been adequate to
 compensate  for  reduced  purchases
 abroad. Consumer spending during the
 first quarter of 1976 was about 10 percent
 higher than the depressed level of a year
 ago, and industrial production was sub-
 stantially above the first three months of
 1975.
 Crop prospects also are good this year,
 with the exception of the frost-damaged
 coffee crop. Brazil expects record harvests
 of soybeans, corn, and probably wheat.
 The import and credit controls are
 beginning to pinch, however, and inven-
 tories are now being exhausted. Manufac-
 turing firms are dropping some product
 lines and modifying others because im-
 ported materials are scarce or impossible
 to obtain. Business firms are having in-
 creasing trouble raising working capital,
 and consumers are also facing tighter
 credit. Not only is domestic credit shrink-
 ing, but many firms are also having dif-

 ficulty borrowing abroad.
 Despite the slowing of business activity,
 government officials continue to predict
 publicly that the economy will achieve
 something close to the 4-percent growth it
 had last year.
 Inflation
 Inflation has increased. Retail prices in
 Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo rose nearly
 40 percent over the past 12 months. If this
 trend continues, Brazil will suffer its worst
 inflation in almost 10 years. Large wage
 increases, averaging almost 40 percent
 over the past year, account for much of
 the price rise. Higher costs resulting from
 increased tariffs and the heavy interest on
 import deposits have also contributed.
 Further inflation and a deteriorating
 job market are likely to lead to another
 strong showing by the opposition party in
 the municipal elections in November. The
 Geisel administration is anxious to avoid
 such an embarrassment, which would
 complicate the President's effort to con-
 vince his hard-line military critics that
 Brazil is ready to move back. toward
 democratic government. Geisel's current
 effort to relax repression and to develop a
 more open political process already is in
 trouble; a weak showing in November
 could only add to his problems.
 Brasilia has just announced a 44-per-
 cent increase in the minimum wage. In
 real terms, this is much less than the in-
 crease of May 1975, but it is considerably
 more generous than the adjustment
 granted in 1974 when the government also
 was combating resurgent inflation. The
 administration apparently feels compelled
 to make some concessions to political ex-
 pediency despite its decision to maintain
 its stabilization program essentially in-
 tact.
 Balance of Payments Unimproved
 The balance of payments has shown lit-
 tle improvement so far this year. Even
 with import controls, Brazil lost about
 $700 million in foreign reserves during the
 first quarter. Its credit standing abroad,
 while still strong, has declined noticeably
 over the past two years. Brasilia knows
 that it cannot afford to allow this trend to
 continue.
 The balance of payments will probably
 improve gradually during the coming
 months, as reviving economic activity
 abroad helps to expand exports while im-
 ports remain under control. Export
 growth is likely to be slow, however; the
 value of coffee exports will increase
 because of booming prices, but sugar ex-
 ports will suffer following last year's poor
 crop and much lower prices. Lower prices
 also will affect soybean exports.
 Manufactured exports have yet to recover
 from last year's stagnation.
 Balance-of-payments constraints will
 continue well beyond this year. Brazilian
 authorities have indicated that they intend
 to maintain the import deposit require-
 ment until the end of 1977. Some import
 controls probably will be required even
 longer because rapidly rising debt service
 payments will slow the growth of Brazil's
 import capacity for some years.
 Brasilia plans to cope with continuing
 import constraints by encouraging import
 substitution industries and by stimulating
 agriculture and light consumer goods in-
 dustries. These adjustments are likely to
 require considerable time, however, and
 Brazil's economic growth will continue to
 suffer from import constraints for some
 years. Moreover, the rapid development
 of capital-intensive import substitution in-
 dustries  probably  will  strain  Brazil's
 capacity to finance large investments, and
 strong inflationary pressures are likely to
 continue. Supply difficulties and persis-
 tent inflation will make it hard for the
 Brazilian economy to regain the high
 growth rates that marked the       70s.

 Peking is preparing to open an embassy in Fiji and is show-
 ing interest in the small countries of the southern Pacific. The
 Chinese are probably motivated mainly by concern over Soviet
 activities in the area.
 China is showing greater interest in the
 smaller nations of the southern Pacific.
 An advance team from the Chinese
 Foreign Ministry is in Suva, the capital of
 Fiji, making arrangements to open an em-
 bassy. It will be the only communist
 diplomatic mission in any of the five
 nations collectively referred to as the
 southern Pacific island countries-Fiji,
 Western Samoa, Papua New Guinea,
 Nauru, and Tonga. China established for-
 mal ties with both Fiji and Western
 Samoa last November, At that time Pek-
 ing indicated that it would post an am-
 bassador to Suva and also accredit him to
 Western Samoa.
 Prime Minister Somare of Papua New
 Guinea would visit China sometime in
 May, at which time diplomatic relations
 would be established. The Chinese will
 probably not be invited to send a resident
 ambassador to Port Moresby, however.
 Government officials there have been
 complaining that they are hard pressed to
 service the handful of diplomatic missions
 already in the Papua New Guinean
 capital.
 Some Chinese initiative toward Nauru
 may also be forthcoming. The president
 of Nauru met with the Chinese am-
 bassador in Bangkok during the course of
 2      76
 China: Interest in the South Pacific
 the annual meeting of the UN Economic
 and Social Commission for Asia and the
 Pacific. This was the first known
 high-level contact  between  the
 governments of Nauru and China; Nauru
 and Tonga have official ties with Taiwan.
 The Chinese moves are probably linked
 to concern over Soviet activities in the
 southern Pacific region.
 Soviet activity in the area has increased
 in the past few years but is still quite
 limited. Three Soviet cruise ships par-
 ticipate in the inter-island tourist trade
 during the summer months, and Soviet
 oceanographic research ships conduct oc-
 casional surveys.
 Last month, US officials on the scene
 reported that the Soviets have been woo-

 other things,  the prospect of Soviet
 economic  assistance  and   increased
 trade.
 The Chinese, once they are settled in
 the new embassy in Suva, are likely to
 concentrate on learning more about such
 Soviet activities. Local officials will un-
 doubtedly be getting their fill of an-
 ti-Soviet rhetoric from Peking's represen-
 tatives. The Chinese leadership has
 probably brought up its concerns with
 New Zealand Prime Minister Muldoon,
 who is currently in Peking, and will
 probably do the same with Australian
 Prime Minister Fraser when he arrives in
