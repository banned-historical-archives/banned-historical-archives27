 VIETNAM
 The large voter turnout for South Vietnam's election
 of a constituent assembly on 11 September demonstrated
 the government's organizational ability and dealt a
 sharp blow to Viet Cong prestige.   Buddhist opposition to
 the election also proved ineffectual.   Allied military
 operations made little contact with Communist forces
 this past week,  and combat activity was generally light
 despite the stepped-up Viet Cong antielection terrorism.

 Far East
 VIETNAM
 The large voter turnout for
 South Vietnam's election of a
 constituent assembly on 11 Sep-
 tember demonstrated the govern-
 ment's organizational ability
 and dealt a sharp blow to Viet
 Cong prestige.   The climax in
 Communist terrorism designed to
 disrupt the voting resulted in
 nearly 200 casualties during a
 24-hour period beginning on
 election eve.   However, neither
 this nor the boycott by militant
 Buddhists made a significant dent
 in the voter turnout.   Four
 fifths of the nation's 5,288,000
 registered voters went to the
 polls.   While about two thirds
 of Saigon's voters cast ballots,
 the turnout was considerably
 higher in government-controlled
 areas in the provinces.
 There has been no evidence
 of significant election irregu-
 larities favoring specific can-
 didates in any area, but there
 may have been some government
 pressure to get out the vote in
 the provinces.   Some voters an-
 ticipated trouble with the
 government after the election if
 they could not prove they had
 voted.   However, the large turn-
 out was a tribute to the govern-
 ment's over-all effort,  including

 formation programs and its secu-
 rity provisions during the polling

 it begins its constitution draft-
 ing duties on 26 September.   The
 117 delegates include several
 nationally known politicians
 from the Saigon area.   Southerners
 and Buddhists will form plurali-
 ties in terms of regional and
 religious background, with
 Catholics also well represented.
 Nearly half the delegates are
 business and nongovernment pro-
 fessional men.   Thirty-six gov-
 ernment personnel--18 military
 men and 18 civil servants--were
 also elected.
 Militant Buddhist antielec-
 tion hunger strikes conducted in
 Saigon and several other cities
 attracted little public attention,
 and no serious Buddhist efforts
 were made to disrupt the voting.
 On election day, moderate Bud-
 dhist leader Tam Chau broadcast
 an appeal urging the faithful
 to the polls,  and voting was
 brisk in strong Buddhist areas
 in Saigon.   Invalid ballots,
 which the people were urged to
 cast by the Buddhists as an al-
 ternative to an outright boycott,
 averaged about ten percent in
 Hue and Da Nang, where militant
 Buddhist influence is particu-

 Buddhists have been clearly look-
 ing for a compromise settlement.
 Buddhist Institute policy appears
 to be once more in a state of
 flux.
 Communist Reactions
 Communist propaganda reac-
 tion to the successful election
 employed the same note of deri-
 sion that characterized pre-
 election treatment.
 A Viet Cong radio commentary
 doggedly reiterated the claim
 that the Liberation Front con-
 trols 10  million of the country's
 14 million people, and described
 the government's voter registra-
 tion total of more than 5 million
 as fraudulent and the assembly
 as meaningless.
 In several lengthy commen-
 taries, Hanoi news media con-
 demned the election as a "farce"
 and pointed to a series of al-
 leged irregularities in the elec-
 tion process to demonstrate that
 it was  "rigged up by the US and
 the Thieu-Ky clique."   Moreover,
 the DRV media attempted to dis-
 count the validity of the election
 by claiming that the Liberation
 Front was "the only one genuine
 representative of the South Viet-
 namese people."
 Both Peking and Moscow propa-
 ganda quoted from the Hanoi com-
 mentaries on the election and
 went on to claim that it was a
 "fraud concocted with figures"
 and a "farce directed by Ameri-
 can bayonets."
 Military Operations
 Allied military operations
 seeking out Communist forces
 made little contact during the
 past week, with combat activity
 generally light despite the
 stepped up Viet Cong antielec-
 tion terrorism.
 There are indications that
 the 610th North Vietnamese/Viet
 Cong Division has once again be-

 DUTCH- INDONESIAN CLAIMS DISPUTE SETTLED
 The Dutch-Indonesian claims
 settlement of 7 September removes
 the major obstacle to expanded eco-
 nomic and cultural relations be-
 tween the two countries.
 The Netherlands' claim for
 its seized property was scaled
 down during prolonged negotiations
 from over $1 billion to $167 mil-
 lion.   The Dutch simultaneously
 declared their willingness to ex-
 tend further economic aid to Indo-
 nesia.
 The settlement reflects the
 pressure of Dutch business circles
 on the Cals government to clear
 the way for business expansion in
 Indonesia.   Nevertheless, Dutch
 interests are expected to go slow
 in investing in businesses requir-
 ing any considerable importation of
 capital equipment into Indonesia
 until the Djakarta regime becomes
 more firmly established than at
 present.
 Since the final settlement
 of the West Irian issue in 1962,
 and the subsequent transfer of the
 territory to Indonesian control,
 relations between the two countries
 have improved considerably.   Dip-
 lomatic relations, which had been
 broken in 1960, were reopened in
 1963.   Trade has expanded and,  in
 fact,  in the first quarter of 1966
 a single Dutch firm purchased over
 half of Indonesia's total exports.

 CHINA'S RED GUARDS SHIFT ATTACK TO LOCAL PARTY FIGURES
 The tactics of Communist
 China's Red Guards have shifted
 from general denunciations of
 antisocialist and capitalist
 tendencies to more specific at-
 tacks on veteran officials in
 municipal, provincial, and re-
 gional party committees through-
 out the country.   In many in-
 stances, beleaguered local party
 leaders have fought back by or-
 ganizing popular resistance.
 Disorders are said to have
 taken place in at least 15 cities
 in all parts of China.   Accordin
 to press accounts,
 E7 municipal party officials
 in the Kwangsi city of Kuei-lin
 managed to organize a counter-
 demonstration of 100,000 local
 people when Red Guards attempted
 to arrest a vice mayor.   Troops
 were called in to put down the
 disturbance.
 Serious clashes,
 involving several deaths and at-
 tacks on important party figures,
 were also reported in Sian, Lan-
 chou, and Harbin.
 There are no indications
 yet that leading party officials
 in any of these trouble spots
 have been disciplined by Peking,
 but this is probably only a mat-
 ter of time.   In the only public
 acknowledgment of the new disor-
 ders, the People's Daily declared
 in an editorial on 11 September
 that "responsible persons in
 some localities and some units
 have openly defied" directives
 from the central committee and
 Mao Tse-tung.   It said that such
 persons have "incited a number of
 workers and peasants who have not
 known the truth to oppose and
 antagonize the revolutionary
 students."   The editorial then
 called on workers and peasants
 to avoid being drawn into fight-
 ing against the Red Guards for
 any pretext.   The main job of
 these Red Guards,  it said, re-
 peating recent statements by Lin
 Piao,  is to bring down "those in
 authority who are taking the
 capitalist road."
 These startling events and
 pronouncements are further evi-
 dence that the new leadership is
 using the Red Guards in its move
 against opponents in the regular
 party apparatus throughout the
 country.

 USSR MAINTAINS FOREIGN PURCHASING PROGRAMS

 these programs are no longer held

 the next few years apparently
 will cost at least $200-300 mil-

 This need to use scarce hard
 currency to finance grain pur-
 chases detracts from other So-

 however, Moscow has continued
 contracting for Western indus-
 trial plants throughout the pre-

 had been a noticeable slackening

 open.   The previous day's issue
 had referred to the security issue
 as the topic of recent talks be-
 tween Brezhnev and East Germany's
 Walter Ulbricht.
 Through a recent series of
 diplomatic demarches to various
 West European countries,  the So-
 viets have sought--with a notable
 lack of success--to project an
 image of sincerity and flexibility
 on the subject of European secu-
 rity. There are no signs, however,
 that Moscow is preparing any sig-
 nificant departure from the seven-
 point pronouncement put forth after
 the Warsaw Pact meeting this sum-
 mer at Bucharest.   The Bucharest
 declaration--which the 12 Septem-
 ber Izvestia editorial cited--
 called for a phased abolition of
 the NATO and Warsaw Pact military
 organizations and for reductions
 of the two German armies in a
 troop-reduction package that would
 include foreign troop withdrawals.
 The Soviets repeatedly have made
 clear, however,  that the existence
 of "two German states" with their
 present boundaries is to be a point
 of departure, not for discussion,
 in any talks on new security ar-
 rangements for Europe.
 The Izvestia editorial went
 further in clarifying fying Moscow's
 view of the US role in European
 security than any Soviet statement
 since the idea of a conference was
 revived at the 23rd Soviet Party
 Congress in March.   The editorial
 rejected the idea that the US would
 be deprived "fully of the rights to
 take part in the solution of Euro-
 pean problems."   Izvestia charged,
 however, that Was in~inggton wants to
 deny Europeans the right to solve
 their own problems,  and reiterated
 the idea of a round-table confer-
 ence of "all European states" as
 the first step to be taken.   Pre-
 viously,  Soviet spokesmen have
 given the impression publicly that
 the US had no part to play, while
 acknowledging privately that US
 views must be considered and that the
 US must be a party to any settle-
 ment of European security problems.
 This latest Soviet overture
 is cast in terms which are bound
 to elicit a West German rejection.
 Bonn has long insisted that it will
 not participate in any European
 talks at which East Germany is pres-
 ent and Washington is not.   The ap-
 proach by the Soviets thus is in keep-
 ing with the line Moscow has pur-
 sued in recent months of encourag-
 ing the impression that is is will-
 ing to engage in fruitful discus-
 sions of European security, while
 portraying Bonn  (backed by Washing-
 ton)  as the sole obstacle to get-
 ting such discussions under way.
 Moscow is trying to generate pres-
 sure on Washington and Bonn to
 abandon plans for a West German
 role in NATO nuclear-sharing ar-
 rangements rather than prejudice
 the prospect of detente with the
 Soviet Union..   It is clear that the
 issue of West German access to nu-
 clear weapons,                                                                                rather than European
 security per se,  is the paramount

 INCREASING POLITICAL FRAGMENTATION I N SYRIA
 The recent wave of arrests
 and charges of "imperialist-
 backed" plotting in Damascus re-
 flect the increasing political
 fragmentation of the radical
 Baathist military regime.
 Leaders of the Syrian Gen-
 eral Confederation of Labor Un-
 ions have taken advantage of the
 uncertain situation to inaugurate
 a series of arrests of "reaction-
 ary" officials within national-
 ized business establishments.   A
 number of these officials have
 been brutally beaten by union
 goon squads.   Although the govern-
 ment is said to oppose the cam-
 paign,  it apparently feels too
 weak at the moment to put a stop
 to the purges.
 The regime claimed last week
 that it had crushed two reaction-
 ary coup attempts within 48 hours.
 Major Salim Hatum, the commando
 leader who had triggered the Feb-
 ruary coup which brought the pres-
 ent junta to power, was accused
 of plotting in collusion with mem-
 bers of the ousted moderate faction
 of the Baath Party.   He has fled to
 Jordan with a number of his lieu-
 tenants and was granted political
 asylum.
 Several members of the former
 regime had escaped from prison two
 weeks ago.   They have not yet sur-
 faced, but presumably are in Leba-
 non.   They may try to set up a new
 international Baathist organiza-
 tion.   Such a step would pose se-
 rious problems for the Syrian re-
 gime in its own efforts to elect a
 new international leadership of
 the party and maintain its legiti-
 macy as a Baathist government.
 Religious as well as personal
 and ideological rivalries have
 played a large part in the recent
 intraregime conflicts.   Hatum, a
 member of the minority Druze sect,
 has opposed the ascendancy of mem-
 bers of the rival minority Alawite
 sect within the military.   The
 Sunni Muslims--who constitute a
 majority of the Syrian population--
 resent the present influence within
 the army of both minority groups.
 The curfew imposed last week
 has been lifted, and Damascus is
 calm for the moment.   Nevertheless,
 the continuing conflicts will pro-
 mote further instability,  and the
 situation remains extremely fragile.
 However,  any military faction which
 comes out on top will maintain an
 anti-Western posture and Syria's
 present close ties with the USSR

 THE NEW EGYPTIAN CABINET
 Nasir's dumping of the Muhi
 al.-Din cabinet last. weekend and
 the appointment of Muhammad Sidqi
 Sulayman, former High Dam minis-
 ter, to head a cabinet of tech-
 nicians appears to be a victory
 for the more doctrinaire "Arab
 Socialist" elements in the Cairo
 regime.
 The timing of the cabinet
 change seems significant.   Former
 prime minister Muhi al-Din and
 former minister of finance and
 economy Qaisuni had been holding
 conversations with officials of
 the International Monetary Fund
 and with Western financial repre-
 sentatives about additional sup-
 port for Egypt's sagging economy.
 Both men had the confidence of
 the Western financial community,
 a factor noticeably lacking in
 their replacements.   Nasir seems
 to be unwilling to pay the in-
 ternal political price necessary
 for him to reach agreement with
 the IMF and World, Bank.   He ap-
 pears to be reverting to an em-
 phasis on more industrialization,
 greater central direction, and
 "Arab Socialism."
 The Soviets think that Su-
 layman is an efficient adminis-
 trator based on their contacts
 with him as High.Dam minister,
 and Cairo may hope that his ap-
 pointment will loosen up Moscow's
 purse strings.   Moscow,  however,
 has indicated nc;particular en-
 thusiasm for the,change, possibly
 an indication that they may
 be concerned over its economic
 implications.
 Cairo's official line is
 that the cabinet change signifies
 no political shift, but a move
 economic realm.

 FRANCE'S RELATIONS WITH NORTH AFRICA
 The current trial in Paris
 of suspects in the disappearance
 of exiled Moroccan opposition
 leader Mehdi Ben Barka may have
 more serious diplomatic conse-
 quences than France's earlier im-
 broglios with Algeria and Tunisia.
 Relations with Algiers and Tunis
 are now coming back to normal,
 but a complete break with Rabat
 is a fair possibility.
 French-Moroccan relations
 cooled sharply early in 1966 when
 Paris publicly took the position
 that the Ben Barka "killing" was
 directed by Moroccan Interior
 Minister Oufkir. At that time,
 King Hassan supported Oufkir's
 denials of involvement and re-
 fused to cooperate in the prelim-
 inary investigation.   Quai offi-
 cials are hopeful that, even if
 Oufkir is convicted in absentia
 at the trial, the decision will
 be ignored by both governments.
 French circles in Rabat are more
 pessimistic, however, and fear
 that the government there will
 come under nationalistic pressure
 to react strongly to an attack on
 a Moroccan minister, break diplo-
 matic relations,  and nationalize
 farm properties owned by French
 interests.
 A variety of short-term
 problems have been plaguing
 Paris'  relations with Algiers.
 Negotiations on mutual financial
 and economic claims broke down in
 April.   Algeria nationalized
 French mining properties and took
 over properties abandoned by
 French nationals.   France then
 blocked its untied aid to Al-
 geria, and Algeria stopped pay-
 ments on its current debts to
 France.
 Algeria's unwillingness to
 discuss outstanding claims item
 by item may be tempered by the
 upcoming French National Assembly
 debate on the budget, which in-
 cludes proposed aid to Algeria
 for 1967.
 Since Tunisia nationalized
 French-owned agricultural lands
 in May 1964 without provision
 for full compensation, French
 economic aid has been cut off and
 technical assistance curtailed.
 In the spring of 1966, France be-
 gan to "defrost" its relations
 by granting tariff-free quotas
 for certain Tunisian exports, ex-
 tending a long-term loan, re-
 newing a cultural and technical
 protocol, and signing a social
 security agreement.
 Tunisia took a major step in
 July toward meeting the French
 demand for compensation by agree-
 ing to supply wine to France. The
 proceeds of the transaction will
 be credited to French landowners'
 claims against Tunisia.   The com-
 pensation problem remains a
 thorny one because estimates of
 the extent of compensation due
 vary considerably.   Paris has
 made clear that a request for aid
 would be premature.

 CONSTITUTIONAL TALKS BEGIN IN NIGERIA,
 Twenty-eight representatives
 of Nigeria's four regions and the
 federal territory of Lagos met
 this week in the capital under
 heavy security guard for talks on
 the country's political and con-
 stitutional future.   Two terror-
 ist bombings on the eve of the
 Lagos conference added to the
 psychological tension, but most
 delegates appeared determined to
 press for some form of loose as-
 sociation which would prevent
 fragmentation of the country.
 In his opening speech Supreme
 Commander Gowon suggested that the
 conference rule out either the
 complete breakup of the country
 or the creation of a unitary
 state.   He offered four options:
 a federal system with a strong
 central government; a federation
 with reduced powers at the center;
 a confederation; and some "new"
 form of association peculiar to
 Nigeria.   Gowon asked the dele-
 gates to make broad recommenda-
 tions consistent with the degree
 of agreement reached in their
 regions.
 The East favors a loose fed-
 eration with some common services
 and a regionalized police and
 army;  the West a strong federation
 of eight states,  formed along
 ethnic and linguistic lines;  and
 the North and Mid-West a federa-
 tion.   Since the North and East
 appear to have the decisive in-
 fluence, the conference will prob-
 ably recommend some form of loose
 federation comprising four vir-
 tually autonomous regions.   Never-
 theless, resolution of such is-
 sues as the structure and control
 of the army will be difficult, as
 will the matter of guarantees for
 the security of the Eastern re-
 gion's Ibo people, who have been
 the principal victims of Northern
 aggression.   Redistribution of
 oil revenues is also likely to
 become a touchy question, with
 the East insisting on a larger
 share.
 Both the North and East have
 problems with minority groups
 within their boundaries which are
 pressing for greater autonomy or
 the creation of smaller states
 within the region.   Eastern mili-
 tary governor Ojukwu and his ad-
 visers believe they have controlled
 minority separatist sentiment by
 agreeing to divide the East into
 12 provincial units, each with
 its own executive and administra-
 tive authority.   The region's cen-
 tral government will have a bi-
 cameral legislature based on
 equality of representation from
 each unit.   In the North, mili-
 tary governor Katsina has an-
 nounced plans foz a devolution of
 power to minority groups at the
 provincial level.
 Tension has eased somewhat
 in the Northern capital of Kaduna
 where unruly Northerner army ele-
 ments have joined with civilians
 in harassing and attacking Ibos.
 No new incidents have been re-
 ported there since last week.
 Ibos continued their exodus from
 Lagos and Kaduna, and any new
 flare-up in Northern depredations

 SOUTH AFRICA'S NEW PRIME MINISTER
 South Africa's new prime min-
 ister, John Vorster, was justice
 minister in the late Hendrik Ver-
 woerd's cabinet, and he is a neo-
 phyte in the international field.
 His handling of several foreign
 policy issues in the near future
 will indicate whether he intends
 to pursue South Africa's objec-
 tives with the subtlety which was
 emerging in the last month of Ver-
 woerd's tenure, or whether he will
 operate more dogmatically,  as
 many observers believe.
 South Africa will come under
 attack in the United Nations later
 this month over its relationship
 with South-West Africa  (its League
 of Nations mandate)  and over the
 aid it has given Rhodesia in cir-
 cumventing UN-backed economic
 sanctions.   Moreover, Vorster's
 attitude toward the three former
 British High Commission Territo-
 ries will be closely watched as
 two of them--Bechuanaland and
 Basutoland--gain their independ-
 ence under African governments
 within the next month.
 None of these issues requires
 any major initiative by South
 Africa,  and no significant change
 of position is expected.   However,
 Vorster has tactical choices in
 handling each one.   On South-West
 Africa, he can hide behind the
 legalism of the recent Interna-
 tional Court of Justice's decision
 not to consider the case, or he
 can flatly defy UN :involvement
 there and further inflame the
 African members.   Vorster can con-
 tinue Verwoerd's attitude of in-
 nocent normalcy about South Af-
 rica's continued trade with Rho-
 desia, or he can more outspokenly
 support the Smith regime and fur-
 ther embarrass the, West.   The rel-
 atively conservat:iVe black govern-
 ments in the High Commission Ter-
 ritories can be discreetly sup-
 ported and their economic depend-
 ence on South Africa quietly main-
 tained, or Vorster, can more bla-
 tantly exert Pretoria's  influence
 there.
 Should Vorster decide to take
 a more rigid stance on foreign pol-
 icy issues than his predecessor, he
 would only compound his problems in
 the international arena.   His lack
 of experience in international af-
 fairs--an area almost completely
 monopolized by Verwoerd--also is a
 handicap.

 GUATEMALAN PRESIDENT DECLARES WAR ON EXTREMISTS
 President Julio Cesar Mendez
 last week declared war on Gua-
 temalan extremists of both the
 left and right, describing force-
 fully in a public address his
 loss of patience with the pre-
 vailing conspiratorial political
 climate.
 The speech was a reaction
 to opposition attempts to dis-
 credit his administration with
 rumors that he is sympathetic
 to Communist terrorist forces.
 Calling his message a last
 hopeful summons to peace and
 concord, Mendez announced the
 reinforcement of all security
 forces and his readiness as
 commander in chief to order them
 into action against perpetrators
 of any new wave of disorder.
 The speech was well re-
 ceived by press and public.
 It eased the climate of inse-
 curity and may temporarily halt
 the rightist campaign to prop-
 agandize the government's "in-
 festation by Communists."
 There is no reason to expect
 that the address will affect
 Communist insurgent activity.
 In answer to the presiden-
 tial warning,  the Rebel Armed
 Forces  (FAR) --the Communist
 act:Lon arm--issued a bulletin
 accusing the government of
 allying itself with the military
 and the rightist in continued
 exploitation of the lower classes.
 The bulletin reiterated the FAR's
 aim to seize power through long
 revolutionary struggle,  and its
 intention to continue assassinat-
 ing rightists responsible for the
 "crimes" of the Peralta regime.
 The FAR claimed that during the
 past two months it had refrained
 from attacking government secu-
 ity forces,  and that it would not
 attack them unless provoked.
 Communist insurgency has in
 fact focused almost exclusively
 of late on its campaign of "ex-
 ecution" and kidnapings.   Illus-
 trating the difficulties in com-
 bating the Communists, Mendez
 told the US ambassador that gov-
 ernment forces had made no con-
 tacts in a recent sweep of the
 area of guerrilla activity.   The
 President recognize's that elim-
 ination of the guerrillas is a
 long-range problem and is at-?
 tempting to correct the weak-
 nesses of the security forces
 and to improve their intelli-
 gence capabilities.   He expressed
 awareness of discontent within
 the military, but claimed it ex-
 isted mainly among younger of-
 ficers and was not of crisis
 proportions.
 Although Mendez has improved
 his position for the moment,  some
 elements in the military are be-
 lieved to be disappointed that he
 has not issued "marching orders"
 for action against the Commu-
 nists but only stated his inten-
 tion to do so if terrorism con-
 tinues.   Should Mendez fail to
 act if the need arises, with the
 same force with which he spoke,
 discontent with the government
 could rapidly rise.

 PROTESTS AGAINST GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION
 I N ARGENTINA'S UNIVERSITIES CONTINUE
 The government of President
 Ongania continues to face stub-
 born resistance in its efforts
 to reform and check Communist
 influence in Argentina's univer-
 sities.
 The student agitation that
 has persisted since the regime
 assumed direct control of the
 country's eight national univer-
 sities in late July intensified
 during the past week.   Demon-
 strations became especially
 strong in Cordoba, where clashes
 with police resulted in the
 death of a student leader on 12
 September.   A 24-day hunger
 strike contributed to the un-
 easiness in Cordoba and classes
 at the university were finally
 suspended indefinitely.
 In Buenos Aires violence
 broke out during a "march of
 silence" organized by university
 groups mourning the student's
 death.   Minor disorders occurred
 in most of the other university
 cities,  although a nationwide
 strike called earlier by the
 recently outlawed Communist-dom-
 inated Argentine University Fed-
 eration failed.
 For the first time impor-
 tant labor groups began express-
 ing open support for the students.
 A brief work stoppage was called
 by the Cordoba branch of the
 powerful General Labor Confed-
 eration  (CGT)  in sympathy with
 the demonstrations there and
 CGT representatives said they
 would continue to support the
 students.
 After a drop-off in the num-
 ber of resignations among uni-
 versity professors,  64 faculty
 members resigned from the Buenos
 Aires medical school last week
 in protest against government
 policies.
 Despite the resistance to
 the intervention the government
 is determined to continue with
 its reform measures and with its
 pledge to eliminate subversive
 influences from the universities.
 A newly formed advisory council
 is to draft a higher education
 law which will give administra-
 tive control to the professors.
 Students will no longer have a
 strong voice in university gov-
 ernment as they did under the
 traditional principle of auton-
 omy.   In view of the unwilling-
 ness on both sides to compromise,
 the dispute over federal inter-
 ference in the universities is
 likely to pose a troublesome
 problem for the Ongania regime

 CONTINUED MALAISE I N ECUADOR
 Preparations for Ecuador's
 16 October constituent assembly
